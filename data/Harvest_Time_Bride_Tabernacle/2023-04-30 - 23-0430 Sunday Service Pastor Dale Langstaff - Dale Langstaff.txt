beautiful amen you know we can uh build homes down here and make plans but I can assure you it don't matter where you build your home or how you make your plans you're never going to find peace or complete satisfaction satisfaction here this world until the millennium is the Satan's domain he's got the keys until we leave amen and we're looking for a city like Abraham who's Builder a maker isn't a good government and it ain't a good country but it's the king of kings and Lord of lords it's Jehovah God I man you can you can live in the best place and I would encourage you to but you're only going to find peace and you know when you think that your whole being is comprehended and and consumed and going to in a Rapture into that place it's it really makes you uh change from this world Amen God God help me God help me it's I was really really beautiful man that's amen you may have your seats for a minute and thank you honey um we're gonna show some pictures and for a minute and uh just uh God bless you and just just great to be here in church and we sure love you and support you and amen and uh we just we had a I had a young brother you know and the body you know we're all in different stages and I had a young brother that was paying his ties and he came to me and he asked me he said where's the ties flow and I'm gonna I told that brother I said I'm going to answer some of those questions today I'm going to answer some of them right now man we'll Vicky we'll start with uh thing you know for this young brother and anyone else pastors paid ties also and Levites are to pay ties to Levites so pastors are Levites and I paid tithes too I pay my tithes the pastor Sunday Pastor Vincent and Pastor Leo I send them ties monthly amen I wish I had a picture of these brothers but I send your the charts amen because God's blessed us at home I don't need to make a living ministering I'm like Paul I make Nets man that's not on scriptural at all Amen brother Branham had a game morning job and worked for the electricity company and so at this time we can assist the bride around the world and I think it's neat for you to know what you're going to be a part of when you get to heaven amen here's a pastor that we met in Uganda he'd built a mud Church bamboo in my church and uh so he was shy of a roof there's a video there you can play it you can actually see the rain coming in now I have not physically been there you can see the rain raining inside the church and so I had Pastor Leo because I send money to Pastor Leo send this brother some of your money through his phone amen so we sent him enough for about five or six sheets of Steel to do this church I'm sorry it's so dark it's just I'm sending you what he sent me amen but there's one example of where your ties went in that past this is a different church this is a note reach this was a Pentecostal Church you might say or or at least not a message church at the time and uh that's one great blessing that um oh no that's one great blessing that they have there is uh just back another one or two further yeah okay um thank you is the people even in the denominational setting still have a strong pull for God and so Pastor Leo and Pastor Sunday was invited to this denominational Church the minister now can you imagine that happening here when the Baptist Church invites me to preach uh we'll be really close to going home amen and so they baptized 13 people you can go through this just slowly we got lots of time this morning this is the pastor to the to my left to your left and Pastor Leo there um okay we can go the next one this is Pastor Leo just arriving and he's showing us the church he's he's not trying to show himself he's just taking a selfie because there's probably nobody there he would give his phone to and so when after they preached there was you can take your time Vicky we got all day uh there were 13 people in that church wants to be baptized Jesus Christ you know they baptize people every single week Pastor Sandy and Leo we're in a this Outreach about type 13 Pastor Leo said I'm baptizing six this morning so far and Pastor Sunday was preaching another Outreach and on Saturday night I think he'd baptized two or three I said I said pastor Leo I would almost never baptize man amen who's rich and who's poor you can decide amen the Bible says lay up your Treasures where and so Pastor Leo told me this I'm just telling you what I was told you can read it in my WhatsApp he said it was during the rainy season he said it was pouring rain they're going to get baptized anyway Pastor Leo rented this truck with your money that we would send them he rented the truck so he could take the people in the pouring rain in the back to re-baptize like Nothing Stops nothing amen you can leave the video go this is just one person being baptized you can let it go through the video there was a video on the truck I believe Vicki maybe okay perfect yeah beautiful and then uh uh because it's raining season when they left Pastor Leo got hugely stuck and they don't have a tractor down the road at the neighbors they called the whole basically all the church and people around put as many people that could lean against the van and push the dope man Pastor Leo told me himself he said it was really god pushing it out because I was really stuck you can turn volume up we got volume we can only do this because you give you want to see where your ties goes for the young Brothers amen this is them getting close to leaving this was the pastor's wife and and Pastor Leo's with them they do prayer they pray that's another picture just we can move on they do a prayer when they're leaving so oh this is another video that's good the sister they're praying with hugely presence of God there in the baptisms hugely the presence of God Amen actually Pastor Sunday I think it was just it was within the last month I showed you honey Pastor Sandy was baptizing and he he baptized he was there for pastor Leo and the pillar of fire came in the baptism and you can see it just looks like a cloud around the bright sunny day like they sent me like a half a dozen pictures I'll show them to you I don't have them here it literally was like a cloud right hun you see sunny sunny day and it just went through the people amen so this is so for the young brother to ask me where I where the ties go the on your left there's Pastor Sunday he's the taller brother Pastor Leo's the next brother those are two pastors that I send ties to amen this is just Leo probably taking the picture and this is um going or coming from the video it's like the special the girls sing [Music] their whole life everything they think about is God this was the man that he I don't have this exactly clear he either owned the property or by the church or something and he's also a Christian and that was the ties that they paid him for the property or the building or where they Park the vehicle or something you got bananas that was the ties that they give them this is a spot like Pastor Leo told me he said I I missed taking the picture of the van in it he shows us the van when he gets it out but that's where he got stuck man and it shows the side of the van if you look down the side of the van it's uh uh very muddy and that was pushed out by anybody that could push this is a believer in brother Leo's church that sister Luanne gave she has six daughters and one son his son Lord Welling sister Ruth is helping brother Daniel to come here and he's going to attend Lambton College and work for us by if you know God permitting Lord willing and this is his mother and their father is a is a an army or a policeman army army army or policeman and he has an alcohol problem but he was a Believer he was a Believer and Pastor Leo told me they said he will go to the bar and be drinking and he will be preaching at the same time he'll tell him the only real God is the god that my family has my wife but I'll take another beer and he's preaching I said God will save them that'll save him he's literally preaching from the bar but he's a drunk himself so sister Luanne they call it capital A lot of times people that are completely hopeless uh brother uh Andre Boutique did this a lot in Haiti people that are completely hopeless rather than just give them a fish today and then they need a fish tomorrow if you give them just a tiny bit of capital they can fish the rest of their life you buy them a boat and they go fishing or you buy him a fishing rod they go fishing and so uh this is where Leo got stuck this is his video but sister Luanne gave that uh sister a little Capital so she could build that little shed and sell food goods for her family mainly her daughters are younger amen this is actually building the shed this was from after when we were there and that's their family the the tall brother in the center or Sue Lord willing will be coming to be with us Amen brother Daniel that's her in the shed after it's built yeah just we can move on there okay this is a sister sister Ruth's done a lot of clothes I don't I don't think I have many clothes but this family got a bunch of baby clothes from from the baby clothes that were sent through and this is actually the family that is going to live in the second house on the property by the church as soon as it's finished Roofing that's her seeing his wife amen this is a brother Pastor that we met there and uh I I honestly really have not supported him as of yet but I would like to some in the future we did support a person that was sick in his church a little bit but just go back to the other one sorry but um he he is in a completely different part of Uganda East close to Kenya so he's a long ways from Pastor Leo I'm not sure how far that is but multiple hours and they're printing books in the native tongue which actually I think 80 percent of the people can read a huge percentage and even there's other brothers in the capital city that were doing that another brother talked to me actually it was my interpreter my interpreter and so I was with him a lot and can pray for him also he's it's just uh but there's different so this one in the capital city actually uh Cloverdale supports and they had kind of changed their support uh funds I'm just repeating what he said he said funds were kind of tight and they had changed from printing so many books in the native tongue to do in a different language I didn't necessarily follow that completely but this brother is close to Kenya and he wanted he actually used me on his Facebook he wanted me to be the half I said I don't I said no I said I I'll encourage you and support you and I mean and I'll and uh but this brother uh what's his name sorry boy Branham and so they're printing books in the native tongue amen and if we can in the future send money for the printing of these books I will and if I go back if I don't go myself I'd like to send brother Jim there to see it's always good to see it's always good to see and touch and no amen so Lord willing but he's a really good friend he probably is watching our service right now he watches service every Sunday brother Ian I brought another brother right in the church that was in the house that's asked me for the link this morning just literally When I Was Here different people will be watching I hope you got that on the TV screen Vicky the video perfect thank you uh for brother Jim and sister Linda we were able to visit them this actually this was our visiting week we went and seen uh you can go to the next picture we went seeing John Blackman and just remember him we went seen Stephen Kathy and we also gave them not gave them this is for everybody because everybody here has a different interests the church your ties or or offerings we gave the doctor that's teaching Steve how to eat we made the check right out to him he's from Congo where they're fighting Sudan sedan uh and he seriously is like an angel uh literally he's from Sudan but his whole he's a doctor but he takes uh people that can't eat orphans babies babies from the hospital two years old that and literally he was teaching Steve because of Steve's head injury and that he would teach Steve how to to cough and and not choke to death and and all this stuff and so every morning because of him every morning Steve instead of just straight ivy straight up which is very expensive by the way uh uh every morning Steve eats two waffles and a banana every morning amen and so we gave the doctor 200 in their house made right out to the doctor from the church on the church check amen so that's a mission field at home so your mission field might not be in Uganda then your mission Field's over and whoever it is Warwick hey man she's been here a few times and so we try to witness and we're trying to show them and just remember Steve I I just think it would be an amazing Miracle to see Steve they have to go to the bathroom alone and Eat Alone that would just be praise God this is just Whoa stop don't move this is a church when me and and sister Luanne and Amy went to I'm just this is a kind of old news this we we I think last year sent money for his parsonage next to the church but when me and Luanne and Amy were there it was a bamboo church it was a straw roof and a typhoon took it down and way way back when we were still in the house we sent money for this church and by God's grace we're able to build this as many years ago this is eight years ago and they had a camp meeting here and he sent me pictures and it just blessed my heart because I I didn't know if the pastor was somewhat uh alone you know like he don't I don't see him in all the uh you know reach outs uh but uh anyway uh uh yeah right there yeah one of them yeah anyway this is so let's go through that group of pictures there so this was a church that okay there's there's probably mostly ministers or Minister wives there or just different pictures and it kind of blessed my heart there was actually a large picture of of people but this is something that you used to be a part of or those that were with us eight nine years ago in the house there there's the camp meeting see when you get there and you're having and God will say hey there's a star for you and you say what are you talking about they were way back so I don't even remember but God remembers God remembers amen God remembers amen lay up your Treasures where moth and wrath don't corrupt and thieves don't break through and steal I'm going to ask sister Ruth to come give a testimony and we're going to leave that right there in that picture sister Ruth give it the testimony of this uh this year um what's the matter which one I mean unless you want to set up right yeah God bless you Saints so who you see up there that's brother Gideon and his wife sister Susan um they sister Susan just recently gave birth to triplets um after being told probably over 25 years ago that she couldn't have any more children we only had one child and so obviously that's a big miracle and uh about 10 or 11 years ago at my brother's wedding in Uganda my dad is the one who told me this brother Gideon was the one officiating my brothers Joseph you know him he was officiating his wedding and so he was introducing his wife and uh he said that we only have one daughter and then he made a statement almost like something that he never even thought about it just came out of his mouth he said and there's more coming and my Dad held on to that and so uh his wife blushed and went off the stage and you know like that was that so when I gave my dad the news that they've gotten triplets he was like oh my goodness like I remember his words at Joseph's wedding when he said this and this and uh so he texted brother Gideon who you know was not even recalling that and then when when he narrated the story to him then brother Gideon remembered what he said back then so we give God thanks for that so uh the the children are prematurely born I think they're about seven weeks premature and right now they're in hospital uh sister Susan was in hospital for most of her pregnancy and the bill is extremely extremely high uh they're required to pay around 1400 Canadian per day and the hospital is demanding a down payment of a minimum of roughly nine thousand dollars to attend to the babies uh the total bill up to date up to up until yesterday for the hospitalization and everything else up until that point is 80 83 000. dollars so I'm just trying to do yeah that's Canadian so I'm just trying to do what I can to fundraise and you know spread the word and see how how they can be assisted now brother Gideon doesn't want doesn't want this to be broadly publicized um so um just keep that in mind uh even I mean you may talk to your friends or other brothers or sisters you may know but uh they don't want anything like you know their pictures or their story going on Facebook you know circulating around so just keep that in mind and keep them in your prayers and we trust that you know this is a mountain that is not too hard for God to move and it's going to be a testimony I believe that that we will hear the good side of it in a few times to come so thank you was brother Bernard's pastor and I preached for him three years ago and and he's a wonderful brother and he can really preach he has a large Church and uh he preached the Saturday night at Pastor Leos and actually the curtains behind Pastor Leo's church came from him originally you know amen we gave him a portion and the rest was a gift amen but a wonderful person and you know maybe we can just pull up the scripture and uh maybe we'll just uh stand with this and first John that was all there actually there was another picture of the sister but that's fine First John 3 16 17-18 just to say this if anything is given tagged for that need 100 of the penny will be sent to them 100 percent and the church we will send money on Monday for the this need when we praise God that the babies are healthy and the mom's healthy and uh everybody's live but I believe I was I was I believe I was told it was 220 million Uganda Shillings now I know what they make there an average person makes about a half a million a month and that's if they're employed so I mean it it's like if that was 83 000 over there Canadian that would be like 8 million here literally I mean it's just a non-believable mountain but you know God owns the cattle on a thousand hills and God has a a magnificent bride around the world and uh God knows where his his Help Cometh From amen and he's where he's placed it in his bride amen and uh this is this is no problem for God and think of the glory the God will get you know here's here's the brother spoke you know my wife knows something about that because I was we were talking this week and long before this man here's here's Pastor Gideon speaking that there was more coming you know when Joseph crossed the river it was at the brim it was at the top and the river never parted until they stepped in some things in your life you know what I read that quote a while ago it's about time that we start claiming what God's already given us and man just start speaking it it'll happen forget about the dope part you know amen it's God's will that couples have a family it's God's will that you know he said I know the thoughts I have for you it's not torture and persecution amen amen God help us amen God help us to just believe I mean this this is the the greatest Banker of all Jehovah God and man First John 3 16 17-18 and we'll let you have your seats and we'll just carry on and uh just looking forward to uh next Sunday is Mother's Day just remember we we've seen brother Jim and sister Linda also this week amen so we were visiting this week and uh just remember Sister Linda of course and brother Jim's taking care of her and and just that God would have mercy on them amen them and and also Steve and Kathy different ones brother John just many people you know if you think you got if you think you're having it rough you need to travel or visit some people I mean it just uh we're very blessing man amen hereby perceive ye the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren [Music] but whosoever hats of the world's good and seeth his brother in need now you know first you have to have it but if you have it and you see your brother in need and you set up your bowels of compassion for him how dwelleth the love of God in him my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth Lord Jesus we ask you to just add the blessing to your word this morning bless your bride Lord Jesus as we as we Minister here this morning your what you've laid on our hearts and the words of truth Lord Jesus in a special way amen amen God bless you you may have your seats this morning hey man I just want to read another scripture Psalms 25 10. just carrying on our same thought I I uh I believe Beyond any shot of a doubt that we're moving on after today and uh I believe God's got something different for us for Mother's Day amen next week and just be talking uh moving in a different direction amen Psalms 25 10 says all the paths of the Lord are mercy and Truth unto such his Covenant and the word covenant is God's laws so if you want God's mercy and truth you got to keep his lost or his Covenant and all these are his Covenant and his testimonies and we drop down to 14 and the secrets of the Lord is with them that fear Him and he will show his Covenant again amen God God has a peculiar people amen and and God's proud of his peculiar people just like a young brother or or or or or man a man betrothed to uh to a sister amen see it's it was God's pick and God's proud of his bride before the foundation of the world Amen and but but God expects things from us also amen we we've read the scripture many times all scriptures given for for correction and reproof and exhortation amen and God help us to look into these these different scriptures that we don't normally look into Philippians 4 6 and 7. and this is a scripture we're just going to touch on laying down peace be careful for nothing you know I was looking into the ministry and you know in the Scripture it shows muzzle knocked the ox that trampled the corn and all these things and and you know it was just bless me you know you know when when when the brother in the Bible invited Jesus to his house and the sister came and washed his feet you know he had invited Jesus for uh for uh uh he had invited Jesus because he liked them he had actually invited Jesus and this blessed my heart and it I'm just trying to show you what God what God's word's showing you is he said every time the other side does that every time the make-believer did like this brother did was the mock Jesus to Mark the troops amen and so if you're out in the travels of your life and you see somebody that mock you they're mocking God through you and see these people were directly mocked and got the mocking Jesus amen and making fun of the sister washing his feet and how much it costs and could have spent and and then in the same text and and all this I studied this week how the people came to Jesus asking them we're going to talk about taxes and saying you know should we paint see they were trying to trap Jesus they didn't really want to know the truth uh-huh and you'll see that in the ranks that you will be sometimes people will try to crop you you've all felt like you were going to be trapped and no matter what you said true or false you were still trapped and they did the same thing to your lord was to try to drop them but look at this spirit they're not one of us nobody in the spirit of Christ tries to trap Christ never never be careful for nothing and in everything you have prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving and let your requests be made known to God and the peace of God that passes all understanding I mean you'll never figure it out even if you go to university so keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus that's Philippians 4 6 and 7. I always want to I just want to dwell on that for a second you know I in studying and and I reach out you know and you know I try to I mean of course we we're looking for God's will but as a minister you'll look out and look in the edges and God can bring it back to you know amen I have quotes right in front of me or read this week amen where where God always had a levite in the area God always had a witness in the area and God always gave it to the levite to give it to a sheep it's just I mean that's just the way it is if you can't understand that or you struggle with that ask God about it amen I don't mean that God can't give you the Holy Ghost and and you'll discern if that's you should know who labors among you amen but at some point at some point you should be at peace with who's labor and among you you shouldn't go through your whole life in turmoil no different you shouldn't go through your whole life in turmoil for anything else because you have to come to rest and peace amen that's that's what the Holy Ghost was given for it wasn't a law but it was rest and peace amen and so I seen this and this was a doctor and you know you know my feeling on this and I apologize in advance for anybody that's watching that that disagrees and that's all right but if Max was here I'd have to apologize to him this morning and the next time I see him I actually will apologize to him but I want to tell you something uh this was a medical doctor that was is not a believer and he was investigating all this stuff that's happened the last three years in our lives hugely and some of the stuff he told me and I'm I'm actually going to probably investigate it more and I will tell you more in the future but he he showed and proved how everything was the Catholic Church in Rome he said Rome has never lost power since Jesus was here no it was Roman Jesus was here and it's still wrong see it was a physical government then now it's just it's not a spiritual government I refuse to say that it's a it's a religious government that's better it's a covering government and this was unbelievable and he showed me things that that I will have to apologize to the max for but he said you know that Dr felchi he was showing how the Jesuits control the world the Catholic priest said you know Dr fauci went to a Jesuit university do not know that President Biden went to exactly the same Jesuit college no I'm gonna have to duck down it I hope you ain't got no eggs you know that President X Trump went through the exact same Jesuit college and Juno that I would say In the Flesh you know we have to be so careful because we have to come above us and and I I'm in favor of doing what's best for us when we're still here but don't look for a better place to live because the conservative leader that's running for our country that will probably win is a member a hundred percent thank you of the world economic Forum it probably went to the same Jesuit school and this guy showed how that Biden in his campaign has only got 50 percent of the Americans and so the Romans are working through Trump to come with a different angle and still backing the vaccine and everything he also showed where the pope Pope the pope today said the the the the two greatest needs in the world were Humanity had to vaccinate them all tada he left out that person amen I might also shock you so so the news broadcaster and this you need to hear this because like amen don't put your hope in people don't put your hope in politicians don't even put your hope in the fivefold ministry although God uses them the real five-fold Ministry but put your hope in Christ we're going to heaven and Canada ain't heaven and Uganda ain't Heaven either or the Philippines or any other place definitely not the Americans you see what I mean and up north ain't happening down North ain't heaven because the same Lucifer is controlling every one of them now there's there's ones where there might be you know less but before we go it'll all be the same you know there's 69 countries in the world where it's illegal to be something but that'll all change before we go it has to it has to it's called the squeeze and it's called taking us out of here and Christ will take us out of here so I want you you know ask the flesh we get oh well if we just get a new government I say that too often nothing will change Trump made on Max told me that he said he's he's he he said he's just one of them he is one of them he's taken his orders from the Pope so they showed me the guy came back and he said well how's how's China and Russia and even I I said I believe the states will go to war with China and I do believe that I I did clarify that it wasn't a prophecy but man when you hear this brother he said well how's China tie you into controlling the world we know it came from there and China was the one that came out with a lot of the vaccinations and and uh and we know that the virus came from there and he said now he knows this personally he knew the bride personally he'd interviewed him for an hour he said that you know that China receives traffickers I'm speaking in uh so adults to understand and so I don't get in prison tomorrow but China receives traffickers from Rome and Italy and those bodies are Saran Wrap babies children and that brother had worked 20 years cutting the Saran Wrap off of infants headed to China because the the news broadcaster asked him he said how come China pays Rome like 120 million a month and he said see China's the boss of the world they actually got dominion over China and that doctor watch this that doctor no way you're right brother Matt that doctor caught something and he went out to his producer so exactly that's how he said you watching me he walked out to his producer and he said did you hear what that guy said China was the boss he said not even close he said Rome is a drug lord and they have a product called children for trafficking and they sell it to China and China pays 120 million a month to Italy Rome and you thought this world was your home I'm just like I almost lost control and the girls sang that song the God all I can think about is getting out of here I I just just just come and take me home I don't want to live here brother Matt I don't want to live here I want to go home in a rapture that is that is the most I can I actually sent the videos to Sister Ruth everything was it yeah matter of fact he went into so many things and not sorry I'm supposed to be preaching but he went into everything was the inflation of Mexico coming into the United States He said what what religion is Mexico 95 percent thank you sister Patty Roman Catholic everything is a plant everything is a plan it's a one world government and it's coming really fast really fast and I'm going to tell you something I don't believe it was but that vaccination accepting that from Rome you accept that from the Roman Catholic Church that was very closest thing to the mark of the beast I don't believe it was but that was in part accepting Fellowship with evil now I you might all leave me by next Sunday but if I tell you something evil and you take it and still fellowship with me that's given the right hand to Fellowship and that's what the mark of the beast is I mean sometimes the truth is scary but wow amen God help God help us man it's not going to get easier before we leave amen it all it will get easier as you surrendered him you say it just don't matter God it just don't matter it just doesn't matter everything's yours that that's that's my goodness that wow God help us God help us you know see here we read our last scripture in first Samuel 15 22 he said God God has his obedience is better than sacrifice God is expecting obedience in his word amen God is expecting obedience and and watch here in first Samuel 15 23 and it says to re Rebellion as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity iniquity is the no to do right not do it so there you know the word of God and you look right at the word of God and you say about I don't know I'm not going to read that for devotions amen and you know even my you know when I was studying even my wife said you know we were talking some of these things and I was showing her the video and he said you know you know if you're struggling with what I just said you know the Bible says that if you were guilty in one part yeah if you you're a really good believer but you're guilty in just one part you guilty of them all amen God help us amen this is this is see God wants God's Mary God never came to marry a baby he came to marry mature adults that that are sold out to him amen it's it's it's it's just wow it's beautiful it's beautiful amen Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus here in first in Samuels or in James I'm sorry in James 22 it says but be not doers of the word but be be not but be ye doers of the word sorry and not hearers only deceiving only yourselves you need to pull that up because that's worth seeing James swan 22. being doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourself wow amen this is this is not amen look at look at the hear what the prophet said he said here in in 63 uh here he said the paragraph uh one-on-one he said let to be born again is to have a new nature come in and he said the only way is to kill the nature that's inside of you that you might become the word the living the word living because the word's a living thing and it's the expression of itself through you and I I got this just blessed my heart to say this and there's so many scriptures where the Prophet mentioned this he said when you're looking into a Looking Glass when people see you as Amir he said because you know that God made uh made a way and people don't read the Bible now how many know that people do not read the Bible maybe even Christians struggle with reading the Bible you know that people do not read the Bible so God has made no this is a direct quote and so God has made you a Bible you are what you do people are looking at you Amen Let me just read another one let's just go up here and I wrote it on my thing here here in 64 questions and answers he said Christians aren't what you say it's what you live what you do it's an it's an example he said you are the salt of the earth people are watching you and even more so you know if the world gets darker and darker there might only be a few of you but when I go to the shed and it's midnight dark I can take a really small lash late and I can see where I'm going hey man people are watching you and people that's another great quote on questions and answers oh wait uh 30 in the morning he said people won't go to church how did the prophet know that message people won't even go to church they said people won't go to church but they'll read you and you better see what you do because the only church they're going to see is you at the grocery store amen a paragraph 47 he said the of the spirit is the holy spirit is a being it's God it's God in you the person the person God that's the whole entire being like wow is it neat and it's in you let me all right to read that again the holy spirit is a being it's God and God in you the person God you're able to say sit down wow and that's it your whole entire being you're changed you're a new creature the things you do the world will look at you and go oh oh I don't understand they are never going to understand you hey man you won't even understand you I'm mad paragraph 48 he said whatever you've done for God it won't mean one thing he's talking about he's talking about if you jumped and preached and spoke in tongues and prophesied and did all that he said whatever you've done for God it won't mean one thing if the Holy Spirit wasn't there to condemn you to to condemn you on the things that are right and wrong you know I told you there last week that we went and seen people that Luanne had not seen for 40 years at the funeral I told you that you know she had a friend it was before we were married so that's a while ago told her when she's there she said I have something to make right with you he ain't a message Believer by the way not that I know and he called the land this week if the Holy Spirit ain't in you to condemn what's right and what's wrong he had only spoken to Luanne on the telephone in a harsh way after we got engaged hello that was like 39 years ago and it was still condemning him and he was living with them because he had talked harshly whoa how much more amen and if the Holy Spirit that the Holy Spirit isn't in there to condemn you on the things that is right and wrong you know God lives in you know this is I can't preach any happier than that if you know God lives in you and that you won't walk on your own mind it's the mind of Christ that leads you in the word in the word wow man this message is fantastic I it's it's just God it's it's God's fantastic to think that God almighty is a being the spirit of God God is the spirit knows the word the spirit is a being and you're a hundred percent the spirit oh Church my goodness you did whoa so watch Aaron he said whatever he says and this is an older quote he said he said it We Don't Preach he said it's a holy spirit that does the speaking oh you might write something he's talking about this is the Prophet by the way I'm actually reading this he said you might write something down us ministers we might study I know it says study yourself and prove and I love being in the word of God that's not a problem but I say things that don't have nothing to do with studying he said you might write something down but that isn't that isn't preaching he said preaching is the inspiration that comes and sees the preaching is inspired by the Holy Ghost and he said that gives the uh the anointing gives the action to the word of God he said just he said you can read something and it doesn't matter a bit he said but when the Holy Spirit grabs onto it it won't matter how the preacher says it won't matter if his coat matches his patents when the Holy Spirit grabs onto it look out Scout amen God help us amen God help us amen hallelujah he said Malachi 2 2 so we can move on with this uh Malachi 2 2 if ye will not hear to give Glory unto my name sayeth the Lord of hosts I will then send a curse upon you and I will curse your blessings yea I have cursed them already because you have not laid it in your heart I'll give you the wrong scripture I must be seeing it wrong I'm sorry your pastor is amen Malik m-a-l-a-c-h-i Malachi 2-2 amen you know my wife tells me that you're not supposed to say you're and I read a quote the other day for the prophet said I don't have it with me and the prophet said that it was good for you to insult yourself that raises Christ's stuff now don't you do it somebody else but if you do it to yourself amen hallelujah it's the truth amen God help us see here we we need to hear God's word and give glory to him sometimes we say you know everything we have is God's here here you know in this scripture we're going to look at where God sends a minister out he said don't take nothing with you amen I I could tell you some stories but I think you would see me but but even probably my own kids thought that we had personally lost our mind you know when when you get older the Bible says that you become as children and I think our kids are thinking that if Luanne ain't there I'm probably getting close to it but I I have scriptures and quotes watch this we couldn't afford to go to Uganda me and my wife figured out the bill we spent about 23 000 Canadian 100 on the Visa that's exactly 100 the Bible he said you don't listen to what people say don't listen Jake's go where God sends you he said don't take a suitcase don't take a second pair of shoes don't take any money and he said that's where he was actually talking about the muzzle and the ox of the servant being worthy to hire you and he said you go into the house and you live from the people man God help us if you will not hear and give Glory unto my name say it's the Lord of hosts I'll send a curse unto you and curse your blessings now man we don't need our blessings cursed for sure not God help us let's move on Hebrews 10. Hebrews 10 31 it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a living God Hebrews 10 31 a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God and the prophet will mention we'll read some quotes on that Amen Let me just read uh uh some here he said people were making fun of him when he was when when not I have to be careful when he says when the prophet was Discerning the thoughts of the people now people come up to him he said that's fortune telling remember I mentioned about the devil perverts everything God does he said farting telling his other of the devil the people that were doing that to our Prophet were insulting God they weren't insulting the prophet they were insulting Jehovah God he said did you ever he said he said that's taking that's nothing but a gift perverted he said just like on righteousness to righteousness perverted see everything that we do serving God the devil has took it and perverted it so he says he said did you ever see a fortune teller preaching the gospel save and soul no but they'll sell it for money stay away from that money amen a fortune teller healing holding a healing service or doing some great money Works to God no it's a it's a it's a it's a permission it's a perversion of what Jehovah God only can do we know that you're a man sent from God because no man can do these things amen Hallelujah so be careful friends what you say about about anything that God does that's what I said oh man that's not my anointed he said be careful what you say about anything what God does because it's a dangerous thing to fall into the hands of a living God and if you don't understand it you'd better just sleep still don't say nothing say the Lord Make Me humble and I'll understand and come to that you wouldn't want to know the things that people said when God started to work here it's a kind of attitude he said you just get away from get up go away with the crowd and pass your own opinion he said search the scriptures it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of God he said if it be God stay with it and if it isn't God get away from it but if it's if it isn't scriptural than it is of god amen here he says that just falling down he says I'm only reading the highlights he said he said he will never be without a witness and he said when God sends a gift to Earth he sends and the people reject it that generation goes into chaos and Blackness and darkness and reject darkness of and rejecting God watch us God judges that generation the same way that generation mocked God's gifts wow the exact same way that those people mock God's gifts is how God Will Mock and judge them for rejecting them wow I want to know these things I personally want to know these things I don't understand just God help me no man has tamed the tongue but the Holy Spirit amen Hebrews 13 7 Hebrews 13 7. and we're going to read uh I I there's multiple quotes on these I go into the message Hub and I'm just printing these quotes out that the prophet said in the same verse but I erase them I I had ones that I think and I erased more last night when I was printing them and remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the words of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation and here the prophet said in identifying Christ in all ages he said because the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever identifying Christ in all ages you know how you're identifying Christ what's Christ Christ is the anointed one and you are anointed this morning amen you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost who's Christ this morning hello the anointed the Holy Ghost filled brothers and sisters are anointed with Christ not you in the flesh aren't Christ but if if you are the being of God inside you amen watch what he says here identifying Christ and all now did you notice here that the scripture saying remember those that have the rule over you considering your conversation you see the end of their conversation is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen that's not a yesterday gospel that's a right now Jesus amen hallelujah Hallelujah I had a brother one time tell me that this was the government I said I never knew any government to watch for my Souls amen God help us amen Matthew 10 and seven if we're in the same house remain as eating and drinking and such things as was given for a laborer is worthy of us higher in Matthew 10 10 it says a Workman is worthy of his meat and here here in the Revelation Series in 61 the prophet mentions he says he says you go and you're sent and he said he said you don't take it with Assurance he said you don't go because you're going to get this this is his exact words he said you don't go because you're going to get a hundred thousand dollars for preaching a Revival he said you don't go he said he said you go because you were sent to go I'm sending you to go and he says you go right where you're sent and I already mentioned this and don't pay no attention to all the critics I say otherwise what anybody else says amen and he says later the same hour remaineth in the same house rather remaining in the house eating and drinking such as was given unto them that means when you go to the mission field you don't fill your suitcase with granola bars because you'll live eating their food amen I found that to be true and now that now the prophet puts us in Brackets and the prophets mocking the people that's coming against God's word and he said now all this stuff about eating meat and so forth oh my goodness see profit like eating meat even the Lord liked to eat meat when he came to Abraham they killed the little calf gave a meat and milk I'm going to do well in heaven brother Tim amen for the laborers are worthy of his higher he goes into this morning man Matthew 5 37 let her let your communication be Matthew 5 37 let your communication be yea and yay and nae and nay for whatsoever more these cometh is of evil amen we need to be honest people we need to be honest people in the country if we say something we need to stand with our word even if it hurts amen I share things like this in other countries amen but hearing questions and answers in 57 the prophet says to say make sure that you hold your hand oh here here's somebody coming to the prophet it was a Catholic priest and he said will you hold your hand out and solemnly swear to tell the truth and he the prophet said he said I will not the prophet is preaching back to the priest and he says because the Bible says that to swear not in heaven or on Earth because the Earth was his footstool and it says let your yab not and the bishop said something he said well I want to hear what you got to say he said did you baptize a certain certain person in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said I did but I won't swear amen God help us I know when we put up our fence and you know the prophet said things that are uh you know we're going to get into where he paid this taxes amen and things I know when we we put up a line fence and the the people refused to obey the law and and we went to a tribunal and they wanted me to swear in the Bible and I said no sorry I can't do that and I'd forgive you forget how they handled that but I still testify and the neighbor still paid for path defense amen it don't mean that Christians have to be a doormat no different than your wife isn't a doormat you don't have to be a doormat like imagine I I don't even understand some things that uh uh you know as the government changes and comes in on us amen we have the right to to have the law that stands with us amen you don't just have to give everything amen like for example when we put the gravel in the backyard and we were improving the parking lot that's been there before the town was here they come after us and said we're going to put 10 000 on your taxes and because you didn't get an engineer and put drains in and pavement and concrete it and all this and I just said uh I went and seen Mr lawyer and Mr lawyer wrote him a letter and he quoted back their loss to them instead of this has ever been a parking lot it can be maintained as a parking lot don't matter how much the parking lot was in disrepower see so a Christian just don't you don't just throw out the money necessarily their own laws they were see they were trying to abuse you the Christians aren't to be abused they're supposed to be humble and submissive but hey man if you don't huh so that'll get your hair up when when people keep people in jail that they don't even have a right to keep in jail like Tamar from the truckers Convoy and she never even committed she never broke a law the Constitution stands with her for the right to to demonstrate and they left her in jail for almost two years that government should be kicked in the knee amen because their own laws condemn them their own laws that's not breaking the law their own laws condemned them amen that's like when the Government tried to close the churches and in the Constitution that we have the right to freedom and worship period that's their law besides that their law don't stand above the law of God every time it comes second amen here here's talking about let's read uh they're talking about here here you should be honest and truthful and you let your yay be day and your nae nae and I I tease Leo with this and that in Uganda because you know we show up four four hours late to a church but there's something to that he said watch this he said the prophet says we're not supposed to have vain repetition and not have Idle Words let your yes be yes and your no no if you say you're going to show up show up if you say you're going to buy a lawnmower buy a lawnmower or whatever little thing it is he said for any more of this cometh for anything more than this come a sin so whichever is more is this cometh evil the Bible says evil the prophet said sin he won't sinned amen so you could have good and believe me I got the T-shirt I used to tell people I'd show up to work on their house and some of them I still haven't showed up for amen everybody I said when are you going to show up and I'd say two weeks and but I was God forgive me man we shouldn't we shouldn't mature and come out of that just say truthfully I'm busy I can't be there for two months maybe not even this year I wasn't good at that man what kind of people should we ought to be then this is a prophet talking we should be sober and ready always looking and waiting for the leading of the Holy Spirit Christians are the salt of the earth that's what he's saying about this verse right here amen you have watched this and I love this oh I love this praise God I tell you I challenge you when you're at home this last week I've been listening to the message every night in bed I put it going when I go to bed and five o'clock when I wake up I set it up it's been amazing but listen the invisible Union of Christ right before he died oh my you'll just you'll be fat spiritually he said watch this those are the prophet talking paragraph 33. he said you got a barrel of meat and a barrel of salt you know I want to cut in here remember what I was saying about going to the preachers thing you know seen the preacher at the guy station going to preacher singing and going here going there I said I'm not joining them but I'm trying to huh you know the prophet deal with this he said you got a barrel of meat and you got a barrel of salt here and it'll never save the meat until you get the salt in contact with the meat uh-oh so if you just keep living in your home and you never say anything or do anything and you just hide your little beautiful light under a bushel and you don't share it with anybody because you're afraid of hurting your little tiny feelings you're afraid of the meat getting mixed you'll never save the meat till it comes in contact and we got to be salty and it's got a contact the world that means you got to have or you got to be really bright he said you got to be salty and it's got to contact the world it's the Savor and the salt makes the salt creates a thirst and when you're a Christian people who's called themselves Christians are we Christians we call ourselves Christians then then we'll be then you call yourself Christians we'll be so salty will be so salty that when you go outside everybody the sidewalk walks up to talk to you that the world will desire to be just like you you're making a contact with them I wonder if we've been doing a good job on that have you seen Christians you'd say oh I just love to be like that woman I just love to be like that man if there ever was a Christian then there is one that's salty and you just be salty and God will take care of the thirst Matt the prophet and other places said that if we if we weren't salty God would judge us for not doing it amen wow taxes Matthew 22. actually before we go into that James 7 this is the same same line as conversation James 7 or James 5 12. he said Above All Things Brethren swear not neither by Heaven neither by Earth neither by any other oath but let your yea be ye and your nay nay lest ye fall into condemnation so you know see if you want to take that to the extreme if you said you know this is I know this is to the extreme but sometimes the prophet said when you're you're lean you lean one way to bring them to pull them back to center of the road and then I'll come right back to the center well like I was trying to explain this to Pastor Leo I said you know we told him we'd be there four hours ago we told them we'd be there at 11 o'clock and we showed up at three o'clock that you'd have no condemnation see you can't put your traditions the head of God's word you can say well us Canadians we're just starting we don't get excited well maybe you need to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you won't be Canadian anymore amen just like you know I I was Pastor Leo asked me because we're friends and we speak the truth he you know he was driving the one time and it rained and the road was slippery and you've seen the road to stick to their mess they're they're they're not even roads they're just like they're terrible I mean they call them roads but you know by the way this just came to me you know when we were finding Pastor Sandy's house we we we would pull up our Google on my phone and they would have the roads there and they'd say no identification to these roads they were appointing us to his church that was the freeway anyway he asked me he said well have you ever drove on slippery roads and I said pastor Leo he said we get snow and ice because he was saying like it rained so the roads were bad so I have to go slower I said pastor Leo I said when it snows at home and I'm going to church and I know it snowed I leave early see that's a good word that's a good word let your yay be yay that you do not have condemnation man that's why people don't trust nobody no more because they say I'm going to buy something and you have to give a deposit because that's why when we bought the girl's house you know we never signed nothing you know they agreed to so much I said I'll buy it and it was a done deal and the people were moving in and they were having a meltdown they said you ain't signed nothing I said no he told me this he told me what he wanted I have the money and he said but what if he I said it was our word Prophet said if your word ain't good you ain't no good either uh so what he said he said you're as good as your work amen so so these things are scripture I meant and and by the way I just want to point out that this is in Matthew and James amen just just so everybody knows that we're not being ridiculous here I mean this is scripture I meant taxes I mean Matthew 22 17. and that is is it lawful to paste tribute unto Caesar or not and he saith unto them whosoever is this image an inscription they said unto him Caesars then he said unto them Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesars and unto God the things which are gods amen and our Prophet had some some uh to say about this amen sorry I think sure I didn't miss a quote amen see they were trying at this time and we mentioned this stuff they were trying to trap Jesus and make an offense to him they were playing games with him they didn't really care what he thought about this but they were trying to get him in jail for breaking the law and here he goes into uh you know you know when uh Peter owed taxes or Peter and Jesus owed taxes in the Bible and Jesus asked Peter he said you got a fish hook in your pocket and I I love this man this is the god that you serve it's a God that you serve Jesus said I just made a deposit in a fish today I said you got a fish you got a hook Peter God knows everything and he said go drop that hook down and he said pull up that fish and cut him open he said there's a good piece in there and go pay the taxes for you and me it's always the Bible says it and let me kick into where the puff and he said so they're not offended by us wow now I don't sometimes it's impossible to not have somebody but he said let them not be offended and bring the offense to them but see go pay it Simon Peter and that'll be for me and for you but when we went down we here he's talking about the his taxes amen I better I better start again this is absolute 62. let me start at the top he said he he's under pressure about his taxes now you know I'm going to tell you this up front I would not be the person that pressured The Profit into paying taxes that he didn't know I wouldn't want to be that person brother Matt in the Judgment I just I would really want to be a long ways from that first a really long race because vengeance is mine saith the Lord but the prophet never owed that money but watch his thought in this and you know I I struggled with this quote just being honest with you because the Bible also says the borrower is a slave to the lender but here's the prophet and he said I thought that I've turned over in the Bible and I read and he said I thought that truly but here he's wrestling with God he said but Lord that's right but he said this didn't belong to Caesar this was yours he said it wasn't Caesar's he said it's been it it's being mine and he said it was paid more in taxes than something has been different he said it never belonged to Caesar but it was yours and it belonged and he said see he said and it was it don't belong to Caesar in the first place here's the prophet wrestling with God actually in the this this front page he says he said I went in to pray he said I thought I'm trying to jump ahead and God's rebuking me he said well maybe I'd better go pray again it seems like he said to me look in the scriptures and he said I went and searched the scriptures of what God said about it amen and here's the prophet searching the scriptures knowing what to do in his own life and he's saying God this money was given to the church for the mission field it never was Caesar's it's already had the taxes paid on it and we have a charitable number and I'm just going to tell you my thought if he would have had a good lawyer the prophet would have won what was it his he hadn't spent the money here's the prophet telling how he worked it out he said you know he God always says the answer in his word he said I read a little father and he said Simon you know you got a fish hook in your pocket he said you always carry a little fish hook and a string it's a good way to feed yourself and he said you just made a deposit he said I just made a deposit in the fish bank this morning down up the river he said you know he said I made a perfect deposit in a banker and he said I'll certainly Give It Up what he's got he said just go down there and throw the hook in the river and then you get up to the bank and open your mouth and there he said go pay the coin he said I thought true God but you got fish Banks and everything else across the country and I don't know how this is to be done the prophet's struggling with this you know this was a tremendous battle he went through he was almost sick to his stomach over and he said so after he read that scripture this is what the prophet did he said we went down and I got the brothers right here from the church that stood on my Note so he got brothers from the church that signed and he said I put a note in and he said I borrowed forty thousand dollars and paid the government off and he didn't owe the money but he did that so they weren't offended wow and I went home and I wanted to know the way the check was wrote see he wrote in the check if they ever came back to me again he said this say this that I'm this is what he wrote on the memo of the check this was for all taxes paid but he wrote you hear he's saying it a little differently he said this is to say that I'm free from all tax bills and if the government endorses it and takes it then they'll be in a mess and I'll be free and the prophet kept calling the bank to find out from the bank manager if they cast it and he said yes but uh they did take it they accepted it Billy they took it and he said I ran and threw my wife and he said I'm free I'm pardoned and he said I'll pay back that forty four four thousand a year forty thousand for 10 years all because he didn't want to offend the government wow now see that money there's a way when you look at that money all monies is the government even charitable money is a government law that's government money it's made by government and that's got to be the reason why the prophet and he felt God leading him to do that because there's other scriptures that would have stopped him from borrowing amen amen amen like like it but you know I'm not questioning the prophet that's he did what he felt God led him to do amen but we should be careful borrowing money amen amen thank you Lord Jesus we're going to close on this we're just I'm just going to touch on this you know uh and I'm not going to preach on this because it it don't apply I'm gonna I touch the first scripture I did look into scriptures on tithes and offerings and there's dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens amen Malachi 3E will man rob God yet ye have robbed me but he says wherein have you robbed thee in tithes and offerings ye are cursed with the curse for ye have robbed me even the whole nation and bringing ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now where herein herewith say it's the Lord of hosts if I will open the windows of heaven and I'll pour up blessings upon thee and that there shall be not room enough for you to contain it amen and here's the prophet he's talking about this and he gives an amazing scripture he says he says uh he says if somebody gave me 25 cents to go down and buy a loaf for Brad and and I met somebody on the street and they asked me for some money and I gave them your money he said I didn't have the right to do that and he said that's what you do when you don't pay your tithes he said you should have given your money not the money that I give you for Brad he said let them take it out of the other pocket and give them my money but this was your money the tense is the Lord's the Levi's the priest is a tense that they live on the tense of tidying is brought into the storehouse and promised to God that he would bless it and prove it tizen goes to the church pastor and so forth like that to live and the building funds and things like that are separate all together not scriptural but he here here the prophet what I want to go into the prophet he talked about how when he paid tithes when he paid tithes he said his family was sick and he said this was wow here let me just read this just find this here he said it was a challenge to any individual he said he said if I only had the time I said I would get into the scripture and finish this uh my personal testimony said now how I was even hungry and my mother and them hungry and my daddy was sick and I took my ties out of ties out first and I gave it to God and you ought to see what happened I never seen in my life where any man or woman that if you'll make a dollar a week and if you'll pay 10 cents of that money and put it in the storehouse of God that where you'll come where God will bless it he said you may call me a hypocrite but he said that's the truth sir amen we all know we all have those testimonies say man God help us amen to be here here looking back at some of these quotes that I just pulled up this morning I just want to finish on these and we can let this go amen here was in first Timothy 5 18 where talked about don't muzzle The Oxen and uh that traps out the corn amen and here he talks about in this bottom Divine Healing he said and he said you're supposed to heal the sick cleanse the leopard raise the dead and cast out Devils freely you have received freely give it don't take no money and a whole lot of changes of clothes and make suitcases and just to take and just just take off he said for the laborers worthy of his higher he said don't muzzle the ox the stamps out the corn he said you go ahead and he said then went out and preached and that was his first Commission amen amen thank you Lord Jesus hey man I'm just going to close with two more scriptures he said always honor your pastor he said he's worthy of every bit of Honor you'll give him the Bible says that yes sir he said don't muzzle the ox that tramps out to corn he said God this is another another quote and we're just I'm just literally the last one here finish God always deals with the Elder of the church and now he gives the church his message that they can bring what's needed to the church amen God help us amen God help us in all these things amen Hallelujah just something I'm just looking through my amen amen Hallelujah let's stand let's stand thank you Lord Jesus amen thank you Lord Jesus sing a song I saying remember the one song you say let's sing the course of the song the girls sing we have the words of that on your thing just the course of it maybe it's a beautiful beautiful song Amen I I really believe Church that we can get spiritually to the point that we're almost no earthly good I I know I know we still have to live here and pay your bills but you can just be so enthontament you are what your thoughts are you are out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks and if you just can focus on amen that's what'll give these young boys and young children the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that because we're living Christ we're just it's just the anointing of God everywhere amen amen and when you get to that point it'll be like this course you just foreign [Music] cause lately I've got leaving on my mind [Music] Oh my Jesus it's dreams and all I think about
