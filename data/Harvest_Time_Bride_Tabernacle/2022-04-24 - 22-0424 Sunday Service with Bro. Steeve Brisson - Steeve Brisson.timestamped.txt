[1:01:31] um
[1:01:33] you know there is there is bible stories
[1:01:37] that are there that are
[1:01:40] i would say
[1:01:43] they are the extreme case of a certain
[1:01:46] situation
[1:01:47] take for an example
[1:01:50] the
[1:01:51] an unfair fight
[1:01:54] okay
[1:01:55] what is on in the bible a story about
[1:01:58] unfair fight
[1:02:00] all right david and goliath okay it's
[1:02:02] it's the extreme right you got this
[1:02:05] warrior that
[1:02:06] you know i don't know 14 feet high and
[1:02:09] this giants again a kid okay so this is
[1:02:12] like
[1:02:14] unfair fight even non-christian there
[1:02:16] it's still
[1:02:17] you know if somebody was asked to you
[1:02:19] know meet a giant even non-christian
[1:02:22] will say oh you know this is david and
[1:02:23] goliath right
[1:02:25] it is
[1:02:26] even the world cannot find
[1:02:29] the most extreme example they have to
[1:02:31] fall back to the bible right
[1:02:34] okay so
[1:02:35] this uh we say in french a word it's uh
[1:02:38] we say caricature
[1:02:40] candy catsuri is like when you know you
[1:02:42] have this drawing in the newspaper
[1:02:44] somebody draws like a situation in the
[1:02:46] news but they enlarge every
[1:02:50] you know it's i don't have the word in
[1:02:52] english for that where we say carry
[1:02:53] catsure so it's everything is
[1:02:55] exaggerated to make the point
[1:02:58] okay so there is i don't know the word
[1:03:00] in english but kelly katsur
[1:03:02] in the bible you know david ingolia
[1:03:04] goliath is like
[1:03:06] every part of the story is exaggerated
[1:03:08] right he doesn't mean to kill it with a
[1:03:10] sword like he kill it with a slingshot
[1:03:12] and he's a kid and so just you know god
[1:03:15] wants to show that he's in charge right
[1:03:18] okay so
[1:03:20] the next one is you know the man who
[1:03:22] faces the biggest trial ever
[1:03:28] joe of course you know even in the world
[1:03:30] is there this guy is poor like job okay
[1:03:32] so
[1:03:33] all right so biggest trial you know you
[1:03:36] lose
[1:03:37] everything
[1:03:38] your children
[1:03:39] and so whenever you know a christian
[1:03:41] wants to complain about you know i'm
[1:03:43] having a hard time the lord has in the
[1:03:45] bible's like come on okay get over it
[1:03:48] you know you're just your cat just died
[1:03:50] you know so it's
[1:03:52] it's gonna be all right
[1:03:54] and so
[1:03:56] you have in the bible like that stories
[1:03:58] and these are not stories this is a real
[1:04:00] event
[1:04:01] a real event but they are there you know
[1:04:04] to for us to teach a lesson so next time
[1:04:06] you go into trial go read job and then
[1:04:08] you'll have a smile because nobody
[1:04:13] will ever
[1:04:14] suffer like job did
[1:04:16] and that's talking about you know of
[1:04:18] course jesus suffered and
[1:04:20] but but a regular person losing
[1:04:23] everything
[1:04:24] and unfair fight you know david and
[1:04:26] goliath still hold the vegas you know
[1:04:30] but when we talk about someone who play
[1:04:33] with disobedience
[1:04:38] name one
[1:04:39] huh
[1:04:42] samson yeah yes matt you said i think i
[1:04:44] heard because
[1:04:45] i don't hear you much okay so samson
[1:04:49] i don't unless i don't know my bible
[1:04:51] maybe i'm missing another character but
[1:04:53] it's not important but
[1:04:54] samson is the one who played with played
[1:04:57] games with going you know just you know
[1:05:00] on the line and crossing and getting
[1:05:03] back and
[1:05:04] i'll be just fine
[1:05:08] so samson played
[1:05:10] the disobedience game
[1:05:12] and he thought he could come out and win
[1:05:16] but he lost
[1:05:18] of course only the grace of god at the
[1:05:19] end made him turn right and and glorify
[1:05:22] but if we talk on the human side he lost
[1:05:24] everything because he played with
[1:05:27] disobedience so let's stand up i want
[1:05:28] just wanted to introduce
[1:05:31] the the topic this morning and for those
[1:05:35] who were not there last night it it
[1:05:38] you didn't
[1:05:40] you won't miss anything because it's
[1:05:42] it's just the meeting last night and
[1:05:44] today will
[1:05:46] will merge together
[1:05:48] and so we talked yesterday a lot about
[1:05:51] pursuing pleasure at all costs with
[1:05:53] science called dopamine and basically
[1:05:56] you're
[1:05:57] when you seek pleasure and you look for
[1:05:59] reward and and live just a life of
[1:06:02] pleasure
[1:06:03] you are
[1:06:04] hooked to a drug called dopamine which
[1:06:07] is what your body release
[1:06:09] and this is this it's not a new drug but
[1:06:12] it's really something going on right now
[1:06:15] because they were at the end time and
[1:06:16] the bible says people would love and
[1:06:19] seek pleasure and love pleasure more
[1:06:22] than god and so pleasure in human being
[1:06:25] you know if there's a chemical reaction
[1:06:27] you know if you see a nice meal or
[1:06:30] something or you know you each a big
[1:06:32] piece of cake and and and and what the
[1:06:35] feeling you have you know it's called
[1:06:37] pleasure in the flesh which which god
[1:06:39] has us has made us you know to be happy
[1:06:41] but in in this generation people tap on
[1:06:44] pleasure all the time and and and and so
[1:06:48] it ties in with what i want to speak
[1:06:50] this morning about samson
[1:06:52] and so we're going to turn in the book
[1:06:53] of judges trump chapter 16
[1:06:56] verse 20.
[1:06:59] now i i have squeezed the three services
[1:07:02] into one
[1:07:04] so we're gonna touch you know we we
[1:07:06] won't be able to go deep in on every
[1:07:08] aspect but you can you know the holy
[1:07:11] spirit will do the rest
[1:07:13] judges chapter 16
[1:07:15] verse
[1:07:16] 20.
[1:07:20] and so this is um delilah talking
[1:07:24] you say delaila de lilla
[1:07:26] dailal
[1:07:30] forgive my french
[1:07:33] in french we say dalila
[1:07:35] so
[1:07:36] you get the point
[1:07:38] and she said
[1:07:40] the philistines be upon thee samson and
[1:07:43] he awoke out of his sleep and said i
[1:07:46] will go out as other times before and
[1:07:49] shake myself
[1:07:51] and it was not that the lord was
[1:07:53] departed from him may the lord have the
[1:07:56] blessing to reading of his word brother
[1:08:01] made it such a wonderful prayer so
[1:08:03] you can be seated you can be seated
[1:08:07] powerful prayer
[1:08:09] no need to add over it amen
[1:08:11] may the lord bless you brother it's nice
[1:08:13] to see churches coming together
[1:08:15] that pleases the lord
[1:08:17] certainly and so um
[1:08:20] i want to start with the story of
[1:08:22] simpson and then we're going to take a
[1:08:23] detour
[1:08:25] and come back to samson at the end
[1:08:27] because samson fits a certain pattern
[1:08:30] but his story doesn't fit all pattern
[1:08:33] we understand that
[1:08:35] samson was going out for pleasure
[1:08:37] looking for fun
[1:08:39] and uh and uh and and so the main point
[1:08:42] here in the story of samson you know
[1:08:44] when we read samson a story in the book
[1:08:46] of judges we think samson was dumb right
[1:08:49] come on man
[1:08:50] are you that stupid philistine's in the
[1:08:52] back room don't you understand this is
[1:08:54] you know she conspired against you
[1:08:56] you're like why are you still hanging
[1:08:58] with the girl and we think he was stupid
[1:09:00] but he was not stupid actually he was
[1:09:02] smart
[1:09:03] and he thought he could outsmart the
[1:09:06] game
[1:09:06] because he was playing games she was
[1:09:09] playing games but he thought
[1:09:12] come on what does she think she what do
[1:09:14] you think she's doing right so he
[1:09:16] thought he could outsmart it so if we go
[1:09:18] back to judges and so i got i got to
[1:09:20] really hurry up
[1:09:26] so if we go back to judges chapter 13
[1:09:29] it's it's it's it's pretty much saying
[1:09:31] you know that samson was called by god
[1:09:34] he was a man of god
[1:09:35] oftentimes we see the end of the story
[1:09:37] and we despise samson no samson was the
[1:09:40] anointed one he was called by god to
[1:09:42] deliver israel in a mighty way and he
[1:09:45] did even at his life at this end at the
[1:09:47] end of his life he did right and so
[1:09:50] verse 5 says he shall begin to deliver
[1:09:52] his israel out of the hand of the
[1:09:53] philistine and so but right away we see
[1:09:56] a pattern in samson he's a god he's
[1:09:59] dedicated to god he's
[1:10:01] a sign upon his head and his hair you
[1:10:04] know showing a sign of of of
[1:10:07] consecration and um
[1:10:10] and of course simpson always wanted to
[1:10:12] play both side of the game he wanted to
[1:10:14] be a servant of god deliver israel and
[1:10:18] also enjoy the fun of the philistine of
[1:10:22] the philistine land and the girls and
[1:10:25] the prostitute and and it's quite it's
[1:10:27] quite shocking to to to to to see that
[1:10:30] he was playing playing boatside finally
[1:10:33] playing with disobedience
[1:10:37] and and i don't have time to go through
[1:10:39] you know his life and in his his
[1:10:40] marriage where he married the wrong girl
[1:10:43] and then
[1:10:44] he was looking for he was looking to
[1:10:46] pick a fight with the philistine and he
[1:10:47] was always winning
[1:10:49] and god was anointing him for that to
[1:10:51] just you know beat the philistine down
[1:10:53] and you know get rid of them
[1:10:55] and so when we get in judges 16 verse 4
[1:10:58] and it came to pass afterward that he
[1:11:00] loved a woman in the valley of sorek
[1:11:02] whose name was delilah and the lords of
[1:11:05] the philistine came up unto her and said
[1:11:08] unto her
[1:11:09] entice
[1:11:10] him and we're in his great strength
[1:11:14] light and by what means we may prevail
[1:11:17] against him that we may find him to
[1:11:19] afflict him and we will give three give
[1:11:22] thee every one of us eleven hundred
[1:11:24] pieces of silver so
[1:11:27] the idea here and i want i want you to
[1:11:30] see yourself in this story
[1:11:33] since you're a christian
[1:11:34] the devil is is is wondering how can i
[1:11:37] bring this man or this sister down
[1:11:40] and so the first thing that satan will
[1:11:42] look is what do you does you love so
[1:11:46] he's looking for what you like
[1:11:48] he's looking for what your heart's open
[1:11:51] to
[1:11:51] and he will use that against you so we
[1:11:55] have to be careful and that's where it
[1:11:56] ties back to what we preached yesterday
[1:11:58] where we found our pleasure where we
[1:12:01] where where we are programmed to think
[1:12:03] that this is rewarding this brings
[1:12:05] satisfaction the devil will see okay he
[1:12:08] found satisfaction there so we will
[1:12:10] focus on that to bring destruction upon
[1:12:13] his life
[1:12:14] so that's that's the game plan really
[1:12:16] easy really easy
[1:12:18] easy game plan you can see it from far
[1:12:21] but you know when we get trapped anyway
[1:12:24] sometime and we need the help of god to
[1:12:26] for reference to set us free amen so the
[1:12:29] idea here is to
[1:12:31] bring samson down because his
[1:12:33] consecration makes him such a powerful
[1:12:36] man
[1:12:37] the prophet says a man can be so
[1:12:38] consecrated and so close to god that the
[1:12:40] devil doesn't know what to do with him
[1:12:42] and samson was that kind of man his
[1:12:44] consecration uh satan and the philistine
[1:12:47] didn't know what to do with the man
[1:12:51] and the prophet says you know that
[1:12:52] simpson great is a great deal like the
[1:12:55] church he started off he started off in
[1:12:57] the right direction he started off and
[1:12:59] he was called a mighty man of valor but
[1:13:01] he started out serving the lord and
[1:13:03] keeping his word and doing his
[1:13:04] commandment and that was somewhat like
[1:13:05] the church it started off on wise we
[1:13:08] would say as a world expression started
[1:13:10] on the right foot started to keep the
[1:13:12] commandments of the lord and as long as
[1:13:14] simpson followed the lord the lord used
[1:13:17] samson
[1:13:20] i got a different quote here about
[1:13:22] simpson but i will i will skip them
[1:13:24] because of a matter of time because i
[1:13:25] got a lot a lot this morning
[1:13:28] but the idea is in it it's it's like
[1:13:31] nobody nobody give his heart to the lord
[1:13:34] nobody goes and take water baptism to
[1:13:36] say you know what
[1:13:37] in five years i'll start to be negligent
[1:13:40] and i'll probably backslid in 10.
[1:13:44] but that's what happens
[1:13:46] there is that's what we were saying
[1:13:48] lately you know our church is full right
[1:13:50] now it's church is a cycle so sometimes
[1:13:52] it's full sometimes oops some people
[1:13:54] leave and then you have you're thinking
[1:13:55] about expanding and somebody some some
[1:13:57] house some people leave is okay we don't
[1:13:59] have to expand anymore and so it's it's
[1:14:02] a cycle and and and you don't get too
[1:14:05] excited when it's full and don't beat
[1:14:06] yourself when it's empty and the
[1:14:08] prophet's church split two or three
[1:14:10] times and he said you know half of them
[1:14:12] are gone and he says i got so excited
[1:14:14] because i can fill the place again
[1:14:16] that's what the prophet says
[1:14:19] and so and so you know a couple of years
[1:14:21] ago we had people leave and and people
[1:14:24] were discouraged and i started the
[1:14:25] studies the prophet's reaction to split
[1:14:28] because he had two or three
[1:14:30] and you know brother jackson left and
[1:14:32] brother um
[1:14:34] i forgot his name down the eighth street
[1:14:36] anyway just 15 minutes away and it's
[1:14:38] really close and and he was you know
[1:14:40] fellowship with them and going to preach
[1:14:42] for these brothers and he says you know
[1:14:44] may the lord bless them and and so he
[1:14:46] had he had a tremendous reaction to
[1:14:48] spend and and don't think he didn't got
[1:14:50] hurt
[1:14:50] it's it's it's not it's not it's not
[1:14:53] a party for a pastor when people walk
[1:14:55] out of your ministry
[1:14:57] but but so
[1:14:58] but the devil is using pain and hurt in
[1:15:01] the church for you to run away from
[1:15:02] church to find comfort somewhere else
[1:15:05] and so that's that's a trap so nobody
[1:15:07] nobody comes to church thinking you know
[1:15:10] what i'll get this courage and in five
[1:15:11] years i'll be out the door that's never
[1:15:13] the game plan but that's the devil's
[1:15:15] game plan and so we want to know and
[1:15:17] find out how the devil work uh to get us
[1:15:20] in on that path amen
[1:15:24] so the game starts you know he's playing
[1:15:26] with delilah and and and and and
[1:15:29] obviously you know we think uh we think
[1:15:32] samson is dumb uh but he thought he was
[1:15:35] smart
[1:15:36] and so we always you know oftentimes
[1:15:38] when we study you know on the surface
[1:15:40] that story we kind of think you know why
[1:15:42] did samson didn't realize you know she
[1:15:44] was lying to him
[1:15:46] he knew it
[1:15:48] but i guess he liked delilah so much
[1:15:50] probably such a beautiful girl and fun
[1:15:52] to be with and probably party and you
[1:15:54] know
[1:15:55] all the rest and so he was so
[1:15:59] possessed and so attracted by that girl
[1:16:02] that he was he said you know i'll i'll
[1:16:04] take the downside and and i'll i'll i'll
[1:16:06] outsmart her you know
[1:16:09] and so the first thing she tries on him
[1:16:11] verse six and delilah said to science
[1:16:13] simpson tell me i pray thee wherein thy
[1:16:16] great strength lieth and wherewith thou
[1:16:19] mightest be bound to afflict thee and
[1:16:21] simpson said unto her if they bind me
[1:16:23] with seven green with that were never
[1:16:25] dried then i shall be weak and be as
[1:16:29] another men
[1:16:30] and so like
[1:16:31] if you're smart you realize okay she's
[1:16:34] trying to find why i'm strong
[1:16:36] and she's good friends with prince the
[1:16:38] prince and the soldiers over there so
[1:16:41] yeah i know what they want to do they
[1:16:43] think they can beat me up right
[1:16:47] well time me with seven green cords you
[1:16:49] know yeah and he's probably laughing
[1:16:51] he's like she's so stupid right
[1:16:55] then the lawrence of the phillies team
[1:16:57] brought up her seven green with that
[1:16:59] which had not been dried and she found
[1:17:01] him with them like she's playing i will
[1:17:03] tie you with them yeah of course you
[1:17:05] know
[1:17:06] have fun
[1:17:07] she's so stupid you know
[1:17:10] she think i'm gonna backslid and go back
[1:17:12] to my whole life come on
[1:17:14] never god freed me from that right but
[1:17:17] you're on the satan ground playing games
[1:17:19] right
[1:17:21] and so now there were men lying in
[1:17:23] weight abiding with her in the chamber
[1:17:27] and she said unto him the philistine be
[1:17:29] upon thee samson
[1:17:31] and he break the width and the thread of
[1:17:33] tao is broken when it it touches the
[1:17:35] fire so his strength was not his
[1:17:37] strength strengths was not known and so
[1:17:40] the idea he's in the living room and
[1:17:42] he's all tied up with those you know
[1:17:43] little
[1:17:44] ropes and then she yell you know samson
[1:17:46] oh
[1:17:47] the philistine are here
[1:17:50] they're in the back room right
[1:17:53] so we think samson you're stupid leave
[1:17:55] the place you know they're going to trap
[1:17:56] you he saw the philistine he understood
[1:17:59] okay delilah called them they're trying
[1:18:01] like okay i see it and so he beats you
[1:18:04] know he knocked this philistine soldier
[1:18:06] probably they're dead or anyway you know
[1:18:08] they went to the emergency room
[1:18:11] and you know what he's like
[1:18:14] you know
[1:18:17] business as usual
[1:18:20] [Laughter]
[1:18:22] he's having fun
[1:18:24] for him you know just beating the
[1:18:25] philistine is just having fun
[1:18:28] and he says why not you know
[1:18:30] i have fun doing that i have fun with
[1:18:32] her
[1:18:33] you know
[1:18:35] but that was disobedience because god
[1:18:37] told him the word of god was clear don't
[1:18:40] go in that ground on that ground
[1:18:44] even one night he was within before
[1:18:46] delilah he was with a prostitute late at
[1:18:48] night they locked the city
[1:18:51] so we're gonna trap him so he's he's he
[1:18:54] lives in sin
[1:18:56] but he get out of the he get out of the
[1:18:58] house he saw oh
[1:19:02] they locked the city oh poor me
[1:19:04] what what i'm gonna do i'm trapping the
[1:19:06] city
[1:19:08] takes the door you know big city doors
[1:19:10] like wall thick wall
[1:19:13] it
[1:19:14] takes to the door out and
[1:19:17] put the door on top of the mountain
[1:19:21] it's like
[1:19:22] you guys try to bring it down and
[1:19:24] install it again
[1:19:25] they probably needed 10 guys 20 guys to
[1:19:28] bring the door back
[1:19:30] like he's having so much fun
[1:19:34] he's having so much fun because he's go
[1:19:36] to church and that's a season where when
[1:19:39] christians start compromise
[1:19:42] they do stuff that's against the word
[1:19:44] and they go to church and they're still
[1:19:46] blessed
[1:19:47] and they're like wow man i'm getting the
[1:19:50] best of both sides i'm having pleasure
[1:19:53] you know on on the wrong arena and and
[1:19:56] you know watching this and doing that
[1:19:58] and hanging with those and then i go to
[1:20:00] church and bless and i feel the presence
[1:20:02] of god i still feel the power of god i'm
[1:20:05] still leading the song as god is with me
[1:20:08] and wow
[1:20:10] that's a great deal
[1:20:13] but what people don't realize is that is
[1:20:15] a short season
[1:20:19] so she moves to the next trick right
[1:20:22] delilah said unto samson behold that has
[1:20:24] mocked me and told me lies or who's
[1:20:27] lying
[1:20:29] delilah's lying but now she's accusing
[1:20:32] him of lying you know
[1:20:33] talk about mind games now tell me i
[1:20:36] prayed he wherewith thou mightest be
[1:20:37] bound and he said unto her if they bind
[1:20:40] me fast with new ropes that never were
[1:20:43] occupied they shall i
[1:20:45] then shall i be weak and be as another
[1:20:47] man delilah therefore took new ropes and
[1:20:50] bound him there with and said unto him
[1:20:52] the philistine be upon thee simpson and
[1:20:54] there will are again in the back room
[1:20:56] she ties him and you know okay so he's
[1:20:59] like wow okay we're still in that
[1:21:01] department
[1:21:03] and so for him it's all fun so we looks
[1:21:05] we moved to the next stage right and now
[1:21:07] he says but now he's getting close
[1:21:09] because before it was just you know tiny
[1:21:11] with ropes and this kind of ropes and
[1:21:13] that kind of ropes but no he says tie
[1:21:17] time my seven
[1:21:18] what do you call that seven locks tie
[1:21:21] them together
[1:21:23] so he
[1:21:25] the the you know the enemy is is is is
[1:21:28] is you you call it zero in right you you
[1:21:31] you're he's closing on you
[1:21:33] but he doesn't realize
[1:21:35] and on top of zeroing on you and getting
[1:21:38] close to get you
[1:21:40] this time
[1:21:42] he falls asleep
[1:21:44] and so we're in the third you know third
[1:21:47] the third attempt
[1:21:49] and
[1:21:50] where's my mouse
[1:21:52] okay it's here
[1:21:54] okay
[1:21:56] he's now he's sleeping
[1:21:58] the first two attempts what awake he
[1:22:00] sees the game now he fell asleep
[1:22:03] something's going on
[1:22:05] he's getting he's less sharps his
[1:22:07] spiritual senses are are getting dull
[1:22:10] they're getting they're getting down
[1:22:12] he's not sharp anymore and he doesn't
[1:22:14] see it
[1:22:16] because he's blind by pleasure he's
[1:22:18] blind by dopamine he's blind but by that
[1:22:21] release and he gets satisfaction and
[1:22:23] while he's while he's playing and while
[1:22:25] he's going for pleasure while he's going
[1:22:27] for this easy life
[1:22:30] all pleasure and all satisfaction
[1:22:32] something changed inside of him
[1:22:34] something changed in his mind his
[1:22:36] spiritual discernment is going down he's
[1:22:38] falling asleep and he's getting really
[1:22:41] close of the real secret he's getting
[1:22:44] close to get to give away his real
[1:22:46] consecration
[1:22:50] then she moves in
[1:22:53] and i call that she he started to be
[1:22:56] annoyed to death that's the tactic
[1:22:59] she went after him
[1:23:02] in verse 15 she said unto him how can
[1:23:05] thou say i love thee
[1:23:07] when thy heart
[1:23:10] is not with me now she wants his heart
[1:23:14] thou hast mocked me these three times
[1:23:16] and has not told me wherein thy great
[1:23:19] strength length lieth
[1:23:21] but who's mocking who
[1:23:23] i'm like you know if i'm sensing i'm
[1:23:25] like who's mocking who
[1:23:27] why when you tie me the the
[1:23:30] the philistine are in the garage right
[1:23:32] who's mocking who who's loving who right
[1:23:35] you know but
[1:23:36] he's playing games he's not stupid
[1:23:39] you think he can
[1:23:41] outsmart the whole thing and it came to
[1:23:42] pass when she pressed him daily
[1:23:45] with her words
[1:23:47] and urge him
[1:23:49] so that his soul was vexed
[1:23:52] unto death
[1:23:58] there is a scripture talking about the
[1:24:00] fourth beast in the book of daniel that
[1:24:02] at the end time the fourth beast
[1:24:04] will
[1:24:05] wear out the saints
[1:24:08] wear out the saints
[1:24:11] it's a mind battle the greatest battle
[1:24:13] ever fought and and the devil will annoy
[1:24:16] you and vex you and annoy you and keep
[1:24:19] repeating and go after you all the time
[1:24:22] all the time all the time for you until
[1:24:24] you just like
[1:24:26] i just can't stand it anymore
[1:24:28] it's like you know just can't stand
[1:24:30] anymore
[1:24:32] it will he will try to burn you down he
[1:24:34] will try to wear you out and you what
[1:24:36] you know what he will he will succeed in
[1:24:39] worrying you down
[1:24:42] you'll become tired in your mind tired
[1:24:44] everywhere
[1:24:46] and you're just looking for a little
[1:24:47] relief just a little satisfaction it's
[1:24:49] just can i get just like 30 second of
[1:24:51] happiness in this life
[1:24:54] can i can i have like a 30 second where
[1:24:56] i can feel like i i will smile and the
[1:24:58] devil is like yeah come on my ground
[1:25:00] there's a lot of joy here right there's
[1:25:02] a lot of you like you know i got a lot
[1:25:04] of devices come on come on right
[1:25:09] and so finally
[1:25:13] he spilled it out
[1:25:17] and that's where we see that's where we
[1:25:19] understand in verse 20
[1:25:21] that he was not duped
[1:25:24] he was not
[1:25:25] deceived
[1:25:28] he thought he was stronger than the trap
[1:25:32] he walked in the trap not deceived
[1:25:36] because he says i will it's not like oh
[1:25:39] what's happening to me
[1:25:42] that's not his reaction
[1:25:44] his reaction is like this trap i'm gonna
[1:25:46] get i'm gonna break the trap so he knows
[1:25:49] he's a trap
[1:25:50] but but dopamine is there
[1:25:53] it's like people doing stuff you know
[1:25:54] that
[1:25:55] and you know it can hurt you
[1:25:58] you know you you
[1:26:00] you um
[1:26:02] you take you know the netflix and i'm
[1:26:04] gonna filter it you take this and you
[1:26:06] take that you take that and you're like
[1:26:08] yeah i know it can be a trap no i know i
[1:26:10] know i know you know sometimes
[1:26:12] christians they just i don't know i know
[1:26:14] it can be a trap but
[1:26:15] i'll i'll manage
[1:26:17] that's playing with disobedience that's
[1:26:20] what sense and thought you know i love
[1:26:22] the lord and lord god knows my heart i
[1:26:24] would never return to that
[1:26:27] uh no no no lord knows my heart never
[1:26:29] never i'd never returned to that i i i
[1:26:31] will manage
[1:26:33] samson thought he'd manage
[1:26:35] and he did for a while and so he like
[1:26:37] you know i told you
[1:26:39] it gave me a new opportunity i witnessed
[1:26:41] i witnessed to those philistines
[1:26:45] right
[1:26:46] i'm doing my ministry
[1:26:48] god called me to beat the philistine i
[1:26:49] just knocked 20 of them right last
[1:26:51] yesterday you know
[1:26:52] where was that well you know i was in
[1:26:54] delilah's house but you know the lord
[1:26:56] used me there so you know it's lord
[1:26:58] knows lord lord knows everything you
[1:27:00] know lord knows everything you
[1:27:02] know i was sitting at the bar with the
[1:27:05] boys i just drink a coke i just drink a
[1:27:07] coke but you know what i was able to
[1:27:09] talk about jesus
[1:27:10] well right yeah and and i don't say the
[1:27:13] lord would not send you there once but
[1:27:15] you know if you hang there all the time
[1:27:16] you might might get in trouble you know
[1:27:19] and so this this is how it works right
[1:27:24] now let's switch the service we're going
[1:27:26] to take a side road and go in a
[1:27:27] different direction and come back to
[1:27:29] samsung
[1:27:31] and you know
[1:27:32] again you know he was uh before we move
[1:27:35] uh he was sleeping
[1:27:39] and he wake up
[1:27:40] and his
[1:27:41] his
[1:27:43] head is shaving now
[1:27:45] when when when he said
[1:27:48] shave my head
[1:27:52] he knew she would do it
[1:27:54] so maybe he said
[1:27:55] okay now i told her better watch out
[1:27:57] because she's gonna try so i won't fall
[1:27:59] asleep
[1:28:01] i'm gonna make sure she falls asleep and
[1:28:03] then i sleep but i'm gonna you know
[1:28:06] always because now she knows so it's a
[1:28:08] little bit dangerous
[1:28:11] but his discernment's down his senses
[1:28:13] are down and so finally falls asleep and
[1:28:16] she tricks him and his head is shaven
[1:28:18] then what they do first thing right
[1:28:21] pluck his eyes
[1:28:24] now he's blind
[1:28:26] now he's totally blind
[1:28:29] and on a spiritual level now you go see
[1:28:30] the brother and he's like yeah
[1:28:32] no i know it's wrong but you know what
[1:28:34] it is what it is you know i tried you
[1:28:36] know i gave i gave to church you know i
[1:28:38] gave the lord a test you know i get i
[1:28:39] give i gave it a run you know you know
[1:28:42] it was good for a while i'll be honest
[1:28:43] yeah i enjoy the word and lord good
[1:28:45] great thing for me but you know now it's
[1:28:47] just like it's not like it was before
[1:28:50] a lot of people there when they have one
[1:28:52] foot outside the church that's that's
[1:28:54] what they're saying yeah i know it's i i
[1:28:55] cannot deny you know god's been good and
[1:28:57] there's been a season in my life this
[1:28:59] was all great but you know it's it's
[1:29:00] just i don't feel anymore it's it's gone
[1:29:03] and and and they cannot explain
[1:29:06] how they went there
[1:29:08] but it's one decision after the other
[1:29:11] and okay samson was after pleasure but
[1:29:13] now i want to touch another area
[1:29:16] because like i said before it's not like
[1:29:18] someone's going to say you know well
[1:29:21] you know five years down the road i'll
[1:29:22] start compromise and i'll walk out the
[1:29:24] door
[1:29:25] that's not how it works right
[1:29:27] so i want to talk about another aspect
[1:29:30] with
[1:29:31] in the book of matthew 22 37 38 so jesus
[1:29:34] says unto him thou shalt love the lord
[1:29:37] thy god with all thy heart
[1:29:40] and with all thy soul and with all thy
[1:29:43] mind that's that's a lot of all right
[1:29:46] yeah
[1:29:47] and all
[1:29:48] your heart you know
[1:29:50] why did he just say love the lord with
[1:29:52] your heart
[1:29:55] so love the lord with your heart is not
[1:29:57] enough
[1:29:58] it has to be
[1:29:59] all your heart so this is kind
[1:30:02] it implies
[1:30:04] that you could be double-minded
[1:30:07] you could love the lord from your heart
[1:30:09] but keep something
[1:30:11] for yourself
[1:30:14] and this is the first commandment all
[1:30:16] the heart all your soul
[1:30:19] all your mind it means you can be split
[1:30:24] and that's where we talk about
[1:30:27] compartmentalizing so
[1:30:31] where
[1:30:32] you your heart is divided
[1:30:40] and you basically live a life of
[1:30:43] contradiction
[1:30:46] samson
[1:30:47] had a life
[1:30:49] of contradiction
[1:30:51] he's israelite he's a prophet he's a
[1:30:54] he's a he's a judge in israel he's a
[1:30:57] mighty man he's anointed by god
[1:31:00] but he marries a philistine
[1:31:02] contradiction
[1:31:04] and the holy spirit's job is to expose
[1:31:08] in our life those contradiction
[1:31:11] you say you love the lord but you do
[1:31:13] this you say you love the lord you say
[1:31:15] you're consecrated but you you you do
[1:31:18] this you talk like that you walk like
[1:31:19] that it's like there's two person
[1:31:26] and usually those contradiction
[1:31:29] and that's the holy spirit's job that's
[1:31:32] what the bible says the word of god is
[1:31:34] sharper like a two-headed sword
[1:31:37] it will discern the thoughts of the
[1:31:40] heart
[1:31:40] and the intention
[1:31:44] it will discern and expose you're saying
[1:31:47] that but you're doing this
[1:31:49] and i'm talking about not
[1:31:51] i'm talking about sincere christian
[1:31:54] because sometimes we go that route and
[1:31:56] we don't ever we don't even realize that
[1:31:58] we become double-minded and our life is
[1:32:00] a contradiction
[1:32:05] let's look at the the meaning of of
[1:32:07] integrity
[1:32:09] uh the number two there up there is from
[1:32:12] webster's dictionary the entire so
[1:32:14] integrity
[1:32:16] it means
[1:32:17] the entire
[1:32:19] unimpaired state of anything
[1:32:22] particularly of the mind
[1:32:24] moral science soundness or purity
[1:32:26] incorruptness uprightness honesty
[1:32:28] integrity
[1:32:30] comprehend the whole moral character but
[1:32:33] has a special reference to uprightness
[1:32:35] in mutual dealing transfer of property
[1:32:37] and agency or others
[1:32:40] the second and third is from other uh um
[1:32:43] dictionaries integrity means
[1:32:46] complete
[1:32:49] like like if i give you something and i
[1:32:51] says
[1:32:52] in french we say there's integrity and
[1:32:55] then there's another word says integr
[1:32:57] integrity means it's the state of the
[1:32:59] thing so if if let's say this pulpit is
[1:33:03] uh from
[1:33:04] you know
[1:33:05] years years years back when this church
[1:33:07] was built right
[1:33:08] and if you didn't change it
[1:33:11] if you didn't of course it was changed
[1:33:13] because i'm sure they didn't have the
[1:33:14] cloud
[1:33:15] i'm sure they didn't have that years
[1:33:16] back right this is this is something you
[1:33:19] know
[1:33:20] for the bride
[1:33:22] but let's say this pulpit was not
[1:33:24] changed
[1:33:25] we would say we would say the pulpit
[1:33:29] has integrity
[1:33:31] nothing has been moved
[1:33:33] nothing has been changed it has its
[1:33:36] original
[1:33:37] okay so integrity it means
[1:33:41] complete
[1:33:43] whole
[1:33:44] to think and act with integrity we must
[1:33:46] encompass and integrate all dimensions
[1:33:49] and reason of our complex world
[1:33:53] in psychology the opposite of integrity
[1:33:56] is compartmentalized the person
[1:34:00] to be able to be happy with a simplistic
[1:34:02] thinking is content to compartmentalize
[1:34:05] his life so as not to feel the pain
[1:34:08] caused by the shock of contradictions
[1:34:12] and complexities
[1:34:15] so
[1:34:16] you create
[1:34:18] compartment
[1:34:20] and i i i view so the reason why you
[1:34:24] need
[1:34:26] compartment
[1:34:28] is to separate things of a different
[1:34:30] nature
[1:34:33] you want to separate things that are of
[1:34:35] a different nature so when your heart is
[1:34:39] compartmentalized like that
[1:34:41] it's because something doesn't go with
[1:34:44] the other thing
[1:34:45] so you need a separation
[1:34:50] in your heart
[1:34:51] now some some people might say i don't
[1:34:53] believe that i gave my whole heart to
[1:34:55] jesus
[1:34:56] and and there's no separation in my
[1:34:58] heart i'm i'm one and total well the
[1:35:01] prophet preached a message called
[1:35:04] doors in door
[1:35:07] there's many doors
[1:35:09] once and we're going to read those
[1:35:11] quotes
[1:35:12] quickly okay but it's just in case i
[1:35:14] lose you just in case i lose you before
[1:35:16] we reach there
[1:35:18] let me give you an example how that
[1:35:20] works
[1:35:21] a man who watches pornography at work
[1:35:23] and covets woman
[1:35:25] and who comes home in the evening and
[1:35:27] kisses his wife without the slightest
[1:35:29] remorse
[1:35:31] this person has no integrity
[1:35:34] she is in or he is it's google
[1:35:37] translates you got to be
[1:35:38] he is in a biblical language a hypocrite
[1:35:42] but to do this the person has to
[1:35:44] compartmentalize his life to make sure
[1:35:47] that these two contradictions
[1:35:49] do not clash
[1:35:52] how many people criticize others for
[1:35:54] things they do themselves they are not
[1:35:56] honest but hypocrites often people are
[1:35:59] without realizing it because they have
[1:36:01] compartmentalized their lives for a long
[1:36:03] time their hypocrisy is now a way of
[1:36:06] life
[1:36:07] if they are sincere they will cry out to
[1:36:09] god if they are confronted and exposed
[1:36:12] to their own
[1:36:13] games
[1:36:16] to live in compromise in contradiction
[1:36:18] the human needs to come from a
[1:36:20] comparative oh that's a difficult word
[1:36:23] compartmentalize his life
[1:36:25] and cut it and cut any emotional link
[1:36:28] between the two compartments
[1:36:31] thus he will not be able to feel the
[1:36:33] pain and discomfort of such monstrosity
[1:36:37] and such a lie he's comfortable
[1:36:40] lifestyle but not honest
[1:36:43] to think and act with integrity you have
[1:36:45] to think twice did i omit anything do i
[1:36:49] voluntarily leave something aside to
[1:36:51] make things simplified to make it seems
[1:36:54] beautiful and straight i voluntarily
[1:36:56] leave a lot of things aside
[1:37:00] so your heart turns into something like
[1:37:03] that you know
[1:37:05] and so everything that's acceptable to
[1:37:08] god you know we're talking about
[1:37:10] christian wise you know
[1:37:12] everything that that's acceptable
[1:37:14] acceptable to god is in that box right
[1:37:17] you know i go to church and i'm married
[1:37:19] and i got wonderful children you know i
[1:37:21] get up in the morning i take a coffee i
[1:37:23] i eat breakfast i go to work you know
[1:37:25] this is this is this all fits in that
[1:37:27] one box you know you're a unified person
[1:37:30] it all makes sense right
[1:37:32] but then you know when you open internet
[1:37:36] you might have in your heart you know
[1:37:38] another box where you start doing things
[1:37:41] here
[1:37:42] that are not compatible
[1:37:45] with that
[1:37:46] and
[1:37:48] you do it of course if you do this while
[1:37:51] you're in this box you'll feel guilty
[1:37:54] you'll become so nervous anxious i'm
[1:37:57] wrong i'm wrong i'm wrong you'll stop
[1:38:01] but if you feel the urge in so much and
[1:38:04] and and now there's reason why people
[1:38:06] create compartment in their life
[1:38:09] and you know and another thing you know
[1:38:10] those two box should they never meet
[1:38:13] they never touch and there's no
[1:38:15] emotional link between those two box
[1:38:18] because if there's emotional link
[1:38:20] between the two you'll feel the guilt
[1:38:24] of what you're doing
[1:38:28] taking
[1:38:29] let's take an extreme example
[1:38:31] a man cheat
[1:38:33] his wife he has this girl on the side
[1:38:36] you know so he goes sees her when the
[1:38:38] wife's busy whatever you know he finds a
[1:38:40] way but one day he's with his wife and
[1:38:42] family and meet his mistress you know
[1:38:46] at the the supermarket
[1:38:50] now that's a brutal that's extreme
[1:38:52] violent moment inside of himself because
[1:38:55] suddenly the two box meets and they
[1:38:58] touch
[1:38:59] and now he has emotion for this and
[1:39:01] emotion and
[1:39:02] they are so not compatible
[1:39:06] that he just walks out the store and
[1:39:08] runs to hide because he cannot handle
[1:39:10] the moment where his two boxes meet
[1:39:16] or you have a teenager right he has
[1:39:18] he's part of the youth group you know
[1:39:20] and he's all hallelujah with the youth
[1:39:22] group but when when he's out there you
[1:39:24] know he smoked with them and and and
[1:39:26] drink beers with them and and so it's in
[1:39:29] but when he's the youth he's all happy
[1:39:31] he's all hallelujah he's really involved
[1:39:33] because those are two separate entities
[1:39:37] and and and and and but but but one day
[1:39:39] he's hanging out with his friends you
[1:39:42] know he's at the park drinking beer and
[1:39:43] suddenly the youth group comes in the
[1:39:45] park
[1:39:47] and
[1:39:48] that's that's a brutal moment
[1:39:52] when you come back to ohio to the home
[1:39:54] you love your wife you love your
[1:39:56] children you love to be at home and then
[1:39:57] you know everybody falls asleep and
[1:39:59] you're working in a computer something
[1:40:00] pops up you know and a lady that's you
[1:40:02] click and suddenly you find yourself in
[1:40:04] in on a pornography website and suddenly
[1:40:07] your wife just opened the door and says
[1:40:08] honey you don't come to sleep and then
[1:40:10] she sees the screen
[1:40:15] and that that's extremely violent moment
[1:40:17] internally because like
[1:40:20] no no it's not what you think
[1:40:22] oh i think it's what i think
[1:40:25] okay
[1:40:27] so how can someone
[1:40:31] how can a christian because we're
[1:40:32] talking about christians
[1:40:34] how can they end up doing stuff like
[1:40:35] that
[1:40:36] you know of course in the bible language
[1:40:38] we call that hypocrite
[1:40:41] and nobody wants to be called a
[1:40:42] hypocrite
[1:40:45] and now here it's not to justify why we
[1:40:48] do that
[1:40:51] but it's it's it's uh it's related we
[1:40:53] spoke yesterday on dopamine
[1:40:56] and
[1:40:56] to become
[1:40:58] so the idea of satan is to okay let's
[1:41:01] say you're a christian you're in church
[1:41:03] i don't know the reason why samson you
[1:41:05] know you'd think samson you know just
[1:41:07] wanted pleasure
[1:41:09] at all costs
[1:41:10] and we don't know underneath why he was
[1:41:12] doing that
[1:41:13] okay
[1:41:14] but i've seen you know being a pastor
[1:41:16] you're with people you you and i go to
[1:41:18] my own experience anyway
[1:41:21] i realized that
[1:41:24] christians doesn't sin usually
[1:41:27] to sin
[1:41:28] they don't disobey
[1:41:30] to disobey
[1:41:32] most of the time
[1:41:34] they end up there
[1:41:35] through a complicated series of event
[1:41:39] and they end up
[1:41:41] being living a disobedient life to the
[1:41:44] lord
[1:41:46] and they can't help it
[1:41:48] they're trapped
[1:41:50] and they know it's wrong
[1:41:52] and they try to manage both sides like
[1:41:55] okay
[1:41:56] i have to feel better i have to i have
[1:41:58] to you know i have to shake myself i
[1:42:00] have to
[1:42:01] come back and i i know i'm on a side
[1:42:02] road right now i know i'm on the wrong
[1:42:04] road and i you know i'll catch my breath
[1:42:06] you know
[1:42:07] and
[1:42:08] one of the main thing in
[1:42:10] that i've seen
[1:42:12] is
[1:42:13] satan will cause hurt
[1:42:16] and pain
[1:42:18] inside the church
[1:42:20] or inside the marriage or inside the
[1:42:23] family or inside the family of god
[1:42:28] and i'm we're not talking about a little
[1:42:30] pain we're talking about nuclear bomb
[1:42:33] pain
[1:42:35] not talking about you know somebody said
[1:42:36] something against you and then you just
[1:42:38] started drinking no
[1:42:40] no if it's that you know your experience
[1:42:43] is shallow it's it's it's it's not no no
[1:42:45] no
[1:42:46] i've seen as a pastor i've witnessed
[1:42:48] people go through and i even went
[1:42:50] through some
[1:42:51] you know
[1:42:53] extremely brutal
[1:42:55] time
[1:42:56] you know
[1:42:58] where at one point
[1:43:01] the devil basically what he wants to do
[1:43:04] is this box you lie you have
[1:43:07] for the lord you know and everything
[1:43:08] inside of it
[1:43:10] that the lord is asking you to be a
[1:43:12] husband he's asking you to be a wife
[1:43:14] he's asking you to be in church and
[1:43:16] worship with he's asking you to be with
[1:43:18] saints he's asking you like that's all
[1:43:20] the lord is asking you what's the devil
[1:43:22] is trying to do is to poison that box to
[1:43:24] such a level
[1:43:26] that it's unbearable
[1:43:29] you cannot stay in that box
[1:43:32] one minute longer you have to it's like
[1:43:34] we call it the fight or flight mode it's
[1:43:37] like you run for your life it's like
[1:43:42] so you come to church
[1:43:44] but not in that box
[1:43:46] you're somewhere else inside of you you
[1:43:49] created another box
[1:43:52] and when we become dual like this that's
[1:43:55] the day we start the route of being a
[1:43:57] hypocrite and not being sincere anymore
[1:44:00] and it's not like okay i'm coming to
[1:44:02] church today and i won't be
[1:44:04] sincere that's not how it happens
[1:44:08] that's not happens it's just that you
[1:44:10] cannot cope with pain anymore
[1:44:13] and
[1:44:14] on top of that
[1:44:16] you don't know how to release it you
[1:44:18] don't know how to give it to god so
[1:44:20] you're trapped into and you're in front
[1:44:23] of us such a wonderful lord a comforter
[1:44:26] but you don't find comfort in him
[1:44:27] anymore
[1:44:29] because chris the children of the
[1:44:32] comforter has destroyed you
[1:44:38] or a man should find comfort in his wife
[1:44:41] talking with her having fellowship it's
[1:44:44] our marriage should should be such a
[1:44:46] safe place where we just lay down our
[1:44:48] guard and open our heart and and feel so
[1:44:51] good
[1:44:53] but it's our marriage is not always like
[1:44:55] that there are seasons where there's
[1:44:57] misunderstanding and our guards is up
[1:45:00] and so suddenly our marriage become you
[1:45:02] know two entity
[1:45:04] two hearts that's totally close
[1:45:07] and that's where you become vulnerable
[1:45:09] to something else
[1:45:11] something else can attract you
[1:45:13] it becomes it can be a trap that is why
[1:45:15] there is so much emphasis in the bible
[1:45:18] about forgiveness
[1:45:21] a christian life without an ounce of
[1:45:22] forgiveness you'll wreck
[1:45:25] pretty soon because you will have to
[1:45:28] live in another world
[1:45:32] and in that box you say well you know
[1:45:34] and then you have this christian
[1:45:35] language like you know no no i have
[1:45:36] nothing against them
[1:45:39] but you don't want to see them anymore
[1:45:41] and i don't know you know i have nothing
[1:45:42] against them but you know you you live
[1:45:44] of course you lived in this separate box
[1:45:47] at church when i preached that that that
[1:45:49] box thing compartmentalized subject was
[1:45:51] just that that was a sermon by itself
[1:45:53] and i and i just used and i don't have
[1:45:55] time this morning but i wouldn't choose
[1:45:57] the standing in the gap message
[1:45:59] the prophet says i'm scarred
[1:46:02] i i went to many battle i'm hurt i'm
[1:46:04] hurt i'm in pain and i want to live in
[1:46:06] the mountains
[1:46:08] and the lord says yeah you want to you
[1:46:09] know so he created a box called i'll be
[1:46:12] like elijah in the mountain
[1:46:14] and i don't have to mess up with pastors
[1:46:16] and churches and because he's been so
[1:46:17] much hurt that he he
[1:46:20] and that's what christians do sometimes
[1:46:22] when they are hurt and have complex
[1:46:23] they'll christianize their complex
[1:46:27] you know a lot of people who believe in
[1:46:29] in in listening at tapes at home
[1:46:32] they they christianize
[1:46:35] their pain
[1:46:36] and if you study their life you realize
[1:46:38] they've been hurt in that church hurt in
[1:46:39] that church and so they're just
[1:46:41] basically running from churches to
[1:46:43] churches until they create a doctrine so
[1:46:45] they can be at home with themselves
[1:46:47] because and you know what the pat the
[1:46:49] prophet went through that i don't have
[1:46:51] time but a prophet gave us a vision of
[1:46:52] fletcher and how he would turn into a
[1:46:55] bomb his wife would leave him and and he
[1:46:57] says i i you have a special call you
[1:47:00] have to be in the middle of churches you
[1:47:02] have to but he couldn't stand anymore
[1:47:05] he had no more feeling for the people he
[1:47:07] didn't want to deal with them anymore he
[1:47:09] didn't have any compassion for them
[1:47:10] because of what because the prophet was
[1:47:13] not sincere no because he was too
[1:47:16] hurt
[1:47:18] he says lord needs to heal my heart he
[1:47:20] needs to change my heart so i view the
[1:47:22] people of god again with a smile and not
[1:47:24] like this because he's been betrayed
[1:47:27] he's been
[1:47:29] he's been
[1:47:30] true so i don't have time to talk about
[1:47:31] that but it's it's it's that's what
[1:47:34] prophet went through so if a prophet
[1:47:36] went through that because the bible says
[1:47:37] elijah was are the same nature of
[1:47:40] their human being
[1:47:44] and so
[1:47:45] and a special message about that and i
[1:47:47] don't have time to go through it but is
[1:47:50] the message he cares do you care
[1:47:52] what a prophet is trying about he's
[1:47:54] talking about
[1:47:55] trying to find comfort
[1:47:58] and he says you know they try to draw
[1:48:00] comfort from some other
[1:48:03] resource resources
[1:48:05] let's speak first of the soul you know
[1:48:06] we found out many people try to find
[1:48:08] comfort by drinking you know
[1:48:10] so it's linked to yesterday the dopamine
[1:48:12] is comfort you you're looking for
[1:48:13] comfort you're looking for a release of
[1:48:15] well-being okay and that's where you
[1:48:17] find you fall in traps of all the the
[1:48:21] the dopamine release device
[1:48:23] you know we have a saying which is
[1:48:25] pretty well known among us today that
[1:48:26] many ministers drink sometime before
[1:48:28] going to the pulpit take a good heavy
[1:48:30] drink of inter intoxication it's been
[1:48:32] known to seeing ministers on the
[1:48:34] platform that even stagger under the
[1:48:35] influence of liquor that ought not to be
[1:48:37] it should not be because many times we
[1:48:40] might condemn the men when we may uh not
[1:48:43] to
[1:48:44] we ought to find back what back what's
[1:48:47] the trouble
[1:48:49] so he's drinking why because he's in
[1:48:51] desperation
[1:48:54] he's hurt and that's big mistake church
[1:48:57] has made for a long time is to condemn
[1:49:00] the behavior of the people and not ask
[1:49:02] the question what brought you there
[1:49:04] sometimes it's a big stumbling block you
[1:49:06] remove the stone the person just you
[1:49:08] know the person just falls back in his
[1:49:11] original position
[1:49:13] because basically what satan wants to do
[1:49:15] is detonate a nuclear bomb there so you
[1:49:16] have to move there and then you're in
[1:49:18] the wrong position
[1:49:19] and and this is just rune land
[1:49:22] it's radioactive it's hyper dangerous
[1:49:25] you don't want to be there anymore so
[1:49:26] you have to stand there and when you
[1:49:28] stand there that's where the devil is at
[1:49:30] at you
[1:49:31] so the lord wants to bring healing
[1:49:35] but we have to go to the lord for
[1:49:36] healing
[1:49:38] we have to acknowledge lord this is just
[1:49:40] happening and i'm hurt i'm hurt at such
[1:49:42] a point i want to run away but i know
[1:49:44] it's not your will for me to run away
[1:49:46] can you heal my heart can you take that
[1:49:48] load can you repair me lord i'm broken
[1:49:51] can you fix me
[1:49:55] but oftentimes we don't do that prayer
[1:49:57] we just what we call cope
[1:50:00] and cope with pain doesn't work because
[1:50:03] cope with pain will make you
[1:50:05] react and so a lot of christian they you
[1:50:07] know they have a couple of good years
[1:50:09] and then after that you know scandals
[1:50:10] and
[1:50:11] stuff happen and they get hurt and they
[1:50:13] get hurt and get hurt and the rest of
[1:50:15] their christian life they're just
[1:50:16] reacting
[1:50:19] compensating for something to happen
[1:50:20] five years ago
[1:50:22] i mean people like that you know you
[1:50:23] talk to them and they're still talking
[1:50:24] about that pastor 20 years ago i can't
[1:50:26] believe he did that i can't believe he
[1:50:27] did that like you're 20 years down the
[1:50:29] road and are still reacting to that it's
[1:50:31] like come on this is 20 years old but
[1:50:33] for them indus in their heart it's today
[1:50:36] the pain is still there it's still
[1:50:37] active and they're still reacting to
[1:50:38] that and now they're reacting to all the
[1:50:41] pastors that talks because it's for them
[1:50:43] it's the it's the box called pastors and
[1:50:45] they're all bad
[1:50:50] that topic this morning ramification in
[1:50:52] all kind of direction
[1:50:57] so
[1:50:58] a lot of christian on the side of the
[1:50:59] road even in in the message uh i think
[1:51:01] it's imitate impersonation of
[1:51:03] christianity i'm not sure
[1:51:05] or um the greatest battle they ever
[1:51:07] fought i think the prophet says you got
[1:51:08] a lot of christian on the side of the
[1:51:09] road
[1:51:11] um
[1:51:12] in the ditch
[1:51:13] and he says the reason why is because
[1:51:15] they didn't clean the channels
[1:51:17] they didn't clean the memory
[1:51:19] the five senses they didn't clean
[1:51:21] memories they didn't clean the emotion
[1:51:24] they didn't clean and so the prophet
[1:51:26] says it's like a steam
[1:51:29] uh
[1:51:30] you know that it's too much too much
[1:51:32] pressure and they exploded
[1:51:35] they exploded
[1:51:37] and sometimes people are really like
[1:51:39] minded no i'm gonna keep going to church
[1:51:41] i'm gonna keep serving the lord but
[1:51:42] their life does not reflect what they
[1:51:44] used to
[1:51:45] because
[1:51:46] they're they are in this mode of trying
[1:51:49] to find comfort somewhere else
[1:51:55] the prophets talk about why women dress
[1:51:56] immorally she's trying to draw her
[1:51:58] comfort
[1:52:00] from being so well put together
[1:52:02] that she wants to cause men to look at
[1:52:04] her and it makes her feel good so it
[1:52:05] released dopamine you know she's sexy
[1:52:07] men looks at her
[1:52:09] it makes her feel great about herself
[1:52:11] because you know what why she's chewing
[1:52:13] she's doing that because she's in she's
[1:52:15] in distress
[1:52:17] for some something else
[1:52:19] and so the first approach is okay stop
[1:52:21] stop wearing that stop wearing that the
[1:52:23] other question is why do you feel that
[1:52:25] you need to wear that to attract that
[1:52:27] kind of look on you for you to feel
[1:52:29] great
[1:52:31] that's the question that's where that
[1:52:33] and so
[1:52:34] to just to tell someone stop doing it
[1:52:37] it doesn't always work
[1:52:40] it should work it's the word
[1:52:42] repent stop
[1:52:44] is it simple i preached 10 services on
[1:52:48] stop and don't do it anymore and you
[1:52:50] don't obey so you must be serpent seed
[1:52:52] or you rejected the word or you crossed
[1:52:54] the line and all those things to just
[1:52:56] disqualify people
[1:52:59] but a pastor should have a heart to ask
[1:53:01] the other questions
[1:53:03] sit down with someone a lot of problem
[1:53:06] in the church or solve by the preaching
[1:53:08] but a lot of them are solved in the
[1:53:10] office
[1:53:12] one two one thank you brother
[1:53:14] we asked question
[1:53:15] where did it start
[1:53:17] why you start digging and digging you
[1:53:20] know what that's exactly what the holy
[1:53:21] spirit was doing
[1:53:22] vision
[1:53:23] oh you're nervous oh i see it's a lie in
[1:53:26] your church oh there's i see this black
[1:53:27] cloud following yeah it's a lie they
[1:53:29] call you a witch and that's why since
[1:53:30] then
[1:53:32] a lot of times and and i've been acute
[1:53:34] sometimes preaching psychology because
[1:53:36] i'm trying to find in the past something
[1:53:38] but that's exactly what the holy spirit
[1:53:40] do at prayer line
[1:53:42] the holy spirit would come and unveil oh
[1:53:44] i see a dog
[1:53:46] oh i see check a dress you're run
[1:53:48] there's a dog since that day you've been
[1:53:50] nervous because of that event
[1:53:52] and and but now it's gone because why we
[1:53:54] unveil the nuclear bomb in your life
[1:53:59] it doesn't seem that big but for a
[1:54:00] little girl a big dog it was enough for
[1:54:02] her to make her nervous for the rest of
[1:54:03] the life and satan to attack her
[1:54:05] constantly with the spirit of fear that
[1:54:07] came in and so that's how devil work he
[1:54:09] hurts you and then spirit steps in to
[1:54:12] take advantage of our hurt and that's
[1:54:14] why jesus said i came to heal the
[1:54:16] brokenhearted
[1:54:18] because that's a door for satan when if
[1:54:21] your heart is broken satan will use that
[1:54:23] door to step in he did it in my life and
[1:54:25] we're not talking about when you're
[1:54:27] sinner we're talking about when you're
[1:54:28] christian
[1:54:33] so he's using hurt pain in churches
[1:54:36] family and your marriage
[1:54:38] a misunderstanding in your marriage at
[1:54:40] that last and last you try to fix it you
[1:54:43] talk about it doesn't fix it doesn't fix
[1:54:45] and then there's a ditch in it you
[1:54:46] spread apart spread apart spread apart
[1:54:48] and that's where one of them is
[1:54:50] vulnerable or both of them to to fall in
[1:54:52] whatever you know in perversion or or
[1:54:55] lost in this because what there's
[1:54:57] there's a pain in the middle of your
[1:54:59] marriage
[1:55:00] and you don't find a way to solve it
[1:55:02] that's why you should sometimes go see
[1:55:03] the pastor we need help we cannot solve
[1:55:05] this situation she's hurt i'm hurt and
[1:55:08] we don't
[1:55:09] we don't understand each other
[1:55:11] we don't want the same thing we don't
[1:55:13] want to approach it this and sometimes
[1:55:15] you know what
[1:55:16] it is so simple
[1:55:18] it is so simple but we are caught up
[1:55:20] into emotion and we don't see clearly a
[1:55:22] pastor is neutral he looks at that like
[1:55:24] looks to me that it's quite simple your
[1:55:26] problem
[1:55:29] i don't have time to go to that
[1:55:32] now to find comfort
[1:55:35] the holy spirit is the comforter
[1:55:38] but the comfort is linked to truth
[1:55:40] satan's comfort is always linked to lie
[1:55:44] always it's a lie he sells you a lie he
[1:55:47] gives you a lie
[1:55:49] to find comfort
[1:55:50] and that's why people is this this world
[1:55:53] out there is in such a distress
[1:55:55] and when you offer them help they don't
[1:55:57] want it you know why they don't want the
[1:55:58] comforter because it's linked to truth
[1:56:00] and they don't want truth they want
[1:56:02] comfort and a lie
[1:56:05] that's world that's why his world is
[1:56:07] going down but that's why a lot of
[1:56:08] christians are going down because at one
[1:56:10] point for us the truth for them the
[1:56:13] truth is painful
[1:56:14] and their life motto right now is avoid
[1:56:17] pain at all costs
[1:56:19] so if you want to avoid pain at all
[1:56:21] costs so you're going to find pleasure
[1:56:23] in lying
[1:56:24] that gives you comfort but it's not true
[1:56:30] and and the lord says i will leave not i
[1:56:33] will not leave you comfortless
[1:56:35] i will come to you
[1:56:37] and that's if you want to read the
[1:56:38] message he cares do you care that's what
[1:56:40] the prophet's talking about the power of
[1:56:42] god to heal complexes the power of god
[1:56:45] to heal when you're tormented uh he
[1:56:47] cares do you care he preached it twice
[1:56:49] read both of them one jeffersonville one
[1:56:50] phoenix it's really really really good
[1:56:52] really helpful
[1:56:55] john 14 but the comforter which is the
[1:56:57] holy ghost whom the father will send in
[1:56:59] my name he shall teach you all things
[1:57:01] and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:57:02] whatsoever i have said unto you peace i
[1:57:05] live with you leave with you my peace i
[1:57:08] give unto you not as the world giveth
[1:57:11] the peace with a lie but it's peace
[1:57:13] linked with truth you know let not your
[1:57:16] heart be
[1:57:18] troubled
[1:57:21] neither let it be afraid and so that's
[1:57:24] how the devil wants to step in he wants
[1:57:26] to trouble your heart
[1:57:29] remove the peace of your heart to bring
[1:57:31] his peace based on a lie
[1:57:34] listen to this movie you're going to
[1:57:35] feel better but after that you don't
[1:57:36] feel better because it was emptiness
[1:57:40] drink this you're going to feel better
[1:57:42] watch this you're going to be better go
[1:57:43] there you're going to feel better it's
[1:57:45] all
[1:57:46] peace
[1:57:48] linked to a lie because it doesn't bring
[1:57:50] relief
[1:57:52] but the holy spirit wants to do it
[1:57:58] lately that's what the lord told me
[1:58:01] and you know being a pastor you you go
[1:58:03] through a lot
[1:58:05] at one point
[1:58:06] it's really difficult to separate
[1:58:09] the lord
[1:58:10] with all the nonsense you see in church
[1:58:14] and a pastor knows too much
[1:58:16] it's really hard to go to church
[1:58:18] you see people you know the stories you
[1:58:20] know this this this that and then you
[1:58:22] got to focus on on the lord and at one
[1:58:25] point
[1:58:26] it becomes difficult because all the
[1:58:27] lines are blurs
[1:58:29] and so at one point going to church is
[1:58:31] like okay we're going in a house of
[1:58:34] problems
[1:58:36] it's not the house of the lord anymore
[1:58:37] it's a house of problems
[1:58:39] so at one point you just don't want to
[1:58:41] go there anymore and that's why
[1:58:42] sometimes you have you know pastors who
[1:58:44] finally they quit they just can't take
[1:58:46] it anymore and i understand i've been
[1:58:48] there i i stopped preaching for six
[1:58:50] months a couple of years ago and i
[1:58:52] thought it was over i thought it was
[1:58:54] over i would never preach again and i
[1:58:55] would never go back to church because
[1:58:58] it's just
[1:58:59] it doesn't work it doesn't work
[1:59:00] it doesn't work i tried i tried lord i
[1:59:03] tried
[1:59:05] i'm done i'm done
[1:59:07] i give it i give it i give it a try you
[1:59:09] know i've been honest i've been sincere
[1:59:10] i give my whole heart it doesn't work
[1:59:13] people don't understand they'll do this
[1:59:14] with what you say they'll turn this
[1:59:15] they'll leave they'll do
[1:59:19] and then what the lord renew you
[1:59:21] the lord heals you
[1:59:24] but
[1:59:25] i was for a little while i was just
[1:59:27] going to this coping mechanism like you
[1:59:30] go to church you wear your smile because
[1:59:32] that's what you have to do but inside
[1:59:34] you're just bleeding and bleeding and
[1:59:36] bleeding
[1:59:38] and say lord i'm going i'm preaching i'm
[1:59:40] sincere i'm sincere i'm not cheating
[1:59:42] when i'm there i'm gonna give my whole
[1:59:44] heart but once i hit the door i'm put my
[1:59:47] mind somewhere else
[1:59:49] because i just can't
[1:59:51] and the lord told me
[1:59:54] if you have to find comfort outside of
[1:59:57] me
[1:59:58] you make me a liar
[2:00:01] and did really like
[2:00:04] he's right
[2:00:09] he's right but
[2:00:11] and so i realized that i had to find
[2:00:14] comfort you know in listening to videos
[2:00:17] and
[2:00:18] movies and just just just to
[2:00:20] you know this switch
[2:00:22] you know why movies is so big right now
[2:00:25] because movies has this ability to turn
[2:00:27] to switch your brain
[2:00:31] and it's like
[2:00:32] finally i have room to
[2:00:35] read while i why i
[2:00:38] while i watch other people destroying
[2:00:40] their lives and you know kill this one
[2:00:42] and cheat that one and you know
[2:00:45] rarely a a movie is positive it's always
[2:00:48] drama and this and that but at least
[2:00:50] it's not my drama it's somebody else
[2:00:52] right
[2:00:55] and the lord really challenged me
[2:00:57] you know like this quote
[2:01:03] find your joy
[2:01:05] in the holy ghost
[2:01:09] righteousness and peace and joy not in
[2:01:11] the world not out there in the lord
[2:01:15] the lord being your comforter and and i
[2:01:17] don't have time to bring that because
[2:01:19] that's that was another sermon i i i i
[2:01:22] called the sermon you know joy in the
[2:01:24] lord
[2:01:26] this is some symbols like did you preach
[2:01:28] joy in the lord yeah i preached joy in
[2:01:29] the lord
[2:01:31] but with that angle
[2:01:34] the lord the thought of the lord the
[2:01:36] thought of the word the thought of being
[2:01:38] in his presence
[2:01:39] the thought of being in your possession
[2:01:41] with your position bringing you inwardly
[2:01:44] actual real joy not robot
[2:01:48] when we are hurt we come to church we
[2:01:50] become robots
[2:01:52] we do the motion you know
[2:01:54] amen we go back but in inwardly
[2:01:57] something is spinning if i just can walk
[2:01:59] out this place
[2:02:01] and go do what i like it might be
[2:02:04] whatever it can be sports it can be this
[2:02:06] and it's it it's not a problem if you
[2:02:09] you know there's there's good stuff we
[2:02:10] can do
[2:02:12] but when it becomes that you have to run
[2:02:13] away from your bible run away from your
[2:02:15] prayer life run away from church to go
[2:02:17] to that then you have a problem your
[2:02:20] comfort
[2:02:21] is no more the lord but it's this thing
[2:02:24] and at first it seems healthy you know i
[2:02:26] try to balance my life you know it's
[2:02:27] healthy but like samson the scale is
[2:02:31] moving this way this way this way this
[2:02:32] way this way until you find yourself
[2:02:34] completely unbalanced
[2:02:36] and in trouble
[2:02:39] so the lord really really wants us
[2:02:42] to stay
[2:02:44] in this box
[2:02:46] and bring you know if if if the lord has
[2:02:49] poisoned your box called marriage church
[2:02:52] family everything that god's asking you
[2:02:54] if he poisoned that box
[2:02:58] cry made eight
[2:03:00] lord sanders swat theme swords lord send
[2:03:03] the paramedic
[2:03:04] my boxes i'm drowning
[2:03:08] i have to jump out of this life
[2:03:12] i have to dissociate and then we talk
[2:03:15] about trauma and how people can become
[2:03:17] you know dissociated and become two
[2:03:19] people and all that this is these are
[2:03:21] extreme trauma but human beings do that
[2:03:24] naturally when they're when they're in
[2:03:26] pain we run away
[2:03:31] that's what a bible says
[2:03:36] a double-minded man is unstable
[2:03:39] in all his way
[2:03:41] double-minded
[2:03:43] so the bible's talking about being
[2:03:44] double being two-person
[2:03:46] and you're unstable because you pull in
[2:03:48] that direction and then you pull in that
[2:03:50] direction
[2:03:52] because something in your heart and if
[2:03:53] you're in that position this morning
[2:03:55] don't go on this huge you know guilt
[2:03:57] trip no no no no
[2:03:59] if if you're still here today if you if
[2:04:01] you're still listening to this sermon
[2:04:03] it's because there's part of your heart
[2:04:05] i try to keep this alive
[2:04:08] when christian backslid slowly slowly
[2:04:11] slowly why they're doing that they are
[2:04:13] trying to keep that portion of god alive
[2:04:15] because they know it's true
[2:04:17] but they're drowning
[2:04:19] they're drowning and so they're battling
[2:04:21] they try to keep their head out of the
[2:04:22] water like i still go to church
[2:04:25] i will still read my bible but
[2:04:30] and that's where you need help
[2:04:32] boy you need help
[2:04:39] if they're still coming and and that's
[2:04:41] the problem sometimes we don't approach
[2:04:43] it right somebody in that position we we
[2:04:45] tell him like you know why are you even
[2:04:47] coming here anyway
[2:04:49] you do this you do that and then you
[2:04:51] show up on sunday and now you're
[2:04:52] supposed to be a christian shame on you
[2:04:56] like so he's drowning he's like oh me
[2:04:58] and then the pastor whoever put his
[2:05:00] hands on
[2:05:03] it's brutal image oh
[2:05:07] but that was that's what christian does
[2:05:13] he was almost dead anyway you know
[2:05:16] he was barely moving i just saw his
[2:05:19] mother
[2:05:21] boom
[2:05:23] praise the lord
[2:05:24] we removed him out of the blood you know
[2:05:26] we kicked this guy out you know he's
[2:05:28] it's a shame for our church like we're
[2:05:30] supposed to be a clean church and this
[2:05:31] guy hangs around you know
[2:05:33] come on
[2:05:35] we're a hospital we're not supposed to
[2:05:36] have sick people around come on this is
[2:05:39] a hospital
[2:05:40] it's healthy people people who goes well
[2:05:42] they feel well they're healthy come on
[2:05:44] this hospital needs to be clean you know
[2:05:46] you don't want blood here and viruses
[2:05:48] there and come on
[2:05:54] we want strong patient healthy patient
[2:05:57] because it's the reputation of our
[2:05:58] hospital you know it has
[2:06:01] you know
[2:06:02] it's good for i'm a doctor and it's good
[2:06:04] for my medical record record because you
[2:06:07] know they're all healthy at all doing
[2:06:08] good
[2:06:10] people won't die on my watch because
[2:06:12] they're healthy
[2:06:17] ouch
[2:06:20] the prophet says in seven church ages he
[2:06:22] said people he says the church has been
[2:06:24] expired expert like you know jesus when
[2:06:26] he said to
[2:06:27] to peter you know what you bound in
[2:06:28] heaven will be around what you bound on
[2:06:29] earth he said he said we've been we
[2:06:32] became expert in
[2:06:34] losing people
[2:06:36] we don't bind them in christ anymore we
[2:06:38] lose them oh he's gone
[2:06:40] oh he's gone because we don't have the
[2:06:41] patience we don't have the care we don't
[2:06:43] have the love we don't care for the soul
[2:06:46] we just want them wear a smile put a tie
[2:06:48] on and come on behave
[2:06:50] you know shake it off you know this
[2:06:52] sadness and this thing and and you know
[2:06:54] what sometimes it's difficult because we
[2:06:56] don't know what to do with
[2:06:57] with people that are going to trials and
[2:06:59] then it lasts and it lasts and lingers
[2:07:02] and lingers and at one point come on
[2:07:04] shake it okay okay just pretend it does
[2:07:06] never happen
[2:07:07] because we don't have the cure
[2:07:10] we don't know how to bring healing in
[2:07:11] the lives of people
[2:07:16] okay i gotta wrap this quickly
[2:07:19] wrap this quickly quickly
[2:07:21] and how do i do that okay
[2:07:24] okay what i'll skip it all the quotes
[2:07:27] doors and door okay go read that prophet
[2:07:30] talks about when you receive the lord
[2:07:32] front porch step on step on the carpet
[2:07:34] and you say okay stay at the door
[2:07:37] okay and the prophet says no you invite
[2:07:38] him in the living room and then there's
[2:07:40] many doors
[2:07:41] many doors
[2:07:43] it's like when people when when israel
[2:07:44] crossed the promise the the george
[2:07:47] the river jordan
[2:07:49] that was just the start
[2:07:51] later on the bible says they they
[2:07:53] destroyed 31 kings
[2:07:56] all those were strongholds
[2:07:58] jericho ai and all these cities and so
[2:08:01] when when you have this experience with
[2:08:02] the holy ghost a lot of people say okay
[2:08:04] it's a finished work it's finished work
[2:08:05] yeah it's potentially a finished work
[2:08:07] but now draw your sword because there's
[2:08:08] a lot of people on your land
[2:08:11] a lot of memories a lot of strongholds a
[2:08:13] lot of complexes
[2:08:16] and even at one point god tell joshua
[2:08:18] why did you stop fighting is there's
[2:08:20] many more cities well i'm good i'm good
[2:08:22] i'm good i'll manage those guys
[2:08:26] i'll manage that hatred you know i'll
[2:08:28] i'll i'll keep it at bay you know i'll
[2:08:30] i'll manage yeah
[2:08:32] and a day in a day you're weak
[2:08:34] they they they do a rush on you right
[2:08:37] okay gotta move on let's talk about
[2:08:39] contradiction the bible exposed one
[2:08:40] contradiction our life can be a
[2:08:42] contradiction if a man says i love god
[2:08:44] and hate his brother he is a liar
[2:08:47] okay contradiction right oh praise the
[2:08:50] lord
[2:08:52] hallelujah
[2:08:56] it's weird sometimes you you meet people
[2:08:58] like that they come to church you know
[2:08:59] to worship hallelujah and then they come
[2:09:01] after church
[2:09:03] they don't want to shake your hands like
[2:09:04] you're a liar
[2:09:07] i'm so glad this scripture is there you
[2:09:10] know you're a liar
[2:09:13] basically saying if you love god the
[2:09:15] god's love is in your heart if god's
[2:09:17] love is in your heart you cannot hate no
[2:09:18] one
[2:09:19] so if god's love is not in your heart
[2:09:21] you cannot love your brother means you
[2:09:22] don't love god simple equations so
[2:09:25] simple
[2:09:27] talk about contradiction make a short
[2:09:29] story because i gotta really really
[2:09:30] hurry up and finish okay so i'm just
[2:09:33] touching the highlight david david's the
[2:09:35] man of god david's anointed king david
[2:09:38] cheat you know go with bathsheba
[2:09:41] kill zaraya to cover it uriah was a man
[2:09:44] of integrity slap at the door
[2:09:47] uriah on the battlefield
[2:09:50] uriah in front of the king
[2:09:52] uriah in his house was the same man all
[2:09:55] the time
[2:09:56] one box integrity
[2:09:58] i'm at home how can i sleep in my bed go
[2:10:01] with my wife while my men are dying on
[2:10:04] the front field
[2:10:05] i'm sleeping outside on the porch
[2:10:08] the king sends gift it doesn't change
[2:10:10] him it doesn't exploit this back door he
[2:10:13] has or this this box oh the king now i'm
[2:10:15] gonna be a different man integrity
[2:10:18] and integrity was so brutal in front of
[2:10:21] david who had a couple of compartments
[2:10:28] and he died because of his integrity
[2:10:30] because no one can live in a kingdom of
[2:10:33] liars
[2:10:34] someone who has integrity is going to be
[2:10:36] he's going to die in a kingdom of lies
[2:10:40] and david's kingdom a man according to
[2:10:42] god's heart became a man of lie in that
[2:10:45] period he had to repent now what's
[2:10:47] amazing is that nathan the prophet comes
[2:10:50] to david
[2:10:51] and he tells him a story and now of
[2:10:53] course you know when when when the
[2:10:55] prophet comes in in the palace you know
[2:10:57] of course there's probably a ceremony
[2:10:59] and and david put his nice mental like a
[2:11:01] nice robe and probably the the and he's
[2:11:03] sitting on his throne and uh
[2:11:05] what a little music and i mean he's got
[2:11:08] everything done right so he's in his box
[2:11:10] i'm the king the king of the people of
[2:11:12] god and you know the prophet of god is
[2:11:14] like hi nathan you know speak the word
[2:11:17] and he's in that box right
[2:11:19] and then he's you know the story right a
[2:11:21] rich man we're a poor man a lot of
[2:11:23] sheeps one sheep wants to true a party
[2:11:25] kills steal that one sheep and david is
[2:11:28] in that box of righteousness and he's in
[2:11:30] that one you know in that compartment he
[2:11:32] says that man needs to die
[2:11:38] and then god is about to clash those two
[2:11:40] box togethers
[2:11:45] saying
[2:11:47] thou
[2:11:48] art
[2:11:50] the
[2:11:50] man you are
[2:11:53] that man
[2:11:56] imagine the moment
[2:12:02] when there's a couple of psalms i'm sure
[2:12:03] they're written for for that moment
[2:12:07] but that's how that's what the word does
[2:12:09] the word discern it probably did for
[2:12:11] some of you this morning as it did to me
[2:12:13] while i was preaching that
[2:12:16] suddenly you realize lord
[2:12:18] i'm a hypocrite
[2:12:20] lord i'm a hypocrite
[2:12:23] we always thought that hypocrite was
[2:12:25] like
[2:12:25] on purpose
[2:12:27] you do it on purpose
[2:12:28] you're black here and you're white there
[2:12:30] and you're like you're having fun
[2:12:32] no
[2:12:33] sometimes subconsciously we become
[2:12:35] hypocrite because we try to survive and
[2:12:37] we try to adjust ourselves and suddenly
[2:12:39] we split ourselves in two boxes and
[2:12:41] we're not even aware we're playing both
[2:12:42] sides it's like since we're we call it
[2:12:45] spiritual
[2:12:46] amnesia david had spiritual amnesia
[2:12:49] until the truth came it was like boom
[2:12:52] then he repented
[2:12:54] then you realize i'm cheating
[2:12:56] it's not right
[2:12:58] okay
[2:12:59] so this this is how contradiction work
[2:13:01] this is how few boxes works
[2:13:05] okay so go read doors and door i'll skip
[2:13:07] that
[2:13:09] another thing in closing
[2:13:11] sin will take you further
[2:13:14] than you want to go
[2:13:17] and
[2:13:18] keep you
[2:13:20] longer than you want to stay
[2:13:23] if you let it sin will take control of
[2:13:25] your life and it could end up costing
[2:13:27] you far more than you want to pay that's
[2:13:30] what the prophet told billy paul when he
[2:13:32] wanted to backslid you have that in the
[2:13:34] supernatural book book for the
[2:13:36] evangelist and his acclimation
[2:13:38] he says daddy says i want to leave home
[2:13:40] anyway i want to see what the world is
[2:13:41] all about and the prophet told him sin
[2:13:43] will take you further
[2:13:44] longer will cost you more
[2:13:48] and i found this
[2:13:50] phrase
[2:13:52] amazing
[2:13:55] samson played with disobedient
[2:13:58] it brought him
[2:13:59] longer
[2:14:01] further
[2:14:02] it cost him more than he thought like i
[2:14:04] said nobody becomes a christian saying
[2:14:06] okay in five years i'll get discouraged
[2:14:08] i'll start doing compromise
[2:14:10] i'll lose the feeling of the people of
[2:14:12] god
[2:14:13] i'll start despising children of god
[2:14:17] and i'll start i'll start coping and do
[2:14:19] things of the world to feel better about
[2:14:20] myself
[2:14:22] and finally i'll get swallowed into that
[2:14:24] and i'll leave church and i'll i'll turn
[2:14:25] my back on everything that saved my life
[2:14:29] nobody has that such a plan
[2:14:31] but how come so many people end this way
[2:14:34] and we make the mistakes sometimes just
[2:14:36] to say they left us because they were
[2:14:38] not of us
[2:14:41] a lot of people believe a lot of people
[2:14:43] who leave who left
[2:14:45] there are still of us and they will come
[2:14:47] back later
[2:14:50] even our own pastor
[2:14:52] the one who split the church years ago
[2:14:54] left the message half the church left
[2:14:56] with him 25 years later he came back to
[2:14:58] to christ
[2:15:00] unbelievable
[2:15:02] he repented i made a mistake so he did
[2:15:05] not cross the line and he did not leave
[2:15:07] because he was not of us he left because
[2:15:09] he was discouraged he left because he
[2:15:11] was in pain for many and it's not to
[2:15:12] excuse it but he's explain it
[2:15:15] there is balm in gilead
[2:15:17] there is bomb in gilead there is healing
[2:15:19] in the camp
[2:15:24] david same thing
[2:15:27] david you know his anointed king next
[2:15:29] king saul is there saul is attacking him
[2:15:31] saul pursues him everywhere and david
[2:15:33] gets tired and he says there's nothing
[2:15:35] better for me than to leave
[2:15:39] your father preached at a youth camp
[2:15:41] years ago i was a young young man he
[2:15:43] preached about
[2:15:45] about that
[2:15:46] it was such such a he and he started
[2:15:49] explaining
[2:15:50] how you know
[2:15:53] david left
[2:15:54] and then when he left
[2:15:57] he always stayed with me
[2:16:00] he wanted to severely escape
[2:16:03] the pressure from saul
[2:16:04] and he says there's nothing better for
[2:16:06] me
[2:16:07] than to go among the philistines which
[2:16:09] for israelite if you're going to
[2:16:10] philistine
[2:16:12] you're not under the blessing of the
[2:16:13] lord anymore and so it's exactly the
[2:16:15] pattern finding comfort he find comfort
[2:16:17] and and of course he christianized his
[2:16:20] escape
[2:16:21] he was killing the amalekite and killing
[2:16:23] those and making runs burning this place
[2:16:25] and burning that place and i'm still
[2:16:26] serving the purpose of god
[2:16:29] and like the prophet says you know you
[2:16:30] go further you go longer and it costs
[2:16:32] you more well it finally went for a year
[2:16:35] and four months
[2:16:39] and it cost him a lot because at one
[2:16:40] point he went for a run and when he came
[2:16:42] back his wife and all the kids were men
[2:16:45] captive
[2:16:46] so he cost him a lot
[2:16:49] and even his men wanted to stone david
[2:16:52] so it was not a good decision
[2:16:54] but at one point like us
[2:16:56] saul david saw the only way for me is to
[2:16:59] take a little relief
[2:17:01] to take a little break
[2:17:03] in the hands of the philistine
[2:17:05] that's what christians do
[2:17:07] but once you get trapped
[2:17:08] then it cost you more you went further
[2:17:12] and david the family paid
[2:17:14] and that's one thing if you if your
[2:17:16] house the head of the house if you're a
[2:17:17] man or if you're a pastor if you go for
[2:17:19] these kind of run to the philistine your
[2:17:21] family is going to pay your church going
[2:17:23] to pay a price
[2:17:24] i'm guilty of being of doing that every
[2:17:28] christians they they do these these
[2:17:30] these things and it's trap and we have
[2:17:32] to be careful
[2:17:34] saul did the same thing disobey the lord
[2:17:36] and and finally his sons died and i
[2:17:38] don't have time i have to i have to
[2:17:41] to i i have to close but but but that's
[2:17:43] what uh saul did the same thing disobey
[2:17:45] the lord this did not obey played with
[2:17:47] disobedient played with the serbian and
[2:17:49] then till the lord rebuked him and
[2:17:50] finally died on the field in shame his
[2:17:53] sons died with him jonathan probably you
[2:17:55] should he could have been the next king
[2:17:57] and so he lost his sons he he committed
[2:18:00] suicide and but
[2:18:02] on the other side he was at the right
[2:18:03] place he was safe
[2:18:09] in closing
[2:18:15] here make it short i'm going to just
[2:18:16] read this the part that i like says it's
[2:18:19] talking about natural senses and and you
[2:18:20] know five senses of the mind and all
[2:18:23] that and it says and then the on the
[2:18:24] side there's only one gate one entrance
[2:18:26] to go into the sheikah glory where god
[2:18:28] can enter it to him and take over the
[2:18:30] control tower and that way is true
[2:18:33] self-will
[2:18:35] what i realized is that at one point you
[2:18:37] preached to people and i went i i i find
[2:18:39] my place in that
[2:18:41] maybe you're in that situation this
[2:18:43] morning steve i hear you
[2:18:45] i hear you i hear you clear everything
[2:18:47] you're saying is the truth
[2:18:49] but there's nothing in me right now
[2:18:51] to make any kind of move
[2:18:53] to fix this
[2:18:55] or to come back
[2:18:56] in the in this in the in the lane
[2:18:59] and when you're in that position
[2:19:02] you're lost forever no no you're not
[2:19:07] the problem is that your self-will the
[2:19:09] control tower
[2:19:13] and satan and spirits
[2:19:16] has now a hand on the decision-making
[2:19:18] center
[2:19:20] where you hear me something deep deep
[2:19:22] deep inside of you is right it's exactly
[2:19:25] that the way laid it out i know that's
[2:19:27] what happened to me that's how i found
[2:19:29] my place in a place where i never
[2:19:31] thought i would be doing these kind of
[2:19:33] thing that's just for me but
[2:19:36] once the service will be over
[2:19:38] i just don't see how this can stop
[2:19:42] i have no desire in me for that to
[2:19:44] change because that's the only way
[2:19:46] i can go i can cope with
[2:19:48] with this
[2:19:51] and if you're in that situation this is
[2:19:53] the prayer you should make
[2:19:57] amazing prayer
[2:19:58] it works
[2:20:03] if you lost your self-will
[2:20:07] you don't feel you have even
[2:20:10] the desire to change
[2:20:13] pray this prayer it says
[2:20:14] lord i lost the desire to serve you
[2:20:20] i lost the desire to
[2:20:22] be consecrated again
[2:20:25] and to i lost the desire to live the
[2:20:27] life i knew i know i once lived i just
[2:20:30] lost i don't have the desire to return
[2:20:32] even though i know it's the truth
[2:20:34] and pray this prayer says lord
[2:20:38] restore the desire
[2:20:40] to desire that
[2:20:44] we never imagined that we can go one
[2:20:46] level under
[2:20:47] we think that our self-will is the
[2:20:49] foundation of all our life and if we
[2:20:51] lose that we lost everything
[2:20:53] but there's another level under that
[2:20:55] where
[2:20:56] we say lord restore in my heart
[2:21:02] make me want that
[2:21:05] again
[2:21:07] i don't want it now i'm hurting there's
[2:21:09] this there's that
[2:21:11] restore in my heart the desire
[2:21:15] and if you're sincere the lord will do
[2:21:17] it and then from that new ground of
[2:21:20] self-will restored
[2:21:22] it's like a military battle
[2:21:25] said lord i need i need angels now i
[2:21:27] need for you to go to
[2:21:28] can you get back can you give back i was
[2:21:31] stolen my self-will now satan controls
[2:21:34] my desires all i want is just more
[2:21:36] movies all i want is just more social
[2:21:38] media or or more entertainment or more
[2:21:41] this that's all i want i hear steve i
[2:21:43] it's all the truth but i it doesn't
[2:21:45] change the fact that i still want that
[2:21:48] it's because
[2:21:49] you lost the control tower
[2:21:52] and now you can ask for us
[2:21:54] the lord
[2:21:56] swat team
[2:21:58] and i'm telling you this what i'm
[2:22:00] telling you it happened to to people it
[2:22:02] happened to me that prayer works
[2:22:09] send your navy seal lord
[2:22:11] i i lost the battle i i
[2:22:14] to my level lord i even lost the will
[2:22:18] i've lost the battle lord i'm i lost it
[2:22:21] i lost i'm sorry lord i'm messed up
[2:22:24] i lost the control tower
[2:22:26] i cannot even press release i cannot
[2:22:28] send fighter jets i cannot send another
[2:22:30] brigade
[2:22:32] i cannot send anything
[2:22:33] i'm done and without the help of the
[2:22:35] lord if you're that situation today
[2:22:39] and god doesn't send navy seals to
[2:22:41] regain the control tower you'll be gone
[2:22:44] in a couple of months or a couple of
[2:22:45] years
[2:22:47] but good news to you
[2:22:49] good news to me because the lord did
[2:22:50] that to me
[2:22:52] when i stopped preaching i lost the
[2:22:54] desire i am done and i was serious it
[2:22:57] was not playing game i was done i
[2:22:59] totally ended god did a miracle
[2:23:03] like you you realize
[2:23:05] he gave me the desire to to to go on
[2:23:09] and that's god
[2:23:11] that's god
[2:23:13] [Music]
[2:23:17] and that's a sign your hair is growing
[2:23:19] samson
[2:23:20] you've been shaved
[2:23:22] and the philistine they're not smart
[2:23:25] simpson's right
[2:23:26] philistine's not smart
[2:23:29] you shave the guy's head
[2:23:33] you think he stayed shaved
[2:23:35] they were so excited man we got the guy
[2:23:38] shave his head he's a shame he used to
[2:23:40] be a good christian he used to be
[2:23:42] sitting front row sing loud pray read
[2:23:45] man this brother when we shave him
[2:23:51] and they're so excited detroit party but
[2:23:53] they didn't realize
[2:23:56] when they invited him to the party to
[2:23:58] laugh at him his hair was there
[2:24:02] something happened
[2:24:04] and his samson didn't do anything
[2:24:07] samson didn't make his hair grow it
[2:24:09] happened because he's the son of god
[2:24:10] that's his call and it all came back
[2:24:13] amen
[2:24:18] he can do that for you he did it for me
[2:24:22] because you know oftentimes we talk
[2:24:23] about okay you know i was a sinner i
[2:24:25] came to the lord what about i was
[2:24:27] while i was a christian a nuclear bomb
[2:24:29] detonated in my life and i was totally
[2:24:31] lost in my mind not lost
[2:24:33] salvation but loss in my mind lost in my
[2:24:36] emotion lost my vision
[2:24:40] this needs to be ministered upon because
[2:24:42] that's the
[2:24:43] the name of the game right now that's
[2:24:46] where is the war right now christians
[2:24:48] are dying in church pews
[2:24:52] going into the routine going into the
[2:24:54] motion
[2:24:55] like robots
[2:25:00] hallelujah
[2:25:03] and so you know the story
[2:25:05] they're having a big party there he
[2:25:07] asked a young man bring me where the
[2:25:08] columns are the pillars of the house and
[2:25:11] then he leans on there
[2:25:14] and then
[2:25:15] samson verse 28 called upon unto the
[2:25:17] lord and said oh lord god remember me
[2:25:21] and that could be your prayer this
[2:25:22] morning whatever situation you're in i
[2:25:24] pray thee and strengthen me
[2:25:26] i pray thee only this once
[2:25:29] oh god that i may be at once avenge
[2:25:33] of the philistine
[2:25:35] for my two eyes
[2:25:38] and simpson took
[2:25:40] the two middle pillars
[2:25:43] pushed him
[2:25:45] and he slew more that day than in his
[2:25:47] whole life
[2:25:50] it's a great victory but we don't have
[2:25:52] to finish like samson
[2:25:54] blind
[2:25:56] and have this heroic exit
[2:26:00] we can be this steady christian
[2:26:03] get hurt
[2:26:04] forgive heal
[2:26:08] move on
[2:26:09] get hurt
[2:26:11] forgive
[2:26:12] heal
[2:26:13] move on
[2:26:14] rinse repeat
[2:26:16] rinse repeat that's that's our christian
[2:26:19] walk
[2:26:20] hallelujah let's borrow heads
[2:26:29] maybe we can play that song heal me o
[2:26:31] lord
[2:26:32] and i will be healed
[2:26:40] lord jesus
[2:26:42] my my
[2:26:49] we need you lord
[2:26:53] there's so many traps lord and traps are
[2:26:55] nothing when we unveil them
[2:26:59] the holy spirit lord has exposed so many
[2:27:01] things this morning
[2:27:03] to help us
[2:27:06] some of us need to forgive our brother
[2:27:09] some of us needs to forgive
[2:27:11] a sister or wife or husband
[2:27:15] some of us need to deeply forgive our
[2:27:17] previous pastor or a previous deacon or
[2:27:19] a previous church or whatever there is
[2:27:22] so
[2:27:23] many traps in a christian life and the
[2:27:25] devil wants to take advantage of every
[2:27:27] one of them and lord this morning
[2:27:31] forgiveness is not a feeling
[2:27:34] forgiveness is a decision
[2:27:36] it can be a cold-hearted
[2:27:39] decision it doesn't have to be a
[2:27:41] warm-hearted decision
[2:27:44] you can forgive out of a cold heart and
[2:27:46] say lord
[2:27:47] i pronounce these words by faith
[2:27:51] lord
[2:27:52] this brother has offended me the sister
[2:27:55] this wife this pastor this whatever put
[2:27:57] put it put it in your words it's your
[2:27:59] life
[2:28:01] i forgive
[2:28:05] that people
[2:28:07] and lord forgive me also because i
