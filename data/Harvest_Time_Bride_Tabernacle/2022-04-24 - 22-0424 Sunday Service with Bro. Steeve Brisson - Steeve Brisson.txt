may god bless you all this morning i want to thank his family for this invitation it's certainly a a great time spending together last night and to today again and so it's really really a privilege and my family are quite pleased with the trip the meeting the church and so it's certainly a blessing um you may be seated for uh just a minute as i introduce i as as i introduce our topic this morning a subject i want to entitle this this morning don't play with disobedience don't play with disobedience now um i want to ask you a question before we start um you know there is there is bible stories that are there that are i would say they are the extreme case of a certain situation take for an example the an unfair fight okay what is on in the bible a story about unfair fight all right david and goliath okay it's it's the extreme right you got this warrior that you know i don't know 14 feet high and this giants again a kid okay so this is like unfair fight even non-christian there it's still you know if somebody was asked to you know meet a giant even non-christian will say oh you know this is david and goliath right it is even the world cannot find the most extreme example they have to fall back to the bible right okay so this uh we say in french a word it's uh we say caricature candy catsuri is like when you know you have this drawing in the newspaper somebody draws like a situation in the news but they enlarge every you know it's i don't have the word in english for that where we say carry catsure so it's everything is exaggerated to make the point okay so there is i don't know the word in english but kelly katsur in the bible you know david ingolia goliath is like every part of the story is exaggerated right he doesn't mean to kill it with a sword like he kill it with a slingshot and he's a kid and so just you know god wants to show that he's in charge right okay so the next one is you know the man who faces the biggest trial ever joe of course you know even in the world is there this guy is poor like job okay so all right so biggest trial you know you lose everything your children and so whenever you know a christian wants to complain about you know i'm having a hard time the lord has in the bible's like come on okay get over it you know you're just your cat just died you know so it's it's gonna be all right and so you have in the bible like that stories and these are not stories this is a real event a real event but they are there you know to for us to teach a lesson so next time you go into trial go read job and then you'll have a smile because nobody will ever suffer like job did and that's talking about you know of course jesus suffered and but but a regular person losing everything and unfair fight you know david and goliath still hold the vegas you know but when we talk about someone who play with disobedience name one huh samson yeah yes matt you said i think i heard because i don't hear you much okay so samson i don't unless i don't know my bible maybe i'm missing another character but it's not important but samson is the one who played with played games with going you know just you know on the line and crossing and getting back and i'll be just fine so samson played the disobedience game and he thought he could come out and win but he lost of course only the grace of god at the end made him turn right and and glorify but if we talk on the human side he lost everything because he played with disobedience so let's stand up i want just wanted to introduce the the topic this morning and for those who were not there last night it it you didn't you won't miss anything because it's it's just the meeting last night and today will will merge together and so we talked yesterday a lot about pursuing pleasure at all costs with science called dopamine and basically you're when you seek pleasure and you look for reward and and live just a life of pleasure you are hooked to a drug called dopamine which is what your body release and this is this it's not a new drug but it's really something going on right now because they were at the end time and the bible says people would love and seek pleasure and love pleasure more than god and so pleasure in human being you know if there's a chemical reaction you know if you see a nice meal or something or you know you each a big piece of cake and and and and what the feeling you have you know it's called pleasure in the flesh which which god has us has made us you know to be happy but in in this generation people tap on pleasure all the time and and and and so it ties in with what i want to speak this morning about samson and so we're going to turn in the book of judges trump chapter 16 verse 20. now i i have squeezed the three services into one so we're gonna touch you know we we won't be able to go deep in on every aspect but you can you know the holy spirit will do the rest judges chapter 16 verse 20. and so this is um delilah talking you say delaila de lilla dailal forgive my french in french we say dalila so you get the point and she said the philistines be upon thee samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said i will go out as other times before and shake myself and it was not that the lord was departed from him may the lord have the blessing to reading of his word brother made it such a wonderful prayer so you can be seated you can be seated powerful prayer no need to add over it amen may the lord bless you brother it's nice to see churches coming together that pleases the lord certainly and so um i want to start with the story of simpson and then we're going to take a detour and come back to samson at the end because samson fits a certain pattern but his story doesn't fit all pattern we understand that samson was going out for pleasure looking for fun and uh and uh and and so the main point here in the story of samson you know when we read samson a story in the book of judges we think samson was dumb right come on man are you that stupid philistine's in the back room don't you understand this is you know she conspired against you you're like why are you still hanging with the girl and we think he was stupid but he was not stupid actually he was smart and he thought he could outsmart the game because he was playing games she was playing games but he thought come on what does she think she what do you think she's doing right so he thought he could outsmart it so if we go back to judges and so i got i got to really hurry up so if we go back to judges chapter 13 it's it's it's it's pretty much saying you know that samson was called by god he was a man of god oftentimes we see the end of the story and we despise samson no samson was the anointed one he was called by god to deliver israel in a mighty way and he did even at his life at this end at the end of his life he did right and so verse 5 says he shall begin to deliver his israel out of the hand of the philistine and so but right away we see a pattern in samson he's a god he's dedicated to god he's a sign upon his head and his hair you know showing a sign of of of consecration and um and of course simpson always wanted to play both side of the game he wanted to be a servant of god deliver israel and also enjoy the fun of the philistine of the philistine land and the girls and the prostitute and and it's quite it's quite shocking to to to to to see that he was playing playing boatside finally playing with disobedience and and i don't have time to go through you know his life and in his his marriage where he married the wrong girl and then he was looking for he was looking to pick a fight with the philistine and he was always winning and god was anointing him for that to just you know beat the philistine down and you know get rid of them and so when we get in judges 16 verse 4 and it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of sorek whose name was delilah and the lords of the philistine came up unto her and said unto her entice him and we're in his great strength light and by what means we may prevail against him that we may find him to afflict him and we will give three give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver so the idea here and i want i want you to see yourself in this story since you're a christian the devil is is is wondering how can i bring this man or this sister down and so the first thing that satan will look is what do you does you love so he's looking for what you like he's looking for what your heart's open to and he will use that against you so we have to be careful and that's where it ties back to what we preached yesterday where we found our pleasure where we where where we are programmed to think that this is rewarding this brings satisfaction the devil will see okay he found satisfaction there so we will focus on that to bring destruction upon his life so that's that's the game plan really easy really easy easy game plan you can see it from far but you know when we get trapped anyway sometime and we need the help of god to for reference to set us free amen so the idea here is to bring samson down because his consecration makes him such a powerful man the prophet says a man can be so consecrated and so close to god that the devil doesn't know what to do with him and samson was that kind of man his consecration uh satan and the philistine didn't know what to do with the man and the prophet says you know that simpson great is a great deal like the church he started off he started off in the right direction he started off and he was called a mighty man of valor but he started out serving the lord and keeping his word and doing his commandment and that was somewhat like the church it started off on wise we would say as a world expression started on the right foot started to keep the commandments of the lord and as long as simpson followed the lord the lord used samson i got a different quote here about simpson but i will i will skip them because of a matter of time because i got a lot a lot this morning but the idea is in it it's it's like nobody nobody give his heart to the lord nobody goes and take water baptism to say you know what in five years i'll start to be negligent and i'll probably backslid in 10. but that's what happens there is that's what we were saying lately you know our church is full right now it's church is a cycle so sometimes it's full sometimes oops some people leave and then you have you're thinking about expanding and somebody some some house some people leave is okay we don't have to expand anymore and so it's it's a cycle and and and you don't get too excited when it's full and don't beat yourself when it's empty and the prophet's church split two or three times and he said you know half of them are gone and he says i got so excited because i can fill the place again that's what the prophet says and so and so you know a couple of years ago we had people leave and and people were discouraged and i started the studies the prophet's reaction to split because he had two or three and you know brother jackson left and brother um i forgot his name down the eighth street anyway just 15 minutes away and it's really close and and he was you know fellowship with them and going to preach for these brothers and he says you know may the lord bless them and and so he had he had a tremendous reaction to spend and and don't think he didn't got hurt it's it's it's not it's not it's not a party for a pastor when people walk out of your ministry but but so but the devil is using pain and hurt in the church for you to run away from church to find comfort somewhere else and so that's that's a trap so nobody nobody comes to church thinking you know what i'll get this courage and in five years i'll be out the door that's never the game plan but that's the devil's game plan and so we want to know and find out how the devil work uh to get us in on that path amen so the game starts you know he's playing with delilah and and and and and obviously you know we think uh we think samson is dumb uh but he thought he was smart and so we always you know oftentimes when we study you know on the surface that story we kind of think you know why did samson didn't realize you know she was lying to him he knew it but i guess he liked delilah so much probably such a beautiful girl and fun to be with and probably party and you know all the rest and so he was so possessed and so attracted by that girl that he was he said you know i'll i'll take the downside and and i'll i'll i'll outsmart her you know and so the first thing she tries on him verse six and delilah said to science simpson tell me i pray thee wherein thy great strength lieth and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee and simpson said unto her if they bind me with seven green with that were never dried then i shall be weak and be as another men and so like if you're smart you realize okay she's trying to find why i'm strong and she's good friends with prince the prince and the soldiers over there so yeah i know what they want to do they think they can beat me up right well time me with seven green cords you know yeah and he's probably laughing he's like she's so stupid right then the lawrence of the phillies team brought up her seven green with that which had not been dried and she found him with them like she's playing i will tie you with them yeah of course you know have fun she's so stupid you know she think i'm gonna backslid and go back to my whole life come on never god freed me from that right but you're on the satan ground playing games right and so now there were men lying in weight abiding with her in the chamber and she said unto him the philistine be upon thee samson and he break the width and the thread of tao is broken when it it touches the fire so his strength was not his strength strengths was not known and so the idea he's in the living room and he's all tied up with those you know little ropes and then she yell you know samson oh the philistine are here they're in the back room right so we think samson you're stupid leave the place you know they're going to trap you he saw the philistine he understood okay delilah called them they're trying like okay i see it and so he beats you know he knocked this philistine soldier probably they're dead or anyway you know they went to the emergency room and you know what he's like you know business as usual [Laughter] he's having fun for him you know just beating the philistine is just having fun and he says why not you know i have fun doing that i have fun with her you know but that was disobedience because god told him the word of god was clear don't go in that ground on that ground even one night he was within before delilah he was with a prostitute late at night they locked the city so we're gonna trap him so he's he's he lives in sin but he get out of the he get out of the house he saw oh they locked the city oh poor me what what i'm gonna do i'm trapping the city takes the door you know big city doors like wall thick wall it takes to the door out and put the door on top of the mountain it's like you guys try to bring it down and install it again they probably needed 10 guys 20 guys to bring the door back like he's having so much fun he's having so much fun because he's go to church and that's a season where when christians start compromise they do stuff that's against the word and they go to church and they're still blessed and they're like wow man i'm getting the best of both sides i'm having pleasure you know on on the wrong arena and and you know watching this and doing that and hanging with those and then i go to church and bless and i feel the presence of god i still feel the power of god i'm still leading the song as god is with me and wow that's a great deal but what people don't realize is that is a short season so she moves to the next trick right delilah said unto samson behold that has mocked me and told me lies or who's lying delilah's lying but now she's accusing him of lying you know talk about mind games now tell me i prayed he wherewith thou mightest be bound and he said unto her if they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied they shall i then shall i be weak and be as another man delilah therefore took new ropes and bound him there with and said unto him the philistine be upon thee simpson and there will are again in the back room she ties him and you know okay so he's like wow okay we're still in that department and so for him it's all fun so we looks we moved to the next stage right and now he says but now he's getting close because before it was just you know tiny with ropes and this kind of ropes and that kind of ropes but no he says tie time my seven what do you call that seven locks tie them together so he the the you know the enemy is is is is is you you call it zero in right you you you're he's closing on you but he doesn't realize and on top of zeroing on you and getting close to get you this time he falls asleep and so we're in the third you know third the third attempt and where's my mouse okay it's here okay he's now he's sleeping the first two attempts what awake he sees the game now he fell asleep something's going on he's getting he's less sharps his spiritual senses are are getting dull they're getting they're getting down he's not sharp anymore and he doesn't see it because he's blind by pleasure he's blind by dopamine he's blind but by that release and he gets satisfaction and while he's while he's playing and while he's going for pleasure while he's going for this easy life all pleasure and all satisfaction something changed inside of him something changed in his mind his spiritual discernment is going down he's falling asleep and he's getting really close of the real secret he's getting close to get to give away his real consecration then she moves in and i call that she he started to be annoyed to death that's the tactic she went after him in verse 15 she said unto him how can thou say i love thee when thy heart is not with me now she wants his heart thou hast mocked me these three times and has not told me wherein thy great strength length lieth but who's mocking who i'm like you know if i'm sensing i'm like who's mocking who why when you tie me the the the philistine are in the garage right who's mocking who who's loving who right you know but he's playing games he's not stupid you think he can outsmart the whole thing and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urge him so that his soul was vexed unto death there is a scripture talking about the fourth beast in the book of daniel that at the end time the fourth beast will wear out the saints wear out the saints it's a mind battle the greatest battle ever fought and and the devil will annoy you and vex you and annoy you and keep repeating and go after you all the time all the time all the time for you until you just like i just can't stand it anymore it's like you know just can't stand anymore it will he will try to burn you down he will try to wear you out and you what you know what he will he will succeed in worrying you down you'll become tired in your mind tired everywhere and you're just looking for a little relief just a little satisfaction it's just can i get just like 30 second of happiness in this life can i can i have like a 30 second where i can feel like i i will smile and the devil is like yeah come on my ground there's a lot of joy here right there's a lot of you like you know i got a lot of devices come on come on right and so finally he spilled it out and that's where we see that's where we understand in verse 20 that he was not duped he was not deceived he thought he was stronger than the trap he walked in the trap not deceived because he says i will it's not like oh what's happening to me that's not his reaction his reaction is like this trap i'm gonna get i'm gonna break the trap so he knows he's a trap but but dopamine is there it's like people doing stuff you know that and you know it can hurt you you know you you you um you take you know the netflix and i'm gonna filter it you take this and you take that you take that and you're like yeah i know it can be a trap no i know i know i know you know sometimes christians they just i don't know i know it can be a trap but i'll i'll manage that's playing with disobedience that's what sense and thought you know i love the lord and lord god knows my heart i would never return to that uh no no no lord knows my heart never never i'd never returned to that i i i will manage samson thought he'd manage and he did for a while and so he like you know i told you it gave me a new opportunity i witnessed i witnessed to those philistines right i'm doing my ministry god called me to beat the philistine i just knocked 20 of them right last yesterday you know where was that well you know i was in delilah's house but you know the lord used me there so you know it's lord knows lord lord knows everything you know lord knows everything you know i was sitting at the bar with the boys i just drink a coke i just drink a coke but you know what i was able to talk about jesus well right yeah and and i don't say the lord would not send you there once but you know if you hang there all the time you might might get in trouble you know and so this this is how it works right now let's switch the service we're going to take a side road and go in a different direction and come back to samsung and you know again you know he was uh before we move uh he was sleeping and he wake up and his his head is shaving now when when when he said shave my head he knew she would do it so maybe he said okay now i told her better watch out because she's gonna try so i won't fall asleep i'm gonna make sure she falls asleep and then i sleep but i'm gonna you know always because now she knows so it's a little bit dangerous but his discernment's down his senses are down and so finally falls asleep and she tricks him and his head is shaven then what they do first thing right pluck his eyes now he's blind now he's totally blind and on a spiritual level now you go see the brother and he's like yeah no i know it's wrong but you know what it is what it is you know i tried you know i gave i gave to church you know i gave the lord a test you know i get i give i gave it a run you know you know it was good for a while i'll be honest yeah i enjoy the word and lord good great thing for me but you know now it's just like it's not like it was before a lot of people there when they have one foot outside the church that's that's what they're saying yeah i know it's i i cannot deny you know god's been good and there's been a season in my life this was all great but you know it's it's just i don't feel anymore it's it's gone and and and they cannot explain how they went there but it's one decision after the other and okay samson was after pleasure but now i want to touch another area because like i said before it's not like someone's going to say you know well you know five years down the road i'll start compromise and i'll walk out the door that's not how it works right so i want to talk about another aspect with in the book of matthew 22 37 38 so jesus says unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind that's that's a lot of all right yeah and all your heart you know why did he just say love the lord with your heart so love the lord with your heart is not enough it has to be all your heart so this is kind it implies that you could be double-minded you could love the lord from your heart but keep something for yourself and this is the first commandment all the heart all your soul all your mind it means you can be split and that's where we talk about compartmentalizing so where you your heart is divided and you basically live a life of contradiction samson had a life of contradiction he's israelite he's a prophet he's a he's a he's a judge in israel he's a mighty man he's anointed by god but he marries a philistine contradiction and the holy spirit's job is to expose in our life those contradiction you say you love the lord but you do this you say you love the lord you say you're consecrated but you you you do this you talk like that you walk like that it's like there's two person and usually those contradiction and that's the holy spirit's job that's what the bible says the word of god is sharper like a two-headed sword it will discern the thoughts of the heart and the intention it will discern and expose you're saying that but you're doing this and i'm talking about not i'm talking about sincere christian because sometimes we go that route and we don't ever we don't even realize that we become double-minded and our life is a contradiction let's look at the the meaning of of integrity uh the number two there up there is from webster's dictionary the entire so integrity it means the entire unimpaired state of anything particularly of the mind moral science soundness or purity incorruptness uprightness honesty integrity comprehend the whole moral character but has a special reference to uprightness in mutual dealing transfer of property and agency or others the second and third is from other uh um dictionaries integrity means complete like like if i give you something and i says in french we say there's integrity and then there's another word says integr integrity means it's the state of the thing so if if let's say this pulpit is uh from you know years years years back when this church was built right and if you didn't change it if you didn't of course it was changed because i'm sure they didn't have the cloud i'm sure they didn't have that years back right this is this is something you know for the bride but let's say this pulpit was not changed we would say we would say the pulpit has integrity nothing has been moved nothing has been changed it has its original okay so integrity it means complete whole to think and act with integrity we must encompass and integrate all dimensions and reason of our complex world in psychology the opposite of integrity is compartmentalized the person to be able to be happy with a simplistic thinking is content to compartmentalize his life so as not to feel the pain caused by the shock of contradictions and complexities so you create compartment and i i i view so the reason why you need compartment is to separate things of a different nature you want to separate things that are of a different nature so when your heart is compartmentalized like that it's because something doesn't go with the other thing so you need a separation in your heart now some some people might say i don't believe that i gave my whole heart to jesus and and there's no separation in my heart i'm i'm one and total well the prophet preached a message called doors in door there's many doors once and we're going to read those quotes quickly okay but it's just in case i lose you just in case i lose you before we reach there let me give you an example how that works a man who watches pornography at work and covets woman and who comes home in the evening and kisses his wife without the slightest remorse this person has no integrity she is in or he is it's google translates you got to be he is in a biblical language a hypocrite but to do this the person has to compartmentalize his life to make sure that these two contradictions do not clash how many people criticize others for things they do themselves they are not honest but hypocrites often people are without realizing it because they have compartmentalized their lives for a long time their hypocrisy is now a way of life if they are sincere they will cry out to god if they are confronted and exposed to their own games to live in compromise in contradiction the human needs to come from a comparative oh that's a difficult word compartmentalize his life and cut it and cut any emotional link between the two compartments thus he will not be able to feel the pain and discomfort of such monstrosity and such a lie he's comfortable lifestyle but not honest to think and act with integrity you have to think twice did i omit anything do i voluntarily leave something aside to make things simplified to make it seems beautiful and straight i voluntarily leave a lot of things aside so your heart turns into something like that you know and so everything that's acceptable to god you know we're talking about christian wise you know everything that that's acceptable acceptable to god is in that box right you know i go to church and i'm married and i got wonderful children you know i get up in the morning i take a coffee i i eat breakfast i go to work you know this is this is this all fits in that one box you know you're a unified person it all makes sense right but then you know when you open internet you might have in your heart you know another box where you start doing things here that are not compatible with that and you do it of course if you do this while you're in this box you'll feel guilty you'll become so nervous anxious i'm wrong i'm wrong i'm wrong you'll stop but if you feel the urge in so much and and and now there's reason why people create compartment in their life and you know and another thing you know those two box should they never meet they never touch and there's no emotional link between those two box because if there's emotional link between the two you'll feel the guilt of what you're doing taking let's take an extreme example a man cheat his wife he has this girl on the side you know so he goes sees her when the wife's busy whatever you know he finds a way but one day he's with his wife and family and meet his mistress you know at the the supermarket now that's a brutal that's extreme violent moment inside of himself because suddenly the two box meets and they touch and now he has emotion for this and emotion and they are so not compatible that he just walks out the store and runs to hide because he cannot handle the moment where his two boxes meet or you have a teenager right he has he's part of the youth group you know and he's all hallelujah with the youth group but when when he's out there you know he smoked with them and and and drink beers with them and and so it's in but when he's the youth he's all happy he's all hallelujah he's really involved because those are two separate entities and and and and and but but but one day he's hanging out with his friends you know he's at the park drinking beer and suddenly the youth group comes in the park and that's that's a brutal moment when you come back to ohio to the home you love your wife you love your children you love to be at home and then you know everybody falls asleep and you're working in a computer something pops up you know and a lady that's you click and suddenly you find yourself in in on a pornography website and suddenly your wife just opened the door and says honey you don't come to sleep and then she sees the screen and that that's extremely violent moment internally because like no no it's not what you think oh i think it's what i think okay so how can someone how can a christian because we're talking about christians how can they end up doing stuff like that you know of course in the bible language we call that hypocrite and nobody wants to be called a hypocrite and now here it's not to justify why we do that but it's it's it's uh it's related we spoke yesterday on dopamine and to become so the idea of satan is to okay let's say you're a christian you're in church i don't know the reason why samson you know you'd think samson you know just wanted pleasure at all costs and we don't know underneath why he was doing that okay but i've seen you know being a pastor you're with people you you and i go to my own experience anyway i realized that christians doesn't sin usually to sin they don't disobey to disobey most of the time they end up there through a complicated series of event and they end up being living a disobedient life to the lord and they can't help it they're trapped and they know it's wrong and they try to manage both sides like okay i have to feel better i have to i have to you know i have to shake myself i have to come back and i i know i'm on a side road right now i know i'm on the wrong road and i you know i'll catch my breath you know and one of the main thing in that i've seen is satan will cause hurt and pain inside the church or inside the marriage or inside the family or inside the family of god and i'm we're not talking about a little pain we're talking about nuclear bomb pain not talking about you know somebody said something against you and then you just started drinking no no if it's that you know your experience is shallow it's it's it's it's not no no no i've seen as a pastor i've witnessed people go through and i even went through some you know extremely brutal time you know where at one point the devil basically what he wants to do is this box you lie you have for the lord you know and everything inside of it that the lord is asking you to be a husband he's asking you to be a wife he's asking you to be in church and worship with he's asking you to be with saints he's asking you like that's all the lord is asking you what's the devil is trying to do is to poison that box to such a level that it's unbearable you cannot stay in that box one minute longer you have to it's like we call it the fight or flight mode it's like you run for your life it's like so you come to church but not in that box you're somewhere else inside of you you created another box and when we become dual like this that's the day we start the route of being a hypocrite and not being sincere anymore and it's not like okay i'm coming to church today and i won't be sincere that's not how it happens that's not happens it's just that you cannot cope with pain anymore and on top of that you don't know how to release it you don't know how to give it to god so you're trapped into and you're in front of us such a wonderful lord a comforter but you don't find comfort in him anymore because chris the children of the comforter has destroyed you or a man should find comfort in his wife talking with her having fellowship it's our marriage should should be such a safe place where we just lay down our guard and open our heart and and feel so good but it's our marriage is not always like that there are seasons where there's misunderstanding and our guards is up and so suddenly our marriage become you know two entity two hearts that's totally close and that's where you become vulnerable to something else something else can attract you it becomes it can be a trap that is why there is so much emphasis in the bible about forgiveness a christian life without an ounce of forgiveness you'll wreck pretty soon because you will have to live in another world and in that box you say well you know and then you have this christian language like you know no no i have nothing against them but you don't want to see them anymore and i don't know you know i have nothing against them but you know you you live of course you lived in this separate box at church when i preached that that that box thing compartmentalized subject was just that that was a sermon by itself and i and i just used and i don't have time this morning but i wouldn't choose the standing in the gap message the prophet says i'm scarred i i went to many battle i'm hurt i'm hurt i'm in pain and i want to live in the mountains and the lord says yeah you want to you know so he created a box called i'll be like elijah in the mountain and i don't have to mess up with pastors and churches and because he's been so much hurt that he he and that's what christians do sometimes when they are hurt and have complex they'll christianize their complex you know a lot of people who believe in in in listening at tapes at home they they christianize their pain and if you study their life you realize they've been hurt in that church hurt in that church and so they're just basically running from churches to churches until they create a doctrine so they can be at home with themselves because and you know what the pat the prophet went through that i don't have time but a prophet gave us a vision of fletcher and how he would turn into a bomb his wife would leave him and and he says i i you have a special call you have to be in the middle of churches you have to but he couldn't stand anymore he had no more feeling for the people he didn't want to deal with them anymore he didn't have any compassion for them because of what because the prophet was not sincere no because he was too hurt he says lord needs to heal my heart he needs to change my heart so i view the people of god again with a smile and not like this because he's been betrayed he's been he's been true so i don't have time to talk about that but it's it's it's that's what prophet went through so if a prophet went through that because the bible says elijah was are the same nature of their human being and so and a special message about that and i don't have time to go through it but is the message he cares do you care what a prophet is trying about he's talking about trying to find comfort and he says you know they try to draw comfort from some other resource resources let's speak first of the soul you know we found out many people try to find comfort by drinking you know so it's linked to yesterday the dopamine is comfort you you're looking for comfort you're looking for a release of well-being okay and that's where you find you fall in traps of all the the the dopamine release device you know we have a saying which is pretty well known among us today that many ministers drink sometime before going to the pulpit take a good heavy drink of inter intoxication it's been known to seeing ministers on the platform that even stagger under the influence of liquor that ought not to be it should not be because many times we might condemn the men when we may uh not to we ought to find back what back what's the trouble so he's drinking why because he's in desperation he's hurt and that's big mistake church has made for a long time is to condemn the behavior of the people and not ask the question what brought you there sometimes it's a big stumbling block you remove the stone the person just you know the person just falls back in his original position because basically what satan wants to do is detonate a nuclear bomb there so you have to move there and then you're in the wrong position and and this is just rune land it's radioactive it's hyper dangerous you don't want to be there anymore so you have to stand there and when you stand there that's where the devil is at at you so the lord wants to bring healing but we have to go to the lord for healing we have to acknowledge lord this is just happening and i'm hurt i'm hurt at such a point i want to run away but i know it's not your will for me to run away can you heal my heart can you take that load can you repair me lord i'm broken can you fix me but oftentimes we don't do that prayer we just what we call cope and cope with pain doesn't work because cope with pain will make you react and so a lot of christian they you know they have a couple of good years and then after that you know scandals and stuff happen and they get hurt and they get hurt and get hurt and the rest of their christian life they're just reacting compensating for something to happen five years ago i mean people like that you know you talk to them and they're still talking about that pastor 20 years ago i can't believe he did that i can't believe he did that like you're 20 years down the road and are still reacting to that it's like come on this is 20 years old but for them indus in their heart it's today the pain is still there it's still active and they're still reacting to that and now they're reacting to all the pastors that talks because it's for them it's the it's the box called pastors and they're all bad that topic this morning ramification in all kind of direction so a lot of christian on the side of the road even in in the message uh i think it's imitate impersonation of christianity i'm not sure or um the greatest battle they ever fought i think the prophet says you got a lot of christian on the side of the road um in the ditch and he says the reason why is because they didn't clean the channels they didn't clean the memory the five senses they didn't clean memories they didn't clean the emotion they didn't clean and so the prophet says it's like a steam uh you know that it's too much too much pressure and they exploded they exploded and sometimes people are really like minded no i'm gonna keep going to church i'm gonna keep serving the lord but their life does not reflect what they used to because they're they are in this mode of trying to find comfort somewhere else the prophets talk about why women dress immorally she's trying to draw her comfort from being so well put together that she wants to cause men to look at her and it makes her feel good so it released dopamine you know she's sexy men looks at her it makes her feel great about herself because you know what why she's chewing she's doing that because she's in she's in distress for some something else and so the first approach is okay stop stop wearing that stop wearing that the other question is why do you feel that you need to wear that to attract that kind of look on you for you to feel great that's the question that's where that and so to just to tell someone stop doing it it doesn't always work it should work it's the word repent stop is it simple i preached 10 services on stop and don't do it anymore and you don't obey so you must be serpent seed or you rejected the word or you crossed the line and all those things to just disqualify people but a pastor should have a heart to ask the other questions sit down with someone a lot of problem in the church or solve by the preaching but a lot of them are solved in the office one two one thank you brother we asked question where did it start why you start digging and digging you know what that's exactly what the holy spirit was doing vision oh you're nervous oh i see it's a lie in your church oh there's i see this black cloud following yeah it's a lie they call you a witch and that's why since then a lot of times and and i've been acute sometimes preaching psychology because i'm trying to find in the past something but that's exactly what the holy spirit do at prayer line the holy spirit would come and unveil oh i see a dog oh i see check a dress you're run there's a dog since that day you've been nervous because of that event and and but now it's gone because why we unveil the nuclear bomb in your life it doesn't seem that big but for a little girl a big dog it was enough for her to make her nervous for the rest of the life and satan to attack her constantly with the spirit of fear that came in and so that's how devil work he hurts you and then spirit steps in to take advantage of our hurt and that's why jesus said i came to heal the brokenhearted because that's a door for satan when if your heart is broken satan will use that door to step in he did it in my life and we're not talking about when you're sinner we're talking about when you're christian so he's using hurt pain in churches family and your marriage a misunderstanding in your marriage at that last and last you try to fix it you talk about it doesn't fix it doesn't fix and then there's a ditch in it you spread apart spread apart spread apart and that's where one of them is vulnerable or both of them to to fall in whatever you know in perversion or or lost in this because what there's there's a pain in the middle of your marriage and you don't find a way to solve it that's why you should sometimes go see the pastor we need help we cannot solve this situation she's hurt i'm hurt and we don't we don't understand each other we don't want the same thing we don't want to approach it this and sometimes you know what it is so simple it is so simple but we are caught up into emotion and we don't see clearly a pastor is neutral he looks at that like looks to me that it's quite simple your problem i don't have time to go to that now to find comfort the holy spirit is the comforter but the comfort is linked to truth satan's comfort is always linked to lie always it's a lie he sells you a lie he gives you a lie to find comfort and that's why people is this this world out there is in such a distress and when you offer them help they don't want it you know why they don't want the comforter because it's linked to truth and they don't want truth they want comfort and a lie that's world that's why his world is going down but that's why a lot of christians are going down because at one point for us the truth for them the truth is painful and their life motto right now is avoid pain at all costs so if you want to avoid pain at all costs so you're going to find pleasure in lying that gives you comfort but it's not true and and the lord says i will leave not i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you and that's if you want to read the message he cares do you care that's what the prophet's talking about the power of god to heal complexes the power of god to heal when you're tormented uh he cares do you care he preached it twice read both of them one jeffersonville one phoenix it's really really really good really helpful john 14 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you peace i live with you leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth the peace with a lie but it's peace linked with truth you know let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid and so that's how the devil wants to step in he wants to trouble your heart remove the peace of your heart to bring his peace based on a lie listen to this movie you're going to feel better but after that you don't feel better because it was emptiness drink this you're going to feel better watch this you're going to be better go there you're going to feel better it's all peace linked to a lie because it doesn't bring relief but the holy spirit wants to do it lately that's what the lord told me and you know being a pastor you you go through a lot at one point it's really difficult to separate the lord with all the nonsense you see in church and a pastor knows too much it's really hard to go to church you see people you know the stories you know this this this that and then you got to focus on on the lord and at one point it becomes difficult because all the lines are blurs and so at one point going to church is like okay we're going in a house of problems it's not the house of the lord anymore it's a house of problems so at one point you just don't want to go there anymore and that's why sometimes you have you know pastors who finally they quit they just can't take it anymore and i understand i've been there i i stopped preaching for six months a couple of years ago and i thought it was over i thought it was over i would never preach again and i would never go back to church because it's just it doesn't work it doesn't work it doesn't work i tried i tried lord i tried i'm done i'm done i give it i give it i give it a try you know i've been honest i've been sincere i give my whole heart it doesn't work people don't understand they'll do this with what you say they'll turn this they'll leave they'll do and then what the lord renew you the lord heals you but i was for a little while i was just going to this coping mechanism like you go to church you wear your smile because that's what you have to do but inside you're just bleeding and bleeding and bleeding and say lord i'm going i'm preaching i'm sincere i'm sincere i'm not cheating when i'm there i'm gonna give my whole heart but once i hit the door i'm put my mind somewhere else because i just can't and the lord told me if you have to find comfort outside of me you make me a liar and did really like he's right he's right but and so i realized that i had to find comfort you know in listening to videos and movies and just just just to you know this switch you know why movies is so big right now because movies has this ability to turn to switch your brain and it's like finally i have room to read while i why i while i watch other people destroying their lives and you know kill this one and cheat that one and you know rarely a a movie is positive it's always drama and this and that but at least it's not my drama it's somebody else right and the lord really challenged me you know like this quote find your joy in the holy ghost righteousness and peace and joy not in the world not out there in the lord the lord being your comforter and and i don't have time to bring that because that's that was another sermon i i i i called the sermon you know joy in the lord this is some symbols like did you preach joy in the lord yeah i preached joy in the lord but with that angle the lord the thought of the lord the thought of the word the thought of being in his presence the thought of being in your possession with your position bringing you inwardly actual real joy not robot when we are hurt we come to church we become robots we do the motion you know amen we go back but in inwardly something is spinning if i just can walk out this place and go do what i like it might be whatever it can be sports it can be this and it's it it's not a problem if you you know there's there's good stuff we can do but when it becomes that you have to run away from your bible run away from your prayer life run away from church to go to that then you have a problem your comfort is no more the lord but it's this thing and at first it seems healthy you know i try to balance my life you know it's healthy but like samson the scale is moving this way this way this way this way this way until you find yourself completely unbalanced and in trouble so the lord really really wants us to stay in this box and bring you know if if if the lord has poisoned your box called marriage church family everything that god's asking you if he poisoned that box cry made eight lord sanders swat theme swords lord send the paramedic my boxes i'm drowning i have to jump out of this life i have to dissociate and then we talk about trauma and how people can become you know dissociated and become two people and all that this is these are extreme trauma but human beings do that naturally when they're when they're in pain we run away that's what a bible says a double-minded man is unstable in all his way double-minded so the bible's talking about being double being two-person and you're unstable because you pull in that direction and then you pull in that direction because something in your heart and if you're in that position this morning don't go on this huge you know guilt trip no no no no if if you're still here today if you if you're still listening to this sermon it's because there's part of your heart i try to keep this alive when christian backslid slowly slowly slowly why they're doing that they are trying to keep that portion of god alive because they know it's true but they're drowning they're drowning and so they're battling they try to keep their head out of the water like i still go to church i will still read my bible but and that's where you need help boy you need help if they're still coming and and that's the problem sometimes we don't approach it right somebody in that position we we tell him like you know why are you even coming here anyway you do this you do that and then you show up on sunday and now you're supposed to be a christian shame on you like so he's drowning he's like oh me and then the pastor whoever put his hands on it's brutal image oh but that was that's what christian does he was almost dead anyway you know he was barely moving i just saw his mother boom praise the lord we removed him out of the blood you know we kicked this guy out you know he's it's a shame for our church like we're supposed to be a clean church and this guy hangs around you know come on we're a hospital we're not supposed to have sick people around come on this is a hospital it's healthy people people who goes well they feel well they're healthy come on this hospital needs to be clean you know you don't want blood here and viruses there and come on we want strong patient healthy patient because it's the reputation of our hospital you know it has you know it's good for i'm a doctor and it's good for my medical record record because you know they're all healthy at all doing good people won't die on my watch because they're healthy ouch the prophet says in seven church ages he said people he says the church has been expired expert like you know jesus when he said to to peter you know what you bound in heaven will be around what you bound on earth he said he said we've been we became expert in losing people we don't bind them in christ anymore we lose them oh he's gone oh he's gone because we don't have the patience we don't have the care we don't have the love we don't care for the soul we just want them wear a smile put a tie on and come on behave you know shake it off you know this sadness and this thing and and you know what sometimes it's difficult because we don't know what to do with with people that are going to trials and then it lasts and it lasts and lingers and lingers and at one point come on shake it okay okay just pretend it does never happen because we don't have the cure we don't know how to bring healing in the lives of people okay i gotta wrap this quickly wrap this quickly quickly and how do i do that okay okay what i'll skip it all the quotes doors and door okay go read that prophet talks about when you receive the lord front porch step on step on the carpet and you say okay stay at the door okay and the prophet says no you invite him in the living room and then there's many doors many doors it's like when people when when israel crossed the promise the the george the river jordan that was just the start later on the bible says they they destroyed 31 kings all those were strongholds jericho ai and all these cities and so when when you have this experience with the holy ghost a lot of people say okay it's a finished work it's finished work yeah it's potentially a finished work but now draw your sword because there's a lot of people on your land a lot of memories a lot of strongholds a lot of complexes and even at one point god tell joshua why did you stop fighting is there's many more cities well i'm good i'm good i'm good i'll manage those guys i'll manage that hatred you know i'll i'll i'll keep it at bay you know i'll i'll manage yeah and a day in a day you're weak they they they do a rush on you right okay gotta move on let's talk about contradiction the bible exposed one contradiction our life can be a contradiction if a man says i love god and hate his brother he is a liar okay contradiction right oh praise the lord hallelujah it's weird sometimes you you meet people like that they come to church you know to worship hallelujah and then they come after church they don't want to shake your hands like you're a liar i'm so glad this scripture is there you know you're a liar basically saying if you love god the god's love is in your heart if god's love is in your heart you cannot hate no one so if god's love is not in your heart you cannot love your brother means you don't love god simple equations so simple talk about contradiction make a short story because i gotta really really hurry up and finish okay so i'm just touching the highlight david david's the man of god david's anointed king david cheat you know go with bathsheba kill zaraya to cover it uriah was a man of integrity slap at the door uriah on the battlefield uriah in front of the king uriah in his house was the same man all the time one box integrity i'm at home how can i sleep in my bed go with my wife while my men are dying on the front field i'm sleeping outside on the porch the king sends gift it doesn't change him it doesn't exploit this back door he has or this this box oh the king now i'm gonna be a different man integrity and integrity was so brutal in front of david who had a couple of compartments and he died because of his integrity because no one can live in a kingdom of liars someone who has integrity is going to be he's going to die in a kingdom of lies and david's kingdom a man according to god's heart became a man of lie in that period he had to repent now what's amazing is that nathan the prophet comes to david and he tells him a story and now of course you know when when when the prophet comes in in the palace you know of course there's probably a ceremony and and david put his nice mental like a nice robe and probably the the and he's sitting on his throne and uh what a little music and i mean he's got everything done right so he's in his box i'm the king the king of the people of god and you know the prophet of god is like hi nathan you know speak the word and he's in that box right and then he's you know the story right a rich man we're a poor man a lot of sheeps one sheep wants to true a party kills steal that one sheep and david is in that box of righteousness and he's in that one you know in that compartment he says that man needs to die and then god is about to clash those two box togethers saying thou art the man you are that man imagine the moment when there's a couple of psalms i'm sure they're written for for that moment but that's how that's what the word does the word discern it probably did for some of you this morning as it did to me while i was preaching that suddenly you realize lord i'm a hypocrite lord i'm a hypocrite we always thought that hypocrite was like on purpose you do it on purpose you're black here and you're white there and you're like you're having fun no sometimes subconsciously we become hypocrite because we try to survive and we try to adjust ourselves and suddenly we split ourselves in two boxes and we're not even aware we're playing both sides it's like since we're we call it spiritual amnesia david had spiritual amnesia until the truth came it was like boom then he repented then you realize i'm cheating it's not right okay so this this is how contradiction work this is how few boxes works okay so go read doors and door i'll skip that another thing in closing sin will take you further than you want to go and keep you longer than you want to stay if you let it sin will take control of your life and it could end up costing you far more than you want to pay that's what the prophet told billy paul when he wanted to backslid you have that in the supernatural book book for the evangelist and his acclimation he says daddy says i want to leave home anyway i want to see what the world is all about and the prophet told him sin will take you further longer will cost you more and i found this phrase amazing samson played with disobedient it brought him longer further it cost him more than he thought like i said nobody becomes a christian saying okay in five years i'll get discouraged i'll start doing compromise i'll lose the feeling of the people of god i'll start despising children of god and i'll start i'll start coping and do things of the world to feel better about myself and finally i'll get swallowed into that and i'll leave church and i'll i'll turn my back on everything that saved my life nobody has that such a plan but how come so many people end this way and we make the mistakes sometimes just to say they left us because they were not of us a lot of people believe a lot of people who leave who left there are still of us and they will come back later even our own pastor the one who split the church years ago left the message half the church left with him 25 years later he came back to to christ unbelievable he repented i made a mistake so he did not cross the line and he did not leave because he was not of us he left because he was discouraged he left because he was in pain for many and it's not to excuse it but he's explain it there is balm in gilead there is bomb in gilead there is healing in the camp david same thing david you know his anointed king next king saul is there saul is attacking him saul pursues him everywhere and david gets tired and he says there's nothing better for me than to leave your father preached at a youth camp years ago i was a young young man he preached about about that it was such such a he and he started explaining how you know david left and then when he left he always stayed with me he wanted to severely escape the pressure from saul and he says there's nothing better for me than to go among the philistines which for israelite if you're going to philistine you're not under the blessing of the lord anymore and so it's exactly the pattern finding comfort he find comfort and and of course he christianized his escape he was killing the amalekite and killing those and making runs burning this place and burning that place and i'm still serving the purpose of god and like the prophet says you know you go further you go longer and it costs you more well it finally went for a year and four months and it cost him a lot because at one point he went for a run and when he came back his wife and all the kids were men captive so he cost him a lot and even his men wanted to stone david so it was not a good decision but at one point like us saul david saw the only way for me is to take a little relief to take a little break in the hands of the philistine that's what christians do but once you get trapped then it cost you more you went further and david the family paid and that's one thing if you if your house the head of the house if you're a man or if you're a pastor if you go for these kind of run to the philistine your family is going to pay your church going to pay a price i'm guilty of being of doing that every christians they they do these these these things and it's trap and we have to be careful saul did the same thing disobey the lord and and finally his sons died and i don't have time i have to i have to to i i have to close but but but that's what uh saul did the same thing disobey the lord this did not obey played with disobedient played with the serbian and then till the lord rebuked him and finally died on the field in shame his sons died with him jonathan probably you should he could have been the next king and so he lost his sons he he committed suicide and but on the other side he was at the right place he was safe in closing here make it short i'm going to just read this the part that i like says it's talking about natural senses and and you know five senses of the mind and all that and it says and then the on the side there's only one gate one entrance to go into the sheikah glory where god can enter it to him and take over the control tower and that way is true self-will what i realized is that at one point you preached to people and i went i i i find my place in that maybe you're in that situation this morning steve i hear you i hear you i hear you clear everything you're saying is the truth but there's nothing in me right now to make any kind of move to fix this or to come back in the in this in the in the lane and when you're in that position you're lost forever no no you're not the problem is that your self-will the control tower and satan and spirits has now a hand on the decision-making center where you hear me something deep deep deep inside of you is right it's exactly that the way laid it out i know that's what happened to me that's how i found my place in a place where i never thought i would be doing these kind of thing that's just for me but once the service will be over i just don't see how this can stop i have no desire in me for that to change because that's the only way i can go i can cope with with this and if you're in that situation this is the prayer you should make amazing prayer it works if you lost your self-will you don't feel you have even the desire to change pray this prayer it says lord i lost the desire to serve you i lost the desire to be consecrated again and to i lost the desire to live the life i knew i know i once lived i just lost i don't have the desire to return even though i know it's the truth and pray this prayer says lord restore the desire to desire that we never imagined that we can go one level under we think that our self-will is the foundation of all our life and if we lose that we lost everything but there's another level under that where we say lord restore in my heart make me want that again i don't want it now i'm hurting there's this there's that restore in my heart the desire and if you're sincere the lord will do it and then from that new ground of self-will restored it's like a military battle said lord i need i need angels now i need for you to go to can you get back can you give back i was stolen my self-will now satan controls my desires all i want is just more movies all i want is just more social media or or more entertainment or more this that's all i want i hear steve i it's all the truth but i it doesn't change the fact that i still want that it's because you lost the control tower and now you can ask for us the lord swat team and i'm telling you this what i'm telling you it happened to to people it happened to me that prayer works send your navy seal lord i i lost the battle i i to my level lord i even lost the will i've lost the battle lord i'm i lost it i lost i'm sorry lord i'm messed up i lost the control tower i cannot even press release i cannot send fighter jets i cannot send another brigade i cannot send anything i'm done and without the help of the lord if you're that situation today and god doesn't send navy seals to regain the control tower you'll be gone in a couple of months or a couple of years but good news to you good news to me because the lord did that to me when i stopped preaching i lost the desire i am done and i was serious it was not playing game i was done i totally ended god did a miracle like you you realize he gave me the desire to to to go on and that's god that's god [Music] and that's a sign your hair is growing samson you've been shaved and the philistine they're not smart simpson's right philistine's not smart you shave the guy's head you think he stayed shaved they were so excited man we got the guy shave his head he's a shame he used to be a good christian he used to be sitting front row sing loud pray read man this brother when we shave him and they're so excited detroit party but they didn't realize when they invited him to the party to laugh at him his hair was there something happened and his samson didn't do anything samson didn't make his hair grow it happened because he's the son of god that's his call and it all came back amen he can do that for you he did it for me because you know oftentimes we talk about okay you know i was a sinner i came to the lord what about i was while i was a christian a nuclear bomb detonated in my life and i was totally lost in my mind not lost salvation but loss in my mind lost in my emotion lost my vision this needs to be ministered upon because that's the the name of the game right now that's where is the war right now christians are dying in church pews going into the routine going into the motion like robots hallelujah and so you know the story they're having a big party there he asked a young man bring me where the columns are the pillars of the house and then he leans on there and then samson verse 28 called upon unto the lord and said oh lord god remember me and that could be your prayer this morning whatever situation you're in i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only this once oh god that i may be at once avenge of the philistine for my two eyes and simpson took the two middle pillars pushed him and he slew more that day than in his whole life it's a great victory but we don't have to finish like samson blind and have this heroic exit we can be this steady christian get hurt forgive heal move on get hurt forgive heal move on rinse repeat rinse repeat that's that's our christian walk hallelujah let's borrow heads maybe we can play that song heal me o lord and i will be healed lord jesus my my we need you lord there's so many traps lord and traps are nothing when we unveil them the holy spirit lord has exposed so many things this morning to help us some of us need to forgive our brother some of us needs to forgive a sister or wife or husband some of us need to deeply forgive our previous pastor or a previous deacon or a previous church or whatever there is so many traps in a christian life and the devil wants to take advantage of every one of them and lord this morning forgiveness is not a feeling forgiveness is a decision it can be a cold-hearted decision it doesn't have to be a warm-hearted decision you can forgive out of a cold heart and say lord i pronounce these words by faith lord this brother has offended me the sister this wife this pastor this whatever put put it put it in your words it's your life i forgive that people and lord forgive me also because i probably offended them as well i probably did worse and lord you see your seed hurt you see my my heart has become a radioactive wasteland because of that nuclear bomb lord can you restore can you remove all the radiation and i can remove all the radioactivity lord can you remove lord all the bitterness i lord can you take bitterness do you know what to do with bitterness i don't know what to do with that i give you my bitterness lord i entertained it it became mine or take it lord today because lord if you don't take bitterness out of my life if you don't take the pain out of my life i have to go and seek pleasures and dopamine in so many places just to cope and then in that area lord i know i don't live the life and now i feel guilty you know we add up and we just piled problems over problems lord i come back to you or bring me back in the center of the lane lord i got two wheels in the ditch and two wheels on the road and it's bumpy lord it's it's a it's a rough ride i don't like it lord i don't like that ride lord i i would like to go back to a ride in the middle the road where you where i'm blessed and i don't damage my car take my heart lord heal me this morning i acknowledge i was hurt can you can you take the pain can you take and restore me lord then david sing that song restore to me the joy of that salvation he never lost his salvation he lost the joy he lost the joy and many christians go through that they lost the joy and in the lord so they go out there you know entertainment and stuff because the joy of the salvation is not present anymore so we have to replace it or restore the joy that's what i ask you even lord lately restore the joy of being a pastor can you give me oxy i need air lord i need air it's i'm choking seems like there's no oxygen supply lord can you restore oxygen can can i
