[21:13] be part of the family of God.
[21:17] We love you, Lord God. And Lord, we not
[21:19] just pray for this service, but Lord, we
[21:21] pray for camp and many people are
[21:24] traveling. I'm going to start picking

[21:46] need to give their lives solely to you.

[22:51] this house. Just many just preparing for
[22:54] camp. Lauren Shield were just in the
[22:55] last runs of the states coming preparing
[22:58] for camp. We got people staying at their
[23:00] house of camp and be sick.
[23:05] Brother Bernard and Sister Ruth are
[23:08] going friends and to bring their mom and
[23:10] dad back for camp.
[23:13] God is good. Amen.
[23:15] pray for the ministers and the brother
[23:20] just
[23:21] said it won't be a fellowship
[23:24] but it'll be God's presence.
[23:30] Let's turn to Psalms 51
[23:34] verse 12.
[23:38] Excuse me.
[23:42] Psalms
[23:49] 51:12.
[23:51] If you haven't caught it by now, preach
[23:53] on the word of the Lord.
[23:55] Amen.
[23:55] Amen.
[23:57] Here David, after he had sinned and
[23:59] fell, he said, "Restore unto me the joy
[24:02] of my salvation,
[24:04] and uphold me with thy free spirit."
[24:08] Let's turn to first John 1
[24:12] verse 4.
[24:17] This is a powerful powerful scripture.
[24:20] You know, I really I really had
[24:22] confirmation. I actually talked about a
[24:24] month ago on Wednesday night about joy
[24:27] and I almost doubled my message on that
[24:30] Wednesday night.
[24:33] And
[24:34] you know, I was in my study yesterday
[24:38] and I sat down to relax last night and I
[24:41] listened to the message the first
[24:42] message the brother preached of John
[24:45] Wednesday night
[24:47] on
[24:50] God really wants us to have joy first
[24:53] John 1:4 for these things right I unto
[24:57] you
[24:59] that your joy
[25:02] may be full now you it's up to you you
[25:05] can make that personal but these things
[25:06] I write unto you that your joy may be
[25:10] full. Lord Jesus, we pray that you'll
[25:12] bless your word and bless your people
[25:14] and may your spirit just feed them your
[25:17] heavenly mana this morning. We pray in
[25:19] your name we pray. Amen. God bless you.
[25:22] You may have your seats. See you, you
[25:24] know, in the the family of God, the
[25:26] reason that we would lose our joy or if
[25:28] we would lose our joy or or if you're in
[25:31] that state, it's because of of
[25:34] disappointments.
[25:36] uh a discontentment
[25:38] or or or no satisfaction in Christ
[25:41] because we could never the Bible clearly
[25:44] tells us
[25:45] that if you put your joy in anybody,
[25:48] you're going to be disappointed.
[25:49] That's right.
[25:50] Everybody will let you down. If your
[25:52] best wife, your best husband, your kids,
[25:55] your angels, or whoever you think is a a
[25:58] celebrity or a god to you, they are
[26:01] going to let you down. But there's one
[26:02] person that won't let you down and
[26:05] that's Christ Jesus. And see, when we
[26:07] come together in fellowship, yes, it's
[26:09] important for us to fellowship. But more
[26:12] important than even our fellowship is
[26:14] fellowship with Christ.
[26:16] And if you have fellowship with Christ,
[26:18] if you personally this morning are
[26:21] locked into fellowship with Christ, it
[26:23] won't matter how I fall down.
[26:24] Amen.
[26:26] And it won't matter how your sister
[26:27] falls down. It'll make no it won't even
[26:29] fe you because you're not looking at
[26:32] your brother or your sister. Though you
[26:34] love them and though they're they they
[26:36] may have the characteristics of Christ,
[26:39] but you are acting on the perfection.
[26:43] There's no perfection in flesh.
[26:46] Amen. This flesh will never be perfect.
[26:49] I'm going to have a bad day.
[26:52] That's right.
[26:54] You base your eternal experience on my
[26:56] bad day. Yeah.
[27:00] Amen. It's going to be bad. But Christ
[27:02] don't have bad days.
[27:03] No, that's right.
[27:04] Amen. Watch here. And I I would just
[27:06] lay. It's just really good. And I want
[27:09] to show you people that couldn't focus
[27:11] on God. Couldn't f Well, well, it's just
[27:14] so easy to get out of your joy. You can
[27:16] lose it from jealousy and all these
[27:18] things. But let let me give you an
[27:20] example before I even start to preach
[27:21] here. here. Saul lost the joy of the joy
[27:25] of the Lord because the people love
[27:27] David.
[27:28] When they come back from the army, they
[27:30] said Saul has killed his thousands, but
[27:32] David his 10,000. And Saul's attitude
[27:35] was rough
[27:37] with David.
[27:38] Just like that.
[27:40] Well, they sing a special better than I
[27:42] could.
[27:44] He's a fantastic song lead singer.
[27:47] They got to go see. You see what I mean?
[27:49] See how you enjoy. And it's all because
[27:52] your attitude was focused on people
[27:55] instead of Christ.
[27:56] You know what I'm going to show you this
[27:58] morning? Christ was the savior of Saul.
[28:01] And Christ was the savior of David.
[28:03] Yeah. That's right.
[28:06] That's right.
[28:09] Amen. We're going to have many different
[28:10] people, denominational people and and
[28:12] and just wonderful family and and and uh
[28:15] different ones that camp. Watch how
[28:17] Brother Brown talks about. He said, "You
[28:18] know, when we come together in these
[28:19] union meetings and we worship God, let
[28:21] your heart open up, brother, to all men
[28:25] and say, God bless you, brother, even if
[28:27] the man's wrong. Don't condemn him.
[28:31] Help him. Help him up." And when you see
[28:33] a drunker or a prostitute on the street,
[28:35] don't point your finger and scoff and
[28:38] say, "I'm better than you are."
[28:42] The thing to do is the person is just as
[28:45] low as they can get now. And if
[28:47] anything, take your hand and lift them
[28:48] up to Jesus Christ, the son of God that
[28:51] can save them.
[28:52] But oh, I watch watch. Now, this is
[28:55] getting down right to where the rubber
[28:56] hits the road.
[29:00] And this is our prophet. He said, "Oh,
[29:02] but I belong to a church that we won't
[29:04] let such people in our churches."
[29:08] That's not the case here.
[29:11] Church is supposed to be a hospital.
[29:14] If we don't have six people coming in
[29:15] here, we're not open for business.
[29:18] Yeah.
[29:19] He said, "Oh, I belong to churches and
[29:21] we won't let such people in. We draw
[29:23] boundary lines down and we'll let
[29:26] certain class of people in our
[29:27] churches." That's right. What we need is
[29:30] a good oldfashioned Holy Ghost revival
[29:33] nationwide, which will make us all shake
[29:35] hands one with another and call one
[29:37] another brother and sister.
[29:42] Amen.
[29:43] That's right. Here in Psalms 51, we just
[29:45] read the one verse, but in Psalms 8, it
[29:47] says, "Make me hear the joy and gladness
[29:51] that the bones which thou has broken may
[29:54] rejoice and create in me, oh God, and
[29:58] renew the right spirit in me, and cast
[30:00] me not away from your presence.
[30:03] Take not thy holy spirit from me, and
[30:06] restore unto me the joy
[30:09] of my salvation." said, "You know,
[30:11] Brother Brown said multiple times, we
[30:13] should be the happiest people
[30:16] in the world."
[30:17] Do you know where you're spending
[30:18] eternity?
[30:20] You can't have a bad day.
[30:23] That's not possible.
[30:25] You know who your savior is?
[30:29] You know who your Lord is. You know
[30:31] who's promised to supply all your needs
[30:33] according to his riches and glory?
[30:37] That's right.
[30:39] Amen. Half the world don't know that.
[30:46] He said here in the message why he said
[30:48] now people we want to renew the joy of
[30:50] our salvation and you that somewhere
[30:52] that you've lost your joy back that you
[30:54] did. He said you did you neglected
[30:56] prayer reading. You neglected reading
[30:58] your Bible. You ne neglected praying in
[31:00] your home and asking for the blessing at
[31:02] the table. He said don't ever do that.
[31:03] He said oh my. He said, "So on becoming
[31:07] to Christians, no matter where you are,
[31:10] bow your head and pray. Don't be ashamed
[31:12] of Christ. Pray anywhere. See if ever
[31:16] where you are left your joy or whatever
[31:20] weeded it out, what a root of bitterness
[31:23] has come in." And remember when men is
[31:26] saved this much, he this is a beautiful
[31:30] paragraph. I said remember when a man
[31:31] saved this much he said it's like a
[31:34] button and it becomes eternal life in
[31:37] your heart
[31:39] that's God this button and as you're
[31:42] able to push out all the roots of
[31:44] bitterness then God begins to spread
[31:48] in you
[31:51] and then you become a son of God
[31:55] because the God button spreads in you
[31:59] Yeah.
[32:00] And it pushes out all the bitterness.
[32:04] That's right.
[32:05] And you become a son of God. I, you
[32:08] know, we're going to look and and we're
[32:09] going to go fast through some of this. I
[32:10] want to get to the end. But first John
[32:12] here, our first scripture we read first
[32:14] John 1 three. I want to watch this. You
[32:17] know, here here we're talking
[32:20] that he said that which we have seen.
[32:22] Here's Paul talking or or John, I mean,
[32:25] sorry. here. This is what we've seen and
[32:28] heard and we declare unto you that we
[32:31] also may have fellowship with us. And
[32:36] truly th this the end of this first
[32:39] verse three, the end of this verse is
[32:41] what I'm trying if you catch this part,
[32:44] you've caught the message. You know,
[32:47] I believe in fellowshipping together.
[32:50] But it's only because we have one union
[32:52] and that's Christ.
[32:53] Amen. We have one purpose and that's
[32:56] Christ. But watch how the end of verse
[32:58] three writes. He said, "Truly our
[32:59] fellowship
[33:01] is with the father."
[33:06] I think that's good to repeat. Truly,
[33:08] our fellowship is with Christ.
[33:11] You know, it won't matter what happens
[33:12] in church if you come to church
[33:14] and your fellowship
[33:16] is with the father.
[33:17] Yeah. I mean, I I mean, it'll be on the
[33:19] word, but I'm saying I'm saying as far
[33:21] as the flesh goes, won't matter if the
[33:23] church is hot, won't matter if it's
[33:24] cold.
[33:26] Won't matter if you had a flat tire on
[33:27] the way. Won't matter if we sang a song
[33:30] wrong.
[33:31] That's right.
[33:32] Amen.
[33:33] And truly, our fellowship is with the
[33:35] father and with his son, Jesus Christ.
[33:38] And these things I write unto you that
[33:40] your joy may be full. I want, you know,
[33:43] every message believer should hear this.
[33:45] If you're unhappy today, it's because
[33:48] you've lost fellowship with Christ.
[33:51] God taught us that you don't, you know,
[33:52] a believer don't backslide.
[33:54] They come out of fellowship. And if
[33:57] you're sad, if you're disappointed in
[33:59] this church this morning, it's not
[34:01] because you're brothers and sisters,
[34:04] because you're not fellowshipping on
[34:06] Christ.
[34:08] You don't have the joy of Christ. And
[34:09] the Bible's loaded with joy. Go. God
[34:12] never made a family to be depressed.
[34:16] Amen.
[34:17] God don't have no downer pills or no
[34:19] depression pills. Psalms 18, I'm going
[34:21] to go through some scriptures, but
[34:23] Psalms 18:24, this is the day that the
[34:26] Lord hath made. We will rejoice and be
[34:29] glad in it.
[34:30] That's right.
[34:30] And here the prophet says the greatest
[34:32] power of he said, but our strength is
[34:34] the joy of the Lord is our strength.
[34:36] Hebrews 12:2,
[34:39] looking on to Jesus.
[34:42] You notice it never said looking on to
[34:44] the preacher.
[34:46] Amen.
[34:46] Do you notice it never said looking on
[34:48] to your sister that is busy raising her
[34:50] family?
[34:51] Amen.
[34:52] You notice it never said looking on to
[34:54] the deacons that are doing a fantastic
[34:56] job. Amen.
[34:58] Says, "Looking on to Jesus, the author
[35:00] and finisher of our faith, who for the
[35:02] joy that was set before him, endured the
[35:05] cross, despised the shame
[35:07] and is set down at the right hand, the
[35:09] throne of God." Here's Jesus. And you
[35:12] know why? When you look at the Godhead,
[35:14] you know, Christ is the anointed one.
[35:16] The meaning of Christ is the anointed
[35:18] one. And God is a spirit. And we know
[35:22] that there's only one God spirit. God is
[35:25] a spirit. Those that worship him must
[35:27] worship him in spirit and truth. But you
[35:29] know when David was going to the cross d
[35:32] or sorry when Jesus was going to the
[35:33] cross in his flesh he did not want to
[35:36] die.
[35:38] That's why he prayed twice. He said
[35:40] father if it's possible take this cup
[35:42] from this flesh
[35:44] but nevertheless thy will be done. God.
[35:46] He s Jesus in the flesh surrendered his
[35:50] flesh will
[35:52] because of the joy
[35:57] of fellowship with Jehovah.
[35:59] Amen.
[36:00] And Jehovah was right in that flesh.
[36:04] That's amazing. You know when Jesus was
[36:06] praying in the garden, you know, we we
[36:09] don't believe in free God. Anything
[36:10] that's got more than one head is
[36:13] pagan.
[36:16] When Jesus was praying in the garden,
[36:18] who was he praying to?
[36:22] He prayed to himself.
[36:24] The father, the spirit, the father was
[36:26] he was the fullness of the godhead.
[36:29] Dwel inside.
[36:31] If you're here this morning and you have
[36:32] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you
[36:34] you're praying, you're doing your family
[36:36] devotions at home or you're in your
[36:38] prayer closet and you're praying or you
[36:40] come to prayer me or wherever you
[36:41] prayed. If you're driving down the road
[36:42] or driving a tractor and you're praying
[36:45] to your heavenly father, who are you
[36:46] praying to?
[36:48] The heavenly father that's inside you.
[36:51] Cuz you it's it's not me that liveth,
[36:52] but him that liveth in me.
[36:54] Yeah, that's right.
[36:54] Amen. You don't have to look at a far
[36:56] away God. The father away God. He's
[36:57] right inside you. I'm packing him. I
[36:59] brought him with me this morning.
[37:01] We woke up together.
[37:03] Actually, I shouldn't say that. I woke
[37:04] up. He was already awake.
[37:06] Amen.
[37:09] Amen.
[37:12] Watch this here. Isaiah the prophet in
[37:16] in the Bible here, you know, he was so
[37:19] influenced by King Uzziah.
[37:22] And King Uzziah fell later in his life.
[37:24] King Uzziah was a great king. Did what
[37:27] God loved. And he got high and lifted
[37:29] up. He got proud and religious.
[37:33] He got that God had blessed everything
[37:35] he touched. He could do anything
[37:38] and not be sin. And God called King
[37:41] Uzziah, he died. And it so shook the
[37:44] prophet Isaiah that he ran to the
[37:46] tabernacle. And in Isaiah 6:1 talks
[37:50] about King Uzziah died and and Isaiah
[37:53] ran to the tab tabernacle and he fell in
[37:56] a vision because he was a prophet and he
[37:58] saw and he said, "I saw the Lord sitting
[38:00] on the throne high and lifted up and his
[38:03] train filled the temple and above it
[38:05] stood the seraps and each one with six
[38:07] wings and with plain he covered his face
[38:09] and with twain he covered his feet with
[38:11] twain he did fly and one cried unto the
[38:14] other saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the
[38:16] Lord God of host.
[38:17] The whole
[38:20] is full of his glory. And the doorpost
[38:22] of the church moved at the voice of him
[38:24] that crith and the house was filled with
[38:26] smoke.
[38:28] And then here King Isiah or Isaiah came
[38:31] back the prophet and said, "Woe is me
[38:35] for I am undone."
[38:38] Watch what the prophet was admitting.
[38:41] He was saying, "I had my eyes on King
[38:43] Uzziah too much.
[38:47] He said then he said I woe is me for I
[38:50] am undone because I am a man of unclean
[38:53] lips and I dwell in the midst of people
[38:55] of unclean lips but mine eyes have seen
[39:00] the king
[39:02] the Lord of hosts. You know whenever we
[39:04] get a relationship and you have when
[39:06] you've had a relationship and an
[39:08] encounterment with the Lord of hosts
[39:13] you're never the same.
[39:14] That's right. Moses was never the same
[39:17] Moses.
[39:18] That's right.
[39:18] After the burning bush,
[39:25] when you get an encounter with cracks,
[39:28] all this other stuff, all the dog
[39:31] barking and the cat meowing and and all
[39:33] this stuff, it just kind of falls away.
[39:36] That's right, sir.
[39:37] Just kind of falls away.
[39:41] Amen.
[39:42] We We have to We have to we have to
[39:45] train I believe we have to train our
[39:47] bodies our flesh mind
[39:48] to come in submission
[39:50] to the spirit of God. I want to give you
[39:52] an example
[39:53] and this just just literally one moment
[39:55] came to me. You know this week we were
[39:58] doing some farming and Esther was
[40:01] helping me
[40:02] and we were spreading cattle
[40:05] and we had a catastrophe happen.
[40:10] She come back and she did not bring good
[40:12] news at all. It looked like I could head
[40:15] to the scrap pile with what we were
[40:17] doing our farm
[40:21] and I thought wow
[40:26] and you know just almost in an instance
[40:28] what
[40:31] really doesn't matter
[40:33] something will happen. I mean,
[40:37] you know, you could have went into great
[40:38] depression and said, "Oh, it's going to
[40:40] cost me all kinds of money, and why me,
[40:43] Lord, and why did this happen?" And,
[40:45] you know, time I got the house, I said,
[40:47] "Lord, church, it doesn't really matter
[40:49] to me. You want to fix it or keep it or
[40:52] change it? It makes no difference to me.
[40:53] If you don't want the miners, we'll just
[40:54] leave it in the bottle."
[40:59] Amen.
[41:00] See that children of God aren't supposed
[41:02] to lose it because your car blows up and
[41:04] overheats you. Maybe God don't want you
[41:06] driving that car.
[41:07] Maybe he's got a better car for you or
[41:09] no car at all. Maybe he's got a better
[41:11] bike. You lose weight like
[41:15] Proverbs 17:22. A merry heart does good
[41:18] medicine.
[41:19] Yes. Amen.
[41:19] And a broken spirit dryth the bones.
[41:23] Wonder why health is at an alltime low?
[41:27] is because people ain't got the joy of
[41:29] the Lord in their strength.
[41:31] That's right.
[41:33] That see they got their eyes. Yes, the
[41:35] world's falling apart. But you know
[41:37] what? God is still our Lord.
[41:39] That's right. Amen.
[41:40] A merry heart. You know what? You could
[41:43] just have an accident just well. Wow. It
[41:46] could have been worse.
[41:49] I didn't like this car anyway. I didn't
[41:51] like how the seats sat or something.
[41:53] You might as well say that.
[41:57] Amen.
[41:58] Here the prophet says why we should be
[42:00] the h the message forsaking we should be
[42:02] the happiest people in the world. You
[42:04] know everybody wants people that are
[42:07] happy.
[42:09] You know it's amazing. I I've had
[42:10] neighbors and people reach out to me.
[42:12] I I you know just this week the people
[42:15] across the road they sent me pictures
[42:17] and videos and her husband was over here
[42:19] blowing the leaves off the the sidewalk
[42:22] and the ramp and thought I should get
[42:23] over here with the spray and start
[42:24] spraying the weeds and I and he was
[42:26] taking care of the property for me and
[42:27] they were just having a hilarious time.
[42:33] But we're the believers.
[42:39] Amen.
[42:40] Amen.
[42:43] They were just happy to be happy. They
[42:45] were happy to be on. Do you know that
[42:47] they're happy because we're across the
[42:50] street from them?
[42:51] They told us.
[42:55] But are you happy that you can come
[42:57] here?
[43:00] Do you see the difference?
[43:02] You know, I had a you know, I told you I
[43:04] don't think I shared I shared we had
[43:06] some some friends that are coming to
[43:08] camp and and they've only been here one
[43:10] time and most of you weren't here cuz
[43:12] most people close churches. It was just
[43:14] a terrible snowstorm. It was in the
[43:16] winter time and they came to my birthday
[43:18] party
[43:20] and then they came back one time and and
[43:22] we've been kind of connected with them
[43:23] and when they came, you know, we we
[43:25] showed them a video of of many TV
[43:28] evangelists that were in the prophets
[43:29] meetings and testified of the of the
[43:32] power of God that was in his life. And
[43:34] so I sent him home with God sends the
[43:36] prophet to Africa, the book.
[43:39] God sends the prophet to Africa, the
[43:41] book.
[43:43] Don't put your hands up. Who's read it?
[43:45] Amen. You know what he sent me back? He
[43:47] sent me a great big long text.
[43:51] He said, "I couldn't put the book down."
[43:54] He said, "Wow, that was a modern day
[43:57] Elijah."
[43:59] He name He named people that their
[44:01] ministry came out of Brother Bram's
[44:03] ministries.
[44:05] Okay, this is somebody you ain't seen in
[44:06] the church. Watch out. You're going to
[44:08] see him at camp. This is somebody that
[44:10] wanted three posters for camp to take
[44:12] back and give to his Pentecost church,
[44:14] invite them all to camp.
[44:18] He sent me in the text. He said, you
[44:19] know, we can't wait to see you for camp.
[44:22] And he said, if you need help setting
[44:23] up, we'll be there.
[44:26] You know what that is? That's one word,
[44:28] joy.
[44:30] That's joy. But you would believe if
[44:32] they come in here that you have more
[44:33] than him because you have the open book.
[44:36] But do you have joy?
[44:38] If you have the open book, you must have
[44:40] joy.
[44:42] Amen. If all the mysteries are revealed
[44:43] to you, how can you not be joyful?
[44:47] That's right.
[44:50] A Christian don't have one thing to
[44:51] worry about. Their prophet talking to
[44:52] him, they should be the most freest,
[44:54] happiest people in the world.
[44:57] He said, don't look down and be wary. He
[44:59] said, why you should be the most
[45:01] happiest people.
[45:03] He said, what do you got to fear about?
[45:06] why you should be the freest and
[45:07] happiest anywhere. These are just one
[45:10] lines out of multiple quotes.
[45:12] He said, "Now, you don't know that the
[45:14] same God that did all these things right
[45:16] here to you tonight." He said, "I think
[45:18] we should be the happiest people in the
[45:20] world." Psalms 28:7, I'm just trying to
[45:24] go fast here, go through some of this to
[45:26] get to the end. Psalms 28:7, "The Lord
[45:29] is my strength and my shield. My heart
[45:32] trusteth in him
[45:34] and I am helped. Therefore, my heart
[45:37] greatly
[45:39] rejoices.
[45:46] Your heart greatly rejoices.
[45:50] Wow. You know, I I'm going to tell you a
[45:52] sad report. You know, most of the time
[45:54] when I get a happy message, it's from
[45:57] somebody outside the church. Most of the
[45:58] time I get a another kind of a message
[46:01] is people inside the church that aren't
[46:02] happy.
[46:04] They're not joyful,
[46:06] but they're converted.
[46:09] They're message believers. They have the
[46:10] open book. The revelations are revealed.
[46:14] You know, we're never all we're never
[46:16] all going to understand the word of God
[46:18] exactly the same.
[46:20] We're never going to see the mysteries
[46:23] even though they're revealed. And you're
[46:24] never going to have the exact same
[46:26] doctrine of the word of God exactly the
[46:28] same as each other ever
[46:31] in the flesh.
[46:33] In the flesh. It'll never happen because
[46:35] you were raised in different countries
[46:37] by different parents, in different
[46:39] environments, in the town, in the
[46:42] country and things and different
[46:43] nationalities and all this and your mom
[46:45] and dad put stuff in you when you were
[46:47] small that you you can't get away from
[46:49] or or things like that. And so in the
[46:52] flesh, why would we fight over petty
[46:54] things?
[46:58] That's right.
[46:59] Amen.
[47:02] We believe that God came down in our day
[47:05] and revealed himself like never before.
[47:08] We can agree upon that.
[47:11] Amen.
[47:12] Isaiah 65:17-19.
[47:15] Behold, I create a new heaven and a new
[47:17] earth. And the former shall not reme
[47:19] remember, nor shall come into mind. But
[47:22] be ye glad and rejoice ever in that
[47:26] which I have created.
[47:29] For behold, I create Jerusalem a
[47:32] rejoicing and her people
[47:34] rejoice.
[47:36] And I will rejoice in Jerusalem and in
[47:39] the joy of my people. Now, this is Old
[47:42] Testament.
[47:44] You know, if you know your Bible,
[47:46] Isaiah, the book of Isaiah is the same
[47:49] amount of books as every book in the
[47:51] Bible. And every chapter of Isaiah is
[47:54] like a book in the Bible because Isaiah
[47:56] writes a whole history in the Bible.
[48:00] So, this is the end of Isaiah.
[48:02] And God's talking about his bride.
[48:05] Yeah.
[48:05] In the Old Testament.
[48:07] And he said, "But you shall be glad and
[48:10] rejoice.
[48:12] because I created all of you
[48:14] and behold I created the Holy Ghost.
[48:16] Jerusalem is a type of the Holy Ghost
[48:19] and rejoicing and her people shall be
[48:21] joy because they they they have the
[48:24] infilling of God and I will rejoice with
[48:26] you
[48:28] and in the joy of my people and the
[48:30] voice of weeping shall no more be heard
[48:33] and heard nor the voice
[48:36] of crying.
[48:38] Amen.
[48:40] Wow. We know that the scripture says
[48:42] that a righteous man, the footsteps of a
[48:44] righteous man are ordered of the Lord.
[48:47] All things work together for good.
[48:50] That's right.
[48:51] To them that love God.
[48:53] Amen. Your what you what would take away
[48:56] your joy? Maybe a trial in your life
[49:00] could be leading you to another person
[49:02] that you wouldn't have met to witness to
[49:05] them.
[49:05] That's right.
[49:09] You see somebody you would have never
[49:12] met.
[49:16] Unless you'd had that trial.
[49:22] Let me give you an example.
[49:24] I just told you about what happened to
[49:26] us. So I took our spreader to the park
[49:29] service
[49:31] and he come out to look at it and two of
[49:33] the neighbor men came in and they were
[49:35] paying their bill.
[49:37] And they were watching my spirit
[49:41] at how I was dealing with a big boo boo,
[49:45] a really big boo boo.
[49:47] And I cracked a joke when I left. I
[49:49] said, "Mike, I'll try to grow enough
[49:52] soybeans to pay my bill when you get
[49:54] done." And they all bursted out
[49:56] laughing.
[49:59] Do you know God might have made that boo
[50:01] boo
[50:02] just so those two neighbors
[50:05] could have seen a man of God in the
[50:07] flesh
[50:09] not cussing and swearing losing his
[50:11] temper
[50:12] at a big boo boo and could make a joke
[50:15] and everybody bursted out laughing
[50:18] and you thought that you weren't in
[50:20] God's will.
[50:22] You thought God he loved you so
[50:23] perfectly he gave you that trial.
[50:30] See? See how God sees the beginning from
[50:33] the end.
[50:35] That's right. Amen.
[50:36] Amen.
[50:36] Amen.
[50:37] God help us. The six-fold purpose of
[50:40] God. Be glad and rejoice. The joy of the
[50:43] people that her people were joy. What is
[50:46] the anointing? What is the anointing of
[50:48] God? Here's the prophet saying it's the
[50:51] joy of the Lord.
[50:54] The king is on the throne. The royal
[50:56] majesty of the throne, eternal, the
[50:58] eternal throne, the eternal people and
[51:01] the eternal joy and the eternal city. Oh
[51:05] my.
[51:06] Here's another one is the falling away.
[51:08] He said, "The L the the joy of the Lord
[51:10] is my strength." And we come with joyful
[51:13] hearts and we have the privilege. Oh,
[51:16] wait a minute now. Wait a minute. We
[51:19] have the privilege of coming together
[51:23] in the presence of God.
[51:26] to ask any petition that we would desire
[51:29] and the joy comes that we can look into
[51:33] the open word.
[51:36] Amazing. God help us.
[51:39] We should just be happy.
[51:44] Amen. Philippians 4 I mean these are
[51:46] Bible. These are scriptures I'm giving
[51:48] you. Philippians 4 10-11. But I rejoice
[51:51] in the Lord greatly.
[51:54] And
[51:56] ain't that something?
[51:59] You know, you know the prophet said, you
[52:00] know, if if we had the right joy of the
[52:02] Lord in our heart, he said, you wouldn't
[52:04] be able to keep people away from the
[52:05] doors when it was open.
[52:08] David said, I was glad when they said on
[52:10] to me, let us go into the house of the
[52:11] Lord. Oh, praise the Lord. Church is
[52:13] open. We have a service. Can't wait to
[52:16] get there.
[52:24] Romans 8 31 and 32 common scriptures and
[52:29] we're just coming down to some examples
[52:30] in the Bible. What shall we then say to
[52:33] these things? If God be for us,
[52:38] who can be against us?
[52:42] He that spared not his own son, but
[52:44] delivered him up for us all.
[52:48] How shall he not with him also freely
[52:51] give us all things?
[52:55] Christ is telling you he will give you
[52:56] all things.
[52:59] But you're struggling with joy.
[53:03] Wow. Psalms 37:23 and 24. The steps of a
[53:07] good man are ordered of the Lord, and he
[53:09] delightth in his way.
[53:12] And though he fall, he shall not utterly
[53:14] be cast out. For the Lord upholdeth him
[53:17] with his hand.
[53:20] Amen.
[53:22] Amen. We're just We got I got a couple
[53:23] examples and some quotes here I want to
[53:25] show you. He said, "No wonder the
[53:26] mountains jumped for joy on that day. No
[53:30] wonder the sun hit its face and screamed
[53:33] for joy. No wonder all of nature broke
[53:36] loose and the wind shook the trees until
[53:38] they shook and shook for joy and jumped
[53:40] when they seen that Jesus on the
[53:43] mountain redeemed every name that was in
[53:46] the book and said, "It is finished
[53:50] and we're freed from the world and the
[53:52] things of the world and the joy of the
[53:54] Lord has filled the congregation." And
[53:56] they shouted and screamed and cried.
[53:58] They shouted at the top of their lungs.
[54:00] They said, "For the glory of God, I
[54:02] never did see anything disorderly about
[54:04] it."
[54:06] Here's the prophet talking about people
[54:08] worshiping under the presence of God.
[54:10] They were always in the right order
[54:12] because they were recognizing that the
[54:14] lamb,
[54:16] their name was on the lamb's book of
[54:18] life.
[54:20] Amen.
[54:24] And why it had to be shepherds or why
[54:27] sorry why does God's people want to stay
[54:30] home?
[54:34] He said because there's no joy in the
[54:36] house of the Lord.
[54:39] He said, "What makes a person want to
[54:42] drink, run around, act like that? Is it
[54:45] because we don't have any God? Is it
[54:48] because there's no joy in the house of
[54:50] the Lord anymore? Is it because the Holy
[54:54] Spirit isn't really ready to bless all
[54:58] of us? Is there anything wrong with it?
[55:03] But because that we do it, the reason
[55:05] that we're cursed and the reason that
[55:08] God put this thing upon the church, this
[55:10] cold dampness, is we're going to other
[55:14] places
[55:15] for pleasure.
[55:18] Instead of coming to the house of God
[55:20] for pleasure, the house of the Lord is
[55:23] the joy of the Lord. The joy of the not
[55:25] just the house but your life is the joy
[55:28] of the Lord. The joy of the Lord is of
[55:31] the of his people and you wanted to come
[55:33] and be together and be happy. Watch what
[55:36] this is the prophet still. and be happy
[55:39] and be satisfied,
[55:42] giving praise and honor and glory and
[55:45] wisdom and might and power
[55:49] to God.
[55:51] He wants you to do that.
[55:54] God wants you to be so happy that you're
[55:57] stoned drunk
[56:01] in the spirit.
[56:02] That's right.
[56:04] Amen.
[56:05] So happy. Look, when those 3,000 were
[56:07] added to the tabernacle or they come out
[56:10] of the upper room and they had the
[56:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[56:13] they said, "You've been drinking." Peter
[56:15] said, "No, this is that Joel the prophet
[56:18] talked to
[56:21] Amen.
[56:22] God help us."
[56:26] God help us.
[56:29] Here in Nehemiah,
[56:31] the Old Testament, it talks about the
[56:33] the ministry bringing the people
[56:35] together to worship the Lord and bow
[56:38] their faces before the ground. And
[56:40] Nehemiah 8 and let's just jump to nine.
[56:43] And and this holy day, this is a holy
[56:45] day unto the Lord your God. Mourn not
[56:48] nor weep, for all the people wept when
[56:50] they heard the words of the law law.
[56:52] Verse 10. And then he said unto them, go
[56:55] your way and eat the fat and drink the
[56:57] sweet and set portions before them for
[57:00] the joy of the Lord
[57:03] is your strength. And so the Levites
[57:06] stilled the people, saying, "Hold their
[57:07] peace, for the day is holy, neither be
[57:10] ye grieved." And all the people went thy
[57:13] way, and drunk, and ate portions, and
[57:16] made a great minor minor. And the word
[57:19] minor means cheerful, laughed, high
[57:21] spirits, joyful, or light-hearted. The
[57:24] people were all lighthearted and
[57:26] laughing and joyful because they had
[57:29] understood the words
[57:31] that were declared onto them by the
[57:34] prophet.
[57:37] Amen.
[57:40] We're never going to get to heaven and
[57:43] say somebody took and blame somebody
[57:46] else because they took the joy of the
[57:48] Lord from you.
[57:49] You're going to say, "Well, I had a
[57:50] terrible marriage,
[57:52] so I'm not joyful.
[57:54] I had a terrible church, so I'm not
[57:56] joyful. Or I had a terrible this that'll
[57:59] never work is because God God has to be
[58:01] number one in our life.
[58:03] And all these other things are side
[58:05] pieces
[58:07] to build your character.
[58:09] And are you really dedicated
[58:12] to Jehovah?
[58:14] Amen. Our strength is the joy of the
[58:16] Lord, get away the telling the Satan and
[58:19] the devils, get away from them. Cut them
[58:21] with the word.
[58:24] Watch Hebrews 12:14 here
[58:27] 14 to 17. Hebrews 12. He said, "Follow
[58:31] peace with all men in holiness, without
[58:34] which no man shall see God." Wow.
[58:38] Looking diligently, lest any man fail of
[58:41] the grace of God, and lest any root
[58:47] of bitterness would spring up and
[58:49] trouble you, whereby you would be
[58:51] defiled.
[58:53] The only way a root of bitterness can
[58:54] spring up is if your joy is gone. They c
[58:58] they can't grow in the same garden
[59:00] together.
[59:01] That's right.
[59:02] One kills the other.
[59:07] Amen.
[59:10] God help us
[59:13] here in the Christ the mystery of God
[59:16] revealed here a prophet says you know he
[59:17] said if a brother if you think he's a
[59:19] little wrong or sister you say Lord
[59:22] don't let me ever have a root of
[59:24] bitterness spring up because it will
[59:26] affect him and it will take Christ right
[59:30] out of my life that poison aids malice
[59:35] and jealousy and hatred and it'll kill
[59:37] the holy spirit take it right away from
[59:39] you and it'll run him out of the
[59:40] tabernacle and it'll kill the spirit of
[59:43] God and drive it away from here. It'll
[59:45] hurt your pastor and it'll do
[59:47] everything. See, don't you do that. Just
[59:49] wax closer together and draw up. Take
[59:52] the buckle and testify.
[59:56] Amen. Put on the whole armor of God.
[1:00:00] Tighten up the buckle and come closer
[1:00:01] together. Love one another. Tell nice
[1:00:04] things one to another.
[1:00:08] Amen.
[1:00:10] Isaiah or Ephesians, sorry. Ephesians
[1:00:13] 4:29.
[1:00:17] Ephesians 4:29. Let no corruption,
[1:00:21] corrupt communication proceed out of thy
[1:00:23] mouth.
[1:00:26] Amen.
[1:00:26] But that which is good to be used of
[1:00:29] edifying.
[1:00:30] Yes. Help us.
[1:00:35] That would get rid of all complaining.
[1:00:39] Kids were noisy.
[1:00:42] They distracted me. A car went by to the
[1:00:45] torren. The train crossed through town a
[1:00:47] lot.
[1:00:49] Let all corrupt communication, let no
[1:00:52] corrupt communication proceed out of thy
[1:00:54] mouth,
[1:00:54] but that which is good to be used for
[1:00:58] edification,
[1:00:59] that it may minister grace to the
[1:01:01] hearer,
[1:01:03] and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
[1:01:05] whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
[1:01:07] your redemption. And verse 31, and let
[1:01:10] all bitterness
[1:01:12] and all wrath and clamor and evil
[1:01:15] speaking be put away from you. Amen.
[1:01:18] With all malice, and be ye kind.
[1:01:22] Wow.
[1:01:26] Tenderhearted,
[1:01:29] forgiving one another, even as God for
[1:01:32] Christ's sake,
[1:01:34] has forgiven you.
[1:01:40] Amazing. Amen.
[1:01:44] We already shared with you one of our
[1:01:46] examples.
[1:01:47] of Saul how he was wroth
[1:01:51] with David
[1:01:54] because actually that's in 1st Samuel
[1:01:57] 18:8 and Saul was very wroth and saying
[1:02:01] it displeased him because people praised
[1:02:06] David
[1:02:08] my amazing amen you know we can look in
[1:02:11] 2 Chronicles 18 and just I'll tell you
[1:02:14] the story in the Bible but here Jehosa
[1:02:17] at was part of the leader of of Jordan
[1:02:20] and and the king Ahab was the leader of
[1:02:22] Israel and Josh Jehoshaphat came down to
[1:02:26] Ahab and they should have had no
[1:02:28] fellowship because Ahab was a wicked
[1:02:30] king Jezebel. Amen. Very wicked. But
[1:02:33] here, you know, here in the first verse
[1:02:35] of this chapter talks about how Ahab had
[1:02:37] tried to woo uh Jehoshaphat into him and
[1:02:41] and and and put a big feast on and
[1:02:43] partied with him and and tried to get
[1:02:45] him on his side. And they were going out
[1:02:48] to war together.
[1:02:53] And the king
[1:02:55] had asked Ahab, the king had Josh had
[1:02:59] asked for the prophets to find out if
[1:03:02] God would go with them. And Ahab had 400
[1:03:05] prophets that testified that God was
[1:03:08] with them. You know the story better
[1:03:09] than me, many it's it's an old story.
[1:03:12] And you know, we know that a prophet
[1:03:14] talked about that God had actually sent
[1:03:16] a lying spirit down in those 400
[1:03:18] prophets. But what I want to get to
[1:03:20] here, this part, and Jehoshaphat knew in
[1:03:23] his soul that there was something wrong.
[1:03:27] He had no business fellowshipping with
[1:03:29] unbelief.
[1:03:33] That's right.
[1:03:34] Josh 5 asked King Ahab. He said, "Is
[1:03:37] there anyone else that I can ask?"
[1:03:41] He said, "Yeah, well, there's one more
[1:03:42] prophet, but I hate him."
[1:03:46] Wait a minute. He didn't even wait to
[1:03:48] hear his message.
[1:03:51] Said, "There's one more, but I hate
[1:03:52] him."
[1:03:54] You see, he never had no joy.
[1:03:57] His joy was gone. His his his conclusion
[1:03:59] was already made.
[1:04:01] See how Jehoshaphat was a believer and
[1:04:04] he was asking Ahab was a makeeliever, a
[1:04:07] non-believer, and but see how there was
[1:04:09] no joy in the Lord in his tone
[1:04:13] because his eyes was fixated on men.
[1:04:17] that had told him different things.
[1:04:18] Amen.
[1:04:20] God help us.
[1:04:21] We see the same thing in the garden
[1:04:23] where where Cain and you know Cain
[1:04:25] brought his sacrifice and Abel and God
[1:04:27] rejected God had respects Abel's
[1:04:30] sacrifice and refused Cain and Cain. The
[1:04:32] Bible says Cain's heart was wrought
[1:04:34] immediately. And God said why are you
[1:04:36] wroth? If you do what's right, you'll be
[1:04:39] accepted.
[1:04:43] But he couldn't do what was right.
[1:04:45] He couldn't do what was right
[1:04:48] because his daddy was the wicked one.
[1:04:52] Amen. You know what we have here? And
[1:04:54] I'm going to read my last quote. I think
[1:04:56] I'm going to finish. I have many other
[1:04:58] quotes. I might read a couple. But
[1:05:01] what you see here is this is what we
[1:05:04] have is in our churches.
[1:05:08] We have Pharisees.
[1:05:13] We have Pharisees in the message
[1:05:17] and they're only here to belittle the
[1:05:19] true believer.
[1:05:21] Now, I have a quote from the prophet.
[1:05:26] I know you'll love to hear.
[1:05:28] He said, "I want to take a subject on
[1:05:30] taking sides with Jesus."
[1:05:33] And and I wish we could put it up there.
[1:05:35] I have this quote if you'd like to.
[1:05:37] Anybody want it sent to him? Vicki is
[1:05:38] not here. She put it up there. The
[1:05:40] Pharisees were leaders in Jesus day and
[1:05:44] they tried to to belittle him before the
[1:05:47] people
[1:05:49] and that was just the way that the devil
[1:05:51] had to do the working. All the Pharisees
[1:05:55] and the teachers of his day constantly
[1:05:58] tried to belittle Jesus
[1:06:02] and they would throw off and they could
[1:06:04] give him and they they would all throw
[1:06:08] off that they could give him and done it
[1:06:11] and they watched Jesus constantly trying
[1:06:14] to find out where they could find Paul.
[1:06:17] See, that's what the
[1:06:21] that's what the the Pharisees do in a
[1:06:24] church
[1:06:25] is they don't come to they don't come to
[1:06:27] church to have their eyes on Jesus.
[1:06:30] They come to church to see where can I
[1:06:31] find fault. I there's something wrong
[1:06:34] here
[1:06:36] and my purpose in the bride of Christ is
[1:06:39] just to point out the blame.
[1:06:41] That's what the Pharisees thought. Watch
[1:06:43] what the prophet said here. He said they
[1:06:45] watched Jesus constantly to find out if
[1:06:47] they could find fault. And they never
[1:06:49] spoke of his good
[1:06:51] things. They were always finding
[1:06:53] something that they could belittle Jesus
[1:06:55] about and say, "You see, look at here.
[1:06:58] If he's a man of God, he wouldn't have
[1:07:00] done it this way. Or if he was a man of
[1:07:02] God, he wouldn't do it this way." And
[1:07:04] they were trying to cast a shadow on
[1:07:08] Jesus and get the people to disbelieve
[1:07:11] him. And that was the work of the devil.
[1:07:14] And that's the old schedule that never
[1:07:17] ceases. Uh
[1:07:18] oh.
[1:07:19] See, we still got Pharisees in the
[1:07:21] church.
[1:07:22] There's many times that a minister will
[1:07:23] get up and will make a mistake. This is
[1:07:27] paragraph 130. I can give you the
[1:07:29] message here in a second. And if he
[1:07:30] comes to the into a neighborhood, a
[1:07:33] precious brother, and he's trying to do
[1:07:34] what's right and lead the people to the
[1:07:37] right, and everything that the devil can
[1:07:40] point the finger to the unbeliever or a
[1:07:43] so-called Christian in the neighborhood
[1:07:45] to throw that man off,
[1:07:48] he'll do it. Here he's saying that Satan
[1:07:51] will there will be a real man of God
[1:07:53] come in the neighborhood and Satan will
[1:07:55] point out to the makeelievers and the
[1:07:57] sinners. He's not real. Watch him.
[1:08:02] He said, you know, a real Christian way
[1:08:05] is to hide everything you can from a
[1:08:07] brother. Don't tell his bad things. Just
[1:08:11] tell his good things.
[1:08:12] Just tell what you know was good about
[1:08:14] him.
[1:08:15] And if anything is bad, let it alone.
[1:08:17] The poor fellow's already got enough
[1:08:20] against him anyhow.
[1:08:21] Don't try to take a pole and shove the
[1:08:23] man down farther into the ditch. The
[1:08:25] Christian attitude is to pick him up and
[1:08:28] take him out of the ditch and say, "I
[1:08:30] never did shove you down. He's down
[1:08:33] already."
[1:08:34] Try to help him. And many of us today,
[1:08:37] too many of the people today, I might
[1:08:40] say, would try to do that if they could
[1:08:42] just find something another that they
[1:08:45] could say that was real bad about the
[1:08:49] person.
[1:08:52] Wow.
[1:08:53] See, spirits don't die.
[1:08:56] Brother Brandham understood them
[1:08:57] perfectly in his day. And now, for
[1:08:59] instance, if one of you brethren would
[1:09:02] make a mistake or do something wrong,
[1:09:05] which you're subject to do, watch, this
[1:09:07] is a real man of God, and I am too.
[1:09:11] This is the prophet.
[1:09:13] Every one of us. But as we go along, let
[1:09:17] us remember that we are brothers.
[1:09:20] We are brothers. And if we got any
[1:09:22] fighting, let's fight with one another.
[1:09:25] Bring it together. Let's not fight with
[1:09:27] one another.
[1:09:29] bring it together before the brethren as
[1:09:31] settle it. But Jesus,
[1:09:35] I just skipped the two paragraphs there
[1:09:36] and I'm just still reading 134. But
[1:09:39] Jesus, they just tried to find every
[1:09:42] shadow they could to try to belittle
[1:09:45] Jesus in the sight of the people. That
[1:09:50] is an evil spirit.
[1:09:54] That's an evil spirit.
[1:09:58] And that's what the devil wants. They
[1:10:00] want to hurt your influence before the
[1:10:02] people. And that's the way you want to
[1:10:04] watch carefully what you do. Walk like a
[1:10:07] real man of God. Talk like a man of God.
[1:10:09] And act like a man of God. Because the
[1:10:12] devil, your adversary, is going about
[1:10:15] like a roaring lion seeking who he can
[1:10:17] devour. And you know who he's going
[1:10:19] about seeking who he can devour in? The
[1:10:22] makeeliever.
[1:10:24] Why did they do this? Why didn't the
[1:10:26] Pharisees do this?
[1:10:28] They were jealous of Jesus.
[1:10:32] That was what the reason was. They tried
[1:10:35] to belittle Jesus. They were jealous of
[1:10:38] his ministry. That's the reason they
[1:10:40] tried belitting him. Well, he had the
[1:10:43] ministry of God. They knew that. But it
[1:10:47] was contrary to their own personal ideas
[1:10:50] or their own personal creeds. So they
[1:10:53] tried belittling Jesus to make
[1:10:56] everything everything a little flaw that
[1:10:58] they could find to get him out of the
[1:11:00] way. They wanted Jesus to quit and they
[1:11:05] wanted the people
[1:11:07] to denounce him.
[1:11:10] Wow.
[1:11:12] Where's the joy? A premeditated attitude
[1:11:17] to break somebody down. Amen. the the
[1:11:19] joy of the Lord. You know, you know, the
[1:11:22] Bible says we work out our own salvation
[1:11:24] with fear and trembling. It don't matter
[1:11:27] if your brother or sister's wrong to you
[1:11:29] personally. God will not hold you
[1:11:32] responsible for your brother or sister
[1:11:35] coming in this church and maybe be truly
[1:11:37] wrong.
[1:11:40] They'll answer for their own deeds,
[1:11:43] but God will judge yours
[1:11:46] and say, "How joyful were you? How kind
[1:11:48] for you. You know, the world's looking
[1:11:50] for somebody that's joyful. These
[1:11:53] neighbors across the road want somebody
[1:11:55] that's going to be joyful and happy.
[1:11:57] Tell them a joke. They don't want to
[1:11:59] hear all the problems.
[1:12:02] They want happiness.
[1:12:05] Amen. God help us.
[1:12:08] God help us.
[1:12:16] He said, I I I'm just going here just a
[1:12:19] bit if you forgive me. He said, well,
[1:12:21] more than a disgrace to Jesus Christ,
[1:12:24] it's the church in disunityity, and it's
[1:12:28] before the coming of the Lord. They're
[1:12:29] losing
[1:12:31] and they're becoming of the Antichrist
[1:12:33] spirit on earth. And here we are. We
[1:12:36] separate by church barriers.
[1:12:40] Well, I'm a oneness. Well, I believe in
[1:12:43] the church order. Well, I believe the
[1:12:46] grace is over. And that's a lie. It's
[1:12:48] not over. Well, I believe that.
[1:12:56] And it here he goes. He says,
[1:13:00] he said, "And what are you anyhow?" He
[1:13:02] said, "That's right. What are any of us?
[1:13:05] nothing but what God would let us be and
[1:13:08] it's all the grace of God. So let us
[1:13:11] look to him and praise him and associate
[1:13:14] with our brother. He's talking about
[1:13:16] even if somebody has a difference of
[1:13:18] opinion,
[1:13:20] we can't even get groceries in the same
[1:13:22] store together.
[1:13:24] That's that's that's
[1:13:26] messed up.
[1:13:29] And if your brother's in there, don't
[1:13:32] push them down.
[1:13:35] He's as far as he wants. Now,
[1:13:39] this is another example. He said, "Try
[1:13:41] to lift him up." He said, "Love him no
[1:13:43] matter what." He said, "If you can't
[1:13:45] agree with him, just love them anyhow."
[1:13:49] Amen. Don't try to change them. There's
[1:13:52] people you're never going to change
[1:13:53] them,
[1:13:54] but you can still be kind to them.
[1:13:58] Amen.
[1:14:00] Don't you know which is which or where?
[1:14:02] He said, "I can as long as you're
[1:14:03] Christian. As long as you love God, I
[1:14:06] love you." He's talking about even if
[1:14:07] you were a non-believer or or weren't a
[1:14:10] Christian, he said, "I love you." And if
[1:14:11] you don't love the Lord, I love you
[1:14:13] anyhow. So, I want you to do I want you
[1:14:17] to do what? When you meet one another in
[1:14:20] the street, just be the greatest
[1:14:22] fellowship and friendship
[1:14:24] and joy with one another. And if you'll
[1:14:28] break down these barriers,
[1:14:31] You can get the joy of the Lord
[1:14:35] back in your in your body. Amen. Back in
[1:14:37] your soul.
[1:14:39] Amen. God, help us.
[1:14:41] God, help us. Amen. It's not our job to
[1:14:45] change people's doctrine.
[1:14:48] It's our job to be kind.
[1:14:50] It's our job to be happy that God has
[1:14:53] shown us the revelation of himself.
[1:14:56] Amen.
[1:14:57] And if you're happy, just just for a
[1:15:00] moment, just set aside all the people
[1:15:03] that are around you in your life. If
[1:15:05] you're beside yourself because you know
[1:15:07] who you are in Christ and you know that
[1:15:10] he not just only called you but
[1:15:12] predestinated and elected you and he's
[1:15:15] already he's already Romans 8:32, he's
[1:15:18] already glorified you
[1:15:21] in Christ's mind. You're already
[1:15:22] glorified.
[1:15:25] Amen.
[1:15:27] You should be bubbled with joy
[1:15:32] and the world would have a traffic jam
[1:15:36] trying to get around you.
[1:15:38] Amen.
[1:15:40] Because the world's looking for
[1:15:42] something
[1:15:43] that they don't have.
[1:15:44] They don't have security. They don't
[1:15:47] have salvation. Amen. They definitely
[1:15:49] don't have the joy of the Lord. And God
[1:15:51] never intended his family
[1:15:54] to lose their joy because they had their
[1:15:57] eyes on each other.
[1:16:00] Amen. If you look at what God did for
[1:16:02] all of us.
[1:16:06] Wow.
[1:16:07] Amazing. The joy that was set before
[1:16:10] him, he endured
[1:16:12] shame. Amen. All these things for me.
[1:16:17] For me, the joy of the Lord, the joy of
[1:16:19] the Lord is your strength. Do you know,
[1:16:21] do you know you will actually be
[1:16:23] stronger? Like the Bible says the joyful
[1:16:25] heart is like medicine.
[1:16:28] Amen. Depression will actually kill you.
[1:16:31] The Bible says the fear the men's heart
[1:16:34] will fail them for fear.
[1:16:38] it your your attitude and your your
[1:16:41] Christian domain and your spirit that's
[1:16:43] around you will actually affect your
[1:16:46] physical body.
[1:16:51] God help us.
[1:16:52] God help us to be happy. Just be happy.
[1:16:56] Amen.
[1:16:58] I'm you know if you're a witness say I'm
[1:17:00] serving the Lord and Jesus is my king
[1:17:02] and I'm happy about it.
[1:17:05] Amen. If the other person chooses not
[1:17:07] to, that's fine. This is where I go to
[1:17:09] church and these are the people I
[1:17:10] fellowship with and I'm happy about it.
[1:17:14] This is my family and I'm joyful. I'm
[1:17:16] happy with my family.
[1:17:18] This is where God planted me in Canada
[1:17:20] and Ontario and Wyoming and I'm happy he
[1:17:23] put me here.
[1:17:25] If God wanted you somewhere else, he
[1:17:26] would have put you somewhere else.
[1:17:28] Amen. God help us. Let's stand.
[1:17:33] Amen. Hallelujah. Joy of the Lord. Amen.
[1:17:37] Amen.
[1:17:41] I I just want to close with this. You
[1:17:44] the joy. He'll keep your joy if you keep
[1:17:46] your eyes on Christ.
[1:17:48] Amen.
[1:17:48] But if you look to brother Dale,
[1:17:51] Satan will show you something.
[1:17:54] Yeah.
[1:17:54] That'll make you sad.
[1:17:56] That's right.
[1:17:57] He will.
[1:17:58] He'll make you He said, "Oh, you know, I
[1:18:00] I don't think he should
[1:18:05] And you need to recognize that that's
[1:18:07] the devil.
[1:18:08] That's right.
[1:18:09] That's the devil.
[1:18:10] And you could you could talk back to the
[1:18:12] devil. Say, "Now, Satan, that brother
[1:18:14] Dale is my brother, but I'm not watching
[1:18:17] him. I'm watching the Lord."
[1:18:19] I'm watching the Lord.
[1:18:22] Amen. God help us.
[1:18:23] God help us. It's very, very simple,
[1:18:26] simple message, but you know, we we need
[1:18:28] to change. You know, we're peculiar
[1:18:31] people. Amen.
[1:18:33] And the world needs to recognize our
[1:18:36] joy.
[1:18:37] That'll be one of the first things they
[1:18:38] recognize is our joy.
[1:18:41] Amen. The joy of the Lord. And you you
[1:18:44] can't lose your joy.
[1:18:46] You can't lose eternal joy based on
[1:18:49] earthly circumstances.
[1:18:50] That's right.
[1:18:51] If you have no money in the bank, that
[1:18:53] don't affect your That don't affect your
[1:18:55] eternal joy.
[1:18:56] If you just had a car accident, that
[1:18:58] don't affect your eternal You're still
[1:18:59] glorified in God's
[1:19:00] eyes. Amen. If if one of your kids, God
[1:19:03] forbid, they get sick or even die, you
[1:19:06] still have eternal, you're already
[1:19:07] glorified in God's eyes.
[1:19:09] That joymen
[1:19:16] God help us. Amen. Let's sing that song
[1:19:18] we were before.
[1:19:23] Amen.
[1:19:26] Amen. I love this one.
[1:19:31] Thrill that I feel
[1:19:34] together.
