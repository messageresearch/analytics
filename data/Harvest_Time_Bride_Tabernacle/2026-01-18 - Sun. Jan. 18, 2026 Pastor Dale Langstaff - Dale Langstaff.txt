Let's sing that one more song. Come let us adore him. Oh come let us Yeah. Heat. A Hey, Heat. Heat. Wow. This position, God bless you. You very We're just amazed how many are here on a snowy day. We were coming. My wife was helping me drive very very I needed it. Believe me, the roads were less. Sister Donna, you're in the right place probably because man, we were coming down 80 highway and it was just straight ice. And then we came on 21 up here, you know, by the public school. And I thought, woo, the snow plows all got flat tires. It's like, w going way too fast. We we're thrilled you're here, but we wouldn't want anybody to be heart coming or sac, you know, be nervous about coming. And so we understand it's winter time. Amen. Amen. Just uh one quick announcement. I'm going to send out a an announcement more of a in detail uh on our church text this week. And so if you just watch our church text, just a kind of a thought we're going to change for this year. And uh uh so uh you just watch us this week and maybe I'll send out some things the prophet said and just uh different things. But uh uh I want to really this year I want to really concentrate on well brother Browns let me let me let me I can't I wasn't going to share this but we want to have our mission field at home first &gt;&gt; before we spread it abroad. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can't witness to the neighbor next door, then don't go to mission trip &gt;&gt; cuz those devils will eat you up and spit you out. &gt;&gt; They're waiting for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's many, many great needs right here in our midst. Unbelievable. &gt;&gt; Needs you have no idea about. Do you know there was people that went to our camp that were homeless this year? &gt;&gt; It just about took my breath away when I found that homeless. Hello. &gt;&gt; And they sat in our camp meeting August 1st. Did you know that? &gt;&gt; I didn't either. Wow. God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. We are we are today. You are Christ in flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we need to we need to recognize that the only Jesus the world will see. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; Is in you. &gt;&gt; You are Mrs. Jesus Christ. And the Bible's full of that. If you got a Bible question, I can give you dozens of Bible answers because God makes no mistake. It's not I make lots of them, loads of them. You know, you know, sometimes we come, you know, I believe in a pastor being, you know, a clean man and that, but you know, it was the word of God that the spirit fell on. You know, when the Bible says when Peter Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on him. &gt;&gt; Didn't matter who it was speaking them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; God spoke through a donkey to the prophet, he would have killed the do the prophet, &gt;&gt; if he wouldn't have finally heard the donkey, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; it's the word of God that matters. &gt;&gt; And the spirit on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's alive. &gt;&gt; It's alive. It's alive in me. And and I know it's alive in many of you. &gt;&gt; And if it ain't, I pray it is today after today. My title is when you see Christ Jesus face to face. Let's turn Deuteronomy 316. Deuteronomy 31:6. And uh we want to deal with something just just I just want to encourage you and encourage you and encourage you. And I I hope you'll encourage me that that God's in control. &gt;&gt; The world hasn't the world isn't just falling apart. It's already fell apart. It's been falling apart for many, many years. probably since at least the World War II or well since Christ left it's been falling apart. But but it really started after the Second World War. But God &gt;&gt; is nothing is done except he permits it for his perfect not permissible but his perfect will. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hey Deuteronomy 31:6. Be strong and it be of good courage and fear not. Be not afraid of them. For the Lord thy God, he is he that doth go with thee, and he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Now, that that is a pretty powerful verse. You know, I when you're still I want to read another one. Philippians 4:13, but I want to read the scripture. You know, be strong and courageous. Fear not, nor be afraid. For the Lord thy God, it's he that's with you. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he will not just be with you, but he would be inside you. &gt;&gt; He can't fail you. &gt;&gt; And nor will he forsake you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe I'll read this other verse and I'll share a testimony. Amen. Philippians 4 13. I can do all things through Christ. Yes, &gt;&gt; that strengthens me. Lord God, I just pray that you'll bless your people. Bless your word, but make it alive, Lord God. Make the letter kill, but the spirit give us life. May it just rebound off the pages in our lives. Lord God, we pray in Jesus name. Bless your wonderful saints this morning. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. God bless you. And those of you that drove very far. Wow. Brother, God bless you, brother Matt. You had every right to reconsider. But Amen. I know you love God. Amen. And and uh God bless you. You know, you know, Brother Bam, he gave an example of a a a Tesian well and it was bubbling up and and somebody came to the well and he said, you know, why are you so bubbly? Why are you so happy? And he and he said, you know, maybe it's cuz the deer come and drink by you and or the bunny rabbits or the the beautiful garden of Eden that's around you and the trees and everything else and and the and the well, if you could talk to the well would keep telling you, "No, no, you know, we enjoy the wild life and it was clean, but it was fresh, just anian well, fresh, alive." &gt;&gt; Men Men can't cap them. &gt;&gt; If they cap this one, it'll just pop up here. It'll pop up there. &gt;&gt; You can't cap You can't You can't cap God. &gt;&gt; You can do all you can to try to cap God. You know, you can put a sidewalk over the grass and it'll grow out the sides twice as thick. &gt;&gt; Now, well said. No, no, no, no, no. You're missing. It's not anything that's around you. Although I'm really happy you're here, but it's something down inside me. &gt;&gt; I'm just bubbling from way down inside me. &gt;&gt; It just bubbles. How does it bubble? Yeah, I &gt;&gt; it just bubbles. That's how God is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Be strong and very courageous. You know, we were getting the van fixed for Junior to come back this year. And uh you know, it didn't need nothing. And I was praising God that it didn't need brakes. And this is my short testimony. And it's been a real blessing because how many enjoy brother Junior when he comes here? You know, I sure do. And and uh if he didn't have wheels, he couldn't come most of the time because he he works the other side of Chadam. And we took the van in and and I knew that when I got in there, they said, "Oh, no. The brakes are good." You know, and it really needed nothing. Just little, you know, you know how vehicles are. Anybody get a vehicle repaired? Don't need nothing. Just the oil changed. And and we actually had somebody donate the tires. &gt;&gt; Like it was just put the tires on the rims. Like we didn't buy tires, &gt;&gt; you know, but there was just a little rattle in the muffler and just couple little things. The fan didn't work if you stopped. And I was thinking in my head, you know, I I was born before the automobile. Certainly before computers. I remember when the first one came out in school. It was as big as this pulpit. And and uh I was thinking, you know, that'll be like 4 or 500 bucks. And so I walked in with the the church checkbook, you know, and she dropped the bill down and and and that was 775. And I thought, "Oh, that's a little bit more than I thought." I said, "This is what I make the check out for." She said, "Oh, no, no, no. Turn it over. That's just the labor. She said, "That'll be 1,700." And I come out to the van and just for a second I forgot who I was. I told the way I said, "Well, that kind of took care of." &gt;&gt; She said, "Uh uh, you know, God gives us ways for a reason." She said, "Stop. If God's sending you somewhere, &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You know, I don't need that, man. I didn't fix it for me. &gt;&gt; If God wants us to go to Mexico, there goes my ticket to Mexico. Flying away in the man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when we get to the spot &gt;&gt; where God's the boss. &gt;&gt; You know, you I want I want to show you something. And it's not to offend you, but everything I say here, I'm going to give you scriptures. &gt;&gt; The problem today is not a lack of power. God's power. &gt;&gt; It's not a lack of God's power because he's Hebrews 13:8 says he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But it's a lack of your and my faith, &gt;&gt; in the God that we say we love. &gt;&gt; Even the God that we say is in tabernacle in us, &gt;&gt; and that's unbelief. &gt;&gt; So, you know, God owns the cattle on a thousand hills, but I'm worried about a church van. That's hilarious. &gt;&gt; I confess him as Lord of our life, but you're worried about &gt;&gt; the problem today is not a lack of God's power. &gt;&gt; The problem isn't with God. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; The problem is with Brother Dale. &gt;&gt; It's with Brother Dale. &gt;&gt; And the problem is that I I'm still got a little bit of me still alive. And I think I'm helping God, &gt;&gt; but God don't need my help. &gt;&gt; I mean, he likes using my mouth, &gt;&gt; but other than that, he don't need my help. He don't need my brains. He just needs my mouth. &gt;&gt; Cuz if it's my brain preaching to you this morning, you better run for your life. &gt;&gt; I'm a human. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Help us, Jesus. That's right. &gt;&gt; The proof of that is is in Romans 10:17. So then faith cometh by hearing &gt;&gt; and hearing, &gt;&gt; not by the minister, &gt;&gt; but by the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So faith cometh by hearing &gt;&gt; and hearing by the word of God. It don't matter who's ministering God's word. If you have faith in the God in the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to show you a couple people real quick and before we get into this meeting Christ face to face. There was many many examples in the Bible where people met Christ face to face and did a completely complete turnaround. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the this world, you know, I I if you if you think we have a problem in the church, I I want to just jump ahead of this. If you think we have a problem in this church, that same problem was here when Christ Jesus was on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Matthew and Mark both and we'll come to it because I'm jumping ahead of my notes, but he said he it actually says in Mark, &gt;&gt; it gave me great. He said Jesus was amazed &gt;&gt; at their unbelief. &gt;&gt; I was sitting on the same pew as Jesus. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; It said he did miracles and things in front of them. It said like it said he but because of their unbelief he could do few miracles. And it literally says in Mark that he was amazed. I'm amazed that when I share the word of God to people like just right out &gt;&gt; and they walk away from it. &gt;&gt; It's not me. &gt;&gt; It's not me that God told the prophet, "They haven't rejected you, Israel. They've rejected me, the prophet. They wanted a king." &gt;&gt; My goodness. God, help us. Yes. &gt;&gt; So the the the word So the faith cometh by hearing &gt;&gt; and hearing by the word of God. &gt;&gt; So hearing is not just hearing &gt;&gt; because the people that left could hear. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; but they couldn't comprehend. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Help us, Father. The person that you witness to on the street that don't want to accept Jesus Christ, they heard you witness to him, &gt;&gt; but they turned down Jesus Christ because they couldn't comprehend &gt;&gt; what you were talking about. &gt;&gt; They couldn't understand what you were talking about. &gt;&gt; Rahab the harlot in the walls of the city and Joshua 2 8-12. But I want to read this cuz she was one of these people that it it was a believer, &gt;&gt; an amazing believer. She said before she laid the spies down, Rahab, she come up to them on the roof. Now, now remember, I'm I'm just you you you that are regular in the church know me, but Rahab got eternal life because she lied twice. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Like that just like does brother Dale understand that? I've been working since my kids were born. Teach them not to lie. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; can we explain God? &gt;&gt; Well, Rahab's an example, but here she laid the spies down and she said to the men, now I want I want to just share something with you. Those spies never preached to her. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; She said, "I know that the Lord has given you the land &gt;&gt; and that tear had fallen upon us." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why don't tear fall on makeel believers? &gt;&gt; She was a harlot. &gt;&gt; She didn't know church order and doctrine. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; She didn't know church, period. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But she knew enough that terror had fell on them. &gt;&gt; And that all the inhabitants of the land has of the land is to faint &gt;&gt; because of you. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Remember the Bible where the the believers called Jesus beel the devil. &gt;&gt; But the devil said, "Why did you come before your time to cast me out?" The devil recognized the Lord, &gt;&gt; but the &gt;&gt; God have mercy on me. &gt;&gt; The so-called &gt;&gt; for we have heard. How did they hear? &gt;&gt; I know how they heard. I'll help you out. Instagram, &gt;&gt; Facebook, Messenger, it went on YouTube. We have heard how the Lord, how did you know the Lord? That the Lord had dried up the Red Sea and that you came out of Egypt and that you did to the what you did to the kings. &gt;&gt; And how you utterly destroyed them. Verse 11. And as soon as we heard these things, &gt;&gt; how many of your hearts are melting? this morning. &gt;&gt; She wasn't a believer. &gt;&gt; And her heart was melting. &gt;&gt; She wasn't even getting preached to. &gt;&gt; She wasn't here last Sunday. She had never sat in a church service and heard the word of God broke down. &gt;&gt; But her heart was melting. &gt;&gt; She said, "As soon as we heard these things, got to find where I'm at. Our hearts didn't melt and neither did there remain any courage in any man because of you for the because of you. Because of the Lord who's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your God that was she wasn't afraid of them. It was the God that those men were packing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She was afraid of the God that they were packing. We're not afraid of this thing, but that that's the God the God you represent. Whoa. &gt;&gt; The God you represent has given me the nerves. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, from the Lord your God and he is the God of heaven above and the earth beneath. She see like who gave her that revelation? She wasn't concerned about the lad the you know who's the cold war and the biggest army and &gt;&gt; he said Rahab we're talking about Rahab we're not talking about like the last church age &gt;&gt; the last church age locked Jesus on the outside of the church the only church age in Revelation locked him on the outside says &gt;&gt; will you let me back in Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He's the God of heaven above &gt;&gt; and the earth beneath. And now therefore, I pray that you'll swear to me by your Lord, not by yourself, but by your Lord, &gt;&gt; that you'll show kindness unto me, and show kindness onto my house, and give me I hear just that last word. &gt;&gt; What did she want? &gt;&gt; Token. &gt;&gt; A true token. Amen. &gt;&gt; She didn't want religion. She wanted God. &gt;&gt; She wanted the boss. &gt;&gt; She went right to the throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I recognize him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, when you see Jesus face to face, there's another one in First Kings 10 1:3. This is just I'm just laying a foundation. There was actually people in the Bible that believed. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was the Queen of Sheba. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there again that they had amazing Facebook and YouTube and and the the Instagram that was it was no government had shut it down on that day because she was across a desert that was loaded with pirates, bad men, no water, no air condition, no freeways. And the queen of Sheba heard the fame of the God of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord. And it didn't matter to her that it was on the other side of the desert. She came to prove him &gt;&gt; and to see if what she had heard &gt;&gt; was right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when Solomon stepped in front of her, he told her all her life story. Amen. &gt;&gt; In a book. &gt;&gt; And she said, "There was not anything that was hid &gt;&gt; from God." &gt;&gt; The king was God. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Solomon. &gt;&gt; It wasn't Solomon. &gt;&gt; It was the king. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in this day, it's not We don't need more power. We don't even need more of God. &gt;&gt; Can God get bigger? &gt;&gt; God's just God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end. &gt;&gt; The Sha. He's everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What we don't need is more power. We just need more plain faith. &gt;&gt; We just need to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just faith. The God is God &gt;&gt; and everybody answers to him. Do you know I I love Job. I I'm sorry I bring it up so often, but God said he said, "You can go this far." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you know that God's telling the governments of the land, "You can go this far." &gt;&gt; That's far. You can't go no further. Touch not the oil and the wine. &gt;&gt; We're still here. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they can't they can't blow up this earth till brother Dale's gone. &gt;&gt; Cuz God ain't leaving his bride here to go through a tribulation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No, he's taking her home for a honeymoon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the marriage supper of the lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the millennium, a thousand year reign. &gt;&gt; Can imagine the party. &gt;&gt; Amen. And here faith &gt;&gt; is what brings Christ on the scene. &gt;&gt; So he's here all the time. &gt;&gt; But if you need him, you have to believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing &gt;&gt; and hearing by the word of God. &gt;&gt; See, faith is brought on the scene. Brings Christ on the scene. And so, watch this. You know, sometimes brother Dale's weak in his thing and and I know you're not there, but let me give you an example of brother Dale in the Bible. You know, you can come and you can pray, but if you don't believe, why are you praying? &gt;&gt; Think you might as well save your effort? Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, you know when Moses was having trouble with belief, he came to Jesus when they came when the Egyptians came up behind him and Jesus said, "What are you talking to me for?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just speak. &gt;&gt; The ocean's in your way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just the Red Sea's in your way. Just speak &gt;&gt; and cross it. Haven't I given you power &gt;&gt; and authority? Do you know the Bible says that Moses was God &gt;&gt; to Pharaoh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he walked in his midst, the Bible says it. &gt;&gt; When Moses walked up, God showed up. &gt;&gt; And Pharaoh looked at Moses, he was looking at Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And anything Moses said, &gt;&gt; God backed up. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. I I show commercial break. They hadn't had the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They didn't have what you had. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They were still using lambs and goats to sweep the sin under the rug. &gt;&gt; But we got a perfect sacrifice in Christ Jesus where he can't even remember it no more. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Father. &gt;&gt; And you're crying and sighing cuz you need a bill paid. &gt;&gt; Just say, you know what? You know, brother, you know, you know, in your journey, you learn things off other people. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm just still in kindergarten spiritually, but I I'm just about to graduate to grade one. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, Brother Andre Andre Batit was here the one time and you know when he was in Haiti and they were missionary and and sending out books and he got a big bill for like $5,000 or something. He told her right here in this church and he had $5 in the bank account and he just went to bed and slept like a baby. You said, "God, that's not my bill." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm not promoting my kingdom. No, &gt;&gt; I am not on Haiti &gt;&gt; for a holiday. &gt;&gt; Say, God, you have a bill to pay. &gt;&gt; Guess what? If you don't pay it, you'll have no more kingdom. &gt;&gt; Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring. Hello. Hello. You know, I woke up this morning. &gt;&gt; And I was having you on my mind. And God said, you know, I'm way behind. I should pay some. I'm going to send you 5,000 bucks. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, God wanted to be in Haiti. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That was just proof. God wanted to be in Haiti. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, God still works that way. &gt;&gt; He sure does. &gt;&gt; But but we have to get in the spirit &gt;&gt; of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me show you example. Herod thought he was the boss. He was a superpower. He was sending nuclear subs and all this stuff over and he had captured the leader of a country, Peter. I'm dramatizing. Didn't Didn't Jesus give Peter the keys to the kingdom? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, they had flew in this country and they sabotaged all the soldiers and they captured the leader of this kingdom &gt;&gt; and they threw them in the inner jail &gt;&gt; and put guards on both sides of them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you know Peter never prayed? &gt;&gt; Peter didn't have no problem with jail. The males were free. &gt;&gt; See, see, you know, you don't know this, but it wasn't Peter's kingdom. &gt;&gt; It was God's kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there was other people that were concerned for Peter. That was nice. Lord. &gt;&gt; And so they went and they, "Oh, God, my buddy Peter the P. Oh, the leader. Oh, the church is getting, "Oh, God." So Peter comes and the little girl runs out like Leo runs out and he says, "So I recognize his voice." She goes back and, "Oh, no, no, no, no. We prayed, but you seen a ghost. We prayed, but you know, God don't answer prayer today. This is This is You didn't know that it snowed. God don't answer prayer. We prayed, but we didn't expect because, you know, you're just a child. You don't know. You You're mistaken. &gt;&gt; And then Peter's, you know, it was cold outside, so he's still not Hello. Oh. Oh, God is alive. &gt;&gt; So, this ain't a new problem. No, no. &gt;&gt; This problem's been around the church since it started in Pentecost. &gt;&gt; They didn't realize that God was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's all in Acts 12 6 to 7 6-16. Amen. And now if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost this morning, you have all the power of Christ that's in you. God give you his checkbook. &gt;&gt; All the promises in the Bible are to those that have confessed him as Lord of their life. &gt;&gt; There's hundreds, thousands. &gt;&gt; So, if you're packing the Holy Ghost this morning, &gt;&gt; you know, actually, I know it's, you know, this is it's hard for you to get, but you know, I'm going to show you. You know, uh, when you when you pray and you got the Holy Ghost, you know, it's all right. We look up to heaven, but but we but we got this. We have I'm changing God's changing your thing. God's just not in heaven. &gt;&gt; God's actually here, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Y, &gt;&gt; I'm looking at him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; And so, who do I pray to when I come to prayer meeting? &gt;&gt; I pray to myself. Yeah, &gt;&gt; cuz it's God in me. The Bible says it's no longer I that liveth, but Christ that liveth in me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So I don't have to send like a telegram. &gt;&gt; Do you know Do you know when the believer you know when Daniel prayed and Daniel and and the Lord never answered for 21 days, God sent the moment Daniel prayed, &gt;&gt; the moment Daniel prayed, God sent the angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Lucifer was there and it was a real war and he withtood the angel for 21 days. Now that angel was a little bit slow. He was still he was in pre kindergarten and it took him 21 days to call Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But when he called the Lord, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; the angel showed up to Daniel and he said, "I was on my way 21 days ago, but it took me 21 days to realize that God could fight my battles." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Took me 21 days to realize God could fight my battles. And the angel might not be able to conquer Satan, but there's one. &gt;&gt; There's one Lord. &gt;&gt; Jehovah Gyra. &gt;&gt; Amen. He would have no problem conquering Satan. &gt;&gt; When he was on the scene, it was just like war hands and &gt;&gt; pick him up. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Oh, wow. It's just amazing. So, we see I'm and I'm not I'm not trying to be disrespectful. I'm trying to to bring you up to where God wants you to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not hurting God. &gt;&gt; God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; that's living in you &gt;&gt; and you're like devaluating it &gt;&gt; father. &gt;&gt; It's worth more than gold. Gold top what? $4600 an ounce or something. &gt;&gt; Imagine the value of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They ain't they they they can't figure that out with earthly calculators. So it's the Holy Ghost power in you, &gt;&gt; but it's governed or operates by your own or my own belief &gt;&gt; in God. &gt;&gt; Faith, it's governed. And if you limit your belief or faith, then it's just plain on belief. &gt;&gt; Do you know that? You know, in in in James that it says that if you're guilty in part, you're guilty of the whole law. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, if you Oh, God help me. This it's really close. So, if you limit your God a little bit, you're guilty of the whole lot. &gt;&gt; Cuz if you insulted him that he might not be able to pay the God God can do a lot of things, Sister Margaret, but he couldn't deal with this hard problem I got. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So if you insult God and just well, you know, I'm everything's really good, but man, I got this thing that's &gt;&gt; You know what did the Lord tell Paul when he came back to him? He said, "My grace &gt;&gt; is sufficient for you." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mhm. &gt;&gt; So here here and I got I got to get to my first character, but here in Matthew 13 in Mark 6, but let me just read what Mark said. Jesus said unto them, he said, "A prophet is without honor in his own land and by his own country and among his own kin and his own house." So Jesus had the same problems as today. That's why, and no offense, you you are wonderful. But that's why when I travel, the people go wild. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's just Bible. I mean, you can't help it. I can't help it. That's just reality. &gt;&gt; And God said to and Jesus said that he could dare do no mighty works save that he laid hands on a few people. And you don't wonder why. Oh, there's a few little things happen in the church, but no blowouts. It's not God's problem. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; He said save. He laid hands on a few sick and a few were. That's not diminishing that he did that. Th this was Jehovah, by the way. This wasn't a minister. This was God in flesh. &gt;&gt; But verse six of Mark 6, and he said he marveled. at their unbelief. &gt;&gt; God, God God Christ Jesus even did some miracles in front of them. And God and God marveled. The people didn't recognize &gt;&gt; the presence in their midst. &gt;&gt; Help me God. &gt;&gt; Help me Jesus. &gt;&gt; You know, that's why the Bible says, you know, if you were going to another land, do not even prepare what you would say. Don't take your wallet. Definitely don't take plastic. Don't take money or cares. Cuz see, if you're on a mission for him, &gt;&gt; he'll tell you what to say, when to say it. &gt;&gt; He'll give you food. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He'll give you food. &gt;&gt; He'll give you food. He'll pay your bills for the van &gt;&gt; to have a minister come and preach in your midst. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Because it ain't the minister's bill. &gt;&gt; It's God's bill. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you a story. Me and my wife went somewhere Friday. Very few of you know where it was. For you that do uh forget. And we knew the situation was difficult. So we took some hamburger, some patties, took some yellow green beans that my wife was upset that I canned in the summertime. She put them in the jars though. But I kept buying it. They said they're half price. I just buy everything. And actually my wife got the revelation after. She said, "You know, maybe this winter there'll be people that we have to feed. And God knows in the summertime why I bought bushels, bushels with an S of yellow green beans." And we took a little box of muddy potatoes and sweet potatoes. We were there to eat supper. And the lady and the boy grabbed those potatoes in front of us and peeled them. And that's what we ate when we were there. What were they going to eat if I hadn't come? &gt;&gt; And the meat we ate had been given to them by another family member. And when I came home, I was hungry. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; That's in this place. &gt;&gt; And they were at camp meeting. And they were at camp meeting. &gt;&gt; I was stunned. Stunned. Amen. She told us, &gt;&gt; she said, "I had $4,000 in income last year." 4,000. She said, "And I have all my bills paid." So, I just have a little bit something here on my visa, and I think I got something coming in that's going to take care of that. Some people know that God's real. &gt;&gt; Some people know that God's real. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's up to you. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; First John 3, behold what manner of love the father has bestowed unto us that we shall be called sons of God. Therefore, the world knoweth us not because it knew him not. So don't be surprised because you're not popular. Beloved, now now, right now, are we the sons of God? And it does not yet appear, but we know. All right. Now, can everybody see this? Do we got this up here, Vicki? &gt;&gt; But we know that when God shall appear, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's the next word say? That we &gt;&gt; shall be him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. that we shall be like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't be like God if you're not a part of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's Genesis 1:26 and 27. And God said, "Let us make man in our image." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we shall be like him because we came from Genesis 1:26 and 27. And let us make man in our image. And we shall be like him. &gt;&gt; For we shall see him &gt;&gt; as he is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know how you see the flesh of God? &gt;&gt; The flesh of God. God bless you, Sister Jesus. God bless you, Sister G. Oh, here. Oh, that's all right, Sister Jesus. I'll pick that pen up. God bless you, brother Jeff. Jesus. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Jesus. G. Brother G. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; you are now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not when you get to heaven. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; and you when he shall come &gt;&gt; that's when you recognize him, you shall be like &gt;&gt; like &gt;&gt; like the same as &gt;&gt; him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:26. You can see me where I'm going, Vicki. Be not forgetful that you entertain strangers. See, you didn't realize it. &gt;&gt; For whereby the same have entertained angels. &gt;&gt; Oh, I thought that was just so angels. You didn't recognize the presence. And what do the angels do in heaven? Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Amenise &gt;&gt; angels unawares. Amen. Let your conversation be without covetishness. I want to stop there for a second and God's preaching to me this morning. Covetness. What is the meaning of covetousness? This is wrongful desire. &gt;&gt; Help me God. especially towards wealth or possessions of others. &gt;&gt; Let's go back to the scriptures. Let your conversation be without covetousliness. However you how you &gt;&gt; covishness &gt;&gt; covishness, forgive my English, but you can see it up there. And that word means a wrong wrongful desire especially in wealth or possessions of others leading to discontentment and sin. Now Google told me that Google told me it was sin. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Google told me that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Be content. There's such things that you have. For he saith has said, I will never leave thee. &gt;&gt; I'll take care of every situation. I'll never leave thee, nor will I forsake thee. He's got everything in control. Exactly what I'll never leave thee, nor I'll forsake thee. So that you that we may be boldly safe. &gt;&gt; Boldly, not childly say. boldly say that the Lord is taking care of this situation that I will not fear whatsoever a man can build me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let scripture alone you just forget watching the news. Who cares when war starts? &gt;&gt; I'm not fearing. &gt;&gt; I ain't going to be here. Verse eight. Cuz Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Philippians 4:13. And I got to get to my actual message. I'm not I haven't even hit my message yet. Philippians 4:13. I can do all things. &gt;&gt; I can do everything &gt;&gt; through Christ. &gt;&gt; The strengthens me. Everything &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How's this allow doubt to come in? The only way is is lack of belief &gt;&gt; is unbelief. &gt;&gt; And and I promise I won't preach forever, but I I need to I'm still laying a foundations here in Romans 8. The best chapter you can ever read in your life. I'm sure is Romans 8. There's I mean there's some other Ephesians 1 is a good one, too. I love predestination and election, but watch this. this in Romans 8. Let's start at verse 26. Likewise, the spirit, this is talking about God. Likewise, the spirit of God also helpeth our infirmities. And we know not what we shall pray as we ought, but the Spirit make his intercession for us with groanings. &gt;&gt; Amen. that cannot be uttered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Now watch this. Now this still this is still God. This is still God. This Amen. And God searches the hearts and knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints to the will of God. Now I want to just tell you something. I would appreciate like you know one of the greatest thrills of my life people around that's there's a good thing about the internet people tell me so I I had people tell me on the I pray for you every day there's people sitting here so may I pray like it's hard for me to comprehend that I'm not sure I pray for myself every day every &gt;&gt; day every day &gt;&gt; but I want to show you something God. Yeah. You don't appreciate the prayers of the saints, but Jehovah &gt;&gt; intercedes &gt;&gt; for the saints. God, when God starts praying for you, look out. &gt;&gt; My God intercedes for the saints. &gt;&gt; For we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to him that is called according to his purpose. So if you're a Christian, you're called because if you're a Christian, you're not your own. &gt;&gt; So it's a purpose of Christ. &gt;&gt; For whom he did forno, he did predestinate and conform to the image of his son. Remember how I said you were pardon? &gt;&gt; And that he might be the firstborn of many brethren. Verse 30. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, he did call. And whom he called, he did also justify. in whom he justified, he also glorified. Verse 31. And what shall we say then &gt;&gt; to these things? &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'll make it. &gt;&gt; Got an awful bad government right now. &gt;&gt; No, don't don't put that in there. &gt;&gt; It says, "But what shall we say then? &gt;&gt; If God be before us, &gt;&gt; Yes. But if God be before us, then it don't matter who wins &gt;&gt; because God already won. &gt;&gt; If God be before us, then who can be against us? And what shall separate? He that spared not his son but delivered him up for us all. How shall he not then so freely give us &gt;&gt; part of our needs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All things. Thank you. &gt;&gt; All things. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Verse 31. Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? &gt;&gt; Do you know the only person that can criticize you? Let's give a minister great hope. &gt;&gt; The devil. &gt;&gt; It's the only person. Who's the accuser of the brethren? Satan. &gt;&gt; Satan. So if it comes out of somebody's mouth, they've yielded to the wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; Who shall lay anything to the church of God's elect? It was God that justified me. It was God that called me. It was God that placed me. It was God that sent me. And I send all the bills directly right through to him. He just takes care of everything. You know, by next Sunday, my hair will probably be straight black by then. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is he that condemnth? &gt;&gt; It is Christ that died rather raised again, even as at the right hand of God also maketh intercession. There he goes again. He's praying. You you can you imagine maketh interc Christ Jesus Lord of lords &gt;&gt; is praying for you to make it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; You were praying for your lost loved ones, &gt;&gt; but Christ Jesus is praying for them. &gt;&gt; Wow. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? &gt;&gt; Who Who's going to do it for you? &gt;&gt; What's it going to be for you? &gt;&gt; Shall it be tribulation, distress, persecution? Maybe it'll be famine for some of us, nakedness, peril. or fear the sword war. But verse 37 says something. Says, "Nay, and all these things. &gt;&gt; We are." &gt;&gt; Not just the preacher. You are. &gt;&gt; And all these things. If you're in Christ, you're more than conquerors through him that loved loved you before you loved yourself. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor heights or depths, or any other creature shall be able to separate me &gt;&gt; from the love of Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's in our Lord. Amen. That's the kind of life &gt;&gt; that God's looking for. I want to just show you and we're going to wind it down, but I'd like to give you a couple examples at least in the Bible of people that met Jesus face to face &gt;&gt; and completely did a 360°ree turnaround. In 2 Kings 6:8, the king of Syria had war against Israel. And we go to verse 11. And the king of Syria, they had war against Israel in verse 8. And they had come down to defeat Israel. But it just so happened that God had a prophet in the land. It just so happened, maybe it was say it another way, just so happened that he had a real Christian in the land, one that he could talk to. &gt;&gt; But in this case, it was a prophet. And it didn't go so well for the king of Syria. See, they thought they were the superpower. And they thought they would overpower the rest of the world. Israel was a big part of the world. &gt;&gt; And everything that the king of Syria did, Israel knew about. And Israel, the king of Syria came to his people and he said, "We have a traitor in our midst." Now I just want to tell you something that Syria were pagans. Wicked unbelieving worldly non-believing pagans. No god of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they had enough belief in the God that you struggle with to believe everything. They said, "King, stop." that they have a man of God in their midst. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't think you Thank you, sis. They have a man of God in their midst. &gt;&gt; And what you speak in your bed chambers, &gt;&gt; that guy hears in his ears. &gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This guy's preaching. Preachers aren't supposed to preach unless they're Christians. &gt;&gt; This is a pagan. Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is a &gt;&gt; Syrian. &gt;&gt; Never went to church. &gt;&gt; Never read the Bible. &gt;&gt; Don't believe in God. &gt;&gt; What's he doing preaching? &gt;&gt; Cuz he has seen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has seen. You can't unsee what you've seen. &gt;&gt; Seeing ain't just seeing. He has interpreted the power. &gt;&gt; Power. How could the the man of God understand what the king says in his bad chambers? &gt;&gt; And how could God get a worldly person to to preach that, testify that publicly and the king's throne? And we're struggling. Wait up. And we were struggling. and you were struggling about your problems in your life. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You don't think God hears your prayers before you can even speak them &gt;&gt; when those worries pass through your line and your hair changes color. &gt;&gt; Like if he can have a man of God hear what the &gt;&gt; Wow. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, very foolishly. See, this was the king of Syria. It was his people that knew the truth. But he was still needing a little help. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, we're going to go get this man of God." Oh, sometimes we're really slow learners. Now, you know, if that king would have logically thought about it for a moment, &gt;&gt; that the god he was going to get could tell the people what he thought in his bed chambers, did he think he was going to just go up and take him? &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; I mean, he he needed some uh you know, he needed, you know, an evaluation. Yeah, that's the word I was looking for. He needed a psychological evaluation. And so he went down to get this man of God. I love saying man of God. Woo. He went down to, you know, anybody that serves the Lord is a man of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Anybody that I no longer live but Christ that liveth in me is a man of God. Woman and man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of man of God's here this morning. &gt;&gt; And the woman came from the man. So it's also a man of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Oh wow. Something just come to me. God wants me to tell you something. Do you know in Revelations, maybe this is more for people that are young or are visitors. You know in Revelations when John looked and seen the the the hinder side of Jesus Christ, you when you go home, you look in your Bible, you know what it said? It said it looks like kind of looks like a man, but it was the bride of Christ. It was a it was a woman man because Christ because we were in him &gt;&gt; and John couldn't interpret what Christ was because the church &gt;&gt; was inside the body. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so he identifies a man and woman look together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Christ had actually taken you to his self. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Re that's just Bible revelations. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he comes down and you know the man of God uh he there's not one speck of problems here. You know he knew exactly who he was serving. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but his servant that was with him, his, you know, it wasn't his bodyguard cuz he didn't need a bodyguard, but, you know, the person that carried his suitcase and brought the food and maybe his Bible, cuz the man of God might have had a, you know, a bad leg or something. &gt;&gt; And his servant woke up. Verse 14. Therefore the king of Syria sent hither horses and chariots and great hosts and they came by night and compressed the city. Verse 15, that's where it went. And the servant of the man of God, the prophet Elijah, raised up early to cook him breakfast, and was gone out. And behold, the host compressed the city with hords and chariots and servants. And he said unto his master, he said, "Awake." He woke him up. Said, "Wake up, Elisha. We're done. This is it. We done went to the cartels took us over." Said, "Last master, this is it. How shall we do? We're finished." And he answered, Elisha answered him. He said, "Fear not. This is where our song came from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For there's more with us than be with them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of people don't know that. &gt;&gt; We're on the winning side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With feeders and furls, &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell the whole world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise &gt;&gt; that my God is captain and guide. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's not to fear. &gt;&gt; Cuz he's always near. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. No matter how fierce the enemy might sing horses and chariots cuz we're not going to give in. That'd be impossible because he dwells within &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; with Christ. We have the victory. &gt;&gt; He said there's more with us than be with him. And Elisha prayed and he said, "Lord, open that poor boy's eyes. &gt;&gt; Open I pray. I pray, my prayer this morning is God will open your eyes. &gt;&gt; Not to me, not to this church, but to him. &gt;&gt; Y &gt;&gt; open your eyes. &gt;&gt; And you got a little situation, you just send that right over. Just put that right over in the the God box &gt;&gt; your mind. And just I tell you what, you know, you do this. You know, you know, when you're married a long time, you get to understand your spouse. You know, when when you get a God box and you say, "Honey, pay the hydra bill." Then it's gone. It's just completely gone. It's in the sea of my forgetfulness and I'll never remember it no more unless I get the second bill in the mail. And then I normally have to repent. I said, "But honey, I I I but you know, when you tell God, you don't have to you don't never get the second bill." &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz when you just put it in the se the God box, you you can keep your brown hair, your black hair, &gt;&gt; prayed, and opened his eyes. And the Lord opened his eyes, and the young man saw, can you imagine? Can you imagine the change in his new mirror? And behold, the mountain was full of horses &gt;&gt; and chariots. Amen. &gt;&gt; And fire &gt;&gt; around Elisha. &gt;&gt; And he just went, "Wow, I never seen God before, but wow." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Elijah walked right out in the enemy camp. He walked right out in the enemy camp. He walked right up to him. He said, "You can't see me, can you? You can't see me." And they said, "We're looking for Elisha." He said, ' Okay. Will you come with me? We're looking for Jesus. Will you come with me? Come with me. And he brought him right in the king's chamber. Said, "We're still looking for El." So I sound like some people in church. We're looking for God. We're We're I wonder. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. You run into him. Oh. I can't. I never seen nothing happened in a long time. &gt;&gt; Like the boy that went fishing. He asked his mom. He asked his mom. He said, "Ask my mom." said, "Where's God, mom?" Oh, I don't know where God is. You'd have to ask the the the the Sunday school teacher. Sunday school teacher. She was a mom, too. And she said, "Oh, I don't know where God is." You have to ask the preacher. That preacher wasn't a man of God. &gt;&gt; Said he was a preacher, but he wasn't a man of God. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Oh, I don't know where God is." &gt;&gt; Father, &gt;&gt; boy went fishing with an old man. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And nobody thought he was a man of God, but he actually was a man of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz he just went fishing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He didn't stand behind the pulpit and wear t. I hope I get that revelation. And &gt;&gt; yeah, &gt;&gt; little boy said, "You know, you know, pops, I asked my mom and the Sunday school teacher &gt;&gt; and and the the the preacher that wasn't a preacher, &gt;&gt; and nobody could tell me where God was." Yes sir. &gt;&gt; A man just started old tears. &gt;&gt; Said everything I look at God. &gt;&gt; I look at a tree and God made it. &gt;&gt; I look at my brother and sister and God built them in his image. &gt;&gt; And I look at my &gt;&gt; I look at the sun and it reminds me of the son of God. And I look at the the rain and it reminds me of the Holy Spirit in the water coming down the river. &gt;&gt; He said, "I put a fish out and the life's He recognized God &gt;&gt; because God was &gt;&gt; God was like a light in the inside that was turned on. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, God is exactly as big as you believe he is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And God can answer your prayer &gt;&gt; just as much as you can believe he can. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's exactly how big God is. &gt;&gt; Now, my God in that case is very big. &gt;&gt; Amen. cuz I have situations I can't take care of. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, I just put them in the God box. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I just put them in the God box and say, "God, thank you. &gt;&gt; We'll talk again soon." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My last my last example, and I bet you I have a dozen more, so maybe next week will be the same &gt;&gt; if God allows me to. I want to talk about Acts. Acts 9 1:5. And I'll close. I promise I'll close. See, you know, we mentioned last week when when God comes in our midst and you recognize that God's in your presence, it's it's a supernatural feeling. &gt;&gt; And I just tell you something, he's here this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; It ain't is I just just just to clarify something. It's not brother Dale in the preaching. &gt;&gt; If if you think that you just I I just feel so sorry for you. &gt;&gt; But you can be a vessel surrendered to honor. &gt;&gt; He's the potter and I'm the clay. &gt;&gt; And he's making a vessel of honor. And he never throws away the clay &gt;&gt; cuz he can patch up. He's the greatest patcher &gt;&gt; and it's brand new &gt;&gt; here. Saul and and you know the Bible can just tell it even better than I can. But I just go through the first verse here. Saul was a very religious man and he believed in God. But he had a wrong god and he didn't believe in the Jesus Christ the New Testament God and see Jesus had came and so Jesus was the perfect sacrifice. So the veil of the temple rent and twain and there was no more needed of killing of lambs and goats. But they thought that Jesus was was just a preacher and they thought it was blaspheme. They didn't see the God in the man. That's the problem with everybody today is if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the other Holy Ghost will recognize. &gt;&gt; So when you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; my Holy Ghost recognizes that. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Saul was yet breathing out threatenings and slaughters against the disciples of the Lord, but he was a believer. Now, I'm going to tell you something that still happens today. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you know that, but I've had a few of those. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I probably have a few notes in my desk there. Threatenings and slaughterings. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Against the disciples of the Lord. And they went and he went to the high priest. Now this was actually the people in the church. So they were good Christians. I mean they had they had like gold on their building. And he desired him letters from Damascus to the syn the synagogues that if he should find any way whether the man woman they man or woman sorry might be brought abound to Jerusalem that believes in Jesus. In verse three and as he journeyied near Damascus a bright light came down from heaven. See, Paul was thinking he was serving God, but he was stone blind and and he wasn't serving God at all. Now, I want to just clarify something in our midst. Now, I can clarify this scripturally, but I'm going to tell you, Jesus was not on earth when Paul was alive. &gt;&gt; He had been crucified. &gt;&gt; Paul was converted after. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay, we understand that. cuz I've been preaching something all day. And some of you, if you're doubting what I'm preaching, I'm going to show you right here in the Bible. And as he journeying, he came near in Damascus. And suddenly a bright light shined around him from heaven. And he fell on the earth and he heard a voice saying unto him, Sa, why persecute thou me? Now just just Vicki, if you can work with me, let's go back to verse one. And Saul was breathing out threatening and slaughters against the disciples of the Lord. Not against the Lord, against the disciples of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Against the disciples. Let's go back to verse four now, Vicki. Thank you. And he said, "Saw saw why persecuted thou me?" And Saw is now about to become converted. And he said, "Who art thou, Lord?" How did he know that? &gt;&gt; Well, one thing was the power of the the the delight, the power that had brought him to his knees was greater than any power he had ever received before. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he might not have full understanding, but he knew that that was supernatural &gt;&gt; to humble him and he called it Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord answered him, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Lord." Let's go back to verse one. Back to verse one. And Saul was breathing out threatenings and slaughters against the Lord's disciples the against the disciples of the Lord. Okay, let's go back to verse 5. And the Lord answered Saul and said, "I am Jesus." Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Well, Jesus was not on earth. Oh, remember Mrs. Jesus? Remember brother Jesus? Jeff. Yeah. Brother Lawrence, brother Jesus. Sister, brother Jesus. &gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Now, God can't lie. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. But Jesus wasn't on earth. &gt;&gt; I I don't think you're catching it. &gt;&gt; Who was Paul killed? He Who was threethreatened? The disciples &gt;&gt; of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And the Lord &gt;&gt; made no disclaimer. And he said, "Jesus, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How persecuted thou for it's hard to kick against. &gt;&gt; You know, you can't fight God. &gt;&gt; There's a few people are going to find that out in the next, you know, maybe in 26. Oh, bless God, you know. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But God, my God's still God. &gt;&gt; I mean, he's he's the top of the pyramid. &gt;&gt; Everybody goes through him. &gt;&gt; Even if you don't recognize him, you still go through him. &gt;&gt; Go. And if you read further in that scripture, God told Saul what to do. Rise and go to town. And God sent one of the the man of gods. Oh, I love that. And God sent a man of God by to witness unto Saul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he changed his name to Paul. &gt;&gt; See, you didn't think you were Jesus. It's good to meet you, Mrs. Jesus. I mean, if the Lord calls you to I mean, &gt;&gt; like, who am I? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; See, when you when you meet him face to face, it changes every Yeah. You know, I'm just going to close on this. Just forgive me. Just this one verse. Just close. Genesis 4 and 4. You know, who was it when Cain and Abel offered their sacrifices? How did Abel know that it was blood? How did I'm even going to close this, so I forgive me for going on. I just I just It's hard to stop. How did Abel know? &gt;&gt; How come Cain didn't know? &gt;&gt; It was God. &gt;&gt; It was God. Praise God. &gt;&gt; God gave Abel a revelation &gt;&gt; that it was blood. &gt;&gt; The sin in the garden was blood. &gt;&gt; And it was going to be blood to wash away all the sins. &gt;&gt; And here Abel brought a sacrifice of a lamb. And his sacrifice was disgusting. They never had gold on their church. &gt;&gt; Do you think Abel's sacrifice in the garden was near as pretty as Kane's? Kane's had like he had trees on steroids &gt;&gt; and God said I've rejected Caines &gt;&gt; and I've accepted Abel. Now nobody told them &gt;&gt; but God &gt;&gt; supernaturally. &gt;&gt; God had gave Abel a revelation that it was blood that takes away sins. And you know and I'm going to close on this. A merciful God came back to Cain and said, "If you will take the sacrifice of your brother, if you will be as your brother, &gt;&gt; you will also &gt;&gt; be forgiven." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you also will come to the revelation that there's more with us than be with them, we're on the winning side. No matter how frustrated this world gets, &gt;&gt; everything is you can go this far. Do you know that that the everything cannot explode until God takes his little bride home? Amen. &gt;&gt; And there's I could probably give you one dozen scriptures, but we'd have to be longer to prove that. One is Joseph put his his bride in the palace, his gentile bride in the palace. Why? He revealed himself unto his brothers, the Jews. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No harm will hurt his wife. &gt;&gt; But he's wanting you to come into total belief &gt;&gt; that I am he. &gt;&gt; Jehovah Driver. Come, honey. Amen. Yeah. Amen. When you meet him face to face. Wow. It takes a relationship. &gt;&gt; I can't give it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can show you what it looks like in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's amazing grace how sweet the sound &gt;&gt; to save the wretched like me. I once was stone blind, but now I'm found. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amazing grace. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe we'll sing that song. It's been a long time. Amazing grace. Amazing. Heat up here. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh, heat, heat. Heat up here. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat up here. Oh, hallelujah. When we Heat up here. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord God. Hallelujah. Blessed be his name. Amen. Let's sing just as we close. Let's sing All D. There's a story in Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat up here. Yeah. Heat. Heat up here. Lord Jesus, forgive me. I struggle sometimes. Lord, I forget that you can take care of it all. I'm sorry for helping, God. Help me get to that place, Lord God. No matter where it is, you have everything in your hand in control. And nothing in this world and nothing in my life goes past where you allow. And Lord, I forgot about the scripture where you said that you wouldn't give us anything more than we could contain, more than we could bear. Sorry, I forgot about that one, Lord God, when I tried to help your kingdom and bitterly failed. Lord God, you know it's all yours. We worship you. We know you're more than able. And death, and bankruptcy, and famine, peril, set, world calamities. It's hard sometimes, God. But when we're in you, when we remember, when we remember you, when we see your face, it's okay. Help me, Jesus. Help me, Jesus. Raise my faith, Lord God. Just help me to let go and let God have his way. Just let go. Just let God take care of everything. Hallelujah. All is well. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Bless these amazing people. Came in a terrible day weatherwise. Thank you for your presence. Thank you, Jehovah. Hallelujah. Our provider of everything you need is in Christ Jesus. Sing the chorus one more time. All is well. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
