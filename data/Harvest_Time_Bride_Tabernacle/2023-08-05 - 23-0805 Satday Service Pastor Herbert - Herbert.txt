to me Lord I receive [Music] all things [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] all the things [Music] amen amen we can visit a little bit and then amen praise the Lord amen someone sang and said I was happy when they say done to me I was happy when they said unto me I was happy when they said unto me let us go to the house of the Lord amen people should feel happy to come to the house of the Lord they should come and I'm happy to be here in the house of the Lord well my names I'm rather Herbert makoba from Uganda and I would like to present my greetings from my home Church my Uganda brethren much greetings to you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I do appreciate very much if I can go back into a memory about your appearance brother Daryl black staff and your wife and the brother Jose Garcia we were glad to receive you in Uganda and we were very happy with the job that was done in Michiana and how people believed and they took baptism it was a very good image in the sight of the Lord may God continue to bless you Brothers and it has been in my heart to say let me go under see how my brothers are doing there and I'm glad the Lord has allowed me to come praise the Lord amen so I will not waste time but I will straight away go to the world and I will speak from the bottom of my heart whether we are few I don't care whether we are two or three the Bible says Jesus said where two or three are gathered I am in the Emirates so therefore we are glad that he is in our Midwest and I want to speak from the bottom of my heart what the Lord will put on my heart because a man cannot live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth from the mouth of the Lord it may be just a small word but it is of great effect God gave Jonah a very little word on a paper go and tell the people of the Navy that within 40 days time if you repent or not you will die it was not many pages it was just very if you could write down it was very small something on a small paper but it was carrying a lot of importance to the life of people it was so tremendous that if you cut if you could listen to those small words on the paper you live if you not listen to those small words on that paper and oh those are very rewards you cannot live so we are glad everyone that comes from here we live by that amen can we stand up now uh we shall turn to our Bibles in the book of Matthew chapter 10 and then the book of Romans chapter 10 all of them are chapter 10 chapter 10. so Book of Matthew chapter 10 which already from verse 41 verse 41. then the book of Luke I mean Romans chapter 10 verse 14 and 15. let's read he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that to receiveth righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward then let's go the book of Romans chapter 10 14 and 15. how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and I bring glad the tidings of good things Father Here we are your children Lord God I call upon your presence into these scriptures may you father expound this word our souls because even one soul is so tremendous in your sight you preached through your Prophet One in a Million that was so tremendous father may your word edify us here both body spiritual and our spirits father we need your blessings forgive us in anything and Lord that we may be precious before your sight granted is my prayer in Jesus name Lord we pray amen we may be seated so my dear brothers and my dear sisters I want to from the holy Oracles of God let me bring out something especially from The Book of Matthew where we have read ah verse 41 he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet his reward and he that receiveth righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward so I want to talk about how we receive our prophety's reward that's what I'm going to concentrate I want to concentrate very much on that how to receive a prophet's reward that is nice now how we can receive a prophet is reward there is a program with God this God says data how then shall they uh how how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed that is a question how can we call on him in together in a straight line not a crooked line but a straight line so that the result the good result is a reward from God praise the Lord that is it so therefore we find that in the Book of Matthew God is talking about he who will receive a prophet so that one who is talking is our Lord Jesus Christ we can take him so then if he sends a prophet then we must get him then we we must also be a true receiver because he's talking like this he is talking like this whoever receives so that means we must have a true receiver so therefore these three people we are talking of all of them must be true now what about God um important omniscient forever he remains a true God he has never changed he is always a true God and when he sends he also sends a true prophet that's right so it intends you he intends that this true Prophet will be received by who by the true receivers Ary so the three if you change one then things don't go right now we have confidence in God that for him forever and ever eternity he remains a true God but who can change the only person who can change is may be a prophet because it's a human being the only person who can change is maybe a receiver because he's a human being but God when he chooses he chooses a true prophet he says like this that Jeremiah before he was born God knew him from his mother's womb therefore God chooses always our true prophet so why do how and why that some people they miss a reward why it's because they make the line crooked okay I will I will bring an example a good example we want to line up some good example of prophets from the Bible we shall start from the book of uh maybe uh the book of First Kings chapter 17 you will find out that the word of God came to Elijah Elijah Tish bite is God who sent him so when he sent to him how did he do he had to test him he had to build in him a good foundation a good foundation of obedience because God always he does his things in order when he wants to do something he builds it on a strong Foundation if it pertains the word of God he builds it on a an obedient Foundation and an obedient Foundation is always very very strong that's how God does so so he started like this bite and then he line is him so the word of God that's the number one we have already started with the number one God he's looking for a second person then he finds Elijah Tish bite and then he sends to him so the Bible tells me that uh he sent to him let me read it there okay okay okay let me read that the book of Foster Kings yes chapter 17. that's right aha first king chapter 17 let me read I will start from uh verse verse 2. and the word of the Lord came unto him saying get the hands and Eternity Eastward and hide thyself by the Brook that is before Jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the Brook and I have commanded the Reverend is to feed thee there that's fine and so he went and the day that according unto the word of the Lord for he went and dwelt by the Brook carries that is before Jordan now imagine imagine God is sending Elijah here things that are odd it's not simple it was not used or that people should go under dwell by the river whenever he could send people he sends them to people's homes where there is a home where they can eat well and sleep well but here he sends them him to a river and then he reveals to him that I have already prepared I have already talked because I'm a Creator I talk with all the creation I command every Recreation as I did command in the time of Noah two by two to go to the to the to the to to the to the ship or maybe yes that he built the ark I commanded the animals to go to the ark I have also commanded the Ravens who regardless of their situation whether they have a bad history that in the time of Noah they did it only the dead bodies and rebelled so you have no question I am sending you go under dwell by the river Calif I have commanded the Robins they will feed you so don't ask whether they pick food from the from the garbage whether they pick from where whatever no need of imagination is you just believe so it was such a a very hard situation but God is preparing this money here to be a true obedient prophet a true obedient prophet who can it be of great profit to others Hallelujah okay now here the Bible tells me that and he went and the deed according according not doing shortcuts no reasoning capacities no saying how no question he just went and indeed according to the word of God but what is God intending to do he's intending to bring out a reward through as straight prepared lion of obedient people because God himself is ever righteous is ever holy and his other obedient and that is ever good now he is preparing a very good conduit a good way how he can send the blessings to God to flow so good smoothly to the destination praise the Lord yeah Here Comes Paul understand something in the book of Hebrews chapter 10 verse 35 is there he says like this cast not away your confidence that has a great reward that after you have done after you have done God needs you to do his will so that he can send his reward to flow so smoothly to you because God is he has never been a liar he's always a true God it is we human beings who make things hard it is we human beings who smear him pots but he's always holy and righteous God it's we who only amend ourselves it is the we who correct ourselves and line up in the line so that we can receive the promises so that we can receive the promises praise the Lord all right let's go ahead so we find out that here goes Elijah and stays by the river Gareth and the ravenis brings some meat we don't know where it was from but this man became so obedient because it was God and sometimes even Jesus said for their sake I sanctify myself so therefore Elijah was sanctifying himself foreign and become of a great prophet or a great reward to a certain third believer to defend the person remember that we were aligning here three people God in the middle of prophet and lastly a true receiver because Jesus said whoever receives a prophet so we we need to be so there was a certain Widow so this Widow was a true receiver so God was intending but before he sends Elijah to a widow he prepares the things he prepared the Ravens he said I have already done that I have commanded the rabbits then he prepares a widow she will receive a prophet because he said how will they receive or how will they call on him of whom they have never heard of and then he said how will they go except they are sent that's right so God prepares everything and our job is just to line up and be obedient and then we do according to the word of God through who through a prophet uh let's go back at the that we are seeing the book of we are still in the book of First Kings but before you go to the book of First Kings let me read something here a quote let me read a quote here of brother Branham about this woman here the uh that Widow about that Widow the prophet says like this uh yes in this message reaction to an action he says like this then she had she started to turn again and she heard the voice saying but bring me one fast what do we learn here seek you first the kingdom of God how will I meet it I can't tell you but you put God first seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness all these three things all these things will be added bring me fast one obedience when God is the prophet says a certain thing do it hold on to it that's right now here goes Prophet Elijah God is preparing a line God is preparing a conduit to wear the blessings where the true reward goes through to a final destination and reaches the final person so now here comes Elijah to a home of this Widow but God tell him that God tells Elijah that arise and a god to verifiers of his Eden I have I have already done this again I have commanded the widow woman to feed you I've done that so however he goes of course the woman will also try to resist but a good Prophet always he corrects the error and he tries to bring you back to the line because this woman what did she do she started it look at the circumstances and then she started the reasoning she did not go very quick on the line as a true receiver but he was trying to dodge she was trying to stray but because a prophet is already in God's program he knows what is he doing then he started to say but that's why Prophet Branham also quoted that thing that but that means he is trying to correct the error but bringing me fast right until she obeyed when she obeyed oh quickly she lined up in the line praise the Lord when she lined up in the line things went so well I tell you how life changed they were living in the time of famine they were living in a time of trouble oh yeah they were living in the time of death because even she confessed with her mouth you know anything you have to confess it with your mouth she said I have just little I with my kid we eat and then we die so they were living in a time of death that was our expectation praise the Lord but now when the prophet comes he corrects the error he brings her back to the line and when she lined up I tell you miracles happened Crews of oil never wasted the pan of the floor it it remained miracles what happened she ate she ate she became so good she was transformed Here Comes Paul unders says in the Book of Romans chapter 12. I beseech you brethren don't be confirmed like this world but rather be transformed so this woman here started to transform our life and she became a Christian she became a question people asked how come everyone looks skinny everyone is just bending to death looking to the soil how cows that you walk upright and you are happy and you are glad what happened tell us a mystery the mystery is I received a prophet and now I have a reward of what you see in my home praise the Lord I tell you when we line up we don't make God headaches we make him happy if we can line up in the word of God Things become so easy Hallelujah that is what happened she received a prophet is a reward also if we don't go very far it was in the mind of Jesus to speak and remind the Pharisees that you for us is here I am fulfilling the scriptures in the book of Deuteronomy it was written that God said I will give you a prophet like you Moses and the weather will never receive all listen to him will be cut off so I have come in that category in that room to fulfill the scriptures and now you are trying to stand crooked you are straying away from the line he was blaming them and here he was reminding them let's go to the scripture let's read the book of look chapter 4. let's read the book of Luke chapter 4 verse 25. that's right okay it is here on the my screen but I tell you the truth many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias when the heaven was shut up three years under six months when great feminine was throughout all the land yeah keep on rolling but unto none of them was Elisha sent and a woman that was a widow you see how Jesus is bringing the things he says always things are in order how can they Colony him of whom they have never heard and how can they go except they are sent now here comes Jesus remaining these forces telling them reminding them about the Widow that means this is for us is are refusing because they are going to call him bills they are going to doubt in him they are going to call him son of he has no a proper father bastard is seed maybe whatever so therefore Jesus is saying oh you see in the days of that Widow the days of Elias the window of Sarah Peter there was no one who was sent there except it was Elijah and no one received the Elijah except that Widow now what are you doing you are trying to misconstrue or to stray the line to let the conduit be zigzag and that you miss the promises and you missed their words he was blaming them praise the Lord he was blaming them because he was reminding them so therefore he did not end there continue he's going to talk about it we want to bring another Prophet again and that will be Elias himself the one who received the double portion from Elijah Contin my brother because I can see you putting you on the screen uh-huh another verse and all there in this synagogue when they had these things were okay let me open myself and read it there The Book of Luke I think another verse 25 verse 25 you are on 28th I wanted verse 25. but I tell you of the truth that's 25 verse 26 again [Music] okay I won't read about uh Elias 26 okay that's right let me go there myself uh-huh but verse 27 and the many verse 27 under many Reapers Where in Israel in the time of Elijah's they profit and none of them was cleansed saving in a man of the Syria you see why is he quoting me he's quoting me he's going back to the courts we have some believers who don't believe in quoting I wonder what they want to do quoting is not bad and also quoting as a purpose we have some we have some two Disciples of Jesus Christ who wanted very much to court but they had a wrong spirit they told Jesus that do you want us to qualify from heaven and ban these people like he did Elijah then Jesus rebuked them that no you don't know what kind of a spirit you have so that quoting was wrong but this quoting that Jesus is also quoting is good so therefore we believe in two things we believe in quoting but it depends on why are you quoting that's right so we should totally not deny quoting quoting is good also quoting has a purpose with some preachers they can caught but with a wrong spirit praise the Lord so here our Lord is quoting with a purpose that's right like I'm quoting here I'm quoting with a purpose sure that's true so he's talking about Norman because all of these people there they rewarded that they received was the change of their bodies that woman the word that she received was a change of her body because when you don't eat you get so lean skinny until you die that's right and also with the mama when the leprous continues it eats you until you die amen so we live by the word of God so the Bible tells me there was a young lady who was gotten from Israel God touched her and she reminded The Mummy the mistress in the home can you approach Daddy and tell him that dra is a prophet in Israel if he can go and line up in the line and become a true receiver whoever receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophetess reward so I'm explaining how it was how it was meant to be if my master can go to Israel and line up and don't have any question is regardless of which prophet he will find God will use that one he will receive a reward and that reward will change his body and then here goes Naman and he carries all kind of prizes and all kind of things and then he goes to the headquarters of Israel thinking that things per thing is pretty cool things can be done with the political Affairs no political Affairs does not even do anything to our spiritual so when he reached the headquarters of Israel I think maybe they made the big gun gun shoots under big parade sand salutes is because all the all other nations were panicking because of nerman he was a victorious man in fighting he was killed he was a champion everyone from trembles the Bible tells me that he had done a lot of victories and when he reached Israel they must give him respect and I know they did it I know when presidents they when they visit other countries they give them big respect and The Poets and so on and they can pray the national anthems and so on so all that happened but it was not going to help so when he reached to tell the purpose where he went to Israel he said honorable king of Israel I came here because there's good news that when I come here you know how you can cleanse me from leprosy oh that was beyond the possibility of king of Israel he started crying I saying oh that's the only way how he's looking for work oh I can't but God who's rich in the mercy takes the news to a a true prophet to a second man in the middle one is God second is a true Prophet third must be a true receiver then the reward comes so here Elisha says send him to me because behind me there's always there's a true God and I am true let him come and line up to be true he will receive a reward Hallelujah he will receive a reward then here comes in a man he reaches the premises of Prophet Elijah now Prophet Elijah says the true receivers according to this time they must be obedient only to The Voice there is no need of seeing a prophet then gaining faith it's time of just obedient The Voice yeah that's true we have some Believers in this message who are awaiting Prophet Branham to come back under pressure to them that is wrong we have some of them who wants him when he comes back and then they go and then in they kneel down and then he touches them and then he prays for them that will not work it is in the time of The Voice we have heard the voice we do according to the voice we are not Thomas we are in the time of faith Thomas says unless I see him under Luke and then he touched and then I can believe no need of that so here comes normal and Elijah picks from the house and the sense only their voice listen to The Voice and when the voice came this man he said oh what is he saying go under deep in River Jordan and then it starts imagination and comparing under whatever he's refusing to line up he says I thought he would come up and touch me and a bit and do this and I do everything and whatever that's what I thought and then he started the fuming and any thought I thought it would come and I see and find out what kind of a very important man is talking to and that cannot walk in the kingdom of God yes brother Joseph in the kingdom of God there is no important people all of us are children of God now I thought all these ranks all these escorts surrounding me all these presence all these words that I have if we would have come and looked at these things he would have trembled so quickly understand what I need because so all that he thought was out of line it cannot work we are talking of God builds things on an obedient Foundation God wanted him obedience is when a prophet of God it tells you something to do it do it let's go back again before I finish this let's read something in the book of yeah fast Kings chapter we shall read the two verses chapter 17 we shall read verse 5 and verse 15. let's read verse 5 chapter yeah First Kings uh verse five says this is now the prophet isn't it so he went and did according unto the word of the Lord that is number two in the middle so let's see number three verse 15. roll down verse 15 quickly aha number three a true receiver and she went and indeed according to the saying of Elijah what happened things went so smooth that's what we do some people want to be just robbers Through the Windows and Jesus said don't be a widow don't be a robber Don't Be Fifth friend how did you come here he says and then he says you did not go through the door so some people want to meet God Through the Windows no it cannot work it must be through the door where things are lined up our Prophet said stay in the line why did he scream like that he knew things that people who do stray from the line other ways that's why they want to create denominations out of the message that's why they are doubting the message that's why they are doubting the prophet that's why they are falling away it's because they have refused to line up brothers and sisters we are on a right Channel we are on a right line we must continue whether people fall Let Them Fall if they live let them live but you follow these examples that I have told you things are very good Hallelujah we are on the right track no worries no worries we are on the right track praise the Lord now Elisha what brought him on the line the Common People the Bible tells me the common people had Jesus gladly when he preached the gospel the Common People received him gladly that's right the Common People the low ranked people who are the escorts of Norman who are just normal people they are the women who convinced him they're the ones who quoted for him they said if a prophet they even mentioned if a prophet maybe he never regarded him as a prophet but they men should understand if a prophet tells you something can't you do it sir maybe maybe we can sir I tell you they convinced him until he came to the eye so never question when God tells you to do something never fume never member never question never give why and how no just do it be obedient amazing then this poor man of God what he did he humbled himself and he says now what do we do I think now this was became the Consultants the community people became consultant so what should we do they said let's go how many times you do we deep seven what about you too will be enough because it was a fearing Jordan it's because it was comparing remember he said that we have Urban river which is so good decorated with a lot of things very beautiful It's Not Like Jordan so he was fearing you see we were not given a spiritual fear so he was fearing and comparing things but they kept on convincing him sir go all right let me go then dope then he started no you have not fulfilled ah enough they said if you will reach seven times oh we tell you a fun day we tell you sir we tell you all honorable it will be good they confess they convinced him and when he did 70 times a quick reward came on him [Applause] he received a new body Hallelujah keep on keep on dipping believers keep on dipping keep on dipping in Jordan we shall receive new bodies [Applause] there's no worries just listen to The Voice the prophet is not here but the voice is coming listen to The Voice do as he says we shall receive new bodies [Applause] we shall continue with our summary tomorrow God bless you God bless you amen I love him bye because [Music] love I am [Music] very once again I love him ah [Music] be because if [Music] just my soul is shown [Music] Hallelujah [Music] ah nothing because [Music] love ever just myself [Music] Lord Jesus
