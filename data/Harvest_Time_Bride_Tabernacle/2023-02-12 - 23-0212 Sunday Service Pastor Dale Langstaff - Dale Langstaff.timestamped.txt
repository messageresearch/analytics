[29:43] this and some you have not but
[29:45] uh it's important for you to
[29:51] be part of

[30:22] let's turn to Genesis 1 27 and you can
[30:26] work on that Genesis 1 27 and uh I
[30:30] preached this many many years ago and I
[30:32] had this message laying out for well
[30:35] weeks literally probably two weeks at
[30:38] least maybe three

[30:55] back home I have a thought in there
[30:59] where God gave me on and I do have
[31:03] another title but it's a kitchen table
[31:05] and you will be amazed at the things in
[31:07] the Bible
[31:09] that are
[31:10] preached or supposed to be preached or
[31:14] ministered for the benefit of Christ
[31:18] from the kitchen table
[31:19] it will blow your mind I'll never do it
[31:21] in one sermon
[31:22] and some of the scriptures are so
[31:25] profound that it it would be that if you
[31:28] missed out on doing it it would
[31:29] blaspheme the body of Christ that's how
[31:31] some of the scriptures I wrote it's just
[31:32] it's just unbelievable just
[31:34] I mean it's really really really
[31:36] powerful but I just felt really the tug
[31:38] to come this way also also just maybe

[38:20] amen
[38:21] you see or however you are shorter tall
[38:24] our Prophet said that God
[38:29] made you exactly
[38:32] how he wanted you and see if you
[38:34] pictured God and and we know just to
[38:37] help you in this we know that God's a
[38:40] spirit
[38:41] okay but we talk about God as being a
[38:44] body
[38:45] so we'd have to think of him as a spirit
[38:48] body
[38:49] but for us to get the picture in our
[38:52] mind let's think of an actual body
[38:55] and so when you came this morning if you
[38:58] are going to go back to God you came
[39:00] from God or you ain't never going to God
[39:02] because the definition on Google and the
[39:04] dictionary is to be Eternal you always
[39:07] were
[39:08] so you're not coming to the altar with
[39:09] the great evangelist and getting saved
[39:11] and then going to heaven
[39:13] if you came from hell that ain't never
[39:16] happened
[39:16] amen
[39:19] so you came from this body
[39:22] that's a spirit
[39:24] this body
[39:27] you can't see my toes but
[39:34] and everybody that's part of the Bride
[39:37] is a part
[39:39] one part of that body
[39:41] and God himself
[39:44] is uncomplete
[39:47] if you're not
[39:49] that's why the the the the the the in
[39:52] the fullness of time
[39:54] that's a saint without us or not make
[39:58] complete
[39:59] until we're all back
[40:01] in the spirit body
[40:04] called Jehovah
[40:06] and so you this morning you are excited
[40:09] exactly you are not
[40:10] I realize you got a thee off any body
[40:12] and all that but just even in your
[40:14] personality and character
[40:16] you are exactly who you are
[40:20] but you came from God
[40:22] and you don't like it
[40:26] and you don't like it
[40:29] and you don't like it
[40:33] now if you could comprehend and get in
[40:35] the mind of God just try to think where
[40:38] God's
[40:39] working that out
[40:43] God sent you here
[40:46] is a little toe
[40:48] or the heel
[40:50] that's what I think that's what I know
[40:51] I'm an eel most days
[40:55] for the year or the low or whatever
[40:59] and then no and you say God
[41:03] I want to facelift
[41:05] I don't want to be who I am I don't I
[41:07] don't want to be I don't want to be a
[41:09] minister I don't want to be I don't want
[41:11] to be a father I don't want to be a
[41:12] mother I don't want to be
[41:14] I don't even want to be
[41:22] wow
[41:25] for his purpose
[41:28] for his purpose now the purpose of you
[41:31] being here today
[41:33] had nothing to do with you
[41:36] it had everything to do with Jehovah
[41:40] and his plan
[41:41] that he would prove to Satan that the
[41:44] second Eve would never fall
[41:50] and the reason she wouldn't
[41:53] well he okay we would fall and he would
[41:56] redeem us but the reason we would never
[41:58] fall in the end is because he put
[42:00] himself
[42:01] called predestination seed
[42:04] into us
[42:07] amen and so until the sun hit that seed
[42:10] or until we recognize her until somebody
[42:12] poured water on it or until somebody
[42:14] kicked the dirt and it wasn't quite as
[42:15] deep
[42:16] or the warm War weather hit it
[42:22] amen
[42:24] and you just thought you were here to
[42:25] make a big bank account
[42:28] care less about your bank account
[42:30] unless you surrender it to him
[42:32] then he's
[42:34] can use it for its Glory
[42:37] amen
[42:38] this is huge maybe just a
[42:42] maybe just delay
[42:45] a foundation here let's just read a
[42:47] quote
[42:48] and the repo reproach for the word of
[42:51] God in 62. now let's just see what the
[42:54] prophet said he said every man that
[42:56] comes
[42:57] to Christ must be trial change proud
[43:01] child trained sorry for a purpose
[43:05] that
[43:07] that God
[43:09] has ordained
[43:12] amen you can't change you can't it's
[43:14] it's um you can try but you're going to
[43:16] look like a fool you cannot change who
[43:18] you are
[43:19] because God won't allow you to he's
[43:22] going to show it and remember if you can
[43:24] just keep quiet now remember if he
[43:26] called you for this there's nothing
[43:29] there's nothing that can keep it
[43:33] from happening
[43:36] period
[43:38] there's not enough devils in torment
[43:43] but what God's word will be manifested
[43:46] because his word was his thoughts and he
[43:49] wrote them in creation
[43:52] amen and but God's word will be
[43:55] manifested and you were born
[43:59] you were born
[44:02] for a purpose
[44:05] and the purpose has very little almost
[44:09] nothing to do with yourself
[44:12] but this is a self-society
[44:15] it has everything to do with Christ and
[44:20] the body
[44:22] that's why the scripture says when one
[44:23] cry we all cry when one rejoices we all
[44:26] rejoice
[44:27] when one's happy we're all happy
[44:30] amen because you you're a body
[44:34] and so you feel the pain when I had if
[44:37] you know which I don't have and I
[44:39] because God's healed me but when I hit
[44:41] an earache my body hurt but if my body
[44:43] wasn't my ear
[44:47] if you don't think so just hold your
[44:50] finger out and I'll take a hammer and
[44:51] I'll just drive it
[44:53] and I'll turn the Nail Blue like my dad
[44:56] used to get a lot and then the nail
[44:57] would kind of fall off
[44:59] and see if that don't hurt down your arm
[45:01] and up your back
[45:07] that's why you got to be careful how you
[45:09] treat the body of Christ
[45:11] that's why parent you got to be careful
[45:12] how you treat your family
[45:14] because they're not yours they were Gods
[45:16] before they were yours
[45:18] he just trusted you enough to borrow
[45:20] them to you
[45:21] amen
[45:23] God help me
[45:25] preaching to myself and nobody you know
[45:29] I'm reading this exactly what our
[45:30] Prophet said and nobody
[45:34] you get that
[45:35] and nobody
[45:38] can take
[45:41] your place
[45:43] there's not a single person in the world
[45:46] to take your place
[45:48] and you might have impersonators
[45:51] and everything else and they will never
[45:57] they will never take your place right
[45:59] God's word will Triumph
[46:02] it can't fail and there's where every
[46:05] Christian ought to stand knowing that
[46:07] the truth will come up and seem every
[46:10] way to you but remember
[46:14] he goes right back to it but remember
[46:16] God has a purpose
[46:21] and he knows it'll all work out
[46:25] all right
[46:29] wow
[46:31] I don't mean it's going to be easy some
[46:34] of you Scott
[46:36] hard roads that you're plowing amen
[46:40] God God but and and you know what I
[46:44] can't explain it
[46:46] some of you have had will have hard
[46:49] lives or trials or something's coming or
[46:52] and you cannot just
[46:54] you can't explain it other than say God
[46:59] as a plan
[47:01] and he seen a film
[47:03] and in this film
[47:06] it always ends good
[47:10] don't matter how the middle is it always
[47:12] sounds good I was thinking when the kids
[47:15] were singing up here
[47:18] and I could see Brett
[47:20] I said God he'll be there no matter what
[47:23] no matter what I I won't take no
[47:26] I won't I will not accept no it's not
[47:30] possible
[47:32] it's not possible
[47:35] amen
[47:37] the Ecclesia eye sticks I believe I'm
[47:39] saying that right three one Amy let's
[47:41] pull this up and I'm going to take my
[47:43] time because because if I just don't
[47:45] finish this
[47:46] we'll just finish it there you know also
[47:49] I just this comes to me
[47:51] and I I'm sorry it just was I was
[47:54] supposed to say something to this you
[47:56] know Satan tries to hinder it fits in
[47:59] God's purpose
[48:01] you know we were taking meat down to
[48:03] brother Emmanuel and Madam in Woodstock
[48:07] Friday and you know we're just cruising
[48:10] down the 401 and my what's up starts
[48:12] ringing and
[48:15] it was brother Ben NORAD
[48:18] amen no we're gonna we're gonna get on a
[48:21] big chat pretty soon today
[48:23] brother Ben said
[48:25] I I Luanne answered it
[48:27] and she said he said
[48:30] my Visa just got denied for Uganda
[48:36] now I know for a fact that brother Leo
[48:38] has five sermons five messages booked
[48:41] for Saturday
[48:44] for Saturday
[48:47] can you imagine
[48:51] and I just said to brother Ben you just
[48:54] made me have a heart attack
[48:57] because I understand what that'll mean
[49:02] see God
[49:05] and literally 20 minutes later
[49:08] see if we get in the place where
[49:11] something happens
[49:14] we're we're literally believing that the
[49:16] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[49:18] of the Lord
[49:19] and and
[49:21] that way so like if I don't come back
[49:24] one of your brothers are going to take
[49:25] this church
[49:27] and you're just gonna or or if one of
[49:29] your kids God forbid or something see
[49:31] because it's God
[49:33] believe me we we don't want that I want
[49:37] to come back but it's God
[49:41] 20 minutes later the phone rings again
[49:45] and it was John Gary
[49:50] I said we must be doing something right
[49:52] brother Matt
[49:53] because Satan's losing his mind
[50:00] he said you know I'm about to die
[50:03] and brother Dale I can't believe I'm
[50:04] turning you down this close to Sunday
[50:06] but he said
[50:08] it's a
[50:10] it's physically impossible for me to
[50:12] come
[50:14] on I joke with the way I said well I
[50:17] said the next phone call is going to be
[50:19] the plane crashed or something I mean I
[50:22] don't know
[50:23] I'm okay with that
[50:27] see
[50:29] but but but but what do we say but not
[50:31] even Satan
[50:35] can hinder
[50:37] God's plan
[50:38] see God already knows who will be there
[50:40] and he already knows who will have some
[50:44] kind of a see see the Bible says that
[50:47] one plants one Waters and God gives the
[50:49] increase but he knows the personalities
[50:51] and the clicks and and the atmosphere
[50:54] and the
[50:56] and he knows who's got to be fed to be
[50:59] saved for eternal life
[51:01] and he knows like even though we
[51:04] pre-planned he might just switch those
[51:06] plans
[51:07] and say I gotta have I gotta have
[51:09] somebody else
[51:10] behind the wheel at that time because
[51:13] there's going to be somebody coming from
[51:18] and we say but I don't want to be that
[51:20] person
[51:22] and God's like oh I got to deal with
[51:24] that again
[51:33] and everything there is a season and a
[51:37] Time
[51:40] I don't think you've seen it for every
[51:42] purpose
[51:44] under the heaven
[51:46] a time to be born a time to die time to
[51:48] plant the time to pluck up
[51:50] that which has been planted time to kill
[51:52] and the time to heal and the time to
[51:54] break down
[51:56] the time to
[51:59] time to build up and the time to weep
[52:02] and the time to laugh and a time to
[52:03] mourn the time to dance the time to Cast
[52:06] Away stones and a time to gather Stones
[52:08] together the time to embrace
[52:11] the time from to refrain from embracing
[52:14] a time to keep and a time to Cast Away
[52:16] the time to render and a time to sow
[52:19] the time to speak in a Time To Love
[52:23] the time to hate
[52:24] and the time
[52:25] to have peace
[52:27] but he got
[52:29] has made everything
[52:32] including you
[52:34] and your situation
[52:36] to God
[52:38] your trial
[52:40] for you
[52:42] beautiful
[52:44] the pride of life
[52:46] that bring us character and form us into
[52:50] the Final Destination that we'll be and
[52:53] that's the only thing that's going in
[52:55] our glorified body
[52:58] whoa
[53:01] Isaiah 46 9 10 and 11. remember the
[53:06] former things of old that I am God and
[53:10] there ain't none else
[53:12] I'm God
[53:14] I
[53:15] I don't think the people that believe in
[53:17] the Trinity read this scripture
[53:20] I mean maybe you should fast forward it
[53:22] to them
[53:24] and there's none
[53:26] like me
[53:27] verse 10 declaring the end from the
[53:29] beginning and from the Ancients of times
[53:32] and the things not yet done saying my
[53:35] counsel self my counsel
[53:38] shall stand
[53:40] and I will do all my pleasure
[53:44] calling oh man my wife's not here to
[53:48] help me
[53:49] calling arabious birds from the East and
[53:52] a man that exalted my counsel
[53:56] from a far country
[54:01] and you thought I was just going to
[54:03] Uganda for a holiday
[54:08] yay I have spoken it
[54:11] I will bring it to pass
[54:16] there we go again
[54:18] for I have purposed it
[54:22] I also
[54:24] will do it
[54:28] wow
[54:33] wow
[54:35] Pilate in John 18 30 pilate said to
[54:40] Jesus
[54:41] he said our doubt then
[54:44] the king of the Jews
[54:47] and Jesus here's Jehovah God we know
[54:49] this is Jehovah God here saying he said
[54:52] thou saith I am the king
[54:56] and to this end
[55:01] was I born
[55:05] to this end
[55:07] you were born
[55:10] and it wasn't regarding careers
[55:14] or jobs although you do need to have an
[55:16] income
[55:17] but it was regarding the kingdom
[55:19] of God
[55:21] to this end
[55:23] you were born
[55:25] to complete
[55:27] the plan of the kingdom of God
[55:30] oh it's beautiful Hallelujah to this end
[55:33] I was born and for this cause put this

[55:49] and you thought your mommy just wanted
[55:51] to have another boy

[56:15] know you
[56:18] knew me
[56:19] and in the womb he said I can't have a
[56:22] girl because he won't preach
[56:29] that's that's I mean whoo

[1:02:01] that the wise and The Prudent they
[1:02:04] didn't catch it
[1:02:08] wow
[1:02:11] here in 50 in the face in action here's
[1:02:14] here's our Prophet saying here's a quote
[1:02:16] he said how can you Moses here's Moses
[1:02:20] one man lead two million people to the
[1:02:22] promised land
[1:02:24] how can you do it
[1:02:25] because God said so
[1:02:29] Perry
[1:02:31] amen
[1:02:32] When God says so
[1:02:36] and he the Moses was Vindicated by the
[1:02:40] angel came down and talked with him and
[1:02:42] told him that he was barred
[1:02:48] for a purpose
[1:02:51] and here here our Prophet is making it
[1:02:53] into a story he said and Moses put his
[1:02:56] faith into action and that's what it
[1:02:58] takes no matter how much Faith you got
[1:03:00] if it if it won't be used it it won't do
[1:03:04] you no good if you don't use it
[1:03:07] that's right
[1:03:08] he said what good is what good I love
[1:03:12] this part he said what good is the god
[1:03:13] of Moses
[1:03:16] if he ain't the same God
[1:03:19] today
[1:03:20] we know he is
[1:03:24] here brother Brown said many times
[1:03:26] multiple times if you study this message
[1:03:28] which which I do amen multiple times the
[1:03:33] prophet said born for a purpose
[1:03:36] there was different
[1:03:37] for our purpose
[1:03:40] I was born for ways he talked about it
[1:03:44] and he Moses and Elias and in himself
[1:03:49] and in you
[1:03:51] the one quota I already read
[1:03:54] amen Psalms 33 11 Psalms 33 11 the
[1:03:58] Council of the Lord standeth forever and
[1:04:01] the thoughts that's his purpose in the
[1:04:03] new IV version
[1:04:05] it's purpose and his purpose of his
[1:04:08] heart
[1:04:09] to all
[1:04:11] Generations
[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:16] here in Proverbs 19 21 and I wrote down
[1:04:19] both so I'm and so you can put up the
[1:04:22] King James but I have the King James
[1:04:23] here but I want to read the new IV
[1:04:25] version because it's got different words
[1:04:28] in it
[1:04:29] man
[1:04:31] and this is the new IB in Proverbs 19 21
[1:04:33] many other plans in the mind of a man
[1:04:36] but it is the purpose
[1:04:39] it's the purpose of the Lord
[1:04:42] that'll stand
[1:04:44] it's the purpose
[1:04:47] now and the King James said many are the
[1:04:50] devices in the heart of a man
[1:04:51] nevertheless the council so they got
[1:04:54] counsel instead of purpose
[1:04:56] but the counsel and the purpose of the
[1:04:59] Lord
[1:04:59] is going to set
[1:05:01] God chose you where to plant you God
[1:05:04] chose you to be born here or move you
[1:05:07] here or place you here or give you your
[1:05:09] house or you think see everything you
[1:05:12] thought you decided but it really wasn't
[1:05:14] that
[1:05:15] God met your needs you thought it was
[1:05:19] because you worked
[1:05:21] huh
[1:05:23] wow
[1:05:25] God help us
[1:05:31] God help us
[1:05:34] man many many people here we could look
[1:05:37] at and we're going to look at a few and
[1:05:39] and uh
[1:05:41] of the purpose of God you know the
[1:05:43] prophet said
[1:05:45] even King Isaiah
[1:05:48] which I love preaching about King Isaiah
[1:05:50] and the prophet that was in his time
[1:05:54] amen the prophet Isaiah was in the time
[1:05:57] of King Isaiah and King Uzziah thought
[1:05:59] he was above the purpose of God
[1:06:02] he wanted to be somebody he wasn't
[1:06:07] and he pushed it
[1:06:10] you know what I'm saying
[1:06:12] God give them a king and give him
[1:06:14] millions of dollars and he said but I
[1:06:16] want to be a priest
[1:06:18] I want to be a levite
[1:06:19] and he went to the house of God
[1:06:22] and the Levites said you know King bless
[1:06:24] King you're a wonderful King
[1:06:27] but
[1:06:29] but
[1:06:30] King
[1:06:34] the king you're not supposed to be here
[1:06:39] and he defiled the temple of God and did
[1:06:42] the sacrifices
[1:06:46] because he wouldn't listen to the man
[1:06:48] that God had put in place
[1:06:51] God struck him with Leprosy and he died
[1:06:55] he died
[1:06:57] with leprosy
[1:07:01] and all he had to do
[1:07:04] was listen to One Man
[1:07:06] or even before he would listen to that
[1:07:09] man not stepped out
[1:07:12] of what's God's ordained purpose was
[1:07:16] for his life
[1:07:18] now see this watch this see sometimes
[1:07:20] we're
[1:07:22] it's possible you could not be sure
[1:07:25] and see if you weren't sure and you
[1:07:27] stepped over here
[1:07:29] somebody else's position
[1:07:31] God will be Duty bound
[1:07:34] to bring you to somebody and say hey
[1:07:37] I think you just stepped out of your
[1:07:41] and you could just step right back in
[1:07:43] line
[1:07:44] and everything be beautiful
[1:07:47] but that's not what king Isaiah did
[1:07:51] wow
[1:07:56] man
[1:08:03] during the influence 63 I'd like to read
[1:08:05] a quote here he said
[1:08:08] don't never try to take other people's
[1:08:10] places
[1:08:12] now I'm reading exactly it's on my iPad
[1:08:15] I found it once I got here
[1:08:17] he he said he he he our Prophet said God
[1:08:21] Made You 92 times
[1:08:25] God don't make no mistakes
[1:08:28] so if you don't like me
[1:08:30] I understand because there's things
[1:08:32] about me I don't like to
[1:08:38] but just maybe
[1:08:41] it's up to you you can decide but just
[1:08:44] maybe if I was part of God
[1:08:47] and you don't like me
[1:08:49] you're walking on Dangerous Ground
[1:08:54] I I I would be really careful because it
[1:08:57] now if I'm not from God then you're okay
[1:09:01] you decide
[1:09:03] but if if somebody just happens to have
[1:09:06] come from God
[1:09:08] and and you just happen to attack that
[1:09:10] person
[1:09:16] ouch
[1:09:18] I just say ouch
[1:09:21] I'd hate to see what you look like
[1:09:24] when God gets done with it
[1:09:29] and that
[1:09:32] God made you a certain thing and you
[1:09:35] stay that way certainly you say just
[1:09:37] what you are don't try to impersonate
[1:09:39] another that's always ruins
[1:09:44] I like this
[1:09:45] the gifts
[1:09:47] see you you
[1:09:50] are a gift
[1:09:53] your gift to God
[1:09:55] and if you try to be somebody you'll
[1:09:57] ruin the gift that God placed in your
[1:10:00] life
[1:10:02] and that's what always ruins the gifts
[1:10:04] that God sent to the world
[1:10:07] see because God's seen you as a
[1:10:09] beautiful
[1:10:11] Rose but you want it to be a carnation
[1:10:16] that God didn't want you to be a
[1:10:18] carnation
[1:10:19] he wants you to be a rose with Pickers
[1:10:21] on it
[1:10:24] for the heel
[1:10:26] like I am
[1:10:28] Maybe
[1:10:30] you say just what you are and don't try
[1:10:33] to impersonate the other and that's what
[1:10:35] always ruins the gifts that God sends to
[1:10:36] the world you find many
[1:10:39] uh carnal impersonations and we find
[1:10:42] sometimes that people try to copy after
[1:10:43] the other
[1:10:45] now watch this he's talking about a lady
[1:10:47] Minister he said there was a lady
[1:10:49] Minister Miss McPherson
[1:10:51] that was living and every woman Minister
[1:10:54] wore the wings like she did
[1:10:58] or whatever else she did or they would
[1:11:00] hold the Bible the same way that this
[1:11:03] lady Minister Miss McPherson hold the
[1:11:06] body
[1:11:08] you know I've seen people that try to
[1:11:11] sing and they hold the mic just like
[1:11:13] like some person in Hollywood that's
[1:11:15] singing to Lucifer like just perfectly
[1:11:20] and I'm vomiting in my pew
[1:11:23] it don't happen here but I mean if you
[1:11:25] travel sometimes
[1:11:26] you could see other spirits
[1:11:29] that anoint me
[1:11:31] what's wrong with just being
[1:11:39] and everything they everything that she
[1:11:41] did they did
[1:11:43] now we notice that that's
[1:11:46] and we notice got so many bibles Billy
[1:11:49] Graham's today sorry
[1:11:51] but you see God only made one
[1:11:55] Billy Graham
[1:11:59] you're thinking thank God he only made
[1:12:01] one brother death
[1:12:02] but that's all he did
[1:12:06] amen
[1:12:10] but you see God never made
[1:12:14] here but we're just and but you're just
[1:12:18] as important as Billy Graham Oral
[1:12:21] Roberts or any of those other famous men
[1:12:23] you're just as important until you get
[1:12:25] out of your place and then you're no
[1:12:28] good at all
[1:12:30] see you're hindering you you're a
[1:12:33] hindrance watches you're a hindrance to
[1:12:35] those men
[1:12:36] and you're a hindrance to the kingdom of
[1:12:39] God
[1:12:42] wow
[1:12:44] stay in your position see stay with what
[1:12:48] God made you see and then you will
[1:12:51] operate
[1:12:53] all right
[1:12:57] I want to tell you so I want to throw
[1:12:58] something in here I just caught
[1:12:59] something
[1:13:01] many of our positions
[1:13:03] change
[1:13:09] yep
[1:13:10] they change
[1:13:12] if God takes brother Dale off the scene
[1:13:15] he will raise up one of you Brothers
[1:13:16] here
[1:13:17] to take this spot
[1:13:20] and if you don't feel like that
[1:13:24] it'll be destroyed
[1:13:26] because our Prophet said it's the very
[1:13:28] best
[1:13:29] one from among you
[1:13:32] know look on a sister a sister the Bible
[1:13:36] says you say I don't think their
[1:13:38] position changed the Bible says for The
[1:13:41] Elder sisters
[1:13:43] to teach the younger sisters so see when
[1:13:46] you go from a younger sister now you
[1:13:48] become a grandma sister
[1:13:50] your position
[1:13:52] changed
[1:13:56] but I also talks about teaching the
[1:13:59] young men too don't misunderpret the
[1:14:02] script I'll deal with that one when I
[1:14:04] preach the kitchen table
[1:14:06] amen
[1:14:09] and when we get them out of place we
[1:14:11] blaspheme God
[1:14:15] how you train a child it's not just in
[1:14:18] the bible stories which they're the very
[1:14:19] best
[1:14:21] but God expects you know how to eat
[1:14:23] what's placed before you
[1:14:26] know because when you go to Uganda they
[1:14:30] might only serve you turn up
[1:14:33] because that'll be one of the things
[1:14:35] there
[1:14:37] and so now I didn't gag the kid with it
[1:14:39] I don't know why I'm preaching this I'm
[1:14:41] not supposed to be preaching this but my
[1:14:43] mom would always put just a little bit
[1:14:47] just a little bit one little bite
[1:14:49] because she was always going to want to
[1:14:52] be embarrassed when she took in her
[1:14:53] eight little ducklings into a stranger's
[1:14:56] place and the only thing they served was
[1:14:58] turnip
[1:15:01] and can you imagine those eight little
[1:15:02] ducklings saying
[1:15:04] we don't eat there enough
[1:15:08] she didn't want to cross that bridge so
[1:15:10] she worked on the bridge before she got
[1:15:11] to it
[1:15:14] or like teach the kids not to
[1:15:17] foreign
[1:15:18] with your mouth open because you might
[1:15:21] make the other person get sick
[1:15:23] and that would cause health issues in
[1:15:25] the body and then they'd have to come
[1:15:26] get healed
[1:15:30] see
[1:15:32] and that's all in the Bible I give you
[1:15:34] I'll give you scriptures for those kind
[1:15:36] of things
[1:15:37] man
[1:15:38] see God has a you know the Bible says I
[1:15:41] got to get off this message
[1:15:43] the Bible said that all scriptures were
[1:15:46] given for instruction
[1:15:48] Doctrine edification blessings
[1:15:54] and on and on and on
[1:15:57] and we're not preaching on that
[1:16:00] amen
[1:16:02] stay in your position and you'll operate
[1:16:04] all right now carrying on the same one
[1:16:05] just dropping down
[1:16:07] you see
[1:16:08] dropping down to paragraph 63
[1:16:12] and we mustn't try to impersonate anyone
[1:16:15] just be what you are see that's the way
[1:16:18] God made you this is this is the same
[1:16:20] quote just farther down and you never
[1:16:25] you're never fashioned yourself
[1:16:28] you didn't get to choose whether you
[1:16:30] were tall or short by the Bible says by
[1:16:33] thought who could add one cubit to your
[1:16:37] stature
[1:16:38] just strive
[1:16:40] Satan came up with high heels
[1:16:43] but that was the devil
[1:16:46] see see how
[1:16:50] and remember that much of we ministers
[1:16:52] Billy Graham's place we can't do it he
[1:16:54] said but neither can Billy Graham take
[1:16:56] your place see we each one has something
[1:17:00] to do a common little fellow here
[1:17:05] that may just be the janitor or the
[1:17:08] little woman that may be a housewife a
[1:17:10] great Minister on the face of the Earth
[1:17:12] today could not thank your place
[1:17:17] that's word for word by the way
[1:17:21] you you
[1:17:23] God made a purpose
[1:17:26] in making you that you are and you just
[1:17:29] serve God purpose and the way that he
[1:17:32] made you
[1:17:35] amen
[1:17:36] I know I'm killing this one but we're
[1:17:39] living in a world the people want blue
[1:17:41] hair when they got white hair
[1:17:43] and then want green eyes when God didn't
[1:17:45] give them green eyes
[1:17:47] a long eyelashes when God give you short
[1:17:49] out he listens
[1:17:53] and it's Satan
[1:17:55] Messing
[1:17:57] with predestinated people that are out
[1:18:00] of Fellowship
[1:18:02] our Prophet said
[1:18:04] if you're backslidden you're out of
[1:18:06] Fellowship
[1:18:08] with God and he's messing with you
[1:18:12] trying to get to God
[1:18:15] through you
[1:18:17] amen
[1:18:20] well then instead of doing that too many
[1:18:23] times we are like the king Uzziah
[1:18:27] he felt like he would be was too big to
[1:18:31] be called down see and King and he was
[1:18:34] the king and many times we see I see in
[1:18:37] ministers this way
[1:18:38] that they felt that they were just too
[1:18:41] important
[1:18:42] to be told the word of Truth
[1:18:47] wow
[1:18:49] amen
[1:18:54] thank you Lord
[1:19:03] amen and the reason that this is a
[1:19:06] different
[1:19:08] the reason that you do that is because
[1:19:10] you're they're not conscience God Is
[1:19:13] Watching here let's go up see he said
[1:19:15] stay with what you are what God made you
[1:19:18] oh how could we say
[1:19:20] he said the reason you don't do that is
[1:19:23] you're not conscious God Is Watching and
[1:19:26] you lose the very thought of God
[1:19:29] in the being there listening to you God
[1:19:32] put everything down that you're thinking
[1:19:34] about and he knows it in his recorder
[1:19:37] books and your very thoughts in heaven
[1:19:39] are louder than your voice
[1:19:42] on Earth
[1:19:44] and he's talking about you not being
[1:19:45] satisfied
[1:19:47] with what God made
[1:19:50] with what God made
[1:19:54] amen
[1:19:55] we know Moses in the Bible we mentioned
[1:19:58] it was a proper child and and was was
[1:20:01] made for purpose
[1:20:03] amen nobody could take his place
[1:20:08] the angel told him that
[1:20:12] amen let's just look at a few other
[1:20:15] examples in the Bible of people that
[1:20:17] were born for a purpose and asked her 4
[1:20:20] 14.
[1:20:22] and here here Esther is is her her uncle
[1:20:25] Mordecai is trying to encourage her to
[1:20:28] go to the king
[1:20:29] but I want to just I'm going to just for
[1:20:31] time just drop to the end of the verse
[1:20:33] the bottom part of the verse and here
[1:20:36] Mordecai's telling Esther and says and
[1:20:38] who is to know
[1:20:40] whether Thou Art come into the kingdom
[1:20:45] for this very
[1:20:47] purpose
[1:20:49] for such a Time
[1:20:51] it's just this this was all set up
[1:20:55] for such a Time
[1:20:57] is this right here just one thing maybe
[1:20:59] the purpose in Esther's life was just
[1:21:01] one purpose
[1:21:03] go to the king
[1:21:05] and once she was done
[1:21:08] she'd be in the background all
[1:21:10] what would John say in the Bible he said
[1:21:12] I must decrease
[1:21:16] so he can hear
[1:21:19] God's purpose
[1:21:21] wow
[1:21:23] wow
[1:21:25] we know here pilate and Pharaoh both
[1:21:30] were born to damn Nation
[1:21:32] here here Pharaoh said he here God said
[1:21:35] with Pharaoh he said that he's telling
[1:21:38] Moses what he's going to do
[1:21:40] but he said I've raised pharaoh
[1:21:45] and I've hardened his heart why did God
[1:21:48] do that
[1:21:49] God only did that to prove to the people
[1:21:52] of Israel
[1:21:54] and a world
[1:21:57] that he
[1:21:58] was Jehovah
[1:22:02] that he was Jehovah
[1:22:04] amen and that's exactly exactly on the
[1:22:08] other side of this the Spectrum the line
[1:22:11] what he's doing with you
[1:22:13] see he's got some raised up for
[1:22:16] damnation that he's going to harden
[1:22:19] their hearts to prove that God's still
[1:22:21] God
[1:22:22] but he's got some raised up for eternal
[1:22:25] life that are going to say I surrender
[1:22:30] and the devil is going to say I don't
[1:22:32] understand it
[1:22:35] amen
[1:22:37] wow
[1:22:39] God help us
[1:22:40] here we look at
[1:22:43] the scripture I'm trying to find it but
[1:22:45] I'll just do it from memory if I don't
[1:22:46] but Rahab in the wall
[1:22:50] prostitute
[1:22:53] amen
[1:22:55] I wish I could find it here because I'd
[1:22:57] find a scripture

[1:24:55] next verse
[1:24:59] and it was told the king and Jericho
[1:25:02] saying behold there's men came hithered
[1:25:03] tonight
[1:25:05] the children of Israel to search out the
[1:25:07] country and let's just jump to uh

[1:25:26] men and hid them and said thus
[1:25:29] and there came unto the Met came man
[1:25:32] unto me
[1:25:34] and she lied
[1:25:38] I don't understand that either
[1:25:42] but she lied
[1:25:51] to death to 11. and therefore they were
[1:25:53] laid down and she came up onto them on
[1:25:56] the roof I I have a place of going here
[1:25:58] and she said unto the man I know that
[1:26:00] the Lord hath given you the land and
[1:26:02] that the terror has fallen upon us and
[1:26:05] that all the inhabitants of the land
[1:26:07] faintest because of Thee
[1:26:11] four now they were putting on a really
[1:26:13] good show they didn't they didn't
[1:26:14] outwardly show that for we have heard
[1:26:16] what the Lord has dried up the water of
[1:26:18] the Red Sea for you and when thou came
[1:26:20] out of Egypt and what ye did to the two
[1:26:23] kings of the amorites and that were on
[1:26:26] the other side of Jordan
[1:26:30] signing and on whom you utterly
[1:26:33] destroyed
[1:26:36] and as soon as we heard these things our
[1:26:39] hearts did
[1:26:41] they didn't get hardened
[1:26:43] they melted neither did there remain any
[1:26:46] more carriage in any man because of you
[1:26:49] for the Lord your God he is God in
[1:26:53] heaven

[1:27:10] where she can get customers from outside
[1:27:12] the city

[1:32:22] his wife
[1:32:23] has made herself ready I was going to
[1:32:26] read a couple quotes here and close
[1:32:29] put some in spiritual experiences
[1:32:32] he said here here's the prophet talking
[1:32:35] about
[1:32:36] he was born I just I was I stuttered
[1:32:38] there earlier in my message I said he
[1:32:40] says it two different ways he says born
[1:32:42] for this purpose and born for I purpose
[1:32:47] he said both multiple for our purpose
[1:32:50] and this purpose
[1:32:53] but here our Prophet was talking about
[1:32:54] he said he was out crying
[1:32:57] he said I was down crying he said I was
[1:32:59] on the ground I I it's just it just made
[1:33:02] me vibrate when I read this
[1:33:04] so God
[1:33:06] oh man
[1:33:08] I I would just I mean I don't deserve it
[1:33:11] but what an experience amen and he said
[1:33:15] the prophet was praying and crying it
[1:33:17] was blackout
[1:33:18] and he said I've seen a flashlight
[1:33:21] come in the room
[1:33:23] and he said it was like a young Feller
[1:33:26] was pointing the flashlight
[1:33:28] on the floor
[1:33:30] and I thought I thought
[1:33:32] someone must be coming in
[1:33:36] and he said and there the light was on
[1:33:38] the room
[1:33:39] Lord
[1:33:43] and he said above it was the Hallow
[1:33:46] for the pillar of Fire
[1:33:49] and what I thought was a flashlight
[1:33:52] it's actually a Jehovah God
[1:33:56] shining on the floor
[1:33:59] moving along and he came in walking
[1:34:01] through there
[1:34:02] came the angel of God
[1:34:07] so not imagination
[1:34:09] he said he was there
[1:34:11] I looked right at him
[1:34:14] and talked to
[1:34:16] you oh
[1:34:19] wow
[1:34:21] he said I walked up and his arms folded
[1:34:24] out a baked man very fine looking look
[1:34:27] like
[1:34:29] looked like he would have spoken a world
[1:34:31] and it would have bursted
[1:34:34] and I said
[1:34:36] the angel said
[1:34:38] I'm reading this exactly
[1:34:42] he said I the her was close I said I
[1:34:45] been he said I've been sent from the
[1:34:48] presence
[1:34:50] of almighty God to tell you
[1:34:52] that you were born
[1:34:56] for this purpose
[1:35:00] maybe brother Dale's been born this
[1:35:02] whole life just to tell you this morning
[1:35:06] that you Believers here
[1:35:09] are born for this very purpose
[1:35:12] even maybe today
[1:35:16] to pray for the sick
[1:35:18] to go into parts of the world and that
[1:35:21] you will pray for monarchs marnox
[1:35:25] and great men and healings and so forth
[1:35:28] that will take place and these things
[1:35:32] will be
[1:35:33] and he said
[1:35:35] and you know the prophet of course he
[1:35:37] appealed he said I'm uneducated nobody
[1:35:39] will believe me and he said as the
[1:35:40] prophet Moses was given two signs to
[1:35:43] vindicate his mystery
[1:35:45] he will return
[1:35:49] his hand into leprosy and then healing
[1:35:52] it and the Stick of the snake and so
[1:35:54] forth he said so will I give you two
[1:35:57] signs and one of them will be you'll put
[1:35:59] your hand on a person
[1:36:01] and it'll tell them
[1:36:03] what's wrong with them
[1:36:05] and the other and it'll come to pass and
[1:36:07] as so as long as you are reverent he he
[1:36:10] let me finish that he says and don't
[1:36:12] think nothing on your own it'll be just
[1:36:15] given to you and then it'll come to pass
[1:36:17] it after such a long time
[1:36:19] that if you're referent if you're really
[1:36:23] reverent then it will be given to you to
[1:36:25] know the very secrets
[1:36:28] the very secrets
[1:36:31] of their hearts
[1:36:33] of the things that are wrong
[1:36:40] wow
[1:36:42] God saved me for this purpose
[1:36:46] and I'm determined
[1:36:48] to do his will
[1:36:50] amen
[1:36:52] and so will it be upon the bride and so
[1:36:54] will it be on the bride that we're
[1:36:57] unworthy creatures deserving of hell but
[1:36:59] his grace holds us through it and look
[1:37:02] how many were lost and blind today
[1:37:05] when you were saved
[1:37:08] for this purpose
[1:37:11] you were born to do his will
[1:37:16] Hallelujah
[1:37:21] let's stand
[1:37:25] thank you Lord
[1:37:29] thank you Lord Jesus
[1:37:34] thank you Lord
[1:37:36] you thought it was just some common day
[1:37:40] in your life Journey
[1:37:43] but just very possible
[1:37:46] just very very possible
[1:37:49] to God
[1:37:51] had huge plans
[1:37:53] for you
[1:37:55] God help us not to be like this little
[1:37:58] saying I'm going to read to you when we
[1:38:00] close
[1:38:02] a pastor
[1:38:03] visited some of his people
[1:38:08] and when he was there
[1:38:14] the pastor went to a couple's house and
[1:38:17] after he left the wife said to her
[1:38:19] husband she said
[1:38:20] I believe the pastor
[1:38:23] stole
[1:38:24] one of our spinners
[1:38:27] so of course the next year
[1:38:30] a pastor must not visit very often the
[1:38:32] next year
[1:38:33] the pastor couldn't do nothing for those
[1:38:34] people
[1:38:36] because the only time she's seen him all
[1:38:39] she thought of sister Patty
[1:38:40] was you stole my spell
[1:38:44] so one year later the pastor went to the
[1:38:46] exact same couple's house
[1:38:49] for dinner again and unable to resist
[1:38:52] the wife finally got up her courage and
[1:38:54] said that you stealed the spoon that we
[1:38:57] had
[1:38:57] the
[1:38:59] we were here
[1:39:02] the pastor replied
[1:39:06] no
[1:39:08] I put it in your Bible
[1:39:14] one year
[1:39:16] no God
[1:39:18] no devotions
[1:39:20] I put it in your Bible
[1:39:24] one year
[1:39:27] you have not
[1:39:29] because you don't recognize you ask not
[1:39:32] you don't recognize
[1:39:34] the presence of God
[1:39:37] in our midst
[1:39:39] you know
[1:39:41] if he is not the same as when he came
[1:39:44] into the prophet's room
[1:39:46] then he's not even God at all
[1:39:52] you see
[1:39:54] exactly the same you
[1:39:57] are born
[1:39:59] for this purpose
[1:40:02] kingdom of God to be glorified
[1:40:04] Hallelujah
[1:40:06] thank you Lord Jesus amen
[1:40:11] God will prove to the world and prove to
[1:40:13] Satan
[1:40:14] and prove to all his demons
[1:40:19] can you imagine when you get up how the
[1:40:21] demons would tremble they say that bride
[1:40:25] they're waking up and I know the first
[1:40:27] thing they're going to do is get into
[1:40:29] that Bible
[1:40:30] they're going to get into studying the
[1:40:32] Mysteries and they're going to get into
[1:40:34] recognizing who I am and they're going
[1:40:36] to get into
[1:40:38] and it's going to identify me and it's
[1:40:41] going to uncover my sins
[1:40:44] just like the the major general in the
[1:40:47] Bible I'm going to preach on that in
[1:40:49] China or China and Uganda hidden sins
[1:40:52] where he had his leprosy
[1:40:54] and he hid it
[1:40:56] from the whole country
[1:40:59] because if it would have been revealed
[1:41:01] he would have been dethroned
[1:41:04] but it was just a little little servant
[1:41:06] girl
[1:41:08] I said I know there's a God
[1:41:11] back home
[1:41:14] and he can take care
[1:41:16] of your sin leprosy
[1:41:20] you won't have to hide it anymore
[1:41:23] you won't have to roll down your sleeves
[1:41:24] really long to cover up your leprosy
[1:41:27] your tattoos or or Engravings or
[1:41:31] here
[1:41:33] because this God he'll just take it all
[1:41:35] away

[1:41:56] just curve me to your plan Lord Jesus
[1:42:00] and may you get glorified to be the
[1:42:03] greatest
