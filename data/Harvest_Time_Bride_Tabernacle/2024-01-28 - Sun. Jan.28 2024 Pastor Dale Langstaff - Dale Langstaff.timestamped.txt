[23:29] blessing on them and and just uh I don't
[23:32] want to we well we won't lose God's uh
[23:36] sweet anointing and spirit but it's just
[23:38] a few announcements we're looking at
[23:41] February 25th for our church meeting
[23:44] which will be after our lunch so we'd
[23:47] have a regular service have church lunch
[23:49] and then we'll look at what's happened
[23:51] in the past year and uh all these things
[23:55] in the church and look forward to to a
[23:58] time in so we leave in the Rapture you
[24:00] know our dreams and plans and and so we
[24:04] would really desire that you all could
[24:06] be here that support the church with
[24:08] your love and kindness and kind words
[24:11] and and time and fellowship and money
[24:14] and offerings and tithes and offerings
[24:16] and uh so the only reason we would we
[24:19] I'm going to check with a few that are
[24:21] out sister Patty Works shift worker that
[24:24] but uh we're just going to confirm that
[24:27] with different ones that have different
[24:28] work schedules but the only reason that
[24:31] might change is uh for weather like it
[24:34] happened that it was snow storm and half
[24:36] the people weren't
[24:37] here we'd recalculate amen amen so we're
[24:42] not going to leave anybody out so if
[24:44] that's a bad day for you maybe you could
[24:47] let us know or something but uh and also
[24:50] just a few things we're going to look at
[24:51] just on that same line then we'll get
[24:53] right into the word um just a couple
[24:55] things that we look forward to and we're
[24:57] going we can talk about and discuss more
[24:59] in our in our meeting and uh of course
[25:02] you all are should be there you're all
[25:04] welcome to be there and and and uh and
[25:07] everybody has uh good ideas and advice
[25:10] and counsel and all these things but it
[25:14] was brought uh very wonderfully to my
[25:17] attention and different things some from
[25:19] online and some from uh present um and
[25:23] this is not nothing you know anything we
[25:25] do in church it's not like cutting dried
[25:28] and law and you know like I don't want a
[25:31] church like that ju and don'ts and so I
[25:33] almost hesitate to to say things but
[25:36] things we would like to do is cut down
[25:38] on the traffic in front of the pulpit so
[25:40] the ones that sit on this side um you
[25:43] know if you could go to the back and
[25:45] walk around like one thing that was
[25:47] noticed was it was on the camera and so
[25:50] people that had never been in our church
[25:54] before when they watch now of course
[25:56] it's a layout of our church and and God
[25:58] did that before the before uh he seen us
[26:01] here and and so and we're not
[26:03] complainant it don't bother me but you
[26:06] know different ones you know in the
[26:07] video they say wow you have a lot of
[26:08] movement right in front of your Pulpit
[26:11] or sometimes ministers will go out in
[26:12] front of the pulpit like brother Ben or
[26:14] brother Bartley or people under the
[26:16] anointing and if you know if you just
[26:18] have it in your thoughts that maybe
[26:20] you'll just walk down and go
[26:21] around it'll just uh make it maybe
[26:25] clearer for somebody watching online
[26:29] somebody maybe that don't understand the
[26:30] layout of the church now now that's not
[26:33] law I mean if you forget or you you know
[26:35] you're kids screaming and you want to
[26:37] take them out but maybe when you come
[26:38] back you'll take them for a little walk
[26:40] and go the other way you that and the
[26:42] other thing we'd like to do is we'd like
[26:44] to to uh and I know this sounds funny
[26:46] we're not this is not a thought because
[26:48] of uh this is not a re uh is this has no
[26:53] spiritual effect it's not we're not
[26:56] saying that we would like to do this
[26:57] because a spiritual effect but we would
[26:59] like our home Church to take their shoe
[27:01] outdoor shoes
[27:03] off um there's not a single person
[27:05] sitting here this morning that if I came
[27:06] to your house you would expect me to
[27:09] take your shoes off and I have I clean
[27:11] this church a lot of times sister Ruth
[27:13] does but I used to clean it more often
[27:16] than I do now and I have pictures of
[27:19] people uh times where you come in you
[27:21] just can't help it but you know you you
[27:24] bring the outside inside and uh if you
[27:28] were the one that I know Tim and Vicky
[27:30] when we first bought the church they
[27:31] actually went under the pews and sanded
[27:33] the floor and varnished it twice if you
[27:36] were the person that did that and took
[27:38] months to do it you wouldn't wear your
[27:40] outside shoes in there and uh I a couple
[27:43] years ago VY stole the pews and I redid
[27:45] the floor under there took a winter to
[27:48] do it do the pews and that and you know
[27:51] if you can't afford an extra pair of
[27:52] shoes the church will buy them for you
[27:55] and they'll just be owned by the church
[27:56] and you can just put your Little John
[27:57] Henry on them and uh you can just have
[28:00] church shoes that you'll never take
[28:02] anywhere else or slippers or stocking
[28:04] feet and that and it it's not because
[28:07] that we're standing on Holy Ground the
[28:08] building's going to burn but it's just
[28:11] respect for the floor and the carpet and
[28:14] and maybe instead of taking the mop out
[28:17] underneath the Pew every Sunday we just
[28:19] take it out a couple times a year or
[28:21] something but those are two things that
[28:23] we uh we look forward to doing in the
[28:26] future if we can
[28:28] amen we have a little sign up in our
[28:30] back room if you choose not to remove
[28:33] your your shoes you just volunteer to
[28:36] clean and uh it's just very it's just
[28:38] it's very simple you know amen anyway
[28:42] now we know that that will never stick
[28:44] to visitors or people that don't come
[28:46] here regular and we understand that you
[28:48] know that's maybe we can stand and just
[28:51] uh look into his word and you know I I
[28:54] pray with all my heart that you can
[28:56] catch the vision of of what God's trying
[28:58] to show us let's turn to Joshua 2 12-4
[29:02] and you know when brother John Garrett
[29:04] here was here if you uh could catch the
[29:07] the thought of the Holy Spirit I mean
[29:10] just a supernatural literally
[29:13] Supernatural how he preached on you all
[29:16] have a
[29:17] voice and and you know how you and you
[29:20] know I think the very Sunday before that
[29:22] was or a couple Sundays before I preach
[29:24] you all have a Ministry the prophet said
[29:26] that and uh you know uh well we'll read
[29:29] our scripture and you can sit down amen
[29:33] so Joshua 2:12 now therefore I pray you
[29:37] swear unto me by the Lord since I have
[29:40] showed you kindness that you will also
[29:43] show kindness onto my father's house and
[29:46] give me a true token that ye may save
[29:50] alive my
[29:56] father
[29:59] and
[30:01] my my
[30:03] mother and my
[30:05] brethren my sisters and all that they
[30:09] have now that's pretty
[30:13] plain and deliver our lives from
[30:16] death and the man answered
[30:22] her and said our life for your life
[30:28] if you ought not our
[30:30] business and it shall be that when the
[30:33] Lord has given us the
[30:36] L that he'll deal kindly and truly with
[30:39] thee Lord Jesus we pray
[30:43] that somehow you'll just show the people
[30:46] I can't God but you can show the people
[30:49] what you showed
[30:51] me God if they'll catch a vision of it
[30:54] God it will make them stronger in you
[30:56] Lord Jesus Jesus we pray in your name
[31:00] amen amen you may have your seats you I
[31:02] want to and you know I've mentioned this
[31:04] before in adoption you know and I just
[31:07] touch on a quote you know the strongest
[31:09] unit in the
[31:11] world is the family unit there's no unit
[31:15] stronger than the family unit the
[31:17] bloodline of the family is the strongest
[31:20] army in the world Amen there's no Army
[31:23] stronger than the bloodline of the
[31:24] family why do you think that Satan he
[31:27] trying to attack the very
[31:30] Foundation of
[31:32] God's basis amen and if you look in the
[31:35] adoption here he says you know in
[31:37] Genesis 1:26 is one of my favorite
[31:40] scriptures but when when God in the
[31:43] beginning when God made
[31:45] man he was called Elohim and Elohim in
[31:48] the me in the Hebrew means that he was
[31:52] self-existence it was God
[31:55] himself God did
[31:58] everything amen but in Genesis
[32:02] 2 God's name got changed to Jehovah when
[32:06] he made something from himself now think
[32:10] spiritually think family When God Made
[32:14] You from himself it was the family
[32:18] bloodline of no less than Jehovah God
[32:22] and he was no longer
[32:24] self-existence by himself
[32:27] but literally it changed his Dynamics in
[32:31] his name and it said it dwelt with his
[32:36] family god
[32:38] Jehovah dwells with his family
[32:42] Hallelujah the strongest backbone of
[32:47] everything in the
[32:49] world is the backbone of the family
[32:52] there's multiple scriptures of family
[32:54] the Bible says happy is a man that
[32:56] Quivers full full of them and and
[32:58] multiple things it was the
[33:02] bloodline from Jehovah God and your own
[33:04] family in your own household is only a
[33:08] shadow of what God's seen before the
[33:12] foundation of the world and I want to
[33:14] show you something God couldn't
[33:18] accomplish what he wanted to the
[33:21] self-existence one the everything the M
[33:25] miraculous God
[33:27] couldn't accomplish what he wanted to
[33:30] without having
[33:33] you as his family Hallelujah now if God
[33:38] himself couldn't accomplish what God
[33:41] only could
[33:44] do you ain't got a fighting chance to
[33:47] try to do it on your own Hallelujah and
[33:50] you know if we look into Joshua maybe we
[33:53] go further down here into Joshua we see
[33:55] that you know Rahab was protected by an
[33:59] amazing promise and you know we see the
[34:01] world is completely insane but you are
[34:05] the Little House in the wall that when
[34:08] when the wall is crumbling down and the
[34:11] world is crumbling down and your
[34:14] everything is crumbling around you you
[34:17] have a predestinated promise that if
[34:20] you'll not speak
[34:23] Hallelujah if you'll keep the Covenant
[34:25] the token
[34:29] Hallelujah I want to bring that to your
[34:33] attention that this token wasn't
[34:36] self-serving it was for my father's
[34:40] household they weren't
[34:44] Angels it was her
[34:47] father and her
[34:49] mother and her brothers and her sisters
[34:53] and it was for something
[34:55] else it was for
[34:59] all that they
[35:04] obtained
[35:06] Hallelujah Your Life For
[35:11] Mine God is amazing you know this
[35:15] revelation of what you have in this day
[35:19] brought by a prophet watch how God wrote
[35:22] The Plan of Redemption in the Old
[35:24] Testament he is amazing brother mine
[35:27] like he seen your life for mine God gave
[35:31] his life for mine Hallelujah he's
[35:34] writing it
[35:35] everywhere your life for mine he was
[35:38] preing this whole
[35:40] plan when he knew he would come himself
[35:43] and give his life for yours and he
[35:46] expects the same in return that you'll
[35:48] give your life for
[35:50] his hallelujah amen it's it's a family
[35:55] unit on break able family oh it's
[35:58] beautiful I want to look in Joshua 6 and
[36:01] we're going to just we maybe won't read
[36:03] it but two to five here here we see that
[36:05] Joshua you know you can just go back as
[36:08] far as you want but Joshua come up under
[36:10] Moses and Moses was God's man got Moses
[36:13] was God to pharaoh and to the
[36:17] world and you know we've preached on
[36:20] different things but we don't want to
[36:21] get caught up in the the this the the
[36:24] the the the tul amen when when God was
[36:27] done with Moses he just had another
[36:29] person come up and that's why we should
[36:31] be careful with Ministry and all these
[36:33] things it's not about one Minister it's
[36:35] not even all about your pastor or or
[36:38] it's not you know because it's a family
[36:40] it's a unit it's a whole bunch of people
[36:43] are doing this plan of God you remember
[36:46] even God couldn't do it alone you think
[36:48] a Min one minut oh what a joke that must
[36:51] just God must go into a Statics when he
[36:54] thinks some minister is going to pull
[36:56] off something that even he couldn't do
[36:58] and you see here Joshua come up and do
[37:00] you know Joshua was way mightier than
[37:03] Moses amen Joshua was the one that
[37:05] conquered the promised land and actually
[37:07] placed the people in the promised land
[37:10] and you know just multiple things and
[37:12] and but you see here that Joshua in in
[37:15] in in Joshua 62 here God said I've given
[37:19] you the city of
[37:22] Jericho and he said uh now he said we
[37:25] want you to take the Mighty Man and
[37:28] compressed the city now this this city
[37:31] just to give you some history on it and
[37:33] you can study it but this city was the
[37:36] walls weren't just like we think of like
[37:38] one layer of block you know or brick or
[37:40] you know and you pop a hole through it
[37:42] or something like that no this city was
[37:44] big enough that the Chariots and the
[37:46] horses went around on top of it this
[37:48] city actually built the houses on it and
[37:50] the people drove over the roades of the
[37:52] houses man this wall was serious
[37:54] business amen
[37:57] and and here God's telling Joshua how to
[38:00] conquer the city and compress the city
[38:01] and you know the story how they went
[38:03] around the city six
[38:06] days one time each day and you know you
[38:08] compare that to the numerology of God
[38:11] because God Perfection is seven and and
[38:13] you can just preach Forever on seven and
[38:16] I love that amen but I want to show you
[38:19] something and and God is trying to show
[38:21] you I I I know you're not get I wish you
[38:24] could catch it God's trying to show you
[38:26] that you all are part of him you're all
[38:29] part of the plan you're all part of the
[38:32] family you're all part of this church
[38:34] you're all Ministry in this church
[38:36] you're all part of the community forget
[38:39] about brother Dale think of God Jesus
[38:41] Christ you're all Christ you're the
[38:44] prophet said you're his bone you're his
[38:46] flesh you don't have to think about
[38:48] somebody else think about yourself what
[38:50] are you in Christ you are he you are
[38:54] she Hallelujah this ain't a worship of
[38:58] one another it's respects of one another
[39:00] and and honor and love and kindness and
[39:03] and the kindness that you show us is
[39:05] just beyond I'm just unbelievable amen
[39:09] the prophet said that in the last day
[39:10] that the only love in the world would be
[39:13] found in the
[39:15] bride Hallelujah that's that's real and
[39:18] that's true and I mean I've experienced
[39:21] some of that love in the last few years
[39:23] is just I mean just it's just unworthy
[39:26] it's
[39:27] unbelievable amen but I want I I want
[39:30] you to see I want you to just get a
[39:33] mirror and think look at yourself it's
[39:36] you and Christ and who what Christ's
[39:38] thoughts were of you forget about I
[39:41] wished I was somebody else you you are
[39:44] the greatest person you could think of
[39:46] God
[39:47] himself Hallelujah there come right are
[39:50] you catching this is that something made
[39:54] from himself
[39:57] you God's family Hallelujah and I want
[40:02] you to understand this and I mentioned
[40:04] this a few month maybe a month ago or
[40:05] something just touching it you know this
[40:08] message has been two or three months in
[40:09] the coming and and you know when God
[40:12] when I'm building a message I I I preach
[40:14] and I and and that you know I've been in
[40:16] it in the week and I I say it and I
[40:18] shouldn't say it that but here I want
[40:20] you to recognize that in the seventh of
[40:23] Christ
[40:25] perfection
[40:27] maybe we'll read
[40:32] that amen I just find in what verse it
[40:34] is
[40:36] here and then on this he talks about the
[40:40] six days and uh I ain't got my verses
[40:42] broke down here but
[40:46] uh we'll just start there with three and
[40:49] all and and you shall compress the city
[40:51] all ye Men of War and go around the city
[40:53] once and you shall do that six days
[40:56] that's we just want to go past that go
[40:57] to the next one and on this and the
[41:00] seventh priest shall bear before the ark
[41:03] the seven trumpets of ram horns and the
[41:05] seventh
[41:06] day you shall compress the city now God
[41:09] don't do nothing by per chance they
[41:11] didn't just throw words in the Bible
[41:14] just for you know to fill up the pages
[41:16] so it was a thicker book you know what
[41:18] I'm
[41:20] saying he said on the seventh day you'll
[41:22] compress the city and the priests shall
[41:24] blow the trumpets now it ain't mentioned
[41:27] so far much let's go to the next verse
[41:30] about the congregation and about the
[41:32] people but I want you to show you
[41:34] something Joshua had two million people
[41:36] in his
[41:37] church he was following two million
[41:39] people and they don't re the speaker the
[41:43] anthiers the speakers and the sound
[41:45] people were the were the ram horns and
[41:48] they they ran on a different kind of
[41:50] electricity because if you have a ram
[41:52] horn that will actually be loud enough
[41:54] for two million people to hear it with
[41:56] the Lambs bleeding and the goats
[41:57] bleeding and the cattle ball and the the
[42:00] the the ox things ride on in their heads
[42:02] I mean it had to be a pretty good
[42:04] electricity to blow that horn you had to
[42:06] be somebody there that had pipes like a
[42:08] throat like a fog horn
[42:12] amen and it shall come to Passa when the
[42:15] when they make the long blast with the
[42:17] ram horn and you hear the sound of the
[42:20] trumpet and I want to stop right there
[42:23] that God here's God's telling Josh how
[42:26] those walls would come down and you know
[42:29] if we leave the word of God our walls
[42:31] aren't coming
[42:32] down but I want to tell you something
[42:35] and your I don't believe now and I don't
[42:37] mean that here at all I don't feel that
[42:39] one spec there ain't a person here I
[42:41] feel that way but in our life past
[42:45] history we've all built walls for
[42:50] protection brother Dale has I built a
[42:52] few sets of them because you felt like
[42:55] you were going to going to die if you
[42:57] didn't have the wall so you put up a
[43:00] wall of protection and with that Spirit
[43:03] of wall building you think you're going
[43:05] to get to heaven
[43:10] alone I've been there I done got the
[43:13] t-shirt it's hanging in my
[43:16] closet but that's not how God made it
[43:20] amen yes that yes I I I know I know that
[43:24] you work out your own salvation with
[43:25] fear and TR TR Ling but God brought it
[43:28] that he was going to have a family come
[43:29] in it was a family and when we go in the
[43:32] Rapture or we go in death when we go
[43:35] into the white thr we're not going
[43:36] through the white Throne judgment but
[43:38] when they're there judging the white
[43:39] Throne
[43:41] judgment it won't be one person brother
[43:43] Dale won't be the only one
[43:46] there and neither will be somebody else
[43:49] that you thinks an
[43:52] angel but it'll be everything God done
[43:56] was based on a family and so if we walk
[43:59] out of these scriptures we lose our
[44:02] power and I going tell you something
[44:04] even some of may be young or old or
[44:07] different but I would encourage you I
[44:10] would encourage you you know the Bible
[44:12] says that don't fear them that can kill
[44:14] your
[44:15] body now that goes that goes with not
[44:18] just your body but that goes with your
[44:20] character with your I mean anything your
[44:23] your honor your respects it makes no
[44:25] difference
[44:26] because people will if you are very old
[44:28] and you got a little bit white hair few
[44:30] of you do you'll realize that people
[44:32] will say whatever they want to
[44:34] say and and you know see go back to what
[44:37] we preached with with Isaac when he
[44:39] built the wells he never stried for
[44:42] those
[44:43] Wells he just said
[44:46] okay he just kind of waved at
[44:51] him amen and here God saying he said and
[44:56] all the people shall Shout with a great
[44:59] shout and the wall of the city will come
[45:02] down and I want to tell you something if
[45:03] you think about this I don't know what
[45:05] kind of uh vibrations come out of those
[45:09] people's mouths but I want to tell you
[45:11] what in 2 million people you probably
[45:13] had a couple hundred th000 babies under
[45:16] one year old you probably had a couple
[45:18] hundred, people and homemade wheelchairs
[45:21] you prob had a
[45:24] couple amen
[45:26] you probably had a couple hundred
[45:27] thousand people the kids were six seven
[45:29] and eight completely out of control amen
[45:33] and God had them in part of his plan to
[45:36] to conquer your walls around you it was
[45:40] a family of God that was going to bring
[45:42] those walls down and there was some kind
[45:45] of vibrations that come out of the young
[45:48] kid's voice and the old kids voice and
[45:51] the wheelchair people's voices that
[45:53] Satan couldn't handle the walls couldn't
[45:56] handle the stones couldn't handle the
[46:00] mortar that held those stones together
[46:02] that were wide enough for a chariot to
[46:04] go across couldn't add to it there were
[46:07] the vibrations of
[46:10] oh you can't get much poin or
[46:14] not it was the vibrations of all because
[46:18] God is a spirit and God is one and those
[46:22] that worship Him in spirit must worship
[46:24] Him in all all the
[46:27] truth hallelujah and so God was a family
[46:31] and the family unit was one
[46:36] Hallelujah and so to release the power
[46:40] of Jehovah on those Jericho walls where
[46:43] the Martyr and the brick would have with
[46:46] stone probably a
[46:49] bombs but the vibrations out of little
[46:53] children and old men and Widow
[46:56] and people that never had a voice you
[46:58] couldn't carry a tune in a wheelbarrow
[47:00] and all these things what do you think
[47:03] the Bible says to make a Joyful
[47:06] Noise
[47:08] Hallelujah all the demons in hell and
[47:11] all the armies of Jericho and the mortar
[47:14] they had okay could we build the
[47:16] pyramids
[47:18] today no we couldn't build the pyramids
[47:20] today you think those walls were just
[47:22] slopped up there with mortar that they
[47:25] they put in these new houses that they
[47:26] Breck these new houses in the winter
[47:28] time and if they didn't if they put too
[47:30] much water in the the mortar it would
[47:33] dry I've seen new houses I worked on
[47:35] brother M that if they if they made the
[47:38] morar too dry it would dry out and they
[47:40] want it to last half the day so they
[47:42] just slap lots of water in it and those
[47:44] break those
[47:47] houses those houses are barely out of
[47:49] warranty the Bricker falling off
[47:51] it it's because it was all evil for
[47:54] money the these walls weren't built like
[47:57] that but there was a power in the
[48:00] vibrations of the voice of all the
[48:04] people of the children of the family of
[48:07] God that they had to wait for the
[48:09] diapers to get changed they had to wait
[48:12] for the wheel to get slapped back on the
[48:13] wheelchair because every one of those
[48:16] people whether you could walk or
[48:19] not every one of
[48:21] them every one of them every one of them
[48:24] in God you always want to think of God
[48:27] just think of seven every one of them
[48:29] had to go around seven times everyone if
[48:32] they left one child out those walls
[48:35] wouldn't have come down if they would
[48:38] have forgot one person in the old age
[48:39] home those walls would not have come
[48:42] down not one person seven because seven
[48:46] was Perfection God's perfect number and
[48:49] you can preach seven forever I preached
[48:52] the whole
[48:53] message and I
[48:56] Salvador on the Miracle of
[48:59] seven every scripture in the
[49:02] Bible finishes with
[49:05] seven
[49:09] Hallelujah do you know that the Bible
[49:11] says in
[49:13] Deuteronomy Amen in Deuteronomy that one
[49:17] person can flee a
[49:19] thousand but a family oh I know I put
[49:22] that in there two people husband and
[49:25] wife
[49:26] could flee
[49:28] 10,000
[49:29] 10,000 there's no mistakes in God's word
[49:32] children no mistakes don't ever think
[49:35] that this church in Wyoming is based on
[49:38] one person if if it is one person it's
[49:41] Christ but it's not it's not one flesh
[49:44] amen
[49:46] everybody is part of the family
[49:50] everybody
[49:52] Hallelujah and we nobody can put you in
[49:55] the family
[49:56] and nobody can take you out of the
[49:58] family
[50:00] Hallelujah the vibration powers that
[50:04] came from two million voices young old
[50:07] and strong you know see God God God
[50:10] watch this I want to show you something
[50:12] God wants to show you
[50:17] something why didn't God just have the
[50:19] army people go around the
[50:21] walls they were the trained ones why
[50:24] didn't he have just the people people
[50:25] follow with the lamb horns the
[50:28] trumpets why didn't he just have them
[50:30] carry the ark around and have the women
[50:32] kind of like cheering on the side no no
[50:34] no no why didn't he just send Joshua
[50:37] around leading the Army why didn't he
[50:40] send the Levites with the holy of holies
[50:42] say that went around there no no God
[50:45] said
[50:47] oh oh not just Levites not just the holy
[50:52] holies not just Joshua not just the army
[50:55] and not just the
[50:57] old but
[50:59] all but all and I want God's trying to
[51:03] show you something in the church and we
[51:05] we preached it the last day of the new
[51:07] like the last year of 23 you know as the
[51:11] church grows we're all
[51:14] gods and we have to respect each other
[51:19] as you respect each other you respect
[51:22] God like in a family not everybody can
[51:25] pick the restaurant not everybody can do
[51:29] whatever the one job is not everybody in
[51:32] the family can vacuum the house not
[51:35] every but it's still a
[51:38] family and what you're not doing you you
[51:41] just go off and do you know what I mean
[51:43] it'd be funny if you had seven people
[51:45] washing the dishes and the and one one
[51:47] Zinc at the same time you know but every
[51:51] joint is fly for together and the vibr
[51:55] ations of the all were more than the
[51:59] mortar and the
[52:01] stones and even Satan
[52:04] himself could
[52:07] handle amen and there's where you see it
[52:10] in Deuteronomy 32 30 where it says that
[52:14] two will drive
[52:16] 10,000 where I need you I need your
[52:21] friendship I need your kindness I need
[52:25] your
[52:26] everything we need each
[52:29] other amen we need we're stronger
[52:34] together brother Dale actually has bad
[52:37] days I know you maybe didn't know
[52:40] that that's why in a unit of a family
[52:43] when the wife is sad or the husband is
[52:46] the the one is nurturing the
[52:48] other hello
[52:52] hello it's a un you know when you see a
[52:54] family that's made in heaven it's not
[52:57] about I and what I get it's it's about
[53:00] we everything is about what we get we
[53:04] all get the blessings of God we all get
[53:06] the gifts of the Spirit we all get I
[53:08] don't care which one of you would speak
[53:11] in tongues prophesy run the aisles well
[53:14] I'll be screaming right beside
[53:18] you amen and if I can't scream I'll
[53:21] Stand really close so it splashes on
[53:24] me
[53:27] amen we got to Forfeit those what you
[53:30] say well I've been
[53:33] hurt
[53:35] amen that's part of God's plan you had
[53:38] to be
[53:39] hurt you must have been hurt to take
[53:44] something with
[53:45] you I don't mean to hurt
[53:49] either because the only thing you're
[53:51] leaving here is with
[53:53] character and the character proves how
[53:55] you dealt with the
[53:56] hurt
[53:58] just say praise the Lord may God bless
[54:02] you and be with you and help you and and
[54:05] give you all the gold to J and
[54:11] just
[54:13] amen Satan's trying to divide and
[54:16] conquer you know the prophet preached
[54:19] about putting your shoulder to the wheel
[54:21] and or mentioned things like this God
[54:24] God planned on it was for the it was it
[54:26] wasn't for the it was for the Prosper of
[54:28] God's kingdom it was just if we want to
[54:30] move a mountain if we're all there
[54:32] forking Stones over our head it's so
[54:35] much easier amen you watch the wildlife
[54:39] and I mentioned that before watch bison
[54:42] you know the the the before I go into
[54:45] that you see that the family unit you
[54:47] know when you look into God it was a
[54:49] unit that dwelt together and it was it
[54:51] was descendants from each
[54:53] other and they were part of of something
[54:55] and they were part of the other part of
[54:58] God you look at the Bison when the
[55:00] wolves come
[55:02] in you can think oh praise God I pray 24
[55:06] hours a day seven days a week and I
[55:08] listen to the Bible when I'm sleeping
[55:10] and awake and and you know I can survive
[55:14] and amen now there is we all there's
[55:17] there's there's Seasons we all go
[55:21] through different season we may be in
[55:22] different situations you know but like
[55:26] where you're where you might go through
[55:28] a season where you're somewhat alone but
[55:31] God don't plan on you dying there you
[55:33] see what I'm saying you need to get out
[55:35] of that so I I going through a season
[55:38] where you're alone you're C you're going
[55:40] on your island of pmas and it's you and
[55:42] John and brother and God or or Paul how
[55:45] he went away you know you you'll get
[55:47] anchored and solid but you'll come back
[55:49] to the family you'll never stay there
[55:52] you'll never stay there because if you
[55:54] stay there there alone you'll
[55:57] die amen you'll stay
[56:00] there you'll
[56:03] die when you look at how God made us to
[56:08] be stronger
[56:10] together I'm telling you the prophet
[56:12] said that God
[56:18] himself going to do
[56:22] it you're not more holy than him
[56:27] amen and so we and and I I I know I I I
[56:32] understand that you might be going
[56:33] through a season where you're hurt so
[56:34] you kind of protect yourself that's
[56:36] okay you'll go through the season but
[56:38] you'll come out of it like the Harvest
[56:41] or spring season they'll last
[56:43] forever you know we're in the winter
[56:45] season now it won't last forever just
[56:47] wait 30
[56:48] days to be
[56:50] changing amen watch this you know as as
[56:55] I study I I tell
[56:57] you it's it's just it's a thrill to look
[57:01] at God's word it it just blesses my
[57:03] heart and I'm spoiled to be able to do
[57:06] that but I want to something I'd never
[57:09] seen brother Brown tells the story and
[57:11] I'm gonna put a disclaimer down right
[57:14] off first he he names it a really unique
[57:17] name and I don't know why he did that
[57:20] and it so it has nothing to do with this
[57:23] but he tells the story about the
[57:24] Pentecost Al
[57:25] cursing I me tell you what it has
[57:28] nothing to do with Pentecostal Church
[57:30] experienced nothing it just because I've
[57:34] had that cursing amen and he said he
[57:38] said well what is the Pentecostal
[57:39] cursing he says it's when you're going
[57:43] down the road at
[57:45] night and you Dim
[57:48] your in the car you're meeting
[57:53] don't
[57:56] now we've all been there and if you were
[57:59] brother Dale and you were a little
[58:01] younger and
[58:03] stupid and forgive me God it might I
[58:06] hope it hasn't been I hope it's been a
[58:07] few months he'd
[58:11] [Music]
[58:16] say see the prophet told that story for
[58:18] a
[58:21] reason he said you Dim your lights
[58:26] and they don't and he said that's a
[58:28] Pentecostal cursy now I don't know why
[58:30] he named it that it that's not important
[58:34] he says you
[58:35] see let them
[58:38] alone he said you shouldn't do that no
[58:41] matter what the other person does just
[58:44] you let it show that you're What You're
[58:47] Made Of so I'm driving down the road
[58:50] with my wife many years ago I'm going to
[58:53] say it was many years ago and I dim my
[58:55] lights and somebody
[58:57] [Music]
[59:01] don't I just showed everybody that was
[59:03] present in that vehicle sadly probably
[59:05] my kids too forgive me guys what I was
[59:09] made
[59:13] of
[59:16] wow that's how simple it is he said you
[59:19] just showed them What You're Made Of he
[59:21] said let's get something down in here
[59:24] that shows love and respects and
[59:26] respects the next man and love him
[59:29] whether he's right or
[59:31] wrong I don't even
[59:35] care
[59:37] amen just any other Church whether
[59:41] whether you agree or don't just love and
[59:42] respect them does it
[59:45] matter Amen brother Bram said everybody
[59:48] has the right to choose their home chch
[59:50] and go where you feel the word of God's
[59:52] coming forth and where you feel uh you
[59:55] know amen that's an individual choice
[59:58] and so somebody else chooses something
[1:00:00] different you just wave at them go dig
[1:00:03] another
[1:00:04] well man what the prophet says here if
[1:00:08] you
[1:00:09] don't it shows What You're Made Of he
[1:00:12] showed I have multiple quotes and I just
[1:00:14] went through a whole bunch of them maybe
[1:00:15] we'll go through a bunch but he talked
[1:00:19] about he he he tells stories how he
[1:00:22] tells them and I try to show it in both
[1:00:24] but he
[1:00:28] says we're we're in the body of Christ
[1:00:31] and we'll raise up with respects for
[1:00:33] each other and move right on we just
[1:00:36] need to respect each other remove we
[1:00:38] need to respect that in a family nobody
[1:00:41] in my family is exactly the same you
[1:00:44] ever heard it I mean I don't mean this
[1:00:47] wrong but sometimes you'll see in the
[1:00:48] family I mean you say they never had the
[1:00:51] same
[1:00:53] parents and then one of the parents will
[1:00:55] speak up and say what wait a minute I
[1:00:57] was
[1:00:58] there you know what I
[1:01:01] mean they're that different my kids are
[1:01:04] as different as the black is from the
[1:01:06] the
[1:01:06] white amen but I was
[1:01:11] there amen and so us spiritually
[1:01:14] speaking will'll be different it don't
[1:01:18] God God loved the flower garden to be
[1:01:22] beautiful if it was all my color of
[1:01:25] flower would be
[1:01:27] disgusting but we're all beautiful amen
[1:01:30] and God planned that to work his spirit
[1:01:33] amen it was the it was the power and the
[1:01:36] unity of the family of God it was the
[1:01:40] bloodline that you know we Sayang about
[1:01:42] the power in the blood that power is
[1:01:45] pumping in your veins it's your made off
[1:01:50] of himself that's what brother Brown
[1:01:52] said God Made You off
[1:01:58] himself you know we we we we look into
[1:02:01] the scriptures and and and it's true
[1:02:04] that you know Christ came and paid the
[1:02:05] price for for the sins of the world and
[1:02:08] and only the family the predestinated
[1:02:10] would accept it but you
[1:02:14] today pay for the sins of the
[1:02:18] world and studying and I might come to
[1:02:20] this or not but multiple cases brother
[1:02:24] Brown said your reaction to an action
[1:02:28] will will literally make people's
[1:02:30] Eternal destination what's that make you
[1:02:33] makes you
[1:02:35] Christ what the prophet said amen you're
[1:02:39] you're it shows what you're of and and I
[1:02:41] know I got other ones in here multiple
[1:02:43] ones I'm not bringing that out of
[1:02:44] context he said in the visible Union
[1:02:48] here he says the kingdom of God you're
[1:02:50] part of the body of Christ and he said
[1:02:52] your life he said the things are right
[1:02:54] remember remember that you might he said
[1:02:56] this might sink in a little bit rough I
[1:02:58] this is oh this is my favorite quote you
[1:03:01] know I I wish I could portray to you how
[1:03:04] God works but like I I've been it it's
[1:03:08] it's just
[1:03:10] Supernatural I I I had this message I
[1:03:14] had joshu take for probably two or three
[1:03:16] months that I would
[1:03:18] preaches and and and I I mean I had my I
[1:03:23] I mean I had my message completely done
[1:03:25] and I woke up this morning with one
[1:03:28] thought and Len makes me a coffee and
[1:03:31] I'm just
[1:03:31] scrolling let me show you what God give
[1:03:34] me he said now you're a part of the
[1:03:37] family of God the body of Christ and he
[1:03:40] says now this may be a little rough but
[1:03:42] I want you to remember this to sink in
[1:03:45] he said let this this be dignosed for a
[1:03:49] while if you're in the body of
[1:03:53] Christ he doesn't need
[1:03:56] any
[1:04:02] amputations now why didn't God give me
[1:04:05] that two months
[1:04:07] ago because it wasn't the
[1:04:10] time see we can't be in the body of
[1:04:13] Christ we can't even be at church and
[1:04:15] start saying well yeah you're
[1:04:17] not well you can't uh well you you
[1:04:21] you're not a part oh oh well you're just
[1:04:25] the toe you're the hand you're not
[1:04:27] important you're
[1:04:30] just let let me read this invisible
[1:04:32] Union to God he said he doesn't have any
[1:04:36] uh amputations no his body is perfect
[1:04:42] God ain't asking you if we're perfect
[1:04:45] he's not asking for your condolence to
[1:04:48] what he made parents never once would go
[1:04:51] to the older kids and say do you think
[1:04:54] our new babies perfect they could care
[1:04:56] less what the older kids think they beat
[1:04:59] them into
[1:05:02] submission and so is God not asking you
[1:05:06] if the other part of the body is perfect
[1:05:08] it was God that brought him it was it
[1:05:12] came from him you got to get that you
[1:05:15] have to accept your brothers and sisters
[1:05:18] and they're different they're
[1:05:20] unique I'm just a little toe or maybe
[1:05:23] the toenail the little
[1:05:26] toe but if you go ahead and rip yours
[1:05:28] off this
[1:05:30] morning I'll bet you will hear some
[1:05:33] noise I probably could find a pair of
[1:05:35] pliers somewhere in this building go
[1:05:37] ahead and try it you say oh bless God
[1:05:39] you know we can't see it we can't hear
[1:05:41] it you know it don't just try to remove
[1:05:46] it he don't stop there he says his body
[1:05:50] is
[1:05:52] perfect it don't need any
[1:05:55] amputations amen wow he said that's the
[1:06:05] truth you know
[1:06:07] what nobody can put you in the body and
[1:06:10] nobody can take you out of the body to
[1:06:12] the church you see what I mean like some
[1:06:14] sometimes I know I know I know many of
[1:06:17] you sitting here have been misunderstood
[1:06:19] or mis accused and Mis this that don't
[1:06:21] worry just move on just just wave to it
[1:06:24] and say that it it gave you a lot of
[1:06:27] character it it made me said I love you
[1:06:30] praise God I'm glad that you're a rose
[1:06:32] and I love whatever you love honey she
[1:06:35] don't like roses she likes some weird
[1:06:37] flower
[1:06:41] amen help me out they're lot carnations
[1:06:44] they're a lot cheaper praise the Lord
[1:06:46] God knew I was poor amen Carnation
[1:06:48] forget the Roses bring on the carnations
[1:06:50] amen you see what I mean I couldn't
[1:06:52] stand carnations I thought everything
[1:06:54] about love was roses I mean there had to
[1:06:56] be red or pink and there had to be roses
[1:06:59] she said aie I hate roses so I said well
[1:07:02] sorry you're the wrong one I'm going to
[1:07:03] look for
[1:07:06] another no I said praise God I just save
[1:07:08] 15 bucks every time
[1:07:14] I that means we can't amputate the
[1:07:18] kids if they make noise we can't
[1:07:21] amputate somebody if their cell phone
[1:07:22] rings by mistake
[1:07:24] we can't amputate somebody if they come
[1:07:26] two minutes late or three minutes early
[1:07:28] we can't amputate you see
[1:07:30] me we can't amputate somebody if mum
[1:07:33] fries the
[1:07:34] eggs or you know it's not every meal I
[1:07:38] say I love what you just
[1:07:42] cook but I don't amputate
[1:07:47] it see
[1:07:50] spiritually just just smile and say
[1:07:53] praise God God you love carnations I'm
[1:07:56] going to buy
[1:08:00] roses
[1:08:04] amen there was no mistake the prophet
[1:08:06] put that in
[1:08:08] there what shows that you're in there it
[1:08:13] shows what's in down deep if I want to
[1:08:16] remove
[1:08:17] you which one of you that have the Spear
[1:08:20] of Christ would want somebody not to
[1:08:23] make
[1:08:27] just think of
[1:08:29] that actually don't think of it too long
[1:08:31] because that's
[1:08:32] terrible the Bible says that he would
[1:08:35] that
[1:08:39] none none that's kind of the opposite of
[1:08:42] all that none would be
[1:08:47] lost so we just we just see something
[1:08:50] that we don't agree with we say oh I
[1:08:51] just cut them off of my the vocabulary
[1:08:54] we we either think of amputation or
[1:08:57] building
[1:08:58] walls and some of the walls that have
[1:09:00] been built around here by some of you
[1:09:02] are big enough for chariots to ride on
[1:09:06] to and you're going to die in that City
[1:09:10] if you don't let God bring those walls
[1:09:12] down you know I
[1:09:15] visit dozens of ministers I don't have
[1:09:18] the same Doctrine as
[1:09:20] them does it don't
[1:09:22] matter it it does not even I don't even
[1:09:26] talk about
[1:09:28] it amen talk about what we like I think
[1:09:32] you got a cool shirt I think you got a
[1:09:34] cool
[1:09:36] tie don't matter God will lay it on my
[1:09:40] heart somebody I think you know would be
[1:09:42] nice to come through and minister to
[1:09:45] us and we've had a couple maybe one or
[1:09:48] two that we maybe would make the
[1:09:51] distance a lot longer before they come
[1:09:52] back
[1:09:56] but it I I don't I don't chase after
[1:09:59] them get the old horse whipped and say
[1:10:01] bless God it's not how we do it
[1:10:06] here
[1:10:08] amputation God's body was
[1:10:11] perfect I I might not understand all the
[1:10:14] let me let me just I know you're
[1:10:15] thinking brother Dale just dropped this
[1:10:18] does anybody here understand everything
[1:10:19] that works in your body you understand
[1:10:22] how you eat green grass and it brings
[1:10:24] out white milk and all these things and
[1:10:26] how your stomach works and how long
[1:10:30] really I don't care I'm just enjoying my
[1:10:33] body brother Matt I don't really care
[1:10:35] how it works I wish it was a little bit
[1:10:36] skinnier but I mean but like getting
[1:10:39] into the fine
[1:10:41] details
[1:10:44] hello
[1:10:49] we we're trying to take a sliver out of
[1:10:51] our brother's eye we got a think of a
[1:10:54] oak log in our own
[1:10:57] maybe maybe the prophet said thousand
[1:11:00] times you know pray for him I know I
[1:11:03] make mistakes do you know I I want to
[1:11:05] throw this in here I I considered even
[1:11:07] preaching a message on
[1:11:09] this you know every Minister and prophet
[1:11:13] in the Bible the people that lived with
[1:11:16] the flesh had trouble obeying the god
[1:11:18] the
[1:11:22] word
[1:11:24] you I have it I have two sheets on a
[1:11:27] clipboard at home and you look at some
[1:11:30] of the things the ministers did in the
[1:11:32] Bible two or three of them took all
[1:11:34] their clothes
[1:11:35] off the David was one one was uh search
[1:11:40] with an H I can't think of it some
[1:11:42] married
[1:11:43] prostitutes I mean I mean they David
[1:11:46] acted like a like uh David in the the
[1:11:49] middle of Psalms acted like he was
[1:11:52] like acted like a dumb man all
[1:11:56] you got to do is Wake till tomorrow I
[1:11:57] can give you the scriptures they're
[1:11:58] already on my list but when we live with
[1:12:01] each other see we see everything he's oh
[1:12:03] Dale he's a pig when he yeah I probably
[1:12:07] am God don't even care because this is
[1:12:10] just going to rot he's looking on the
[1:12:12] Inside
[1:12:13] Man and you see what you don't think
[1:12:16] this street let's bring it right up to
[1:12:17] almost our day most of the people that
[1:12:19] lived with brother
[1:12:22] Brandon that and their families are not
[1:12:25] still living with
[1:12:32] them but people that just got the word
[1:12:35] of God that came out of the mouth that
[1:12:37] had lots of
[1:12:39] failures they hung on
[1:12:42] to they said that's like this this body
[1:12:46] head you're looking at me funny you
[1:12:48] would be freaked out I think I had about
[1:12:50] 20 ministers and if I did anything that
[1:12:53] they did in the Bible you would walk go
[1:12:55] of this church I'd never see you
[1:12:58] again but I want to tell you something
[1:13:01] when I studied
[1:13:03] that
[1:13:05] God actually told those
[1:13:08] ministers to do what you'd walk out of
[1:13:11] this church
[1:13:12] for see those ministers never took all
[1:13:16] the clothes off on their
[1:13:18] own Moses never married you know who he
[1:13:23] married
[1:13:23] on his own David never acted like a
[1:13:27] dummy on his own when Saul was chasing
[1:13:29] him like a dumb man a drunk he he was
[1:13:32] actually blasphemed by the country he
[1:13:33] went through the CH you're looking at me
[1:13:35] funny they didn't you do you know do you
[1:13:37] know David's best friend in the studying
[1:13:39] I oh God forgive me I'm off my nose you
[1:13:42] know David's best friend that was
[1:13:43] falling and he was seeing all Dave
[1:13:46] stupid mistakes oh David I would oh
[1:13:49] David made his enemy come right in and
[1:13:51] give him a position in the church in the
[1:13:53] other guy's like oh David David that guy
[1:13:56] was just shooting at you last month do
[1:13:59] you want me to tell you
[1:14:00] something do want me to go to the fast
[1:14:02] part of the
[1:14:04] thing when David died and Solomon became
[1:14:08] the guy that had seen all David's
[1:14:12] mistakes and he was justified and
[1:14:19] right I can you not I can if if I preach

[1:18:44] body of Christ it reveals the
[1:18:46] secrets that are to his people that's in
[1:18:49] God being
[1:18:51] misunderstood amen let me just watch
[1:18:53] this read I'm I'm going to close
[1:18:56] sometime this morning but let me read
[1:18:59] you another quote here and just go to
[1:19:01] where this this is in the Great
[1:19:02] Commission and he starts out here and he
[1:19:05] says if the devil
[1:19:08] can separate
[1:19:11] us that sounds like
[1:19:14] walls he's got a shooting at one
[1:19:18] another it don't matter if you agree or
[1:19:20] disagree it don't matter if they hurt
[1:19:22] you or didn't hurt
[1:19:25] you he said he's got an open Target that
[1:19:28] he wants to shoot
[1:19:32] at the Devil the devil's got an open
[1:19:34] Target that he wants to shoot at every
[1:19:36] one of you but before he does he
[1:19:40] realizes that we're shooting each
[1:19:43] other so he just gets a
[1:19:48] chair and sits
[1:19:51] down
[1:19:58] thank you very
[1:19:59] much I was going to do that
[1:20:02] myself that's like when Esther does the
[1:20:04] chores for me I say thank you honey I'm
[1:20:06] just going to stay in by the
[1:20:11] Woodfire
[1:20:14] amen he says he just sits
[1:20:17] down he says now this quote's two or
[1:20:21] three p and I'm not going to read it
[1:20:23] but he talks about he says you know if
[1:20:25] somebody did something wrong and it was
[1:20:27] wrong really wrong told a nontruth a lie
[1:20:32] misled just sin flat out
[1:20:38] sin he
[1:20:39] said if you would get Christ in your
[1:20:43] heart and you would get down in your
[1:20:45] prayer
[1:20:47] closet and you would get past the
[1:20:51] retaliation
[1:20:53] point and God could reveal to
[1:20:57] you what that person's going
[1:21:01] through think about that if you would
[1:21:04] get passive retaliation I'll get them
[1:21:07] might take me 25 years but brother Matt
[1:21:09] I'll
[1:21:11] remember
[1:21:13] sorry sorry brother M I don't know why I
[1:21:16] just he said if he can get you past the
[1:21:18] retaliation and he can and God himself
[1:21:21] can show you what that brother or sister
[1:21:25] is going
[1:21:27] through he said you'll get off your
[1:21:29] knees with the sympathy of Christ and
[1:21:34] run to the brother or sister and throw
[1:21:36] your arms around say I'm so sorry I I I
[1:21:40] just didn't
[1:21:41] know I just didn't know that you lost or
[1:21:45] your house or I just didn't know that I
[1:21:49] just didn't
[1:21:51] know I just didn't know
[1:21:53] know
[1:21:56] now God NE through the prophet he never
[1:21:59] ever give an excuse why you could
[1:22:02] retaliate and the person
[1:22:06] sinned completely
[1:22:09] wrong but it was a there was no
[1:22:13] justification for it but what he's
[1:22:14] saying is if you got the spirit of
[1:22:16] Christ you would understand and I'm not
[1:22:19] justifying sin but you would understand
[1:22:22] the
[1:22:23] struggle and the
[1:22:25] battle that they had buried loved ones
[1:22:28] or lost a baby or they hadn't had a baby
[1:22:31] or they' lost their house or they
[1:22:32] couldn't rent a house or it was cold and
[1:22:35] they weren't working or or there was
[1:22:39] something
[1:22:44] hello no we just load our pistol you I I
[1:22:48] I spent some time in the gun store this
[1:22:50] week in uh wherever it was magn M they
[1:22:53] were showing me they were showing me
[1:22:55] they were showing me a pistol grip pump
[1:22:57] shotgun that would hold seven
[1:23:00] shells and it'll look like something I
[1:23:02] should
[1:23:03] have but I got voted
[1:23:05] down I won't tell you who
[1:23:09] bu but that's what we do
[1:23:12] spiritually we have a pistol
[1:23:15] grip and we're flashing it all over in
[1:23:19] church bless God I wouldn't have picked
[1:23:21] her for the Sunday school teacher I
[1:23:23] would have done the Sunday School room
[1:23:24] different I wouldn't have I wouldn't
[1:23:27] have picked that time for church I
[1:23:29] wouldn't have
[1:23:32] had and Satan
[1:23:39] just God help
[1:23:50] us here is where he says this it he says
[1:23:53] you stand if You' stand shoulder Tosh
[1:23:55] shoulder with brother knowing that he's
[1:23:57] IM moral or the sister and maybe watch
[1:24:00] this this is the person that actually
[1:24:03] sinned against
[1:24:07] you like black and
[1:24:13] white he
[1:24:17] says well actually before that he says
[1:24:19] you if go if God through a amazing
[1:24:23] thing showed you what the brother had
[1:24:25] went through he said you'd be
[1:24:26] sympathizing with him get up off your
[1:24:28] knees and run over and be shaking his
[1:24:30] hand and he said you would recognize
[1:24:33] that he's IM mortal and in the presence
[1:24:35] of
[1:24:36] God uh wait
[1:24:38] sorry oh in the presence of God God
[1:24:42] don't condemn
[1:24:43] anybody but he
[1:24:45] sinned hey you know what now this is a
[1:24:49] paradox brother Dale is still studying
[1:24:51] it I could show you thousands of sins in
[1:24:55] here Abraham lied Isaac lied Rahab lied
[1:25:01] I mean that's only to begin that's just
[1:25:03] a number a
[1:25:06] few you know now now I
[1:25:09] mean that that's I mean we obviously you
[1:25:12] know the Bible says there will be no
[1:25:13] Liars in heaven you're going to have to
[1:25:15] ask God those
[1:25:18] questions but he says if God would show
[1:25:21] you that this brother or sister is just
[1:25:23] Immortal and maybe your maybe his
[1:25:28] destination rests upon your
[1:25:32] attitude towards
[1:25:34] them so if you pull your pistol grip and
[1:25:38] say I got proof I have three Witnesses
[1:25:42] bless God I even have a video
[1:25:46] camera says your Eternal destination
[1:25:48] then what person would want to condemn
[1:25:50] somebody to death
[1:25:52] when God in the presence of God wouldn't
[1:25:55] do that
[1:25:57] himself Hallelujah he said you had
[1:26:00] realize that every one of us is oh I
[1:26:03] don't like this part I think I'll stop
[1:26:05] there
[1:26:08] guilty bless God I'm I'm
[1:26:12] holy I got the Holy
[1:26:15] Ghost you would realize that every one
[1:26:17] of us are guilty and we
[1:26:20] all there's that all again I don't like
[1:26:22] that all need help
[1:26:26] one from another oh bless God I'm going
[1:26:29] to just I'm not going to church no
[1:26:32] more I'm just GNA serve God
[1:26:37] alone
[1:26:38] uh sorry I had a single sister tell me
[1:26:41] that one time it just it just it's just
[1:26:43] against all the laws of
[1:26:45] God
[1:26:48] Amen this isn't the Great Commission I'm
[1:26:50] not making this up this is a prophet
[1:26:51] preaching now
[1:26:53] he says we all need help one from the
[1:26:55] other and the best way to do that is
[1:26:58] pray
[1:27:02] wow amen we need each other and as as we
[1:27:07] travel this journey and we're preparing
[1:27:10] for a
[1:27:11] Rapture let's not fight in the family I
[1:27:15] I I there's I listen there some I we
[1:27:18] won't understand everything I don't
[1:27:20] understand my own kids I would never do
[1:27:28] that God help us you know the scripture
[1:27:31] where it talks about in Hebrews and it's
[1:27:33] so much more than Church you know and
[1:27:36] and even sharing with brother Carson and
[1:27:38] he's so right he's so right there's so
[1:27:40] much more to Fellowship than Church
[1:27:43] there's so much more to Fellowship than
[1:27:45] preaching the word yes the word's
[1:27:47] important you can play Croco at my house
[1:27:50] and be fellowshipping the prophet said
[1:27:52] to young people to keep them together as
[1:27:54] much as humanly possible amen you could
[1:27:58] I mean like we don't want the emphasis
[1:28:00] to be on playing croen but just go to
[1:28:03] somebody's
[1:28:05] house
[1:28:08] just not for no
[1:28:12] reason just
[1:28:14] because we're not made to be single
[1:28:18] solos we're we're not going into Glory
[1:28:21] single solo just me bless God it took
[1:28:24] him all these years to prepare a place
[1:28:26] for me to
[1:28:29] dwell oh boys oh
[1:28:33] boys
[1:28:35] Amen Let forsake not to some of yourself
[1:28:38] together that's Fellowship that's not
[1:28:41] just here on Sunday morning or Wednesday
[1:28:43] that's togetherness that's in your home

[1:28:49] homes man we could have a catar singing
[1:28:52] place any day of the week call me I'll
[1:28:55] be
[1:28:56] there amen but watch how it shows that
[1:29:00] scripture it says in like manner like
[1:29:02] some already
[1:29:03] have
[1:29:07] amen hallelujah I'm just finishing on
[1:29:10] some amen God help
[1:29:20] us
[1:29:27] here's the prophet talking about just
[1:29:29] just so many good he
[1:29:32] said he said but just wait a minute he
[1:29:35] said what we got what have we got he's
[1:29:38] he's telling another story he said we
[1:29:40] got nothing more than the rest of the to
[1:29:42] got that's exactly right as long as
[1:29:45] we're fussing and steing and carrying on
[1:29:46] among one another he said you need to
[1:29:49] clean your own steps
[1:29:50] first said the love of God God is love
[1:29:53] unless one another you have uh each one
[1:29:57] of you have these gifts right centered
[1:30:00] amen and it'll be uh selfless and or or
[1:30:05] it'll be if you don't have these gifts
[1:30:07] sorry it'll become selfish and
[1:30:09] indifference and it'll put it'll put it
[1:30:12] itself off and isolate
[1:30:16] yourself and as soon as you as soon as
[1:30:18] the devil Thrills walls and you isolate
[1:30:21] yourself from the family of God the body
[1:30:23] I and and and there's nobody doing that
[1:30:25] here obviously you're here
[1:30:27] today the immediate thing is you got to
[1:30:29] defend your stats so you got to fuss and
[1:30:32] stew because you're the only one that's
[1:30:34] right and all the other brothers and
[1:30:35] sisters they're all
[1:30:38] idiots in the family of God Amen that's
[1:30:41] amen God help us amen
[1:30:45] hallelujah here here's another one in
[1:30:48] why people can't keep the he said when
[1:30:49] you're going to see the Church of God
[1:30:51] all fell fellowshipping one with another
[1:30:53] without any friction at all he said now
[1:30:57] then you remember that the servants in
[1:30:58] the Bible they said oh Lord the Lord
[1:31:01] delays his
[1:31:02] coming and he said they began to
[1:31:05] devour one another and bite and fuss and
[1:31:10] stew and the Lord came and caught them
[1:31:12] that way and their lamps had no oil in
[1:31:15] them see and then they did they were
[1:31:18] cast into utter Darkness am man now we
[1:31:23] all would testify I'm sure of
[1:31:28] this the word at the going home time
[1:31:31] amen and we don't need to be fussing and
[1:31:36] stewing e even if we disagree it's okay
[1:31:40] to disagree I don't like the things my
[1:31:43] wife
[1:31:44] likes amen but I like her really
[1:31:48] fine am man she gets some Greek salad
[1:31:51] with meat with a toothpick stuck through
[1:31:53] it and it's got some kind of seasoning
[1:31:57] on it that would kill a horse amen and
[1:32:00] I'm just enjoying my large
[1:32:03] pizza
[1:32:06] amen it's all right amen I'm going to
[1:32:09] close with this in the thinking man's
[1:32:12] filter he said what's
[1:32:15] drawing what's drawing us through the
[1:32:17] word it's because you're a part of the
[1:32:21] body Body of Christ you're part of the
[1:32:24] family you're part of the body of Christ
[1:32:26] in this age and if the word is in you it
[1:32:29] can only draw through the word and the
[1:32:32] spirit will Quicken the
[1:32:33] word and only the word can
[1:32:37] live and here he says and this is the
[1:32:41] reason why he said the all the father's
[1:32:44] given me will come onto me now which one
[1:32:47] of us would want to amputate somebody
[1:32:50] that the father had given to Christ and
[1:32:54] we're going to try and take them out of
[1:32:56] God's
[1:32:57] hand but that's probably actually tried
[1:33:01] to happen to each one of
[1:33:03] us in different
[1:33:09] times so a mortal is going to fight God
[1:33:13] for who's in his
[1:33:17] head
[1:33:19] really amen
[1:33:22] he says all that he's given me will come
[1:33:25] to me and I will raise them up in the
[1:33:27] last day they might be raised up in the
[1:33:30] last day with thousands of mistakes in
[1:33:33] their
[1:33:38] body see the father he said he's a part
[1:33:42] of the body of Christ and that's what
[1:33:44] the world and
[1:33:47] predestination put in my
[1:33:49] heart amen you know they asked the
[1:33:52] Prophet this and it's not in this quote
[1:33:54] they asked the prophet they said who
[1:33:56] will be over there and he said ' if God
[1:33:59] put your name in The lm's Book of Life
[1:34:01] That's who will be there it don't matter
[1:34:04] how many
[1:34:05] times you fall
[1:34:07] down
[1:34:09] amen and that any man that's a real
[1:34:12] Christian and born again today and knows
[1:34:13] since he was a little kid or a little
[1:34:15] girl or either something like this that
[1:34:19] you've always couldn't get away
[1:34:22] from
[1:34:24] God there's just I don't care if you
[1:34:27] were a million miles from God I can
[1:34:31] remember and I mean your story will be
[1:34:33] different than mine and it'll be it
[1:34:35] could be better than mine but it don't
[1:34:36] matter where you were I can remember as
[1:34:39] a five or six year old kid being in
[1:34:42] services in Michigan in the Holiness
[1:34:45] Campground them giving an altar call and
[1:34:47] I would pledge to myself I am not going
[1:34:49] to that altar no matter what
[1:34:52] I would I would as much as tie myself
[1:34:56] down but I would go to the
[1:34:58] Altar and it was against every
[1:35:01] commitment and better
[1:35:04] judgment
[1:35:06] amen because you can't get away from
[1:35:11] what is inside you it's not possible you
[1:35:15] might
[1:35:16] make God don't even see those mistakes
[1:35:20] I'm just trying to close with
[1:35:22] God God don't I don't care if you were
[1:35:25] look at David murdered killed raped
[1:35:29] makes not God's just looking at he's
[1:35:30] looking at there's
[1:35:32] me and and all the other all his friends
[1:35:35] that are falling that flesh around they
[1:35:36] say
[1:35:39] really that's what they're saying about
[1:35:41] you that's what they're saying about me
[1:35:43] but if you got them you just
[1:35:47] say does does it matter what the people
[1:35:50] say
[1:35:52] no it don't matter you just smile does
[1:35:54] it okay as as as parents when you got
[1:35:57] three-year-old kids does it matter what
[1:35:59] your kids say to you as a parent I mean
[1:36:01] like for your own character no you're
[1:36:03] the parent it's it's like it's God's got
[1:36:07] it all in control just like a little
[1:36:10] tiny kid and he comes to his parent says
[1:36:12] you know he's two years old and says
[1:36:13] mommy I'm going to move out anybody
[1:36:16] watch Andy Griffith this boy wanted to
[1:36:18] move out and he wanted his dad to write
[1:36:19] the letter he said where are you going
[1:36:20] he said well I'm going he said but you
[1:36:22] can't tell me you're going he said and
[1:36:24] so and he started writing the letter he
[1:36:26] said now I'll never see you again he
[1:36:28] said well no no Daddy I want to see you
[1:36:30] but he said you can't see me because
[1:36:31] you're
[1:36:35] leaving you can't leave
[1:36:40] God not if it's God in you amen let's
[1:36:44] stand amen God help us if you didn't
[1:36:46] catch nothing this morning I hope you
[1:36:49] caught the quote where we can't
[1:36:52] amputate there's no
[1:36:55] script even based on sin and
[1:36:59] proof for
[1:37:01] amputation there's no just leave it
[1:37:05] alone you might not be able to
[1:37:07] fellowship with that just go dig another
[1:37:10] well just go because you don't want to
[1:37:13] be guilty of amputating something that
[1:37:16] God put in his
[1:37:18] hand you might not like that person
[1:37:21] could be going through like I mean he
[1:37:23] could be flat out
[1:37:25] blacki but that don't change
[1:37:28] predestination don't change predes and
[1:37:30] so a message like this is God saying we
[1:37:33] all have a voice like brother John was
[1:37:35] preaching we all have a voice you all
[1:37:37] have a Ministry but we're but respect
[1:37:40] we're all the one we're family to God
[1:37:43] you're one to God you're one oh yeah
[1:37:46] you'll work out your own individual
[1:37:48] salvation alone but to God he looks at a
[1:37:51] family God's not going to be sitting at
[1:37:53] the Pearly gate
[1:37:56] doors waiting just for brother
[1:38:00] Dale
[1:38:01] no because that would only be the
[1:38:03] toenail of the little toe and it
[1:38:06] wouldn't be big enough to put a wedding
[1:38:07] gown
[1:38:09] on you see what I'm I'm saying we're all
[1:38:12] in the body some are the ears the eyes
[1:38:15] the hair the face the I mean we're all
[1:38:18] and and you're never going to understand
[1:38:20] completely
[1:38:22] unless you're God how that body operates
[1:38:25] there's not a doctor
[1:38:27] today that understands or can reproduce
[1:38:30] the exact body that God
[1:38:33] created because it was
[1:38:35] Jehovah amen hallelujah amen God bless
[1:38:39] you this
[1:38:41] morning
[1:38:50] Hallelujah that
[1:38:54] story he became me so that I might
