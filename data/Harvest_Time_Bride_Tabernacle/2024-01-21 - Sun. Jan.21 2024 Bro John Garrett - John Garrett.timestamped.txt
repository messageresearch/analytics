[29:46] amen blessed be his wonderful name if
[29:49] you have your Bibles and would like to
[29:50] turn with me we're going to turn to the
[29:53] uh book of First
[29:55] Corinthians and uh
[29:58] I I don't normally title my sermons I
[30:00] always feel like
[30:02] uh uh you know if I title something is
[30:05] just it's just it never seems to flow
[30:07] well for me but I I I if I would title
[30:10] this I would title it a manifested
[30:12] voice and um uh just pray that you bear
[30:16] with me as I lay a little bit of a
[30:18] foundation we were we were talking last
[30:20] night and having fellowship and I
[30:22] thought it was it was interesting you
[30:23] know as brother Dale and brother Carson
[30:25] were talking of course I just sit there
[30:27] listen to my elders I don't have a whole
[30:30] lot to say but they just preached my
[30:32] sermon back and forth to one another and
[30:33] they you know what one what one didn't
[30:35] say the other one would and then he
[30:37] would say something I'm just sitting
[30:38] there man that's everything I want to
[30:40] preach and and I felt like I should be
[30:42] taking notes you know so I would I would
[30:45] have something and and um and so I was
[30:48] like at the end of it I was like well I
[30:49] don't need to preach you all obviously
[30:51] you're all on track and and uh uh so I
[30:54] was up all night just awake trying to
[30:56] think you know what I Lord give me a
[30:59] sermon so give me something to to speak
[31:01] to your people and so you know I just
[31:02] have just a couple little thoughts this
[31:04] morning and uh just pray it'll be a
[31:06] blessing to you 1 Corinthians uh chapter
[31:09] 14 we're going to just read a couple
[31:11] verses
[31:12] here it says but now Brethren if I come
[31:15] to you speaking with tongues what shall
[31:18] I profit you unless I speak to you
[31:20] either by Revelation by knowledge by
[31:23] prophesying or by teaching even things
[31:26] without life whether flute or harp when
[31:28] they make a sound unless they make a
[31:31] distinction in the sounds how will it be
[31:33] known what is piped or played for if the
[31:36] trumpet makes an uncertain sound who
[31:39] will prepare for battle so likewise you
[31:42] unless you utter by the Tongue words
[31:45] easy to understand how will it be known
[31:47] what is spoken for you will be speaking
[31:49] into the air there are it may be so many
[31:53] kinds of languages in the world and none
[31:55] of them is without significance ific now
[31:58] turn with me one more one more time to
[32:00] the book of Galatians in Chapter 2 and
[32:03] we'll read one more scripture and this
[32:05] will be the kind of the the foundation
[32:07] of of what I have on my heart this
[32:10] morning Galatians Chapter 2 and verse2
[32:13] says I have been crucified with Christ
[32:16] it is no longer I who live but Christ
[32:20] lives in me and the life which I now
[32:24] live the which I now live
[32:27] In the Flesh I live by faith in the Son
[32:30] of God who loved me and gave himself for
[32:33] me may the Lord just bless the his words
[32:36] you all may be seated this
[32:40] morning lay a little bit of a foundation
[32:43] here this morning and and uh I want to
[32:46] capitalize on this this thought that
[32:48] that the Apostle Paul gave us here that
[32:51] the life which we now live we live by
[32:55] faith in the son of God
[32:57] amen and faith faith comes by what by
[33:00] hearing right and hearing of the word of
[33:03] God and and faith is a gift of God not
[33:06] of yourself lest any man should boast
[33:08] and we are we are
[33:10] called uh to this day to this hour that
[33:14] we have heard a voice speaking to us and
[33:18] there are many voices in this world Paul
[33:20] says that that that they they all have a
[33:23] significance you know and many and
[33:25] people speak and and and nothing is is
[33:28] without
[33:29] meaning and so if if you've traveled if
[33:32] you've go to different places and I I
[33:34] think you know brother brandom talked
[33:35] about it how uh when he was in Africa
[33:38] and he would be ministering you know and
[33:40] there'd be 10 15 different interpreters
[33:42] and each one of them would make a little
[33:43] different sound you know and it meant
[33:45] something and he would he would say God
[33:47] bless you and then you know somebody
[33:48] would make clicking sounds with their
[33:50] tongue and this this translator would
[33:52] you know speak this language and this
[33:54] one and every every voice has the
[33:56] significance every sound has a
[33:58] significance and um that you know even
[34:01] when we're praying it says that often
[34:03] times the spirit within us groaneth
[34:06] making intercession even that groaning
[34:08] sound is is is a voice that has a
[34:11] meaning to God you may not understand it
[34:13] you may not even know it realize it
[34:15] you're just in your in yourself in
[34:17] prayer and and and and just groaning and
[34:19] you don't even have the words and you
[34:22] just and you just groan in in your
[34:24] spirit and that still has a meaning it
[34:26] still has utter is not without
[34:28] significance amen and so I this morning
[34:32] what I would like to to suggest to you
[34:34] and I I believe that I'll be able to
[34:35] prove it by the scripture is that our
[34:37] lives are a voice that our lives are a
[34:41] voice not not just the words that we
[34:43] speak but the very life that we live is
[34:45] a voice in this generation amen and if
[34:48] you would go and if we had time uh you
[34:51] know we could take a service and and we
[34:53] could talk about how God uses words and
[34:56] and I think it's very interesting that
[34:58] the words voice that the spoken voice
[35:01] the spoken word and light as in God is
[35:05] light God is truth those those two words
[35:08] are inextricably linked and the root
[35:10] words of them are the same amen so voice
[35:14] and light come from the same root
[35:17] words now I I building a foundation so
[35:21] stick with me here and so we we all I
[35:24] look at you you know we come from
[35:26] different places I I'm from the states
[35:28] we have people here from Africa we have
[35:30] people uh you know from different parts
[35:32] of Canada we're all from different parts
[35:34] of the world and we we have uh uh
[35:37] friends listening online right now
[35:39] perhaps or we'll listen in the future
[35:40] and and it's interesting you know that
[35:43] that that we can tell where people are
[35:45] from you know we we look at one another
[35:47] and many times you know you can just
[35:49] tell you don't have to hear somebody
[35:51] speak but you can tell by the way that
[35:52] they're dressed you can tell by their
[35:55] mannerisms and how they conduct
[35:57] themselves that they're from a certain
[35:58] place you know here in the states we we
[36:01] not or in in Canada too we we nod our
[36:04] head yes you know but if you go to India
[36:07] and people are nodding to say yes they
[36:10] they do this they go side decide and so
[36:14] if you see somebody doing that it's a
[36:16] good chance that you well they're from
[36:18] India they're not shaking their head no
[36:20] they're they're saying yeah they agree
[36:22] with you and you're talking to them and
[36:23] they'll be yeah like and the first
[36:25] couple times I seen I was like what on
[36:27] Earth why are they doing that you know
[36:29] and they're just sitting there you know
[36:30] agreeing with you just like you would
[36:32] nod in a conversation oh yeah yeah yeah
[36:34] yeah that's that's very interesting we
[36:36] would nod they're they're sitting there
[36:38] yeah yeah yeah that's interesting so you
[36:41] know the things that we do they say a
[36:43] lot about where we're from they tell us
[36:45] you know it's in America it's very easy
[36:49] to distinguish somebody from
[36:51] Texas versus somebody from New York and
[36:54] you know people from Texas dress just a
[36:56] little a little bit differently more
[36:57] than likely they're going to have cowboy
[36:58] boots on and a cowboy hat you know and
[37:01] and um people from New York well they're
[37:04] just they're just rude and
[37:10] and oh my goodness help us Lord I
[37:14] nothing against New Yorkers but people
[37:16] are different you know people are
[37:17] different where they're from you know we
[37:19] each uh we each have a different culture
[37:22] that we grow up in and so we we are
[37:24] products of that in many ways and how we
[37:26] conduct ourselves and and it's not that
[37:29] not their words it's not their their
[37:32] their language that tells you all often
[37:34] times where a person is from but it is
[37:38] how they conduct
[37:40] themselves amen are are you with me all
[37:44] right all right very good and so I I'm
[37:46] reminded of a story of there was a there
[37:48] was a man from America and he was
[37:49] visiting France and and uh he was
[37:51] walking down the street in Paris you
[37:53] know and he and he uh was wondering
[37:55] about some directions and so in perfect
[37:57] French he stopped a fellow pedestrian
[38:00] and he excuse him M and the and the the
[38:03] the the Frenchman was like oh you're
[38:06] American I can tell if you're looking
[38:08] for McDonald's it's over this way you
[38:12] and he says you know but I have to warn
[38:14] you the uh the sizes are not big like
[38:16] they are in America you know and he's
[38:18] like well how did you know I'm American
[38:20] and the the man just was like looked him
[38:22] up and down he says go on you know how
[38:25] you're addressed you know and then he
[38:28] goes down the street and he and he he
[38:30] stops another person and you know says
[38:33] in French excuse him and there and it's
[38:35] a woman and she she starts uh talking to
[38:37] him he's like well how do you know I'm
[38:40] American and she said she just looks at
[38:42] him and how you're dressed of course and
[38:44] and he says but I'm not dressed any
[38:45] different than you all and she's like
[38:46] well there's no need to attack me
[38:51] you because they they they know their
[38:53] fashion I guess over there but but you
[38:55] know the point being is is is that you
[38:57] can go someplace and how you're dressed
[38:59] is it tells where you're from it tells a
[39:02] story how you conduct yourself um I I
[39:06] think of in in we were my family and I
[39:08] were talking about this here recently
[39:10] around the dinner table how uh you see
[39:13] this this principle in the Bible where
[39:16] uh the in the Book of Judges there was a
[39:19] battle between the tribes and and they
[39:21] were fighting and it came to a point and
[39:23] the the um gileadites they were
[39:26] controlling in a river crossing and and
[39:28] so the enemy came in and as they would
[39:29] come to the river crossing one by one
[39:31] you know trying to escape the battle uh
[39:33] they would ask them to you know hey are
[39:36] are are you are you with us or are are
[39:38] you part of the enemy you know because
[39:39] they were all dressed the same they
[39:41] looked the same they they had the same
[39:43] mannerisms but then it came down to
[39:45] whether or not they could pronounce a
[39:47] word correctly and if they couldn't
[39:48] pronounce the word shth because they
[39:50] couldn't pronounce the sh sound they
[39:52] knew they were of the enemy and and so
[39:56] the the the the the the what I'm trying
[39:59] to labor and lay in here is how that
[40:01] that we have a voice everything we do
[40:04] you know it's it's a a voice when Peter
[40:07] when Peter was in in the Judgment Hall
[40:10] of pilate and he was he was talking you
[40:13] know and and the maid said you know I
[40:16] discern by the manner of your speech
[40:19] that you are a galile and it wasn't the
[40:22] words that Peter was saying it was how
[40:25] he spoke how he conducted himself you
[40:28] know by the way that you conduct
[40:29] yourself I can tell that you were with
[40:32] him amen it wasn't the words he was
[40:36] saying it was how he conducted himself
[40:38] and so everything tells us about about
[40:41] you where you're from and who you are
[40:43] and and we have a voice that speaks Way
[40:46] Beyond just the the physical voice each
[40:49] one of us
[40:50] amen and so they tell us of our our
[40:54] Origins and as I said the the scripture
[40:57] says that no voice is without
[41:00] insignificance and so it doesn't matter
[41:02] today who you are it doesn't matter
[41:04] whether you're behind a pull pit or
[41:06] sitting in a Pew and it doesn't matter
[41:08] if you're 10 years old or 90 years old
[41:11] your life has a voice that must be
[41:14] spoken in this day and age you were
[41:16] called to live in this day amen the life
[41:19] which I now live I live by faith in the
[41:22] Son of God see it it isn't it's
[41:25] something that is happening now a voice
[41:27] must go forth a voice must go forth into
[41:30] this day it didn't stop with brother
[41:32] Brandon it didn't stop in
[41:34] 1965 God go we walk in the light as God
[41:38] is in the light amen and so we we each
[41:41] have a voice that that must be spoken in
[41:43] this day it doesn't matter if you're a
[41:45] housewife or a grandmother your voice is
[41:48] just as important as the voice coming
[41:51] behind this pull pit amen and and we're
[41:55] we're called to speak it it it's all of
[41:58] nature must acknowledge what God has
[42:01] said all of nature must confess the word
[42:04] is true it doesn't matter uh you know we
[42:08] we I I think about it that all all of
[42:11] Nature and I was reading this to my
[42:13] children here the other day that the
[42:15] Ravens cry in the Book of Job it says
[42:17] the Ravens when they have a lack of food
[42:20] cry they cry out to God and I was
[42:23] telling did you realize that animals
[42:25] pray
[42:26] WoW animals pray to God and and
[42:30] everything all of creation must
[42:33] acknowledge God all of them even people
[42:37] you know even when they don't realize it
[42:40] they acknowledge God and and you hear
[42:42] people the the most awful evil person
[42:44] you can you can think of at you know at
[42:47] the work side or whatever and they'll be
[42:49] oh God help me oh God this you know and
[42:51] they say it in vain but they're still
[42:53] acknowledging that there is a Creator a
[42:55] god and every knee must bow and every
[42:58] tongue must confess that Jesus Christ is
[43:00] Lord and so even the animals you know
[43:03] even them I was telling my children all
[43:05] they they all make sounds they all talk
[43:08] and they communicate and they have you
[43:09] know uh if you you live on a you live
[43:13] you have cows you know like there when
[43:16] you grow a cow up and you know you feed
[43:18] them by hand and they they when they see
[43:21] you coming they they're crying for you
[43:23] they're they acknowledge you that you're
[43:25] a part of the her you got the food and
[43:26] they're they're balling when you you
[43:28] know uh your dogs and your cats they
[43:32] speak to you everything has a voice that
[43:34] speaks amen so and so w un to us if we
[43:38] don't speak W un to us if we don't with
[43:41] our voice with our life acknowledge to
[43:43] the Creator well unto us if we who are
[43:46] privileged to partake of this message
[43:48] and to partake of this this this word if
[43:51] we do not take and express it back out
[43:54] amen so
[43:57] uh in Job chapter 12 it says who among
[44:00] all these does not know that the hand of
[44:03] the Lord has done this in whose hand is
[44:05] the life of every living thing and the
[44:07] breath of all mankind does not the ear
[44:10] test the words and the mouth tastes food
[44:15] and so people I I I take that and people
[44:19] listen to what we're saying but more
[44:21] importantly they're watching our words
[44:22] and their ears are testing it they're
[44:24] they're watching us and they're seeing
[44:26] are you going to live What You Preach
[44:29] are you going to live what you confess
[44:32] cuz you're telling me that you're a
[44:34] Christian you're telling me that you
[44:35] believe a certain way but does your life
[44:37] really match up to what you say and and
[44:40] many times it's it's very strange to me
[44:43] that that people in the world people who
[44:45] are nominal Christians or even
[44:47] unbelievers will have a higher standard
[44:50] of Christianity than what we have for
[44:52] ourselves and they'll tell you well I
[44:55] don't think a Christian would would do
[44:56] that well you're you're probably right a
[44:58] Christian should not do that amen and so
[45:02] they're they're testing what we say we
[45:04] are amen and if you talk to people
[45:07] they're watching your life whether or
[45:09] not you ever testify to them and tell
[45:11] them about Malachi 4 Revelations 10:7 if
[45:15] you never speak a word about it they're
[45:17] still testing the the voice that you're
[45:20] uttering with your life to see if it
[45:22] matches what the what is true and they
[45:26] know there's a there's a if they if they
[45:28] are a counterfeit if they are Fallen
[45:31] then they know that there's a real there
[45:33] and they're looking for a
[45:35] real amen we're just we're just living
[45:38] Our Lives brother brandom expressed it
[45:39] often times with the as the principal he
[45:42] was he would gesture to the microphone
[45:44] and he he would say you know this is
[45:45] just a microphone and without it you
[45:48] know it has no life of its own amen and
[45:51] he said but you know like when the voice
[45:53] hits it and the sound comes out out that
[45:56] people can hear it amen and so you know
[45:59] that that's that's what it is is our
[46:01] we're just microphones amen and so when
[46:04] the when the the spirit of God Lives
[46:06] within us and dwells within us it speaks
[46:09] through us to other people it's not us
[46:11] it's not I that liveth but Christ that
[46:14] liveth Amen in our faults in our
[46:17] failures and everything that we do is is
[46:19] is still Christ Living Through us an
[46:22] expression that that God is in his bride
[46:24] God is in his people and he's still
[46:26] speaking to a generation today until
[46:28] that last one should come in amen and so
[46:32] you know we're we're mute we don't have
[46:34] anything to say but God speaks through
[46:36] us and he testifies of through us and
[46:40] you may not think that your life is
[46:42] speaking but I would tell you that it is
[46:45] as a Christian you cannot hide it you
[46:48] cannot hide it the idea of you know we
[46:50] sing the little children's song hide
[46:52] your light under a bush oh no I'm going
[46:54] to let it shine
[46:56] you know you could not hide it if you
[46:58] wanted to you cannot hide it even people
[47:02] who walk away from truth and leave this
[47:05] they cannot hide the fact that they were
[47:07] influenced through years and years of
[47:10] sitting under the the the truth of the
[47:12] hour it still affects and influences
[47:15] everything that they do and say they
[47:16] can't get away from it every sermon that
[47:19] they would go to another uh Church a
[47:21] nominal Christian church every sermon
[47:23] that they hear will be filtered through
[47:25] the L of what they learned sitting under
[47:28] the tutelage of a prophet of this day
[47:30] whether they want to acknowledge it or
[47:32] not they cannot Escape what they have
[47:34] been
[47:35] taught we cannot Escape what what God is
[47:38] trying to speak through US
[47:43] amen seasons will come in our lives that
[47:46] will cause us to
[47:48] speak seasons will come we you know
[47:51] where uh you you just live your life
[47:53] every day you know and you're just
[47:55] living and sometimes you know you're
[47:56] just you're just on this steady track
[47:59] you know you're not up you're not up on
[48:00] the mountain you're not down in the
[48:02] valley you know you're just you're just
[48:03] living life and if you're not speaking
[48:08] if you're not
[48:09] preaching God will put
[48:12] circumstances he will surround you with
[48:15] circumstances to cause your life to
[48:17] speak and who knows you know when you go
[48:19] when you go through trials and when you
[48:21] go through tests and you are you are
[48:24] afflicted In the Flesh or you are
[48:25] Afflicted at work and and who knows that
[48:28] that through your life that you may not
[48:30] have come into this world for such a
[48:32] time as this that you your life would
[48:35] not be for one specific purpose one
[48:38] specific instance to talk to One Soul
[48:41] and save them to give one testimony that
[48:44] that would drop a seed and plant it
[48:46] somewhere that somebody would would
[48:48] never have known about Christianity
[48:49] would never known about the message but
[48:51] yet you were there at one specific point
[48:54] in time that could have been the entire
[48:57] purpose of your life in the grand scheme
[48:59] of of things as God planned things out
[49:01] it could have just been for one moment
[49:04] for one moment for one word a word in
[49:06] due season to save somebody's
[49:08] Soul amen we we sometimes we give
[49:11] ourselves so little credit it's so easy
[49:14] I think to get down on ourselves we were
[49:15] talking last night and we were talking
[49:17] about miracles and you know what you
[49:19] expect and what what is a miracle you
[49:21] know is it is it somebody raising up is
[49:23] it a leg regrowing is it this or is it
[49:26] that but and you know our pastor was
[49:28] saying Miracles are every day we see it
[49:31] every day where people are healed and
[49:33] and this happens in circumstances and it
[49:35] should not have been that way but
[49:36] somehow God has has arranged it that
[49:39] miraculous and you can't explain it and
[49:43] and our lives are a miracle who we are
[49:46] you think about it all the millions and
[49:48] billions of people in this world all of
[49:52] them and yet you are sitting here today
[49:55] sitting under the revealed word of this
[49:57] hour hallelujah what percentage of the
[50:00] population are you what percentage are
[50:03] you have better odds you have better
[50:05] odds going to the convenience store and
[50:07] buying a lotto ticket and winning the
[50:09] biggest jackpot in history all by
[50:11] yourself than than being here sitting
[50:14] today in this church you have won the
[50:17] lottery you have won the lottery you
[50:21] know no one has it as good as we have it
[50:24] no one can have the relationship that we
[50:26] have and to the fact that through all
[50:29] your trials through all your life
[50:30] whether you were born into this message
[50:33] or whether you were you know born in you
[50:35] know In the Backwoods somewhere you came
[50:37] through a specific set of circumstances
[50:40] that allowed you to reach today where
[50:42] you are praise God that he would he
[50:46] would reach down and pull us up amen
[50:54] amen a miracle each one of your
[50:57] Miracles amen I I just I I'm amazed
[51:02] sometimes how how we just we get so
[51:06] complacent and so so it's just common to
[51:09] us you know that we can come and we can
[51:11] hear the word of God and it touches us
[51:14] and we're just like oh good you know
[51:15] it's a wonderful Sunday you know a
[51:17] wonderful Wednesday service you know
[51:18] praise God we'll see you next but we are
[51:21] we are literally hearing from the Throne
[51:23] of God this the literal spirit of God is
[51:29] living within you speaking a voice
[51:32] through you
[51:34] amen how powerful is that talk about a
[51:38] miracle that God could come in our
[51:40] circumstances where we were Sinners and
[51:43] unworthy in drugs in prostitution and
[51:46] alcohol in every situation and God could
[51:49] come and pull us up and out of that and
[51:52] cleanse us and change our lives until we
[51:54] speak Words of
[51:57] Life
[52:00] powerful amen the very fact that you've
[52:02] heard of Jesus Christ the very fact that
[52:04] you're here sitting in the message of
[52:06] the hour tells you something it tells
[52:09] you your position in God it tells you
[52:12] who you are in Christ that you are you
[52:16] know it's like sometime so many times
[52:17] you know like we have this fear you know
[52:19] that we're not going to make it we have
[52:21] this fear that we're not worthy somehow
[52:23] and yet here we are
[52:26] here we
[52:27] are we're we we've made it we are in the
[52:32] safest place that you can be in sitting
[52:35] under the revealed word of the
[52:37] hour we we have arrived the bride is
[52:41] making herself ready right now today the
[52:45] bride is saying come Lord Jesus the
[52:47] bride has made herself ready and all we
[52:49] are doing is just waiting for that time
[52:52] from that anointed time that God has
[52:54] said we're healed will come and take us
[52:56] and I don't I don't believe that we need
[52:58] to stop witnessing and I don't believe
[53:00] that that uh uh we have to just uh you
[53:03] know that we're on coasting you know
[53:05] just just we got it on cruise control no
[53:07] we're still in a battle we're still in a
[53:09] fight but we we have arrived right the
[53:13] word of God said that a people would
[53:15] Express the the man and manifest the
[53:17] word of God in this hour and here you
[53:20] are here you are do you see who you are
[53:24] today
[53:26] you're not you're not Dale you're not
[53:28] Luan you're not Jose you're you are a
[53:31] child of God in the last day how
[53:34] powerful is that
[53:37] amen praise the
[53:39] Lord and so you know here we are and
[53:43] every everything that we speak in our
[53:45] lives it comes from this Foundation of
[53:48] of of the recognition that we are the
[53:51] bride of
[53:52] Christ everything that we do comes and
[53:54] is we stand on this foundation and our
[53:57] lives testify of who we are amen and so
[54:01] each of you as I said you have a unique
[54:03] voice none of none of your voices are
[54:06] are are meaningless you know none of
[54:09] your voices are without
[54:11] significant every voice matters amen
[54:14] some of you are the only voice that
[54:16] others will hear you may never preach
[54:18] this a sermon you may never you know
[54:21] bring somebody and baptize them in the
[54:23] water and baptize them in the name of
[54:24] Jes Jesus Christ but your life is a
[54:27] message all unto itself and it's every
[54:30] one of you are
[54:31] important don't ever don't ever let
[54:34] Satan tell you that you're not important
[54:36] don't ever let Satan tell you that that
[54:38] your life doesn't matter that it would
[54:40] be better that you weren't
[54:42] here Heaven Help Us God help us your
[54:46] voice is is you don't know tomorrow what
[54:49] you might speak to somebody that would
[54:52] be the last one you don't know that
[54:53] tomorrow you might you might might just
[54:55] encounter someone in the in the grocery
[54:57] or at the restaurant and that would be
[54:59] the person who would who would be like
[55:01] you know your life is different there's
[55:03] something about you I don't know what it
[55:04] is I can't put my finger on it and and
[55:07] you and you begin to tell them well I I
[55:10] I once was like you but I Heard a Voice
[55:14] it said come to
[55:15] me
[55:18] amen and I can't live your voice you
[55:21] can't live my voice you know I can't be
[55:23] brother Dell I can't be brother Carson I
[55:26] I can't be brother Tim or or Jared I I
[55:28] can only be me I know I can't come and I
[55:31] you know I don't try to uh preach like
[55:33] somebody else or speak like somebody
[55:35] else I can only be me you know some
[55:36] people are are like well brother John's
[55:38] this way or they might think you're that
[55:40] way or whatever and they have these
[55:41] conceptions and ideas but you you have
[55:43] to be yourself because God has designed
[55:46] you he is from the womb he's formed you
[55:49] in every circumstance of your life has
[55:52] brought you to where you are
[55:54] today amen and and so he has
[55:56] purposefully made you he's molded your
[56:00] life into what you are now and we're not
[56:03] what we're we're going to be thank God
[56:05] we're not what we used to be but God can
[56:07] use us where we're
[56:09] at amen you see because it's the life
[56:12] that I now live I live by the faith in
[56:16] the Son of God the life that I now live
[56:19] I'm not you know I can't go back and
[56:20] relive the
[56:23] past it it's I I I can't go back and and
[56:26] change things that I've done I can only
[56:29] I can only live now it's a present day
[56:32] it's a present day message and I think
[56:33] it's it's interesting now that that you
[56:36] know I when I I grew up you know we were
[56:39] my family we were associated with the
[56:41] message and I I I've had this discussion
[56:44] and we were part of uh what's known as
[56:47] the the Latter-Day rain movement and so
[56:50] we put a lot of emphasis on the Apostle
[56:53] rather than a prophet and we
[56:54] acknowledged the church acknowledged
[56:56] brother brandham as a prophet as as a
[56:58] prophet to the last day yes but they
[57:01] minimized his role and more exalted the
[57:05] Apostle and the teachings of of Apostles
[57:07] and I still from a young age I remember
[57:09] the apostles coming through brother ear
[57:11] hotton just a real godly man and and uh
[57:14] brother brandom talked about that
[57:15] movement and how they had such
[57:16] tremendous love divine love and so
[57:19] that's how I grew up and but I remember
[57:21] as we started associating more and more
[57:23] with message things message churches I I
[57:27] remember going to to one place we were
[57:30] somehow we were related but they were a
[57:32] a tape group and so they would just you
[57:35] know you know press press play you know
[57:38] as a press play Church put the tape in
[57:40] and and you just listen you know brother
[57:42] Brandon says stand up we stand up and
[57:44] brother Brandon says sit down we sit
[57:46] down brother Brandon prays we bow our
[57:47] head you know and there there's nothing
[57:51] wrong with listening tapes we need the
[57:52] tapes but you you can't live in that
[57:57] past amen God sent a prophet yes but the
[58:00] message is still continuing on today
[58:04] because brother brandom said the voice
[58:05] of God is in the bride and the scripture
[58:09] says if we walk in the light as he is in
[58:12] the light then we have Fellowship one
[58:14] with another and the blood of Jesus
[58:15] Christ cleanses us from all sins and so
[58:18] we have to continue walking this isn't
[58:20] just a a a pressed play and it's okay
[58:22] kind of a a message that that things are
[58:24] progressed and now now everything that's
[58:27] been revealed has been revealed the
[58:29] mysteries of God are finished I believe
[58:30] that but God is still revealing himself
[58:32] to us as individuals amen and we're
[58:35] we're still walking it's not done yet it
[58:37] didn't end in
[58:38] 65 amen we can't go back and live uh the
[58:42] the past it's the life that I now live I
[58:46] need a five-fold Ministry I need
[58:49] teachers to teach I need a I need
[58:51] evangelists to stir my soul I need a
[58:53] pastor to to anchor me down when I'm
[58:56] when I'm going through the mud and
[58:57] trials and and I need you know come
[58:59] beside me and help pull the load with me
[59:02] amen we need those people I grew up and
[59:05] I remember so so often we would go down
[59:08] to boy this ain't all my note notes at
[59:10] all but we go down to Jeffersonville uh
[59:12] for Easter services and uh you know you
[59:15] just run into so many different kinds of
[59:17] people you know all the different uh all
[59:22] all of the different fanaticisms that
[59:23] you could think of you know I I
[59:25] encountered them and uh children you
[59:29] know being young we we had very little
[59:31] in the way of filters anyhow and so you
[59:34] know we we heard we heard you know all
[59:37] the fanaticism we heard what people
[59:39] believed and you know Joseph is God or
[59:42] he's you know you know praying to
[59:45] brother brandom you know baptizing in
[59:47] the name of brother brandom and and
[59:49] these different things you know we we
[59:51] rub shoulders with it and it it gave me
[59:53] a bad taste it's like this is a bunch of
[59:56] craziness you know I I I don't want
[59:58] really anything to really do with it you
[1:00:00] know I went my own way and and then I
[1:00:02] had to come back and and I had to find
[1:00:04] the message for myself like we all
[1:00:07] do and those voices you know that they
[1:00:10] they were living they with their mouth
[1:00:12] they were testifying of something and
[1:00:15] then they Twisted it and they gave a
[1:00:18] false witness and a false testimony in
[1:00:22] your life if if you are not careful can
[1:00:25] give a false witness of what you
[1:00:28] believe amen because you can say I
[1:00:30] believe this I believe this but by your
[1:00:32] actions by their fruit you shall know
[1:00:34] them
[1:00:38] amen excuse
[1:00:49] me the life that I now live I just kind
[1:00:51] of scanning through my notes there
[1:00:56] and I I I think many times we fail to
[1:01:03] acknowledge who we
[1:01:05] are that we we you know Lord help me to
[1:01:08] be the bride and none of us brother
[1:01:09] random said you know I don't know that I
[1:01:12] am but by faith I believe I am I believe
[1:01:15] that I will be I don't know but you know
[1:01:17] what it doesn't even matter if if I
[1:01:19] should do all of this and I should make
[1:01:22] all these sacrifices if I should you
[1:01:24] know go to church and and live my life
[1:01:26] you know according to what he has said
[1:01:28] and then if he still would cast me
[1:01:31] away it would still be worth it it would
[1:01:34] be nothing less than what I deserve
[1:01:36] anyway but the grace of God to us as we
[1:01:40] walk in the light as he is in the
[1:01:44] light this this life which I now live
[1:01:47] you know just thinking of that I was
[1:01:49] thinking about it last night I have a
[1:01:50] neighbor uh just a he's a real Goofy
[1:01:54] kind of guy you know he's a little bit
[1:01:56] older than me he's about he's about
[1:01:58] ready to retire and he dresses like he
[1:02:01] is a high schooler I don't know if the
[1:02:04] if the man owns a pair of pants I really
[1:02:07] don't I've never seen him in anything
[1:02:09] but cut off jeans and a and cut off
[1:02:13] t-shirt and he's 50 some years old he's
[1:02:16] about ready to retire and I was talking
[1:02:17] to him one time he was like he's like I
[1:02:19] I've dressed the same way since I've
[1:02:20] been in high school and and I I guess
[1:02:24] that's one way to save money on clothes
[1:02:27] but um he's stuck living in the past
[1:02:32] he's stuck living in the past and we're
[1:02:35] called to live in the now we're called
[1:02:37] to live today aive and and it's it's
[1:02:43] interesting you know how people can can
[1:02:46] get stuck living in the past and let me
[1:02:49] get somewhere with this but uh you know
[1:02:52] I was thinking you know like you think
[1:02:53] about nostal I I like old things I I
[1:02:56] like to dress oldfashioned I guess you
[1:02:58] know and and because I think you know I
[1:03:01] want to dress like a gentlemen you know
[1:03:02] and I liked I like how people carry
[1:03:05] themselves and and and everything so I
[1:03:07] dressed a little bit differently than
[1:03:08] than modern ministers maybe but um I'm
[1:03:13] not stuck in the past I like things in
[1:03:15] in the past I like things I like ideals
[1:03:18] of the past and I like how people were
[1:03:21] were more open and and they were uh more
[1:03:24] uh polite and they were more moral and
[1:03:28] they had better ethical things and and
[1:03:30] you know people didn't walk down the
[1:03:31] street half naked you know back in the
[1:03:34] past and so it's it's easy to like turn
[1:03:36] back to the past and like and look at
[1:03:38] things with a little bit of
[1:03:40] nostalgia but we can't get stuck there
[1:03:43] amen let me get somewhere with this we
[1:03:46] can't get stuck living in the past and
[1:03:49] and the people you know it's it's funny
[1:03:53] I think of all
[1:03:55] the when I when I worked in the factory
[1:03:57] there was a woman uh she did her she did
[1:04:00] her makeup like she stepped right out of
[1:04:02] the
[1:04:03] 1970s and every day and she she dressed
[1:04:07] like the 1970s and her makeup was 1970s
[1:04:10] the music she listened to was 1970s and
[1:04:13] of course you know you know me I was I
[1:04:15] was younger then I was I was like maybe
[1:04:18] 20 years old but I was like she is
[1:04:21] really stuck in the past you know and
[1:04:23] and I talked to her when time and she's
[1:04:25] like no this was the this was the best
[1:04:27] decade it was the greatest you know I I
[1:04:29] was in high school and I did this and I
[1:04:31] you know had this going for me and I was
[1:04:34] a cheerleader and and this and it was so
[1:04:36] wonderful it was so great and she never
[1:04:38] really moved on from that she was always
[1:04:40] living her best life from the
[1:04:44] past and and here we are we're called to
[1:04:46] live in the
[1:04:48] now amen would you agree with that that
[1:04:50] we're called to live in the
[1:04:52] now then let me ask let me ask you a
[1:04:55] question then why is it so easy for us
[1:04:59] to get stuck in the hurts of the
[1:05:04] past why is it so easy for us to be
[1:05:08] consumed with things that have happened
[1:05:10] to us where all our conversations are
[1:05:16] look and I'm guilty of this I'm I I
[1:05:19] tell there is not a sermon that I
[1:05:22] preach that that I preach because I've
[1:05:25] seen
[1:05:26] something I got to deal with this that's
[1:05:28] not who I am I I preach something
[1:05:32] because I'm dealing with it amen this
[1:05:35] this is my life that I'm preaching to
[1:05:37] you this is my voice that I'm giving to
[1:05:39] you amen and I I asked myself why why do
[1:05:43] we get so stuck on things that happen to
[1:05:47] us and we can't get past them when I'm
[1:05:50] called to live
[1:05:52] now amen
[1:05:55] and we get stuck on on people who hurt
[1:05:58] us and people who abused us whether it
[1:06:00] was in our childhood or growing growing
[1:06:02] up or or churches that we've attended
[1:06:04] and and and things that have happened to
[1:06:06] us and we get stuck and everything
[1:06:07] becomes filtered through this lens of of
[1:06:10] my pain where I've been unfairly abused
[1:06:13] or I've been wounded and we and we can't
[1:06:16] move on we can't live as we want to live
[1:06:19] we can't worship as we want to worship
[1:06:21] because we are still stuck living and
[1:06:24] being influenced by the
[1:06:28] past that's me I just confessed it to
[1:06:31] you so many times I I can't break
[1:06:36] through like I want because my mind is
[1:06:39] is dealing with stuff that happened
[1:06:41] years
[1:06:43] ago help us Lord God because I I I say
[1:06:47] this because I know I'm not the only one
[1:06:49] I'm not the only one that because it's
[1:06:51] human nature each one of us has a story
[1:06:55] that we've come from there's there's
[1:06:57] things that we've gone through things
[1:06:58] that battles that we've fought that have
[1:07:01] that affected
[1:07:04] us hurts that we've endured and it's
[1:07:09] high time that I get past some of it
[1:07:13] it's high time that I that I start
[1:07:16] living in the Now by faith in the Lord
[1:07:19] Jesus
[1:07:21] Christ
[1:07:22] amen
[1:07:25] I'm called to manifest a life I'm called
[1:07:29] to manifest a voice that was spoken it
[1:07:32] it it wasn't just William brandom and
[1:07:35] that that ended it it wasn't just Wesley
[1:07:39] or Luther or or any of those great great
[1:07:42] men of God that that would come and
[1:07:44] would speak but it has to come down to a
[1:07:46] people and a people has to utter a voice
[1:07:50] to this generation wherever you're at
[1:07:53] amen the Prophet Joel prophesied and and
[1:07:57] said and it shall come to pass afterward
[1:07:59] that I will pour out my spirit on All
[1:08:01] Flesh and your sons and your daughters
[1:08:03] shall prophesy and your old men shall
[1:08:05] dream dreams and your young men shall
[1:08:07] see visions and then hundreds of years
[1:08:10] later Peter and the apostles stumble out
[1:08:13] of the the the upper room and they begin
[1:08:17] manifesting this scripture they begin
[1:08:20] manifesting it and it wasn't and I was
[1:08:23] thinking about this the other day it
[1:08:24] wasn't just that it listen to me now it
[1:08:27] wasn't just that that Peter and and Paul
[1:08:30] or Paul wasn't there but that John and
[1:08:33] the different ones that you know they
[1:08:34] finally got into one Accord and Harmony
[1:08:36] the Holy Spirit came down you know that
[1:08:38] was it that wasn't the scene that wasn't
[1:08:41] the entire scene the scene was remember
[1:08:45] remember how brother brandom talks about
[1:08:47] the vision and he saids you know certain
[1:08:48] things have to come into place before it
[1:08:50] can come to pass you know the cat has to
[1:08:54] be sitting here this person has to be
[1:08:56] sitting here when they came out of the
[1:08:58] upper when everything happened it
[1:09:00] happened exactly and specifically when
[1:09:03] God said it would happen amen that the
[1:09:06] time had come and it wasn't just that
[1:09:09] the apostles got into the right frame of
[1:09:11] mind and the Holy Spirit came down
[1:09:13] because they had they had done it that
[1:09:15] wasn't it all the people on the street
[1:09:19] Every Nation every Kindred every tongue
[1:09:22] in that in that known Roman world had to
[1:09:24] be there witness in Jerusalem amen this
[1:09:28] was a when this happened this was like
[1:09:29] one of the busiest times B busiest
[1:09:32] Festival there people from all over the
[1:09:34] empire were gathered there and they were
[1:09:36] all represented just random not random
[1:09:39] but uh just people from every Walk of
[1:09:42] Life Tradesmen and vendors and sellers
[1:09:46] and and and uh laborers it all had came
[1:09:51] and it all arrived just in time for the
[1:09:54] for the Holy Ghost to come down into the
[1:09:56] upper room and these men to stumble out
[1:09:59] and be be viewed and that prophecy was
[1:10:03] being fulfilled and being made manifest
[1:10:06] and it wasn't just for the apostles it
[1:10:08] wasn't just you know the Holy Spirit
[1:10:10] came down and that was it you know and
[1:10:11] so they just they just came out and you
[1:10:14] know
[1:10:14] Peter all of a sudden something was
[1:10:17] being made
[1:10:18] manifest you catching it's something
[1:10:20] something had been spoken hundreds of
[1:10:22] years ago with suddenly coming into
[1:10:25] reality amen and and those men all the
[1:10:29] nations all the tongues all of them
[1:10:32] heard the gospel in their own
[1:10:36] language their that voice came through
[1:10:38] and it spoke to every person they didn't
[1:10:41] have to to hear you know they didn't
[1:10:43] have to sit there and watch somebody's
[1:10:45] life they didn't have to but see it had
[1:10:46] to become made manifest so people could
[1:10:49] could grab what good would it be what
[1:10:51] good would it be if if somebody came
[1:10:54] if Jesus came and and he he opened the
[1:10:56] scroll and said you know this day the
[1:10:58] scripture is fulfilled and he set it
[1:11:00] aside and disappeared into the dustbins
[1:11:02] of History what good would it be if
[1:11:04] brother brandom came and Malachi he said
[1:11:06] you know uh Malachi 4 is is fulfilled
[1:11:10] and the hearts of the children are
[1:11:11] turned back to the the fathers put the
[1:11:14] Bible down and disappear what good would
[1:11:15] it be if there wasn't a
[1:11:18] manifestation if there wasn't something
[1:11:20] to look at if if God God doesn't send
[1:11:22] his word in speak it and it's just it's
[1:11:25] just goes out there and doesn't
[1:11:26] accomplish something amen God doesn't
[1:11:29] speak his word aimlessly and he doesn't
[1:11:31] speak it aimlessly in this day that
[1:11:33] there has to be a people who will Who
[1:11:35] will manifest through their lives what
[1:11:38] God Said would be amen there will be a
[1:11:41] people there will be an overcomer there
[1:11:43] will be a bride there will be someone
[1:11:45] who who manifests the word of God in
[1:11:47] this
[1:11:49] day amen it wasn't it wasn't just uh
[1:11:52] them stumbling out out of the the upper
[1:11:54] room and Peter preaches a sermon but
[1:11:56] that was something that had Ripple
[1:11:58] effects throughout eternity that people
[1:12:01] would would say you know they would they
[1:12:03] would hear that and it say that they
[1:12:04] were converted and baptized and I I off
[1:12:07] the top of my head I think it was like
[1:12:08] 5,000 people baptized but then they took
[1:12:10] what they heard just that little bit and
[1:12:13] they went back to their Kingdom to their
[1:12:15] corner of the Kingdom hundreds of miles
[1:12:17] away or a thousand miles away wherever
[1:12:19] they were from and then they started
[1:12:20] sharing you know I was in Jerusalem and
[1:12:23] you know something was strange this
[1:12:24] happened and they began to speak and
[1:12:25] they told us this and you know I was
[1:12:27] baptized into this new faith and and so
[1:12:29] it had Ripple effects throughout history
[1:12:32] throughout time and and your voice the
[1:12:34] life that you live has Ripple effects
[1:12:37] you don't know that you touched what's
[1:12:39] one person this one time this one
[1:12:41] circumstance and that then that person
[1:12:43] talks to this person and this person and
[1:12:45] all of a sudden you know you're in
[1:12:47] heaven and you're getting a crown for
[1:12:48] something you didn't even know you did
[1:12:51] wow thank you Lord
[1:12:55] Amen in Romans
[1:12:57] 10:18 it says but I say have they not
[1:13:01] heard yes indeed their sound has gone
[1:13:05] out to all the Earth and their words to
[1:13:08] the ends of the world not just their
[1:13:12] words but I would say their
[1:13:15] voices the those voices have echoed
[1:13:19] throughout time and are still going
[1:13:22] forth and accomplish in what God had
[1:13:25] intended amen The Voice you know and the
[1:13:28] life that you live that it's going to
[1:13:30] have an effect throughout time as long
[1:13:34] as we're here your testimony will have
[1:13:36] an effect it people will will know who
[1:13:40] you are and God doesn't speak his word
[1:13:42] without a purpose it it goes forth and
[1:13:44] it accomplishes that which he has
[1:13:46] intended amen it's not it's not just a
[1:13:49] boomerang where he throws it out and it
[1:13:50] flies back to him I said it and okay
[1:13:52] puts it back back in his pocket and he's
[1:13:54] done no it goes out and it has to
[1:13:56] accomplish something whether he says let
[1:13:59] there be light or whether he says there
[1:14:01] will be a bride whether it's it's you
[1:14:04] know he creates something and he speaks
[1:14:05] his word and he creates something or
[1:14:08] it's it's uh you know by if you believe
[1:14:11] on the
[1:14:12] sacrifice if you do this then I promise
[1:14:15] you this will happen and it has to
[1:14:18] happen
[1:14:20] amen he said in in Malachi that message
[1:14:23] would go forth that would turn the
[1:14:25] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:14:27] and the hearts of the children to the
[1:14:29] fathers but that word had to go to to a
[1:14:35] people then who could live
[1:14:37] it amen there had to be a there had to
[1:14:39] be somebody who could receive the seed
[1:14:42] word and then inculcate and germinate
[1:14:46] that word and birth Christ in their life
[1:14:49] amen it couldn't just go it didn't just
[1:14:51] go to like random people out out there
[1:14:55] you know the the the the parable you
[1:14:58] know he's casting seed here casting it
[1:15:00] here and wherever it lands that's true
[1:15:02] but the point is is that that some of
[1:15:04] that seed found the good ground some of
[1:15:07] that seed found the ground that it was
[1:15:09] intended for amen the the seed when he
[1:15:12] scattered it it wasn't intended for the
[1:15:13] rocks it wasn't intended for the bad
[1:15:16] soil it was intended for the good soil
[1:15:18] amen you are that good soil the word was
[1:15:22] intended for you
[1:15:23] it wasn't intended for the for the the
[1:15:26] random person out there who you know boy
[1:15:29] that just s that just sounds awful as a
[1:15:31] preacher it wasn't just intended for the
[1:15:34] brother random said Canon
[1:15:36] father Lord help
[1:15:38] us I'm so glad that I don't know who
[1:15:41] Who's Who Hallelujah I'm so glad that
[1:15:44] you know I'm just called just to spread
[1:15:45] the seed and not make a decision of
[1:15:48] who's in The Bride and who's got the
[1:15:50] real message and who's got the real
[1:15:52] Revelation and and you know and we have
[1:15:54] to preach in this circle and we have to
[1:15:56] understand it this
[1:15:58] way amen I'm I'm so glad that I'm I'm
[1:16:01] not making those calls but this word has
[1:16:03] to go out and it has to go out to all
[1:16:06] the Earth and that's that's where we are
[1:16:09] today and brother brandom said this in
[1:16:12] uh why little Bethlehem he said oh God
[1:16:15] anoint us with Thy word and bring Thy
[1:16:18] word promised to this day to pass

[1:16:45] God may we go with the sword at
[1:16:47] glittering in the air to cut away every
[1:16:49] weight and everything else all the may
[1:16:52] cut away the the depression may it cut
[1:16:55] away the anxiety may it cut away the
[1:16:58] past and the hurts of the
[1:17:00] past lay aside every weight that would
[1:17:03] so easily beset us until we can get back
[1:17:07] the people to
[1:17:09] Christ amen he said in in the third
[1:17:12] sill I I just I just think this is so so
[1:17:16] astounding he said they they miss him
[1:17:20] the Living Word manifest Ed In the Flesh
[1:17:24] by the word that is Promised the word
[1:17:27] promised to do these things the promise
[1:17:30] was made that it will be like this in
[1:17:33] the last
[1:17:34] days and yet people miss it people miss

[1:17:40] world the World Hears us and they see
[1:17:42] our they they may come and view this
[1:17:45] this service or they might see your life
[1:17:47] and and they might not know what it is
[1:17:49] the sound going forth they might not
[1:17:51] ever link your life to brother
[1:17:54] brandom but they know that your life is
[1:17:57] not a Methodist life you're not a
[1:18:02] Methodist you don't produce you don't

[1:18:13] Lutheran you don't you don't look maybe
[1:18:16] you might look a little kind of like
[1:18:19] Pentecostals you kind of like that
[1:18:20] Pentecostal
[1:18:21] experience but there's still something a
[1:18:23] little bit different you know people
[1:18:27] people they they they don't know what
[1:18:29] the sound is but they know they're
[1:18:31] something a little different you know
[1:18:32] you're sitting how many times do you sit
[1:18:34] in the restaurant this doesn't happen to
[1:18:36] me so much now you know that that our
[1:18:37] children are a little bit older but I'm
[1:18:39] sure it's happened to you and you you've
[1:18:41] experienced that that you're in the
[1:18:42] restaurant and people just come up to
[1:18:44] you and they're just like oh we just
[1:18:46] have to compliment you your family is so
[1:18:48] beautiful you guys are so
[1:18:50] clean there's something different about
[1:18:52] about you you know your children you
[1:18:54] know they're so polite they're so you
[1:18:56] know they're so well-mannered and well
[1:18:58] behaved and and of course you know
[1:19:00] that's that's only a small percentage of
[1:19:02] the time they're under
[1:19:07] threat but they see something has
[1:19:10] happened to each each one of you I has
[1:19:12] that happened to you when somebody comes
[1:19:15] raise your hand has that happened to you
[1:19:17] that somebody's come up keep keep your
[1:19:18] hand up for me keep your hand up has it
[1:19:20] ever happened where somebody's come up
[1:19:22] to you and been like there's something
[1:19:24] just a little bit different about
[1:19:26] you that's a
[1:19:28] miracle that's the word of God expressed
[1:19:31] through your
[1:19:32] life amen you ought to thank God for
[1:19:36] that you ought to thank god
[1:19:40] wow people they you know they they say
[1:19:44] they they talk to you and they I know
[1:19:46] you're not from around here I I remember
[1:19:49] one time I I like to tell this story I
[1:19:51] was in a cab in in in New York and uh
[1:19:55] the uh the cab driver he was talking to
[1:19:58] me he was taking me to the train station
[1:19:59] so I could get on a train and um so we
[1:20:02] were just chitchatting he says you know
[1:20:04] now you're not you're not from around
[1:20:05] here now most of the time when I'm when
[1:20:07] I'm from you know my background is in
[1:20:09] the South you know so if I'm not careful
[1:20:11] I slip into a Southern accent especially
[1:20:14] if I'm a little bit nervous or if I'm
[1:20:15] really
[1:20:16] relaxed but uh so most of the time when
[1:20:18] people catch me they then they say
[1:20:20] you're not from around here they're like
[1:20:22] oh you you must be from like Georgia or
[1:20:24] Tennessee or somewhere way down south
[1:20:27] you know and and my my people are all
[1:20:30] from Kentucky Tennessee but so that's
[1:20:32] how most people you know say well you're
[1:20:34] different you're not from around here to
[1:20:36] me well this this this guy says no I
[1:20:39] know you're not from around here I oh

[1:20:44] nice you're
[1:20:46] nice and you know it it wasn't you know
[1:20:50] my language it wasn't it it wasn't how I
[1:20:53] was
[1:20:54] dressed it was just the way that I
[1:20:57] carried myself it's it was something
[1:20:59] just a little bit different than than
[1:21:01] what he was used to dealing with I I
[1:21:03] know you're not from around here people
[1:21:05] look at you and they look at your life
[1:21:07] how and how you're dressed and how you
[1:21:09] conduct yourselves and they say you know
[1:21:13] that person's not from around here I
[1:21:15] wonder where they're
[1:21:17] from I could I can tell you I came from
[1:21:20] the mind of God
[1:21:23] I'm not from around here I I may live in
[1:21:27] Canada I may live here in petroia or
[1:21:29] Wyoming or or or Ontario but but my home
[1:21:33] my residence is not from here my
[1:21:35] background is not from here my
[1:21:37] background is of a is from a different
[1:21:41] Kingdom
[1:21:43] Amen brother brandom says and the the
[1:21:45] sea will not be air with the Shu I love
[1:21:48] this he that this great mystery of God
[1:21:51] made known
[1:21:53] understand how that God was in Christ
[1:21:56] reconciling himself to the world how
[1:21:58] that he and the father were one how that
[1:22:00] the the great Mysteries of the
[1:22:02] fulfilling of God and taking and
[1:22:04] bringing himself listen to this
[1:22:07] manifested in the age of human beings
[1:22:11] and in the strain the genetics in the
[1:22:15] strain of human beings and in the
[1:22:17] company of human beings to make his word
[1:22:21] manifest
[1:22:23] in the day and then he goes on he says
[1:22:26] in the Eastern rising of the Sun and to
[1:22:30] do the same thing as the sun sets in the
[1:22:35] west listen to this to make his
[1:22:40] manifested in a bride
[1:22:42] Church the word made
[1:22:48] manifest that's
[1:22:50] powerful that God spoke his word and it
[1:22:54] had to come and it has to be made
[1:22:57] manifest in this
[1:22:59] flesh that gets old where our hair falls
[1:23:02] out it turns gray and we get fat and in
[1:23:06] our flesh where we say things we ought
[1:23:08] not to say and we have attitudes we
[1:23:09] ought not to have and we we fail and we
[1:23:13] fall short that God still manifests his
[1:23:16] life in this flesh the word made
[1:23:20] manifest today is who you are are each
[1:23:23] one of you the word of God that he spoke
[1:23:27] that he had in his mind before the
[1:23:29] foundation of the world and he said
[1:23:31] there let there be a Tim let there be a
[1:23:35] Vicki let there be an Amy than you Lord
[1:23:38] and that word just went out and it kept
[1:23:41] going through Time and Eternity until
[1:23:44] finally the right things came together
[1:23:46] and the right people got together and
[1:23:49] and this person married this person and
[1:23:50] they had this child and this and this
[1:23:52] and this finally that word could be made
[1:23:54] manifest and here you are
[1:23:57] today oh
[1:23:59] my for such a time as this we have come
[1:24:03] into the
[1:24:04] world let me see how much I can skip
[1:24:09] here amen I I I may mention earlier how
[1:24:13] how the uh the root words of light and
[1:24:17] voice come down to the same thing in
[1:24:19] God's language God God often uses them
[1:24:21] interchangeable in Zechariah
[1:24:23] 14:7 it shall be one day which is known
[1:24:28] to the Lord neither day nor night but at
[1:24:30] evening time it shall happen that it
[1:24:33] will be light maybe I could say it like
[1:24:35] this that at evening time there will be
[1:24:38] a voice in the evening time there will
[1:24:41] be a voice that voice didn't stop then
[1:24:43] but that voice is continuing on being
[1:24:45] spoken in the bride if you don't believe
[1:24:48] me you can go back and read what your
[1:24:49] Prophet said he said the voice of God
[1:24:52] will be in the bride nobody else has the
[1:24:56] voice amen and the voice didn't stop
[1:24:58] it's still here it's still going forth
[1:25:00] It's still speaking lives are still
[1:25:02] being spoken a testimony of God
[1:25:07] Amen I am that light in the evening time
[1:25:11] I am that
[1:25:13] manifestation I am what God Said would
[1:25:15] come to pass I am that God said there
[1:25:18] will be an overcomer that's me I see
[1:25:21] myself in Scripture
[1:25:23] I see myself fulfilling the word of God
[1:25:25] I see it I see where it said that that
[1:25:28] as many that shall receive the Holy
[1:25:31] Ghost to their children as many as
[1:25:33] called as many far that's me I was there
[1:25:35] I that word was spoken over me and now
[1:25:37] I've stepped into it amen that there
[1:25:40] would be a there would be children whose
[1:25:42] Faith would be turned back to the
[1:25:43] apostolic fathers that's me I see myself
[1:25:46] in scripture amen I'm not looking and
[1:25:49] saying oh you know Revelation 10:7 or or
[1:25:51] Matthew 7 or this or that you know that
[1:25:53] was the Fulfillment you know and I tried
[1:25:55] to I'm not identified I'm identified
[1:25:57] with that and how I believe but as far
[1:25:59] as for me and who I am I see myself in
[1:26:01] Scripture that there will be a bride
[1:26:03] amen that there will be Overcomers in
[1:26:05] this last day and I'm stepping into that
[1:26:07] scripture I'm stepping into the
[1:26:09] Fulfillment the manifestation of that
[1:26:11] word amen his voice is in you his voice
[1:26:15] is in the
[1:26:17] bride in Revelation 10:7 we'll just
[1:26:20] closing now he says uh I know I know
[1:26:23] you're all familiar with it but let me
[1:26:24] read it but in the days of the sounding
[1:26:26] of the seventh angel when he is about to
[1:26:28] sound and the Mystery of God would be
[1:26:30] finished as he declared to his servants
[1:26:32] the prophets then the voice which I
[1:26:35] heard from Heaven spoke to me again and
[1:26:36] said go and take the little book which
[1:26:38] is open in the hand of the Angel who
[1:26:41] stands on the sea and on the earth and
[1:26:42] so I went to the angel and and I give me
[1:26:45] the little book and he said take it and
[1:26:47] eat it and you remember that in the in
[1:26:51] the in his mouth that was sweet as honey
[1:26:53] but when it got into his stomach it was
[1:26:56] bitter you know like the digestion of it
[1:27:00] you know this word you know takes some
[1:27:02] going over sometimes you got to digest
[1:27:05] it it's not easy you can't just take the
[1:27:07] word you know it's like oh yeah that
[1:27:08] sounds real good but you know you get it
[1:27:09] in your stomach and you start digesting
[1:27:11] it and you go home and you get into the
[1:27:13] scripture yourself and you start
[1:27:14] searching things out and you start
[1:27:17] saying oh my I can't live this way I see
[1:27:20] in my I see in the word that I'm not
[1:27:21] spoken supposed to do this I see in the
[1:27:23] word that I'm supposed to act a little
[1:27:25] bit different than the world that I'm
[1:27:26] not supposed to love the things of the
[1:27:28] world I don't want to love this I don't
[1:27:30] want to pursue this and so it's bitter
[1:27:33] but then he goes on and he says he says
[1:27:36] You must prophesy
[1:27:38] again to many peoples Nations and
[1:27:41] tongues and kings and and that wasn't
[1:27:42] just John prophesying but that voice had
[1:27:45] to come and be manifested in this day
[1:27:49] this day that there would be a people
[1:27:51] who would prophesy Pro a prophetic
[1:27:53] people brother brandom said that would
[1:27:55] be speaking the word of God to All
[1:27:57] Nations all people all kingdoms all
[1:27:59] tongues that none would be without
[1:28:01] excuse that all people would hear and so
[1:28:05] we have to take it and speak each one of
[1:28:10] us where else could this have been
[1:28:12] fulfilled but this
[1:28:13] time where else that this word that was
[1:28:16] spoken nearly 2,000 years ago to All
[1:28:18] Nations all kindreds all tongues when
[1:28:21] could have been fulfilled until
[1:28:24] today not even in brother Brandon's time
[1:28:27] it could not have truly have been
[1:28:30] fulfilled and today we have
[1:28:34] these instant access to everything
[1:28:37] instant access to to every corner of the
[1:28:40] globe every every part of the the world
[1:28:43] every nation every tongue every Kindred
[1:28:46] it doesn't matter where you are you can
[1:28:48] you can get on one of these things just
[1:28:50] about look up the everything you want to
[1:28:53] know it could only be in this day that
[1:28:55] they could be fulfilled like
[1:28:57] this and we put this on the internet
[1:28:59] just this little little sermon you know
[1:29:02] there'll be people who watch it from
[1:29:04] Uganda there'll be people who watch it
[1:29:06] from Jamaica there'll be people who
[1:29:07] watch it from from Vietnam somebody from
