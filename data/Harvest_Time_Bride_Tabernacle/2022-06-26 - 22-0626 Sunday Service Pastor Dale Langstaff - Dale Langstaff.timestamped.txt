[32:12] you know she still loves us she'll be
[32:13] listening online and
[32:16] just life sometimes comes in like a
[32:18] flood
[32:20] and then also
[32:21] jim and linda and chatham we also talk
[32:23] to them regularly
[32:26] man and just sister linda's very poorly
[32:30] and also brother john blackman we seen
[32:32] him yesterday
[32:34] he said to greet the church and send you
[32:36] his love and
[32:37] he uh
[32:39] he just can't
[32:40] walk he's just not an old man 69
[32:45] with basically no legs
[32:48] man just so god would
[32:50] he's not happy just being locked in a
[32:53] room
[32:54] you know it's just kind of
[32:57] life
[32:58] life can be kind of
[33:00] tough amen we just remember
[33:03] our brothers and sisters and our friends
[33:05] in christ amen
[33:07] amen let's just turn to scriptures
[33:12] uh
[33:14] matthew 12
[33:16] 34 we're going to start with
[33:19] and
[33:20] i want to preach on
[33:23] i believe god wants to preach on
[33:24] something
[33:26] this morning
[33:29] what
[33:31] what is in your cup
[33:34] what is in your cup
[33:39] we're going to read to 37 o generation
[33:42] of vipers how
[33:44] can ye be an evil speak good things for
[33:47] out of the abundance
[33:50] of the heart
[33:52] the mouth speakest
[33:53] and a good man out of the good treasure
[33:55] of his heart bringeth forth good things
[33:57] and an evil man out of the evil
[33:59] treasures
[34:00] bringeth forth
[34:02] evil things you can judge the whole
[34:04] world
[34:05] on those two scriptures
[34:07] but i say unto you that every idle word
[34:12] that's powerful
[34:14] that a man shall speak he shall give an
[34:17] account therefore
[34:20] on the day of judgment i
[34:23] i don't want to be in that spot amen
[34:27] 20 or 37 for by thy words shall doubt be
[34:33] justified
[34:35] and by thy words
[34:38] shalt thou be
[34:40] condemned
[34:42] wow
[34:44] that's powerful so we have a choice
[34:47] galatians 5
[34:49] 13 to 17 galatians 5 13 17 for brethren
[34:53] ye have been called on to liberty not
[34:57] only use not liberty for the occasion
[35:01] to the flesh
[35:02] but to love
[35:05] serve one another now we were preaching
[35:07] that
[35:08] christianity is living for others for
[35:10] the law is fulfilled in one word even
[35:13] this thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[35:16] thyself but if thou bite and devour one
[35:19] another take heed that you not consume
[35:22] each other
[35:23] for this i say then walk in the spirit
[35:25] and ye shall not fulfill
[35:28] not fulfill the lust of the flesh for
[35:31] the flesh blesses after the spirit
[35:33] and the spirit against
[35:36] the flesh and these are contrary one to
[35:39] another so that ye cannot do the things
[35:44] that ye would
[35:46] hallelujah you may have your seats and
[35:48] we just ask the lord to
[35:50] bless his word in a special way amen
[35:54] we thank him
[35:56] for that amen you know
[35:59] i want to give you a little
[36:01] uh scenario here before we look into
[36:05] god's word this morning and we're going
[36:06] to look at a bunch of examples in god's
[36:08] word
[36:09] situations people that came into
[36:11] situations the same as we do
[36:15] same as each one of us do in our daily
[36:17] watch amen
[36:19] and so i want you to think of this
[36:22] compare this uh
[36:27] and this will help you i believe
[36:29] with this thought that we want what's in
[36:32] your cup
[36:34] you think of this that you got a cup
[36:37] of coffee
[36:38] and somebody comes by
[36:41] and carelessly bumps
[36:43] into you spilling your coffee
[36:46] everywhere
[36:48] and i want to ask you
[36:53] what spilled your coffee
[36:56] and you would look at me kind of
[37:01] say isn't it kind of obvious
[37:04] somebody carelessly recklessly
[37:08] bumped into you
[37:10] bumped into me and spilled my coffee
[37:14] but i want you to look at that a
[37:15] different way
[37:18] because if you would have had tea in
[37:20] your cup you wouldn't have spilled
[37:22] coffee
[37:26] and if you wouldn't had nothing in your
[37:28] cup
[37:30] nothing would have came out of your cup
[37:33] and life gives us all cups
[37:37] and what you have in your cup
[37:40] when the world comes in on you
[37:43] will depend
[37:45] on what you spill
[37:53] now we're all going to be hit
[37:56] by cares and things of the world and
[37:58] people
[38:00] but what are you going to spill out of
[38:02] your cup
[38:03] are you gonna spill the fruits of the
[38:05] spirit
[38:06] which are love patience
[38:09] meekness
[38:10] goodness
[38:12] longsuffering
[38:14] gentle
[38:16] forgiveness
[38:17] for bearing one another
[38:22] or is you're gonna spill all over you
[38:26] envy
[38:28] hate
[38:29] malice
[38:32] evil speaking
[38:36] you say oh i would never ever even
[38:40] go there on these things
[38:43] we all deal with that every day
[38:47] every day i want to tell you a story to
[38:50] start out with the profit and its
[38:51] questions and answers and i i'm sorry
[38:54] but i just uh i just feel i want to read
[38:56] some of this because it's just so
[38:58] amazing it just is
[39:00] our sermon in a nutshell he said now if
[39:03] the spirit of elijah was on john then it
[39:05] makes john act like
[39:07] elijah and if the spirit of god
[39:09] is upon you you will act like jesus
[39:13] now there's where you find
[39:15] the holy spirit see the holy spirit does
[39:18] it and it makes you meek and makes you
[39:20] humble
[39:21] and it makes you
[39:23] forgiving
[39:25] could they pull
[39:26] the whiskers of your face
[39:30] and if you had them there
[39:32] could they jerk out and spit on your
[39:34] face
[39:35] and would you have the power
[39:38] when could they pull out your whiskers
[39:40] and spit in your face when you had the
[39:41] power to call the legions
[39:44] of an army
[39:48] could you do that for the love of the
[39:50] people
[39:51] that was spitting in your face could you
[39:53] do it
[39:54] if someone could just walk up to you and
[39:56] say you're a hypocrite and smack you on
[39:59] one side of the face
[40:01] could you pray
[40:03] for their forgiveness
[40:05] he said now that's where
[40:07] the test whether you got it
[40:10] or not
[40:11] whether you got the holy spirit or not
[40:13] when someone says evil against someone
[40:15] and sometimes claims to have the holy
[40:17] spirit now watch this when someone says
[40:19] something evil against someone
[40:22] sometimes that claims to have the holy
[40:24] spirit and i'll even with i now even
[40:27] that up with her
[40:29] if it takes me until my last days
[40:33] he said now that's where you check
[40:36] your holy spirit
[40:39] wow
[40:40] you'll get eve uh he said blessed
[40:44] are they
[40:45] that say all manner of evil against you
[40:47] for my sake so so often rejoice in be
[40:50] exceedingly glad for before you
[40:52] so persecuted they the prophets
[40:55] and then someone would say evil to you
[40:58] about you
[40:59] and you would say something good if you
[41:01] can't say something good about them then
[41:04] don't say nothing at all
[41:07] but pray for them
[41:10] and if there's one thing in life that
[41:12] helped me now this is our prophet
[41:13] talking this question is the answer 59
[41:16] he said if there's one thing in life
[41:18] that helped me understand what the holy
[41:20] spirit was
[41:22] when it came down there
[41:23] to me and that day
[41:26] that i was a hot-headed
[41:28] furious irish
[41:32] on both sides
[41:41] and he said i could go
[41:44] i could hardly eat sorry i was watching
[41:46] that i could hardly eat because my mouth
[41:49] god bless you brother fred i could
[41:51] hardly eat because my mouth was smashed
[41:53] in from fights
[41:55] because i had such a short temper
[41:58] this is our vindicated prophet
[42:02] he said
[42:03] people would jump up he said if people
[42:06] got my fury up he said if they were so
[42:08] big i had to get on a stepladder i would
[42:10] beat the
[42:12] right out of them
[42:16] huh
[42:17] he said i had an old teacher one time
[42:21] she said i was getting in trouble every
[42:23] day
[42:24] just fighting every day people would
[42:26] make fun of me they made fun of my hair
[42:29] they made fun when he moved to indiana
[42:31] because he was from kentucky that made
[42:33] fun of his english and he said i would
[42:34] just two or three boys would be
[42:36] circled me
[42:38] and he said i would beat them and they
[42:39] would beat me
[42:41] he said this teacher came out and she's
[42:43] give me a string
[42:46] she loved brother billy and
[42:48] and she cried over him and she just
[42:51] wanted him to do well she said billy
[42:53] when when that happens again he said
[42:55] take your string out of your pocket
[42:58] and tie knots
[43:02] and tie the knots
[43:05] so everything's
[43:08] under control
[43:10] and so this teacher loved me
[43:13] she cried over the top of me and said
[43:15] these things and so
[43:17] first time out in the playground these
[43:19] boys jumped me
[43:20] i said i pulled that string out and i
[43:22] tried to tie one knot
[43:24] said i dropped that string on the ground
[43:27] and i give them a pounding
[43:31] of course they
[43:33] amen
[43:38] he said one time you know the story when
[43:41] the three boys beat up on them so bad
[43:43] they almost left them for dad
[43:45] he said i went home and he said i got my
[43:47] winchester rifle
[43:50] and he said there was four or five of
[43:51] the boys that beat me so i could hardly
[43:53] stand up and he said i would have shot
[43:55] all four of them
[43:58] see
[44:00] that was in his cup
[44:06] he said i was only about 20 12 then a
[44:08] hot temper and the teacher said he said
[44:10] you take that string and he said when
[44:12] you get mad tie knots
[44:15] he said when you do that it'll bring the
[44:16] string back to me
[44:18] and it'll beat your temper
[44:23] he told her i'll try to do that
[44:29] man
[44:32] of course it never happened
[44:34] he said mr billy talked to himself he
[44:37] said i could never be
[44:39] a christian
[44:42] he said but let me tell you some
[44:45] he said down there in
[44:46] in ohio the ave
[44:49] when the holy spirit came down on me
[44:51] he said it settled the temper
[44:54] matter
[44:55] right there
[44:57] he said that was over see what was in
[44:59] his cup
[45:01] changed
[45:02] it changed he said it was over he said i
[45:05] could never do that
[45:07] he said at the time he said i could
[45:09] never be a christian because i couldn't
[45:11] get over it but he said something
[45:14] that was born in me
[45:16] that made him have that temper but boy
[45:18] my daddy was hot-headed and my mom was
[45:20] half-indian
[45:21] and they would fight like a bug saw
[45:24] those boys would jump me and he's
[45:25] talking about it
[45:27] climbing a ladder but he said now
[45:30] he said now
[45:31] you could drag me out there
[45:33] and wallop me to death
[45:37] he said
[45:39] i wouldn't do a thing
[45:41] he said that's not me
[45:44] doing that
[45:46] he said something happened he said it's
[45:48] an old power the old william branham
[45:51] died
[45:52] and someone else came in
[45:55] and he said now it makes me feel sorry
[45:57] for my enemies and when someone does
[46:00] something wrong against me he said i
[46:02] never pray against them i pray for them
[46:05] and that's where the holy spirit
[46:08] that's where the holy spirit will give
[46:10] you the test the other night
[46:12] he's talking about in england
[46:14] where those people were in the front of
[46:16] the seat
[46:18] and he said i forgive you
[46:20] he said
[46:27] that's the real test
[46:31] of what spirit
[46:34] is anointing you
[46:36] what
[46:37] do we have in our cup
[46:39] if we have good things in our cup
[46:42] when you get bumped into just good
[46:44] things
[46:45] we'll fall out
[46:47] and if you have bad things in your cup
[46:49] bad things and you can be assured
[46:53] that what's in your cup is going to
[46:56] spill
[46:58] god made it that way
[47:00] it will spill
[47:02] guaranteed this bill i want to show you
[47:04] i have another example of where the
[47:06] prophet did but i want to look at some
[47:08] examples in the bible and i know i want
[47:11] to cautious you on this you think well
[47:13] this is past tense and it's hard to read
[47:15] a book when you know how it ended
[47:18] it's hard to read and to finish a book
[47:20] and you know the ending and you think
[47:21] well you know this was this was
[47:25] you know this was
[47:27] this ain't parallel to today but you got
[47:30] to try to place yourself in their
[47:32] position second kings five
[47:34] the beginning of second kings five here
[47:36] we had the captain naham
[47:39] and he was the host of the king of syria
[47:41] and they had one down to israel and they
[47:44] had taken over in an army and taken
[47:47] prisoners captive
[47:51] now i can guarantee you
[47:54] and especially for a young teenage girl
[47:58] it was not a purdy site
[48:03] but wait say oh yeah but wait no the
[48:05] story was sofa
[48:07] but what was in that little girl's cup
[48:10] spilled out
[48:13] and if it had been you just put yourself
[48:15] in that position
[48:17] can you imagine your mom and dad being
[48:19] massacred by another army and them
[48:21] dragging you off to war you're
[48:22] completely their slave they can do
[48:24] whatever you they want to with you you
[48:26] have completely zero say
[48:33] i'm not sure that good things would come
[48:35] out of my cup
[48:42] amen
[48:43] because see we're still in bodies
[48:46] and see what's in her cup can change i'm
[48:48] going to show you somebody and david's
[48:50] got but changed
[48:51] can change daily
[48:54] man
[48:55] but what's in your cup and it affects
[48:57] your environment around you
[49:00] and it affects all the people that you
[49:02] love the most
[49:04] because they're the ones that are
[49:05] getting spilled on
[49:07] they're either getting burnt by good
[49:09] things
[49:12] blessed by good things they're burnt by
[49:13] bad things
[49:14] and here
[49:16] this little maid
[49:18] he says in in verse two he said they
[49:20] were brought away captive out of the
[49:22] land of israel a little maine now you
[49:24] know as soon as an israelite jew leaves
[49:26] their homeland they lose all their
[49:27] blessings
[49:28] now she's she's a prisoner of war a
[49:31] slave i can't trust that's enough
[49:33] can you imagine julie you're kid just a
[49:35] slave gone boom
[49:36] you'll never see him again
[49:39] and they find out that the the dirty
[49:41] rotten person that took him had a
[49:44] sickness
[49:49] and this is what spilled out of her cup
[49:51] in verse 3 she said i would to god my
[49:53] lord
[49:54] were with the prophet that was back in
[49:57] israel
[49:58] because he could recover
[50:01] of his leprosy
[50:06] i'm not so sure
[50:08] if i was in that situation
[50:10] i'd be worrying about
[50:12] my slave master
[50:16] leprosy
[50:18] amen
[50:19] you just picture that here's a little
[50:21] maid
[50:23] and slave leprosy here's joseph in
[50:25] genesis 45
[50:29] verse one it starts out in joseph when
[50:31] he comes and his brother and came to him
[50:34] now
[50:35] just remember this
[50:37] they had joseph was a perfect type of
[50:39] jesus they had beat joseph they left him
[50:42] for dead
[50:43] they had sold him into slavery
[50:46] i mean they actually planned on killing
[50:48] him it was only their greed for money
[50:50] that they never killed him
[50:52] wasn't a lot of love flowing
[50:56] between that family reunion
[51:02] and joseph the bible says in 45 and
[51:05] verse 1 it says he couldn't refrain
[51:07] before them and he cried so loud that
[51:10] all of egypt
[51:13] heard him
[51:16] wow
[51:19] verse two he wept aloud that the
[51:21] egyptians
[51:22] and the house of pharaoh heard him
[51:26] he actually cared
[51:29] for the people that planned on murdering
[51:32] them
[51:32] and then they seemed that they could get
[51:34] through the pieces of silver
[51:42] he had something in his cup
[51:44] it wasn't flesh
[51:47] it wasn't
[51:48] flesh here down in verse 4 he said i am
[51:51] joseph your brother whom you sowed into
[51:54] egypt verse 5 and now therefore be not
[51:57] grieved nor angry with yourselves
[52:00] that you sold me hither for god did sent
[52:02] me
[52:03] before you
[52:05] to preserve life
[52:09] you know
[52:11] what do we have in our cup
[52:15] what do people around us have in their
[52:17] cup
[52:20] you can see it
[52:23] when it's pushed
[52:28] amazing
[52:30] here's the prophet
[52:33] another story from the prophet
[52:35] and i won't read this so close but you
[52:36] know the story of the prophet when he
[52:38] was going to a nice restaurant during
[52:40] the week it was the mennonites in the
[52:42] restaurant
[52:44] and the prophet says they closed to go
[52:46] to sunday school on sunday
[52:48] and he needed something to eat and he
[52:49] went to the nasty restaurant across the
[52:52] road or the worldly restaurant across
[52:54] the road
[52:55] and he walked in the place
[52:57] and it was a bad scene
[53:00] now now in defense of our prophet you
[53:02] have to understand that he just came
[53:04] from the presence
[53:05] of jehovah
[53:08] and
[53:11] it was
[53:12] going from heavenly things to
[53:15] hell
[53:16] literally
[53:19] and it was
[53:21] really really really bad
[53:24] and
[53:26] the prophet
[53:31] said
[53:34] he said oh god
[53:36] why don't you just wipe this place
[53:39] right off the map he couldn't imagine
[53:41] his daughters
[53:43] growing up in a place like that now that
[53:45] you know there was a young girl there
[53:47] with a bunch of men
[53:48] messing around on a table and there was
[53:50] an older lady there in her 50s
[53:53] that was with the cop and it was just a
[53:56] bad bad bad
[53:59] very vulgar scene they were gambling he
[54:01] said it was illegal to gamble in ohio
[54:04] at that time
[54:07] and see what the prophet had in his cup
[54:10] it spilled out
[54:13] because when he walked in that
[54:14] restaurant
[54:16] he wanted to blow them up
[54:23] and then he said in paragraph 30 he said
[54:25] and they heard the angel of the lord say
[54:27] come aside and i walked over there and
[54:29] he said i got through
[54:30] and he got through with me
[54:32] and i felt like a different person
[54:36] it's what changed in his cup
[54:39] he said what are you condemning her for
[54:41] and he said i saw a vision of the world
[54:43] and he said another world and there was
[54:45] a rainbow around the world it was the
[54:47] blood of christ and it was protecting
[54:49] god's wrath and he couldn't look upon it
[54:53] and he would destroy the thing right
[54:55] then
[54:56] because he said the day that you eat
[54:58] thereof you shall die so god's wrath
[55:01] caused for judgment
[55:02] but it was the blood of christ that was
[55:05] keeping god's judgment from blowing us
[55:07] all off the face of the earth including
[55:09] this restaurant
[55:11] and he said i thought like this and i
[55:12] said i seen myself also though and i
[55:15] didn't do that
[55:16] but i'm a sinner i didn't do what
[55:18] they're doing in the restaurant but i'm
[55:19] a sinner and then the blood of jesus
[55:22] christ acts like a bumper
[55:24] and when my sin went up it hit him in
[55:26] the face
[55:27] and jarred his precious head
[55:30] and i could see the tears and the blood
[55:32] running down i said oh forgive them
[55:34] father
[55:36] christ said oh forgive him father for he
[55:38] didn't know what he was doing
[55:40] and i would do something else and it
[55:42] would hit him like that again this is
[55:44] the prophet
[55:45] from the sins and jesus would say to the
[55:47] father forgive him father
[55:49] the prophet don't know what he's doing
[55:52] billy don't know what he's meaning the
[55:54] prophet
[55:56] and he said i see my old book laying
[55:58] there a sinner and everything on it and
[56:01] i seen my sins that i was doing it and i
[56:04] said lord will you forgive me
[56:07] and he took my hand to one side and got
[56:09] some
[56:10] got got some blood out
[56:13] and rode across the top pardon
[56:17] and threw it back in the sea of
[56:18] forgiveness
[56:20] and to remember it no more and it was
[56:22] gone forever and he said i forgave you
[56:24] but you're for condemning
[56:27] them
[56:29] or her
[56:30] and it changed my whole idea and i said
[56:33] lord have mercy he went over to the lady
[56:34] and you know the story
[56:36] of the lady said that she had someone
[56:38] and
[56:39] she was thinking completely carnal and
[56:42] the prophet said no i don't mean in that
[56:44] way and she had been an old sunday
[56:46] schools teacher she had children at home
[56:49] and life had come in and backslitter
[56:52] drove her to the bar
[56:53] and he said you know what he said the
[56:55] woman wiped
[56:56] out slipped out of the seat the
[56:58] restaurant he said we had a prayer
[57:00] meeting there like you've heard never
[57:02] heard
[57:03] in your life
[57:05] because she come to christ and what was
[57:07] it
[57:07] don't condemn them
[57:10] don't tell them the gospel don't condemn
[57:12] them tell them the gospel he said
[57:14] they're demon possessed
[57:17] and they're immortals in this realm
[57:21] and they've been influenced over here
[57:23] but your influence comes above
[57:26] theirs
[57:28] he said let's see what we can do
[57:30] with our talents
[57:33] and win others
[57:35] to christ
[57:37] see how god
[57:38] had to come to our prophet
[57:41] and change his cup
[57:44] in a vision
[57:48] god help us
[57:49] it's not because somebody bumps into you
[57:52] the bad things come out of your cup
[57:55] it's because you already have the bad
[57:57] things in there
[57:59] and it's just manifesting what's coming
[58:01] out
[58:02] by your
[58:03] action to a reaction
[58:08] showing what you really are
[58:10] and not only are you showing other
[58:12] people around you but god's actually
[58:14] doing that to show ourselves
[58:17] a reaction
[58:19] to an action
[58:20] now i don't know if you're
[58:22] really getting this i want to i want to
[58:24] maybe give you another bible one then i
[58:26] want to talk about david here's an
[58:27] example
[58:28] where they came to get jesus out of the
[58:31] garden
[58:33] now jesus was god
[58:38] and he was flesh too
[58:40] he was 100 the fullness of the godhead
[58:43] bodily
[58:45] but he was 100 percent felt the
[58:47] affirmatives of us
[58:52] he felt what it was like when they put
[58:53] the thorns on his head
[58:55] he knew what pain was
[58:59] he felt what it was like to be rejected
[59:01] he felt what it was like to be spit on
[59:03] and gambled and smacked and said tell us
[59:06] who who hit you
[59:08] he knew what that felt like
[59:10] because he had to feel that
[59:12] to feel what we feel
[59:16] man
[59:17] and here he goes done nothing wrong an
[59:19] innocent man
[59:22] an innocent man
[59:24] and peter out of the love of the flesh
[59:28] pulled his sword to defend him
[59:30] and cut off one of the high priesters
[59:33] now they're there to take jesus
[59:36] to nail them to a cross
[59:38] and jesus knows it
[59:45] and in luke 22 and 51 jesus answered and
[59:48] said suffer these things of fire
[59:50] and he touched the high priest's ear
[59:53] and he healed his ear
[59:56] and they immediately led him away
[1:00:00] for judgment
[1:00:04] pretty obvious to see what was in his
[1:00:06] cup
[1:00:08] he knew that those same people were
[1:00:10] going to condemn him to death
[1:00:14] he didn't have to touch the year
[1:00:16] it wasn't him that did the year
[1:00:18] he hadn't given the order to do the year
[1:00:20] he was completely unhappy that it
[1:00:22] happened
[1:00:25] see how christianity
[1:00:27] is living for others
[1:00:30] and it shows it
[1:00:32] by what's in your cup
[1:00:38] god help us
[1:00:39] you know god help us in our daily lives
[1:00:41] let me let me give you a daily thing and
[1:00:44] we're going to look at david and david's
[1:00:45] cop changed
[1:00:47] there's three different scriptures on
[1:00:49] david's cup
[1:00:50] you know we were heading to church this
[1:00:51] morning and we're going to
[1:00:53] go
[1:00:54] celebrate our anniversary tomorrow and
[1:00:56] that
[1:00:57] and we were part way to church
[1:01:00] i had to pass sister patty on the way
[1:01:02] and then i felt real guilty we got
[1:01:03] stopped at a red light together
[1:01:05] and
[1:01:06] god was judging me for passage or
[1:01:08] something
[1:01:10] and i said honey did you bring the money
[1:01:13] and she said well
[1:01:14] no
[1:01:16] i said well
[1:01:18] what are we going to buy gas with
[1:01:20] well i have
[1:01:21] she told me
[1:01:23] and i said but
[1:01:27] you're going away for five days but
[1:01:32] you see
[1:01:36] now i knew what i was preaching this
[1:01:38] morning
[1:01:40] or i was oh
[1:01:44] what would have been in my cup
[1:01:47] what a show
[1:01:50] how could you go on a holiday without
[1:01:52] money
[1:01:56] i made that really personal
[1:01:58] that happened an hour ago
[1:02:00] but that probably happened to you an
[1:02:01] hour ago too
[1:02:03] you don't have to tell me
[1:02:05] but it showed the people closest to you
[1:02:08] what was in your cup
[1:02:14] huh
[1:02:15] every idle word
[1:02:18] you answer for
[1:02:21] meanness
[1:02:23] or patience
[1:02:25] meekness longsuffering
[1:02:27] see
[1:02:28] we just think we can just
[1:02:32] you can't just let her fly
[1:02:36] amen
[1:02:37] it shows what's in our cup
[1:02:40] i mean what
[1:02:41] we're
[1:02:42] we're saying one thing
[1:02:43] but when we get bumped
[1:02:46] our life spills
[1:02:48] and everybody gets burned
[1:02:51] amen
[1:02:52] here's an example in first samuel 24
[1:02:54] here's david and saul he's running for
[1:02:56] his life
[1:02:59] and god makes a way to see what's in
[1:03:02] david's cup
[1:03:03] and uh
[1:03:05] god
[1:03:06] brings saul to him and david's men
[1:03:09] come right up to david's men said unto
[1:03:11] him in in verse 4 samuel 24 and 4. he's
[1:03:14] the name of man said unto behold the day
[1:03:16] of the lord the day which the lord said
[1:03:19] unto thee behold i deliver thy enemies
[1:03:22] into thy hand thou mayest doeth with him
[1:03:25] and shall
[1:03:26] seem good unto thee and david arose and
[1:03:29] cut off a piece of saul's robe
[1:03:33] they wanted him to take his life
[1:03:36] when saul was back in the cave
[1:03:38] and this shows you what was in david's
[1:03:41] cup
[1:03:42] and it came to pass afterwards verse 5
[1:03:45] came to pass afterwards said david's
[1:03:47] heart smote him
[1:03:51] because he had killed saul
[1:03:58] that's what we would have done
[1:04:02] that's what i would have felt like doing
[1:04:05] i mean it's either me or you
[1:04:08] right
[1:04:10] i don't know how those
[1:04:12] people that are christians in the state
[1:04:13] they fed people tell me you know i got
[1:04:15] enough ammunition to hold off the town
[1:04:24] david came to pass afterwards david tart
[1:04:26] smote him
[1:04:28] because he had touched
[1:04:32] saw his garment
[1:04:34] that's all
[1:04:37] cut his garment
[1:04:40] i imagine if he had a
[1:04:49] it looked like god had done it for a
[1:04:51] purpose
[1:04:53] saul had three thousand men
[1:04:57] david had a few
[1:04:58] just close-knit friends they weren't
[1:05:00] even
[1:05:01] jews
[1:05:02] most of them for sure
[1:05:05] here's another example what with david
[1:05:06] in his cup in samuel first samuel
[1:05:10] 26 and verse 5 and david arose and came
[1:05:12] to the place where saul was pitched and
[1:05:14] david beheld the place where saul laid
[1:05:16] and the men with them the captain of the
[1:05:19] hosts or men that were with saw and they
[1:05:21] laid
[1:05:22] entrenched
[1:05:24] and the people were pitched around about
[1:05:26] him now saul was out if you read these
[1:05:28] scriptures in both cases he had 3 000 of
[1:05:30] his best military men with them 3 000 to
[1:05:33] get one man
[1:05:35] like
[1:05:36] they probably had enough
[1:05:41] and david asked this man he said who
[1:05:44] will go down with me into the camp of
[1:05:46] saul
[1:05:48] and one of his men said i'll go down
[1:05:49] with you and david said unto him to the
[1:05:52] people that by night behold saw laid
[1:05:54] sleeping in the trench
[1:05:56] and his spear was stuck in the ground at
[1:05:59] his
[1:06:01] poster
[1:06:07] and the people laid about them
[1:06:09] in verse 8
[1:06:11] and david's man said hath god not
[1:06:13] delivered
[1:06:14] thine enemy into thy hands this day now
[1:06:18] remember remember
[1:06:20] david's man was not out of the way
[1:06:25] david was anointed
[1:06:28] by god's prophet
[1:06:30] to be the king at that very time
[1:06:34] because the bible says previous that the
[1:06:37] spirit of god
[1:06:40] had left saul
[1:06:49] we could learn a lot by this
[1:06:52] date god's delivered that enemy into the
[1:06:54] hand to make them like the bible would
[1:06:56] say make them your footstool and now
[1:06:59] therefore let me slay him i pray thee
[1:07:01] with his spear that's in the earth once
[1:07:03] and i will only smote him
[1:07:07] one time
[1:07:09] i won't hit him twice
[1:07:11] it'll just take one spear
[1:07:14] through his heart
[1:07:16] we won't mangle him
[1:07:18] we won't torture him
[1:07:24] and david said unto his men
[1:07:27] destroy him not
[1:07:29] for whom can stretch forth his hand
[1:07:32] against god's anointed
[1:07:36] and be guiltless
[1:07:38] and actually
[1:07:41] it was a stretch to say he was god's
[1:07:43] anointed
[1:07:48] but here i want to show you in second
[1:07:49] samuel 12
[1:07:51] where david's cop changed
[1:07:55] now david had a really good stuff in his
[1:07:57] cup
[1:08:01] and that's where with us in our life
[1:08:04] we can have really good stuff in our cup
[1:08:08] but sometimes the satan will come in
[1:08:09] like a flood
[1:08:11] and the holy spirit's there oh yeah he's
[1:08:13] there if you accept him
[1:08:16] but sometimes like paul said he said i
[1:08:18] fall down daily
[1:08:20] sometimes something catches you just off
[1:08:24] and you say something that when you went
[1:08:26] to bed at night you wished you hadn't
[1:08:28] said
[1:08:30] amen
[1:08:32] second samuel 12 in the beginning of one
[1:08:34] and the lord sent nathan to david
[1:08:39] and he came on to him and said unto him
[1:08:40] therefore there was two men in one city
[1:08:42] one was rich and one was poor and the
[1:08:44] rich man had exceedingly many flocks
[1:08:46] and herds but the poor man had nothing
[1:08:49] save one yo lamb which he brought and
[1:08:52] nourished it up and grew it up together
[1:08:54] with him and his children and they did
[1:08:56] eat his own meat and drank his own cup
[1:09:00] and they laid in his bosom and was with
[1:09:03] him as a daughter the little lamb was as
[1:09:07] a daughter to the man and there came a
[1:09:08] traveler
[1:09:10] on to the rich man
[1:09:12] and he spared to take
[1:09:14] his own flock and
[1:09:16] his own herds and he dressed the fair
[1:09:19] and to dress for the wayfaring man
[1:09:23] that was come unto him but he took the
[1:09:24] poor man's lamb
[1:09:26] and he dressed that man's lamb
[1:09:29] that was come unto him and david's anger
[1:09:33] was immediately kindled
[1:09:35] against a man and he said unto the
[1:09:37] prophet he said as a lord god liveth
[1:09:39] that man that done this thing so surely
[1:09:45] die
[1:09:53] and he shall restore the lamb fourfold
[1:09:56] because he did this thing and because he
[1:09:58] hath no pity
[1:10:00] and nahim the prophet said unto david
[1:10:03] doubt
[1:10:06] art
[1:10:08] that man
[1:10:16] verse 9 he said therefore thou has
[1:10:18] despised the commandments of the lord to
[1:10:20] do evil in his sight and thou has killed
[1:10:23] uriah
[1:10:24] the hittite
[1:10:26] here a lot of david's inner circle men
[1:10:28] when saul was killed were not even jews
[1:10:31] but they seen the power of god in the
[1:10:33] anointing of god on david and they knew
[1:10:35] he would be kin here's a hittite giving
[1:10:37] his life for the jewish people
[1:10:40] a hittite with his sword and has taken
[1:10:42] his wife to be thy wife and has slain
[1:10:45] him with the sword of the children
[1:10:48] of
[1:10:48] ammon
[1:10:52] see david's cop
[1:10:55] changed
[1:10:58] and so can our cup
[1:11:00] change
[1:11:02] that's why we always need to be on guard
[1:11:05] amen
[1:11:06] who's in our cup here here's another
[1:11:08] example and just show you like the
[1:11:10] things and i want to i got a kind of a
[1:11:12] climax to finish here here's the story
[1:11:15] of paul and silas and you knew this
[1:11:16] story now paul
[1:11:18] was not uh the the same lineage as like
[1:11:21] he was not able to be beaten jewish
[1:11:24] background and that men like paul and
[1:11:27] silas prayed they'd been through into
[1:11:28] prisoner but it was actually illegal for
[1:11:30] paul to not have a trial
[1:11:32] and uh
[1:11:34] they sang songs and were praising god
[1:11:36] for
[1:11:37] for uh
[1:11:39] well they were just
[1:11:40] continuing on as if nothing had changed
[1:11:43] and suddenly there was a great
[1:11:44] earthquake and the prisons were shaken
[1:11:46] and immediately the doors of the prison
[1:11:48] opened and the their bands were loose
[1:11:52] now listen
[1:11:54] number one paul and silas hadn't done
[1:11:56] nothing wrong to be in prison
[1:11:58] number two the people that had threw him
[1:12:00] in there had actually broke their own
[1:12:02] laws because paul had the right to a
[1:12:04] trial and the pre-loop and all that he
[1:12:07] actually brought them because they
[1:12:08] actually feared when they realized who
[1:12:09] paul was
[1:12:12] man
[1:12:14] and they agreed to let paul go the fear
[1:12:16] and he paul made him come right to
[1:12:20] him i don't think we would have been
[1:12:23] worried about
[1:12:25] the person that was in charge of putting
[1:12:27] us in there
[1:12:30] you know like
[1:12:32] if something happened to somebody like
[1:12:34] big in our
[1:12:36] you know
[1:12:38] we'd say
[1:12:40] we're surprised it took that long
[1:12:45] you know
[1:12:49] and the keeper of the prison awake from
[1:12:50] his sleep and seeing the prison doors
[1:12:52] open he drew his own sword and would
[1:12:54] have killed himself and we would have
[1:12:55] said hooray can i help you
[1:13:02] but paul had something else in his cup
[1:13:07] this prisoner or the jailer had
[1:13:09] supposing the prisoner left him but paul
[1:13:11] cried with a loud voice
[1:13:14] wait
[1:13:17] we're all here
[1:13:21] what have i done that
[1:13:25] would have you done that
[1:13:28] you can answer that question by what's
[1:13:30] in your cup
[1:13:33] but because of what was in paul's cup he
[1:13:35] was able to lead the jailer
[1:13:37] and his whole family
[1:13:39] to eternal life
[1:13:44] wow wow
[1:13:47] god help us amen
[1:13:49] here's another example
[1:13:51] in exodus one here the king of egypt
[1:13:54] spake to the hebrew midwives
[1:13:56] and he told the midwives he said when
[1:13:58] the hebrew women come to have their
[1:13:59] children
[1:14:00] if it's a son kill them if it's a
[1:14:02] daughter let it live
[1:14:06] but the midwives
[1:14:09] they were pagan
[1:14:11] they had no lineage
[1:14:15] like they didn't go to church on sunday
[1:14:18] they didn't profess the message of the
[1:14:20] hour
[1:14:22] no
[1:14:23] no
[1:14:24] they were flat out working for the
[1:14:26] government
[1:14:31] but they feared god
[1:14:38] man they had something even in that
[1:14:40] state they had something else in their
[1:14:43] cup
[1:14:45] how much more should a holy ghost-filled
[1:14:47] child of god
[1:14:49] have something different in his cup
[1:14:52] and they lied to their own king and they
[1:14:54] said the hebrew women are super women
[1:14:58] and when they come to that state they
[1:15:00] are so powerful they've already birthed
[1:15:03] before we arrived
[1:15:11] but believers
[1:15:14] what would have we had done
[1:15:19] that
[1:15:21] depends what's in your cup
[1:15:24] let me give you a little scenario this
[1:15:26] is
[1:15:27] and then i was going to read a scripture
[1:15:29] here at the end
[1:15:31] who killed
[1:15:32] abel
[1:15:36] his brother
[1:15:39] who sold joseph
[1:15:42] his brothers
[1:15:44] who expelled
[1:15:46] jehoshaphat
[1:15:48] ex expelled i think i'm saying that
[1:15:50] right
[1:15:52] his brothers
[1:15:54] who was jealous
[1:15:56] of david
[1:16:00] his brothers
[1:16:02] who was unhappy from the prodigal son
[1:16:07] returned
[1:16:12] his brother
[1:16:14] i want to finish reading this now among
[1:16:16] so many examples in the bible we
[1:16:18] perceive that all those who have been
[1:16:21] betrayed and mistreated by their own
[1:16:24] brethren have been mainly
[1:16:26] have been greatly blessed
[1:16:30] and kept
[1:16:32] by god
[1:16:37] wow
[1:16:39] they had something in their cup
[1:16:42] in life people may consider your family
[1:16:46] and may turn their backs on you
[1:16:50] they may their rejection may
[1:16:54] be a path to god's plan
[1:16:57] for your glory
[1:17:01] only never hold a grudge against them
[1:17:05] pray instead for them
[1:17:07] and wish them well
[1:17:09] and blessings
[1:17:12] even if your own family
[1:17:14] don't believe
[1:17:16] in you
[1:17:18] almighty god himself has chosen you
[1:17:22] and will give you
[1:17:24] what you need
[1:17:26] to fulfill
[1:17:28] his plan
[1:17:30] may god lead you where you will and
[1:17:32] consider
[1:17:35] and be honored
[1:17:36] to be a part
[1:17:38] of god's family
[1:17:41] wow
[1:17:43] let's go to second peter one
[1:17:45] we can close with this
[1:17:48] what's
[1:17:49] in your cup
[1:17:50] well it seemed fairly obvious somebody
[1:17:52] carelessly bumped into me
[1:17:55] but if you wouldn't have had nothing in
[1:17:57] it
[1:17:58] or only blessings in it
[1:18:02] those other things would not have
[1:18:03] spilled out
[1:18:06] it wasn't the person's fault that
[1:18:08] carelessly bumped into you
[1:18:10] it was god revealing to the world
[1:18:14] and mainfully yourself
[1:18:18] what was in your cup
[1:18:20] now you think of all the people in your
[1:18:22] own life we we should judge ourselves
[1:18:24] first but then people that have been
[1:18:27] in your life
[1:18:29] cycle
[1:18:31] and see what's
[1:18:33] you can see
[1:18:36] by what spills
[1:18:38] in the cup
[1:18:40] see the footsteps of a righteous man are
[1:18:43] ordered
[1:18:44] of the lord but a righteous man still
[1:18:47] spills his cup
[1:18:51] because god it has to be that way
[1:18:54] because that's how god's
[1:18:56] salvation happens
[1:18:58] how's the gospel spill
[1:19:01] it's because it's good things in the cup
[1:19:03] how's the world know that he's a savior
[1:19:06] by what spills out of your cup how's the
[1:19:08] world know kindness by what spills out
[1:19:10] of your cup how's the world ever see
[1:19:12] patience or honor or reverence because
[1:19:15] what spills out of your cup
[1:19:19] so it's just it's like the bible in
[1:19:21] genesis where where it's a law that the
[1:19:23] seed will bring forth of its own kind
[1:19:26] we talked about that a couple weeks ago
[1:19:29] and jesus was our wave sheaf offering
[1:19:31] and brought a family after him
[1:19:34] but so here here was a seed of the kind
[1:19:36] of jesus and he was our example he was
[1:19:38] our lord he was our savior
[1:19:41] but so will this be with our cup
[1:19:45] the same law applies a seed will bring
[1:19:48] forth
[1:19:50] of its kind
[1:19:52] and so if you got the wrong kind
[1:19:56] of seed in your cup
[1:19:58] it'll spill
[1:20:00] because
[1:20:01] it is going to spill
[1:20:04] you don't have to worry about it
[1:20:06] spilling that's called life
[1:20:08] life the destination of life
[1:20:11] is spilling your cup
[1:20:14] and that was god's whole plan
[1:20:17] to redeem a lost world
[1:20:21] let your light so shine before men that
[1:20:23] they shall see your good works
[1:20:26] and glorify your father
[1:20:29] these are worldly people
[1:20:31] which is in heaven
[1:20:33] this ain't a mistake
[1:20:35] god knew exactly what he was doing
[1:20:37] god planned
[1:20:39] on you hitting a road bump and spilling
[1:20:41] your coffee
[1:20:44] so the world would see and glorify him
[1:20:47] he planned on people
[1:20:50] listen to this church he planned on
[1:20:52] people mistreating you
[1:20:54] robbing and
[1:20:55] saying lies about you
[1:20:59] he planned on that
[1:21:01] so your cup would spill kindness and the
[1:21:03] world would see and glorify him
[1:21:08] that's powerful
[1:21:10] so what's in your cup
[1:21:13] if it's positivist is all for the glory
[1:21:15] of god
[1:21:18] or the glory of satan
[1:21:20] depending on what seed brings forth of
[1:21:23] its kind
[1:21:25] god help me
[1:21:27] god help me ii peter 1
[1:21:31] and
[1:21:31] starting at verse 5 and besides this
[1:21:34] giving all diligence to your face virtue
[1:21:36] and virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[1:21:38] temperance and to temperance patience
[1:21:40] and to patience godliness and to
[1:21:42] godliness brotherly kindness into
[1:21:45] brotherly kindness charity
[1:21:47] which if these things be in you and
[1:21:49] abound they make you that ye shall
[1:21:51] neither be barren
[1:21:54] or unfruitful
[1:21:56] see god gets the glory
[1:21:58] maybe not even directly from you but by
[1:22:00] the people that seen you they give glory
[1:22:02] to god
[1:22:03] wow there goes a gentleman
[1:22:05] wow there goes a real lady
[1:22:08] wow they were
[1:22:10] and they give and when they go wild
[1:22:12] they're giving god glory
[1:22:15] or they go ouch
[1:22:19] that you be not barren or unfruitful
[1:22:22] in the knowledge of our lord jesus
[1:22:24] christ but he that lacketh these things
[1:22:26] is blind
[1:22:29] and cannot see
[1:22:31] afar off
[1:22:32] and has forgotten that he was purged
[1:22:38] from his old sense
[1:22:41] wow
[1:22:45] god help us
[1:22:46] i want to close with just a little story
[1:22:49] maybe this will be for the kids
[1:22:53] you know it's all in how you see
[1:22:56] your
[1:22:57] actions
[1:22:58] your or your your that what happens to
[1:23:01] you it's all in how you react to what
[1:23:03] happened
[1:23:05] reaction to
[1:23:07] an action
[1:23:09] is life
[1:23:12] there was a story told about two boys
[1:23:14] and it was
[1:23:15] they went out to the barn
[1:23:17] and they had been praying for a pony
[1:23:21] and the one boy the boys had different
[1:23:23] things in their cup
[1:23:25] and they went out to the barn but they
[1:23:26] didn't see a pony they thought their dad
[1:23:28] had pulled the fast one on them and not
[1:23:30] got him a pony
[1:23:32] and the one boy seen some waste and he
[1:23:34] said oh
[1:23:35] boys
[1:23:36] we got garbage to clean out of the barn
[1:23:39] and the other boy started jumping up and
[1:23:41] down he said oh boy
[1:23:42] where there's garbage there's horses
[1:23:49] where there's manure
[1:23:51] there's horses
[1:23:53] that's that
[1:23:57] god help us
[1:24:00] what's in our cup
[1:24:02] it happens every day to us we get the
[1:24:04] opportunity to show
[1:24:06] and and i know because i'm human i know
[1:24:09] what happens in every one of your days
[1:24:11] just any little thing it might be it
[1:24:13] might be a little spill it's like oh i
[1:24:15] almost lost it
[1:24:16] some days it's a whole baked splash
[1:24:19] but how you go back through the
[1:24:21] drive-through and say oh this coffee
[1:24:23] burnt me yesterday fried me and
[1:24:26] i want a triple cup
[1:24:30] and you drive away
[1:24:32] do they glorify your god which was in
[1:24:34] heaven
[1:24:41] wow
[1:24:43] was all god's plan
[1:24:46] to save a world
[1:24:48] and he would get the glory
[1:24:50] by what spills out of our cup if nothing
[1:24:53] ever spilled out of our cup the world
[1:24:54] would be lost
[1:24:56] if these good things hadn't spilled out
[1:24:58] of jesus christ
[1:25:00] we all would have been lost
[1:25:02] but she was our great sacrifice
[1:25:04] hallelujah that's just amazing thank you
[1:25:07] lord
[1:25:09] thank you lord jesus give me something
[1:25:11] honey

[1:25:52] [Music]
[1:27:50] when i left
[1:28:12] they've been watching for years
[1:28:16] i told them how we enjoyed
[1:28:18] being next to the church
[1:28:20] and he said something
[1:28:25] that made me
[1:28:26] think he said it's amazing
[1:28:29] our life circle
[1:28:31] keeps bringing us around
[1:28:34] 20 years ago
[1:28:36] back around 20 years later
[1:28:53] watch
[1:29:08] christ could care less if they ever
[1:29:11] remember who or what
[1:29:14] about
[1:29:15] me for us
[1:29:16] but just christ
[1:29:18] we could just see christ
[1:29:22] let's sing this one more times
[1:29:24] [Music]
[1:29:37] lord i need you
[1:29:42] more than ever

[1:30:12] lord jesus i desire to have only
[1:30:15] you and my cup i desire to have the
[1:30:18] attributes of you everything that would
[1:30:21] come out of your beautiful
[1:30:23] holy spirit
[1:30:25] in my cup lord jesus
[1:30:27] the lord as we go through our life and
[1:30:30] we get bumped and our cup spills out
[1:30:32] that it would splash jesus
[1:30:35] it would splash kindness and patience
[1:30:37] and love and
[1:30:39] all these beautiful things salvation and
[1:30:42] long-suffering and
[1:30:44] mercy and grace

[1:30:50] without your
[1:30:53] salvation lord jesus help us to let our
[1:30:56] light shine
[1:30:59] that
[1:30:59] the world will see but for sure our
[1:31:02] closest friends and family
[1:31:04] will see that there's something in our
[1:31:06] cup
[1:31:08] and when it spilled it didn't burn us
[1:31:11] it spilled all over us
[1:31:13] but it didn't burn us
[1:31:16] it was really peculiar
[1:31:19] it was almost a paradox
[1:31:22] i got soaking wet but it was supposed to
[1:31:24] be hot
[1:31:26] but it didn't burn
[1:31:29] because it was you christ

[1:31:34] blessed be your beautiful name for all
[1:31:37] of eternity
[1:31:39] bless your beautiful bride here today
