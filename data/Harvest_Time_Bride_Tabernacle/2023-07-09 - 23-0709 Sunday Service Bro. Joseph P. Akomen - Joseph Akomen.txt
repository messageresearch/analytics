foreign [Music] God bless yourself [Music] I'm glad to be here may we have you have a seat please I'm thrilled to be around the Bride of Jesus Christ one of the great things in the message is that wherever you go the Bride of Jesus Christ is the same thing everywhere in Africa in Europe in Canada in United States in Asia we use when we come together we know that we are in the presence of our father I want to thank brother Dale and his wife yesterday when we came and they really gave us a good hospitality and we we feel at home I I feel at home I just want to thank our sister and brother and also I came with my family my wife and my my four children and my granddaughter and my my brother in the scene who came from he came from Nigeria to visit and when I told you that I I was coming here and he said he he would like to come with us and we we thank God for bringing us here yeah just for identification's sake I just want my family to stand so that they can yeah thank you and that's my brother from Nigeria I saw an old is an old veterans well before I when I came here it says yesterday I've been asking God what direction he want me to to speak on because there's no human being have ability to give any human being something there is no way I can know what you're going through even if I know what you're going through I can help you therefore the only way is God coming down and design what is in your heart and what you'll need are and because whatever God does he does it by the means of his word if you are sick God will heal you by means of his word but the Bible said I signed his word and the world heal it therefore when you whatever you need to not eat this money just rest assured that God will meet that need well before I go on to speak I think my brother and my daughter I have a song to sing and I want to give them the opportunity for them to come and minister in songs hmm God bless you Saints it's really a privilege to thank you and thank brother deal and this is a Lua you're going to be in the keyboard it's a simple song you can play yes so as long as [Music] an alert to the bright you know the scripture says that the that the bread groom is coming and the bread has made herself ready so it's it's our place to make ourselves ready for us coming to when I we'll take a all right okay so it's a tattoo oh get ready to us our day in the early spring time by an ancient West Side well to rest his camel train [Music] oh he had found the bright for Isaac and the evening Shadows fell where his weary Johnny had not been in vain oh so he took the Pharaoh Baker decked in Jewels rich and rare back to Abraham and Sarah far away oh query Becker loved her Isaac and he loved Rebecca Cafe oh it more Sabina happy wedding day [Music] oh oh get ready the evening Shadows flow don't you hear the earliest cold for there is going to be a wedding supper a Joyce will soon begin in the evening when the caramel jam comes in hold the blaze that Holy Spirit to the prophet of this day has come down to it to claim abrahide for Isaac of a Yonder has prepared his tent of love and he wants his fair Rebecca by his side oh we've left our King folks gladly we bet the world goodbye we are going to land Beyond the Sea and we shall soon Behold our Isaac in the Blessed eternity what a happy happy meeting that will be hallelujah oh get ready the evening [Music] [Music] oh you better get ready now oh get ready the evening Shadows [Music] is going to be a weddings [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] God bless you that was a wonderful song and uh also before I go on I want to bring greetings from my pastor Pastor Samuel Gerard from the Scarborough spoken World Church I I am not a pastor I am I'm just just a brother and I love the Lord I I'm I'm a kind of my my gift is just to share the world and Mission missionary by calling I I love to win souls and uh the you see when God has varieties that's why we have five food Minister we have pastors we have uh for me uh God is not coming to be a pastor uh the weight that the pastor carrier I don't think I'm designed to carry such a weight therefore God give me another way to be able to minister to the Bride of Jesus Christ I just went to Africa about a few few months ago I was in Africa for six weeks from Mauritius I was in Mauritius from Mauritius I went to Madagascar from Madagascar I went to Ghana and spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ and we thank God we see we say when you go out on the feed you see the part of God in in display because God said this sign shall follow them that believe therefore when you go on the prophet said when God sent you he doesn't send you go goes with you therefore whenever we go on the mission feed uh we are not afraid what we are going to meet because it is it is not us it's Jesus Christ looking for his bride wherever they are and this after this morning I know that uh we are living in a very terrible time people don't know what to do many uh in drugs because they think drugs can help them many uh become alcoholic because they think that's only way to to Fat off the the problem they are going through but this there's a little bride on Earth today Now find a place of Refuge and which is the blood the blood of Jesus Christ and that is why I love that song that they just sung about Grace is it for us to receive this message it has to be pure grace it has it has nothing to do with the ability he has nothing to do with the family you came from whether you are rich or poor no it has to be God coming down to meet you where you are uh uh that is why I'm happy every time I stand in the front of the Bride of Jesus Christ I don't take that lightly because the Bride of Jesus Christ this is the wife of Jesus Christ therefore we have to be very careful how we we talk to them we don't want to beat the Bride of Jesus Christ down I am here and not to beat and the bride I'm here to lift the bread of Jesus Christ up and that is I believe that's what God has called me giving us the fight for the ministry of reconciliation to know that whatever you are going through here is temporary basis you are here for a purpose the reason why God came into this this town every look at Connor Jesus Christ have his pride and I'm thankful that I am identifying with the bride of Jesus Christ here therefore before we go on so let's turn today uh The Book of John chapter 1. John chapter 1 we will start reading from 1 to 14 but before that let's uh talk to the author of the book our heavenly father we we come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord to give you

Life come and speak to us or energize us oh God give us something oh God that will lift us up oh God we thank you your praise in Jesus precious name amen amen as we read from Genesis John chapter one starting from verse one he said in the beginning was the one and the world was with God and the world was God the same in the beginning was God all things were made by him and without him was not was anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shattered in the darkness and the Darkness comprehended not there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men threw him my belief he was not that light but he was sent to Bear the witness of that light that that was a True Light which lighted every man that commented into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and and the one knew him not and he came to his own and his old receiving not but as many as receive him to them he gave him power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood or not the will of Flesh none of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwell among us and we behead his glory the glory as of only begotten of the father full of grace and truth may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may have your seat the when I was coming here I was just deliberating asking God praying said Lord what will you have me to say to because we are living in a time where a lot of people from different churches around the world they don't know who God is and it is only the pride of Jesus Christ who can serve a fatically that they know who God is there are people that told us when we were in the denomination they told us that God is three some said God is too some people don't even know they have that this kind of imaginary God in their head they don't know that God is a man God is a big they are confused but there is a bride on the Earth today they are not confused of who God is they are not confused of their identity because this bride know where they came from we are not here we are not Earthly Bank creatures we are in town Eternal being and we are here for a specific purpose therefore our coming to our gathering here this morning is not for for me to for you to see this the the clothes that I wear on the clothes that you put on that is not the reason why we are here we are here because God brought us here we are here for a specific purpose I as I was thinking about that I felt because there's a line of thought that have been going on that God has been allowed me to to preach on in our church and I felt uh I was because I I felt in my spirit that I should continue that because the Bride of Jesus Christ is one and when the Holy Spirit is preaching in Africa you can see the same holy spirit is preaching the same thing here and that is what God is doing because God is not just localizing one place God is God of all the whole world therefore my what I wanted to talk about is God becoming tangible in you God who created heaven and earth becoming tangible in me in you therefore make that that title give us a clue that you are not just a flesh being therefore you are not just 60 elements you are more than that therefore there's something God put in you that money can't buy there's something God put in you that the prophet saw Adam's what is you is able to speak word and you go and live in it therefore there's something that is controlling that therefore when we go through our our trial day by day we have the tendency because we are living in this flesh we have the tendency to believe that oh we are such a a miserable sinner we are here just to make money go have a good life and die and that's it no that our purpose why we are here is more than that therefore this God who created heaven and earth right from the beginning has a plan and that plan was he wanted to come into this Earth and share his eternal life with you and with me therefore in doing that you see God everything that you see today that is happening bad or good is revealing God your mistake and your failure your trials everything that you go through every day if you if you can just sit quietly you will find out that one there is a purpose behind it and that purpose is God trying to reveal himself and most of the time we allow our Triad we get overwhelmed because of certain things and if you just keep seeing if you just wait if you just give God time if you just be patient with God you will find out that for a child of God there is nothing that is advocated for a child of God there is nothing that he told there is nothing that is out of place you might be thinking oh why you go through this why you go through that yes the reason why you go through that is there's a plan and purpose behind it which you have not fully understand that that if you give time God will be able to show it to you he said this is the reason why this was this and when you and as this time goes on you when God begin to unveil to you you love God the more you you you said God I thank you but we are the time you were going through it it was not easy but when you come out of it you can look back and begin to trace where you came from and you begin to stress what you have been through the ups and down the difficult times you have been through you see that God everything time you go through trying some problems God was always there in the beginning in the unveiling of God the prophet told her and said paragraph 84 he said God the almighty God The God Who created heaven and earth he said he was Elohim the internal he said but in him was thoughts that anytime read that because I know what thought is well sometimes when I sit down by myself I start thinking let's say for example I'm here I said I want to travel to to uh to Toronto before I set up the journey I have to think about it therefore might the way I think and God's thought is quite different therefore when God thought of anything the minute God thinks about it what God think is real and it's internal nothing can change it therefore God has thought is that but in him what thoughts he wanted to become material therefore God wanted to be material God wanted to to be touched God wanted to be fed God wants to come and walk on the street unless somebody touch him that is what God wanted he said but what did he do after he thought of done being material what did he do next God the prophet said God then he spoke the word materialize therefore if if what God spoke naturalized whether the people whether they thought that man to realize yeah it was you are the one that God thought of and when God spoke it it might have taken billions of years God was in transit in many different ways and you were with in transit when God led the internal spirit when God who was internal Spirit he thought he conceived God was the first thing the first well now we call it the the first idea about conceiving I conceive God conceived a thought and maybe that thought God conceived might have been billions of years billions of years to become material and he holds that he carried out from billions and billions of years that he want to become material he wants to be in flesh he wants to be a carpenter he wants to be a pastor he wants to be an evangelist he want to be a housewife he want to be a piano that was conceived in the mind of God for billions of years but that thought could not materialize in that internal space therefore God now had to take another first step God had to create time to move others thoughts that was him into time and when he come out the prophet said that eternity was like it's like a circle therefore he create a hickey than to bring all the thoughts out into the internal eternity into another stage of his condescension now listen to what the prophet said is that he spoke the word and the one naturalized that is the whole picture from Genesis to Revolution listen the Bible we are holding that this that is the life the revelation of Jesus Christ from Genesis to revelation therefore the prophet is telling us that when he spoke the word the one naturalized that is the whole picture from Genesis to Revelation therefore when God moved out from eternity into the logos where he begins to speak so let there be this let there be that let there be this me and you we are in him therefore when God spoke when God spoke you spoke with him when God said let them be at you were in him who spoke that therefore when God said let there be light let there be this we were in him because Christ is male and female Devon what am I doing this morning I'm trying to let you know that we are not just early born creature we came from God we are going back to God and we and the transition we me and you is what God is depending on to finish the program of redemption therefore don't let the devil put you in a corner to tell you you are not important I'm here to tell you you are important in the plan of God [Applause] he said this is that's the whole picture from Genesis to revelation it's not the wrong it's Elohim naturalizing so he can be touched and feel that is what God wanted therefore anytime you read any time somebody received the Holy Ghost what happened every brothers and sisters who have the Holy Ghost here is the Mighty God coming to dwell in Tabernacle of Flesh therefore the prophet told us that deity is not in heaven there it is is here in this church right now therefore God come to worship God came down God Drive God is standing up pooping God he said amen to his word that is what God's plan was at the beginning is God becoming materialized is God is becoming he wants to be fed he wants to be touched he want to do what everybody see everybody doing today God wanted the highway and drive God wants to cook in the kitchen God wants to God wants to live his life through you through me that is what he thought he said and in the millennium there is Elohim sitting on the throne that's right with all his subjects around him or his children in the Millennium God will be sitting with all his subjects because that is what he wanted although when he speak that God allow you see God is God of variety God is God who want to bring his plan and purpose and in this picture I call it the movie of redemption is it God who plan out everything before God start this movie he already finished it before he started therefore when God started this in his mind everything that he wanted to accomplish on Earth God finish it now he saw that and let the movie begin to play and why he was that movie was essential God is sitting there and saying you know I thought of my brother coming from Nigeria to be here to sit on the front row that was in the movie when you are sitting down today it was in the movie where God said you will be in the church today and that is what God saw and anything come to a child of God saying listen he said oh of his subject with around him that he that he predestinated before the foundation of the world now in a message what we shall see Jesus paragraph 60 69 the prophet said now what is a word a word is taught expressed you take it before you express it therefore God talked about you God thought about you to the vision in this time God thought about you that and at the time when the whole world is come in complete darkness when the whole world don't know what to do when the church are so confused and the devil are taking the church like a plate like a toy is that there will be a people on the Earth that they will be able to receive the work when the world comes to them and that is why you are here because God thought about you and when you talked about you I've been a son he spoke it and when they spoke it it might have taken billions of years but because when God speak God can take it back God can't change it your sin can change the plan the thought of God that God is concerning you it doesn't matter whatever your your situation he is here does not change what God talked about you if God talked about you as a bride there is no power there is no demon there is no condition that can change that because when God speaks that is forever settled therefore you are an Express thought of God May manifest in this day you know I like to play soccer when you are playing a league or you are playing for a World Cup you don't choose mediocre to play that you you sell it The Best of the Best it's only in part of Africa that the light they allow polities to get into their way they they choose bad and good they mix it up but if you are you irresistible a coach what do we do is to look for the best of the best not to let the best you look for the best Striker and the best record is not somebody who takes soccer and he wants to show up no it's somebody to take a sucker and his mindset is to is to score therefore they don't they put somebody who is really really want to score they put them on the center field not anything about God get to him he doesn't play it doesn't play around it's to zero inner measure is called that is what God did in this age God when God look Beyond this in the scream on time in this last age there will be gross Darkness therefore God did not choose job God did not choose Abraham to be here God did not choose Moses the great Moses because Moses could not cannot stand here therefore God has to look Beyond saying you know what I have to call myself therefore God look his son in this gross Darkness there is no human being can survive this there is no human being that can live in the edge of Southern mind in this age there is no human being where School are corrupt the devil take up the school the devil take up the church the devil take over the politics the devil take over every horse therefore human being cannot devil said God looked down said I will come down myself not only coming down he said the people I am going to need in this age is the people who are the worst of the worst people who they don't even know their life from the left that is why Grace is very important God looked down and saying you know what I am going to choose those who are drug addict I'm going to call those who are who can help themselves who have been written up by Society I'm going to choose people who cannot defend themselves they know they are failures and God said I will come down and when I come I will take over them to be able to survive in this age I don't that's what God was thinking God taught that the people that I'm going to bring here and people who when the word of God comes to them they will be able to tell the word of God and send I I take the word of God I believe it I stand by it I can't move away from it because it is not you for you to believe God it has to be God that believes God for you to believe God in this age for you to believe the prophet if God has to put something inside of you you have to have an a receiver that when the word of God comes to you there's something in you that magnetize the word of God that is that was the plan of God that is the movie God was acting out and God's saying okay I finished that I see the people but how am I of this thing to happen there are attributes and a lot in me I want to be a savior I want to be a Healer I want to be all this attribute how am I going to do it oh thought of Lucifer he said I would need Lucifer to be in this picture I will need the Lucifer to be in this drama because he has a part to play listen my brothers and sister you might have Santa on your life you ask yourself a question why it is going wrong in my life why did I go through all this God has a purpose therefore when God look at Lucifer he said yes I'm going to choose Lucifer but in that Lucifer he was created perfect but there was something that God put him called the free moral agency ability to choose right or wrong and God knew that Lucifer would choose the wrong thing and when it and God said praise God that's what I wanted and gone along Lucifer to come into the future and when he came into the picture Lucifer was the prophet said he come to the stage now after God moved from the eternal spirit into the logos from that point in time move it downward they were co-equal he was co-equal with Christ he was co-equal the only thing that he could not do is to give life therefore God give him access God give me the ability to do anything but he can't give life therefore when the Lucifer come to that stage of being called equal with God Pride certain that's what God saw God knew that God knew that Lucifer would do that and when he when Pride came in oh he became very important in the Church of God he become the choir Master he becomes the person who is he the position of authority now he begin to have influence when he talks some angelic they listen to him what the prophet said when he sees himself in that position the only thing he does he begins to go from one once Angel to another they're going to convince them probably they he had that God said let us make man in our own image and when he heard that say listen my friends my core angels I just heard the news that there's some God is one to create somebody in his own image therefore when that man come into preacher we will be relegated to nothing then he began to move from one one Angel to another to convince them said this God who who did he think he is let us read back let us I want to take the position and he convinced some of the Angels and some of them fall for his day if they fight for all the nonsense he was he was bringing out and the prophet said you see whatever you you went up there that is why you are manifesting here therefore if you were one of those to turn up the angel represented it doesn't matter no matter how much the pastor preach no matter the the super Supernatural experiencing you my hand no matter if the if the Fire come on the pulpit you will only be unbelievable you will never believe God because what you wear in the beginning that's what you are manifesting but let's bring it to another if you were a believer when the Devil Comes Lucifer come to you and start telling you I said no no no Satan no no I don't listen to that that garbage no no no God Is God When you you resist Satan's lie there I'm telling you when you come here in the manifestation of the of your or of your eye God the attribute God put in you let me tell you when the word of God comes to you you will believe the word of God you don't need to convince the pastor your pastor don't need to convince you you don't need to go to your brother and your sister because your the word of God he may manifest to you and you see it does it when whether somebody tell you the prophet made a mistake you know that's there are a lot of people today who goes out looking for the message to show us that the prophet made a mistake listen have you not the Bible where God told Abram my children with Sir John in the 49 for 400 years then you want to take that out from the Bible no the prophet whatever God allowed the prophets to speak the prophet said God does this away something sometimes to to put some people out and he speaking such a way to bring people in if you speak to life some people Ponder and that is the way God does this ever though when the word of God comes whether Abraham he made a mistake here he made a mistake there God did not give me the ministry to start dissecting whether we are the prophet made a mistake you know that's a minister he was a good friend of mine we separated because of this anytime go to his house he want to show me where blah blah made a mistake one day I wanted I wanted to be gentle I wanted to be a gentleman I just well I said maybe he would grow out of it but the more I go the man is trying to show me you know the prophet said uh Fellowship is two fellow in one ship therefore I I think we were in a different different shape then I designed one day I told him I said brother I have a question for you I said have you ever had a dream and that dream comes to pass 100 percent well I don't really think it was struggling I said okay I said the reason why I asked you a question do you know what a prophet is that a prophet can stand on the pulpit in the Garden of Eden and that's how he preached the serpent seed a prophet is a prophet it's a man who stand on the on the pulpit and sees your house address that you just moved three two days ago and somebody else will tell oh it's a false prophet a prophet is somebody who will be standing on the pulpit and sick doctor with operating knife on you that what a prophet is therefore if you if you've never seen a dream and your dream has never come to pass who are you to correct the prophet who are you to come up and say you know what you want to cover the prophet therefore you don't know what a prophet is a prophet is God in human flesh God in human flesh whether you understand it or not don't touch it leave it you know I receive the message Amen brother I receive this message in Europe and the father we can receive the message I will read it the same with your changes I was rejoicing both night and day one day as our reading I hit when the prophet said that the world is going to end in 1977. you know when I come there I did not stagger because everything that I've been reading I did not hit anybody and this I said this is not a bone maybe I did not understand it you know what I did I put it on the Shelf I said I'm going to live that but that will not make me to stop I want to let the enemy take my mind say oh oh this is a proper I said no no no no no every time I read is only in the rock every time I read I see myself anytime I read I said this man is like he was there when God was doing everything it is now we begin to understand that a prophet can stand here and not even that this prophet there is no Prophet like him this Prophet did not go to Genesis 1. he went straight to the back of God's mind and bring out what God was thinking then you want to come to me you want to come to me and tell me William made a mistake it's too late for you it's too late to tell me there is an error in this message yeah if there's an error God left it for the unbeliever not for the believer therefore when you come to that stage you see something and the devil tried to magnify it probably you are a part of those two third angels who listen to Satan's life but if you did not listen to Satan's life you represent that one third who came who said no we don't listen to you no no no no Our Father tell us we we stay with what her father said and you went there is that in adoption message a word a word is a taught Express God taught how he could be God you see let's look now this is a prophet who went straight to God's what God was thinking Nana he's bring it now that is why if you believe in Prophet you are blessed because God sent us a prophet and Lord Prophet to take you to the mind of God now we are taking a trip now part Genesis 1 we are going straight to the mind of God where what God was thinking where God was being conceiving his thoughts and now he said he said God taught how he could be God how he could be worshiped how he could be a Healer how he could be a savior and as as he speak the one it was finished forever therefore if God taught a Brother Joseph being a believer in his mind in eternity he said Joseph will be a believer and he spoke it and from the logos all the way all the way we thrown my children we were Israel all of a sudden Christ now become materialized that Lord God was in flesh and he was as he was in flesh and Joseph was in there and said oh we want to crucify him and the devil all of them were running around and they know him and Calvary and the piercing and when they piercing the water and blood came out and the devil said I got him but the devil didn't know that they were making a great mistake and when he did that the Bride of Jesus Christ came out Hallelujah [Applause] and we came out now for two thousand years God has been building up right and here is Brother Joseph born in the jungle of Africa I did not receive the message there for some reason I told my dad I'm going to travel to Europe but I didn't know that my decision that decision you might be thinking brother there are decisions you made that you may not understand but that decision you are making is the God moving you to a good direction [Music] I moved to Europe went through trials and difficulties and one day oh I was preaching the church one brother came and sit in the front row foreign see how God this brother was in Europe in Germany he flew to Greece and when he Fleet of Greece he was going from churches to churches and he happened to come to my church and he sat down on the front door like just that this brother sit down there and he listened to me we finished preaching because I was born and raised up Pentecostal and I was there and jumped upon them thinking I know about God this God and this brother allowed me to finish God bless you brother that was a good message that was a good message brother he said please can I follow you home I have something to share with you you see how God lead God saw me before the foundation of the war that I was going to receive the message he sent somebody because some I am a kind of person that is difficult for me to trust my fellow human being but this brother came as I just said okay let's go and put them inside the car and drop him home and we sit down my wife gave him food and everything I said brother I have some question to ask so when you were preaching it was nice but I have the question for me I would have said who are you to ask me I'm a pastor you just don't have any rights to ask me a question I said one question said brother in Genesis chapter 3 verse 15. what happened there wow I look at I said Genesis 3 15. and few weeks prior to that that is the subject caution in the bible school where I was going and how they Round Table nobody could answer that they told me that it was not revealed nobody should be quiet where God is quiet and this brother now came he came to me said brother Genesis 3 15. can you can you elaborate on me I said well like nothing I can say anything I don't know anything but I said the Bible they said we should keep it it's not ready the brother take out they said okay he said is God three or one well I try to defend what I believe by telling yes I'm trying to give a number on G if all kind of supreme ideas the guy the brother was just quiet he took me to a series of scriptures and nothing after that I said brother that is wonderful the brother did not come to me as if he know that he highly evaluated no he came to me simple because that is the only way I could have seen it because God designed me he's not the kind of person I am you can come to me with Flappy no this brown was so humble now he said he told me said Brian wait can I take five minutes to explain something to you I said brother take 10 minutes brother when this brother started from Genesis 3 15 at the time he end up in Book of Revelation something struck my soul I told you I said wait I said brother which Bible school did you guide this he said you can't find this in the bible school there is nothing you can find in the Bible school I said please where did you get this from something my heart was burning my hand went to know more then all of a sudden he bring out several churches and gave it to me and when he gave me the subway for seven good days I was on fire I took the cell that inspiration thinking the church I was they will see it or for me it was like I was seeing things I want everybody to see it this could be a false prophet I said this is not a false prophet this is truth brother since that time till now for 26 years I am a reviver Revival is not jumping from poopy to poopy no Revival is gone unveiling himself God is showing you God is revealing inside God is showing you your portion of the word of God that has come to you and when you see that you can both sing Amazing Grace that is amazing grace coming to you Grace is not it's not something you explain to somebody Grace is a person and when that Grace visits you when that Grace when God guarded meets you brothers and sisters I'm telling you it is not just it's not just west anymore you experience it you are living out Grace he said my gospel the word is finished therefore God spoke thought of me he spoke me in in my life I went ups and down though don't change God's what God thought of me never the reason why I speak like this is the prophet said if you don't know who you are the devil will take you and take you like this like handkerchief and bring you out shift up and down but if you know who you are when you know who you are when you know who you are the Bible says the guest of her there we come I guess the Revelation the acceleration who not only Jesus Jesus Christ is male and female it's good you know it by William Brown is a prophet that is good it's good to know that your pastor is you know is in the bride it's good to know that your fellow pronouns is in the body but that is not a voodoo the devil doesn't find that what the devil find is when you make it personal when you take it from the scripture you take it from the message you say I'm the one the prophet say all her hate that why because the day you know who you are you become an invisible Army when I when I when I read that the first time I said let me go and look what Invincible me you know what it means you are unconquered you are unbeatable when you when you when you know who you are the devil will come from right left and you will be standing no matter the trial you go through you are too flat-footed because you see yourself in that picture because that picture is the bride and the bridegroom when you see Jesus don't stop there begin to eat begin to feel the mess he eat all of a sudden you see inside our picture one hand another hand comes out don't stop there begin to feed all of a sudden you see another hand comes up don't stop all of a sudden you see the head comes out and it's a female and that female is not brother brother a brother B it's not William Abraham it's not brother it's not Brother Joseph it's you in that picture it's you in that picture see that oh brother you can go as long as slow you can be but anytime the word of God comes to you you will always say Amen you will never argue the word of God you will never no matter the situation because you are the one may flesh how can you deny yourself how can you deny that you're a human being how can you deny when this this message is repeated to you I'm not talking about somebody handing it or trying to explain this man say no When God comes to you this is the age of redemption claim God is claiming his children in obvious lives and why because he know where he plant his seed God just like a farmer my brother told me yesterday it was a farm you plant anything you have to prepare the Quran therefore we were prepared I was prepared you were prepared your soil will prepare before the foundation of the world therefore when the word of God when God begin to solve the Earth in this age your soul was it was recertive not just recentive you know there are places you plant some kind of things they will not grow very fast they will grow out and they become yellow but there are some they ground you playing the middle you plant me on the Sun what they just need is water and as you put the water under they are drinkers they are drinking the water they shoot out they drink they come out they drink that is what we are doing when the word of God comes to you because God predestinated you to this hour when the message of the hour comes to you and he that see that was there brother a Son of God is born and when that Son of God is born you are still baby don't worry when are you far just like my granddaughter my granddaughter can't work devil why should I force her to walk what she needs or what you need is given meek and she grow up make make after some time he told the mom I don't need milk anymore give me hard meat give me hard food why because his design now he's getting strength he's drinking he's growing all he's born everything that is what is happening in the spiritual realm when you receive them and say whether you fall or not don't worry continue to eat don't let the enemy tell you oh you have been a message for years you're far you do this you do that let me tell you Satan you were not there when God thought of me when you told them they said you said oh this guy know what is you know what he's talking about because me and you who were in the mind of God who were the attribute of God and become the logos I and me and you were the one who spoke Lucifer into existence therefore devil who who is the devil to tell me who I am no the devil can't give you identity the devil can't give me identity our identity has been displayed on the on the sky in 1963 the mighty angel came down and when the mighty angel came down he said that is you here that is me here therefore if you were not in the mind of God you will laugh at that if you were not in the mind of God you will make fun of the pillar of Fire if you were not in the mind of God you would think that we are crazy if we are not in the mind of God you will come up with this serious Minister that have been dismissed for 40 years all of a sudden they turn against God what they they went and swallowed what they have vomited could imagine that you know we still don't we don't let us count them out listen because it is not the will of God for any man to perish when that disrupt me I change the way I think about those people you know why God cannot judge you if he has never revealed anything to you there are people who receive this message in her knowledge they're being a message for years but they haven't have a single revelation of this message therefore that put them in a different category because God is not going to judge what did he refer to you therefore when it's revealed to you brother Revelation is where God in parties said to you when God is revealed to you brother you own this God is going to hold you to that therefore if God did not reveal it to you you might be in the message you may be coming to a child because your dad is coming you might be coming to the church because your husband is a pastor you might be coming to the child because your father is a dick but until God show you who you are in the Plan of Redemption if God if God in the beginning did not choose you to be the pride of Jesus Christ you can't make it therefore you can come and lie down here for 24 7. you can stop yourself to death thinking that you are going you're going to pray yourself into it it's not going to happen therefore what God in the plan of God there are people who are the bride there are people who are the foolish virgin there are people who are wondering 144 000 there are people who has never anybody gospel that God is going to give eternal life talk devil that is where we the bride very important because if Christ come to you you have to see the way Christ see because it is not the will of God for enema it doesn't matter what that person have done unto godson I'm finished with that person that's it brother but if God didn't say that who are you I let me change another thing when God came to he said let us make mine in our own image in the god in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve they were living nothing they were living a paradise everything was okay there was nothing wrong there was no sickness then Adam and he would go and throw another you know honey see that tree there can we move it from there to there is that tree he speak him unto that corner when the Praises blowing maybe they are walking and the prince is blowing Eve had to cover his faith say honey this bridge is too much say okay wait so please be still is put was spoke and everything will be peaceful but God was looking was looking there was an attribute in God God said this cannot go on like that he said the attribute in God as a savior was calling out the attribute as a savior came to the Eden and he projected he was moving he was moving all of a sudden the attribute called for a sinner and sin came into the Garden of Eden my question is if the attribute of God projected to Eve to fall who are you to stop that there is no way you can stop it because sometimes we try to cast get if or if they did if they die everything he did was in the plan of God everything because for God to be a savior sin had to come into the picture therefore the attribute of a savior was projecting was calling as he was calling the devil came into the into the into the palace he's walking around he was walking around all of a sudden I believe I could be wrong I believe that serpent was there in the Garden of Eden maybe for days months watching Eve starting Eve looking at Eve to see when the husband will be awake and all of a sudden he found the husband was maybe he gonna take a nap oh whatever and that attribute of a savior was calling and that attribute now was bringing Serpent and he closer closer closer closer and all of a sudden the attribution yes this is the time and serve the serpent proposed a word and Eve who came straight from the hand of God why did they accept he has said because the attribute was calling and before the foundation of the world he was projected that that is what's going to happen because when God thought of anything and when he speak it you can't stop it and all of a sudden Eve saw him and saw her said and when you find that another came and find out that he she did what don't supposed to do and I was not surprised Adam sorry well let me look Adam look when one seal open to Adam when the sin open to other I don't say you know what I am a son of God I know what to do to save my wife it doesn't matter if I go away with the word of God my father will not leave me where I am he went he put the same seed and put him to eat and when God kept them full of the evening the hand of God was high because with him his offspring his lock up in the womb of of Eve God could not destroy him if he destroyed her he would destroy himself I see the love of God that for God so loved the world away from the word of God God will send me a savior and that's what God Adam did Adam you see to save his wife before the foundation of the world God look at me and you you know where we came from you know the family some of us were born out of wedlock some of us was born in a broken heart some God said you know what I thought of these people the only way for me to say that is to put my seat there God before the foundation of the world he put the seed of representation instead of you than when the word of God come in this age you cannot but receive it because you are saved by the seed of God you are saved by God coming to you and live inside of you listen question and answer the prophet said the first creation was God himself couldn't imagine that God came back to himself and that is so surprising because God gave back to goat Pig we get back to a peak I have never seen where Pig get better to talk it's not possible therefore God when God is giving birth God is going to give birth to himself therefore when God comes to you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost what is reciting inside of you it's not human element that is God's DNA that is God's dear in you therefore you are God in human flesh you are God standing you are God working you are God driving you are God God is living in you because that is what he have in the bad part of his mind is that the first question what's God himself out of God came the logos which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the one in the big one and the world was with God and the world was God and the was made flesh and dwelled Among Us you know that scripture we used to refer that scripture to Jesus Christ alone but let me tell you that is me and you in the beginning what's the word the word was with God the word has become flesh that is the word of God don't limit that to Jesus Christ Alone don't leave me that no it is you listen the prophet son in a message excuse me let me is that in a message we'll see Jesus I said a really true born again Christian is the word expressed a real true don't again Christian is word express again because you are written a piece of God right of me listen there are people who cannot read the Bible anymore let me tell you the the progression of the word of God is this the word internal move into the logos and when they move from the logos it comes down it does not stop here this Bible has to be flesh it has to be flesh out therefore they thought of God moved from the written word into the manifested word of God and the manifested word of God is you it's me that's what God has in the mind and when God saw that in this age he came down he said this is my victory God becoming flesh you know some people they don't know you got to the same job they don't know who you are some of them mock at you some some of them talk bad of you but they don't really have idea they don't who they don't know who you are we are the written a piece of blood of all men say what what type of person should we be if we know our Our Lives is open Living Bible my life you see you might say fat in me you might say fault in your brother but let me tell you see the way God see forth is different from our old spot when God put Abraham he taught Abraham he said you stay here don't move from here and God the same God the same God allow femi to happen because the reason why they love you to go to ages because of family God would not be able to supply their needs God will be able to provide for them all they need God told them stay right there and they travel going to to Egypt where they were going Abraham told his wife he said listen you know that guy in that guy that's in a newspaper that guy is looking for he's looking for a new wife to God money and looking at you you are just like 25 or 26. and this man because you are the most beautiful woman on the end this man don't mind because they don't fear God they will kill me and take you you said about what we're going to do let us lie he said tell them that you are my sister I'm not a leader the wife caught the revelation you know there are some people when the husband tell them something they want to feel that they are more revelated than their husband they say oh no no no no no no no no no no when you when you tell them this they want to use another quote to characterize it but this one this woman caught in Revelation he said okay my dear they're gone they ask them who's this they say oh it's my wife in the first place the professor the second one he best leaded never those two for me and you disqualify him of being the Bride of Jesus Christ looking it from the human human way of looking at this or he lie or he do this or he do that he does not fit well it's not that God was just anywhere that's that's a projection there's an attribute in God that God wanted to display and attribute was moving and they bring Adam he bring Abraham and his wife they consult they conjure lies attribute of God bring them together they see that God was watching God said yes that is what I want that's one more step just tell you now this is my sister and they did that and the prophet in this age we have read that scripture over and over and over but the prophet of the age came to tell us that if if that is not happen we don't know what Grace is therefore the attribute of Grace was projected and Adam Abraham and could not help it they have to lie they had to align to bring that to pass and when they bring that to pass God said amen and not only that in the book of Hebrews God Christ in a different Tabernacle Christ the same God that allowed them to lie that give concept that come to say you know what that happened because of Grace came to Paul and Paul wanted to write the autobiography write the life of Abraham what did he say Abraham it was a Divine commentary who it was Christ in Abraham it was Christ in Paul that was right inside you know towards this guy might have stagger here might have lied he might have 10 lies might have done this and I've done that but from the Divine commentary when I look Beyond The Cutting of Time When I Look to what God was writing this man did not lie he did not disobey God everything was perfect that is what makes me and you different from God for me and you we can write them off right from here listen is the prophet said he know only as internal Spirit the bride was already existed in him when God was in the spirit being God myself I like to put myself there I don't know about you if you have that Revelation you can put yourself there is that we were already assisting in him in his mind yes she is she's existing in his thoughts before there was anything when God said oh I want to go to the Earth to express myself in flesh there were attribute that was a hint that were Consulting with him they were taught that he was fellowshipping with that thought is me and you let me ask you let me qualify what I'm saying the prophet said if God would have asked him which age he would like to preach he said it would be I would choose this age in other words when God was sitting down saying okay in this in the age of disciple Church ages who will go on to the Earth to preach brother Brown was there as a thought he said I will go there you were there brother you said I will be here as a preacher as a pastor you will raise up your hands and I will go there and say wife you or you came up and you were fellowshiping in God in his attribute in his mind you will agree with the word of God because you were a part of God don't separate Jesus Christ from his bride never you do that he said she was she was existing what about those thought of God are they etana I did not the internal thought of God let us and then and he thought of God in Tana yes therefore if you ask me Brother Joseph who am I speaking to this morning I am speaking to the internal thought of God the internal thought of God that live in 16 elements therefore this is not who you are this is a piece of that that in time if God follows all of us will go back today but what is inside of you is internal nothing can take that therefore if you come here you are here because God transported you here you are an ambassador you are a representative of God you are here to display to the world that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever how will people know that how will people know that is it by speaking tongue or is it by no is it the Bible said that they they the children of God the whole world the Hindu the Buddhist unbeliever they are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God what is the manifestation it's the one people who are able to take God at this world when God speak the word you stand there you say praise God I believe it you don't know how to explain it you can't even explain God God is a supernatural God therefore the ability the ability to believe God it does not come because you pray too much it was given to You by The Sovereign Grace of God therefore when you receive that God give you ability to receive the word of God for your age let me tell you you are the most richest person on the face of the Earth Hallelujah Hallelujah listen I want to read my close you see I just want to what I said I got project I want to read that to qualify so that you see who is this paragraph one three one one three the prophet said God Is A Healer and he cannot heal unless there is a sick somebody sick to heal you see if there has never been a sickness there will never been a Healer God being a Healer his attribute projected money devil if you are is it the one thing you have to know first if you are a child of God settle down when that is settled in your mind anything that comes along UPS down failure mistake whatever God will take care of it because the Bible said all peace all things your failure all things your sickness energy put it there our thing we work together you may not understand it but as the message begin to you begin to grow in the message you begin to find out that the mistake you made the path you took in your life Johnny God was watching over that and God sometimes are nothing to happen because he is the only one who knows the next step you don't know therefore you might cry let me give you an example yeah why God and a woman a woman in the world that woman first husband second husband third husband fourth fifth I believe that that woman would have cried and cried because we later find that this woman was the seed of God there was something in that woman that was crying out she don't want to do this the first husband left second husband and she cried and cried and cried and God was watching and the reason why God was watching I can show you I have a quote here the prophet said God demand God wants Worship in the life of that sister therefore we come to the time he was there deceased husband and the whole country or the whole city saying you know see that sister nobody should associate with that sister that sister is smart is gone and when it come to that when everybody decided this woman when everybody started she's not good then the attributes of God begin to look down begin to go inside I need to pass that where that woman was that what happened to you God needed to pass through where you were walking whether you were going to denomination God needed to pass through there and when he passed there all of a sudden all of a sudden gosh your and where God show up the seventh sea was displayed and when there's someone see display brother everything about her life that woman I see that oh what I I thought it was bad was for my advantage when I stand and it was what people used to mock me God uses to bring me closer to God to herself and when that is struck her what did he do she ran straight to the street he said come and see who has told me all my life God Jesus did not tell her or her life but when that sea open that woman could know there's a reason that reason was becoming clear and he went into this he went to the street and he called the Bible said because of that woman infant woman the whole street were saved let me again let me look for this quote you see what God wanted worship God wants a worship but he allowed this woman first husband second husband third husband but for her life on the first it was messed up but God has a purpose for her do you know why brother if you have never experienced humiliation if you have never experienced people mock at you if you have never experienced you were in the valley one time with a lot of sin on your back that you cannot erase by by any eraser you cannot because it's always there and all of a sudden the seven sea come to your your path you know what happened you will know what true worship is because it happened to you because his worship is not playing worship is not only play music worship is seeing yourself you look where God brought you and you can identify that is what worship is all about and that's what that woman God needed that let me tell you who can tell that woman after he had met with the with the seventh seal standing there designing what is in heart telling her lives like her life who can tell that woman that there is no God nobody nobody nobody can tell her oh God doesn't exist is this when you are sick and God they told you oh there's nothing I can do for you and God comes around and heal you can somebody tell you God doesn't heal nobody can tell you you know why because you experience it you know it that's what Grace is when you experience Grace my brother you know what you can see yourself that you were once a sinner all of us here I don't know where you came I know where I came from I know my background to see that in this end time the judge of Heaven and Earth in 1963 he came down and he put his face he said I am the judge of Heaven and Earth and when he came what did he come to do he came to tell us that our DNA have acquitted us because we never did it there was DNA test that would trust me and you to the mind of God and when he trace it down he saw me the way he saw me in the beginning he trusts you he said you have never seen the first place he said you are not a sinner you are a son of God you are a daughter of a God and from there he said who can let charge I guess in God's elect who who Who's pastor who brought you in and who will take you out is God who brought you in you are a son of God you are a daughter of God the DNA test there was a paternity test that you came from God that you are a son of God and that is what the bride is reliner God bless you Hallelujah let us pray if you are here this morning you God was speaking to you and you want to give your life probably you'll be coming to the church and you are one leg out one leg in probably God sent me here just for you just for you if you are here you want to rededicate your life you said Brother Joseph I've been this message but it's like nothing is working I'm here to tell you brother my sister God knows if God call you he's able therefore if you are here you want to rededicate your life to Christ I want to give you that opportunity it doesn't matter how long you'll be in the message there are people who are being the message but the message is not in them therefore if you are such a person don't be ashamed you are not ready your hands to me God we have mercy he call you in the first place he knows where to put things right if you are there just raise up by signify your hands signify by raising your hand and I will pray with you don't be ashamed you are not ready your hand to me Heavenly Father I thank you for this those hands Lord modern five six here father you told us by a prophet

somebody be sick to he still if they have never been sickness there have never been a Healer God Is A Healer his own attribute projected those things there has to be something to respond to that attribute that was in God now is that God the word of God means an object of worship God wanted God wanted to be worshiped so he has to project something that we're worship Him Jesus said to the woman at the world God is a spirit and then I worship Him must worship Him in spirit and the truth as I saw when the spirit of God is near what will take place salvation will be introduced salvation that will bring spiritual worship not singing of Dreams not a singing of him altogether but a worship in the spirit may God bless you thank you my brother for for giving me opportunity to come and we we love you we love the church and we love the Bride of Jesus Christ God bless you my brother wow hallelujah what a blessed people we are amen we just seen the love of God unbelievable this morning because the you know many many things when the brothers started preaching I was crying some of the exact same things he said almost word for word we preached three weeks ago here the second last sermon said you believe in that Jesus said in the Bible you believe in the father believe also in me believe also amen and people always get caught in the father in Christ then they couldn't believe in the prophet and now they can't believe in the bride of Christ Christ in his bride it's just amazing and the thoughts of God the prophet said he said when when God had those thoughts you you became and he spoke them you were the spoken word you are the spoken word book ing around God's spoken word theophany is just beautiful oh wow amen and you know you know when you look at the The Prophet's message and the last three or four messages he preached he mentioned the gene the gene of God multiple times about 23 times but he'd only mentioned it one or two times all the other years of his ministry but God knew he was taking the prophet off the scene and he wanted you know you're his Gene and he mentioned it there's over and over and over and over again in the last four messages this is the gene of God the gene of God God's doing the same thing today Antonia you're in my thoughts you're my theophany you're my theophany you're my spoken word you're my spoken word and very very soon I'm gonna take us home God knows when he's taking his home God knew when he was taking the prophet home and he's trying to tell you you were of me you came for me you were me you were there you were
