just hey man if you come here during the week and before I got sister Patty's mop there's times in the winter time I'd get on my hands and knees and go underneath the Pew with his cloth and clean up

bring brother Leo and sister Oliver's wife and Pastor Sande and and also brother Pastor Gideon and his wife also super sister Ruth to do everything for the ministers for free it's it's ours it's hours of work amen amen so just I just appreciate every one of you amen and all you're doing if any one of you I ever have a question about what's going on it's just all you got to do is ask it's an open book amen amen Hallelujah amen well I want to preach this morning or God wants to preach this morning on amateur creators and I want to my subtitle or my thought is if your world gets Jesus in the right place it'll be all right if your world gets Jesus in his right place then everything will be okay amen let's read Isaiah 66 thus saith the Lord the heavens is my throne and the Earth is my footstool and where is the house that you ye build unto me and where is the place of my rest for all these things hath my handmaid and all these things have been saith the Lord but to this man I will look even to him this will help us get Jesus in the right place that's poor and I'm a contrite spirit and trembless respect us at my word amen Lord Jesus we had asked you had the blessing to your word and we give you the glory and the honor for it in your name we pray amen amen you may have your seeds let's turn over to Matthew 21 amen Matthew 21 and 21 and Jesus answered onto them and said verily verily I say unto you that if you have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if ye shall say unto this mountain be thou God removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing you receive it amen God help us to actually believe God help us to believe what he said you know our Prophet showed us in the message he said and the Lexicon in the original Greek it said where the scripture is talking about this mountain be removed it literally means interpreted properly it means that you would be lifted up and thrown into the sea amen now that's radical that's extreme and we struggle with these things because we have fear we have fear that God still ain't God we do I do amen we have fear to speak things into existence the Bible says that he's a the high priest of your confection confession amen it's all right to say that next year amen God will give me this if you have the token amen God's speaking through your lips amen the prophet said that that with the messages in us and we will have not say it the Lord we put amen we put everything on the prophet you know I heard a Minister preach and it was it was just beautiful you know we're not raising amen now we need ministers we believe in faithful we believe in the prophets we believe in brother Brown but what about you but what about you do you believe in yourself do you believe in the bride it's easy for you to believe in the five-fold ministry it's even easy for you to believe in brother Branham it's easy for you to believe that God sent a prophet and he revealed the mysteries of the belief but you don't believe the bride but that was the message it was it was Christ sending a prophet to draw a wife to himself amen watch what the prophet says here and this is beautiful and praise God for the people that made the message of it's amazing it is the most amazing thing on earth here's a comment a mess uh that the prophet made regarding the scripture that we read in Isaiah 66 and 1 that heaven is my throne and Earth is my footstool he said now heaven couldn't hold them do you know this morning that heaven couldn't hold you did you ever think of that that's why you're here today heaven couldn't hold them and the Earth Is His footstool and heaven was his throne and yet it could bring the fullness of the godhead bodily and embodied it into no everything that was in Christ is in his pride if if heaven couldn't hold Christ he couldn't hold his pride amen if if the Earth is Christ's footstool it's the bride's footstool amen and the the whole godhead bodily was enthroned and God put it into you it's in the Paradox message in that that's powerful amen this morning amen help us Jesus you know there's a I want to just read a story before we look into some some quotes and that but maybe we'll we'll read a quote here he said the gospel always does this it always opens the eyes of some and reveals the truth to some while it blinds others it has a two-fold meaning some take the Son of God and look straight at it and go completely blind and others look take the son of God look at it and walk out a completely changed past he said it's always done this in every age deity veiled in fleshed notice that the notice the veil was behind the old Badger skin the old Temple and you know this morning when you look into this the reason that we're not where we should be the reason that brother Dale ain't where he should be it's because we haven't come in fully to Christ president come in fully to Christ because we would be able to speak Christ out by our words more often amen and not tremble when we say amen God will withhold his word it's God that amen I just was read listening to something this morning man Exodus 12 12 I think it is that God will fight for you the Bible's the lord it's not mine it's God's reason you know I heard it like this I said a minister said well I'm afraid to pray for healing because I'm going to have a healing light and you're going to come up and healed and you're not going to get healed so what will I tell the people either I'm false or are God's faults and you know what the minister answer Mike he said it ain't your responsibility to hold up God's word my responsibility to show you and preach it God's word amen God will take care of his hands you don't need to worry about that amen God help us amen but the reason that we're not where we should be this morning is because we fully commend to Christ and it's it showed perfectly in the Tabernacle in the wilderness in the Old Testament you know he had in the Tabernacle you had the outer carts and you had the inner courts that was really good I mean it had a beautiful building it had pot lights like this and that they were oil controlled amen and so here in the outer cards is where brother Dale lives too often when I listen to the news it might rain oh Lord we don't need no more rain it might hail they're going to be Looney size oh God we don't need help protect your crop Russia's you know God never said one place in the Bible to listen to the news mm-hmm the digital money's coming out in a couple years hmm outer courts outer courts amen it's because we care about this world that's our problem we didn't care about this world brother don't have no problems at all prepare that the digital money might come out and it might mess up our money system we care about this world so that person's in the outer cars and they're affected by the rain and the Sunshine and the clouds and their Christian life is just like whoa up and down up and down it's sunny day oh it rains three days and then a lot of message believers they move into the inner carts and that's a lot better because they have really cool oil lights and they put them on when it's raining and that and you know they have they have Windows that they close when it's windy and fans that they turn on when it's hot and it's climate control but their government has a problem with the electricity grid and it goes down and it messes everything up and you oh I hope I can pay my electricity bill and you know if you look at the message here today you'd say well there's probably about 40 percent in the outer cars and there's probably about 59.9 percent in the intercourse I hope I'm wrong and then there's a spot when you get to the holy police and the prophet said it like this I had the quote in front of me but I can say it by memory better he says a bond can go off right beside you and you're just like the Hydra can go off and nothing changes in the holy of holus and all your people can stay home from church and they don't change nothing because you didn't see any of them and nobody can the music player can miss a tune in the computer can shut down and the Bell can fall off the church and the steeple cannot be painted and you're just like whoa and you're zoned in with Christ in the holy of holies and it's just you and him that's all you recognize is him now there's other people there but you don't recognize them because you're just zoned in on him and that's called building a world and living on it he's saying now what is this world it's very clear what this world is it's called The Tokens or the baptism of the Holy Ghost uh-huh see a man cannot have two masters he will either cleats are the one and and reject the other or he will hate the one and love the other but when you get one master amen tell our Prophet told us he called it the hidden place a place that God made that you can be in and it don't matter if your bills are paid that affects me don't matter if it rains that affects me too it don't matter it don't matter it don't matter that's hardly a reality to brother Dale because I I have Badger skin so we have to get behind the badger skin amen amen the story is told of a minister that was trying to do his message and my God give me this message probably over a month ago I I was studying with it yesterday and putting some last things and written some quotes off and he was the minister was struggling with his little five-year-old girl because he was having a hard time studying and concentrating with his little girl and so he was in his study and in a map I want you to picture this and this is my title and he said the minister just got this idea he said you know I'm going to take the map off the wall it's been there too long and he said I'm going to tear it up in pieces I'm going to give it to my little girl and I'm going to tell her to go out to the table and put the world together and that'll keep her busy I can do my message and so he did that and he gave it to his little girl and then literally it just in a few moments the little girl come back in his office and said Daddy here you go I'm done and the minister was just stunned stunning said honey you don't know nothing about the world we don't know nothing about the world you know what's going on we don't have a clue our government hid it from us you know what's behind the scene she said you don't know nothing about geography how in the world did you put you together so quickly so perfectly she said what Daddy on the back of the map was a picture of Jesus now I realize that if I got Jesus in the right place my whole world will come in line that's where the minister got his title from putting Jesus in the right place if you get Jesus fixed in the right place your whole world will come together amen you don't need to tell us where you're living in the inner courts or the outer courts our actions and our fruits tell us very clearly and I know mine do to you too amen here in the hidden life the prophet said he said if we ever come to the place that we get our life in Christ and it means more to us than anything completely anything you need to sell something you sell it you need to not do something you don't do it uh-huh you get hit away and your whole motive and your whole agenda and everything you do in this life is to serve Jesus Christ you enter into a world into a place that God put you away amen God help us said in Romans 8 11 it said but this spirit in him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you if you ever get that spear that was in Christ it'll also Quicken your mortal body amen but his Spirit must dwell in you now the prophet said some things about that let's just read some examples here of what he said in in thy house in a 61 quote paragraph 84 he said as I said the other day he said when we're born again of the spirit of God he said God isn't weak in one place and strong in another he said if you got a shadow of God just a little speck of God I'm reading then you got all the power there is amen you got enough power to make a world and go out and live in it but of course thy power is controlled by your doubt by your faith and it see this faith is like this this is how you control it he said I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee all about well yeah I know he never did in the Bible but you know we're living you know the footsteps of the righteous man are ordered of the Lord oh yeah I know that but you know I thought this was so I went ahead uh-huh you know me and Mom were making some decisions this week and you know it don't have to be like super religious or some kind of like format you know you don't have to have a format on how you serve God you just gotta die and we were doing some business and me and the way I just sat there I said honey let's just say God just whatever we do just guide everything we do we don't know what we're doing we don't we don't know what our decision is but God we're gonna we're gonna call some people and whatever is supposed to fall together whatever it is we don't know who maybe what we don't know these people might be yes or no that was just that day but we should be like that every moment amen just whatever God your faith has to be like the same yesterday he's the same yesterday today and forever right it'd be like the prophet when he said one year from now to the widow woman you'll have a child that's why I can't say this morning that one year from now approximately one year give me Vicki we'll have babies in the rain amen it's no different God I'm not fearful to say that why would it be purple to say that you say whoa did God tell you that God promised me that Charles's kids are your heritage amen a happy is a man who's quiver is full of that Where'd I get that from the Bible maybe maybe this one will please you I know the thoughts that I have towards not to have kids oh no that's not in there I know that now by the way this is God talking in the Bible That's fairly good quote I know the thoughts that I have to you to prosper you and in health uh-huh right we say well yeah but you know I'm not going to prophesy because I'm not a prophet are you a part of the Bride are you part of the Bride the Bible says that you'll prophesy but because of our little faith and our fearing God or because we're not sold out to Christ then we're not in the holy of holies and we actually care if we lose this or this huh see we have an agenda Even in our own personal well God I don't want to really move now because you know pretty comfortable here but maybe God that was beautiful what the brother brought last Sunday you know he said he Elijah to the creek and he never said there will be a house a roof the Bible said I'll supply all your needs but he and he said I'll feed you with birds that eat on dead carcasses I win the win and you want me to tell you what you wouldn't have either you wouldn't either by where we're at now I'm sorry if I'm wrong but you know really like you would move out of your house to no house and you'd eat off the dead carcasses I'd have trouble with that but it was so beautiful other brother said just just take that out of this word so I know the thoughts that I have towards you do you think God thinks that the the the the the bride of Christ in a beautiful couple home that it's God's will that they would not be able to have children never that's a lie of the devil and the devil will give lots of evil homes and single mothers too many babies to raise them for the devil in control here you know you know who's making the most noise you know you're afraid to offend the construction worker on the job site to put on Amazing Grace or like you know some kind of beautiful song like Ben and Samantha singing but the you know when when Satan shows up on the job site and they're the drywallers and they put pornography rock and roll on they're not afraid of offending you how's that work now I'm not saying to just go around trying to offend people but you're afraid you're playing ashamed that's what the prophet said he said in one of these quotes I have in my iPad we back up man why can't we just we got something in our life it's a mountain we just say God remove it it's hindering My Worship to you get ready back because we don't it's controlled by your faith and that's an easy way to say that it's just your God is smaller than my God or than the actual God amen God help us and if it I'm finishing this it says the power is controlled by faith is God the same that's that's the Clincher right there and if it wasn't then we would if if this if creating a world wasn't controlled by your faith if it wasn't that's what the prophet saying then every one of us would have a world to go live on maybe that's why not everybody has the baptism of the Holy Ghost because the Bible says that no man came to the father they must first believe that he is Hallelujah we must first believe before I say Tim and Vicki will have children I must first believe that God is God period and that's where the trouble is with me and maybe others we must first believe that he is and without that we can't even please them wow he said if it wasn't for Faith every one of us would have a world and we would go live in it but this is our Prophet singing But if you're a son of God or a daughter of God I'm glad he put that in there you've got the power of God in you do you see now that's a direct quote do I really believe that and why if I believe it if brother Dale believes that then I got to walk out on this ice when the ice is melted put your faith in action that's what God's asking us to do amen so then you got the law of Faith pulls everything amen here's the secret in it amen this is beautiful um I just find them here oh here we go ah there we go ah Hallelujah I'm gonna get to the secret and say brother Dale how can you do this next quote after this he said see we're here receiving the spirit of God the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're receiving the spirit of God and God made the world out of nothing remember the prophet said that a spoon of the ocean was the same as the ocean it was just more of it but the exact same ingredients he said now we comma after receiving the spirit of the god after receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost about the spirit of God he said now God made the world out of nothing it's just his word but you're afraid for your word and you're probably afraid for my word but why he just created his world his word is creation so he just spoke it and the world was created because it was the object in God's mind in his heart he just spoke it and it come into existence he was creator and I said then if we we are you with me if we have Zoe God's life in US then we become Sons and Daughters of God and we're amateur creators and I said because he said whatsoever you thought I was off the word right but the prophet said whatsoever you say and believe that what you say period period that don't matter if it comes out of a sister's mouth or a child's mouth or a Brother's mouth if they have the spirit of God Zoe the God's own life dwelling in them then they have a spoonful of God so you hear this quote he said the secret is having God's spirit the secret is the token the secret is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're living below your privileges it's about time we start talking we're gonna have to go to the doctor or a doctor and my kids eight years old he don't even see Daddy yet how many years you got to got to leave us on Earth for the bride to start doing some talking well I am afraid I'll be a false prophet you don't have faith do you have a problem with faith so you actually have a problem with God because to have faith you must first love it ouch you must first believe that he is so our problem ain't with speaking our problem is with doubting to apply and create that atmosphere around you that they'll just drop right into it see he said oh you are if you now this exact quote he said if you got the token then you create a spirit a world around you now a spirit in an atmosphere is the same as the world and if you don't think so there's some people you don't want to be on their world because their atmosphere is toxic chemicals the prophet also give us one of those quotes and I like it I just put it on the bottom the token you create a spirit around you and a power that when you walk out people know that you're a Christian I don't know if it's all America he said they love you to say something to them the world would love you to say something amen and they believe your word the world to believe the world believed Jesus word before the church they believe your word and what you say and they'll hold on to it amen the secret is that seek it for this Authority is the token or the spirit of Christ or the baptism of the Holy Ghost or God's spirit or whatever you want amen how to create a world in Christ and go live it see Jesus said to the father in The Bible he said father I thank thee that you didn't remove them from the world but you let the evils of the world not touching the evil of the world I wonder if we're affected by the Eagles you know brother Brown said this 29 times in the results of creating an atmosphere in a world he mentioned world and creating an atmosphere amen changed your world around you he said you realize that if you're a son or daughter of God that you're an amateur creator you know I I tell you that's really I don't know if I did here's this comes to me it's a good story there was a brother in the states they get charged for murder did they tell you this how do you know you got to give me this message a long time there's a brother in the Saints I could charge for rape and murder and because of politics and it don't matter if the Republicans are the Democrats or anything for the conservatives are the liberal because of politics the outrage in the community were so great that the only thing the police wanted to do I mean the police were doing their fast I don't mean that wrong but they needed to find somebody to the public down we draw them he's behind Birds so they went and grabbed this black brother and grab them the church food he wasn't part of the Bride that I know I don't even know that he was a professing Christian and his government put them behind bars for 39 years you know how long that is that's longer than most in these cities 39 years ago and he was 100. seconds and he got out I'm a DNA and it released him and when that Story come out the news people asking how in the word did you keep this together for 39. just okay wrongfully a hundred percent nothing like absolutely he wasn't even ahead and he said they could lock up my a non-believer you know look at all the great things that the apostles did in the Old Testament and they never even had to overdose I worked right uh we're afraid to say ah they went into they went into the fiery furnace and then everyone smelt like smoke not only did that not get burned they didn't even smell like I tell you what me and mom went to the steam Thrashers yesterday it was really cool we went to a lot of antique stores where things I'd never seen like but the beans they were cooking on the thing they weren't in the fire they smelled like snow man you just put this one it's like wow and it was so strong this moment it felt like they literally put these in the baked beans I mean I like baked beans but like I don't smoke and they were flavored but he said they can lock up the spot that they can never you know you might you might live in Canada and you might you know you might whatever you might be working and you might deal with your world you could be losing money or making money or whatever it is you know we went through a ridiculous part of you know the world and they might lock us up they can't lock up does this ain't me if a if a straight non-believer can say that uh-huh a straight like like not even a denominational Christian he said they locked up my body but in my mind I I was powerful could you be locked up 39 years and come out can you even come out and have it together it shows that we have to get into a different life we have to create a world to God that this world is not my home I'm a gist of visiting here and the holiday has been too long you can shorten this holiday any day the motel bills are out of the world you get the picture well we're pretty comfortable we're not excited for God for shorten your beef why because you know I read I read what the quote in the prophet when he called his wife back when she was done and it would it you know I I've read that just many many many but I read it you know differently or something and she said you know see you like life and here she was a young mother even her little tiny Sunday and Bill called her back she said oh wow let me just tell you what she said she said I was crossing and there was somebody in a white guy and they were walking me down and there was beautiful trees and the wind was blowing and the birds were singing she was walking and she's looking right at the love of her life for him in her 20s what are you doing and she told the pop I know you know this but I'm going to tell you again she said you preached it you don't or you preach it you don't understand I don't I or you preaching and you don't realize it it was all the same like I'm I'm not reading it basically the prophet was preaching how great Heaven is but he didn't believe it and we say with our mouth really cheap things like how great our God is and we have the best thing in the world but we don't speak nothing because we don't believe we don't speak those problems nobody if we don't say you know this we think God's it's God's will that we're in this fact I know the thoughts that I have to put you it wasn't right what are you gonna do that's good well I don't want to read that scripture I just believe in Trump Billy's wife said this she said honey I'm sorry to leave you she said and just doing it from memory I'm just but she said please let me go it was the most wonderful just married with the first little man in her 20s madly in love see we don't believe if I die and I am here next Sunday you'll cry maybe maybe some of you'll Rejoice but most of us you know if one of our children something I'd try but please let me go you preaching but you know here's another one in 63. oh six he said you know did you know that you're a little Creator yourself did you know that certainly you are and he said and you've seen people that are just loved to be around creating a world and go live on it but let me just jump down he said and they and he said but you've seen the kind that you don't like to be around now this is our Prophet saying this we didn't think we had permission to save us but sister Patty there's people that me and you don't like to be around I mean and everybody else well we didn't know we had the prophet says it it's for you he said that's because they create an atmosphere but the life they lived and the way they talk and their conversation amen he says in here in some of the quotes these birds with feathers blocked together have you seen ministers hang around people and all they talk about is Million Dollar bank accounts a million dollar cars and they'll give nothing to Africa or the Philippines or missions or and the ministers come by you know let me I tell you something I had somebody call me from Africa and they asked me to buy his plane ticket to go preach in another church I'm like hello we said that Minister on it he said but that Minister I'm preaching for he only offered me five hundred dollars I'm like what do you think like I said well if you preach for us we'll certainly give you a love gift or if I invited you I would take care of your costs did you know there was Ministries or something that don't do that in Canada would you like me to tell you how much he asked me for 1 000 U.S he said I got 1500 so far would you just give me a like like my tree's dying I've been picking it so off I'm like or if you see a minute you see what I mean birds with feathers fly together if you throw parties all the time and you don't want nothing to do with God or party or you don't want no man you know when we took the minister back last Sunday we didn't know how it was all falling together we we operate about an hour behind time and and I needed to it was just the way it worked out I needed to sell cattle on Tuesday so how we got we took the minister to the next place on Monday and we went somewhere and they were having a picnic just Believers and Believers that invited lots of people there was lots of girls that were invited you know that you could tell weren't believed it was like 200 some people there I'm like oh man if I threw a picnic would you come don't answer that but it's like do you like being together or are you like just brother Bernard's children you know the man went up there and I had a couple I had the mechanic working on my tractors and thought and a little man see that their reasons and they were looking around my wife for brother Dale are you like that do you look around to see if the whole family comes maybe it's because you're not in the maybe you're in the other courts because see those worldly friends they'll never be in the holy holies unless God Guru Maybe the atmosphere is what he says he says now you've seen those people not this by the way this is the prophet talk he said you've seen those people that every time you send them we're not are we supposed to something well may the Bible Well the Bible says that some Mark does that cause problems he says all the time they want to talk about something evil oh it's okay to send them people and they talk about somebody brother there somebody say oh my there they come and they're such a Critic critical critical of somebody there and he's in here now and he's going to talk about this brother and he said you just hate to get around them see because they create seemingly they're seemingly pretty nice people but they create an evil and the things that you think on and the things that you do and the actions and the things you talk about creates and the things that you think on and the things that you do and the actions and the things that you talk about creates your word amen God help us man here he says when your sons and daughters of God the atmosphere and even the air that you live in is created a situation around you that either draws in or pushes away Hallelujah 29 times the atmosphere amen John 17 9 and we're going to close with this 17-9 and then we're gonna jump to 14. he said I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which has given me for they are mine and let's jump to verse 14. for I have given them Thy word he's talking about God and the world hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world here's Jesus making you is co-equal now watch this watch this but do you see all ministers do that you don't have to answer that here's the king of glory making you co-equal and the world hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world and I pray not for that thou shalt take them out of the world we're we're born to live right here in Wyoming but how are we doing How We Do let me tell you some stories not food you know the people on this road are watching me you know when me and Luanne came to one Wednesday night they were out here in the thing and the guy literally almost run and got a rate and leveled the gravel and put it up by the cement and pulled the mud down and that stuff up I was mowing the grass on it on a day I think it was a Wednesday they said and I can buy and I'd mowed the back grass and I'm coming up the side and there was a guy sitting on Dozer right here and there was a guy talking to him now they're plain working they're not bothering me I had the mower set like like blades off I'm driving by and I could tell the guys like that's why I shut the mower off he says I see you have a service they was inside that they would disturb us on a Wednesday night are you concerned they're not believing I told them I said listen I said many of our people drive far many of them worked in construction or afternoon I said it would be a very light crowd to me but I said you know this next Sunday which was last Sunday I said we're going to have joint fellowship and there'll be a lot of people here because there'll be people here and he said we'll have it tied you down nothing around they can do we do you care about them you know what the Bible says this is Christianity to build visit the widows and Europeans somebody's one visited John Black I'm gonna go see Stephen was the last time you weren't seeing system s I pray that thou shall not take them out of the world but that thou shall keep them from the evil and the day or night of this world I love when Jesus makes they're not of the world even as I am the same as him if we fix Jesus in the right place our whole world we come together there's many things that we do that are not wrong not even but if they hinder us between our walking cross then that makes them even amen like like for example just for example it's not evil and I actually believe in it if it's possible it's not evil for parents to leave something for their kids 50 cents or a dollar when they're you know after the funeral Bill's paid so they could go and buy a Pepsi or something but if that hinders you from showing them Christ and that's evil there's many things in our life that aren't evil working ain't neither or living life or having fun it's not evil it's all partner but if it hinders us in Christ if Christ wouldn't be welcomed there you remember if you're a believer Christ goes everywhere you go unless he's not welcome our Prophet clearly said he said if you were to go into some places the dove but wait okay I wonder if we say well you know just this man I mean the Holy Spirit loves family time and like I've seen pictures Jared and Julie were canoeing and it was amazing that's amazing that's life God's a family he's a family man you're part of this family that's amazing that that's done we're not talking that you just got to be in church seven days a week no no no no but would Christ be welcome it's Christ welcome in the community he can be for that he loves canoeman he made it amen God help me we get Jesus in the right place let's sing that song we're saying to begin Lord my heart can grow sometimes we can just forget about Christ sometimes brother Dale is living in the outer carts it's rained a lot this July or sometimes we're in the inner cogs I woke up the other night and the Hydra was out but how often do we get into just you and him just you and him there'll be other people there but your only focus is just me in Christ you won't be worried about what Putin's doing you won't be worried about Kim's doing in North Korea you won't be worried about the hilarious joke of politics you won't be worried about the next plague or the next dollar or the next digital or you won't be worried about none of that I think brother Dale worries more about this world than the world I say is better I think there's a lot of company where I'm living God wants us to change amen God wants us to you know we can we can be farmers and mechanics and whatever we are but we need to just keep him okay we need to keep them our code Jesus it's amazing you know when the prophet said when you get that they won't be the people that you think Were Heroes will look at you and they'll say how in the world the three Hebrew children they'll look at you and they'll go wow you survived the age of advertisements and internet [Music] and yet for me when I make my name is [Music] thank you [Music] see our life many years ago me and Mom work we went were in a big grocery store inside and one of us got out and the wind kind of caught our door one of our doors and we smashed the car race I mean we one of us they really now we're fairly old and we looked the situation over there I said well and the other one was just taking a slice off the airplane how can you ever do this I said well we must go buy our hot dogs hot dogs we can back up boy to say that they weren't enough one hundreds so now listen we did something very bad here's our business card here's our phone number here's some places we work for Bodywork you can take down wherever you want we will pay 100 of them thank you now they were very heated up when we come up I would any of us but when they got my business card and you know they kind of knew where we lived and the muscle picture that I would truly you know they had our license plate they idea you know they never ever called us what have I done never ever helped I left in my car I didn't know their number they had my license plate they had the downloaded they had my business I was willing to pay and I was guilty or we were guilty what am I super guilty and oh man it was good real but now we're the bride and that card's Our God maybe see how we live you're gonna pay and here's non-believers they had the right sometimes our kids do things or neighbors or different things I mean things happen people ride a bike by your car and you just but in 10 years I've seen a Cadillac the other day just to just God has a way of checking where you're living what what God's doing is he's trying your test and he's seeing who's you got and sometimes the people working on the road show us or the people in the big grocery store you know the Bible says that uh listen we're guilty foreign [Music] foreign [Music] I am Hallelujah [Music] hello my God thank you Lord Jesus Blessed Be Your Name Hallelujah [Music] God bless you this morning thank you [Music]
