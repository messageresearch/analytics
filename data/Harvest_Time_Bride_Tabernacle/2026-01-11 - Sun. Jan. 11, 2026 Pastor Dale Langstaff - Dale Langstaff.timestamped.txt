[25:52] are letting in the cold, cold air.
[25:59] I say to myself, I'm going to fix some
[26:04] when I can get the time.
[26:10] But all I'm getting
[26:13] lately
[26:15] is leaving on your mind.
[26:21] Lately all my God is leaving on my mind.
[26:34] That's all I'm thinking about.
[26:39] Oh my
[26:48] leave my
[26:52] behind.
[27:01] Leave it all behind.
[27:06] I guess I should be looking for
[27:11] a better place to live.
[27:17] But I can't seem to get excited about
[27:23] this world and what it has to be.

[30:07] Amen.
[30:14] Amen. Thank you, musicians. Amen. God
[30:17] bless you. We'll read our scripture.
[30:19] just remember brother Leu and and sister
[30:22] Margaret. I'm sure they're on their way,
[30:24] but just uh coming coming from London
[30:27] and
[30:28] uh how many enjoyed our summer weather
[30:32] and on Thursday? I did. I'll put my hand
[30:34] up. I have that ordered for my birthday
[30:36] on the 26th. 60° is perfect.
[30:41] Amen. Just uh Amen. It's really good to
[30:45] have Matt. There we go. They got two
[30:48] feet of snow and had one week got
[30:49] freezing rain and and a whole bunch of
[30:52] other stuff mixed in there. Amen. Let's
[30:54] turn to Romans.
[31:00] Amen.
[31:03] Romans 14 14 and 15.
[31:09] [Music]
[31:15] I love the presence of the Holy Spirit
[31:17] here. And
[31:19] man, if God allows me, I'm going to
[31:21] share
[31:23] a supernatural testimony that Sister
[31:25] Margaret told me when we were at their
[31:28] house. And man, God is very, very good.
[31:31] Amen.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; For as many as are led by the spirit of
[31:35] God, they are the sons of God. You know,
[31:38] the Bible says that where your heart is,
[31:40] that's where your treasure are. Lately,
[31:43] all I can think about is leaving
[31:45] &gt;&gt; cuz that's where my heart is.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; Led by the spirit of God are the sons of
[31:52] God. In verse 15, for ye have not
[31:54] received the spirit of bondage to fear,
[31:58] but ye have received the spirit of
[31:59] adoption,
[32:01] whereby we cry, Abba,
[32:05] father. And let's just one more
[32:07] scripture in Judges uh 6:12.
[32:11] Judges 6:12 and
[32:14] just pray for me and our service that
[32:17] God will be speak to us. Amen. And the
[32:20] angel of the Lord appeared unto him.
[32:22] This is Gideon. And said unto him, Lord,
[32:27] the Lord said,
[32:29] the Lord is with thee, thou mighty man
[32:33] of valor. Lord God, I pray that you'll
[32:36] add the blessing to your word and may
[32:39] you speak
[32:41] life and encouragement to your people
[32:43] today. We pray and be pleased with
[32:46] everything that's said and done. In your
[32:47] name we pray.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats.
[32:56] Amen. For as many are led by the spirit
[32:59] of God are the sons of God. If you're
[33:02] led by God, then God's telling you that
[33:06] you're one of his. You're part of his
[33:08] family. And we have not received the
[33:10] spirit of fear. And we've been preaching
[33:12] on fear and and just we're not we're
[33:15] going to move on because I I I don't
[33:16] like repeats, but you know, we can the
[33:19] Bible says that without faith, it is
[33:21] impossible to please God.
[33:23] &gt;&gt; And it is impossible to have faith and
[33:26] fear at the same time.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; That's right. That that's that is in
[33:30] every way impossible.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; God help us. Cuz in Hebrews 11:1 it
[33:38] says, "Now faith is the substance of
[33:41] things hoped for, the evidence of things
[33:45] not seen." Now there's no way in the
[33:48] world that you're packing fear
[33:52] and faith at the same time. God bless
[33:54] you, Sister Margaret and Brother Lu.
[33:58] Amen. We just this this is not a
[34:00] possibility. And so we see in our lives
[34:03] and and this is not a this is for me. I
[34:05] I'll say for me but many of the times we
[34:08] see that most of the times we are like
[34:10] Gideon. Now he was a great man of
[34:12] Babyler.
[34:14] &gt;&gt; So don't knock that.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; But we should be like
[34:19] Abraham or David.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to show you the
[34:24] difference. We should be like Abraham or
[34:27] David or the three Hebrew children or re
[34:30] or or Rebecca.
[34:33] And there's a big difference.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; You see, I seen an article and studying
[34:38] this week and and it said something like
[34:40] this and and it catch you on off guard
[34:43] maybe. It said, "Believing in Jesus but
[34:45] not obeying him is exactly
[34:50] what Satan did."
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That's right.
[34:54] Yeah.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; So Jesus said, "If you're led by me,
[34:58] you're a son of God. And if you have
[34:59] trouble with that,
[35:02] &gt;&gt; well, Satan had trouble with that."
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; Believing in Jesus, but not obeying what
[35:08] he said.
[35:10] And we see here in the story of of
[35:12] Gideon, we want to jump into this cuz we
[35:14] got to go like a rocket this morning cuz
[35:16] we have communion. But but just to to
[35:19] lay a little bit of a foundation here,
[35:20] we know that faith is the substance of
[35:22] things hoped for.
[35:24] Amen. And without faith, it is
[35:26] impossible to please him.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; For he that cometh to God must believe
[35:30] that he is. And he's a rewarder. Watch
[35:33] this. And he is a re, this is Bible,
[35:36] that he is a rewarder
[35:39] of them
[35:41] that diligently
[35:45] &gt;&gt; seek him. that diligently do their daily
[35:48] devotions, that diligently think, I
[35:50] can't think of nothing but going in a
[35:52] rapture, that diligently serve him.
[35:57] Amen.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; You see, we don't have to, you know,
[36:00] many Christians are backed in a corner
[36:02] and and and afraid of they're afraid to
[36:04] trust God and and and they put God in a
[36:06] box. They say, "Well, my God can't do
[36:08] that, but my God can do things that I
[36:10] can't even imagine about doing." And we
[36:12] don't have to wait till we get to the
[36:14] millennium to be happy. If you have the
[36:16] baptism of the Holy Spirit today and
[36:18] you've received and you've been born
[36:21] again, you don't have to, you know, John
[36:23] 1, first John, it says, "Beloved, you
[36:26] are now the sons of God, and it does not
[36:29] yet appear." It don't appear cuz you can
[36:31] still see my flesh, what we shall be,
[36:35] but you shall know that when he shall
[36:38] appear, we shall be like him. That's in
[36:40] our character and in our whole daring.
[36:44] For we shall see him
[36:47] as he is in Ephesians 2 6. And he has
[36:52] raised us up together
[36:55] to sit with him in heavenly places in
[36:57] Christ Jesus. That don't mean when we
[36:59] get to heaven. That means right now.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; That means right when you become born
[37:03] again.
[37:05] See, you are a creator. And if you're
[37:07] happy this morning, that was a decision
[37:09] you made.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; And if you're sad, that's a decision you
[37:13] made.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah,
[37:14] &gt;&gt; because you can decide to be like
[37:17] regardless. Look at how Job said, you
[37:19] know, though the skin worms eat this
[37:21] flesh, I will see God, you know, no
[37:23] matter what comes against me, I'm going
[37:25] to build a thing that it's good. God is
[37:27] good.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; The footsteps of the righteous are
[37:30] ordered of the Lord. And so we see here
[37:33] if we if we move on here quickly in
[37:36] Judges 6 and and I'm not going to read
[37:38] all these scriptures but I might give
[37:39] you some highlights of these scriptures
[37:41] that the Israelites had been had been
[37:43] pun the Israelites disobeyed God
[37:48] and God turned them over for correction
[37:51] to the Menites for seven years
[37:55] and the Israelites hid in dens and caves
[37:58] and this is all in in Judges 61-6.
[38:01] and and and and the Minionites literally
[38:04] took over. They were like grasshoppers.
[38:06] They took over their wealth and their
[38:08] food. And here's God's people starving
[38:10] to death. You know, God didn't save you
[38:13] to make you starve to death. God didn't
[38:16] save you to give you bankruptcy.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; God didn't save you to to give you hard
[38:21] times.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; I didn't say he saved you to make you a
[38:26] trillionaire either. But God said he
[38:29] will supply your needs according to his
[38:31] riches and glory. And God gave us his
[38:33] Bible is it's a very good guideline.
[38:36] There's things if you spend more than
[38:38] you make, you're going to have trouble.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; And here the Israelites
[38:45] were under this persecution for seven
[38:47] years. You know, I want to type that to
[38:49] the seven church ages. We almost hit it
[38:52] by our tree. But, you know, we've been
[38:54] in seven church ages
[38:56] and the Christians that were sold out to
[38:59] God were not beat down.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; You know, we're not I'm not going to
[39:02] barely get to heaven.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go to heaven rejoicing and
[39:06] dancing and doing cartwheels and
[39:08] headstands. I'm not going to bar I'm not
[39:11] going in in a wheelchair.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; No, I won't need an escort by somebody
[39:15] pushing me in or dragging me in.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; No, it did not happen.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:24] Amen.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; It's so different than you can
[39:26] comprehend.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; I just I just right now I I'm going to
[39:31] share that testimony. Sister Margaret
[39:33] and forgive me if I I miss it, but we
[39:36] went to their house, had a beautiful
[39:37] time, and a sister in Uganda had told
[39:40] her an experience that had happened to
[39:42] her. And literally it just it just has
[39:46] as you know I've heard things like that
[39:50] before but it's just affected me the
[39:52] testimony. I pray to God it'll affect
[39:55] you. But she was there and I believe she
[39:58] died anyway. I believe she got bit by a
[40:00] snake but for whatever reason she died
[40:03] and she she left her body. She was going
[40:06] to heaven to believe her and and she
[40:08] she'd leave her body and she could see
[40:10] the doctors working on her trying to
[40:12] save her life
[40:14] and and she's going to glory and her
[40:17] husband and her daughter were back
[40:19] crying. She had a family, young kids,
[40:20] but her older daughter and her husband
[40:23] were back here praying for God to save
[40:25] her. And and as she as she left her
[40:28] body, all the people that knew all the
[40:31] saints that had won before came out to
[40:32] greet her and to meet her and said, "Oh,
[40:35] God bless you, sister. Welcome home."
[40:37] And you it's so good to see you. And and
[40:40] just on and on and on.
[40:43] You You can't comprehend it.
[40:46] There was no darkness that she went
[40:48] through. There was no clouds. She was
[40:50] just She was out of this life. It's like
[40:53] a blink, a twinkling of an eye. I'm here
[40:56] today and I'm gone tomorrow. You don't
[40:57] have to cry for me when I'm gone. I'll
[40:59] be in the presence of Jehovah.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; And here she was in the presence of the
[41:04] saints
[41:06] and she said, "Oh, this is so on. This
[41:09] is beyond
[41:11] what my human body can comprehend."
[41:15] Yeah.
[41:15] &gt;&gt; And here her husband was begging God to
[41:18] send her back. And she looked back at
[41:20] her body and it looked so decrepit
[41:24] and so sinful and so dirty, just like
[41:28] mud.
[41:29] And she said, "Oh, God, please. I don't
[41:32] have to go back in that temple."
[41:39] Most of us are fighting to stay in this
[41:41] temple that's covered with sin, shaped
[41:44] in iniquity, telling lies to survive.
[41:53] And the believers or Jesus said to her,
[41:56] he said, "Sister, you have a young
[41:58] family on ours and your husband, your
[42:01] daughter needs you there for a short
[42:03] time."
[42:05] You see, God didn't make this journey
[42:08] like to be fearful.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; It's a lie of Satan that places fear in
[42:15] your life.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:18] You know, Paul said to live is gain, but
[42:21] to die is is Christ. Or however, you
[42:24] know, he always said it in the Bible.
[42:27] Amen. The greatest journey you're going
[42:29] to ever take is when you close your eyes
[42:30] on this side.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; And everybody's waiting for you on that
[42:34] side. I tell you what,
[42:38] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; It's not going to matter what you own
[42:40] here.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; You're not going to think, "Wow, I wish
[42:43] I could have brought that old house with
[42:44] me." Oh,
[42:46] &gt;&gt; this old house is all falling down
[42:47] around me.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; I took the insurance off my house burned
[42:51] down. I never build a house like that
[42:52] again. I just build a little tent. I'd
[42:55] build two rooms.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; A bedroom and a kitchen and party room
[43:01] &gt;&gt; and heat the floor. That's what I would
[43:03] build.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; I'm not staying here.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to stay in a big
[43:08] house. I'd be alone. You know, my wife
[43:11] this week, she I I was actually sitting
[43:14] at the table studying and she told me,
[43:17] she said, "Send the neighbors a message.
[43:20] Tell them to come over for supper." And
[43:23] I knew that I had misheard her
[43:26] because I, you know, I lived with my
[43:29] wife for many years, 40 years, and I
[43:31] knew that, like, I believe in the body
[43:34] change, but I didn't think it'd happen
[43:35] right in front of me. And so I ignored
[43:37] that for about two hours and I was
[43:39] focused in on my studies and my message
[43:42] sitting right at the table. And she
[43:43] said, "Did you message the neighbors?"
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; That not only did they come over, but
[43:54] they didn't go home till go until 11.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; That's what our that's that's our life
[44:00] ain't to live here in a big house alone.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to live here alone.
[44:06] And I want to go into heaven where I
[44:07] could just in a thought be with all the
[44:09] believers in the world. I think of
[44:11] believers. Believers this week,
[44:12] yesterday asked me to come to the
[44:14] Philippines for February for dedication
[44:16] services and around the world. You don't
[44:18] think when you get to heaven, you just
[44:19] said a moment you'll be there. You'll be
[44:21] in their presence. You
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; And so we see here in Gideon and Israel
[44:29] was beat down and they were greatly
[44:32] improvish in verse six.
[44:35] greatly improvished by the the Amorites.
[44:38] [Music]
[44:39] And the children of Israel cried out to
[44:41] God in repentance for their sin. And God
[44:44] actually and I skipped this verses, but
[44:47] God actually sent him a prophet. And
[44:49] here
[44:50] to to bring them back on their journey.
[44:53] And here in verse 10,
[44:56] uh
[44:58] God told
[45:00] Canaan or Gideon, sorry. He said, "I am
[45:04] the Lord thy God
[45:06] and fear not
[45:08] all these other gods." And here here
[45:11] Gideon was uh thrashing his wheat and
[45:14] you know because they were overrun and
[45:16] they had nothing to eat here. Here he's
[45:18] hiding in caves and underneath a tree
[45:20] and he's he was in the wine press trying
[45:22] to get some wheat so they could eat to
[45:25] hide it from the Menites. In verse 11,
[45:29] and the angel of the Lord came down and
[45:31] sat there. And I want to and I want to
[45:34] show you in this message why that we
[45:35] should become an Abraham or a David
[45:40] as opposed to a Gideon.
[45:43] Because the angel of the Lord came right
[45:46] face to face with Gideon
[45:50] and appeared unto him, the Bible says,
[45:51] and he said, "The Lord is with thee,
[45:56] thou mighty man of valor." Do you know
[45:58] God is telling you that this morning?
[46:01] &gt;&gt; And many of you sitting here
[46:05] are doubting.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "Those that are led by the
[46:11] spirit of God are the sons of God.
[46:16] That's right.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; That it does not appear what he's
[46:18] prepared for us. See, it it is so
[46:21] supernatural, God's simple word,
[46:24] that we say, well, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[46:26] yeah, yeah. But
[46:28] that's exactly what Gideon did. Gideon
[46:31] went to the Lord and he said, but Gide
[46:33] the Gideon is it's so hilarious how
[46:35] spirits don't die. Gideon went to the
[46:37] angel of the Lord and he said, I'm poor.
[46:41] And he said, "I'm the least of my
[46:44] family."
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; God, you never picked me. I'm the last
[46:51] in line. Failed grade one. It went to
[46:53] speech therapy in grade two.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; What could I do, God?
[47:01] &gt;&gt; That's what Gideon thought.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; And here the Lord said, I'm sending you.
[47:09] And and Gideon, he was struggling to
[47:11] believe it. He said, "But where's the
[47:13] God here? Let's just look at this." In
[47:15] 13, Gideon said unto the Lord, he said,
[47:16] 'Lord, if you be with us, then why has
[47:19] this all befallen us?
[47:24] And and Lord, and where is all his
[47:27] miracles which our fathers told us of?
[47:32] And did not the Lord bring us up out of
[47:34] Egypt? And the Lord hath forsaken us and
[47:37] deliver us. You know, I want I want to
[47:39] correct Gideon here. God had not
[47:41] forsaken them.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; No,
[47:45] &gt;&gt; remember what I said at the beginning.
[47:47] Satan believes in Jesus,
[47:49] &gt;&gt; but he don't obey him.
[47:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Lord looked and he said,
[47:58] "Go in this, thou mighty man. Thou shalt
[48:01] save Israel from the hands of the
[48:04] Minionites." And then he went right in.
[48:07] said the next verse, he says, "Well, I I
[48:10] can do that, God."
[48:13] You know, God's got a lot of patience.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:20] Do you think God had figured out that he
[48:22] could do it before he asked him? God
[48:24] wasn't asking for his strength. God was
[48:27] anointing him with his spirit
[48:30] and giving him supernatural ability
[48:34] to do what God had called them to do.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; And so this is the difference between
[48:41] some of the believers in the Bible
[48:45] and Gideon.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; And you know, I hope I'm not Gideon.
[48:55] In verse 17 it said, "And he said unto
[48:57] him, now if I have found grace in thy
[49:01] sight, then show me a sign
[49:05] that thou talkest to me." Now I want to
[49:08] I want to just show down though. This is
[49:10] this is this is everything that's wrote
[49:12] in the Bible is wrote for a reason.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible just said a few verses
[49:17] previous that the angel came before his
[49:22] face
[49:24] and spoke with him.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Gideon didn't recognize the angel.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; He would have never asked for a sign if
[49:38] he had recognized the angel.
[49:41] Amen.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; You know that brother Bram said that
[49:43] your pastor
[49:45] is an angel given to you
[49:48] &gt;&gt; to show you the truth of God.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; But we're living in a world that most
[49:53] people won't have a pastor.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Because they didn't see the angel.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:05] And Gideon went and he he asked the
[50:07] angel to wait. And Gideon went and and
[50:09] and I have to go fast because I got some
[50:12] more hay on my fork. But Gideon went and
[50:14] he baked a meal.
[50:18] And the angel said he would wait. And
[50:19] this verse 20 is the first time that the
[50:23] here he asked God. He said, "Show me
[50:25] sign." Now he'd already showed him face
[50:26] to face.
[50:32] Do you know that? Do you know that
[50:34] you're walking in the presence of angels
[50:37] daily
[50:39] &gt;&gt; that protect you?
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; When that car almost hit you, that was
[50:42] an angel.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; And you said, "Whoa, that was a close
[50:48] one." No, that wasn't a close one. That
[50:49] was an angel.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; That was an angel. Amen.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; You know, I was going through when I
[50:57] thought we were we got pretty much
[50:59] snowed out or iced out of our New Year's
[51:02] uh day Sunday, but I was going through
[51:04] and me and Lyn were putting down
[51:06] testimonies of things that had happened
[51:08] in our life.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[51:10] &gt;&gt; those are angels.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, that's right. And here
[51:14] Gideon, he baked a a a dinner and he put
[51:17] it on the stone.
[51:19] And the angel of the Lord in 21 took his
[51:23] staff
[51:24] and laid it on the stone and fire came
[51:27] out of the stone and consumed it.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; That's miracle number two.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:39] and Gideon. Verse 22.
[51:42] And then Gideon perceived that
[51:46] we are funny people. I'm not making fun
[51:48] of Gideon. I I'm making fun of myself.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; And Gideon then perceived that it he was
[51:57] an angel of the Lord. Remember I said
[51:59] you didn't see it as an angel?
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; It took two times before Gideon
[52:04] perceived. Yeah.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; How many testimonies will it take before
[52:09] you perceive that God is in your midst?
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:19] &gt;&gt; He perceived that it was an angel of the
[52:21] Lord. And Gideon said, "Alas, oh Lord
[52:23] God, for because I have seen an angel of
[52:26] the Lord." Watch this.
[52:30] 22. You got that up. Face
[52:33] to face.
[52:37] I want to tell you something this
[52:38] morning. If you've been born again and
[52:41] you have the new birth, the Holy Ghost
[52:43] in your life, you not only have seen an
[52:46] angel face to face, you are actually
[52:49] packing an angel
[52:51] &gt;&gt; in your being
[52:52] &gt;&gt; called Jehovah Gyra.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; But it don't stop there. So the angel
[52:58] said, you know, the angel of the Lord
[52:59] came and said, "Now, you're not going to
[53:01] die, so do not fear." Do you notice, you
[53:03] know, we said last week that do not fear
[53:06] not is 365 times in the Bible because
[53:10] God knew that you would have to hear it
[53:11] every single day.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Hey, do you know that? You know that in
[53:20] Revelations he said, "I'm Alpha and
[53:22] Omega, the beginning and the end."
[53:26] &gt;&gt; There's no other but us. Yeah.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Think of all the amazing names that God
[53:33] is and you're fearing every day.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; And here God told Gideon to go out and
[53:47] tear down the altars to Baal. And you
[53:50] know, and we're just going to skip over
[53:52] that, but he did do that. But you know
[53:55] the Bible says that he took 10 men with
[53:57] him and he went at night because he was
[54:02] &gt;&gt; he was still afraid.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; After he had seen God consume his meal,
[54:09] seen him face to face. Perceived he'd
[54:12] seen him face to face.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Sound familiar?
[54:18] &gt;&gt; You were wondering how you were going to
[54:19] get through next month.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; Gideon
[54:25] And then if we jump to verse 3, 36 here.
[54:28] And Gideon said unto the Lord, he said,
[54:30] "If you will save Israel
[54:34] as thou has said, what you know what the
[54:36] devil said? If thou be the son of God,
[54:40] &gt;&gt; call these stones to become bread."
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Gideon was a mighty man of valor by
[54:48] God's testimony, but he could not
[54:50] believe it. Yeah,
[54:53] &gt;&gt; you are sons and daughters of God. Thus
[54:56] saith the word of God
[55:00] &gt;&gt; and you're struggling
[55:02] &gt;&gt; to grasp that.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Why?
[55:06] &gt;&gt; God said it. I believe it. That settles
[55:08] it for me.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:14] He said, 'If.
[55:16] The devil said, 'If, Jesus, you're God.
[55:21] Just jump off these buildings and he'll
[55:22] raise you up. If If
[55:26] you know in your journey
[55:30] being a Christian, you have to get past
[55:33] the gift.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; You say, "I am."
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Period. Amen.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; You know, possess, you know, you know
[55:42] what the Bible says as the testimony,
[55:47] their their confession was their
[55:48] testimony.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; You're saved by the word of your
[55:52] testimony.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; God don't like silent believers.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; He likes the ones that go, "Woo!"
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; He did something for me.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And here Gideon don't remember
[56:12] he had seen him face to face.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; And Katon said, he said on verse 37, he
[56:25] said, "Behold, I'll put fleece of wool
[56:27] on the floor and put dew on the fleece
[56:30] only." You know, about that time I would
[56:32] have lost. If that would have been my
[56:34] kid, I would have like I would have
[56:36] found the rod, I think. I I mean, or or
[56:38] switch or something. I mean, like two
[56:41] strikes and you're out. But I I guess
[56:44] we're not playing two pitch. But but
[56:47] like it, you know, if this is really
[56:49] you, after I've seen you, after you
[56:51] consume my food,
[56:53] oh boy.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:00] Amen.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; And God did it.
[57:05] In verse 38, and it was so.
[57:09] We serve an amazing patient God.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Now, that that was that was object
[57:15] number like vindication number three or
[57:19] number two depending on how you cuz
[57:21] first he came first the angel came when
[57:23] he was thrashing wheat in the wine press
[57:25] and then he came and consumed the meal
[57:27] and talked to him. He said, "I
[57:29] perceive." Now he's starting to catch on
[57:31] that.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; So, this is like two or three. So, now
[57:37] we can move to verse 39.
[57:40] And he just wasn't there. Some there's
[57:43] something he he was pretty much he
[57:46] almost Elliot he like after one or you
[57:49] know two or three times you know
[57:52] he's like it's probably true but just to
[57:56] be sure. Oh.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Just to be absolutely positive.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Gideon said, "God,
[58:10] don't be mad at me."
[58:17] But God,
[58:21] you know, Gideon might as well said, "I
[58:23] don't believe
[58:26] that." Actually, every time he was
[58:28] asking for a sign,
[58:30] &gt;&gt; he was saying, "I don't believe."
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; You know, the Bible says, "More blessed
[58:34] is them that have believed, have not
[58:36] seen, and still believe."
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Now, I love signs, but I've had dozens
[58:42] of them. I was filling my iPad with
[58:45] testimonies. You know, you know a lot of
[58:48] them here.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; And Gideon said unto God, he said, "Let
[58:59] not thy anger be hot against me." I That
[59:03] would have been about it. You know, let
[59:05] let me just show you how we operate. you
[59:07] know, uh uh this week, you know, let's
[59:11] bring I'm bringing it down to like where
[59:13] the rubber hits the road. The the
[59:15] greenhouse called us and they said, "We
[59:17] want to bring your tree to the church.
[59:19] That tree is to stop the sun so we can
[59:21] video and so we're not blinded in
[59:24] April."
[59:27] And my wife's anger was kindled.
[59:31] I was in the car with her.
[59:34] I know when it's kindled. I could see
[59:37] the signs.
[59:40] She said, "It's going to die.
[59:43] It's too cold.
[59:46] It's going to die."
[59:48] And I said, "Honey,
[59:50] honey, honey, just call them. Just ask
[59:53] them. Say, don't let your anger be
[59:55] kindled with me. But if the plant dies,
[59:59] will you do another miracle
[1:00:01] and bring another plant?
[1:00:09] He said it just to prove let it let it
[1:00:12] let it me prove that y'all speak to me.
[1:00:19] Now I'm going to tell you something. I
[1:00:21] believe that you need to know that
[1:00:24] you're packing Jehovah Gyra. I believe
[1:00:27] you need to know that you've been born
[1:00:29] again. And not only that, I believe you
[1:00:31] need to know that he's accepted your
[1:00:34] sacrifice and you're filled with the
[1:00:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; But once you know,
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; you don't you you got to have six signs
[1:00:43] every week.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Father,
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; I mean, he will do them. He will do
[1:00:51] them, but you won't recognize them.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He will provide your needs or you
[1:00:56] know he he will do something
[1:00:57] supernatural and you say, "Oh, wow. That
[1:00:59] was a close call. The barn almost burned
[1:01:02] down." No, that wasn't a close call.
[1:01:04] That was God. That was an angel.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'll put fleece out this
[1:01:11] time on the ground, but last time you
[1:01:13] put it on the fleece,
[1:01:16] so just in case you're not God, this
[1:01:18] time put it on the ground."
[1:01:22] And God's up in heaven going, "Oh,
[1:01:27] wow. Wow. Wow. Wow."
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; And in verse 40,
[1:01:34] and it was so.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:41] And here, so now we see that God had
[1:01:43] promised Gideon to take over the the the
[1:01:46] Minionites and and so they were coming
[1:01:48] up into army. And so after all these
[1:01:51] signs,
[1:01:52] Gideon could now recognize that God was
[1:01:55] in their midst. But he brought all these
[1:01:57] people,
[1:01:58] thousands of them, to fight the menites.
[1:02:01] God, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[1:02:03] whoa, whoa, whoa. I never called all
[1:02:06] these people.
[1:02:10] In Judges 7
[1:02:15] and verse two, and the Lord said unto
[1:02:17] Gideon, "The people that are with you
[1:02:19] are too many,
[1:02:22] lest you think that you did it on your
[1:02:25] own."
[1:02:28] And by this time, Gideon was convinced.
[1:02:34] And so, you know, we've been preaching
[1:02:36] on fear for for a long time. Too long,
[1:02:38] but maybe. uh two or 3 weeks. But if you
[1:02:41] go to verse three, and so God's telling,
[1:02:44] he said, "Let all the people, you got to
[1:02:47] get rid of all these people cuz I'm
[1:02:49] going to deliver them into your hands.
[1:02:52] Get rid of all these people."
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; So he said, "Just put it out to the
[1:02:56] people." Now watch this. I I just want
[1:02:58] to show you this. This was churchgoing
[1:03:01] regular every Sunday. Israelites.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:07] And it said, "All the ones that are
[1:03:09] fearful, go home." And they all left.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Almost all left.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let
[1:03:23] them return and depart early. And these
[1:03:25] that return were 22,000.
[1:03:31] Thousand. Yeah. They just about all
[1:03:33] left.
[1:03:35] How do you serve God and be fearful?
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; That's what God's trying to show us.
[1:03:39] Just trust me.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; Everything will be okay. If you know the
[1:03:44] the the disciples came to stop the the
[1:03:46] people that were casting out demons in
[1:03:48] Jesus' name. They said, "Bless God, they
[1:03:50] don't come to my church or they don't go
[1:03:51] to my seminary or and he said, "Whoa,
[1:03:54] whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. If they're on
[1:03:56] our side,
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; leave it alone.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; you you're if God's in it,
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; it'll be great. You don't want to be
[1:04:04] fighting against it. And if God ain't,
[1:04:07] it'll just fall down anyway.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; He don't need you to let it fall down.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz unless God builds the house, it'll
[1:04:14] fall down.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't have to go around saying,
[1:04:17] "Well, oh, I don't think." No. Let God
[1:04:20] do it. If God's in somebody's heart,
[1:04:23] that's between them and God.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; That house will be strong, a strong
[1:04:28] foundation. And if it's not, when it
[1:04:31] rains, it'll fall. I knew
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; 22,000 left because of fear.
[1:04:37] And the Lord came to Gideon again. He
[1:04:39] said, "You still got too many."
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; Amazing. God never Gideon never asked
[1:04:46] him for another sign.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; He was convinced by now.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; And they went to the water. And you know
[1:04:53] the story, all the ones that didn't all
[1:04:55] the ones that didn't lap like a dog,
[1:04:57] kneel down. He said, "Send them home."
[1:05:01] He said, "I want the ones that scoop the
[1:05:02] water up in their hand and drink out of
[1:05:05] their hand."
[1:05:07] Amen.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; And he took 300 men
[1:05:12] out of thousands and tens of thousands.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; And destroyed the enemy.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; And so God used Gideon mightily.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; So I want to tell you this morning, if
[1:05:26] you're Gideon,
[1:05:27] God can still use you.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:05:34] But I want to get
[1:05:37] to be more than Gideon.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; I want to be get to the point that I
[1:05:44] don't have to tire your God and ask God,
[1:05:47] "Now, don't let your wrath be kindled
[1:05:48] hot against me because I'm not sure
[1:05:51] you're God."
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; I just want to say, "I believe."
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; And there's a way that you can be that
[1:05:59] way.
[1:06:01] When he really becomes your Jehovah
[1:06:03] Gyra,
[1:06:04] when he really becomes everything to
[1:06:07] you,
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; when all you can think about is going
[1:06:10] home,
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; you know, when you're away from home in
[1:06:14] the natural, all you can think of is the
[1:06:18] good times you had when you were at
[1:06:19] home.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; That's me.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; See, I left heaven.
[1:06:29] Yeah,
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; I left the splendor of heaven because in
[1:06:32] Genesis 1:26 and 27, God said, "Let us
[1:06:36] make man in our image." And I came out
[1:06:38] of the presence of God. And he said,
[1:06:39] "I'll send you to earth to prove to
[1:06:41] Satan that there will be a people
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; that will not fall down in this age."
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; And so all I can think of is my home
[1:06:52] memories
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; being around my heavenly father.
[1:06:58] And so here we see the story of David.
[1:07:01] And David was just obeying his dad and
[1:07:03] and his dad sent him to pack a lunch to
[1:07:05] Israel.
[1:07:08] And David's faith was so dynamic as a
[1:07:12] boy. You know, it's no wonder, you know,
[1:07:14] if we were going to have great prayer in
[1:07:15] the church, have the kids pray for you
[1:07:18] cuz they don't know God can fail yet.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; They just believe him. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; See, you know, when you tell your kids
[1:07:29] that supper's at 6:00, they just believe
[1:07:31] that you're going to have supper. They
[1:07:32] don't doubt it.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; And he heard a big champion
[1:07:41] of Satan, Goliath, talking
[1:07:46] and he seen all the children of Israel
[1:07:49] flee from him in verse 24.
[1:07:51] And David said, "What are you running
[1:07:54] away? Who's this devil that's bringing
[1:07:57] reproach on the children of God?
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I you know you know the
[1:08:06] story so well. I'm going to just go
[1:08:08] through it fast. But in verse 28, David
[1:08:12] had some obstacles to go through. It was
[1:08:15] the people around him. His brother, his
[1:08:18] eldest brother said, well, his anger was
[1:08:20] kindled against David. He said, "Thou
[1:08:23] camest down hither,
[1:08:26] and where's your little sheep in the
[1:08:28] wilderness?" And he said, "I know that
[1:08:31] you're proud and naughty in your heart."
[1:08:34] Watch that. This is unbelievable. His
[1:08:37] brother thought because he was he
[1:08:39] believed God was God that he was proud
[1:08:41] and naughty.
[1:08:44] Wow.
[1:08:49] and thou art come down to see this
[1:08:51] battle. And David said, "What have I
[1:08:54] done?
[1:08:56] I just believe that God said that he
[1:08:58] would deliver us."
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Did I do something wrong?
[1:09:03] I was just trying to save souls for his
[1:09:05] kingdom.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:12] And you know when David went out to meet
[1:09:15] Goliath,
[1:09:17] Satan, when you go out to meet Satan, he
[1:09:19] will always mock you.
[1:09:25] He mocked Jesus.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; He mocked the prophets in the Bible.
[1:09:32] They killed them, persecuted them. But
[1:09:35] they knew all along
[1:09:39] who he really was.
[1:09:40] Yes.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; When Jesus showed up and the devils were
[1:09:43] there and the people, they said, "Why
[1:09:45] have you come before our time
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; to torment us?"
[1:09:51] And so, Satan will always bluff.
[1:09:57] But it's not you coming before Satan,
[1:10:00] it's the God in you.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; And watch here in verse 45. And David
[1:10:06] said, then said David to the
[1:10:09] Philistines, he said, "Thou comest to me
[1:10:11] with a sword and a spear and with a
[1:10:15] shield, but I cometh to thee
[1:10:18] in the name of the Lord
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; of hosts."
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; David knew exactly where he was
[1:10:24] standing. I want to show you something.
[1:10:26] The difference between Gideon and David.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Where was the sign?
[1:10:36] That's right.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; He wasn't looking for it.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; He was just taking a lunch to his
[1:10:41] brothers.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; But he couldn't help himself
[1:10:47] from defending the God that he knew he
[1:10:49] was.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; See, in the presence of a real believer,
[1:10:55] you couldn't mock God
[1:10:58] because because the God would show
[1:11:01] himself.
[1:11:05] Like when Jesus stood before the king
[1:11:08] and he was astounded that Jesus didn't
[1:11:10] answer him and he said, "Don't thou
[1:11:13] knowest that I have the power to take
[1:11:16] your life or not?"
[1:11:19] And Jesus said, "You don't have no power
[1:11:22] at all
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; unless my father which is in heaven give
[1:11:26] it to you."
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; He knew exactly where he was.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. standing.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; So did David. David didn't go out there
[1:11:37] because he was naughty and proud and he
[1:11:40] thought that a little squirt was going
[1:11:41] to take over a trained soldier, a
[1:11:44] military man. But he had met the pillar
[1:11:48] of fire.
[1:11:50] He had met the pillar of fire when he
[1:11:52] was taking care of sheep
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; in the wilderness.
[1:11:57] Just like Moses when he ran from Egypt
[1:12:01] because he hadn't met the pillar of fire
[1:12:02] yet. He'd heard about him. A lot of
[1:12:04] people have heard about him but they
[1:12:06] haven't met him. And he ran for his life
[1:12:08] and he was a trained soldier. But when
[1:12:11] the burning bush happened and it and God
[1:12:13] spoke out of the bush and said, "Take
[1:12:14] off your shoes. You're getting the
[1:12:16] ground dirty."
[1:12:19] And God spoke to him out of the bush and
[1:12:20] said, "I have come down to set my people
[1:12:23] free." Moses laid down all his weapons
[1:12:26] and took a stop and they said, "Where
[1:12:28] you going, Moses?" I'm saying, "I'm
[1:12:29] going to take over."
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it wasn't Moses,
[1:12:35] it was the God that was in Moses.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. When see, when you actually meet
[1:12:43] somebody face to face,
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; you have your own testimony.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as much as we love and and
[1:12:51] they testimonies edify the body and they
[1:12:54] should be, I mean, I I want to hear your
[1:12:57] testimonies,
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; but you need your own.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; If you're just listening to my
[1:13:05] testimonies or others testimonies and
[1:13:09] you can't find nothing
[1:13:14] to testify of,
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:13:19] You need to you need to search and look
[1:13:21] deeper. You need to say, "Lord, take the
[1:13:24] scales off my eyes." Like the prophet
[1:13:27] when the chariots of fire were around
[1:13:28] and his servant was there and he said,
[1:13:30] "We're going to be destroyed." And he
[1:13:31] said, "Oh, God, help that poor little
[1:13:33] boy." And the scales fell off his eyes
[1:13:35] and the mountains were filled with
[1:13:37] chariots of fire. I say, "God, help our
[1:13:40] eyes. Help the scale eyes." We've we've
[1:13:43] been around this world so long that we
[1:13:45] think that we think that this world's
[1:13:47] falling apart and it's already fell
[1:13:48] apart. But there's a God that's
[1:13:50] perfectly in control.
[1:13:54] You know, I love Job's example because
[1:13:56] when when Satan came before the presence
[1:13:58] of God, he said, "You can go this far."
[1:14:02] Do you know that same Jehovah Gyra is on
[1:14:05] the throne this morning? And it don't
[1:14:07] matter who is the leader in who country
[1:14:10] and whose country and who's got a
[1:14:11] submarine and who's got a tanker. He
[1:14:14] said you can go this far today.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; I'll let you know tomorrow where you can
[1:14:20] go.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Cuz he controls all the things. Amen.
[1:14:24] And we can watch the news and be so
[1:14:27] bewildered because of all that's going
[1:14:29] on.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Don't
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Don't watch too much. No,
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; the only news
[1:14:39] I I God's going to tell you something.
[1:14:41] The only news you need to watch is for
[1:14:44] the time piece of how soon it is that
[1:14:46] we're going home.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; That's the only news.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; The rest is just be in be in him. Be in
[1:14:57] the word.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Build an atmosphere. Have music playing.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Listen to your Bible. Read your Bible.
[1:15:04] Do your devotion. Study the Bible.
[1:15:07] Be in Christ.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; He's the boss.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Don't matter what the kids do. Don't
[1:15:14] matter what these puppets do in here.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; They're all controlled by one great
[1:15:18] power.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; That's the one I got confidence in.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:26] And we see, and I want to close on this,
[1:15:28] in Genesis 22.
[1:15:35] Amen.
[1:15:37] I'm just seeing where we're at here.
[1:15:41] Genesis 22:1. I want to read this. You
[1:15:44] know, you wonder, why don't I see God
[1:15:49] like I've heard about in history?
[1:15:53] I'll answer it right here in this verse.
[1:15:54] And it came to pass after these things
[1:15:57] that God, this is what that God
[1:16:07] can hardly say.
[1:16:10] Did tempt Abraham.
[1:16:16] If God could tempt Father Abraham, whose
[1:16:19] spiritual seed you are, do you ever
[1:16:21] think God could tempt you?
[1:16:26] And he could be holding back his
[1:16:27] presence just long enough to see, I
[1:16:30] wonder if they'll really serve me.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; And here here here's God temp how's God
[1:16:39] do that?
[1:16:41] God was tempting Abraham to see
[1:16:45] if you believe that I'm God.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; God tempted Abraham and said unto
[1:16:51] him,"Abraham, Abraham, here am I." And
[1:16:54] he said, "Behold, here am I." And he
[1:16:57] said, "Take thy son, thine only son,
[1:16:59] Isaac, whom thou lovest,
[1:17:03] and get thee to the land,
[1:17:06] and offer him up as a sacrifice for me.
[1:17:12] And I've preached this before. I want to
[1:17:13] tell you something.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; I couldn't have done her.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Do you know Abraham
[1:17:30] never asked for a sign?
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; That that's like that's that to me
[1:17:37] that's just like unbelievable. Do you
[1:17:39] know God? Abraham never asked God, "How
[1:17:42] do I know this is you, God?" And Abraham
[1:17:44] did something else that's even this is
[1:17:46] much unbelievable.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; He never told his wife.
[1:18:07] I'm not saying you shouldn't tell your
[1:18:08] wife. I think you should.
[1:18:12] But Abraham
[1:18:15] never told his wife.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; I'm like, whoa.
[1:18:22] Wow.
[1:18:23] Amen.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Abraham knew
[1:18:27] God.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; He had to know God because we know that
[1:18:34] when God stopped him from sacrificing
[1:18:36] his son and God said, "Now I know I know
[1:18:40] that you really love me and God stopped
[1:18:43] his arm." God provided a sacrifice was a
[1:18:46] lamb in the bushes. It wasn't there
[1:18:48] before.
[1:18:50] You know, if you read the Bible and you
[1:18:52] watch about that now, you can read this
[1:18:54] in yourself in your Bible and you study
[1:18:56] this next week and you come back, you
[1:18:58] tell me, you're telling me that Abraham
[1:19:00] and his son went up and they they
[1:19:03] scoured the area for stones
[1:19:06] to build the altar.
[1:19:08] Then they scoured the area for wood.
[1:19:11] This is a key point.
[1:19:14] And branches, that's what the sheep was
[1:19:16] caught in
[1:19:18] to put on the altar. And they never seen
[1:19:19] the lamb.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Gyra, I will provide myself
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; a sacrifice.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; When God needed a sacrifice, he just
[1:19:33] said, "Okay, lamb."
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Abraham needs something to worship me
[1:19:37] by.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; My God can do that.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. here. If we jump in Genesis 22,
[1:19:49] let's just go to 15
[1:19:52] and then I'm going to go to a New
[1:19:53] Testament scripture and we're going to
[1:19:54] close on that and we're going to do
[1:19:57] communion.
[1:19:59] But Genesis 15, he said, "And the angel
[1:20:02] of the Lord came to Abraham out of
[1:20:05] heaven the second time."
[1:20:08] Oh, I pray to God he'll come to us
[1:20:10] again.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Again and again and again. I don't want
[1:20:16] them just on Sunday. I want him on
[1:20:18] Monday.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; And I want him on Tuesday. And my God
[1:20:22] works on Wednesday, too.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; And he's there on Thursday.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord God, please. You know, he came
[1:20:31] and he said, and he said, "By myself I
[1:20:35] have sworn." Verse 16 sayaith the Lord,
[1:20:40] for because thou hast done this thing,
[1:20:43] and hast not withheld thy son, thine
[1:20:49] only son
[1:20:52] in blessings.
[1:20:55] I will bless thee and multiply. I will
[1:20:59] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[1:21:01] heaven, as the sands are which upon the
[1:21:05] seashores, and thy seed shall progress
[1:21:08] the gates
[1:21:11] of thine enemies.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; In thy seed shall all the nations of the
[1:21:19] earth be blessed.
[1:21:22] Remember what we said at the beginning?
[1:21:24] Satan believes in Jesus, but he didn't
[1:21:28] obey him.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Because thou has obeyed
[1:21:35] my voice.
[1:21:37] See, Abraham never asked it for a sign
[1:21:40] like Gideon. Even though God blessed
[1:21:42] Gideon and he had victory, but Gideon
[1:21:46] needed three signs, actually four from
[1:21:49] God to know that God was God. How many
[1:21:52] signs do you need?
[1:21:56] Will God send an angel to you like he
[1:21:58] did Gideon when he was thrashing the
[1:22:00] wheat in the wine press be enough?
[1:22:02] Wasn't for Gideon.
[1:22:04] He sent him the angel the second time
[1:22:06] when he burned up his dinner on the
[1:22:08] rock. And Gideon said, "I perceive I've
[1:22:11] seen an angel face to face." Wasn't
[1:22:13] enough for Gideon.
[1:22:15] And then when God called them out to
[1:22:16] fight the army of the m the the the army
[1:22:19] that they were coming against,
[1:22:22] he said, "Put the dew on the flax."
[1:22:27] And Gideon knew he knew he was pushing
[1:22:30] God
[1:22:32] to rebellion
[1:22:34] when he said, "Don't be angry and hot at
[1:22:36] me." But this time put the do only on
[1:22:38] the ground and not on the flax.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you something this
[1:22:43] morning, church.
[1:22:45] Brother Dale's been Gideon way too long.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be Gideon.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be Gideon.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Somebody asked me to do something for
[1:22:55] God. I'm just going to jump.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; I'll ask questions later.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Yep. Just jump. I'm not Gideon. I'm
[1:23:04] Abraham.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; I'm David.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; That Goliath. You don't look big to me.
[1:23:11] All right. It's just easier. I can't
[1:23:12] miss. It's impossible to miss
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; where where the stone hits him, he's
[1:23:17] coming down.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Do you know? You know, he didn't David
[1:23:20] didn't even need to take a sword because
[1:23:21] when he fell down, didn't matter where
[1:23:23] the stone hit him, David would have bent
[1:23:24] over.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; Hello. You thought it had to hit him in
[1:23:27] the head. It hit him in his intellects
[1:23:30] because Goliath thought he would beat
[1:23:31] God by his brains.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; That's the world we're living in. We
[1:23:34] think the more education we get, the
[1:23:36] closer we get to God.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; But God, David could have hit him in the
[1:23:40] stomach and he would have been over. And
[1:23:42] then David could have walked up to him
[1:23:43] and took his big old sheathing sword and
[1:23:45] just cut off his head and said,
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Abraham,
[1:23:58] God tempted Abraham.
[1:24:00] Do you believe that you're the son of
[1:24:03] God today? The Bible says you are. We
[1:24:06] read those scriptures. The Bible says
[1:24:08] that you're sitting in heavenly places.
[1:24:11] Do you need a sign to believe that?
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; I hope not.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; And blessings I'll bless thee because
[1:24:26] you've obeyed my voice
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; because you obeyed and just took for
[1:24:31] granted that I was the ultimate power
[1:24:35] which he is.
[1:24:38] You know, I want just just in closing
[1:24:41] here, I want to mention this. In Hebrews
[1:24:42] 6:3,
[1:24:44] it said, "For when God had promised to
[1:24:46] Abraham, because he could swear by no
[1:24:48] greater, he sweared by himself, saying,
[1:24:51] surely I will in blessings and I will
[1:24:54] bless thee and multiply, I will multiply
[1:24:56] thee." And so after he had patiently
[1:24:59] endured, he obtained the promise. Amen.
[1:25:03] If you patiently endure and you just
[1:25:05] accept God for all that he is, we want
[1:25:08] in this church, God's not in a box.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Whatever's in his word
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; is in this church.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Whatever God is is welcome here.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; No boxes allowed.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Just paper bags. So when you get
[1:25:30] blessed, you can just tear them open.
[1:25:32] Amen.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine when you walk into
[1:25:38] heaven? You know why the Bible talks
[1:25:40] about when you walk on those streets of
[1:25:42] gold that are like glass? You know why
[1:25:43] they don't have glass windows in heaven?
[1:25:45] Because they're all going to get broken
[1:25:47] out
[1:25:49] cuz the people are going to be so
[1:25:50] rejoicing and blessing and jumping and
[1:25:52] dancing. Hey, hey, watch. Watch this.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; What did David do when the word came
[1:25:59] back in the presence of Israel?
[1:26:02] Watch this. When you recognize that
[1:26:05] you're coming into the presence of
[1:26:07] Jehovah,
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; David lost complete control without his
[1:26:12] gown over him.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And his wife mocked him. And God
[1:26:17] immediately cursed her for life and
[1:26:20] never lifted the curse. Yeah.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; When you recognize you're coming into
[1:26:26] the fullness of the Godhead bodily,
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; you're not going to hold her together.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; You have to become
[1:26:45] you are becoming
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; a part of God. I I just got a question
[1:26:49] I'm leaving with you as I close and we
[1:26:51] go into communion.
[1:26:53] You know, Abraham later in his life sent
[1:26:57] his great servant to go get Rebecca for
[1:27:00] his son. Now, he didn't know it was
[1:27:01] Rebecca to get a wife for his son. And
[1:27:04] they type Isaac types Christ perfectly.
[1:27:07] And Rebecca types you.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; And I have one question I'm going to
[1:27:11] leave with you. How in the world could a
[1:27:15] man that Rebecca had never seen before
[1:27:17] in her life? They had no Facebook, no
[1:27:21] Tik Tok, internet, whatever all those
[1:27:23] things are, no WhatsApp, no sending
[1:27:26] pictures.
[1:27:27] They've done long past the fax mail.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Watch this. Rebecca was in her father's
[1:27:35] home
[1:27:37] and within
[1:27:39] eight hours, 10 hours, how did Rebecca
[1:27:42] say, "I
[1:27:45] will go.
[1:27:50] How did she say that?"
[1:27:53] A type of the bride of Christ in the
[1:27:56] Bible. You know, in Revelations
[1:27:58] says the bride says, "Come." says also
[1:28:02] that the wife has made herself
[1:28:06] ready.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; I'm going to answer your question for
[1:28:10] you and then we're going to close. You
[1:28:11] can come, honey.
[1:28:14] Rebecca was a blood relative
[1:28:17] to a man she had never seen.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; If you take that back to Genesis 1:26
[1:28:23] and 27,
[1:28:25] let us
[1:28:27] make man in the image of God.
[1:28:32] the spirit man. Amen.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; If you study that out in Genesis 24:15
[1:28:38] and Genesis 22:23,
[1:28:42] Rebecca was a great niece to Abraham.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Wow. God help us.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; God help us. I will go. I will obey. I
[1:28:58] will be I want to be a David. I want to
[1:29:00] be the three Hebrew children where where
[1:29:02] the three Hebrew we mentioned this last
[1:29:04] week, but I I just said I said I'm not
[1:29:07] even going to be careful.
[1:29:09] I'm just going to be radical. I'm not
[1:29:11] even going to be careful to answer you,
[1:29:13] King. We're not afraid of your firemen.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; We're not afraid of anything that you
[1:29:18] have
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; because we know our God can save us. And
[1:29:21] if he doesn't, it makes no difference to
[1:29:23] us at all. He's still our God.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; We're not We're not going to be careful.
[1:29:27] We I'm going to tell you something,
[1:29:28] church.
[1:29:29] You've been careful way too long.
[1:29:34] You're afraid of fend offending the
[1:29:36] pastor.
[1:29:38] You're afraid offending the person
[1:29:40] sitting on your pew. I got a better one
[1:29:42] for you. You're afraid offending
[1:29:44] yourself, your flesh.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Well, I can't look silly.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; That's what David's wife thought.
[1:29:58] Yeah.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; The silly part never crossed David's
[1:30:01] mind when he seen the tabernacle of
[1:30:04] Jehovah, the Holy of Holies, coming into
[1:30:06] his presence.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; This is more than I can contain.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:30:19] Wow.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to heaven.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:27] But I want to have heaven here
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; before I get there.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; I know for beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:30:37] that I've already tasted and seen that
[1:30:40] the Lord is good.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, he loves you this morning.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; He's just losing his mind
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; to have you believe in him.
[1:30:59] He's just losing his mind. You just
[1:31:01] think of a a young gentleman that would
[1:31:04] ask a beautiful lady to be his wife. She
[1:31:09] has to believe in him.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; And here's Jehovah Gyra
[1:31:17] asking you,
[1:31:21] "Do you believe in me?
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Will you trust me?" No matter who bombs
[1:31:26] who
[1:31:29] and who's in control
[1:31:32] because I
[1:31:34] am Alpha and Omega.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Revelations, that angel of Jehovah came
[1:31:39] down and he put his land foot on this
[1:31:42] land and said, "I'm the boss of all the
[1:31:45] countries of the world."
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; And then he reached over here and he set
[1:31:48] it on the oceans. He said, "I'm also the
[1:31:50] boss of the oceans also.
[1:31:54] Yeah.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; But how many will believe?
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. I believe.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; I believe.
[1:32:10] If you show me a sign, Lord God, I'll be
[1:32:12] really happy. But I still believe.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow. Amen. We want to change the
[1:32:21] order of the service.
[1:32:24] And we normally have communion and
[1:32:26] footwashing twice a year. And we
[1:32:28] actually, for whatever reason, we never
[1:32:30] even had it last summer. And so we
[1:32:32] haven't had it since January. And then
[1:32:34] we had freezing rain and snow and and a
[1:32:37] lot of people were out. And so
[1:32:40] we're here we are into later in the
[1:32:43] year. And normally we would have this on
[1:32:46] a Sunday that's close to New Year. But
[1:32:49] if you'll forgive us, I tell you this
[1:32:52] before we read the communion scriptures
[1:32:53] that all that are trying their best and
[1:32:59] committed to serve God are welcome to
[1:33:02] participate.
[1:33:03] There's no pressure if you if you don't
[1:33:06] feel it's perfectly okay. You see,
[1:33:09] salvation is between you and God.
[1:33:14] And I would say this and the scriptures
[1:33:16] say it. We'll we'll read this. But you
[1:33:18] know, the most important thing about
[1:33:20] communion is is don't be a hypocrite.
[1:33:24] If you're not living a Christian life,
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; don't take it.
[1:33:31] Because communion is only a symbol that
[1:33:34] you're telling the rest of the people
[1:33:36] beside you, I'm a believer.
[1:33:39] And if they know my life on Monday and
[1:33:42] it testifies against me,
[1:33:45] the Bible says that's why many sleep and
[1:33:47] are sick among you.
[1:33:50] But other than that,
[1:33:53] you know, he said that if you wouldn't
[1:33:56] partake that he couldn't even have a
[1:33:59] relationship with you. So, it's kind of
[1:34:02] a serious it's a thing where we have to
[1:34:05] say, "Hey,
[1:34:07] I have li I have mountains of faults,
[1:34:12] but my desire
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; is to do serve God."
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:20] Amen. We're going to just read our
[1:34:22] Corinthians 1
[1:34:25] 11 and we have lots of fellowship and
[1:34:27] food after we have a meal after.
[1:34:30] We So what we do I just said before I I
[1:34:33] read this maybe 1 Corinthians
[1:34:36] 11 Vicki is normally if you can go to
[1:34:40] the outer side or go through the pews
[1:34:43] and we'll come by the table this way and
[1:34:45] you can go back to your seats and so
[1:34:48] we'll come by the Piano.
