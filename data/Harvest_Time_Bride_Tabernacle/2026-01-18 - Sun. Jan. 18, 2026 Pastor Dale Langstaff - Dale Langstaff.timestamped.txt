[17:16] that's said,
[17:19] everything that's done, Lord God. Not
[17:22] just the minister surrenders his body
[17:26] for you to speak through, but Lord God,
[17:28] I pray that the people will catch the
[17:31] revelation that they can surrender their
[17:33] own bodies and worship and
[17:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus.

[22:45] Wow.
[22:58] This position,
[23:02] God bless you. You very We're just
[23:05] amazed how many are here on a snowy day.
[23:08] We were coming. My wife was helping me
[23:10] drive very very I needed it. Believe me,
[23:12] the roads were less. Sister Donna,
[23:15] you're in the right place probably
[23:17] because man, we were coming down 80
[23:20] highway and it was just straight ice.
[23:22] And then we came on 21 up here, you
[23:24] know, by the public school. And I
[23:26] thought, woo, the snow plows all got
[23:27] flat tires. It's like, w going way too
[23:31] fast. We we're thrilled you're here, but
[23:34] we wouldn't want anybody to be heart
[23:37] coming or sac, you know, be nervous
[23:40] about coming. And so we understand it's
[23:43] winter time. Amen.
[23:45] Amen. Just uh one quick announcement.
[23:47] I'm going to send out a an announcement
[23:50] more of a in detail uh on our church
[23:52] text this week. And so if you just watch
[23:55] our church text, just a kind of a
[23:58] thought we're going to change for this
[24:00] year.
[24:02] And uh uh so uh you just watch us this
[24:05] week and maybe I'll send out some things
[24:07] the prophet said and just uh different
[24:10] things. But uh uh I want to really this
[24:14] year I want to really concentrate on
[24:17] well brother Browns let me let me let me
[24:19] I can't I wasn't going to share this but
[24:23] we want to have our mission field at
[24:26] home first
[24:28] &gt;&gt; before we spread it abroad. Amen.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; If you can't witness to the neighbor
[24:32] next door, then don't go to mission trip
[24:35] &gt;&gt; cuz those devils will eat you up and
[24:37] spit you out.
[24:39] &gt;&gt; They're waiting for you.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; And there's many, many great needs right
[24:45] here in our midst. Unbelievable.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Needs you have no idea about.
[24:54] Do you know there was people that went
[24:55] to our camp that were homeless this
[24:59] year?
[25:08] &gt;&gt; It just about took my breath away when I
[25:10] found that homeless.
[25:12] Hello.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; And they sat in our camp meeting August
[25:17] 1st. Did you know that?
[25:19] &gt;&gt; I didn't either.
[25:25] Wow. God help us.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. We are we are today.
[25:30] You are Christ in flesh. Amen.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; And we need to we need to recognize that
[25:36] the only Jesus the world will see.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Is in you.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; You are Mrs. Jesus Christ. And the
[25:45] Bible's full of that.
[25:46] If you got a Bible question, I can give
[25:48] you dozens of Bible answers because God
[25:51] makes no mistake. It's not I make lots
[25:53] of them, loads of them. You know, you
[25:56] know, sometimes we come, you know, I
[25:57] believe in a pastor being, you know, a
[26:00] clean man and that, but you know, it was
[26:02] the word of God that the spirit fell on.
[26:05] You know, when the Bible says when Peter
[26:07] Peter yet spake these words, the Holy
[26:10] Ghost fell on him.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Didn't matter who it was speaking them.
[26:13] Yeah.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; God spoke through a donkey to the
[26:15] prophet, he would have killed the do the
[26:17] prophet,
[26:19] &gt;&gt; if he wouldn't have finally heard the
[26:20] donkey,
[26:22] &gt;&gt; sir,
[26:23] &gt;&gt; it's the word of God that matters.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; And the spirit on the word of God.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it's alive.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; It's alive. It's alive in me. And and I
[26:34] know it's alive in many of you.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; And if it ain't, I pray it is today
[26:39] after today.
[26:40] My title is when you see Christ Jesus
[26:44] face to face. Let's turn Deuteronomy
[26:46] 316.
[26:49] Deuteronomy 31:6.
[26:51] And uh we want to deal with something
[26:53] just just I just want to encourage you
[26:56] and encourage you and encourage you. And
[26:58] I I hope you'll encourage me that that
[27:01] God's in control.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; The world hasn't the world isn't just
[27:04] falling apart. It's already fell apart.
[27:07] It's been falling apart for many, many
[27:08] years. probably since at least the World
[27:10] War II or well since Christ left it's
[27:13] been falling apart. But but it really
[27:15] started after the Second World War.
[27:19] But God
[27:21] &gt;&gt; is nothing is done except he permits it
[27:24] for his perfect not permissible but his
[27:27] perfect will.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:32] Amen. Hey Deuteronomy 31:6. Be strong
[27:36] and it be of good courage and fear not.
[27:40] Be not afraid of them. For the Lord thy
[27:44] God, he is he that doth go with thee,
[27:47] and he will not fail thee, nor forsake
[27:51] thee. Now, that that is a pretty
[27:53] powerful verse. You know, I when you're
[27:55] still I want to read another one.
[27:56] Philippians 4:13, but I want to read the
[27:59] scripture. You know, be strong and
[28:00] courageous.
[28:02] Fear not,
[28:04] nor be afraid. For the Lord thy God,
[28:07] it's he that's with you.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that he will not just be
[28:11] with you, but he would be inside you.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; He can't fail you.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; And nor will he forsake you.
[28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe I'll read this other verse
[28:24] and I'll share a testimony. Amen.
[28:26] Philippians 4 13. I can do all things
[28:30] through Christ. Yes,
[28:32] &gt;&gt; that strengthens me. Lord God, I just
[28:34] pray that you'll bless your people.
[28:36] Bless your word, but make it alive, Lord
[28:39] God. Make the letter kill, but the
[28:41] spirit give us life. May it just rebound
[28:44] off the pages
[28:47] in our lives. Lord God, we pray in Jesus
[28:49] name. Bless your wonderful saints this
[28:52] morning. Amen. Amen. You may have your
[28:55] seats. God bless you. And those of you
[28:57] that drove very far.
[29:00] Wow. Brother, God bless you, brother
[29:04] Matt. You had every right to
[29:07] reconsider. But Amen. I know you love
[29:10] God. Amen. And and uh God bless you. You
[29:13] know, you know, Brother Bam, he gave an
[29:16] example of a a a Tesian well and it was
[29:18] bubbling up and and somebody came to the
[29:20] well and he said, you know, why are you
[29:22] so bubbly? Why are you so happy? And he
[29:24] and he said, you know, maybe it's cuz
[29:26] the deer come and drink by you and or
[29:28] the bunny rabbits or the the beautiful
[29:30] garden of Eden that's around you and the
[29:32] trees and everything else and and the
[29:34] and the well, if you could talk to the
[29:36] well would keep telling you, "No, no,
[29:38] you know, we enjoy the wild life and it
[29:40] was clean, but it was fresh, just anian
[29:42] well, fresh, alive."
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Men
[29:48] Men can't cap them.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; If they cap this one, it'll just pop up
[29:53] here. It'll pop up there.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; You can't cap You can't You can't cap
[29:58] God.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; You can do all you can to try to cap
[30:00] God. You know, you can put a sidewalk
[30:02] over the grass and it'll grow out the
[30:04] sides twice as thick.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; Now, well said. No, no, no, no, no.
[30:08] You're missing. It's not anything that's
[30:09] around you. Although I'm really happy
[30:11] you're here, but it's something down
[30:13] inside me.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; I'm just bubbling from way down inside
[30:17] me.
[30:19] &gt;&gt; It just bubbles. How does it bubble?
[30:22] Yeah, I
[30:23] &gt;&gt; it just bubbles.
[30:25] That's how God is. Amen.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Be strong and very courageous. You know,
[30:30] we were getting the van fixed for Junior
[30:32] to come back this year. And uh you know,
[30:34] it didn't need nothing. And I was
[30:36] praising God that it didn't need brakes.
[30:38] And this is my short testimony. And it's
[30:41] been a real blessing because how many
[30:43] enjoy brother Junior when he comes here?
[30:44] You know, I sure do. And and uh if he
[30:47] didn't have wheels, he couldn't come
[30:48] most of the time because he he works the
[30:50] other side of Chadam. And we took the
[30:52] van in and and I knew that when I got in
[30:54] there, they said, "Oh, no. The brakes
[30:56] are good." You know, and it really
[30:57] needed nothing. Just little, you know,
[30:59] you know how vehicles are. Anybody get a
[31:01] vehicle repaired? Don't need nothing.
[31:03] Just the oil changed. And and we
[31:05] actually had somebody donate the tires.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Like it was just put the tires on the
[31:11] rims. Like we didn't buy tires,
[31:13] &gt;&gt; you know, but there was just a little
[31:15] rattle in the muffler and just couple
[31:17] little things. The fan didn't work if
[31:18] you stopped.
[31:20] And I was thinking in my head, you know,
[31:22] I I was born before the automobile.
[31:26] Certainly before computers. I remember
[31:28] when the first one came out in school.
[31:29] It was as big as this pulpit. And and uh
[31:33] I was thinking, you know, that'll be
[31:34] like 4 or 500 bucks. And so I walked in
[31:36] with the the church checkbook, you know,
[31:39] and she dropped the bill down and and
[31:41] and that was 775. And I thought, "Oh,
[31:43] that's a little bit more than I
[31:44] thought." I said, "This is what I make
[31:46] the check out for." She said, "Oh, no,
[31:47] no, no. Turn it over. That's just the
[31:48] labor.
[31:54] She said, "That'll be 1,700."
[31:57] And I come out to the van and just for a
[31:58] second I forgot who I was.
[32:02] I told the way I said, "Well, that kind
[32:03] of took care of."
[32:07] &gt;&gt; She said, "Uh uh, you know, God gives us
[32:10] ways for a reason." She said, "Stop.
[32:13] If God's sending you somewhere,
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[32:18] You know, I don't need that, man. I
[32:20] didn't fix it for me.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; If God wants us to go to Mexico, there
[32:24] goes my ticket to Mexico. Flying away in
[32:27] the man.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; But when we get to the spot
[32:32] &gt;&gt; where God's the boss.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; You know, you I want I want to show you
[32:37] something. And it's not to offend you,
[32:38] but everything I say here, I'm going to
[32:41] give you scriptures.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; The problem today is not a lack of
[32:46] power. God's power.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; It's not a lack of God's power because
[32:50] he's Hebrews 13:8 says he's the same
[32:52] yesterday, today, and forever.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; But it's a lack of your and my faith,
[32:58] &gt;&gt; in the God that we say we love.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Even the God that we say is in
[33:02] tabernacle in us,
[33:05] &gt;&gt; and that's unbelief.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; So, you know, God owns the cattle on a
[33:11] thousand hills, but I'm worried about a
[33:12] church van.
[33:16] That's hilarious.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; I confess him as Lord of our life, but
[33:21] you're worried about
[33:26] &gt;&gt; the problem today is not a lack of
[33:29] God's power.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; The problem isn't with God.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; No.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; The problem is with Brother Dale.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; It's with Brother Dale.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; And the problem is that I I'm still got
[33:42] a little bit of me still alive. And I
[33:45] think I'm helping God,
[33:48] &gt;&gt; but God don't need my help.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; I mean, he likes using my mouth,
[33:54] &gt;&gt; but other than that, he don't need my
[33:55] help. He don't need my brains. He just
[33:56] needs my mouth.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Cuz if it's my brain preaching to you
[34:00] this morning, you better run for your
[34:02] life.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; I'm a human.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Help us, Jesus.
[34:10] That's right.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; The proof of that is is in Romans 10:17.
[34:14] So then faith cometh by hearing
[34:18] &gt;&gt; and hearing,
[34:21] &gt;&gt; not by the minister,
[34:24] &gt;&gt; but by the word of God.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:29] &gt;&gt; So faith cometh by hearing
[34:31] &gt;&gt; and hearing by the word of God. It don't
[34:33] matter who's ministering God's word. If
[34:37] you have faith in the God in the word.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; I want to show you a couple people real
[34:45] quick and before we get into this
[34:47] meeting Christ face to face. There was
[34:49] many many examples in the Bible where
[34:52] people met Christ face to face and did a
[34:54] completely complete turnaround.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the this world, you know, I I
[35:01] if you if you think we have a problem in
[35:03] the church,
[35:05] I I want to just jump ahead of this. If
[35:07] you think we have a problem in this
[35:08] church, that same problem was here when
[35:10] Christ Jesus was on earth.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; And Matthew and Mark both and we'll come
[35:14] to it because I'm jumping ahead of my
[35:15] notes, but he said he it actually says
[35:18] in Mark,
[35:21] &gt;&gt; it gave me great. He said Jesus was
[35:24] amazed
[35:27] &gt;&gt; at their unbelief.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; I was sitting on the same pew as Jesus.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; It said he did miracles and things in
[35:38] front of them. It said like it said he
[35:40] but because of their unbelief he could
[35:42] do few miracles. And it literally says
[35:44] in Mark that he was amazed.
[35:48] I'm amazed that when I share the word of
[35:50] God to people like just right out
[35:55] &gt;&gt; and they walk away from it.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; It's not me.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; It's not me that God told the prophet,
[36:00] "They haven't rejected you, Israel.
[36:03] They've rejected me, the prophet. They
[36:04] wanted a king."
[36:07] &gt;&gt; My goodness. God, help us. Yes.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; So the the the word So the faith cometh
[36:12] by hearing
[36:15] &gt;&gt; and hearing by the word of God.
[36:19] &gt;&gt; So hearing is not just hearing
[36:22] &gt;&gt; because the people that left could hear.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Y
[36:26] &gt;&gt; but they couldn't comprehend.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; Help us, Father. The person that you
[36:32] witness to on the street that don't want
[36:34] to accept Jesus Christ, they heard you
[36:36] witness to him,
[36:38] &gt;&gt; but they turned down Jesus Christ
[36:39] because they couldn't comprehend
[36:42] &gt;&gt; what you were talking about.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; They couldn't understand what you were
[36:46] talking about.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Rahab the harlot in the walls of the
[36:52] city
[36:53] and Joshua 2 8-12. But I want to read
[36:56] this cuz she was one of these people
[36:57] that it it was a believer,
[37:00] &gt;&gt; an amazing believer. She said before she
[37:03] laid the spies down, Rahab, she come up
[37:05] to them on the roof. Now, now remember,
[37:08] I'm I'm just you you you that are
[37:10] regular in the church know me, but Rahab
[37:13] got eternal life because she lied twice.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Like that just like does brother Dale
[37:22] understand that? I've been working since
[37:24] my kids were born. Teach them not to
[37:26] lie.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; But
[37:33] &gt;&gt; can we explain God?
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Well,
[37:38] Rahab's an example, but here she laid
[37:40] the spies down and she said to the men,
[37:44] now I want I want to just share
[37:46] something with you. Those spies never
[37:49] preached to her.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:53] Yeah.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; She said, "I know that the Lord has
[37:58] given you the land
[38:01] &gt;&gt; and that tear
[38:04] had fallen upon us."
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Why don't tear fall on makeel believers?
[38:14] &gt;&gt; She was a harlot.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; She didn't know church order and
[38:18] doctrine.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; No.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; She didn't know church, period. Yeah.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; But she knew enough that terror had fell
[38:26] on them.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; And that all the inhabitants of the land
[38:30] has of the land is to faint
[38:35] &gt;&gt; because of you.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Remember the Bible where the the
[38:42] believers called Jesus beel the devil.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; But the devil said, "Why did you come
[38:47] before your time to cast me out?" The
[38:50] devil recognized the Lord,
[38:53] &gt;&gt; but the
[38:57] &gt;&gt; God have mercy on me.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; The so-called
[39:05] &gt;&gt; for we have heard. How did they hear?
[39:09] &gt;&gt; I know how they heard. I'll help you
[39:10] out. Instagram,
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Facebook, Messenger,
[39:16] it went on YouTube.
[39:23] We have heard how the Lord, how did you
[39:27] know the Lord? That the Lord had dried
[39:30] up the Red Sea and that you came out of
[39:32] Egypt and that you did to the what you
[39:34] did to the kings.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; And how you utterly destroyed them.
[39:40] Verse 11. And as soon as we heard these
[39:42] things,
[39:47] &gt;&gt; how many of your hearts are melting?
[39:48] this morning.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; She wasn't a believer.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; And her heart was melting.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; She wasn't even getting preached to.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; She wasn't here last Sunday. She had
[40:01] never sat in a church service and heard
[40:02] the word of God broke down.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; But her heart was melting.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; She said, "As soon as we heard these
[40:11] things,
[40:13] got to find where I'm at. Our hearts
[40:16] didn't melt and neither did there remain
[40:18] any courage in any man because of you
[40:23] for the because of you. Because of the
[40:26] Lord
[40:28] who's God.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Your God that was she wasn't afraid of
[40:33] them. It was the God that those men were
[40:35] packing.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; She was afraid of the God that they were
[40:40] packing. We're not afraid of this thing,
[40:41] but that that's the God the God you
[40:43] represent. Whoa.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; The God you represent has given me the
[40:48] nerves.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, from the Lord your God and he is the
[40:56] God of heaven above and the earth
[40:59] beneath. She see like who gave her that
[41:02] revelation?
[41:05] She wasn't concerned about the lad the
[41:08] you know who's the cold war and the
[41:10] biggest army and
[41:13] &gt;&gt; he said
[41:16] Rahab we're talking about Rahab we're
[41:18] not talking about like the last church
[41:20] age
[41:21] &gt;&gt; the last church age locked Jesus on the
[41:24] outside of the church the only church
[41:25] age in Revelation locked him on the
[41:27] outside
[41:29] says
[41:30] &gt;&gt; will you let me back in Yeah. Yeah.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; He's the God of heaven above
[41:38] &gt;&gt; and the earth beneath. And now
[41:40] therefore, I pray that you'll swear to
[41:42] me by your Lord, not by yourself, but by
[41:44] your Lord,
[41:46] &gt;&gt; that you'll show kindness unto me, and
[41:49] show kindness onto my house, and give me
[41:52] I hear just that last word.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; What did she want?
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Token.
[41:59] &gt;&gt; A true token. Amen.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; She didn't want religion. She wanted
[42:03] God.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; She wanted the boss.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; She went right to the throne.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; I recognize him.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; See, when you see Jesus face to face,
[42:13] there's another one in First Kings 10
[42:15] 1:3. This is just I'm just laying a
[42:17] foundation. There was actually people in
[42:19] the Bible that believed.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That was the Queen of Sheba.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there again that they had
[42:25] amazing Facebook and YouTube and and the
[42:28] the Instagram that was it was no
[42:30] government had shut it down on that day
[42:32] because she was across a desert
[42:35] that was loaded with pirates,
[42:38] bad men, no water, no air condition,
[42:43] no freeways.
[42:45] And the queen of Sheba heard the fame
[42:49] of the God of Solomon
[42:52] concerning the name of the Lord.
[42:57] And it didn't matter to her that it was
[42:58] on the other side of the desert. She
[43:00] came to prove him
[43:02] &gt;&gt; and to see if what she had heard
[43:05] &gt;&gt; was right.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; And when Solomon stepped in front of
[43:09] her,
[43:12] he told her all her life story. Amen.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; In a book.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; And she said, "There was not anything
[43:21] that was hid
[43:23] &gt;&gt; from God."
[43:26] &gt;&gt; The king was God.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Solomon.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; It wasn't Solomon.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; It was the king.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; God.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; So in this day, it's not We don't need
[43:40] more power. We don't even need more of
[43:43] God.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Can God get bigger?
[43:51] &gt;&gt; God's just God.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; He's the alpha and omega, the beginning
[43:55] and the end.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; The Sha. He's everything.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; What we don't need is more power. We
[44:02] just need more plain faith.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; We just need to believe.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just faith.
[44:12] The God is God
[44:14] &gt;&gt; and everybody answers to him. Do you
[44:17] know I I love Job. I I'm sorry I bring
[44:20] it up so often, but God said he said,
[44:22] "You can go this far."
[44:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:27] &gt;&gt; Do you know that God's telling the
[44:28] governments of the land, "You can go
[44:30] this far."
[44:32] &gt;&gt; That's far. You can't go no further.
[44:34] Touch not the oil and the wine.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; We're still here. Yeah,
[44:39] &gt;&gt; they can't they can't blow up this earth
[44:41] till brother Dale's gone.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Cuz God ain't leaving his bride here to
[44:46] go through a tribulation.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; No, he's taking her home for a
[44:51] honeymoon.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; That's the marriage supper of the lamb.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; And the millennium, a thousand year
[44:57] reign.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Can imagine the party.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:03] And here faith
[45:05] &gt;&gt; is what brings Christ on the scene.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; So he's here all the time.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; But if you need him, you have to
[45:15] believe.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by hearing
[45:22] &gt;&gt; and hearing by the word of God.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; See, faith is brought on the scene.
[45:27] Brings Christ on the scene. And so,
[45:29] watch this. You know, sometimes brother
[45:31] Dale's weak in his thing and and I know
[45:34] you're not there, but let me give you an
[45:35] example of brother Dale in the Bible.
[45:38] You know, you can come and you can pray,
[45:44] but if you don't believe, why are you
[45:46] praying?
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Think you might as well save your
[45:49] effort? Right.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; You know, you know when Moses was having
[45:54] trouble with belief, he came to Jesus
[45:57] when they came when the Egyptians came
[45:59] up behind him and Jesus said, "What are
[46:01] you talking to me for?"
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Just speak.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; The ocean's in your way.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:11] &gt;&gt; Just the Red Sea's in your way. Just
[46:13] speak
[46:14] &gt;&gt; and cross it. Haven't I given you power
[46:19] &gt;&gt; and authority? Do you know the Bible
[46:20] says that Moses was God
[46:23] &gt;&gt; to Pharaoh?
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; When he walked in his midst, the Bible
[46:27] says it.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; When Moses walked up, God showed up.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; And Pharaoh looked at Moses, he was
[46:32] looking at Jehovah.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:34] &gt;&gt; And anything
[46:37] Moses said,
[46:39] &gt;&gt; God backed up. Amen.
[46:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. I I show commercial break.
[46:46] They hadn't had the baptism of the Holy
[46:48] Ghost yet.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; They didn't have what you had.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; They were still using lambs and goats to
[46:57] sweep the sin under the rug.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; But we got a perfect sacrifice in Christ
[47:02] Jesus where he can't even remember it no
[47:04] more. Amen.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Father.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; And you're crying and sighing cuz you
[47:11] need a bill paid.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Just say, you know what? You know,
[47:15] brother, you know, you know, in your
[47:18] journey, you learn things off other
[47:19] people.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm just still in kindergarten
[47:24] spiritually, but I I'm just about to
[47:26] graduate to grade one.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, Brother Andre Andre
[47:30] Batit was here the one time and you know
[47:32] when he was in Haiti and they were
[47:34] missionary and and sending out books and
[47:36] he got a big bill for like $5,000 or
[47:38] something. He told her right here in
[47:39] this church and he had $5 in the bank
[47:41] account and he just went to bed and
[47:43] slept like a baby.
[47:51] You said, "God, that's not my bill."
[47:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; I'm not promoting my kingdom. No,
[47:58] &gt;&gt; I am not on Haiti
[48:00] &gt;&gt; for a holiday.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Say, God, you have a bill to pay.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Guess what? If you don't pay it, you'll
[48:07] have no more kingdom.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring,
[48:11] ring, ring, ring. Hello. Hello. You
[48:13] know, I woke up this morning.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; And I was having you on my mind. And God
[48:19] said, you know, I'm way behind. I should
[48:20] pay some. I'm going to send you 5,000
[48:23] bucks.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:26] That's right.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Well, God wanted to be in Haiti.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; That was just proof. God wanted to be in
[48:35] Haiti.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; You know, God still works that way.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; He sure does.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; But but we have to get in the spirit
[48:46] &gt;&gt; of Christ.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Let me show you example. Herod thought
[48:52] he was the boss. He was a superpower.
[48:55] He was sending nuclear subs and all this
[48:58] stuff over and he had captured the
[48:59] leader of a country, Peter.
[49:04] I'm dramatizing. Didn't Didn't Jesus
[49:07] give Peter the keys to the kingdom?
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; So, they had flew in this country and
[49:12] they sabotaged all the soldiers and they
[49:14] captured the leader of this kingdom
[49:16] &gt;&gt; and they threw them in the inner jail
[49:19] &gt;&gt; and put guards on both sides of them.
[49:22] Yeah.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Do you know Peter never prayed?
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Peter didn't have no problem with jail.
[49:28] The males were free.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; See, see, you know, you don't know this,
[49:34] but it wasn't Peter's kingdom.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; It was God's kingdom.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; But there was other people that were
[49:41] concerned for Peter. That was nice.
[49:44] Lord.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; And so they went and they, "Oh, God, my
[49:47] buddy Peter the P. Oh, the leader. Oh,
[49:49] the church is getting, "Oh, God." So
[49:53] Peter comes and
[49:55] the little girl runs out like Leo runs
[49:57] out and he says, "So I recognize his
[49:59] voice." She goes back and, "Oh, no, no,
[50:01] no, no. We prayed, but you seen a ghost.
[50:04] We prayed, but you know, God don't
[50:05] answer prayer today. This is This is You
[50:08] didn't know that it snowed. God don't
[50:09] answer prayer. We prayed, but we didn't
[50:12] expect because, you know, you're just a
[50:15] child. You don't know. You You're
[50:16] mistaken.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; And then Peter's, you know, it was cold
[50:21] outside, so he's still not
[50:23] Hello.
[50:30] Oh. Oh, God is alive.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; So, this ain't a new problem. No, no.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; This problem's been around the church
[50:39] since it started in Pentecost.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; They didn't realize that God was God.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; That's all in Acts 12 6 to 7 6-16.
[50:54] Amen.
[50:57] And now if you have the baptism of the
[50:59] Holy Ghost this morning, you have all
[51:02] the power of Christ that's in you.
[51:06] God give you his checkbook.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; All the promises in the Bible are to
[51:12] those that have confessed him as Lord of
[51:14] their life.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; There's hundreds, thousands.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; So, if you're packing the Holy Ghost
[51:22] this morning,
[51:24] &gt;&gt; you know, actually, I know it's, you
[51:27] know, this is it's hard for you to get,
[51:29] but you know, I'm going to show you. You
[51:31] know, uh, when you when you pray and you
[51:34] got the Holy Ghost, you know, it's all
[51:36] right. We look up to heaven, but but we
[51:38] but we got this. We have I'm changing
[51:41] God's changing your thing. God's just
[51:42] not in heaven.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; God's actually here, too.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Y,
[51:47] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at him.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; And so, who do I pray to when I come to
[51:56] prayer meeting?
[51:58] &gt;&gt; I pray to myself. Yeah,
[52:01] &gt;&gt; cuz it's God in me. The Bible says it's
[52:03] no longer I that liveth, but Christ that
[52:05] liveth in me.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; So I don't have to send like a telegram.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Do you know Do you know when the
[52:11] believer you know when Daniel prayed and
[52:13] Daniel and and the Lord never answered
[52:16] for 21 days, God sent the moment Daniel
[52:19] prayed,
[52:20] &gt;&gt; the moment Daniel prayed, God sent the
[52:22] angel.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Lucifer was there
[52:25] and it was a real war
[52:28] and he withtood the angel for 21 days.
[52:30] Now that angel was a little bit slow. He
[52:33] was still he was in pre kindergarten and
[52:36] it took him 21 days
[52:38] to call Christ.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:42] But when he called the Lord,
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; the angel showed up to Daniel and he
[52:48] said, "I was on my way 21 days ago, but
[52:50] it took me 21 days to realize that God
[52:53] could fight my battles."
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Took me 21 days to realize God could
[53:00] fight my battles. And the angel might
[53:03] not be able to conquer Satan, but
[53:05] there's one.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; There's one Lord.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Gyra.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He would have no problem
[53:13] conquering Satan.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; When he was on the scene, it was just
[53:16] like war hands and
[53:18] &gt;&gt; pick him up.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Oh, wow. It's just amazing.
[53:24] So, we see I'm and I'm not I'm not
[53:27] trying to be disrespectful. I'm trying
[53:28] to to bring you up to where God wants
[53:31] you to be.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; You're not hurting God.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the Holy Spirit
[53:41] &gt;&gt; that's living in you
[53:45] &gt;&gt; and you're like devaluating it
[53:49] &gt;&gt; father.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; It's worth more than gold. Gold top
[53:53] what? $4600
[53:55] an ounce or something.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Imagine the value of Jehovah.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; They ain't they they they can't figure
[54:03] that out with earthly calculators.
[54:06] So it's the Holy Ghost power in you,
[54:10] &gt;&gt; but it's governed or operates
[54:14] by your own or my own belief
[54:18] &gt;&gt; in God.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; Faith, it's governed. And if you limit
[54:23] your belief or faith,
[54:26] then it's just plain on belief.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Do you know that? You know, in in in
[54:31] James that it says that if you're guilty
[54:33] in part, you're guilty of the whole law.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; So, if you Oh, God help me.
[54:41] This it's really close. So, if you limit
[54:44] your God a little bit, you're guilty of
[54:46] the whole lot.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you insulted him that he might
[54:50] not be able to pay the God God can do a
[54:53] lot of things, Sister Margaret, but he
[54:54] couldn't deal with this hard problem I
[54:56] got.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Yeah. Yeah.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; So if you insult God and just well, you
[55:07] know, I'm everything's really good, but
[55:11] man, I got this thing that's
[55:14] &gt;&gt; You know what did the Lord tell Paul
[55:15] when he came back to him? He said, "My
[55:17] grace
[55:18] &gt;&gt; is sufficient for you."
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Mhm.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; So here here and I got I got to get to
[55:27] my first character, but here in Matthew
[55:29] 13 in Mark 6, but let me just read what
[55:32] Mark said. Jesus said unto them, he
[55:34] said, "A prophet is without honor in his
[55:36] own land
[55:38] and by his own country and among his own
[55:41] kin
[55:42] and his own house." So Jesus had the
[55:45] same problems as today. That's why, and
[55:48] no offense, you you are wonderful. But
[55:50] that's why when I travel, the people go
[55:53] wild.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; That's just Bible. I mean, you can't
[55:56] help it. I can't help it. That's just
[55:58] reality.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; And God said to and Jesus said that he
[56:06] could dare do no mighty works save that
[56:09] he laid hands on a few people. And you
[56:11] don't wonder why. Oh, there's a few
[56:13] little things happen in the church, but
[56:14] no blowouts.
[56:16] It's not God's problem.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; No.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; He said save. He laid hands on a few
[56:23] sick and a few were. That's not
[56:24] diminishing that he did that. Th this
[56:27] was Jehovah, by the way. This wasn't a
[56:29] minister. This was God in flesh.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; But verse six of Mark 6, and he said he
[56:37] marveled.
[56:47] at their unbelief.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; God,
[56:53] God God
[56:56] Christ Jesus
[56:58] even did some miracles in front of them.
[57:01] And God and God marveled.
[57:08] The people didn't recognize
[57:11] &gt;&gt; the presence in their midst.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Help me God.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; Help me Jesus.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; You know, that's why the Bible says, you
[57:33] know, if you were going to another land,
[57:35] do not even prepare what you would say.
[57:38] Don't take your wallet.
[57:40] Definitely don't take plastic. Don't
[57:42] take money or cares. Cuz see, if you're
[57:45] on a mission for him,
[57:48] &gt;&gt; he'll tell you what to say, when to say
[57:50] it.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; He'll give you food.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; He'll give you food.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; He'll give you food.
[58:07] He'll pay your bills for the van
[58:10] &gt;&gt; to have a minister come and preach in
[58:11] your midst.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Because it ain't the minister's bill.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; It's God's bill.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. Amen.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you a story.
[58:25] Me and my wife went somewhere Friday.
[58:27] Very few of you know where it was. For
[58:30] you that do uh forget.
[58:35] And we knew the situation was difficult.
[58:40] So we took
[58:44] some hamburger,
[58:46] some patties,
[58:48] took some yellow green beans that my
[58:51] wife was upset that I canned in the
[58:53] summertime. She put them in the jars
[58:55] though. But I kept buying it. They said
[58:57] they're half price. I just buy
[58:58] everything. And actually my wife got the
[59:01] revelation after. She said, "You know,
[59:02] maybe this winter there'll be people
[59:04] that we have to feed. And God knows in
[59:06] the summertime why I bought bushels,
[59:10] bushels
[59:12] with an S of yellow green beans."
[59:17] And we took a little box
[59:21] of muddy potatoes and sweet potatoes.
[59:26] We were there to eat supper.
[59:29] And the lady and the boy grabbed those
[59:32] potatoes in front of us and peeled them.
[59:34] And that's what we ate when we were
[59:36] there. What were they going to eat if I
[59:38] hadn't come?
[59:44] &gt;&gt; And the meat we ate had been given to
[59:46] them by another family member. And when
[59:49] I came home, I was hungry.
[59:58] Uh-huh.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; That's in this place.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; And they were at camp meeting.
[1:00:08] And they were at camp meeting.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; I was stunned.
[1:00:19] Stunned.
[1:00:27] Amen.
[1:00:29] She told us,
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; she said, "I had $4,000 in income last
[1:00:36] year."
[1:00:39] 4,000.
[1:00:41] She said, "And I have all my bills
[1:00:43] paid."
[1:00:46] So, I just have a little bit something
[1:00:48] here on my visa, and I think I got
[1:00:50] something coming in that's going to take
[1:00:52] care of that.
[1:00:56] Some people know that God's real.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Some people know that God's real.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; It's up to you.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; First John 3, behold what manner of love
[1:01:09] the father has bestowed unto us that we
[1:01:12] shall be called
[1:01:14] sons of God. Therefore, the world
[1:01:17] knoweth us not because it knew him not.
[1:01:20] So don't be surprised because you're not
[1:01:21] popular.
[1:01:22] Beloved, now now,
[1:01:26] right now,
[1:01:28] are we the sons of God? And it does not
[1:01:30] yet appear, but we know.
[1:01:34] All right. Now, can everybody see this?
[1:01:36] Do we got this up here, Vicki?
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; But we know that when God shall appear,
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; What's the next word say? That we
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; shall be him.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. that we shall be like him.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; You can't be like God if you're not a
[1:01:57] part of God.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; That's Genesis 1:26 and 27. And God
[1:02:02] said, "Let us make man in our image."
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; And we shall be like him because we came
[1:02:07] from Genesis 1:26 and 27. And let us
[1:02:10] make man in our image. And we shall be
[1:02:12] like him.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; For we shall see him
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; as he is. Amen.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Do you know how you see the flesh of
[1:02:22] God?
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; The flesh of God. God bless you, Sister
[1:02:26] Jesus. God bless you, Sister G. Oh,
[1:02:28] here. Oh, that's all right, Sister
[1:02:30] Jesus. I'll pick that pen up. God bless
[1:02:32] you, brother Jeff. Jesus.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Jesus. G. Brother
[1:02:35] G.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; you are now.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Not when you get to heaven. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; and you when he shall come
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; that's when you recognize him, you shall
[1:02:52] be like
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; like
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; like the same as
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; him.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:26.
[1:03:13] You can see me where I'm going, Vicki.
[1:03:16] Be not forgetful that you entertain
[1:03:19] strangers.
[1:03:21] See, you didn't realize it.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; For whereby the same have entertained
[1:03:27] angels.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thought that was just so
[1:03:37] angels.
[1:03:39] You didn't recognize the presence.
[1:03:42] And what do the angels do in heaven?
[1:03:44] Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God
[1:03:46] Almighty.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Amenise
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; angels unawares.
[1:03:52] Amen. Let your conversation be without
[1:03:55] covetishness. I want to stop there for a
[1:03:58] second and God's preaching to me this
[1:04:00] morning. Covetness. What is the meaning
[1:04:02] of covetousness?
[1:04:04] This is wrongful desire.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Help me God.
[1:04:11] especially
[1:04:13] towards wealth or possessions
[1:04:17] of others.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Let's go back to the scriptures. Let
[1:04:22] your conversation
[1:04:24] be without covetousliness.
[1:04:27] However you how you
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; covishness
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; covishness,
[1:04:31] forgive my English, but you can see it
[1:04:33] up there.
[1:04:35] And that word means a wrong wrongful
[1:04:37] desire
[1:04:39] especially
[1:04:41] in wealth or possessions of others
[1:04:43] leading to discontentment
[1:04:47] and sin. Now Google told me that
[1:04:52] Google told me it was sin.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Google told me that.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Be content. There's such things that you
[1:05:04] have. For he saith has said, I will
[1:05:08] never leave thee.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; I'll take care of every situation. I'll
[1:05:12] never leave thee, nor will I forsake
[1:05:14] thee. He's got everything in control.
[1:05:18] Exactly what I'll never leave thee, nor
[1:05:20] I'll forsake thee. So that you that we
[1:05:23] may be boldly safe.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Boldly, not childly say. boldly say that
[1:05:30] the Lord is taking care of this
[1:05:33] situation that I will not fear
[1:05:37] whatsoever a man can build me.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Let scripture alone you just forget
[1:05:45] watching the news. Who cares when war
[1:05:47] starts?
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not fearing.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; I ain't going to be here.
[1:05:54] Verse eight. Cuz Jesus Christ the same
[1:05:56] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:05:57] Philippians 4:13. And I got to get to my
[1:06:00] actual message. I'm not I haven't even
[1:06:02] hit my message yet. Philippians 4:13. I
[1:06:05] can do all things.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; I can do everything
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; through Christ.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; The strengthens me. Everything
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; How's this allow doubt to come in?
[1:06:26] The only way is is lack of belief
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; is unbelief.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; And and I promise I won't preach
[1:06:33] forever, but I I need to I'm still
[1:06:35] laying a foundations here in Romans 8.
[1:06:38] The best chapter you can ever read in
[1:06:40] your life.
[1:06:42] I'm sure
[1:06:44] is Romans 8.
[1:06:47] There's I mean there's some other
[1:06:48] Ephesians 1 is a good one, too. I love
[1:06:51] predestination and election, but watch
[1:06:54] this. this in Romans 8. Let's start at
[1:06:56] verse 26. Likewise, the spirit, this is
[1:07:00] talking about God.
[1:07:02] Likewise, the spirit of God also helpeth
[1:07:06] our infirmities.
[1:07:10] And we know not what we shall pray as we
[1:07:13] ought, but the Spirit make his
[1:07:16] intercession for us with groanings.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:22] that cannot be uttered.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Now watch this. Now this still this is
[1:07:28] still God. This is still God. This Amen.
[1:07:31] And God searches the hearts and knoweth
[1:07:35] what is the mind of the spirit because
[1:07:39] he maketh intercession for the saints
[1:07:42] to the will of God. Now I want to just
[1:07:45] tell you something. I would appreciate
[1:07:48] like you know one of the greatest
[1:07:50] thrills of my life people around that's
[1:07:53] there's a good thing about the internet
[1:07:55] people tell me so I I had people tell me
[1:07:57] on the I pray for you every day there's
[1:08:01] people sitting here so may I pray like
[1:08:03] it's hard for me to comprehend that I'm
[1:08:05] not sure I pray for myself every day
[1:08:08] every
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; day
[1:08:12] every day
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; but I want to show you something God.
[1:08:17] Yeah. You don't appreciate the prayers
[1:08:19] of the saints, but Jehovah
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; intercedes
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; for the saints. God, when God starts
[1:08:27] praying for you, look out.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; My God
[1:08:33] intercedes for the saints.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; For we know that all things work
[1:08:38] together for good to them that love God
[1:08:40] and to him that is called according to
[1:08:42] his purpose. So if you're a Christian,
[1:08:44] you're called because
[1:08:47] if you're a Christian, you're not your
[1:08:48] own.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; So it's a purpose of Christ.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; For whom he did forno, he did
[1:08:56] predestinate and conform to the image of
[1:08:58] his son. Remember how I said you were
[1:09:02] pardon?
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; And that he might be the firstborn of
[1:09:05] many brethren. Verse 30. Moreover, whom
[1:09:08] he did predestinate, he did call. And
[1:09:10] whom he called, he did also justify. in
[1:09:12] whom he justified, he also glorified.
[1:09:14] Verse 31. And what shall we say then
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; to these things?
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; I don't know if I'll make it.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Got an awful bad government right now.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; No, don't don't put that in there.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; It says, "But what shall we say then?
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; If God be before us,
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. But if God be before us, then it
[1:09:38] don't matter who wins
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; because God already won.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; If God be before us, then who can be
[1:09:45] against us? And what shall separate? He
[1:09:48] that spared not his son but delivered
[1:09:50] him up for us all. How shall he not then
[1:09:53] so freely give us
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; part of our needs.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; All things. Thank you.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; All things.
[1:10:05] Yeah.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Verse 31. Who shall lay anything
[1:10:11] to the charge
[1:10:14] of God's elect?
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Do you know the only person that can
[1:10:18] criticize you?
[1:10:20] Let's give a minister great hope.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; The devil.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; It's the only person. Who's the accuser
[1:10:29] of the brethren? Satan.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Satan.
[1:10:32] So if it comes out of somebody's mouth,
[1:10:37] they've yielded to the wrong spirit.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Who shall lay anything to the church of
[1:10:47] God's elect? It was God that justified
[1:10:51] me. It was God that called me. It was
[1:10:52] God that placed me. It was God that sent
[1:10:54] me. And I send all the bills directly
[1:10:56] right through to him. He just takes care
[1:10:58] of everything.
[1:11:03] You know, by next Sunday, my hair will
[1:11:05] probably be straight black by then.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Who is he that condemnth?
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; It is Christ that died rather raised
[1:11:17] again, even as at the right hand of God
[1:11:19] also maketh intercession. There he goes
[1:11:21] again. He's praying.
[1:11:23] You you can you imagine maketh interc
[1:11:26] Christ Jesus Lord of lords
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; is praying for you to make it.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; You were praying for your lost loved
[1:11:38] ones,
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; but Christ Jesus is praying for them.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:11:52] Who shall separate us from the love of
[1:11:55] Christ?
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Who Who's going to do it for you?
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; What's it going to be for you?
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Shall it be tribulation,
[1:12:07] distress,
[1:12:09] persecution?
[1:12:12] Maybe it'll be famine for some of us,
[1:12:15] nakedness, peril.
[1:12:18] or fear the sword war.
[1:12:24] But verse 37 says something. Says, "Nay,
[1:12:29] and all these things.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; We are."
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Not just the preacher. You are.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; And all these things. If you're in
[1:12:40] Christ, you're more than conquerors
[1:12:43] through him that loved loved you before
[1:12:45] you loved yourself. For I am persuaded
[1:12:48] that neither death, nor life, nor
[1:12:50] angels, nor principalities, nor powers,
[1:12:52] nor things present, nor things to come,
[1:12:54] nor heights or depths, or any other
[1:12:56] creature shall be able to separate me
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; from the love of Christ Jesus.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; That's in our Lord. Amen. That's the
[1:13:06] kind of life
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; that God's looking for. I want to just
[1:13:11] show you and we're going to wind it
[1:13:12] down, but I'd like to give you a couple
[1:13:14] examples at least in the Bible of people
[1:13:17] that met Jesus face to face
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; and completely
[1:13:22] did a 360°ree turnaround.
[1:13:27] In 2 Kings 6:8,
[1:13:31] the king of Syria had war against
[1:13:33] Israel. And we go to verse 11. And the
[1:13:36] king of Syria,
[1:13:38] they had war against Israel in verse 8.
[1:13:40] And they had come down to defeat Israel.
[1:13:43] But it just so happened that God had a
[1:13:45] prophet in the land.
[1:13:48] It just so happened, maybe it was say it
[1:13:49] another way, just so happened that he
[1:13:51] had a real Christian in the land, one
[1:13:54] that he could talk to.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; But in this case, it was a prophet.
[1:14:03] And it didn't go so well for the king of
[1:14:05] Syria. See, they thought they were the
[1:14:08] superpower.
[1:14:10] And they thought they would overpower
[1:14:12] the rest of the world.
[1:14:14] Israel was a big part of the world.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; And everything that the king of Syria
[1:14:20] did,
[1:14:23] Israel knew about.
[1:14:25] And Israel, the king of Syria came to
[1:14:27] his people and he said, "We have a
[1:14:28] traitor in our midst."
[1:14:30] Now I just want to tell you something
[1:14:32] that Syria were pagans.
[1:14:36] Wicked unbelieving
[1:14:39] worldly non-believing pagans.
[1:14:42] No god of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; And they had enough belief in the God
[1:14:49] that you struggle with to believe
[1:14:52] everything. They said, "King, stop."
[1:14:59] that they have a man of God in their
[1:15:00] midst.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; I don't think you Thank you, sis. They
[1:15:06] have a man of God in their midst.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; And what you speak in your bed chambers,
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; that guy hears in his ears.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait,
[1:15:17] wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait a
[1:15:19] minute. Wait a minute. This guy's
[1:15:21] preaching. Preachers aren't supposed to
[1:15:23] preach unless they're Christians.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; This is a pagan.
[1:15:28] Yeah.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; This is a
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Syrian.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Never went to church.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Never read the Bible.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Don't believe in God.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; What's he doing preaching?
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Cuz he has seen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; He has seen. You can't unsee what you've
[1:15:45] seen.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Seeing ain't just seeing. He has
[1:15:50] interpreted the power.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Power. How could the the man of God
[1:15:56] understand what the king says in his bad
[1:15:59] chambers?
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; And how could God get a worldly person
[1:16:06] to to preach that, testify that publicly
[1:16:10] and the king's throne?
[1:16:13] And we're struggling.
[1:16:16] Wait up.
[1:16:19] And we were struggling.
[1:16:23] and you were struggling about your
[1:16:24] problems in your life.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; You don't think God hears your prayers
[1:16:31] before you can even speak them
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; when those worries pass through your
[1:16:35] line and your hair changes color.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Like if he can have a man of God hear
[1:16:42] what the
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:16:53] Yeah.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Yep. That's right.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Now, very foolishly.
[1:16:58] See, this was the king of Syria.
[1:17:02] It was his people that knew the truth.
[1:17:05] But he was still needing a little help.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, we're going to go get
[1:17:09] this man of God."
[1:17:12] Oh, sometimes we're really slow
[1:17:15] learners.
[1:17:17] Now, you know, if that king would have
[1:17:18] logically thought about it for a moment,
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; that the god he was going to get could
[1:17:24] tell the people what he thought in his
[1:17:25] bed chambers, did he think he was going
[1:17:28] to just go up and take him?
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; I mean, he he needed some
[1:17:37] uh you know, he needed,
[1:17:40] you know, an evaluation. Yeah, that's
[1:17:43] the word I was looking for. He needed a
[1:17:45] psychological evaluation.
[1:17:49] And so he went down to get this man of
[1:17:51] God. I love saying man of God. Woo.
[1:17:55] He went down to, you know, anybody that
[1:17:57] serves the Lord is a man of God.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Anybody that I no longer live but Christ
[1:18:02] that liveth in me is a man of God. Woman
[1:18:03] and man.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of man of God's here this
[1:18:08] morning.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; And the woman came from the man. So it's
[1:18:11] also a man of God.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:18:20] Oh wow.
[1:18:22] Something just come to me. God wants me
[1:18:24] to tell you something. Do you know in
[1:18:26] Revelations,
[1:18:27] maybe this is more for people that are
[1:18:30] young or are visitors. You know in
[1:18:31] Revelations when John looked and seen
[1:18:34] the the the hinder side of Jesus Christ,
[1:18:39] you when you go home, you look in your
[1:18:40] Bible, you know what it said?
[1:18:43] It said it looks like
[1:18:46] kind of looks like a man,
[1:18:51] but it was the bride of Christ. It was a
[1:18:53] it was a woman man because Christ
[1:18:56] because we were in him
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; and John couldn't interpret what Christ
[1:19:03] was because the church
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; was inside the body. Amen.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; And so he identifies a man and woman
[1:19:12] look together.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Because Christ had actually taken you to
[1:19:17] his self.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Re that's just Bible revelations.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so he comes down and you know
[1:19:24] the man of God uh he there's not one
[1:19:29] speck of problems here. You know he knew
[1:19:32] exactly
[1:19:34] who he was serving. Yeah,
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; but his servant that was with him, his,
[1:19:40] you know, it wasn't his bodyguard cuz he
[1:19:42] didn't need a bodyguard, but, you know,
[1:19:44] the person that carried his suitcase and
[1:19:45] brought the food and maybe his Bible,
[1:19:47] cuz the man of God might have had a, you
[1:19:49] know,
[1:19:51] a bad leg or something.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; And his servant woke up.
[1:20:06] Verse 14. Therefore the king of Syria
[1:20:09] sent hither horses and chariots and
[1:20:11] great hosts and they came by night and
[1:20:13] compressed the city. Verse 15, that's
[1:20:14] where it went. And the servant of the
[1:20:17] man of God, the prophet Elijah, raised
[1:20:21] up early to cook him breakfast, and was
[1:20:25] gone out. And behold,
[1:20:28] the host compressed the city with hords
[1:20:30] and chariots and servants. And he said
[1:20:33] unto his master, he said, "Awake." He
[1:20:35] woke him up. Said, "Wake up, Elisha.
[1:20:38] We're done. This is it. We done went to
[1:20:44] the cartels took us over."
[1:20:49] Said, "Last master,
[1:20:52] this is it. How shall we do? We're
[1:20:55] finished."
[1:20:56] And he answered, Elisha answered him. He
[1:20:59] said, "Fear not.
[1:21:02] This is where our song came from.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; For there's more with us than be with
[1:21:07] them.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; A lot of people don't know that.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; We're on the winning side.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; With feeders and furls,
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell the whole world.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Praise
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; that my God is captain and guide.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; And it's not to fear.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Cuz he's always near.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:21:28] No matter how fierce the enemy might
[1:21:30] sing horses and chariots
[1:21:33] cuz we're not going to give in. That'd
[1:21:35] be impossible because he dwells within
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; with Christ.
[1:21:42] We have the victory.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; He said there's more with us than be
[1:21:46] with him. And Elisha prayed and he said,
[1:21:47] "Lord,
[1:21:50] open that poor boy's eyes.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Open I pray. I pray, my prayer this
[1:21:57] morning is
[1:21:59] God will open your eyes.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Not to me, not to this church, but to
[1:22:07] him.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Y
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; open your eyes.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; And you got a little situation, you just
[1:22:13] send that right over. Just put that
[1:22:15] right over in the the God box
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; your mind. And just I tell you what, you
[1:22:20] know, you do this. You know, you know,
[1:22:22] when you're married a long time, you get
[1:22:23] to understand your spouse. You know,
[1:22:25] when when you get a God box and you say,
[1:22:27] "Honey, pay the hydra bill." Then it's
[1:22:30] gone. It's just completely gone. It's in
[1:22:33] the sea of my forgetfulness and I'll
[1:22:34] never remember it no more unless I get
[1:22:37] the second bill in the mail.
[1:22:40] And then I normally have to repent. I
[1:22:43] said, "But honey, I I I but you know,
[1:22:46] when you tell God, you don't have to you
[1:22:48] don't never get the second bill."
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Cuz when you just put it in the se
[1:22:54] the God box, you you can keep your brown
[1:22:56] hair, your black hair,
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; prayed, and opened his eyes. And the
[1:23:04] Lord opened his eyes, and the young man
[1:23:07] saw, can you imagine?
[1:23:09] Can you imagine the change
[1:23:12] in his new mirror?
[1:23:15] And behold, the mountain was full of
[1:23:18] horses
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; and chariots. Amen.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; And fire
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; around Elisha.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; And he just went,
[1:23:31] "Wow,
[1:23:34] I never seen God before, but wow."
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; And Elijah walked right out in the enemy
[1:23:40] camp. He walked right out in the enemy
[1:23:43] camp.
[1:23:46] He walked right up to him. He said, "You
[1:23:47] can't see me, can you? You can't see
[1:23:49] me." And they said, "We're looking for
[1:23:51] Elisha." He said, ' Okay. Will you come
[1:23:54] with me? We're looking for Jesus. Will
[1:23:56] you come with me? Come with me. And he
[1:23:58] brought him right in the king's chamber.
[1:24:00] Said, "We're still looking for El." So I
[1:24:01] sound like some people in church. We're
[1:24:03] looking for God.
[1:24:05] We're We're I wonder. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
[1:24:07] You run into him. Oh. I can't. I never
[1:24:10] seen nothing happened in a long time.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Like the boy that went fishing. He asked
[1:24:16] his mom. He asked his mom. He said, "Ask
[1:24:18] my mom." said, "Where's God, mom?" Oh, I
[1:24:21] don't know where God is. You'd have to
[1:24:23] ask the the the the Sunday school
[1:24:25] teacher. Sunday school teacher. She was
[1:24:28] a mom, too. And she said, "Oh, I don't
[1:24:30] know where God is." You have to ask the
[1:24:32] preacher. That preacher wasn't a man of
[1:24:34] God.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Said he was a preacher, but he wasn't a
[1:24:37] man of God.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Oh, I don't know where God
[1:24:41] is."
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; boy went fishing with an old man. Yes,
[1:24:48] sir.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; And nobody thought he was a man of God,
[1:24:51] but he actually was a man of God.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Cuz he just went fishing.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; He didn't stand behind the pulpit and
[1:24:57] wear t.
[1:24:58] I hope I get that revelation. And
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; little boy said, "You know, you know,
[1:25:06] pops, I asked my mom and the Sunday
[1:25:09] school teacher
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; and and the the the preacher that wasn't
[1:25:13] a preacher,
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; and nobody could tell me where God was."
[1:25:16] Yes sir.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; A man just started old tears.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Said everything I look at God.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; I look at a tree and God made it.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; I look at my brother and sister and God
[1:25:31] built them in his image.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; And I look at my
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; I look at the sun and it reminds me of
[1:25:37] the son of God. And I look at the the
[1:25:39] rain and it reminds me of the Holy
[1:25:41] Spirit in the water coming down the
[1:25:42] river.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "I put a fish out and the
[1:25:45] life's
[1:25:53] He recognized God
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; because God was
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; God was like a light in the inside that
[1:26:04] was turned on.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:12] See, God
[1:26:14] is exactly as big
[1:26:18] as you believe he is.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; And God can answer your prayer
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; just as much as you can believe he can.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; That's exactly how big God is.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Now, my God
[1:26:35] in that case is very big.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. cuz I have situations I can't take
[1:26:40] care of.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; So, I just put them in the God box.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; I just put them in the God box and say,
[1:26:48] "God,
[1:26:50] thank you.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; We'll talk again soon."
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; My last my last example,
[1:26:59] and I bet you I have a dozen more, so
[1:27:01] maybe next week will be the same
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; if God allows me to.
[1:27:07] I want to talk about Acts.
[1:27:11] Acts 9
[1:27:14] 1:5. And I'll close. I promise I'll
[1:27:16] close.
[1:27:18] See, you know, we mentioned last week
[1:27:19] when when God comes in our midst
[1:27:23] and you recognize that God's in your
[1:27:26] presence,
[1:27:27] it's it's a supernatural feeling.
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; And I just tell you something, he's here
[1:27:33] this morning. Amen.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; It ain't is I just just just to clarify
[1:27:37] something. It's not brother Dale in the
[1:27:39] preaching.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; If if you think that you just I I just
[1:27:45] feel so sorry for you.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; But you can be a vessel surrendered to
[1:27:51] honor.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; He's the potter and I'm the clay.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; And he's making a vessel
[1:27:59] of honor. And he never throws away the
[1:28:01] clay
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; cuz he can patch up. He's the greatest
[1:28:06] patcher
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; and it's brand new
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; here. Saul and and you know the Bible
[1:28:14] can just tell it even better than I can.
[1:28:17] But I just go through the first verse
[1:28:19] here.
[1:28:21] Saul was a very religious man and he
[1:28:24] believed in God. But he had a wrong god
[1:28:32] and he didn't believe in the Jesus
[1:28:34] Christ the New Testament God
[1:28:37] and see Jesus had came and so Jesus was
[1:28:41] the perfect sacrifice. So the veil of
[1:28:44] the temple rent and twain and there was
[1:28:46] no more needed of killing of lambs and
[1:28:48] goats. But they thought that Jesus was
[1:28:52] was just a preacher
[1:28:55] and they thought it was blaspheme.
[1:28:58] They didn't see the God in the man.
[1:29:01] That's the problem with everybody today
[1:29:04] is if you have the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:07] Ghost
[1:29:08] is the other Holy Ghost will recognize.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; So when you have the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:14] Ghost,
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; my Holy Ghost recognizes that.
[1:29:18] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; And Saul was yet breathing out
[1:29:25] threatenings and slaughters against the
[1:29:27] disciples of the Lord, but he was a
[1:29:30] believer.
[1:29:31] Now, I'm going to tell you something
[1:29:33] that still happens today.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you know that, but I've
[1:29:37] had a few of those.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I probably have a few notes in my
[1:29:41] desk there. Threatenings and
[1:29:43] slaughterings.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Against the disciples of the Lord. And
[1:29:47] they went and he went to the high
[1:29:48] priest. Now this was actually the people
[1:29:51] in the church. So they were good
[1:29:54] Christians. I mean they had they had
[1:29:56] like gold on their building.
[1:30:01] And he desired him letters from Damascus
[1:30:04] to the syn the synagogues that if he
[1:30:07] should find any way whether the man
[1:30:10] woman
[1:30:12] they man or woman sorry might be brought
[1:30:14] abound to Jerusalem
[1:30:17] that believes in Jesus. In verse three
[1:30:20] and as he journeyied near Damascus
[1:30:25] a bright light came down from heaven.
[1:30:28] See, Paul was thinking he was serving
[1:30:30] God, but he was stone blind and and he
[1:30:33] wasn't serving God at all.
[1:30:36] Now, I want to just clarify something in
[1:30:38] our midst. Now, I can clarify this
[1:30:40] scripturally, but I'm going to tell you,
[1:30:42] Jesus was not on earth when Paul was
[1:30:45] alive.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; He had been crucified.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Paul was converted after.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Okay, we understand that. cuz I've been
[1:30:57] preaching something all day. And some of
[1:30:59] you, if you're doubting what I'm
[1:31:00] preaching, I'm going to show you right
[1:31:01] here in the Bible.
[1:31:03] And as he journeying, he came near in
[1:31:04] Damascus. And suddenly a bright light
[1:31:06] shined around him from heaven. And he
[1:31:08] fell on the earth and he heard a voice
[1:31:11] saying unto him, Sa,
[1:31:16] why persecute thou me? Now just just
[1:31:20] Vicki, if you can work with me, let's go
[1:31:22] back to verse one.
[1:31:26] And Saul was breathing out threatening
[1:31:28] and slaughters against the disciples of
[1:31:30] the Lord.
[1:31:33] Not against the Lord,
[1:31:35] against the disciples of the Lord.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Against the disciples. Let's go back to
[1:31:40] verse four now, Vicki. Thank you. And he
[1:31:43] said, "Saw saw why persecuted thou me?"
[1:31:48] And Saw is now about to become
[1:31:52] converted.
[1:31:54] And he said, "Who art thou, Lord?" How
[1:32:00] did he know that?
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Well, one thing was the power of the the
[1:32:08] the delight, the power that had brought
[1:32:11] him to his knees was greater than any
[1:32:14] power he had ever received before. Amen.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; So he might not have full understanding,
[1:32:21] but he knew that that was supernatural
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; to humble him
[1:32:28] and he called it Lord.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; And the Lord answered him,
[1:32:35] "Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Lord."
[1:32:38] Let's go back to verse one.
[1:32:41] Back to verse one. And Saul was
[1:32:42] breathing out threatenings and
[1:32:45] slaughters against the Lord's disciples
[1:32:49] the against the disciples of the Lord.
[1:32:54] Okay, let's go back to verse 5.
[1:32:58] And the Lord answered Saul and said, "I
[1:33:01] am Jesus."
[1:33:03] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[1:33:04] whoa, whoa. Well, Jesus was not on
[1:33:06] earth.
[1:33:08] Oh, remember Mrs. Jesus? Remember
[1:33:10] brother Jesus? Jeff. Yeah. Brother
[1:33:12] Lawrence, brother Jesus. Sister, brother
[1:33:15] Jesus.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Now, God
[1:33:19] can't lie.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. But Jesus wasn't on
[1:33:22] earth.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; I I don't think you're catching it.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Who was Paul killed? He Who was
[1:33:31] threethreatened? The disciples
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; of the Lord.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; And the Lord
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; made no disclaimer. And he said, "Jesus,
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus."
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; How persecuted thou for it's hard to
[1:33:55] kick against.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; You know, you can't fight God.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; There's a few people are going to find
[1:34:01] that out in the next, you know, maybe in
[1:34:03] 26. Oh, bless God, you know.
[1:34:09] Yeah.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; But God, my God's still God.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; I mean, he's he's the top of the
[1:34:15] pyramid.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Everybody goes through him.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Even if you don't recognize him, you
[1:34:25] still go through him.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Go.
[1:34:38] And if you read further in that
[1:34:39] scripture,
[1:34:42] God told Saul what to do. Rise and go to
[1:34:45] town. And God sent one of the the man of
[1:34:49] gods. Oh, I love that. And God sent a
[1:34:51] man of God by to witness unto Saul.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; And he changed his name to Paul.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; See, you didn't think you were Jesus.
[1:35:02] It's good to meet you, Mrs. Jesus.
[1:35:05] I mean, if the Lord calls you to I mean,
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; like, who am I?
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; See, when you when you meet him face to
[1:35:20] face, it changes every Yeah. You know,
[1:35:22] I'm just going to close on this. Just
[1:35:24] forgive me. Just this one verse. Just
[1:35:26] close. Genesis 4 and 4. You know, who
[1:35:29] was it when Cain and Abel offered their
[1:35:32] sacrifices? How did Abel know that it
[1:35:36] was blood?
[1:35:38] How did I'm even going to close this, so
[1:35:40] I forgive me for going on. I just I just
[1:35:44] It's hard to stop. How did Abel know?
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; How come Cain didn't know?
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; It was God.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; It was God. Praise God.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; God gave Abel a revelation
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; that it was blood.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; The sin in the garden was blood.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; And it was going to be blood to wash
[1:36:14] away all the sins.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; And here Abel brought a sacrifice of a
[1:36:18] lamb. And his sacrifice was disgusting.
[1:36:22] They never had gold on their church.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Do you think Abel's sacrifice in the
[1:36:27] garden was near as pretty as Kane's?
[1:36:30] Kane's had like he had trees on steroids
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; and God said I've rejected Caines
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; and I've accepted Abel. Now nobody told
[1:36:43] them
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; but God
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; supernaturally.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; God had gave Abel a revelation that it
[1:36:53] was blood that takes away sins. And you
[1:36:55] know and I'm going to close on this. A
[1:36:57] merciful God came back to Cain and said,
[1:37:01] "If you will take the sacrifice of your
[1:37:04] brother, if you will be as your brother,
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; you will also
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; be forgiven."
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:16] If you also
[1:37:18] will come to the revelation
[1:37:21] that there's more with us than be with
[1:37:24] them, we're on the winning side. No
[1:37:27] matter how frustrated this world gets,
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; everything is you can go this far. Do
[1:37:35] you know that that the everything cannot
[1:37:37] explode
[1:37:39] until God takes his little bride home?
[1:37:41] Amen.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; And there's I could probably give you
[1:37:44] one dozen scriptures, but we'd have to
[1:37:46] be longer
[1:37:48] to prove that. One is Joseph put his his
[1:37:51] bride in the palace, his gentile bride
[1:37:53] in the palace. Why? He revealed himself
[1:37:55] unto his brothers, the Jews.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; No harm will hurt his wife.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; But he's wanting you to come into total
[1:38:06] belief
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; that I am he.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Driver. Come, honey. Amen. Yeah.
[1:38:14] Amen.
[1:38:16] When you meet him face to face.
[1:38:21] Wow.
[1:38:23] It takes a relationship.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; I can't give it to you.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; I can show you what it looks like in the
[1:38:30] Bible.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; But it's amazing grace how sweet the
[1:38:33] sound
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; to save the wretched like me. I once was
[1:38:37] stone blind, but now I'm found.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amazing grace. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe we'll sing that song. It's
[1:38:47] been a long time. Amazing grace.
[1:38:52] Amazing.
[1:39:02] Heat

[1:43:15] Thank you, Lord God.
[1:43:18] Hallelujah. Blessed be his name.
[1:43:22] Amen.
[1:43:24] Let's sing just as we close. Let's sing
[1:43:25] All D.
[1:43:28] There's a story in
[1:43:36] Heat.
[1:43:47] Heat.
[1:43:58] Yeah.

[1:45:08] Yeah.

[1:45:46] Heat up
[1:45:50] here.
[1:46:05] Lord Jesus,
[1:46:11] forgive me.
[1:46:14] I struggle sometimes. Lord,
[1:46:17] I forget that you can take care of it
[1:46:19] all.
[1:46:22] I'm sorry for helping, God. Help
[1:46:32] me get to that place, Lord God.
[1:46:36] No matter where it is,
[1:46:39] you have everything in your hand
[1:46:43] in control.
[1:46:45] And nothing in this world and nothing in
[1:46:47] my life goes past
[1:46:51] where you allow.
[1:46:54] And Lord, I forgot about the scripture
[1:46:56] where you said that you wouldn't give us
[1:46:59] anything more than we could contain,
[1:47:03] more than we could bear. Sorry,
[1:47:06] I forgot about that one, Lord God,
[1:47:09] when I tried to help your kingdom
[1:47:14] and bitterly failed.
[1:47:18] Lord God, you know it's all yours.
[1:47:23] We worship you. We know you're more than
[1:47:26] able.
[1:47:29] And death,
[1:47:32] and bankruptcy,
[1:47:35] and famine, peril, set, world
[1:47:38] calamities.
[1:47:44] It's hard sometimes, God.
[1:47:47] But when we're in you, when we remember,
[1:47:50] when we remember you, when we see your
[1:47:53] face,
[1:47:56] it's okay.
[1:47:59] Help me, Jesus.
[1:48:02] Help me, Jesus. Raise my faith, Lord
[1:48:04] God. Just help me to let go and let God
[1:48:06] have his way.
[1:48:08] Just let go. Just let God take care of
[1:48:12] everything.
[1:48:15] Hallelujah. All is well.
[1:48:18] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Bless
[1:48:20] these amazing people. Came in a terrible
[1:48:23] day
[1:48:26] weatherwise.
[1:48:28] Thank you for your presence.
[1:48:31] Thank you, Jehovah.
[1:48:34] Hallelujah.
[1:48:36] Our provider of everything you need is
[1:48:39] in Christ Jesus.
[1:48:41] Sing the chorus one more time. All is
[1:48:45] well.
[1:49:09] Heat. Heat.
[1:49:20] Heat.
[1:49:30] Heat.
