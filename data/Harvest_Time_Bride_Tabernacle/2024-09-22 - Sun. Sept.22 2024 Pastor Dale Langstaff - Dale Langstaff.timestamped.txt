[25:47] all we just uh I was going to sing a
[25:50] song I was thinking we maybe he'll sing
[25:51] it
[25:52] when when we close we had a just a
[25:59] amazing service Wednesday
[26:01] night one of the best Services we've had
[26:04] in this church since it's been here it's
[26:06] just it was Supernatural from the first
[26:09] song we have come into your house to
[26:11] magnify your name and worship you and
[26:15] literally the power of God just
[26:17] fell like that it's beautiful you know
[26:21] just praise God that I could be a part
[26:24] of it amen amen let's just take our
[26:26] Bibles and and look into God's word and
[26:29] you know the prophet said this we're
[26:31] going to turn to Mark
[26:33] 12:24
[26:34] uh said you know if you can't believe uh
[26:39] the the person preaching in this case
[26:41] maybe your pastor or the minister if you
[26:43] can't believe that I'm God's servant or
[26:46] you can't believe that I'm ministering
[26:48] God's word then there's no way that I
[26:49] could do anything for you God can only
[26:52] do something for you through the
[26:53] fivefold
[26:55] ministry if you believe in them that's
[26:58] why the scriptures say and this is
[27:00] clearly a positive thing and clearly
[27:03] your choice to know them the labor among
[27:06] you cuz we know that there's more wolves
[27:09] than there are sheep and uh that's
[27:11] because Satan knows his time is near the
[27:14] end and uh so I just say that to lay a
[27:17] foundation amen if if you know the
[27:19] brother Braham said this in a quote and
[27:20] I might not get to it he said you know
[27:23] God never sent us to show the
[27:26] word god showed us in Mark he said go
[27:29] into all the world and preach he never
[27:31] said teach the word he said preach it
[27:34] was under the
[27:35] inspiration of the word Paul said I
[27:39] don't come to you with flowering speech
[27:41] and fancy words and all this but in
[27:43] power and demonstration of Jehovah which
[27:46] is still the
[27:47] word man we're not
[27:50] leaving preaches and leaves the word
[27:52] well he's just a he's just an
[27:55] antichrist but you know we can have the
[27:57] word word it just memorize the word but
[28:00] it's the anoint the letter kth but the
[28:04] spirit it's God's holy spirit it's not
[28:07] the spirit of a man it's God's holy
[28:09] spirit Hallelujah I want to I want to
[28:12] just uh let's read our scripture verely
[28:14] verily I say unto you except the corn of
[28:17] wheat fall into the ground and die it
[28:21] abides alone but if it die it
[28:26] bringeth much fruit fruit you may have
[28:29] your seats Lord Jesus we pray that
[28:31] you'll add the blessing to the word and
[28:33] Lord I pray that through my stumber lips
[28:36] and and and bad English that you'll
[28:39] you'll portray what you uh brought to me
[28:42] Lord Jesus and may they catch it in
[28:44] their heart the truth the true
[28:46] revelation of what you're bringing this
[28:48] morning in your name we pray amen you
[28:51] know the I'm going to say something
[28:53] extreme here do you know that there's
[28:56] you know we believe that the we if
[28:58] you're a Christian this morning you have
[29:00] eternal life that you came from God and
[29:02] so you have a seat of God we believe in
[29:05] predestination and the seed of God but
[29:07] I'm going to show you something this
[29:08] morning that is more
[29:13] important or equal to being
[29:19] predestinated or being a seat of God now
[29:21] those are huge words I almost had to
[29:24] check that
[29:26] myself no I did have to check that
[29:30] myself something that's more important
[29:32] than being a seat of God or
[29:35] predestinated or coming from
[29:37] God and I know you're going to shut down
[29:40] as soon as I say the word
[29:42] and I'm just sorry for you but I'm going
[29:46] to give you multiple examples where the
[29:47] Prophet said it was more important it
[29:50] was
[29:51] everything and we failed in this
[29:53] one-word
[29:56] category I
[29:58] failed and I believe we've all failed
[30:02] and that's
[30:05] atmosphere
[30:07] nothing can
[30:09] grow even though it came from
[30:13] Jehovah without
[30:16] atmosphere nothing can
[30:19] grow and God will hold us
[30:23] responsible brother mam said
[30:26] that for not
[30:28] creating the proper
[30:33] atmosphere and when somebody says
[30:35] they're going to hold me a responsible I
[30:36] check into that and say okay I don't
[30:39] like that feeling so do I want to go
[30:41] down this road or can I handle the
[30:46] responsibility amen like marriage or
[30:48] borrowing money or anything you're
[30:51] responsible so are you big enough to
[30:53] handle the responsibility
[30:59] he said you are creators and you create
[31:02] the environment around
[31:04] you and if you don't create an
[31:06] atmosphere for life to come forth God
[31:09] will judge
[31:16] you everything takes an atmosphere to
[31:19] grow takes an atmosphere to bake a cake
[31:21] it takes an atmosphere to bring life
[31:23] takes an atmosphere for everything is
[31:26] conditions you know I when we went to
[31:28] the one ministers meeting and the
[31:29] ministers I I uh really had their
[31:32] attention I said you know in the farming
[31:34] life especially in corn it's seed to
[31:37] soil conversion you know we've been
[31:40] preaching on conversion and seed to soil
[31:43] conversion I have the worst corn crop
[31:44] I've ever grew in my life this year and
[31:47] is because the ground was terribly
[31:48] prepared in the
[31:50] spring it was seed to soil
[31:53] conversion if you are very good
[31:56] atmosphere now listen I'm going to show
[31:58] you what the prophet said so you don't
[32:01] have to get nervous unless you don't
[32:03] believe the message of the Bible
[32:06] amen but the wrong kind of an atmosphere
[32:09] will either stagnate or actually
[32:13] kill and the reason that many young
[32:16] people have left the
[32:18] church that are
[32:20] predestinated and have not brother bam
[32:23] said you cannot have the baptism of the
[32:25] Holy Ghost without
[32:26] atmosphere you and I get it it's not
[32:29] possible so the seed of God have stood
[32:32] up and went out the doors because there
[32:35] was no atmosphere to bring forth life
[32:38] amen and he also said that you can bring
[32:41] forth life any way like even false life
[32:45] can bring an atmosphere he said a
[32:48] chicken egg can hatch in an
[32:49] incubator a puppy can bring forth a
[32:52] chicken egg you can put it in a blanket
[32:53] you can put it by the heater you can put
[32:55] a heat lamp over it that's why he said
[32:58] that you can get the Holy Ghost
[33:00] somewhere else than
[33:02] here he even named the
[33:05] churches because if they if you're the
[33:07] seat of God that's God's business but if
[33:11] the other people create the
[33:14] atmosphere and it'll bring forth
[33:16] life and you know I talked to many
[33:21] ministers around the world and that but
[33:23] let let's just let's just look at some
[33:25] things the prophet said before we say
[33:26] that you know so we know that life can
[33:29] come forth by many
[33:32] substitutes but we are responsible God's
[33:35] responsible for who's predestinated but
[33:38] you're responsible for the atmosphere
[33:39] that you created when they're in your
[33:41] environment amen now we know that the
[33:44] devil has put all the guns on the
[33:48] truth and we also know that the devil's
[33:51] in church this morning because the
[33:53] brother Bram said that the three kinds
[33:55] of Believers a make believer
[33:59] nonbeliever and just plain a false
[34:03] believer amen and so you know in a small
[34:07] church we don't like to think of
[34:10] that it's much easier to think of that
[34:12] three kinds of Believers in a big
[34:14] congregation because it's easier to
[34:16] hide but I I I'm I I I'm just this is
[34:19] coming back to me so I'm just going to
[34:20] share you know I've talked to PE
[34:21] preachers all over the
[34:24] world and and even before I say that if
[34:27] you're wondering why is brother Dale
[34:28] going down this road well number one God
[34:30] told me to and number two Jesus
[34:34] did Jesus did I'm going to show you in
[34:37] Mark 8 or John 8 sorry Jesus did and I I
[34:42] think he's a pretty good example and uh
[34:45] also I know that he showed me this I
[34:47] talk to ministers all over the world
[34:50] that have people come up and rehash the
[34:53] message after they
[34:55] preach brother Osman told me he said you
[34:58] know brother Dale he said every time I
[34:59] preach on morning he said there's two
[35:01] brothers go outside the church and repr
[35:03] preach my message all the things I have
[35:06] wrong hband
[35:08] Bley brother Leo and yuganda had a
[35:11] brother go around and tell all the
[35:12] people in the church why they didn't
[35:13] have to pay ties and offerings because
[35:14] that was Old
[35:16] Testament you know you don't have to do
[35:17] that stuff don't matter what your pastor
[35:19] says don't listen to him I know the
[35:20] truth cuz God revealed it to me
[35:24] too and I had ministers talk to multiple
[35:27] people like that and you know and I'm I
[35:30] said to say I I want to break this yoke
[35:32] this honest but every single church that
[35:34] I've attended in Ontario had that
[35:37] Spirit every single church I can tell
[35:40] you the places where the people come out
[35:42] and congregated and chewed up everything
[35:44] the pastor had said after he
[35:47] preached and I don't want to have to
[35:49] bring this up again but it ain't going
[35:50] to happen
[35:51] here it ain't going to happen on this
[35:53] property because see Jesus when it
[35:55] happened to Jesus he left cuz he didn't
[35:57] know the property but in this case I own
[36:00] the
[36:01] property so it'll either be
[36:04] stopped or you'll be asked to
[36:06] leave because there was people here
[36:11] repeatedly if my doctrine's wrong you
[36:14] have two options pray that God converts
[36:17] me or
[36:18] leave cuz I there's not one person
[36:21] sitting here this morning that I
[36:22] solicited to come here not one
[36:25] person if it if if the is it was my own
[36:31] kids is um is that the truth did I go to
[36:34] any of your houses and beg you to attend
[36:37] I know that's the
[36:40] truth let's look at what the Bible said
[36:42] he said they wrote the Bible in word
[36:44] form and Jesus called it a seed but a
[36:46] seed cannot bring forth unless in the
[36:49] right condition in the right environment
[36:54] so it don't even matter that we're
[36:56] predestinated
[36:57] when we don't have the right environment
[36:59] now though that's like that's like I had
[37:02] to you know I had these thoughts back
[37:05] when we had camp
[37:06] meeting you know I very very very seldom
[37:09] do I get a a message like the day before
[37:12] I'm preaching I've been feeding on this
[37:14] for
[37:16] months I'll start putting quotes and
[37:19] scripture in my phone and they'll be
[37:21] scattered I have to erase a 100 pictures
[37:23] before I can get back to the message
[37:24] that I had a thought of months ago
[37:27] that's just the way God
[37:30] leads here's another one he says what is
[37:32] it it's creating an atmosphere he says
[37:34] hallelujah he said Brothers he said if
[37:36] the atmosphere does it he said it's
[37:39] exactly right he said look at the hand
[37:40] hatches an egg he said it's not the hand
[37:42] egg it's the atmosphere he said you can
[37:45] put that egg under anything incubator I
[37:47] mean we already went there he said it's
[37:49] the atmosphere he said that's right the
[37:50] atmosphere is where the power of God
[37:52] moving in one Accord one place gathered
[37:56] together under one atmosphere expecting
[37:59] God to move with signs and wonders it's
[38:01] the
[38:02] atmosphere God can't do nothing without
[38:06] atmosphere absolutely nothing it don't
[38:09] matter you have the revealed
[38:12] word if you're a tiger that's got the
[38:14] revelation of the revealed word you're
[38:17] Satan's got that he knows this message
[38:20] in the Bible better than we do and
[38:24] trembles but he don't have the
[38:26] atmosphere
[38:27] he said the whole atmosphere here he
[38:29] said Lord create an atmosphere and my
[38:30] soul are one Accord he said our hearts
[38:33] are hungering to see an atmosphere the
[38:35] atmosphere is what brings it the
[38:37] atmosphere would bring it and if every
[38:39] person could get in one Perfect Harmony
[38:42] and be settled and get in the natural
[38:46] way because the atmosphere is what
[38:49] Hatches the
[38:52] Egg he says here he says you cannot get
[38:55] the filling of the baptism of the Holy
[38:57] Ghost ghost
[39:00] cannot with
[39:06] atmosphere oh bless God I know the
[39:09] message I study it
[39:10] daily Don't Mean a Thing watch this back
[39:14] in our scripture in John 12:24 maybe you
[39:16] can pull this
[39:17] up and they came to they came and they
[39:20] wanted to see Jesus and he came to the
[39:22] disciples seeing him at night and and he
[39:25] was he was spineless because he didn't
[39:27] want the other Church religious people
[39:29] to see him and he so he came to Jesus
[39:31] late and this is how Jesus answered he
[39:33] said verily verily I say unto you that
[39:35] I'm the seed of
[39:38] God but unless I
[39:41] die I won't I will abide
[39:45] alone now this is
[39:48] God now if God had to have the
[39:51] atmosphere to
[39:54] rot here's Jesus himself
[39:58] I have to get in an atmosphere where my
[40:01] life becomes
[40:05] nothing nothing and if I don't get in
[40:09] that atmosphere I will be
[40:17] nothing is that what Jesus
[40:22] said it will bite
[40:26] alone now let me just say was Jesus from
[40:29] God did Jesus have the SE God Jesus was
[40:33] Jehovah but he had to come in an
[40:42] atmosphere it's an atmosphere that
[40:44] brings
[40:47] life
[40:51] Hallelujah we've built everything around
[40:54] the word here's here's I want to show
[40:56] you you're
[40:59] saying you watch this you're saying
[41:00] brother Dale you're putting too much
[41:02] into the scripture John
[41:05] 1224 I'm sure glad you asked me that our
[41:09] Prophet said this he said wonderful but
[41:10] Christ never told us to build some else
[41:13] like that he said preach the gospel and
[41:15] the gospel this he directly mentions
[41:17] this scripture and he said the gospel
[41:19] isn't word only it's through Power and
[41:23] Demon power and manifestation of the
[41:25] Holy Spirit and it would produce the
[41:28] sign of
[41:29] Mark 16 where he said go into all the
[41:32] world and preach the gospel and these
[41:33] signs will follow them and the word
[41:36] itself the word itself is dead until it
[41:39] becomes an action that produces life
[41:43] that's why I could preach the message
[41:45] where you know brother bram's
[41:46] testimonies are fantastic and they're
[41:49] Vindicated and they're real and there's
[41:51] no doubt about it but you got to have
[41:53] your own testimonies Amen brother Dale
[41:56] has his own testimonies I can preach a
[41:58] whole sermon on my testimonies where
[42:00] fire don't burn where you can drive in a
[42:02] Ravine and you don't tip over and on and
[42:04] on and on and on and
[42:09] on and the devil will confess your
[42:22] testimony and then this is where he goes
[42:24] into the same quote this is in his India
[42:27] India uh trip report and he said except
[42:31] the corn of wheat falls into the ground
[42:33] it buys
[42:35] alone and when the words brought forth
[42:37] the heart of faith and it makes every
[42:39] promise in the Bible live again he said
[42:41] you got to live the it's the
[42:45] germanization of the
[42:47] word he said it self lives and receive
[42:51] received in the right place under the
[42:53] right conditions and every seed will
[42:55] bring life again and it's put there
[42:58] under the right condition atmosphere and
[43:00] Brethren I would say this with reverence
[43:03] and
[43:04] respect this is Brother Bram identifying
[43:08] our scripture that we read our text I
[43:10] would say this with reverence and
[43:12] respects Brethren as your brother
[43:14] knowing that maybe before tonight that I
[43:16] will stand in the Judgment seat of
[43:18] Christ in heaven and look and may say
[43:21] this that the
[43:23] atmosphere the atmosphere
[43:27] always brings forth the
[43:32] product and he goes into explaining the
[43:35] hand and the chicken and how all the
[43:37] eggs can a and then he said watch this
[43:39] he says I don't care whether you're a
[43:40] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian it's the
[43:43] atmosphere on the word he
[43:47] said if the word which is the a is in
[43:51] the right atmosphere and it's in a a
[43:54] presbyterian or whatever it is that
[43:55] produces the same results it's produces
[43:59] the born child again it's right Brethren
[44:03] whether you're Pentecostal or Full
[44:04] Gospel orever it's the
[44:10] atmosphere it's the
[44:12] atmosphere
[44:13] now you can have the atmosphere and if
[44:16] you don't have the truth it won't
[44:19] matter because there has to be a germ
[44:21] seed of
[44:24] life but we have lots of germ seed of
[44:26] life
[44:29] of young people that aren't in church
[44:30] this morning because the atmosphere has
[44:34] stunk really
[44:38] bad now if you've got to create an
[44:41] atmosphere your faith will do it and
[44:43] there in the upper room in one Accord in
[44:45] Heavenly places rushing Mighty Wind come
[44:47] in he said the atmosphere was right it
[44:49] takes the atmosphere to do anything
[44:57] yeah that's right he said you know the
[44:59] regular produce talking about chicken
[45:02] and egg again it say he said it's in the
[45:05] right atmosphere I'll hatch anyhow
[45:08] listen Brethren man that loves God and
[45:12] got the right kind of atmosphere he
[45:14] could get into it'll produce a newborn
[45:17] baby just as certain as I'm here this
[45:21] morning he said it's the atmosphere that
[45:25] counts let the little handful of people
[45:27] sitting here tonight and get into
[45:29] perfect atmosphere and watch what takes
[45:32] place it'll not be feval once Among Us
[45:35] or crippled or walk or death or dumb he
[45:38] said it's the
[45:43] atmosphere it's the
[45:45] atmosphere and we know what's happening
[45:47] in our
[45:48] midst because we have the
[45:51] truth and Satan knows it he knows he's
[45:55] only got to do one thing
[45:57] he can't take the truth from you cuz you
[45:59] already got
[46:00] that and you say well I didn't find well
[46:03] you had that before the foundation of
[46:04] the world you had the predestinated seat
[46:06] of God so Satan already
[46:10] started partially
[46:13] defeated but he only had to do one
[46:16] thing and he's done it really really
[46:19] really
[46:20] well but he's created an atmosphere you
[46:23] know why the brother Bram said he said
[46:24] it's not about the word he said it's
[46:26] it's not about my word and and this word
[46:29] and brother Brown said to it's the
[46:31] spirit that brings
[46:34] life it's the spirit that brings life
[46:37] you know there's everything in the Bible
[46:40] and in the message has two sides but
[46:43] it's when you bring them
[46:46] together in the right
[46:53] spirit amen amen we don't have a problem
[46:56] with being too noisy in church amen you
[47:00] noise won't scare me by the
[47:02] way it might help me to push me
[47:05] over I want to show some things and then
[47:08] I want to I want to just read a couple
[47:10] really short things and then I want to
[47:12] go into where I know you're questioning
[47:14] why I bring this up let say again Jesus
[47:18] dealt with
[47:20] this and a lot of people in the past
[47:23] that were definitely true of
[47:28] God which God will straighten out in the
[47:31] Judgment were Vindicated true men of God
[47:35] that affected my life were
[47:37] destroyed because they were too afraid
[47:41] to deal with the
[47:43] atmosphere but brother Dale
[47:47] ain't if you got a wrong spirit and
[47:49] atmosphere around
[47:51] you it might be all right if you're
[47:53] quiet but if you start making noise I'll
[47:56] throw you out of every hole of the
[47:58] wall it won't I won't even say I'm sorry
[48:02] or wave on the way out or nothing
[48:04] because Jesus did I I know I'm scaring
[48:07] you but Jesus did just just take my word
[48:11] for it Jesus did he said I don't believe
[48:13] in fuss and God sent us to pray me to
[48:15] pray for the sick preach the gospel
[48:17] thousand that would believe it why would
[48:19] I send time on one fanatic that don't
[48:21] believe it he said you know there's
[48:23] millions and millions and millions of
[48:24] people you here are guilty of it you're
[48:27] preaching and preaching and preaching
[48:28] and preaching and preaching and
[48:29] preaching over and over and over and
[48:32] over and over again you're like oh this
[48:34] brother Dale
[48:36] again and there's millions that never
[48:39] even heard the name of Jesus Christ one
[48:41] time not one
[48:44] time that's why a pastor has to go to
[48:46] the mission field get regener
[48:49] ised he said you're never in the wrong
[48:53] if you're preaching the gospel in the
[48:54] mission field never
[48:57] never that's a big word never said our
[49:01] greatest commission was to go into all
[49:03] the world not stay brother Brown said
[49:06] this I I didn't bring the quote up
[49:07] because I just had too much stop I mean
[49:10] unbelievable but he said he said I'm not
[49:13] called to just sit here and preach to
[49:15] you over and over and over and over over
[49:16] over again and you all fall
[49:19] asleep because there's other people that
[49:21] actually like to hear them
[49:22] preaching they just sitting
[49:25] there w
[49:34] he says I don't debate with anybody I
[49:36] don't believe in fussing with people the
[49:38] gospel wasn't made to fuss
[49:41] about he said I don't believe in fussing
[49:43] with people but when it comes to the
[49:45] spot that they're laying there they try
[49:47] to drag you into
[49:51] it I've listened to some of you try to
[49:54] to to tell me your Revelation that's off
[49:56] the word and you want me to agree or not
[49:58] and I'm just sitting there like oh I
[50:01] hope this day ends
[50:03] soon I don't want to be rude but
[50:08] like you're trying to drag me into your
[50:12] belief I had visiting ministers come
[50:15] here this year and saying I want I don't
[50:17] want to I don't want to talk to some
[50:19] people because I don't want to catch
[50:20] their
[50:21] Spirit brother Brown said he said I'd
[50:23] like to go to every one of your houses
[50:24] but he said I'm called to minister the
[50:26] word I have to get God's spirit can you
[50:29] imagine if I was preaching D spirit this
[50:30] morning place would clear right
[50:35] out we need God's spirit I don't want
[50:38] your spirit and you don't need to get
[50:39] mine brother Brown said I'm afraid I'm a
[50:42] fears that we're getting the pastor
[50:44] Spirit if he's a big fat guy and eats a
[50:46] lot then we all eat a lot if he's got a
[50:48] big belt buckle like this then we all
[50:49] get one the big Hut if you all
[50:53] four-wheel drive truck we all buy
[50:54] four-wheel drive trucks we ain't got the
[50:56] whole Holy
[50:58] Spirit we got the spirit of the
[51:01] pastor that's why people could have
[51:04] semis to truck around wooden briefcases
[51:07] of brother brandham because they were
[51:08] getting brother brandham Spirit they
[51:10] would make cardboard briefcases and
[51:11] truck them down with Van trucks across
[51:13] the states selling a a cardboard
[51:15] duplicate of the van brute kicks they
[51:17] were making millions and millions of
[51:18] dollars
[51:21] doing amen oh that was a really quiet
[51:25] one still the truth praise
[51:29] God
[51:44] wow wow I put one quote in there
[51:48] twice that's amazing God must have
[51:51] really wanted me to say that
[51:53] one John 8 John
[51:58] and
[51:59] John you know brother Osman Bartley when
[52:02] he was preaching our camp me he preached
[52:03] almost the whole services on John I
[52:05] think wow I'm going to have to go
[52:07] through and listen to that a whole bunch
[52:08] of times it was just incredible John has
[52:11] tremendous words in the Bible amen but
[52:14] you know here is Jesus and I I want
[52:18] uh John
[52:20] 8 yeah we start the whole scripture this
[52:23] whole chapter be great to study and I'm
[52:25] not going to read every verse but I
[52:26] always want to give you the scene where
[52:29] God dealt with a
[52:30] situation now here it says in 20 it says
[52:33] that these words Jesus spake in
[52:36] the he taught in
[52:39] the temple and no man laid hands on him
[52:44] for his hour wasn't come so here's Jesus
[52:46] behind the pulpit preaching in the
[52:49] Tabernacle correct so we've laid the
[52:52] scenes but they had not been taught
[52:54] Church order and Doctrine yet
[52:57] amen and they had not learned that the
[52:59] the spirit only deals through one person
[53:01] at a time and so when Jesus is
[53:04] ministering right they said he was
[53:06] ministering in the temple correct that's
[53:08] that that is what 20 says okay that the
[53:11] people actually talk back to
[53:14] him so they were really out of
[53:17] order but let's go to verse 23 and let's
[53:20] show you how Jesus didn't Overlook their
[53:24] eror
[53:26] now you can read the whole chapter but
[53:28] I'm just going to things and Jesus said
[53:31] unto them ye
[53:33] are from beneath and I am from above and
[53:37] ye are this world and I am not of this
[53:39] world and I say therefore unto you that
[53:42] ye shall die in your sins for ye believe
[53:45] for if you believe not that I am he ye
[53:48] shall die in your sins now you can only
[53:50] imagine the powerful words that they
[53:53] were saying to Jesus before I read that
[53:54] scripture
[53:57] now I showed you right there how Jesus
[53:59] dealt with them preaching back to
[54:05] him Jesus didn't like blow over
[54:08] it he gets called the
[54:12] outat verse
[54:14] 27 and understood not that he spake to
[54:20] them of the father they didn't
[54:23] understand Jesus revelation
[54:30] correct now in defense of the religious
[54:33] message Believers of that day Jesus was
[54:36] bringing a new
[54:37] message he has going from law to
[54:42] Grace and they love law because they
[54:45] liked
[54:46] working you know I'm just naturally like
[54:49] Grace because I like staying in the
[54:51] living room I just my kids say you're
[54:54] going to die in there it's all right
[54:55] with me I like Grace you want to work
[54:58] hard knock your boots off it's all out
[55:01] there you can do whatever you
[55:03] want that's how some of us are
[55:07] spiritually now let's just jump to verse
[55:10] 30 and as Jesus spake these words many
[55:15] many praise God hallelujah Church
[55:19] somebody help me preach somebody many
[55:23] said I
[55:24] believe yes well Hallelujah there was
[55:28] some Believers in the
[55:30] church and then Jesus said to those Jews
[55:33] which believed on him ye continue in my
[55:36] words and ye are my
[55:39] disciples
[55:41] indeed now that's good
[55:44] preaching but we just Dro down to verse
[55:46] 37 and there's lots of goodies right in
[55:48] between there but I'm just trying to not
[55:50] Bor you with the word of
[55:52] God this is in the same setting the same
[55:56] same service the same Tabernacle and the
[55:59] same
[56:00] Minister I know that you are Abraham's
[56:03] seed this is Jesus talking unto the
[56:06] unbelievers but if ye seek to kill me
[56:09] because my words has no place in
[56:12] you they were sitting in
[56:15] exactly
[56:17] exactly the same
[56:19] Tabernacle at exactly the same
[56:24] message Jesus did didn't go he didn't
[56:27] just skip over and say well maybe if I
[56:29] avoid them they'll go
[56:31] away he just called them
[56:33] out you either line up believe shut
[56:39] up that's what Jesus
[56:45] did verse 38 and I speak th that I have
[56:50] seen with my father and ye do that which
[56:54] you have seen with your father father
[56:57] and they answered him and said unto him
[56:58] Abraham is our father bless God I was
[57:01] raising the mess I went to Bram
[57:03] Tabernacle
[57:06] Hallelujah and verse 40 but now ye seek
[57:10] to kill
[57:12] me a man that hath told you the
[57:16] truth which I have heard of God and this
[57:20] did not
[57:21] Abraham Abraham never tried to kill God
[57:26] here they were believing Abraham's
[57:28] message but the Believers coming up in
[57:30] Abraham's message wanted to actually
[57:32] kill the very God that Abraham had
[57:36] preached because they wanted to worship
[57:38] the Abraham being their
[57:41] father
[57:43] amen and ye do the Deeds of your father
[57:46] and then said they unto him we weren't
[57:49] born a sinner and
[57:50] fornication we have but one father even
[57:53] God's our father bless God Abraham was
[57:56] of God and so are we of
[57:58] God and Jesus said unto them if God were
[58:03] your father you would love me for I
[58:06] proceedeth forth and came from God
[58:08] neither I came onto my came I of myself
[58:12] but he sent me and why do you not
[58:17] understand just my simple
[58:20] speech it's just very simple speech I'm
[58:22] I'm trying to love you I'm trying to
[58:25] create an atmosphere I'm wooing you on
[58:28] to myself and you're just blight F and
[58:34] despitefully
[58:35] rude trying to abuse
[58:39] me he said even because you cannot hear
[58:42] my words verse 44 and ye are of your
[58:45] fathers the devil and the lust of your
[58:48] fathers you do and he was a murderer
[58:52] from the beginning and Abode not in the
[58:55] truth
[58:57] now wait a minute but they were
[58:59] Abraham's
[59:02] sons they came out of the message Church
[59:04] of the
[59:05] day Father
[59:08] Abraham because there is no truth in him
[59:12] when he speaketh a lie and he speaketh
[59:14] his own for he was a liar he is a liar
[59:18] and the father of
[59:19] it talking about the devil and their
[59:22] daddy verse 45 let's watch how Jesus is
[59:25] dealing with unbelief in the
[59:29] Tabernacle just to bring it to
[59:30] remembrance we did say that he was
[59:32] preaching in the Tabernacle correct okay
[59:36] verse 45 and because I tell you the
[59:38] truth you believe me not which ye which
[59:42] of you convinced me of sin and if I say
[59:47] the truth then why do you not believe
[59:52] me he that is of God hears God's words
[59:56] and ye therefore Hearth them not because
[59:58] ye are not of
[59:59] God and verse 48 and then answered the
[1:00:02] Jews and said unto him say that we say
[1:00:05] we not well that thou art a
[1:00:08] Samaritan hast thou have a
[1:00:12] devil here's the devil saying that God
[1:00:16] has a
[1:00:17] devil sounds like a politician or
[1:00:20] somebody you know when they accuse
[1:00:21] somebody else of a problem that's in
[1:00:23] it's always in their own life they're
[1:00:25] accusing exact same problem you
[1:00:41] know verse 49 sorry I lost my place and
[1:00:44] Jesus answered and said I have not a
[1:00:47] devil watch this watch watch this very
[1:00:50] closely please if you just catch this
[1:00:51] part just hold your thing but I honor my
[1:00:55] father and you are dishonoring
[1:01:00] me now when brother Dale preaches from
[1:01:03] here and you come here by free choice
[1:01:07] and I preach on adoption which is in the
[1:01:09] Bible in the message brother Brown said
[1:01:11] this he said adoption is not the baptism
[1:01:14] of the Holy Ghost he said it's
[1:01:16] positionally placing you in the body of
[1:01:19] Christ that's a direct quote I have them
[1:01:24] memorized and you go outside this place
[1:01:27] and you say something opposite of what I
[1:01:29] just preached you're in
[1:01:31] danger of
[1:01:35] Dale when I preach that you're going to
[1:01:37] be married here I was just listening to
[1:01:40] God Christ being revealed in God I've
[1:01:43] listened to it for a week every night
[1:01:45] going to sleep I relisten to it and
[1:01:48] relisten to it and relisten to it and I
[1:01:50] have a p I actually had to get up last
[1:01:51] night cuz my pencil was gone from my
[1:01:53] nightstand and I look at it when I
[1:01:55] something jumps at me and brother Bram
[1:01:57] and I write down the time and then I go
[1:01:59] look it up and brother Braham was saying
[1:02:01] in Christ revealed in God it's a 63 old7
[1:02:05] message somewhere in there and he was
[1:02:07] talking about he is the husband and we
[1:02:09] are the wife and we become
[1:02:12] impregnated with the Holy Spirit and
[1:02:14] when you become impregnated with the
[1:02:17] Holy Spirit even if you commit adultery
[1:02:20] you cannot take another
[1:02:23] seed now that's thus say the word of
[1:02:28] God and you go out in this
[1:02:31] property and you start contradicting
[1:02:36] that brother Dale don't do it I'll tell
[1:02:39] the deacons to do it and you will be no
[1:02:45] more because I didn't sacrifice my life
[1:02:49] savings buying this property every penny
[1:02:52] that I have on my line of credit is
[1:02:54] because I bought this church and I've
[1:02:56] tried to repair it for the glory of God
[1:02:58] to have the devil come in here and
[1:03:01] contradict what God's
[1:03:11] preaching you do dishonor
[1:03:14] me
[1:03:16] 53 verse 53 and then the Jews said unto
[1:03:20] him now we know that thou H has the
[1:03:22] devil because Abraham is dead and the
[1:03:25] prophets and thou
[1:03:26] sayest if a man keep my Saints he'll
[1:03:29] never taste death and let's jump to 55
[1:03:32] and finish this out here and he said yet
[1:03:35] ye have not known
[1:03:39] him it's talking about God but I know
[1:03:42] him and if I shall say that I know him
[1:03:44] not this is Jesus talking about Jehovah
[1:03:48] if I should say that I don't know God
[1:03:50] then it would make me a liar like you
[1:03:52] are but I know him and I keep his saying
[1:03:56] and your father Abraham rejoiced to see
[1:03:58] my day and he saw it and was glad and
[1:04:02] then said the Jews unto him Thou Art not
[1:04:06] yet 50 years old and H has seen Abraham
[1:04:09] and Jesus said unto them verily verely I
[1:04:12] say unto you before Abraham was I am and
[1:04:17] they picked up
[1:04:19] stones and cast it onto
[1:04:22] him hid himself and when went out from
[1:04:26] the Tabernacle going through the midst
[1:04:28] of
[1:04:29] them and so passed
[1:04:33] by you say brother Dale why are you
[1:04:36] bringing up this defac of atmosphere
[1:04:40] when you're preaching on
[1:04:41] atmosphere because Jesus
[1:04:46] did and when we get it
[1:04:49] corrected the atmosphere will be
[1:04:54] proper you know God's not the author of
[1:04:59] confusion amen if I'm a liar don't come
[1:05:04] here that's very
[1:05:06] simple God's truth is a
[1:05:09] liar that put you in a really bad spot
[1:05:17] but Galatians 5:1
[1:05:20] 1923 just laying we're almost finished
[1:05:23] we're just laying a nice Foundation here
[1:05:26] we're going
[1:05:28] to ain't that beautiful how you know
[1:05:31] people don't deal with situations I had
[1:05:33] a brother tell me and you know he was
[1:05:34] talking he said well you
[1:05:36] know you will always have all the guns
[1:05:39] are all on us we know the guns are on us
[1:05:44] but all Satan's guns are on you but you
[1:05:47] have a Haven of
[1:05:50] Rest okay and that's called the baptism
[1:05:54] of the Holy Ghost but then you have an
[1:05:56] Earthly Haven and that is a place that
[1:05:59] you Abode in like your home and you
[1:06:03] don't need to let people in your home
[1:06:05] that don't agree with you that are fers
[1:06:08] or abusive or you're not going to marry
[1:06:11] somebody that's going to beat the snot
[1:06:12] out of you or all this stuff and
[1:06:15] likewise is it in the house of
[1:06:22] God Amen
[1:06:26] let's read this Colossians 5:19 and now
[1:06:28] the works of the flesh are manifested in
[1:06:30] which are these adultery
[1:06:33] fornication uncleanness and ex levious
[1:06:36] living adultery witchcraft
[1:06:40] hatred and all you can see all these
[1:06:43] things here envy and murders dark
[1:06:45] drunkenness these are all of the flesh
[1:06:47] you know I I me just pull off from the
[1:06:49] scripture you know I was looking up
[1:06:52] nickan spirit and praise God for Google
[1:06:55] cuz it gives you a lot of scriptures you
[1:06:57] know the nickan spirit was it went right
[1:07:00] back into and I didn't put the scripture
[1:07:02] down because it didn't really apply but
[1:07:04] the nicod of the spirit is when the the
[1:07:06] the the the minister is pushing on the
[1:07:08] Ley but it can be the other way you know
[1:07:10] the Bible says don't muzzle the ox the
[1:07:12] Trump Thro the
[1:07:14] corn but the nickan spirit was when
[1:07:17] Israel was Abode that the man SLA with
[1:07:20] the women and committed
[1:07:21] adultery and when the I believe it was
[1:07:24] Moses but whoever it was that was in
[1:07:25] charge then come up and all the people
[1:07:28] that had done that were
[1:07:32] killed and it was a nickola the spirit
[1:07:35] because they were because of sin they
[1:07:37] were trying to force the
[1:07:40] preachers not to preach against
[1:07:43] it bless God you got the wrong man
[1:07:46] behind the pulpit CU none of you hired
[1:07:48] me God hired me
[1:07:53] first amen God help
[1:07:57] us shows all envy and murder drunkenness
[1:08:01] R all these things you can see this that
[1:08:03] they which do these things shall
[1:08:07] not inherit the kingdom of God
[1:08:13] not enviance
[1:08:17] hatred Strife if you Strife wrath you're
[1:08:20] not going to inherit the kingdom of God
[1:08:22] that's the Bible I know it's something
[1:08:24] that we don't read a lot anymore most
[1:08:27] people's home but most people's homes
[1:08:29] got like an inch of dust on them but
[1:08:31] maybe you read it on your phone like I
[1:08:33] do but it says if you're in Wrath and
[1:08:36] strife and all these things you're not
[1:08:37] inheriting the kingdom of God if you
[1:08:39] think you are you're deceived this is
[1:08:42] New Testament Bible I mean we don't need
[1:08:45] a message to know this I don't even need
[1:08:47] a prophet to identify this it's I just I
[1:08:49] just learned a little bit of English and
[1:08:52] failed grade one and couldn't spell
[1:08:53] nothing in grade two but I you
[1:08:58] know but watch this but 22 but the
[1:09:00] fruits of the spirit are
[1:09:04] left
[1:09:06] Joy even though I'm going through a
[1:09:08] trial I'm still happy praise God
[1:09:12] glory
[1:09:13] peace longsuffering even if I don't
[1:09:17] agree

[1:09:28] watch what brother Brown says this I'm
[1:09:29] going to shock you with this one this is
[1:09:30] the greatest quote ever he says I would
[1:09:33] rather have the word wrong and have the
[1:09:35] right
[1:09:38] atmosphere
[1:09:45] woo but bless God I'll come and debate
[1:09:47] I'll show you my five quotes if you come
[1:09:49] and show me my five Quotes no that ain't
[1:09:51] what he
[1:09:52] said that ain't what he said he said and
[1:09:54] when
[1:09:55] it gets to a spot that you can have
[1:09:58] tender love to every human
[1:10:00] being something happened to you for God
[1:10:04] so loved you when you were a sinner and
[1:10:07] an alien away from God and an enemy and

[1:11:48] theology you need to catch this one this
[1:11:51] is in this is by the way at 61 this is a
[1:11:54] late quote quote brother Brown didn't
[1:11:56] say this before he got great Revelations
[1:11:59] like the seals bless
[1:12:02] God this is after the seals this is
[1:12:04] after the breach message when the
[1:12:06] fullness of the godhead bodily had come
[1:12:09] down and he said if I've ever preached
[1:12:12] an inspired message like these seals it
[1:12:15] was these
[1:12:17] messages he said if you're correct in
[1:12:20] your theology and your motives and
[1:12:23] objectives are wrong
[1:12:26] I'd rather be wrong in my
[1:12:31] theology than be wrong in my
[1:12:34] heart that's right the spirit of God
[1:12:40] dwells in your
[1:12:45] heart so any of those spirits that are
[1:12:48] of the Flesh and they come

[1:16:46] the old word of God it's just it's only
[1:16:49] in the New Testament it's it's just the
[1:16:51] servant Paul that wrote it and you know
[1:16:53] he probably wasn't you probably got a
[1:16:55] greater Revelation than him and I
[1:16:58] understand all that stuff and but we'll
[1:17:00] just repeat it
[1:17:02] for sorry to bore
[1:17:06] you Ephesians
[1:17:10] 41 and he gave unto
[1:17:14] some and he gave unto some now who did
[1:17:17] the
[1:17:20] giv God God gave on to some let's go to
[1:17:25] the next
[1:17:26] verse for the perfecting of the
[1:17:30] Saints for the work of the
[1:17:34] ministry for the edifying of themselves
[1:17:40] oh for the edifying of the body of
[1:17:45] Christ till we all come into the unity
[1:17:48] of faith and the knowledge of the Son of
[1:17:51] God unto a perfect man unto the man
[1:17:54] measure and stature of the fullness of
[1:17:58] Christ let's stop there let's go back to
[1:18:01] verse
[1:18:02] 11 and he gave unto
[1:18:08] some let's go to verse 14 that we might
[1:18:12] henceforth be no more
[1:18:15] babies on Mama's mou toss to and fro
[1:18:18] carried about by every Revelation that
[1:18:21] God thinks you gave to you that you
[1:18:24] think think God maybe gave to you but he
[1:18:26] didn't give it to the five-fold ministry
[1:18:28] he gave it to the you know God is a
[1:18:30] decent businessman and when God gave the
[1:18:32] five-fold ministry it's unlikely that
[1:18:34] he'll give a revelation to Curtis or
[1:18:36] ilot ahead of the five-fold ministry I
[1:18:39] don't mean that God can't talk to them
[1:18:42] oh I'm not saying that but
[1:18:45] I but I'm just saying he
[1:18:51] gave oh he can speak to anybody that's
[1:18:53] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's
[1:18:55] only God that woes you on to Christ but
[1:18:58] he
[1:19:05] gave henceforth be no more children
[1:19:07] tossed to and fro and carried about by
[1:19:09] every windy Doctrine by the Sligh of men
[1:19:13] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[1:19:17] in waight to deceive thee now I'm going
[1:19:19] to tell you what they might wait lie
[1:19:21] wait to deceive thee but it ain't going
[1:19:23] to be on this property
[1:19:26] it's not going to be not as long as I'm
[1:19:28] breathing it won't be on this property
[1:19:30] and I hope that part that my kids inher
[1:19:33] and Us in her because I could go and
[1:19:35] brother Carson could be the pastor
[1:19:37] brother mad amen they're going to take
[1:19:39] the services when I go to
[1:19:41] Salvador and whoever else God
[1:19:47] leads they lay weight to deceive
[1:19:54] see it's like this church it's it's very
[1:19:57] very very simple things are very simple
[1:19:59] in life like if if if a minister
[1:20:02] preaches
[1:20:03] something okay whether you like it or
[1:20:06] not and then somebody else has a
[1:20:08] different Doctrine one of the two are
[1:20:11] wrong and it's up to you to
[1:20:14] decide but there to leave them
[1:20:19] together God's not the author of
[1:20:20] confusion so it's not possible that they
[1:20:22] could come together two can't watch
[1:20:24] together unless they agree so there's
[1:20:25] people that brother Dale don't have
[1:20:27] fellowship with because they're just
[1:20:28] plain don't
[1:20:29] agree okay you know what I'm saying like
[1:20:33] if I invite you all over for breakfast I
[1:20:35] don't invite some people
[1:20:39] because we don't agree you'll notice
[1:20:42] there's churches that never invite us or
[1:20:44] Fellowship it's because we're not
[1:20:49] agreeable that's not
[1:20:51] wrong it's just you have the total right
[1:20:54] brother brother Brown said this that you
[1:20:56] as a Believer should know those the
[1:20:58] Bible says know those that labor among
[1:20:59] you but he said you have the right to
[1:21:02] choose the pastor of the home church
[1:21:05] that has the doctrine that you feel
[1:21:06] comfortable with and even the
[1:21:08] environment and and personality that
[1:21:12] that dovetails with your life you might
[1:21:15] like a skinny Pastor that laughs all the
[1:21:17] time or or a tall giant or you have that
[1:21:23] right but you do not have the
[1:21:27] right to touch God's
[1:21:29] anointed and do my profits no harm you
[1:21:32] don't have that
[1:21:34] right and
[1:21:37] I God help us verse 15 but speaking the
[1:21:41] truth in love may we grow up in him when
[1:21:45] all things which are the head Christ see
[1:21:49] the five-fold ministry is not the head
[1:21:52] it's Christ if I preach anything but the
[1:21:55] Bible and the message and Christ I'm
[1:21:59] wrong but it's not up to you to correct
[1:22:02] me it's just up to you to
[1:22:04] leave brother Brown said things like
[1:22:07] this that if you chose to come
[1:22:10] here I have this I have this is this
[1:22:13] okay is it okay to quote brother Brown
[1:22:16] he said if I choose to leave you in into
[1:22:19] a Jehovah's Witness Doctrine and you're
[1:22:21] okay with it you just stay right on with
[1:22:23] me
[1:22:28] that's what your Prophet
[1:22:30] said now I can assure you brother Dale
[1:22:33] ain't going there that that's like just
[1:22:36] but that's what the prophet
[1:22:39] said but you don't have the right to try
[1:22:41] to change my Jehovah's Witness
[1:22:43] Doctrine you have the right to choose to
[1:22:46] stay or to leave but you don't have the
[1:22:49] right to change my now that is exactly
[1:22:51] what our Prophet said
[1:22:58] [Applause]
[1:23:02] amen man that was hard to get
[1:23:10] out verse 16 from whom the body is fitly
[1:23:13] joined together and compacted by which
[1:23:16] every joint is supplied according to the
[1:23:18] effectual working working and measure of
[1:23:21] every part making increase the body
[1:23:25] until the edifying of
[1:23:28] itself in
[1:23:42] love
[1:23:45] amen I'm not done but I'm going to
[1:23:49] stop I have something I'm going to print
[1:23:51] off
[1:23:52] here it's not going to be up today
[1:23:55] but it's going to be
[1:23:56] up out in the
[1:23:59] hall and it's going to basically say
[1:24:02] this on this church
[1:24:05] property there's no talking or
[1:24:08] discussing or ministering on the Bible
[1:24:10] or the
[1:24:11] message unless you've been invited by me
[1:24:15] or you are
[1:24:19] me 1 Corinthians 14:33 for God is not
[1:24:22] the author of confusion but of Peace as
[1:24:25] in all
[1:24:28] churches of the Saints see God actually
[1:24:31] likes Church peace in all the churches
[1:24:34] because of the Saints praise
[1:24:37] God yeah 1 Corinthians
[1:24:40] 14 1 Corinthians
[1:24:44] 14:33 but of Peace as in all
[1:24:48] churches of the
[1:24:50] Saints but we are happy to encourage
[1:24:53] Fellowship you can come to my house
[1:24:55] every morning for breakfast we normally
[1:24:57] have baby breakfast sausages normally
[1:24:59] have a whole slew of eggs we buy 10
[1:25:01] dozen eggs at a time or more you know
[1:25:04] and we normally have potatoes because
[1:25:05] we're not really R race
[1:25:08] people but we welcome lots of Fellowship
[1:25:12] you can't have too much fellowship with
[1:25:14] the family of God that's not possible
[1:25:17] well I guess brother Brown did say you
[1:25:19] could do everything too much but pray
[1:25:21] but in our world we don't have too much
[1:25:25] Fellowship no
[1:25:28] no we welcome lots and lots of
[1:25:31] Fellowship but we're not going to give
[1:25:34] way for
[1:25:36] confusion or a Pulpit for the
[1:25:42] devil because the devil never helped pay
[1:25:45] for this
[1:25:46] place and it's definitely not dedicated
[1:25:49] to
[1:25:50] him and
[1:25:52] so Ephesians
[1:25:56] 427 says neither give a
[1:26:00] place for the
[1:26:03] devil we need to pull that one up
[1:26:07] Amy and if anyone's found doing this
[1:26:10] giving a place to the devil they're
[1:26:13] going to be asked to
[1:26:15] stop and if they don't they're going to
[1:26:18] be asked to
[1:26:22] leave now in Jesus case he was the one
[1:26:26] that
[1:26:28] left in my
[1:26:31] case it's
[1:26:34] different and Jesus the reason Jesus
[1:26:36] left was he said this world is not my
[1:26:38] home if it was I would fight for
[1:26:43] it but he said I could call 10,000
[1:26:46] Legions of
[1:26:48] angels to destroy the world and set me
[1:26:51] free but this world wasn't his kingdom
[1:26:55] neither is this world my kingdom but God
[1:26:58] has chose to bless us with this price to
[1:27:02] edify and magnify the bride of Christ
[1:27:05] glorify Christ and even in our shortcom
[1:27:10] failures we're still going to have the
[1:27:12] fivefold ministry on a regular basis
[1:27:15] John brother John Garrett is coming
[1:27:17] October
[1:27:18] 13th and he'll be here on Saturday and
[1:27:21] we can party huge on Saturday Fellowship
[1:27:25] amen Saturday night and John Garrett
[1:27:28] October
[1:27:32] 13th that's a nice scripture to end on
[1:27:34] ain't
[1:27:46] it
[1:27:49] amen amen go be on to something new
[1:27:52] whatever God has for us if you want want
[1:27:54] me to preach on something you ask God
[1:27:55] about
[1:27:56] it because God's
[1:27:58] Supernatural oh man I start out and I
[1:28:01] just like boom boom boom
[1:28:04] boom I love preaching on being his wife
[1:28:08] being impregnated where I could never
[1:28:10] loose going home to live with him
[1:28:15] predestination I mean those are things
[1:28:16] the Rapture I mean how could you not
[1:28:19] want to go in the Rapture and you'd
[1:28:20] rather stay here and see the gifts of
[1:28:21] the Spirit how could you not want to be
[1:28:23] the wife and only be a bride when what
[1:28:25] the wife can sign on the checkbook how
[1:28:28] could you not want to be adopted so
[1:28:29] you're positionally placed like the son
[1:28:31] where he was inherit
[1:28:36] everything that means I get all of God
[1:28:42] 100% like brother Brown said the spirit
[1:28:44] of Christ is in everyone that's got the
[1:28:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost the exact
[1:28:49] exactly the same
[1:28:52] identical Holy Spirit
[1:28:56] so we could read the scripture in John 1
[1:29:00] what is it 20 or something or 13 where
[1:29:04] he became
[1:29:06] flesh and he's still flesh walking Among
[1:29:10] Us let's
[1:29:12] stand we're going to sing that song we
[1:29:14] have come into his house to magnify his
[1:29:16] name and worship Him
[1:29:23] Hallelujah e
[1:30:20] equ
[1:30:29] at least equally because if without you
[1:30:32] can be the seed of God now he will never
[1:30:34] allow this to happen but he would have
[1:30:37] to move you out of the way and speak
[1:30:38] through a donkey to create an atmosphere
[1:30:41] because he couldn't lose any of the
[1:30:43] seeds that are in his hand so if we
[1:30:46] being donkeys in this church can't
[1:30:48] create enough atmosphere for my kids to
[1:30:50] come back or your kids to come back or
[1:30:52] even the Town come back God will move us
[1:30:54] out of the way and bring another donkey
[1:30:57] in that'll create an
[1:30:59] atmosphere because he won't lose the
[1:31:02] seed but he will hell you live he will
[1:31:06] judge you eternally for not creating the
[1:31:09] atmosphere for the seed that he places
[1:31:11] in your
[1:31:12] life so I want to just tell you
[1:31:14] something I just happened to have a
[1:31:17] really awesome daddy that was an amazing
[1:31:20] prosperous
[1:31:22] farmer and you can't cannot be seed it
[1:31:25] is not possible to be
[1:31:28] seed and place in a growing atmosphere
[1:31:32] and you can hate God as much as you want
[1:31:33] you can hate me as much as you want and
[1:31:36] it don't matter how much your hatred is
[1:31:39] if the atmosphere is
[1:31:41] correct you will grow period remember
[1:31:46] the
[1:31:47] sidewalk where brother Braham talked
[1:31:49] about they poured sidewalk and poured
[1:31:50] concrete over every they did everything
[1:31:52] to hide the seed from the
[1:31:55] [Music]
[1:31:58] son you can't stop
[1:32:01] seed you might be a seed of God here
[1:32:03] this morning say I'm going to go my own
[1:32:05] way I'm going to do my own thing I'm
[1:32:09] young and I'm going to spread my wings
[1:32:11] and I'm going to set the town on
[1:32:14] fire I just tell you
[1:32:17] something if you're a seed of
[1:32:20] God God will create an atmosphere
[1:32:24] it won't matter if you're carried by
[1:32:26] tens of thousands of years of bad
[1:32:29] choices in your life don't matter if you
[1:32:32] got a foundation buried under the
[1:32:34] deepest part of
[1:32:36] Hell God will put that condition for
[1:32:39] that seed to grow do you know do you
[1:32:42] want me to tell you something I grow elf
[1:32:44] Alpha and they have actually discovered
[1:32:46] elf Alpha roots in
[1:32:49] caves
[1:32:50] caves multiple hundreds of feet
[1:32:55] deep if you're the seat of God you can
[1:32:58] try to run from
[1:33:00] God good look because it's a law it's a
[1:33:05] natural law under the condition you will
