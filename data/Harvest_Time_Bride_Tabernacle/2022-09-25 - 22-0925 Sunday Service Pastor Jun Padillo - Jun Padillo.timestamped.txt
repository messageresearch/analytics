[32:14] a long time and we just pray that God
[32:16] will bless everybody we're just honored
[32:18] to have Pastor June but just before our
[32:20] pastor comes we want to show you some
[32:22] things we talked about last week and so
[32:24] uh um first off we're going to show you
[32:27] we didn't talk about this last week but
[32:29] we want to show you some things that you
[32:31] are doing as a body of Christ and just
[32:33] for we're not trying to take pastors
[32:35] time he's he's got his Liberty to to
[32:38] preach all that God wants them to we got
[32:40] lots of time this is Pastor Long Dong
[32:42] from the Philippines and if you can make
[32:45] that bigger that would be awesome but
[32:47] this is uh that's a very maybe better if
[32:50] you could see in the middle of that
[32:51] picture sister luanne's in there
[32:53] and Amy I believe Amy's in there but
[32:57] that's a bamboo church I preached that
[32:59] in Mindanao
[33:02] in the Philippines
[33:03] and after that a typhoon took it down
[33:06] and by the way when we say that just
[33:08] remember the Philippines right now they
[33:09] have a typhoon going through right now
[33:12] Pastor he's talked to his wife this
[33:14] morning since we got to church
[33:16] and it's the highest rated typhoon
[33:19] they have never raided it for never
[33:22] they've always been a three
[33:24] they've never read it before
[33:26] amen but a typhoon took this down and so
[33:29] by the grace of God you can go to the
[33:30] next picture we were able to uh build
[33:33] this little building for him a brick
[33:34] building and a steel roof and so it
[33:37] keeps them dry and rainy season we've
[33:39] never finished the windows or doors or
[33:41] that but we were able to do this so I'm
[33:43] going somewhere with this next picture
[33:44] so we had sent money for that's another
[33:47] picture of the church that God helped us
[33:49] put together for him
[33:52] um next pitcher so we had helped he put
[33:54] a parsonage right beside the church and
[33:56] it had no roof and so I sent him some
[33:59] money from the church maybe six months
[34:01] ago and we had did the back half of the
[34:03] roof and by God's grace we had enough
[34:06] that we could finish the roof on his
[34:09] parsonage so there is a steal that you
[34:12] brothers and sisters bought last week
[34:15] for a pastor in Manila in the
[34:18] Philippines for the front half of his
[34:20] house
[34:21] amen and now he he's promised he said
[34:24] I'll send you more pictures when this is
[34:25] on the roof you know we didn't send this
[34:27] till Monday I don't know if there's
[34:28] another one and then there's another
[34:31] picture of the the churches beside it
[34:33] the block building the parsonage is the
[34:35] White House when we were there 100 no
[34:39] 100 of the buildings
[34:42] were bamboo
[34:44] 100 except a little room
[34:47] when I asked the ministers that I would
[34:49] go to the restroom or the washroom or
[34:52] what or they call it the comfort room
[34:55] it's not the comfort room in that
[34:57] country
[34:58] it's
[34:59] called the washroom there or something
[35:01] that was the only building that was not
[35:03] bamboo it was the only concrete block
[35:06] but anyway is there another picture
[35:09] okay and then uh so we have more
[35:11] pictures there and then there's uh then
[35:13] so last Sunday we brought a need of a
[35:16] pastor
[35:17] in uh Uganda that his wife's appendix
[35:22] had ruptured and we were taking them out
[35:24] and we uh we had more than enough people
[35:28] give of you brothers and sisters to this
[35:31] is a sister in the hospital
[35:33] his wife next picture
[35:35] that's her with a lady nurse with her
[35:38] and then so I had the brother I had him
[35:41] I actually this message just says at the
[35:43] top of that message it just says give me
[35:45] the name of the hospital she's in her
[35:47] bed number and you know just for
[35:49] clarification imagine so that's the next
[35:51] one we can go to the next one and that's
[35:53] them back in their house you'll see his
[35:55] wife is still covered with the sheet
[35:57] amen and she was back home by God's
[36:00] grace
[36:01] because in part because of you brothers
[36:05] and sisters that have give

[43:45] Pastor Dale and everyone I I hope and
[43:48] pray that God will bless us this morning
[43:51] now I would like to talk to you this
[43:53] morning about this subject
[43:55] you know I hope you see it God create
[43:59] himself
[44:00] so that out of himself he can create all
[44:04] things
[44:07] amen God create himself so that out of
[44:11] himself
[44:12] he can create all
[44:14] things and the scripture that we have
[44:17] real while ago is talking about
[44:20] verse 9 let all the nation be gathered
[44:22] together
[44:23] and that the people be assembled among
[44:25] them
[44:27] then there was a question right there
[44:29] who among them can declare this
[44:32] and show us four more things
[44:35] let them bring forth
[44:37] their Witnesses
[44:39] do that then they may be justified
[44:42] or let them hear
[44:44] and see it is true
[44:47] then verse 10 ye are my Witnesses
[44:50] now you can be a witness without being
[44:53] there
[44:55] I mean you know I used to I used to be a
[44:58] small judge you know in our in our
[45:01] community
[45:02] I I encounter different kind of cases
[45:06] and uh the witness must be present
[45:10] I mean when when things happen
[45:13] okay so you must be there you must be
[45:17] there and he said you are my Witnesses
[45:20] said the Lord and my servant how I
[45:22] believe whom I chosen
[45:24] so the witness was already chosen
[45:28] that you may know
[45:31] the first component yet me know
[45:33] and believe
[45:35] and understand
[45:37] not just knowing not just believing but
[45:41] you must understand I mean because there
[45:45] are people believe
[45:47] and there were people know him
[45:49] amen now that there is God everyone know
[45:52] that that there is God but everyone must
[45:55] come into the knowledge of understanding
[45:58] and there were people try to learn and
[45:59] learn and learn and learn and Paul said
[46:01] to Timothy said ever learning but they
[46:03] will never come into the knowledge of
[46:05] understanding
[46:06] oh I'm sorry I talked fast
[46:09] I want to talk slowly you know would I
[46:11] be excited
[46:13] yeah
[46:14] I wanted
[46:16] to speak slowly I'm sorry for that then
[46:19] right here
[46:21] then before me there was no God
[46:27] form
[46:28] meaning before God come into existence
[46:32] it seems that God
[46:34] before his existed he wasn't there but
[46:37] no we know that God is there
[46:40] the self-existing God was there
[46:44] okay and he wants us to know
[46:47] that this time he said before me there
[46:50] was no God form okay so God had a form
[46:54] before he didn't have formed
[46:57] but God wants to have form
[47:00] amen Nadal shall be after me
[47:03] so there are no other God that was
[47:06] formed
[47:07] neither shall there be after him that
[47:10] was formed that's why I would like to
[47:13] talk that God create himself God formed
[47:16] God create himself so that out of him
[47:19] out of himself he can you know create
[47:23] all
[47:24] all things I hope the Lord will guide
[47:26] help us and I hope oh God I almost two
[47:30] months here and
[47:32] in in Canada I'm just two weeks in the
[47:35] U.S
[47:37] and uh here oh I almost one month and
[47:41] another
[47:42] another another two weeks so almost two
[47:45] months oh I hope the Lord and I saw God
[47:48] moving you know and I saw him guiding
[47:51] you know almost every day Pastor that
[47:54] we've been talking about the goodness of
[47:55] God
[47:56] I know it's so good to know that because
[48:00] yeah oh
[48:03] Hallelujah now let me just I would like
[48:07] to I would like to
[48:09] uh lay a foundation about these thoughts
[48:12] why God
[48:14] create himself
[48:16] all these things we do not know these
[48:18] things I mean never I'm bad never coming
[48:21] to the knowledge of all this that we're
[48:23] talking about we don't know because we
[48:26] were not there
[48:28] amen our existence is right here but we
[48:31] were there but not there
[48:35] we were not there but we were there
[48:37] because we are here
[48:39] it seems that we are there but not there
[48:43] so there was there was a very thin line
[48:47] between this this natural and
[48:50] Supernatural
[48:52] this this the celestial and the
[48:54] terrestrial
[48:55] but that you know that connection that
[49:00] that that God wants to wants us to
[49:02] realize
[49:03] okay he wants us to know so may the Lord
[49:07] help me and help you because as you pull
[49:11] something you know God just you know
[49:13] Channel it
[49:15] I mean behind the small pit praise God
[49:18] that all your maybe your question and
[49:21] your your thoughts maybe Express right
[49:24] here and your question will be answered
[49:27] so I want to talk about the uh the this
[49:29] object and the and the predicates of all
[49:33] this objects would be known
[49:35] amen I hope and pray that all the
[49:38] predicates of this subject because
[49:41] predicates talks about you know the
[49:44] subject
[49:45] amen I'm not a grammarian so now I just
[49:48] I just talk about simple things you know
[49:51] so that we can see the great things
[49:52] because that's the way of God that's the
[49:54] way of God if we will if you will see
[49:57] something great then you're gonna say
[49:58] because it's already great but it will
[50:00] just talk some simple things we can say
[50:03] the great things of God
[50:05] amen because that's really how he unfold
[50:07] himself God rebuilt himself in
[50:09] simplicity so that we can see him in his
[50:12] greatness and His glory
[50:14] amen so these things we did that this
[50:17] before but praise God because the Bible
[50:19] is in Romans 3 verse 10 okay
[50:22] praise that it is written there is none
[50:25] righteous
[50:27] no not one
[50:29] there is none that understand it
[50:32] there is none that seeketh after God
[50:37] they are all gone out of the way they
[50:41] are together become unfit unprofitable
[50:44] there is not do it good no not one
[50:50] so no one seeketh God
[50:52] no one can understand God because he was
[50:54] so great
[50:56] he felt heaven on Earth he was a great
[51:00] Jehovah God in the Old Testament I
[51:02] remember
[51:03] he was the Jehovah that Jehovah is one
[51:06] of the attributes
[51:08] one of his you know one Jehovah is say
[51:11] he say is what we say a
[51:14] immacral terminology it's a it's it's a
[51:19] generic name that's not the proper name
[51:21] of God there were seven confound them of
[51:23] Jehovah the Old Testament
[51:27] on all these things he said the proper
[51:30] name of God so that Jehovah and the Old
[51:32] Testament is the Jesus Christ in the New
[51:35] Testament
[51:36] although there were people so happy in
[51:38] the Old Testament and until now they
[51:39] were still there in the Old Testament
[51:40] but they are they are here
[51:43] you say that just embracing the shadow
[51:46] they don't want the reality
[51:49] so they were just embracing the shadow
[51:51] but praise God by the grace of God we
[51:53] have seen that and now embracing the
[51:55] reality of all the Shadows amen so God
[51:58] said that we are all I mean no one
[52:01] understanded God as it is written there
[52:04] is none that understand that there is
[52:06] not that secret God there is none
[52:08] righteous
[52:11] so why why we come up into this
[52:13] understanding if there's no righteous
[52:16] why what did God do what he did for us
[52:19] because in that next verse 23 Romans 23
[52:23] for all have seen
[52:25] and come short of the glory of God now
[52:29] let me just die sick this verse verse
[52:34] 23. okay I hope the Lord will help me
[52:37] and help us
[52:38] for all have sinned past tense
[52:42] all
[52:43] as I said no one is righteous there is
[52:46] none righteous no even one
[52:50] you know
[52:52] because for all have sinned and come
[52:55] short of the glory of that the word come
[52:58] shirt means
[53:00] you have the glory before
[53:03] but you lose it
[53:05] you lose it
[53:07] so this time we'd like to speak simple
[53:09] things
[53:10] basic things
[53:12] but sometimes basic is just you know
[53:14] will lead you to a
[53:16] deeper things
[53:18] amen the ABC
[53:21] they always believe Christ ABC not the
[53:26] ABC alphabet
[53:28] but whatever it takes whatever it takes
[53:31] you always believe God
[53:33] thick or tense
[53:35] have or nothing still believing God
[53:38] that's ABC
[53:40] healthy or not healthy still you believe
[53:43] God that ABC
[53:45] amen rain or no rain that's ABC
[53:48] summer or winter that ABC
[53:51] because you always believed God
[53:54] okay then he said for all meaning oh
[53:58] that's a Double L all
[54:01] hub
[54:03] sent
[54:04] past tense
[54:05] and come shirt of the glory of God
[54:10] now before now we we are all born in
[54:14] sins
[54:16] and shipping inequity
[54:19] speaking lies
[54:22] amen
[54:23] now sisters when you bring forth your
[54:26] child
[54:28] did he see your child lapping after you
[54:31] deliver a baby
[54:35] is a child laughing after you deliver
[54:39] he's crying
[54:41] yeah
[54:43] cry why
[54:45] why
[54:47] but because
[54:51] job talking about that he said all that
[54:54] was born by woman
[54:56] are full of trouble and Beauty so you
[54:59] know Furious meaning
[55:02] all that was born of a woman
[55:04] is full of trouble
[55:07] see
[55:08] he said and even hit cars you know even
[55:11] even job he calls his birthday
[55:15] and sometimes we have spend money for
[55:18] our birthday now I'm not against
[55:19] birthday next week will be my birthday
[55:21] you are invited
[55:24] yeah
[55:25] let the people especially when the age
[55:28] of Liberty came
[55:30] you know the age of Liberty
[55:33] Ethan
[55:34] oh I'm now a lady I'm the Man I'm a
[55:37] young now I'm fully young I'm a
[55:40] oh and sometimes we spent more money
[55:42] about it but but you cars his birthday
[55:53] so now the reason why God
[55:58] wants to redesign you
[56:02] he wants you to recreate you okay
[56:05] because the first creation we have
[56:08] you know
[56:10] he's a sinner
[56:12] okay
[56:13] for all I've seen that's why the Bible
[56:16] said
[56:18] we are all captured of the glory
[56:21] That Glory that was in the hands of our
[56:24] father is lost
[56:28] he found it when you lose it
[56:31] the glory
[56:33] and when the glory was you know was lost
[56:37] all that was born
[56:40] is under cars
[56:42] do you know that sisters
[56:46] you know that you have the seven cycle
[56:49] the first cycle is the first seven years
[56:51] the second cycle is second year the
[56:53] second cycle is third is the 21 years
[56:56] old
[56:58] and the last cycle is 49 something like
[57:00] that
[57:02] okay and you know uh
[57:05] uh our body
[57:07] is different from your body
[57:10] you know why
[57:11] the woman is
[57:14] uh when they have when they start
[57:18] bringing forth children
[57:20] your body start to defile
[57:23] you know you know that if you are a
[57:26] Coca-Cola body I mean small hips and
[57:29] then but we start bringing four children
[57:31] then
[57:33] you are become healthy
[57:36] that's a good term healthy meaning
[57:39] winning
[57:40] yeah why you know why
[57:43] because the Bible says so
[57:47] that sin you know that was in you that
[57:50] was in US
[57:51] defile this body
[57:53] and the women leaders women is is easily
[57:57] defiled when they start to bring forth
[57:59] children
[58:04] the men the men the the male the male
[58:07] part even though we are already you know
[58:10] or rather you see that still young
[58:14] I'm 64. but still you know
[58:19] just kidding just to make you not that's
[58:23] why because the cars that we have is not
[58:24] directly but the woman was direct you
[58:27] know was direct it was the womb of the
[58:30] woman was Cars
[58:33] ectopic pregnancy they have cancer
[58:37] because God cars because of that sin
[58:40] that we have from the beginning
[58:43] it's because aim you know
[58:45] because of what she did in the beginning
[58:49] I mean when when Adam hit the fruit of
[58:51] the ground then the cars start to enter
[58:55] in our body
[58:58] male male creation but but the female
[59:02] creation was direct directly cars by God
[59:05] that's why when you bring forth your
[59:07] children it's so hard tough and almost
[59:10] almost my my wife almost you know with
[59:13] the first born that we have
[59:16] Sister Abigail and holding his neck
[59:19] right here he almost destroyed my you
[59:21] know
[59:21] it's so hard because that's
[59:25] the cause of God but praise God praise
[59:28] God
[59:29] the firstborn that we have
[59:32] is not enough to go to heaven
[59:35] that's why this verse I would like to
[59:37] dissect this like I hope the Lord will
[59:39] help us and I hope the Lord will you
[59:41] know give us an understanding about this
[59:43] okay
[59:45] so something lost
[59:48] from human race
[59:50] That Glory
[59:52] there was a pastor when I when I when I
[59:55] have a seminar with the pastors from the
[59:57] denomination
[59:59] I asked them I said
[1:00:02] Jesus came and redeemed us
[1:00:05] what was Adam lost our father
[1:00:08] all things that Adam lost
[1:00:12] promised Authority promise right
[1:00:15] to the Earth this Earth this Earth hello
[1:00:17] said
[1:00:19] and he strike his Dominion lose it
[1:00:23] and his godship godship being the small
[1:00:26] God he was the god of the physical
[1:00:28] creation he lose it
[1:00:31] he lost every bit of it
[1:00:34] you know the the you know the uh what we
[1:00:37] call this mosquitoes the mosquitoes
[1:00:39] before the no dinghy
[1:00:41] no virus
[1:00:43] but when the cars came the lion did not
[1:00:46] eat
[1:00:47] animals
[1:00:48] now the crocodile did not eat no they
[1:00:52] have they have food for them
[1:00:54] the lion they have food for them but
[1:00:57] when man fall their God the small God
[1:01:00] was full uh you see that the lion kills
[1:01:04] buffalo
[1:01:05] deer everything
[1:01:08] and everything was full
[1:01:11] Now That Glory that's generic terminal
[1:01:13] the word Glory it could be salvation it
[1:01:17] could be your peace it could be you can
[1:01:19] name it so man lost from where he was
[1:01:22] man is out of his possession
[1:01:26] amen the thing that God gave to him that
[1:01:30] he must possess it he lose it
[1:01:33] he looks at everything that God given
[1:01:35] even you know now eternal life did not
[1:01:38] lost from Adam it was Adam lost from
[1:01:41] eternal life
[1:01:42] you're going to lose eternal life
[1:01:44] because it's it's Eternal no you're
[1:01:46] gonna lose that so Adam lost from
[1:01:49] eternal life the prophet said the Bible
[1:01:51] said that Adam perfected every bit of it
[1:01:55] the three Realms of Adam was you know
[1:01:58] lost
[1:01:59] his title did today Earth
[1:02:02] this Earth this Earth is lost
[1:02:05] you know before he can speak the
[1:02:07] mountain and transfer it to another in
[1:02:10] fact he named all the creation I mean
[1:02:13] the physical creation
[1:02:15] he named after the the nature of an
[1:02:18] animals when he called the lion is a
[1:02:20] lion is really a lion because
[1:02:23] Adam knew the nature
[1:02:25] when he's when he called the name
[1:02:27] Buffalo he knows that a hard worker
[1:02:30] Buffalo when he when he called the name
[1:02:32] it's a cow because a burdenberry I don't
[1:02:35] know it
[1:02:36] so that authority over the creation was
[1:02:39] lost
[1:02:42] okay now when Adam lost
[1:02:45] these three things the three the the his
[1:02:48] rights to the Earth his Dominion
[1:02:52] and he lost
[1:02:54] his rights to eternal life
[1:02:57] so this thing is so something something
[1:03:00] uh something deeper I I want to speak
[1:03:03] shallow because Adam we know he was
[1:03:07] created in the image of God
[1:03:09] and he had eternal life he was not
[1:03:11] mortal but right after
[1:03:14] he commits sin he become like as we are
[1:03:17] mortal and we're going into immortality
[1:03:19] but Adam he was Immortal but going to
[1:03:22] mortality
[1:03:23] that something is something deeper but I
[1:03:26] hope we because of the cars
[1:03:30] because for all have sinned
[1:03:32] that Romans straight to the tree
[1:03:35] actually we are just the product of that
[1:03:38] verse
[1:03:40] but the one who commits sin is Our
[1:03:42] Father Abraham
[1:03:43] I know Adam we were in his loins right
[1:03:46] here
[1:03:48] and we were also in the loins of God
[1:03:51] every man male man we have two loins the
[1:03:56] first loan we have is our thoughts loins
[1:04:00] loins of the spirit okay mind
[1:04:03] then the physical is
[1:04:07] loins we have sons and daughters
[1:04:11] that's why God wants to express this
[1:04:15] these things from his loins from his
[1:04:17] mind so Adam
[1:04:20] right after the fool that's why
[1:04:23] if you can just
[1:04:25] if we have just timer to draw the outer
[1:04:29] man's body
[1:04:30] and the second one is the spirit and the
[1:04:32] Third Realm is the soul okay so all his
[1:04:36] rights from these three Realms was
[1:04:38] totally lost
[1:04:40] lost now when he lose it
[1:04:44] when you lose it
[1:04:45] someone squat this body
[1:04:50] I will okay I don't want to read it
[1:04:52] because you know my time will be
[1:04:54] consumed you know someone you know you
[1:04:57] know that what is squatter he poached
[1:04:59] her
[1:05:00] someone squat this body
[1:05:03] it's no longer the owner
[1:05:05] of the body
[1:05:07] you know if you have if you have a house
[1:05:11] and you let them rent
[1:05:13] the renter will not take care about the
[1:05:15] house
[1:05:16] but if you're really the owner
[1:05:19] you're going to take care of it
[1:05:22] feed it once in the morning dress it in
[1:05:25] the morning make it grow me you know
[1:05:27] because you're the owner of the house
[1:05:29] but this quarter came
[1:05:32] you know
[1:05:35] and put all these things I'm sorry if
[1:05:37] you have this I'm not I'm not referring
[1:05:39] to you
[1:05:41] Mark there tattoo here
[1:05:43] faster
[1:05:44] everything because they are not
[1:05:47] really the original owner of the house
[1:05:50] I'm sorry is there anybody here tattoo
[1:05:54] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not referring to
[1:05:57] you I'm talking about this quarter of
[1:06:00] this house
[1:06:02] okay so I'm talking about the literal
[1:06:05] house and talking to the this house that
[1:06:07] we have
[1:06:08] okay now someone scored this
[1:06:12] squat this house
[1:06:14] okay now God wants to
[1:06:18] you know
[1:06:20] restore back to the owner
[1:06:22] that's why the word here
[1:06:24] all have seen and come short meaning
[1:06:26] meaning that glory is no longer in the
[1:06:29] hands of men
[1:06:33] now we can we can Define the word
[1:06:35] redemption or restoration
[1:06:38] atonement because we we must believe
[1:06:42] that something lost
[1:06:45] amen
[1:06:47] you must believe that something
[1:06:50] is in the pawn shop
[1:06:53] it's no longer in your possession
[1:06:56] and you cannot you cannot redeem it
[1:06:59] it has to do with the Redeemer
[1:07:02] say
[1:07:04] uh
[1:07:05] the cross is right there
[1:07:07] so you can see the cross is empty
[1:07:09] because he wasn't there anymore
[1:07:13] he wasn't there anymore I said the crown
[1:07:15] of thorn right there inside
[1:07:19] you see so someone squat this land
[1:07:25] amen now uh
[1:07:29] I hope I can consume all your your time
[1:07:32] okay
[1:07:34] I was just making a foundation
[1:07:38] making a foundation I hope the Lord will
[1:07:41] help me okay now
[1:07:44] there was a day that the time
[1:07:47] that the owner of the land must come
[1:07:51] now I would like to share something
[1:07:54] the type and Shadow
[1:07:57] you know
[1:07:58] praise God now
[1:08:01] Israel
[1:08:02] most of the Israelites was born in Egypt
[1:08:06] that's why Egyptian was so insecure
[1:08:09] because they become overpowered of this
[1:08:11] you know
[1:08:13] on some day
[1:08:14] the Chinese growing up in Canada
[1:08:20] yeah even in Auckland and New Zealand
[1:08:22] the Chinese growing up
[1:08:24] if you're in the Philippines
[1:08:26] growing up okay
[1:08:29] and you know I don't want to tell the
[1:08:31] story about it so
[1:08:35] someone really owned this land
[1:08:39] and other Adam lost it
[1:08:42] and Adam could you know Adam tried to
[1:08:45] get back
[1:08:48] but he was not qualified
[1:08:50] it's just like
[1:08:53] it's just like the brother of Boaz I
[1:08:55] know if you remember it
[1:08:57] uh that eliminate
[1:09:02] eliminate both set to offer to eliminate
[1:09:05] because he was the firstborn
[1:09:08] but eliminix said I can do it
[1:09:10] if I do that
[1:09:12] militants my inheritance will be mired
[1:09:16] marred meeting in trouble
[1:09:18] I can do that
[1:09:20] then boys said okay if you can do it I
[1:09:22] will do it
[1:09:24] I will do it
[1:09:26] so someone is qualified
[1:09:29] and someone relative to the word
[1:09:32] would come
[1:09:33] it should be
[1:09:35] our kinsman redeemer
[1:09:39] I would like to say more deeper about
[1:09:41] relative to the world because there's
[1:09:43] something you know oh I love that but I
[1:09:45] just want as I said yes percentage in a
[1:09:48] shallow terminology so Our Redeemer came
[1:09:52] and brought us I mean redeem us
[1:09:55] the word demise
[1:09:58] to bring us back to our original
[1:10:00] possession so you must know what was
[1:10:03] your position before
[1:10:06] the meaning of redemption
[1:10:10] so the first the original situation
[1:10:13] original position that Adam has
[1:10:16] that Adam was perfectly United with God
[1:10:20] he can talk to God God can come down and
[1:10:23] fell asleep with Adam
[1:10:25] lip to ear
[1:10:27] lip to air anytime
[1:10:30] you see that Dimension is so close
[1:10:34] the third and the sixth Dimension is so
[1:10:36] close together and there's no barriers
[1:10:38] about it what I mean is the spiritual
[1:10:41] your spiritual the the distance of God
[1:10:44] and you is not is that far
[1:10:46] it's so close before okay I just show
[1:10:50] you the the the the uh the former
[1:10:52] condition of Adam that that was his
[1:10:56] condition before the fall came
[1:11:00] but right after the full now this
[1:11:02] morning maybe there were brothers here
[1:11:04] that really read what the prophet said
[1:11:07] you can talk to me and brother Richard
[1:11:09] where did you get the coach I will give
[1:11:10] you
[1:11:11] I will give you okay let me just speak
[1:11:15] about it so these things you know when
[1:11:18] Adam lose it
[1:11:20] someone
[1:11:21] till the ground
[1:11:24] and any things the squatter wants to to
[1:11:27] do
[1:11:28] you know
[1:11:29] he did it
[1:11:31] for so many years
[1:11:33] but there will come a day called
[1:11:37] a jubilee
[1:11:40] okay
[1:11:40] you know this Jubilee
[1:11:43] we have
[1:11:44] uh Independence Day here is that July
[1:11:48] okay liberation
[1:11:51] were liberated from other you know
[1:11:54] colony
[1:11:55] Philippine store we are liberated from
[1:11:58] the Spanish that's why most of us are
[1:12:00] you know I have Spanish name Roberto
[1:12:03] that's my name
[1:12:04] pardelio okay that's my name
[1:12:07] so because we are you know colonized
[1:12:10] before then come to Japanese
[1:12:13] again
[1:12:15] but praise God MacArthur came
[1:12:18] and liberated Philippines from the hands
[1:12:22] of you know Japanese and
[1:12:24] oh praise the Lord
[1:12:26] we are liberated
[1:12:29] and when that declaration came one
[1:12:32] returned back
[1:12:34] to their own poor session
[1:12:39] now you know before you can place that
[1:12:42] position you have to position something
[1:12:44] yes
[1:12:46] yes all right let's see where you you
[1:12:48] were just there as you know but if you
[1:12:50] can possess
[1:12:51] something to be qualified in that
[1:12:54] position oh my
[1:12:56] uh you can do it
[1:12:59] you can do it so
[1:13:01] Jubilee King
[1:13:03] and this quarter must off the land
[1:13:07] you have to go away
[1:13:09] okay so Israel
[1:13:11] the origin the original place of Israel
[1:13:14] was in Canaan we know that
[1:13:17] and Moses was commissioned
[1:13:20] to bring the people back
[1:13:22] the word back meaning they were the
[1:13:24] before
[1:13:28] and we were here we have to go back
[1:13:31] meaning we were
[1:13:33] hello we were there before we have to go
[1:13:37] back so where were you
[1:13:39] what what is your what is your meaning
[1:13:43] for there if you were there because if
[1:13:46] you were not there you're gonna go back
[1:13:47] there
[1:13:48] he that is from heaven will go back to
[1:13:51] heaven
[1:13:52] Judas was from hell he go back to hell
[1:13:56] we are from Heaven We Came From Heaven
[1:13:58] we will go back to heaven
[1:14:01] but
[1:14:03] we did that came from heaven but we were
[1:14:05] but we did not but we were but we did
[1:14:07] not
[1:14:12] the 16 element body
[1:14:14] did that came there
[1:14:16] this body came from my mother and father
[1:14:20] he said this is the product of you know
[1:14:23] agreement of your father and mother
[1:14:26] you see that so God wants to be to
[1:14:30] restore all these things
[1:14:33] then God speak to Moses
[1:14:36] Moses bring back
[1:14:39] my people
[1:14:41] to the promised land
[1:14:44] I repeat
[1:14:46] they were all born in Egypt
[1:14:49] but the scripture said Moses bring back
[1:14:52] my people
[1:14:55] you say that so out of these people out
[1:14:58] of this land out of this man
[1:15:02] God had something in this
[1:15:04] okay
[1:15:05] now before before
[1:15:09] Moses can bring thee back
[1:15:12] you don't you know that there were
[1:15:14] people who squat their land
[1:15:17] the amorites
[1:15:19] the parasites do you know that this body
[1:15:22] that you have
[1:15:28] you know
[1:15:29] that's why we have the Bible required
[1:15:32] your second birth
[1:15:34] because the first birth is not enough
[1:15:38] you see that so before Moses can bring
[1:15:41] thee back there
[1:15:43] they have to eliminate they have to take
[1:15:45] away they have to demolish all these
[1:15:48] squatter
[1:15:50] in Canaan
[1:15:52] to all these amorites the parasites
[1:15:58] the parasites the the Hittites
[1:16:03] do you know the Hittites
[1:16:06] people that hits the tights
[1:16:11] now all these people that were squat the
[1:16:14] land of Israelites
[1:16:17] King
[1:16:21] and approach all
[1:16:24] you know
[1:16:26] the boundary
[1:16:27] the demanded system
[1:16:29] that they put right there
[1:16:31] we have we have five inlets in the
[1:16:35] spirit
[1:16:37] we have memory
[1:16:41] the the uh the uh what we call this it's
[1:16:46] so easy to memorize because
[1:16:49] the acronym Micra memory
[1:16:52] emotion uh conscience reasoning
[1:16:56] affection okay
[1:16:58] and that and the most things that you
[1:17:01] that your enemy is your your memory
[1:17:04] because you try to confess everything
[1:17:06] you try to renew that you want to be
[1:17:08] that memory keep on reminding you keep
[1:17:11] on ringing on your mind that you are
[1:17:13] guilty you are guilty you are guilty
[1:17:15] although you are confused Lord forgive
[1:17:16] me but anytime that memory will be open
[1:17:19] I'm sorry I speak fast again
[1:17:22] okay
[1:17:23] okay anytime that the devil tried to
[1:17:26] open
[1:17:28] that memory
[1:17:31] uh
[1:17:33] you know sometimes during your
[1:17:35] Elementary days high school days if you
[1:17:37] can meet them I said I remember you you
[1:17:40] did something wrong with me
[1:17:44] it's it's that AC you know it's that AC
[1:17:47] but praise God
[1:17:50] God provide the instrument you can
[1:17:53] delete it
[1:17:57] or if you wanted to copy and paste to
[1:17:59] Satan
[1:18:00] copy right click then praise to Satan go
[1:18:03] back
[1:18:06] you know what God did to us
[1:18:09] God help us
[1:18:11] to download
[1:18:14] to download right here and upload right
[1:18:16] here
[1:18:18] did unloading and uploading has come
[1:18:21] now we hop we have now the right click
[1:18:27] you see and God guide us he gave us a
[1:18:30] spiritual GPS
[1:18:33] and guide us well the way that he wants
[1:18:35] us to walk
[1:18:37] amen
[1:18:40] you will not go astray because God give
[1:18:43] you that spiritual GPS
[1:18:46] and that's the Holy Ghost
[1:18:47] [Applause]
[1:18:51] so Moses bring these people back
[1:18:54] to the promise then
[1:18:56] you know the story
[1:18:57] if you can type it if you can if you can
[1:19:00] parallel that events it's really you can
[1:19:03] see that in the shipment or Jesus
[1:19:06] from Egypt
[1:19:07] to the promised land
[1:19:09] it's a similar genius oh all the stages
[1:19:13] we can see that so
[1:19:15] they start troubling
[1:19:17] and the Bible said
[1:19:20] when Moses starts the heart of peril
[1:19:24] you know he have compassion with
[1:19:28] Israelites
[1:19:29] if the hands of God
[1:19:32] take off from the heart of peer of peer
[1:19:34] will become you know
[1:19:36] brutal you know killer
[1:19:39] so Pirro is you know Piro
[1:19:42] he has no choice
[1:19:47] I would say it's like it's just like
[1:19:49] Peter didn't have a soul
[1:19:52] because he wants to do but he cannot
[1:19:57] and Paul you know cutscene the
[1:20:00] revelation of people he said Piro is
[1:20:02] just like a
[1:20:04] clay
[1:20:06] Roman Stein
[1:20:08] Peter he was just a clay
[1:20:11] if you want to read that chapter 9 of
[1:20:13] Book of Romans
[1:20:15] he said
[1:20:16] he said Piro
[1:20:18] is just like a clay
[1:20:20] what if God wants to mold the clay to
[1:20:24] honor him
[1:20:26] and wants to move another clay to
[1:20:27] dishonor him
[1:20:29] he was talking about Piro
[1:20:33] and he said who are you to try to find
[1:20:36] fault against God
[1:20:38] so we cannot blame Avery oh everything
[1:20:42] that happened in this life we cannot
[1:20:43] blame God
[1:20:45] I like what sister Carter said
[1:20:48] he said I believe that God has a purpose
[1:20:50] of these things for brother still
[1:20:53] I love that
[1:20:55] he was she was a Bible reader
[1:20:58] that's not ordinary thing
[1:21:01] no because when when Paul knows that
[1:21:05] there's something there there were
[1:21:06] people that could complain against God
[1:21:08] that's why he said who are you to find
[1:21:10] fault against God
[1:21:12] what if God wants to willing to show his
[1:21:15] wrath and his Mercy
[1:21:17] what is this to you
[1:21:21] the chapter that that chapter chapter
[1:21:23] nine
[1:21:24] but if you'll reverse that chapter 8 he
[1:21:27] said all things work together for good
[1:21:30] yeah that's why because chapter nine
[1:21:32] details what was happening in chapter
[1:21:34] eight
[1:21:36] and if you will just you know try to try
[1:21:39] to read it slowly from chapter 6 chapter
[1:21:42] 7 chapter 8 chapter 9 you can see all
[1:21:45] how God's really a gracious God
[1:21:48] because the love contrasts you know so
[1:21:52] Paul cuts the revelation
[1:21:54] who was this hero
[1:21:56] you know why Paul write that because one
[1:21:59] day he tried to resess the will of God
[1:22:02] he was Saul before
[1:22:06] but all things that he tried to write is
[1:22:08] his experience
[1:22:11] he experienced it how to resist the
[1:22:14] power of God
[1:22:16] until only God smed him to Blind blind
[1:22:19] him
[1:22:21] Acts chapter 9 you see that that's a win
[1:22:24] her right pull his the scripture oh it's
[1:22:28] full of experience
[1:22:30] he said who are you try to ask God so
[1:22:32] Paul will he write that oh really I I
[1:22:36] told you last Wednesday about the
[1:22:39] glimpse of this what I'm talking about
[1:22:42] bully cuts the revelation
[1:22:44] that even The Unborn son he knows he
[1:22:48] said oh the election must turn he has to
[1:22:51] God has to decide
[1:22:54] who will be and hold it be who will be
[1:22:56] saved who will not be saved that while
[1:22:59] Paul writing on this he said he said it
[1:23:02] is written that he said Jacob love isaw
[1:23:09] I mean Jacob
[1:23:11] and hate no love Jacob and no he said I
[1:23:15] hate Jacob
[1:23:17] now that verse is not pertaining to to
[1:23:19] to to to to what's this uh
[1:23:23] Esau
[1:23:29] you see that so Paul cuts the mind what
[1:23:32] was in the mind of God
[1:23:35] he cuts the mind he said you must have
[1:23:36] the mind of Christ he said oh I he said
[1:23:39] it was written so well where was written
[1:23:42] it was in the Bible is that it's the
[1:23:44] literal Bible it was written right here
[1:23:47] because he was talking about
[1:23:48] predestination
[1:23:51] chapter nine
[1:23:52] you see that so
[1:23:55] Paul's Soul these things
[1:24:00] said that God worked in both ends I love
[1:24:04] that God work in both end when you start
[1:24:10] and your ending
[1:24:12] he does you
[1:24:15] he keeps you
[1:24:16] he keep you safe from the beginning
[1:24:19] you will die right there but he God
[1:24:21] knows that someday
[1:24:23] that someday he will you will response
[1:24:26] the word
[1:24:28] he keeps you safe even from the
[1:24:30] beginning
[1:24:31] do you know that God before your birth
[1:24:34] before before your mother delivered you
[1:24:36] there was an angel watching you to catch
[1:24:39] you
[1:24:40] and even before your death before you
[1:24:43] you you give up the ghost someone right
[1:24:46] there waiting to catch you too
[1:24:49] so God will not you know he will not
[1:24:51] allow you to be peerless
[1:24:56] oh I love that
[1:24:58] Hallelujah so Paul you know God for God
[1:25:02] God walked or full his beginning
[1:25:06] he's beginning and he's ending
[1:25:09] you're starting on your end that he work
[1:25:11] with
[1:25:12] that's why we win win win win win
[1:25:15] ananias
[1:25:17] when we speak to ananias and then yes
[1:25:20] you know
[1:25:21] I love the brother I said Lord he was
[1:25:25] Criminal
[1:25:27] but a murderer
[1:25:29] but God saw you
[1:25:33] God saw you one day
[1:25:36] he keep you safe even from your from
[1:25:38] your in your Elementary High School
[1:25:40] College he keep you safe there were
[1:25:42] accidents that I might be dying I might
[1:25:45] die
[1:25:45] but God keep me safe because one day
[1:25:49] 1979 December 15.
[1:25:53] I would hear his word
[1:25:55] that's the time I was baptized in 1979
[1:25:59] I'm not too old
[1:26:01] I'm still young
[1:26:04] okay because God knows you before
[1:26:07] even before your existence he knows you
[1:26:10] and he tells you
[1:26:13] because God knows you before before you
[1:26:16] were born God knows you that when that
[1:26:18] year is come like this year 2012 that
[1:26:22] day that man that year he will hear his
[1:26:25] word
[1:26:26] and you will respond his word and you
[1:26:29] will follow his word and you will serve
[1:26:32] him that's why he keeps you safe even
[1:26:34] before your birth
[1:26:37] there's a new thing happen right here in
[1:26:40] this world
[1:26:42] no new things so sometimes you you will
[1:26:45] see yeah maybe I heard because someone
[1:26:47] invited me no
[1:26:49] no that invitation is just an instrument
[1:26:53] so that you can walk the path of the way
[1:26:55] of God down to his you know his program
[1:26:58] his plan for you
[1:27:00] [Applause]
[1:27:02] so God will not look after your what how
[1:27:05] Wicked you are how how bad you are but
[1:27:08] he's looking your representation right
[1:27:11] here in his mind
[1:27:13] and that when your season is come
[1:27:16] someone will oh you know
[1:27:19] If That season is come someone will come
[1:27:23] to you
[1:27:24] and will remind you
[1:27:27] the word remind you will you were there
[1:27:30] in his mind and now someone came to
[1:27:32] remind you
[1:27:35] [Applause]
[1:27:36] you see that when you heard it you
[1:27:39] response because you were in the mind of
[1:27:42] God
[1:27:43] I remember the male factor in the right
[1:27:45] hand of God when when they were at the
[1:27:47] cross
[1:27:48] what did he say Lord
[1:27:51] remember me
[1:27:54] so God no need to remember him it's
[1:27:58] already in his mind
[1:27:59] and he said because he says on a scam
[1:28:02] not during the day of his criminal works
[1:28:04] right here but right there at the cross
[1:28:07] that's his season
[1:28:10] then Jesus said right now
[1:28:14] I will you will go with me
[1:28:19] in Paradise
[1:28:21] [Applause]
[1:28:24] that's his right season
[1:28:28] you know sometimes there were things
[1:28:30] happen
[1:28:31] that will push you
[1:28:34] to realize
[1:28:36] that you really need God in your life
[1:28:40] why this sickness and diseases comes in
[1:28:43] our life
[1:28:44] because God wants you to realize that he
[1:28:46] is our healer
[1:28:49] God is our comforter
[1:28:51] so he permits distress and sadness to
[1:28:54] make you smile
[1:28:56] if you already smile how can I smile how
[1:28:58] can you make a smile
[1:29:00] if you're already full how can I feed
[1:29:02] you
[1:29:03] if you're not thirsty how can I let you
[1:29:06] drink
[1:29:07] if you're happy how can I could make you
[1:29:09] happy if you are saved how can I proceed
[1:29:12] savior
[1:29:15] you know
[1:29:17] so all these things work out I mean he
[1:29:20] permits all these things
[1:29:22] just to you know just to push you to the
[1:29:25] spot where he can contact you
[1:29:29] amen so all these trials problems God
[1:29:33] just permit posing you you know
[1:29:35] sometimes God puts you into an unboxed
[1:29:37] area
[1:29:39] so that you can see how he protect you
[1:29:42] because if you are right there in your
[1:29:44] comfort zone and will protect it how
[1:29:46] could God can operate his attribute as
[1:29:49] protector
[1:29:51] how could God Express being a ship your
[1:29:54] savior if you are already the same
[1:29:59] uh
[1:30:02] uh can we give him one another Applause
[1:30:04] for him
[1:30:05] [Applause]
[1:30:08] so Moses come and before
[1:30:12] before
[1:30:14] they possess the promised land before he
[1:30:17] the you know
[1:30:18] possession
[1:30:20] all the Dwellers in that promised land
[1:30:24] was

[1:30:45] I was converted and now I'm it it looks
[1:30:48] like the same no
[1:30:49] no
[1:30:50] the Bible said sir Corinthians 5 17. If
[1:30:54] any man be in Christ
[1:30:56] I would say
[1:30:58] he's a new creature
[1:31:01] all things are passed away
[1:31:05] now reward all things it doesn't mean
[1:31:07] repair

[1:32:20] which we do not know
[1:32:23] that there was a man drive this before

[1:32:30] well it's up to you if you want to hold
[1:32:32] it you can call in anyone you'd call it
[1:32:34] because the prophet's military
[1:32:35] terminology
[1:32:36] old man old nature old soul a lot of
[1:32:41] any if you are happy to use that old
[1:32:45] terminology Okay so

[1:32:51] your mind
[1:32:53] now you send your children
[1:32:56] to the Kinder right
[1:32:58] right then as they hear the teacher
[1:33:02] in our in our country

[1:33:14] oh really you knew that our teacher told
[1:33:17] us

[1:33:22] okay
[1:33:23] then they learn about ABC
[1:33:27] ABC you see that
[1:33:30] then did they learn how to identify
[1:33:35] Ness
[1:33:37] my shoulder my head

[1:33:48] come
[1:33:49] you see that
[1:33:51] wow you know what is your where is your
[1:33:53] head
[1:33:54] what they were doing you were just

[1:34:02] into Elementary
[1:34:04] still good hearer you will just you know

[1:34:11] one day
[1:34:13] you were in college
[1:34:15] still hearing
[1:34:17] but in college is something different
[1:34:20] because there was a Critic
[1:34:23] professor

[1:34:27] there was a Critic professor
[1:34:29] and criticize you

[1:34:43] and Jesus was to criticized at the cross
[1:34:47] make him naked

[1:34:52] have something right here but the truth
[1:34:54] is no he was totally naked
[1:34:57] because his punishment is a capital
[1:34:59] punishment
[1:35:02] but in our picture you have covered
[1:35:06] he admit all the critics
[1:35:09] then one day he was promoted
[1:35:13] you see that now
[1:35:15] after the critics

[1:36:01] then one day
[1:36:04] Israel pushes the land
[1:36:07] yeah you know the story the world
[1:36:08] trumpets
[1:36:10] first day they just going around on the

[1:36:24] trumpets
[1:36:26] gospel trumpets yes gospel trumpets then
[1:36:29] one day we are we are we are in the
[1:36:33] bandage of religion and denomination
[1:36:37] we are all slain of our religion and all
[1:36:40] people claim to be the right one
[1:36:42] everyone so people were confused
[1:36:46] but one day there will be a summoning of
[1:36:48] trumpets
[1:36:51] Jubilee
[1:36:53] to do
[1:36:56] Wherever You Are

[1:37:04] the date of Independence come
[1:37:07] amen the squatter must off the land
[1:37:10] that you'll realize
[1:37:13] that you have already restored back to
[1:37:15] your original land at the day
[1:37:18] and try to oh
[1:37:20] I tried to fix myself I want to do this
[1:37:22] this is the will of God so I want to
[1:37:24] follow
[1:37:25] because that time you'll realize
[1:37:28] that you are not you are not of your own
[1:37:32] someone owns you
[1:37:34] oh I love that
[1:37:36] so I used to write pushes the land
[1:37:39] the same as we have also learned
[1:37:43] the seven dispensation
[1:37:46] now I'd like to say something this might
[1:37:47] be I hope if this is not right a pastor
[1:37:50] Dell is here he can iron out everything
[1:37:53] he's your pastor don't worry
[1:37:56] I will not convert you I just share
[1:38:00] something that one person
[1:38:02] so I I told the brothers in America I
[1:38:04] said I was just your brother or I was
[1:38:07] just an armpit part of the body I would
[1:38:10] be happy and as long as I'm part of the
[1:38:12] body I would be happy
[1:38:14] yeah something bad smell I need you to
[1:38:16] run it's okay it's okay as long as I
[1:38:19] know that I'm a part of
[1:38:21] a body
[1:38:22] okay now that's seven trumpets gospel
[1:38:25] trumpet
[1:38:26] there was a trumpeters
[1:38:30] that's seven trumpet
[1:38:32] Gathering all the trumpets
[1:38:36] it's no longer one term but it's the
[1:38:38] seven trumpets inside that one trumpet
[1:38:43] I repeat
[1:38:45] the seven trumpets
[1:38:48] in one trumpet
[1:38:50] the seven voice
[1:38:51] and one voice
[1:38:53] the seven eights in one age
[1:38:55] called The Bride AIDS
[1:38:57] okay what I mean is we have to realize
[1:39:01] that God has something special in this
[1:39:04] AIDS
[1:39:05] this is not an ordinary AIDS this is not
[1:39:08] also a literal AIDS this is a
[1:39:11] supernatural AIDS out of the ages
[1:39:15] okay and now God wants us to realize
[1:39:20] that he wants to redesign us okay that
[1:39:23] all of us
[1:39:24] that to us in his thoughts
[1:39:27] that we were there we have to go back
[1:39:29] there
[1:39:30] that there is two things that there
[1:39:33] okay
[1:39:36] I heard a Pastor said
[1:39:38] we have to go back to the word where
[1:39:42] back to the thoughts oh back to the
[1:39:45] thoughts
[1:39:48] you say yes I said no but yes but no and
[1:39:52] the prophet said
[1:39:54] the message says
[1:39:57] that we have to go back where we were
[1:40:00] now if you can read the book Christ The
[1:40:02] Mystery of God Revel
[1:40:03] I did not see my notes anymore
[1:40:06] mix me delay
[1:40:10] praise the Lord amen
[1:40:14] we have to go back where we were
[1:40:16] now what was the original position of
[1:40:18] Adam
[1:40:20] he walked with God
[1:40:22] in a perfect body
[1:40:25] with a fellowship
[1:40:29] that's where we were before
[1:40:32] okay now
[1:40:34] all that to us
[1:40:36] in God
[1:40:39] he poured
[1:40:41] Antichrist
[1:40:44] okay
[1:40:45] and all that was in Christ
[1:40:48] he poured
[1:40:51] and to ask the brother church now let me
[1:40:53] just let me just
[1:40:55] uh
[1:40:56] what we call this
[1:40:58] slowly okay dissing it slowly
[1:41:02] chop it slowly
[1:41:04] okay
[1:41:05] you must believe that you were there
[1:41:08] if you were not there you are not here
[1:41:11] now it depends up under there it could
[1:41:13] be there or there
[1:41:15] if you came from there you will go back
[1:41:17] there
[1:41:18] but if you came from God you will go
[1:41:20] back to God
[1:41:22] now someone said to me Pastor John
[1:41:25] brother June how could I know if I came
[1:41:28] from God
[1:41:29] well you know as I told sister
[1:41:34] Kathy the birds fly not to become Birds
[1:41:39] I serve God because I came from God
[1:41:46] okay
[1:41:48] if I did that came from God uh I will
[1:41:52] not do the things of God
[1:41:58] the fish swim not to become Fists
[1:42:05] you are born in it
[1:42:10] the maple tree
[1:42:12] did not struggling to become unbuffled
[1:42:16] no
[1:42:19] the nature and the species
[1:42:24] testify who are you
[1:42:28] you didn't become long stop
[1:42:31] you are long stop too big to start with
[1:42:37] you see so what you have now is just the
[1:42:39] product
[1:42:40] of being a long stop
[1:42:44] okay now if you are
[1:42:46] came from God if you came from God Son
[1:42:48] of God you can't help him you can help
[1:42:52] yourself
[1:42:54] I want to swim no you have wings to fly
[1:42:58] I want to swim
[1:43:00] no
[1:43:01] you are not in the right position
[1:43:04] I will come to you and pick up your nose
[1:43:07] you have to fly you have the wings was
[1:43:10] given to you to fly
[1:43:13] so you didn't become bird
[1:43:16] no we didn't become seed we were said we
[1:43:21] did not become Sons and Daughters of God
[1:43:23] we were sons and others of God
[1:43:26] at the moment you realize that you are
[1:43:29] sons of God duties of God you can help
[1:43:32] yourself
[1:43:35] you know have you seen the birds that
[1:43:37] keep on flying it's a small bird
[1:43:40] if the birds can complain
[1:43:42] that bridge will complain
[1:43:44] Lord why you create me soon you know I I
[1:43:47] want to risk
[1:43:50] no you are created to fly
[1:43:53] so you have to fly
[1:43:55] you are created to serve God
[1:43:58] you can help yourself because down in
[1:44:02] your heart there were you know God will
[1:44:04] put something in your heart
[1:44:07] you did not say God it God it's God
[1:44:10] seeking you
[1:44:12] you didn't I want to be good no there's
[1:44:15] no God because all things are bad
[1:44:18] born in sin speaking lies you know
[1:44:21] shipping inequity
[1:44:23] but someday you know time comes and we
[1:44:26] realize
[1:44:27] oh this is not my world
[1:44:30] I want to serve you Lord
[1:44:33] you see so
[1:44:35] oh
[1:44:36] let me just one there's a thought right
[1:44:40] here I love this stuff
[1:44:43] I love this thought it says here
[1:44:50] he said God condescending to his
[1:44:53] creation
[1:44:55] hold it up God wants to be worshiped the
[1:44:58] word means the word god means object of
[1:45:01] worship you know that if and it's God
[1:45:03] trying to condition his people
[1:45:06] he tried to condition us
[1:45:10] okay
[1:45:11] his people that he can get from them
[1:45:13] what he created them for
[1:45:17] he want to pull something that was in
[1:45:19] you
[1:45:20] okay
[1:45:22] God wants to get something what is that
[1:45:24] something you want you to serve him
[1:45:28] so but you do not know yet before we do
[1:45:31] not do that because someone squat this
[1:45:32] land
[1:45:35] okay
[1:45:36] someone squat this land
[1:45:39] okay the original condition of Adam was
[1:45:42] lost
[1:45:43] and God came to return back that's why
[1:45:46] the word redeemed so bring us back
[1:45:49] what was in the pawnshop we cannot
[1:45:52] redeem it so he came at the cross two
[1:45:54] thousand years ago
[1:45:56] being you know
[1:45:58] if you're gonna pay your bill literal
[1:46:01] bill that bill will be cut off you have
[1:46:04] to pay for it to restore
[1:46:06] now that relation of God
[1:46:10] to Adam and Adam to God was cut up
[1:46:14] it had to be paid for the blood
[1:46:16] so Jesus came and paid the connection
[1:46:19] now the connection being restored
[1:46:22] being restored and we realize Who We Are
[1:46:28] we realize that we are now in our
[1:46:30] possession
[1:46:31] the lights restored
[1:46:34] you are not in your own land
[1:46:37] and the squatter is of the sin get out
[1:46:42] I am the original owner of this land
[1:46:46] so Jesus
[1:46:48] first thing is you have to know the
[1:46:50] prophet said you have to know that you
[1:46:51] lost something
[1:46:53] you know there was a pastor I said what
[1:46:56] was what kind of items you lost
[1:46:59] that Jesus restored back to you did the
[1:47:01] Pastor said pastor
[1:47:03] it's my salvation that I I say when did
[1:47:07] your salvation lost
[1:47:09] then he said oh ten years ago I was
[1:47:12] saved I received him as my savior
[1:47:15] but until now
[1:47:17] I didn't lost my salvation so you do not
[1:47:20] know what you're asking for
[1:47:24] Prophet said you have to know
[1:47:26] that you lost something
[1:47:29] and Jesus bring it back
[1:47:31] to you
[1:47:33] if I lost my wristwatch
[1:47:38] I know that my watch is wrist watches in
[1:47:41] the pawn shop
[1:47:43] if somebody come I didn't lose it and
[1:47:46] said past brother June this is your no
[1:47:48] look he's here
[1:47:51] hello I know you you know I know you're
[1:47:55] thinking about it
[1:47:56] you think about it I just called
[1:47:58] whatever rabbit said you know what he
[1:47:59] said
[1:48:01] Redemption really means to bring us back
[1:48:04] now now these things
[1:48:06] what he did for us because he said he
[1:48:09] wants us he said
[1:48:11] God is just trying to condition his
[1:48:13] people
[1:48:13] because you are out of the condition
[1:48:16] he wants to condition his people that he
[1:48:19] can get from them what he created them
[1:48:21] for
[1:48:22] he never will beat you he never made you
[1:48:25] to be something else beside his son and
[1:48:28] daughters
[1:48:29] of God
[1:48:31] so why when these things came to our
[1:48:34] mind to my mind I realized where did I
[1:48:36] serve
[1:48:37] where did I where did I dedicate myself
[1:48:39] to God or to Satan if he designed for me
[1:48:43] if he wants me to realize that he did
[1:48:46] not create something else that he
[1:48:48] created me
[1:48:50] as Sons and Daughters of God where did I
[1:48:52] serve now
[1:48:54] so I make up myself I said oh
[1:48:57] thank you Lord
[1:48:58] I have to return back over I was
[1:49:03] I have to know that
[1:49:05] my father and mother was just an
[1:49:08] instrument
[1:49:09] for me
[1:49:12] okay put his body
[1:49:15] okay
[1:49:19] and when I realized
[1:49:21] now I know
[1:49:22] that I am not
[1:49:24] but I am
[1:49:25] but I am not their sons and daughters
[1:49:27] but I am
[1:49:31] en I am not but I am
[1:49:35] it's safe that you have but you have not
[1:49:38] it seemed that we're not sitting in
[1:49:39] human places but still right here in
[1:49:41] this Tabernacle
[1:49:44] it takes a revelation
[1:49:46] it's a condition
[1:49:48] we're not sitting in Heavenly places
[1:49:50] it's a condition
[1:49:53] if we've got the clarity of Revelation
[1:49:55] then we can we can drive this you know
[1:49:59] where to go
[1:50:01] amen
[1:50:03] where am I to open myself I may offer
[1:50:06] myself to the word or to God
[1:50:09] so that attributes that came from God in
[1:50:14] his mind okay the thoughts the attribute
[1:50:18] okay all this I I love this stuff
[1:50:21] if you if you can go with Pastor Dale in
[1:50:25] Toronto for a convention
[1:50:27] I have to you know details that more
[1:50:31] the stuff
[1:50:32] okay all that to us in God Where's God
[1:50:36] right there in the dimension it's a
[1:50:37] dimension again it's a condition again
[1:50:40] seventh Dimension and he alone was there
[1:50:44] what he did
[1:50:46] he create first you know himself
[1:50:51] because he wants to
[1:50:52] create man in His image
[1:50:55] but he himself don't have image yet
[1:50:58] so he had created an Amex before he can
[1:51:01] create man all his amens
[1:51:06] can you see him into that
[1:51:08] so he created himself
[1:51:10] make an amidst
[1:51:12] and that image is his son
[1:51:16] okay
[1:51:18] now right here
[1:51:20] he couldn't descend to his creation
[1:51:25] under sixth Dimension now in this sixth
[1:51:28] Dimension is the place of expression
[1:51:30] place of expression place of creation
[1:51:33] and place of manifestation not this no
[1:51:36] no no no not this not this Dimension six
[1:51:41] so the first creation that was made is
[1:51:44] not right here in the seven it was right
[1:51:47] in the sixth dimension
[1:51:50] and the first thing that was created is
[1:51:53] God himself
[1:51:56] he formed himself
[1:51:58] You Must Believe
[1:52:00] you must know and believe and understand
[1:52:03] that there was no other God that was
[1:52:05] formed
[1:52:07] so now God had a form
[1:52:10] amen will he create that form someone
[1:52:14] came out from him
[1:52:17] when someone came out from him he became
[1:52:20] a father
[1:52:24] see that
[1:52:26] that's why when your wife
[1:52:30] delivered your firstborn the doctor said
[1:52:33] brother you are now
[1:52:36] a father
[1:52:38] yet you are a son
[1:52:41] because how could he be a father without
[1:52:43] a son and how could you be a son without
[1:52:45] a father
[1:52:47] so the Oneness and the tallness and the
[1:52:49] threeness was confused because they were
[1:52:52] just looking at two but just one
[1:52:55] creation
[1:52:56] but it's too but it's one but it's two
[1:53:00] but it takes a revelation
[1:53:03] do you know that you are not a
[1:53:04] thoughtful being when you receive God in
[1:53:07] yourself you are not a thoughtful being
[1:53:11] one is you you are not eating Heavenly
[1:53:14] Heavenly food that they send them eating
[1:53:17] for your tummy
[1:53:19] you know so you are no double I mean you
[1:53:23] are you are now too for being one being
[1:53:26] to eat and die and one being and will
[1:53:29] never die
[1:53:32] while eating spiritual food you will
[1:53:35] never die while eating this body is
[1:53:37] still eating the steak and uh
[1:53:43] wife of sister Dallas oh
[1:53:46] like a ship
[1:53:49] why are you still eating
[1:53:51] you will die someday
[1:53:52] but you're spiritual well you will never
[1:53:55] die
[1:53:56] so when you receive it you become a
[1:53:59] TOEFL being
[1:54:02] being
[1:54:04] then the war is begins
[1:54:09] before
[1:54:11] uh
[1:54:12] there is no passing
[1:54:15] I want to do this you will do it right
[1:54:16] away
[1:54:18] I want to go there you know no problem
[1:54:20] no one will stop you
[1:54:21] do you know that going to hell is that
[1:54:24] AC
[1:54:26] I repeat it again do you know that going
[1:54:30] to hell is not easy
[1:54:34] a murderer
[1:54:36] adulterer limit
[1:54:39] that will that cause you to go to hell
[1:54:41] oh brother June
[1:54:43] hold your peace
[1:54:46] anything that's bought before your eyes
[1:54:48] that will not cause you to go to hell
[1:54:53] it's not easy to go to hell
[1:54:55] if anyone go to hell God will blockage
[1:54:57] your area
[1:54:58] God will block you there he don't want
[1:55:00] you
[1:55:01] because you sit right here
[1:55:04] he never made you to be something else
[1:55:08] he made you to be Sons and Daughters of
[1:55:10] God
[1:55:11] so if anyone wants to go to hell God
[1:55:12] will block him don't go there God sent
[1:55:16] someone to say you you know the word of
[1:55:18] God is this the word of God is this
[1:55:20] it's an essay
[1:55:24] now to go to hell he says it's hard
[1:55:27] you have to reject the word for your day
[1:55:31] then that's it that will qualify you to
[1:55:33] go
[1:55:34] not your ass including myself
[1:55:38] I repeat it's not easy to go to hell
[1:55:42] you have to reject the word that you
[1:55:44] have heard
[1:55:45] because the thing that you have heard
[1:55:46] will place you somewhere
[1:55:49] we are just hearing the word
[1:55:51] seven times the Bible said an ear
[1:55:55] let him here
[1:55:59] what the messenger now what the spirit
[1:56:03] but it was the messenger but the spirit
[1:56:06] you say again you see that it was not
[1:56:09] the message you're speaking it's a
[1:56:10] spirit but
[1:56:13] it was it takes a revelation to
[1:56:16] recognize that it was that brother John
[1:56:18] speaking no it was a Pastor Dale it was
[1:56:20] a man speaking it was not it was the
[1:56:22] Holy Spirit flowing to the mouth of the
[1:56:25] speaker then that voice is that the
[1:56:27] voice of man that boy is the voice of
[1:56:33] you see so going to hell is that easy
[1:56:38] you have to reject
[1:56:40] you have to speak you have to blaspheme
[1:56:42] the Holy Ghost for you to go to hell
[1:56:45] now killing murdering adultery is just
[1:56:48] the result of being an unbeliever
[1:56:51] okay you do that because that's the
[1:56:54] product of being an unbeliever
[1:56:57] amen again because the specie of that
[1:57:00] man is unbeliever
[1:57:02] so what are the fruits of course what
[1:57:05] are the things
[1:57:06] all this is just a worldly things will
[1:57:08] just follow
[1:57:09] because that's to us his PC
[1:57:14] now
[1:57:15] get UPS had something special for you
[1:57:19] you came from God
[1:57:21] God bless you that seed
[1:57:24] I mean by means of your hearing we were
[1:57:26] just heard
[1:57:27] this word
[1:57:29] I'm just a wordless singer before I used
[1:57:33] to you know
[1:57:36] I tried to follow the
[1:57:38] the face of nilian
[1:57:40] Hey My My
[1:57:44] Apollo you know imagine there is no
[1:57:47] Heaven you know all these things are
[1:57:50] just the product
[1:57:52] you need a title manufacture no you did
[1:57:55] manufactured it the product is automatic
[1:57:58] because you are an unbeliever
[1:58:00] now
[1:58:03] the old things
[1:58:05] the old nature the old man the old way
[1:58:09] the old system is gone
[1:58:13] you are not new
[1:58:15] creation
[1:58:18] so
[1:58:20] the same face
[1:58:22] although a little bit old
[1:58:25] the same body
[1:58:27] but it's new
[1:58:30] right here Paul said
[1:58:33] be not conformed into this world
[1:58:37] what was next
[1:58:38] but be it transformed
[1:58:41] by what
[1:58:42] by the renewing
[1:58:45] so the renewing it has to do it our mind
[1:58:49] you see we were just hearing the word
[1:58:52] every Sunday behind us and you will
[1:58:54] surprise
[1:58:55] because the thing that you used to do oh
[1:58:58] you will never do it anymore
[1:59:02] [Applause]
[1:59:05] you know
[1:59:07] before I was a dancer brother
[1:59:10] strut oh
[1:59:12] I have my own sound system
[1:59:15] and then
[1:59:16] oh did the people look like I'm so proud
[1:59:21] but now I say oh how pity am I before
[1:59:26] and I will not do that anymore
[1:59:29] that's not his design for me to do
[1:59:35] you see
[1:59:36] it's him this is not our work anymore
[1:59:40] this is God's work this is not our
[1:59:43] efforts
[1:59:44] this is God's efforts
[1:59:46] okay so all that to us it starts being
[1:59:49] manifested right now
[1:59:51] now let's
[1:59:54] well it's 12 o'clock five minutes more
[1:59:58] I'm not
[2:00:00] I'm not like Pastor Cindy it's two hours
[2:00:03] three hours
[2:00:05] now we were in the touch of God Express
[2:00:08] right here in the sixth dimension
[2:00:11] thoughts
[2:00:12] all that to us in God is right here in
[2:00:15] this dimension
[2:00:16] okay
[2:00:17] and the first creation that was made is
[2:00:19] Christ
[2:00:20] the logos the theophany
[2:00:23] the Sun
[2:00:25] the sun okay he said he wants to be a
[2:00:29] father
[2:00:30] so that that that that that that
[2:00:31] identity has to do with the Sun so right
[2:00:34] here is the John 10 30. I and my father
[2:00:39] are one you see that
[2:00:42] and this is right here exclusion to
[2:00:44] verse 9.
[2:00:46] God but the God had manifested in the
[2:00:48] right not flesh yet not flesh yet in
[2:00:51] that word
[2:00:54] when he stepped down here in flesh
[2:00:57] formed the same I and my father won the
[2:01:00] same Quran to verse 9.
[2:01:02] manifested In the Flesh now you being
[2:01:05] the attributes
[2:01:07] you are the attributes someone would and
[2:01:10] has to speak your representation
[2:01:12] because you were in the thoughts
[2:01:15] Pastor cuts the mind the prophet and the
[2:01:18] prophet cuts the mind of God
[2:01:21] you see and the pastor speaks the word
[2:01:23] you heard it when you heard it you
[2:01:26] realize who you are
[2:01:30] Ah that's hard that's that's hard
[2:01:32] statement
[2:01:33] but that's the truth
[2:01:37] if you never heard about the word
[2:01:40] you will never know who you are
[2:01:43] [Applause]
[2:01:44] praise God I Know Who You Are
[2:01:49] if the bride knew who she is
[2:01:52] then
[2:01:55] she will know who she was
[2:02:00] your host yours is in the thought now
[2:02:03] you are who who you are who you are now
[2:02:06] because you realize the manifestation
[2:02:08] the thoughts come into material
[2:02:10] materializing his body or being and walk
[2:02:13] with God
[2:02:17] thank you

[2:03:04] put their nose right here
[2:03:07] Paul tried to eliminate this barriers
[2:03:10] I'm not the body because I'm the nose no
[2:03:13] we are working in one
[2:03:15] we are part of the body
[2:03:18] I'm a body but when this part put into
