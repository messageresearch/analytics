[33:34] &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles with me, you
[33:36] could turn your Bibles to the book of
[33:37] St. John. First John should say,
[33:41] hallelujah.

[34:24] John in the Bible,
[34:26] &gt;&gt; you know. And this is the the younger
[34:28] disciples. The younger disciple. This
[34:31] was John. The Bible said he he was the
[34:33] disciple whom Jesus loved.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; He was always staying at the bosom of
[34:38] Jesus.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "For this is the
[34:43] love of God that we keep his
[34:46] commandments."

[37:20] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS A SON OF DAVID TO THE JEWS.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; OH, PRAISE GOD. AND WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO

[37:48] THE STORY IN THE BOOK OF MATTHEW, NOT
[37:51] JUST A STORY, BUT SOMETHING TRANSPIRE
[37:55] WHEN THE BIBLE SAID JESUS IN THE BOOK OF
[37:58] MATTHEW CHAPTER 15. IF YOU HAVE THE
[38:01] BIBLE, YOU COULD TURN IT WITH ME. I'M
[38:04] JUST LAYING OUT SOMETHING TO YOU.
[38:06] HALLELUJAH.
[38:08] WE TALK ABOUT HALLELUJAH. THE TREE
[38:11] SUNSHIP THAT JESUS CAME IN.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID HERE IN MATTHEW 15:E 21,
[38:20] THEN JESUS WENT THENCE AND DEPARTED IN
[38:23] THE COAST OF TYRIE AND SIDEN. IF YOU

[38:44] DAVID TO THE JEWS.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT A SON OF DAVID TO THE
[38:50] GENTILES.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. AND HERE WAS PASSING
[38:56] THROUGH THE GENTILE CITIES. AND THE
[38:59] BIBLE SAID IN VERSE 22, "AND BEHOLD, A
[39:03] WOMAN OF CANAAN CAME OUT OF THE SAME
[39:07] COAST AND CRIED UNTO HIM, SAYING, LORD,
[39:12] HAVE MERCY ON ME,
[39:15] &gt;&gt; OH LORD, THOU SON OF DAVID."
[39:22] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. WHEN YOU HALLELUJAH.
[39:26] WHEN YOU WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW,
[39:28] HALLELUJAH. WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
[39:30] MUST CALL HIM WITHOUT A REVELATION, YOU
[39:34] ARE IN TROUBLE.
[39:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GLORY TO GOD. IT TAKES
[39:39] REVELATION TO APPROACH HIM.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND YOU HAVE TO APPROACH HIM
[39:45] IN THE CORRECT ORDER.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[39:50] OH, PRAISE GOD. AND THE FATHER SAID HE
[39:54] ANSWERED HER NOT A WORD.
[39:58] HE SAID MY DAUGHTER IS GRIEVOUSLY VEXED
[40:01] WITH A DEVIL.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. HALLELUJAH.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; I THOUGHT THAT HE LOVES EVERYBODY.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; YES, HE LOVES EVERYBODY. BUT IT IS
[40:10] IMPORTANT TO APPROACH HIM IN THE RIGHT
[40:13] WAY.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW
[40:20] TO APPROACH HIM, TO KNOW HOW TO ADDRESS
[40:23] HIM. WE CAN ADDRESS HIM IN THE WRONG
[40:26] WAY.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[40:32] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, PEOPLE SHOULD BELIEVE THAT
[40:35] JESUS THEY WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE WHEN EVEN
[40:38] WHEN THEY'RE PRAYING, BROTHER DALE,
[40:40] &gt;&gt; THAT THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE PRAYING, THEY
[40:42] SAY, "JESUS OF NAZARETH."
[40:44] &gt;&gt; YES.
[40:46] JESUS OF NAZARETH. WHEN YOU'RE WHEN
[40:49] YOU'RE PRAYING IN SUCH MANNER AS SAID
[40:51] JESUS OF NAZARETH, IT MEANS YOU'RE
[40:54] FIXING YOU'RE FIXING HIM INTO A A A
[40:58] SPECIFIC LOCATION.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[41:00] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT JESUS OF NAZARETH. HE'S JESUS
[41:06] OF THE UNIVERSE.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; HE'S JESUS OF THE UNIVERSE. AND TODAY
[41:15] WHEN PEOPLE ARE PRAYING, HALLELUJAH, I
[41:18] LOOK AT THAT AS IGNORANCE, LACK OF
[41:21] KNOWLEDGE.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NO WONDER WHY BROTHER PETER
[41:25] WHEN HE CAUGHT THE REVELATION AND HE
[41:27] SAID THIS SAME JESUS WHOM YOU CRUCIFIED,
[41:32] GOD HAD MADE HIM LORD AND SAVIOR.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY WERE ADDRESSING HIM AS
[41:38] JESUS OF NAZARETH. AND BROTHER PETER
[41:41] SAID, "YOU MUST REPENT." AND THE REPENT
[41:44] MEANS CHANGE YOUR THINKING.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CHANGE YOUR THINKING.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEIR THINKING WAS HE WAS JESUS
[41:54] OF NAZARETH.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[42:02] OH, PRAISE GOD. AND THE BIBLE SAID,
[42:06] HALLELUJAH.
[42:09] VERSE 20. VERSE 23. BUT HE ANSWERED HER
[42:13] NOT A WORD. AND HIS DISCIPLES CAME AND
[42:17] BESOUGHT HIM, SAYING, "SEND HER AWAY."
[42:21] IN OTHER WORDS, HER LANGUAGE WAS
[42:24] DIFFERENT.
[42:26] SO THE DISCIPLES, THEY ALL SPAKE WITH
[42:30] GALILEE TONGUES,
[42:32] HEBREW. HALLELUJAH.
[42:35] SO THIS WOMAN HER LANGUAGE WAS SYRIAN.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO THE DISCIPLE DIDN'T
[42:42] UNDERSTAND HIS LANGUAGE. THAT'S WHY THEY
[42:46] SAID SHE CRY AFTER US.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; BUT JESUS, HE WAS LORD OF THE WHOLE
[42:56] UNIVERSE.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; HE UNDERSTOOD EVERY LANGUAGE.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS EVERY LANGUAGE. AMEN.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAID IN VERSE 24, "BUT HE
[43:16] ANSWERED AND SAID, I AM NOT SENT BUT
[43:20] UNTO THE LOST SHEEP OF THE HOUSE OF
[43:24] ISRAEL." IN OTHER WORDS, I'M NOT SENT TO
[43:27] YOU.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; I'M ONLY SENT TO ISRAEL.
[43:33] SHOWING THAT SHE WAS A GENTILE.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; BUT LOOK AT HER DETERMINATION.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT HER PERSEVERANCE.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; OH, PRAISE GOD.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I TELL YOU SAINTS, WE NEED
[43:50] PERSEVERANCE IN THIS SEASON.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO BE PERSEVERE IN OUR WORSHIP.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO BE PERSEVERE IN OUR CALLING.
[43:59] NO WONDER BUT A PORTION LET EVERY MAN
[44:02] ABIDE IN HIS CALLING WHEREIN HE IS
[44:05] CALLED.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO BE PERSEVERE.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; AND THIS WOMAN SHE WAS PERSEVERE.
[44:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAID THEN CAME SHE.
[44:23] HALLELUJAH.
[44:24] I LOVE THIS PART.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART.
[44:29] FIRST SHE ADDRESSED HIM AS THOSE SON OF
[44:33] DAVID
[44:36] BUT HERE THE APPROACH CHANGED
[44:40] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT IT NOW VERSE 25 SHE CHANGED HER
[44:44] APPROACH
[44:47] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES THAT'S WHAT GOD NEED FROM US
[44:50] &gt;&gt; IS OUR APPROACH TO CHANGE
[44:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH
[44:55] IN VERSE 25 THEN CAME TREE AND WORSHIP
[45:00] HIM.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; SAY LORD.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; NOT SON OF DAVID NOW.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; BUT MY LORD.
[45:09] &gt;&gt; MY LORD. YES.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; DID YOU KNOW WHEN HE ADDRESSED HIM AS
[45:11] YOUR LORD, HE CANNOT DENY YOU.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[45:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE SAID TO HIS DISCIPLE, YOU
[45:20] CALL ME LORD AND MASTER. SO AM I. YOU
[45:24] SAID WELL.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ALL THINGS WERE CREATED BY
[45:29] HIM.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; SO HE'S LORD OVER EVERYTHING.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; OH, PRAISE GOD. AND SHE CHANGED YOUR
[45:37] APPROACH AND WORSHIP.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; You see, WORSHIP IS IMPORTANT.

[45:47] &gt;&gt; GOD. HALLELUJAH. YOU WILL GET THE
[45:49] RESULT.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[45:56] AND THE BIBLE SAID, SAYING, LORD, HELP
[46:00] ME. VERSE 26, BUT HE ANSWERED AND SAID,
[46:05] IT IS NOT MEAT TO TAKE THE CHILDREN'S
[46:09] BREAD AND TO CAUSE IT TO DOGS BECAUSE
[46:12] THE GENTILE WERE CONSIDERED DOGS.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE CONSIDERED REMONGERS.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; OH, PRAISE GOD. YES.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO JESUS SAID IT IS NOT MEAT
[46:28] TO TAKE THE CHILDREN'S BREAD.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; HE WAS INSULTING HER.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN.

[46:46] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WILL THROW THINGS OUT.
[46:48] HALLELUJAH.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU CANNOT COME TO GOD WITH
[46:52] EMOTION. RIGHT.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU CANNOT APPROACH HIM WITH
[46:57] EMOTION. YOU GOT TO YOU GOT TO COME WITH

[47:31] CRUMBS WHICH FALL FROM THEIR MASTER'S
[47:36] TABLE.

[50:15] &gt;&gt; IT MEANS ADORATION.

[51:56] EARTH.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEAR THE NEWS ABOUT
[51:59] IT.

[52:15] TOLD HIM TO BUILD AN ARK AND THAT WAS IN
[52:17] OUR AGE. YEAH.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID THAT GOD GOD REVEALED TO HIM
[52:23] THAT HE'S GOING TO SEND A FLOOD AND
[52:26] PEOPLE ACTUALLY BELIEVE IT.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; GOD.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; You see, SO WE MUST ABLE TO PLACE THE
[52:38] WORD IN ITS CORRECT SEASON,
[52:41] &gt;&gt; IN HIS CORRECT TIME,
[52:43] &gt;&gt; FOR HIS CORRECT PURPOSE.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; WHAT GOD REQUIRE FOR THIS AGE AND TIME
[52:52] NOW IS FOR US TO GET BACK INTO THE WORD.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN.

[53:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; LET'S TURN OUR BIBLES TO THE BOOK OF
[53:13] GENESIS.
[53:16] GENESIS 22,
[53:19] we see that
[53:22] Abraham,
[53:25] &gt;&gt; HE WAS A MIGHTY MAN,
[53:28] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[53:30] &gt;&gt; And also a prophet.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, I LOVE TO TALK ABOUT ABRAHAM.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; YES.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID HE'S THE FATHER
[53:42] &gt;&gt; OF FAITH,
[53:43] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[53:46] HALLELUJAH.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; AND IN VERSE 22,
[53:52] I'M JUST GOING to go really slow with
[53:53] this.
[53:55] AND IT CAME TO PASS
[53:58] after these things.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD DID TEMPT ABRAHAM.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO PAUSE ON THAT. TEMP.
[54:12] SEE THE WORD THE TEMPT. HALLELUJAH.
[54:17] THE BIBLE SAID, JAMES SAID, "LET NO MAN
[54:20] SAY YOU'RE TEMPTED BY GOD WITH EVIL."
[54:24] BECAUSE GOD DOES NOT TEMPT YOU WITH
[54:26] EVIL.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; ISN'T THAT RIGHT?
[54:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "A MAN IS TEMPTED WHEN HE'S
[54:34] DRAWN AWAY
[54:36] &gt;&gt; BY HIS OWN LUST AND ENTICE."
[54:38] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. YEAH.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; SO THIS WHAT IS THIS STEM NOW THAT
[54:43] HALLELUJAH THAT GOD HERE IS TALKING
[54:46] ABOUT TO ABRAHAM. THIS STEM MEANS TEST.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; GOD TEST IS DIFFERENT FROM SATAN TEST.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; GOD LOVES TO TEST HIS PEOPLE.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?
[55:05] &gt;&gt; GOD LOVE TO TEST HIS PEOPLE.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; AND THE REASON WHY GOD TEST HIS PEOPLE
[55:12] IS BECAUSE HE WANT TO CONFIRM,
[55:15] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[55:16] &gt;&gt; GOD WANT TO CONFIRM.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT YOU ARE TRUE.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; THAT YOU ARE RIGHTEOUS.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID THERE'S NO OTHER MAN UP ON THE
[55:28] EARTH THAT IS MORE RIGHTEOUS THAN JOB.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Y.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE THAT? AND GOD TEST JOB,
[55:37] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AMEN.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; BUT SATAN TEST IS DIFFERENT.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; WHEN SATAN TEST SOMEBODY, HE WANTS TO
[55:46] CORRUPT YOU.
[55:47] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[55:50] &gt;&gt; THAT IS HIS PURPOSE IS TO CORRUPT AND TO
[55:53] DESTROY YOU.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; AND TO GET YOU WEAK,
[55:58] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[55:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN GOD TESTS YOU, HE WANTS TO
[56:02] CONFIRM.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; AND HE WANTS TO STRENGTHEN YOU.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. AMEN.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[56:09] OH, praise God.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; HERE GO. HE SAID, "AND IT CAME TO PASS
[56:17] THAT GOD DID TEMPT ABRAHAM." LET ME READ
[56:20] IT IN HIS CORRECT IN A IN THE CORRECT
[56:22] WAY.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; IT CAME TO PASS THAT GOD DID TEST
[56:27] ABRAHAM,
[56:30] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[56:31] &gt;&gt; SO, I'm reading it in in in HIS CORRECT
[56:33] TERM. THAT GOD DID TEST ABRAHAM.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[56:44] AND GOD SAID UNTO ABRAHAM,
[56:48] AND HE SAID UNTO HIM, ABRAHAM, AND HE
[56:51] SAID, BEHOLD, HERE I AM. HE SAID, TAKE
[56:55] NOW THY SON, JESUS.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; THINE ONLY SON.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Look at that. Look at the first test.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; TAKE THINE ONLY SON.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; LET ME ASK YOU THE QUESTION. HOW MUCH
[57:12] SON DID ABRAHAM HAVE?
[57:18] &gt;&gt; He had two son.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; HE GOT THE FIRST SON WAS ISHMAEL.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; YES.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; BUT ISHMAEL WHEN HE GET ISHMAEL HIS NAME
[57:28] WAS ABRAHAM.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; HIS NAME WAS ABRAHAM.
[57:32] RIGHT.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; YOU FOLLOWING ME NOW?
[57:36] &gt;&gt; HIS NAME WAS ABRAHAM.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; THEN GOD CHANGED HIS NAME AFTERWARDS TO
[57:43] ABRAHAM.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; AND THEN HE GET UM ISAAC.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET SAID, "HALLELUJAH." HE SAID,
[57:51] "EVERY NAME CARRY A SPIRIT."
[57:55] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "THE FIRST THING GOD DOES IS
[57:57] CHANGE A MAN'S NAME."
[57:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:02] HALLELUJAH.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD SAID TAKE THINE ONLY SON
[58:08] ABRAHAM
[58:10] BECAUSE OF HIS LOVE BECAUSE OF HIS
[58:13] obedience
[58:15] &gt;&gt; glory TO GOD.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; AND YOU TALK ABOUT THIS SON THAT GOD
[58:21] PROMISED HIM.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; HE WAITED FOR THIS SON FOR 25 YEARS.
[58:26] RIGHT.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Y
[58:29] &gt;&gt; 25 YEARS HE WAITED FOR THIS SON.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THE SON WAS ABOUT 8 YEARS OLD,
[58:37] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[58:37] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID, "NOW, ABRAHAM,
[58:41] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SEE
[58:43] &gt;&gt; IF YOU LOVE YOUR SON MORE THAN ME.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO SEE IF YOU'RE FAITHFUL TO YOUR
[58:49] SON MORE THAN ME."
[58:51] JESUS MY LORD.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THAT EACH TIME YOU GROW, GOD
[58:56] TESTS YOU.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; EACH TIME, EACH LEVELS THAT YOU GROW,
[59:01] THERE'S A TEST TO THE LEVEL.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; YOU HEARING ME, SOMEBODY?
[59:05] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE LEVEL, IF YOU'RE AT LEVEL
[59:07] FAITH, THERE'S A TEST AT LEVEL FAITH.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[59:10] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE AT LEVEL VIRTUE,
[59:13] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A TEST AT LEVEL VIRTUE.
[59:16] CAN YOU SEE THE STATUE OF A
[59:18] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SEE THE PYRAMID THERE?
[59:19] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; EACH LEVEL THAT YOU GO, THERE'S A TEST.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; AND EACH TIME YOU OVERCOME THAT TEST,
[59:32] YOU KEEP GROWING.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; YOU KEEP GROWING.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM ABRAHAM'S SON HAD TO GO THROUGH
[59:38] THAT. ISAAC HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT.
[59:41] AMEN.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE BIBLE SAID HE DIG A WELL, THERE
[59:45] WAS A TEST.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; AND HE MOVE AWAY AND DIG ANOTHER WELL.
[59:49] AND THERE WAS ANOTHER TEST.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; AND HE MOVE AWAY AND DIG ANOTHER WELL.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; ANOTHER TEST.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. THERE WAS ANOTHER TEST.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; SO EACH LEVEL YOU KEEP CLIMBING.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; THERE ARE TESTS.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; AND THAT TEST IS MAKING YOU STRONGER AND
[1:00:05] STRONGER AND STRONGER
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID, HALLELUJAH. HE
[1:00:10] SAID, "YOU SHALL CHANGE FROM GLORY UNTO
[1:00:12] GLORY UNTO GLORY."
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WE'RE HAVING CHURCH THIS

[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; AND THE WORD OF GOD SAID,
[1:00:31] "THINE ONLY SON ISAAC, WHOM THOU
[1:00:35] LOVEST."
[1:00:37] AMEN.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whom thou lovest.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; I love my God.

[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; And offered HIM THERE FOR A BURNT
[1:00:58] OFFERING UP UPON ONE OF THE MOUNTAINS
[1:01:01] WHICH I WILL TELL THEE OF.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. God was very clear.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; He was very clear.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "I WANT YOU TO OFFER YOU AS a
[1:01:12] sacrifice."
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE PURPOSE? WHEN YOU HEAR
[1:01:16] SACRIFICE, WHAT COMES TO YOU is is to
[1:01:19] kill.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Oh God, you know that when God see that
[1:01:26] you love something more.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; HE WANT YOU TO SACRIFICE IT.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; HE WANT YOU TO SACRIFICE IT.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. HALLELUJAH. HE WANT YOU TO KILL
[1:01:36] IT.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; JESUS. Some persons love money more than
[1:01:41] they love God.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; And God say, "I WANT YOU TO SACRIFICE
[1:01:44] THAT."
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; SACRIFICE IT.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; SOME PERSONS LOVE THEIR WIFE MORE THAN
[1:01:47] THEY LOVE GOD. AND GOD SAY, "I WANT YOU
[1:01:49] TO SACRIFICE IT."
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE LOVE THEIR HUSBAND MORE THAN
[1:01:53] GOD. AND GOD SAY, "I WANT YOU TO
[1:01:55] SACRIFICE IT."
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus my God.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember we read the
[1:02:02] scripture and this is the love
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; when we keep his commandments.

[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "OFFER HIM THERE FOR A BURNT
[1:02:16] OFFERING UPON ONE OF THE MOUNTAINS WHICH
[1:02:20] I WILL TELL THEE OF."
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; SO IT WAS GOD WHO WAS GOING TO TELL
[1:02:26] ABRAHAM WHICH MOUNTAIN TO GO. ABRAHAM
[1:02:29] didn't know where he was going.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; He was just FOLLOWING INSTRUCTION.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, HE was obedient.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE OBEDIENT.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; HIS FAITH PRODUCED OBEDIENCE.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; OH, PRAISE GOD.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:02:50] AND THE BIBLE SAID THEN AND THE THIRD
[1:02:54] DAY. BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT THIS MOUNTAIN
[1:02:58] ACCORDING TO HISTORY
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; THIS MOUNTAIN ABRAHAM WAS DWELLING IN

[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; THE DISTANCE WAS 40 MILES.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; WOW. WOW.
[1:03:18] BUT THE BIBLE SAID ON THE THIRD DAY,
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; IT TAKE ABRAHAM ACTUALLY 3 DAYS TO REACH
[1:03:25] 40 MILES AND IT TAKE HIM THREE DAYS. IT
[1:03:29] SHOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN THREE DAYS.

[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; AND THE THE PROPHET PICK UP THE
[1:03:44] INSPIRATION,
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AND HE SAID THAT THREE DAYS WAS A
[1:03:48] TYPE OF JUSTIFICATION.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT THREE DAYS WAS A TYPE OF
[1:03:55] JUSTIFICATION. IT WAS A TYPE OF
[1:03:58] SANCTIFICATION. IT WAS A TIME OF THE
[1:04:00] BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THREE DAYS JOURNEY.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; OH, PRAISE GOD.
[1:04:14] FAR TO MARS WAS THE DISTANCE
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; AND IT TAKE ABRAHAM 3 DAYS
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAID
[1:04:25] HE LIFTED IT WAS ON THE THIRD DAY HE
[1:04:29] LIFTED UP HIS EYES.
[1:04:33] THAT WORD LIFTED LIFT UP MEANS TO RISE.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; IN OUR JOURNEY WE HAVE TO RISE
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. HALLELUJAH. Come with ME NOW.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; IN OUR JOURNEY, YOU HAVE TO TAKE UP

[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; IT MEANS TO PICK UP YOURSELF,
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ON THE THIRD DAY, YOU GOT TO
[1:05:18] PICK UP YOURSELF. HE SAID, THE PROPHET
[1:05:21] SAID, YOU GOT TO BE PERSEVERE.
[1:05:24] HE SAID, HALLELUJAH. HE SAID, GLORY TO
[1:05:27] GOD. HE SAID, JACOB WAS PERSEVERE. HE
[1:05:31] SAID, I NEED THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, I NEED THE BIRTHRIGHT.

[1:06:53] MOUNTAIN CAN ALSO MEAN A PROMOTION.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; IF GOD SAID I WANT YOU TO COME TO A
[1:07:00] MOUNTAIN, meaning I'm giving you a
[1:07:02] promotion.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah.

[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; HE SAID YOU'RE UP MOUNT CARMEL,
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE MOUNT ZION. AND HE SAID THERE'S
[1:07:20] ANOTHER MOUNTAIN
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; AND HE CALLED IT MOUNT RAPTURING
[1:07:23] SHOWDOWN.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:29] AND YOU NOTICE THOSE THREE MOUNTAIN THE
[1:07:33] SPIRIT OF ELIJAH IS ALWAYS PRESENT.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH ALWAYS

[1:07:46] MOUNT CARMEL. ELIJAH WAS THERE
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; AND MOUNT AND MOUNT TRANSFIGURATION

[1:07:55] WAS PRESENT. IS A MOUNT RAPTURING
[1:07:59] SHOWDOWN.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; THE SPIRIT OF ELIJAH IS PRESENT AGAIN.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:08] SO WHEN GOD SAID, YOU GOING TO BE THERE
[1:08:11] AND RAPTURING SHOW, IT MEANS HE'S READY
[1:08:15] TO PROMOTE YOU.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; IT'S YOUR PROMOTION.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? THE BIBLE
[1:08:26] SAID CALEB WHEN HE WAS WITH MOSES AND
[1:08:30] MOSES SAID, "CALEB, I'M GOING TO GIVE
[1:08:32] YOU THAT MOUNTAIN.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THAT MOUNTAIN."
[1:08:37] WHAT WAS THAT? THAT WAS A PROMOTION.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; AND THEN WHEN JOSHUA TOOK OVER, CALEB
[1:08:44] SAID, "NOW I'M READY."
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I WAS 40 YEARS OLD." WHAT
[1:08:50] MOSES TOLD ME THAT THE MOUNTAIN IS MINE.
[1:08:53] HE SAID, "I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE
[1:08:56] AMMONACHITE TRIBE. I DON'T CARE ABOUT
[1:08:59] THE GIANTS BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN GIVEN A
[1:09:02] PROMOTION." HE SAID, "I WAS STRONG AND
[1:09:05] NOW I'M STRONGER AND I'M 85 YEARS OLD.
[1:09:09] GIVE ME MY MOUNTAIN."
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; GIVE ME MY MY MY RAPTURE SHOULDER
[1:09:18] MOUNTAIN. AMEN.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; AND IN ORDER IN ORDER TO ACCESS THAT
[1:09:41] MOUNTAIN,

[1:09:44] GIANTS.

[1:09:48] YOU GOT TO SLEW SOME GIANTS.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; OH, OH, GOD. YOU GOT TO SLEW GIANTS
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; TO REACH THAT WAY.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; OH, praise God.

[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THE MOUNTAIN IS YOURS,
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; JESUS.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; IT IS YOURS.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CALEB SAID, "GIVE ME MY
[1:10:22] MOUNTAIN."
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; YES, JESUS.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; GOD PROMISE US IN THIS AGE OF BODY

[1:10:40] MY JOY. GIVE ME MY PEACE. GIVE ME MY
[1:10:44] HAPPINESS. GIVE ME MY HEALTH.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME NOW. HALLELUJAH. WE TAKE BACK
[1:10:52] WHAT HAS BEEN PROMISED TO US.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; MANY TIMES PEOPLE HALLELUJAH. THEY START

[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:11:23] Praise God.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES
[1:11:30] HE SAID, "Lift up,
[1:11:33] LIFT UP YOUR EYES." THE WORD HIGH
[1:11:38] STILL AT GENESIS 22.
[1:11:41] WHEN ABRAHAM LIFTED UP HIS HIGH, THE
[1:11:44] WORD I MEANS SHOWING MENTALLY QUALITY,
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; IT ALSO MEANS SPIRITUAL.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; JESUS. My God.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Did you know? DID YOU KNOW THAT SAME
[1:11:57] MOUNTAIN WAS THE VERY MOUNTAIN THAT
[1:11:59] JESUS WAS CRUCIFIED?
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; WOW. WOW.
[1:12:04] Oh my god. That was called Mount MARIAH
[1:12:09] IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. WHEN JESUS WAS
[1:12:12] CRUCIFIED,
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE VERY SAME MOUNTAIN,
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; HE WAS CRUCIFIED.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; NO WONDER WHY THE BROTHER CAUGHT THE THE
[1:12:22] INSPIR THE REVELATION AND SAID WHEN
[1:12:25] ABRAM WAS ON THE MOUNTAIN, HE SAW HIM.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; HE SAW HIM AT MOUNT CALVARY.

[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET
[1:12:46] THE PROPHET EVEN WENT FURTHER AND SAID
[1:12:50] ABRAHAM BELIEVE THAT IF HIS SON WAS
[1:12:53] SACRIFICED, GOD WAS ABLE TO RAISE WRECK
[1:12:56] HIM BACK UP AGAIN.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS ABLE TO RESURRECT BACK ISAIAH.
[1:13:06] ISAIAH AGAIN CAME.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; GOD IS ABLE SAINTS.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; HE'S MORE THAN ABLE.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; OH, glory to God.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:21] Jesus. MY GOD.
[1:13:24] HE SAID
[1:13:26] IT was spiritual.
[1:13:30] HIS EYES HE WAS SEEING THROUGH THE EYES
[1:13:32] OF GOD
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; UP ON THAT MOUNTAIN HE SAW A SACRIFICE
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; RIGHT
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; AND THAT SACRIFICE WAS THE LAMB OF GOD
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY JOHN SAID BEHOLD THE LAMB OF
[1:13:46] GOD THAT TOOK AWAY THE SINS OF THE world
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; right
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; hallelujah

[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE BIBLE SAID IN ST. JOHN 8
[1:14:15] VERSE 30-32
[1:14:19] WHEN JESUS WAS SPEAKING TO ALL THE JEWS
[1:14:22] THAT BELIEVE ON HIM. Mighty God.
[1:14:28] THE BIBLE SAID IN VERSE 30, "AS HE SPAKE
[1:14:32] THESE WORDS, MANY BELIEVE ON HIM."
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Did you know even today is the same
[1:14:39] thing?
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is the same thing around this
[1:14:43] message.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Many believe on Christ.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; BUT NOT MANY ARE CONTINUING IN THE WORD.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; MANY BELIEVE
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; MANY BELIEVE ON THE BRIDEGROOM.
[1:15:02] MANY BELIEVE ON THE PROPHET. BUT THEY'RE
[1:15:05] NOT CONTINUING IN THE IN THE WORD.
[1:15:09] THEY HAVE MOVED AWAY
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; FROM THE WORD.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; YEAH. YEAH.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my god.
[1:15:21] BUY
[1:15:23] JESUS SAID VERSE 31. THEN SAID JESUS TO
[1:15:27] THOSE JEWS
[1:15:30] WHICH BELIEVE ON HIM,
[1:15:33] IF YOU CONTINUE
[1:15:36] IN MY WORD,
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? YES, SIR.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; THEN ARE YOU MY DISCIPLES INDEED.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; That's the difference today.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Many persons are not continuing the word
[1:15:47] of Christ.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. RIGHT.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THERE ARE SO MANY FALLING
[1:15:51] AWAY.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A HUGE FALLING AWAY TODAY. AMEN.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT CONTINUING.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, JESUS.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "AND YOU SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH."
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Because you continue in the work. You
[1:16:21] see the IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUING. WHEN
[1:16:23] YOU CONTINUE IN THE WORD,
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; I'm going. But you see, you see the
[1:16:31] importance.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE HOW WORSHIP IS?
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; WORSHIP IS TRUTH.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; YEAH.

[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AMEN.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; WORSHIP IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH TO GET
[1:16:53] YOUR VICTORY.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "YOU SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH,
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE."
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; FREE.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; NOT SET YOU FREE NOW,
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; BUT MAKE YOU FREE.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SET FREE
[1:17:12] AND MAKE FREE.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; OH, GOD.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. DID YOU KNOW THAT ISRAEL,
[1:17:22] HALLELUJAH, THEY WERE FREE PHYSICALLY,
[1:17:26] BUT THEY WEREN'T FREE MENTALLY?
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; You hear WHAT I SAID? ISRAEL WHEN THEY
[1:17:37] CAME OUT OF EGYPT, THEY WERE PHYSICALLY
[1:17:39] FREE,
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WERE MENTALLY FREE. RIGHT?
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU STUDY THAT, ALL THEY WERE
[1:17:46] THINKING ABOUT IS EGYPT.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; OH, WE WOULD HAVE HIT THIS IN EGYPT.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; WE WOULD HAVE TO SUFFER LIKE HOW WE COME
[1:17:53] INTO THE WILDERNESS.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; SO, THEY WERE MENTALLY FREE.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THE SHOE MAKE YOU FREE, YOU ARE
[1:18:01] PHYSICALLY FREE AND MENTALLY FREE.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; G.

[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; THEIR THINKING IS STILL IN DENOMINATION,
[1:18:37] RIGHT?
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD.
[1:18:42] HALLELUJAH. WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE THEY'RE
[1:18:45] NOT CONTINUING IN THE WORD.

[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHERE TO GO.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU GO
[1:19:17] OVER THERE, GOD IS WITH YOU.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; G.

[1:19:22] HE'S THERE.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; AND IF I SHOULD TAKE THE SHIP AND GO TO
[1:19:26] THE OTHERMOST PART OF THE EARTH, GOD IS
[1:19:28] THERE."

[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:35] Praise God.

[1:19:44] THE BIBLE said
[1:19:47] seven compounding.
[1:19:52] EVERY TIME WHEN YOU COME UP ON THE
[1:19:55] MOUNTAIN,
[1:19:57] three things God is doing.
[1:20:00] He's revealing his word.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah.
[1:20:04] God is fulfilling prophecy.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Can I say this
[1:20:13] that you are a fulfillment of prophecy?
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Every one of us here.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; He's a fulfillment of prophecy.

[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; REVELATION 22 IS THE LAST CHAPTER.
[1:20:40] You close the book.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NO MORE MYSTERY TO BE
[1:20:45] REVEALED.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WAS IN ADAM, SHE WAS A MYSTERY
[1:20:55] TO ADAM.
[1:20:57] BUT WHEN GOD PERFORMED THAT OPERATION
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; AND CAME OUT OF ADAM, SHE NO LONGER

[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; NO,
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; SHE BECAME A REVELATION.

[1:21:15] REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
