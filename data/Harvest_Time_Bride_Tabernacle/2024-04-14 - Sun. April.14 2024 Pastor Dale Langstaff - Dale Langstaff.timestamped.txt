[38:57] anything at all that's
[39:00] right I happen to be a part of that
[39:03] operation a little bit and many of the

[39:10] December two to four times

[39:26] world event
[39:28] amen and brother Dale lives it I don't
[39:31] just preach it because I told you last
[39:33] Sunday I'd actually considered selling a
[39:35] farm not that that will matter whether
[39:37] it's uh but uh Iran any anybody's heard
[39:44] this knows this maybe Iran for the first
[39:46] time in history since Israel has become
[39:48] a nation has bombed
[39:51] Israel they bombed them yesterday or
[39:54] today missiles and uh so there's so
[39:59] there's an update with that am I is my
[40:01] mic
[40:02] on I can't hear myself uh so first off
[40:08] with Israel's war in the Gaza Strip
[40:10] Biden they had some human I'm just
[40:14] telling you they had some people there
[40:15] feeding the people and they got killed
[40:19] and Biden said if you don't bring in
[40:21] humanitarian Aid we're pulling all
[40:23] our pulling all our support
[40:28] sounds like prophecy to
[40:31] me and
[40:34] then uh within a day because things are
[40:39] going
[40:41] fast uh you know there's things going
[40:44] over there and we're not going to get
[40:45] into it in great detail but but Iran has
[40:47] bombed Israel directly it's the first
[40:50] time ever that they haven't went through
[40:51] terrorist groups and so Putin has went
[40:54] on
[40:55] record and Biden he said if you think
[40:58] you're going to support Israel and we're
[41:00] not going to support
[41:02] Iran you're having a
[41:04] dream said if you bomb Iran with Israel
[41:07] we're bombing Israel with
[41:09] Iran and I have those videos on my phone
[41:12] for anybody like to see them and I'm
[41:14] just na even enough to believe part of
[41:16] these
[41:18] people and I'm telling you we're going
[41:21] to go home very soon it's just it's just
[41:24] you don't have to believe me but it's
[41:25] going to happen it's going to go happen
[41:28] and also we want to pull up
[41:30] a a picture whenever you want
[41:34] Amy just along that same testimony we
[41:37] were blessed to uh we we did cancel
[41:40] church on Wednesday but we were able to
[41:43] get our U on the wheat when many people
[41:46] didn't but God is very very good and
[41:50] this brother here is a good friend of
[41:54] mine and I'm preaching today because of
[41:58] what I talked to him
[42:00] about in the Ottawa
[42:02] convention in
[42:04] November or
[42:07] October he preached the message
[42:10] for I think over 50 years he's he's
[42:13] African he was born in Zimbabwe I
[42:17] believe he moved to London
[42:20] England and he died instantly at his
[42:24] church on
[42:25] Wednesday and left a family and a church
[42:29] with a big
[42:31] surprise no Pastor no husband no
[42:35] Daddy I don't believe he had been sick a
[42:37] day in his life and but you
[42:41] know I remember Peter
[42:45] Chandler the easy way to remember him
[42:48] would be
[42:49] this everybody that was around him was
[42:53] more important than him that that's just
[42:57] that's just how he was
[43:03] made and that's just how he lived his
[43:08] life he will be there I'll guarantee you
[43:13] and if I could be him I would be he was
[43:17] a great great man of
[43:21] God and uh and we thank God for his life
[43:25] and being able I you know I had some
[43:28] questions about going to the convention
[43:30] but I'm sure glad I was
[43:32] there now you know sometimes we wonder
[43:35] why we didn't get pictures you know I
[43:36] talked to him privately I talked to him
[43:39] with Len I seen him not privately that
[43:41] you know I never got a single picture in
[43:43] the picture with
[43:45] him but uh it don't matter I was his
[43:49] friend and I remember when we started
[43:52] the when God started our church 10 years
[43:55] ago
[43:57] it's over 10 years now and we were at
[44:00] John Dan was for a big International
[44:03] Convention there was preachers there
[44:05] from all over the world literally that
[44:08] is the
[44:09] truth when they preached that
[44:11] International conventions they had three
[44:13] preachers preach in one
[44:15] message correct three I believe they
[44:18] timed them and we went
[44:23] over to Brother jun's house of Filipino
[44:26] Brothers
[44:28] and there was a hundred people
[44:31] there there

[47:27] amazing Brothers
[47:29] amen
[47:31] hallelujah amen amen before we read our
[47:35] scripture you know this message I'm
[47:37] preaching to myself this is not geared
[47:39] to this church this is not geared to any
[47:43] single individual so don't take it
[47:45] personal you can throw all the eggs at
[47:48] me it'll it might I don't want it to
[47:51] come across like that it's not God's
[47:54] intent it's not my intent
[47:59] amen and through
[48:02] cons covetousness shall they with
[48:06] foreign foreign feain words sorry make
[48:10] merchandise of you whose judgment now is
[48:14] long time lingered not and their
[48:18] damnation slumbereth not Lord Jesus we
[48:21] pray you'll add your blessing to this
[48:24] word and bless your bride of Christ in a
[48:27] supernatural way Lord Jesus just many
[48:30] out but bless them too Lord
[48:33] Jesus and we pray that you'll be with
[48:35] the ministering of the word Jesus in
[48:37] your name we pray amen amen you may have
[48:40] your seats we see here that Peter is
[48:43] talking
[48:44] about that they will make
[48:47] merchandise of you now I I love the
[48:51] message Hub and pray that God will bless
[48:53] the people that made it but brother
[48:56] Brown never commented on this exact
[48:59] verse but he had commented on two verses
[49:03] before it but he commented six times on
[49:06] the very next verse and the next verse
[49:09] it talks about you know uh false
[49:12] prophets and different things we're
[49:13] going to read a couple scriptures later
[49:16] down but I want you to in the Bible it
[49:18] talks about false angels and it said if
[49:21] God the next well maybe pull up the next
[49:23] verse I don't have it in my
[49:24] iPad it said for if God God spare not
[49:27] the angels that sin but cast them into
[49:31] hell and delivered them into chains of
[49:33] Darkness to be reserved for judgment
[49:37] amen we can go back to our other
[49:38] scripture am or we're going to jump
[49:40] ahead to verse 20 actually but uh here
[49:43] the Bible's talking about angels that
[49:45] God didn't
[49:48] spare and brother Bram commented to that
[49:51] because of a prophet he had Insight that
[49:53] we don't
[49:55] have and he said these Angels were
[49:59] men he said they were
[50:04] Messengers
[50:06] actually he said they were
[50:11] preachers and if you and the Bible's
[50:14] talking here about false prophets and
[50:16] false
[50:17] preachers and there's people that are
[50:19] preaching the word
[50:21] false and God will take care of them
[50:24] people and here the Bible talks about
[50:26] them as
[50:27] Angels but God never spared the angels
[50:30] in heaven and brother Brown breaks that
[50:32] down and we're not going to go into that
[50:33] cuz that's not we're preaching on but he
[50:34] talks about the language there and how
[50:36] it's an A and it's meaning men and it's
[50:39] meaning Messengers meaning
[50:41] ministers
[50:43] ministers that have been false brought
[50:46] false word Andor made M
[50:50] merchandise out of the
[50:52] people and I want to tell you something
[50:54] this morning church is not about a
[50:55] business
[50:57] and it's not about popularity it's about
[51:00] God it is about God it's not about who's
[51:03] your pastor any amen it's about God it's
[51:07] not about this building it's going to
[51:09] burn down
[51:10] someday I hope not till I'm gone but you
[51:14] see what I'm saying and we're living in
[51:16] a
[51:18] world if you're not in a church that
[51:20] they're and I
[51:22] oh I pray you that's not the case
[51:25] here but if if you're not in a church
[51:27] that's making merchandise of you you're
[51:30] in a world that
[51:33] is and if you think you can work hard
[51:35] and get rich you're having a
[51:39] dream you're having a complete dream I
[51:41] was telling some minut nights down there
[51:43] I said you
[51:44] know well you're just having a dream I'm
[51:47] not going to go to that because if you
[51:50] make anything the government takes
[51:55] it and
[51:58] if you the government don't take it then
[52:00] you give it to all the merchandise of
[52:02] Walmart and and uh in Amazon and
[52:10] Hollywood before that let me just read a
[52:12] quote to lay a foundation this this was
[52:15] my last quote so I'm preaching the end
[52:16] of my message we can go home I said oh
[52:19] Church leave
[52:20] Hollywood uh Delila he's talking about
[52:24] Samson alone
[52:28] she'll take your soul he's just talking
[52:31] about Hollywood the world the system the
[52:34] system will take your
[52:36] soul this a prophet that believes in
[52:38] predestination this is a 63 quote by the
[52:41] way he said she's going to kill
[52:44] you it's not the the Delila it's the
[52:49] spirit they've made merchandise of us
[52:51] all you're either buying Hollywood
[52:53] videos or you're buying stuff from
[52:55] Amazon that you don't need
[52:57] or you go to Walmart and you buy
[52:59] something you don't
[53:00] need and it will kill you and she's this
[53:04] is the spirit the spirit is choking the
[53:08] spiritual
[53:10] life out of you there you
[53:15] go this a prophet that had
[53:17] predestination he didn't he didn't make
[53:19] no disclaimers for that the spirit this
[53:22] this this Delila spirit is choking
[53:26] spiritual life out of you leave
[53:30] her your Hollywood Showmanship on the
[53:35] platform your Hollywood your tensil your
[53:39] meetings that has to got to be so just
[53:43] just got to be all in an evangelist come
[53:47] to
[53:48] town you have to promise him so much
[53:52] money or he won't even wholeheartedly
[53:56] to God and the word let's cry out once
[54:00] more Lord show us your presence and here
[54:05] here's here's the prophet talking about
[54:08] we are becoming
[54:10] merchandise of other
[54:13] people amen now we we must live in some
[54:18] country so we will have to you know obey
[54:22] by those merchandise laws but God help
[54:26] us
[54:26] when we're making
[54:28] choices that we're not just becoming
[54:31] merchandise of where you shop and where
[54:34] you live remember I talked about just
[54:35] making payments to John Deere or New
[54:39] Holland amen you can you can and I
[54:43] there's nothing wrong with having
[54:45] whatever you need I'm not preaching
[54:46] against Goods or not not at all but if
[54:49] you're living if you're working for your
[54:52] own kingdom your new car your new truck
[54:54] or your new house or or your new uh
[54:57] entertainment center or even your new
[55:00] entertainment center in the church if we
[55:03] could get a better entertainment center
[55:05] here and and you know what I mean then
[55:08] you're become merchandise your property
[55:12] of somebody else's because you can
[55:15] be
[55:17] bought you can be
[55:21] bought amen what's your price for your
[55:24] soul what would you give for your soul
[55:27] in exchange for your soul and the whole
[55:31] world and and God helped me because
[55:36] brother Dale deals with this also and so
[55:39] let's just drop to verse 20 and it says
[55:42] for if after they had escaped the the PO
[55:45] the help me out honey pollution of the
[55:48] world through knowledge of the Lord
[55:50] Jesus Christ they are again entangled
[55:53] therein and overcome and the L matter is
[55:56] worse with them than the
[55:59] beginning that sounds like people that
[56:01] knew God but were really tied up in the
[56:03] world events I mean in their job in
[56:05] their Walmart in their shopping in their
[56:08] 700 pairs of shoes or whatever they
[56:11] got it'll be different for each one of
[56:14] us that's amen and verse 21 for it had
[56:19] been better for them to not have known
[56:22] the way of
[56:24] righteousness that's pretty powerful
[56:27] then after they had known it to turn
[56:30] from the holy Commandments and delivered
[56:33] unto them been delivered unto them but
[56:35] it is happened unto them according to
[56:38] the true
[56:44] proverb that the people have turned to
[56:46] the vomit
[56:48] again and the s to the wallow in the mud
[56:52] the dog has turned to the vomit now that
[56:55] scripture is talking about
[56:58] Believers and you become a Believer and
[57:01] then you know you like a nice car and
[57:04] you
[57:06] like 20 pair of shoes or or whatever it
[57:10] is or you like 700
[57:13] movies and you're just consumed with the
[57:17] latest of whatever it
[57:20] is and you become merchandise you're
[57:23] selling your
[57:24] soul and that spirit is killing your
[57:28] spiritual life brother Brown said it
[57:31] will actually take your life get away
[57:34] from her amen and I want to show
[57:38] you uh exactly where we're going on this
[57:42] brother Brown said I wonder if we're
[57:44] I'll tell you ahead of time we're
[57:47] not we're not I'm not even you know we
[57:50] preached on worship and this is kind of
[57:52] the same way you know David was a man
[57:54] after God's Own Heart and there was too
[57:56] many prayers for me to write down I
[57:58] never even counted them too many prayers
[58:00] that David prayed in a in a worship song
[58:02] type of way you know we don't have to
[58:04] put God in a box prayer ain't just like
[58:08] you know standing in a corner or you
[58:10] know or kneeling or you know you can
[58:13] pray and sing you can pray and worship
[58:16] you can you can you can do all the kinds
[58:18] of things and that's why David was and
[58:21] and literally literally literally we've
[58:23] been doing some of them in Wednesday
[58:24] night and there was sheets of prayers in
[58:27] the Bible from the prophets but David
[58:30] had the most prayers and most of them
[58:32] were wrote from songs but you know you
[58:35] know and and so I got disclaimer this is
[58:38] not the case here I feel
[58:41] extremely love more than I would even
[58:44] remot remotely deserve from you people
[58:47] so I'm I'm preaching to
[58:49] myself but you know we don't ever want
[58:51] to get that we have to be
[58:54] good anybody can sing is
[58:57] special anybody can preach that's got
[58:59] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:02] amen uh anybody can lead son Sunday
[59:04] school that's got the baptism of The
[59:07] Ghost and got a heart for it you know
[59:09] what I
[59:11] mean Jesus preached on the hillside it's
[59:15] not about the steeple or it's not about
[59:17] the gold in this building and or you see
[59:19] what I mean it's not about those things
[59:21] he said I wonder if we're sufficiently
[59:24] impressed do you know we read the
[59:26] scripture last week he said David said
[59:28] or Peter said before they were going to
[59:30] kill Peter he said all I can do is bring
[59:32] the word of God into your
[59:36] remembrance but you know I wonder many
[59:38] times and and believe me the devil
[59:40] reminds me of this quite
[59:42] regularly uh said you know you preached
[59:46] that 10 years ago or you preached that
[59:48] or you know the people have heard that
[59:50] for 50 years I wonder if you're
[59:52] sufficiently impressed with God
[59:56] Jesus that's what the prophet said in
[59:59] the perous church age he said I wonder
[1:00:00] if we're sufficiently impressed with the
[1:00:03] word in our
[1:00:05] midst I wonder if it like we're like
[1:00:08] well there's no way Jesus Is God because
[1:00:10] I know his parents so I'm still looking
[1:00:14] to where the Jews
[1:00:16] are he said let me give
[1:00:19] you a thought here he said how do we
[1:00:23] pray he said we pray in jesus' name
[1:00:25] don't we
[1:00:26] he said every prayer in his name or is
[1:00:30] there or there isn't any answer yet in
[1:00:34] John 1 maybe you can pull that up Amy in
[1:00:38] John 5:14 he said we are
[1:00:41] told this is the confidence that we have
[1:00:44] in him that if you ask
[1:00:46] anything according to his will he will
[1:00:49] hear us and if we know that he hear us
[1:00:53] then whatsoever we ask we know that we
[1:00:56] have the
[1:00:58] petitions that we desire of
[1:01:02] him now we asked what is the will of God
[1:01:06] he said there's only one way to know the
[1:01:08] will of God and he said that's by the
[1:01:11] word of
[1:01:13] God Amen it don't matter how that word
[1:01:17] of God comes it's still the word of
[1:01:20] God
[1:01:22] Amen and we're because you know never
[1:01:26] before you know when I was a kid when
[1:01:28] you went into the
[1:01:29] Arenas the the the puck boards were
[1:01:33] white but we have so many distractions
[1:01:37] because everything is screaming By Me By
[1:01:40] Me by me you know and you go to the
[1:01:42] grocery store for milk but you'll leave
[1:01:44] with a package of cookies a pair of
[1:01:46] socks an
[1:01:47] iPad uh you know maybe a snorkeling tube
[1:01:50] maybe even a
[1:01:51] canoe because they have everything
[1:01:56] y that's right and then next month you
[1:01:58] get the Visa bill and you go
[1:02:05] golly Matthew 6:1 19-21 it says lay not
[1:02:08] up for yourself Treasures upon Earth
[1:02:12] where moth and rust th corrupt and where
[1:02:13] thieves do break through and steal but
[1:02:16] lay up for yourself Treasures in Heaven
[1:02:18] where neither moth or rusters corrupt
[1:02:20] and where thieves do not break through
[1:02:21] and steal for where your treasure is
[1:02:28] there's where your heart will be
[1:02:30] also amen and and you see like I know
[1:02:35] you've heard that longer than I've
[1:02:37] probably been
[1:02:38] alive some of
[1:02:40] you but it's still the truth and it it
[1:02:44] listen I we're not preaching about
[1:02:47] owning things that we need or you know
[1:02:50] we would freeze to death and and but
[1:02:52] we're just saying like our our thought
[1:02:55] pattern our our we merchandise whose
[1:02:57] merchandise are we are you God's
[1:03:00] merchandise or are you Hollywood's
[1:03:02] merchandise or are you Walmart's
[1:03:04] merchandise or you Amazon's
[1:03:08] merchandise that's a good question for
[1:03:10] us to ask this I want to mention on
[1:03:13] prayer and I want to read it from two
[1:03:16] two uh or three standpoints I want to
[1:03:19] say how much should we
[1:03:22] pray how should we pray
[1:03:30] and we'll get to the third
[1:03:32] one here I want to read three or four
[1:03:35] quotes where brother Brown talks about
[1:03:37] how much should we pray friends you may
[1:03:39] laugh too much you may talk too much and
[1:03:41] you may walk too much but you'll never
[1:03:45] pray too much I would that men would
[1:03:48] pray everywhere lifting up holy hands
[1:03:51] another one he says with your prayers I
[1:03:53] sure I'm sure that we'll do our best
[1:03:57] that we can for the glory of God and
[1:03:59] Prayer Changes Things prayer changes
[1:04:02] death to life prayer changes sickness to
[1:04:05] health prayer it changes a sinner to a
[1:04:08] saint it's prayer he said if you laugh
[1:04:10] too much you may sh too
[1:04:13] much and you may eat too much but you'll
[1:04:16] never ever pray too
[1:04:20] much but the Bible says I would that you
[1:04:22] men would pray
[1:04:24] everywhere lifting up holy hands so he
[1:04:27] said you will never ever pray too
[1:04:32] much here's another one he says he said
[1:04:34] you might eat too much you might drink
[1:04:36] too much this is a 65 quote 65
[1:04:40] 218 you might drink too much you might
[1:04:43] laugh too much and you might walk too
[1:04:44] much so he's not even talk promoting
[1:04:47] exercise but you'll never pray too much
[1:04:52] I would that man would pray
[1:04:54] everywhere and so we're going to look
[1:04:56] into some scriptures and say
[1:04:58] well how much should we
[1:05:01] pray how much is enough prayer you know
[1:05:04] you can be in a a meditation of prayer
[1:05:07] and you know prayer ain't about just I
[1:05:09] mean it's wonderful to be gathered in
[1:05:11] church but your whole B your whole life
[1:05:13] can be prayer you know when you you know
[1:05:16] brother Bart sends me videos all the
[1:05:18] time he's driving he's got music playing
[1:05:20] prayer praying preaching praying and
[1:05:22] that your whole thought pattern is
[1:05:24] around God
[1:05:26] God Amen but the World's

[1:07:17] lot of time alone so he can spend it

[1:07:22] message he can read his Bible but he
[1:07:23] could even pray because you you're in
[1:07:26] you have that
[1:07:28] ability amen what do you listen to when
[1:07:31] you're going down the road what's your
[1:07:32] train of thought do you ever pray for

[1:07:56] living well that's a long
[1:08:00] verse pray without
[1:08:04] ceasing
[1:08:09] Jesus Luke 18
[1:08:12] 1-5 you
[1:08:15] know if somebody don't pray
[1:08:19] enough brother Brown's going to answer
[1:08:21] that but it's because it's we're geared
[1:08:23] to Hollywood
[1:08:25] there's no flashing
[1:08:27] lights there's no whistles there's no
[1:08:32] train there's no excitement you know
[1:08:35] what do they call those movies that are
[1:08:37] like uh you know action-packed what's
[1:08:39] the action in prayer if I come to the
[1:08:42] church and I'm here all alone and I sit
[1:08:44] here for an hour and walk around and
[1:08:45] pray for one
[1:08:47] hour there's no
[1:08:49] Hoopa unless it's me
[1:08:53] hooping myself I'm not here here for
[1:08:55] nothing
[1:08:58] else here in Luke 181 and we're going to
[1:09:01] read 1: 5 and then 7 to8 maybe I'll tell
[1:09:04] you when we jump and he spake in
[1:09:06] Parables unto them to this end the man
[1:09:09] ought
[1:09:11] always to
[1:09:14] pray always but God I got two
[1:09:19] jobs God my taxes are due the end of
[1:09:23] April but God I got 15 kids
[1:09:34] or verse two saying there was a
[1:09:38] city there was in a city a judge which
[1:09:42] feared not God neither regarded men and
[1:09:44] there was a widow in the city and she
[1:09:46] came unto him saying avenge me my
[1:09:49] adversaries and he would not for a while
[1:09:52] but afterwards he said within himself no
[1:09:56] here's Jesus given a parable and he's
[1:09:58] not just giving
[1:10:00] chatter but we don't believe this
[1:10:03] brother Dale don't I I I want to think I
[1:10:05] do but and I I try to but do we by our
[1:10:11] actions do we and here's Jesus showing
[1:10:14] us something he
[1:10:17] said but afterwards he said unto himself
[1:10:20] this King he said though I fear not God
[1:10:26] nor do I regard this woman at all I
[1:10:30] could care less about her she's
[1:10:32] bothering
[1:10:34] me yet because this Widow keeps coming
[1:10:38] to
[1:10:39] me she's making merchandise of
[1:10:43] me she's taking up my
[1:10:47] time I will avenge her lest by her
[1:10:51] continual
[1:10:53] coming she w bear me
[1:10:57] out now this is a guy that could care
[1:11:00] less about the woman and could care L
[1:11:03] about
[1:11:05] God he's just flat out
[1:11:08] selfish and he's selfishly thinking in
[1:11:11] his mind she's using up my
[1:11:15] time then we have a
[1:11:18] god let's jump to seven and
[1:11:22] so not God avenge his own lacked
[1:11:27] uh-oh which cry day and night unto him
[1:11:30] though he bear alone with them I tell
[1:11:34] you that he will avenge them speedily
[1:11:37] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:11:40] shall he find
[1:11:41] Faith so he still find us
[1:11:45] praying what God's saying is if you come
[1:11:49] and you bring your petitions you know
[1:11:51] the Bible and we're going to go into
[1:11:52] that you know God's changed his mind
[1:11:54] because of Prayer
[1:11:57] amen God God is we're connected if
[1:12:02] you're part of the family of God you
[1:12:05] know you if anyone's a father here have
[1:12:08] you ever changed your mind because of
[1:12:09] the kids you knew they shouldn't have
[1:12:10] the ice cream but when you know when
[1:12:13] brother Dale said they should get it you
[1:12:16] know I'm I'm just you know what I mean
[1:12:19] you know like I know there's a better
[1:12:21] way but oh just this one time all right
[1:12:28] you don't think God thinks like
[1:12:30] that he does cuz he we we have examples
[1:12:34] of this but he's saying what when when
[1:12:37] you're his elect that means you're
[1:12:39] connected you're a part of him so you're
[1:12:42] you're his right arm and you're telling
[1:12:46] God the body saying I want a
[1:12:48] wave but the body says no no don't wave
[1:12:50] at them we don't like them but the hand
[1:12:52] says I want to wave
[1:12:53] anyway and the okay
[1:12:58] wave what are we his
[1:13:01] elect amen yes for sure we
[1:13:08] are
[1:13:15] Hallelujah God will be
[1:13:17] touched there there's a purpose in
[1:13:20] prayer a strong purpose in prayer but
[1:13:23] because of the the the the environment
[1:13:26] that we've raised up in you know when
[1:13:29] when when me and brother G were born it
[1:13:31] was a lot Tamer than it is now you know
[1:13:34] we still had the rotary phones and no
[1:13:37] cell phones internet what's that
[1:13:40] computer it's as big as this Pulpit I
[1:13:43] remember the first one came in the
[1:13:44] library it was about
[1:13:47] this
[1:13:48] typing if you took eging in high school
[1:13:51] when I was going through everybody
[1:13:53] looked at you like
[1:13:56] now everybody
[1:13:58] tapes if you took taping in high school
[1:14:00] you were going to be somebody's
[1:14:01] secretary and I was going to be a part
[1:14:03] of that
[1:14:06] operation
[1:14:10] amen look
[1:14:13] in chronicon Corinth how do I say that
[1:14:17] Chronicles 4 two
[1:14:25] says continue in prayer we can go to the
[1:14:28] next one the same
[1:14:32] book in Chronicles
[1:14:37] 1:9 I might be saying that
[1:14:40] wrong cuz I'm
[1:14:42] c o o SS i a n claan sorry
[1:14:50] Colossians 4:2 says continue in prayer
[1:14:52] Colossians 1:9 says for this cause we
[1:14:55] also since a day we
[1:14:58] heard don't cease to
[1:15:01] pray for you to the desire that ye might
[1:15:05] be filled with the knowledge and the
[1:15:07] will of all wisdom and
[1:15:12] understanding wow now we get to where
[1:15:15] should we
[1:15:16] pray and how let's go to Matthew 6
[1:15:21] Matthew 65-13 and and God Jesus himself
[1:15:25] God himself is going to show us how and
[1:15:28] where to
[1:15:29] pray Matthew 6 starting verse 5 he said
[1:15:32] when thou prayest Thou shalt not be like
[1:15:34] the Hypocrites are for they love the
[1:15:37] Hollywood they love to pray standing in
[1:15:40] the synagogue and in the corners of the
[1:15:42] streets that they may be seen am men but
[1:15:44] verily I say unto you that they have
[1:15:46] their reward verse six but thou when
[1:15:49] thou prayest enter into the closet and
[1:15:51] when thou H has shut the door pray to
[1:15:53] thy father which is in secret and thy
[1:15:56] father which seeth in secret shall
[1:15:58] reward thee openly but when y
[1:16:03] pray you don't have to know all the
[1:16:10] words but when you pray use not vain
[1:16:14] repetition as the heathens do for they
[1:16:17] think because they're heard by their
[1:16:19] much
[1:16:20] speaking verse eight but be not ye
[1:16:25] therefore like them for your father now
[1:16:28] see now we're
[1:16:29] connected to your
[1:16:32] daddy your daddy knoweth what things you
[1:16:35] have need of therefore you ask him
[1:16:38] before you ask
[1:16:40] him but he still likes you to ask
[1:16:43] him after this manner therefore you
[1:16:47] pray Our
[1:16:49] Father which art in
[1:16:51] heaven Hallowed be thy name
[1:16:55] verse 10 thy kingdom come and thy will
[1:16:59] be done on Earth as it is in
[1:17:02] heaven and give us this day our daily
[1:17:04] bread and forgive us our debtors as we
[1:17:08] forgive our debtors and lead us not into
[1:17:11] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[1:17:14] thine is the kingdom and the power and
[1:17:18] the glory you notice that prayer was all
[1:17:21] about God it was his kingdom he was the
[1:17:26] father it was about his glory glory it
[1:17:29] was about his
[1:17:31] will and his kingdom
[1:17:34] coming and you see here that is when
[1:17:38] God's teaching us how to pray that if
[1:17:40] you're a
[1:17:43] Believer and and these things aren't
[1:17:47] happening we need to check our life and
[1:17:52] we need to see who we've sold out for
[1:17:55] and who are merchandise is
[1:17:59] amen and if the Bible says that things
[1:18:02] will happen when you
[1:18:04] pray and these things don't
[1:18:08] happen what could be the reason it's we
[1:18:11] know it's not that God's a
[1:18:13] liar we know that it wasn't a short fall
[1:18:16] of
[1:18:17] God it has to be within
[1:18:21] ourselves cuz we know God's word can't
[1:18:23] lie and we know God can't like so he
[1:18:25] said what's
[1:18:26] wrong and I'm glad you
[1:18:30] asked cuz our Prophet told us what it
[1:18:34] was and I I'll tell you where we're at
[1:18:37] in this after but in this uh quote well
[1:18:40] here I can tell you it was Abraham and
[1:18:43] his seed after him it's a
[1:18:45] 614th month quote he said all the
[1:18:48] ministers today he said we're having
[1:18:50] such a hard time to get the people out
[1:18:54] to prayer meeting on Wednesday night
[1:18:57] they love their television
[1:18:59] programs and they love their watches
[1:19:05] amusements now now I I I'm going to stop
[1:19:08] here again again like I know that we
[1:19:10] have a unique situation in our church
[1:19:13] some of you are driving away some of you
[1:19:15] live farther away than we ever deserve
[1:19:18] for you to ever come and we work in
[1:19:20] shift work we're not throwing the eggs
[1:19:23] at that amen we're just looking at this
[1:19:26] Spirit they love their amusements Sunday
[1:19:30] they don't want to come to church on
[1:19:31] Sunday many of them they tell me the
[1:19:34] ministers tell me that the church's pews
[1:19:37] are empty and emptying out because the
[1:19:41] people are beginning to go and the world
[1:19:43] offers so much glass and so much fancy
[1:19:48] and so much T tenso that the things of
[1:19:51] the world that the
[1:19:53] people are falling for
[1:19:56] it and I'm not saying that we are
[1:19:59] falling for it but we're affected by
[1:20:02] it because the world and everything is
[1:20:05] making merchandise you know if they were
[1:20:07] going to build a store if they were
[1:20:08] going to put a Tim Hortons in Wyoming or
[1:20:10] or a Walmart in Wyoming they would see
[1:20:12] how many people are here and they would
[1:20:15] calculate the merchandise of the people
[1:20:17] living here that are going to become
[1:20:19] property to
[1:20:22] them uh-huh
[1:20:25] they don't build Walmarts in the
[1:20:28] desert
[1:20:32] amen not there's nothing wrong with
[1:20:34] going to Walmart but are we selling our
[1:20:38] soul for these fancy things he let's
[1:20:41] continue here he said now the shows that
[1:20:44] are at now that shows that at the
[1:20:47] beginning he's talking about these
[1:20:49] people that are affected by the world
[1:20:50] fancy let let's go back and just the
[1:20:53] tinel of the world and and the people
[1:20:55] are falling out and the fancy and the
[1:20:57] class and they they offer a better class
[1:20:59] the world the pews are emptying out even
[1:21:01] on
[1:21:02] Sunday he said now that
[1:21:05] shows that at the
[1:21:07] beginning they had nothing to start
[1:21:11] with now that would be really hard on
[1:21:13] the tape Library
[1:21:15] church because the very same Prophet
[1:21:17] said they never had nothing to begin
[1:21:19] with for if you love God you couldn't I
[1:21:24] couldn't you couldn't wire you away from
[1:21:29] church he said they couldn't chain you
[1:21:32] away from coming to church he said they
[1:21:35] couldn't hide a Believer from
[1:21:39] God now if he's in your heart and you're
[1:21:43] part of the family oh you might be all
[1:21:46] deceived now there's many people that
[1:21:49] actually think that they're all right
[1:21:51] now we're living in a world like that
[1:21:53] you know you know
[1:21:55] this is definitely is not affected to us
[1:21:57] but you know we just came past Easter
[1:22:00] and I I see things and I'm connected you
[1:22:04] know just like you do and there was a
[1:22:06] very Evangelical Church that on the
[1:22:09] Sunday before Easter they had the front
[1:22:12] all decorated with palm trees and bunny
[1:22:14] rabbits that have colored eggs and the
[1:22:17] pop was the pulpit was completely
[1:22:18] covered up this is Sunday morning and
[1:22:21] they had the kids come up to get a dra
[1:22:23] lie the bunnies don't have eggs that are
[1:22:25] colored blue and yellow and then they
[1:22:28] left the sanctuary this is evangelical
[1:22:31] church and they went out in the yard and
[1:22:35] helped the kids find the
[1:22:37] magic of a
[1:22:39] bunny that has an egg that's
[1:22:47] colored the Bible says there will be no
[1:22:49] Liars in
[1:22:50] heaven there won't be those kind of
[1:22:52] liars that's for sure
[1:22:56] how in the world did this
[1:22:58] happen what in the world does that have
[1:23:01] to do with the Sunday morning church
[1:23:03] service that ain't us
[1:23:06] now but the Bible says if God would
[1:23:09] carry will I even find faith on the
[1:23:12] earth these places that are doing it
[1:23:15] they would have never believed on it 25
[1:23:18] years ago not even close a million miles
[1:23:21] from some of those same places people
[1:23:23] run the aisles when they got blessed
[1:23:25] under the real anointing of
[1:23:29] God
[1:23:30] Amen so it would do us to be cautious
[1:23:35] amen hallelujah let's watch here where
[1:23:38] he
[1:23:40] goes amen and there's many people that
[1:23:43] actually believe think that they're all
[1:23:45] right but if you don't stop and watch
[1:23:48] your life you'll see that the spirit of
[1:23:52] God isn't there
[1:23:56] you know it affected me when Peter
[1:23:58] Chandler
[1:23:59] died I know I'm not like
[1:24:02] him everybody that's around me are they
[1:24:05] more important than
[1:24:12] me
[1:24:14] wow see see how God's spirit can be so
[1:24:18] Dynamic you know when we were just there
[1:24:21] I'll show you something this is a man
[1:24:22] that's preached for like over 50 years
[1:24:25] when he we went to a pastor's only
[1:24:28] dinner in in cubec somewhere we're in
[1:24:31] Ottawa and he comes by me now I'm the
[1:24:34] kid I'm the new kid he's a pillar he
[1:24:39] comes by me he says brother Dell pray
[1:24:42] for me he said I'm preaching
[1:24:48] tonight would I have done that to him
[1:24:57] or was I just had the ability to
[1:25:00] preach you see the
[1:25:04] spirit
[1:25:07] wow
[1:25:11] wow God God help me forget about you God
[1:25:14] helped me God saved
[1:25:19] me if there if it doesn't cope with the
[1:25:23] Bible then there's something wrong with
[1:25:25] the experience that's in you have so you
[1:25:28] must come back and line up with the word
[1:25:30] of God and see if your life lines up
[1:25:32] with God now just one more paragraph 56
[1:25:34] and he said if you love the world more
[1:25:37] than you love prayer
[1:25:39] meaning if you'd rather watch the
[1:25:41] television program than pray there's
[1:25:44] something wrong with you he said if
[1:25:46] you'd rather take a Sunday afternoon and
[1:25:49] D ride instead of go to church there's
[1:25:51] something wrong with you because your
[1:25:54] heart is where your heart is because
[1:25:56] where your heart is there's where your
[1:25:58] treasure will be
[1:26:00] also said the Lord Jesus and your heart
[1:26:03] is built into it see you if you're part
[1:26:07] of God you're you're built to
[1:26:10] communicate with God I don't care if
[1:26:12] you're in the barn and you pray it's not
[1:26:15] about prayer ain't the qualifications of
[1:26:18] prayer ain't closing your eyes the
[1:26:21] qualifications of prayer ain't kneeling
[1:26:23] down amen and you can to have a humble
[1:26:25] Spirit you can bow on the prayer the
[1:26:26] qualification of prayers could be
[1:26:27] driving the big maic wide open with your
[1:26:29] eyes paying attention to all the idiots
[1:26:31] on the road but you can still be
[1:26:34] praying
[1:26:36] amen the qualifications of praying ain't
[1:26:39] talking all the time you got to let the
[1:26:41] other person on the other end of the
[1:26:43] line talk once in a
[1:26:48] while he said if your heart ain't built
[1:26:51] into it you're a part of it
[1:26:57] you're you've become a part of Christ
[1:26:59] because you're built into the structure
[1:27:01] of Christ because you're the bride of
[1:27:03] Christ if you love him that's if you
[1:27:06] love come to prayer then you're you're
[1:27:08] connected you're you're just right into
[1:27:10] it because you you is
[1:27:15] it
[1:27:17] amen God help
[1:27:21] us amen
[1:27:27] amen okay so we we looked into how often
[1:27:31] should we
[1:27:32] pray and how and where should we
[1:27:36] pray but the last thing I want to look
[1:27:38] at is are we
[1:27:41] Believers when we pray John 1413 and 14
[1:27:46] and we're going to close on these verses
[1:27:48] here this is a powerful thought we might
[1:27:51] have a a quote in here but a powerful
[1:27:54] thought here and whatsoever you ask in
[1:27:57] my name that I'll do now that's that's
[1:28:03] straightforward
[1:28:05] so it if if you ever pray and it's not
[1:28:10] answered there's a
[1:28:13] problem and the problem ain't
[1:28:16] God you know the Bible says if your
[1:28:18] heart condemns you
[1:28:20] not is everything right you know God has
[1:28:23] the prophet said this said if if your
[1:28:25] heart condemns you he said God has no
[1:28:27] obligation he's no connection to you at
[1:28:32] all so whatsoever you ask in my name
[1:28:34] that will I do that the father may be
[1:28:37] glorified in the son and if you ask
[1:28:39] anything in my name now he repeats
[1:28:42] it why would he repeat
[1:28:45] it why would Jesus Christ repeat himself
[1:28:48] the very next line
[1:28:54] he don't actually say it's got to be a
[1:28:56] big name preacher he just says if you
[1:28:59] pray it's finished boom let's move on
[1:29:01] what's the next
[1:29:03] object Mark 11
[1:29:06] 24 actually let's go to 23 Mark uh
[1:29:11] 23 I didn't put that scripture down so I
[1:29:13] got to wait for you Mark
[1:29:17] 11:23 for verily I say unto you that
[1:29:19] whosoever shall say to this mountain
[1:29:22] that you be now this is Jesus in the
[1:29:24] Bible this this ain't the prophets this
[1:29:26] is actually the the Son of God say this
[1:29:30] mountain that thou shalt be removed and
[1:29:31] cast into the SE and thou shalt not
[1:29:33] doubt in thy heart but shall believe
[1:29:35] that these things which thou sayest
[1:29:37] shall come to pass he shall have
[1:29:39] whatsoever he
[1:29:42] sa
[1:29:45] wow that's that's pretty heavy duty if
[1:29:47] you really think about that let's go to
[1:29:49] verse 24 for
[1:29:51] therefore I say unto you what things
[1:29:55] whosoever you
[1:29:58] desire When you pray and you
[1:30:03] believe you already have
[1:30:05] them and you shall have them do we are
[1:30:08] we believers do we actually believe that
[1:30:11] you know I'm give you an example of the
[1:30:12] Believers in the Bible Peter was in jail
[1:30:16] and there was a whole bunch of message
[1:30:17] Believers in their house they prayed for
[1:30:19] Peter God answered their prayer just
[1:30:22] exactly like this scripture Peter just
[1:30:23] walked up this is before the baptism of
[1:30:25] the Holy Ghost had come and this was
[1:30:26] before the perfect sacrifice had come
[1:30:28] they were still killing lambs and goats
[1:30:30] just covering up the sin the sin that
[1:30:31] the desire of sin hadn't even been taken
[1:30:33] away yet so like my goodness imagine
[1:30:35] what we could do and Peter came and he
[1:30:38] knocked on the door and they sent a
[1:30:41] little girl they sent Leah to go answer
[1:30:43] the door and Leah come back and
[1:30:47] said he's
[1:30:50] there what I want you to watch the
[1:30:52] scripture the Bible says they sent
[1:30:54] little
[1:30:55] girl and she said God answered the
[1:30:58] prayer he's there and the Holy Ghost
[1:31:01] filled Believers the the mature
[1:31:05] Believers the seasoned Believers the
[1:31:07] Holy Ghost hadn't been given yet but you
[1:31:09] know what I'm saying the seasoned
[1:31:11] Believers looked at the childlike
[1:31:14] faith and said you've seen a
[1:31:18] ghost I want to just ask you something
[1:31:20] is see spirits don't die so we're
[1:31:22] exactly the same today would have it
[1:31:24] been easier for that girl to see the
[1:31:26] actual Peter or to actually see a ghost
[1:31:29] who would have made the
[1:31:31] ghost see they believe that God could
[1:31:33] have made a ghost of Peter but they
[1:31:35] didn't believe God could take Peter out
[1:31:37] of the jail that's a new kind of a
[1:31:44] religion which one of you can think
[1:31:46] about your ghost and make a ghost and
[1:31:48] stand at the
[1:31:50] door so they believe that God there's no
[1:31:53] way God's going to do what we want
[1:31:54] because that's that's just not even a
[1:31:56] possibility but got to do something else
[1:31:58] so you seen the
[1:32:01] ghost yeah we we're the same way we're
[1:32:05] the exactly the same way if we're not
[1:32:09] careful
[1:32:11] wow wow amen God help
[1:32:17] us they're already yours see if you're
[1:32:20] connected only you and God know if
[1:32:23] you're connected only you and God know
[1:32:26] if you came from God Only You you only
[1:32:29] know brother Brown said when we pray it
[1:32:31] softens our spirit it changes us we're
[1:32:34] not the same anymore you can't go into
[1:32:37] prayer and walk out and be the same
[1:32:39] person you never see a hard person walk
[1:32:42] out of a prayer thing and it's not about
[1:32:45] show you know the Bible talked about
[1:32:47] fast and if you were going to fast don't
[1:32:49] tell me about it don't tell me you so
[1:32:51] wash your face
[1:32:55] it's not about a competition oh bless
[1:32:57] God I I pray three and a half no no just
[1:33:00] 35 I come and I wanted to pray an hour
[1:33:02] but I quit early I was
[1:33:04] tired who am I telling this
[1:33:09] to why am I telling
[1:33:13] this amen Luke 119-13
[1:33:23] God help us God help us to we we we
[1:33:27] we're going home and we have to
[1:33:28] recognize Our God you know you know I
[1:33:31] mentioned to you about and I did
[1:33:33] something that was unbelievable you know
[1:33:35] I'm not just preaching I'm living it you
[1:33:38] will your life will change you you know
[1:33:40] we you know I mentioned to some of you
[1:33:43] we we considered we called a couple
[1:33:44] people about selling a
[1:33:47] farm and and I told L man I said I felt
[1:33:49] like God give me a flat
[1:33:51] no flat no just
[1:33:55] but I didn't like the answer cuz I
[1:33:57] already had it in my mind I had the
[1:33:58] money I already
[1:34:01] spent I'm just being I'm trying to help
[1:34:03] you so I called the real estate agent I
[1:34:06] said this is what I want she said you'll
[1:34:09] never get it God had already told me
[1:34:15] that I know you just don't do that
[1:34:18] that's just me I'm still praying
[1:34:22] through God has another way so then he
[1:34:26] takes cows that you pay $1,500 for and
[1:34:28] sells them for
[1:34:30] $4,500 because he knew that all along
[1:34:33] but I didn't believe him it was a
[1:34:38] ghost I seen a

[1:35:45] a
[1:35:47] scorpion if ye then being evil
[1:35:54] now how to give good gifts unto your
[1:35:57] children how much more does your
[1:35:59] heavenly
[1:36:04] father give the Holy Spirit to them that
[1:36:07] ask
[1:36:09] him it's not hard for
[1:36:12] him but do we
[1:36:15] believe not hard at all here in Matthew
[1:36:18] 21:22 and we see in the scriptures
[1:36:20] before this maybe we'll read it we got
[1:36:23] time let's go to verse 20 Matthew
[1:36:27] 2120 I didn't put two of these verses
[1:36:29] down I just I'm kind of pulling it out
[1:36:31] of context to go in prayer but here here
[1:36:34] are the disciples
[1:36:37] where Jesus is is teaching them to pray
[1:36:41] that's what Jesus is doing us today but
[1:36:43] they're not getting
[1:36:45] it they're walking with the Lord
[1:36:49] Jesus and when the disciples saw they
[1:36:52] marbled because oh golly I mean I read
[1:36:56] the Bible I mean I went to a message
[1:36:57] church for
[1:36:59] years but I wondered where God
[1:37:03] was I don't see nothing now watch this
[1:37:07] the disciples were right with
[1:37:10] Jesus how could they live with Jesus
[1:37:12] they slept with
[1:37:15] Jesus but they marbled marveled wherever
[1:37:19] Jesus was there was always
[1:37:21] miracles there was always noise and
[1:37:23] miracle Les so what were they marveling
[1:37:25] about they seen more than we'll ever
[1:37:29] see the disciples Marvel saying how soon
[1:37:32] did the Fig Tree wither
[1:37:34] away and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:37:36] them very very I say unto you if you
[1:37:38] have faith and don't not you shall not
[1:37:39] only do this but do this which is done
[1:37:44] to the Fig Tree but also if you shall
[1:37:46] say to this mountain be removed and cast
[1:37:48] into the sea thou sh it shall be done
[1:37:50] now watch the next verse here
[1:37:54] the disciples marveled I want you to I
[1:37:56] want you to get that in your head like
[1:37:59] how could you do it
[1:38:03] God Jesus said all things whatsoever you
[1:38:07] ask in
[1:38:10] prayer we pray but we don't expect
[1:38:15] it brother Dale don't many times do we
[1:38:19] really think it's just it's just
[1:38:21] done if he ask and pray are
[1:38:24] believing you shall receive it amen Mark
[1:38:29] 11:21 let's moving faster here we got to
[1:38:32] we got to move
[1:38:35] on Mark 11:21 and Peter calling into
[1:38:39] remembrance the same scripture about the
[1:38:41] Fig Tree which was car and it withered
[1:38:44] away and Jesus answered and said unto
[1:38:48] him have faith in God verily I say unto
[1:38:51] you that whosoever shall say to this
[1:38:52] mountain be remember moved and cast into
[1:38:54] the sea and shall doubt not in his heart
[1:38:57] but Shall Believe these things which
[1:38:59] shall come to pass whatever so he
[1:39:02] saith therefore I say unto you that
[1:39:04] whatsoever things you
[1:39:07] desire wow I desire a couple things like
[1:39:11] deci side the
[1:39:13] church and you
[1:39:18] pray When you pray believe that you
[1:39:21] receive them
[1:39:23] yeah yeah that's
[1:39:26] right that's
[1:39:28] right I wonder if God like the church
[1:39:31] sided you know I'm not trying to make
[1:39:33] this a joke this is the Bible it's very
[1:39:36] simple it's it's we're stretching our
[1:39:39] faith how big is your God Amen let's
[1:39:43] look at some quotes where the Prophet
[1:39:44] talks about this he said so there
[1:39:47] therefore that's the reason said the
[1:39:48] prayer of the faith shall save the sick
[1:39:51] and an individual's prayer the effectual
[1:39:53] fervent prayer of a righteous male man
[1:39:56] availeth
[1:39:58] much oh if you only knew that in your
[1:40:01] hand Christ gave you the authority with
[1:40:04] his name by being a Christian the most
[1:40:08] powerful weapon that the world has ever
[1:40:14] known
[1:40:16] prayer and if even it even changes
[1:40:19] everything it'll change the mind of God
[1:40:23] and I it did
[1:40:25] it it did do it after the death was
[1:40:29] pronounced to a man and he prayed and
[1:40:32] God's Prophet had to go
[1:40:34] back amen we're going to read that
[1:40:36] scripture in
[1:40:38] Isaiah here another quote he said now I
[1:40:40] appreciate your prayers Prayer Changes
[1:40:43] Things and there's only one thing that
[1:40:45] can change the mind of God and that's
[1:40:48] prayer you know I want to throw
[1:40:50] something out to you sometime and I
[1:40:52] won't do it unless God tells me to but
[1:40:55] I've had the thought go through my head
[1:40:57] I said you know we've had a lot more
[1:40:58] people coming on Wednesday night I've
[1:41:00] been preaching on Wednesday night so one
[1:41:02] of these Sunday mornings would we have a
[1:41:03] full house I'm not going to
[1:41:06] preach we're just going to all
[1:41:10] pray I bet you a lot of you would be
[1:41:15] shocked he never said we got these
[1:41:18] things by
[1:41:21] preaching you never said we got all
[1:41:23] these things by
[1:41:25] preaching you can actually preach too
[1:41:27] much he said that in church order and
[1:41:30] Doctrine 25 to 35 minutes shut her
[1:41:35] down a lot of people should read that
[1:41:38] quote amen you know what I'm saying you
[1:41:41] know when I was a kid when I was a kid
[1:41:44] and we never had the light of the age
[1:41:46] that we have now you know we never had a
[1:41:49] prophet when I was a kid it wasn't
[1:41:51] recognized to me
[1:41:54] yeah and we'd come to church and
[1:41:57] everybody on that side and everybody on
[1:41:59] that side we sech front and one person
[1:42:01] on each side would pray out loud and
[1:42:04] when they stopped the person beside them
[1:42:05] was next they started praying and next
[1:42:08] and next and next and next and next till
[1:42:11] the very end the pastor prayed when we
[1:42:13] went
[1:42:15] home oh bless God oh we got to have we
[1:42:18] got to have a well-known preacher we got
[1:42:20] to
[1:42:21] have I never read that
[1:42:24] scripture I never read it
[1:42:26] anywhere I never read where he had to
[1:42:28] have a turnaround collar and a big
[1:42:30] education and be a dynamic
[1:42:33] speaker said pray just pray oh bless God
[1:42:38] we're going to let the preacher pray I
[1:42:40] have more faith in these kids praying
[1:42:41] than I probably have in my own
[1:42:45] prayer you don't think so when God never
[1:42:47] when our shed was on fire but the fire
[1:42:49] wouldn't burn in the shed it was Silas
[1:42:51] that prayed with Patricia in the car
[1:42:56] fire they don't burn I don't have to
[1:42:57] read the Bible about the the testimonies
[1:42:59] in their Bible I can read my own
[1:43:01] Bible the shed's on fire but the shed
[1:43:03] don't burn nothing's lost and there's no
[1:43:06] claim and there's no even
[1:43:08] repair bless God and there was no big
[1:43:11] preacher that
[1:43:13] preached and there was no big preacher
[1:43:15] that
[1:43:16] prayed but Silas and Patricia in the car
[1:43:20] I wasn't praying I was going like a
[1:43:21] maniac
[1:43:25] huh oh bless God that's not the format
[1:43:27] we're
[1:43:30] thinking maybe we missed the
[1:43:34] format what what what did we read the
[1:43:36] quote he said we're expecting something
[1:43:38] on the
[1:43:41] platform like a good operation on the
[1:43:43] platform bless God we're going to vote
[1:43:45] this pastor out we got one that's a lot
[1:43:47] more flang
[1:43:51] bant you don't think think that
[1:43:55] happens that's why the prophet talked
[1:43:57] about
[1:43:57] it
[1:43:59] amen God help
[1:44:03] us
[1:44:07] hallelujah I don't know where he stopped
[1:44:09] here there's only one thing that changed
[1:44:11] the heart of God was
[1:44:16] prayer and that's a pretty good bit to
[1:44:20] me isn't it that's the truth he said
[1:44:22] prayer changed is everything he said you
[1:44:24] know prayer can't change he said you
[1:44:27] know prayer can change the mind of God
[1:44:29] these are all different quotes multiple
[1:44:31] zillions of quotes I only took the
[1:44:33] simple
[1:44:34] ones showed simple prayer is the most
[1:44:37] powerful weapon other quote he talks
[1:44:38] about
[1:44:39] this they can that's put in the control
[1:44:43] of a human
[1:44:45] being there's more atomic bombs and more
[1:44:49] hydrogen
[1:44:51] bombs and none of them are as powerful
[1:44:53] as prayer he said prayer will change the
[1:44:56] mind of God did you know that it did
[1:45:01] so Isaiah 38 Amy you know some of us and
[1:45:07] I I don't want to know but you you go
[1:45:09] home and you ask God I'll I'll guarantee
[1:45:12] you that some of us I hope not but I'll
[1:45:15] guarantee you there's some of us here
[1:45:16] today that actually sit in a week
[1:45:20] service and listen to more preaching
[1:45:23] then they do praying the whole
[1:45:25] week you listen to two hours of
[1:45:27] preaching and I'll bet you there's
[1:45:29] people sitting here that don't pray two
[1:45:31] hours all week you listen to an hour and
[1:45:34] a half of me talk and a half an hour on
[1:45:36] Wednesday but you don't pray two
[1:45:38] hours because that would be like you
[1:45:41] have to pray like 20 minutes a day 15
[1:45:43] minutes a day you don't pray any on
[1:45:45] Sunday because you're getting up to go
[1:45:46] to church like you don't have to pray
[1:45:47] that day because everybody at church is
[1:45:48] going to pray for
[1:45:51] you I I wonder
[1:45:54] hey I don't pray Sunday morning unless
[1:45:57] it's like God help me strength me I mean
[1:45:59] you know what I mean like pray I mean
[1:46:00] other than pray for the
[1:46:02] service cuz I'm coming to the
[1:46:08] service the world's trying to make
[1:46:11] merchandise of you property buy my movie
[1:46:15] buy my high heel
[1:46:16] shoes let's go to the and none of these
[1:46:19] things well some of them let's go to the
[1:46:21] gym buy a ticket for the gym when you
[1:46:23] could come and work for brother Dale
[1:46:25] just Square Bal it'd be free but see
[1:46:27] they make merchandise the Gym's fancy
[1:46:31] you can stretch and and do sit-ups at
[1:46:33] home for free but no we're going to pay
[1:46:35] for it we're going to pay and go to a
[1:46:37] place where there's bare naked people
[1:46:39] when you can do chin up put your feet
[1:46:40] under the couch and have somebody sit on
[1:46:43] the couch and knock yourself out jump on
[1:46:46] the floor and do a 100 push-ups like
[1:46:48] they do in the Army you don't have to
[1:46:50] pay anybody to do push-ups
[1:46:56] yeah go to Walmart you need mil you come
[1:46:59] over there with a Zony TV or something
[1:47:03] because like it was 50% off I would have
[1:47:05] been crazy not to buy
[1:47:07] it
[1:47:09] merchandise Jared was looking at
[1:47:11] Machinery the other day we deal with
[1:47:13] this all the time I'm getting gray hairs
[1:47:15] for a reason he was looking at Machinery
[1:47:17] he said Dad it's it's free it's it's
[1:47:19] almost free I said Jared we have more
[1:47:21] Machinery than we have land
[1:47:23] if they give it to you what would you do
[1:47:25] with
[1:47:27] it but but it's free it don't M free
[1:47:31] it's going to rest it's going to sit and
[1:47:33] Sh and rest you don't have nothing to do
[1:47:35] with it but see how we think it's a
[1:47:39] lie of the
[1:47:42] devil and we're just spinning our wheels
[1:47:45] and God's up there crying because he put
[1:47:48] it all right
[1:47:49] here watch this Isaiah 381
[1:47:53] how do you say this guy's name honey
[1:47:55] who's it Hezekiah and in the days of
[1:47:58] Hezekiah he was sick unto death and the
[1:48:01] uh Isaiah the prophet went to him and
[1:48:05] saith thus sayith the Lord that he had
[1:48:08] the spoken word you know brother Braham
[1:48:11] said this he said when God tells me
[1:48:13] something I say thus sayith the Lord
[1:48:14] that that's that's the word of God
[1:48:17] that's the Bible that's what the prophet
[1:48:19] said here like that I mean if if a if
[1:48:22] somebody came to me and say thus sayith
[1:48:23] the Lord You're a dad man next week I'd
[1:48:25] pretty much believe it not in this
[1:48:31] case thus sayith the Lord set your house
[1:48:34] in order for Thou shalt die and not live
[1:48:37] and when Hezekiah turned his face
[1:48:38] towards the wall and prayed unto the
[1:48:40] Lord and he said now remember Lord I
[1:48:43] beseech thee how I have walked before
[1:48:45] thee in truth and was a perfect heart
[1:48:47] and have
[1:48:48] done th which is good in thy sight and
[1:48:51] Hezekiah wept sorely
[1:48:53] and when it
[1:48:54] came then came the word of the Lord to
[1:48:57] Isaiah now he was still on the train
[1:48:59] leaving from telling him thus says the
[1:49:01] Lord You're a dead man you know can you
[1:49:03] imagine if he took a flight the ticket
[1:49:05] was paid to the other end he whoa whoa
[1:49:07] lay the plane stop the train get me off
[1:49:10] I'm going the wrong
[1:49:12] way the word of the Lord came to Isaiah
[1:49:16] that sounds like somebody that don't
[1:49:17] know what they're doing it's not the
[1:49:19] case at all it sounds like a father
[1:49:23] that's touched by the pain of his
[1:49:28] kids it's a father that
[1:49:31] cared go and say unto Hezekiah thus
[1:49:35] sayeth the Lord the god of David thy
[1:49:37] father that I have heard thy prayer and
[1:49:39] I've seen thy tears and behold I will
[1:49:41] add onto thy days 15 years and I will
[1:49:44] now now watch this he he he only prayed
[1:49:47] for life but I I I I was I literally had
[1:49:50] already put this verse in my iPad and I
[1:49:52] changed it and I took it out God
[1:49:54] couldn't just do that part now he had he
[1:49:57] had thus sayith the
[1:49:59] Lord you get
[1:50:01] me okay he said I will had 15 years to
[1:50:06] life but God God was so much turned by
[1:50:09] his motivation of prayer and he couldn't
[1:50:11] he that's all he'd asked for but God was
[1:50:13] on a roll that was coming down the
[1:50:15] mountain and he couldn't stop and I will
[1:50:17] also deliver thee and thy City out of
[1:50:20] the hands of the king of the Assyrians
[1:50:22] and I will defeat this I will defend
[1:50:25] this city and this shall be a sign unto
[1:50:27] thee the from the Lord that the Lord
[1:50:29] will do this thing that he has spoken
[1:50:32] and behold I will bring again the
[1:50:33] Shadows of the degree this degrees which
[1:50:38] is come down and the sun in the Sun
[1:50:45] and and he lowered the Sun by 10°
[1:50:50] backwards also the sun returned 10 10°
[1:50:54] by which degrees it had it was already
[1:50:59] down you know last or a couple Sundays
[1:51:01] ago we talked about watching the signs
[1:51:03] you know the this brother he never asked
[1:51:05] for
[1:51:06] that he never asked for them to save the
[1:51:08] city but God probably figured up there
[1:51:11] he said what good is it going to be if I
[1:51:13] give him 15 years extra and then the
[1:51:14] enemy comes in and Spears them with a
[1:51:17] spear so I got to like overprotect
[1:51:21] them amen
[1:51:25] Hallelujah God help
[1:51:27] us do we believe
[1:51:31] this do we believe
[1:51:33] this are we
[1:51:36] Believers how often should we pray we
[1:51:39] have everything right but
[1:51:43] prayer everything
[1:51:47] right Wow Let's just finish on the quote

[1:51:53] Just Once More Time Lord

[1:52:04] choking the spiritual life out of you

[1:52:12] Showmanship oh bless God on the platform
[1:52:16] your Hollywood your tensil your meetings
[1:52:20] that has got just to be so
[1:52:23] the preacher got to just handle it so
[1:52:25] and walk just so and wear the right
[1:52:27] uniform
[1:52:32] and all got to be in a great baked
[1:52:36] Church like the rest of the world it's
[1:52:39] got to be one of the
[1:52:41] biggest and come how
[1:52:44] ridiculous shows where your treasure is
[1:52:48] your heart's there turn
[1:52:52] turn from this and show us your presence
[1:52:56] turn turn wholeheartedly to God and his
[1:52:59] word and let's cry out once more Lord
[1:53:02] show us your presence let's
[1:53:09] stand
[1:53:13] amen God help us God help
[1:53:16] me you know we're we're so
[1:53:19] digitally programmed
[1:53:22] how
[1:53:23] things we think always have
[1:53:26] been but who said
[1:53:29] that
[1:53:31] amen who said
[1:53:33] that it's just our our it's like a
[1:53:36] carryover of religion that well we've
[1:53:38] always done it this way is that because
[1:53:41] God wanted it done that way God help us
[1:53:46] prayer the greatest weapon that we have
[1:53:49] we don't need a bunker we need prayer
[1:53:53] amen we're at a going home time and it's
[1:53:56] going to be a prayer praying people that
[1:53:59] are going to go home I don't mean from a
[1:54:01] I don't mean from a a sadducee and
[1:54:04] Pharisee standpoint that you
[1:54:07] know it's got to
[1:54:10] be you know there's people that have
[1:54:12] prayer on the
[1:54:14] internet and they will have and and and
[1:54:17] that's fine it's not evil it's their
[1:54:21] what they believe in but I
[1:54:23] don't I don't believe in it because I've
[1:54:26] never seen them yet invite a child to
[1:54:29] pray or a sister to
[1:54:32] pray they always
[1:54:35] hire the most popular preacher in North
[1:54:38] America to
[1:54:39] pray and I can't sit in front of my
[1:54:45] computer and pray under the anointing of
[1:54:47] God because our Prophet said God will
[1:54:50] never use mechanical devices
[1:54:54] that's for the tape church
[1:54:58] too it's on
[1:55:00] scriptural to have a big shot pray
[1:55:04] online it's on
[1:55:06] scriptural God said to pray in your
[1:55:09] closet pray the prophet said the prophet
[1:55:12] said I didn't read that quote the
[1:55:14] prophet said brother Brown said he said
[1:55:16] when you pray alone you pray
[1:55:20] differently see if I pray here on
[1:55:22] Wednesday night that that's that's the
[1:55:23] truth for brother Dale if I pray here on
[1:55:25] Wednesday night I'm I I pray differently
[1:55:28] because I'm more I'm more pronounce to
[1:55:30] name every name just right and every you
[1:55:33] know and not forget a name and all this
[1:55:35] but if I pray when I'm here alone God
[1:55:37] knows my thoughts that you thoughts are
[1:55:40] your families are just running through
[1:55:41] my head and say oh got to be with them
[1:55:43] be with them oh
[1:55:47] be brother Brown said you pray
[1:55:49] differently how H who would pray pray
[1:55:53] poorly when they're praying being video
[1:55:55] camera to go on the
[1:55:56] internet if you did they'd never have
[1:55:58] you
[1:55:59] again but who decides what's
[1:56:02] poorly because the Bible says that God
[1:56:05] don't hear it because you have great
[1:56:07] words amen God help us God help us to
[1:56:10] understand the god that we're dealing
[1:56:11] with he wants a relationship God made us
[1:56:15] to worship but God made us cuz he was
[1:56:17] lonely it was for worship and prayer one
[1:56:20] you know I we we had a a shower here
[1:56:23] this weekend and or yesterday and my
[1:56:25] family many of my family were here and
[1:56:27] but people you know just a it's a just a
[1:56:31] witness you get people you know the a
[1:56:34] mechanic was here that I bought my first
[1:56:37] car from come in my church can come in
[1:56:40] our church it was 39 years ago I bought
[1:56:43] the
[1:56:46] car
[1:56:49] wow man I had people come and and I'm
[1:56:52] not going to name the church cuz we're
[1:56:54] go to there's probably 500 people there
[1:56:56] this morning he said Dale I don't never
[1:56:58] one time come to your church and think
[1:57:01] wow I can't believe how nice it
[1:57:04] is where he's sitting there's probably
[1:57:06] four to 500
[1:57:09] today
[1:57:10] today it's not the build it's a spirit
[1:57:14] it's an
[1:57:15] atmosphere amen it's a it's an out it's
[1:57:18] an Outreach it's it's our whole thought
[1:57:20] of prayer and our life
[1:57:23] amen God help us God help me
[1:57:27] amen God help us to be in the spirit of
[1:57:30] communion amen any oh sorry I lost my
[1:57:33] thought there for a second anyway that
[1:57:36] yesterday somebody was talking about one
[1:57:38] of the fathers that their daughters had
[1:57:42] moved out of the
[1:57:43] house and they moved out four or five
[1:57:46] months
[1:57:47] ago and the father had called his
[1:57:49] daughter once a month
[1:57:53] I thought that's about how much we pray
[1:57:56] we talk to God about once a month
[1:57:57] seriously when the bills are all due at
[1:57:59] the
[1:58:01] end I wonder can you imagine having a
[1:58:04] daughter and calling her once a
[1:58:07] [Music]
[1:58:09] month wow I wonder if God would like to
[1:58:12] hear from
[1:58:13] you amen you know on my cell phone it
[1:58:16] has the most frequent
[1:58:18] callers I wonder if we're on God's cell
[1:58:20] phone the most frequent
[1:58:22] or if he's got to scroll through the
[1:58:24] whole world of the Bride to find brother
[1:58:26] Dale's
[1:58:28] name
