for my voice this morning I actually feel fine but I sound terrible I was more sick on Wednesday and this coming Wednesday we are going to cancel service again on Wednesday it's not because Prairie meeting is not important it's uh luanne's sisters coming up and it's the first time in about four years or three years because of covid amen so uh she's arriving on Wednesday and so um just for amen hey man just appreciate the song service too yeah the the choice of songs at the end were very much in the spirit of the word that's going to come forth and amen just praise God Amen what shall we say then so we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid how shall we that are dead in sin live any longer therein God forbid amen you know you know in the message just just just a quick comment here we all believe in predestination and elections but our Prophet taught us that if you teach that wrong it's disgrace amen First Corinthians 11 First Corinthians 11 8 and 9. First Corinthians 11 8 and 9. for man is not made of the woman but the woman of the man neither was Man created for the woman but the woman was created for the man Lord Jesus we ask you to bless your word you know the anointing and the and the inspiration that you gave this to me Lord Jesus made my only prayer would be that the people could catch how you fed it to me Lord Jesus and we'll sure praise you for it in your name amen amen God bless you you may have your seats just just a make some announcements before we start you can leave that scripture up just uh do really welcome and love you and and I I just want to say a big thank you to all that went and supported the meetings and it was a real blessing I mean of course we enjoy our home fellowship but God made us to fellowship with one another amen and there will be more in heaven than our church and we might as well get used to it once in a while on Earth I want to read you a quote that the prophet said about joint Fellowship he said and I pray that these ministers Lord that cooperated in this meeting that each of their churches will be benefited with such a great spiritual and material benefits because of their stand and to bring their people and the gospel in every true fashion that they know it's being preached in and I pray father that they will bless them and may their people be a priest appreciate them knowing that they are doing it for their sake and for the gospel sake and that they may in return help and put their shoulder to the wheel and to push the cause that we're trying to bring forth on the Earth in the name of Jesus Christ amen that's a 64 quote that the prophet said about fellowship churches that it came together amen John DayQuil tell me when he was Thanking us amen for being there amen and it does uh I'm not saying every time I would close our doors I don't think on Sunday we'll close our doors very many times but God would just trust his leading and also also before I start preaching I want to apologize for him for the meal uh that meal wasn't uh because of of uh on coordination the way it worked out the person they hired to the meal had cooked the chicken early and when the sisters seen them bring the meal in he called it stale but the sisters called it slimy and if anybody knows thank you sister Patty my wife said when you sleep Siamese chicken that's salamina poisoning and the sisters rejected the meal when it arrived Sunday that we would have been eating and probably got sick and so John dankwa had a apologize because um sorry because he had missed every one of of the church being there and leaving because he had actually went out and different ones of the note and bought all the barbecue chicken at all the grocery stores that were already pre-cooked and brought them back and ate them and like in the store he went through he bought 21 tickets pretty good so that was the story of the meal so it wasn't uh playing catastrophe it just worked out that way amen amen and so we we uh just thank God for all things also I just and I'm sorry for so many announcements but also we have many mothers with small kids and I just remind you again the small kids do not bother me a minister and if they bother you you need the Holy Ghost literally if you're in the church and the small small children I'm seeing small children bother you you need the Holy Ghost because you're sidetracked very easily and mothers don't have to be pressured because their kids are alive and breathing and moving if they weren't we'd have to lay hands on them so don't let that bother you amen kids under a small age are still human amen amen I want to preach a message today and I believe I really believe that God had given this to me and and you know because we're in the message and and we know and understand predestination and election and it's preached very many many many times and and and of course it takes away all the fear to a holy ghost-filled believer but I want to show you many examples and how the prophet brought it and and also I'm going to use typologie from the natural and so when I'm talking about a woman and a man I'm not talking about in your flesh I'm just comparing us to Christ it's completely us to Christ amen and but the prophet taped everything in the in the natural and you know there's there's almost everything in the natural types of spiritual but you know there's one type in the natural that uh that it it's a lot different in the spiritual and that is if you're a married sister in the in the natural many times uh if you uh have a human for a husband the wife gets blamed for everything amen if the husband comes home the house is dirty it's her fault if the kids are noisy well that's her fault too and you know if food's cold it's her fault and if the clothes aren't washed that's her fault too and and you know it's probably her fault of the house leaks you know what I mean it's her fault if she didn't pay the bills and it's her fault if she paid the bills and the bank account's empty but it's not that way with the bride of Christ it really is not amen God don't blame you for who you are amen he loved us just how we are but there's one thing that he expected us to do and that was surrender completely unconditionally surrender Amen to him and you know in this age a lady to see a laodicea is is people's rights or individual rights and you know the prophet he never mentioned this and I actually struggled and study this much you know the prophet never said until after the about mid 65 was the very first time and he said it five times that we're not in the laodicean age the bride the Holy Ghost filled bride is not they're in the bright age but you know in the Scriptures it stops at the laodicean age and we're even though that a holy ghost filled believer is in the bride age you are under the Same Spirit as the layout of cnh and that is individual rights and we see a world I don't mean I don't mean I don't mean in this church and I don't mean in the bride and I definitely don't mean in Holy Ghost Field Believers but everybody has an opinion and a right and you know don't look at me because and don't touch me because and and I'm right because and but that's not the bride that Jesus Christ is coming to marry amen amen let's just read a quote maybe we can lay a foundation without marriage and divorce the the prophet said he said she's perfectly he said she's everything that the word is and she's perfectly every part of the word and he said you'll notice that even in the Old Testament you know David and Samuel they had multiple wives okay that was that was in the Old Testament we're not living in the Old Testament age okay uh we're definitely don't believe in polygamy not at all but he said back then he said they could have multiple wives but those wives could never have more than one husband and he said the husband can put his wife away but the wife could never put her husband away amen no don't ask me to understand that because I don't even understand that that's just that was just under the law the Bible amen but that carries forth that you're not going to put Christ away but he can put you away he can put you away if you won't surrender to him amen surrender to his word unconditionally and he said any wife that would refuse her husband a child deserves to be put away but now just think of that spiritually amen any bride Christian that refuses Christ's message is useless to Christ amen is useless to Christ and he will put you away he said and it is with the church that refused to become pregnant in this age and I love this part for all the people that are online I just I know I know we we have a great you know and even the prophet said when I was looking into the bride age he said this is beautiful beautiful brother Mike he said we're not in the Pentecostal age man I'm not even Pentecostal you know when the prophet said he was Pentecostal top and said tip of his toes now he had progressive revelation he completely changed that he said the Pentecostal age was later to see an age they were the ones that were lukewarm and refused God's word they refused to carry on they refused State God's seed I'm not part of that age there's no part of that age at all of course we take what Luther had salvation we take what Wesley had with sanctification of course we take the gifts the Vindication of the gifts and but we have the word we have the complete word and he said here he says that the church has refused to become pregnant and the age that we now live in he said it brings forth Children of the age not of Luther and not of Wesley and neither are we Pentecostals for all you people that still want to be Pentecostal I hope you enjoy the tribulation because I won't be there with you but he said we've got to be children amen and I hope you understand that he said you can't he said you can't be pregnant no so what did he do he put you away amen God bless you brother Jim amen he put you away in divorcement because you're refusing to be his wife amen that's why you can't be married if you still have your living old husband that's still around amen you you can't you can't serve two masters amen and so here we say that the woman was made for the man we're made the Bride of Crisis made for the pleasure of Christ period amen all that he wants is his and his bride amen it's beautiful amen but the church denomination has refused that and here we see and we're going to get into this many examples can you you know you you got to look at the message with wisdom they asked the prophet he said you know brother Jim they asked the prophet he said who's going to be there into Revelation he said if your name's on the Lamb's Book of Life you'll be there but here and hearing questions and answers in the end of 64. and now listen I'm not I'm not contradicting the prophet he's our prophet and he's right but he was growing amen and see there was times that he was answering one question he would answer it this way and then he'd answer another question this way and you got to bring them both to the center you take both of them bring them together and say well this is what he meant here and this is what he meant here and I'm not trying to change it I'm going to read exactly the message this morning but he said there's multiple peoples whose names was on the Lamb's Book of Life and God refused them I'm like huh so I I when I when I find a I dig really deep and so he gave me lots of examples brother Brown give us four examples and so you know in the message we wouldn't hear that very often we're predestinated election but the Bible says that many are called but few are chosen amen and you will prove that you're his by surrendering your will you're made for him Christ says do it you don't say but amen and so we might read more of that in Romans you know and talked about that uh more but we see here maybe I'll I'll just jump ahead but uh uh we see this let me give you one example before we read the quote the questions answers we see this in Esther amen now this is just strictly an aperture type of a spiritual but viceiva refused the king the king it doesn't matter if you agreed with the king or not see Christ ain't concerned whether you agree with them or not amen he's not even concerned if you understand it he's just concerned that you surrender so here's the King's throne a party for his people and the queen was thrown a party for her ladies and the Kings get drunk and he's happy and he's married and after many days and that and now he wants to show off his wife that's exactly how the scripture does he said she was beautiful and pleasant to look upon and she probably thinks that this fat guy's Stone drunk and he disgusting me man I'm switching from natural to spiritual here man I don't mean that we think that of Christ but you say to me and she was too concerned about her own program be careful when the wife is on their own agenda see she had her own party going on with the ladies and that's what the the denominational and the people that's got their own pet Doctrine and their own kingdom and their own they want to be Pentecostal or they want to be something you know be careful because Christ might ask you to come in and he wants to see you and you say but I'm in the middle of but I'm in the middle baking a cake I can't come he said I don't care about your cake hey man you know the story of my Siva very well but this was a major major party that he was throwing and there was some major alcohol going on and when he was married the Bible says when he was married on the seventh day with wine he ordered his people to bring in bath Shiva and vashiba refused the king and the reason he had asked for her because he was proud of her and she was beautiful and she was fair to look upon now the Bible goes in and says that the counselors of the king said now Bathsheba hasn't just sinned against you King but she sinned against every husband in the Kingdom because now the wives are going to be bossing their husbands around now that sounds like the laodicean church age if I've ever heard it amen the prophet talked about World War II when the women went to work wearing overhauls and started having their own bank accounts and ordering the house around and amen taking men's jobs and becoming policemen amen and they said to the king they said if you don't penalize her there will be no man in the Kingdom that will be able to have a wife that'll surrender to him amen you know what that means as adults in the natural and that's what crisis meaning to us in the spiritual amen God help us amen and you know you can move on to this story so the queen or the king put her away and he went to the all his men went and found the virgins of the country and this story don't stop hearing you it's a perfect type spiritually he said you know when the when Esther came in she wasn't one of them she was Jew and because her uncle told her she withheld that from even her own people she didn't tell her own people where she was and of course she never told the people where she was but Esther was the only one in the king's Chambers that never required their own Doctrine she didn't require something different than the word of God the message of the hour she didn't require an old Doctrine she didn't require Noah's message or Lutheran's message or you see what I mean because they offered them whatever they wanted and whatever they thought would make them beautiful for some painted themselves like a barn some probably wore high heels some probably wore no clothes at all very few clothes but Esther said just whatever you tell me to do I just want exactly whatever the king wants what a perfect type of the bride of Christ just whatever the God wants of course you know the story The King was delighted with her and made her Queen and even to half her kingdom and you know even when Esther went in you know if you go farther when the when the Mordecai was trying to kill their people Esther yes she did call her people to pray and fast but Esther had no fear going into the king because she knew the king had accepted her in Redemption amen the king accept her see it's one thing to say you're a believer but do you have confirmation from Christ that he's accepted your atonement amen accepted your gift amen that's what we need amen there's a lot of people preaching or a lot of people testifying but the proof is in the pudding amen and here here's the questions and answers uh message well let me just even sorry let me show you this here in the scripture again before so when we preach predestination and election it's so easy to believe well and many people sitting Among Us they said well like I believe the send time message completely so I'm saved I'll be there not necessarily Satan believes it and he won't be there amen Satan knows what you believe is the truth but he won't be there you know here's Peter when Jesus sent out the disciples and Jesus gave them power to cast out demons and things they'd say well some would say well if you got Vindication of your ministry your gifts that's hilarious who had more Vindication than the disciples that went out and come back bragging to Jesus how the Devils were subject to him and Jesus himself said to Peter he said when you get converted strengthen the Brethren converted converted how could he say converted when he walked with Jesus for three and a half years and was going around preaching the guy said oh devils I've been like you coming up to a minister that's preaching for years and got a dynamic Ministry in Casa no spirits and say Hey brother when you get converted you won't preach that some of them need to be told that amen yep amen here's another one you know Jesus anytime you know we know that Jesus went to the worst of sinners the worst of our Sinners but in every case see we read that in the first revelation of Romans he said you know what shall we say then should we have Grace So sin could abound God forbid you know when when Jesus came to the worst Sinners what was the thing he said all the time I forgive you but go and sin no more amen you're not forgiven and still living in sin God don't give anybody the baptism of the Holy Ghost living in a dirty cop amen amen I'm not taking a drink of water out of a cop that looks like a pig pen I won't be thirsty very bad and neither will God be thirsty for your life if you think he's going to put the holy ghost in a cup that's completely garbage amen so when you get saved you're not converted when you get Sanctified and you got a beautiful clean cup and you wear a nice tie and you got an awesome haircut you're not converted not yet when you're casting out devils and preaching the gospel I hope you're not preaching but there is some that are if you're not born again you're not converted amen so here's Jesus when he's seeing the woman got in the very Act and he wrote In The Sand now she was she was a sinner he said where's your accusers they said neither do I accuse you but from this time forward amen some people are playing around with the world thinking they're coming to church in a message church if you don't get rid of that garbage you'll never go in a rapture you'll never go in a Rapture you're you're messing with God and he don't like it it's like a husband or a wife that's cheating on her husband any kind of a man with any kind of discernment at all we'll pick that up like that because it's spirits and god Jehovah definitely will Christ Jesus amen this is the long quote and Vicky on him sorry please sorry I forgot to give it to you it's completely shut off it's on Facebook Messenger we started the third picture um just for your I'm a poor reader and I got a terrible voice this morning but here they asked brother Brown this is a 6408 30 questions and answers and he says brother Brown you said in the seventh Church age you mentioned that Judith was had been Justified and Sanctified was I genuine because see they're thinking he was converted and yet he was the devil and the prophet said that's a good question and he explained in general Grace that he received genuine Grace he said also mentioned that judah's name was on the Lamb's Book of Life now how can you be lost if your name's on the Lamb's Book of Life I'm going to give you I think four examples this morning to peoples whose names were on the Lamb's Book of Life and because of their will see we believe in predestination and election and believe me I praise God for it because it took all my fear away but you're still a free moral agent yes sir and when your husband comes to you and wants to take you as your wife and you deny her not him your name's just been removed amen amen so he said now that's a good one isn't it he said he said no it would be good he said it depended on the Lord uh depending on the Lord to answer this question he said I mentioned that judah's name was on the Lamb's Book of Life that's right at the beginning of the red he said that's right he said we know that because Jesus told them when they all was sent out in Matthew 10 and cast out devils and preached the gospel and freely give freely receive freely give and they return back rejoicing because the Devils were subject onto them see you got to have discernment don't necessarily sit under a Ministry because he's got great show if that's the case there's a lot of TV evangelists that would do great job Matt Hallelujah and Jesus told him he said he called their names which ones and set them out and he said and he came back and Judas is scary which had betrayed him no it's still the first one ah no we're three there right there sorry we'll start from there I'd already read the other ones he said now in the blue there he said now the attitude was wrong there you mustn't Rejoice because you got power over Devils you he said watch this he said you mustn't do that Rejoice because you've even received enough Grace to be saved he said you must rejoice that's how people should be he said surely people that has a gift people who don't want usually people that has gifts are people who don't want gifts so you watch the people that are always wanting uh the demonstration of God the show-off of God Amen which we believe God could do that but see God's sovereign it's up to him amen Paul tried to run from the thing Moses and great leaders like that tried to run from their job and now it lays before God he said you see you take a guy that always oh Lord fill me with power and I'll go out there and I'll cast out those devils he said this is right there at the top there he said he'll never do it God will never do it because he knows you can never handle it amen God knows better than to trust anybody like that wow amen it's a guy that don't want nothing to do with the ministry nothing to do with it he said that's the guy that God will take and teach him something sometime he said so back when Judas was back rejoicing with all them in the names he said don't Rejoice because the devil's subject unto you he said Rejoice because your name's written in the book of life now if you'll notice and he goes to Daniel here he says because your name's in the book of life because it's in heaven your name has been recognized that now here it's right in the middle of the paper there I got mine highlighted in yellow but he said it that doesn't mean that you're saved now I haven't heard that many times in a message Church your name's on the Lamb's Book of Life you so I'm predestinated I'll be there but not if your Will's wrong not if you refuse your husband today he's saying if your name's on the Lamb's Book of Life and inhabitants recognized in heaven he said that still doesn't mean that you're saved he said see you're not converted until you receive the Holy Ghost wow remember that that don't it's right below the blue in the middle he said that still doesn't mean that you're saved he said you're converted when you see the Holy Ghost he said you're only potentially converted potentially there's a lot of people in message churches that are potentially converted and they're living a lie and flirting with the world and they're doing it because election and predestination is pushed so hard which we believe but don't be deceived you know in your heart what your will is if you refuse his seed you know it nobody the whole world might not know about you and your husband but those two people know and you and Christ know you can fool all of us but you're not fooling Christ amen you might as well recognize it before you get there you're not going to get there and say well I know my name was in the Lamb's Book of Life so I'd be safe God's going to scroll back to this morning with the minister of terrible voice and say you couldn't understand him he had it on the screen too man you still have the will to accept or reject seed because God isn't a Forester amen and if you ask me about an oak tree and he said if you got an acorn potentially he got an oak tree he said if you ask me about a field of corn he said you got to see the corn potentially you got to see the corn he said you're Justified he said now you're on your road through justification sanctification the three works of Grace and working to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and but when you're genuinely baptized with the Holy Ghost then you're in the Kingdom man let's go to the next page here here he said just the end of the other one Jesus told Peter who had been uh John 17 17 Jesus said John 17 17. Jesus said sanctify them Father through the truth for your word is truth that's right at the top there and here here Jesus was telling Peter before he betrayed him man Amy just maybe leave that off if I hey Matt here's the prophet said he said the man that followed him for three years and had his name in the Lamb's Book collect that's right near the top and it cleared not highlighted and had its name in the lanes book light was cast out to the devils got so Devil's done great works and field many and all kinds of things and preach the word and everything but still converted we're going to jump down to let's go to the next page 282. there the prophet repeats himself a bunch he even compares there the part that we skipped about a woman when a man and wife come together potentially they will have a baby but he said there's not a baby until the baby's born amen he said so just beginning the second paragraph down there on 282. he said another book was open it was the book of life and those whose names were on the Book of Life had to be judged out of the book he said Judas Iscariot professed to be a believer had his name written among them on the Book of Life is that right and he claimed to have eternal life condemned the word of life then he sold out for 30 pieces of silver see him come right back to his will he would have never had to be judged but his will was wrong we won't be judged because we're judged already we're judged here you're surrendering your will is allowing judgment amen sorry amen I said watch this now some sell out to be Methodist or whatever more sellout their position from the Lamb's Book of Life see their position from the Lamb's Book of Life and he'll be judged and he'll have to be stand there the Judgment by the word see that's the Judas did it and Judas came to the judgment and his name was on the Lamb's Book of Life but that didn't mean he was saved he had to stand the judgment now here's the sleeping versions that slam right there under the same same thing and Jesus said that uh in uh John 5 24 he said he that heareth my word and here the prophet breaks us down amen God bless our Prophet for uh Divine interpretation of the word he said this don't mean here this means receive amen it goes right back to your will again if you'll receive him then you're accepted but if you won't receive them then you're not amen that it's him that receiveth not him that just hears and preach he said that's nonsense him that receiveth my word and heareth my word and believeth on it has passed from Death unto life he said right there down at the bottom he said so Judith had his name there in the Lamb's Book life he said that's exactly right but he was condemned because what he did to do he sold out his Birthright he said uh uh here's a Esau was born Esau he uses a again as a type of having his name in the last book life here Esau was born in the family promised to God the eldest son and had the birthright and how many knows that but the promise of God Esau's name was on the Lamb's Book book for the birthright but he swapped it a man for a bowl of soup because he was hungry amen so even though your name's in the Lamb's Book of Life and even though we preached predestination and even though we believe in and and all the predestination of being called not you still have the will to refuse your husband if you ever refuse your husband you'll never be there amen you'll never be there flirting with the world and having two husbands it's it's not going to be amen it's not going to be he said those spies that went over except Joshua and Caleb he said they all had their names on the Lamb's Book of Life but they sold out their Birthright because they refused to believe that God had given the Promised Land so there's there you have Esau had his name was promise to have his name's on the Lamb's Book of Life you have the the spice the one with Joshua and Caleb sold out the birth right and you have Judas Iscariot that all were predestinated to be in heaven as part of the bride and because of their will and their choices they were refused amen God help us God help us in this message because God's revealed you know who much is given much is required amen and God has taken the seals off the book and the the Bible is a brand new book and the Mysteries are completely revealed but sometimes people in the message are trying to hide under that and saying well look I believe the prophet and I I believe so much of this but at the same time they're living in a world of Hollywood or they're flirting with another husband amen God help us God help us I want I want to just I know this would maybe be a bit slow but the next one is a really it's it's worth it man we got our tongue amen Jesus said or here he says Paul with the inspiration and the Hebrews chapter he says for it is impossible for those that were once enlightened and been partakers of the Holy Ghost who have tasted the power of the world to come if they will fall away and renew themselves again unto repentance seeing as that they have crucified themselves the Son of God again encountered the blood Covenant wherewith they were signified in the Holy they they disgrace God Amen let's go to 287 and then everyone besides Joshua and Caleb died in Parish in the wilderness yet they were Believers and their names were on the Lamb's Book of Life that's what our Prophet says amen God help us and when they refused the gate to the baptism of the Holy Ghost because of can you help me out there honey right at the bottom and clear because of denominational they've refused to walk in that person is lost and can never be saved see they've done that despite even the very works of Grace that's called them up to that place and showed them and then they turned around and walk away and he counts the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was crucified amen if we drop right to the bottom there now watch the pattern Judas Iscariot followed those same steps he was justified believing that the Lord Jesus Christ then had accepted him as a personal savior he was Sanctified given the power to cast out spirits in the name of the lamb and his names in the lamb Book of Life but it came when it came to the Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost and the fullness of the word he showed his true colors that's exactly what the Canaan spice did and that's exactly what Esau done he said that's exactly what he did in the garden surely God will not amen hallelujah he said let's just drop to 291 he said the church followed through this through justification and Martin Luther through sanctification in Wesley but when it comes to the time the baptism of the Holy Ghost has showed their true colors and they want nothing to do with it and he talked about the the Holiness Church is there that they believe in sanctification and and you and they're clean people you can't lay a finger on them amen but stop short of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the new birth the devil has tricked them let's drop to 292. there he said he brought them around to say uh he said you have a sensation and you have to do this and you have been and you have to be born into it he said don't tell he said don't let no one tell you this is this is the part I want to get to don't let no one tell you that sanctification is the same work of Grace is the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said it's not it's certainly not and there there's a Nazarene person sitting below there he said no it's not it's many many churches believe it they're saved and they're Sanctified and they're living a holy life but with the prophet saying here is they're not even converted they're not even converted yet amen the reason they're not converted because they haven't received life they haven't received his life God help us amen amen God help us let's just turn to uh James 4. we can come out of that Amy James 4 and 17 we're going to close here in just a second I'm gonna read Romans amen James 4 and 17 therefore therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is a sin amen so if you're sitting in a message charge and you say well I'm going to be there because I'm predestinated I'm going to be there because my name's on the Lamb's Book of Life I'm going to be there because I know my name's on the Lamb's Book of Life because I recognize the message of our age but if you're not born again yet you're not even converted you're not even converted amen and you can dial some people's lives if they're not converted because God won't give the Holy Ghost to somebody that's got a dirty life we'll all that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost have shortcomings we'll all have shortcomings and stumble and I might insult Matt and slam the door on brother Jim okay those are shortcomings but flat out sin God ain't there God ain't there because God can have fellowship with sin you know our Prophet said when Jesus died on the cross watch this is very important when Jesus died on the cross the spirit of God left Jesus I can give you the quote for that because God couldn't look at sin the spirit of the god left Jesus because God can't look or have receive sin amen even though Jesus was the son of God and died for our sins but God don't have fellowship with sins man and we know the prophet clearly taught us that God had to Tabernacle in a flesh body because the spirit can't die but God you're not telling us you're not belie you're believing a lie to say I'm filled with the Holy Ghost and your life is obviously in a backsoluted state may God help us God help us let's just read Revelations or Romans sorry Romans 6. we're going to close with this and I want to read down to uh I think about 14. I'm going to start the top in about 14. this is this is a good read I want to bring to your attention that it's Romans 8. where the saint where the same writer Paul talks about predestination and election and totally your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and his Ephesians 1 and 5 in different places we totally believe in that but you can take that to the extreme and get to heaven and you might as well know the truth here is to get there and say well nobody showed me nobody showed me you'll have no excuses there what shall we say then shall we continue in sin the grace they abound see this was a message where we were doing away with the law and Grace was coming over our shortcomings but that don't mean that you will fully sin when you willfully accept another husband there's no atonement for that God forbid how so we live how shall we that our dad to sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us that as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by the baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we shall also shall walk in newness of Life see your life will be changed if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost most cases you won't have to tell anybody certainly not somebody else that's got to hold a ghost because your spirits you you can see it you can feel it amen for if we had been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man he died is crucified with him that the body of sin may be destroyed can't have two husbands and hencefor we shall not serve sin no more see these other believers their their second husband hadn't died yet amen for he that is Dad is free from sin now we be dead in Christ we believe that we shall also live in him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth to God likewise reckon ye ourselves yourselves to be dad indeed to sin but to live unto God through Jesus Christ let not sin therefore reign over your mortal body what what this whole message is this morning is people are living under the umbrella of predestination and live and under sin they're living under the umbrella of the message and they're eating their brother for dinner amen let not sin therefore Reign Over Your mortal body that ye shall obey it in the lust thereof neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin there's your will Leo that yield your members as instruments to sin on righteousness that's a choice that you have amen but yield yourself unto God as those that are alive from death and your members are instruments of righteousness unto God for for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace amen thank God for Grace amen but we don't want to take Grace to a disgrace and may God help us to realize that if we're under grace we'll never crucify him again we'll recognize that we were saved but when you're saved from something that was evil why do you want to flirt with fire why do you want to flirt with the poisonous snake why do you want to flirt with something that you've already been hurt with burn once you learn burn twice amen no forgiveness God help assist them God help us and you really look into that I apologize again for my my voice and my cough when you really look into that and you think of how Peter and Judas Iscariot preach the gospel follow Jesus three and a half years his ministry for some of his closest friends Connections in the world one of the twelves two of the twelve cast out demons and money wondrous works at an unbelievable Ministry and one was the devil and the other was unconverted wow it shows you that with the natural eye you can never see what you think amen God help us foreign empty and broken amen [Music] thank you foreign thank you Lord [Music] foreign Jesus [Music] amen foreign [Music] foreign [Music] you know it's been said that God sees us are in picture and he don't see our sin [Music] because he sees the product finished the predestinate and that's true if that sins under the blood but if that's to know to do right and not do it is Iniquity [Music] and if that's willful sin for all those people that are hiding under predestination if you willfully sin God sees it God don't see your sinful mistakes when you stumble and fall you didn't mean to do it it wasn't pre it's the difference of murder or premeditated murder if you make a calculated decision I'm going to go out and sin God sees that sin and you're not converted God help us not to preach that wrong or hide under an umbrella that's untrue God help me amen God knows we're in flesh bodies and we make mistakes daily Paul said I fall daily but that wasn't premeditated intentional mistakes it was because we were in a weak body God help us amen Lord Jesus we love you and Lord we ask that you just bless this bride and may you take my my terrible scattered thoughts today and and voice Lord Jesus and may they make sense of it Lord Jesus Through Your Divine anointing Lord Jesus I pray bless your bride in a special way Lord Jesus and our only desire Lord Jesus so know and live the trips and understand it how you brought it Lord Jesus how your Prophet revealed it and know the truth here so we can stand tall over there Lord Jesus
