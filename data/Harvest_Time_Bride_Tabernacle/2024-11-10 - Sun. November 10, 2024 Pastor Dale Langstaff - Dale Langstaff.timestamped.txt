[36:10] let's go to Genesis
[36:12] 292 and uh I uh I uh I promise you I
[36:17] mean unless God uh uh
[36:20] really whoops me we're going to change
[36:23] complete topics next Sunday I want to
[36:26] preach on slavery
[36:28] next
[36:29] Sunday and uh something I've been
[36:32] working on for weeks and weeks and
[36:37] uh when God uh laid this on my heart I
[36:41] told God I said I've already preached
[36:43] this message from every angle you can
[36:45] think
[36:49] of and uh God basically said that's okay
[36:55] we're going to swing again
[36:58] amen I went back in my my message and I
[37:01] I had to even go back in my iPad I said
[37:03] see God I preached this in the
[37:04] summertime I said but that that didn't
[37:07] work either so God knows God knows what
[37:10] he's doing amen so Genesis
[37:13] 39 I can't see my number 30
[37:18] 39 and the Lord was with Joseph and he
[37:22] was a prosperous man and he was in the
[37:24] house of his master the Egyptian
[37:29] and his master saw now I want you to
[37:31] catch this this is a pagan person and
[37:35] the Pagan person saw that the
[37:38] Lord was with him and the Lord made all
[37:44] that he the Pagan person did or sorry
[37:47] that Joseph did Prosper but we're going
[37:49] to get to the other part and Joseph
[37:51] found Grace in his sight and he served
[37:54] him and he made him the overseer of his
[37:57] house and all that he made all that he
[38:01] had he put into his hand and it came to
[38:03] pass at the
[38:05] time that he made him overseer of his
[38:07] house and over that he had made him that
[38:11] the Lord that's the part I wanted to get
[38:13] you that the Lord
[38:15] blessed the
[38:19] Pagan now that's that's far
[38:23] out that the Lord blessed the Egyptians
[38:27] house
[38:28] for Joseph's sake now you could work for
[38:32] a
[38:33] pagan and God will bless the pagans bank
[38:37] account for
[38:41] you man when you get a hold of that one
[38:44] Hallelujah and the blessings of the Lord
[38:46] was upon all that he made in the had in
[38:49] the house and in the field and he his
[38:52] master now he talking about this Pagan
[38:54] again his master left all that he had
[38:58] to
[39:00] Joseph would we trust each other that
[39:05] way
[39:07] on would I leave all that I had in your
[39:10] hands or would you leave all you have in
[39:12] your hands this was our Pagan King and
[39:17] Joseph was our
[39:20] slave he left all that he had into
[39:24] Joseph's hand and he knew not how much
[39:27] he
[39:28] had save the bread that he ate and
[39:32] Joseph was a goodly person and well
[39:35] favored Lord Jesus we pray that you'll
[39:37] bless your word and bless your thoughts
[39:40] this morning and may we be able to
[39:42] comprehend you Lord Jesus as you
[39:45] Minister your word and we give you the
[39:47] glory for it in your name amen you may
[39:49] have your seats and I just want to read
[39:51] another scripture just
[39:54] to Philippians 2
[39:59] 12 Philippians 2:12 and I'm just going
[40:01] to start because I got a lot of hay to
[40:03] go through if you'll forgive me
[40:05] Philippians 2:12 to15 therefore my
[40:08] beloved as ye have always obeyed not as
[40:12] in my presence only but now much more in
[40:15] my
[40:17] absence work out your
[40:20] own
[40:24] salvation with
[40:26] fear and
[40:28] trembling I want to preach on that this
[40:30] morning God wants to preach on
[40:33] that for it is God which worketh in you
[40:41] both that's now every word in the word
[40:44] is there for a purpose so in the family
[40:47] of God you're working out your own
[40:50] salvation with fear but in the other
[40:54] part of the family God's also working
[40:56] out their salvation but it's not your
[41:00] business and you both to Will and to do
[41:03] the good pleasure and to do all things
[41:06] without trying to save the other person
[41:10] murmuring or disputing that ye may be
[41:13] blameless and
[41:15] harmless and the sons of God now there's
[41:18] that family without rebuke in the midst
[41:22] of a cired and perverse Nation among
[41:26] whom
[41:27] ye shine as
[41:31] lights amen thank you Lord
[41:35] Jesus me just find my text here you know
[41:39] we want to minister this morning and God
[41:42] gave me this thought on the the family
[41:45] and the family of God and and if you'll
[41:47] forgive me I'm just going to shoot kind
[41:49] of from the hip but we we know that the
[41:52] quotes where our Prophet showed us that
[41:54] God was Elohim when he when he was a
[41:56] self-existing one one and when he spoke
[41:58] us and his eternal thoughts and he spoke
[42:00] his family then he no more was
[42:02] self-existing but he was dwelt with his
[42:05] family and if now our Prophet clearly
[42:08] and praise God for for this type our
[42:11] Prophet always preached all his messages
[42:13] typ in the natural and the spiritual and
[42:16] now if you compare the family and
[42:18] anybody's family and just think of your
[42:20] own family amen it is never the the
[42:24] father that has an individual
[42:28] problem differently with his
[42:31] children the father will always have a
[42:34] very good handle on how his children are
[42:37] unique and and and and and and
[42:42] uh you know uh he's he's not worried
[42:46] about his children being different and
[42:48] unique and and uh I'm trying to find the
[42:50] right word but
[42:53] peculiar but the
[42:55] children walk always have a problem with
[42:59] the other child that don't fix the
[43:02] mold it will never be the father that
[43:05] comes and says you're the black sheep of
[43:07] the family it'll be the other it'll be
[43:09] amongst the children that'll say there's
[43:12] the Black
[43:14] Sheep amen and so is it in the family of
[43:18] God and God just dumped a truckload of
[43:20] that on top of my head and it just was
[43:23] like unbelievable how the the word
[43:25] unfolded but God's not concerned about
[43:28] losing any that's in his hand but we sit
[43:31] amongst one another and we say well this
[43:33] shouldn't be and that shouldn't be and
[43:35] all and all me and my and all there that
[43:37] and that and and and the Bible says that
[43:40] we shouldn't be doing this it says that
[43:42] we shouldn't be disputing and and we
[43:45] should be harmless and stuffs and and we
[43:47] got to trust Jehovah to be Jehovah that
[43:50] he'll supply all our needs even the
[43:52] other children's
[43:54] needs amen amen that ain't to say that I
[43:58] understand and I believe with all of my
[44:00] heart and believe me if you knew how I
[44:02] was raised you would you would
[44:04] understand I believe that you know them
[44:07] by their fruits if you are something you
[44:10] can't produce something that you're not
[44:12] I understand that perfectly and I'm
[44:14] trying to find my notes here where I'm
[44:17] at but I want to show you something and
[44:21] I want to tell you something that you
[44:22] got to get in your own mind we're still
[44:26] here
[44:29] I want to say that again we're still
[44:34] here and it ain't God's fault it's
[44:38] brother Dale's fault and you can make
[44:40] that just as personal as you can humble
[44:42] yourself to make that but it's not the
[44:45] father's fault that we're still here but
[44:48] we're disputing among once another and
[44:50] we need to shut up and back up and let
[44:53] God be the father amen and and that's
[44:57] that's not to say we're not promoting
[44:59] sin I'm not talking about letting the
[45:00] bars down and letting the goats in or
[45:03] backing up from the scriptures and the
[45:05] word of God and the law of God I'm not
[45:07] saying that at all I'm saying it ain't
[45:09] your
[45:10] business I'm saying it ain't your
[45:13] business it's God's business amen I'm
[45:16] saying don't you compromise One spec if
[45:19] you think that you should wear a long
[45:21] sleeve shirt to your risk you wear a
[45:23] long sleeve shirt to your risk if you
[45:25] think you should wear a tie on Sunday
[45:26] morning you wear a tie on Sunday morning
[45:29] it we know the word says that women will
[45:31] have long hair it's their Glory God give
[45:33] us this glory and and we're going to get
[45:35] into some of that how God gave Jesus
[45:38] said to the father he said all the glory
[45:40] that God gave Jesus he poured into his
[45:42] bride and and it's so beautiful to
[45:45] recognize the the the minister Wednesday
[45:48] night mentioned that that and here Jesus
[45:50] said to the women he said your hair is
[45:52] your glory and it it's it's submission
[45:55] to the church thinks
[45:58] spiritual amen we're supposed to be the
[46:01] most glorious thing that ever was
[46:04] created and it's not our Glory it's
[46:07] God's glory he gave the bride his wife
[46:11] all this glory and he taked it in the
[46:13] natural for a sister having long hair it
[46:15] was her glory but in the spiritual it
[46:17] was Jehovah he just P all that was in
[46:21] God he poured into Christ all the glory
[46:23] that went into Christ he poured into his
[46:25] wife
[46:28] amen and I want to show you an Old
[46:30] Testament story
[46:32] here and we'll get into our notes but we
[46:36] want to look at Jacob in the Bible and
[46:39] I'm going to paraphrase this into
[46:41] Genesis 37 is is the main part of the
[46:45] chapter and I'm going to hit some
[46:46] different verses but I want to show you
[46:48] every single example now now when we
[46:51] back up we know that Joseph was one of
[46:54] the younger children and Joseph was a
[46:56] perfect type of Christ that's right the
[47:00] Bible only records one flaw that he had
[47:02] one little mistake it was still a
[47:05] mistake but other than not he it would
[47:08] have been like he was
[47:13] Christ I'm going to show you every
[47:15] scripture in this Old Testament that it
[47:18] was never once that the father had
[47:20] trouble with any of his
[47:23] sons it was always the sons and
[47:25] daughters that had trouble with the sons
[47:27] and
[47:28] daughters God don't have trouble with
[47:31] none of the bride of Christ around the
[47:32] world no matter where they've chose to
[47:34] be their home Church no matter where
[47:36] they're serving him no matter what God
[47:38] ain't having no trouble with none of
[47:39] them but in amongst the brothers and
[47:42] sisters we
[47:44] are we are and it's because we're not
[47:47] obeying the scripture that's maybe maybe
[47:50] we could go back to let's just let's
[47:52] just lay a foundation here this is God
[47:54] forgive us he watch how here in
[47:56] Philippians 2 it says that you may be
[48:00] blameless work out your own salvation
[48:02] with fear and trembling that you may be
[48:04] blameless and
[48:07] harmless and
[48:09] harmless just let that sink in for a
[48:11] minute just think of your history in the
[48:13] message
[48:14] church I don't want to think of my
[48:16] history God covered it with the
[48:19] blood
[48:21] harmless
[48:23] sons of
[48:25] God Sons of God okay watch without
[48:31] rebuke that
[48:34] means leave it to
[48:36] God with prayer in the midst of a cared
[48:40] and per well we we're there we've
[48:42] arrived and perverse Nation among whom
[48:45] ye sign as lights of the world I wonder
[48:47] if we're shining as bright as we could
[48:50] and now you know you know all the
[48:52] scriptures and I can't cover everything
[48:53] on one Sunday but you see what I mean
[48:55] here now now I'm going to get to it I'm
[48:58] going to clarify now we're not lowering
[49:00] the goats I'm not talking about just I
[49:03] mean we could fill this place up if we
[49:04] didn't believe in
[49:06] nothing no no I'm not talking about that
[49:09] I'm not talking about
[49:10] that and we we'll we'll separate that
[49:13] let's just look into this family here in
[49:15] Genesis 37:2 it said these generations
[49:18] of Jacob Joseph being the 17th they
[49:21] believed in having kids so being 17
[49:24] years old sorry was feeding the flocks
[49:27] with his Brethren and Joseph brought an
[49:30] evil report uh-oh there you
[49:33] go wasn't the father that brought an
[49:36] evil
[49:37] report it was the son of another
[49:40] son well bless God they shouldn't do
[49:43] that you you you you've heard all those
[49:46] we don't have to go into
[49:48] that now verse four and his Brethren saw
[49:51] that the father loved him more than all
[49:53] the other Brethren now now there the
[49:56] father was there's a reason why he did
[49:58] it was because of his old age and they
[50:00] hated him and could not speak peaceably
[50:02] onto him now watch this now you say well
[50:05] bless God that don't happen many many
[50:08] times in the bride of Christ if God does
[50:10] anything in somebody's life if God other
[50:13] people would be jealous of it if if uh
[50:17] we be jealous that somebody plays the
[50:20] piano better than me I can't play it all
[50:22] I'm somebody speaks in tongues
[50:25] well everybody wants to be by him
[50:26] because he spoke tongues if if uh they
[50:29] preach like an
[50:32] angel well I wish I could Minister just
[50:34] like them I wished I could too but I'd
[50:36] be a clown if I did yeah that's what the
[50:38] prophet said you see what I mean we're
[50:41] because we think that Jesus as soon as
[50:44] Jesus blessed somebody in the body all
[50:47] the other brothers and sisters will go
[50:49] why it wasn't me well it wasn't me how
[50:51] come he didn't use me I've been in the
[50:52] church longer than they were
[50:56] yeah bless God I I live you know bless
[51:00] God I I
[51:06] I and Joseph Dream here's where the
[51:09] problem goes God started using them and
[51:12] Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to
[51:14] his brother oh he shouldn't have done
[51:16] that that was a
[51:19] mistake and they hated
[51:22] him bless God don't ever tell somebody
[51:25] you're called to the ministry if your
[51:27] brother cuz everybody here will hate
[51:30] you well bless God who do you think you
[51:33] are why I knew I knew you I like we're
[51:37] not born of
[51:39] fornication why we knew father
[51:44] [Music]
[51:48] Moses
[51:50] wow you're always a Target if you do
[51:52] something for God but why does Satan get
[51:55] the ability to work through the brother
[51:56] Brothers on and the
[51:59] sisters
[52:01] ouch ouch I've wore that t-shirt in the
[52:04] past and I got whooped for
[52:06] it
[52:10] amen J I need water
[52:16] sorry Hallelujah and they hated him yet
[52:19] the more I don't have a cup or nothing
[52:22] I'm I'm homeless and they hated him all
[52:25] the more
[52:29] for his dreams and for his
[52:32] words and he told it to his father and
[52:35] to his Brethren and even his father
[52:37] rebuked him now that wouldn't happen of
[52:38] our heavenly father we know
[52:41] that and he said unto him what is this
[52:44] dream that thou has dreamed shall I and
[52:47] thy mother and thy Brethren indeed come
[52:50] and bow down thyself to thee to the
[52:52] Earth see you know brother Brown said
[52:54] and and now this is a bad type here say
[52:56] our heavenly father would have never
[52:58] done that on a spiritual basis but
[53:01] brother Brown said that the hardest
[53:03] thing God ever did watch this I want to
[53:06] show you example if any person stood up
[53:09] here and prophesied half the people
[53:10] wouldn't believe it it wasn't
[53:14] me if somebody else got up and I don't
[53:17] care who it was could be the could be
[53:20] anybody and spoke in tongues and
[53:22] somebody else interpret said I don't
[53:24] believe it cuz it wasn't the people I
[53:25] thought it should be
[53:28] brother Braham said the hardest thing
[53:29] God ever did was to get somebody to
[53:32] believe that he'd use somebody else to
[53:35] do his
[53:36] glory well I didn't get I I I I would
[53:40] have picked I would have picked Junior
[53:42] instead
[53:43] of jarid or I would
[53:45] have but God never asked
[53:49] us amen
[53:57] and his Brethren now we get back on
[54:00] track here in verse
[54:02] 11 and his
[54:04] Brethren envied
[54:07] him just think
[54:10] spiritual just think spiritual you know
[54:12] the only way they could envy him is if
[54:14] they were in a
[54:17] competition but if anybody's building a
[54:20] kingdom of their own is going to fall
[54:21] down cuz every kingdom is going to fall
[54:23] down okay we might like some people's
[54:26] kingdom
[54:28] but they're all going to crumble except
[54:30] God's his word alone will last for
[54:33] eternity and they have on him but his
[54:36] father now here we get back on track but
[54:38] the heavenly father he just looked out
[54:40] over his
[54:42] kids W were my family ever
[54:47] different
[54:48] amen now I got six kids and they as far
[54:52] as the East is from the West
[54:59] how in the world is that possible well
[55:02] you know it might be because God is a
[55:04] god of variety but we're
[55:08] not but we're not because I'm me and I
[55:12] like me and I have to love me and so I'm
[55:15] not a god of righty but God is
[55:22] Elohim and it was impossible for God to
[55:25] put all of himself in me me or in you so
[55:28] he had to make a flower garden and make
[55:31] it
[55:32] beautiful but we don't like the garden
[55:35] I'd never do it like that I fire that
[55:37] landscaper but this is
[55:40] God Amen and the Brethren envied him but
[55:44] the father observed the
[55:46] saying verse 14 and he said to him go ye
[55:50] I pray thee and see whether it is well
[55:52] with thy Brethren now here's God sending
[55:54] out his Brethren to to to to take to
[55:58] look check on the
[55:59] family there's nothing wrong with that
[56:01] is
[56:02] there of course not and well with the
[56:05] flocks and he bring me a word again so
[56:07] he sent them out to Horeb and he came to
[56:12] these PE this town here let's jump to
[56:14] verse
[56:16] 18 and when they saw him AAR off now
[56:19] remember this wasn't the
[56:22] father and when his family his brothers
[56:25] and sisters now it talks about brothers
[56:27] here but in the end of the chapter it
[56:29] talks about sisters also they saw him a
[56:33] far off and be Fame he came near to them
[56:35] they started talking behind his
[56:40] back and they started conspiracizing
[56:42] against
[56:44] him to kill his
[56:48] character and they said one to another
[56:50] behold this wild Minister
[56:54] cometh and he cometh down before us let
[56:57] us slay him and cast him into some pit
[56:59] and we'll say that some evil beasts and
[57:02] one of his brothers that was the Deacon
[57:05] stopped up and said whoa no no no we
[57:07] can't we can't have innocent
[57:12] blood verse 22 how do you say that
[57:15] brother's name H Ru reuben reuben it
[57:18] said unto them shed no blood but cast
[57:22] them into the pit for in the wilderness
[57:25] and lay no hand upon him that he we
[57:27] might be rid of him out of our hands and
[57:29] deliver him to his father again and it
[57:30] came to pass that Joseph came unto his
[57:33] Brethren and they stripped Joseph's foot
[57:35] of his coat and many colors that was
[57:38] upon him in verse 24 and they took
[57:41] him and they cast him into the pit and
[57:43] the pit was empty and there was no water
[57:45] in
[57:46] it verse
[57:50] 26 Judah said unto the Brethren what
[57:54] profited us if we play this brother
[57:57] let's sell him for some money money is a
[58:00] great
[58:01] thing unless you worship
[58:03] it and conceal his blood and come let us
[58:07] sell him to these people that are coming
[58:09] by these way
[58:12] pasts and let not our hand be upon him
[58:15] they were justifying that they were
[58:17] going to sell him and put into slavery
[58:21] and they were saying now we're more
[58:22] Christian because we actually didn't
[58:24] kill them
[58:26] yeah
[58:27] wow we just
[58:32] like no think spiritual
[58:38] now amen let's just jump to 31 I'm going
[58:42] to jump here some you know the
[58:44] story and they took Joseph's
[58:47] coat and see insinuating the LIE is the
[58:51] same as a
[58:54] lie and they insist insuated that he had
[58:57] been killed with
[58:58] the they killed goats and they put his
[59:00] blood on it and they insinuated to Jacob
[59:02] they ran and he rent his clothes and
[59:05] sasos and his laurs and he mourned for
[59:07] his sons for days and all now now watch
[59:10] this verse 35 this is where I want you
[59:12] get and all Jacob's sons and all his
[59:20] daughters we're in on
[59:23] it because they rose up to comfort
[59:27] him but he refused to be comforted and
[59:29] he said unto them for I will go down
[59:33] into the grave unto my son still
[59:38] mourning and thus the
[59:41] father
[59:44] wept that's why we're still
[59:47] here and why God's still
[59:50] weeping you see if we had found the last
[59:54] seed we're going going
[59:59] home and I I I have a a many many things
[1:00:03] here but you know like I said we're not
[1:00:06] talking about letting you you don't gain
[1:00:09] Nothing by letting sin in the church you
[1:00:12] don't let nothing you don't gain Nothing
[1:00:14] by becoming a sinner and think you're
[1:00:15] serving God that that don't happen
[1:00:19] that's not serving
[1:00:21] God okay so we're not talking about that
[1:00:25] we're not we're not like not preaching
[1:00:27] the word of God so everybody will come
[1:00:28] to our church and just play basketball
[1:00:30] and have a ball team and we can play all
[1:00:33] the other churches and I'm not talking
[1:00:34] about that but if your brother Falls and
[1:00:39] stumbles it's not your
[1:00:42] business other than
[1:00:45] prayer it's not your business at
[1:00:49] all because they will stumble and
[1:00:53] fall amen
[1:00:59] see we're not here to let the bars down
[1:01:03] and let the goats
[1:01:05] in but there's
[1:01:08] goats and we're not here to judge
[1:01:11] them cuz how can you tell the
[1:01:14] goat oh I know I know I know you're
[1:01:17] going to stick to that scripture by your
[1:01:18] fruits you'll know them but just hang on
[1:01:20] here for a
[1:01:21] minute just hang with me he said you
[1:01:24] know and the the statue of the perfect
[1:01:26] man and that just happens to be a uh in
[1:01:29] the word of God in our Prophet Minister
[1:01:31] that
[1:01:32] kindness is under brotherly
[1:01:36] love and it will take
[1:01:39] kindness and
[1:01:41] Revelation for
[1:01:43] anybody to find the last predestinated
[1:01:47] seed let me repeat
[1:01:49] that we haven't found the last
[1:01:52] predestinated seed because we haven't
[1:01:54] showed kindness
[1:01:57] and
[1:01:58] Revelation to find the last
[1:02:00] predestinated
[1:02:02] seed see you have to watch this now
[1:02:05] watch this I this lines up
[1:02:07] beautifully by your fruits you will know
[1:02:09] them but the last predestinated seed
[1:02:12] that ain't come in don't have no fruits
[1:02:14] of
[1:02:16] Christianity they're still living in Sin
[1:02:21] Sin
[1:02:22] n so we can judge them all we want and
[1:02:26] we'll never have a
[1:02:27] Rapture because it will take kindness
[1:02:30] and understanding to share the
[1:02:32] Revelation to him because the Bible says
[1:02:35] that a soul offended is harder to win
[1:02:37] back than a walled
[1:02:39] City so go ahead you can be right but
[1:02:43] don't plan on a
[1:02:44] Rapture your grandkids won't go in the
[1:02:50] Rapture you would hold the door at a
[1:02:52] grocery store for a total stranger
[1:02:54] that's may be in a bad community
[1:02:58] but you'd go out an opposite door at
[1:03:00] church because you don't want to speak
[1:03:02] to
[1:03:04] oh
[1:03:06] ouch watch
[1:03:10] this I'm going to say something here and
[1:03:13] it's going to hurt just a little bit the
[1:03:15] prophet said
[1:03:17] that and I'm going to read a whole thing
[1:03:20] of rap before he died where he explained
[1:03:23] it all of so we're still
[1:03:26] here because we enjoy living under the
[1:03:34] law let me rephrase that we're still
[1:03:38] here because we enjoy living under
[1:03:44] law now now I want to just clarify
[1:03:46] something here if you want law you got
[1:03:49] the right Pastor because I never went
[1:03:51] out to eat on Sunday I never bought gas
[1:03:53] on Sunday I never rode a bike on Sunday
[1:03:55] I never played catch with the ball on
[1:03:57] Sunday we went to church twice on Sunday
[1:03:59] had an afternoon nap and we basically
[1:04:01] never warmed our food because we
[1:04:03] reverence the Sabbath day so much so if
[1:04:07] you want law like praise God I know all
[1:04:09] about
[1:04:13] law and our Prophet said that when
[1:04:16] Christ came the Jews loved the sacrifice
[1:04:21] of lambs and goats better that would not
[1:04:24] take away their sin sins and they
[1:04:27] rejected Christ the perfect sacrifice
[1:04:31] because they
[1:04:33] loved the
[1:04:36] law
[1:04:39] whoa I'm like you got to be
[1:04:43] kidding they love the
[1:04:46] law now don't go into the cornfield
[1:04:49] until you wash your hands three times
[1:04:50] and don't pick the cob on Sunday because
[1:04:52] you'll get killed because it's Sunday
[1:04:54] and and so you just fast today because
[1:04:56] if you didn't pick it on do you know I
[1:04:58] want to just show you something about
[1:05:00] you want to be legalistic when my dad
[1:05:03] fed
[1:05:04] cattle we pitched the inlets down under
[1:05:07] of the Salo us Sons us
[1:05:10] boys and we never ever pitched it down
[1:05:12] on Sunday we Saturday night we pitched
[1:05:15] down extra for Sunday and fed the cattle
[1:05:17] on Saturday night so we didn't feed them
[1:05:19] on
[1:05:20] Sunday you want legalistic come on right
[1:05:23] over to my Camp I'll tell you all about
[1:05:25] it
[1:05:31] oh yeah my dad would almost let the
[1:05:33] cattle go hungry before he would start
[1:05:35] an engine of a tractor on the
[1:05:37] Sabbath because he felt he was killing
[1:05:48] God I can also remember when we came
[1:05:50] into the message this fantastic truth in
[1:05:54] Wallaceburg Church and the first family
[1:05:57] that invited us out for Sunday dinner
[1:06:00] and that was am miracle and itself they
[1:06:02] loved us tremendously because we had a
[1:06:04] whole herd of
[1:06:06] kids and when we were coming into their
[1:06:09] home they stopped in town and went in to
[1:06:11] buy some food and we almost left the
[1:06:13] message at that
[1:06:24] time but there's no way a Believer buys
[1:06:26] something on
[1:06:30] Sunday Jewish
[1:06:32] law Matthew 161 171 18 and Jesus
[1:06:35] answered unto them blessed art thou
[1:06:36] Simon by Jonah for Flesh and Blood the
[1:06:40] fivefold ministry never even it was the
[1:06:42] spirit on the five for Ministry the
[1:06:45] Evangelist never for Flesh and Blood
[1:06:47] never revealed this unto you but my
[1:06:49] Father which is in heaven and I and he
[1:06:53] said unto thee that thou Peter and Upon
[1:06:56] This Rock now what did I say I said it
[1:06:59] would take kindness and
[1:07:02] Revelation it won't take brother Ben
[1:07:04] norrod coming to preach it won't take
[1:07:08] and like he would be number one
[1:07:10] evangelist in my
[1:07:12] thoughts but it'll take
[1:07:14] kindness and
[1:07:17] Revelation for the last predestinated
[1:07:19] seed to be
[1:07:20] saved now see so this is how we have to
[1:07:24] understand this scenario if you as
[1:07:27] you're not if you are a Believer and
[1:07:29] you're living in sin then you're not a
[1:07:31] Believer so when when you say you've let
[1:07:34] the goats down and let all the bars in
[1:07:36] let's look at it like this brother Brown
[1:07:38] said the church is a hospital this place
[1:07:42] should be right full of
[1:07:44] goats I don't mean we're condoning to
[1:07:46] them goats but they come for they come
[1:07:49] for an IV called Revelation they came
[1:07:53] for an IV of kindness brother Brown said
[1:07:55] you remember this one he said the
[1:07:57] world's Dying For
[1:07:59] Love they're dying for real love
[1:08:02] compassion I'm suffering I'm homeless
[1:08:04] I'm I I can't pay my
[1:08:07] rent I can't gas up the
[1:08:11] car I'll just tell you what the economy
[1:08:14] is
[1:08:14] tight my wife was bringing me up to
[1:08:17] reality
[1:08:19] yesterday and it was quite a
[1:08:23] jar said I grew too much hate enough
[1:08:25] soybeans and spent too much money on the
[1:08:34] church
[1:08:36] amen see Upon This Rock of Revelation
[1:08:40] I'll build my church and the Gates of
[1:08:42] Hell won't Prevail against it see how
[1:08:44] what God has shown us is the father any
[1:08:48] one of you brother M you're not worried
[1:08:49] about any one of your three different
[1:08:50] kids Jared you're not you got be like
[1:08:52] you realize your kids brother Bernard
[1:08:55] you're not you realize your boy and your
[1:08:56] girl they're they're children you you
[1:08:58] don't expect them to be well yours are
[1:09:00] almost Angels but you know what I mean
[1:09:03] like no child will make
[1:09:05] mistakes if you like if you like a
[1:09:08] molasses cookie your mom and dad might
[1:09:11] told you not to take a molasses cookie
[1:09:13] but if you like a nice Amy molasses
[1:09:15] cookie as much as I do you might
[1:09:17] consider going to hell for that
[1:09:20] cookie if you're a
[1:09:23] child we just understand that but the
[1:09:27] children don't that's why they go daddy
[1:09:29] daddy Isaiah took a cookie daddy daddy
[1:09:33] you you made me do it wasn't the father
[1:09:35] that said
[1:09:36] it wasn't the father that said
[1:09:39] it it was their
[1:09:42] brothers that's right and their
[1:09:44] sisters when our kids used to come to me
[1:09:48] it was never I did it she made me like I
[1:09:52] believe that Doctrine came from the
[1:09:54] garden yeah
[1:09:55] yeah amen he made me do it she made me
[1:10:00] you caught me but I wasn't me I was
[1:10:02] getting it for them meanwhile there's
[1:10:04] crumbs falling out of their
[1:10:07] mouth amen see how it is so when the
[1:10:11] goats come in Among Us brother Brown
[1:10:14] said the inner core of this group you
[1:10:16] know who you are you don't have to have
[1:10:18] a good preacher tell you God told you
[1:10:20] this morning who you are you're part of
[1:10:22] him you came for him for the foundation
[1:10:24] of the world you you know you're a
[1:10:25] Believer you're not saved because I tell
[1:10:28] you you're saved you're saved because
[1:10:29] God told you you're saved amen and so
[1:10:32] the core of the group hold together and
[1:10:34] support one another in the center of the
[1:10:36] word of God and the goats are around us
[1:10:38] and they're looking at our life and they
[1:10:39] go whoa nobody said anything about
[1:10:42] sisters having long hair but I feel like
[1:10:45] mine's really
[1:10:47] short and nobody had to go
[1:10:51] reker you know you're covered I don't
[1:10:54] want you to see anything
[1:10:56] amen and and I don't need to have
[1:10:58] spandex pants I mean my goodness woo
[1:11:01] when me and brother Carson were gone a
[1:11:03] couple days wow elasticity has become
[1:11:06] very
[1:11:08] valuable just
[1:11:13] glued but going in
[1:11:16] amen Jesus told him he said I father I
[1:11:19] pray thee that you would leave them in
[1:11:22] the world this is our ke sker but we're
[1:11:25] not going to become a
[1:11:27] goat but we have no right to judge the
[1:11:30] goats cuz some are born to
[1:11:32] damnation and some are the Jezebel on
[1:11:35] the wall that haven't received the light
[1:11:37] yet amen and Believe
[1:11:41] Me Brother Dale wants to get off this
[1:11:43] subject we got to move on and just we
[1:11:47] you you think think I never
[1:11:50] study my dad used to say this now I I
[1:11:54] can only tell you what I know
[1:11:56] you know in quiet days and all the work
[1:11:59] was done we used to go crop
[1:12:03] turn now in high school they went crop
[1:12:05] turn CU they were going drinking I'm not
[1:12:07] talking about that we just go crop turn
[1:12:10] and normally my dad would take us over
[1:12:11] to walpool island or some place where he
[1:12:13] combined corn when it was minus 50° and
[1:12:17] mom wouldn't go cuz she was afraid of
[1:12:20] going to wpo Island and stuff like that
[1:12:23] and and we' go crop turn and my daddy
[1:12:26] would say this and this would be a good
[1:12:28] Logic for our church he'd look at
[1:12:31] something he'd look at you brother
[1:12:33] Junior and he
[1:12:36] goes he'd say many men have many
[1:12:39] Minds just leave it there he say like
[1:12:43] there' be somebody building something in
[1:12:45] the wrong place or planting crop or they
[1:12:47] were in the field like this would be a
[1:12:48] good one they were in the field and it
[1:12:49] was too wet he's like oh he don't know
[1:12:53] what he's doing he said many men has
[1:12:56] many minds and he just left it like that
[1:13:00] if you want to be a goat we can all eat
[1:13:02] hay together but I'm a
[1:13:04] sheep I'm producing wool come on right
[1:13:07] up to the manger get a little bit of
[1:13:09] wool if you get the right hay you you
[1:13:11] might start your hair might start
[1:13:12] falling out and it might start getting
[1:13:14] oily and there might wo start
[1:13:17] coming
[1:13:19] amen so you know the amazing thing is we
[1:13:21] don't have to rebuke
[1:13:23] somebody to stay on the the
[1:13:25] word because we only oursel individually
[1:13:29] have to stay on the word now now you as
[1:13:32] Believers have the right and the
[1:13:33] opportunity and the the free choice
[1:13:36] brother Brown said you should choose a
[1:13:38] home church that is on the word and you
[1:13:41] choose a home church that you feel
[1:13:42] comfortable with and you choose a whole
[1:13:45] church that the pastor ain't a hypocrite
[1:13:47] and you choose a home Church where he's
[1:13:49] not a wolf in cheap
[1:13:51] [Applause]
[1:13:52] clothing I'm not saying to to the church
[1:13:54] where the the pastor is either a liar or
[1:13:57] a hypocrite you have that right to
[1:14:00] choose that's right but you don't have
[1:14:01] to tell me about
[1:14:03] it but you don't have to tell your
[1:14:04] brother and sister about it cuz brother
[1:14:06] Brown said if somebody else chooses
[1:14:07] another home Church don't disfellowship
[1:14:10] with them just love them and come into
[1:14:12] one big circle and say praise God I love
[1:14:14] going to Wyoming but if you go somewhere
[1:14:16] else you go to Paula Paula Fontaine has
[1:14:19] people right from a town not very far
[1:14:21] from here going to his church praise God
[1:14:23] paon is my friend
[1:14:27] amen if you go to the Baptist Church
[1:14:29] outside of town or any other church you
[1:14:31] can think of that you knows even off the
[1:14:33] word say praise God I'll be your friend
[1:14:35] and I pray that God will give you a
[1:14:38] revelation I'm not
[1:14:41] there you know brother Brown said if you
[1:14:43] know I encourage you go visit every
[1:14:45] Church in the world go travel and if you
[1:14:48] get a seed you don't have to eat the
[1:14:50] seed just spit it out and just say you
[1:14:55] you don't have that's not your home
[1:14:57] church now if you were spitting a lot of
[1:14:59] seeds out in your home
[1:15:03] Church you might want to pray about that
[1:15:06] one but if you go out amongst you know
[1:15:09] none of you are going to catch leprosy
[1:15:11] even if you went to the Baptist Church
[1:15:13] one Sunday praise God when you come back
[1:15:16] here the next Sunday you'd be
[1:15:18] like that's right for all God shown
[1:15:22] me I'm not afraid of you going there you
[1:15:25] go wherever you want if I if I didn't
[1:15:27] trust you I didn't trust God I didn't
[1:15:29] trust the Holy
[1:15:31] Ghost amen I trust the holy ghost man go
[1:15:34] wherever you want I like I go to my
[1:15:36] brother at the Holiness Church I'll go
[1:15:38] there for Revival and I'm their friend
[1:15:40] they asked me to pray the last time I
[1:15:41] was there can you believe
[1:15:44] that I'm not a
[1:15:48] trinitarian

[1:18:31] the goats don't say nothing I won't say
[1:18:33] nothing to them either I will avoid
[1:18:36] dealing with it you know how A God
[1:18:38] Called Ministry tries to do something he
[1:18:40] tries not to follow the word and God
[1:18:43] just goes oh no you don't get back over
[1:18:46] here you were trying to avoid that
[1:18:49] subject I'm like okay God are you sure
[1:18:53] you know what you're doing God
[1:18:55] can you believe God listening to some
[1:18:57] Minister like are you sure you know what
[1:18:58] you're doing
[1:19:00] God God's up there oh
[1:19:03] boys that's like you telling your
[1:19:05] 2-year-old kid not to walk out in front
[1:19:07] of 401 are you sure you know what you're
[1:19:08] doing dad you know we were having a kid
[1:19:10] riding with us not that long ago and
[1:19:12] they lived in our house down the road
[1:19:14] and we were telling them to put on their
[1:19:15] seat Bel now that would be a positive
[1:19:16] thing besides that it's a law of the
[1:19:18] land and you know what the kid told us
[1:19:20] he said me be careful when I go out
[1:19:22] through the
[1:19:23] window now I I want to tell you how
[1:19:25] would a kid be careful going out through
[1:19:26] the front window brother
[1:19:30] Matt me be
[1:19:34] careful you see that's like we telling
[1:19:37] God be careful God don't Don't Preach
[1:19:38] too hard those goats will leave and
[1:19:41] God's like oh just shut up and put your
[1:19:43] seat Bel
[1:19:49] on just put your seat butt on here comes
[1:19:53] the word here's another one you know if
[1:19:56] you're a born again Christian you'll
[1:19:58] forget your differences and come
[1:19:59] together as Christians ought to and you
[1:20:01] and and we will we can do something our
[1:20:04] King will come to us Jesus
[1:20:07] Christ now how can we be unified if we
[1:20:11] have differences just forget them just
[1:20:13] say many men has many Minds for me I
[1:20:16] can't do that in my house do you know we
[1:20:18] we watched them the minister on and he
[1:20:20] was mentioning about Christmas and he
[1:20:22] said I do something for Christmas but
[1:20:24] you have to get your own Revelation for
[1:20:25] Christmas what does God want for your
[1:20:28] family I'll preach what the word is I'd
[1:20:31] have to preach both sides of it I'll
[1:20:34] preach what the Bible says I might be
[1:20:36] more
[1:20:37] one-sided but God will deal with you see
[1:20:41] a minister just throws out the net yes
[1:20:44] and if there's goats in it I don't get
[1:20:45] upset I say praise God maybe the goat
[1:20:48] grow
[1:20:49] will you know now they got sheep that
[1:20:51] grow hair and you don't have to shave
[1:20:53] them
[1:20:54] they're in the modern
[1:20:57] Church you see you know what I mean like
[1:21:00] God's omnipotent you don't have to worry
[1:21:02] about God you don't you don't like you
[1:21:05] just have to put your seat belt
[1:21:06] on and we tell God are you sure you want
[1:21:09] me to preach that God I'll be careful
[1:21:11] when I go through the window
[1:21:14] shield amen if there's anything that I
[1:21:16] believe in that would be to start a
[1:21:18] Revival in Los Angeles it would be it
[1:21:20] would be a time that we could all break
[1:21:23] down our differences and barriers and
[1:21:25] come together as Christians in love
[1:21:27] that's the Pentecostal Baptist and
[1:21:31] Presbyterians and allog together and we
[1:21:33] could experience a world that we would
[1:21:35] have love one for the other now they
[1:21:37] would be as different as the night is
[1:21:38] from the day and our Prophet wasn't any
[1:21:40] of the three above amen watch this in
[1:21:43] Hebrews he says let us consider one
[1:21:45] another and provoke unto love Hebrews
[1:21:48] 10:24 and 25 you can pull that up
[1:21:50] provoke unto love and good works I'm
[1:21:52] trying to hurry so I don't preach on
[1:21:53] this the rest of my life
[1:21:55] not forsaking the assembling of yourself
[1:21:57] together now you know the reason we
[1:21:59] don't get together is because we're
[1:22:01] worried about what the other person's
[1:22:02] doing it don't matter if your brother's
[1:22:05] here or your sister's here or not here
[1:22:07] it's it's it's on
[1:22:09] them it go it all goes back to they have
[1:22:12] to work out their own salvation God has
[1:22:14] to give them a revelation of attending
[1:22:16] church if they think they can sit on the
[1:22:18] coach and watch a video well we know
[1:22:21] it's on scriptural but that's between
[1:22:23] them and God maybe they like going to
[1:22:26] hell I know that shocked you brother
[1:22:28] Bown said if you go to hell you will
[1:22:30] pass every deter sign and fight your way
[1:22:33] to get
[1:22:35] there and how will be full of people
[1:22:38] fighting to get there does brother Dale
[1:22:40] understand that oh Bud hey you got to be
[1:22:44] kidding not even
[1:22:48] close amen some of yourself exhorting
[1:22:51] one another exhorting one another not
[1:22:53] judging one another another I'm going to
[1:22:55] get to the judging part I got even some
[1:22:57] Bible for it you it's it's amazing what
[1:23:00] the Bible says exhorting one another and
[1:23:04] so much more as you see the time
[1:23:06] approaching you know what if you believe
[1:23:07] that we're going in a Rapture soon you

[1:25:55] come in last will get the same portion
[1:25:57] as the ones that come in first you know

[1:27:54] that case that we're fighting it wasn't
[1:27:56] father God father God loved both of them
[1:28:00] equally father God did whatever it took
[1:28:03] he didn't father God didn't have to grab
[1:28:05] the older one the older one had more
[1:28:08] ability father God he had everything

[1:28:59] makes them a family man but we don't
[1:29:00] know which ones in the world aren't
[1:29:02] still
[1:29:03] his so God ain't praying for the god
[1:29:06] ain't praying for the the ones that are
[1:29:07] born to to to to uh to
[1:29:11] damnation but there's ones that are
[1:29:13] headed to damnation that are
[1:29:14] predestinated to eternal life and you'd
[1:29:18] better not be judging them or you're
[1:29:19] judging God Amen for all that you've
[1:29:22] given me the family for they are mine
[1:29:24] even though they don't look like it yet
[1:29:26] now I'm not condoning backsliding or or
[1:29:28] not coming to God late I'm not condoning
[1:29:31] that I'm just saying this is part of his
[1:29:33] plan for all are mine are thine and
[1:29:36] thine are mine and I
[1:29:39] glorify I am glorified in them and
[1:29:42] neither I pray thee alone verse 20
[1:29:45] neither I pray thee alone for those
[1:29:48] alone but for those also which now
[1:29:52] there's a key part here this is Bible
[1:29:54] which which shall that means they
[1:29:57] haven't
[1:30:00] yet oh bless God they're not living
[1:30:04] right of course they're not living right
[1:30:06] because they haven't believed yet but

[1:30:15] version well bless God I have a child
[1:30:18] that ain't right but he
[1:30:21] shall and if he and if you don't believe

[1:30:25] just backside yourself because you don't
[1:30:27] even believe your own conversion I watch

[1:31:08] believe that thou Hast sent me and the
[1:31:10] glory which I Gest me I gave unto them

[1:33:53] you that's right amen and but the woman
[1:33:57] is of the man so we came from our
[1:33:59] heavenly father now that shouldn't mean
[1:34:01] we're going to act like him neither was
[1:34:03] the Man created for the woman God wasn't
[1:34:07] created for you to be
[1:34:09] born God was there first do you see but
[1:34:13] the woman for the man were created to
[1:34:15] worship God God made us to worship Him
[1:34:19] adore
[1:34:20] him and of course obey him but that's
[1:34:23] part of adoring you don't have to you
[1:34:25] don't have to have law when somebody's
[1:34:27] adoring
[1:34:28] somebody and for this C all a mother to
[1:34:31] woman to
[1:34:32] leave have or sorry for and for this
[1:34:36] cause ought a woman to have power on her
[1:34:39] head because of the
[1:34:40] Angels God isn't from
[1:34:44] us but we're from God and we were
[1:34:47] created by God not great God created for
[1:34:51] us God was always
[1:34:54] ver and here we go verse 15 but if a
[1:34:58] woman have long hair it is a glory that
[1:35:01] God gave her for her hair is a covering
[1:35:05] you know we we can only approach god
[1:35:07] with humility brother Brown said if you
[1:35:10] want anything from God it's your
[1:35:12] approach your approach
[1:35:15] humility amen God help
[1:35:17] us God help us I want to just skip
[1:35:20] something here and oh
[1:35:24] maybe not we're we're doing is that we
[1:35:25] doing all right I'm sorry I'll preach
[1:35:27] half as long next week you
[1:35:32] please wellow you you know people that
[1:35:34] don't have nothing to preach they can
[1:35:35] preach a short message I could make this
[1:35:36] three messages I wouldn't have to study
[1:35:38] for a
[1:35:40] month but when God gives it to you I
[1:35:42] don't have to study I just have to find
[1:35:44] it it's just
[1:35:46] like I said wait God I got to find it
[1:35:48] I'll
[1:35:51] forget here brother brand and questions
[1:35:53] answer I'm going to prayer phrase some
[1:35:54] of this now like I'm trying to be
[1:35:56] balanced I'm trying to be balanced I'm
[1:35:59] not
[1:36:00] compromising I don't believe with watch
[1:36:03] this without Holiness no man shall see
[1:36:05] God that's right okay so that's the full
[1:36:09] word of God but there's a part here
[1:36:11] that's been sidestepped and God's trying
[1:36:13] to get his brothers and sisters to not
[1:36:15] fight the problem ain't with God it's
[1:36:17] with the brothers and with the sisters
[1:36:19] and I'm
[1:36:20] roasting but here here in questions and
[1:36:24] answers some people came and asked
[1:36:26] brother brandham if if people that well
[1:36:28] let me just read it is that all right 1
[1:36:30] Corinthians 14 34 and 35 he said let a
[1:36:34] woman be silent in the churches and
[1:36:35] they're not permitted so they're they're
[1:36:37] asking it's shameful for a woman to do
[1:36:39] anything do you know I I do you
[1:36:43] know we're funny
[1:36:49] creatures why do we got to beat somebody
[1:36:51] down to raise oursel up you want to help
[1:36:53] me get my coat off CU I got a string
[1:36:56] around my
[1:36:57] neck uh and don't rip my cord
[1:37:03] of
[1:37:07] uh and here they're trying to say you
[1:37:12] sisters you'd better not say
[1:37:18] Amen you're kidding
[1:37:21] me we probably wouldn't have have any
[1:37:23] amens if the sisters never said amen
[1:37:25] once
[1:37:27] in Now You sisters don't you dare
[1:37:31] prophesy cuz we're
[1:37:37] male that's not
[1:37:39] God there is one thing placing that a
[1:37:43] sister was out a sister can you know I
[1:37:47] I'm I'm telling you this is this is a
[1:37:49] fresh I have un unfriended and blocked
[1:37:52] people that had sisters sing a special
[1:37:54] behind this
[1:37:55] Pulpit are you kidding we could bring up
[1:37:58] a donkey and sing a special behind this
[1:38:03] Pulpit the Bible said that if the Rocks
[1:38:05] would cry out let's move the ppet to the
[1:38:08] parking lot who can't serve god well the
[1:38:12] kids are too young to sing who
[1:38:16] cares well they might make a mistake
[1:38:18] praise God I'll feel more
[1:38:22] comfortable you see right that's not
[1:38:25] God's
[1:38:26] Church a woman can worship praise God
[1:38:29] get blessed run the aisles prophesy
[1:38:32] speak in tongues worship sing a
[1:38:36] special preach to her children Oh I
[1:38:40] thought you thought I was going to get
[1:38:41] you there preach to the
[1:38:43] sisters the older sisters guide and help
[1:38:46] the younger sisters tell them how to
[1:38:48] love their husbands and keep a house
[1:38:51] clean drive the car slow when the
[1:38:53] husband ain't there cuz he might not
[1:38:55] have enough money to buy the next
[1:39:00] one and when he's a loggerhead don't say
[1:39:04] nothing cuz it'll lower his
[1:39:07] Eagle I know you sisters do that all the
[1:39:09] time L man just he's oh he's going off
[1:39:12] on that road again bless God he'll come
[1:39:15] back when he falls off the
[1:39:17] cliff amen bless God I'll be squealing
[1:39:22] amen you sisters have an amazing
[1:39:25] gift I I just I just think something in
[1:39:28] my mouth opens like you went shopping
[1:39:31] without me I think she's going to buy
[1:39:33] three
[1:39:36] dresses why do we got to be we got to be
[1:39:40] we're control
[1:39:43] freaks it's okay say amen amen we're
[1:39:46] control
[1:39:49] freaks amen no no now we haven't sinned
[1:39:52] yet we're still right in the center of
[1:39:54] the word and so here that was the watch
[1:39:58] the motive
[1:39:59] behind this question of brother Brown
[1:40:01] now this is a 64 question so this is not
[1:40:03] un old question but the motive was we
[1:40:06] don't have room for sisters we're just
[1:40:08] going to have brothers in the church
[1:40:12] yeah oh
[1:40:14] buddy that that's that's a whole
[1:40:17] different world but anyway let's go to
[1:40:20] his answer he said now now I'm going to
[1:40:23] read this part and now remember this is
[1:40:25] our
[1:40:27] prophet and he was balanced and he was
[1:40:30] Vindicated and he went on the other side
[1:40:32] of the road too like to balance it you
[1:40:35] know what I'm saying but I I can't
[1:40:36] preach the whole message in one hour I'm
[1:40:39] trying to but but this is just one
[1:40:42] portion next Sunday I'll preach the
[1:40:44] other side of the
[1:40:45] road okay so and then somewhere in this
[1:40:49] by a miracle of the foolishness of
[1:40:50] preaching we'll maybe be balanced yeah
[1:40:54] we will be if God's in it he said now
[1:40:57] you are this is a real hard question and
[1:41:00] I can only answer it to the best that I
[1:41:02] know how and now I could not
[1:41:07] judge wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[1:41:12] minute brother Bram he had
[1:41:15] Visions God showed him what was going to
[1:41:17] happen in the
[1:41:18] future wait a minute brother Brandon
[1:41:23] he says I could not
[1:41:25] judge wait a minute this was a Bible
[1:41:28] question this was a Bible question it's
[1:41:30] about sisters speaking in tongues in the
[1:41:32] church because they're supposed to shut
[1:41:34] up everywhere they go just shut up and
[1:41:37] follow me I don't want to be married to
[1:41:38] you bless holy smokes you can see why
[1:41:42] you need a rebel you sisters that aren't
[1:41:44] married you could be blessed by Jehovah
[1:41:47] being
[1:41:48] single you could be married to a
[1:41:51] loggerhead like brother Dale
[1:41:56] amen I'm trying to make a point there's
[1:41:58] a reason for everything would you rather
[1:42:00] be in bondage trapped by the law and
[1:42:03] have to follow
[1:42:07] some not me
[1:42:12] H amen I'm
[1:42:21] sorry he said I could not judge because
[1:42:25] I was not sent to
[1:42:28] judge wow now if brother Brenham wasn't
[1:42:32] sent to now he preached against sin
[1:42:34] bless God but here he's saying I wasn't
[1:42:37] sent to judge but I want to judge every
[1:42:38] day oh bless God nobody wore
[1:42:42] nobody I don't like
[1:42:45] your you know what I me oh oh I didn't
[1:42:49] wear a white shirt today oh Purity is
[1:42:52] supposed to be white
[1:42:54] I'm probably preaching off the word I'm
[1:42:57] sorry I got some white shirts at church
[1:43:00] if I remember I'll wear three next
[1:43:03] Sunday he said I wasn't sent to judge
[1:43:06] but I think there's so many times that I
[1:43:08] got another question down here somewhere
[1:43:11] that it goes right along with this with
[1:43:13] that but if a person speaking in tongues
[1:43:15] and they're anointed of God see they may
[1:43:18] be watch this oh you're not going to
[1:43:20] like this I didn't like it either they
[1:43:22] may be oh by the way you can pull that
[1:43:24] up uh skip our scriptures it's on
[1:43:26] Facebook I got it two different
[1:43:28] things it's uh well one that I printed
[1:43:31] off on my from my iPad Vicki so it's not
[1:43:34] highlighted
[1:43:38] uh Yep this is it so I'm right up there
[1:43:46] uh no no no no there's got to be another
[1:43:52] one is there another one let's
[1:43:57] oh M I'm sorry go back to the other
[1:44:03] one no that's that's coming that's
[1:44:06] coming we just we take it down for a
[1:44:08] second that's
[1:44:09] coming sorry but I think there's so many
[1:44:12] times that I got another uh so let me
[1:44:15] Jump Ahead here speaking in tongues and
[1:44:16] they're Anointed God see they may be out
[1:44:18] of order so he's saying the person
[1:44:21] speaking in tongues they may do it out
[1:44:23] of order that may be true and they may
[1:44:26] be doing something that's not
[1:44:29] right it's not right now he's not
[1:44:31] condoning it he's just he's explaining
[1:44:32] the situ that's not right but I wouldn't
[1:44:35] want to say that that wasn't God the
[1:44:39] Holy Spirit now wait a minute he just
[1:44:42] said that they may be out of order and
[1:44:44] they may be doing it
[1:44:46] wrong and he's a word Prophet but he
[1:44:49] wouldn't say they were it wasn't God
[1:44:50] that was leading them
[1:44:53] whoa wait a minute wait a minute that's
[1:44:55] Mass confusion no because I wouldn't
[1:45:00] know see now here now now this this gets
[1:45:04] crazy good now and now there's many
[1:45:07] times that this that people misjudge one
[1:45:14] another and that's real bad thing to do
[1:45:18] you say why she's got oh this is going
[1:45:21] to hurt this is it it just think for a
[1:45:24] little why she's got short
[1:45:27] hair that's not
[1:45:29] scripture I mean if she's cut it it's
[1:45:31] not scriptural if if it's on cut it is
[1:45:35] she may be wearing a dress too short now
[1:45:37] you know that our Prophet preached
[1:45:38] against
[1:45:40] that okay but this is still our Prophet
[1:45:44] like he was on both scenarios and and
[1:45:47] listen we're not promoting modesty
[1:45:50] you're supposed to be modest or you're
[1:45:51] not converted okay but watch how he
[1:45:53] answers this so you she may have too
[1:45:55] short of hair she may be wearing a dress
[1:45:57] too short and
[1:45:58] that's and that's not the Holy Spirit
[1:46:01] upon her okay now it's perfect balance
[1:46:04] so that's wrong but watch how he goes
[1:46:08] don't do that wait wait don't do that
[1:46:12] don't do that that's not right you don't
[1:46:19] know you don't know what's in in that
[1:46:24] woman's
[1:46:25] heart he's talking about don't don't
[1:46:27] judge her he's he's telling the woman
[1:46:29] don't do that but then he says don't do
[1:46:31] that that's not right but don't judge
[1:46:33] her you don't know what's in her heart
[1:46:35] you don't know nothing about it you
[1:46:38] don't know now I say wait a minute I do
[1:46:40] know about it if the woman cut her hair
[1:46:42] not supposed to cut her hair she's
[1:46:44] supposed to be modest but he says you
[1:46:46] know that the Holy Spirit would make her
[1:46:49] condemn herself a little better now
[1:46:53] uh conduct yourself a little better
[1:46:55] sorry uh that may be true but I'll tell
[1:46:58] you as you and I let God now let me
[1:47:03] repeat let
[1:47:04] God let God I've said this before in
[1:47:07] things I don't care what they look like
[1:47:09] when they come in that door if I have
[1:47:10] never seen them before and you have
[1:47:12] never seen them before let God do the
[1:47:17] judging of that and that's you and I
[1:47:21] just pray well that's something I don't
[1:47:23] want to do cuz that's boring when we
[1:47:26] pray like there's no excitement there's
[1:47:28] no sometimes there a't you see that's
[1:47:32] how we're like Hollywood he said you and
[1:47:35] I just pray for that person that God
[1:47:38] will show them the light show them where
[1:47:41] they're wrong and here sometimes ago a
[1:47:42] man met me here they pulled me aside and
[1:47:45] there was a pianoist and they're talking
[1:47:47] about I'm going to paraphrase this
[1:47:48] brother Brown had a
[1:47:50] pianoist and she was wearing a short
[1:47:51] skirt and and I used this a little while
[1:47:54] ago and I know you probably remember and
[1:47:56] but God told me to read it again and she
[1:47:58] had short hair and a short dress and she
[1:48:00] had a mid drift she had a two-piece so
[1:48:01] her belly button showed now I that's
[1:48:05] just
[1:48:07] okay and he said the and he said the man
[1:48:11] come up now watch this this is where
[1:48:13] we're getting to and the man came up to
[1:48:15] brother Bram out there and was just
[1:48:17] ripping me apart he said tear me to
[1:48:20] pieces and said and you profess the be a
[1:48:23] Pentecostal preacher and let a woman
[1:48:25] like that sit up
[1:48:28] there he said that short hair and that
[1:48:30] going on everything and this how the
[1:48:31] prophet he said well I said I think the
[1:48:34] woman's got a good spirit on her and I
[1:48:36] certainly don't agree with that part you
[1:48:39] know that the skirt part and here and
[1:48:41] the two pieces and that but one of them
[1:48:44] down
[1:48:45] here and kind of up here he's talking
[1:48:47] about her clothes she was in modest her
[1:48:50] skirt nut real thin and it showed her
[1:48:52] underneath garment and they were around
[1:48:54] here and I don't think that should be
[1:48:56] done I don't like that I really don't
[1:49:00] but I can't but I might but they might
[1:49:04] be just as Spirit-filled as anybody
[1:49:12] else I don't know how they could be I'm
[1:49:15] just
[1:49:16] confessing it's all right you don't I'm
[1:49:19] I'm so he said they might be just as
[1:49:22] spirit filed as anybody
[1:49:24] else and brother Dale would
[1:49:26] say
[1:49:28] how how watch this this is this is a
[1:49:33] Vindicated Prophet I don't know God
[1:49:37] knows that but
[1:49:40] I oh bless God I'd like to preach a lot
[1:49:43] of message people right about now but I
[1:49:46] wouldn't condemn that
[1:49:51] woman and say that she was going to Hell
[1:49:55] by
[1:49:57] sight that is in
[1:50:01] paragraph
[1:50:03] 64
[1:50:06] of God being misunderstood 61723
[1:50:10] evening
[1:50:12] 61723 evening God being
[1:50:16] misunderstood I want to read that soon
[1:50:18] said God knows that but I wouldn't
[1:50:20] condemn that woman and say that she's
[1:50:23] going to Hell by the
[1:50:26] sight but that's message Believers
[1:50:29] would and I would have been in the front
[1:50:31] of the row 20 years ago 30 years ago oh
[1:50:35] yeah I was leading the church bless God
[1:50:38] I'm saving the
[1:50:42] world yeah yeah oh yeah I sure saved the
[1:50:46] world all right they
[1:50:49] left they left not because they weren't
[1:50:52] predestinated because I was an
[1:50:57] idiot and I can say Amen cuz God
[1:51:00] revealed it to
[1:51:03] me but there's some other people that
[1:51:05] could wear those shoes
[1:51:09] too verse 65 and this person this person
[1:51:13] that came to tear brother brandham apart
[1:51:15] had a church down the road and there was
[1:51:16] a lady there with long hair and wore
[1:51:19] very long dresses and she had a temper
[1:51:21] that would run above
[1:51:29] uhoh and I just drop to paragraph 67 I'm
[1:51:32] only reading the back part of the
[1:51:33] paragraph to save time but when you're
[1:51:36] real quickly when you when you real
[1:51:40] quickly condemn her you drive her away
[1:51:45] and you might harm that Young born baby
[1:51:48] Christian baby and I wouldn't condemn
[1:51:52] that
[1:52:04] person
[1:52:08] um and then he goes into talking about
[1:52:12] people speaking in tongues and this is
[1:52:13] the same paragraph 69 he said now I have
[1:52:17] to say something here that's a little
[1:52:19] strange and if you don't agree with me
[1:52:22] that's
[1:52:24] okay you see we misjudge these things so
[1:52:30] many
[1:52:32] times see the family of God has got so
[1:52:36] correct that we can't tolerate one
[1:52:39] another I won't go to your house you
[1:52:42] can't come to mine cuz you would
[1:52:43] probably
[1:52:46] die but we're all going in a Rapture and
[1:52:48] it's going to be
[1:52:50] perfect we might as well be honest
[1:52:53] we should be at each other's house
[1:52:55] intertwined all the time upside
[1:52:58] breakfasts suppers tea you know I have
[1:53:02] worldly people that seen me we seen
[1:53:05] worldly I told you that last time I
[1:53:07] can't I can't I still can't get over it
[1:53:09] and and they said if you and the drive
[1:53:11] by you stop in and see
[1:53:13] us for a
[1:53:16] tea whatever happened to to Fellowship
[1:53:20] just just Fellowship you don't need a
[1:53:22] preacher present it's it might be nice
[1:53:25] if I you know what I mean it don't have
[1:53:28] to be like part of the scheduled
[1:53:30] Services you don't even need an invite
[1:53:32] to come to my
[1:53:37] house amen amen I I'm sorry I'm I'm
[1:53:41] trying to God's trying to teach us
[1:53:43] something here he
[1:53:46] said he said I have to say something a
[1:53:48] little strange here and you might you
[1:53:49] might not agree with me this that's okay
[1:53:52] he you see we misjudge these things many
[1:53:54] times let's always try to think the very
[1:53:58] best of anybody who's trying to do
[1:54:01] what's right and probably
[1:54:04] failing which one of us can live the law

[1:54:49] were a teenager I know it was a long
[1:54:51] time ago but try to think

[1:55:05] us amen I'm wow I'm sorry oh they uh oh
[1:55:12] they're trying we don't know their heart
[1:55:14] unless you have
[1:55:16] discernment if they're wrong then if you
[1:55:19] got the Bible says if your brother be
[1:55:21] overtaken taken in a fault then let them
[1:55:24] which are spiritual go to the brother in
[1:55:26] a
[1:55:29] Meek
[1:55:31] Spirit consider your own self lest you
[1:55:34] would sin too be tempted so that you
[1:55:38] you'd have to really bring down your ego
[1:55:41] and see that if you could reconcile the
[1:55:43] brother see back to God and don't say
[1:55:46] that they haven't got the right spirit
[1:55:54] let's move on well I oh man I'm sorry
[1:55:58] what well we
[1:56:07] seen brother Braham talks about when he
[1:56:09] went to the Pentecostal people and they
[1:56:11] spoke in tongues and he said he said in
[1:56:14] the quote here I'm paraphrasing he said
[1:56:16] I felt that I was among angels and he
[1:56:18] said God sent me out and he said I
[1:56:21] realized that one was was a Christian
[1:56:23] and one was a
[1:56:25] devil see gifts and callings are without
[1:56:29] repentance amen maybe the person that
[1:56:31] shelts the
[1:56:32] loudest and I believe in shelting praise
[1:56:35] God we're Stone
[1:56:38] quiet God forbid that he'd have to bring
[1:56:40] a worldly person in among us to Make
[1:56:42] Some Noise to keep the preacher fired
[1:56:45] up
[1:56:47] amen Hebrews 67 and 8 and the world
[1:56:51] which here here when brother Brown went
[1:56:53] to those Pentecostal people he couldn't
[1:56:55] understand how one could be a believer
[1:56:56] and one could be a uh uh a devil and God
[1:57:00] gave him the scripture you know the
[1:57:01] story and the quotes where the wind kept
[1:57:02] blowing his Bible open to it cuz he was
[1:57:04] sleeping in the cornfield because he had
[1:57:06] so much money he couldn't afford a
[1:57:09] room wow a lot of you young people don't
[1:57:12] know what hard times are yet when you
[1:57:15] start sleeping in the
[1:57:18] cornfield amen and the Earth which
[1:57:20] drinketh the rain cometh upon it and it
[1:57:23] bringeth forth herbs to meet them that
[1:57:25] are dressed and receiveth the blessing
[1:57:27] from God and also the
[1:57:30] Thorns that are rejected and
[1:57:32] cursing they're all burnt but see the
[1:57:35] rain falls on the just and the
[1:57:38] unjust you have you have Matthew let's
[1:57:40] move ahead to Matthew 5 I'm trying to go

[1:57:56] you do good to them that hate you and
[1:57:58] pray for them that despitefully use you
[1:58:00] and persecute you that ye may be the
[1:58:02] children of Our Father which is in
[1:58:04] heaven for he maketh the son to rise

[1:58:09] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[1:58:12] good sendeth reain on the just and on
[1:58:14] the unjust how much more could the
[1:58:16] Christians just get along even if we
[1:58:19] disagree because God send in the Holy
[1:58:21] Spirit on all of you he's sending the
[1:58:23] rain on the just and the unjust why
[1:58:25] couldn't we just be friends

[1:58:30] this uh for 46 for if ye love them which
[1:58:35] love you what reward have you if you

[1:58:41] feel really comfortable at your home and
[1:58:43] you never come to my home what reward do
[1:58:45] you
[1:58:47] have now we just have a church with
[1:58:49] Clicks in it amen uh do not even the
[1:58:53] publicans do the same and if you salute
[1:58:55] your brother that you really have the
[1:58:56] same Doctrine and salute only the
[1:58:59] brother that you do more than others do
[1:59:02] you not like the Republicans verse 48
[1:59:05] because ye
[1:59:06] therefore be perfect as your father
[1:59:09] which is in heaven Hallelujah God help
[1:59:11] us let's let's just go fast here God why
[1:59:14] he said
[1:59:21] uh Jehovah made us amateur gods and
[1:59:24] we're a part of his family and I already
[1:59:25] mentioned that so so now he don't exist
[1:59:28] alone I'm just skipping that he don't
[1:59:30] exist alone he dwells with his family
[1:59:32] and it's a part but the problem is not
[1:59:35] the father in the family it's the father
[1:59:37] is always the children they made me do
[1:59:39] it or she did do it amen and we got to
[1:59:43] get out of that God didn't make us to be
[1:59:46] title Tales do we all believe that God's
[1:59:49] omnipotent do we believe that he's got
[1:59:51] the the beginning from the end then why
[1:59:53] does he need me to tell him who took a
[1:59:55] cookie I mean he seen that cookie taken
[1:59:58] 2,000 years
[2:00:00] ago Matthew 71:5 judge not here's my
[2:00:04] scripture so I I'm now I'm in the word
[2:00:06] of God judge not that you be not
[2:00:09] judged I don't even care if you're
[2:00:11] judging
[2:00:13] correctly we can all see goats if you
[2:00:17] see a goat yeah there's a goat she's got
[2:00:19] spikes on she don't have no wool and
[2:00:21] she's black a lot says don't judge
[2:00:25] remember when it says to go re second
[2:00:27] tell the brother that if you didn't go
[2:00:28] in humility that you would
[2:00:30] fall judge not lest you be judged for
[2:00:34] for with what judgment ye judge ye shall
[2:00:36] also be judged and with merit with which
[2:00:39] measure you Merit it shall be measured
[2:00:42] again unto you and Why beholdest th
[2:00:44] Brothers mol in his eye but considerest
[2:00:46] not the beam in thine own eye wilt thou
[2:00:48] whether say to thy brother let me pull
[2:00:50] out the mold out of thy eye and behold
[2:00:51] the beam that's in I know ey thou
[2:00:54] hypocrite were all born in sin shaped
[2:00:57] and iniquity come to the world speaking
[2:00:59] lies you're not perfected yet or you
[2:01:03] would have
[2:01:04] died amen thou hypocrite First cast out
[2:01:08] the beam out of thine own eye and then
[2:01:10] Thou shalt clearly be able to cast out
[2:01:12] the beam out of the brother's eye now I
[2:01:13] got some really short quotes now we're
[2:01:15] going to pull up this thing and shut her
[2:01:16] down here he said you know sometimes we
[2:01:19] I'm going to give you the titles and
[2:01:20] just these are on liners you know
[2:01:22] sometimes misjudge he said just zillions
[2:01:26] of times you know sometimes we misjudge
[2:01:29] the the common person and their prayer
[2:01:33] that's in the Covenant God's covenant
[2:01:34] with Abraham and now there's many times
[2:01:37] that this that people misjudge one
[2:01:39] another and it's a bad thing to do
[2:01:42] that's God being misunderstood and if
[2:01:44] you don't agree with me that's okay but
[2:01:47] you see we misjudge the things many
[2:01:49] times that's God being misunderstood
[2:01:51] also so many times we write in here and
[2:01:54] on serpent seed and you say you write
[2:01:57] into to the prophet and you say that I
[2:01:59] said so and so and I go and I get the
[2:02:03] tape and I play the tape back and I
[2:02:06] didn't say what you said I said see
[2:02:09] people misjudge things that's in the
[2:02:13] sign of the end sir Romans 8 uh 2 Romans
[2:02:17] 82 and I want you can pull up this
[2:02:19] picture that you had up there before for
[2:02:21] the the law of the spirit is life in
[2:02:25] Christ Jesus has made us free from the
[2:02:28] law of
[2:02:30] sin and death and I put in paraphrase
[2:02:34] they they praise the Lord now if you
[2:02:35] look in this this is in the Philippians
[2:02:37] Church age number seven uh there one of
[2:02:41] the last quotes that come
[2:02:43] up uh and this scripture is a par in the
[2:02:48] paragraph right above and I want to read
[2:02:49] this this is a quote Oh no sorry go to
[2:02:52] the uh that that's go to the other one
[2:02:55] that's one this is one so we're starting
[2:02:57] right at the first paragraph where it
[2:02:58] says but but the Jews back there in the
[2:03:01] time of Jesus they wanted to they they
[2:03:05] did not want to accept that sacrifice
[2:03:07] meaning Christ Jesus the blood of bull
[2:03:10] and goats made nothing perfect the law
[2:03:13] made nothing perfect but it was once
[2:03:15] God's ordained method but now Christ
[2:03:18] having appeared in the flesh and by
[2:03:19] shedding of his own blood had put away
[2:03:21] sin by that offering of himself had made
[2:03:25] us perfect and the Jews would not take
[2:03:31] that they love the law but what about
[2:03:34] the Philippian AIDS and yes and all the
[2:03:38] other Church ages that means the Leo
[2:03:41] Dean Church age too that means you love
[2:03:44] the law too unless God help me amen you
[2:03:48] all the other Church ages too I made it
[2:03:52] there with a question mark did you Did
[2:03:54] they really accept this really in Christ
[2:03:57] no sir even though Luther brought the
[2:04:01] truth by justification the Roman Church
[2:04:04] it the Eastern counterparts and the
[2:04:06] Orthodox church and still clung to
[2:04:11] works now works are
[2:04:14] fine but they won't save you that's
[2:04:17] right they won't make you perfect and it
[2:04:20] is Christ or parish and it is not even
[2:04:25] Christ and my good works it is Christ
[2:04:29] alone that's right this AE now we got to
[2:04:32] get through this because we got to
[2:04:33] change topics this age began years in
[2:04:37] the help me out honey
[2:04:39] somebody the okay
[2:04:43] sorry oh buddy that does not believe in
[2:04:48] Christ as a reality they couldn't change
[2:04:51] CH they could not turn the
[2:04:54] corner they didn't believe in Christ as
[2:04:57] a
[2:05:02] reality it does not sing watch how the
[2:05:06] prophets making a good point here he see
[2:05:08] they don't sing there's nothing but the
[2:05:10] blood for it's a song of nothing but the
[2:05:13] blood in my Good
[2:05:16] Conduct that's how a lot of Believers
[2:05:19] serve that's why there's empty pews in
[2:05:21] this church it's not because there's no
[2:05:24] predestinated seat around driving
[2:05:25] distance of this
[2:05:27] church it's because we're singing a song
[2:05:29] that is Jesus Christ in the blood and
[2:05:32] we're better than
[2:05:34] you cuz I wee a tie and it's all sweaty
[2:05:38] that's just
[2:05:41] tradition he said that's the song they
[2:05:44] sing it's nothing but the blood and my
[2:05:47] own conduct now you believe I now I
[2:05:50] believe in Good Conduct and if you're
[2:05:52] saved you will do righteously and we
[2:05:55] have already gone over that I I have too
[2:05:57] I preached on the fruits of the spirit
[2:05:59] you can tell but we don't have a right
[2:06:01] to judge and but let me tell you now
[2:06:04] salvation is not Jesus
[2:06:08] plus we got to get this or we're going
[2:06:11] to be I'm going to die of old age and I
[2:06:13] don't want to go in some old bony
[2:06:16] casket it's Jesus alone
[2:06:22] salvation is of the Lord from start to
[2:06:25] finish it is all God let his life be in
[2:06:29] me and it's his blood that cleanse me
[2:06:32] and let it be his spirit that fills me
[2:06:34] and let it be his word in my heart and
[2:06:37] mouth and let it be his stripes that
[2:06:39] heals me Let It Be Jesus and Jesus alone
[2:06:42] not my works of righteousness which I
[2:06:45] have done no sir it's Christ is my
[2:06:50] life now I can't preach that no pler
[2:06:52] than
[2:06:53] that that's right amen I I just got a
[2:06:57] few little things here please if you'll
[2:06:59] hold on he said now one member he said
[2:07:02] now when one member talks against
[2:07:03] another member he said you know that's
[2:07:05] wrong he said you should pray for one
[2:07:08] another and don't talk against one
[2:07:10] another but love them and pick them up
[2:07:13] it's talking about picking up if you if
[2:07:14] you search for pick up he said you
[2:07:16] should never condemn a brother that's
[2:07:18] Topsy turby Topsy turby he said just
[2:07:21] like the mother ego she'll pick him up
[2:07:24] as long as he's a
[2:07:26] ego amen and when you do this the draw
[2:07:29] lines oh we're good long dryer line
[2:07:32] dryers brother Paul the Fontaine
[2:07:34] mentioned some stuff to us and I'm not
[2:07:36] going to mention here we're out of time
[2:07:38] but that's of the
[2:07:40] devil just shake your head like this if
[2:07:43] it
[2:07:44] hurts we don't need to draw lines I
[2:07:47] don't care what they believe over there
[2:07:48] I'm still going to go be their friends
[2:07:50] amen amen amen they might be twice as
[2:07:53] good as me amen and when you do all this
[2:07:56] and you draw lines and not Fellowship
[2:07:58] one with the other brother's wrong
[2:08:00] you'll never win him to Christ by
[2:08:02] shoving him down farther that's right oh
[2:08:05] if one down in the gutter you'll never
[2:08:08] show him you you don't never shove him
[2:08:12] down farther you pick him up and you
[2:08:15] quickly and you help him we should be an
[2:08:17] example to
[2:08:20] him he said you know a real Christian
[2:08:23] this way will hide everything he
[2:08:26] can from each
[2:08:28] other you know if you're the father of
[2:08:31] the
[2:08:32] house and you know I could use anyone I
[2:08:35] I was looking at brother
[2:08:37] Lauren brother Lauren had some boys and
[2:08:39] if one of the boys and only brother
[2:08:42] Lauren knew about it he don't have to
[2:08:43] put it on
[2:08:44] Facebook you know he don't have to tell
[2:08:47] the other four brothers You Got a
[2:08:49] brother
[2:08:53] I told my mom that one
[2:08:55] time it didn't go over
[2:08:58] well you know what I'm
[2:09:01] saying it's God's
[2:09:03] family he said no we ought to hide from
[2:09:06] one another don't tell your his bad
[2:09:09] things he said just tell his good things
[2:09:12] just tell what you know of him that's
[2:09:13] good if anything's bad let it alone the
[2:09:16] poor little fellows got enough against
[2:09:19] them anyway don't try to put them don't
[2:09:21] get a pull and shove them down further
[2:09:23] into the ditch CHR the Christian
[2:09:27] attitude could they add the message
[2:09:29] attitude the converted attitude is to
[2:09:32] pick them up and get them out of the
[2:09:34] ditch and don't never try to shove them
[2:09:37] down he's down
[2:09:39] already try to help
[2:09:44] him but too many
[2:09:48] times too many of us to
[2:09:53] say don't do that I might
[2:09:57] say to try to do that and that's my
[2:10:01] closing paragraph and I truly am done
[2:10:03] Philippians 2 3 and 4 let nothing be
[2:10:07] done by strife and vain Glory but in
[2:10:11] lonliness of mind letting each esteem
[2:10:15] the
[2:10:16] other
[2:10:18] better than
[2:10:20] himself look not every man at his own
[2:10:24] boast look at what I
[2:10:28] did poof just stop breathing and you'll
[2:10:32] soon find out what you
[2:10:33] did but let every man also look to the
[2:10:37] things
[2:10:39] of
[2:10:41] others let's
[2:10:44] stand I
[2:10:47] promise I promise a very big promise
[2:10:52] oh dear
[2:10:56] Jesus God help
[2:11:04] us I I I pray to God you know I I was I
[2:11:09] was with our brother this week and we
[2:11:12] were really open and Lan is very
[2:11:16] supportive there's lots and lots of
[2:11:19] times I'll come to Friday and I'll say
[2:11:20] man I don't have a clue what I'm
[2:11:23] preaching
[2:11:25] on now you know I could take the Bible
[2:11:28] and just pull anything I could preach
[2:11:30] on any family
[2:11:33] topic unless God really anointed you
[2:11:36] might not even
[2:11:38] know but God just showed that thing how
[2:11:43] it was always the kids that fight among
[2:11:46] themselves and it's never the parents
[2:11:49] that it's never the parents that are got
[2:11:51] a problem in the family it's always the
[2:11:53] kids running to Daddy and saying Dad D D
[2:11:56] D D
[2:11:58] D and God
[2:12:00] said preach that to my
[2:12:03] church Preach that to my
[2:12:06] church if you believe that God's
[2:12:09] omnipotent and he is the alpha the
[2:12:12] beginning and the Omega the end he
[2:12:15] already knew I took the Molasses cookie
[2:12:17] out of the jar he could tell by the size
[2:12:20] of my waist
[2:12:22] he didn't need you to come and tell them
[2:12:26] that you caught me in the
[2:12:28] ACT look and I I'm trying to close this
[2:12:31] look at the Spirit of Christ when they
[2:12:34] caught the woman right in the act of
[2:12:36] adultery and it was
[2:12:38] wrong it was
[2:12:40] sin he said where are your accusers it
[2:12:43] was never Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ
[2:12:49] was so holy none of us could stand in
[2:12:52] front of
[2:12:54] him but it's CU he was our heavenly
[2:12:58] father and he had a family and he
[2:13:02] realized that in the family I'm trying
[2:13:04] to end he realized that some of his sons
[2:13:06] would be good with money and he realized
[2:13:09] some of them would be a
[2:13:12] disaster he realized some would go in
[2:13:14] debt to their eyes and some wouldn't go
[2:13:16] in dead at all he realized some
[2:13:18] daughters would get married young and
[2:13:20] some daughters wouldn't never get
[2:13:22] married but he was still the
[2:13:25] father they amen they were as different
[2:13:29] but he was the father and there's
[2:13:32] nothing like what he said when you go
[2:13:33] back to my mom and dad and if there ever
[2:13:36] was a a fatherly figure it was my dad
[2:13:40] that had the
[2:13:41] kids and no more than ever before when
[2:13:45] the dad and mom and you guys have family
[2:13:47] come together whether it's Thanksgiving
[2:13:49] or Christmas or
