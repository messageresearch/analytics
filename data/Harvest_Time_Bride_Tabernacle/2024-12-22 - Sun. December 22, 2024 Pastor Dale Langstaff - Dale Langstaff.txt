trip when we were gone we mentioned that some on Wednesday and in the future we will we'll have a Sunday that we have maybe John and Lori Garrett with us and we'll show pictures and and uh give you more examples uh of our of our trip we we had a very busy time when we were gone very very busy and I felt every bit of my age in traveling every bit especially when you're in the pastor's study bent over a toilet amen God uh protected us and helped us and and I believe to them they I believe the bride was blessed there in many many many ways and that's what they've told us anyway but we're glad to be home and and it's a quite a change in weather most the average day down there was 104 to 106 so uh this is a I didn't leave the house much this week the house felt quite cool but uh it's still good to be home anden amen amen let's just turn to job this morning and we want to I really appreciated the the new song Jared sing cuz it kind of was a part of our thought this morning and uh who I just want to I believe God wants to show us who we are more and more in him and this is part of the thought this morning I this was a message God give me I preached it down there and uh I'm going to minister it here by God's grace job 1:6 now there was a day when the sons of God came to present them themselves before the Lord and Satan also came amongst them now in job 2:1 it says and Satan came amongst them and presented himself also before the Lord Lord we pray that you'll take the scriptures and may it be you that ministers this morning your thought and Lord God we give you all the glory and all the honor and we welcome you in this place and any way that you would desire to work Lord Jesus this morning we praise you for it amen amen you may have your seats this morning amen just many uh prayer requests or testimonies I should say sorry uh just uh from Brother Carson's Dad we prayed for him on Wednesday um for his hip for healing he was he was out I believe he was out hunting after yeah he was unbelievable God is amazing God is everywhere even even on the same testimony thing you know if you're looking for God moving sister Sharon's brother they went to the airport to stay with him and the doctor said that we will put your your uh bladder bladder on the outside of your body because of cancer and he has completely a perfect bill of health actually he's went back repeatedly and they said you have no cancer also when we were there in new New Foundland with Carson and Sharon in the summertime they went to visit a sister that had backslid and and and well was outside the church you know but a Believer and she had been diagnosed with cancer and since they have stopped there she had has completely a clean bill of health her cancer was a size six and they said the the doctors you have to watch how doctors talk because doctors are built upon fear that's what keeps them employed in case you don't know that the doctors said we can't see no cancer but we still want to do the surgery wait a minute let let's it was a six it went to a three and she went back repeatedly they said we can't see nothing but we'd still like to cut you I I wouldn't offer to be a guinea pig for them in any way but God is still God Amen he's just can do anything that he desires to do and so we praise God for that to think that brother Carson's dad was suffering and bound up and just a day or two later he was O hunting amen hallelujah prise amen God is you know the brother Brown said that the greatest thing that Satan hates is revelation it's Revelation and you know we need to accept the Revelation and I can't give you Revelation and nobody else can give you Revelation but if your heart is open to God and the and and his word he will he is he he's more than willing to reveal himself unto you and and Satan hates revelation because it identifies that he's a liar and a loser and and his his final destination and and all these things Satan it just drives him crazy amen and so we see here in the story of job that that when the sons of God came by and to present themselves before the Lord that Satan was amongst them and you know we know that Spirits don't die and so Satan or God said to Satan he said have you considered my bride in Wyoming he said they are completely perfect don't doubt that cuz Romans 8:30 says you're already glorified so you're already perfect if you don't that you don't the word of God you don't have to believe me but it would be good to believe the Bible and he said they're already perfect he said have you considered them and Satan said whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa he said God that's not a fair com because he said you have a protection about them you built a hedge about job and he said I can't get to them ain't you glad that Satan can't get to you and work you over more than God permits he said I can't get to say God said well because of their perfection he said I will allow you to touch everything he has he's got a lot of confidence in you and so here we see that Satan touched everything God had and then Satan came back to the presence of God and God was very curious he already knew because he had total conf confidence in his predestinated plan he said how are you making out and and Satan of course because he's a liar he said now God he said that's still unfair because he said skin for skin he said you let me attack his body and he'll curse you to his face but God in the realm of of of his deity and we know that deity is not in heaven but it's in you this morning if you have the baptism of the Holy ghost it's on Earth and he said in his realm of deity he knew that was the lie because everything that comes out of Satan's mouth is a lie and he said okay he said you can touch his life but he said you can't take it now I want to tell you something this morning the reason that Satan can't take your life is it isn't his life for you to take he said you're a part of God's life not a part of Satan's life so Satan don't have the authority or the ability to take your life and here we see that that job went through all these trials and lost everything including his health and his church friends can buy three of them and we don't need friends like that and they said you know you're hiding something from God and he's getting even with you I want to tell you this morning we don't serve a God that gets even amen and these people that came before job were were just terrible people you know telling job he had all these uh disgusting problems hidden sins and all these problem I want to remind you something if something does somebody does that to you that the Bible says the accuser is Lucifer and he Tabernacles in bodies of Flesh so somebody says you're hiding something from me and you know that's the reason that it snowed this week because you're that's the reason you went in the ditch cuz you're hiding a sin oh that's that's the reason you know you don't have no money cuz you're hiding a sin that's just a lie from the devil and then we even see also job's wife came to him and she could see the wreck that he was in and she said why don't you just Curse God and die' and I want to jump through faster on this story and go to Job 38 and this just blessed my heart in Job 38 the Bible says that the Lord came and it was his turn to do the talking everybody else that had their piece of the pie and their piece of the action but God stepped on the scene he said now I'm going to do some talking and so in job you can pull that up job 38:1 it says and the Lord answered job out of Whirlwind and he said who is this darken counsel by words without knowledge now God very clearly told you what he thought of Satan's counsel through these friends of job he called it dark in counsel and without knowledge God could have said they were just flat out lies and here he orders job he said now gir up your loins like a man and I will demand of you now you need to pull that up verse three I'd like you to see that in in written form and here's God said I will demand of job an answer from you I want to tell you something this morning God I believe with all my heart is demanding an answer from each one of us he will demand that's not an option that's not a choice job 38:3 here's God now God already knew that job was perfect God already had complete confidence in who job was job was already a part of the predestinated plan of God and the reason I can say that is because that's how God had that much confidence in him and God still said I will demand an answer from you demand amen and this is the whole circumstance that the bride of Christ has to come to in our day because see not everyone that comes to church well when the sons of God came before God Satan was there also to present himself before the Lord so if Satan came to present himself before the Lord and deity is not in heaven but in Earth now it's not just in heaven but it's also in Earth then Satan will come around our mid and present himself before deity is that fair to say and this is the answer that God was expecting but this is the question that God answered job he said where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth Earth declare an answer unto me if thou has understanding to my question here's God see if you can answer this question and answer it per properly it will identify who you are let me give you an example brother Brown said about 34 times he talked about a mule was the most let me just jump this a mule was the most odly Godly thing that was ever created and in the world cuz a mu don't know who his papa is and who his mama is and it can't reproduce the deity of God he said ungodly and illegitimate and ungodly he said God had nothing to do with a meal about 30 sometimes but there's a lot of mules that hang around the bride because it's scriptural that the M went right before the Lamb of God and presented themselves and the whole problem is I demand an answer is you must know who your daddy is if you know who your parents are and your grandparents and your family lineage you will know exactly where you're standing I'm not worried about how much my grandpa owned or my daddy owned because I understand it because I was in them now think spiritually amen if you understand that God's your heavenly father and you understand that you came from The Presence of Jehovah and he's tabernacled in flesh and deity you'll have no questions of where you're walking you'll have no questions of your healing yours you'll have no questions that he supplies all our needs amen because you understand your family lineage amen yeah but a mule don't have a clue here the prophet said you know let me let me just go into his thing just a little bit we'll go back to our scripture he said God had nothing to do with it he said they're the hardest headed thing you've ever seen is a mu he said you could preach to them for 15 lifetimes and you'll never get through their head he said he said that's a lot of what that that we have to come to recognize who who is our mama and who is our Papa God's asking you did you come from me I demand of you where were you if you understand where you were before the foundation of the world you'll understand everything in your life today Hallelujah he said you watch a donkey you can holler at him and preach and all this here in his next quote he talked about they'll never understand because they don't know where they come but he said let me I want to get to something where he said here sorry he said but a mule you can never outwork a mu praise the Lord we're not saved on works praise the lord it's not my good my good past that's saving me amen he said a mule will work and work and work and all they do is honk honk honk and he said the the days of Miracles is past honk honk a half breed I'm supposed to be around this honk honk but he said you'll never outwork them because they're built for work but it wasn't works that God was saving on he said you could never I wish I I can't find that right now it's not coming up to me hallelujah oh watch this he say but you they're good workers he said they'll just work work work and work he said the four times he said Put Me In Mind of a bunch of Il uh I can't even say that word that's always trying to work their way to heaven he said that's right a mule the lady social society and a chicken for supper to pay the preacher and we got to have a dance in this society and this and that and they work it in this spot he says work six times he said they'll work work work work work work and work God wasn't one part of them amen and so God is demanding of us before we can go any further he says who are your parents who are your parents where was I when I laid the foundation verse 4 and verse 38 of job the foundation of the Earth declar unto me you got to answer me if thou has understanding thou H has who H has laid the measures thereof if thou knowest tell me or whom has stretched the line upon it it was him himself whereupon the foundations there were fasten or who laid the stone the Cornerstone thereof and then we know this very famous scripture job 38:7 and when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God soed for Joy where were you I'll tell you where I was I was the one with the big mouth there I was right there I was right there in them 100% in them God help us to understand we know that Genesis 1 and I know you've heard this thousands of times from me and I'm going to go faster at Genesis 1 126 and 7 that God created man and woman in his own image so if we have God's coming back and he said where were you where did you come from at the beginning if you understand where you came from then you'll understand everything he compared that like I said 30 some times to a thoroughbred horse he understands who his parents are his grandparent his whole family lineage amen and he and we understand too he said if you believe in that you have eternal life you've always had eternal life and we know that God is infinite and we came from God and I want to give you the definition or meaning of infinite it's Eternal the absolute the inexhaustible the bottomless the unending the unau and the on that's God and that's who you were a part of that's who you came out of we know Romans 9:16 it says I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion and so then it verse 16 so then it is not him that willth it's not the M that can work and work and work and work it's not him that willth nor him that runneth but it's God that showeth mercy and and you know like wow I would ask you I said you know in Romans or Revelation 138 it says that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world where were you when the lamb was slain for my sins you know the accuser of the brethren we have to recognize that if you were in God and before the foundation of the world and you were there when he paid the price for my sins you can't see them you can't even remember them because you were in God you are a part of God hallelujah he said a real genuine Christian they were in him in the morning star when the when they sang together and the found the sons of God shuddered for Joy he said before the foundation of the world we identified in The Immortal Realm with God 10 million years before the world was ever formed I was there I was there and because I was there I know exactly where I'm going and who I am I'm a son and daughter of God this morning and if you got eternal life you were in them and so we want to look at some some some characters in The Bible and asked you where you were when God came down to Abraham and Sarah and gave them the promise for a son where were you declare unto me I was right there I heard him talking to Abraham it was me that heard Sarah laugh in the tent and God couldn't touch Sarah because she was a part of Abraham and if she would have killed Sarah she would have killed Abraham because they were one where were you when the sons of God showed it for Joy when God came down and dealt with Joseph and Joseph was rejected by his carnal brothers and sisters and sold into slavery and all of this where were you I was right there when the brothers were talking I was right there when I seen the money go in the merchants hands when they paid the price for Joseph to put him into slavery to actually protect his Brotherhood I was right there I was in him when I seen Joseph wrongly accused and threw in prison and I was also in God when God raised them up and put them on the right hand of the throne and all when Joseph went through the city all the people would bow and Shout to him where were you I remember it perfectly because I was there Jacob when he wrestled with the angel at night I was God's right arm that broke his will it took a long time but I was right there in the arm when I the next day my arm was hurting but I was right there when God broke Jacob's will where were you I demand of you to know the answer God demands of you Moses when God brought Moses and and showed himself in the burning bush I was there when God told Moses he said take off your shoes you're getting the ground dirty I was right there I was right there when Moses told God you're making a mistake cuz I don't talk right I got a bad si in my tongue and I was there when God's anger was kindled and boiled I was right there I was also right there when Moses went Before the Throne of the king and he threw down his rod and the musicians tried to compy the MU mules of the day threw down their rods and they turned to serpents too but he said it was God's serpent that ate them up I was right there I had a front row seat amen I was there when Moses led the children of Israel out of Egypt and they took the wealth of Egypt they they filed for bankruptcy afterwards for all their back Years of Slavery 400 and some years and they never left a penny or a hoof behind I was right there I was right there God help us that's see were you there can you remember can you remember the situation of the scenario around you do you remember all the crowds that were gathered God says I demand of you amen we have to be identified in God to understand where we came from and that's the reason that people that hang around the church got spiritual Amnesia and have drown cold it's because they don't know who their daddy is they don't know who their family is they don't know where they belong they're like an adopted child for their parents God help us in the Days of Elijah when Elijah was dealing with the evil King and Jezebel and when he went and sat under a juniper tree and said I'm the only one God kill me I was right there when God brought the Mana and fed him and then have them rest again because was so tired in his SP it was me that came down with God Amen were you there with me there was so many I can't remember all that were there but I demand of you not I but God right is that Bible God demands where were you Hallelujah when David was rejected by his Brethren when here here he watch this this is you there's so much things don't change in the Bible we get used to the stories but it's exactly the same scenario here's God's prophet and he couldn't even see like God seen Samuel he came and the first brother and he's got the oh it's already it's about ready to drip out of the God's like who that's not my man and he got a Vindicated prophet Samuel God said I don't see like you see I was there I was right there and he brought all the Brethren and you know look at how the Brethren rejected him and even as and Samuel comes and there's no more kids and Samuel says to the dad this is this is almost you know an insinuation of a lie is the same as a lie and Samuel said you don't got no more kids God Must Have Forgot well well you know we got this little tiny Church paints falling Offa he's out watching the Sheep they're not he he's he's running David was rejected by his brothers and even his dad he was an afterthought wow but God knew he was there God never forgot you know if we look at that story and this is amazing and I I mentioned it before but you know when David went to his his brothers that were in war and he's just taken them a samri he's in complete obedience to what he's supposed to do and his brothers think he's putting on a big show it wasn't David putting on a show he was just obeying his mom and dad God have mercy on us be careful what we say and do amen David was there the Hebrew children when they went to the fiery furnace you see I was there when Israel lost in battle and I was there when the king took all the best of Israel the best of slaves the smartest and the most handy back to his kingdom here he builds an image to worship the Prophet Daniel Daniel would have never allowed it because he was gone away to a far country he wasn't on the scene and they blew the trumpet and all the children of Israel just fell down and worshiped that image except three I was there when he brought them up to the king and he said don't you know I have the power Hallelujah only the power that God allows you to have is the only Power you got those Hebrew children I was right there when they spelled it out they said we're not even careful how we live our life because we know who our daddy is yes and we're not even careful about how we serve you because we know that God God is the boss and you're just a an intermediate puppet that's using for God to pull the strings you know go the B brother Brown said that Satan works is a tool for God the countries of the world are tools that God huh you know all these words are just tools that God just he setting up the world stage and we're going to go home one of these days and all hell's going to break loose on this Earth amen but you're only going to go home if you know who you are amen where you came from they said we're not even careful how we answer you because we know that our God our daddy is able to deliver us and if he doesn't Deliver us we'll be in his presence so it makes zero difference to us what the outcome is to a live is gain and die is to be in The Presence of Jehovah I was there I was there when when Daniel was thrown in the lying stand wrongfully accused because of jealousy and you know if we look at the story of Daniel you know there is nowhere in the Bible or the message of that day that said you had to pray with your windows open there is nowhere in the Bible or in the message of that day they said you had to pray out loud because the B actually the very opposite the Bible says that what you do in secret God will hear and reward you openly so most of us message Believers this this is what we would have did if we were reliving in Daniel's Age We God bless this food God is neat let's eat cuz we wouldn't want nobody at the restaurant to know that we were Believers but Daniel wouldn't change his lifestyle how he prayed and how he opened his windows and the amount of times he prayed and of course he was through in the lon and and you know the prophet says different things but I want to tell you something this morning you know it was God is love it was love brother Brown said that it was a boundary of love but I want to tell you something you know why Daniel wasn't afraid of those Lions cuz he was there when God created them God was there when that Lon was just a little tiny old little kitty cat this little fuzzy thing he held them up scratches he was there before the fall when the lion laid down with the lamb Daniel remembered that perfectly a lion why we used to go for walks with them i' take brother Bark's rod and go for a walk take the dog take the lion with me he was my body he could do that because he was there before the foundation of the world and for us to understand that we must be identified in Christ and Calvary and all that he did you know the Bible says this that we're already seed with him in Heavenly places and he conquered all the power of the earth and hell and we're in him watch what the Bible says you know I I already mentioned this but in Romans uh 3:24 and then in Romans 51 but in Romans 3 24 he said being justified freely by grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus but this one here brother Brown talks about more in Romans 51 he said therefore being justified by faith this is something that we need to stop and look at for a few minutes because brother Brown said you never ever did Sin and I never did either because see if you answer the question where were you when the sons of God showed it for Joy if you were in him and you came out of him God can't sin and God's word says that you are God Amen our message says that you're deity when they were going to throw ston you're looking at me funny when they were going to throw stones at Jesus Jesus said don't your own bible say that you are Gods the only God that the world will ever know yes is in you this morning I want to show you something in John in John 1 I believe it's 13 it says and the word became flesh and dwell among them I want to tell you something that the prophet said he said I can show you where he sent it and you try to show me where he took it away amen amen that's great and aen take it away when Jesus went back to heaven and the word became flesh and dwelt among them and the word is God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so when you become the word you are God in flesh today so God didn't change it the word in flesh is still here that's why he said that you were justified by faith and Justified means you never sinned in the first place oh this body did but this ain't me this was just a tabernacle that my spirit in indwelt in to come to Earth to prove to Satan that not all people would bow their knee To His Image that's ex that's 100% the Bible and the message amen 100% therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ that's understanding where you came from and when I understand where I come from it don't matter who shows me fiery furnaces or says God's not the same today or we need to see God I just showed you three amazing examples where people were going to have their bladder on their outside of their body where they wanted to do surgery where they couldn't identify cancer and where a hip was perfectly healed now like the doctors couldn't do that they're going to I met sister sarin's brother I was there when had a clean bill a house you can't take that away from me I was there before 10 million years before that am I was in him he's the same yesterday today forever he ain't nothing at all so none of these fireworks around that don't even fiz me because I know who my daddy is am amen that's how you have to be God says I God watch this God came to job and demanded this after him after he had already told Satan that he was perfect and you know what it was God wanted to hear out of job's own mouth what God already knew let let me read this God wanted to hear out of your mouth what he already knows about you God already knows whether you came from him or not he knows it perfectly he he knows your but he wants to hear what do you say what what did he say when they said who's the son of man what do they say I am and Peter said those you are the Christ the son of the Living God what do you say what do you say I demand of you where were you when I laid the foundation of the world I was there when he built Canada I wasn't in favor called North but I was there I was deal talking to one of the pastors we were there we we preached in five different churches and sometimes there was five or well there was at least one service there was six different pastors there in multiple churches and that was a beautiful form of unity and I was sending him some pictures yesterday I sent him a quote that came up to me and I said we we got a bunch of snow and it's fairly cold out this morning I sent him some pictures outside and he ran out the front of his house and he was showing me all the mango trees and all the palm trees and all that people saw wood and it you know I was there Hallelujah and you know if you were there and you were in them when the was slain before the foundation of the world you won't judge anybody not even the world not here because the Bible says that God would that all would be saved now he knew they wouldn't be because he was infinite but you know the Bible and I I preached on that a bunch when we were in El Salvador you know there's not one place in the message of the Bible where God gives us the right to judge in this earth you don't get the right to judge until after the Rapture and we sit on the throne with him then we judge the world but we'll be perfectly and we'll have the character to judge you you watch brother Bram brother Braham showed it his life how God God allowed Satan to tempt them to judge brother Brown never ever did it remember when he said to the people he said Satan's built a trap for you and they're going to make love on the front seat just imagine to the presence of God that's in this place today is no different than in the place when brother Bram was here I know you were going to think it was greater but it's not if you think it's greater you got respects to God and you're you're going to hell cuz it was no greater you know I I told them some pretty straight things down there I didn't go to Salvador to be popular I said we have a lot of things mixed up in our churches we have deacons that are throwing people into the church that the church is is a hospital you're throwing people out there coming for healing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're throwing them out you need to fire all your deacons and get converted you want to see the real Holy Ghost I forgive you what about the man that came up there there was nuts and he killed a bunch of people come up to brother Bram where were the deacons in that church they failed miserably oh bless God they should protect the prophet and the pastors scattered behind them like flies cuz they didn't know where they came from because they were fearful and he fell on brother bram's feet that's the kind of judging brother brandham did Amazing Grace because see he had that because he was there he was there when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and he seen the purpose and thought of God because he was in it he was there Hallelujah he said we stand perfectly before God Justified means that you never did it in the first place he brother Bram gives an example of somebody I I know you maybe heard this you know somebody would say I seen you smoking brother Bram and and I forgive you for smoking but brother Bram said forgive me what how could you forgive me I never did it I forgive you brother Dale for being who you are but this ain't even me I'm not going to be fighting Heaven this is just my Tabernacle here the prophet says he said Justified don't mean that you're forgiven you can't forgive something that I never did hello that's right how can you forgive somebody when they never even did it like so how can we judge when we're judging something that they never did wow God help us and he said you never did it because that little germ that was in you that little germ is who your daddy is that was to be you before the foundation of the world and see God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life and all the preachers in the world can't take my name out and they can't take yours out either and I will under any of them that tried to amen a thoroughbred horse knows who his daddy is that's right yes sir and a mule is the most illegitimate and wicked and sinful thing that was ever created God help us here the prophet says that Harmony now exists between the groom and his bride and he'll show her his word of life and she receives it just like the word was in marry and deity and we know what God wants done with it but just like when Jesus was here on Earth everybody judged all his decisions you ever wonder why somebody judges everything you do I wonder why you did that I wonder why you did that but you have the mind of God and you know exactly how to handle you do not just the pre I'm not talking about preacher I'm saying you the this ain't an elevated case ministers won't be higher in heaven it'll be brothers and sisters period we'll all be his wife period it won't be a bigger wife and a little wife that that's disgusting so when somebody questions well Wonder way you brother Berard I wonder way you know who it is Satan 100% Satan the Bible says that because you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost deities dwelling in flesh the word became flesh and never went away amen and he will fulfill his whole plan through us I mean the worldwide bride his whole plan he's fulfilling through you you you every one of you and the worldwide not just this church but I mean the worldwide bride God's working in you what it's what your hands do it's what your amen hallelujah John one John 1 John 3 1 and 2 behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we shall be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not that's not a big surprise a bless God we're not recognized in the because he knew him not if the world didn't know Jesus you know me you know I always said this I said this in Old Salvador doing a bunch of Miracles won't let the world recognize the Miracles won't recognize God that's Bible I give you two examples the Bible says let me show two examples when Israel came out of Egypt was there any more miracles created in that time when the let me see the Flies the blood the water the the serpent uh the help me out the darkness the the all the first their cattle their livestock died uh the firstborn died frogs okay and all those people just sat and watch it and they went wow that's right wouldn't that be cool would just cause flies to come to Wyoming and they all cross the Red Sea and curse God and a whole bunch of them God swallowed up and never even let them walk in the desert I'll give you another example would you like to see that brother Brown said when he identified Revelations he said when the Antichrist comes on the earth and they do signs and wonders he said that would be Atomic Warfare that was the United States that was the devil so if you're looking for me to just make your arm that don't mean nothing God can do it but I'm not if God does it or not that's his choice if God tells me to oh for sure I'll be the first I'll be on first base God's got that all ability we have to understand when Jesus went to the pool he healed one person he stepped over all the sick people and I'll be flat out honest with you if I would have been one of the other ones I would have been offended if I wouldn't have knew where I come from there wasn't one person that he stepped over that was offended if they knew who their daddy was amen Now Grant you be we see all these signs and wonders if you don't think so you should have been with me in El Salvador we see multiple Miracles we don't have to go to a Salvador we see them in New Foundland we see them here there's all kind kinds of Miracles sitting here my ears aren't bothering me this morning sister Patricia ain't taking a puffer this morning and on and on and on and on and on you you arrived here this morning you can actually breathe without thinking about it you woke up this morning said I'm really going to cut the figure it was God that give you your breath amen you have to understand who your daddy is verse two of John 1 1 John 3 beloved now we are now not we're going to be we are already if you know where you're come from we are now already the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him and we shall see him as he is amen amen amen I declare onto you what does men say that I the son of man am what do you say the question this morning isn't to the world the question is to you individually what do you say job and what does you say disciples who am I to you yeah we know the answer when je when Peter answered that he said blessed are thou Simon because nobody could have give you that Revelation but my Father which is in heaven that's right Galatians 32627 for ye are all children of God by faith in Christ Jesus and for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ and Christ is the anointed one Christ is God and if you be Christ then ye are Abraham's seed and HS to all the promise hallelujah amen I want to close with this just and and uh maybe we'll read the this last scripture but I want to close with you know we preached on when John looked at the son of man and he said it looked like unto the son of man it was because where were you were you there I was I was a good-look part that's all right the Bible says that he put his gown around him and covered her shame and it was the the golden ro ro tapped under his pops that's Bible where were you Revelations 1 11 and 13 saying I Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us write in the book and send this to the all the church ages and I turned to see a voice that spake unto me being turned I seen the seven good candlesticks seven Church ages it was one like on to the son of man that's because you were there you were there where were you what if if you don't know you were there you're in terrible trouble Hallelujah brother Brown said it was us in Christ his feminine side amazing amen you know things are not as they appear and you know even science will will will cannot prove everything here in Genesis 3:8 it said that they heard the voice of God walking and so when you're walking through your life and you're not even preaching you're talking because your walk God's walk in the Bible was a voice that the people heard but but you said but I thought I going to preach and be a missionary and be like go to the for no you could just walk amen amen where were you God help us to be able to answer that question I know for sure who my daddy is I know for sure that I'm not one of those Godless sinful mules that just wants to work and work and blot at everything you know brother Brown said I'm going to go back to that and close on that that's just you know he said some amazing things here he said a mule will say what do you mean the Where's God what what do you mean the Holy Ghost I don't know nothing about it see they can't see nothing they can't see who their papa is they they can't see their history I love this part he said if you don't know who your parents are he said you know a mule he said you never could he said he'll wait his whole life just to kick you he said that in 65126 in modern events made clear by prophecy that was literally like two weeks before he died he said I'm you wait his whole life to kick you he said that's right and you call him you say oh come on boy come on boy and he said he'll he hold up his ears and go honk honk honk like some of those that say God's not the same I don't see God he said those you know what he called those this is modern events made clear by prophecy 65 this is paragraph uh 219 he said those are half breed Christians they can't reproduce themselves they were half donkey and half horse and they don't know who their papa is they don't even know who they are brother Braham said those are half breeds supposed to be church members and Christians and they say oh that's that's not a joke he said that that's that's the truth he said if a genuine Thoroughbred brother he knows who his father is and his mother is and who his family lineage is and you can teach him something because he knows who his family is he's a gentlemen he's gentle and a genuine Christian that's born of the Holy Ghost and got God's power in the word he knows his father and you can teach him something but a mule forget it you're just like huh huh what day is it huh we're in the end time huh amen God help us I I find it amazing I want to close with this we maybe the musicians can come and that after God told Satan that job was perfect and God challenged Satan to try to try job because he knew where job had come from he still went back to job in Job 38 and said where were you were you in me God knew he was in them yeah yeah yeah I I want you to catch the scripture if you know God demands an answer I demand of you were you in me before the foundation of the world and if you were your worries are over your worries are over amen God bless you this morning God bless you amen it's it's amazing to know God's revelation and plan for us in this day and it takes care of everything and those that don't understand God will be the mules they don't know where they came from they don't even know why they come God help us to understand our Our Heritage that God give us just like in the New Testament he says who do you say that I am it's not important what the world thinks of God God's saying I demand of you you where were you when the sons of God showed it for joy and the Stars danced amen let's stand this morning God bless you I'll tell you where I was I was right there I was 100% there [Music] I praise God for that great experience and great opportunity to be in him before the foundation the world to be a part of him to understand all that he did thank you Lord Jesus and you can understand the same thing talk to your father say I remember see you can remember your past your past is great when you were in him that's right go away back go way way way way way back that's the past you want to remember you were perfect remember when Satan came to present himself to the Lord God told Satan that she's perfect Romans 8:30 says that you're already glorified the Bible says that you're already already how could you say I don't see it the same you're already sitting in Heavenly places what kind of a heaven are you looking for amen Bible says that we couldn't imagine or comprehend the things that he has in store for those that come from him that love him the only ones that will love God are the ones that come from him because the world said they knew him not because he wasn't a part of them amen you can't even imagine or comprehend man we we don't we don't we be a part of the family that's always doubting and questioning and and what God who God is that's not that's not what God has planned amen amen God bless you this morning in our eyes Lord we want to see Jesus to reach out and touch him and say that we love him open our ears Lord and help us to L open
