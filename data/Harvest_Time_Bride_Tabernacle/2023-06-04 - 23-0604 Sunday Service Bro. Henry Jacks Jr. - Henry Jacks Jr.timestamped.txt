[20:10] encourage you to just
[20:12] just eat the word it'll be wonderful
[20:15] because it won't be his words it'll be
[20:17] his God's words
[20:18] and it'll be just tremendous and man
[20:21] it's just good to be back in fellowship
[20:22] and also you can keep him and his family
[20:25] and prayer he's hoping to bring his wife
[20:26] over this summer and be with them and
[20:29] also sister Ruth is working on a
[20:31] permanent residence card for him so he's
[20:33] going to be our connected our right arm
[20:36] or something amen I told him this
[20:38] morning when we picked him up I said
[20:40] welcome home
[20:42] he's been visiting in Jamaica for a
[20:44] while
[20:45] but uh he he made it back home
[20:48] amen we love brother Jr and that just a
[20:51] few announcements
[20:54] before we maybe sing a song honey before
[20:58] we go um
[21:00] they asked us in Ottawa Camp
[21:03] um just how many were going now uh I
[21:07] realized some of you my own kids are
[21:08] staying in a uh you know off the
[21:11] campground and eating off the campground
[21:13] so I mean they probably just
[21:17] you know need to know for
[21:19] I don't know Insurance liability
[21:21] Campground chairs renting chairs
[21:24] whatever so if you're staying on the
[21:25] campground you need to register but if
[21:28] you're staying off the campground it's
[21:29] the only purpose is just for
[21:32] the Tabernacle you know somebody like I
[21:35] know my kids are saying a bed of
[21:36] breakfast or something so so they asked
[21:39] us to get back to them so if you can
[21:40] tell us if you're going to be at the
[21:42] Ottawa camp and also even John dankwas
[21:44] thing if you were being really a part of
[21:47] that you were supposed to register I'm
[21:49] not sure exactly how all the details and
[21:51] that but uh we're gonna be at John dank
[21:54] was on Sunday if you're just going to
[21:55] the service I don't think it's this is a
[21:58] important and also I want to say along
[22:01] that same line to camp in in
[22:04] Saskatchewan that uh the I I actually
[22:08] haven't got it posted but Vanessa has
[22:10] the details and I actually found out
[22:11] from Kelly hillebrand that camp is full
[22:16] but that only means it's full
[22:18] if you're looking for a cabin on the
[22:20] campground or if you want to eat in a
[22:22] cafeteria that only holds 500 people
[22:25] that Camp's not full
[22:27] if you want to go to it to church
[22:30] amen God provided motels and bed and
[22:34] breakfasts and restaurants and so you
[22:36] could go and stay in a bed and breakfast
[22:38] or a restaurant and come to the camp
[22:40] meeting for Cyrus
[22:42] and and uh and I I actually messaged
[22:45] Kelly Hildebrand and told him you know
[22:47] we're many were planning on coming and
[22:49] and it was filled up and he said oh it
[22:51] fills up way early just
[22:53] way early but that just means if you
[22:55] want a cabin
[22:57] or if you want to eat in the cafeteria
[22:59] so I mean if God permits you to go
[23:02] that's I think second week of July
[23:05] the Tabernacle will hold everybody
[23:06] they're not going to send people you
[23:08] know so I mean you could be there and
[23:10] fellowship in the Tabernacle it's just
[23:12] for the meals and all that and so I mean
[23:14] that's something we want to be a part of
[23:16] in the future of me and Mom aren't going
[23:18] this year specifically but we plan to go
[23:21] and and I mean if you got families or
[23:23] kids that
[23:25] go and fellowship with the bride of
[23:27] Christ man get a taste of Heaven here
[23:29] it'll be the greatest thing you've ever
[23:31] had amen and sorry for so many
[23:33] announcements also July 9th July 9th we
[23:36] have Joseph from uh Gerard Samuels
[23:40] Church in Toronto coming to minister and
[23:43] he's an evangelist missionary
[23:46] evangelist missionary I'm not sure which
[23:48] he travels a lot overseas South America
[23:51] brother Gerard is telling me different
[23:52] things that it happened actually
[23:53] brothers Jordan was telling me that his
[23:57] this last missionary trip there was
[23:59] people that wasn't even in the
[24:00] Tabernacle
[24:01] and actually heard the voice over the
[24:03] speakers that were healed to come back
[24:05] and testify until they were healed amen
[24:07] so he said he said so he's going to be
[24:09] with us July 9th and then also uh
[24:12] brother Ben was going to be with us in
[24:13] June and he had something come up in the
[24:15] family and he cannot be with us he was
[24:17] going to be with us on Father's Day
[24:19] and he's looking to reschedule sometime
[24:21] in July or August and I just want to
[24:24] reschedule a good time for each one so
[24:27] if you tell us uh I know our kids are
[24:30] going to Algonquin Park and so Brother
[24:32] Band will come
[24:34] it'll either be late July or August but
[24:36] I don't want to pick a weekend that
[24:39] um
[24:40] people are canoeing amen
[24:42] and uh amen and just just one more
[24:45] announcement is is more a prayer request
[24:49] and I had mentioned this before and I
[24:51] don't mean to take your time but we need
[24:53] to we need to to do this say man is uh
[24:57] we're just praying for
[25:00] God's will in the ministry amen
[25:03] and
[25:05] I personally don't have a Ministry to uh
[25:09] to be popular
[25:10] or I don't I don't have low self-esteem
[25:12] I never did amen I was never affected by
[25:15] peer pressure in high school so I don't
[25:18] mean that
[25:19] arrogant I just mean that's just reality
[25:22] amen
[25:23] but
[25:24] but me and my wife had plants we're
[25:26] going to Jose Garcia's Homeland in
[25:31] December
[25:33] and see his parents then that's the
[25:35] first of December and that's their
[25:36] anniversary means and I we committed to
[25:38] that when he went with us to Uganda and
[25:42] we we really do want to go to Uganda in
[25:44] February
[25:45] we just
[25:48] I don't we just like it there we like
[25:51] the people we love the people but
[25:55] so that was kind of our
[25:57] way of thinking
[26:00] and
[26:03] about a week ago
[26:06] in the period of
[26:08] about one week
[26:10] I had four pastors from the Philippines
[26:15] asked me to come this year
[26:18] and
[26:21] actually the fifth one
[26:23] told me
[26:24] two days ago
[26:27] and you know
[26:29] many people ask you to minister and you
[26:32] just you know you just you're not going
[26:36] but after four or five start asking
[26:39] in a short period and these are not
[26:41] ministers that knew the other ministers
[26:43] they're in completely different Islands
[26:45] they maybe have never connected amen and
[26:48] so we're just praying for for God's will
[26:51] um I I can't even afford to go let alone
[26:54] be gone and so God would God would have
[26:57] to do something it costs a lot to go to
[26:59] the Philippines if I if I win I'd want
[27:02] to go with my wife and and uh it'd be 10
[27:05] grand just for plane tickets it's just
[27:08] literally maybe more than that but uh
[27:11] but God can do anything and I don't even
[27:14] desire to be there
[27:19] I don't even desire I mean I like I like
[27:22] the Philippines I I mean I don't mean
[27:23] that but you know what I'm saying I'm
[27:25] happy to be here
[27:27] I love the Philippines but if God wants
[27:29] it so I literally had people
[27:31] it's from the south to the north
[27:34] literally as far as the East is from the
[27:36] West in the Philippines
[27:38] in one week
[27:42] and then I had another is it actually an
[27:44] evangelist called me actually our Taxi
[27:45] Driver an evangelist called us this week
[27:48] and you know so the first guy called me
[27:51] or something but when the fourth guy
[27:52] sent it through
[27:53] in about four days we were sitting in
[27:55] the living room I said wow
[27:58] what is God telling us
[28:00] amen what is God tell us you know and
[28:02] and I'm going to close with this you
[28:04] know you think your ministry is
[28:07] something super and that's just your
[28:09] thoughts and your mag I had I had
[28:12] somebody from Uganda tell me
[28:15] this is what touched him he said
[28:18] he said Dale
[28:19] when you were here
[28:22] and all we ministered and as good as the
[28:24] services were
[28:25] he said you preached on
[28:27] or you mentioned
[28:30] that you cleaned the church
[28:33] back home
[28:35] and he said you know I had to do
[28:37] cleaning
[28:38] and around the church and he said I was
[28:40] flat bitter
[28:41] above it
[28:43] just plain bitter
[28:45] because I was too good to run the broom
[28:49] he said now I cleaned the church and
[28:52] it's a worship service
[28:54] it's a worship service see you know you
[28:57] think wow it's just something bacon man

[29:09] not asking for anything but your prayers

[44:39] oh praise God when you are a son of God
[44:43] every Son of God God has to give him a
[44:48] seal
[44:49] Hallelujah
[44:50] Jesus Christ when he was walking on the
[44:54] hurt
[44:55] the Bible said in the book of Saint John
[44:57] 6 Hallelujah verse 27. when the Bible
[45:02] said it came to him
[45:04] and ask him a question from whence
[45:07] you'll reach here
[45:09] but early on the Bible said he was
[45:12] across the sea
[45:14] Hallelujah he was across the sea
[45:18] but he fed the multitude
[45:21] and after he fell he fed them they said
[45:24] this is truly the Messiah
[45:27] this is truly the Son of God so the
[45:30] Bible said they wanted to take him
[45:32] hallelujah's Force to become king
[45:35] but Jesus had to move away from their
[45:38] presence and the Bible said he went upon
[45:41] the mountain alone
[45:43] and his disciples were in the boat
[45:47] traveling over the other side of the sea
[45:50] Hallelujah and Jesus he saw what was
[45:54] happening to them in the sea then he
[45:58] stood and started to walk on water
[46:00] Hallelujah
[46:03] praise God so when they said from when
[46:07] she been here because they know that he
[46:09] was on the mountain
[46:10] and they were looking that there was no
[46:12] boat or could he reach here
[46:15] [Laughter]
[46:16] what could he reach here how could he
[46:19] reach a cross
[46:21] little they know that he was the god of
[46:25] the universe
[46:26] he could teleport
[46:28] they could walk on Waters he didn't have
[46:31] to use boats even after you submarine
[46:34] even after he was plain to do to
[46:37] transport from one side from one
[46:40] destination to another
[46:42] it was God
[46:43] he was God In the Flesh
[46:46] but he didn't answer them that question
[46:50] he said Hallelujah
[46:52] and the reason why you're seeing me is
[46:55] because you need Hallelujah you need to
[46:57] be fed again
[47:00] hallelujah what he said live or not for
[47:03] the meat that perish
[47:05] but for the me that Hallelujah that the
[47:09] father will give you that forever
[47:11] lasting life that's the meat that he
[47:14] must labor for what is the meat
[47:17] the myth is to do the will of the father
[47:21] Jesus said to the whom said to the
[47:24] disciples when he was talking Hallelujah
[47:27] he said I have meat to eat
[47:31] when they say come Masters here is the
[47:33] natural meat but Jesus said I am me to
[47:36] eat
[47:37] Hallelujah it is to do the will of him
[47:41] that sent me
[47:44] hallelujah praise God
[47:47] hallelujah amen but then he said to them
[47:52] he said the father said this seed upon
[47:55] the Sun
[47:58] and the seal means ownership
[48:02] the seal means security
[48:06] Hallelujah when God has seen you it
[48:09] means you are his
[48:12] God is protected over you
[48:17] God Hollow is obligated to keep you
[48:21] Hallelujah God is obligated to watch
[48:25] over you God is obligated to guard you
[48:29] Hallelujah because you belong to him
[48:32] Hallelujah he said Hallelujah in Saint
[48:35] John 10.
[48:37] he said none that my heavenly father
[48:40] give it to me
[48:41] shall not be lost
[48:44] he said there shall never be perished
[48:47] and the word perish means to destroy
[48:51] and he said no one can pluck them look
[48:54] at it they can never be destroyed
[48:57] and then no one can pluck them out of my
[49:00] father's hand in other words the father
[49:02] cannot lose you
[49:07] Hallelujah
[49:08] so when you belong to God he cannot lose
[49:11] you
[49:12] yes the world is gonna blow
[49:16] you're gonna experience some wins in
[49:18] your life
[49:20] but you know what the father is holding
[49:22] you
[49:23] they cannot lose you
[49:25] Hallelujah he's holding you
[49:28] though the wind's just blowing he cannot
[49:30] lose you
[49:34] no the shy has come upon you they cannot
[49:37] destroy you
[49:38] Hallelujah because the father I seal you
[49:43] oh Jesus am I preaching to somebody this
[49:46] morning
[49:47] am I helping somebody to understand
[49:50] the purpose of being sealed Hallelujah
[49:53] and when you're seen with God it means
[49:56] the fact action is upon you
[49:59] nature knows that
[50:01] [Applause]
[50:04] Hallelujah
[50:05] can I go a little bit further
[50:08] not just nature knows it but the devil
[50:10] knows it
[50:12] [Applause]
[50:13] [Music]
[50:19] of God upon you
[50:22] two things Hallelujah when the Sealy of
[50:25] God is upon you it means God knows who
[50:28] you are
[50:29] and also that the devil knows who you
[50:32] are because he's watching the seal
[50:34] [Applause]
[50:36] Hallelujah praise God so no matter where
[50:40] you go the devil knows that heard that
[50:43] you belong to God
[50:44] Hallelujah he knows who we are
[50:47] you thankful this morning that the devil
[50:50] knows who you are but the question is do
[50:52] you know who you are
[50:53] [Applause]
[50:55] Hallelujah
[50:57] God knows who you are and the devil
[51:00] knows who we are but you must know who
[51:02] you are
[51:05] Hallelujah
[51:07] praise God
[51:08] and once
[51:10] the devil did know who God is
[51:13] he knows who Jesus is hallelujah because
[51:17] there was a seal upon the father upon
[51:20] him that's why the devil said if no be
[51:23] the son of God
[51:26] God's command these tongues to be made
[51:29] bread Hallelujah
[51:32] praise God and the devil try to use the
[51:36] word
[51:37] Hallelujah so the devil will use the
[51:39] word to you as well because he did it to
[51:42] Jesus he has to do it to you again it's
[51:45] the same thing
[51:46] Hallelujah he's trying to use the word
[51:48] to the father
[51:50] Hallelujah but thank God when you are
[51:53] the Seal of when you have that seal of
[51:56] God you are carrying you're carrying the
[51:59] testimony of God
[52:05] you are the secret of God
[52:08] you are carrying the sacred of the
[52:10] father in your heart
[52:12] the Divine will of God
[52:14] Hallelujah and all of the son can know
[52:17] the Divine will of God because the son
[52:20] is in the bosom of the father
[52:22] the son is carrying the heart of God
[52:26] Hallelujah
[52:27] to the secret no wonder why the prophet
[52:29] said the Hallelujah the Bible does set
[52:33] the Lord
[52:39] because it is a secret
[52:42] it means Hallelujah the will the Divine
[52:46] will of the father she's carrying that
[52:48] Divine will of the father and the
[52:50] prophet said she knows hallelujah what
[52:54] to be done with that will that promise
[52:58] Jesus didn't know what Hallelujah Jesus
[53:01] didn't have to pray to the father said
[53:03] should I command these tongues to be
[53:05] made right
[53:08] Hallelujah glory to God
[53:11] oh praise God Jesus did not have to ask
[53:14] the father Hallelujah should I should I
[53:17] Cross My stones that he will give his
[53:20] Angel charge over thee no
[53:22] Hallelujah when you are carrying that
[53:25] seal of God that sacred of God you knows
[53:28] what God wants to be done with his word
[53:31] hallelujah you become the righteousness
[53:34] of God
[53:35] Hallelujah you become the mind you have
[53:38] the mind of the father
[53:41] when the Bible said he knows here 4 6 my
[53:45] people destroy because of lack of
[53:47] knowledge that knowledge wasn't speaking
[53:49] about head knowledge now
[53:51] come on now
[53:53] that was speaking about the Revelation
[53:55] in your soul
[53:58] the revelation of the father in your
[54:01] soul
[54:01] Hallelujah glory to God
[54:05] and God's people are carrying it because
[54:08] they are carrying the Sea of God
[54:12] and the Seal of God brings Hallelujah
[54:14] the Divine will of the father to them
[54:18] Hallelujah nature knows that
[54:21] that's why brother Paul said nature is
[54:23] waiting on you
[54:26] brother Paul never said that nature is
[54:28] waiting on the father he said he's
[54:31] waiting on the manifestation of the sons
[54:34] of God
[54:39] oh praise God hallelujah nature is
[54:43] waiting on us for the manifestation of
[54:47] God hallelujah don't wonder why the
[54:50] Bible said Oh Glory to God hallelujah
[54:53] when the Bible said you are glorified
[54:58] foreign
[55:03] to whom he justified he glorified
[55:07] Hallelujah
[55:09] and more Transfiguration we saw three
[55:12] things happening Hallelujah we saw the
[55:15] resurrection we saw a translation
[55:18] Hallelujah Moses types the resurrection
[55:22] Hallelujah
[55:24] the dead and the resurrection Elijah
[55:27] types the translation and Jesus types
[55:31] the glorified
[55:32] Hallelujah when he rose from the dead he
[55:35] rose with glorified body
[55:38] Hallelujah thus I was able to walk
[55:40] through the walls Hallelujah and appear
[55:43] before his disciples and they thought
[55:46] that he was a ghost Islam ghost
[55:49] proof give me some meat to heat
[55:52] Hallelujah listen you know what time
[55:54] must come here
[55:55] put your hands in my side
[55:57] Hallelujah so it's the same thing with
[56:00] the wife of Christ she's going to have
[56:03] us a glorified body
[56:07] Hallelujah can I preach to somebody this
[56:11] morning
[56:11] Hallelujah when the Bible said in
[56:14] Revelation 19 verse 11 and I saw heaven
[56:18] open up
[56:19] armies of God come and came and white
[56:23] horse

[57:20] different beliefs some believe that the
[57:23] whole entire 44 000 is the this
[57:27] some believe that it is the Jews
[57:30] right but I said I don't believe it is
[57:32] the Jews
[57:33] when you go back to Revelation 7
[57:36] the Bible is an oath of every tribe
[57:39] there were seal twelve thousand
[57:42] so the original 44 000 are Israelites
[57:46] Israelites because the Bible said they
[57:49] were seal out of the tribe of Benjamin
[57:52] out of the tribe of God under the tribe
[57:55] of Manasseh Ephraim twelve thousand and
[57:59] the word of God said not all Jews are
[58:01] Jews
[58:07] and I said if you go back to the Book of
[58:10] Esther yes it was too much but I have to
[58:13] nail this it Hallelujah in the Book of
[58:15] Esther the bombs are because of fear the
[58:18] people become Jews
[58:23] those are fair the become Jews that's
[58:26] why I've been a person not all Jews or
[58:27] juice not all Israelites are Israelites

[58:53] in the Book of Genesis 38. here was Jude
[58:57] and Tamar you know the story
[59:00] but
[59:01] Judah was to give tomorrow his last son
[59:05] Hallelujah
[59:07] praise God but Judah never keep his
[59:11] promise
[59:12] he break his promise
[59:14] oh God hallelujah do the types
[59:18] God he types Christ
[59:21] Hallelujah because God said God made a
[59:24] promise that out of Judah Hallelujah
[59:28] this shall come forth a lion
[59:32] they said the golden sector
[59:34] when when Jacob was on his dead belt
[59:38] dead bed he said the golden scepter will
[59:41] not depart out of Judah
[59:44] Hallelujah
[59:46] you know that scepter and Authority
[59:49] it represents the power of God
[59:52] Hallelujah and that power of God is
[59:54] living his people today
[59:57] Authority is living in his people today
[1:00:01] woman as always and will always types
[1:00:04] the church
[1:00:07] woman always types the church
[1:00:09] so tomorrow was a type of the church
[1:00:14] Hallelujah
[1:00:16] and here she was Hallelujah and the
[1:00:19] Bible said she was told that her
[1:00:22] father-in-law has gone up to timna
[1:00:26] and the Bible said she took off Earth
[1:00:30] with a garment Hallelujah she took it
[1:00:34] off
[1:00:35] you know that they have been identified
[1:00:37] because of their garment
[1:00:40] so is the wife today
[1:00:42] these are not our garments
[1:00:45] hallelujah our garments is the Holy
[1:00:47] Ghost
[1:00:49] hallelujah we're identify with our
[1:00:51] garments which is a Holy Ghost

[1:00:57] a garment and she put on the Garment
[1:00:59] upon a harlot and she went in the world
[1:01:02] and when Judah saw her Judah desire to
[1:01:07] come in with her but she said what will

[1:01:37] Authority
[1:01:39] what Judah had was braced it the Bible
[1:01:42] called it bracelet but in other
[1:01:44] translation it means Court
[1:01:46] it was used to bind the shape which
[1:01:50] represent a types of Love protection
[1:01:53] because when you're buying the ship
[1:01:55] you're protecting them especially if you
[1:01:57] have a sheep that is always trained away
[1:02:00] someday you gotta bind them to protect
[1:02:03] them from danger
[1:02:05] and the stop was also used to trace away
[1:02:08] wild base
[1:02:10] Hallelujah the Bible said Oh Glory to
[1:02:14] God and he gave me he gave her his ring
[1:02:17] which is his Signet Hallelujah which
[1:02:21] that ring represents Hallelujah
[1:02:23] ownership

[1:02:38] thing Hallelujah that Judah had in his
[1:02:41] possession and yet still he will he had
[1:02:45] to let it go so somebody didn't know
[1:02:48] come on

[1:02:53] believe God creates such an anointing
[1:02:57] not to let it go tomorrow was anointed
