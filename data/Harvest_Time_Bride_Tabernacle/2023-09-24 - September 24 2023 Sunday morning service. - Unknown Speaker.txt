water it meant eternal life we could ever contact your sweet Holy Spirit water [Music] Hallelujah will live will live Lord Jesus help me Jesus help us Lord [Music] thank you for your presence this is never to leave us or forsake us yes Hallelujah Lord never take your sweet Holy Spirit from us because of Disobedience Lord forgive us of our mistakes and our sins [Music] unless your beautiful bride of Christ here this day meet every single need Lord Jesus you know what was on each person's heart this week and as they came today Lord only in Your Divine infinite Glory could you meet those needs we pray for that this morning in your name was great amen amen hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus the opportunity to worship Him it's a thrill and the prophet said you know I don't come to church because I I don't worship God because I feel like I must have happened right just I I just love the worship you know I went this week because or last night the wind was coming back from her family reunion I went for a long long walk just praying that he would be here I'm nothing he's here oh man Lord and that's amazing I want to we will just read a couple of scriptures this morning I want to read psalms 42 7 and I want to preach on faith and I want to title my sermon he's there God is there just looking into this this God opened my eyes to something that shouldn't make each one of us just Rejoice on a container and it's just a very very simple thought but just a tremendous Revelation the Deep callethum to the Deep at the noise of the water spouse and all the ways and thou followers are gone over me Hallelujah let's turn over to John 6. and 44 John 6 and 44. no man can come unto me except the Father which has set me draw him and I will raise him up in the last day Hallelujah Lord Jesus we pray that you'll bless your word and may everything be done instead according to your plan we give you the glory for your name amen amen you may have receipts this morning just a great privilege this morning to minister for him and here we see in this chapter of David here reaching out the Deep color to the Deep here here David is is saying in the beginning of chapter 42 that all his heart yearned and longed to be with God and how his soul thirsted for God it's just this deep deep desire was a craving to God and you know in my study Bible and just maybe I'll pull it up jumping ahead you know the family of David had been in the temple and been worshipers and at this time they they weren't in the temple worship and David was longing for the closeness of God right he was longing he was remembering the good old days of his of his Christian wife and it was remembered how he was really remembering his first love right amen that's really what he was whenever he was remembering the fellowship and the communion that he had with Christ and he said and you know you read the jump and he said oh God don't need me completely don't never leave me this thirst is the non-believable cleanse amen a thirst for him and you know this was the Revelation that God it's just very very simple very simple thought but you know you can't be hungry for something unless first there was something there to satisfy that on you and the Very the very Revelation that you desire more of God or you desire something in your life proves that there was a god there not just to put the desire there but before he put the desire there for sure this weekend and many things wow you know our if we're going to look at some things that our Prophet said you know if God ever did something before in the past in his wedding and the same circumstances are met Duty bound and obligated to meet them again Hallelujah and you see all the Miracles if God did in his word you know if you're looking for a father he's your father and you're looking for a mother he's your mother he's your brother and your sister if you're looking for a mate this morning he's your man amen if you're looking for a family this morning he's your family amen hallelujah tremendous Revelation here the prophet the first thing he mentioned he said I was reading the other day of a little boy that was eating the races off his pencil in school and eating the rubber off his bicycle pedals right the doctor did his test and the boy liked sulfur and he said before that boyfriend praise offer he said there had to be a suffer to quench the third string in his body right now you just think of that spiritually he said now before you could crave the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a sweet Lord Jesus that can give you the baptism for the holy God Amen Hallelujah you know read it and study we might get to this this is the the the the the the word comes to me you know the the prophet says that every seed of God the word of God to see you right yeah Hallelujah and all you got to do is that promise and it's a hundred percent you won't even desire it unless God will give you that desire you won't even desire it unless God has the ability to create that desire to fulfill that desire oh man oh that's crazy good man amen hallelujah you desired your lost loved ones saved in your family station hallelujah amen there is a great savior let's give the ability to save your loved ones oh it's just beautiful amen anything you would desire God first made it possible for it to be there that's right and then he planted the desire in your heart for you to have that hearing questions and answers we see somebody came to brother around and he said I loved many years since sin brother Brown and he said God didn't forgive me but he said I had come and I've sinned again and he said I'm not worthy to even begin lies or to ask you but he said brother can you can you please help me can I possibly possibly be saved again Hallelujah this was an amazing quote for me he said it he said no there's a question here he said I didn't see it right away he said now if that person's here he said I want to answer this so beautifully for you he said he said I've lived in sin many years and I've sinned again he said yes you can be saved yes you sinned again my friend so far but God can restore you he said you've never sinned too far when you desire to be restored he said if you went too far you wouldn't even have the desire to serve him right that's amazing we think oh well you know I would like to be a better Christian that's because God predestinated it to me now all right I'd like to have a family that's because God predestinated you to have a family amen these are just mental dissemitism it was God before the foundation of the world made it available yeah it's beautiful amen hallelujah you desire to be in fellowship with him he said that's because he's putting along in your heart you see how David and this Psalm is just crying out to God and design why why can't I have that first communion of my first love like I remember in my past I want to tell you this morning you can you can but it's just entirely up to you it's not whether you have a good pastor or a good uh the bifold Ministry or even a good Bible or a good God those aren't the problem imagine a prophets we will look into that and talked many times about watering it with our faith our very own faith but he also said it I think he said 66 times that it it mattered on your personal person thank you right how big is your god it's just on the limits that you put on Christ that's it you know I want this but my Christ he can't do it because he's not that big to me amen oh God helps me amen God help you to change that that way of thinking that he could meet every need Hallelujah he said guilty he said here you hear the prophet the difference in this quote he said as long as there's something dealing with your heart then there's still a line of restoration he said guilty of the lease is guilty of the whole he said I sin many times talking about himself every day every one of us do something that we don't want to do he says that's it the proof that God's still dealing with your heart now I want to I want to look at this this is this should give many of us great great hope here he said there's a hunger for something there's got to be something somewhere or you would never have the hunger for it see no man come to you know we have we we think a lot of ourselves I mean that's just I mean that's I mean if you're a human right you have my opinion of yourself and if you're a Christian you'll have to always put that down and fight that yeah right the religion around the world thinks that now listen I'm brilliant I'm calculating decision and I chose to serve God that's hilarious to God when the Bible says that no man would even desire him yes oh Hallelujah so you see when you got that desire shows what God thinks of you it's not like for a chance those that I called I Chosen and I'm already glorified this is beautiful to me you know just drop the 103 here he says now before there was ever a creation there had to be a creator of the creation and so that's what I mean as long as you're wanting or hungry to get back to God there's a God somewhere calling you see or do you want to be hungry right there's the Creator there's a place that you cross where you can't get back but when you are at that down there again in the same shape you was it goes to show that you've only Fall From Grace he's talking about backsliding or leaving fellowship with God he says box living is not lost I love this part and then most of the world don't have this revelation backslidden is not lost he said I want somebody to show me somewhere in the Bible where backslund is lost he said it proves I said I can prove it in the Bible he says backsliding it's not lost he said it's just other Fellowship yes Hallelujah you could no more be lost if God could be lost if you've ever been in Fellowship amen you've lost your first love you've lost your desire what's your desire this morning all right I pray to God we're not just in a religious realm and just in a form and right but they never lost their Covenant yes yes they lost their praise what's your worship like David lost the joy of his salvation when he took Bathsheba but he never lost his salvation I mean Eternal will fall horrendous fall but David never said restoring my salvation he said restore me my fellowship the joy a boyfriend and he said watch how he closes he said now there's much of this legalism today he said touch not face not and he said don't do these things legally right none see God's in control of everything Amen in her heart and around amen God help us amen amen let's just look at here uh uh when when our eyes were open he said now we have all right then when we come to God to ask him for his help now I'm telling you this that the work is already finished your your plan for you it's already finished with survival declares that is finished he says arrest within your personal faith and the finished work of Jesus Christ if you need something this morning from Christ you can have it it's just do you believe that's that's just it do you believe what's the Bible say those that believe on me the Son of God they Shout he said what are Prophet teachers what is sin it wasn't all the attributes of sin it was just unbelief in him it was sin oh my amazing 66 times our Prophet mentioned your personal faith your personal relationship how big is your God Amen can he do it amen and we see this these calls the Deep here here before the foundation of the world God put something in us to pull us back that should make you crazy happy when you feel that when you when you vote and you're going to cut something and you just feel oh when you would say or do or take your thoughts and you feel something you should just go wow because I was God that put it there amen Hallelujah can you imagine I can can you imagine the people that could go out and commit horrific things and feel nothing right at all no check right and we feel those checks and because we felt them for so long I take them for granted that's helpless God help me amen see God Made A Way for us to be for you know the Bible says that I I know the thoughts that I have towards you God never intended you to live below your privilege he never give you a big bank account of all the promises in the word of God he never revealed the mysteries of them and open them to your eyesight for you to say Lord right yeah he did all that wow no he never did that see he said God here God set forth something that there was something to meet this something and it was the Deep to respond to the deal you know the prophet you know what I when I looked up and studied this scripture it was hundreds of times I think it was actually 89th I'm sorry that the prophet mentioned the Deep to the deep deep calls to the deep and multiple times early in his ministry he preaches of the pull of God in our life God help us amen God help us here in The Thirst in 65 here he's mentioned it David in Psalms 42 7 he says the need code to the beat the north of the waters Club he says he says see there had to be a fan on a fist fight to put them to be able to swim right he has to have the need for them did God put a need in your life that you needed God right and it's all you have to do is accept it amen and all your problems are over right amen we're the author of the god of the Prophet say he said the biggest enemy I got is me it's not your your enemy just look in the mirror that's all you mean wow what a revelation he said no if that would say that I'm going to become a different fish and I'm going to become oh wow just think of this on a human realm because I'm going to become a smart fish I'm going to educate myself I love that God's just upstairs just killing himself laughing he says yep I'm just gonna go and believe some other Theology and believe that I don't need to be past this feeling he said he won't get very far in the water I won't get very far right I wonder if that's the problem with the church today you know our Prophet said in studying this week he said the the greatest hindrance in the church today is because we've never took the last Commandment that Christ Jesus gave us before he left here he said we've done everything but uh did we build hospitals we'd build schools we bought new cars we've sent but he said just go into all the world and preach to God right just Minister you didn't just Minister me all right go freeze to me God help us God help us to be in a state where we can feel and be led by his leadership right you know you know when we we mentioned that that's just I believe I mentioned you know I had a pastor mentally from India this week and I'll tell you what we're supposed to pray that that God guide us all he's everything we're nothing without nothing nothing believe me I wouldn't want to step one step out of his will some of these people ask me hugely to come say what can I do without God they say no I don't know should I go the only thing I know is that I should minister yeah I tell you what the call is great but the workers are for you the genuine workers are few you know this pastor again most accepted literally probably a hundred pictures and videos and he said every one of their churches were maybe just no buildings at all I said most of our complete churches meet other truths they said most of the people in the church if they have enough to eat wow we have beautiful buildings and beautiful places beautiful cars to go you know God said we'll be judged for that says you know look at look at the queen look at the queen that went across the desert on a County no air conditioning no cushion scene no 64 adjustments on your seat robbers pirate robbers in the desert to Rob everything they took because she took her ties and offerings with her and she wasn't even raised Christian but she seemed so she felt something God help us amen you know it just you know talking to you know I just those things affect me because if you're the bride of Christ you're going to spend eternity with those brothers and sisters now I just want to know how comfortable are you going to be sitting next door to them anyways it affects me in fact you know had a pastor from Uganda message Man one of his deacons been a deacon for years that they they fight the the mosquito and malaria huge domain he said they expect all their income all summer like malaria in the kids the dead that keeps the sick went to hospital they they said yeah you're sick he sent him out without one single pill for malaria and he needed three dollars and 50 cents Canadian and he would die just you don't have three dollars I I can't comprehend that I cannot read it how do I get around that but if you feel so it's the Deep yeah the Bible says when you help those this is this is predestinated bride of grass yeah yeah right he said you actually give to God you actually learned to God it had nothing to do with the flashlight the x is born on you actually the Bible says you borrow money to God wow wow I just are we really do we deserve what we are do I disagree oh Jesus help me be worthy I mean you can help me amazing God help us he said Mike this uh this thirst Toby said you know he said before there was a tree before God made a tree he said there has to be a nurse the girl's a tree and he said that's right he said I suppose that if the tree decided it wanted to be a unique tree and a very uh to to fight the the the the common God predestinated plan the tree could say now I don't want to be planted in Earth I wonder if sometimes we have our spiritual life like this we are fighting what God has predestinated for our life there's no God I don't want to go your way I know you plan that I can planted here in Wyoming in the Earth yeah yeah but I don't want that I want to be planted on the road in another place you know what he says you want to live right now it was a part of God's plan he said when the deed calls the deed he said it's not joining our church he said it's not taking a preacher's hand he said it's more than living good and a nice clean straight life he said it takes something to satisfy that inner longing for God and he said is when God Pours Down and draws you to himself we should you know when we feel that we should just go wow wow why me Lord I was singing that song we're getting the feeling I couldn't remember the words what did I ever do what did I ever do to deserve you guys oh man he said the Deep gone to the need he said it's the noise of the Waters of other sins of God's holy spirit drawing you strong is pulling you up to your life that he had planned for you amen be found the foundation of the world now I want to look into this and and see you know it's based if we got to make this personal this relationship with Christ has to be personal and so it's based on your personal faith but I want to show you some Faith some some uh some examples here of God and the repetition of God if he ever did it one way he'll do it again always so if you can see an example in the Bible say God I'm not woman all right I'm just making amen just change the name and the same God is dutely bound to respond to his word he's watching some Jehovah driver he said if God ever healed a man face up uh on on the faces he healed the model he said he's got to heal the next one when he comes to the same place if he didn't he acted wrong in the first place then the decision he made was wrong but that's not possible we're serving a an infinite God you know the problems of this he said you know we grow in knowledge and wisdom and we make better decisions we get this stuff that's golden white hair amen right but God was born he was the guy he was the chance from the beginning right he don't get a better idea all right amen if I had only none that's not God Hallelujah he said if he ever makes a decision he has to stay with it and if he doesn't then it made a wrong decision who can say that God made a wrong decision you can't say that so you can line up your own personal in the word of God and say God I fit exactly in this round what about me that is just your faith to accept it it's not a problem with God amen does God change his mind because here here in the 65 40 said because if God ever makes a decision he'll say with that decision and each time the same problem comes up he said he's got to act the same way he did the first time or reacting wrong the first time so if you give me something to have base it on your faith I'm trying to show you this morning if you would long for something in your life and it's scriptural it's just it's this simple amen it's yours yes amen it's completely yours if you can believe it amen and if you can't believe it it's offended God help us see God is infinite he's perfect and if God ever does anything see if he just remember now if God ever does anything and the way he does it he can never change that because you see he's powerful man the thing that was just so amazing to me was the very desire that you have for God what's God given amen that's right the very desire you have that these things that are scriptural amen was given to you by God and you can't get up yeah how's that possible God give up and he provided them for you and he actually put it in your word we're going to read that scripture where where the word of God is deceased just like we were believing for babies he said every seed will bring forth of its time amen that's that's his scripture he gave you a hunger for a family said happy is the man who's forever is full but but God will it's just child like we got the kingdom of evidence like children I mean there's an openly believe yes I hope they don't lay away good night wondering if they're gonna have a home or food or or shelter or care but we later went good night wondering if God couldn't provide oh my goodness you know here we have too much faith in our government not enough faith in our God we really do that's the curse of North America rich countries just remember the government the safest government no matter which parties in controlled by Satan until the Millennium he got that right I don't like that either but this time he's influenced life it's unbelievable you know I I don't know where this is coming but I'm trying to I'm trying to raise your faith in God and take your faith away from the government I was watching videos this week some of them I put on Facebook and and it's amazing when people are afraid to uh uh associate with me because they think I'll be home and that's all right if God is after that it would be fine you know I was trying to show you this you know when Nixon was in brother Brandon voted for Nixon by the way when Nixon was in I believe it was Nixon that God yes thank you sorry uh I I can show you these videos when Nixon was in he called the the the behind the scenes government you know I had a brother and I gotta go see him they came here the vet you know and he told me a long time ago he said yeah all the governments are the same you know so I would say well this one you know like they were kind to Israel with that and they are like somewhere and you know I want to show you something there's a government behind the government so Nixon went to the to the what did you say of the FBI it might have been somebody else and they say I know for a fact who killed uh Kennedy and the FBI broken to the White House or wherever the papers were the very next day and five men broke in and four of them worked for the FBI and sold them and then they confounded the story to get Nixon kicked out and the Very person that they put in Nixon's place was the FBI worker right and you can say well that's not true he said you know they have never released the documents of Kennedy ever for the public you know why because it was the government that did it and we're like oh I love my country blessed God I think I'll go fight in the army yeah I don't think so I ain't fighting in no government already for the devil when this was came to me you know never in history before or since did a president get more votes than Nixon he got I think it was it was tens of millions more than as close as him and the Very truth that he was going to reveal now first off I want to back up and see first off the reason the government had to kill Kennedy was because he made the Kennedy money and he was going to leave the world back get all that money is still in circulation it actually has his name right on the bottom of it he was killed about four a singular like a handful of days after he made the speech and he said this opportunity to make the speech I'm not I'm trying to lower your faith in the government and raise your faith in God I'm not talking politics Kennedy said now that I'm in leadership I see that there's a force behind the scenes and I'm in a position that's what he said to kill that force and say sorry period as the last day 70 years later they've still not released the documents to that and that Nixon comes up was the greatest election of the choice of the people and he admits that he knows who it is and because he would reveal that to the people and there would be a revolt you think you got a grill a lot of those guys I know I don't want to be an American I want to be as far away from America as possible I praise God every time I come out of that country I'm shocking but it's the truth I need to suffer because Christ is your only hope amen Christ is your only hope he's everything amen forget about the government of the land it's God all right all right [Music] amen you'd never go to work again in your life if you knew what you were paying taxes to me amen God help us instead of a man never got sick and calls on God and if God ever heals one person the same drowns that he brought that men to the healing that if he's God he's called on it again amen amen well let's just talk about babies for a minute remember the woman that took was kind to the prophet yes right and the prophet said why are you being so kind building a home on a room and you know support my Ministry and be to me and giving me nice about it and all that said could I do something for you and the workers of the Prophet said now she's back and now in that day that was a tremendous shame and the prophet said he said woman about 12 months from now [Music] now A man was sick a woman was sick and he ever healed a person on the same ground said he brought Batman for his healing if he stopped he's ever called us again if he's ever called on again that he's got the man the same decision the exact same decision oh right you just say God amen wow thank you Lord Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever if God ever makes a decision and does anything one time he's got to do it again the next time exactly amen if you feel that it's given to God and before you feel it God's already made the provision for the attribute of the feeling let's start that's amazing amen hallelujah hallelujah here at Fellowship says the reason the church is in the fifth place among religions as it comes to numbers it's because we fail to do the Commandment that God did this is a fellowship message he said the last words that Jesus gave was going to all the world of preaching us that's why I say if you pray for me pray for God to lead us in guys it's I'm happy here but if God wants you to go somewhere else just make it wide open like you know what I like easy decisions just like girls who've been feeling fulfilling the scripture all right here here's the scene on that and this is a good one for us to lay down in our hearts the word is the sea but the seed won't grow unless it has a place of right kind of ground amen no matter how much seed you got what we got a lot of word we got the message of the hour okay I just no matter how much seed you got which is a word if you're afraid if you're afraid to sow it afraid to sow it he repeats that afraid he sends afraid three times let me go back to this he says if you're afraid to someone three dots in paragraphs afraid to soul and then you've got a dash afraid the sea will do you no good amen amen amen do we have the word of the hour yes [Music] that in itself should make you lose your mind that God loved you enough to send a message or prophet in this day and just take those things that I had no idea what until this message I didn't understand predestination I never even believed I never knew it was a goodbye did you know the mystery of the garden did you know that you shouldn't get baptized in the tree did you understand the god and it won't do you one bit again if you're afraid ouch that one just missed it yeah other rip ouch he said but listen to this every word it says every word of God is a seed Jesus said so and every promise of God will come to pass he said in every promise of God will come to pass if you'll receive it and are afraid and don't doubt it amen please place this in my oh and can place it in your heart sorry believe it came from God and water it with your faith so if you need something in your life just just put it on the body don't count it just dead man you stay up not yet but you don't have to worry about the seed growing it's God it'll grow the germination you know when I keep seed I keep seeing on the farm because I'm not a as much of a hybrid farmer as modern Farmers so I keep my needs and seeds in that and I remember as a kid you know my dad would count out 100 beans put them on in that paper and put them on a plate put them in the window then count out how many sprouts because I didn't pay nobody fifty dollars a bag for a unit for some kind of Roundup breaking poison that's gonna make your ears fall off so I test my germination yeah yeah and if you've got no germination and you really want to use the seed then you don't want to buy that poison stuff called hybrid you just turn up the quality a little bit yeah but you don't have to do that with God number one you don't have the best God because he's already proven all right at number two you're never gonna have to turn them up because you will lose your mind just at the regular rate yeah Amen in a spring forth of its time don't never forget this statement No this is our Prophet Brethren and fellas so don't never forget this statement he said make this I make this from my heart I believe it I believe he said the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring you to pass amen amen remember the prophet when she when when she had Prophet The Prophet the mother of the Prophet salmon she said God if you give me a baby man I promise I promise I'll give a great back to you in your service you think I can't either oh my goodness oh don't insult my God that's just if you say God you give me a mental I'll raise everything about you to be anything you want to be in his life to either be a minister or finance a Ministry and fulfill your commandment of going to all the world and preaching us for what our Prophet saying he said if you can't go yourself then send somebody right yeah [Music] you know I talked to Junior you know like I announce our meetings come out in November third fourth and 5th and I communicated with Junior Henry's Pastor multiple months it was in sentence of voice things and oh it was it was just like God brought something for me when I get off I was maybe 100 sure before but when I got done I was 100 sure you know after we had arranged for him to come he sent me another message and just could just confirm you know just confirm it's like this is like the guidance sir brother Matthew we talked this week no we didn't talk this week we talked a week ago this week I sent you the information for the poster right that's not fine and it stopped me yeah yes that's amazing we need to recognize that Jehovah is in our presence he's in our lives we don't come to see each other although we love each other dearly and we hate to be apart but that's God it's completely Hallelujah thank you Lord hearing amen God is amazing amen and God is behind this word in the word of God will bring it to the Past that's what it says amen thank you Lord here we see in Hebrews 11 1 he says now Faith is the substance of things over and it's the evidence a thing's not seen now Faith has a backbone hold on it's like well I hope it don't rain today tomorrow or I hope you know no no they think like Coke right I mean we have a great hope but faith is unknown right it's a commandment he says speak and go forward right and not just like the prophet he said if you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost why crying out to me you already have a mind of Christ you watch this you know and I'm saying this and said he said look at all the attributes of God he had him a father and a Healer and a savior and a and all these things and you in Genesis 1 27 were made in the image of God do you think you're going to be any different Hallelujah you're gonna have that same attributes as your father and he's already there to fulfill him amen oh it's beautiful yeah thank you Lord Jesus amen in the message I will resources the Lord Jesus said every word is a seed he said is that right the sword went forth and so in the scene he said I am the son of man that sowed the seed and the seed is the word of God and every time you see the Bible says anything it's a seed it's an absolute every seed of Frankfort is time you'll bring forth Holy Ghost spelled babies amen and you are so the incorrupt the fuel if we're sowed in The Incorruptible seed of God and if a man will take exactly what it says to do he said now if you'll plant that seed and then go out every morning and dig it out well I'm not sure God I can't see God in my presence well first off we need better eyesight amen you need the worldly skills of later to see the fall off your eyes and and your spiritualization comes out yeah and then you won't be no wonderful good because you'll be dancing in the spirit right amen he says now if you plant the seed and then go out every morning dig it up and say see it's growing it'll never grow yeah that way he said plant the seed water watch what he says commit it to God and leave it at God's door amen God's there he can easily take care of it amen and you don't have to check on God Hallelujah God help us to be in a place yes sir where we can hear his voice and respond to it and not have to be you know there is a time when the Bible says that God will not always strive with men and if you feel the tug if you feel the pull if you feel the deep tunnel to the D I would really encourage you when you go home read psalms 42 it's only about 11 verses but it's it's just David beside himself consumed with the worship of God and who he is I'm telling you what you know when I the more that we grow spiritually the less the things just fall off me I I get so I know the Earthly good amen I could be in I was you know this week I worked a couple week Fields just a couple week fields and I I have I almost had that song Down path he's the same guy I could sing that song and just weep and attract Ive just for me but we've realized that he said exactly the same guy that spoke to the woman after a while right he's exactly the same guy whose wonders are too many amen the same God who parted the Red Sea oh and he said this is the exact same God in all those churches exactly the same God Reagan Cyrus and it's bubbling like that that adhesion woman just like I don't know what's gonna go like something's gonna blow [Music] wow there was that many clubs with this quote that you know there was a time to brother Brandon's Ministry where he was ministering and he told he felt the Holy Spirit tell him to do something and he obeyed and he went to that person and the person insulted the prophet he did the exactly the correct thing he said woman God told me to do that tell you what when we get to the place that you can step out and say God totally that is mine whoa buddy this lady rejected she rejected the book and the prophet was back in that town many years later remember how he gave the examples of death the trees want to live on the road the fish want to live without a fin and you won't live without Christ right you'll die it was back in that town later and he never even recognized the person but she recognized him because see he still looked like Christ oh oh that's just amazing Hallelujah and she said prank your boy you remember me and he said no she said I'm the woman I'm the woman that you came and spoke to and I insulted you and she said I'm here to tell you today that you were right because God was dealing with my life and God was God the Deep was called to the Deep and and it was Poland and they said water spout God was reaching down for them the bull in my life and she said you told me that and I insulted you and she said when I rejected God that last time that was my day that was my day Church don't miss your day don't miss your calling don't miss your election he said this he says this and I don't have a great point he says never shut the Holy Spirit never shut him down you'll only shut him down one too many times I don't have it right here but that's I have it here I just don't have anyone just never shown you're not that woman told the prophets that I can see my mom fry in that I wouldn't even because God was reached down in Amazing Grace trying to pull her to himself and God will not always strive she slammed the door and he was on the outside of her knife forever she said I could no more be saved today than anything because she rejected the Deep caused that idea she said she told me the truth then she said my heart has been so hard since then that very night she said here is the remarkable oh I said maybe a little wrong she said I see my mom fry in hell like a pancake I don't ever want to get close to that kind of environment I just want to say yes Glory you want me to go somewhere if you want me to go to Wyoming to preach I say yes Lord you want me to go to the pig pen to pretestly yesterday you want me to go to the preach under a tree I said yes Lord I don't know how I'm getting there but I just don't think you want me to go to India Philippines Pakistan you know I only tell you that not because it's it's God and and I we need God I need God's leadership I have people ask me to go to Pakistan Philippines had another Minister this

never once loved Pastor Sandman wow do you hear God's call are you doing what he wants for your life I want to hear a skull I want to be again I want to be so consumed with this Holy Spirit but I'm not even in this Thursday I just want to lay down homelessness please please when you go home read psalms 42. it's amazing you'll just see how David is just yearning and just crying just possible for God back to his first love it was David being passionate back to what he remembered the feeling was like and the worship because they were separated in the Old Testament you have to see now in the Old Testament we're not we're under grace now we're in the New Testament but they were separated from the Tabernacle and so it was just like God was a long ways by Amazing Grace we have a perfect sacrifice in this age and God will never be a long ways away from those that are calling feeling his blood and I want to leave you with this one last promise if you feel something it was God and the same feeling you have God's already provided for the feeling you have that's amazing see if you feel that you want your loved ones safe what is God and he's already saved him in his house it's already finished because he knows when they're coming how the date and let me get this let me do this you wouldn't even have felt that desire if your lovers all right [Music] that's amazing how the same God
