Holly I pray Lord Jesus your bless these beautiful people ones that have come Lord they've come to fellowship with you like the disciples on the road to Damascus May our hearts burn as we talked to

hallelujah it's wonderful to be here praise God we just tell you this morning we love you and you just make us feel happy and we love him most of all man God bless you all we also thank you for your love and prayers and support for our trip to Uganda and I I know you understand believe we're not doing it for no popularity contest that's that's for sure not the case and uh we just pray that the people there will be just greatly just greatly touched by God by God and man we want to continue on part two of the Gentile age and the Bride of the Gentile age and I just would say that this has just been just overwhelming and thrilling to me and and God has been gracious and just very gracious and just just uh you know uh we're definitely in the last days the prophet said that in the 50s and 60s amen tremendously but you're seeing something and we're going to show you I'm going to show you in the the the Bible and the message but we're seeing something in the last days that is just Supernatural amen and it but it's partying the church it's see God was a separator hey man he said come out of her my people and be I I can't hold this no longer let me share this with you you know we preached on not that long ago that the prophet said that we know that Daniel was the first prophet to the Gentile age we know the Gentile age started with Prophet worship but at the exact same time I when Satan comes in like a flood God will raise up a standard against you exact same day that part of the church was Worship in Daniel God was showing visions and dreams and Supernatural Revelations and Daniel could interpret the Unseen written hand on the wall the same day and that's happening right now and the same message you'll have people worshiping man and you'll have people where God is pouring out his spirit and Revelation and you're interpreting the unwritten word to the point that's never been seen before oh wow let's turn to Revelation 10. we're going to read verses 1 and then we'll just for time we'll jump to five to seven just uh I pray you will help me pick up my thought and God will help us pick up our anointing and this will be part two and I'm sure it'll be a part three next Sunday or we're going to really have to preach like a machine gun amen you know our girls they were when they were gone was whatever they were gone last Sunday was it last Sunday they went to a shooting range amen and this is what it's like when the people really pull on the preacher they went through a shooting range and they shot some guns that were not semi-automatics but machine guns and there was only one bullet to hit the target off and that was the first one because I was told when Sister Amy shot the machine gun held the trigger then it went a man but that's like the Revelation the anointing man when it's just coming and coming and coming amen amen it's beautiful amen Revelations 10 1. and then to five and seventy men amen and I saw another Mighty Angel come down we know this was Christ God himself came down from heaven clothed with a cloud amen and a rainbow this happened in our day upon his head in his face and was as it were the Sun and his feet were pillars of fire now this happened in our generation let's go to verse 5. in our generation just think of how much God loves you and the angel which I saw stood upon the sea and upon the Earth this was taking control and dominion over all of Satan and we're going to show you how God's kingdom and Daniel how Daniel's seen this over the years and he lifted up his hand in heaven and he swear by him that liveth forever and ever and who created the Heaven and the things there are in and the earth and the things that there are in and the Sea and the things that there are in that there should be eternity time no more hallelujah oh wow seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound this is in our day the mysteries of God the unwritten word and the written word shall be finished as he has declared it to his servants the prophets Lord Jesus we pray you'll come in this place and you take complete control Lord Jesus and we just love it Lord Jesus that you'll Minister the word this morning to your bride of Christ that you purchased with your blood before the foundation of the world we give you the glory and honor for it in your name we pray amen amen you may have your seats amen yesterday and you know just in studying the preparation you know you know our Prophet said that we need to come to the point where we recognize Who We Are we need to come to the place that we're positionally placed and you need to you're insulting God to not recognize who you are you say how that's possible because you are taking his name if you if you as a father had a had a wife or a daughter or son or anything and can you imagine that they wouldn't recognize that they were part of your family can you imagine you would just be like destroyed and now just think of Jehovah God you know I want to give you an example a best example of this here here David was a little pipsqueak uh not important his dad didn't even recognize him as as uh you know uh wasn't even considered in the anointing of the prophet Matt he wasn't the the dad never even mentioned him until pushed too pushed man oh it's beautiful and here David becomes anointed like Christ's bride is Anointed right now on this age it could it be any more anointed when God himself came down he didn't send an angel he didn't sign the important person he didn't just send a five-fold Ministry he came himself himself and deity and he told the prophet he said just turn that cloud to the right whoa just turn it to the right you know that was Unwritten word show me that in the Bible but it was spiritual revelation amen and here David and I'm I don't I I don't even have this I actually put it on a message that I might preach to you conduct but it's a lot this is free here David was the anointed king and the prophet said in God's eyes he was already sitting on the throne here he was ready for his life doesn't a running for their life they're running away from their domestics are running away from the the politics for sure if you're not running from nothing else you're running from that here David was running for his life and he was anointed Jehovah King before the foundation of the world and he had no Throne no Army no Kingdom no subjects nobody that was bowing to him sound familiar I know there's a bride on Earth that the Jehovah God came down in our day to take the scales off your eyes so you would recognize just a little bit he's trying to make your face grow beggar and you're anointed and he's got a throne right beside him in glory where the smallest squirt in this church WIll judge the world oh oh man oh man oh man oh man can you and you come to church so with your hands you go oh my goodness your car should be running on ethanol Holy Ghost ethanol amen I think about that he was running for his life he was anointing through something that he didn't have he was anointed through he didn't have he didn't have he was anointing to run an army that he didn't have he was anointing to subjects that he didn't have his own his own people refused them David's David's first Army he weren't even Israelites the ones that went down got the water out of the well weren't even Israelites hello hello help me preach oh my Hallelujah wow you know and let's let's Amy we need to pull up some of these scriptures because they're too good and you know this is just uh it's good enough that we're going to dig into it in Psalms 46 6-11 here here's God Talon and and prophecy what's going to happen to the kingdoms of the earth and then we're going to read it in Daniel and just while you're pulling that up I Psalms oh here we go and and the Heathen raised and the kingdoms were moved the kingdoms that ain't God's Kingdom and he uttered his voice in the Earth no amen look out when God takes his bride the Lord of hosts is with us you know amen do we believe some of these words amen you don't have to have Revelations to understand this you just got to be able to read the god of Jacob is our refuge Sheila oh Hallelujah come Behold The Works of the Lord what desolations has he made in the Earth and you were worried about what's going on he make his Wars to cease until the end of the Earth and he breakth the bow and he cutteth the spear to asunder and he burneth the Chariots with fire atomic bombs be still and don't listen to the news amen that's definitely preaching to brother am I you know don't waste too much of your time worrying about these kingdoms because they ain't going to be here and all that time you're worried about those kingdoms if you watch anything about those kingdoms it should just be saying well he's probably coming tomorrow I said probably be still and know that I am Jehovah God and I will be exalted among the heathens that's why Daniel's seen a rock cut out of the mountain without hands and I will be exalted right on Earth wow one more verse the Lord of hosts hey this he said this already you know if I preach the message twice you'd say oh brother Dale he must not be studying and he preached last Sunday's message this Sunday because God never gave him no fresh anointing but they just said this last verse do you think God wants you to know that and the Lord of hosts is with us not in the Rapture he's with us right now and the god of Jacob is our refuge Sheila you know in Daniel and you can pull this up Daniel 7 and I'm not going to read these all but in Daniel 7 from verse from verse 3 to verse 8 Daniel sees in the vision and he sees all these beasts rise up amen all these great beasts and I praise God for a prophet and if you go and you look at these through the message Hub our Prophet said that these beasts and then in the end of that there was four beasts blew up and then in the end of Daniel's Vision in verse 8 there was a Great and Mighty Beast to come up amen I tell you what if God if God keeps preaching to me like like he's been we're going to stay in Daniel for a while these beasts are all satan amen wow and a Great and Mighty beast that's raised up at the end is no less than Lucifer through Rome but all the other beasts were great kingdoms on the Gentile age since the time of Christ and they were just different faces on Satan so one Beast come up in the Roman time when Jesus was here one come up in the Greek time when Jesus was here what Jesus was eating here sorry and Through the Ages and all these different beasts but thou in our time there's a Great and Mighty beast but at the same time that Satan has got a Great and Powerful Beast and they got the gold Of The World God owns everything and he just shoots like he said Don't Fear communism there's just a puppet in God's hands well Rome is just a puppet in God's hand and they think they're controlling the strings of the puppet show with literally Jehovah God just has had them stored his gold for them because that same Daniel seen a vision when the Stone come out that hit the feet of the Statue of iron and clay and destroyed all the kingdoms on the Earth well we got time to read Daniel 7 9. because the picture has changed and I beheld till the Thrones were cast down that's the kingdoms of the Earth and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was wide as snow and whose hair on his head was as pure as well and his throne was Fury Fury aflame and his will was as Barney fire and this is immediately the vir index verse where he's talking about the Beast and our Prophet said that every one of them was a manifestation amen there's one Kingdom that's an everlasting Kingdom amen and he owns all the Atomic Warfare wow amen hallelujah the Saints of the most high is the only Everlasting Kingdom Acts 2 16 and I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and my sons and my daughters will prophesy and my own men will see dreams and you're a young man divisions that's this morning Joel 2 8-32 let's pull that out Joel 2 and I'll just paraphrase one of the verses here it says and it will come to pass that whosoever that whosoever belongeth to the bride of Christ they're the only ones doing this that whosoever was predestinated before the foundation of the world because the Bible says that no man sought God and no man comes to the father except first he whoops draw him in up the street where the cars are going really fast Hallelujah that whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord so worry about the wars in the world no oh no no no no that was the new IV version shall be delivered you're already but I'm going to show you a quote no I ain't going to show you a quote sorry I'm kind of kind of I was putting a message on my iPad for the Philippines I'll show you a quote from my Philippines or for the Uganda sorry just as God had already recognized David as on the throne in Romans 8 I believe it's about 20. God had already already passed that already past this glorified you on his phone and you say but brother Dale I'm running for my life you're running for your life just let go and be still I want to tell you this morning that it ain't because you're nothing in yourself it's nothing but Amazing Grace from Jehovah God himself but every single Kingdom and every single person and every single demon will bow before you yeah before you because our Prophet said that the king and the queen if you ever get that you'll lose your mind the king and the queen will be on the throne together and you ain't judged in the weight Throne judgment so when every knee bows you've already bowed by choice well by predestination Sorry by predestination so when every need comes up and they bow before a Jehovah God they'll be bowing before the queen and you thought you went to a small Church you thought you did but our Prophet said he's seen millions and millions of people there wow you know the rapture is a change in disposition and we know that the prophet said the Rapture is going on right now brother Dale's already raptured his flesh is just still walking there's going to be a time yes a pacific time that I'll get a different body change but you know what our Prophet said even that I already have because he said it's hovering by you he said it's hovering by you oh my but you know before you can actually take this body change your body has to change amen let me say that again before you can actually take your Celestial your glorified bodies your body that's the change the nature the Nature has to change it'll still be your body but your glorified body will never come in and pick this body up unless your nature is subceptive to it now whatever that word is like the dove you know what the prophet said when you came up and the wrong spirit that Dove just went uh-huh because it could only eat fresh kill they never picked in the barnyard John 14 16 and I pray the father that he'll send you another comforter that he may abide with you forever and even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot cannot it cannot even if it wants to receive because it don't see him let me tell you something this morning to see him is not just written word I actually might not be no written word at all you know when all the other churches in town they're probably reading something very similar to this and they're looking and they don't see neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwell in this is I don't know if you pulled this up this is John 14 16-18 but ye know him for he dwelleth inside of you in you and he shall be he shall be with you and be in you and in that day in what day in the day that he came down ye shall know that I am in the father he came down was it two different people three different by cars it wasn't I am in the father and you are in me and I am in you so when he came down in the cloud and the Holy Spirit told us the prophet to turn it to the right brother Dale brother Matt brother Bernard sister Patty and all the rest of you I was in that picture if you look really really really close wow you will recognize the family resemblance oh boys thank you Lord oh Matthew 13 10-11 to you he has given to know and you're able to sit in your seat and you got to pull this up Amy I don't think they believe me Matthew 13 10 and 11 to you to who to the little tiny flock the little tiny fear not little flock for it's the father's good pleasure to give you the whole Kingdom you thought it was just salvation to you it is given to know but to them it's not given Jesus answering them he says it's given to you to know the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven that's the unwritten word but to them it's not given I'll tell you what it's going to protect your soul this is a razor edge and I tell you what brother Matt and every one of you brother sisters in here if you go to some places and the preacher's talking about the unwritten word you might want to get nervous and you'd have brother Dale be nervous right beside you because brother Matt it's just a razor it's a it's it's thinner than a hair and if you see your pastor just wobble one way or the other I even I will fall off that's why in our Prophet God bless you because Fred that's why in our day in our day in this in this morning I see it every week I see it every week you have people that are by the letter worshiping the same truth that we see and they're doing it to the prophet and we're doing it to the revelation of the spirit do you notice I could show you literally probably 25 Bible scriptures where it talks about it has nothing to do it has everything to do with but it has nothing to do with the person in the body but it has everything to do it's not about brother Dale this morning it's not about the fivefold ministry although God chose them for the perfecting of the Saints see what I'm trying to show you is when Daniel is seeing the vision this is Bible I'm backing this up when Daniel seen the vision and there was a rock cut out of the mountain whose hands did he see was in the hands of the pastor was it the hands of the five Florida mantras it wasn't the Pat in the hands of the the best evangelists in town it wasn't an evangelist of somebody that walked with the prophet still preaching it wasn't the Evangelist somebody's got the biggest church in the world it was Without Hats see those that worship Christ our Prophet said that Jesus was the body and Christ was the anointed the Bible says those that worship Him must worship Him and spare him and address spirit and truth yes Jesus Christ was Jehovah God perfectly Tabernacle didn't Flash amen and when he was done with that flesh it's laid somewhere and he's sitting in the throne on heaven hallelujah it's beautiful it's beautiful you know I'm gonna move on to a different part of Daniel here let's pull up Daniel 1 8 17 and 20. I'm going to touch on something this morning that's going to and then we're gonna move on and I want to if I get there I'm gonna show you a bunch of more examples in the Bible of the unwritten word and just oh it's just really really beautiful to me for sure to you amen Daniel 1 8 Amy when she's pulling that up I want to show you something here uh and me and Luanne were out driving and we've seen something wrote on a sign I took a picture of it you know God can speak through anything you know God's everywhere and I changed it a few words amen but I want to show you something and I'm going to prove it by the Bible in Daniel here where we read this scripture but your life reveals what you really believe not what you say your life reveals what you really believe and not what you say and that goes for preachers too amen amen that goes for every single human being here is an example and it's just beautiful you know let me read the scripture and then I'll carry on on this thought we we need to be we're we're at the end of the closing the prophet said after the seals that it was set up to going home it was the end it was all over there was nothing for the Gentile bride after the revealing of the seals amen if anything at all was just to ripen to become more like him just to Bow your head let the sun bake out all the Dale and so the real genuine was pure amen but Daniel purposed now compared Daniel to the bride of Christ and this is serious stuff because you know Satan knows that his time has showered he knows that it's probably going to be really soon and so uh he's like a raccoon when you're Corner in a corner when he knows his time's running out you want to make sure you got good shoes on because he's going to bite your toes amen and Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat now just put that in today can I can I read that same verse again brother Dale Style and the Bride of Christ's purpose in their heart that they would not defile herself with the portion of the world to me nor nothing wrong with meat here now remember I'll jump ahead remember when the Three Angels Came to Abraham amen and maybe they mentioned this last week when the Three Angels Came to Abraham and Abraham said my Lord one was Jehovah God and our Prophet said that God wanted to go down himself to make a covenant with Abraham and Sarah and he just pot a body and just jumped in it and he walked down there amen and here here this is what people don't see this morning amen sister Luanne heard this when I was studying and and she was laughing out loud but here's Jehovah God is that true brother Matt Abraham said it was my Lord here's Jehovah God in a body light never recognizing he called them Lords and Abraham said Sarah quick get the microwave and the servants wouldn't kill the calf and they had to cook it in the microwave because it had to cook fast I'm kidding and here's my Lord eating a piece of soft baby calf and the Flies are landed on it and he's shoeing the Flies the very God that created the Flies and created the calf and created the meat and created the microwave and he's chewing the Flies off them said I don't see them I don't recognize God in that picture he should like God he wouldn't have flies and he's shooting oh my God and people are looking right on them they're looking right out and said this person's shooting the Flies Opera there's no way that's there's no that's not my Lord there's that's not my Lord brother he's he he and he's eating me oh my goodness and Jesus said I thank you Father that you hid it from the wise and the prudent and I could go down Tabernacle in the flesh and I could chew the Flies off meat and I'm sure it was pink because it cooked it fast Vicki and it probably was just really the soft pink you know and just like that he was gone but before he was gone he could reveal their own written word When Sarah's your thoughts are louder in heaven than your voices here oh my why did Sarah lie don't laugh at God's word this morning amen Hallelujah and Daniel purpose in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of me nor with the wine with switchy drink therefore he requested the prince eunuchs that he might not defile himself I want to make a a proclamation here God will protect his bride while you're here on Earth and no matter what comes down the channel you will not have to defile your body here to serve God that's amen because God can change the heart of a king and even a eunuch in this case because the Bible says that died and you'll found favor he found favor with the man that said if the king finds out he will lob my head off that's pretty strong favor oh my thank you Lord 17. now just you can read this it's powerfully good verse 17 the key and as for those four children God gave them knowledge now watch before Daniel said in his heart the bride of Christ said in their heart I won't worship or defile my body now just think of that in worshiping in the Trinity and and Doctrine and Creeds and man's ideas and that all these things I won't do it and because of that and as for these four children God gave them knowledge and skill and skill and who God gave and because of that God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and all wisdom and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams you could take these two verses and say if you're looking for something that you're not seeing you've defiled yourself see if you're not defiled and you're in Christ you're the same as Christ you say oh brother Dale you're making me a God the prophet said that the word is in the bride and the bride has has thus saith the Lord wow defile yourself uh sorry but 20. see how God blessed them super Supernatural lessons uh and this scripture is going to tell you and it was so powerful that the world the world for the man recognized and in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king I got their attention that the king inquired of Daniel no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no that's not what it says brother down see one man worshiper one man prophet one man big evangelists he inquired of the big evangelists that had a knockout Ministry the king inquired of them the bride of Christ call and he found them the bride ten times and you thought you wanted that cheesy Hollywood garbage be careful brother God help us see Satan has come up with garbage of of knowledge and entertainment and when I'm studying I like the knowledge because I have the internet and I can go on the message Hub and I can search what the prophet said about every single verse in the Bible and how many times in all this and I can search the message because of the internet and so okay I could get rid of the internet but there's other garbage garbage see Daniel in his heart not to defy himself with the with the world's meat uh-huh that came to me but there's the King of Kings me on the same channel unbelievable your desires and your life will prove Who You Are if you have an appetite for the world's meat you don't have to have me tell you who you are but if you have an appetite for the king of kings of me whoa what did Satan tell Christ told God go on a boat like a roaring lion to and throw through Wyoming seeking whom he may give the king's meat to oh my goodness and the King found them the bride of Christ 10 times better of an employee 10 times better of a trustworthy anything 10 times then all the other servants of the devil magicians and astrologers that were all in awe of his route ten times smarter than the people that went to cemetery and Seminary and came from Creeds and deeds and dogmas ten times ten times God could it's unbelievable God is unbelievable but he's true God could take a prophet that never had what do you have no education couldn't even talk right you know I I don't I'm just saying you know I'm just saying if we believe he's the same God and I'm not downplaying brother Brown I failed grade one and went to speech therapy in grade two and great between kindergarten and grade four I was the joke on the school bus like my nickname was mikao because I couldn't speak right but the king of kings said you'll go to through the prophet Every Nation and you'll have three of Kings listen to you because they'll recognize that your body is not defiled with the world's meat not defiled but it's on the same web be careful being very very tackle your life and your appetite tell Who You Are if you can only watch movies on the web and you can't never watch anointed word of God or study the word of God or Search the word of God you better take that web smash it with a hammer and throw it out the door because it'll eat your soil batter to arrive in heaven with less Revelation on the word of God than have arrived in heaven to go to hell you say oh bless God I got the website so I can study the message yeah but if you're watching the devil you're going to have fellowship with them in Everlasting Darkness I want to show you something and I'm not preaching on Holiness here but the Daniel marked in his heart that he would not defile himself and God blessed him with things now God knows everything amen and just in my life just wherever I went this week and yesterday do you know just randomly last night late I studied all day last night I pulled up a it was late I believe it was it might even met this morning I pulled up do you know that you couldn't intend you could not attend a Tupperware party a Tupperware party everybody hear me you couldn't attend a Tupperware party in the 50s without a skirt on they wouldn't have the party Tupperware and Satan has robbed people with perversion to to garbage and they've defiled themselves with the king's meat do you know this very morning the lady that sister Luanne watches they asked her to work next Sunday and Lil Wayne said well I'm going there today so I don't want to work in the way I said well I guess I can and she said oh it's all right I'm sending my niece there and Luanne proceeds to tell me that this lady raised the niece because of perversion of her mom and dad but she's a niece they only know what that means she's a gyro and now she comes to sit next Sunday with the very mother on Earth that raised her that's 93 years old and she's dressed and beliefs she's amen because she took some man's meat and cut some things off her body and took some other things and sewed some things on and the man said when I go there Monday my little girl will be all messed up in her head because this is a little girl that she raised from birth pervers said that's hell and it started with women wearing pants and men getting rid of their backbone wearing a dress that's thus say it the word of God and brother Dale I can prove that upside down I also said it's still on my phone they give a picture of somebody you know there's you know everything's everywhere you know you can just turn your iPad on it there was a picture in the 1930s so this is farther back walking in the some I I actually thought it was somewhere popular but it makes no difference and you would have thought every single woman on that curb I just walked out of a wedding because their skirt was as long as my pants are right now brother Mike can you see that and they probably were just walking out of like California Hollywood don't kid yourself Satan knows exactly what he's doing he just comes really slow now he knows brother Dale won't compromise too much so I'll just bring him a little bit yeah and then oh he didn't mind the taste of that right Kings me he didn't mind to take that I'll just put a little bit more seasoning on that and pretty soon you'll be like the people that God swallowed up when they left Egypt and they said they went to Moses God's servant and said we would go back to the leeks and garlics God have mercy on the bride of Christ stay away from that garbage this is pure and holy and it ain't a man's teaching I can't help myself and if you I don't mean to offend you but we're going up to the Amish Country this week and we're going to Elmira to a nice restaurant I like and the atmosphere is unbelievable I can tell because water and oil don't mix every single woman in there will be wearing small flowers on a full gown dress like a like a bibs not a skirt in the top the full ground dress way down to the bottom of that and they're bringing me my bowl of soup like this I'll tell you what if I didn't already have the queen of Glory and I was 16 again I know which one I'd be looking at it wouldn't be some old hard bored stiff Butch tough hair prostitute cheat garbage that you could find everywhere else uh-huh and that's exactly how God feels also do you think he's going to marry something that's just indulging in the king's meat you are deceived you are deceived and you can also take this another step farther that not every single thing of Allah that though man made kingdoms on this Earth pass does the bride of Christ have to indulge in thus saith brother Dale and God like the vaccination now if you do it's fine I'm just saying let me ask you this if Daniel watches Daniel was a slave let me repeat that Daniel was a captured slave hello hello and he chose to go against a foreign government law now put that in your cup and drink it and God said whoa thank you Lord that's good food anyway oh wow so we know that the church ages are over oh no not exactly they're not over for the people that are in them the church ages are not over for the first virgins for the night they're not over but for the bride of Christ that's already been glorified and already sitting in Heavenly places even though I don't have my Throne yet and even though I don't have my Army yet and even though I don't have my dominion over the the kingdoms of the Earth I'm already there I'm already in the bright age I'm not affected or I'm not partaking let me say it that way of laodicea I have no taste for it I'm not loathing the leeks and garlics of laodicea all right our Prophet said it similar to that he said the bride is in the bride age even though the church ages are for the ones that aren't called amen Hallelujah but Jesus you know I know you're having trouble seeing it you just need to take about 12 hours and just spend in Daniel you'll come a lot clearer to you if you do some praying before Jesus is just as much here right now this morning as he be comes in an actual Corporal body to have us glorify you know the anointing will be no stronger and you say how can you say because he said in his word in the end of his word in Revelation in the book that tells what's going to happen to Satan I'm already I'm already here watch how the cloud came down in our day when they come down there and science photographed it it was right before to see us God himself came told the prophet what the Mysteries were what the unwritten word was and he didn't trust nobody to do that amen there ain't nothing watch this there ain't nothing that can stand in front of you everything if you're a part of the bride of Christ and got the baptism Holy Ghost everything will bow you know Hallelujah a thousand will fall at your side and ten thousand on the other hand but not once back amen Hallelujah thank you Lord you know I showed you that example of Jehovah eating meat with Abraham that's exactly what the bride is doing this morning where the Eagles are gathered where the fresh kills they're meat eaters they don't just drink grapes and fruit they indulge in the rescue and this day Satan our Prophet said this and this day Satan knows your address brother Matt brother Tim brother Bernard and Fred and all of us he knows your address Felix he knows your address brother really he knows exactly your address Satan does so sometimes he'll put stuff in the mail and my wife calls it garbage man it don't make it very far in our house it just gets fired down the basement stairs and through in the furnace but sometimes he'll send you stuff and you think oh there's my name found the right house but I don't recognize the other name on here it's got my name see you know when you get a letter it's in the front big and center it's in the middle of the doohickey you know brother Dale 2104. but sometimes the other person that's coming from things you know you don't have to accept stuff that ain't for you if somebody sends you rattlesnakes now if you like snakes you can eat them I suppose I don't want to be the one to kill them thank you very much uh I would probably eat them if they were cooked real nice but you can just put it right back in your mailbox that garbage mail you don't even have to put it in the furnace you don't even have to carry it in your house because it's under the token that would be really scary you just put it back in the mailbox and the mail lady will come the next day and she'll say oh you didn't clean out your mailbox because that's got your name on it and you can just put a little sticky note on it before the foundation of the earth called return to send her no such number Return to Sender no appetite for what you said to me huh I look no no taste pornography no taste you know garbage doing the perfect sacrifice come down it didn't cover it up it didn't do like when I was a kid you know when company came brother matters somebody's coming I just went true and pulled the mat down but no and this day he just sucked her all the way man Hallelujah thank you Lord amen Satan knows what he's doing and he's trying to get you to eat the king's meat don't come off the word of God amen even when you receive watches the prophet said this when you receive the unwritten word make sure it lines up with the written make sure it's of The Same Spirit as the written word make sure it's of the same taste as a written word the same texture as the written word amen oh yeah we believe in written word I shared one with you last week amen and and uh and we're gonna maybe if we get to that ear see we need to have the wisdom of Solomon and it's in the bride that when a minister comes and he starts talking about the unwritten word and that throws out on you and it don't taste right it's not right brother not amen if it don't taste unless you're part of the people that live in the leeks and garlics hey hey hey hey hey they were eating Heavenly Mana I'm telling you what that's a pretty cool cook uh-huh that that kitchen in that restaurant wasn't just approved by the government of Canada that was approved by the Jehovah Jireh the King of Kings just you know this is free and this I'm not supposed to as we come down to the end things are getting crazy you know ministers we're talking about climate change and the Bible says in Romans that there will be things happen on the Earth but they have it all wrong everyone or not mostly you know climate change happened brother Matt you want to know when climate change happened I'll tell you when climate change happened was the one where William Phillips was born was when brother Bernard was born or Fred he's a lot older than all of them I mean sorry for well or maybe well maybe you know when climate change started thank you as soon as Sin hit the earth in the garden climate change happened yummy tell you what climate change ain't no worse today than it was one second after the fall in the garden now one second not one second I I answered some of those ministers with no response because I have no filter amen I said climate change has been here forever something well something like that I said when you give the politicians all of your money the government sorry I said when you give the government all of your money they'll stop preaching climate change you just brother Matt I'll just take it off and the preaching will be over there you I just met as soon as the government gets all of your money there'll be no more sermons on climate change you know and there was one Minister that had a backbone uh there and he put a thing up he said you know like in the 30s they said we were going to die from the Ice Age in 10 years and in the 40s they said we were going to die from the Sun age because the ozone was gone in 10 years and the in the 80s I remember this when I was in high school in the 80s and I married my beautiful girl we weren't going to be able to drive cars because the oil was all going to be gone there would be no more oil and you know huh you got Unwritten Revelation brother Matt climate change happened in the fall and climate change ain't one's back different today than it was in the fall and you say well brother Dale what about all the cars driving around I'm sure glad you asked praise God I have an answer for that dude you're telling me that a Jehovah god with eternal ultimate wisdom created the gum beds in Oil Springs Royal Springs in Oil City and all that the gum beds that the oil bubbled right out of the ground from the creation from the creation and that was going to destroy the Earth or a cow when it Toots and the stuff that smells really strong was going to kill the earth when they were killing cows when Abraham and Jehovah went down and ate the cow those people are nuts insane sorry man they're deceived I'm sorry for being so honest amen do you know Jesus on the on the beach and this is free so there might be fourth message do you know Jesus on the beach cooked fish for the disciples when he was calling them but now if you burn wood it's killing the old Zone later now if you need if you believe this stuff you are you know what some ministers reply to some of our stuff on the thing they talked within themselves and they said well some of these pastors don't believe in climate change bless God we're so right it's a good thing you pray for me and you know what you go to Camp mini or travel you're going to visit those people you're going to hear them preach and it'll be okay because God before the foundation of the world created a five-fold Ministry was for the perfecting of the Saints and no not all the fivefold gifts and colonies are without repentance so no not probably most of them aren't holy but in the unwritten word by the taste of the Holy Spirit God could decipher a group of people that never loathe the leaks and Gardens and you could just tell when you're laying it out there oh this don't tastes right there's old days right and you're just kind of like I don't want to offend anybody but I think I'll stick to my wife's cooking Jehovah gods oh man amen amen so just for the record in case anybody's watching our thing brother Dale believes in climate change praise God but it started in the Garden of Eden thank you very much ain't God good I can't I told I can't you know you know I was showering this morning you know I said I can't make this stuff up brother Matt I don't even look for it do you know the Bible says brother Matt now when you pray to go into your closet and pour out your heart to God in prayer this application and what you do in secret God will reward you openly and it says do not be like the religious people in the message Sadducees and Pharisees that go to the front corner so ah bless God 45 minutes later oh the power of oh and about being sacrilegious I'm teaching the truth our Prophet your Prophet brother married your prophet said a church order and doctored not to do that he said you don't pray in the service for the governor and your sick aunt and your Uncle Harry and Papa Louie and the Bible says don't be like the religious Pharisees and Sadducees who go to the street corner and want their prayers heard by their fancy words of what nobody interprets like the words of the message like May the pot don't kid yourself most people that pray with the message terminology that we understand nobody in the world would understand that don't make it wrong but the Bible says not to do it to do it in secret because they have the reward they were only praying and ministers in this message almost every other month hire baked name people I've never been asked yet to pray praise God I haven't start World War 4. to pray on the internet in front of the whole world when my Bible says Pharisees and Sadducees they have their reward now am I now I ask you is that am I right brother am I preaching the truth you decide there's one reason they're doing that for one reason popularity they had their reward oh bless God I hope you have a good prayer in front of a TV to the whole world you know we share our video on the internet and the number one reason is because brother Jim what's this Patricia aren't here this morning amen and almost every week I'm checked in my spirit for you yeah almost every week popularity money and women and the Bible says don't do it you want to pray it don't even say in the Bible to go to pray me now David said you know I'd love to but it says go in the closet I believe if you did come to prayer meeting you can have your own closet in your pew and I'll have my closet wherever it is and we could still huh and you're going to see this in the message until we go home because our Prophet said that it will go into complete Insanity complete Insanity and the Bible says it will be so close that it would deceive the message believer if he wasn't all Israel is unusual brother Dale ain't taking nobody out of the Kingdom but I ask you is that Bible did I just say is it message Bible and message that same Prophet that we believe you know a lot of people they need to either study or pray or get relevant same Prophet said that God will never use a mechanical device to spread his word uh-huh hey [Music] let's see if huh now you see wisdom like Solomon see you know the story for the boys the boys need to hear this story you know Solomon was the wisest person on Earth did you know that he wisest person on Earth you know why he's the wisest person because he pleased God and God said I'll give you I'll give you money that'd be pretty cool or I'll give you this Kingdom or I'll give you this and Solomon recognized the awesome responsibility of being in charge of God's anointed Kingdom Israel that's kind of like me sometimes as a pastor might come here and pray and I mention every single one of you by name and Solomon said God I can't lead your people without you doing it in wisdom until this day in the history books Solomon is reported as the wisest man to ever be born Google I'll tell you that am I and so they brought two mothers and they had little Curtis two mothers looked exactly like Julie and they were both claiming Curtis but they both couldn't have curse how did you know Solomon chose all over Felix knows Solomon said that's no problem he just said over to one of his soldiers he said give me a sword it was like the Bible two edit swords and he went and he was going to cut Curtis right in half he said now this will please both of you because I won't offend neither one of you and you can both take them home with you let me tell you something this morning Brad not all the bride is taking Christ home with them not just today but in the rapture they're not all taking them home two will be in the back one will be taken and the other one will be locked she'll be in the field and one will be taken on the other way we'll still be in the field and there's where the wisdom kicked in you know how that went near you the real mother realizing that the baby would be dead that's like the word of God it's Solomon said you're the mother that that's Supernatural but that's what the bride has and needs today wisdom and revelation that the spirit that comes over you because it's not a one-man Ministry the spirit that comes over you from anybody that comes and ministers or anything in your travel or even when you're at work brother matter Jared or Tim anybody my brother anybody just about the spirit that they throw it over you oh oh oh this ain't right this ain't right amen hey man let me let me uh wow wow wow I'm on page seven of eleventh man let me read a quote brother Brown said the Gentile dispensation paragraph 81 and I already said it I said it verbally but I want you to understand it and we preached on this and so I'm not dealing with this although there's there's the more I study it the more I see let me just throw this out there you know idol worship everything that God worked through the people afterwards worship the brass serpent Mo like you name it everybody did even John did Revelations fell down worship he said what'd the person say when John fell twice brother man a man greatest man ever born twice you know what it says in Revelations says I'm a big man I'm a prophet I'm one of the full ministry bless God I'm important no no he said I am your fellow brother servant brother worship brother how in the world twice the very servant breast servant that God raised up and the people could look at when they get bit by The Serpent and would live even our Prophet said when when Jonah was in the well looked at where he fought the servant the to live the very same godhead them tear it down and smash him man you know what it is our Prophet said that they don't recognize presence of Jehovah that was like that with Jesus that crucified Jesus why they didn't recognize the pro The Presence of Jehovah why did they Stone Stephen because they didn't recognize The Presence of Jehovah why why did they Stone all the prophets because they didn't recognize the anointing of Jehovah in the Tabernacle they didn't recognize the anointing it wasn't the Tabernacle it wasn't the brass servant it was the Jehovah that was despairing it was that I can't like it was it was the god oh man so he starts out I mean he's just starting out talking about that it starts out well I'll read the first paragraph and you'll notice a gentile age started out in idle worship you already know what that is it was the worship of Daniel but let me just drop down in paragraph 83 uh 82. and that's the way it was ushered in was prophet worship and it was condemned the the head of gold was the image to worship to worship everything was worship and it was it forced to do it the three Hebrew children were forced to worship the image of Daniel and it ended up in Supernatural handwriting God took the Kingdom from the King amen so at the same time Idol worship's going on God's pouring out Revelation that's Supernatural same time amen 83. now my words and the and as a gentile age commands so will go out worship of a holy man but watch this and I got this screaming in capital letters but also on the other side Supernatural understand Supernatural revelation at the exact same time those people are falling down and worshiping an idol and God's showing you the real Supernatural on written spoken word oh for interpretation or revelation for your life it's unbelief it's it's just amazing amen we are no way shape or formed worshiping a dad we are no way shape or form worshiping any bad we are worshiping the god that they pointed to every one of them worship them even when our Prophet was here he said when people started doing stuff like that in his life he said if and he come off the field for a period of time he said if you do that you make me an antichrist you make me the devil unbelievable Hallelujah amen you know we talked about Unwritten words here and I'm gonna I'm gonna wind it down here I just wanted to I wanted to get to something if I um let me close with this I'll close with this you know when I talk about Unwritten word amen I believe that you could take everything back to the Bible brother Branham believed you could take everything back to the Bible but there is an Unwritten word amen it's called Revelations let me let me I I just I'm going to give this to you let me I give you an example of Eliezer and Rebecca for the unwritten word for Rebecca when she did the unwritten word but there's two more examples you know another example was when Jesus asked the disciples who do men say that I am why was Jesus answering asking because it wasn't written amen it wasn't written or the people didn't understand and you know they said oh you know they all these other things and then Peter said Thou Art the son of God you know and what did Jesus say to him he said oh you did really good reading that in the Bible Peter that was under Luke 13 5. thank you brother he said blessed are you Simon by Jonah for flesh and blood and the written word never revealed that to you see it was the taste spiritually said Flesh and Blood never revealed that unto you what was the other one here amen amen the other one was the three Hebrew children the unwritten word you know when they did the three Hebrew children they wouldn't fall down worship the idol remember we just read the quote at the exact same time that message Believers will worship an idol worship a big something at the exact same time God will be taking the true message believer and give them Untold Revelation discernment visions and dreams okay John written word okay exact same time that was happening when the King Nebuchadnezzar made the decree for everybody worshiped the image and the three prohibits from them never come down he brought him up and he said okay now we're going to make the sound again loud and you'll fall down don't don't bother yourself with that fancy worldly music because I don't have a taste for that world of music I just have a taste for the you know you know once in a while almost every single night we listen to brother Brown when we go to sleep that's a really good practice you could never go wrong with that man I you can afford an iPad and if you can't afford it the church no I won't even take it over the office the church will give you the ties to actually get an iPad you can put it right by your nightstand and you know lots of times we'll go to bed and we'll do whatever once in a while we're there I want to say I can't go to sleep are you going to put brother Brown I'm trying to go well aren't you going to turn the profit on but once in a while once in a while we'll turn on some music and unless it's a CD if you happen to turn on Christian radio it'll be somewhere between rock and roll and Brew glass it was only okay around Christmas you can't even tell the difference and he's here here and here that he portrayed Daniel 3 23 and here at Daniel he said the three Hebrew children they threw the three Hebrew children into the fiery furnace now yo yet I got a question for you how many people did they throw in the furnace three how many people wrote down to be thrown in the furnace great thank you in verse 24 King Nebuchadnezzar became astonished why did he become astonished because of the unwritten word yeah the written word was we're putting three in the furnace yep they wrote a degree you know all that fancy stuff but when God came on the scene they didn't need that [Music] Jesus I and the Fourth Man like every time it was Unwritten word didn't just look like the son of God but he actually was the son of God the king said hey hey didn't we write down that we put just three men in the furnace they said yep king that's all that's in the records it's three men and he said but I see four and I recognize my brother Matt I get a question he was pagan heathen he wasn't God's chosen like Nation before the Holy Ghost came before Jesus came true sacrifice he never went to Bible School they never had prayer in the school not even the Lord's Prayer and you're having trouble recognizing Jesus hello and he said I see four and I ain't never seen them before I never read the Bible and I never went to cemetery and I definitely ain't in the predestination plan of God but I'm pretty sure Revelation even comes to an unbelievers it did do them no good didn't do them don't yet I said I'm sure that's the son of man it's up to God oh oh my goodness I gotta shut her down I close with this we could stand you know when you talk about this Unwritten word our Prophet said I I was I was I was toying with that when I was studying I said you know I know you got to be careful when you start going in untreated Waters and I know what God was giving me but I was wanting I was wanting some flesh on it you know Sister Patty I'm like Unwritten word you got to kind of be careful with that kind of stuff because I always preach that if you couldn't find it here brother Matt huh I looked in the message the prophet said 64 times he said a lot more than that if you just change one word but he said 64 times to read between the lines he actually said I could tell you just by paraphrasing an upper I just I'm trying to stop he said you can't even read your Bible properly and it came on a rare thing that the king required he said you can't even read your our Prophet said president he said you can't even read your Bible properly unless you read between the lines and I just in the kitchen I just had one of those runarounds the Wind wasn't there and I looked like I was just like losing my mind and actually when I started to dig that up I searched it and I had just you know how when you start punching in he's like read between I think read between he said like 70 sometimes but I wanted to get read between the lines and he said that's 64. so I'm punching it in my iPad and my computer and I was like read and every word it's like like read it was like 10 million and then it was between and it was like 70 some and then between the lines it dropped to 64. and I just went could really preach tomorrow no because I have God's prophet and his word which is just amazing and the word of God is my backup amen wow God bless you here they're real easy to preach to amen amen this this is the saying about Harvest Time bright Tabernacle right it's it's this is just amen I want to leave you with this just remember this please remember this don't defile yourself but it's a king's meat and how you live is what you believe I see you doing so I see you smoking I know you think that's okay I see you wearing pants you think that's okay I see you cut your hair you that's your testimony amen if I see you partaking in movies that have The Taste of and that's all you've used the internet for that's how you live your life it reveals Who You Are amen it certainly ain't the chosen unless it was for collectify amen but I want you to leave you with this so it starts to try to say as we come down it's going to be a great separation because the difference between idol worship and Revelation is going to be unbelievable it's going to be unbelievable it will be as far as the East is from the west and farther than that it'll be farther than that and that's why if you're sitting in out if you're let me rephrase that that was self-serving if you're in fellowship with Jehovah you will be as far as the East is from Sister Patty when you go to work you must look when I go to the rest you know me somebody see like and let me back that up Sister Patty or myself you know what it ain't just about your luck it's what your cat it's it it's the atmosphere it's the stuff you can't see see I got a tie on this morning but I wouldn't look no different if I didn't if I had my blue jeans on because it's this stuff that you're a Creator and you so you just carry yourself like okay I'm closing like the slave let his dad back home was a king he was still a Slave I said I'll buy him because when you just go you're you're you're just you just I'll take them that's who I want right there how'd they recognize it the same way King Nebuchadnezzar recognize somebody like oh my wow I'm trying to it's just see how easy you know the prophet said he said I could preach forever and it would take near as much out of me to see in One Vision I never seen a vision but I can see what he's saying about preaching forever because it's just it's not the person if you ever realize it has nothing if it's of God it's not the person I couldn't he loves you unbelievable Hallelujah thank you Lord amen for he is low he's my Lord and he has risen from the dead oh God you're the rose of shares Lily of the beautiful Valley you hear my bright and you're my morning star holidays Jehovah Jireh everything in a package of you're my Lord Blessed Be Your Name Blessed Be Your Name Jesus Christ Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus for this beautiful time in your word and thank you for your anointing Lord Jesus thank you for your presence it's just so real you could cut it with a knife Blessed Be Your Name Blessed Be Your Name God help us never to defy ourself Lord Jesus from this beautiful savior that you are and help us to recognize as the end comes that idol worship and revelation will be a million miles apart a million miles apart Blessed Be Your Name bless Lord Jesus bless your bride here may you heal their bodies Jesus fix their bank accounts put rubber on their tires so their shoes don't wear out Hallelujah put hair on their head Lord Jesus bless them in a supernatural way as they feed on your word Lord Jesus we give you the glory and honor for it in your name we pray amen for he's my love he is my love and he has risen from the dead and he's my Lord every name [Music] [Laughter]
