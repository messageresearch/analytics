[19:42] [Music]
[19:50] Hallelujah. Lord Jesus,
[19:53] we know the words of these songs are
[19:55] true because your Bible says they are
[19:58] says that where we would gather for the
[20:01] purpose of worshiping you and serving
[20:04] you, Lord God, and hearing from you,
[20:07] that you would be here in our midst,
[20:09] Lord God. And Lord, we love and adore
[20:12] you, Lord God. I pray Lord God a special
[20:15] blessing on

[20:24] reasons Lord God bless them bless them
[20:27] in a special way Lord God many different
[20:30] cases Lord God maybe some will be watch
[20:34] online Lord God may your Holy Spirit go
[20:38] in a supernatural way and feed that soul
[20:41] Lord God today And Lord, as we look into
[20:44] your
[20:45] word, you're so beautiful, Lord God. And
[20:48] I pray you'll you'll change me, Lord
[20:52] God. Change us to what we're supposed to
[20:56] be, Lord God. We pray. Be with the
[20:59] speaker, Lord God, and move them
[21:00] completely out of the way. Help us to
[21:03] see
[21:04] Jesus
[21:06] only. and be with the hearer, Lord God,
[21:09] and anoint their hearts that they could
[21:11] hear from you, Lord God. In your name we
[21:15] pray.
[21:17] Amen. Hallelujah.
[21:20] Amen. God bless you this morning. It's
[21:23] good to be here and thank you musicians
[21:26] and Jared and Amen. just a great
[21:29] privilege
[21:31] to we love and appreciate each one of
[21:34] you and we know different ones are out
[21:36] for different reasons and and that's all
[21:39] right. We have to uh do what's
[21:42] necessary.
[21:43] Amen. Amen. Let's just turn to Ephesians
[21:46] uh 4 1-2 and we're going to carry on the
[21:50] same same topic. This is going to be
[21:52] part three and it'll just be part until
[21:55] God changes our parts. But uh following
[21:59] in the feminine
[22:01] spirit. Amen. Just want to look at a
[22:04] different part of the scriptures here.
[22:07] Ephesians
[22:08] 4 one and
[22:10] two. Sorry
[22:14] Vicki. I therefore a prisoner of the
[22:19] Lord. Here's Paul talking.
[22:22] beseech you that you walk
[22:28] worthily of the
[22:31] vocation wherein ye were called.
[22:36] Paul's concerned that we would be worthy
[22:38] of our
[22:41] vocation with
[22:43] all loneliness,
[22:50] meekness,
[22:55] with longsuffering
[23:02] forbearing one
[23:05] another in love.
[23:09] Help me Jesus.
[23:13] Help us Lord
[23:15] today. We love you and we bless your
[23:18] name. Amen.
[23:21] God bless you. You may have your
[23:28] seats. You
[23:31] know, when God laid this continue this
[23:34] thought this week and I had some of this
[23:37] and I just when something comes to me, I
[23:40] just start putting things down and I add
[23:42] and subtract. Sometimes I take things
[23:44] away.
[23:47] And if we lived this, if I lived this,
[23:52] let's make it personal. If Brother Dale
[23:55] lived
[23:59] this, it'd be a different environment
[24:01] that I lived in.
[24:06] Everything in this
[24:09] scripture is talking about the
[24:13] examples of the feminine spirit. Amen.
[24:18] The feminine spirit is with loneliness,
[24:24] with
[24:26] meekness, with
[24:32] longsuffering, forbearing one another
[24:35] and love. I
[24:37] wonder as Paul was
[24:40] concerned, Paul was under the anointing
[24:42] of
[24:44] God to say, I wonder if we're
[24:47] worthy. I wonder if I'm worthy of the
[24:55] vocation that God placed in us.
[25:00] I mean I believe that God can help us
[25:04] and understand you know we would
[25:07] have you know we came from God and so we
[25:10] have to have the same characteristics of
[25:12] God but we have to have the feminine
[25:14] spirit of
[25:15] God and you know we're going to get into
[25:18] many things you know brother Brandham
[25:20] said God could forgive your enemy but
[25:23] you can't. God could love your enemy but
[25:26] I struggle with it. God could put up
[25:29] with people's
[25:31] shortcomings, but we judge
[25:38] them here in a message, humble yourself,
[25:41] in 63, almost the end of 63, he said,
[25:45] now if we looked at our
[25:48] wristwatch and he said, there's many
[25:50] instruments in there that are
[25:53] consolidating the whole
[25:55] watch to keep the correct
[25:59] time and it takes all of us
[26:03] together. I know this is like probably
[26:08] the most powerful statement I've heard
[26:09] the prophet say. If we want to see the
[26:13] third
[26:16] pull and really do something for
[26:24] God, it's to work in correlation with
[26:28] everyone of
[26:30] us
[26:32] together to humble yourself before
[26:36] God and confess your wrongs.
[26:42] and pray in God. Pray believing that God
[26:46] for these things if we want to see the
[26:49] third pull.
[26:51] Wow. Thank you, Vicki. In verse in
[26:54] paragraph 76, and you know, people want
[26:58] the
[27:00] power. I want the power of God.
[27:05] If you're a believer this morning, you
[27:06] should want the power of God.
[27:08] Yeah, that's right. How could you be a
[27:11] believer and not want what God is?
[27:14] If you want the power of
[27:16] God and really they don't know what
[27:21] power is. See, they don't really know
[27:25] what goes with it. The way
[27:28] up is down. That's right. Always. And if
[27:33] you want power, see how
[27:36] humble you can get. Just get out of the
[27:40] way from all your worldly thinking and
[27:43] humble yourself before God. I took some
[27:46] of this out between the next spirit.
[27:48] That's the real power. Let's go to verse
[27:50] 77. Paragraph 77. And you show me a
[27:55] church that's really
[27:59] humble, not arrogant.
[28:02] a church that's just
[28:06] sweet, humble church. And I'll show you
[28:10] a church that has the favor and power of
[28:15] God in it. That's right. That's the
[28:18] thing it takes.
[28:20] Humility, humbling ourselves before
[28:24] God and letting
[28:27] God do his will.
[28:33] Wow. I thought it was correcting
[28:37] people. I thought it was judging. We
[28:42] I thought it was showing people the
[28:43] word. You
[28:45] know, we were at we were gone for this
[28:48] week and we had a wonderful week, but
[28:51] the climax was
[28:54] yesterday and we went to brother Samuel
[28:58] Johnson's
[28:59] memorial. And in some
[29:03] cases, I seen
[29:06] similarities to myself, but he was much
[29:09] more radical than I ever
[29:11] was. But they said he didn't understand
[29:14] the concept of it's not
[29:16] possible. He said he never ever got a
[29:19] memo that we can't do this or you can't
[29:22] do that. He never got that memo in
[29:25] life. And he did many things that were
[29:29] impossible because he never got the memo
[29:32] that you can't do
[29:34] that. And they were saying the literally
[29:37] dozens of visions that he seen that came
[29:41] to pass. dozens
[29:48] and very very humble
[29:50] meek started hundreds of
[29:54] churches and you know they said when he
[29:56] would go to other countries he didn't go
[29:58] like I
[29:59] went I've never went nowhere where
[30:02] somebody didn't know me or I knew them
[30:05] or didn't kind of invite me or you were
[30:08] connected to he went to places that he
[30:10] didn't know one single
[30:12] person. There was not one single church.
[30:15] He just flew in, went to complete
[30:17] strange place, went even to tribal
[30:19] Indians in
[30:21] Honduras. And he walked in the city,
[30:23] there wasn't one person that recognized
[30:24] his
[30:29] face. And normally when he left, there
[30:31] was a
[30:33] charge. Amen.
[30:36] But we can do many
[30:39] things with the feminine spirit of God.
[30:42] That's what God planned us to be. But
[30:45] because we get out of our place and we
[30:48] become a
[30:49] masculine, God just sits back and waits
[30:53] till we get it
[30:54] right. He's been waiting a long
[30:58] time. You know in Colossians 3:15 and
[31:02] 12, put on therefore as the elect of
[31:06] God, holy and beloved bowels of
[31:09] mercy and
[31:11] kindness, humb humbleness of mind,
[31:17] meekness and
[31:19] longsuffering.
[31:21] Well, they made a stupid decision. Does
[31:25] it
[31:26] matter? Not if you're long-suffering.
[31:30] Every person breathing has made stupid
[31:32] decisions.
[31:34] It doesn't matter.
[31:37] Forbearing one another. But I don't have
[31:39] nothing to do with it. Didn't hurt
[31:44] me.
[31:48] Oh, forgiving one another.
[31:53] If any man have a quarrel against any,
[31:56] even as Christ forgave you and you
[31:58] weren't worthy of it, even if you were
[32:00] born in a message church
[32:02] pew, so also do you. And above all these
[32:06] things, put on charity. It's the bonds
[32:08] of
[32:09] perfectness. Let the peace rule in your
[32:12] hearts to which also ye are called in
[32:15] one
[32:16] body. And be ye thankful.
[32:20] Do you know we can always change the
[32:25] trend in our family? You know, we can
[32:27] always change the curse in your it not I
[32:30] mean if there is one in your life it's a
[32:33] decision. First off you have to
[32:35] recognize I have a problem. And then ask
[32:38] God to help you. Amen. You know the
[32:41] Bible says things like this that no
[32:43] man can tame the tongue.
[32:47] No man. He said we can tame everything
[32:49] in the world. jet engines, everything.
[32:51] But we can't tame our tongue. But God
[32:53] can. But God can. There's a per there's
[32:56] a man there's a man that can turn on the
[32:58] light
[33:00] and he can calm your tongue.
[33:03] He can tame your
[33:05] tongue. In the marriage of the lamb, the
[33:08] Holy
[33:09] Ghost is
[33:11] meekness,
[33:12] joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness, and
[33:15] gentleness, patience, and faith. And
[33:18] that Holy Spirit
[33:20] bears, you're doing beautiful, Vicki.
[33:24] Thank you, Lee Jesus. And that Holy
[33:26] Spirit bears and the church of the
[33:29] living
[33:31] God
[33:34] sweetness,
[33:40] humbleness,
[33:43] humility, love one for another.
[33:46] You know, when we were at Samuel
[33:48] Johnson's thing, we met hundreds of
[33:50] people. But, you know, there's people
[33:52] living in the States because they
[33:53] couldn't they couldn't live in Ontario
[33:56] because there was too much
[34:02] fighting. My table was full of people
[34:04] that used to live in Ontario. They moved
[34:06] away because it was too evil.
[34:12] And I was born in Ontario. So,
[34:16] I had to be part of the
[34:19] problem. That's a solemning thought.
[34:24] You wouldn't move away because of bad
[34:26] politics. You wouldn't move away because
[34:28] of masculine spirit on message
[34:32] believers.
[34:46] Just a beautiful picture. Oh, we love
[34:48] it. Our God is willing. Look what if
[34:52] what if God wouldn't have been
[34:53] longsuffering to you? What if the fruit
[34:56] of the spirit of love, joy, and peace
[34:59] and
[35:00] longsuffering? That's the that's a part
[35:04] of
[35:04] God that's in
[35:07] you. and forbearing one another's
[35:09] burdens and forgiving one another as God
[35:12] for Christ's sake forgave you. The
[35:15] spirit of God is in you and it makes
[35:20] you that
[35:25] way. You can't change if
[35:28] somebody's serving God properly or to
[35:31] your accountability or properness and
[35:34] you judging them won't fix nothing. Are
[35:36] you condemning people that fall down?
[35:39] That won't fix nothing.
[35:43] And amen. You know, here in this next
[35:46] scripture, uh, how do I say that, honey?
[35:50] Micah, am
[35:52] I
[35:54] Micah, wherewith shall I come before God
[35:59] with my bowels full before the high God?
[36:02] Shall I come before him with my tithes
[36:06] and offerings, burning
[36:08] sacrifice? Should I come before him with
[36:10] the biggest calf of the year? That'd be
[36:13] a big price today. The kids swared
[36:15] calves
[36:17] yesterday. Will the Lord that we serve
[36:20] be pleased with the thousands of rams
[36:23] and all our money or rivers of oil?
[36:27] Shall I give my
[36:31] firstborn for my transgressions, the
[36:34] fruit of my body, and the sins of my
[36:38] soul. And he has showed the old man what
[36:41] is good. And what does God require of
[36:44] you? Is not your money. He could really
[36:48] care less about your biggest calf or
[36:50] your thousand lambs.
[36:54] But to do justly,
[36:58] and to love mercy
[37:02] and just walk really humble
[37:05] with God.
[37:08] Amen. Oh, be conscience. This is an
[37:12] influence. Oh, be
[37:14] conscience here. He's one thing to be
[37:19] conscious
[37:21] of is your
[37:23] littleness. If you want to get somewhere
[37:25] with God, make yourself
[37:29] really,
[37:31] really
[37:34] little. That's against
[37:36] every
[37:38] logical definition of the mind.
[37:43] I want to look at three examples in the
[37:45] Bible if we get to them all and and uh
[37:49] show you the difference between
[37:51] humble and a feminine spirit and a
[37:54] masculine
[37:56] one. Excuse
[37:58] me. We'll turn to Esther
[38:02] 5 and we're going to jump around here a
[38:05] little
[38:07] bit. Esther 5 1-4 and then 6-14.
[38:11] But are you following my Oh, beautiful.
[38:14] Thank you, Lord. That's God just answers
[38:18] prayer
[38:20] beautifully. It's been my desire since
[38:22] we ministered that you could see
[38:24] everything I have here. That's just
[38:27] Thank you,
[38:29] Vicki. I want to show you something that
[38:32] Esther had a feminine spirit. You know,
[38:35] if you go back farther than this
[38:37] example,
[38:41] sorry, you'll remember that when Esther
[38:44] was coming before the king that she
[38:46] never required nothing that the king
[38:48] didn't offer. She could have had
[38:52] everything, but whatever the king
[38:54] wanted. And the king knew what he
[38:55] wanted. He wanted a feminine spirit.
[38:59] And Esther took her own life into her
[39:02] hands to go before the king without and
[39:05] brother Paul Leontaine mentioned this
[39:07] just briefly right at the end.
[39:10] Um but watch how
[39:13] Esther carried herself to find favor
[39:16] with the king. It said you know and I'm
[39:18] not necessarily going to read all the
[39:19] scripture but she came in the house with
[39:22] her royal apparel on. Now that's the
[39:24] peril that the king would have gave her.
[39:26] And she stood in the inner courts of the
[39:28] house over against the king and sat in
[39:32] the throne of the royal over against the
[39:34] gates of the house. She she didn't barge
[39:38] in and dictate the atmosphere of the
[39:42] room. She stayed against the gates and
[39:46] the corner of the house.
[39:48] It wasn't necessarily that she couldn't
[39:51] have, but it was the atmosphere, the
[39:53] spirit that was around her was
[39:56] gentleness. You know, the Bible says
[39:58] things like this. He said, "Be careful
[40:00] that you don't sit on the front row and
[40:02] somebody more worthy come in and they
[40:03] have to move you to the back row to set
[40:05] the king
[40:07] here." You know, we're always the type.
[40:11] Well, I'm going to choose a good spot
[40:13] for
[40:14] me, not I'm going to choose a good spot
[40:17] for my brother or sister, and I'll take
[40:18] the back seat.
[40:21] And she obtained favor. You know, this
[40:22] part with the king, but I want to go to
[40:24] verse uh maybe three here. And then the
[40:27] king said unto her, "What wilt thou
[40:29] have, Esther?" Now, Esther could have
[40:31] asked for anything, and so could you.
[40:35] But she couldn't help herself because
[40:37] she just was who she was.
[40:40] And if we really get the baptism of the
[40:42] Holy Ghost and you really really are the
[40:45] right rib of God, the feminine spirit,
[40:48] then you'll just you won't be able to
[40:49] help yourself. You'll just be who you
[40:52] are. You could try to be something
[40:54] different, but you can't break that if
[40:56] you really
[40:59] get the spirit of God.
[41:03] said, "What would you have,
[41:05] Esther?" "Even to half my
[41:08] kingdom." Now, she could offer asked for
[41:12] some mighty, mighty big things. And
[41:15] brother Paul brought this out so
[41:16] beautifully. And Esther's like, "Oh,
[41:18] whoa, whoa, whoa." You know, it's like a
[41:20] husband say, "Honey, where you want to
[41:21] go?" Oh, it doesn't matter to me. Just
[41:23] wherever you like. What kind of Oh, it
[41:25] doesn't matter to me. Just blue's fine.
[41:39] It was the spirit that was coming out of
[41:41] her that the king loved.
[41:44] Oh, it doesn't really
[41:46] matter. He said, "But I'll give you
[41:48] everything." Oh, no, no, no. I'll be
[41:50] happy with a hot dog.
[41:56] And Esther said, you know, if it seemed
[41:59] good to
[42:00] you, like half the
[42:06] kingdom, you know, it'd be like I I know
[42:09] it's impossible to even get this through
[42:11] our if it'll only be God if you could,
[42:13] but just think like God, somebody offers
[42:15] you Canada and you own it. You're not
[42:17] leading it. You own it. You say, "Well,
[42:20] no. I'd rather just have church come
[42:22] over for supper.
[42:26] No, you wouldn't be human.
[42:28] That's right. No, like you're offered.
[42:37] Enormous wealth. Oh, well, if would you
[42:40] just would you come over for supper
[42:42] Tuesday night? Would that be
[42:46] okay? And the king on said on Tesser
[42:50] like really
[42:55] Hello.
[42:57] You know, and then we go to verse six.
[42:58] And the king said unto Esther at the
[43:00] banqueting table. Now they're there. And
[43:01] he said,
[43:02] "Now, what's your
[43:06] petition?" Like, "It shall be granted to
[43:09] you up to half my kingdom." She's like,
[43:13] "Oh, oh, would you come back next week
[43:17] for supper?" Yeah.
[43:19] the king's sake.
[43:22] Huh?
[43:36] But let's just watch this
[43:39] here. Watch how she says it in verse
[43:42] eight. If you think I'm exaggerating. If
[43:45] I found favor with you, king, and if it
[43:48] would please you and it you would be
[43:50] okay with
[43:52] it, would you grant my petition and just
[43:54] come for supper?
[43:57] And he's
[44:00] like, really?
[44:04] Like that's it?
[44:13] Wow.
[44:17] But watch the
[44:19] difference in verse
[44:21] nine. We have a new character coming on
[44:24] the
[44:25] scene. Then went Hmon forth that day
[44:34] joyful and
[44:37] glad. And when he
[44:39] saw Moriah in the king's gate, he and he
[44:43] didn't stand up. He said, didn't shake
[44:46] my hand. Walked right by me. Never even
[44:51] nodded. Because he had a masculine
[44:54] spirit. It bubbled in
[44:58] [Music]
[45:00] him. Couldn't happen with a feminine
[45:03] spirit.
[45:04] Feminine spirit. I I wouldn't I don't
[45:07] care. I don't care a lick. Make no
[45:10] difference to me. Because see, a
[45:12] feminine spirit is
[45:14] just
[45:17] free. It's a
[45:26] follower. And Mori never moved.
[45:32] And Hmon was full of indignation. I'm
[45:36] going to get you. Yeah.
[45:40] Uh-huh. You've all went to church with
[45:43] some people like that
[45:45] in the past. I pray. Nevertheless, Hmon
[45:49] reframed himself. It was hard. He said,
[45:51] "I'll wait till next
[45:53] Sunday." And when he came home, watch
[45:57] the difference in the spirit. And when
[45:58] he came home, he sent and he called his
[46:01] friends and and his wife. And Hmon with
[46:05] this masculine spirit told
[46:08] them. Now, I just want to back up. Like,
[46:11] who has more glory? The queen or a
[46:17] servant? Who was bragging about their
[46:20] glory? Not
[46:22] Esther. And Aman said, "I'm rich.
[46:27] I have multip kids wherein the king hath
[46:31] promoted
[46:32] them. And he said, "And how he's
[46:35] advanced me above all the princes and
[46:39] the servants of the
[46:44] king.
[46:45] Hmon was tooting his own
[46:50] horn." Well, I'm a message believer. I'm
[46:53] not part of that harlot system.
[46:56] I believe the truth.
[47:03] That's
[47:06] good. But your spirit's wrong.
[47:11] You know, Brother Brham said that we
[47:13] were the change in God's pocket. And we
[47:16] talked about this at the pastor's event.
[47:18] You know, this will make you fall right
[47:21] over. You know, I I just intersect with
[47:23] the story here. There was a pastor at
[47:25] the waist retreat and
[47:29] uh one of the sisters in the church
[47:31] married a
[47:33] Pentecostal person from the Pentecostal
[47:36] church.
[47:38] And it must have been a real believer
[47:41] because the Pentecostal man started
[47:43] coming with his wife to the message
[47:46] church. And lead us to say the
[47:48] Pentecostal pastor was just slightly
[47:52] disturbed. And the pastor was present
[47:55] with
[47:57] us. He said, "Oh boy, what am I going to
[48:03] do?" And that was his attitude. Oh boy,
[48:08] how are we going to fix
[48:10] this? Now, you could he could have said,
[48:13] "Oh boy, he's coming to the right church
[48:15] because we have all the
[48:17] answers." No, he didn't say that. He
[48:19] said, "Oh boy, how am I going to not
[48:20] offend him?
[48:23] cuz the Bible says that a man offended
[48:26] is harder to conquer than a wall city.
[48:29] And so the Pentecostal pastor got
[48:32] sick and he asked the brother in the
[48:34] church, he said, "Will you take me and
[48:36] we'll go visit him?" And he apologized
[48:39] bitterly to the pen, watch this. He
[48:43] apologized bitterly to the Pentecostal
[48:45] pastor for the brother coming and seeing
[48:47] the truth in the message church.
[48:56] And he
[49:00] said I you know just he said you know he
[49:04] was trying to win his
[49:07] heart. So when he was
[49:09] there he said I you know I take really
[49:13] good care of them. He invited the
[49:14] Pentecostal pastor. He said, "Come to
[49:17] our church and
[49:19] preach on
[49:23] Sunday." Now, some message believers
[49:25] would have said, "Wow, you got a Jezebel
[49:29] in the
[49:33] pulpit." The end of the story is he's
[49:36] been at the Pentecostal church more than
[49:38] he's got his own church preaching for
[49:39] him
[49:42] because he had a feminine spirit.
[49:49] see how he handled that
[49:51] situation. And so now the Pentecostal
[49:53] came and preached and repeatedly said
[49:56] multiple times, I'm there ministering in
[50:00] the Pentecostal church
[50:03] because he had, you know, see with with
[50:06] our masculine spirit, we will not add
[50:08] one soul to the kingdom of God. because
[50:11] I'm rigid, ignorant, rude, stuck up, and
[50:16] right if I'm on the word of God, won't
[50:19] add one soul to the kingdom of God.
[50:23] Cuz the
[50:24] spirit is wrong. See, God chose his
[50:29] wife,
[50:30] his
[50:32] bride to win souls.
[50:35] Not him.
[50:37] Not him. He chose his wife
[50:43] because she's like, "Oh, will you come
[50:46] for
[50:53] supper?" Verse 12. And Hmon said,
[50:57] "Moreover, yay, this Esther Queen, she
[51:00] does let nobody else come to her supper
[51:03] except me and the king. I must be
[51:06] important."
[51:08] See, he's tooting his own
[51:11] horn. The Bible says, we're going to get
[51:13] to a scripture down that says, "He that
[51:15] exalteth himself will be abased."
[51:20] And Hmon sure did get abased.
[51:25] Oh, bless God. Got it. Got to come in
[51:28] under
[51:31] me. Careful. Bless God. You got to see
[51:35] everything I seek.
[51:37] careful.
[51:47] Amen. Because Hmon was tooting his own
[51:51] horn so much, his family decided to
[51:53] build a
[51:54] gallows for his enemy.
[51:57] And now if we go to Esther 6 and we just
[51:59] go down here
[52:02] uh let's just go to Esther uh 6 and
[52:05] verse 6. You know above this you know
[52:09] the king couldn't rest and so people
[52:11] were reading the history books and they
[52:14] had realized that Moriah had been kind
[52:16] to the king. Now I want you to realize
[52:18] that Moriah was a slave and a beggar
[52:21] both. So he had no reason to be nice to,
[52:24] you know, a government that he didn't
[52:26] like, but he still was. Cuz see, Morai
[52:29] had a feminine spirit on him. And so the
[52:32] king realized that he hadn't been
[52:36] rightfully thanked for his
[52:39] kindness in protecting the king. So when
[52:41] we get to verse six here, Hmon comes
[52:43] into the king and he's walking like
[52:46] really like I'm a
[52:49] bakeshot. And the king
[52:51] says, "Hmon, what would you do to
[52:55] somebody that you would the king would
[52:57] delight to honor?" And Hmon, because he
[53:01] had a masculine spirit, was
[53:04] convinced it was
[53:06] him. The reason he was convinced was
[53:09] because of multiple reasons. Number one,
[53:12] he had the wrong spirit. But number two,
[53:14] he was the only one that was invited for
[53:16] supper. He was the one that the king had
[53:18] promoted with favor and and everything
[53:21] was going his way. Nobody had nobody had
[53:24] crossed his path and or and nobody had
[53:28] you know uh disagreed with his doctrine
[53:30] and you know the church had grown to a
[53:32] thousand people
[53:34] and and
[53:36] and here Jesus says,
[53:40] "Hmon, just just picture if if Hmon was
[53:43] your pastor and and the church was just
[53:47] thriving and and and God comes out and
[53:49] says, "Hmon, what would you do with
[53:51] somebody you'd want honor in
[53:55] Well, he
[53:57] says, "And Hmon tells him his heart,"
[54:01] which was evil, by the way. And he says,
[54:03] "You know, I would dress him up and I'd
[54:05] put all these things on. I ro him in the
[54:08] carriage and and have great delight and
[54:10] have his servants tell that this who the
[54:12] king wants honor." He said, "Okay, go do
[54:15] that to
[54:20] Moriah." And it crushed
[54:22] him. It crushed him
[54:25] greatly because when Hmon in verse 13
[54:28] when he come down and told his wife and
[54:30] his friends everything that had befallen
[54:32] him, he said his wise men and his wife
[54:35] Morai this, you know how he had had to
[54:38] honor these
[54:44] people and then he rushed out because he
[54:47] had to go to another dinner. So he
[54:49] thought things were going to improve.
[54:51] And let's just go to Esther 7 and verse
[54:54] one. And here, so the king and Hmon are
[54:58] at the second supper of Esther's. Now,
[55:01] she could have asked for everything, but
[55:03] she just asked for
[55:05] company. And the king said again to
[55:08] Esther the second time at the banquet
[55:10] day and the wine he said what is your
[55:12] petition queen that I should grant to
[55:16] you your request up to half my kingdom
[55:20] riches and
[55:22] glory. And Esther answered she
[55:26] said verse three. Sylvester answered and
[55:29] said, "If I found favor in thy sight, oh
[55:33] king, look at how gentle she is." Oh, if
[55:38] it'd be
[55:40] okay.
[55:41] Maybe. And it if it pleased
[55:45] you, save my
[55:48] life. Save my life. The king almost
[55:51] passed
[55:53] out. You're my queen.
[55:56] If it pleases
[55:58] you and if it would be okay with me for
[56:02] me to save your
[56:04] life. What are you talking
[56:09] about? For let my life be given as my
[56:12] petition and my people at my request.
[56:16] For we are sold,
[56:23] and I and my people are to be destroyed
[56:26] and
[56:27] slain and to perish. And the
[56:31] king was
[56:35] stunned. You know who had sold her
[56:38] people out? You know who was going to
[56:41] destroy and slay their people?
[56:45] the masculine spirit,
[56:49] the
[56:50] proud, the
[56:52] arrogant, the
[56:54] bigheaded, the I I I, the
[56:58] me. Here, Brother Bram says an
[57:00] influence. He says, "Oh, be conscious of
[57:03] your littleness. And if you want to find
[57:06] out how great you are, put your finger
[57:09] in a pool of water or a bucket of water
[57:12] and just pull out your finger and try to
[57:13] find your
[57:14] finger. You ain't nothing at
[57:19] all. Always be conscious of your
[57:22] littleness. First
[57:24] Peter, and we're going to go into
[57:26] another character, but I want to lay
[57:27] some scriptures here. And some of these
[57:29] quotes I read are directly tied to the
[57:32] scriptures. 1 Peter 5 5 and 6 and
[57:35] Vickiy's putting them up there
[57:36] beautifully. Thank you very much.
[57:38] Likewise, ye
[57:41] younger, submit yourself unto your
[57:48] elders. You
[57:50] know, when Brother Bram's wife slammed
[57:54] the door on Brother Bram, God didn't
[57:57] like that.
[57:59] And when you say something rude to your
[58:02] parents or somebody older than you, God
[58:05] don't like that.
[58:07] That's right. God don't like
[58:09] that. He don't like that at all. And
[58:12] their angel gets his feathers all
[58:15] fluffered up. Yeah. You know, if you say
[58:18] something rude and disgusting to these
[58:20] little cute kids, the Bible
[58:23] says, the Bible says that God has an
[58:27] angel that watches over
[58:30] them. And that angel could make
[58:32] hamburger out of you so
[58:35] quick. Because in God's
[58:40] eyes, they're equal.
[58:45] But we say rude things to old people.
[58:49] Oh, you spilled your food
[58:51] again. And we say rude things to young
[58:54] people. Oh, you spilled your food
[58:58] again. But God had an angel.
[59:04] I was watching those
[59:06] people. Ye,
[59:08] all of you be
[59:11] subjective one to another.
[59:15] be
[59:16] clothed in
[59:19] humility. I mean, that's you're packing
[59:22] it pretty regular. For God resisteth the
[59:28] proud and giveth grace unto the
[59:36] humble.
[59:39] Wow. That means if you have
[59:43] the truth for our
[59:45] day and the right message for our day.
[59:49] And God has blessed you in amazing grace
[59:53] with the correct
[59:55] revelation and took the seals off the
[59:58] Bible and revealed all the secrets to
[1:00:01] you and you're arrogant. You're going to
[1:00:07] hell. You say he said he resisted you.
[1:00:14] Now, if he resisted you, how could you
[1:00:16] go to
[1:00:19] heaven? Resisted. You know, we got news.
[1:00:23] Our
[1:00:24] neighbors are
[1:00:36] moving. They got something that many of
[1:00:39] us don't have.
[1:00:44] They got something maybe I don't even
[1:00:46] have.
[1:00:48] And they go to a Pentecostal church.
[1:00:58] It's the truth. They got the right
[1:01:01] spirit.
[1:01:05] They've done more for this church
[1:01:07] property since they moved next door than
[1:01:09] any person in this building, including
[1:01:14] myself. And they were attending the
[1:01:17] Baptist church and they paid tithe to
[1:01:18] me.
[1:01:23] But if you see them, the immediate
[1:01:25] thought comes out to your you judge them
[1:01:28] because they look
[1:01:31] different. And in the judgment, you
[1:01:34] could be very surprised.
[1:01:38] Could be extremely
[1:01:41] surprised that we think what we see with
[1:01:44] our eyes and our logic and our man's
[1:01:47] mind. You know, the Bible says that the
[1:01:50] creeds and your mind and the dogmas of
[1:01:53] men have made the power of God to none
[1:01:57] effect.
[1:02:07] Wow. God resisted the pals. Give grace
[1:02:10] to the humble. Humble yourself therefore
[1:02:13] under the mighty hand of God that he may
[1:02:17] exalt
[1:02:18] thee in due
[1:02:22] time. Well, I'm already arrived.
[1:02:27] You might be just right before an abase.
[1:02:34] A direct quote to that scripture.
[1:02:37] Brother Bram said in demonology of
[1:02:39] religion, he said, "A humble submitted
[1:02:43] heart and simplicity is what brings you
[1:02:47] to God." Oh, I thought it was the
[1:02:52] word. I thought it was the correct
[1:02:54] doctrine.
[1:02:56] A humble and submitted heart and
[1:03:00] simplicity brings you to God. Now, if
[1:03:02] you have that, it'll bring you to the
[1:03:04] correct word. I'm not. But if you have
[1:03:06] the correct word and you don't have the
[1:03:08] other,
[1:03:09] you don't pad your back cuz you might be
[1:03:12] surprised.
[1:03:15] And the true humble heart, God loves. No
[1:03:18] matter if you know your ABCs, it don't
[1:03:21] make no difference. Just be humble. God
[1:03:24] dwells in the human heart. And the lower
[1:03:28] you can break yourself down and the more
[1:03:32] simple you can
[1:03:36] become. The greater in God's sight you
[1:03:39] are. Do we believe
[1:03:43] that? Here if you want to get somewhere
[1:03:46] with God and humble thyself, never let
[1:03:49] an arrogant spirit get on you.
[1:03:52] Remember, God loved you. I'm dropping
[1:03:54] down further in the paragraph. God loved
[1:03:57] you when you were in sin. And if the
[1:04:00] spirit of God's in you, you'll love
[1:04:03] another person
[1:04:07] when he's been wronged.
[1:04:10] Say, "Bless God, they don't have a
[1:04:12] revelation." What you still love them.
[1:04:18] You love and forgive them regardless of
[1:04:20] if they ever get it. when you're still
[1:04:24] alive. James 4:6 and 7. But he giveth
[1:04:27] more grace. Therefore he saith God
[1:04:29] resisteth the proud and giveth grace
[1:04:32] unto the humble. Submit yourselves
[1:04:34] therefore before God. Resist the devil
[1:04:36] and he'll flee from you. Matthew
[1:04:40] 23:12. And whosoever shall exalt him
[1:04:43] exalt
[1:04:44] himself shall be abased.
[1:04:49] Be careful preaching the doctrine that
[1:04:51] you're so blessed that you know the
[1:04:53] revelations of God because it might be
[1:04:56] right before an obeasing
[1:05:00] coming and he shall and he that shall
[1:05:04] humble himself shall be
[1:05:07] exalted in questions and answers. Isn't
[1:05:10] this just the way Isn't that just the
[1:05:13] way that people get today? Let God bless
[1:05:17] some fellow and put a little confidence
[1:05:19] in him. God would put a little
[1:05:20] confidence in us and he would get a
[1:05:23] know-it-all
[1:05:25] spirit. He would
[1:05:27] change his
[1:05:31] spirit. You know, like you you think of
[1:05:33] that in your own household, a a true
[1:05:36] feminine
[1:05:37] spirit, they never you know, my wife has
[1:05:40] a fault. You know, we go out to the
[1:05:42] restaurant and she pays and we get in
[1:05:45] the car and she says, "Thanks for buying
[1:05:49] lunch." I
[1:05:51] see. I didn't
[1:05:53] pay. You got a job. I don't.
[1:06:01] And normally I say then, "Well, thank
[1:06:03] you Jesus for buying lunch."
[1:06:06] But you see how the feminine spirit's
[1:06:08] just like, "Well, it doesn't matter to
[1:06:10] me."
[1:06:12] If we serve God like, "Well, God, it
[1:06:14] don't matter how you take care of your
[1:06:16] kingdom. We know you will. You promise
[1:06:19] you'd never lead us. Leave
[1:06:21] us." But watch how this in this
[1:06:24] continuing this uh this quote here in
[1:06:26] questions answer. So, God has a hard
[1:06:28] time trying to get somebody that he can
[1:06:31] deal with that'll stay humble and meek
[1:06:34] and stay in the place until God calls
[1:06:37] him to do something. He wants to become
[1:06:39] some great person that I do what I me me
[1:06:43] my I
[1:06:45] ours. And that's the wrong
[1:06:48] attitude. That's what the prophet said.
[1:06:54] God's hunting for somebody who he can
[1:06:57] bless and pour out his blessings, more
[1:06:59] and more blessings, and the man will
[1:07:01] just get littleer and littleer and
[1:07:02] littleer and littleer.
[1:07:05] And you'll never get more of God until
[1:07:08] you become
[1:07:10] nothing. Well, bless God. I got saved a
[1:07:13] long time ago. I sat
[1:07:15] under.
[1:07:17] So, but I went
[1:07:19] to So,
[1:07:22] You'll never become no more with God
[1:07:26] till you become nothing. You got to
[1:07:28] belittle. Watch this. Belittle
[1:07:34] yourself. And then he will exalt
[1:07:37] himself.
[1:07:38] And he that will exalt himself, sorry,
[1:07:41] God will bring a base. And he that will
[1:07:44] humble himself, God. You know, I would
[1:07:47] rather be exalted by God than be exalted
[1:07:51] by myself. You know, when you have
[1:07:53] believers around you and you don't have
[1:07:56] to tell them nothing and people come up
[1:07:58] praising, you know, or behind your back
[1:08:00] rather than saying how how arrogant you
[1:08:04] are, they go behind your back and say,
[1:08:06] "Now there's a real believer. Now
[1:08:09] there's a real sister." And you know
[1:08:10] when the words going, you wait a minute
[1:08:13] now. I just came from a large pastor's
[1:08:15] wife's retreat. There's pastors people
[1:08:17] said, you know, there's people sitting
[1:08:19] in the church and they're just smiling
[1:08:20] and and their spirits just like that's
[1:08:24] so
[1:08:31] beautiful. It's because of
[1:08:34] humility. And the pastors that are
[1:08:37] preaching to those kind of people, they
[1:08:38] say, "Wow, do I ever got
[1:08:41] some real sons and daughters of God
[1:08:46] because other people will recognize the
[1:08:50] spirit that God placed in them.
[1:08:54] You got to get little before you can get
[1:08:57] big. And you'll never be big in your own
[1:09:00] self. Oh, nobody believes
[1:09:03] that. I mean, well, nobody practice.
[1:09:06] Very few practice it. Who don't want to
[1:09:09] be seen as worthy in public?
[1:09:24] Huh? You'll only be as big as God will
[1:09:28] be as big in
[1:09:29] you. Amen. God help us. Luke 14:11. And
[1:09:33] whosoever shall exalt himself shall be a
[1:09:35] base. Whosoever shall humble same as
[1:09:38] Matthew humble himself shall be exalted.
[1:09:40] Let's just move into another example.
[1:09:43] And we have another one. Matthew
[1:09:45] 15:22 to 24. Here we see a a woman from
[1:09:50] Canaan. And Jesus was actually on the
[1:09:53] journey. If you read this in Matthew 15,
[1:09:55] he was on the journey to somebody's
[1:09:57] house to heal their daughter. And this
[1:10:00] woman caught the heart of God. But it
[1:10:02] was her humbleness that caught the heart
[1:10:04] of God. and she came from the same coast
[1:10:07] and she cried unto him,"Lord have mercy
[1:10:10] on me, thou son of David, for I'm vexed
[1:10:12] with the
[1:10:13] devil." And he God ignored
[1:10:18] her. I I want to just tell you
[1:10:21] personally, if if any one of us treated
[1:10:24] each other or if I treated you like
[1:10:27] Jesus treated this woman, you wouldn't
[1:10:28] come next Sunday. No.
[1:10:31] And I don't think I would come next
[1:10:32] Sunday either, be quite honest with you.
[1:10:35] So, I'm just as human as anybody else.
[1:10:38] If my wife treated me like this, I would
[1:10:41] have
[1:10:43] difficulties. But see, Jesus was doing
[1:10:45] this to show a
[1:10:49] spirit. See, a feminine spirit can be
[1:10:53] squashed and they still
[1:10:58] just it it's the truth.
[1:11:03] Many of you wives were blamed for stuff
[1:11:06] you never had nothing to do
[1:11:08] with. Unless your home's different than
[1:11:11] mine, cuz I had to get converted a lot
[1:11:14] of
[1:11:16] times.
[1:11:19] Amen. A lot of
[1:11:21] times. But now you just think of that
[1:11:24] spiritually. And if we go to verse
[1:11:26] 26, and he said, "It is not meat to take
[1:11:30] the children's bread and cast it to
[1:11:32] dogs." And she said, you know, the
[1:11:35] scripture said, "Yes, Lord, but the dogs
[1:11:37] eat the crumbs." Now, let's look at what
[1:11:38] the prophet said of this. If we just
[1:11:41] jump to the next quote here, he
[1:11:44] says, "No matter what the obstacles
[1:11:47] were, she kept her
[1:11:49] faith. She never ever left the faith.
[1:11:54] She held on to it. And the next here in
[1:11:58] perseverance, he said, "She admitted to
[1:12:03] Jesus that I'm just a
[1:12:07] dog."
[1:12:12] Wow. A dog's pretty low
[1:12:15] life. The prophet said, "She admitted
[1:12:18] she wasn't nothing but a dog, but she
[1:12:21] was just after some crumbs.
[1:12:26] You know, if we serve God in our church,
[1:12:29] like saying we're nothing but the least
[1:12:31] of a little tiny gathering, you know,
[1:12:33] but God, if you just stop by, just just
[1:12:37] give us a little tiny bit of
[1:12:39] yourself.
[1:12:43] Woo! Now, see, oh, what the difference
[1:12:50] was. She was pushed back. She was shoved
[1:12:53] back. She was shoved out and put
[1:12:56] outside. But she never give up. See what
[1:12:59] I said about the feminine spirit. You
[1:13:01] can you can insult a fe your wife and
[1:13:04] she'll still cook you breakfast. You can
[1:13:07] tell her she burnt the breakfast and she
[1:13:09] might give you
[1:13:11] lunch. It's it's a re it's a resounding
[1:13:15] spirit. You you offend a masculine
[1:13:18] spirit and say, "I'll teach you a
[1:13:20] lesson."
[1:13:22] I'll get even with you. I'm not talking
[1:13:25] to you. I ain't coming by there again.
[1:13:28] Not a masculine spirit. Every one of you
[1:13:30] mothers in here, your kids could do
[1:13:32] anything to you at all. Insult you
[1:13:35] bitterly and it it it would barely
[1:13:37] barely give you a hiccup. You just like,
[1:13:39] "Oh,
[1:13:40] boo. Oh,
[1:13:42] boo." But they'd insult their dad just
[1:13:46] like, "I'm going to rewrite the will."
[1:13:50] Yeah.
[1:13:54] It's as different as the night is from
[1:13:55] day.
[1:14:03] Wow. Here in the end of this quote,
[1:14:05] Brother Bram says, "Don't take too high
[1:14:07] of a seat. Take a back seat." Just no,
[1:14:10] not in church. He's not talking about he
[1:14:11] means in life. He says, "Just a little
[1:14:14] person. The way up is down always. He
[1:14:17] that humbles himself shall be exalted
[1:14:20] and he that exalts himself shall be
[1:14:22] abased. That's up is down
[1:14:27] always. Luke 18:14 we see everyone that
[1:14:31] exalts himself shall be a base and some
[1:14:34] of these were doubles here sorry or or
[1:14:37] saying the same thing.
[1:14:38] Hebrews 16:18, "The proud goeth before
[1:14:42] destruction, and a hotty spirit before a
[1:14:46] fall. Better is it to be of a humble
[1:14:50] spirit with
[1:14:51] lowliness than divide the
[1:14:54] spoils of the proud."
[1:15:00] Proverbs 18:12, before destruction, the
[1:15:03] heart of a man is
[1:15:05] hotty, but before honor is
[1:15:10] humility. It It's such a reverse
[1:15:12] psychology. You know, my last character
[1:15:14] in the Bible, I want to show you the
[1:15:17] exact two spirits again. You know, in
[1:15:21] the day of King
[1:15:23] Uzziah, he was a man of God. And it it
[1:15:28] would behoove us all to study Hezekiah
[1:15:31] tremendously because he was a man of God
[1:15:34] at a young age 16 and and uh different
[1:15:38] scriptures here. But it he did right in
[1:15:41] the sight of the Lord. The Bible said
[1:15:43] and the Bible literally says that they
[1:15:45] made God made him to
[1:15:47] prosper in verse
[1:15:50] four. and he became strong in verse 16
[1:15:54] in uh 2 Colossians 26 and verse 16. And
[1:15:58] when he was strong in his heart, he
[1:16:00] became lifted
[1:16:02] up to his
[1:16:04] destruction. How many times does that
[1:16:07] happen in our own lives? You know,
[1:16:09] brother Bram said multiple time I
[1:16:11] mentioned this in the past, you know,
[1:16:12] and in study and brother Bram said, "The
[1:16:15] reason that we lose faith in God is
[1:16:17] because God don't move in the way that
[1:16:18] we prayed.
[1:16:22] if if he don't answer it in the time
[1:16:24] frame or or in the in the way. And so
[1:16:27] here King Hezekiah was a man of God that
[1:16:31] had favor with God and God was pleased
[1:16:33] with him and God blessed him and he
[1:16:35] became arrogant and he went in the
[1:16:38] tabernacle and he started offering
[1:16:41] incense. And you know the story, I know
[1:16:43] you do. And the ministers, the Levites
[1:16:46] came and they said, "You know, King, we
[1:16:49] love you. Live forever, but you're out
[1:16:52] of your
[1:16:56] place." And King Hezekiah was
[1:17:00] wroth. You will never
[1:17:03] see, watch this church, you can't show
[1:17:06] one scripture in the Bible where a
[1:17:08] feminine spirit was ever
[1:17:11] wroth. It's not possible.
[1:17:20] He was
[1:17:21] wroth at the plan and the law of God.
[1:17:24] The very God that had blessed him and
[1:17:27] was pleased with his life and had put
[1:17:30] him in a
[1:17:31] position. He'd get high and lifted up
[1:17:33] and arrogant and
[1:17:35] cocky and God was about to knock the
[1:17:38] staples out from underneath of them.
[1:17:41] And literally in the hotty
[1:17:44] spirit and the the haste of his attitude
[1:17:50] attacking the ministry, God struck him
[1:17:52] with
[1:17:54] leprosy. Maybe we'll read
[1:17:59] that. Let's just go in uh You got that
[1:18:02] up there,
[1:18:04] Vicki? 2 Colossians
[1:18:07] 26. I've just been following down.
[1:18:10] you've been doing
[1:18:16] fantastic. And verse 17, and the priests
[1:18:19] went after him and and and said to the
[1:18:21] king, four score the priests, four
[1:18:23] priests went to him and said, the Lord
[1:18:25] that that you are valiant men. You're
[1:18:28] you're a wonderful king. Verse 18, and
[1:18:30] they withtood King Hezekiah and said
[1:18:32] unto him, it apparent not unto thee. The
[1:18:37] king was doing something that the
[1:18:39] ministry was to
[1:18:43] do. And if you watch the end of that
[1:18:46] script scripture, it says, "Neither
[1:18:47] shall thou thou thou honor be honored
[1:18:50] from God." And verse 19, "And King
[1:18:53] Hezekiah was wroth and had a a a sensor
[1:18:59] in his hand to burn incense. And while
[1:19:02] he was wrought, the priests wrought with
[1:19:06] God's
[1:19:07] people. That in this case, the king was
[1:19:10] wroth with the
[1:19:13] ministry. But how can God be wroth with
[1:19:19] God? If you're wroth with somebody else
[1:19:22] that's in God's
[1:19:25] family, the people will literally watch
[1:19:27] you turn to
[1:19:28] leprosy because in the in the presence
[1:19:32] of him being wroth to the ministry, his
[1:19:35] countenance changed and leprosy grew on
[1:19:39] him. You say, "Well, my skin's clean."
[1:19:42] It can be spiritual
[1:19:43] leprosy. And it was eternal separation
[1:19:46] from God.
[1:19:49] And there was a prophet in that
[1:19:51] day,
[1:19:53] Isaiah. And he was so influenced and
[1:19:56] shook by this presence of the king and
[1:19:59] how God dealt with him and all that. Do
[1:20:01] you know Isaiah wrote the middle book of
[1:20:03] the Bible? He wrote 66 chapters, which
[1:20:06] is every book of the Bible. And he
[1:20:08] literally wrote the story of the Bible
[1:20:11] from the beginning to end in one
[1:20:13] book. And the king or the prophet
[1:20:16] Isaiah, he ran to the
[1:20:20] temple and he seen the Lord filled the
[1:20:23] temple, the train. And you know it tells
[1:20:25] the scriptures here in Isaiah 6 1:5 he
[1:20:29] the
[1:20:32] king was dead now and he ran to the
[1:20:36] scripture and the prophet seen the
[1:20:38] tabernacle of the Lord was filled with
[1:20:42] the train of the Lord and the saraphims
[1:20:46] were in there and you know they talked
[1:20:47] about their wings but they had six wings
[1:20:50] and one wing two of the wings they
[1:20:52] covered their face and two wings that
[1:20:55] covered their feet and two they didn't
[1:20:58] move. And in verse four is the most
[1:21:01] beautiful scriptures because the prophet
[1:21:04] ran to the house of God and was crying
[1:21:07] out and said, "I am, you know, among
[1:21:08] evil men and and I'm undone." And you
[1:21:11] know the story, they took the coal off
[1:21:13] the fire and burn his lips. Literally
[1:21:16] the power of God fell in the place like
[1:21:19] a fog, like a smoke. And the smoke was
[1:21:23] so powerful in the temple that it moved
[1:21:25] the anchor
[1:21:27] post on the
[1:21:30] corner. And watch here in our next quote
[1:21:33] of the prophet, it says the the first
[1:21:36] thing that happened was the presence of
[1:21:38] God was reverence. If you want anything
[1:21:41] from God, you're going to be
[1:21:43] reverent. You start dictating to your
[1:21:46] dad how much you're going to get in the
[1:21:48] out of his bank account. you possibly
[1:21:51] could get a
[1:21:53] surprise. And the very second thing was
[1:21:56] the angels had
[1:21:58] humility, were humble, and they covered
[1:22:01] their feet. And watch what watch what
[1:22:03] the prophet says here. He says, "Oh,
[1:22:05] look at how God was preparing preparing
[1:22:08] his prophets in reverence, humility, and
[1:22:12] in action." And that's God's
[1:22:14] ways. The servants are oh my. That's the
[1:22:18] way we should be. Reverence to God's
[1:22:21] word, humble and in action for God. Now
[1:22:25] watch how he shows us here. He says,
[1:22:27] "Like Moses in his
[1:22:29] presence, he took off his
[1:22:31] shoes and uncovered his
[1:22:35] feet." And I like the next one best.
[1:22:40] Paul when he was found in the presence
[1:22:42] of Jesus, we we get this religious idea
[1:22:45] in our head. Paul when he was found in
[1:22:48] the presence of Jesus in the pillar of
[1:22:50] power, he fell on the
[1:22:52] ground off his feet and he put his face
[1:22:58] where his feet were supposed to be.
[1:23:04] Can you imagine if message believers in
[1:23:06] churches would would be so consumed with
[1:23:10] the presence of God that where we put
[1:23:12] our feet on the floor that we would have
[1:23:14] our
[1:23:15] face and our feet would be above our
[1:23:19] face. Do you see what he says there? And
[1:23:21] where his feet should have been, he had
[1:23:24] his face and
[1:23:28] humility completely prostrated.
[1:23:34] before the Holy Spirit.
[1:23:40] John the Baptist, one of the greatest
[1:23:44] prophets, 400 years, he said, "I'm not
[1:23:46] worthy to even touch the
[1:23:48] shoelaces of his feet." And we walk
[1:23:52] around sometimes around our brothers and
[1:23:57] sisters with not the same
[1:24:00] spirit. Infl and and in the next quote
[1:24:04] here in influence he says now if you
[1:24:07] don't have any reverence to God
[1:24:09] everybody just thinks he was so secure
[1:24:13] till they didn't reverence God like they
[1:24:16] should have. Why? Now I I want you to
[1:24:18] catch this.
[1:24:20] Why God always veiled himself in badger
[1:24:24] skin? Why do people not reverence each
[1:24:28] other? Because of the
[1:24:32] veil. Because they're not conscience of
[1:24:35] the presence of God. Watch this. Now,
[1:24:38] this is a powerful quote near the bottom
[1:24:40] there. And that's the reason people do
[1:24:43] that. They don't recognize it. They
[1:24:46] can't
[1:24:47] comprehend that they're in the presence
[1:24:50] of God. Now, anytime you get a hotty
[1:24:52] spirit or anybody or a dictatorial
[1:24:56] spirit, a masculine spirit against
[1:24:58] another brother or sister, even though
[1:25:00] you think you're right and they're
[1:25:02] wrong, watch what he says. In their
[1:25:05] mind, they become so perverted to take
[1:25:07] up things of the world till they didn't
[1:25:09] even pay attention to it. And they would
[1:25:11] go to church,
[1:25:13] sure, but they didn't recognize when
[1:25:16] they went to
[1:25:18] church that they were in the presence of
[1:25:22] God. And not only
[1:25:25] church, but wherever you are, you're in
[1:25:28] the presence of God. And if they could
[1:25:30] do like David said, I put the Lord
[1:25:33] always before my face, therefore I shall
[1:25:38] not be moved.
[1:25:42] Wow. I want to close with a a couple
[1:25:47] illustrations here. You know the
[1:25:49] story of the real drunk man that was in
[1:25:53] the bar. I personally experienced that.
[1:25:56] Not I mean personally, but I personally
[1:25:58] know somebody in Uganda was like that. A
[1:26:02] sister at brother Leo's church. his her
[1:26:05] husband is a
[1:26:06] policeman and he will go to the bar and
[1:26:10] preach drinking liquor. He'll say, "The
[1:26:14] only religion, the only God that's real
[1:26:16] is the God that my wife
[1:26:18] serves." And I'll tell you in advance,
[1:26:20] it's not because she has a masculine
[1:26:22] spirit.
[1:26:25] It's because she's a feminine.
[1:26:29] And you know the story how this goes. I
[1:26:31] just have it pre-thode. But all the
[1:26:33] other friends in the bar, they said,
[1:26:35] "Nope." They said, "There is no real
[1:26:37] believers." You know, if just in case
[1:26:40] you don't know that, that's the state
[1:26:41] that the world's
[1:26:43] in
[1:26:44] today. And that's the reason this church
[1:26:47] is mostly empty cuz nobody believes that
[1:26:50] there even is a God, cuz they ain't
[1:26:53] never seen a God. And don't think
[1:26:55] they're thinking of the spirit God.
[1:26:57] They're thinking of something real.
[1:26:59] They're thinking of a god with flesh in
[1:27:01] which is in his bride.
[1:27:04] And the husband was a complete loser,
[1:27:11] sinner. And the husband was a complete
[1:27:13] loser. But he knew one
[1:27:19] thing that there was a feminine god in
[1:27:22] his
[1:27:23] wife. And he said, "We'll go home and be
[1:27:26] real drunk. real real real really really
[1:27:30] drunk and we're going to smash
[1:27:33] everything. That would lose most of us
[1:27:35] right
[1:27:37] there. And I'll prove to
[1:27:40] you. And she cooked them the only food
[1:27:42] they had in the house cuz he was an
[1:27:44] alcoholic and tried to cook the
[1:27:46] breakfast how he liked it and he smashed
[1:27:48] it on the floor and you know how it
[1:27:49] goes. And they went outside trying to
[1:27:52] now he's proven a point but he's a loser
[1:27:56] trying to prove a
[1:27:58] point. And she started singing must
[1:28:00] Jesus bear the cross
[1:28:02] alone and all the world go
[1:28:07] free. There's a cross for
[1:28:11] everyone. And there's a cross for me.
[1:28:21] And their church grew
[1:28:24] a whole bunch.
[1:28:28] And their church grew a whole bunch.
[1:28:36] Brother Bram tells a story about the
[1:28:37] minister that went up and he had it all
[1:28:39] put together and he went up real
[1:28:41] arrogant and the spirit of God never
[1:28:44] came down on his service and he left
[1:28:46] really deflated. And there was a
[1:28:49] minister there and he said if he would
[1:28:50] have went up like he came down, he would
[1:28:53] have came down like he went
[1:28:56] up cuz he thought he was.
[1:29:00] You can't change the program of
[1:29:03] God. I want to show you
[1:29:06] something and I I want to say this in a
[1:29:09] correct way and I'm
[1:29:12] closing. We get
[1:29:15] so well maybe I shouldn't say we maybe I
[1:29:19] I get so arrogant in my way of
[1:29:23] thinking that I wouldn't even
[1:29:26] consider another
[1:29:28] thought. Is there other any other humans
[1:29:30] here?
[1:29:32] There's a few humans. Okay. Then you
[1:29:35] would do the same thing.
[1:29:37] Only if you're a human. It's a special
[1:29:39] gift. Let me give you an example.
[1:29:43] We were somewhere this
[1:29:54] week among
[1:29:58] believers. And it came up that one of
[1:30:01] the
[1:30:02] people had
[1:30:05] mentioned that America has never went to
[1:30:08] the moon.
[1:30:11] I don't care what your thoughts are in
[1:30:12] that. It's not about that. I'm trying to
[1:30:14] prove a point
[1:30:16] here. And somebody contacted that
[1:30:19] person. You said, "You're not one of
[1:30:20] those crazy people that believe that we
[1:30:23] never did go
[1:30:25] there." And somebody else sitting around
[1:30:27] the same table said, "Well, I suppose
[1:30:29] you've met those flat earth people that
[1:30:31] believe the earth is on
[1:30:34] stilts." or the ones that believe that
[1:30:36] the government is fraying spray out of
[1:30:38] the airplanes over our
[1:30:41] skies.
[1:30:43] Or and it went
[1:30:45] on and it was
[1:30:48] on and I was in that
[1:30:57] presence and that spirit's so arrogant.
[1:31:05] That spirit's so arrogant that they
[1:31:08] wouldn't even consider the
[1:31:12] possibility. The spirit of arrogance
[1:31:15] wouldn't even consider that maybe the
[1:31:17] way I was raised
[1:31:19] or maybe the way that I've always
[1:31:21] believed I don't mean the message now
[1:31:25] the interpretation of the truth
[1:31:29] like God's right.
[1:31:34] But they wouldn't even consider that the
[1:31:36] interpretation of God, let me rephrase
[1:31:38] it that way,
[1:31:40] was wrong.
[1:31:44] And that's exactly how
[1:31:46] God will destroy
[1:31:52] America because they are so full of
[1:31:56] themselves. The boon's going to pop
[1:32:01] with a needle called
[1:32:03] God. Now, it's not because I don't like
[1:32:06] Americans. I just My wife's an American,
[1:32:09] by the way.
[1:32:11] It's the
[1:32:13] spirit and the Bible
[1:32:16] says that if you are exalted
[1:32:21] by yourself, just let this sink in, that
[1:32:25] God will pop your balloon.
[1:32:34] And you might wonder why I brought that
[1:32:36] up, but I had a family that used to
[1:32:40] attend here
[1:32:44] on a regular basis.
[1:32:52] 45 minutes from
[1:32:53] here. He's come here with his kids,
[1:32:56] extended family, other people in his
[1:32:58] town. He was from Elsie
[1:33:01] Craig. And I had two evangelists that I
[1:33:04] have respect for today. And they laughed
[1:33:07] at him because he thought the earth was
[1:33:10] flat.
[1:33:15] And he's not here now.
[1:33:22] He's not here now.
[1:33:26] We have no business
[1:33:28] laughing
[1:33:30] at people.
[1:33:33] We have no business laughing at people.
[1:33:36] If
[1:33:38] somebody has a thought,
[1:33:41] leave it alone.
[1:33:44] Leave it alone. If they ask your
[1:33:45] opinion,
[1:33:47] fine. Now, that's scripture
[1:33:50] because the Bible says somebody that's
[1:33:52] offended
[1:33:54] is harder to win back than a Walt City.
[1:33:57] And so God was trying to win a soul.
[1:34:02] But the ministry
[1:34:04] was so locked in their man's ideas that
[1:34:08] they removed the power of God and the
[1:34:10] man left the church.
[1:34:13] That's right.
[1:34:17] Because the creeds and dogmas of
[1:34:21] men made the word of
[1:34:25] God to none effect.
[1:34:30] Whose
[1:34:31] blood will that friend of mine be on?
[1:34:44] Be careful how you insult people
[1:34:48] because you could be insulting
[1:34:51] God.
[1:34:58] God. Remember, David was runy and
[1:35:03] ugly and
[1:35:05] stinky and had no beauty or
[1:35:10] brains. And God said, "He was a man
[1:35:12] after my own
[1:35:14] heart." And Jesus
[1:35:17] came and he had no
[1:35:19] beauty that would desire him. And people
[1:35:23] thought he was
[1:35:27] You see, and that spirit has not died.
[1:35:33] Matter of fact, that spirit's not even
[1:35:34] in the denominational churches. It's in
[1:35:37] the message churches
[1:35:40] to insult
[1:35:42] people and laugh at people because
[1:35:44] they're ideologically
[1:35:47] look or are different.
[1:35:52] That's right.
[1:35:55] than you think.
[1:36:00] Let's
[1:36:11] stand. Hallelujah. God help me to be
[1:36:15] what he made me to be.
[1:36:19] And in Genesis 1:26 and 27, he took the
[1:36:24] feminine part of
[1:36:26] himself out of himself and he sent that
[1:36:30] feminine part of himself to earth and he
[1:36:32] veiled it in flesh and said those people
[1:36:36] will win my
[1:36:38] kingdom. Amen. Sheltered safe from the
[1:36:41] arms of God.
[1:36:43] I feel the
[1:36:47] touch of hands so kind and
[1:36:52] [Music]
[1:36:54] tender. They lead in
[1:36:58] me and pass that I was strong.
[1:37:06] I am
[1:37:10] the
[1:37:13] [Music]
[1:37:26] Jesus. Heat.
[1:37:28] [Music]

[1:40:06] And
[1:40:15] I
[1:40:17] [Music]
[1:40:20] be I just like to share something that
[1:40:23] came to me I felt to to share. Brother
[1:40:26] Bram said that God's children are like
[1:40:30] loose change in your
[1:40:34] pocket. And he said God uses all
[1:40:39] of the change.
[1:40:42] And it's not our business to decide
[1:40:45] who's a silver dollar and who's a 50
[1:40:48] cent piece or a quarter, nickel or
[1:40:50] dime and even a penny. And in that
[1:40:53] quote, and I'm just paraphrasing,
[1:40:56] Brother Bram said, "If you run into a
[1:40:59] penny that does not even believe the
[1:41:02] truth,
[1:41:10] don't kick it
[1:41:11] out because God will use that penny
[1:41:15] for his kingdom." Amen.
[1:41:18] [Music]
[1:41:22] That would just kind of lower the bars
[1:41:24] of us all having an opinion of God's
[1:41:27] money.
[1:41:30] God uses all of his money.
[1:41:34] And if you're a dime or a nickel, you're
[1:41:36] still valuable. You're still a dime or a
[1:41:38] nickel. And it takes a dime and nickels
[1:41:40] to make a dollar. That's
[1:41:43] right. Amen.
[1:41:47] Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we love you.
[1:41:50] Thank you, Lord, for your your
[1:41:52] atmosphere and your anointing and
[1:41:54] presence in this place. Kind of a
[1:41:57] different type of
[1:41:59] a message, Lord God. We never know how
[1:42:02] you'll move, Lord
[1:42:04] Jesus, but we accept you and love you.
[1:42:07] Bless these wonderful, amazing people.
[1:42:11] They're yours, Lord God. You paid the
[1:42:13] price on
[1:42:16] Calvary and we're just part of your
[1:42:19] family and we're so h happy to be a part
[1:42:22] of the family. And Lord, we just pray
[1:42:25] that we won't remove any of the
[1:42:28] family because they're watching the
[1:42:31] sheep.
[1:42:33] Help us not to remove any of the
[1:42:37] family because they're short and
[1:42:40] runny and they smell like sheep.
[1:42:43] [Music]
[1:42:48] Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you this
[1:42:50] morning.
[1:42:57] The Lord
