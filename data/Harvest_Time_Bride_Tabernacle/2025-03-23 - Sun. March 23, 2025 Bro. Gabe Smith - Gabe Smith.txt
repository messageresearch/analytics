said be so supernaturally according to your word thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah thank you Lord God I want to sing that song all as well just a little testimony before we sing it you know our Prophet taught us that when the devil fights there's something good coming amen that's right when the devil fights really hard it means there's something better coming amen many many are out this morning Matt's family and sister Patty brother Gabe woke up this morning with no car running no battery he went to the gas station and the gas pump wouldn't work he came yesterday and his daughter was sick feelings had to car stick today Tred to cut his hand off amen we just recognize that so clearly it's just so obvious Satan's trying to distract take away trying to amen and everything but we know he's defeated amen completely defeated amen and we just look forward to what God has for us all is well when the world's falling apart around you it's still well God knows exactly what he's doing it's a tool in his hand listening to the message last night in the seals he says those all a tool in God's hand he's just communist as a tool in his hand don't mistake in the Antichrist these other things are just tools he's bringing her all together in a big Capstone really soon amen hallelujah we just invite our brother to come and he's actually can come and start setting up even before we finish if

Lord hallelujah Jesus blessed be your name oh hallelujah praise the Lord this uh thank you Jesus it's good to be uh in the house of the Lord this morning amen and uh I uh just want to uh greet all of you in the name of the Lord amen appreciate um opportunity to be here with you this morning and uh just want to send uh greetings from across the border and uh thank you Lord uh our pastor brother Chad Lamb wanted to uh to greet you and um trust that um something will be said today to be a help to you on your Christian Journey um we uh um I know it's our first time uh maybe uh meeting most of you you know uh brother Carson and uh and um I I got something on my heart and um you know um I I kind of uh I don't want to say I I I I struggle with a little bit I I just I kept uh I kept asking the Lord I said like Lord you sure are you are you sure uh cuz uh you know I was thinking Lord that that may pinch you a little bit right and uh you know you you think well Lord I want to preach something good they they make them so they like me first before and I'll pinch them later you know but but um I I just want to I just want to be obedient to what the Lord uh has has put on my heart you know um this is uh this is called the house of correction and and and the prophet of God said that if we come here for any other reason yes yeah then to be corrected he said you why he said you coming from the wrong reason and and um and so um me as a man I I am certainly not here to correct you but I I know God's word is is sent to us to bring correction and and so I I know what what God has placed on my heart um has been uh such a um a um a blessing to me and uh if you uh if I can give it to you the way the Lord give it to me I know it'll be a help to you and so um I just want to um I I I do I do have PowerPoint and I just um I pray that it'll be a help to you I'm a I'm a I'm a visual kind of person and so um you know if uh if you're super revelated you don't need and you don't need uh uh images you just close your eyes but uh you know you know as a minister you I've seen a lot of times not not to maybe to be critical but you know I've seen preachers come and they'll they they spend most of the service preaching to the pastor right and uh and uh trying to show how much they know but but when when I when I stand behind the sacred desk I I'm not worried about brother Dale so much yeah but but but who I who I who I aim for is them little ones where their eyes is just barely over the pews I uh those are the ones cuz if if I know if I can if I can get them then I know you'll get something too because to me I believe the day is dark and and in in the in the hour it's far spent but but I I do believe that you know brother brandom he actually makes a statement he said maybe there's a little one over in Seattle Washington and and he says and he says the church WIll slug right along he said because that last one has to accept it and so and so um I I I just may be that last one is here in Wyoming so praise the Lord where whatever that last one is we just want to be faithful to the charge that God has given us and ask him that he would just uh help us to say something that would be a help so that we could all uh leave this world today you know brother Bram said we'll leave these doors either one of two ways that there's you unfortunately you pass the point of no return When when you made the decision to setep foot in this house of God this morning whether conscious or unconscious there's only one of two ways that you're going to leave this building sir you're either going to leave closer to the Lord or farther away from him there is there is no there is no middle ground you you you done pass the point of no return and so I I trust that you'll make the right decision and you'll surrender to what God has for you and you'll leave this building closer to the Lord and farther away from this world so I I just want to speak uh out of the Book of Luke uh if we could um just a very uh simple thought um Luke 6 uh verse 36 and um uh the Lord Jesus speaking here um and um maybe maybe uh maybe if we could just uh uh take a time and go to the 27th verse Luke 6: 27 but I say unto you which he love your enemies do good to them which hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you and unto him that smiteth thee on the One Cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also give to every man man that askthe and of him that asketh uh uh ask and and of him that taketh away uh thy th thy Goods ask them not again and as ye would that men should do to you do also to them likewise for if you love them which love you what than have you for the Sinners also love those that love them if ye do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye for for Sinners also do even the same and if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive what thank have ye for Sinners also lend to Sinners and to receive as much again but love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful yes Jesus judge not yes and ye shall not be judged condemn not and ye shall not be condemned forgive and ye shall be forgiven and and I'd like to speak to you this morning morning by the help of the Lord on the release the release of forgiveness let's let's bow our heads heavenly father as we bow before you Lord and Humble Hearts Lord wanting Lord to be Children of the highest for you are high and lifted up Lord we just want to yield to you this morning and you've seen Lord the enemy that's tried to hinder right but you was faithful Lord and Lord and we're so thankful to be called by your great holy name and as we gather around your Eternal Word this morning please Lord bind bind my mouth Lord if I would say anything contrary to your word Lord you know that's my desire is to just to speak your word and your word alone but I am just a mere man but we want to look to you Lord and um I believe you've placed a gift in my life and Lord I want to use it this morning for your glory and just get out of the way that you could deal with your children's heart this morning Lord I I'll say whatever you want said Lord if it would just be a help Lord if I I will be a fool for you this morning Lord oh bless them Lord and I will count it thank you Jesus I will I will count it a privilege Lord to be a fool for you this morning so we yield to you and ask that you would have your way in this service and we ask these thingss to be so in the mighty all sufficient name of our Lord and savor Savior Jesus Christ amen God bless you you could be seated this morning the um the release of forgiveness and and so you know Jesus tells us that we were to forgive and if we would forgive then we would know that we are forgiven so if you sometimes I think we all do have a question in our heart Lord am I forgiven you know we want to make sure everything's under the blood yes sir we want to make sure everything's confessed and you know we talk a lot about what we got to confess but you know really it's pretty simple if you want to know that you're forgiven it's can you forgive right oh yes forgive and ye shall be forgiven and it it may seem like a simple subject but it's really so profound um because a lot of times in life um you know as as Christians we all come from different walks of life and we all maybe some of us generationally have brought up been brought up uh in this uh gospel way and maybe uh some here this morning has never stepped foot in a barroom and the only uh alcohol that's ever touched your lips is the communion wine and that may be a quite a testimony to have I I wished I had it you know I I I I came up uh a little bit uh uh on the other side of the tracks and so I got a lot of scars to prove where I've been unfortunately and that's all to my shame but God was faithful in it all but but we're not going to focus maybe so much on overcoming alcohol and drugs and that's that's all part of it but the thing that that we all as uh uh Christians having a Christian profession this morning we could be cleaned up living a good life and paying tithes and you know no no uh no filth of the world and maybe have a a home that looks very uh modest and Holiness and we could have the dresses the right length and all free flowing and no slits in the home and you know we can all be uh you know living that model of of of of modesty and an example of Holiness but if we but if we sit here and even myself in include stand here this morning with unforgiveness in our life we are in Jeopardy of Hell Fire um you know Jesus now and I'm not I want you to think a lot of times we as Christians we all know if we've been in any uh uh um any length of time been serving the Christian way you know we all know we have to forgive and and we can many times say well I forgive you but uh I want us to be honest with ourselves how many times and if we've all been in this any length of time a lot of times it was lip service well we might have said it but we didn't mean it from the heart and and you know Jesus Takes uh the parable of of the man that owed 10,000 talents and and the man forgave him but then he came across a man that owed him a 100 Pence and Jesus gives us such an extreme uh uh Dynamic of of value uh of those 10,000 talents if you would take those 10,000 talents and add them up today it would be into the billions of dollars that that man was forgiven and but then the extreme of it was is that when that man would have such a burden lifted off of his shoulders of being in debt eight over $86 billion in debt I didn't say Millions I said billions but for for for somebody to look at that man and said I forgive you but but then that man would come across the man that owed him $15 wow and when the man owed him $15 he wanted to all of a sudden uh uh uh you know grab him bought a collar and try to force him to pay and and Jesus Takes that that and as we see there in the 18th chapter he says this he said he says then his Lord after he had called him said unto him oh thy Wicked servant I forgave thee all that debt that because thou desirest me should us not there also that I have compassion on thy fellow servant even as I have pity on thee and his Lord was WTH with him and delivered him to the tormentors that he should pay all that was due unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts amen if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother's trespasses amen so it's more than just saying I'm sorry but it's actually meaning it and being sorry from the heart and I want to just help you remember you know sometimes God and life makes things so tight that there's no way we can do it humanly possible in our own selves yes because a lot of times things cut so deep that the only way that we can forgive from the heart is if the holy spirit is in the heart to give you that forgiveness to give to somebody else now brother now Jesus said forgive not everyone his brother but I want you to see what the Prophet The Prophet takes it a step closer he says if you've been indifferent if you had little sces and little things what difference does it make you're going to die one of these days what day maybe today you don't know an hour from now you may be in Hell or you may be in heaven right an hour for now many of many of 10 and 12 year old yeah will be in one of those two places true worldwide but many times we put it way off Yonder and we and we push it off and we push it off but one day we'll push it off for the last time and every one of us will one day have a last breath I want that last breath Amen to be filled with the Holy Spirit hallelujah hallelujah brother Ram said but you got to choose now if there's anything in your life that isn't right you choose Now by faith you say well if I can just get even with her if I can get even with him no matter what you've done choose life choose life for Jesus said if ye from your heart do not forgive every person their transgressions neither does your heavenly father forgive you so just get that close if there's one art right you know just that little funny feeling yeah you know just that brother that rubs you the wrong way that when you see him you run the other way wow no alcohol involved right ain't a pack of marbels yeah right I I you know when we when we got into Michigan and and all saw all the Billboards of the buds and marijas and right we even went through a town and it smell oh you can smell it in the vehicle right they they ain't they ain't a Philly blunt with your name on it this morning but if you got one art in your heart against any person then the prophet makes it so tight wow he says sinner or Saint y yeah you're in danger of Hellfire we all this morning and you know you think brother Gabe how well how you know I'm predestinated brother okay yeah I believe it yes but I'm elect of God God I believe it but you know only the predestined elected is going to be able to live this yes sir amen it this world is so dark and so black that that there's only going to be a faithful Little Flock right yes sir that really has surrendered amen not churchgoers not not just because we got the eagle belt Buckle right right not not because we got the pillar of fire hanging on the wall we need to have the pillar of fire on hanging on this wall right and and and and that takes real consecration to God Amen I and and so we we have to be honest this is why I say um I I I want you I hope that you you listen to what I'm bringing and weigh it in your heart right because we don't want to just think we got what we got if we don't have it right and and and we're not talking about well I listen there's no uh seniority no way right no way like like you know a lot of times we get on a job and we think well I'm not getting laid off I've got 25 years is here right I got seniority well seniority ain't going to get you there no seniority in God right I mean I mean that's good that we was faithful and and that's true to a degree but but I've seen youngsters that was more seasoned than somebody that's been in the 30 40 Years sir right so so it's how close we can get to the Cross of Christ I I don't want to just CRP by be barely in right and and so I I want you to think about this brother brandham tells us something I love so much brother Bram says as soon as you're sorry let me just what balance this out a little bit as soon as you're sorry you're already forgiven right this so beautiful as I was speaking to a brother yesterday kind of got a little mixed up on it said look brother if you said something to hurt your wife's feelings immediately you'd feel sorry for her you're sorry you did it you're already repented in your heart ain't that beautiful right how God makes it so perfect the moment we're sorry right before we get anything out right that's how God works because God is not worried about what what we say he's worried about what's in here and the moment we from our heart are sorry we're already forgiven he said that's right but you got to go tell her about it right woooo little humble pie the man of the house made a mistake yes sir oh my better a couple Brothers want to right you know you know here the thing a lot of times dad cuz he's the man of the house he thinks he ain't got to apologize when he does something wrong oh yeah I pay the bills listen friends you look if if you can't look in you can't look in your timeline and see where you repented to your children something's wrong yes sir brother you got some pride in your life you better be able to go back and go yeah man a couple days last week two weeks last month they got a little he good and dad had to go make that right Dad had to go apologize to them little ones yeah you know the thing of it is is we think well they're my kids no they ain't them God's children I ain't got no kids that's good God a give me no kids right that's a city boy too I love that huh that's City you know what I'm talking about right what a kid that's a baby goat God didn't give me no goats see the thing of it is a lot of time people say oh you know uh I got some Hooligans don't call them children Hooligans no if you want Hooligans call them Hooligans yeah yeah I I I see I see Mage Believers that they'll say oh you know they talk about them boys and they say they'll talk call them uh you know R rats and Hooligans and okay you are prophesying over them what they are my my my my children they I since I could hold them in my hand that they didn't have a choice they was bride of Christ they say how many people said how many kids you got I said I don't have any I got three children yeah that's right yeah you said old brother Gabe that don't okay all right it don't matter all right well call them goats if you want to oh no way I'm sorry I believe it's important how we refer to our children and when we look at them as God's children then we treat them differently you think about the fathers that's going to have to answer at the white throne for the way they acted not to the not to the pastor yeah but how they treated their little ones in their own home yeah or you may think nobody's watching but there's an angel a recording Angel that's following you around right amen that's not a grainy video but AK yes sir so when we think about forgiveness you know uh I've been I've been thinking about Calvary a lot and you know when we when we think about Calvary the Bible tells us that when the Lord God Almighty forgien us forgiving Us in Colossians it says and you being dead in your sins and uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all all amen all trespasses Jesus blotting out the handwriting of an ordinance against the what was against us which was contrary to us took it out of the way nailing it to his cross so the Lord Jesus when he died he died for your past sins right yeah thank you Lord your present sins thank you Jesus and your future sins Glory right he died for every aspect of your what what we did yesterday what we will do yet today that we need to repent for and the sins that we will do tomorrow if there is a tomorrow cuz we all come short of the glory of God and if we say we don't sin we make God a liar so we all sin but but if he forgive us of all our sins nailing it to his cross but then he would tell us if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me amen so if he already took our sins and now that to his his cross but then he commands us to follow him with our own cross so I want to ask you what does that cross entail you know what as I started thinking about it Paul tells us that we die daily right right right every day we die out to self but you know I I got to thinking about the cross that I thought I was to carry and for so many years I would lived a so self-centered life when it came to my cross and my cross alone cuz if you really think about it he carried all of our sins past future and present right right but then he tells us to take up our cross and follow him so it's not just taking up your cross but then it's following his exact blueprint and footstep yeah right so let's look at what he done on his road to Calvary right now he was Perfection of perfection the sinless one the Spotless one the man did nothing a miss his whole life right from the Cradle to the Grave spotless yeah so perfect even when he was a Youngster my my one of my old pastors when he was a little boy he asked his daddy one time he said Daddy did Jesus ever get a whooping and and what his dad told him I thought was so profound he looked at his son and he said honey even dads make mistakes right see Jesus suffered for things that he didn't do right wrong and this is what to my shame I realized that the cross that I was carrying was the wrong cross because it's when we do good and we suffer for it that's thankworthy it's when somebody wrongs you and you didn't do anything wrong and you suffer for it that's good the Bible tells us to suffer ourselves to be robbed that's what defrauded means and lady oia yeah Rich right increased with Goods yeah brother Carson do you realize how much overtime I work brother what listen brother when I leave here I'm driving 4 hours home and I'm getting up at 1:00 in the morning to go punch a clock right and I got to go put in 12 hours I worked hard right for my pay yes sir yes sir yes sir I got the what oh oh you ain't no no you ain't taking nothing from me oh I told you going to pinch told you going to pinch see Co cuz it's it's when we do right he well wait a minute hold hold fast but turn you ain't no take something from me hold F no we just read Jesus said if they take your cloak you're supposed to offer up so when a when when somebody step breaks into your house and takes your coat you're supposed to go sir sir hold on hold on sir sir no here here's see it's easy for us to give one to another that's right but even the Sinners do that right see and we can get our little click of message Believers and we we can do good to the household of faith and that's what we're supposed to do we're supposed to do good to those especially of the household of faith but what about what about that that that person at Walmart that's got the big skar tattooed on his neck that you know that's all sleeved out you know and you know when you get close to him he smells like he just got done firing up a joint yeah see you know you know no matter how thin you slice it you know a lot of times we look we want to sit in the seat of the scornful right you know especially especially if if it's a message believer that never did bit out in the Sin and out in the world and you know came from a mom and dad as mom and dad was good they don't know no divorce oh I heard about that must be pretty tough right then you can look down and you can see that person all sleeved out and tattooed up but but the problem of it is you got to enter into that person's suffering right amen amen oh I'm talking about I'm talking about the coworker that rubs you the wrong way matter of fact it's going to rub you the wrong way first thing tomorrow morning yeah because of this sermon that brother Gabe's preaching to you yes you going to be tried first thing in the morning brother Gabe was tried all night right hey woke up about four or five times I I move the bed I thought I wake up my wife looked up I looked at it was still 2:00 in the morning I thought oh man my baby's sick she ain't feeling good right uh oh my did everything that could go wrong went wrong get out to the car I even open up the trunk just fine get in there get everything loaded up I believe I believe oh my see that's okay yeah because you know it's easy for us to be message Believers when everything goes good right it's okay for I can stand up here be Preacher Man and you know right but but be Preacher Man when you go try to be spiritual on that one yeah yeah yeah right yeah so so the Bible tells us that we're supposed to love our enemies and we're supposed to bless them that yeah curse you when's the last time you blessed your coworker that curses you I'm talking about the coworker that when you see him across the hall or down the alleway from the machineries and you just see him in the corner cuz you you saw what he wore and cuz you mark him remember right yeah and and he had that red you wear that red shirt on so as soon as you see that red shirt you bail before he come am I preaching to anybody this morning and you go the other way amen so you wanted to avoid bless them that curse you and pray for them which what despitefully use you see that that's not so easy you know you know why it's not so easy because we as as Believers we as human beings we love Justice right and especially message Believers because Elijah represented God's justice right yeah and we can take that Elijah anointing and be just like James and John and the moment that they won't let our savior get anything to eat we want to call fire down out of heaven like Elijah did because we are under that eal anointing right and brother bam said on Mount Transfiguration when Jesus was transfigured Moses represented the law and Elijah represented Justice right and we from birth when somebody wrongs Us justice is to be served see we can take that aij your anointing and we can take our complexes and our wounds of life and we can justify our rage yes sir oh yeah yes sir you you you you you ever you ever see a message believer and and when brother Brandon's talking about that Roman Catholic church and that mother right brother you know you know what or brother man talking that domineering woman that right brother them women of them lady see sister you know what that is if that brother would be honest with himself he got hurt as a little boy by a domineering mother right or a domineering step mother yeah yes sir and because he was wounded as a little boy he can take that message and that is not the Holy Ghost that's a wounded little boy that's never dealt with that trauma in his childhood right true it's true it's true that's right you you know you know you know whenever I go to the unfortunately look I you know I I got well a matter of fact when I came across the border I didn't know if they was going to let me you know cuz I got a couple felonies right and so and so uh uh you know I've been locked up and so I I don't I don't really you know tattoos don't win fights no no no no no right I mean okay you you can have many skulls on your neck you want to but that don't and okay so you can take a needle getting I mean but that don't make you a man no no right like like so so so the person that barks the most is not the person I worry about so when you see somebody all muscle bound and sleeved out in tattoos you know what when I look at somebody like that you know what I see now not always but you know who I see I see a scared little boy yeah yeah yeah sir yes sir and that scared little boy got hurt as a little boy and so he said it'll never happen again sir that's sir right and so that's why he puts all this on his sleeve cuz he's trying to growl at you trying to show you how tough he is but really it's a scared little boy on the inside you get somebody look I'm not worried about somebody trying to pick bleed tough right I'm worried about the quiet one in the corner The Quiet One in the corner he knows who he is that's the one I'm looking at I'm not worried about the man over here y d amen okay see so so all that all that tough guy stuff don't mean nothing when you look at somebody you got to be able to look deeper and see that that that person that's that's trying to be tough is really just wounded right because no matter how perfect a home you come from you come to this world broken yes sir yes sir I don't care how good mom and dad if you you could be third generation message that don't make you could be seed of God elect of God you got a seed in your soul I get all that that's fine you still come to the world broken look you say no no brother Gabe I never heard that yell dad never raised his voice but what about great Grandad right because the iniquity goes into the third and fourth generation and what you're laboring under may not it be your fault nor your dad's fault right nor your great grand your granddad's fault but it was your great great granddaddy wow hello somebody that's scripture that's Bible right and so things go deeper in life and a lot of times we like to pick and choose and go and just blast somebody because the way that they are but you got to understand you go why is God letting that person get away with that you know why because God knows what that person is laboring under is not his fault it's not her fault the why the way that she is the way that she is is because of something Grandma did and she's laboring under that thing that is life and so that is why we have to handle not just us as Believers we have to handle everybody really differently yes because the you know we as message Believers we love that artificial discernment good and I know I look I you you preaching back brother BR said you can be in there you 30 seconds and two minutes and you can tell whether they got the holy ghost or not I I I believe that as long as that's not your complex showing through amen do do you know do you do you know do you know we as human beings psychology you could have had trauma when you was a 8-year-old boy yeah and you know the person that was that hurt you as an 8-year-old boy he looks like me and because he looks like me he's got he's got he's got deep set eyes he's got big ears right and you know he he got a Furrow just like me and he had a loud voice and I ain't did n thing to you yeah but because I resemble the person that traumatized you you automatically you got a funny feeling about brother gab and now now you want to use that quote to justify now of a sudden you spiritual and you look look I'm not dis discrediting what brother Benham said but what I'm trying to show you is you got to be careful because you can deceive yourself you caning believe a lie you have to try that Spirit now God May and please I'm not trying to discredit S especially you sisters funny little feelings you in the parking lot Walmart parking lot some of a little creepo I'm not don't please don't use what brother Gabe said and then you know you understand what I'm saying but what I'm trying to say is a lot of times we as mess Believers we always try to walk with oh spiritual I got the anointing you you know message me and listen brother Brandon was the most spiritual person I've ever seen in my life outside of Jesus Christ he never walked around like that he never walked around you know in this uh oh you know he didn't do he do you he spent most of his life in another world right Supernatural world but he but but but when you see message people and they always got to be everything's spiritual right you and then they want you to be Spirit then they try to get you to buy in Brother G you know brother brother you know this brother and I need you to do see because God then all of a sudden they you're like what right so if it was spiritual God's got to work on my I'm not denying that but let me pray about it maybe I'm being Carn but let me get in that you know right so so you got to be honest you got wait and go wait a minute Lord don't let me just because a lot of times we love to pick and choose who's you know who's bride and who's not cuz but I got the Holy Ghost you know and and hey not not that you don't have Holy Ghost discernment but what I'm saying is you have to have being tuned enough with God to where you're not just using your past traumas to pick and choose who is bride and who's not you understand what I'm saying that's where you had to you had to be honest enough with yourself and pray over these things because you listen if it's always Justice you you you okay it's justice but I don't know about you see we can have we want Justice for us but really it needs to be Grace it needs to be loved right amen because when when John when John was there John could identify with Christ right cuz John was the reflection of love we don't want God's justice no oh my wow there's no way we would be able to make it in God's justice we want God's grace and love is that right I'm already at 50 minutes you're good oh my you're fine no brother how you so you know think about that when we're talking about forgiveness see brother brandham tells us he says can you go the Second Mile can you turn the cheek the other side that's the way to test Christianity see how far you can go in love fellowship and Brotherhood that's the way you test Christianity amen see you know when Jesus when the disciples come to Jesus and ask for him to teach him the prayer to pray Jesus tells them in in one fast and it's a beautiful you can preach a whole message just on Jesus's prayer because Jesus gives you the principles of prayer first he says after this man therefore you pray Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name what Jesus is telling us is when you go to prayer you little ones yes you don't just say uh Jesus bless mommy bless daddy and you know and I want to I want to that Jesus please can I get a quad right right please Lord put it on Daddy's heart to buy me a quad please okay no no that's not how you start off cuz you know what you're doing you giving God Almighty a honeydew list yes and you too young for a honeydew list right you know what a honeydew list is yeah look you look at that like yeah I know mom don't mom got to yeah all right she probably ties you into the honeydew list right but so so when we talk about so what God is what Jesus is telling us when he says Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name brother Benham takes that and he says first you give him a little worship worship yeah there you go yeah so when we go in prayer what we first want to do is we want to we want to woo him a little bit right right you sisters when you want when you want when you want hubby to do something oh baby oh yeah right you got to you work so hard today right ain't that right sis you giving a little worship right see right you you you you you want to you want to speak his right love language right right right you need to know we need to right how many know heard they talking about the the five love languages right I'm not but right so right because everybody's different so you need to know how your man ticks right you said oh baby you've been working hard look your mother oh right right so yeah you gotta be trying to put it on him see cuz you because you want him you want you're trying to get something out of him right and that's the way the Lord is he said our father art in heaven right Hallowed be thy name the almighty yeah amen amen and the all sufficient one give him a little worship thy kingdom come thy will be done as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts right there you go ooh ooh wow o forgive us our debts and we like putting a big old message period on the end of that as we forgive our debtors now look at what these debtors is one who has not yet made amends to whom he has injured you owe me apology brother brother Dale you are a pastor you are a minister of the Gospel he owes me now now now let's see it's my unbelieving family oh well we got to have Grace and we oh so now of a sudden you respect our persons that pinch you a little bit I told you going to pinch you a little bit right right because he's all no he's the he's the head of the church oh so now ministers always had to go make things right oh you got a quote for that there is that the V version right so cuz you know what it is and if you would be honest with yourself you don't want you don't want them to repent what you want them to do you want them to fall down before you you don't care a lick about their soul getting right before God you want Justice right right yeah yeah wow oh Hallelujah am hey I I I'll say amen and raise my hand I don't been there oh yeah I don't been there I I had to I listen I had to be honest with myself I'm we all done set a SE of the scor F so so when we want that's what we're wanting we want in justice but is that let me ask you when Christ remember he said take up your cross when Christ resurrected from the grave show me where he went back and found the Roman soldier that pierced him in his side show show me show me where he went and found the guy that had the cat of nine tails that beat him well they they they don't know how many times they beat him because the Jewish law was 40 stripes yeah but Roman law they there was no limit yeah right the Bible says his Bon stared at him the Bible said that his vicing was marred more than any other man he looked like a monster yes amen amen for me so so when when he took that punishment who did he go to did he go say you owe me I told you I was the son of God no no no he said father forgive him am they don't know what you're doing right am now now thank you Lord you you take up your cross see this is the cross that I was missing it's the cross when we are innocent right yeah yeah yeah yeah it's when we've done nothing wrong right there you go and we are innocent cuz he said follow me take up your cross and follow me so the cross that we're talking is not you dying out to your own individual sins that's not what we're talking about we're not talking about oh God forgive me for this cuz he already carried your sins I'm not talking that we don't repent but what I'm saying when he's to me me Calvary has taken a new uh facet to me because it's when we suffer and we've done nothing wrong and we are innocent and we deserve justice but we don't take justice we give them love and grace and mercy that's when we are facing heaven that's the cross see you say brother Gabe how do you do that you don't know what I've been through I know you don't I know I don't know what you've been through listen as many people as here there is so much trauma in here if if we could if we could you know uh uh pull back all of our childhood you know we would see we would see things that was absolutely atrocious right right I I look I when I was a little boy my parents was divorced when when I when I should have been shelter Ed and protected I was I was uh I was the first first drink alcohol I ever had was like first to second grade right by a man that should have protected me right right I'm drinking Captain Morgan and Coke watching Friday Night Fights right with my stepdad right before the age of accountability pornography within Arms Reach my whole childhood life life right till I was a grown man so you say that's not fair I know it's not fair no it's not fair no I look at these young people and they're innocent and they don't have no scars and I think I think God why that's not right why did I have to do why why Lord why just like some of you have got the same kind of trauma in your life and you think why in the world Lord did that have to happen to me why me it's not fair life isn't fair that's right right life's not fair no but he still was gracious enough Mercy Amen to give you ears to hear the gospel amen thank you Lord amen amen to give you a to receive yes praise God thank you Lord Jesus amen see a lot of times when you when you when you when you look at the the the Good Samaritan and the man that that had got wounded when you look at that that word wounds it means the word that we're all familiar with the trauma but I want you to see that it's actually made up of three Greek words and those three Greek words shows the complexity of trauma because it also it trauma is the three words means to break in pieces shatter Smite A Worn Path and to Nash or to grind one's teeth which I think it's so fitting that God would have this Greek word have so many facets right yes because trauma is multi-layered right when we have trauma in our lives sometimes what you're dealing with you ever have somebody brother sister person at work and you just say something little wrong to them and they just blow up on you and you're like what in the world just happened you know what it was it wasn't what you did no no it's what you touched yes when they were 8 years old it was the fact that they were picked on as a little itty bitty boy or a little itty bitty girl or maybe they had a mom and all you did is say something and the way that you looked that just that little they call it micro Expressions that micro expression that you did and the word that you said triggered something in them yes sir yes sir yes sir it's true amen see you you can look at this little itty bitty boy right there and all you see is a smile right a lot I a pretty pretty cute little kid I know I know but see what you fail to see is the pain behind that smile amen what you fail to see is all the trauma in that little boy's life amen see it was all that trauma in that little boy's life that was sent him down a path that he really didn't want to go right right and you know sometimes we can look at people's life and we can judge people yes sir and we can think we think what's the big deal Shake It Off and you know when you say shake it off you ought to be ashamed of yourself yes sir cuz what may be trauma to them may not be trauma to you this is what I love about the prophet watch what brother brandham says and and he's and he's Discerning this man's life and he's tell him he has inward troubles and he says you could read all of it but just for time's sake he said when you was a child a little boy with knee pants on you've got problems with something he says I believe it's a dog that chased you or something isn't that right a big dog and you run to a porch is that right and I see it as a little boy is that uh the truth sir all right who would know that but God alone isn't that but right yeah now we would look at that and go brother dad was just a dog yeah come on brother right it was a little boy get over it yes but that's not what the angel of the Lord said now you think about this man's life the angel of the Lord is there and he could go through any aspect of that boy's life that man's life and he could identify and if we had the same insight and could look through that we'd say no no it was right here when he was 20 years old or no it's when he was 18 and he had this this is way more traumatic than that but that's not what the angel of the Lord called out the angel of the Lord went to the heart of the problem right see where we would say shake it off get over it right yes sir see how we do one another amen good see this is what I love about the messag right here right sir because it gives us Insight because we are all look what what if this what if this man 6'4 and you know yeah got a flannel on and you know got an ax in the back of the truck and right came to the church with with boots on you know steel toes and right what what did he look like and we' look at him and go what but see how we do yeah it's so easy for us to misjudge a situation and you don't really understand why that person ticks the way that they tick and it may be something as simple as that I I I'll show you another one watch this brother bandam when he's getting ready change from his first pool to his second this sister he says there back there he said I seen a young lady about 16 years old and she was just running this as hard as she could she had a big ribbon tied to her hair a double plat hanging back she had a chucker dress on and she was running real fast I looked there was a a big yellow dog chasing her and she said I see a young lady with a checker dress begin to tell uh what I was seeing looking in front of me this is the first time brother brandom discerns the heart right here if if this sounds familiar to you he says she goes up on the porch I see the lady take her in and she starts screaming she said and then this girl and when when she's doing it she goes that was me when I was in school she said this is what I want you to see I never thought of it before in my life so this girl has this trauma that's so suppressed she never she forgot about it and never thought about it but when the angel of the Lord discerned her so that tell tells us we can have traumatic things in our life that are so suppressed so suppressed that that because we were hurt by a preacher we'll hold that man accountable and it's his fault and then brother Dale will will say something a certain way and then you'll you'll all a sudden see he's as inocent as the day is long listen friends we are a mess as human beings and there is there is no hope for us outside of surrendering Our Lives to the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit stepping in and giving us true Holy Ghost discernment not to discern one another I'm not worried about you I want the Holy Ghost to discern my life because I'm worried about that something that I never thought before in my life but because it is so buried yes sir so buried I want that angel of the Lord to come by my way maybe through my wife and say something or maybe through brother Dale when we're talking after service or brother Carson or whoever it may be maybe my pastor Wednesday I don't care who it is just let the Holy Spirit discern my life in such a way to I can realize I never thought about that before in my life and it just unlocks something to me and then I realized oh that's why I am the way that I am look you know you know I would encourage you um I would encourage you after this service at some point in time to sit down some of you got so much trauma you would never counsel with your pastor because you got so much pride you know because we in this message we have a complex of following our a man we have a complex in this message of being a manf and because we have that and then us Brothers can become independent because we have the message we don't need him oh he can preach to us on Sundays and Wednesdays but I got it covered I'm the high priest I'm the high priest of my home woo see how we use quotes see how we use it we use all that to cover everything but really in reality we just don't want to share because we don't want to be embarrassed we got Pride what it is but we try to justify ourselves I know what I'm talking about right so we'll hide those things we we got so much pride but we got to be able to Humble ourselves look when when when when we if we ain't careful we can let these things become so because of that complex that's in this message we we we become so uh on defense that we won't go to our past remember when he when God ascended up on high he gave gifts under man and that man right there is a gift to you you say oh no he's my dad he's still a gift to you you're looking at him wrong yeah you're looking at it wrong you you think oh no brother Gabe I look he listen the thing of it is is you got to realize you got to have enough confidence look I had I'll say this my wife and I was having some problems at home right and uh uh and and I and I and I you know I tried to F you we Brothers we're all fixers right how many fixures we got brother how many YouTube certified Brothers do we have here huh if we if we hey we youtubing if we can't figure it out right we'll YouTube that thing give me four or five videos I'm YouTube certified right some of you sisters is YouTube certified too right now ain't preaching it against that I'm just saying but the problem of it is you know I had to come to wife I said listen babe I said look let's go talk to pastor and you know she's like no I said listen cuz she knows how I am right I'd be trying to tell brother Pastor how to do it before I said listen baby I said I won't say nothing she said okay so so I called Pastor up he said yeah come on brother and you know as and I'm going to show you something here in a minute but but the thing of it is is I had to I had to humble myself preacher or no preacher look you could have you you Brothers could have be in this message longer than brother Dale that does not give you senority over him CU he's he's the angel to this church that's what that's what brother Brenham called him brother Brenham said is the pastor is the Angel to the church but but the thing of it is is we have to receive it as such and and thing of it is is is when I when when wifey and I went to when wifey and I went to our pastor and and Pastor you know what as he started talking to us he pulled out a little pen in a piece of paper I'm going to show you what he drew to me to us but the thing of it is is he didn't he didn't show us five steps to a better marriage he didn't pull out Dr dos but that be see because I told my wife I said listen babe we are not going to Chad L right right now you say brother gab there's so many people following men I know I know there is and there's so many pastors taking advantage of it yeah and you was one of them that's why you're defensive but just because people abuse the office does not take away God's word you have to find a pastor that you can submit to that he understands his position that's ke and he knows that he's going to be accountable he's going to handle it reverently with a Godly fear right see that's how God designed it and so we have to realize that Pastor the prophet is just not the the end all be all right that's right am true it's true yes but then the thing of it is is then we get we get caught up and and and we got four or five of our favorite pastors that's a problem too and we have so many voices well brother so and so preaches and brother Dell Don't Preach brother so L stop you got way too many voices you're p p too many dread directions right that's why I say lady oia is the most complex age of trauma cuz things are coming from so many ways that's why I say listen what I did and what I encourage you to do if you don't take anything from this take this from me what I want I hope that you do is you need to set across yourself and counsel yourself because was what's your name young man Elliott all right so me and my buddy Elliott if Elliott comes to me after service he said brother Gabe I'm like yeah what's up what's going on brother he said brother Gabe I got this and uh you know and he he starts telling me when when Elliott tells me what he's going through I'm going to look at that boy and I'm going to do everything I can to find Grace to help in his time of need but the but the what I realized is I would have all kinds of Grace for everybody else but I held only myself to a different standard because of the trauma in my life see I had to counsel myself as a eight-year-old boy that's taking drinks of alcohol in the first and second grade that set me on a road P wrong path that that before I was at the age of accountability I would had pornography within Arm's Reach my whole life but see I was holding myself to this message standard but what I did is I set across that eight-year-old little boy that I showed you earlier I set across him and you know what brother Dale when I started talking to him I looked at him in a different way right amen cuz I realized look Gabe it wasn't your fault buddy yeah it wasn't your fault brother Carson the hardest person to forgive is yourself yeah because we can we can have all kind of Grace for our favorite people right our favorite people in the church when we we have all but when we look at ourselves we can look at ourselves with such criticism but you have to set AC that's why I say and when I set across from myself and I looked at myself honestly something unlocked in me yes amen amen see when when when you set across yourself yeah you have to set across yourself you say brother Gabe I don't want to relieve the pain nobody does nobody wants to relive it right some of the trauma we've had we've stuffed it just like that girl we put it I I never even thought about that because it's so suppressed but the thing of it is friends if you never deal with it if you never deal with that trauma you you will eventually deal with that trauma through your children cuz you will pass it on to the next Generation true if you never deal with the pain unconsciously you will pass it on to them that's why generationally we see it go from generation to generation and we see that family and they all act alike see we can all come to church friends but if we come to church and there's no change I I I didn't come here just to wow you with with my imagery of a power point I I didn't I I could care less I I I I just know that I can't I I want to live I want to give every aspect to try to show you every facet so that something can unlock in you that's what I want that's what I want to happen that you really go in those dark places in your life and ask yourself God why do I tick the way that I tick why am I Lord so defensive because if you're somebody that's so defensive and you're really defensive what you have is you have trauma in your past you've never dealt with and so you've got all these mechanisms where you're trying to protect yourself all the time it's true I mean it just it it it it's just the way that it is but you know the the thing of it is brother Brandon preached doors and doors I'm not going to look at the time is that okay is that okay everybody okay yeah brother Brandon preached doors and doors right and so and so the thing of it is is he talks about letting them in the door of your heart and he just stand you can let God in just enough and let him stand at the threshold but you have to go through all these corridors I'm not I'm talking about the one way at the end of the hall that nobody goes to there's where you need to go because this is this is what happened this is what my pastor showed me my pastor drew a little box I put a heart there and he sat us down and he drew a little stick figure and he put a line going to that box and he says things happened in our past and you know what we get hurt we get hurt think you know if if Satan you know why Try Satan tries so hard to injure little ones whenever they're 8 nine 10 years old cuz if he can if he can break them when they're young he'll probably have a good chance of having them the rest of their life that's right that's why it's so important for us to shelter our children I'm not talking about smothering them but I'm talking about being watchful right I I told I told I told my children while back uh I was was talking about sleepovers I said listen I said I said you know what when you get older and the only counseling you have to have with brother Chad is that you never got to go have a sleepover praise the Lord praise the Lord hey that's fine okay brother Chad counsel all you want do brother that's right yeah right yes sir cuz there's so many horror stories brother listen listen them three little ones ain't been away from my wife but but a few hours their whole lives right unless unless there was a room full of just sisters and girls and yeah no testosterone in the home man I hope you understand what I'm saying right listen CU I tell you what brother one thing for certain I know you know I know the pain that happened in my childhood and I am certainly not going to pass it on to my my next Generation ain't no way no sir so so problems happen wounds happen we get hurt right and the problem of it is the Bible says this the spirit of man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded Spirit who can bear and so when we go through life brother bandham told us we have bod spirit and and soul and and so in that Spirit realm he said conscience memory reason imagination and affection right so we can get wounded in our spirit we can get wounded in our affection let a let a brother you ever hug a brother it's like hugging a wall yeah if that brother would be honest and he Chase it back you know what happened he probably didn't have a daddy that loved him you didn't have a daddy that hugged him and a daddy that was affectionate my daddy when I was little my daddy would sleep back to back when I was little I go to his house on the weekends I love that man right but I'll tell you this when when I was little Mama never did I ever remember my mom loving me and hugging me and kissing me it was only my daddy it wasn't until I was like Teenage that she started and when she did it was like yeah right right but but see I had to go back I had to look why why do I resist her as a grown man I don't but I but I had to go back and I had to oh but Dad Dad me and him right I mean yeah right closest 19 is to 20 yeah but but but so so but because of that and brother bam tells us that that if you don't show him love somebody they will yes sir am so them little ones them them three they ain't too little they you know hey brother look they daddy always poured on that love yes sir hey they know they you know I tell you something else you ask them now they know Daddy will die for me yes sir amen that's good preach I told them when they was little listen cuz you know somebody say I'll kill your daddy you know what they look at him daddy will die for me yeah yeah yeah yeah no rep yeah yeah that you say oh they they know that do they have you ever told them yeah you think they're just supposed to know that yeah I wanted my children to know yes daddy will die for you and you know the thing of it is is it gives them a confidence cuz they know oh see they they it grain something in them and it puts something deep down in their subconscious that they know since a birth they know Daddy will die for me it wasn't just once or twice because children need that's what I needed as a little boy I needed that Assurance I needed that safety I needed that protection that whenever I would go to sleep and have a nightmare I didn't have some somebody that I could hug I got pushed away even now there's six 16 and I tell them I told him last night listen if come get me if you need me you know why cuz I always wanted somebody to tell me that when I was a little boy right see you can break the cycle you say oh I had a bad life so did I brother Gabriel had a listen afterwards we'll meet outside and we can compare who had the worst life yeah let put it on me let's go but but but what does that matter what does that matter we had a rough life we got a great Gody God but the thing of it is do we want to be healed you ever notied some people don't want to be healed they like being hurt you ever you ever meet somebody when your sick they're sick you can't nobody one person be sick somebody sick then this person got to be sick that person loves to be injured right they want to be wounded all the [Music] time and it's the same way in the house of God people want yeah to be hurt they don't want to be healed or they never tell you right but there is a b and Gilead don't tell me there ain't I know what I've been through this this gospel is more than just quotes on a page these are the unfailing realities of a living God the truth amen this message is real yes amen this ain't just you know some some some man that passed away in the 60s and we're following this man in these you know ego belt Buck teachings come on friends yeah this is this is life we're talking about somebody just like Moses what would you do if you had a TW 1,200 Scrolls of Moses word for word for btim rightow the Bible tells us oh Jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved how long shall vain thoughts Lodge within thee how long in your memory that Spirit realm conscience memory reasoning reasoning every time somebody does something your reasoning was wounded and because your reasoning was wounded every time you you are just so you got to look in the mirror and you got to counsel that little girl yeah Brothers you got to counsel that little boy see cuz in life I know this is kind of childish but trauma happens yeah at all stages of Life yes sir yes sir and sometimes it's compounded right wound after wound after wound after wound and if we ain't careful we create a filter yes sir right right that was made for coffee but that's a man-made filter and that's exactly what we create and when we get wounded everything in life goes through that filter and that's why we see everything wrong every and right that mother Harlot church and these denominational people and then we get then we get a conspiracy theory Spirit on us and we spend more time on X and uh you know whatever than the gospel yeah and it's just feeding all of those complexes yeah the well brother listen we know listen to the message we know that that there's a conspiracy we know we know it's the Catholic church but brother gavee the post getting ready to die yeah I I just want to die today I don't not really too much worried about him the man I'm worried about dying I'm worried about this man dying today you know I I'm sorry I I'm not worri I'm not worried about the next Pope right right but if but but if you're feed those conspiracies and that I'm not going to be here when that Antichrist right so so the thing of it is but we have to be mindful it's what is our filter see because we know it's got to be a thinking man's filter and if and if if somebody could be pouring into the oil and the wine right but is it really going to get to you if it's going through that filter right right see it has brother BR said a thinking man's filter and I'm I'm I'm trying to bring it to a close but but here's here's the thing what happens is and and I know maybe some of you like oh man please brother Gabe that guy's wearing me out that guy I you know what I hope he is you know I wanted you know when I was building this I thought man he is annoying [Music] me and you know what I hope he's annoying you you know why because of the unforgiveness that we've left in our heart way longer than what this little stick figure has been on the screen he's only been on this screen a few 20 minutes 10 minutes whatever but some of us have been packing things for years years and instead of dealing with it we build walls yes sir yeah amen but here's what I want to bring you to is remember whatever trauma you had in life if you have unforgiveness that person could have moved away passed away they could be six feet deep but do you know that you're chained to them if you have not forgiven them but this is what our pastor did for us he did this he said see cuz when wifey and I was having problems we realized he told us he said there's nothing wrong with you two right you know where the problem was there was a 8-year-old little boy and there was a 8-year-old little girl and those were the two that had the problems and so when you forgive somebody when you forgive you are actually breaking that chain and you are re what am I preaching on the release of forgiveness when you forgive it releases you now watch remember remember wait a minute brother gab justice has to be served and that's exactly right but watch when Jesus died he died for my sins so he was the innocent one Justice had to be served and so he paid the price so he paid the price he said put it on my account yes God he didn't ask nobody to you look no strings attached brother Carson you don't owe me nothing I frankly forgive you is what Jesus did he said father forgive them right don't let it be laid to their charge watch so so what what are we supposed to do see this is true Christianity when we release them yes and we say I'm forgiving I don't have to go back and find them I don't have to track them I don't have to Facebook stalk them to find out where they are it has nothing to do with them it has everything to do with God and you and so what you do is you frankly forgive them and what you do this is what's so beautiful if you want we say we want to be like Jesus Oh to be like oh yeah oh no we got to be like Jesus so what do we do see this is true forgiveness not you have to fall before me not Justice they they owe me an apology because they're a preacher right true no no no no true forgiveness is you're saying I forgive them and and they owe me a debt but I'm going to pay the price put it on my account and that what Stephen said Lord let it not be laid to their charge right Lord I will pay the price what they've done to me they deserve punishment amen they are guilty as the day is long but you know what I'm going to release I'm going to release my barabus praise God Amen somebody has to go free and what we do is we say let them go free you say brother Gabe whoa whoa whoa whoa I don't know about that well that that's okay for the easy things brother Gabe but there's some really really bad things and and and I want I want you to understand I am not discre riting anything any trauma that's happened in your life because sometimes things happen that are so deep it takes a long time to get over it's not going to happen in just one setting right but don't tell me that there can't be healing you you you know you know oh man we got Jesus see don't make your situation different right I know I'm going long but please just please just please just bear with me please I know I'm sorry the little ones they they but but I just want you to understand I know it's not easy I know if it was everyone would do it you say brother Gabe how do I get over how do I how do I actually forgive from my heart cuz brother Gabe I've said it but there's still something there and I've said it over and over and over and I can't get rid of it it takes time yeah brother bandom tells us this he says if I have found Grace in your sight through God you take my word for this you take my word for this Brethren if you want to get a bless want a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and has absolutely justly mean he's done you wrong and you know he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that you take him to prayer before God and don't take it in the way of just a sinful I'm supposed to do this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of God father where we prayer should be in the presence of God say father he's my brother and he's justly he deserve punishment because he done me evil I don't know see why I did it and then let God go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what that's man been through the devil has Twisted him up somewhere caused him and do that though he's absolutely wrong here's the key we have to go to the throne of God and he says before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that man yes sir you'll be sympathizing with that brother and when you get back down to Earth again you'll go over to that brother shake his hand cuz you know what he's been through you can stand you can't stand it with the Mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe no sir not if he's even a rank sinner what about a brother that's made a mistake though he's done wrong sometimes accus when he when he's when he's not wrong but if he but if he's wrong well if we'll take him to the throne of God and stand there shoulder to- shoulder with our brother knowing he's IM mortal and maybe his destination rest upon our attitude towards him when we come back from the Throne of God we'll realize that we're everyone guilty and we'll all need help one with the other and the best way to do is pray so how brother this is this is Brother bram's formula this is the formula for True forgiveness cuz things happen in life that we can't handle on our own but if we can get serious enough amen amen and get into the presence of God there's the key first give him a little worship amen yeah Hallelujah right thank you Lord Jesus and when we get into that presence listen this quote is a reality to me because I I I know the pain that I've had had in my life but I know the healing that's come from it and and when you when you take whatever that person is that's done you wrong and you in the sincerity of your heart go in your prayer closet and put your arm you said I don't want to put put your arm around them anyways yeah right and put your arm around them in your prayer closet you alone and you say God this person has hurt me and when you pray with that sincerity God I'm telling you I I I I stand as a witness God will show you things about that person of why they tick the way that they tick cuz you know when I come back from the presence of God I realized wait a minute my stepdad's dad was an alcoholic right see then it goes beyond Jim Naylor it it goes to the enemy that's got them all twisted up through the lineage and then we don't look at flesh and blood and we realize that it's a whole different Dynamic right that it's the devil right and you know what you will come back from the Throne of God feeling sorry for that person and you know what you cannot do that in your own ability that's why we need God that's what that's the unfailing realities of God that he can step in and bring healing in our lives and some of the deepest wounds that man cannot touch that listen Pastor can't touch Pastor can enter into a channel and he can unlock something and get you to see it but then you have to step in you have to go say yes Lord I am wrong Lord I am standing in the need of prayer I am the one Lord it is me you know if if if we don't if if we don't look we all have to come to this spot cuz we all want forgiveness but can we forgive can you from the sincerity of your heart some of the deepest wounds your darkest of darks things you haven't thought about for years maybe maybe come back to the surface as we can maybe have the musicians come you know if if there's something that strikes you and you say Lord you know it's not easy to say well I've been a Christian 20 years I've been this 30 years and then you go back to 1975 and you go [Music] ooh oh yeah I forgot or that person that person that that person that hurt you and every time you see him or maybe you avoid that family function right maybe maybe it's a sibling family member friend whatever hurt listen we all got them and unfortunately to varying degrees but I believe that we we have a God that heals every one of our diseases even the sin sick disease if we can just get quiet enough get still enough it says you play something soft maybe listen can you take a minute you say brother gab you going long listen what if today is our last day true what if what if could be you know I mean who knows what Trump's going to say today right but what what if today is the day do do you really want to kick the can down the road and roll the dice and hope you get another day or do you want to sit ACR crossed you say I I do may maybe if we could stand and bow our heads could we could we take a minute yes amen could we could we take a minute look seven seven seals seven Thunders and we can all have all the knowledge and we can have all the quotes and have all the scriptures lined out and all those things that's all fine and dandy but if you got unbelief in your heart what good is it doing you what good is it doing you if if if we're cold and indifferent and struggling what what good is our is our understanding of this message if we if we sit here or stand this morning with unforgiveness in our heart could we could we bow our heads and close our eyes and counsel with our little adolescent self every head bowed every eye closed could you just let's just take a moment and if there's something in your heart if there's something in your mind let let today be the day that healing becomes complete don't don't leave your seat with that unforgiveness still in your heart I I don't think the Lord would put this on my heart if there ain't at least one here that's battling with it maybe more but I ask you is there something that needs to come to that Throne can you let go of it this morning brother and sister could you could you maybe just talk it over with the Lord and say Lord I've carried this long enough [Music] we'd be happy to pray with you you want to come to the alt whatever you feel would take for you to have that freedom but listen don't worry about who's looking or who's watching or who may see you may not have tomorrow don't let Pride keep you in your seat don't don't let worrying about what what somebody's going to think or but if there's something that's coming up God's it's not brother Gabe that's bringing it up that's the Holy Spirit bringing it up in your heart so that you can get rid of it this morning could you let it go will you let it go can you be the one that's on that cross this morning and could you let that barabus go thank you Jesus Heavenly Father Lord you see the needs of the people this morning and I I pray in Jesus name that you would be there helper Lord that they would have grace and mercy in their heart enough to draw that line and let that thing go that's held him for so long Lord that they would Brick by Brick Tear Down the Walls that your great Holy Spirit would begin to minister to their needs Lord I just a man but you are the god in which we serve and I pray that your voice would go beyond mine and touch their hearts Lord that they would be able to leave this hollowed Sanctuary with a lighter load the burden of life would be lifted and that your great Holy Spirit would take its place of that burden that they've carried God you see the needs represented here I just pray in jesus' name that you would soften hearts Lord help them to surrender and yield to you that you would be able to minister to their hearts Lord that they would be able to let whatever is holding them that they would release Lord that they would let it go that they would see that it's not that thing holding them but it's them that's holding that thing I pray in Jesus name that you would be their portion commit them into your your hands and ask these things to be so in the all sufficient name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen be again [Music] with de th will the our oh [Music] will de CL and with the I need [Music] be [Music] th make [Music] me thank you Lord Jesus thank you Jesus thany thank you [Music] Lord
