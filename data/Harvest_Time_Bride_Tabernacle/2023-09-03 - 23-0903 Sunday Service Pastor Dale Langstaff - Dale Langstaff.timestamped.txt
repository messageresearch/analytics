[27:37] years before I was born
[27:40] it took me the whole convention to get
[27:43] over that
[27:45] he started preaching this truth
[27:47] two years before I came to the Earth
[27:51] I thought I was getting to be an old man
[27:54] wow

[27:59] tell you if you do listen to this
[28:01] message it's good until the last drop
[28:04] it's a long message
[28:06] but he said some things in the last
[28:08] paragraph some of the last things he
[28:10] spoke
[28:12] for
[28:14] powerful amen and it's a spirit of
[28:17] Christ it's it's going home time it's
[28:19] not about brother Dale it's not about
[28:21] Pastor Faye it's not about our Prophet

[28:30] it's about Christ
[28:31] amen it's god Jehovah God now we know
[28:34] that Jesus Christ was Jehovah God a

[28:49] sorry you could stand with me
[28:51] Revelations 1 1 the revelation of Jesus
[28:54] Christ that which God gave up to him to
[28:57] show to his servants which must shortly
[28:59] come to pass and he sent it and
[29:02] signified it
[29:04] by these angels to the servant John
[29:07] let's turn over to Colossians 1
[29:11] . amen just pray for me I
[29:14] was had all my notes but they were very
[29:17] scrambled
[29:18] amen I don't want to re-preach last
[29:20] Sunday and I'm trying to just go from
[29:22] there on and man first Colossians 1 26
[29:25] and 27 even the mystery which has been
[29:28] hid from the age from ages and from
[29:31] Generations that's what we want to talk
[29:33] about
[29:35] but is now made manifested to you
[29:40] to whom God would make known what is the
[29:44] richest of the glory of this mystery oh
[29:48] he's getting more personal
[29:50] among the Gentiles
[29:53] which Christ
[29:55] in you
[29:59] oh buddy somebody showed the hope of
[30:02] glory
[30:03] Hallelujah Lord Jesus we pray that
[30:06] you'll bless your word and and Lord
[30:08] bless your bride and just may you just
[30:10] complete and complete and total control
[30:13] Lord Jesus and we just worship and bathe
[30:17] in your presence and we give you the
[30:18] glory for it and your name we pray amen
[30:22] you may have your seat amen and we just
[30:26] uh you know you know we you know and I'm
[30:29] just uh like I said if you listen to
[30:31] brother face you might hear this voice
[30:33] you know you know when you go into a
[30:36] marriage normally at least here in North
[30:38] America uh you know I'm not saying it's
[30:41] like this around the world but lots of
[30:42] times somebody will be buying things for
[30:45] you
[30:46] and most of the time in a marriage in
[30:49] our in our area and much of the world
[30:51] half the world at least normally the dad
[30:53] of the Bride
[30:56] will pay or help pay
[30:58] for the wedding
[31:01] but you still have to be willing to be
[31:03] in the wedding
[31:06] Christ paid for everything for you
[31:10] everything
[31:12] but you still have to get dressed
[31:14] he can buy your wedding gown
[31:18] but you have to wear it
[31:20] amen and you know brother Faith said
[31:22] something that was just it he said many
[31:25] things but it really shook me he said
[31:27] you know in Europe and here we do the
[31:30] same thing you know at a wedding we'll
[31:31] put you know just married and we'll put
[31:33] rhythms on it and maybe soap the windows
[31:36] or do something ridiculous and then
[31:38] everybody Behind The wedding will go and
[31:40] toot their horns
[31:42] and signify there's just been a marriage
[31:45] and there goes the bride
[31:48] and he said I've never ever been a
[31:50] partaker of one of those things
[31:53] where the bride said it's me
[31:56] he said I've never yet seen the bride in
[31:58] the car with the speaker saying I'm the
[32:00] bride I'm the bride
[32:03] he said if you're part of the Bride this
[32:05] morning
[32:06] you don't have to tell the world you're
[32:07] part of the Bride you'll have the same
[32:09] spirit that the world in Christ in you
[32:12] and you won't have to make no
[32:13] announcements
[32:16] man because the everything in your
[32:20] garment but your character your spirit
[32:22] your atmosphere
[32:24] well now it's I'm seek
[32:29] amen I'm she
[32:31] Hallelujah
[32:32] oh it's just amazing amen you know this
[32:36] beautiful truth that we have
[32:39] about god Jehovah amen
[32:43] when the truth is open our Prophet said
[32:45] in the unveiling of God he said you know
[32:47] the gospel does two things he said when
[32:49] the gospel is revealed it shuts the eyes
[32:53] of some
[32:54] we don't want that to happen
[32:56] we're not a part of that
[32:58] and the Very exact same gospel opens the
[33:01] other eyes of the believer wide open
[33:04] amen God help us he said it's done in
[33:07] every age and he said it's deity veiled
[33:11] and flesh
[33:13] amen and you know you know the the the
[33:15] the the the the the
[33:16] humanity from the beginning of time have
[33:19] always wanted to worship the creation
[33:24] brother Dale still guilty of that
[33:27] and if you're breathing this morning you
[33:28] are too
[33:30] but before we go home God wants us to
[33:32] worship the creator of creation
[33:36] you see what I mean we always like to
[33:39] look at something our Prophet said that
[33:40] he said every country is looking for a
[33:42] savior a hero a prophet a leader a uh
[33:46] you know somebody's going to blow the
[33:48] Trump
[33:49] but the Trump's already sounded amen I'm
[33:51] not waiting for the election in the
[33:53] states and Trump to get voted in and it
[33:54] be a new Trump
[33:56] the Trump was sounded before the
[33:57] foundation of the world and I was there
[33:59] some people would say well you know you
[34:02] know uh I'm gonna leave somebody well
[34:04] it'd be good if you're leaving the
[34:06] person but you can't leave what you are
[34:07] amen you could leave a person in the
[34:10] flesh but you can't leave I was in him
[34:13] when he announced this message I was in
[34:16] God in Genesis when he said let's send
[34:18] out a message to the laosian church age
[34:21] I was there I can't leave that I was
[34:23] that's part of me it's not just my
[34:25] Badger skin it was in my DNA
[34:29] I can change my last name all I want but
[34:32] if you DNA me I'm carrying my daddy's
[34:34] father's DNA
[34:36] amen
[34:37] you can leave my daddy but you can't
[34:40] leave the DNA
[34:42] hallelujah amen and God's bringing that
[34:47] you know God has all these people are
[34:50] tools
[34:53] amen tools and I'm telling you I this
[34:56] shook me into the core and I've studied
[34:58] this in past and years past and then you
[35:01] know but every every servant of God
[35:04] is a tool
[35:07] Jesus himself
[35:09] in the flesh
[35:11] was a tool
[35:14] because our Prophet said that God can't
[35:15] die
[35:17] and God had to Tabernacle a body and
[35:20] become humanity and the worship me to
[35:24] show these I'm jumping ahead but he said
[35:26] we know that Jesus Christ was god
[35:28] Jehovah
[35:30] and our Prophet breaks it down he said
[35:31] the Jesus was the flesh
[35:34] but the anointed one
[35:37] was the fullness of the bot God had
[35:40] bodily Tabernacle did not flesh and you
[35:43] know everything their dad never taught
[35:45] them to do that either you know but God
[35:47] put that tool back and he came to Joshua
[35:49] and he said as I was with the 9 16th
[35:52] wrench so will I be with a half inch
[35:54] wrench amen amen that was just a two I
[35:57] used that tool and it's Jehovah but what
[36:00] I've done with that Jewish will put away
[36:02] in the chest amen the message isn't not
[36:05] the spirit is it
[36:07] hallelujah
[36:09] amen and that's how it was with every
[36:12] Prophet every evangelist every fivefold
[36:15] Ministry amen which is to a gift to the
[36:18] people just a tool and you put me if I
[36:20] died Tambora or today one of your
[36:22] brothers would get up here and preach
[36:24] the Same Spirit of Christ
[36:27] and it would be exactly the same Jehovah
[36:31] with a different wrench
[36:34] amen
[36:35] it's beautiful
[36:37] so you know and we do things and it's
[36:40] all right but you know because we're
[36:43] Tabernacle in flesh we we recognize
[36:46] Tabernacles we recognize wrenches
[36:49] but God wants you to recognize
[36:53] Jehovah himself
[36:55] amen and you can't put him in your
[36:59] little box
[37:00] he don't just dwell in our church alone
[37:06] amen you know just the well and your
[37:08] little family alone
[37:11] he knows just the well in this country
[37:13] or Ontario this town he's Jehovah he's a
[37:17] man he's everywhere
[37:23] and we we just think you know you know
[37:25] Pastor Faye mentioned he said and and I
[37:28] I thought of this this morning and is
[37:30] just Reviving he mentioned about how
[37:33] many people he's baptized in the name of
[37:35] the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:37] and they've stayed in their Church
[37:40] even denominational churches
[37:43] and the people it's only church no he
[37:45] said he said well shouldn't you get them
[37:47] to come to your church he said I'm not
[37:49] getting people to my church alone
[37:56] so I'm getting people to Christ and what
[37:58] he does with Christ is up to him
[38:01] right amen you know when we came back
[38:03] from from Africa to Not tooting my own
[38:06] horn but we had the preacher on the
[38:08] street and Sarnia and and a homeless
[38:10] person lived in a trailer uh four years
[38:13] ago we met him at the the wherever we
[38:16] met him swimming pool and baptized them
[38:18] amen
[38:20] no no George has been here a few times
[38:22] but I don't believe they came in this
[38:23] church once since they've been baptized
[38:25] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:27] amen
[38:30] that don't just man
[38:33] it's not about it's a man
[38:35] we think well you know God is God and
[38:39] God will have gifts and Tools around the
[38:42] world and he'll use them through their
[38:44] potential some were given 10 talents
[38:47] some were given three or one
[38:50] man
[38:51] don't judge God
[38:53] oh God help me God help me
[38:57] to let God be God
[38:59] and maybe it's half inch wrench
[39:02] amen you know there's a story told it
[39:04] just just laying a foundation and this
[39:07] helps us to a point but you know there
[39:10] was a huge ship I have it on my iPad and
[39:12] I kept it I got it probably over a year
[39:15] ago and sometimes I will keep something
[39:17] and and then God will say you know and I
[39:21] was in the shower when God's brought
[39:23] this to my mind this morning and you
[39:25] know this huge ship that had trouble
[39:27] with it and it's huge they they show a
[39:30] picture of the the man that's the the
[39:32] we're going to call him the Savior or
[39:34] the the the uh the uh invent of the ship
[39:37] and he just looks like an ant beside the
[39:39] windmill of this ship you know
[39:42] and they had multiple people come
[39:45] to fix it
[39:46] they couldn't fix the ship
[39:48] and so they called
[39:50] the Creator
[39:52] I love it
[39:53] they called The Creator
[39:55] you know I I just leaving this story for
[39:58] a second you know I heard a I heard an
[40:00] atheist questioning a guy on on on God
[40:03] and Christianity and that and he said he
[40:05] compared it like this he said you know
[40:07] the guy that created the computer ain't
[40:08] living in the computer but he knows
[40:11] everything about that computer
[40:13] you just ask him what's wrong with the
[40:14] computer
[40:16] right there
[40:18] am I and this guy didn't live in the
[40:19] ship but he knew everything about the
[40:21] ship he was the creator of the ship and
[40:23] so he went around and listened to him
[40:25] and scanned it he was just there for a
[40:27] bit and went to Head to Toes he hadn't
[40:29] done nothing
[40:30] but my kids will love this part because
[40:32] you know when we hire a mechanic come
[40:34] out to the Tractor
[40:36] it's a lot of money before they take the
[40:38] toolbox out
[40:39] hey man and
[40:42] he went around the ship
[40:43] and then he went over and he got his
[40:46] hammer
[40:47] and a little wrench
[40:49] he went to a certain spot in the ship he
[40:51] put his little wrench on he went
[40:57] Christ never did this to you he never
[41:00] sent you the bill
[41:01] man he sent them the bill
[41:03] it was 500 000.
[41:05] and the ship owner got the bill
[41:07] and he was like me when I get a bill
[41:09] from Delta
[41:15] wow
[41:18] they called up the Creator and they said
[41:22] wow
[41:25] oh we got your Biddle
[41:28] I said yes is there a problem
[41:30] well no the ship works perfectly there's
[41:33] not a problem
[41:34] but he said could you break down your
[41:36] bill
[41:38] you know because you know we've just
[41:39] seen you take like you know we just seen
[41:42] you take this and just unveil it like it
[41:44] was just like
[41:46] I hope you get this from God
[41:48] pictures from God and he said well for
[41:50] the ranch and the hammer
[41:53] it's ten dollars
[41:56] but for the know-how to where to put the
[41:59] wrench and to top with the hammer 400
[42:03] uh
[42:04] thousand
[42:06] nine hundred and
[42:08] whatever that number is
[42:11] amen
[42:14] brother Dale don't know how to show you
[42:15] God
[42:16] but God knows how to show you guys
[42:20] Christ knows how to show you who he is
[42:22] amen
[42:24] and all I'm saying this morning God's
[42:26] saying is don't get caught up in the
[42:28] tool
[42:30] now now listen when God's using that
[42:32] tool
[42:33] Moses was God
[42:37] don't challenge God
[42:39] that was God
[42:41] period the people that challenged Moses
[42:43] god swallowed them up
[42:48] I'm not understanding the door
[42:50] but when God was done with that tool
[42:53] God went to a new tool and now Joshua
[42:58] head to toe
[42:59] and nobody conquered the world like
[43:02] Joshua
[43:03] because he's God see you know and we
[43:06] could say well this is my favorite
[43:08] careful
[43:09] favorite God
[43:11] you know the denominational Spirit of
[43:13] the age this guy got three he's got him
[43:16] in two he's got them sitting by the
[43:18] father you know
[43:19] but God is a spirit
[43:21] and them that worship Him
[43:23] must worship Him in spirit
[43:26] and the truth and people are seeing the
[43:28] tool
[43:29] as the god
[43:31] and as long as the God is in him like
[43:34] Christ it was the fullness of the
[43:36] godhead bodily that was God
[43:39] but Jesus flesh body
[43:42] is not in heaven
[43:46] amen thus saith the Bible
[43:50] Flesh and Blood don't inherit the
[43:51] Kingdom of Heaven
[43:55] and our prophet's going to break you
[43:56] down a lot more I'm not afraid to go
[43:58] here because I had the prophets message
[44:00] to show you amen
[44:03] and so what God's trying to show you
[44:05] this morning it's not it's just himself
[44:07] but when he can't show you himself
[44:10] without showing him you
[44:13] and Satan has told you a lie
[44:17] that you're not worthy
[44:19] and you're not you're not who you are
[44:22] and you're smaller than you are and you
[44:25] don't deserve it and all this that's a
[44:27] lie
[44:29] because we've seen last Sunday and I
[44:30] don't want to go back and re-preach it
[44:31] but we've seen that last Sunday in
[44:33] Revelations about what was it 13 or
[44:35] something when John seen the son of man
[44:37] in the candlesticks
[44:40] the Bible says it looked like it looked
[44:43] like John said he said it looks like the
[44:45] son of man
[44:47] and we read the quotes last Sunday where
[44:49] it was the Bride In Christ John seen the
[44:53] Bride In Christ in Revelations
[44:56] amen
[44:58] and you're still in Christ
[45:01] if you were in them in the first place
[45:03] amen let's turn to Galatians 2 20 and 21
[45:07] he said I'm crucified with Christ
[45:08] nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ
[45:12] liveth in me and he said the life which
[45:14] I now live by the faith of the Son of
[45:17] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[45:21] 21. and watch this this is where we want
[45:24] to go this is exactly my context here
[45:27] this morning
[45:29] I do not frustrate I want to preach on
[45:32] flesh rate
[45:36] God
[45:40] frustrate means to prevent
[45:43] defeat
[45:45] from being fulfilled
[45:48] I do not frustrate the grace of God for
[45:52] which righteousness come by the law then
[45:56] Christ died
[45:58] in vain you aren't part of Christ
[46:00] because you were born in this message
[46:02] you ain't part of Christ because you're
[46:04] a Godly person you ain't part of Christ
[46:07] because you're sitting here today you're
[46:09] part of Christ because God had been this
[46:12] foreknowledge made you part of Christ
[46:14] and in his thoughts before before Jesus
[46:18] even went to the cross it was finished
[46:20] and the crucifixion where he redeemed
[46:23] you back to his rightful owner oh
[46:26] hallelujah it's beautiful let's not
[46:29] frustrate God
[46:32] amen
[46:34] Hallelujah now he said here in Believers
[46:37] positions in Christ he said now if we
[46:39] can and we're going to get so we show
[46:41] him he said now if you can find your
[46:42] position and know God's word that has
[46:46] the promise in it he said that's the
[46:49] reason Joshua and Caleb had no fear
[46:53] man what have we even preaching on Amen
[46:55] speak the word and go forward amen amen
[47:00] you won't speak you don't have to worry
[47:02] you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[47:03] this morning and you know that and God
[47:06] knows that you don't have to be afraid
[47:08] of speaking outside of God's word it
[47:10] won't happen
[47:11] amen
[47:12] he said that's why they had no fear he
[47:15] said you can look at this you can you
[47:18] can't look watch this this is beautiful
[47:21] you you Believers that are sitting here
[47:23] and you you want something from God he
[47:26] said you can't look at the sense of
[47:28] reasonings
[47:29] he said you look at the promise
[47:32] God said every seed will bring Earth of
[47:35] its kind period
[47:39] period
[47:41] promise number two
[47:43] amen
[47:45] you don't have to pray about that that's
[47:47] a saith the word of God
[47:51] amen
[47:52] Hallelujah

[48:21] believe that I'd say which we're
[48:23] spending a few Sundays on

[48:50] Amen in the seventh Church ages he talks
[48:53] about the candle sex and I I was unsure
[48:55] if I don't think I had read this one
[48:57] because I put next Sunday on it amen
[49:00] he said what one like him this is
[49:03] talking about John the prophet's talking
[49:04] about John reading it he said who was
[49:06] this it was his bride
[49:10] one like him watch how it was
[49:13] Holiness of Jesus covering her man we

[49:18] preaching of the Gospel amen hallelujah
[49:21] one like him
[49:26] thank you Jesus
[49:29] Christ in his church as bride and Christ
[49:33] being one like a husband and wife is one
[49:36] Christ the church in Christ being molded
[49:40] together with one person the same holy
[49:45] spirit it's the things that Christ did
[49:48] his bride will do also you know our
[49:51] Prophet said this he said you know if I
[49:54] had the spirit of an artist
[49:56] I would paint
[49:57] I'd paint that beautiful painting we
[49:59] have in the hall
[50:01] if I had the spirit of Dillinger I'd
[50:04] carry guns
[50:05] man if I had a spirit of
[50:09] I would do that
[50:11] but we have the spirit of Christ
[50:14] we have the spirit of Christ
[50:16] and the spirit of Christ through what
[50:18] Christ did
[50:20] and you don't have to think about it
[50:23] you don't have to fear about it
[50:26] speak it
[50:29] because it's Christ
[50:30] I know I know you're trying to you're
[50:33] trying to but
[50:37] God help a point

[50:53] spirit and if so
[50:56] be
[50:57] that spirit of God dwelt in you
[51:00] now if any man had the spirit of Christ
[51:04] he is none
[51:06] of his
[51:09] man you are Christ if you're got the
[51:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen God help
[51:16] us to see what God has
[51:19] you know in second Corinthians 11 I uh
[51:23] maybe we'll pull this last scripture up
[51:25] and then we'll go to our our slide some
[51:27] second Corinthians 11 and I've read this
[51:30] before and and uh but I just I'm going
[51:33] to touch on this here's Paul talking he
[51:35] says but I am jealous over you with The
[51:38] Godly Godly jealousy for I have exposed
[51:42] you to one husband
[51:44] that I may present you
[51:46] as a Chase version to Christ
[51:49] look at how Paul talks there's no
[51:52] coincidence in this scripture Christ
[51:55] but I fear less by any means the serpent
[51:58] the devil will beguile as he beguiled
[52:01] Eve through his subtility so your mind
[52:04] should be corrupted by the Simplicity
[52:07] that is in watch how he says it
[52:09] Christ
[52:11] God is a spirit
[52:13] those that worship Him in spirit in
[52:16] Christ see Paul is bypassing all the
[52:19] tools
[52:20] and he's going right to the Head
[52:23] Hallelujah
[52:25] amen every scripture he says he don't
[52:28] want
[52:32] don't like us and Satan wants us to get

[57:15] said now the body
[57:17] now his body is to do the same thing
[57:21] because the body is
[57:24] the body is the head and the body is
[57:27] together
[57:28] so if you have the baptism of the Holy
[57:30] Ghost this morning you're a part of
[57:33] Christ the anointed one
[57:36] that's right and that's why John in
[57:38] Revelation seeing Christ and he and he
[57:40] couldn't he was trying to see a man but
[57:42] the bride was in him
[57:44] and if Christ the head was the word the
[57:48] body has to be the same thing as the
[57:50] head that's right
[57:52] Hallelujah the way the body operates is
[57:56] by the head that's right let's drop to
[57:58] the bottom there to the bottom paragraph
[58:00] and I love it brother and I tell you
[58:02] that I preach on the same some of this a
[58:07] wow the way the body operates is by the
[58:09] head and the head is the word
[58:13] amen hallelujah God must be the head of
[58:17] Our Lives he must be the head of the
[58:18] church he must be the the head of the
[58:20] fivefold ministry and this beautiful
[58:23] message that we believe it's it's it's
[58:25] it's Christ you you can't just amen you
[58:30] may leave a person but you can't leave
[58:33] what's DNA in you
[58:36] amen hallelujah I'm every bit this
[58:40] message I was there when it was
[58:42] announced
[58:44] amen I was in him
[58:46] Hallelujah watch here he said look
[58:48] Christ is the head of the body is that
[58:51] right well whatever the head is the body
[58:54] is with glory and where the head goes it
[58:57] takes the body with it and where Jesus
[59:00] is the church is with them
[59:03] and he won't get out of his word he
[59:05] stays with the word watches over it and
[59:08] it manifests
[59:09] his church
[59:11] is with them
[59:13] amen God help us to recognize who we are
[59:17] and not be afraid of being Christians
[59:20] not be afraid of being Christ in our day
[59:25] Hallelujah
[59:26] he said here's this one that we we
[59:28] mentioned he said
[59:31] now the Holy Spirit Well it does the
[59:33] work of Jesus Christ The Same Spirit
[59:34] that was on him and he said uh
[59:39] he said then you can rest assured that
[59:41] if you believe in God
[59:43] and believe that you have the baptism of
[59:45] the Holy Ghost that's the same Holy
[59:47] Ghost because it's doing the same thing
[59:49] that it did
[59:52] was The Real Son of God and when it
[59:54] comes upon the Sons and Daughters of
[59:56] adoption that's what we're doing that's
[59:58] what we've been doing adoption it does
[1:00:01] the same thing
[1:00:03] as it did there
[1:00:05] amen the world will recognize Christ and
[1:00:07] you won't have to announce it amen if I
[1:00:10] told you that I had the spirit of John
[1:00:12] Dillinger then I would carry two big
[1:00:14] guns and if I had the spirit of an
[1:00:16] artist he said I would paint a picture
[1:00:20] that's the beauty of it
[1:00:22] if I had the spirit of a mechanic I
[1:00:25] could listen to your car but he said
[1:00:27] I'll tell you if you got the spirit of
[1:00:30] Christ then the works that Christ did
[1:00:33] you can't believe me why you can't
[1:00:35] believe the works
[1:00:38] Hallelujah
[1:00:39] God help us
[1:00:41] to see Christ
[1:00:43] you know so many people you know if it
[1:00:46] taught it so beautifully and they said
[1:00:49] we're going to get into this you know uh
[1:00:56] pull up my tell me when the scripture
[1:00:59] comes up I have a scripture here I mean
[1:01:01] I'm not sure when it will come up
[1:01:04] the next slide taking sides with Jesus
[1:01:06] here he says not what I've done or I am
[1:01:10] but what I will be
[1:01:12] but what he is you see it's all about
[1:01:15] Christ he said it's all predestination
[1:01:18] he said I am in him and whatsoever he is
[1:01:21] I'm a part of him amen I'm saved because
[1:01:25] I'm a part of him and he he is God and
[1:01:29] I'm a part of him being his son that's
[1:01:31] right so it ain't what I've done it's
[1:01:33] what I or what I'll what I'll do
[1:01:36] it's what he's done that I might trust
[1:01:39] right there
[1:01:40] Hallelujah pull our next slide up Amy I
[1:01:42] believe it will be our scripture
[1:01:45] in Mark 14 we have a I believe I put it
[1:01:48] in there
[1:01:49] in Mark 14
[1:01:51] yeah amen
[1:01:54] 34. I just put this up on the slides
[1:01:56] because it's hard for the the on the
[1:01:58] sound to switch back and forth but watch
[1:02:00] here you know we can see here right in
[1:02:03] the scripture and this is also in the
[1:02:04] other gospels where where the Flesh and
[1:02:07] we're going to go into this
[1:02:09] but where the Flesh of Jesus
[1:02:13] was flesh
[1:02:14] and our Prophet said that so don't don't
[1:02:16] run out yet don't don't Wing we'll
[1:02:19] vindicate it with the with our Prophet
[1:02:21] amen
[1:02:22] but here here in Mark 14
[1:02:25] and 34 and he saith unto them my soul is
[1:02:29] exceedingly sorrowful unto death Terry
[1:02:30] ye hear and watch now here's here's
[1:02:32] Jesus before he's crucified and he went
[1:02:34] a little while and fell on the ground
[1:02:36] and prayed and he said if it be possible
[1:02:39] the hour may pass from him
[1:02:42] and he said Abba Father all things are
[1:02:45] possible with thee take this cup from me
[1:02:48] nevertheless not thy will
[1:02:53] but my will not my will but thy will be
[1:02:56] done
[1:03:00] see there's
[1:03:03] the Christ he oh he had the fullness of
[1:03:06] the godhead bodily our Prophet said
[1:03:08] hundreds of times thousands of times
[1:03:10] that was Jehovah God
[1:03:12] completely
[1:03:15] but his flesh let's just just
[1:03:18] I'm going to show you what's the prophet
[1:03:20] said
[1:03:22] but when God was done with his flesh
[1:03:27] he was done with it
[1:03:31] the prophet said things like this and
[1:03:33] we're going to show you coming up he
[1:03:34] said God couldn't die and pay the price
[1:03:36] for our sins
[1:03:38] had to be a Kinsmen Redeemer so it had
[1:03:40] to be one of us to pay that price
[1:03:42] but none of us were why are they
[1:03:45] and so God you know brother brother Ben
[1:03:47] NORAD preached that beautiful message
[1:03:48] last time he was here how God came down
[1:03:50] and and co-mingled with Humanity
[1:03:54] and so God made a body in Jesus Christ
[1:03:58] and he tabernacled in it completely in
[1:04:00] the fullness
[1:04:03] and that body was Jehovah God and the
[1:04:07] word became flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:04:10] hello
[1:04:11] that was God
[1:04:16] but that word became flesh and dwelt
[1:04:18] Among Us is still here
[1:04:22] he was a fullness we have a portion
[1:04:25] he was the fullness of God but when God
[1:04:27] went back to Glory
[1:04:29] he laid down that ranch
[1:04:33] because the prophet said it like this he
[1:04:35] said in in Gethsemane he said the spirit
[1:04:37] of God
[1:04:38] left the body
[1:04:41] because the spirit couldn't sin
[1:04:45] and the spirit couldn't die
[1:04:50] he said in another place he said Jesus
[1:04:52] body was a tabernacle that God used to
[1:04:56] pay the price
[1:04:57] for sin
[1:04:59] that's why our Prophet said that you
[1:05:02] can't you can't make God three like most
[1:05:04] denominations do
[1:05:05] but he said you can't make them one like
[1:05:07] your finger either
[1:05:09] even though he's one God
[1:05:12] but not like your finger
[1:05:15] he's one God in many Tabernacles
[1:05:18] he's one God in many wrenches
[1:05:21] because God is a spirit
[1:05:23] those that worship Him must worship Him
[1:05:25] in spirit and truth so now we here
[1:05:27] believe you got the baptism of the Holy
[1:05:29] Ghost and you're struggling with
[1:05:39] you believe God is omnipotent and all
[1:05:43] capable and all-knowing
[1:05:46] and you're struggling with
[1:05:51] not only are you connected with God
[1:05:55] but you're a part of him
[1:05:57] hello
[1:06:00] and you had a
[1:06:03] struggle
[1:06:07] that's why the word of God said I know
[1:06:09] the thoughts that I have for you
[1:06:11] and they weren't thoughts to struggle
[1:06:14] God never planned on his bride being
[1:06:17] beat up persecuted suffering
[1:06:21] taken high blood pressure pills and low
[1:06:23] blood pressure pills and and downers and
[1:06:26] uppers and and I'm depressed how can God
[1:06:29] be depressed
[1:06:36] Hallelujah that's why in the scripture
[1:06:38] when Moses came crying to God because
[1:06:40] the people were always crying to him he
[1:06:42] said why don't you bothering me for
[1:06:46] this is just speak the word
[1:06:49] just speak the word and go forward
[1:06:53] Hallelujah
[1:06:54] amen you'll see this let's continue in
[1:06:56] this scripture and then in 37 so here
[1:06:59] here the flash the prophet said it
[1:07:01] clearly like this the flesh didn't want
[1:07:03] to die of Jesus
[1:07:05] but his whole purpose on Earth was to
[1:07:08] die for our sins
[1:07:10] amen
[1:07:12] and he came and find the the disciples
[1:07:15] sleep and Simon's sleeping he said
[1:07:16] couldn't not wait with me an hour and
[1:07:18] and watch ye and pray lest you enter
[1:07:20] into temptation and the spirit truly is
[1:07:23] ready but the flesh is weak and in verse
[1:07:26] 39 and again Jesus went away
[1:07:29] and prayed and spake exactly
[1:07:34] the same words
[1:07:38] that should give you hope and rest this
[1:07:41] morning
[1:07:43] there's Jesus the son of God
[1:07:47] the fullness of the godhead body Jehovah
[1:07:50] God
[1:07:51] but in his flesh was wheat
[1:07:56] in this hour of Temptation and he went
[1:07:59] to Jehovah God twice
[1:08:01] it's recorded in two gospels twice
[1:08:05] and ask God to change his mind
[1:08:12] amen believe me that was heavy on me too
[1:08:15] it took me about a year to get over that
[1:08:18] amen but our Prophet explains it
[1:08:21] beautifully here here's an example and
[1:08:23] we're gonna we've got to go faster in
[1:08:24] this we'll pull up our next quote he
[1:08:26] said Adam and Eve had the same Spirit he
[1:08:28] said in Genesis 1 27 one of my favorite
[1:08:30] scriptures and in the image of God
[1:08:33] God created us in the end and God is a
[1:08:36] spirit and in the image God created he
[1:08:37] him male and female created he them and
[1:08:40] the spirit form was God and Adam was to
[1:08:43] take care of the land
[1:08:44] man let's just jump to the next one and
[1:08:47] yet man was not flesh
[1:08:50] he was both
[1:08:51] masculine and he was also feminine
[1:08:56] see there's where John could look at the
[1:08:59] son of man in the Candlestick in
[1:09:00] Revelation and say but it's well I think
[1:09:03] it's Jesus but you were in him
[1:09:06] you were you you think you were you were
[1:09:09] born and Lael to see in church age but
[1:09:11] before the church ages even started you
[1:09:13] were in Christ
[1:09:14] you could no more be lost than Christ
[1:09:17] could be lost
[1:09:18] amen
[1:09:20] Hallelujah so you know yeah I had
[1:09:24] somebody mentioned to me a while back
[1:09:25] they said you know God don't have a
[1:09:28] feminine spirit
[1:09:32] and also was the feminine because it was
[1:09:35] the same spirit
[1:09:39] I guess you wouldn't have to you'd have
[1:09:41] to not believe in a prophet's message
[1:09:44] I believe he mentioned the feminine
[1:09:45] spirit being in Christ about seven times
[1:09:49] the man here in the church ages imagines
[1:09:52] he said thus the bride is eternal is
[1:09:57] sorry thus the bride is literally the
[1:09:59] spoken word see Bride and though she is
[1:10:02] feminine in in destination
[1:10:05] she is also called the body of Christ it
[1:10:09] was a very
[1:10:12] it was a very uh
[1:10:19] it was very apparent that she ought to
[1:10:22] and be called that she was predestinated
[1:10:25] in him
[1:10:26] the same source and and if you go to the
[1:10:29] next quote there on this he says uh I
[1:10:33] just want to read the the a minute drop
[1:10:35] and he said even so are we Eternal
[1:10:37] thoughts of him that turn because the
[1:10:40] many members spoken word seed was
[1:10:42] manifested in flesh and thus the Eternal
[1:10:45] thoughts thou manifested in flesh are
[1:10:47] the sons of God even as we are so-called
[1:10:50] and watch this this is this is good the
[1:10:53] capital letters are really good he said
[1:10:55] you did not become seed by the rebirth
[1:10:58] he said we were seed and therefore were
[1:11:02] reborn for only the elect can be reborn
[1:11:06] because you were seed is the reason that
[1:11:09] you could be quickened in non-seed
[1:11:12] there's nothing to Quicken
[1:11:14] he's and he goes just to drop the
[1:11:16] highlights he said God by his death shed
[1:11:18] the blood and brought back to his own he
[1:11:21] brought back the spoken word seed the
[1:11:23] bride Hallelujah and he said you were
[1:11:26] always sheep you can never be you never
[1:11:29] were a pig or a dog and turned into a
[1:11:33] sheep
[1:11:35] Hallelujah as we were in the thoughts of
[1:11:38] God and God expressed Us in flesh and so
[1:11:42] Satan for all these years has been
[1:11:45] beaten down the bride of Christ in every
[1:11:47] Church age
[1:11:49] saying you're not worthy you're not
[1:11:51] worthy you're not it's just like watch
[1:11:54] Spirits don't die watch what he did with
[1:11:56] Jesus Christ himself
[1:12:00] when he went something if Thou Art
[1:12:02] Christ
[1:12:04] our Christ just throw yourself down here
[1:12:07] and God will raise you up if
[1:12:11] if you are Christ just speak the word
[1:12:14] and you'll have bread turn the stones
[1:12:16] and spread if
[1:12:18] and that same devil is very alive and
[1:12:21] well in message churches and he's going
[1:12:23] to to Born Again baptism of the Holy
[1:12:27] Ghost Believers for years believe in the
[1:12:29] full Vindicated word and the Bible is a
[1:12:31] brand new book and he's saying if you
[1:12:34] can
[1:12:35] and it's time that you punch him in the
[1:12:37] nose
[1:12:42] Hallelujah
[1:12:45] show us the father
[1:12:48] and it'll suffice us and the woman said
[1:12:50] this this is powerful he said who did he
[1:12:54] pray to he's talking about Jesus
[1:12:57] you need to know this who do you pray to
[1:13:00] you pray to God where is he
[1:13:07] that's what the prophet says
[1:13:09] who did he pray to In The Garden of
[1:13:10] Gethsemane and on the street the one
[1:13:12] time I he said I want to ask you
[1:13:15] something when you testify that you had
[1:13:17] the Holy Ghost
[1:13:19] where is it at
[1:13:22] the holy ghost that you got is it just
[1:13:24] in heaven
[1:13:28] what do you pray to
[1:13:31] he said
[1:13:33] this is a direct quote it's on the
[1:13:36] inside of you of course
[1:13:39] I pray to myself oh that's disrespectful
[1:13:42] brother Dale you're not God no I'm not
[1:13:45] God In the Flesh but Christ is
[1:13:47] tabernacled inside me so who do I pray
[1:13:49] to I pray to the god that's inside of me
[1:13:51] because he's because my flesh is dead
[1:13:53] and it's not me no more that liveth but
[1:13:55] Christ that liveth in me and so when I
[1:13:57] pray I don't have to get a good phone
[1:13:58] connection through you know whatever
[1:14:00] high-speed connection
[1:14:03] because I'm praying to
[1:14:05] the Christ in brother now
[1:14:08] amen I swear we're not building a holy
[1:14:11] priesthood
[1:14:13] any one of you sisters brothers children
[1:14:15] anybody with the baptism Holy Ghost it's
[1:14:18] fine if you want to call a minister your
[1:14:20] pastor or whoever and that lots of times
[1:14:24] will build your faith but it's in you
[1:14:26] it's in you the our very own Prophet
[1:14:29] said it's not me that does it
[1:14:32] hey man it's not even crazy does it it's
[1:14:35] your faith
[1:14:36] it's your faith in the finished work
[1:14:40] amen
[1:14:42] so who did Jesus pray to Jesus was
[1:14:45] praying asking God to change his mind
[1:14:48] because he was the fullness of the
[1:14:50] godhead bodily
[1:14:52] he was packing God
[1:14:55] when you go to the grocery store you're
[1:14:57] packing God
[1:14:59] help me to be a testimony that everybody
[1:15:01] will see me that I don't have to tell
[1:15:03] them where I go to church but they'll
[1:15:05] just know when they see me
[1:15:07] maybe they won't see me maybe they'll
[1:15:09] just hear me
[1:15:11] and they'll know by my language that I
[1:15:13] don't curse and I don't talk rough and I
[1:15:15] treat my wife Sweden and I I treat my
[1:15:18] kids with respect
[1:15:22] who do you pray to you
[1:15:26] Hallelujah
[1:15:28] he said well we have the spirit with
[1:15:30] measure and he had it without measure
[1:15:34] and he said your sons and daughters of
[1:15:36] God by measure like taking a spoonful of
[1:15:39] water out of the ocean and he was the
[1:15:41] whole ocean but the same chemicals
[1:15:44] Hallelujah I could just about lose my
[1:15:47] mind he's about the same chemicals that
[1:15:49] was in that Spoonful is in the whole
[1:15:51] ocean
[1:15:52] he said it's quantity but the same
[1:15:56] quantity Quality quality it's quality
[1:15:58] but the same quality therefore Christ is
[1:16:01] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:16:06] we have to believe that before we can go
[1:16:08] in a rapture
[1:16:09] God's God's not coming back for your man
[1:16:13] we're going to have a glorified body
[1:16:14] he's coming back for himself
[1:16:17] himself
[1:16:18] he's not coming back for this ugly fat
[1:16:20] guy
[1:16:21] he's coming back for himself that's
[1:16:24] Tabernacle inside of him
[1:16:28] Hallelujah adoption but one day when the
[1:16:31] lamb came he said the man and Satan
[1:16:36] man even Satan was fooled he looked
[1:16:38] around
[1:16:40] him and said if thou be the Son of God
[1:16:43] hallelujah and I tied these Rags around
[1:16:46] his eyes and he said if you be a prophet
[1:16:48] when I hit you Satan don't you know what
[1:16:50] God don't put on a show for nobody
[1:16:54] Hallelujah
[1:16:56] God never even opened his mouth
[1:17:00] oh did he ever pull the wool over their
[1:17:02] eyes sent it
[1:17:04] 89 in the middle of this and highlight
[1:17:06] he said if thou be if thou be and that's
[1:17:09] exactly the same death that comes to
[1:17:11] church at this place said well if you be
[1:17:14] the son of God
[1:17:15] you know
[1:17:19] you know what you could tell him next
[1:17:21] time he says if say Satan just hang
[1:17:23] around find out
[1:17:26] just hang around a while he can't do it
[1:17:29] he can't do it
[1:17:33] he said if thou be oh he said ain't
[1:17:35] ain't that ain't him he said why look at
[1:17:38] him he's bleeding he's he's talking
[1:17:40] about Jesus he's bleeding and some of
[1:17:42] those soldiers come over and spit in his
[1:17:44] face he said Satan's watching all this
[1:17:46] and he said there's no way that's God
[1:17:50] he said I'll anchor my Stinger of death
[1:17:52] in him
[1:17:54] and he said that'll finish it for good
[1:17:58] he anchored it really good and deep
[1:18:02] but he could never sting again
[1:18:05] Paul said there's beautiful scriptures
[1:18:07] in the Bible death where is thy sting
[1:18:09] grave wears thy victory
[1:18:13] Hallelujah it wasn't Paul
[1:18:16] it was God and when he the last Christ
[1:18:19] said Elohim Elohim my God my God that
[1:18:23] this is the prophet is up there he said
[1:18:25] that was right at the bottom he said
[1:18:26] that was a man
[1:18:32] why has Thou forsaken me he said that
[1:18:34] was the man
[1:18:36] In The Garden of Gethsemane Gethsemane
[1:18:39] the anointing left him and you know that
[1:18:42] he died as a sinner he died a sinner you
[1:18:45] know that not his sins
[1:18:48] but yours and mine
[1:18:50] Hallelujah
[1:18:52] Hallelujah
[1:18:54] Hallelujah God God wants you to know
[1:18:58] not just who he is
[1:19:02] remember what our title was the
[1:19:04] revelation of Christ
[1:19:06] and you
[1:19:10] who are you
[1:19:13] Hallelujah
[1:19:15] and the rising of the sun he said I'm
[1:19:18] trying to show you that you when you
[1:19:21] rise when God raised Jesus from the dead
[1:19:24] he raised you up also
[1:19:27] it was we were in him
[1:19:30] the spirit man was in him I was there I
[1:19:33] was there when he died on the cross I
[1:19:35] was there when God spoke it I was there
[1:19:38] when God created us I was there when God
[1:19:40] asked us
[1:19:42] Hallelujah this here we got this up this
[1:19:46] is the rising of the sun he said the
[1:19:47] spirit left them in the Garden of
[1:19:49] Gethsemane and he died a man remember
[1:19:51] friends he didn't have to do that that
[1:19:54] was God
[1:19:55] God anointed that flesh which was human
[1:19:59] flesh
[1:20:01] and he didn't if he
[1:20:04] went up there as God he had never died
[1:20:07] that kind of death because you can't
[1:20:10] kill
[1:20:11] God
[1:20:13] I had a message believer tell me
[1:20:15] that if the Flesh of Jesus wasn't
[1:20:17] Jehovah God
[1:20:18] then our sins ain't paid for her
[1:20:23] but he needs to read a Vindicated
[1:20:25] message
[1:20:27] that the prophet brought a tool and when
[1:20:30] the brother Branham came he brought his
[1:20:32] old Flashlight and God was shining his
[1:20:34] flashlight and all the different
[1:20:35] scriptures so the prophet could read
[1:20:37] them
[1:20:38] and bring them to us
[1:20:41] Matt
[1:20:43] Hallelujah we read that quote last
[1:20:45] Sunday
[1:20:47] where brother Brown said every
[1:20:49] minister
[1:20:51] points of light to Jesus
[1:20:54] Hallelujah
[1:20:58] in the middle there in 2 42 but remember
[1:21:01] he went up there with you in him
[1:21:05] you got it come up to your adoption amen
[1:21:10] stop being beat up
[1:21:14] said this and remember he went up there
[1:21:18] with you in him see God never separated
[1:21:21] the bride from the groom
[1:21:24] yet so when God looked down upon his
[1:21:28] body of Christ he saw both male and
[1:21:30] female and it was redeemed in that one
[1:21:33] body and they were the same same word
[1:21:36] the same word spoke
[1:21:38] of the groom
[1:21:39] speaks
[1:21:41] of the Bride that's beautiful
[1:21:44] amen there's no way that Satan could
[1:21:46] defeat you with that kind of a victory
[1:21:50] amen with that kind of power
[1:21:52] no you're gonna he couldn't defeat Jesus
[1:21:55] when he tempted him he can't defeat us
[1:21:57] either
[1:21:58] amen hallelujah
[1:22:01] God always finds
[1:22:04] their places gifts always find God's
[1:22:07] gifts always find their places
[1:22:09] and what deity was in service for god
[1:22:12] for death Jesus was deity in service for
[1:22:17] death to redeem the world now watch this
[1:22:20] I mentioned this I know you you've you
[1:22:22] you almost
[1:22:24] the flesh was a ranch
[1:22:28] it was a ranch
[1:22:31] he said they say he couldn't be deity
[1:22:34] and die
[1:22:35] the man was the body
[1:22:38] was not deity but the deity was in the
[1:22:42] body
[1:22:43] this body has to perish the very Christ
[1:22:46] that's in you is the only thing that can
[1:22:49] raise you up he said it's deity it's God
[1:22:52] in you it's the exactly the same thing
[1:22:56] everybody's wanting to worship a person
[1:22:59] or or a gift or an office or something
[1:23:03] but Christ is in you who do you pray to
[1:23:08] the Christ in you
[1:23:11] amen it's fight you know look at the
[1:23:14] gift of the Gentiles you know the Jews
[1:23:17] they lay their hands and and for the
[1:23:19] gift to come forth but you know in the
[1:23:21] in the New Testament the Gentiles said
[1:23:23] just speak the word
[1:23:26] a prophet said just in the ministering
[1:23:28] of the word you're healed it's the
[1:23:31] spirit of Christ
[1:23:34] amen we gotta we you know you know God
[1:23:37] wants us to get rid of this religion
[1:23:39] garbage
[1:23:41] of this world and and come into him the
[1:23:44] fullness of the body
[1:23:46] amen it's Jehovah
[1:23:48] amen hallelujah he said now notice now
[1:23:51] the same now that they were they were
[1:23:54] they rejected they they rejected
[1:24:01] identified the deity do you get that he
[1:24:04] said but when it comes to accepting
[1:24:07] deity and expressing back the same kind
[1:24:10] of a gift like they did
[1:24:13] here here you go let me just drop down
[1:24:15] here he said
[1:24:16] he said when you identify yourself with
[1:24:18] deity by giving all that you are and
[1:24:21] what you are through deity itself
[1:24:25] Hallelujah he said he's still deity
[1:24:28] because he is the word and when when we
[1:24:31] see the word living itself when we know
[1:24:33] that man can't do that it's deity the
[1:24:36] word being manifested in man it's Jesus
[1:24:39] himself the son of man can do nothing in
[1:24:42] himself I can do nothing for I am a man
[1:24:45] Jesus said but the father that dwelleth
[1:24:47] in me soweth me all these things that he
[1:24:50] doeth and there you are that's it it's
[1:24:53] not it's not you or me and the flesh but
[1:24:56] it's Christ in us it's the god that
[1:24:58] we've died out to and man of course you
[1:25:01] have to have the new birth
[1:25:02] amen it's a God that we came from we've
[1:25:05] reconciled back to
[1:25:07] getting back to
[1:25:09] hallelujah it's deity being identified
[1:25:12] in a man
[1:25:15] Hallelujah
[1:25:17] thank you Lord Jesus let's go quick here
[1:25:20] God help us amen
[1:25:23] hearing the testimony on the sea he said
[1:25:27] he said the man he can do the son of man
[1:25:29] can do nothing in himself until he sees
[1:25:31] the father do it and we'll just drop
[1:25:33] down he said I belong with you and you
[1:25:35] don't know me because here here they
[1:25:38] came and said you know Jesus show us the
[1:25:39] father and he said if you've seen me
[1:25:41] you've seen the father he said it's not
[1:25:43] me that doeth the works it's a father
[1:25:45] that dwelleth in Me God is a spirit now
[1:25:48] here we go this is you got this up here
[1:25:50] I can't I got my paper over my screen he
[1:25:52] said Jesus was the man
[1:25:59] he was the tabernacle that God dwelted
[1:26:03] now he was a spirit without measure he
[1:26:05] had the spirit without measure and like
[1:26:07] all the water out there in the sea it
[1:26:10] was it was in him
[1:26:13] but in us it's a spoonful out of the we
[1:26:16] got it by measure but it's the same
[1:26:19] chemicals Hallelujah
[1:26:20] amen this is important to know who you
[1:26:23] are who Christ is and so we're not
[1:26:26] worshiping some some lie of the devil
[1:26:31] Hallelujah
[1:26:35] he said now this is in uh sirs we would
[1:26:38] see Jesus he said Jesus was born for one
[1:26:41] purpose and that was for God to make
[1:26:44] manifest himself through the body and
[1:26:48] God was Christ reconciling the world to
[1:26:51] himself and he was a body that had made
[1:26:54] physical
[1:26:56] that man and woman can see
[1:26:59] what he thought
[1:27:01] Hallelujah Christ seemed to be a durable
[1:27:03] dual personality here we see this in the
[1:27:05] middle starting in the red highlight
[1:27:07] Christ seemed to be a durable
[1:27:08] personality he would speak something
[1:27:11] and they would scratch their heads and
[1:27:14] they didn't understand him
[1:27:16] he didn't speak he would speak one thing
[1:27:19] one time
[1:27:20] look like
[1:27:22] and something else another time
[1:27:24] you know that was for to stumble the
[1:27:27] ones that weren't his
[1:27:30] you can't stumble yourself
[1:27:32] you know I can misspeak in something and
[1:27:34] even my wife can come home and say you
[1:27:36] know you called somebody by the wrong
[1:27:37] name or that but I knew what I was
[1:27:39] saying but I said it wrong
[1:27:41] but I I was I
[1:27:44] and the people watching Christ he said
[1:27:46] they looked at it
[1:27:50] they couldn't understand it said one
[1:27:52] thing one time look like and something
[1:27:54] else another time you know that same
[1:27:57] devil watches that same devil will say
[1:28:00] that about this message in our prophet
[1:28:03] watch that devil recognize the spirit
[1:28:07] amen he's trying to tear down who you
[1:28:09] are that's not possible what is it it
[1:28:12] was Christ speaking and then it was
[1:28:15] Jesus speaking and then it was Christ
[1:28:17] speaking Jesus was the man and Christ
[1:28:20] was the god that was in him it's not me
[1:28:23] that doeth the work but the Father the
[1:28:25] dwelleth in me he does the work see well
[1:28:28] see God will not share his glory
[1:28:31] with no one
[1:28:34] God will not share his glory with no one
[1:28:36] God don't want his bride worshiping
[1:28:40] a wrench
[1:28:44] amen those that worship Him must worship
[1:28:46] Him in spirit
[1:28:47] and in truth
[1:28:49] see God will not share his glory with us
[1:28:51] so it all comes by the spirit but Jesus
[1:28:54] was virgin born and ordered in order to
[1:28:58] Tabernacle the holy spirit of God
[1:29:00] hallelujah before the foundation of the
[1:29:03] world and if it isn't Grace

[1:32:24] Revelations when he's on the island of
[1:32:26] Patmos
[1:32:29] that I was there

[1:32:37] son
[1:32:39] oh Hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus
[1:32:46] the rise I don't believe this in the
[1:32:48] overhead I believe we're finished with

[1:33:17] not another piece of clay but he took
[1:33:21] the same piece of clay the same word
[1:33:23] that Adam spoke the word
[1:33:26] he said he was masculine this is the
[1:33:29] direct quote from the prophet he was
[1:33:31] masculine and feminine spirit
[1:33:36] and he took the feminine spirit away
[1:33:38] from Adam and placed it in Eve
[1:33:41] so it's still part of Adam's spirit
[1:33:44] it's Adam's flesh
[1:33:46] so the bride must also be flesh of his
[1:33:50] flesh
[1:33:51] and bone of his bone

[1:37:33] that you torment Satan
[1:37:35] and he vibrates
[1:37:39] when you're alive when you're awake
[1:37:43] our Prophet said stuff like that
[1:37:45] he said when the smallest and weakest
[1:37:47] believer among you fall on his knees
[1:37:51] demons
[1:37:56] can you imagine if you were in a scene
[1:37:59] and here's Lucifer and he wants to send
[1:38:01] out those thousands of demons
[1:38:05] and he's in and he's doing his army
[1:38:07] organization now you're going to attack
[1:38:09] here and here and here
[1:38:11] can you imagine when he gets to his best
[1:38:13] generals
[1:38:17] and he wants to send them to your house
[1:38:20] and those generals come back to Lucifer
[1:38:23] following
[1:38:25] saying oh loose
[1:38:28] please don't send me that
[1:38:33] plea we bang him you don't send us there
[1:38:36] you don't think that happened
[1:38:38] it's happening right now this morning
[1:38:41] you don't see it it's happening our
[1:38:45] Prophet said it like this he said when
[1:38:47] the spirit felt like they were going to
[1:38:49] get delivered
[1:38:50] the other spirits in the audience would
[1:38:52] all go and pile up to try to help me he
[1:38:56] woke up
