[45:54] that
[45:55] that brother paul was speaking about was
[45:58] the righteousness of god which is the
[46:01] spirit of god
[46:04] which is the holy ghost
[46:06] brother paul said to them
[46:08] god revealed that faith to abraham
[46:14] hallelujah
[46:16] no wonder why we said it earlier that
[46:18] abraham had stayed in the presence
[46:22] of the supernatural so that's why he was
[46:25] able to get revelation
[46:28] hallelujah that's why abraham he could
[46:31] express hallelujah the mercy seat of god
[46:36] when god came down and abraham said lord
[46:40] are you going to destroy the righteous
[46:42] with the wicked
[46:44] oh my god
[46:46] god said can i hide anything from my
[46:49] friend abraham
[46:52] hallelujah i tell you when you stay in

[47:06] oh praise god but when you are not
[47:08] afraid of god he will not reveal his
[47:11] secret still
[47:12] but when god when you and god are
[47:15] friends god has to reveal his plan god
[47:18] has to reveal his secrets to you
[47:21] because he trusts you

[47:47] are you going to destroy the righteous
[47:49] with the
[47:50] wicked god intention that he was going
[47:54] to destroy sodom and gomorrah
[47:56] even remember that lot was down here
[48:00] hallelujah it's a lord
[48:04] i know that is not that
[48:06] that is nothing new to destroy the
[48:08] righteous with the wicked
[48:11] he said if you find 50 will you not save
[48:13] the city
[48:15] if you find 45 will it not save the city
[48:19] if you're flying 35 will they not save
[48:21] the city
[48:23] and they come down to five
[48:25] hallelujah
[48:29] and god hallelujah
[48:31] he brings a lot
[48:33] from out of sodom and gomorrah with lot
[48:36] and his two daughters
[48:38] his wife was supposed to come out but
[48:40] she turned back and look back hallelujah
[48:43] of the things of sodom and gomorrow when
[48:46] you're going forward keep going forward
[48:49] do not look back
[48:51] that's why brother paul said i press
[48:53] toward the mark of the price
[48:56] because the mark of the price of that
[48:58] calling of god is before me and that's
[49:01] the direction i'm going i'm pressing
[49:04] hallelujah toward the mark of the price
[49:07] and when i'm not when i'm pressing i'm
[49:09] not looking back
[49:11] all behind me are distractions
[49:16] and that's what brother paul is saying
[49:18] till we all come in the unity of the
[49:21] faith
[49:23] hallelujah
[49:24] to welcome in the unity of the faith
[49:28] and that unity of the faith is talking
[49:30] about your maturity

[50:23] hallelujah man could not see god
[50:26] because the word of god should normally
[50:28] see god and live

[50:51] god went before when god passed moses
[50:55] and put his hands over moses moses could
[50:57] not see his front part
[51:00] and then when god moved past remove his
[51:02] hands all moses could see was his back
[51:06] and moses said his back was like the
[51:08] back part of a man

[1:01:27] it was a sabbath for man
[1:01:32] hallelujah amen
[1:01:35] and as we said
[1:01:36] the last time
[1:01:39] when god
[1:01:40] the bible said he rested his works
[1:01:43] hallelujah all this works on the sixth
[1:01:46] day
[1:01:47] but on the seventh day
[1:01:50] he sanctify it the seventh day is
[1:01:52] sanctified
[1:01:54] for in hit he rested
[1:01:57] many people believe that seventh day
[1:01:59] today is speaking of sunday
[1:02:04] can a person rest inside a sunday
[1:02:08] you cannot rest it is
[1:02:10] oh my god you can't rest inside a sunday
[1:02:13] the bible said he sanctify it
[1:02:17] for in hit
[1:02:18] arrested
[1:02:20] the word in means inside
[1:02:26] you're looking at this
[1:02:28] can you can you sit down inside of this
[1:02:32] no you sit down on it
[1:02:35] isn't that right
[1:02:37] amen hallelujah
[1:02:39] so the word of god said is sanctified
[1:02:42] for in heat he rested
[1:02:44] clearly hallelujah
[1:02:46] that sabbat
[1:02:49] that day
[1:02:50] he was speaking of the image
[1:02:53] his image
[1:02:55] that was man
[1:02:57] hallelujah god step in that image
[1:03:01] hallelujah that was called adam
[1:03:04] hallelujah
[1:03:05] oh glory it was god now rested in his
[1:03:09] image
[1:03:10] for his image to continue the work of
[1:03:13] god
[1:03:16] oh praise god
[1:03:19] that's why mark 11 verse 28 said jesus
[1:03:21] said come unto me
[1:03:23] all that labor on our heavy lady and i
[1:03:26] will give you rest
[1:03:29] in other words i will give you what
[1:03:33] because the word sabbah means rest
[1:03:38] you understand
[1:03:40] hey amen
[1:03:42] hallelujah and that's the word of god
[1:03:47] brother jude
[1:03:49] his
[1:03:50] right name was actually
[1:03:52] was actually called judas
[1:03:55] but the writer didn't mention him as
[1:03:58] judas
[1:04:00] he mentioned him as jude
[1:04:04] actually there are six
[1:04:07] there are six judas in the bible
[1:04:10] hallelujah
[1:04:12] so the writer wanted to
[1:04:14] differentiate between him and judas
[1:04:16] iscariot
[1:04:18] hallelujah
[1:04:20] but jude was also the brother of james
[1:04:23] and james was the elder
[1:04:26] of the church in jerusalem
[1:04:29] hallelujah and
[1:04:31] jude and james was also the half-brother
[1:04:34] of jesus
[1:04:36] when jude wrote the letter in the book
[1:04:39] of jude he did not refer to himself as
[1:04:43] the brother of jesus he said i am a born
[1:04:46] servant
[1:04:49] i am a servant of jesus
[1:04:52] he was showing his humility
[1:04:56] hallelujah before the resurrection of
[1:04:59] jesus
[1:05:00] they did not believe
[1:05:02] in jesus
[1:05:04] jude and james did not believe in jesus
[1:05:08] it was after the resurrection of jesus
[1:05:12] they believed
[1:05:14] hallelujah
[1:05:15] and jude said in his letter
[1:05:18] he said i earnestly
[1:05:26] for the faith
[1:05:28] oh jesus
[1:05:30] hallelujah
[1:05:32] is a content for the faith
[1:05:34] the word content it means to stand for
[1:05:39] it means to block the faith
[1:05:42] hallelujah he said you must stand for
[1:05:45] the faith
[1:05:47] what was the faith that jude was
[1:05:50] speaking about
[1:05:51] hallelujah we must get back to what jude
[1:05:54] was speaking about because at that day
[1:05:58] hallelujah there was a spirit up there
[1:06:01] of error hallelujah that was sweeping
[1:06:05] its way against the truth against the
[1:06:08] gospel of christ
[1:06:11] and jude said you must contend for the
[1:06:15] spirit of truth
[1:06:19] jesus said i am the truth
[1:06:22] the way and the life
[1:06:24] the church is the truth
[1:06:28] the church is the way
[1:06:30] the church is the life
[1:06:34] hallelujah
[1:06:36] oh glory to god
[1:06:39] all that was in god it poured into
[1:06:42] christ
[1:06:43] and all that was in christ import into
[1:06:45] the church
[1:06:47] hallelujah
[1:06:48] praise god
[1:06:50] so the church reaches the body of christ
[1:06:54] they are the way
[1:06:56] hallelujah if you want to know the way
[1:06:58] to the father
[1:07:00] follow me
[1:07:04] brother paul made some strong arguments
[1:07:07] he said hallelujah follow me
[1:07:10] as i also follow christ
[1:07:13] brother paul said hallelujah if any man
[1:07:16] look at these strong arguments
[1:07:18] hallelujah
[1:07:21] if anyone preached any other gospel than
[1:07:23] this
[1:07:24] let him be a curse
[1:07:26] wow hallelujah
[1:07:29] brother paul
[1:07:31] if any man preached any other gospel
[1:07:34] this was a man
[1:07:36] hallelujah the way this arguments
[1:07:39] hallelujah it shows that he knows god
[1:07:44] hallelujah and god stands for him
[1:07:48] it's a no man can be established
[1:07:50] according to he says i establish your
[1:07:52] according to my gospel right
[1:07:56] my gospel
[1:07:58] when i look up that what does he mean by
[1:08:00] my gospel i thought the gospel was
[1:08:02] christ
[1:08:04] i thought it was christ
[1:08:07] but he was connected to christ
[1:08:10] he and christ become one
[1:08:12] so that's why i said according to my
[1:08:14] gospel
[1:08:16] hallelujah when a wife and a husband
[1:08:19] come together and they become one
[1:08:22] what belongs to the husband belongs to
[1:08:24] the wife
[1:08:28] hallelujah
[1:08:30] so that's why i can say today i'm not
[1:08:32] ashamed
[1:08:33] of the gospel of jesus christ
[1:08:37] because it is my gospel
[1:08:39] for it is the power unto salvation
[1:08:43] [Music]
[1:08:45] i'm not afraid hallelujah
[1:08:48] brother paul said oh glory to god he
[1:08:52] said
[1:08:52] no my i establish according to my gospel
[1:08:56] outside of this
[1:08:58] you can't be established
[1:09:02] thank god for the word
[1:09:05] thank god for the spirit of truth
[1:09:08] hallelujah
[1:09:10] it is your gospel
[1:09:12] the kingdom is yours
[1:09:14] it is a father's will
[1:09:16] to give you the kingdom
[1:09:22] whoa
[1:09:23] here is the father will to give you the
[1:09:25] kingdom
[1:09:26] hallelujah and the kingdom is the holy
[1:09:29] ghost
[1:09:31] brother paul said in romans 14 verse 17
[1:09:34] for the kingdom of god is neither meat
[1:09:37] nor drink but it is righteousness in the
[1:09:40] holy ghost it is peace and it is joy
[1:09:44] it is the holy ghost
[1:09:47] jesus said
[1:09:49] colossians one brother paul said he have
[1:09:51] translated us
[1:09:53] out of darkness
[1:09:55] and deliver us into the kingdom of his
[1:09:58] dear son
[1:10:02] praise god
[1:10:04] hallelujah
[1:10:08] for the perfecting of the saints
[1:10:11] the sanctify one for the perfecting of
[1:10:13] the sanctified
[1:10:15] sanctify them father to thy word because
[1:10:18] thy word is truth
[1:10:21] hallelujah
[1:10:23] that is what we're dwelling on today it
[1:10:25] is truth
[1:10:26] when we're hearing truth we're being set
[1:10:29] apart the word sanctify means to sit
[1:10:32] apart
[1:10:35] that's why
[1:10:36] jesus before you leave he said albeit
[1:10:39] when he the spirit of truth
[1:10:42] is hallelujah
[1:10:45] and that's what brother jude was
[1:10:47] speaking about content for the faith
[1:10:50] the faith which is the spirit of truth
[1:10:54] hallelujah when he the spirit of truth
[1:10:57] come he shall guide you
[1:10:59] into all truth
[1:11:02] what is against the spirit of truth

[1:11:08] religion is against the spirit of truth
[1:11:11] hallelujah people are doing so much
[1:11:14] things today hallelujah because of this
[1:11:18] because they use this and create
[1:11:21] religion
[1:11:23] and all the religion does it
