been a long time for that one thank you Jesus so many wonderful songs sometimes you just literally forget them and then a new brother Matt comes and sings a brand new song and just uh really appreciate him tonight just remember the ones that are out many many are not out by no fault of their own just uh sickness or jar 4 hours away trying to keep hoses from collapsing and and uh just remember them amen just uh let's just turn to our scripture you can have your seats we're turn to Esther Esther 2 we'll read 13 and 15 then we're going to read a scripture in Matthew Esther 2 13 and 15 and then thus came every maid unto the king what so ever whatsoever she desired was given her to go in with her out of the house of the women to the King's house and now Esther's turn came and she required nothing nothing but what the King's Chamberlain The Keeper of the women had appointed for her perfect will amen let's turn to Matthew 24 and 23 Matthew 24 and 23 and then if any man say unto you Lo here is Christ or there is Christ believe it not Hallelujah if we drop down to verse 26 therefore if they shall say unto you behold Christ is in the desert go not forth and behold if they say unto you that Christ is in the secret chamber believe it not Lord Jesus you're awesome we love you we pray that you will portray yourself to your bride this morning and a special way amen God bless you you may have your seats this morning I want to preach on or God wants to preach on a unique topic maybe Harmony Harmony between the husband and the wife in the home Harmony between the husband and the wife in the home and I would subtitle my title God knows best God knows best Hallelujah you know it's hard to understand uh omnipotent God but in this day we've been blessed with the prophet that came and revealed himself to his little bride and I just want to read a couple quotes really before I get into my text and and this is uh this is a doctrine of the church here and it's from our prophet and it's really really awesome and just you know before I Minister I want to say keep keep our visitors in prayer we went and visited with them Friday and I and I God actually showed me something uh later yesterday and I have a I have a short video on my phone of eight I believe it's eight TV evangelists that testify of the power of God in brother Brown's life the Vindicated power of God as he worked through a man and it's a great witnessing tool amen amen let's just look at what the prophet said in 64 Shalom he said the book of the year is the Bible it is the light of the world and it's God himself and our book of this year is the Bible in 1964 and our book is the Bible and all the other years to come the book will be the Bible and the years that's passed it'll be the Bible and it's been the Bible for years and it's the only book of eternity and it reveals God and yes it reveals God and every promise that is Vindicated in the Bible is eternal and the Bible is the one who gives us this promise when you hear the bible say that there's coming a day when Jesus will come again it's true amen hallelujah and in Abraham and this is an older quote in Abraham 56 he said we must go with full surrendered attitude and we must come to church and listen to the Bible and everything that's brought out of this Bible believe it and if it's not brought out of the Bible then it's up to you but the Bible is God's foundational plan it's the Plan of Redemption it's the plan of healing and everything that has come out of the Bible right here said woe unto him if he would add to or take away and I believe this Bible and I've been into churches and watch other people and lots of times in churches and watch how pastors act and he said if you'll watch a church friends friends and I say this not to be sharp in talking but I say it as a servant of Christ and to be honest to you many of times we get one another's Spirits instead of the Holy Spirit and that's the reason when you act like they act like you'll notice that the reason they act and they come to you and it's not and I know nothing but the Bible and I want you to have the spirit of the Bible and the spirit of Christ that's the reason I stay with the word of God and it's nothing but the Bible that'll bring the people out and you know we're living in a world where people are getting the spirit of the Evangelist the spirit of the Prophet hugely and the spirit of the top 10 Pastors in North America amen amen amen there's lots of people that go to big churches because I like the spirit and the delivery of the man and he can be nothing but a Genuine s that's not the man's fault as long as he's not pulling on it but we're living in a Hollywood world that would love entertainment and you know some of the greatest men in the Bible that Jesus picked couldn't write their name they were Peter was Paul was not but he said I don't come to you with my education brother Brown was uneducated had his wife read the scriptures before he preached can you imagine inviting a pastor that would come here can you imagine if I invited somebody that you didn't know like brother Zachary was talking about the pastor that could not read and right and he asked the sister of the church to come up and read the thing half of you would walk out of here that's right but your Prophet did that right cuz it's not wrong for a sister to read the Bible no amen hey we look in the scripture here in Esther it said that when all the handmaidens came that the the the the the man that was in charge of the women for the king offered the women all the luxuries of leod deia now I want you to catch on and our Prophet talks about this that they were not living in the Stone Age they had paint that we don't have today they built the pyramids that we couldn't build today and they couldn't bomb people that they couldn't bomb so I'm sure they had state-of-the-art makeup and they probably had state-of-the-art high heels and they probably had $100,000 dresses and I mean if that's even possible but stuff like that but there was one little elect lady that had different bloodline that when she went before the king she never asked for anything but what the Bible gave her and the revelation of the Bible the proper revelation of the Bible amen let's look at just a couple things and we're going to go into some examples so so you see that this this whole move of God sometimes it it sometimes it's hard for us to understand God I want to show you about six examples in the Bible where people never understood God's decision but God's will was perfect it was Harmony with the husband and the wife in the home of the world Amen here in brother Brown says and the spirit of God is not something that can you be schooled into you so if you think you can learn it by going to cemetery school or sitting under a big oak tree that's not possible it's not possible not even a smart Minister it's not something that it's or sorry it's something that's predestinated To You by The Almighty hand of God it's your experience you cannot he repeats this be schooled or taught it into you it's predestinated by God's forn knowledge into you you either just are or you aren't that's in the Satan's Eden 658 here's another one in the Rapture message also 65 the month that the prophet died he said now but the church the when they go in the Rapture it's a revelation to her when you're sitting here this morning and we talk about the bride it has to be a revelation revealed to you and it won't be a minister that gives that to you because if a minister could another Minister could take it away from you see if a man can give it to you then a better man could take it away that's right but when God spoke to Moses at the burning bus it didn't matter who came by to that church there ain't nobody going to take away the presence of that fire that was right in his midst you Cann undo something that God does he said it's revealed to her and that's the Revelation the true bride of Christ will be a revelation and waiting for the revelation of the Rapture he said and Revelation is fa and he said it was like Abraham that it was contrary to everything he believed but it was real it was impossible for old people to have a baby but it was not impossible amen hallelujah and Christ is built upon the revelation of the whole entire body amen hallelujah let's just we're just just lay a just a short Foundation here just back in our scripture we read in Matthew 24 and we just want to I always want to read a couple extra scriptures there reread the ones we read in the text but 23 and he said If any man shall say unto you Lo is Christ here or there believe it not and there shall arise false christs and false prophets and to show many signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall receive the deceive the very elect Hallelujah God help us and therefore now let me just talk about these fault you know brother Brown talked about multiple things he even talked about the states being fault because they would have Dynamic atomic bombs and power and and delight and stuff but people are attracted to big things and fancy things like if a bomb went off and there was a bright light everyone of us would look that's right cuz it was a flash yeah that's why they call it on the 401 we have a gaer Slowdown in what kind of a world that you got seven lanes and there's somebody pulled on their shoulder changing a tire does everybody got to investigate it that's right that's right amen therefore in verse 26 therefore if you shall say unto them below behold Christ is in the desert go not forth and behold he's in the secret chamber believe it not and for the lightning uhoh I remember I said bright light for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even to the West so shall the coming of the son of man be for wheresoever the food is the carcass it won't matter what kind of a scenario it's around the food the Eagles will be gathered Hallelujah the Eagles will be gathered now this is a direct quote to verse 23 for if they say Christ is over here and brother raham says this and and God keeps his word he said you know when the heaven opens up the Bible says it this way he said you know when when the Devil comes in like a flood God will raise up a standard against them brother Brown says it this way he said you know when the heaven opens up hell opens up also it's a competition to Satan it's real to God but the Satan it's a competition cuz see he's trying to imitate Christ and so everything Christ does Satan imitates and he's perfecting it to almost Perfection that's why it almost but it's not possible could deceive the elect that's and when the Bible says in the last day he's in the desert Lo he said believe it not for all these signs for he's there all these signs and wonders amen God help us believe it not because we know God is a spirit and many of the times you know when when Jesus himself came and the Son of God and Jesus was born the the church World knew it couldn't be the Son of God because he never came to the their church he never came through their pastor and a barn I mean not even a nice Barn I mean that you could have went to at least a fancy place God help us you know Matthew 12 and and and and we're going on we're just right ready to start our examples here but Matthew 12 12 3 38 and 39 it says and the certain scribes and Pharisees answered and said Master we would see a sign of you now I already have a message in my iPad to preach on this and I've had it for about a month and I'm actually if God will let me I'm going to try to save it for Easter but it's not you know we believe in all the signs and wonders in the Bible we believe in all the nine spiritual gifts we believe in the five-fold ministry which are gifts to the church and the body and there's not anything that God put in the word we're not taking it out of the word that's right nothing and I mean if anybody spoke in tongues and prophecy came forth I would be the happiest man here if you started running the aisles and walking on the back of pews I'd be the happiest man here am that normally pray happens with a lot of prayer and fasting amen normally uh God you know what what you do in secret God rewards you openly amen amen but we watch this so so we're not preaching against signs and wonders but here the the Pharisees were looking for Pacific thing and Jes and and so I'm not but Jesus answered and said unto them an evil and an adulterous generation seeks after a signs and there shall be no sign given to them but the prophet Jonas now I'm going to preach on that someday and it it's really wonderful beautiful but I want to show you the proper way of science you know a sheep don't think about growing wood wool and you in the flesh if you're praying or fasting or just waking up in the morning morning and it's a normal day you don't think about going to the kitchen table when you hear your wife or your mother cooking fresh baked uh raisin brand cookies and the aroma was going through the house you don't have to ring the doorbell you don't have to you know there was a thing that you know that back in the old days in the farms you used to ring the dinner bell you don't have to ring your dinner bell when you're baking fresh bad in the oven and it's rolling out the aroma in the yard the kids will come in like flies did you have to tell them to eat no you know there was a joke in the the old back of things when people had large large families they said how did you know everybody showed up to the table they said if something didn't show up we were glad might not be enough food to go around we just when the table was full we put the food out when it was done we it was gone somebody missed it well they wouldn't miss the next meal but the proper way so a sheep don't think I don't he don't wa up the morning say oh I'm going to grow Woolf if you're a Believer you'll have signs brother Carson just mentioned about that sister Donna told me about it yesterday you know this baby not only did that baby you know why they wanted to abort the baby the baby had fluid in his brain and it never had the drain holes to release the fluid in it sky and the parents said absolutely not under no condition God bless those parents under no condition would we we don't care what you tell us doctor we we care more what God tells us we're not aborting the baby they come back the baby said oh you know you know what the doctor said Not only was the fluid gone but they said the proper holes are there amen those are just amen now if that was your baby you would really know that there was a real God in Elijah that's right amen you and and you there would be a real God in Israel I mean sorry that's right amen you would know that that's right but if it's not your baby you might say well but signs follow a full believer but you know this this scripture is not talking about that there won't be signs in our mix but it's talking about a greater sign and and and I I I'm just going to tell you what it is and then I won't have to maybe preach that message but the greatest sign you can possibly have is the revelation of the Resurrection The Rapture that's the greatest sign of all cuz I can be healed 700 times and still get sick tomorrow but when I have a revelation of the Resurrection if this body dies and goes to the Grave or if I'm blessed enough to go in a Rapture and I have the Revelation that no matter how the Rapture happens this brother's going to be there all right and if I'm in the grave I'm still going to be there cuz there will rise first there ain't no sign and wonder that you can have better than the revelation of the resurrection and the Rapture you can take all of those nine spiritual gifts but we like them but if I choose that's the Revelation I want you know I don't need life insurance because I got a Assurance I got assurance that he'll raise me up at the end times amen my money won't do that so we look in here in First Corinthians let's go into our thing you know here the messenger the greatest messenger in the Bible and and and I say this with confidence because Paul brought Grace I mean who wants to live under the law woo buddy no thanks the greatest messenger in the Bible because he brought the message of Grace and wrote most of the New Testament God never answered his prayer so he wasn't a Believer well he never had signs in his own personal life he never had his own testimony he had to tell other people's testimonies come on help me out now don't go quiet on me and he went to Jesus three times and said take this in front of and he said let's just start at verse 7 now I I well here let's just read what I got verse one and it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory for I have come with visions and Revelations of the Lord verse 5 for such a one will I Glory yet of myself but I will not Glory but in thy infirmities verse six for though I would desire to Glory I shall not be a fo for I sayth the truth but I now I far forbear lest any man should think of me above above don't think of your pastor or the prophet above what you're supposed to Paul saying don't think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he Heth me to be for lest I shall be exalted above measure through the abundance of Revelation there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me why why in the world would God give the greatest Minister a problem lest I should be exalted uhoh that's right above the measure that God wanted me to be exalted above uhoh people would start worshiping me and I'd start walking like the kids in high school with a sway look at me verse eight and for this thing I beseech the Lord three times Thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee see for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my infirmities then the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure now this is this is crazy because God never answered my prayer whoa wait a minute yeah in the reproaches and in the necessities and in the persecution and in the distress for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong in Christ amen wow amen so here the greatest messenger in the Bible went I mean he really delivered the word of God yes wow read Romans Ephesians and all these other books that he wrote and he went to Jesus and he said God you know you're doing all these amazing things in my life oh the great greatest thing he did to Paul was would give him the revelation of not stop killing himself Christians and and become a real believer himself and and God give them all this enormous can you imagine the enormous Revelation in that day coming right out of law I wasn't an easy Road and God said he never even heard an answer from God three times why you know because in the harmony of the husband and wife in the home the wife just has the husband if he has the in this case of being God you know he was the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end and he knows what's best for the wife that's right he knows what's best for the wife he knows what's best for the family and so if God was out shopping and buying a car you know he might buy a really puddle jumper because he might know that was best for the family amen amen and so this is amazing you know we go to First Timothy 5 and here's Paul's discip that come up underneath of him Timothy and uh I want to start reading about let me see 21 I charge thee before God and before the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect of angels that thou shall observe these things without preferring one another doing nothing by but particularity that was respects to persons now now this is the man talking that had the greatest Revelation period so he said if you're two years old or you're me we're equal in Christ he said now this goes along with her you know verse 22 he said lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partakers of other men's sin and keep thyself pure now what this scripture means I got a quotee for it but if you rebuke something that God gave to a man you could be out of the will of God Amen if God gave somebody something for their perfecting yeah and you rebuked it yeah you were actually fighting God yeah like you want an example Moses when he struck the rock twice God only obeyed Moses because he was his mad but he judged Moses yes he judged Moses and said you will not see the promised land amen so lay hands quickly on nobody and drink no longer water this is Paul's advice to Timothy but use a little wine for your stomach because Our God ain't got enough power no he did have enough power to heal Timothy's stomach but it was not God's choice to heal Timothy's stomach yeah so see as the bride of Christ as the wife of we have to be careful we don't fight our husband that's right I'm bitter because you let me go through that God I'm bitter cuz you turned those people against me God I'm bitter because you did you gave me trials in that of a son to prove that I was a son that made me bitter God and you become bitter against God here's the two greatest anointed men of the day Paul and Timothy his disciple that came up as a young man and them United in prayer together could not get God to swing his decision to heal stomach ERS does brother Dale no I don't no don't ask me if I understand that no you got to take that straight to God but God allowed it in Paul's case because he knew Paul would get boastful and Rise himself up and that's what's happening in our day with the prophet people say well look at our Prophet he's a Superman no the man that was in him was the Superman brother baham said that the man that was in the man that's in you is the Superman he's called the Holy Ghost this man is Badger skin and I don't want you to see the hinder side of my Badger skin God don't even want you to see it but the man inside here now that's a whole different ball game I'll show you him front page watch here now we bring it up today you know brother Brown had a prayer request from a baby that had died in Germany and they came to but now now now brother braham's gift was the gift of healing and it was Vindicated and and came with a message and there's no signs I mean tremendous you know I mentioned that video you know on all these TV evangelist there's that many there the greatest move of God since Jesus Christ well even even including Jesus Christ was through the prophet brother Brown on this Earth amen that that's just that's just facts that don't mean we worship Him greatest move of God can be happening in your life this morning amen amen that's right God has a many member bride so here they came to brother Bram and brother Bram he knew the scriptures brother Brown knew that if God if he went to God and said heal that baby God would have healed that baby because he had been given the commission to heal the sick and raise the Dead period that's right and it was drawing attention to the the the message of Jesus Christ brother Bram understood perfectly but he was in harmony with his husband he said oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute I'm in favor you know they told they had the airplane ready he didn't have to buy a plane ticket God had supplied the means the funds I mean the engine was revving and brother B said I have to ask my husband yeah wow that's a really wise choice to do I have to ask my husband that's right and he went to God and God came back and he said that's my will that that baby's dead that's right don't touch it and brother Brown because of watch this because of maturity and understanding the word of God he called them up and he said bury your baby I'll tell you what brother brandham didn't like making that phone call no there's not one of us here would have because we have feelings we have we have affection I mean if you don't have affection I don't want to be very close to you if or feelings of any kind that's why we do kind things to one another and brother Brown had that very much so brother Brown said multiple times he said I'd heal every one of you here right now before before even but I can't do that he said bury your baby he said don't put your hand on that and don't rebuke that this what God let me just read this uh he prayed the next morning he started to the room and he said just look there and he said I stood and there was a light hanging in the door it was God and he said don't put your hand on that and don't rebuke that that's the hand of God and brother bam gives the example of 1 Timothy 5:22 lay no hand suddenly on no man God might be teaching them right the lesson of the rod and the strap yeah amen you know there's another example in 2 Kings 21-18 and I'm not going to read that all but that's just the story in 2 Kings 20 1:18 and it was King Hezekiah and he got sick unto death and the prophet Isaiah came to him now I'm just paraphrasing it's that's where you can find it and he said get your house in order you're going to die and God you know they say preach a message can God ever change his mind and the King went to God and he said you know God I've done everything you told me to do he was a he was a Believer he was a message believer he had tore down Idols he brought the sacrifice back in Israel he had done fantastic things and he said God I can't get my house in order that quick and God why are you doing this to me cuz let's make it personal say God you know what's going to happen to the church right or what what's going to happen to my family God he was asking God all he said God did I do something wrong do do is there a hidden sin in my life is there something I didn't repent for God haven't I done this and that wasn't that your will God and he touched the string of God's heart and God turned the prophet around and he sent him back and he said I'll give you 15 years and watch what the prophet said about that during that time King Hezekiah backslid and he would have been better off if he would have went when God had commanded it than getting the permissive will of God and having 15 more years and God this is you know some things happen that you oh man I I I kind of didn't like this part there's sometimes you Minister things you don't like and God could have laid the sin on the king's thing but he waited till he died a backsliding Christian and he put all the dues on his kids wow and he said but he stayed a little while and you see he held off the he held off the the what's the word for the sin he he held off the punishment for his sin until he was gone and he gave it to his children wow you know death or God's plan is not a bad thing I mean of course it's easy for us to say we know God's plan is not a bad thing but in this case death would have been a blessing his Kings his sons would have went right on reign in the thing he lost his whole Kingdom the whole church the whole everything went into slavery because he thought he was the only one that could be the pastor well he told God like what's going to happen they're going to bring Idols back in here and they're going to they're going to take the sacrifice down and amen that's what your Prophet said in 63 God doesn't call a man without to judgment without first warning him yes God gave the king his desire at the punishment of his family and him being backslid wow you know we see another example here where Jesus went to the pool and in John 5:3 it says and there laid a great multitude John 53 and there laid a great multitude of in imported like sick people imported folks now I'm just naive enough to believe that there was a lot of sick people great I mean we don't know the number but that's a lot more than a handful withered and waiting for the moving of the spirit of God the water which was the spirit of God the spirit of God came down and moved the water and one would be healed and Jesus walked in I I mentioned this before probably because this anointing was coming down on this and Jesus stepped over the sick people yeah and walked over to one man so he stepped over me my family and maybe even our church and he went over here and he went over there and he walked over to different church or different Ministry and I was sitting there and I was really withered but I was getting my hand ready I wanted to trip them I mean this actually happen yes he had the opportunity to come and speak for me but he went and spoke for somebody else something was like never came preach in our church never came to our pool they never invited me never healed my child Spirits don't die every one of those people had those spirits and Jesus healed one now you know you know the the prophet said this you know he said when when uh John's friend died there in the grave uh who was that uh was in the grave and Jesus called him forth brother Brown said you know if he hadn't called his name that's right every resurrected Christian would have came forth would have been the general Resurrection right then yes it would it wouldn't have been 1 o more effort for Jesus to heal all those laying around that pool than to heal one I just got a simple question for you how could that have been God's will don't ask me harmony harmony with your husband Harmony I praise God in the in the flesh you know can I give you a a light thing I praise God In the Flesh I wasn't born a lady I oh man you know I think of my wife and all the stupid decisions oh when I bought the fourth thing in a row and had 15 payment I say oh god oh she's probably thinking oh I wish I wasn't tied to the law harmony harmony with your spiritual husband you know if we were honest to ourself and if God answered every single prayer in a miracle now healing is different cuz it can be a process yes Noah was healed this week I mean he had a wild temperature 1004 something he was he was matter of fact I I like no would have died if he hadn't got better yeah when D text the land and said no and Jeff we feeling better I actually started crying and that boy was I mean he he was going the wrong way fast that was a healing but if everybody that walked up to here in America was like that there's not a human alive that that wouldn't affect that's why Jesus gave but Paul an infirmity because well just because cuz God knew he couldn't take it and stay humble and so is it was if you're breathing this morning if if you make your and if everything falls at your command just it's done it's done can you imag you'll turn out like that Kim guy in the North Korea crazy guy huh amen God help us see God knows best what's best for us here in Isa Isaiah 5589 he says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my our ways your ways my ways sayeth the Lord Isaiah 55:9 for as the heaven is higher than the earth so are my ways so much higher than brother Dale's way and my thoughts so much higher than your thoughts Psalms 103 same scripture Psalms 10311 for as the heaven is high above the Earth so great is the mystery Mercy sorry towards them that have Harmony with her husband fear is respect respect amen you know if we would have been back in the day like and all the people that were and I mean if you would have been back in the day of brother bram's Ministry there wasn't one person alive in the message in that was glad that brother brandham had a car accident I'm not I wasn't either I'm just saying but God was he said precious are the deaths of the Saints in my eyes and all the saints were like God you made a mistake that's my man that's my prophet he yeah I mean how he revealed the seals to me which the seals are Christ actually the brother bam said that Christ revealed the seals which was himself he used brother Brown's mouth that's right he revealed all the Mysteries like Amos 3:7 amen brother Brown did well no brother God did through brother Brown's mouth he revealed The Mystery of the white horse rider and water baptism and no Eternal Howell and and you have you always were Eternal praise God for that one predestination woo amen amen and there wasn't one person that said God you made the right decision taking them off the scen no that's right cuz they went in total complete chaos it was like w what did you just do God yeah let's vote on it wow once more just once more the prophet said in 63 he said when you think your thoughts then God's thoughts don't have a chance uhoh wow if it's brother Dale that I'm ministering run for your life you're in the wrong Church you are but that's only a revelation that God can give you whether it's brother Dale's thoughts or if it's the holy spirit's thoughts if brother Dale from education put this together in the skill of being a professor put all these lined up and it was just perfect I'd be nervous but if you had a person that didn't have a clue what end was right and left and God just went and line them all up right maybe you might want to brother Bram said that and one just once more it's also a 6312 quote and queen of the Sheba 61 he said his ways are all always higher in our ways and so we must submit ourselves to his ways amen he he's infinite he's in you know just so much above our thoughts and so you know it's just good that we we understand that we need to be for us to have a revelation we got to be in harmony with our husband Christ Christ that that's it you know the prophet said this in the perous church age he said you know uh he compared John 5:19 where Jesus said I do nothing until the father show me and he said now I'm I'm starting right there he said now this harmony now exists between the groom and the bride and he shows her his word of life and she receives it and she never doubts it therefore there's nothing can harm her not even death that means if I'm dead before next Sunday you just carry on don't definitely don't cry for me I won't have to fix the furnace I mean I'll be like woo here's the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary and the bride has the mind of Christ and she knows what he wants done with the word and performs that commandment of the word in his name and she has thus sayith the Lord when the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass and now these in the bride do only his will and no one can take them to do otherwise I can't tempt you or persuade you or bribe you or pay you or nothing to leave the word of Christ regardless Hallelujah and they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still and they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word and he did not complete all his work while he was here in his Earth Ministry brother Brown saying Jesus did not fulfill the prophecy of the Bible in his own life when he was on Earth and he is continuing that today in you in you wow what a privilege we have to fulfill the word of God but in that privilege see Jesus never qu question the father I mean I know they were one but he he look at the harmony brother Braham said it was the harmony of John 5:19 I not doing nothing but what my father is that's right I ain't doing nothing to what my husband isn't now I understand my husband really well I don't need to understand him by education and lining up all the quotes I just I've met him in person amen amen hallelujah you know when you look at and just in closing here just my last scripture just and I I I just got a few things after this but I want to ask you a question but you know my last here you know when we look at the Father's prayer when the disciples came to him and said teach us how to pray you know when you look at the Lord's Prayer the beginning of the Lord's Prayer is worship yes and then it's accepting his Harmony that's how we're to pray say our father that's relationship Hallowed be thy name that's worship now it's your kingdom and it's your will in my life it's Harmony obedience to the husband right and if there's not Harmony this is the thing if there's not Harmony then there's bitterness period the thing that comes right after the decision of I'm not going to be in harmony is I'm bitter to the decision you made that's right that's the very next thing and they're that far apart oh yes I didn't like that God I didn't like that at all wow in closing I have a question for you and I have no opinion of how you will answer it won't affect me at all it's not this is a question for yourself so I'm not trying to cram this down your throat please don't feel that way I'm going to show you some things that the prophet said but I have a question for you did the or our God you know cuz this question could be to non-believer did the god or our God the Alpha and Omega now remember this is a question this is only a question I'm going to lose you I know I'm I'm I'm going right out the limb is too small for my weight that the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end need the Internet the worldwide web to perfect the bride by listening to ministers around the world and if you would say or think yes then why didn't God wait for the internet until the messenger to the age came to bring Christ now the worldwide web this is just a question this is just a question you know earlier in the message I didn't have the answer don't ask me don't ask me this question please don't ask me this question after so don't ask me we used to teach that to our kids people go to church say what' your dad buy what' your dad sell what did he plant said don't ask me I asked him the worldwide web was first created in 1969 after the prophet died and it was just between computers and then in 1983 the US defense data produced the worldwide web only between their computers for the Armed Forces of United States of America 1983 I'm just giving you information to help you make up your decision but not until April 30th 1993 remember it wasn't even in the Army until 83 and brother brandham thought that the thought I remember only thought he mentioned he couldn't see how we could survive past 19 1970 that was I know it wasn't a it wasn't a prophecy I know that was just a thought so in brother bram's thought pattern the bride would have been he he thought he thought because of the world's wickedness she could never survive past 1970 and and believe me he was right but to go along with that then the he would have thought the bride was perfected to be gone in April 1930 or April 30th 1993 was the worldwide web released to the public and then and only then could God's message go to his bride to perfect them that's why you can go home and listen to ministers every day of the week all day long all over the world and that's going to help you go in a Rapture because God couldn't do it with your home church and your pastor and the five-fold ministry that comes through this building so like in Luther's age there's going to be a really small bride cuz they never had the internet and in Wesley's age when he was riding his horse and it went in a hole and he got off and prayed for the broken leg and went on riding the horse cuz it was broken well there won't be very many bride there cuz cuz he was just riding a horse he never even had a Lincoln to drive around preaching I mean maybe it was a Lincoln horse but and then in brother bram's day was right after the Great Depression and they had the model A's and the model T's and you know you're young kids you don't know what it was like when we had a racetrack you come to the stop sign you have one foot in The Brak and you'd flutter the gas pedal on the other one and you'd have and if it flooded you had a clothes pin you put in the flood thing that and the fire would come out of the thing you know because you had a carburetor and God there's no no way God could have perfected a bride with a carburetor engine in the ministry cuz it wasn't a worldwide web then maybe and then if men say unto you that Christ is over here in this church because he's got a great ministry and I listen to it in the web that's right that's right on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday and it's a lot more qualified than my fat Pastor in Wyoming or in wherever I'm believe me this is just this ain't me this is what God then we are going to be a good big bride we're going to be a good big bride in this last age after April 30th 1993 and there's going to be the largest part of the Rapture happened with those that are alive and remain because of the worldwide web now Satan considered it the web like a spider web that you would get caught in like a snare in the Bible and it would take you on a Wes y ouch don't believe it if he's in the secret chamber or in a different place because you would if you would if your answer don't please don't tell me if your answer would be yes to this question and it's okay if it is it's perfectly okay then you have to believe that God is Not omnipotent and you have you cannot believe the scripture that God spoke through a donkey to a prophet oh oh that one hurt and that no matter what great ministry around the world was preaching that they're coming under the cstone of the head and if God wants it here he could send it through a donkey even a fat Pastor or anyone even in a building that ain't sighted yet and looks really decrepid outside I just want to go back to Esther 213 and Esther re or required Esther 215 well 13 she had all the options to listen to the worldwide web to the greatest Ministry around the world yes yes yes and she said no thanks that's I'm going before my priest I don't want to be scarred by all their garbage that's right or even truth or even truth amen oh listen I M of those a huge percentage of those men they could come and preach here and I would just be glad to sit down yes even truth yes but Esther said that a nipotent god placed me in my family in this now listen in this terrible cold snowy place where I would rather be in El Salvador for a reason so if you would say that God needed the worldwide web to perfect you in the re now remember that we said that we read the quote earlier in the service I don't go to the top of my notes that you can't be schooled this in you can't be taught this by any minister no matter how well he puts the scriptures together it's a predestinated revelation Esther required nothing let me give you some things and I'm going to close on what the prophet said you know on he said the earthquake in India he said if God could speak to the animals when the educated smart weather people didn't know there was an earthquake coming and say leave the rock fences and leave the rock buildings a Beast hello amen cattle ducks and they knew not to come back to the Rock thing because they were connected with their father not to come to the rocks that it was going to hurt them no no no no brother Dale they had seen that on the internet how much more could God tell the bride of Christ through your local home church if you believe if you believe that there's a five-fold Ministry going through this place now that's not a oneman Ministry watch while tell said that very clearly if you believe there's a regular diet of fivefold ministry that's right if you believe that now I'll tell you what a regular diet of five-fold ministry is the ties of the ties that's what a regular diet is hello the ties to the ministry is to the th to the ministers a levite pays thigh to a levite that's how many fivefold Ministry we have through whatever the ties if you want to see more fivefold Ministry through load up your ties we'll load up the fivefold ministry cuz it comes right from the ties watch what the prophet said he said this is in the end time evangelist of 62 he said but since God made man he redeemed man and he's been speaking through man and does not use any me agency of any mechanical device the worldwide with in 1963 perfecting of Faith now we're getting closer to the greatest Revelation before God pulls him off he said now then you hear this thus saith the Lord see because it's not Beyond human thinking it's up to the realm of God's thinking but you stand here and you just Branch producing fruit of the vine and God uses man and only man remember he said thus says the Lord and God does not use Machinery God doesn't use even a group of men God doesn't use an organization God uses an individual always that's right and perfecting 63825 perfect faith in the evening time and in conference in 60 he said now we are not divided the devil tries to divide Us by Mechanical Devices uhoh God is not the author of confusion that's brother brandham said your pastor holds the doctrine for the church and he said if you come to me I'll send you to your pastor that's right because he is the doctrine for the body he said he's the one that's LED you this far and he will lead you all the way and your pastor will be the one that'll stand there when his group that he's responsible for goes through so will the prophet when the age comes through amen I have a spoused you Amen to the husband not to the Lang staff to the husband right wow now in Hebrews 12 it says that if you can't take chastisement you're not even his that's right amen amen God help us God help us it's a question that every individual will have to ask does God need the help you know television was here when brother Brown's Ministry was here do you know the brother Brown said that God created television or allowed it to be created for his purpose and Satan oh yeah oh yes Twisted it and your Prophet never preached on public television I don't believe today our message that brother Brown would believe I didn't I don't believe that brother Brown would believe and I don't believe that God of brother Brown would believe that the message needs the help of the worldwide web for perfecting but what Satan has done is he has Twisted it yes for your confusion let's stand yes let's stand Hallelujah let's sing that song brother Matt saying father we
