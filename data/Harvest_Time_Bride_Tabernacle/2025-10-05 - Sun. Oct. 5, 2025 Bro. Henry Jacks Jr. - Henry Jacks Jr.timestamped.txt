[30:19] the earth, and over every creeping thing
[30:23] that creepeth upon the church. The
[30:26] prophets say like this that was a mature
[30:29] god.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Meaning a lesser God,
[30:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[30:32] &gt;&gt; You can be seated as as we ask the Lord
[30:35] to have his blessing to his word.
[30:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah Jesus.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Man was a mature God.
[30:41] He was given with dominion to rule over
[30:44] the earth but not over heaven.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:52] And but here when God make man in his
[30:55] image,
[30:57] this man was a spirit man.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He didn't have any flesh.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:04] &gt;&gt; Because God was a spirit as the Bible
[31:08] said in St. John 4:4, "For God is a
[31:12] spirit."
[31:13] &gt;&gt; So God made man in the spirit man.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; Right. Yes, sir. But here was man upon
[31:20] the earth.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; But man didn't have any body.
[31:24] Hallelujah.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; He was just a spirit man.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; And God gave him dominion over the
[31:31] things of the earth, over every creeping
[31:34] thing upon the earth.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:37] &gt;&gt; But in order to man to rule.
[31:41] Yes, sir.
[31:42] &gt;&gt; Remember there are natural things upon
[31:44] the earth.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; So God had to put him in a natural body
[31:51] to rule.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; In Genesis 2 verse 7,
[32:00] the Bible said, "And the Lord God
[32:05] formed man of the dust of the ground
[32:11] &gt;&gt; and breathed into his nostrils
[32:14] &gt;&gt; the breath of life. Amen.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; And man became a living soul.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; So now the man God put him into a body.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Verse eight. And the Lord God planted
[32:37] a garden eastward in Eden.
[32:41] And there he put the man whom he had
[32:44] talked.
[32:46] The man didn't just go into the garden.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; No.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; It was the Lord God.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Who took the man and put him in the
[32:56] garden.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:58] Amen.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; We didn't just come into this body,
[33:02] right?
[33:03] It takes God, hallelujah, to baptize us
[33:07] &gt;&gt; into the body of Christ.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; This word planted, it doesn't mean to
[33:15] dig a hole and put in a seed. It means
[33:19] to be established,
[33:20] &gt;&gt; right? Yes.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; God establish, hallelujah, a garden,
[33:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[33:27] &gt;&gt; And this gar, hallelujah. Praise God.
[33:31] Hallelujah.
[33:31] &gt;&gt; The topic this morning is restoring
[33:35] the kingdom's atmosphere.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Restoring the kingdom atmosphere
[33:44] &gt;&gt; and laying a foundation for you to
[33:47] understand. Hallelujah. What Adam had in
[33:51] the beginning.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; Right. Oh yeah.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Because the word restore, it means to
[33:57] bring back to its original place.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; It means to put back.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; And
[34:08] the word Eden,
[34:11] it's not a literal place.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; That's why archaeology cannot find this
[34:18] place.
[34:20] &gt;&gt; It's a dimension.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; It's an atmosphere.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:28] Bethlehem is a literal place,
[34:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; Nine is a literal place.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Jericho is a literal place. That's why
[34:40] they can find it.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; But he is not a literal place.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; That's why no archaeology can find it.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; And it was God. Hallelujah.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Who established that
[34:55] &gt;&gt; dimension.
[34:58] But here, hallelujah
[35:00] was the man. Glory to God. So God, he
[35:05] established Pet
[35:08] &gt;&gt; and he put the man.
[35:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; In the garden. So God put us in his
[35:17] presence.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Because the word he means God's
[35:24] presence. Right.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; So you were created,
[35:29] you were established to be in his
[35:33] presence.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen?
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; You were made
[35:49] &gt;&gt; to be in his presence. Amen.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; So that's why the spirit of God, it
[35:55] needs the atmosphere.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Your spirit, it needs the heavenly
[36:01] atmosphere.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But your physical body, it
[36:07] needs the hurt atmosphere.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Right?
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; The word atmosphere it means the
[36:18] envelope of gases
[36:20] surrounding the earth or another planet.
[36:25] Listen to the meaning. Hallelujah.
[36:30] And it also means atmosphere. It means a
[36:35] character.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; Your character carries an atmosphere.
[36:42] Right.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Let's go a little bit further here. It
[36:48] also means a feeling.
[36:51] You can carry certain feeling and that
[36:54] feeling creates an atmosphere.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; So your energy that is coming from you,
[37:02] &gt;&gt; it gives off an atmosphere.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Right? Sometimes that energy,
[37:07] hallelujah, that is coming from you, it
[37:09] may not give the right atmosphere.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; That's why some people might say, I
[37:16] don't know what the I don't know what it
[37:17] is,
[37:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[37:18] &gt;&gt; But I just can't be in that person
[37:21] atmosphere,
[37:22] &gt;&gt; because of the energy
[37:24] &gt;&gt; that the person gives off,
[37:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; We're getting somewhere. Amen.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; It means a mood of a place.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:40] &gt;&gt; You can one day said, "Okay, then we're
[37:42] going to go to a restaurant."
[37:45] Hallelujah.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; And then when you go to that restaurant,
[37:50] probably that place that you go to, it
[37:52] creates such a warm atmosphere.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; That every time you just want to dine in
[37:59] that restaurant,
[38:00] &gt;&gt; right? But if that place doesn't create
[38:03] the atmosphere, you're not going to want
[38:05] to go there anymore.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:09] &gt;&gt; What about what about the kingdom of
[38:12] God?
[38:14] &gt;&gt; What about the kingdom of God?
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; You know the Bible said, hallelujah. In
[38:25] Psalms 139 verse4,
[38:29] I will praise thee.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; For I am
[38:35] &gt;&gt; fearfully
[38:37] &gt;&gt; and wonderfully made.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; Marvelous
[38:43] &gt;&gt; are thy works
[38:45] &gt;&gt; that my soul knoweth right way.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; When God made you.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[38:56] When the God made you, what does he made
[38:58] you? He made you into his image.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; That's why you are fearfully
[39:09] and wonderfully in him.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:20] So the image of God, it carries
[39:24] an atmosphere.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; And that atmosphere, it must project the
[39:32] attributes of God.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; And once it project the attributes of
[39:37] God. Hallelujah. People is going to want
[39:41] to come into that atmosphere
[39:44] &gt;&gt; because there's something about you,
[39:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[39:47] &gt;&gt; There's something about your spirit.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As the word said, the deep
[39:52] call it and to the deep
[39:55] &gt;&gt; and the noise of the water spots.
[39:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Eden,
[40:06] it is said that Eden is made up of five
[40:10] strokes.
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:15] It is made up of five strokes. Eden
[40:18] &gt;&gt; in the Hebrew, right?
[40:20] These five strokes it means spot.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; It means moment,
[40:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:30] &gt;&gt; It means an open door.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; When God placed the man in heeden, the
[40:41] man was enjoying an open door. Right.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; The man was enjoying a spot with the
[40:50] father.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? Having fellowship.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Right, sir.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was enjoying a moment
[41:02] &gt;&gt; because he was having fellowship with
[41:04] the father.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Right.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; It means
[41:11] access.
[41:13] No wonder why the Bible said,
[41:15] hallelujah, Jesus is the beloved son
[41:19] whom we have access with the father.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; That's why I said no man can come to the
[41:25] father but by me.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You want access to the
[41:30] father, you got to come through me.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; It means presence.
[41:39] I wonder why the Bible said in his
[41:41] presence there is fullness of joy.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; And at his right hand there are
[41:48] pleasures forever more because of the
[41:51] heavenly atmosphere.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; But here Adam had that in the beginning.
[42:07] He had all the power of God.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; God gave him the power. Hallelujah.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; He It was the light. It was God's
[42:18] delight.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; But then when sin came. Hallelujah.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; And it took him away from that
[42:30] &gt;&gt; man lost its way.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; They lost his way.
[42:37] Then God had to come down and said, "You
[42:42] know what?
[42:43] I'm going to guard the way."
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Right?
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; I'm going to guard the way. He wasn't
[42:52] guarding the tree.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; He was guarding the way to the tree.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Right.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Follow me now. I'm going somewhere with
[43:01] this.
[43:03] The Bible said he put cherubims,
[43:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Cherubims,
[43:09] more than one,
[43:11] &gt;&gt; not singular, but plural.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; I'm quoting Genesis 3:4.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:21] Glory. The Bible says, "So he drove out
[43:24] the man,
[43:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:26] And he placed on the east of the garden
[43:30] of Eden cherubams.
[43:32] The cherubams represents guard.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; They are guards,
[43:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at it. God placed
[43:43] guards
[43:45] and a flaming sword.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; What is that? That is the Holy Ghost.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; The word flaming it means hallelujah.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It means something that is
[44:03] burning
[44:05] or consuming.
[44:08] Sword represents the word of God.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible said in Revelation
[44:15] 1, hallelujah, he had a sword. That is
[44:18] the word of God. In Revelation 19:15, he
[44:23] said, "There was a sword that shot
[44:25] toward the sword that went out of his
[44:27] mouth, which is the word of God."
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[44:31] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is the word.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; And the spirit and the word is the Holy
[44:37] Ghost,
[44:37] &gt;&gt; right? Yes, sir.
[44:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; And it was guarding the way to the tree
[44:43] of life.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Right.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But in order to to have
[44:48] access to the tree of life, you have to
[44:52] go through the guard,
[44:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; You have to approach the guard,
[45:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[45:04] &gt;&gt; God, hallelujah, was restoring back a
[45:08] healing again upon the hurt.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[45:14] And here
[45:19] just to understand something
[45:22] in the message the greatest battle ever
[45:24] fought
[45:26] Satan's army brings diseases
[45:29] &gt;&gt; right
[45:31] &gt;&gt; and God's army
[45:34] &gt;&gt; is commissioned to cast them out
[45:40] &gt;&gt; there you are
[45:42] &gt;&gt; every Every time Satan throws anything
[45:45] unto you,
[45:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; God's army is to cast him out,
[45:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[45:52] &gt;&gt; You hear that?
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Because God equip you.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; God give you the character.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; God give you his power.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, God." That's the very
[46:09] technique that God used. Satan use the
[46:14] harmony of destruction to believe to
[46:17] disbelieve God's word.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; So what is the tactic of Satan is
[46:24] disbelieve.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Right. Yes.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, did somebody catch that?
[46:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The tactics of Satan is
[46:36] disbelief.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the devil has anointed people
[46:41] to disbelieve the word.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; That's why there's so much problem today
[46:47] in the world and in the churches because
[46:50] of disbelief.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and he set up a better
[47:07] kingdom than Michael had and God cast
[47:12] him out. God's method is cast out the
[47:16] evil,
[47:18] cast down reasoning, cast down
[47:21] superstition.
[47:23] So what is God's method is to cast down
[47:26] it.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Cast down the reason. Cast down
[47:30] superstition because you believe,
[47:32] &gt;&gt; right? Yeah,
[47:35] &gt;&gt; you believe the word
[47:37] &gt;&gt; and because you believe the word, it
[47:39] will anoint you with power.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "I have gi you
[47:45] power."
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To tread down serpents.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You are above it. You are
[47:59] above sin. You are above worry. You're
[48:02] not supposed to worry.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; That's the tactics of the devil.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; You are above worry.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; At times when you feel a little feeling
[48:12] of worry come upon you, it's the devil
[48:15] that has anointed upon you. You are
[48:18] above it. You must tell yourself,
[48:20] hallelujah. And shake it off.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I am above this warrior.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; I am above it. I am resurrected in Jesus
[48:30] Christ.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Yeah.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; You know, saints,
[48:37] this is my testimony.
[48:41] You know, months,
[48:44] months, probably about two months.
[48:48] My wife,
[48:50] she has been going through a phase, a
[48:53] season.
[48:55] And
[48:57] you know I was there
[48:59] and the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said
[49:04] call her and I said stop allowing the
[49:07] devil to kick you around like some
[49:09] football
[49:10] &gt;&gt; right
[49:11] &gt;&gt; rise up above this
[49:14] &gt;&gt; stop your worry
[49:15] &gt;&gt; right

[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; You know that you are the daughter of
[1:02:40] God. You know that you are the son of

[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Who told you that you're not a son of
[1:04:19] God?
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Who told you that you're not healed?
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Who told you that you are miserable? Who
[1:04:26] told you that you're poor?

[1:04:54] rising."
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; If he see that stress comes on, he said,
[1:04:59] "I I have joy.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Unspeakable joy."
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; That's the faith Abraham produced.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. When he look at Sarah,
[1:05:11] people were saying that he could not
[1:05:13] produce. Well, Abraham said, "My wife is
[1:05:15] going to produce
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; because God said it and I believe it.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Though she's growing up in age, I still

[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; I still believe his word."
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Restoring back the kingdom's
[1:05:38] atmosphere.
[1:05:40] In Ephesians 2:10,
[1:05:43] he said, "For we are his workmanship."
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; I like that word. You can underline that
[1:05:51] word in your Bible. Workmanship,
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; That's three word,
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Three word. Work. If you break it down,
[1:06:01] break it up. Workmanship,
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; right? Yes.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said we are his
[1:06:09] workmanship.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Right. All right. Yes sir.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; What is work?
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Work is your responsibility.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; So don't mis don't misunderstand between
[1:06:20] job and work.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Job is different from work.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Right. Yes.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; A job is when you work for wages to be
[1:06:28] get paid.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; Servants only do job
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; but sons work.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:36] The Bible said, hallelujah, a servant
[1:06:39] doesn't abide in the house forever, but
[1:06:42] a son abideth.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "The father work, so the son
[1:06:47] work."
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. When you work is your
[1:06:57] responsibility,
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; It is your purpose.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; It is your duty. God said to Adam,
[1:07:04] "Dress and to keep it." What was Adam
[1:07:08] responsibility? That was work. That was
[1:07:11] the first assignment that God made to
[1:07:14] Adam
[1:07:16] was to dress and to keep it. When God
[1:07:19] called you, your purpose is to dress
[1:07:22] your family.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Is to keep your family.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; Is to dress your home.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; Is to keep your home.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Is to dress your fellowship. Is to keep
[1:07:33] your fellowship.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:45] For we are his workmanship.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Created. Hallelujah. See that word
[1:07:52] again, created
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; You see where you're created,
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; So when you come
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not coming in anybody's
[1:08:05] name.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; I'm coming in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:10] Christ.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; They ask a question, David.
[1:08:17] Hallelujah. Where you Who you going
[1:08:19] into? I'm going in the name of the Lord
[1:08:23] God.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Created in Jesus Christ unto good works.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; You see the works again?
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Workmanship,
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Created unto good works.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.

[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Because we're still under the topic
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; the restor the restoring of the
[1:08:57] atmosphere of the kingdom. The
[1:09:00] atmosphere that you carry that you
[1:09:02] produce
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; must be the same atmosphere of Jesus
[1:09:07] Christ.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:11] good works which God had before ordained
[1:09:16] that we should walk in them.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; So God ordained this a long time.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; So when Adam was in the garden, you were
[1:09:27] there,
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Turn your Bibles to
[1:09:39] second Peter 1.
[1:09:41] We're going to look at the good works.
[1:09:45] Hallelujah.
[1:09:48] Do you love him this morning?
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God doesn't make mistake.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; God doesn't make mistake.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; God knows exactly what he's doing.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Let me say this. If you're going through
[1:10:07] a situation
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; and you feel like that, you know,
[1:10:11] deserve to go through this, don't
[1:10:13] question God.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Don't question him.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what he's doing.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; You think the the children of Israel,
[1:10:25] they had to go by the Red Sea? They
[1:10:27] didn't have to go by the Red Sea. No.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; But it was God ordained it.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Right. Yes, sir.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; It was God ordained it.
[1:10:36] Sometime God ordain things even sickness
[1:10:39] in your life. You know the reason why he
[1:10:41] ordain it?
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; It must be for his glory.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; He must get the glory out of everything
[1:10:48] that you're doing.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:13:27] out of me," it means strength.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David said, "The Lord is my

[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know sometimes
[1:18:08] you know the love of God is not
[1:18:11] conditional.

[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; The love of God is not conditional.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[1:18:27] You know the Bible said
[1:18:32] that God is love,
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; He said for no man
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; at laying down his life
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; but because of the love no greater love
[1:18:46] than a man have
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; but to lay down his life for his
[1:18:49] friends.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; That love was sacrificial. Sometimes the

[1:19:16] time.

[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; They need your time and attention.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; There you go.

[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Let's get that scripture out of the way.
[1:20:31] Isaiah 43:7,
[1:20:34] he said, "Even everyone that is called
[1:20:37] by my name,
[1:20:40] for I have created him for my glory."
[1:20:44] Right.

[1:21:33] Galatian 5
[1:21:37] verse 22.
[1:21:40] The prophet said in a message
[1:21:43] that the manifest the manifestation of
[1:21:46] the spirit is the promised word.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; You get that?
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; He said the manifestation of the spirit
[1:21:56] is the promised word.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. Galatians 5:22.
[1:22:04] But the fruit, you know why I said the
[1:22:07] manifestation?
[1:22:09] Because this has to be manifest.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; You cannot hide love.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; No. No.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; You cannot conceal joy.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; No. No.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; You cannot conceal peace.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; No way.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; It must be manifest.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Why? He said it is a promised word.
[1:22:33] Because it is Christ,
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; right? It is Christ and Christ is the
[1:22:38] promised word.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:43] Glory.
[1:22:45] But the fruit of the spirit is love.
[1:22:49] Talking about good works now,
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Love
[1:22:57] unconditional
[1:23:00] without reasoning. Anything that have
[1:23:03] condition as reason. Right?
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Reason they have expectation
[1:23:08] and this is the problem with persons
[1:23:11] that are married these days.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because the love that they
[1:23:15] have for their one another is a
[1:23:17] conditional love.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; So they're expecting Hallelujah. their
[1:23:22] spouse to be so perfect.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To be so perfect.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. And then when the spouse
[1:23:30] display certain behavior,
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; they start to wonder, they start to
[1:23:36] doubt,
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Is really God giving me you,
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Is really God giving me you.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Because your love is based on
[1:23:45] expectation.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; I'm expecting this from you.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; But God love is not based upon
[1:23:53] expectation.
[1:23:55] [Applause]
[1:23:57] Hallelujah.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:04] Praise God.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Joy,
[1:24:09] peace, longsuffering,
[1:24:12] gentleness,
[1:24:14] goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Against such there is no law.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; We should be shouting hallelujah.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; We should be shouting hallelujah.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Your works. I want to see some joy.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; I want to see some peace.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; I want to see some longsuffering.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; I want to see some temperance. Where is
[1:24:44] the long suffering today?
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Where is the joy today? When you come to
[1:24:50] fellowship, you must have joy.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; And speak of joy.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you come together, I
[1:24:58] want to see some temperance.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; I want to see some love. I want to see
[1:25:03] some peace.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Restoring back the atmosphere of the
[1:25:12] kingdom of God
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; right here on earth.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know that the prophet
[1:25:19] said this is Satan's Eden.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, sir.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; He said in God's heing, God performed an
[1:25:27] operation
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; and he took them the woman.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; He took a rib out of the man
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; and bring him through the man. I said,
[1:25:37] "You're now bone of my bones.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; You're my flesh of my flesh."
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; And now we're in Satan's Eden. And God
[1:25:47] is performing an operation again.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:54] When they had him on the cross.
[1:25:57] Hallelujah. Someone was anointed
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; to use the spear to pierce his side.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when the side was
[1:26:06] pierced, something came out.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; You know what came out? You came out.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:26:15] Hallelujah.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.

[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; to represents me
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; to be my character
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; to produce my attribute. Because all
[1:26:31] that was in God, he poured into Christ.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; And all that was in Christ, he poured
[1:26:37] into the church.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; She's my glory.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:44] She's my glory.

[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Wow. What a tremendous, tremendous
[1:34:40] message. Oh, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:34:44] Thank you.
[1:34:46] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:34:48] Hallelujah. You know, Brother Junior,
[1:34:50] when he was ministering, just the Holy
[1:34:52] Spirit just brought something to me. You
[1:34:54] know, Satan's tactics never changed. He
[1:34:56] came to Jesus when he tempted him and he
[1:34:59] said, "If you be the son of God, you
[1:35:02] know, God's never said that to one of
[1:35:03] his."
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; God's never said that to one of his
[1:35:08] children.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Anytime somebody comes and says, "Well,
[1:35:12] if you're a Christian,
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; you wouldn't have made that mistake."
[1:35:15] God never ever said that to anybody.
[1:35:17] Jesus.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; God knew we would make mistakes.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; God knew we would fall down.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; When they hung Jesus on the cross and
[1:35:24] the soldiers were speaking, Satan was
[1:35:27] speaking through the soldiers said, "If
[1:35:28] he was the son of God, he would come
[1:35:30] down." He saved others, but he can't
[1:35:32] save himself. If
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; the next time Satan comes to you and
[1:35:36] say, "If you're the bride of Christ, if
[1:35:38] you're a believer, if you're a good
[1:35:41] person, if you're the the wife of
[1:35:43] Christ, if you are, you wouldn't have
[1:35:45] made that mistake. your kids wouldn't
[1:35:47] have done that. You wouldn't have had
[1:35:50] that thing, terrible thing happen. You
[1:35:51] know, Satan was always looking for
[1:35:53] something.
[1:35:55] But God wasn't.
[1:35:57] You know why God never said if you are?
[1:35:59] Cuz he knew who you were.
[1:36:02] Hallelujah. Oh wow. This word is just
[1:36:06] amazing. God never ever come to you and
[1:36:10] said, "If you were mine, you wouldn't
[1:36:12] have done that." He knew you would do
[1:36:14] that.
[1:36:15] He knew I would fall down. He knew he
[1:36:18] would have to come and save a dummy like
[1:36:20] me.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Wow. Ain't that amazing how we can just
[1:36:25] recognize
[1:36:27] Satan the liar.
[1:36:29] Hallelujah. Just beautiful. Thank you,
[1:36:31] Junior. What an amazing. Let's sing that
[1:36:33] song as family of God.
[1:36:36] Amen. So, God bless you. We just look
[1:36:39] forward to fellowship just as much as we
[1:36:42] want and just uh it's amazing. Amen. If
[1:36:47] it's it's not if you are. You know the
[1:36:50] very no matter how worse of a sinner
[1:36:53] that would ever be in the world if they
[1:36:55] have a thought towards God proves
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; that they came from God.
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Cuz no man come to the father unless the
[1:37:02] father give them the thought to think
[1:37:04] about him.
