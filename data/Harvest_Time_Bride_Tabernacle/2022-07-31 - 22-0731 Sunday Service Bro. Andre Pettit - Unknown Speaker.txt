to be back in the house of god you may have your seat um first i want to thank brother dale insisted his wife your wife for their hospitality we just felt at home and it's always a blessing to meet precious saints precious faith and we need each other and and the prophet said without each other you can you can do it and you know we we speak about love but how to demonstrate love it's on other people of course among us and all over the world anybody you know like the prophet one day he was in a restaurant and there was an old woman she looked like a prostitute and he started to judge her and finally the spirit of the lord came on him said you want to put a spider and to condemn her what's about yourself and so you know the rest of story he went he apologized there was an old sister she passed many years ago she was from germany and and she will go in in a restaurant and she will talk with the lady that served the meal and she is just show love and she will hold her hand and you know when people she has such a love for anybody anybody amen so brother dale asked me um if i could speak a little bit about the way we raise the kids so we have five kids and 14 grandchildren so it's not a record but it's hard to beat 14. and then also i don't want to brag on anything because it's the grace of god but our five kids they serve the lord and their husband too and so they they are in message church but they are scattering all over one is in connecticut and the other one in phoenix and another one in the alberta so it's not the bermuda triangle but it's we have to travel to to see them and uh two weeks ago they were with us and it didn't happen since six years to have all the family together and they they celebrate our 70th anniversary suzanne and i so i turned 70. she turned 70. so altogether we have 140 years of experiences and there was a man i heard one day he was a christian he said you know he was old and maybe 85 he said you know my wife and i we have been married since 100 years people say what he said 50 from her side and 50 from my side to have a a family a strong family takes the boat so i will take just a couple minutes before uh preaching you know i want to to preach on prayer prayer or whatever so but i just jut uh through some notes i won't be long but just to share some testimony of as i say it's not only mechanic but the lord that's the grace of the lord so first devotion time so today so everything there is so much to do and communication internet and all those things are against family so but devotion time is so important so when they were just a little kid we have some little chair and i was going in the basement or i or suzanne and we were taking the bible but in image you know just show and we have to we had to go to their level you know you don't take the kid and you place around the table silence don't speak don't move and you take the bible in the beginning was the word and the word what was god what they understand on that you see if you just apply something to be religious because the message say it you are wrong you have to be normal human and go to the level and what you know and while they were growing we were taking uh another bible but with more text less photos or pictures and um and we read pile of books like biography like some saints even brother branham and you know what sometimes you know i was reading this another page papa i know the pages okay so i was reading and i say i said hey now it's time to go to take your baptist you know they were forcing me to go on you see it was not worrying you know when i was catholic with the little little boy who were kneeling and yeah we were catholic and and the radio were listening and happy mariah and stuff like that it was a punishment and you know but we we make it fun and they enjoyed what we were reading to their level and we did the piles of of biography and so that's make a difference and also another point is uh correction you know uh some people are everyone is a little bit different and we know what the bible say about correction it's necessary but see if you go too far away from one side or the other side you are wrong you know sometimes they say uh now with the the worldly people you know they uh they cannot touch a kid they cannot correct a kid but they do a monster you know they don't obey and they are stubborn but there there is a balance you know in a correction it's a raise a cheat children a child is not you do and you don't you have to explain why if you don't want them to see the neighbor because they are not good people and you don't they don't have friend you have to tell them why you explain to them to bring a judgment a balance to understand an understanding you know there is a brother when the uh years ago he was coming with his five kids and they were sitting you know what they were the best one they were sitting and they were not moving the whole service and it was quite strong you know like hey come here and but you know what when they they became teenager they were really against church against everything but he never developed a love and comprehension and it was just like strong it it he did wrong he did wrong you know he went to the extreme so and you know sometimes uh kids they play on our nerve and uh some sometimes you know you lost control a temper especially men amen and you know i was hearing brother billy paul one day he said uh he he told a testimony he said i was with uh with dad he was the secretary and the little paul was coming to see his grandpa and he was just a little boy you know maybe three years old and and so billy paul was saying he said no paul it's not time go back home and you return and then no paul it's not time papi is busy papa is busy so go back home after two three times billy paul lost control and he hit his son start to cry of course and brother branham told him he said billy paul never do it again because when you hit him you hit his angel because you did it on you were angry and he said this is not good at all it could be an effect on the on the kid because their angels see the face of of my father you see you see it's never do that you have to keep your temper and you need the punishment but you talk with them like um my little pierre the oldest uh one day we had a babysitter come at home to keep the kids and he really disobeyed he never listened so when we came back she said he was very bad and the next day i told her you know he was five or six years old i said pierre i explained to him that it was not good he didn't obey and he was stubborn i said now listen i want you to apologize to this lady i said will you apologize he said no so i repeat again to make sure that he understood i said i i said papa i want you to apologize and we'll take the phone and we'll call her whatever he don't remember the detail but anyhow and he was stubborn i said now if you don't i have a plastic i don't know how you call that but you know you understand i said i will have to hit you but it's it's not because i don't like you it's because i like you i know i want you to learn how to obey it's important so are you going to apologize no so the rest of the story you understand but after he was crying so i took him in my arm i said you know papa i love you i said are you going to apologize next time you said yes papa you see and one day my one of my daughter she was in the morning we we want every kids to do the bed you know to fix the bed and we i repeat her many times but you know how it was you know they have so much to study and and rush and and so one morning i went in the basement again so it was it seemed that the drawer vomit clothes you know there was clothes on the floor i didn't like it i i like when it's in order like every family that doesn't mean i'm all the time in order but i was tempted to take all the clothes and all the blanket and to make a big mountain over the bed but finally i prayed i said what should i do oh an inspiration came so i i place replace all the clothes in the drawer and i i fixed the bed and i wrote a little note and i wrote i said dear honey i know you are you were worried and not worried but in hurry you didn't have time and i said dad fix it for you love you with the big art and you knew what it was the right thing to do but after that you know there was a change you see but in fact you know i place myself in instead of christ that's the way the lord did for us you know you you become like christ for your family and uh you are an image a living image of what christ is and so um whatever i'll say about the token you know brother bernam said in the token he spoke about the cartoons and you know the the books uh with the kids you know in his time hey compared with today there was nothing but um he said those cartoons one of those they they will have an effect on your kids so now how much more the video and the game and my son pierre when he was a teenager he was playing to the like fire men in the grocery and it looks so real i said yeah what you know one more one day i doing yeah it's only a video i said yeah but you kill people you know i s this is wrong and for him it was nothing you see little by little why there is so much shooting in every school today because the game they see it you know their their brain their mind is there's a seed there and you see you better to watch what they are listening with internet today it's so corrupted but you have to watch because you know when they are a kid you apply laws because if they are not born again you have to keep them on the law and you you do the law in your house you do that and you don't do that and when they will be older and they will be converted you will not need any laws but you know i was when they were kids of course we were french and and all the kids in the school they were listening uh tv and english so they could have more opportunity to be bilingual and so uh we bought a lot of video of of the bible you know samson esther and abraham and all and so they were listening that i said listen to me i said i don't want you to bring anything else if you do it i will kick out this screen and the video player i said you i i want you if there is something that you are interested in you come and ask me and so but i find out you know you have to to have a balance in that i find out so the more they listen some supposed to be good movies the less thirst they have for god you know paul said all things are laughable to me but i will not be brought under the power of any you know time is short and just to have a distraction soon enough you will find that you lost the love that you have for god or to read the bible or to listen a message okay and so there is another point uh kids they need friends so but you are parents you are the one to choose what kind of friend or which are you going to provide for them and so in the vacation time i was offering the kids so what do you want to have we could have some vacation somewhere close to a lake or mountain camping or to go in michigan or ohio no we want to go in ohio that's exactly what we want too and you know and there they they met other girl and start to write and you see you provide good friends because they need friends so and of course we we had youth camp in the church while i was pastoring the church and before we used to have camp for the kids that they could have opportunity to have fellowship with others and also that they could receive the holy spirit you know praying me thing and and you know and that's did a lot of difference you know and so we um my son-in-law who is the pastor's brother steve uh usually we do two camp per year in the in the winter in the springtime another point is the prophet said make your home a place where it is pleasant to leave you know when you you put some outside you know you make it nice and you provide for them it's important you know and also the atmosphere at the home if you scream at your wife and she scream at you and and she opposed you and uh hey what kind of model they're going to have the best gift you can give to you kids is to love husband and wife to love each other because they learn from you you are the only bible they can read when they were young and so and also um you have especially the man of the family is the provider but the provider is not to bring bread on the table you know in the old time that my father was a father of 12 kids he was a provided provider but he was not a man to take his kids to give them love and to embrace them to speak with them and the kids need that you need a father you have to develop not only that's good to provide to work and almost day and night this is not good but you have to talk with them you have to inquire what do you leave what do you think how are you so you talk with them and to to know the needs so uh so the dialogue you say it's so important so important and you know at school when the kids were at school the teacher they could wait to to know us because our kids they were so different you know they were calm peaceful and they were creative you know in heart they were so good and the teacher many times we heard this testimony we we could wait to to know you what are you to have such a special kid you see that was the atmosphere you see and uh um another point is uh to be faithful dedicated for others because when we have devotion time we we pray for each other for the needs to learn them that they are not by themselves but today there is a tendency even in the people in the message just to listen brother branham listen the tapes but they are alone they are in their home they have no fellowship this is absolutely wrong you see because a church is a body and how could you demonstrate love if you are alone in your house and your kitchen and you don't want to have fellowship with anybody it's just so wrong yeah and so uh fully dedicated uh there was when i was passing the church there was a couple they have all excuses good to not attend the church and so even on sunday morning they place their little boy with their hockey competition so i called them i said now i said you you don't go come to church to bring your kids in a kind of complete hockey hockey competition i said hey do you think that when they will be 12 years old and older they will come to church you are a very poor example so finally they they were stubborn so the couple divorces and their son one of her son became homosexual and it was just a mess you see because if you don't and at home the lord has witnessed you know since 50 years or about so sister suzanne if you go in the kitchen you hear the voice of the message the voice of the prophet and so and when we were driving to go to the camp i was putting a tape and listening of course they were all sleeping while we were listening but at least it's like the basket of water is you know something that they learn and also another point could be more than that but you hide problems that in the local church like i was a pastor i never mentioned the problems that i could have or some people could have you just present the the good size the good side of every situation you hide and you know even brother branham said don't speak about somebody you hide somebody did a mistake you don't bring that before other people this is so wrong because your kill is influenced you hide you cover with love and if somebody did something wrong try to find something positive to say about the person you see the holy spirit is not the septic tank you know it's something clean it's something you know god will work in certain atmosphere amen okay so i think that's maybe not enough but anyhow so it's some point that i think that make the difference so i apologize i was uh i would like to present a little video of haiti and especially their worshipping but internet was not working i have all kind of problem yesterday and so but anyhow so maybe another time well anyhow so um but this morning we're going to take this topic about uh praying so prayer is uh is my hardest things to do because we are in a nervous world and very busy with all kind of priority and i used to say you know hey wait a minute it's impossible to do everything in life it's impossible there is too much task too much to do even in work in the house and there's so much to do but you have to decide what are you going to neglect because you cannot do it do everything perfectly it's a choice what are you going to neglect so you know uh people when they they like to do something they always find time okay you always uh find time but you have to choose um could you mind to stand up and we're going to read a text it's going to be in isaiah chapter 40 three and only one verse 22 isaiah 43 verse 22 while you are turning sister amy sorry too was it working okay wait uh anyhow after the service i will explain to you okay let us pray before heavenly father here we are and here you are too and we believe that your present is here you feel the whole world the universe and you said that you're going to be always with us till the end of the world and you said if there are two or three gather in my name i will be in the midst of them so that's the reason why we come with reverence and we come in asking for forgiveness for you our sin our mistake and we know that you are rich in mercy and you understand and as we ask forgiveness you're always faithful to forgive us we ask you to come this morning and help us while we're going to preach your word and i pray in jesus name amen isaiah 43 verse 22 but tao has not called upon me o jacob but tao has been worry of me o israel you may have your suit so this is quite a fair a verse you know and and god said to israel you has not called upon me because you has been worry of me now let me tell you that even if we are christian and we are convinced about the bible the truth the message but sometimes we just get tired we became idle there is no ask in our life there is we go to church and sometimes spiritually and physically we are tired we are boring no expectation no demand you have to be honest we all do that some period and no calling upon the lord no prayer life but tao has not called upon me oh jacob but thou has been wary of me could you imagine a kind of spiritual tiredness you know like amnesia and brother bronam said the church is like a woman in in her month you know there is some period you see and the church is likewise the same way we are not all the time in revival but we need to be in revival and it's like i used to sit to backslide it's like to run a car it's a manual car and you are driving on on on the fifth speed and you you go down to four you are still running but you go slower and after you go on the third and after you go on the second and after you go to the first at the first speed you don't go fast but you are still going you understand sometimes we are christian we are not backsliding like be in the world and drinking or smoking but we are going so slow you know in french there are it's the other word but that's mean the same thing you know i try to explain to give you uh an idea you know sometimes we lose our first zeal enthusiasts and joy in the old testament in the moses days you receive instruction how to build the altar according to the model gods showed him he built the altar and put the sacrifice and god sent down the fire see and the levite had to bring wood every morning to keep the fire burning on the altar you see you catch the idea at the pentecostal experience the fire fell but they have the responsibility they are sacrificed to bring wood to the altar to keep the fire burning what is wood humanity it's us you see to keep the fire burning we have to come to the altar every day to keep this fire burning if we don't bring the the sacrifice there is nothing to burn there is nothing there is no use for the fire amen you see that's what we have to do just a wonderful type and you know the story of samson he had a good beginning a flirt would die with dalai la and each day she was after him to find the secret of his power and we know the story was in his hair consecration you see the consecration and because he neglected he became tired to keep his secret fell asleep and they cut his hair his hair and he became after blind when you lose your consecration little by little you become like blind there's a veil you don't see the glory of god you don't enjoy the power of god the visitation of god you see israel in their journey they crossed the red sea after they had the bitter water at mara they went through the sin dessert they hadn't food but god gave them the manna right as soon they said we are tired of that food they wanted meat and god sent them quails by tons and the lord smote the people with a very great plague and he called the name of that place you know there was i think two thousand two um 23 000 people who died like flies and he called the name of that place kibrat atahava because there they buried the people that lost meaning atahava means sepulture of desire if you have worldly desire you just please your flesh it's become a sepulcher a death of desire you see and today with the spiritual manner get tired of the spiritual manner and started to look after the things of the world you see you are in danger but thou has not called upon me or jacob but thou has been wary of me oh israel now we go to jose uh joshua and caleb you know there was 12 spies two were in the mind of christ god ten of them they were tired they criticized you know when somebody is sorry of god he always turned around himself and start to criticize criticize other criticized you know criticize and they were saying you are we are not able they were looking all the mistake of the message people church or whatever you know they look at the negatives thing you know how much you know we know we don't have to look uh to put our eyes on what's going on on all the churches and in the world in in all the false doctrine if you feed on that you won't be a happy people you know and those 10 spies they were feeding on that the negative point oh we are tired to wait upon god why we should not be in the promised land as soon and they start to criticize moses but caleb said he still the people shout your big mouth because they were crying they were saying we're going to going back to egypt when we were there at least we have sepulcher we have cucumber we have everything but here we don't know where this message bring us he quieted them and said let us go let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it you know but those ten spies they were tired of god promises tire means doing nothing one day two men were speaking together one of them was giant he was a tall guy and the other one very small like me maybe my last name is petite means small hennia the small man admired the size of that giant my if i was as tall as you are i will fear nothing i will go in the forest to find the biggest beer that i could find and i will cut him in peace the giant was smiling at him and he said but there is a lot of small bears in those forests why don't you go and catch one you know sometimes we look at brother branham and oh how the mighty man of god he was and if i were him i will do that and i will do this but why are you where are are you not going to after small things you are sick you pray for people you pray for your kids why you see that's what we do something you know the prophet the apostle and if i were the apostle if i were but what is this message what is this message about it's about the bride it's about you you become the bride she and him is the same the work he did you will do it you see one day we might go tomorrow to niagara falls brother robert uh i've been once and well we'll see anyhow so one day years ago they want to do a suspended bridge over the niagara falls and they were discussing how to start to build a bridge over niagara falls how to cross the big cables over the river one day with a wind in good direction they send a kite over the river and then at the tiny small rope they attach a bigger rope and to the bigger rope they attach a cable and to the cable a big steel cable and finally they were able to build a bridge capable to support every big train you see small fate you see and from the small faith you know something you get something bigger something bigger and finally you you you know what i mean you see and so you start to exercise your faith don't stay idle send your little kite by the wind of the holy spirit and you send it by faith lord i sent it in your name and you see and you learn to get from god you learn to ask and you receive amen he said uh in the message where i think pentecostal failed he said you can never exhaust god's love and mercy to you you say well i hate to bother you so much father he wants to be bothered that way he does don't never think that you could ever ask too much of god i believe the scripture said you have not because you ask not you and you ask not because you believe not he wants us to ask and believe that our joy would be full he wants you to ask abundantly first start to send your little kite and ask for a bigger thing he said ask for bigger things don't limit your faith to some little mustard seed get on out here to some other kind of faith and move out in big things the little kite more and more more and more more and more big things is just as easy to receive as little things you just have to believe that's all amen you go on your reclining chair and all your worries you say and so what you see amen he said you can put it right to work and it will just be fine amen amen see you don't expect you receive nothing you see and uh sometimes you don't have expectation and you think you could then you couldn't have more than what you have now okay so in your life the problem with us is a tradition we come to church and even brother robert went in a tradition while we were with brother our brother uh we were the first day we arrived he sit at a certain place in the table and so the next day he went to the same place and this morning he went to the same place i said now you develop a tradition but you know that's how we are human being but okay now i will ask you to follow me with your imagination suppose there is a wood chest okay like five feet long two and a half by two and a half high and there is a cover a lid right okay so now this is uh uh this is you that's to represent you so now somebody asked you to fill this wood chest with a tennis ball you know that the yellow tennis ball what color it is you fill it up and and now i come to you i said do you think there is more place available oh no no no look i i put the lid and there i could not add even one more ball i said are you sure now i go somewhere i bring a big bucket of marble and i pour the marble in the wood chest and i put another one and three buckets of marble you know marble and and i and i said now you see you told me there was no more room and i proved you there was more room because you see there was more room and sometimes we come to church we well i expect nothing because i'm full i am a christian there is you know there is nothing i could receive more than that are you sure are you sure so now the the guys oh wow my word i didn't know there was more room now do you think it's full i'm sure it's full i'm not certain of that so i go somewhere and i bring some sand and i pour one bucket of sand two buckets of sand three buckets of sand and there was a room i said you see you told me there was you were full but there was room for something else and now you start to crush your head wonderful are you sure that you are full with the holy spirit do you think that you could not have any more so now i ask you do you think it's full now oh yeah yeah it's full now it's not so i go and i take a water a bucket of water i pour in the in the chest i take another one i take another one and i and i place five buckets of water you understand don't limit god sometimes you say oh i cannot do it sure you cannot do it but call upon god say lord change me make me to have so such a thirst for you that my cup will fall over will go over and over i will become drunk i will lost my head you know brother branham said lose your head it's good you know i was a kid my grandpa was coming to to butcher the the chicken and they cut their head and they were running all over and was afraid of that but you know but sometimes like a christian you know we limit so much god lose your head and and use your heart and say lord i know nothing i'm nothing but you are everything and become drunk drunk in the spirit amen amen he said we must go to the apostolic faith now what is the apostolic fate now remember this he said in the revelation of jesus christ christ is the true church in is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation how shows how that antichrist spirit will come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless tire of god tradition doing nothing it exposed satan revealing his work attempted destruction of god's people in the discredit discrediting of god's word think about this word discrediting of god's word you discredit if you say you i don't know this brother by example but if i say he is a lazy man he doesn't like to i'm sorry brother you know i don't say i don't know you but you see uh in some time you know he forget everything and uh he's not silly it doesn't come on time and you know i speak again i discredit discredit him you see and you know satan come and he he does the same thing he put a discrete on the word and you say oh no this is not for you you are not able uh you are not enough holy you see he and he say well he said well you know it was in the time of brother branham it was good for him it was good for wesley and for the pentagon you know he put the scripture to the word you see he cannot tell you that the word is the word is not true but it will delude it with anoint with unbelief you are not worthy you are not you are this and that you see discrete and he said he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and that what she is that she stands for and that she cannot she can do greater worse she will be in the invincible army if they get the true revelation of the two spirits working don't think about other churches think about yourself amen don't go too far go in your own life check what what they will try to do with you amen amen turn your our faith to the father's faith the church of study should be the same as the first one right and the characteristic one of the characteristics they were praying and fasting in the upper room they were waiting they were not order coffee at tim orton and drinking coffee and play cards and have fun they say hey we're going to receive the holy spirit when we don't know but let us drink coffee and have a meal no they were praying they were praying the apostles were too busy with the distribution of food and they placed deacon to spend time in prayers and on the world you see man even it's mentioning prayer first now we see there was a time where people were taking a shower once a week and they were praying every day and you know that now they they take a shower every day they pray once a week you see cornelius a centurion devote men which gave much ants to the people and prayed to god always always because he was praying while he was praying he saw an angel who told him send men to jaffa and call for one simian and bring him here he was in prayer when the angel came and he told he gave a message and now peter was in prayer also you see the phone was existing at that time and you didn't have to pay internet for a phone you know it was working so he was praying peter was praying also and there was a connection spiritual connection you see and uh you know the rest of the story uh peter was in prison and the church were continuously praying for peter paul at damascus after he met god became blind and he was praying and he had a vision and he saw nanya say in vision saw paul you see the work of the holy spirit the apostle established elder in prayers they were praying and fasting paul saw a vision one night a message in dunya praying and saying come to macedonia to help us you see he prayed and that's brought a vision and you see that's the way we the holy spirit communicate it's not by phone or email or text though though the lord could use that but now you know we rely too much on on natural things a natural church instead of having the supernatural god okay some some quote on prayers charles persian he said i would rather teach one man to pray than ten men to preach andrew murray we must pray with our eyes on god not on the difficulties as well chambers there is no other activity in life so important as that of prayer every other activities depend upon prayer for its best efficiency john bunyan prayer is not learning in the classroom but in the closet and drew murray prayer is not asking prayer is putting oneself in the hands of god and at his disposition and listening to his voice in the deep of our hearts prayer is listening not just asking louis he said the more you pray the less you panic the more you worship the less you worry you will feel more patient and less pressure martin luther i have so much to do that i will spend the first three hours in prayer wow it was getting early oswald chambers prayer does not fit us for the greater work prayer is the greater work the el modi he who nails the most stand the best brother branham sometimes we go off on the trend at 10 trumps somewhere and not think about god not pray over it ask the lord whether we should do it or not and we find out that our supply of blessing is cut off then we wonder sometimes well wonder why i can have no more blessing you don't watch you don't you let down in your prayer life you say well i'm a christian well that's the more sign you should pray more than ever read the bible every day pray every day don't make any decision too harshly or too quickly without first considering god about it ask him shall i do this father ask him is it your will for me to do this because we don't do that we make so much mistake then see what the holy spirit will speak to you it's not only asking is to hear the lord speaking to you [Applause] you might not give he might not give you a vision but he will speak in some way to you to let you know if you will be sincere and ask him you seem to be saying this word means something you know it's come from a french word i will explain to you there was a time they were um with clay they were doing a pot you know a clay and sometimes there was a little default in in in the the clay pot and they could use they will sell it and they could use in in the in there to cook something or to put something hot but uh the guy that was doing the the mold or the clay they they had the walks over to hide the holes or where it was not perfect or could link and so the person will buy it looked so nice you know but there was walks over to hide the problems that default and so you buy it you put some hot water and the water go all the way and so now after a while the person they start to to know about the trick and so they they will go to the the guy and they say okay now is that with walks or without walks you see and in french is is it esc avec c series watch or without c you know see and you see in censor or saint-saens french in english it's sincere are you without walks or you are with walks you see you cover your imperfection but god see it we cannot imitate something we have to be genuine sincere with god without walks we come to him we don't want to show something that we are not amen um okay the prophet said many many places that prayer is the greatest power that exists in the world you remember that amen he said prayer is the key that's the answer prayer changed things prayer is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human being in the control of human being there is no atomic bombs or no hydrogen bomb as powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of god did you know that yes amen and there is another power that the prophet spoke about that is like atomic bomb is love now if you can join the two together what kind of a bomb you're going to have you see brother branham said he said all my ministry is based on one thing if i could love something will happen and love is project grace take over so could you imagine now you are a sincere christian and you are praying with love for somebody in hospital for any kind what kind of power you got sincere without walks amen uh in the laodicean church he said if you disagree you happen to have no bitterness no indifference when it's come to fellowship with one another we love one another and if we don't do that well you will never go no farther in god until we do that so in life you are a christian sometimes it's different churches or opinion it's it's always it's happening all the time but you know and brother perry green he came in haiti with me years ago 2001 it's over 20 years and he said brother branham told me that brother peregrine who told me that he said after my departure there will be if i remember well 17 different interpretations of the message brother nam you was following and and brother greene some believers were coming in town and he said they were criticized me and another group will come and they will criticize and and finally you know 17 different attendants or group came and one day he received a revelation the lord spoke to his heart he said if they don't love you why don't you love them you are not obligated to hate them if they don't love you why you do the same and from that time on it started when there was a new comer he started to held him he said brother do you need any chair or any assistant or something you know he changed his mind and finally he could count ominate doctrine came and finally there was one missing and he told me that i realized that was my interpretation you see jane chapter 5 16 say confess your faults one to another and pray for one for another that he may be healed sometimes okay i was reading the scripture many many times till i heard how brother branham uh interpret it you see confess your fault to one another and pray for one another that he may be ill not the other person you you see when you pray for somebody god see that's what brother abraham when you pray for somebody god see that and honor you and reward you and you receive healing amen could you imagine that you receive healing in the quote in the message jesus christ is the same he said i've seen god do great things but the greatest thing i ever seen in my life was love it's the most powerful force that stop anything there is is love love that move a mighty god he said in god's provided ways that love is the most powerful force there is in the world there is nothing as great as love power only in love power only in love amen i'm going to surprise you maybe but i'm going to read you a letter from albert einstein to his daughter it really moved me so albert einstein was born march 14 80 79 and died in 8 18 april 55. it's perhaps best known as for being a theory called physics physicist and for receiving the 1921 nobel prize in physics for his service to theory called physic a lesser known fact about arguably one of the most intelligent men of modern time is that he was also a prolific sender of personal note and letters upon his own personality personalized letterhead in the late 1980s einstein daughter lieser donate to 1400 letters written by einstein to the hebrew university the text of one of them is reproduced below for you going to read it having been sent by einstein to his daughter this letter show a very different side of einstein personality and his outlook on the world when i proposed he said now that's einstein he said when i proposed the theory of relativity there a very few understood me and that i will reveal and what i'm going to reveal now to transmit to mind kind will also collide with misunderstanding and prejudice in the world i ask you to guard the letter as long as necessary years decade until society is advanced enough to accept what i will explain below there is an extremely powerful force that so far science has not found a formal explanation to it is a force that included all governs all others and is even behind any phenomenon operating in the universe and has not yet been identified by us this universal force is love when scientists look for a united unite unified the theory of the universe they forgot the most powerful unseen force love is light that enlighten those who give and receive it love is gravity because it makes some people feel attracted to others love is power because it multiplied the best we have and allows humanity not to be extinguished in their blind selfishness love unfolds and reveals for love we live and die love is god and god is love this force explained everything and gave meaning to life this is the variable that we have in your too far long maybe because we are afraid of love because it is the only energy in the universe that man has not learned to drive at will wow when we learn to give and receive this universal energy dear lester we will have affirmed that love conquers all is able to transcend everything and anything because love it's the quentin is the quintessences of life i remember a um little there was a woman and she was married and her mary was like a beast he was so hungry sometimes you know she was after she married him she was afraid of him and she didn't know what to do you know he was so violent and she went to see an old man in in the mountain and he has a reputation have some herbs and medication and she went to see him she said she explained the problem said what should i do he said i know what you could do he said i have some herbs but i need four a hair of a mustache of a tiger so she said really so finally she said well if that could cure my husband i will find a way to find four hair of a mustache of her tiger so she went in the forest in india and she brought meat meat and she hiding under a tree and she waited and and finally after a couple hours the tiger came smell it and eat it so the next day she did she brought meat and that time he was around and she eat it and after she started to to get a little bit away from the hiding place and she gave meat and he came and day after day he small start to smell the lady and now she was approaching him all the time all the time and came a time where she barely bring the the meat and it was right coming next to her and so she started to touch him a little bit and he looked at her and he was eating and day after day she was patient and one day she just started to to be nice with him and she went a full four year four or five enough to get four the tiger looked at her and he left so she hurried and she she said to the woman i said here is the air the mustache of this tiger so he took it and there was fire next to him and he threw in the fire what are you doing he said well he said now he said do the same with your husband and it will be all right conquer with love be nice feel it amen he said i deeply regret not having been able to express what is in my heart which was quietly beaten for you all my life maybe it's too late to apologize but as time is relative i need to tell you that i love you and thanks to you i have reached the ultimate answer your father albert einstein amen so prayer is something that you have to slow down it's not like uh driving through what you want coffee doughnuts and and you look and uh hey it's so slow this morning and you think prayer is something that you have to slow down and when you nail of course you will start to to think about oh i have to do to do this thing today i have to go there and i have to come accomplish that and and you know what it's a trick you are nailing down and your mind is busy so write what you have to do okay and after you go on okay you write it you write it and after a while it's over you wrote whatever you you want to do and your mind start to relax and you get you know little by little in the spirit and you stay quiet you close all the doors of your mind and take your time and wait what the lord has to tell you you see it's not just us it's not a grocery list you see it's it's a communion you see um yeah so the power of decision he said uh you know that's what's the matter with the church today it don't get in the spirit enough we are too much in yourself in our self my if you just get out of your your cell long enough you say well you know our church is they have their regular routine oh who cares about your routine get in the spirit then you can see things done you see i remember one time i was in my office i was nailing praying next to my my desk the phone rang so i took it and there was a secretary at the bank she said mr petey if we understand i don't remember exactly what she said if i understand you want to change the the amount of that money from that account to the other one and i was listening and you know i was i was my mind was in prayer and when she said that you want me to do that i said amen suddenly i realized what in the world i said to her so i didn't know what to do i said i cannot explain her because i was praying the in my mockery or it was my hang up so another time i was praying at pawn range and i was i was somewhere else and i said alleluia it was between an ello and hallelujah amen there was a man one day you know he went to see a pastor he said pastor i don't know how to pray i don't know well he said this very simple he said praying is is talking to god oh there is a chariot he said praying is talking to god so you imagine that the lord jesus is here and you sit down oh maybe i should demonstrate in a better way i hope you are not too you know i could be a little bit longer but i don't want any help so he said you stand you sit down you relax and you imagine that the lord jesus is right in the front of you and you talk with him you say you know lord jesus um i'm so a bad person i do nothing good and you talk and you talk and and finally after a while you you start to feel something the lord starts to talk to you so you shout your big mouth and you listen god and after a while you know the man like it you know he he followed the advice and he liked it so much that from that time on he will put a chair in front he will sit down and he will talk to jesus prayer is talking to jesus it's very simple but finally he gets sick and he was in the dying bed or clothes and his daughter said papa i'm going in town are you okay i will be back in one hour or so and he said oh no don't be wary i will be fine and so when she came back he was in the bed he was already with the lord but it was strange because he lay his head on the next chair the chair close to his bed and she said to the pastor i said it's very strange i said when i find him his head wasn't laying over the chair oh he said i know why i teach him to talk to jesus well we led the chair there amen amen but the greatest thing i have found in christian life is letting the holy spirit lead you and guide you and his work is marvelous he move in the mysterious ways his wonders to perform you see i gave you the other day the example of my five dollar in the bank account i went in my knees i said lord this is your problem this is not my problem and the river i said i know what to do to cross the river i said i know to do we we pray and we say lord i don't know what to do and that's it and the reclining chair your worry and so what you relax yourself you relieve yourself you see uh in the hebrews he said and when god make a promise in the bible i see a man here in the wheelchair when god make a promise he is guilty of that promise unless he bring it to pass god is guilty when he makes a promise and it's got to be fulfilled or god is guilty could you imagine so god made a promise and you believe it right and if you don't believe it and say lord you said this and that you have to respond and you know sometimes you say oh this is not polite no god like it when you take to his word he said lord i will not accept anything else that what you said you give a promise you will fulfill it amen amen he said in the believing god he said all things are possible to him that believes now you know if it isn't jesus told something wrong is that right when then it lays within you it's nothing god you understand he said all things are possible okay he said you know if it's not true jesus said something wrong but he said the right thing he said then it lays within you it's your responsibility to believe it and i mean well yesterday or first night i i i i talked about that you know too often we look to our ourself and you know and this is wrong we look at our self righteousness and holiness we have none god has it you see this is not mine that he is you see now we have to feed on the word to become the word and it's the same thing today see the very thing that the church is watering that is the seed the seed of the word it's the very word that becomes life and carry us to our own seed bridegroom you see i was reading something wonderful about bees and the queens you see the natural type the spiritual so the queens the bees the queens of bees lay her eggs in al veolus right the nurse bees or workers fed the larva with a special food called royal jelly from a special glen that they have in their head for three days you understand me so they have fed by a natural food royal jelly for three days for the laborers you see justification sanctification step listen to the rest it's amazing and after they feed them with honey and they become these workers three days a special food royal julie after three days honey only but for the future queens with s selected you know they are just eggs as the other one they could became just labors but after selected after three days they still receive the same food the whale chili and because of that their dna change and transform them in a queen and they will be fed by this kind of food for the rest of their man life about it you know the denomination they have honey that's good they have spiritual jelly but after three days it's over but for the bride the four days the fifth days feed on this jelly and they're d and a think about it our d and d what we are will be change in the moment in the winter in the heights will go in the rapture the word as a power transformation [Applause] you see the the word you feed on bring make you a new thing a bride a queen yes wow [Applause] a couple of times ago last summer i don't remember sister suzanne she find a caterpillar and she put in a jar with a little piece of wood and the next day this caterpillar make a little envelope she eyed himself in a cucumber cocoon you you follow me and so i was surprised because just the next day or two days after just kept up a little disappear where is the the capital she is in the mysterious time of transformation you know for us christian we wrap ourselves in the lord we make a new habitation we hide ourselves in christ and of course we took the royal jelly and after a couple weeks one day once in a while i was wondering if this the caterpillar was still alive and i was shaking this little jar and i could see once in a while there was a little move small but i knew there was life in that but one day a wonderful caterpillar came out of this hiding place was completely different than a caterpillar was a beautiful butterfly that has antennas big eyes and now the big difference this caterpillar could fly in heavenly places [Applause] could fly she was free from the world she could fly in heavenly places because it was change inside [Applause] amen peter said born from uncorruptable sea by the word of god could you imagine how powerful is the word of god wow i almost over you say praise the lord i like so much you i love you so much today okay you see i i brought this quote but i would just read the first part the word became flesh he said then when the human element goes out and the spirit of god filled that vacancy where you empty yourself amen then will be when the church it its power of the resurrection of the lord jesus will walk in his step in his power and history in his being and his moving you see what i mean then utah will become words and words will become materials that's when the church in power wow how many believe that i don't ask you to understand that but to believe it i believe it i believe it one day there was a hunter and he got lost in the forest because of his stubbornness he had a compass but he didn't use it because he was very confident in his ability to find his way so he was walking since a long time when he realized that he was lost but was already too late to consult his compass was dark so we built a shelter with branches and leaves to spend the night the next day he decided that he was smart enough to find his way back but the day went through without progressing at least he decided to consult his compass he thought that he had been stupid enough and he reached from his pocket his compass and soon he find his way home i think you start to understand where i i want to come our compass is prayer you see the word the word guide us but we have a compass the compass is prayer to know what to do to know where to act when you see to listen him in his will to surrender to him so now i'm going to [Music] let sister amy to play a little testimony i don't know who is the man is somebody from probably from united states and a brother from pennsylvania sen send it to me and i really enjoy it and you know it's all about to listen the voice you know we listen the voice we even at the voice of the southern angel you know god has a voice and the only way to make it in our life journey is to listen the voice of god you say to listen it's not just read the bible it's to listen god speaking to you that you could know the perfect will of god so i will let okay i will if you can play it now and we'll finish with prayer do you need to turn off the light no we're way out in the aleutian islands getting ready to leave and go back to anchorage and then home could you go back to i had a ticket in my pocket i was in alaska doing a lawsuit we're way out in the aleutian islands getting ready to leave and go back to anchorage and then home and i had a ticket in my pocket to get on an airplane the pastor came up and he said listen i can save you money i said how's that he said i live in a small airplane up here and i fly a small airplane and i can take you in my little airplane and you can save your ticket and this did not sound i said gee thank you so very very much but i've got this ticket we'll just make our way on home me and this other lawyer with me he said no no no you got to do it you got to do it and against every better judgment i had i said okay well we went out to the airport took us by his little plane and i looked at it and i thought well one good thing it's shiny then he walked around it we got in he's on the left front i'm on the right front the other lawyer's sitting right behind me and he started it up and it started up just fine well we taxied out i said should we pray he said yeah that's a good idea we normally don't i said well this time we're gonna and i'm telling you i prayed five eight minutes i prayed a long time we went and got on the runway he starts down the runway the plane lifted off ever so gently and we start climbing and it's wonderful not a problem in the world we started climbing and we flew probably three four minutes and something happened that will never leave my mind the pilot turned to me and he said we're going in the clouds and i can't fly in clouds they make me pass out i said clouds make you do what now it's been cloudy all day and we go right up into the clouds and you can't see anything and he looks at me and his eyes roll back in his head and he starts mumbling and he passes out passed out colt now i grabbed him and i shook him and i said come on you got to wake up so i can kill you now we're in the clouds flying along with no pilot and my friend in the back seat said we're dead aren't we i said there's a very good chance of that yes he said what are we gonna do i said i don't know but there was a radio right there and i handed him the microphone and i said start asking for help so he's in the back seat reaching up and he said hello hello we didn't know any proper radio etiquette all we were saying was hello and somebody answered back hello hello don't you guys know proper radio etiquette and i said give me i said we don't know nothing tell them we're in an airplane with a passed out pilot and we don't know how to fly this plane the guy said i'm a freighter flying out of anchorage on the way to tokyo and he said you're telling me you have nobody who can fly that plane with you said tell them that's correct now you gotta understand i am sweating bullets he said the first thing i'm going to do is start circling so i don't lose you because i'll fly out of range of your radio and you won't have me anymore and he said i'm going to get anchorage emergency for you an anchorage emergency will be the people that can maybe help you try to save your life after about five minutes anchorage came on said we understand you have a passed out pilot and those of you do not know how to fly that plane we said that's right they said well the first thing we got to do is find you now never forget what this man at anchorage said he said my job is to get you home safe he said that's my job but he said here's the deal if you want me to get you home safe you got to promise me you'll obey my voice he said you can't see me but i can see you and he said if you're not gonna obey my voice you're gonna die when you can't see anything you have no idea how disorientated you become finally he said okay i found you now hear me clear he said you're four minutes from a mountain he said you're going to crash in that mountain and die follow my voice i never said i have to follow your voice is that reasonable you see i understood without his voice i had nothing and do you understand without god's voice you have nothing nothing finally he got us turned and he said i'm freezing all the traffic in the area he said it's going to take me an hour and a half to get you to anchorage and there's a lot of weather between you and anchorage you're in for a rough ride and he said i want you to hear me i don't want you to look at what's going on outside i don't want you to pay attention to the storm just my voice he said if you start watching the storm you will die but i'll take you through it now because they cleared all the traffic several pilots those nighttime freighters those 747 started talking to us they said we're praying for you men you're going to make it but listen to the voice that's the key they said trust the voice you realize your head is full of voices and everybody in this world wants to talk to you and everybody wants to be the controlling voice and god says i want you to be a living sacrifice i want you to put yourself on the altar and let my voice be your voice finally we went through the worst of the weather but there was still more and then the voice came back and it said now i'm going to line you up he said i'm going to bring you in right down the runway and at the foot of the runway are some lights and they're in the form of a cross he said don't you forget this the cross is the way home finally he's bringing us down we still can't see anything and all he kept saying is stay with me my sheep the bible says hear my voice and they follow me finally just a couple hundred feet off the ground we saw the cross i landed the plane in fact i landed it seven times finally it all came to a stop and the minute we stopped the pilot woke up the voice said thanks for listening i watch them crash and burn all the time because they won't follow my voice they don't understand i'm the one who can see them even when they can't see me but they get the voices in their head and they kill themselves they self-destruct thanks for listening to the voice then they put us in a motel room in about four in the morning the knock at my door and i opened the door and a man was standing and he said hello david i said you're the voice you're the one who got me home he said i am do you understand one day you're going to stand before him and say you were the voice you're the voice that brought me home if you're not on that altar as a living sacrifice your head's full of voices and then we wonder why kids crash and burn we wonder why marriages are shattered and the lord's saying i'm the one who has the voice all i can remember is that voice saying stay with me stay with me don't listen to what's going on in your head and don't watch the storm stay with me and i'll take you through tonight you have a god who has promised to take you through a living sacrifice holy amen [Applause] amen may we stand up what's a moving testimony and so it's so accurate for ourselves in the time we're living there is so much confusion even even among us message believer but if we listen to a voice you know even sorry to say that but brother joseph you know that the philosophy is a churches and minister does mistake and only brother branham doesn't make mistakes so we have to skip church and this is a nonsense you see the ministry are there also to repeat that voice to bring that voice to be with the people to communion together let us pray heavenly father thank you so much for your voice in that time of confusion time of trouble time of storms of confusion and everywhere people say listen to me or listen to that doctrine or whatever but we are so thankful for you that you send a real voice and that was not the voice of a man was a voice of god in a man and we recognized it like a little story about beethoven and the music he composed the little girl the blind little girl she recognized the voice she said that's the master and that's the same thing for us we recognize through this wonderful message we recognize your voice and that voice will lead us through storm
