[13:14] Hallelujah.
[13:17] Hallelujah. Amazing grace.
[13:21] Crucified for me. Hallelujah.
[13:25] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Lord,
[13:28] we pray you'll
[13:30] bless your bride this morning, Lord God.
[13:34] And Lord, we remember our mothers
[13:38] today. Lord, our prophet said that our
[13:41] mothers could be the fifth
[13:43] gospel. Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and
[13:47] mothers.
[13:48] [Music]
[13:50] Bless the mothers, Lord God. Bless them
[13:53] in a special way. Lord, bless your
[13:56] people, Lord. And Lord, I pray that
[13:59] you'll feed them. Not men feed them, but
[14:02] if you'll feed them,
[14:05] We'll praise your name for it. Your
[14:07] name. Hallelujah. Amen.
[14:10] Amen. Praise God. Crucified.
[14:14] Amen. God bless you. It's just great to
[14:17] be here. Thank you, musicians. Maybe you
[14:19] can have your seats for a few minutes.
[14:21] Just
[14:23] a announcement and a
[14:26] testimony. Amen. Just
[14:29] uh maybe I'll do the testimony first.
[14:32] When me and
[14:33] Land went to the Ohio to the
[14:38] pastor's getaway and their
[14:41] wives. Amen.
[14:43] Uh we traveled back to the minister's
[14:46] meeting on Ohio's back roads. And Ohio's
[14:50] back roads are very
[14:54] narrow. And in some cases, we were in
[14:56] the hilly country of Ohio. So they're
[14:58] very hilly and curvy. And there was many
[15:02] times that we crossed the road or turned
[15:06] onto a side road that I asked Lanne,
[15:09] "How can you tell if anybody's
[15:12] coming?" And her answer to me was, "I
[15:15] guess you just
[15:18] go. That's, you know, the hood of your
[15:21] car would be up." And so you would look
[15:23] at oncoming traffic coming around the
[15:24] curb and I'm turning to the left and I
[15:27] can see the hood of my
[15:29] car. And so that's what it was
[15:33] like.
[15:35] And in this one spot we pulled
[15:39] up. It was not like that. I could clear
[15:42] see clear clearly see. And I hesitated
[15:46] just for a moment. But there was a van
[15:49] semi coming and then there was about 12
[15:52] cars right behind that semi. It looked
[15:55] like those cars have been trying to pass
[15:57] that semi for the last 20
[16:00] miles, but they couldn't because it was
[16:02] hilly country and
[16:05] curvy. And I almost
[16:08] went and I hesitated and I said, "We got
[16:13] all
[16:15] day." We had all day. We were early.
[16:17] Matter of fact, we went to a minister's
[16:18] house before the meeting
[16:21] and we hadn't turned behind this semi
[16:24] and 12
[16:25] cars. We hadn't turned one minute and we
[16:29] heard the sirens
[16:31] coming and they were farming
[16:34] there and a spray
[16:37] semi with tanks of
[16:39] water had pulled out front of the semi
[16:43] and they detourred us on an angle road
[16:46] and we were able to see the semi that I
[16:47] would have been in front of in the
[16:51] ditch. in the
[16:53] ditch and I would have been in front of
[16:55] that vehicle
[16:59] just by just by you know you just look
[17:02] and say so I got oh well
[17:06] so man so God you know we we don't
[17:10] recognize that sometimes and we were
[17:12] going home last
[17:14] Sunday and Lance said you forgot to tell
[17:16] the
[17:17] testimony amen but you know there's no
[17:21] such thing as a close call with God. No,
[17:24] it's called your guardian angel.
[17:27] Just made you
[17:28] hesitate for a reason. Amen. It makes
[17:31] you look at life differently. Amen. And
[17:35] so we praise God for all these things.
[17:38] And I too appreciated brother Carson's
[17:40] talking about many countries where many
[17:44] people
[17:45] are much
[17:49] uh under torment and and you know I I I
[17:53] think of North Korea if I watch anything
[17:54] from North Korea I can't sleep it's just
[17:58] just completely
[18:00] uh just terrible terrible just terrible
[18:04] and so we are blessed just to
[18:06] to have the freedoms that we do have.
[18:08] Amen. Amen. And um um so we just praise
[18:13] God for that. Also, I wanted to to uh
[18:16] just maybe I'll mention this and then I
[18:18] got announcement, you know, this week
[18:19] that we had
[18:21] uh we we uh uh inquired. Well, I don't
[18:24] know if we did, but the world did or or
[18:28] somebody did. I didn't. Maybe I did.
[18:32] Uh, we inquired a new
[18:34] pope. And uh, I want to just read the
[18:37] the uh, quote that brother Bram said
[18:40] about
[18:41] that. Vicki, if you could bring it up
[18:43] like last week, I'd I'd pay you real
[18:45] good. Amen. I believe one of these
[18:48] glorious mornings that the United
[18:50] Conference of Churches will go together
[18:53] and the new pope is brought out of the
[18:55] United States and it's put over
[18:57] according to prophecy and they'll form
[19:00] the image of the beast. The image like
[19:02] the beast and I tell you the true church
[19:05] of God will be drove together. Then what
[19:08] what I want to show you that you can
[19:10] leave that well maybe you can break
[19:12] well. So you know just to clarify this
[19:15] brother Dale don't know if this is the
[19:18] pope but brother Brandham clearly says
[19:22] when when an American pope he don't say
[19:26] may you know which one of them will
[19:27] there be but the way he appears like
[19:30] it'll be see there's never been
[19:34] never
[19:36] so some ministers that I in fellowship
[19:39] with said well you know how do we know
[19:41] if it's second third or fourth Or it
[19:43] could be the 24th for all I know, but
[19:45] that's not the way the prophet said it.
[19:50] He I mean, and you and it's okay if you
[19:52] think differently, but he insinuated
[19:55] when the pope from America
[19:59] comes. That's right. And this pope was
[20:01] born. But maybe you can bring up my next
[20:04] uh uh paragraph there that I got in my
[20:07] notes here, Vicki. This new pope chose
[20:10] the l the name Leo, which that Leo means
[20:14] like a lion. Uh the 14th and but he was
[20:18] born on September
[20:21] uh
[20:23] 14,
[20:26] 1995. And brother Brandham, I'm just
[20:28] doing some math for you and I I don't I
[20:30] just want to show you how God is
[20:33] omnipotent. That prophet was conceived
[20:36] when brother Brandham gave the prophecy.
[20:40] It's exactly, you can even check science
[20:42] on that, but he was conceived probably
[20:46] the day the prophecy went
[20:49] forth, but exactly 9
[20:51] months before the prophecy.
[20:55] So, it's just amazing God. Amen. So, God
[20:58] sure does know what he's doing what he's
[21:01] doing. Now I I
[21:02] mean you know I'm not a prophet so I
[21:07] can't see that this is the man but I do
[21:10] know this and I would just leave this
[21:11] with you that that I've heard and
[21:13] actually a brother in the church sent it
[21:16] to me and he's not here this morning but
[21:18] there is
[21:21] uh uh I just tell you this should excite
[21:24] the bride. I mean it would excite me. I
[21:26] I mean, and so I'm just, you know, I'm
[21:29] not making any like document statement
[21:31] here this morning. I'm just pointing
[21:33] you, you can make whatever. You can
[21:34] throw it in the garbage or whatever. But
[21:36] Trump has been making an announcement
[21:38] for about a week or two that he has
[21:40] something huge to make that's never
[21:42] happened
[21:43] before. And we have a bit of inside
[21:47] track to that that it appears like that
[21:50] it'll be a covenant with
[21:52] Israel. And the thing because the news
[21:55] say says it's never happened before in
[21:57] like500 2,000 years. And if that
[22:01] covenant that'll be the covenant that
[22:02] Israel breaks.
[22:04] So I mean like I put two and two
[22:07] together and I get four. If you get six
[22:09] that's okay with me. Uh but
[22:13] uh uh it's just
[22:16] uh it's just I I have the newscast if
[22:19] you want to watch it. Um, but we're
[22:21] living at the end times for sure. We're
[22:24] living at the end times. Amen. So,
[22:26] whether we see this actually come down,
[22:28] but uh he said that he was going to make
[22:30] a huge announcement, announcements
[22:32] that's bigger than anything that's ever
[22:33] been made. And it was a signature with
[22:37] it was in the Middle East and it was
[22:39] with Israel. And we know that they'll
[22:41] make a covenant that they'll be forced
[22:44] to break. And we know that Israel can't
[22:46] give up their land. They can sign
[22:48] anything they want, but they'll break
[22:50] it. And and and and we you know the
[22:54] history better than I do, but the people
[22:56] they're going to make the covenant with,
[22:58] they're untameable and wild man. So
[23:01] So Amen. Amen. So God is good, man. We
[23:06] sure welcome all our mothers. And if
[23:08] your mother's still alive, you want to
[23:11] say hello to her today, that's uh sure
[23:14] respectful. Amen.
[23:18] And many of us our mothers have gone on.
[23:21] Also, I just before we just get into the
[23:23] word, I had a a very nice letter left
[23:27] for me in my office. Very respectful,
[23:31] and they asked for
[23:33] clarifications and had a few questions
[23:36] on something I had ministered on. And I
[23:38] would gladly give that to them, but I
[23:41] don't know for sure who the letter was
[23:43] from. So, if you can just, however you
[23:47] choose to do that, if I know who it's
[23:48] from, I won't answer it personally, I'll
[23:51] show you what the prophet said. I I'll
[23:54] just I can just say, "Well, this is what
[23:56] he said multiple times." Amen. And I
[24:01] have multiple quotes. I won't cherry
[24:04] pick them, that's for sure. But uh but I
[24:08] by God's by amazing grace, I I I trust
[24:13] I've not preached anything different
[24:15] than what the prophet has said and and I
[24:18] have them right on my iPad and phone.
[24:22] Amen. So, amen. So, amen. God bless you.
[24:26] Let's just stand for the reading of the
[24:28] word. Amen. Let's turn to Philippians
[24:32] 2:9 and 11. our first scripture there,
[24:35] Vicki. Philippians 2:9 and 11. And and I
[24:39] want to preach on or God wants to preach
[24:42] on something that is somewhat related to
[24:45] mothers, but definitely our human flesh
[24:48] and something that is against the spirit
[24:50] of the age. And let me just read our
[24:52] scripture and then we'll give you our
[24:54] title. Therefore God
[24:56] hath God Therefore God also hath highly
[25:00] exalted him and giveth him a name which
[25:03] is above every name. And that that the
[25:06] name of Jesus every knee shall bow the
[25:09] things that are in heaven and the things
[25:11] that are in earth and the things that
[25:12] are under the earth. And that at every
[25:16] tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ
[25:20] is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[25:24] Lord Jesus, we pray that you would
[25:27] minister your your desire this morning.
[25:30] You would minister your thoughts, Lord
[25:32] God, and minister your scriptures and
[25:34] your word that will never pass away. And
[25:37] Lord, I pray that through the ministry,
[25:39] it will pick us up and encourage us and
[25:41] it will it will enlighten us and show us
[25:44] and
[25:45] recognize the hour we're living and what
[25:48] what you see in us, Lord Jesus. and we
[25:52] give you all the glory and all the honor
[25:53] for it. In your beautiful name we pray.
[25:57] Amen. Amen. You may have your
[26:00] seats. Amen. I want to have our Mother's
[26:03] Day uh message
[26:06] today
[26:08] on
[26:10] respects. Brother Brandham preached this
[26:13] message multiple times.
[26:16] uh a minimum of at least twice, but I
[26:19] believe it was actually more than that.
[26:21] But brother Brown preached about
[26:23] respects. And you know, uh let let me
[26:26] just lay a bit of a foundation here. We
[26:29] I'll give you a quote and I'll lay a
[26:30] foundation. The only way that you can
[26:33] respect
[26:34] God is respect one another.
[26:38] The only way. And I want to show you
[26:41] something in our our way of thinking.
[26:44] Anything that you value,
[26:47] you respect.
[26:51] [Music]
[26:53] So I can prove that by the Bible. I have
[26:56] two scriptures right underneath this how
[26:58] God said it.
[27:01] You know, we can prove it by the Bible
[27:04] and we can prove that anything that you
[27:06] respect or value, I mean you respect
[27:10] because it was the
[27:12] characteristics of God's
[27:14] family. It was not just the
[27:16] characteristics of God's family, but it
[27:18] was actually in the genes
[27:21] of God's family.
[27:23] Amen. Now, watch this. Sometimes
[27:26] Christians or believers they don't value
[27:29] something or
[27:31] someone is exactly or identified why
[27:34] they do not or cannot show
[27:38] respects. Anything that a believer or
[27:42] Christian either a thing or someone that
[27:46] you can't uh value you can never show
[27:51] respect for that thing. Now we see this
[27:54] shown by your lifestyle. You value your
[27:58] cell
[27:58] phone. So you never leave it
[28:01] anywhere. And if you do, you do a U-turn
[28:04] on the
[28:06] road and go back and get your cell
[28:08] phone.
[28:10] If you left your cell phone at church,
[28:12] you do a U-turn and come back and get
[28:13] your cell phone.
[28:14] But if you left your Bible at church,
[28:21] you know, that's why when you have a
[28:24] job, you're respectful to your boss
[28:28] at least in his presence
[28:32] because you value
[28:34] your job. Amen. That's the joy.
[28:38] You might talk about him behind your
[28:40] back, but if you don't show him respects
[28:41] to his face, your value is going to
[28:43] disintegrate.
[28:46] And your loved ones that you
[28:49] value, you'll leave a note. You know,
[28:52] before the digital age, when I was
[28:54] growing up and anybody in the family
[28:57] disappeared, we left a note on the
[28:59] kitchen table said, "Gone for gas, gone
[29:02] for a tire, feeding the guys at the
[29:06] field, passed out, died, something."
[29:10] We'd leave a note
[29:12] because you valued the people that were
[29:14] behind wondering where you would be.
[29:19] And so you would leave a note to your
[29:22] loved ones because you valued you didn't
[29:24] want them to be scared. And you would
[29:25] leave a note today. You'd probably send
[29:28] a
[29:29] text and say, "Hey, the boss asked me to
[29:33] work late. I'm going to be able to buy
[29:35] you flowers this Friday if I work late,
[29:37] so just put supper on. Pause."
[29:44] But if you
[29:46] value your
[29:48] relationship with your
[29:50] family, now brother, I'm going to go
[29:52] into some quotes. Brother Rams said
[29:54] about this, your
[29:55] parents, your boyfriend or
[29:58] girlfriend, your brother or sister,
[30:02] or your pastor or your ministers, the
[30:04] five-fold ministry, if you value them,
[30:08] you'll show respect.
[30:10] That's why people in a home church,
[30:13] if they're going to be out,
[30:17] they'll send the pastor a note. Yeah.
[30:20] Because they value the ministry
[30:24] and they'll send a note. That's right.
[30:26] And every one of you that call this your
[30:28] home church, do that. And many of you,
[30:32] if it's Sunday morning and you think I'm
[30:35] under the anointing, you'll send it to
[30:38] one of the deacons
[30:42] because you value your
[30:44] relationship in the home church and you
[30:48] value your relationship with the pastor
[30:51] or the ministry that would be there that
[30:52] day. Yes.
[30:54] Yes.
[30:56] Praise God. Exodus
[31:00] 2:25. Here we see how God values
[31:04] something and he shows respects. And God
[31:08] looked upon the children of Israel. Did
[31:10] he value
[31:11] them? And God
[31:14] had
[31:17] respects unto them.
[31:20] God had respects unto the children of
[31:22] Israel because they were his chosen
[31:23] people and they were the people that he
[31:25] was going to minister through in the Old
[31:28] Testament. And so when God looked upon
[31:34] them, he was
[31:37] respectful. Watch here what the prophet
[31:39] says in the blind barus. He says we must
[31:41] come with reverence and with respect.
[31:43] And the reason the spirit is not
[31:46] operating in the church the way it is
[31:48] among these people is
[31:50] because a lot of it is because
[31:53] of irreverence
[31:56] which is no respect.
[32:00] They don't respect it. And you've got to
[32:03] respect anything God sends you. See, no
[32:07] matter what it is, if you got respects
[32:10] to it, it'll get good from it. See then
[32:14] anytime that you respect it,
[32:18] see
[32:20] honor the definition or the meaning of
[32:23] honor or or value but let's go into the
[32:27] definition of honor is to you know from
[32:30] the dictionary is to pay high
[32:33] respects or great esteem.
[32:38] We honor our mothers today. Yes. So we
[32:42] show great respects, high
[32:44] respects and great esteem. Value is
[32:49] one's judgment is important or the
[32:53] importance of the person or your worth
[32:57] of the what you're valuing.
[33:00] So for you to show respects to God or
[33:03] God's people or God's ministry or God's
[33:06] prophet or whoever you want to do, you
[33:09] have to see its worth and its importance
[33:13] and its judgment, the value of their
[33:17] opinion. Other
[33:19] words, you just pick up the mat and
[33:22] sweep the dirt under
[33:24] it. Amen. Here we see in
[33:28] Exodus 20:12, "Honor thy father and
[33:33] mother, that thy days may belong upon
[33:37] the land which the Lord thy God has
[33:40] given you." That honor is
[33:45] respect. Amen.
[33:48] Watch what the prophet
[33:50] says in the next quote in questions and
[33:53] answers. He said if a family
[33:57] loses its respect for the family and the
[34:02] children loses its respect for
[34:05] parents, that family is tore into
[34:09] pieces.
[34:11] If the church ever loses
[34:14] respects for its
[34:16] pastor while that
[34:19] church is
[34:21] gone. And if the
[34:24] nation ever loses
[34:27] respects of the Supreme
[34:30] Court and its
[34:33] decisions, that nation
[34:37] is gone.
[34:39] Do you see the
[34:41] importance of respects? You know, our
[34:44] prophet clearly taught us, and I don't
[34:46] have this in in down, Vicki, but our
[34:48] prophet clearly taught us that this was
[34:50] a me age. Yes, sir. And it was what was
[34:53] good for me. And it was a selfies age.
[34:57] And so we don't value nothing that ain't
[35:00] me. We don't honor nothing that ain't
[35:02] me. Amen. And so we have respect for
[35:05] nothing. That's right. But me. That's
[35:07] right.
[35:10] That's right.
[35:14] Not one time in this scripture or the
[35:16] prophet and I I I I I'm sure I have 30
[35:19] quotes I'm going to bring up here did
[35:21] did
[35:22] honor value or
[35:26] respects come with that you had to
[35:29] agree.
[35:32] Yeah, that's right. I mean every
[35:33] marriage in this place has
[35:35] disagreements.
[35:37] Yeah. So, we just dropped the gloves and
[35:40] that would kind of be a broken home.
[35:44] See, honor ain't based on agreeing.
[35:47] That's right. Value ain't based on
[35:49] agreeing.
[35:50] And respects ain't based on agreeing.
[35:56] Your kids, when you're giving them the
[35:58] good
[35:59] oldfashioned switch, may vividly
[36:02] disagree with
[36:04] you, but they still have to respect you.
[36:08] And when your kids grow old, they may
[36:09] dividly disagree with the old parents
[36:12] that got white hair.
[36:15] But God still requires respects.
[36:20] Amen. Proverbs
[36:23] 31:10,28 and 30. Why, who can find a
[36:26] virtuous woman for his price is high,
[36:30] far above rubies. Now watch how this
[36:34] value is in
[36:37] respects for a virtuous woman. Her
[36:40] children rise
[36:42] up and call her blessed. You might as
[36:46] well say her children rise up and
[36:48] respect her. Yeah.
[36:52] But watch how the scripture and I want
[36:53] to paraphrase this scripture, but and it
[36:56] says, "And her husband also,"
[36:59] that means that her husband also rises
[37:01] up and calls her blessed.
[37:08] And if you were calling your wife
[37:10] blessed or the children were calling
[37:13] their mother blessed, another way to say
[37:16] it would be respect.
[37:19] Yeah, that's right.
[37:22] And they praise
[37:24] her. Favor is deceitful and beauty is
[37:27] vain, but a woman that fearth the Lord.
[37:31] Now watch this. You know, we have to we
[37:33] have to dovetail all the scriptures. The
[37:36] Bible says that God's not given us a
[37:38] spirit of fear, but of love, power, and
[37:40] it's our mind. So why does he put fear
[37:42] in there?
[37:44] Because that word don't mean fear at
[37:45] all. That's right. Amen. Are you with
[37:49] me? Now, am I am I changing the
[37:51] scriptures? Well, that's your choice to
[37:53] believe that. But see, God don't teach
[37:55] us to fear anything.
[37:58] God's not given us a spirit of fear, but
[38:00] of love, power, and a sound mind. So,
[38:03] this fear here is a woman that fearth
[38:06] the
[38:07] Lord is respective.
[38:10] Respects the Lord.
[38:13] That's right. The Lord, the woman
[38:15] respects the Lord and it's shown in
[38:18] honor and dignity and value
[38:22] in
[38:23] fear. See, if I lose my wallet, I'm
[38:27] fearful if I got full of
[38:29] money. So, most times I wouldn't have to
[38:32] be
[38:33] fearful. I mean, other than my driver's
[38:36] license and all the headache that would
[38:37] come with that. But you see what I'm
[38:39] saying? Yeah. You know, you that's such
[38:42] a simple example, but you know, if you
[38:44] walked up town to go to the new ice
[38:46] cream store that's going to be uptown
[38:48] and you seen any value in money at all
[38:53] and it was on the curb. Yes. You would
[38:56] reach down and pick it up.
[39:00] Unless you lived in Venezuela.
[39:04] And that's because there's value in
[39:05] money.
[39:07] And the reason you would take the effort
[39:09] to bend down when you might need your
[39:11] kid to straighten you back out is
[39:13] because you respect the value in that
[39:15] money.
[39:19] So in Venezuela, inflation is so high
[39:22] they use the street sweepers to sweep up
[39:25] the money and people cross and walk
[39:27] through it because it's of no value.
[39:31] Amen.
[39:34] That's why in the flesh when you have no
[39:39] value in something or someone, you walk
[39:42] on them.
[39:50] That's right. Just like the money in
[39:52] Venezuela.
[39:54] You can just Google that and you'll see
[39:57] people crossing the street walking
[39:59] through leaves. That's money. Just like
[40:01] we would on a fall day with money.
[40:05] Amen. So we see the value of a
[40:09] woman that
[40:11] respects the Lord. See that woman values
[40:17] God.
[40:19] That's why a sinner can curse God's name
[40:22] in vain
[40:24] because they have zero value. That's
[40:26] right. To the name of God. Amen. Yeah,
[40:29] that's right. Here the prophet, if
[40:31] you're following me, Vicki, but in the
[40:33] power of
[40:34] transformation, he says, "I don't care
[40:36] what my wife," and he stops there. He
[40:39] says, "I would respect any loyal
[40:46] woman." The next one there in my life
[40:50] story. So now, a good woman is a jewel
[40:53] and a man's crown. Now, a lot of these
[40:54] quotes I put under the scriptures
[40:57] because they're dovetailed with the
[40:58] scripture that we just read above them.
[41:01] Amen. A lot of them you can do that
[41:03] because of the message
[41:04] of a good woman is a jew man's crown and
[41:08] she should be honored. And what do we
[41:10] say honor is?
[41:12] Respect. And my
[41:14] mother a woman and my wife is. And
[41:19] they're lovely. And I got thousands of
[41:22] Christian sisters here who I
[41:26] highly
[41:29] respect. But if they can respect what
[41:31] God made them, a motherhood, a real
[41:36] queen, that's all right. And she's one
[41:39] of the best things that God could give a
[41:41] man was a wife. Besides salvation, a
[41:44] wife is the best thing. She is a good
[41:48] wife. And if you got a wife,
[41:51] brother, you ought to
[41:55] be respectful.
[42:01] If you got a good wife, brother, you're
[42:03] not copying right off my
[42:05] iPad. You are. Okay. Yep. I'm sorry. I'm
[42:08] just I'm sorry because I had the word
[42:11] rope in capital letters.
[42:14] And if you got a good wife, brother, you
[42:16] ought to respect her with the highest.
[42:20] That's right. You should do that. A real
[42:24] woman. And children, if you got a real
[42:27] mother that stays home and tries to take
[42:29] care of you and keeping your coke clean
[42:31] and sends you to school and teaching you
[42:33] about Jesus, you should honor that sweet
[42:37] old mother with all that's in you. See,
[42:41] you
[42:42] should
[42:45] Respect that woman. Yes, sir. Because
[42:49] she's
[42:51] a real mother.
[42:54] The next quote there, if she's a lady, a
[42:57] real lady, any
[42:59] man will respect. You know, it used to
[43:02] be in Brother Bam's day, and you really
[43:04] older people here will remember, but
[43:06] Brother Bam talks about on the tapes
[43:08] when they would cross a lady on the
[43:10] street, a man would tip his hot. It used
[43:14] to be that ladies didn't know what door
[43:15] car door handles were used for because
[43:18] the men always open the car handle door
[43:21] for their wife. As far as the wife knew,
[43:24] that if she touched the car handle door,
[43:25] it might start and drive away on her
[43:27] toes because she was highly respected.
[43:31] That's why it was always a man that held
[43:34] the door at the grocery store or better
[43:37] yet the flower store or the jewelry
[43:40] store
[43:41] to let your wife run in and spend your
[43:45] paycheck because you
[43:48] respected her
[43:50] stand. It was a
[43:52] woman. It was the morals of a good
[43:55] quality woman. And that's the way I
[43:57] think it must be is amongst the
[44:00] brethren. Brethren who sees someone
[44:03] somebody that's
[44:05] convinced I have the same respect for
[44:08] brethren who might disagree with me and
[44:10] I would say certainly I would respect
[44:14] his and he stops the paragraph there.
[44:18] Now, if we go to our next scripture, 1
[44:20] Peter 2 and 17, it it says here, it
[44:25] says, "Honor all
[44:26] men and love the
[44:29] brotherhood." And here we go
[44:31] again.
[44:35] Fear. Does God want us to fear him?
[44:40] No. You wives, you mothers, does your
[44:44] husband want you to fear them? No. If
[44:47] they do, he's got a warped head and our
[44:52] God don't have a warped head. That fear
[44:54] is respect.
[44:56] Love the brotherhood and respect God and
[45:00] honor the
[45:02] king. Now, that's Bible. But we're
[45:05] living in a day where
[45:11] respects Amen.
[45:15] The young people have grown up with no
[45:18] respect for teachers, no respect for bus
[45:21] drivers, no respect for
[45:25] policemen, just plain no
[45:29] respect. Like you might disagree with
[45:32] the, you know, the government or the
[45:34] policemen or you might say he was
[45:36] speeding and you weren't speaking. But
[45:38] his office demands respect. If that you
[45:42] may go to court and tell the judge that
[45:44] policeman was dead
[45:46] wrong, but when that boy pulls you
[45:50] over if you show disrespect to him, you
[45:53] can be assured you're getting two
[45:55] tickets instead of one.
[45:57] So if you want to show disrespect to a
[46:00] policeman, wait till you get to
[46:04] court and then you can do it in front of
[46:07] the
[46:08] judge. Amen. Ephesians 5:21, submitting
[46:13] ourselves. We love, us men love the
[46:15] scriptures, wives, submit yourselves
[46:18] unto your own husband. Bless God. We
[46:20] have that one memorized. Hallelujah. On
[46:23] the bus. Well, glory. Hallelujah. Just
[46:27] in case you were wondering, God put this
[46:28] scripture first.
[46:32] For all you men that got headship all
[46:35] mixed up, submitting yourselves one to
[46:37] another. And uh uh-oh, there we go
[46:41] again.
[46:43] So, I'll just give you a little pinch
[46:45] preview for all you men that think your
[46:48] wife should uh uh you know uh submit
[46:52] yourself to you. Do you submit yourself
[46:54] to her?
[46:57] Well, I mean, I'm just reading the
[46:59] Bible. It's just a couple verses above
[47:01] it. Now, I mean, we can cherrypick the
[47:04] Bible if you want.
[47:08] Come on.
[47:11] Submitting yourselves one to another.
[47:13] You know, brother Bam said when you pray
[47:15] that you your prayers would be none and
[47:17] void unless you could fit yourself in
[47:20] that person's situation.
[47:24] So you could see a mother in the church
[47:26] that's like, let me use my own family
[47:28] for example, like my wife when she had
[47:31] six kids under nine. Was that her fault?
[47:34] Wasn't her fault. She never got those
[47:36] kids. Those were my
[47:38] kids. She had very little to do with
[47:41] it. I mean, other than specifically
[47:44] asking to sit beside me in the church
[47:46] pew that I had saved for my brother, but
[47:49] beyond that, it was all downhill for
[47:50] her.
[47:56] You see, I wasn't enough of a man to ask
[47:58] to sit beside her. So, she had to come
[48:00] and ask to sit beside me. But I soon
[48:03] became a man after
[48:05] that.
[48:08] Whoa. But you see what I mean? So if you
[48:11] see a mother or something, let's go back
[48:13] to our example, and she's overwhelmed
[48:15] with her family, you can't have respect
[48:18] for her because you're not putting
[48:21] yourself in her position. So you become
[48:22] a judge. Yeah. Oh, that loser. Why did
[48:26] doesn't she know
[48:29] about Well, I would never.
[48:33] That's because you don't value
[48:35] motherhood.
[48:37] You don't value that. She never even put
[48:39] herself in this position. Yes.
[48:46] I mean, I've never yet seen a woman have
[48:48] a baby except for Christ without a man.
[48:56] And so to put everything on the mother
[49:00] is just
[49:02] a lack of understanding.
[49:07] And you need to hear that from a
[49:09] minister because when you get to heaven,
[49:11] you can blame your wife or all the
[49:14] mothers in church all you want, but
[49:16] God's going to lay it right on the
[49:19] head. And he's going to go, "Guess what,
[49:22] you little
[49:24] squirt? I'm putting all the blame on
[49:27] you. She's innocent.
[49:31] We don't like those. I don't like them.
[49:35] Everything that went wrong in my family,
[49:37] God will blame me."
[49:39] 100%.
[49:40] That's unfair.
[49:43] Still the way it is.
[49:45] It's still the way it is.
[49:50] So, see, there's things in the scripture
[49:52] that we may not understand, may not even
[49:54] agree with, for sure, not understand,
[49:57] but we still need to value
[50:00] and honor.
[50:03] God's decision.
[50:06] And in our day, people struggle with
[50:08] that.
[50:11] Amen. Our next quote on respects and and
[50:15] brother Brown preached this here in the
[50:18] end of 61 and
[50:20] that and because God is God, he deserves
[50:24] respects. See, you don't have to agree
[50:27] with him. You may strongly disagree,
[50:30] maybe not even understand
[50:33] him, but you have to respect him. That's
[50:37] right. And if we got respects for him
[50:40] and give and give a fear to him, there's
[50:44] respects again. He's just saying it a
[50:46] different word. But the meaning of the
[50:48] fear there, we're not our prophet never
[50:50] ever taught us there's no fear in love.
[50:53] So we love God, not
[50:56] fear. And that brings respect. And God
[51:00] has
[51:02] demanded for himself and for all his
[51:06] servants
[51:08] God demands respects for his servants
[51:11] and he and his servants and and that's
[51:13] everybody that's not just servants. And
[51:15] how we would
[51:16] know that they are his servants is
[51:19] because he vindicates his servants by
[51:21] his
[51:23] word. And he takes these servants and
[51:27] makes them servants of God and proves
[51:29] that they are servants by making his
[51:32] word work through them servants. And
[51:35] when you respect that servant, you're
[51:38] respecting God. So when you resp when I
[51:42] respect
[51:44] you and you respect me and we respect
[51:48] each other,
[51:50] then we're
[51:52] respecting God.
[51:55] That's right. See, this was the prophet,
[51:59] our prophet. And watch how he ends this.
[52:02] And when you re when I he makes
[52:05] this too personal to himself. And when I
[52:08] respect you and you respect me, respect
[52:13] each other. And we respect each other.
[52:15] We respect God. We're respecting God.
[52:18] That's right. Amen. Did not Jesus say,
[52:21] "In so much as ye have done it to the
[52:23] least of these, my little ones, you've
[52:25] done it unto me." And watch this.
[52:28] Anytime you want to get arrogant and
[52:31] show a lack of value and honor and
[52:35] respects, remember, just remember that
[52:38] person has an
[52:40] angel. And what you do to that angel, he
[52:44] tells right back in the front of God's
[52:46] face in the throne.
[52:48] And you're liable for the wrath of God.
[52:52] I'm going to show you an example right
[52:54] out of our prophet in this last age
[52:57] where that happened where somebody
[52:59] refused to show respect to a messenger
[53:01] Martin
[53:02] Luther and the angel always their angel
[53:06] always holds my father's faith which is
[53:09] in heaven and now you know that they are
[53:12] and we are being the children of God and
[53:14] if you're a part of God then god demands
[53:18] respect just think of that the next time
[53:20] you want to give somebody a tongue lash
[53:23] God's angel will hear it and God's angel
[53:26] will take it to God. Now, if if I mean,
[53:30] if you're completely on the word of God
[53:32] and lined up with the the Bible and the
[53:35] message, Brother Bam said many times
[53:38] that it killed him. But he said, "I'm
[53:41] forced to say with the word."
[53:44] So, Brother Bam said thousands of things
[53:46] that people hated,
[53:49] but he said, "I'm forced to say with the
[53:50] word. Yeah. Psalms 12 and1. Praise ye
[53:55] the Lord, and blessed it is a man that
[53:59] respects the Lord. Now, I've changed it
[54:01] from the man that fearth the Lord,
[54:04] but respects the Lord, cuz we know we're
[54:07] not to fear the God,
[54:11] and he delightth in his commandments.
[54:14] So, we would delight in God's
[54:16] commandments and obedience. So when God
[54:18] says you should live this way, dress
[54:20] this way, we say glory, hallelujah. I
[54:22] respect that because we know that he's
[54:26] Jehovah. Amen.
[54:29] Amen. And there Matthew 7 and 12. And
[54:33] therefore all things whatsoever ye know
[54:36] that man should do to you, do ye even so
[54:40] unto them. For this is the law of the
[54:43] prophets. Now, this when I was a little
[54:46] kid was called the golden rule.
[54:51] Amen.
[54:53] So, if you don't want people to poke fun
[54:54] at you,
[54:58] Amen. So, you know, when the young kids
[55:00] grow up, as much as you want to tease
[55:02] your little siblings, remember they'll
[55:04] grow up too someday.
[55:08] Respect and treating others as you would
[55:10] like to be treated. do unto others as
[55:13] you would have them
[55:15] do unto
[55:17] you. God help us here in another quote
[55:21] of the the respects the prophet we said
[55:24] he preached it multiple times but I say
[55:27] my servant
[55:28] Moses I now I I'm just paraphrasing this
[55:32] I'm not trying to like change the
[55:33] meaning it's just I could put a whole
[55:35] page on here but it's a little
[55:37] big's talking about when Moses sister
[55:40] made fun of him and never respected
[55:44] him see God was a fool
[55:49] But she did because it was God that told
[55:51] Moses to do what she did.
[55:55] See, you may think God's a fool, but
[56:00] but
[56:03] see, he's God and and I'm just your
[56:06] brother.
[56:09] But I said, "My servant Moses, I sleep
[56:13] lip to ear to
[56:15] him and said, "Don't you respect God?" I
[56:20] know it says fear, but it means respect.
[56:24] In other words, you talk about Moses and
[56:27] you're talking about me.
[56:30] Amen. Oh, thank you, brother Carson.
[56:31] Thank you very much. I don't know why
[56:33] I'm Thank you. So when we talk about our
[56:36] brothers and sisters, forget the
[56:37] ministry. We're a brother. When brother
[56:39] Bram the ministry is different when
[56:41] they're behind the pulpit because
[56:43] they're a servant of God. But when I
[56:45] step off the that's only my calling. But
[56:48] when I step off this pulpit, I'm your
[56:49] brother. You're my brother. There's no
[56:52] it just a calling. That's right. Like a
[56:54] mother.
[56:56] So when we speak evil against one
[56:59] another,
[57:01] you're talking about God.
[57:04] And if you can't respect Moses, then you
[57:07] don't respect God. That's right.
[57:10] And it said, "Haven't I proved among you
[57:13] that he's my servant and you have no
[57:17] reverence for
[57:18] him at all?"
[57:22] What would what what what that would be
[57:25] a lesson to the people? Thank you,
[57:27] brother. The Thank you. Thank you.
[57:32] What would be a lesson for the people of
[57:35] this day? No
[57:37] respects and no honor. Now, I just want
[57:40] to share a little thought with you. I'm
[57:42] just stepping up. This is not a prophet.
[57:44] If brother Brown could say that there
[57:46] was no respects in the beginning of the
[57:49] 60s
[57:52] and the end of the 50s,
[57:59] maybe he would come back again and
[58:01] preach respects every service
[58:08] because if you just read the scriptures
[58:11] in the beginning of
[58:12] Revelations of Leosa. It says, "He that
[58:15] hath an ear, let him hear what God says
[58:19] to the churches." You're gonna think I
[58:21] No, but the spirit, but God is the
[58:23] spirit, and they that worship him must
[58:25] worship him. What God says to the
[58:27] churches, and it says, "I'm rich. I'm
[58:30] increased with goods. I got everything
[58:33] under
[58:34] control. I got a great
[58:37] education. I don't need to come to
[58:39] church. I definitely don't need your
[58:42] advice.
[58:43] I definitely don't need the headship up
[58:45] of a
[58:46] ministry. I'm for sure not going to ask
[58:48] my pastor any
[58:51] questions cuz I got it all under
[58:56] control. And you know what our prophet
[58:58] said about that and I don't have it
[58:59] down. He
[59:02] says, "I would doubt your experience at
[59:04] all and you would need your brains
[59:06] baptized."
[59:09] You know, the greatest time I missed my
[59:11] daddy, he was 86, almost 87 when he died
[59:15] is in the winter time. Cuz it was
[59:18] snowing and cold. I just go down and sit
[59:20] at the kitchen table and mom would put
[59:22] on a coffee and we'd sit there. I didn't
[59:26] really go for no
[59:31] reason, but I might bounce a couple
[59:33] things off him. And I valued
[59:38] his
[59:39] years of longevity.
[59:44] He came through the depression. He was
[59:47] born in
[59:48] 28. So he's seen all of the 30s.
[59:57] And I have those memories tattooed in my
[1:00:00] brain.
[1:00:02] What he went through.
[1:00:05] Don't be so sure that we won't relive
[1:00:07] those before we live this world.
[1:00:12] We are fastly
[1:00:14] heading in that direction.
[1:00:19] I don't mean to be I'm just I'm just
[1:00:22] telling you. You say, "Well, that'll
[1:00:24] never happen again." Be careful. Say
[1:00:26] that'll never happen to me. Be careful.
[1:00:31] That's why people can drive fast on the
[1:00:32] road. to say, "Well, you know, that's
[1:00:34] why people can drive fast on ice. Well,
[1:00:35] that'll never happen to me. I'm a good
[1:00:36] driver." Oh, you've got to be kidding.
[1:00:39] Like, and what kind of insanity is that?
[1:00:42] Rubber tires on ice. Oh, bless God. I
[1:00:46] got They got the snow mark on
[1:00:48] them. Well, they don't have skate blades
[1:00:50] on them.
[1:00:53] Like when I wanted to stop when I was on
[1:00:55] the ice rink, I slid sideways. Mhm.
[1:01:00] You see how we get so arrogant?
[1:01:05] We got her all under control. That's the
[1:01:08] spirit. Now, I know we're in the bride
[1:01:10] age because we're not of this world. But
[1:01:13] if you're not living in Leosia, you're
[1:01:15] rubbing tight shoulders with it.
[1:01:18] Okay? I I know you know only in the
[1:01:21] Bible is recorded the Leoian age. And
[1:01:24] also remember if you're rejecting the
[1:01:26] ministry, the ages, remember that the
[1:01:29] age rejected Christ. That's right. The
[1:01:33] only
[1:01:34] age, the only age where Christ is on the
[1:01:37] outside saying, "I sure wish you'd come
[1:01:39] to church so I could tell you a couple
[1:01:41] things."
[1:01:43] And Christ had the spirit. He said, "Oh
[1:01:45] Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem,
[1:01:48] I would have put you under my wings like
[1:01:50] a henwood chicks. Yeah. But you would
[1:01:53] not.
[1:01:55] You know why you would not? Because you
[1:01:57] didn't need the wings. You didn't need
[1:01:59] the mother.
[1:02:01] Because see, you're self-sufficient.
[1:02:06] He said that would be a lesson for
[1:02:07] people today because there's no
[1:02:11] respects and no honor.
[1:02:14] And now he said because you don't do
[1:02:17] that the reason that you got leprosy is
[1:02:21] the reason things has went said because
[1:02:25] you ought to have known that this was my
[1:02:29] servant and do you know it so when you
[1:02:31] say something against him you're saying
[1:02:34] it against me and so Moses prayed for
[1:02:37] his sister for God to spare her life and
[1:02:41] God did let her go out and wait the 8
[1:02:44] days. I believe it was 8 days or or
[1:02:46] however many days. But here the prophet
[1:02:48] says even though God healed her after
[1:02:51] her time of leprosy, whatever the number
[1:02:53] of days it was, he said she
[1:02:57] still didn't live very long
[1:03:00] afterwards, she
[1:03:02] died, but she didn't get clearance from
[1:03:06] But she did get clearance from her
[1:03:08] leprosy that was out of the camp 7 days.
[1:03:10] Okay, that's how far she was out.
[1:03:13] for the purification. But see, she even
[1:03:15] though God answered his prayer, the
[1:03:17] prophet's prayer, she he still killed
[1:03:19] her soon.
[1:03:22] And what was he trying to get them to
[1:03:24] was this? You've got to
[1:03:28] respect what God does.
[1:03:32] You got to respect what God does. And if
[1:03:35] that was the attitude of people
[1:03:38] today and God can't sorry and if that
[1:03:42] was the attitude of God in that day and
[1:03:46] God can't change and God wants us to
[1:03:50] respect what he's doing. He demands
[1:03:54] it and you'll either respect
[1:03:57] it that or something else is going to
[1:04:00] happen. See, that's why nobody comes to
[1:04:04] church on Wednesday night,
[1:04:07] cuz you don't value God.
[1:04:10] You definitely don't value prayer.
[1:04:13] And for sure you don't value getting
[1:04:15] together.
[1:04:19] Well, like what else could be the
[1:04:21] reason? You know, me and my wife were
[1:04:23] talking about last Sunday when we went
[1:04:25] home or maybe it was Wednesday. We have
[1:04:27] these talks after Wednesday service.
[1:04:29] said, "You know, when we were little,
[1:04:31] and let me just tell you something. We
[1:04:33] went to different denominations,
[1:04:34] different churches. There was no
[1:04:36] connection at all. And believe me, I
[1:04:38] never seen her. I would have been
[1:04:38] married a lot younger than I
[1:04:40] was. A lot
[1:04:45] younger." And we would start revival
[1:04:47] services on Friday night. Be Friday
[1:04:49] night, Saturday night, Sunday morning,
[1:04:51] Sunday night, Monday night, Tuesday
[1:04:53] night, Wednesday night, Thursday night,
[1:04:54] Friday night, Saturday night, Sunday,
[1:04:56] and Sunday night.
[1:04:59] and the church would be packed and they
[1:05:02] never had the revealed word.
[1:05:09] So, you don't value the revealed word.
[1:05:12] You don't value the ministry
[1:05:15] because God speaks through the ministry
[1:05:16] or you don't even value prayer that that
[1:05:18] well, God won't answer it the way I
[1:05:20] want, so I don't like what God's doing.
[1:05:26] See how far society has
[1:05:28] went. You can see it in the the outside
[1:05:31] kids, but what about right in the uh
[1:05:37] uh Uh-huh. We have a book back there. It
[1:05:39] talks about the revival in the 60s and
[1:05:41] that in Indiana and that and that the
[1:05:43] dep the depressed people would mark the
[1:05:44] things people would come and and even
[1:05:46] our prophet wasn't there. talked about,
[1:05:49] do you know do you know in the one
[1:05:50] church in Indiana when they built the
[1:05:52] new church they put two spots for the
[1:05:54] ambulance and when the the public
[1:05:58] am town council can you imagine when
[1:06:01] they would pick somebody up in the
[1:06:03] ambulance they would give them an option
[1:06:04] we can take you to the hospital take you
[1:06:05] to church and get prayed for and the
[1:06:07] witnesses in there said on multiple
[1:06:09] multiple hundreds of occasions no
[1:06:11] prophet see you for all you people that
[1:06:14] worship the prophet God's still in his
[1:06:16] anointed ones And hundreds and hundreds
[1:06:19] of cases they would wheel the the the
[1:06:21] the the stretcher up the alley and he
[1:06:23] said they wouldn't make it halfway up
[1:06:24] and the people were climbing up watch
[1:06:26] them completely heal
[1:06:29] under one case. One case
[1:06:34] respect
[1:06:38] one one word one word covers it. Respect
[1:06:42] to God. Respect to his house. Respect to
[1:06:44] his people. Respect to the anointing.
[1:06:46] Respect to the move of the spirit.
[1:06:48] Respect. One word.
[1:06:51] That's right. That's why people would
[1:06:53] line up hours before services and they
[1:06:55] would say first night of revival, the
[1:06:57] church on the newspaper. They they
[1:06:59] actually in that book they has thousands
[1:07:01] of newspaper clippings. The church can
[1:07:03] only hold half the people that came an
[1:07:05] hour early. No problem with that in this
[1:07:08] age
[1:07:09] cuz no value, no honor, no respects.
[1:07:15] And see it it shows in the natural, but
[1:07:17] it shows that it just covers. It's just
[1:07:19] the spirit. It's just
[1:07:21] everywhere. It's why your kids come in
[1:07:23] and tell your wife off, your mom off or
[1:07:27] anything. That's why the kids go to
[1:07:29] school and tell the teacher off and
[1:07:31] swear at the bus driver. No honor, no
[1:07:34] value, no respects.
[1:07:39] You don't have to like the bus driver to
[1:07:41] ride on the bus. He's just getting you
[1:07:44] from point A to point B. You might
[1:07:46] actually dislike him greatly, but it's
[1:07:49] better than walking.
[1:07:52] Romans 13:1-7, "Let every soul be
[1:07:56] subject unto a higher power." You
[1:07:58] thought I was making that
[1:07:59] up. That's not the age that we're living
[1:08:04] in. Let every soul be subject to a
[1:08:07] higher power. How do you get out from
[1:08:08] underneath that? God sent me a divine
[1:08:10] revelation. How are you subject to a
[1:08:13] higher
[1:08:14] power? And there is no power but God.
[1:08:17] The powers that be ordained of God,
[1:08:20] ordained, men of God or ordained, born
[1:08:23] ordained. A prophet, you know, we were
[1:08:25] reading a few Sundays ago that the
[1:08:27] ministry was dead and they were still
[1:08:31] ministers. Amen. Whosoever resists this
[1:08:34] power resist the ordinance of God. Now,
[1:08:38] in this age, we have a major headship
[1:08:40] problem.
[1:08:45] That's right. I mean, if you don't think
[1:08:47] so, why is there so many wars?
[1:08:52] Well, let me rephrase that. Why is there
[1:08:54] so many civil wars?
[1:08:58] That's not even a country with another
[1:08:59] country. But civil wars is I sit under
[1:09:02] your government.
[1:09:04] I've had those thoughts lately, but I
[1:09:07] can't find another city that wasn't
[1:09:09] built by Abraham or by God. Like, I'm
[1:09:11] like Abraham. I'm looking for a city.
[1:09:13] Where did God make a city on earth?
[1:09:16] Believe me, if I find it, I'm going
[1:09:18] there.
[1:09:20] And I'm going to go really soon. It's
[1:09:21] called the rapture.
[1:09:23] It's called heaven.
[1:09:26] Oh, wow. Come quickly, Lord Jesus. I
[1:09:30] pray. Whosoever resists the power,
[1:09:33] resisteth the ordinance of God. So, so
[1:09:36] you can say, "Well, I don't need a
[1:09:37] ministry." That's fine. But then you
[1:09:39] don't need parents.
[1:09:41] You don't even need a mother. You don't
[1:09:43] need a father, but you don't need a
[1:09:44] policeman.
[1:09:46] See, this is an open book. If you resist
[1:09:48] one, then you have a spirit of
[1:09:50] resistance.
[1:09:52] Doesn't matter to me. If you resist me,
[1:09:54] I was here before you were here.
[1:09:57] But you you're going to resist your
[1:09:59] parents. You're going to resist the
[1:10:01] policeman that pulls you over on the way
[1:10:02] home. You're going to resist the
[1:10:04] judge. You're going to resist the
[1:10:06] government that you didn't vote in. Or
[1:10:07] maybe you
[1:10:09] did. See, it's resistance. The ordinance
[1:10:13] of God, you know, nobody gets into power
[1:10:16] except God allows it. See, so it's a me.
[1:10:19] So, it's a res I don't like that. Well,
[1:10:21] I don't either. But God allowed it.
[1:10:23] That's right. God allowed it.
[1:10:26] And they resist. And they that resist
[1:10:28] this shall receive of themsself.
[1:10:35] That now like
[1:10:38] you wonder why God laid this on my
[1:10:39] heart. It's not cuz I picked it.
[1:10:44] Yeah. That that's about as strong a
[1:10:46] words as you can get. Sure is.
[1:10:50] You kids, you resist your mother's
[1:10:53] authority, you resist your dad's
[1:10:55] authority, damnation. You resist the
[1:10:57] teacher's authority. She's not teaching
[1:10:59] you because she cares. She already knows
[1:11:01] what the lesson is. That's right. If you
[1:11:03] want to be your whole life,
[1:11:05] look at me. I just didn't have the
[1:11:07] capability to learn.
[1:11:13] You see, people try to give you things
[1:11:15] and it's not because it's going to a
[1:11:17] teacher ain't giving you learning
[1:11:19] because she needs to learn. She's
[1:11:21] already learned it. That's right. That's
[1:11:23] right. That's right. Amen. Amen. The
[1:11:26] parents try to say, "If you go this way,
[1:11:28] I lived through the dirty 30s and
[1:11:30] inflation could hit again and you can go
[1:11:34] home and mock them to your lap, but it's
[1:11:36] damnation." That's right. And also, does
[1:11:39] God have ministry that comes in and
[1:11:42] says, "This is exactly where it is." And
[1:11:45] in our age, God sent a prophet. So,
[1:11:47] we're double blessed because we have the
[1:11:49] we have the Bible revealed and what the
[1:11:51] prophet said about it.
[1:11:57] damnation. God help God help me. God
[1:12:01] help me. For the rulers rulers are not a
[1:12:06] tear of good works, but to evil, and
[1:12:10] wilt thou not be afraid of the
[1:12:13] power? Do that which is good, and thou
[1:12:16] shalt have praise of the saint. for he
[1:12:19] is a minister of God to thee for
[1:12:24] good. The only case that that wouldn't
[1:12:26] apply is if a man was building his own
[1:12:29] kingdom and he was just off the word of
[1:12:31] God and off the message.
[1:12:35] That's why the brother Brandham said he
[1:12:37] said you know when he go questions
[1:12:38] answer he said I'll answer these the
[1:12:40] best of my ability. But now in our age
[1:12:42] we can say I'll you can answer a
[1:12:45] question with an answer. Here's the
[1:12:47] scripture and here's what the prophet
[1:12:49] said.
[1:12:51] And it doesn't matter what Dale's
[1:12:53] opinion is
[1:12:55] because I'm just I'm If I'm preaching my
[1:12:57] opinion, well, we're all lost. Yeah. But
[1:13:00] if I'm a preaching what the word says
[1:13:03] and the revealed word. That's right. But
[1:13:05] if thou doeth that which is evil, be
[1:13:08] afraid. For he beareth not the sword in
[1:13:12] vain. for he is a minister of God, and
[1:13:14] revenge is executed, wrath upon them
[1:13:17] that doeth evil. Therefore, ye must the
[1:13:20] deeds be subject, and not only by for
[1:13:23] wrath, but also for conscience sake. For
[1:13:27] this cause, pay tribute also, for they
[1:13:30] are God's ministers, attending
[1:13:33] continually upon this very thing. Render
[1:13:36] therefore their all their dues and
[1:13:39] tribute to them tribute that is due and
[1:13:42] custom to whom custom is due and respect
[1:13:46] to whom respect is due and honor to whom
[1:13:51] honor is due. Now here in this scripture
[1:13:54] the very next verse brother Bram says be
[1:13:57] real and identifying of all ages of
[1:14:00] Christ 64 be real reverent. You see, you
[1:14:04] must respect the Holy
[1:14:06] Spirit. Respects. The only way you'll
[1:14:09] ever get anything from God is respect
[1:14:12] this
[1:14:13] message. Respect it.
[1:14:20] That's right. Amen. Exodus 12:13. And
[1:14:25] the blood shall be unto you as a token.
[1:14:28] Now that token, a token is like a
[1:14:30] vouchure of
[1:14:32] value. A token is when you get on the
[1:14:35] bus. Well, you know, watch this. When
[1:14:37] you cross the bridge now, they don't
[1:14:38] take
[1:14:39] cash. So, you can buy a book of tokens
[1:14:42] or you can have them
[1:14:44] plastic. I'm not sure what happens if
[1:14:46] your plastic don't
[1:14:50] work. Do you know that's actually
[1:14:52] unscriptural by the law of the land?
[1:14:53] Because a value by the law of our
[1:14:56] constitution is money is acceptable for
[1:14:59] an exchange of tokens of a value. So the
[1:15:03] government breaks their own laws. Yes,
[1:15:05] sir. But the blood shall be a token. See
[1:15:09] you. What I'm trying to show you is you
[1:15:11] have to value that blood. It's a it's a
[1:15:15] an avenue of
[1:15:17] respects. It's a voucher of value upon
[1:15:20] the house where ye are. And when I see
[1:15:23] the blood, when I see the respects, I
[1:15:27] will pass over you and the plague shall
[1:15:30] not be upon you and destroy you when I
[1:15:32] smite the land of
[1:15:33] Egypt. Watch out what the pro prophet
[1:15:36] says in the same message token. The
[1:15:39] exact same message 63. And it's the time
[1:15:42] to quit fussing with one another and
[1:15:45] believe the message of the Bible.
[1:15:47] Believe Jesus Christ. Love, honor, and
[1:15:51] respect another. Man, respect your
[1:15:55] wives, and you respect your homes.
[1:16:01] Amen. 1 Peter 1:18 and 19. For so much
[1:16:04] as you know that ye are not redeemed by
[1:16:07] corruptible things of silver and gold by
[1:16:09] your vain
[1:16:11] conversation received of tradition of
[1:16:13] your fathers from your fathers but of
[1:16:15] the precious blood of Jesus the lamb
[1:16:18] without blemish and without spot. The
[1:16:20] precious is value respect. Precious here
[1:16:24] watch what he says in respect. He says
[1:16:28] you can't respect God and you've got to
[1:16:32] respect God. You sorry, you can't
[1:16:35] disrespect God. Thank you, Vicki, for
[1:16:37] putting that up there. You can't
[1:16:39] disrespect God. You've got to respect
[1:16:41] God. And if you don't believe it, just
[1:16:44] keep still and keep away from it. If you
[1:16:46] don't believe this message and you don't
[1:16:48] believe the Bible, that's fine. Just
[1:16:50] don't say the wrong words
[1:16:54] or either do that or come reverently and
[1:16:58] respect it. Don't make fun of
[1:17:01] people that's in the
[1:17:04] spirit. Don't talk to people that's
[1:17:06] worshiping in the spirit of God. Let it
[1:17:09] alone. How could I stand with the
[1:17:11] testimony? Another excellent quote here.
[1:17:14] How could I stand with the testimony for
[1:17:17] the hour after hour that I've seen in my
[1:17:20] life what I've seen in other countries
[1:17:22] and other places and nations and so
[1:17:24] forth things that's taken place and omit
[1:17:27] this and just that you'll get the idea
[1:17:29] that I'm not trying to say to you, you
[1:17:32] must respect it.
[1:17:34] I've seen young people sit in the
[1:17:36] meetings and snicker and laugh and make
[1:17:38] fun of the meetings and the and the
[1:17:42] message and within 24 hours they were
[1:17:44] killed on the street in the car crash
[1:17:47] and other people sit in the meetings and
[1:17:49] within a year or so I would come back
[1:17:51] within 6 months come back to the same
[1:17:53] church in particular and every one of
[1:17:56] them would be gone dead stricken where
[1:17:59] somewhere with diseases and things. What
[1:18:03] is it? You have to respect
[1:18:07] the
[1:18:08] message. Corinthians 10:32 and
[1:18:12] 33. Give
[1:18:14] none
[1:18:15] offense, neither to Jew nor to Gentile,
[1:18:18] nor to the church of God. Give no
[1:18:21] offense to the church of God, even as I
[1:18:25] please as I as I please all men in all
[1:18:29] things, not seeking my own profit, but
[1:18:32] the profit of many, that they may be
[1:18:36] saved. Amen. See that we give no
[1:18:39] offense to anyone and for sure to the
[1:18:43] church of God. Here the prophet says, he
[1:18:46] said, "You show me a church that's real
[1:18:47] humble, really humble, not arrogant, a
[1:18:51] church that's just sweet and humble, and
[1:18:53] I'll show you a church that has the
[1:18:55] favor and power of God in it." That's
[1:18:57] right. That's what it takes. Humility,
[1:19:00] humbling ourselves before God and
[1:19:03] letting God work through us.
[1:19:07] Amen.
[1:19:08] Hallelujah. I want to read. We're going
[1:19:10] to close here just shortly. I just got a
[1:19:13] couple. Oh, a little bit. But I got a
[1:19:16] couple longer quotes here and I I might
[1:19:18] paraphrase them a bit. You can put them
[1:19:19] up. But there was a Miss Wee Weber,
[1:19:23] sorry, that was dying of
[1:19:26] TP TB,
[1:19:29] sorry. And brother Brennham had prayed
[1:19:31] for this lady and it was Grace was her
[1:19:35] first name. Grace Weber of
[1:19:38] Jeffersonville. She didn't live very far
[1:19:40] from the tabernacle. She had five or six
[1:19:43] kids. And the ang I want to show you
[1:19:45] what respects looks like. And the angel
[1:19:48] of the Lord had came to the prophet and
[1:19:51] he said, "Go to their
[1:19:54] family and to her husband and to her
[1:19:56] kids and say, get ready. You're a dad
[1:20:00] man. You're
[1:20:05] dying. You don't have long to
[1:20:08] live and you're going to die." The
[1:20:11] prophet had prayed for
[1:20:14] her and the angel came and he went and
[1:20:18] told the
[1:20:20] family that she will die and she will
[1:20:23] not live here. The one's body says till
[1:20:25] the
[1:20:27] morning. And she was at her work and
[1:20:31] said that the girls that were out at the
[1:20:33] government where she worked with her
[1:20:37] said there ain't nothing to that message
[1:20:40] or that guy and said he isn't nothing
[1:20:43] but a hypocrite.
[1:20:46] said, "That's just a religion is a bunch
[1:20:49] of a lot of fake
[1:20:52] fanaticism." And that Mrs. Weaver was
[1:20:55] sitting
[1:20:56] there and the angel of God, it said,
[1:20:59] "You'll be
[1:21:00] dead. You're dying." The angel of God
[1:21:04] said, "You're a dead person." And she
[1:21:07] said, "Look here. I know I'm dying and I
[1:21:12] know that I'm going to be dead soon, but
[1:21:15] I won't
[1:21:16] stand for that. I know better than
[1:21:20] that. Now, I'm paraphrasing some here,
[1:21:23] but she said, "I've grew up with this
[1:21:26] truth and I've seen God move
[1:21:30] and I know it's real and I'm testifying
[1:21:33] it's real going to my grave in the next
[1:21:36] very few days." And he said what
[1:21:40] happened
[1:21:41] was she had an
[1:21:44] angel and that angel had came to the
[1:21:47] prophet and said you're dying. But that
[1:21:50] angel heard her testify of the truth of
[1:21:54] God and respects to his word dying.
[1:21:59] What happened? The angel of the Lord
[1:22:01] heard that. And that very night I was
[1:22:04] sitting on the side of my chair in my
[1:22:06] room and he said, "I got up to get a
[1:22:08] drink of water and it was around 3:00 in
[1:22:10] the
[1:22:12] morning and I was sitting in the chair
[1:22:15] and the angel of the Lord walked in and
[1:22:18] he said, "Tomorrow, Sunday, they're
[1:22:20] going to bring Mrs. Weaver and she's
[1:22:22] going to be sitting in the back part of
[1:22:23] the church in the tabernacle." And he
[1:22:26] said, "I heard
[1:22:28] what she was said." And he said, "I want
[1:22:31] you to tell her I heard her.
[1:22:34] I heard what she said. And you can tell
[1:22:36] her, sayeth the Lord,
[1:22:40] she will live not die and not
[1:22:43] die in the presence
[1:22:46] there." And he said, "That was about
[1:22:48] seven years ago." And he said, "You can
[1:22:49] go check it
[1:22:51] out." And he said, "It was because she
[1:22:54] was taken
[1:22:56] up for the presence of God. She was
[1:23:00] defending the spirit of God. She
[1:23:04] wouldn't sit there and see people
[1:23:06] blaspheme and disrespect and
[1:23:10] devalue God. That's right. Even though
[1:23:14] she
[1:23:15] knew that God had said she would die.
[1:23:18] Watch what the prophet says at the end.
[1:23:20] He said, "And God had respects to her
[1:23:23] because she had respects unto what God
[1:23:27] was
[1:23:29] representing." And so God will do the
[1:23:31] same thing with you. Not respect me.
[1:23:34] Don't I don't you don't have to respect
[1:23:36] me, but to respect to him, to Christ,
[1:23:42] the one who died for your healing. And
[1:23:44] if you'll just respect him and his word,
[1:23:48] God will do the
[1:23:50] work for you. I want to It's amazing. My
[1:23:54] time is just flying. I got a couple
[1:23:56] quick examples if we can just blow
[1:23:58] through them here. In 2 Kings Kings 2:23
[1:24:03] and 25, we know that Elisha took over
[1:24:05] after Elijah. And I'm just paraphrasing
[1:24:07] this. And so Elijah was a small uh uh
[1:24:11] small not small but a new po uh prophet
[1:24:14] and uh you know we had a double portion
[1:24:16] from Elijah and you know the story and
[1:24:19] we got to speed up cuz I got more here
[1:24:21] than I thought. And those boys come out
[1:24:24] and mocked Elisha and brother Bram said
[1:24:27] it wasn't the boy's fault. He said it
[1:24:29] was because the parents at home were
[1:24:31] mocking the prophet. And he said,
[1:24:34] actually the parents at home didn't, the
[1:24:36] prophet says this multiple times. They
[1:24:38] said they didn't believe Elijah's
[1:24:40] message when he said that Elisha had
[1:24:44] been resurrected, the raptured. That's
[1:24:46] what they say. They said he didn't
[1:24:48] believe the message. And they mocked
[1:24:50] him. And I know brother Bam said dozens
[1:24:53] of
[1:24:54] times that when Elijah cursed those
[1:24:56] boys, it was not the spirit of the boys.
[1:25:00] But watch, I'm going to give you both
[1:25:02] sides of the page because a prophet said
[1:25:05] something else,
[1:25:07] too. And Elijah is a prophet. He said,
[1:25:11] "But God turned around and in Elijah, he
[1:25:14] cursed those children, God himself,
[1:25:21] because God demanded respects."
[1:25:24] So, I'm just going to show you something
[1:25:25] and you this can make you mad or just
[1:25:27] whatever it wants to. The prophet said
[1:25:28] it both ways. He said that wasn't the
[1:25:30] spirit of God that curse the boys. But
[1:25:32] here he said it was God working through
[1:25:33] Elisha and it was God that cursed them
[1:25:39] because God was mad that they didn't
[1:25:42] have respects to him.
[1:25:46] He says it right here in 58. If you can
[1:25:47] pull that up, Vicki, we need that.
[1:25:49] That's that's a Psalm. And Elisha the
[1:25:51] prophet 58 10:02 even. And God turned
[1:25:55] around and in Elijah the top row there
[1:25:58] and God in Elijah cursed those
[1:26:02] boys, the 42 of them and were killed by
[1:26:04] a bear think because they so
[1:26:07] disobedient. They were disobedient and
[1:26:09] been raised up in the wrong kind of home
[1:26:11] in the wrong schooling and made fun of
[1:26:13] God's prophet instead of respecting
[1:26:15] God's prophet. And I tell you, as you
[1:26:18] respect God's servants, you respect God.
[1:26:20] And as you respect Christ, you respect
[1:26:23] God. And now who is God major servant?
[1:26:28] Not no man here on earth. It's the Holy
[1:26:30] Ghost. And that's the one you're making
[1:26:33] fun of. That's the one the people are
[1:26:36] laughing at when you look at those
[1:26:38] people. Don't act don't don't they look
[1:26:41] act funny? Don't people act funny when
[1:26:44] the anointing of God's on them? And I
[1:26:46] believe they're a little bit
[1:26:48] crazy. When you do that, you're making
[1:26:51] fun of God. If you make fun, you know,
[1:26:54] we people would say, "Well, I don't
[1:26:56] believe in enthusiasm and I don't
[1:26:58] believe in a minister coming under the
[1:27:00] anointing enthusiasm. I just believe in
[1:27:02] just talking real normal like a teacher
[1:27:06] would teach and not show no
[1:27:10] emotion from the Holy Spirit." And
[1:27:13] brother Bam said, "That kind of
[1:27:15] religion, bury it because it's not real
[1:27:18] or alive." And he said multiple times, I
[1:27:22] forget the number, multiple times, I
[1:27:24] feel religious because he was under the
[1:27:26] anointing of the presence. And there was
[1:27:28] times even we read on Wednesday for
[1:27:29] those who come on Wednesday where the
[1:27:31] prophet got blessed in God's wilderness
[1:27:34] and ran around the tree and was like a
[1:27:36] maniac because our prophet believed in
[1:27:40] emotion. Yes, sir. And I believe in
[1:27:42] emotion. And you can dry up and die all
[1:27:45] you want. And I'll go to the mission
[1:27:46] field more often to see a guy that's got
[1:27:49] skin on it that can move.
[1:27:51] Because anything you value, you'll move
[1:27:54] for. Anything you have honor for, you'll
[1:27:57] move for. Anything you have respect for,
[1:27:59] you'll move for. That's right. But
[1:28:02] God Well,
[1:28:05] we're
[1:28:11] not here. Another quote he said, and I'm
[1:28:15] just I'm I'm going faster here. He said
[1:28:17] it was the parents didn't raise the
[1:28:20] children up to respect God. And that was
[1:28:23] in Elijah the prophet, the same message,
[1:28:25] I believe. And he went to those little
[1:28:27] kiddos and those those children that
[1:28:28] went up, they should go. He said, "And
[1:28:32] here they went down because the parents
[1:28:35] didn't believe it."
[1:28:38] But you don't mean it wasn't nothing,
[1:28:40] but I mean when you know that you're
[1:28:42] making fun of making making no
[1:28:46] profession, how can you expect your
[1:28:48] children to be righteous when you're not
[1:28:52] showing no example for them? God help
[1:28:54] us, man. So, we showed you the example
[1:28:56] of Elisha and the boys in disrespect. I
[1:28:59] want to show you another one really
[1:29:00] quick and I'm just going to go through
[1:29:01] the story and it's a huge long quote in
[1:29:04] scripture but in 2 Kings this is just
[1:29:07] exactly two chapters after in 2 Kings
[1:29:11] 4:38
[1:29:12] uh
[1:29:13] 48-37 and we have a Shutomite
[1:29:17] woman that the same
[1:29:20] prophet went by his town. He actually
[1:29:23] left the cursing of the boys when he
[1:29:26] when the boys were cursed and was going
[1:29:28] to Mount Carmel. It was right on his
[1:29:30] way. Don't you think that that was in
[1:29:33] his thought pattern? I mean, this was
[1:29:36] like the next day he was on the trip to
[1:29:38] Mount
[1:29:39] Carmel and he passed and he had a
[1:29:42] favorite cave here. And I'm just
[1:29:43] paraphrasing what the prophet said. And
[1:29:44] he would go and pray and this Shimomite
[1:29:46] woman heard him and believed in him and
[1:29:48] believed he was a man of God and and all
[1:29:50] these things. I'm I'm trying to show you
[1:29:52] the different approach to the exact same
[1:29:54] person.
[1:29:57] And she came to her husband and and she
[1:29:59] told him said, "Listen, I believe that's
[1:30:00] a man of God and you know, well, first
[1:30:02] off, she went and fed him." Before she
[1:30:04] even asked her husband, she said, "Will
[1:30:05] you come by?" And she fed him. And then
[1:30:08] after she fed him, you know, the prophet
[1:30:09] was really thankful and she said, "You
[1:30:10] went to her husband and said, you know,
[1:30:12] God's blessed us. You know, we got a big
[1:30:14] house and it's half empty. Could Could
[1:30:16] we do something?" And and they they
[1:30:18] built a room on them and they fed them.
[1:30:19] And then on a regular basis they would
[1:30:21] feed him. He knew he could go there and
[1:30:22] then he was able to rest there. And so
[1:30:24] the the the Elisha asked the servant, he
[1:30:27] said, "What can we do for this woman?"
[1:30:29] And they called the woman up. She said,
[1:30:30] "Oh, I got everything I need. I don't
[1:30:32] need
[1:30:33] nothing." I'm paraphrasing that, but you
[1:30:36] can read that in that scripture. She
[1:30:37] said, "I just dwell among my own people,
[1:30:39] and she wasn't even the purebred lineage
[1:30:42] of the
[1:30:43] Israelites." Amen. The prophet says
[1:30:46] that, but he said she was still a
[1:30:48] believer in her heart. Yeah.
[1:30:51] Amen. And you know the story, they built
[1:30:54] the house on the the room on the house
[1:30:56] and and and she refused anything. They
[1:30:58] go, "Oh, I God's provided for me
[1:30:59] everything. I just live among my people
[1:31:01] and all this." And they and and the
[1:31:03] prophet pressured his servant. And he
[1:31:05] said, "Well, she's childless." That used
[1:31:08] to be a curse. Now it's quite popular.
[1:31:11] But he called her back in and he said,
[1:31:14] "A year from now, you'll be holding a
[1:31:16] baby." And then you know the story. But
[1:31:19] I want to just read the last paragraph
[1:31:20] of that. And she called them. This is
[1:31:23] how the lady called
[1:31:28] Elisha, a man of
[1:31:31] God. She showed her
[1:31:33] respects to a person that God was
[1:31:36] working through by calling him a man of
[1:31:38] God.
[1:31:42] and she seen God working in his life and
[1:31:44] she knew that God was in this prophet
[1:31:47] and she wanted to give respects to God.
[1:31:51] So she called his servant a man of
[1:31:54] God. And the only way she could give
[1:31:57] respects to God was respecting God's
[1:32:00] servant. And now friends, that's the way
[1:32:02] it is. And when you respect God's
[1:32:07] order and you know the boy went out with
[1:32:09] her daddy and he died in the
[1:32:12] sun and come back and you know the whole
[1:32:15] story but what I wanted to portray here
[1:32:17] was just from second Kings 2 to 2 Kings
[1:32:22] 4 is one day's
[1:32:25] journey and because of disrespect those
[1:32:28] boys were
[1:32:29] cursed and because of respect the
[1:32:32] Shudomite Great woman got a baby that
[1:32:35] even when it died still lived.
[1:32:40] Quite a different message within just a
[1:32:43] few days. Well, I mean the only reason
[1:32:46] it's more than a few days is cuz the
[1:32:47] baby was born. But the reaction to the
[1:32:50] respect given from
[1:32:54] God.
[1:32:55] Amen. This my last and I'm totally I
[1:32:59] promise I'm at the end. It's my last
[1:33:00] one. I'm going to close. This is the
[1:33:02] most dynamic and I've never seen this
[1:33:04] quote ever in studying. One thing for
[1:33:07] sure is if God wants me to study a lot,
[1:33:08] he's going to bring a lot of rain. Can
[1:33:10] really study when it rains and you still
[1:33:13] got to start a fire every
[1:33:15] day. Here's brother Brown in the
[1:33:18] perinous church age. And you know the
[1:33:21] church ages here. You'll see
[1:33:24] here here we go. He said, "Another one
[1:33:27] outstanding to me was the emperor." and
[1:33:31] he was going to kill some of God's Holy
[1:33:33] Ghost fililled people and of
[1:33:36] course he was the right hand to the
[1:33:38] bishop in the church of Rome in that
[1:33:41] time and he was actually was the pope
[1:33:43] before him was called the pope and his
[1:33:45] name
[1:33:46] was whatever it is there
[1:33:50] uh you can see it on the screen second
[1:33:51] last line you can fill in the blank and
[1:33:54] he was putting Christians to death and
[1:33:56] could not hold but to put them to death
[1:33:58] now I want to tell you here I skipped
[1:34:00] one paragraph Raph that was just brother
[1:34:02] Brown telling a story and we go to the
[1:34:04] next paragraph and St.
[1:34:07] Martin wanted to
[1:34:09] interview this man and the guard stopped
[1:34:12] him at the gates and he said St. Martin
[1:34:14] he fell on his face and laid there and
[1:34:16] prayed until God showed him to go in and
[1:34:19] then when he raised up off there he
[1:34:21] walked into them and he locked the
[1:34:23] doors and they opened themselves and
[1:34:27] walked right
[1:34:28] on. So God made a way that Martin could
[1:34:32] go right into the emperor where the
[1:34:34] guards would have kept him out in
[1:34:36] paragraph 68. And now this is
[1:34:39] history. You don't even have to believe
[1:34:41] Brother
[1:34:42] Brown. This is just not somebody writing
[1:34:46] about Martin
[1:34:47] Luther. This is just a little if
[1:34:50] anything they would have pre-uced it. He
[1:34:54] said they would have changed this and
[1:34:55] took this out. But this is not some
[1:34:57] church talking. He said, "This is
[1:35:00] actually church history, the papa
[1:35:02] church." And they wouldn't mention these
[1:35:04] things. See, cuz these are history
[1:35:07] quotes and they're
[1:35:10] truthful. We're last two paragraphs. And
[1:35:12] this man walked right out to St. Martin
[1:35:15] right there by every guard and
[1:35:17] everything else and right in front of
[1:35:19] the empire. Now this empire was killing
[1:35:23] Holy Ghost fililled Christians and the
[1:35:26] empire didn't want to show respects to
[1:35:30] God's servant. And you know that's not
[1:35:36] mannerly. And so he just turned his head
[1:35:38] and wouldn't even respect him. And you
[1:35:41] know what God did? He tried to talk to
[1:35:44] him but he just kept his head
[1:35:48] turned. And God was going to make that
[1:35:51] heathen pay respects to his servant. So
[1:35:55] he just set the thing a fire and he
[1:35:59] scorched him out of his seat to raise up
[1:36:02] and make him
[1:36:04] stand. And now this is Bible. That's
[1:36:07] Bible history. That's Nyian council. Now
[1:36:11] this is just as fresh as it gets. I just
[1:36:13] read a quote this morning where the
[1:36:16] Nyian council is every
[1:36:20] uh got a celebration of being 1700
[1:36:26] years since they were formed. They were
[1:36:29] formed in
[1:36:30] 3:25 and were
[1:36:32] 20025. 1700 years since the church has
[1:36:37] been listening to lies of men. 19
[1:36:40] council and they had no respects for
[1:36:44] God's servant and God had him stand up
[1:36:48] and it even scored his seat where he was
[1:36:50] sitting and the fire went through his
[1:36:52] body and scorched the bottom of the seat
[1:36:54] and he had to jump up there cuz God has
[1:36:57] a way of doing things, you know. Uh-huh.
[1:37:00] God is able for these stones to rise up,
[1:37:03] children of Abraham. And you might
[1:37:05] remember that the same God dwells among
[1:37:08] us tonight. The same God,
[1:37:12] the exact same
[1:37:14] God respects.
[1:37:18] Amen. Let's
[1:37:26] stand.
[1:37:28] Hallelujah. Amen. God is so good. Amen.
[1:37:32] We need We
[1:37:35] need respects for each other. We need
[1:37:37] respects in our families. We need
[1:37:40] respects even to our government. Even if
[1:37:42] we see we we have prophecy. We know how
[1:37:45] it's going. But it's not out of control.
[1:37:48] God's in control.
[1:37:51] And we need to have respects in the
[1:37:54] brotherhood and the sisterhood and
[1:37:57] mothers. And what a message for mothers
[1:37:59] today. If anybody deserves respects, you
[1:38:03] know, the prophet talks about a mother
[1:38:05] that she's only, you know, I don't know
[1:38:08] his exact words, but when a mother gives
[1:38:10] birth to you, she's literally hairs from
[1:38:13] death. Mothers used to die like
[1:38:18] like that before any kind of
[1:38:23] lots even the the Bibles mothers would
[1:38:26] die in
[1:38:27] birth because my own grandma died just
[1:38:31] probably you know something related very
[1:38:35] young like 52 53 because they couldn't
[1:38:38] do things bleed to
[1:38:42] death and your little kids would walk up
[1:38:45] and treat that lady less than a
[1:38:48] queen. You need a kick above the
[1:38:51] knee.
[1:38:53] Respects. As you respect your mother
[1:38:55] today, you're respecting your heavenly
[1:38:58] father.
[1:39:00] Amen. As you respect each other, we're
[1:39:03] respecting our heavenly father. Amen.
[1:39:05] And vengeance is
[1:39:07] God. He will repay.
[1:39:11] You might get healed of your
[1:39:12] leprosy, but you're going to have an
[1:39:14] awful short life like Moses's sister.
[1:39:19] You can't You can't blaspheme this word.
[1:39:22] You can't blasphe this
[1:39:23] message. You can't blasphe the people
[1:39:26] that serve this message and want to stay
[1:39:28] with this message. We're living in a day
[1:39:30] right now where people are compromising
[1:39:32] like
[1:39:33] flies because they're they're trying to,
[1:39:36] you know, and I've heard it I I preached
[1:39:38] on it years ago was, you know, people
[1:39:42] would say, he said, "You got to stay
[1:39:43] with the middle of the
[1:39:45] road." Well, what that means is you
[1:39:48] don't have to take it
[1:39:50] all. But if you don't want to take it
[1:39:52] all, then why do we take any at all?
[1:39:57] We don't take all the scriptures or all
[1:40:00] the prophet revealed by revealing the
[1:40:02] mysteries of the scriptures. Then why do
[1:40:04] we take any at
[1:40:05] all? Because we don't value. We don't
[1:40:09] value. We don't respect.
[1:40:12] Amen. Amen. God help us. God help
[1:40:15] me. Show honor and respect. Amen. Amen.
[1:40:19] As we do it to each other, it's to God's
[1:40:21] word. Now, now I'm not talking about
[1:40:23] compromise. Don't leave God's word.
[1:40:26] God's word is a separator.
[1:40:28] Brother Bram said dozens of times, more
[1:40:32] than dozens of times, probably hundreds
[1:40:33] of times, said, "I I'm forced to stay
[1:40:36] with the word if that if that makes you
[1:40:40] disrespect
[1:40:42] me." Amen. I'm sorry. But
[1:40:46] actually, no, I'm not sorry. Because if
[1:40:50] I can see where the prophet said it
[1:40:51] multiple times and the Bible throws it
[1:40:53] and it dovetales perfectly
[1:40:56] together. Amen.
[1:40:59] God help us. God help
[1:41:01] us. Amen. We show respect. You know it's
[1:41:05] the spirit strong here. I can the
[1:41:07] greatest achievement of my life or one
[1:41:11] of them. I mean, one is to serve God and
[1:41:15] to be humbly able to minister what he
[1:41:19] lays on my heart, but one was to
[1:41:22] literally take care of my dad till the
[1:41:24] day he
[1:41:25] died. My dad's chair still in our living
[1:41:28] room. I went to the bathroom with him. I
[1:41:32] showered him once or twice a
[1:41:34] day. And my oldest brother would say,
[1:41:36] "Dale, I couldn't do what you do." I
[1:41:37] said, "It was an honor, a privilege.
[1:41:40] That's my dad. Doesn't matter what
[1:41:43] happens. No matter what the mess was,
[1:41:46] that's my papa.
[1:41:48] I respect that man.
[1:41:51] He's my
[1:41:53] daddy. It was him that changed my
[1:41:55] diapers. And if he didn't change them,
[1:41:57] he paid for them.
[1:41:59] You know, remember the people you
[1:42:01] disrespect might be the people that pick
[1:42:04] your old age
[1:42:05] [Music]
[1:42:07] home. Or in another spiritual way, the
[1:42:10] people that you disrespect might be the
[1:42:13] destination that you pick
[1:42:15] eternally because through them you're
[1:42:17] disrespecting
[1:42:19] God. Amen.
[1:42:22] ble.
[1:42:27] [Music]
[1:42:48] [Applause]
[1:42:50] [Music]
[1:42:52] I was
[1:42:54] [Music]
[1:43:03] you Jesus.
[1:43:07] Please
[1:43:11] [Applause]

[1:43:18] [Applause]
