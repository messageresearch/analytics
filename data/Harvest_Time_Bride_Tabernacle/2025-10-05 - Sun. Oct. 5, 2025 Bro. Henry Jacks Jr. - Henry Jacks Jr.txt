You know, first of all, I just want to greet you all in the mighty name of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You know, it's actually the 5th of Dece 5th of October. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, my time of the partying for a season is coming &gt;&gt; so close. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, you know what? &gt;&gt; If we don't see each other again, &gt;&gt; we know that we're going to see each other. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the most important thing. &gt;&gt; You know, I as I said, I always say I love I love you guys. Thank you Jesus. &gt;&gt; Brother David, I love you and I love your family &gt;&gt; and I love this church. &gt;&gt; And you know before I like to bring bring greetings from my wife, &gt;&gt; sister David, &gt;&gt; should bring her greetings. &gt;&gt; If you have your Bibles with me, we're going to read few scriptures here and then we're going to be seated. Hallelujah. from we're going to turn our Bibles to the book of Genesis. Genesis chapter 1 verse 26. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What a age we living in. &gt;&gt; What a age. You know, as your brother said, you know, if we just understand, you know, this age that we're living in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If we just understand this age, In Genesis 1 verse 26, it begins like this. And God said, "Let us make man in our image after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the hair, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the church. The prophets say like this that was a mature god. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Meaning a lesser God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You can be seated as as we ask the Lord to have his blessing to his word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah Jesus. &gt;&gt; Man was a mature God. He was given with dominion to rule over the earth but not over heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And but here when God make man in his image, this man was a spirit man. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He didn't have any flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God was a spirit as the Bible said in St. John 4:4, "For God is a spirit." &gt;&gt; So God made man in the spirit man. &gt;&gt; Right. Yes, sir. But here was man upon the earth. &gt;&gt; But man didn't have any body. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was just a spirit man. &gt;&gt; And God gave him dominion over the things of the earth, over every creeping thing upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But in order to man to rule. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Remember there are natural things upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So God had to put him in a natural body to rule. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Genesis 2 verse 7, the Bible said, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground &gt;&gt; and breathed into his nostrils &gt;&gt; the breath of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And man became a living soul. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So now the man God put him into a body. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Verse eight. And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden. And there he put the man whom he had talked. The man didn't just go into the garden. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; It was the Lord God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who took the man and put him in the garden. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We didn't just come into this body, right? It takes God, hallelujah, to baptize us &gt;&gt; into the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; This word planted, it doesn't mean to dig a hole and put in a seed. It means to be established, &gt;&gt; right? Yes. &gt;&gt; God establish, hallelujah, a garden, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And this gar, hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The topic this morning is restoring the kingdom's atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Restoring the kingdom atmosphere &gt;&gt; and laying a foundation for you to understand. Hallelujah. What Adam had in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Right. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Because the word restore, it means to bring back to its original place. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; It means to put back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the word Eden, it's not a literal place. &gt;&gt; That's why archaeology cannot find this place. &gt;&gt; It's a dimension. &gt;&gt; It's an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Bethlehem is a literal place, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Nine is a literal place. &gt;&gt; Jericho is a literal place. That's why they can find it. &gt;&gt; But he is not a literal place. &gt;&gt; That's why no archaeology can find it. &gt;&gt; And it was God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who established that &gt;&gt; dimension. But here, hallelujah was the man. Glory to God. So God, he established Pet &gt;&gt; and he put the man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the garden. So God put us in his presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the word he means God's presence. Right. &gt;&gt; So you were created, you were established to be in his presence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You were made &gt;&gt; to be in his presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why the spirit of God, it needs the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your spirit, it needs the heavenly atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But your physical body, it needs the hurt atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word atmosphere it means the envelope of gases surrounding the earth or another planet. Listen to the meaning. Hallelujah. And it also means atmosphere. It means a character. &gt;&gt; Your character carries an atmosphere. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go a little bit further here. It also means a feeling. You can carry certain feeling and that feeling creates an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; So your energy that is coming from you, &gt;&gt; it gives off an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Right? Sometimes that energy, hallelujah, that is coming from you, it may not give the right atmosphere. &gt;&gt; That's why some people might say, I don't know what the I don't know what it is, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But I just can't be in that person atmosphere, &gt;&gt; because of the energy &gt;&gt; that the person gives off, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're getting somewhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; It means a mood of a place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can one day said, "Okay, then we're going to go to a restaurant." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then when you go to that restaurant, probably that place that you go to, it creates such a warm atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; That every time you just want to dine in that restaurant, &gt;&gt; right? But if that place doesn't create the atmosphere, you're not going to want to go there anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What about what about the kingdom of God? &gt;&gt; What about the kingdom of God? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; You know the Bible said, hallelujah. In Psalms 139 verse4, I will praise thee. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For I am &gt;&gt; fearfully &gt;&gt; and wonderfully made. &gt;&gt; Marvelous &gt;&gt; are thy works &gt;&gt; that my soul knoweth right way. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When God made you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When the God made you, what does he made you? He made you into his image. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why you are fearfully and wonderfully in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the image of God, it carries an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that atmosphere, it must project the attributes of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And once it project the attributes of God. Hallelujah. People is going to want to come into that atmosphere &gt;&gt; because there's something about you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There's something about your spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. As the word said, the deep call it and to the deep &gt;&gt; and the noise of the water spots. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Eden, it is said that Eden is made up of five strokes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is made up of five strokes. Eden &gt;&gt; in the Hebrew, right? These five strokes it means spot. &gt;&gt; It means moment, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It means an open door. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When God placed the man in heeden, the man was enjoying an open door. Right. &gt;&gt; The man was enjoying a spot with the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? Having fellowship. &gt;&gt; Right, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was enjoying a moment &gt;&gt; because he was having fellowship with the father. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It means access. No wonder why the Bible said, hallelujah, Jesus is the beloved son whom we have access with the father. &gt;&gt; That's why I said no man can come to the father but by me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You want access to the father, you got to come through me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It means presence. I wonder why the Bible said in his presence there is fullness of joy. &gt;&gt; And at his right hand there are pleasures forever more because of the heavenly atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But here Adam had that in the beginning. He had all the power of God. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; God gave him the power. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He It was the light. It was God's delight. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But then when sin came. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it took him away from that &gt;&gt; man lost its way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They lost his way. Then God had to come down and said, "You know what? I'm going to guard the way." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to guard the way. He wasn't guarding the tree. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He was guarding the way to the tree. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Follow me now. I'm going somewhere with this. The Bible said he put cherubims, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Cherubims, more than one, &gt;&gt; not singular, but plural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm quoting Genesis 3:4. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory. The Bible says, "So he drove out the man, &gt;&gt; right? And he placed on the east of the garden of Eden cherubams. The cherubams represents guard. &gt;&gt; They are guards, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at it. God placed guards and a flaming sword. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is that? That is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word flaming it means hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It means something that is burning or consuming. Sword represents the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible said in Revelation 1, hallelujah, he had a sword. That is the word of God. In Revelation 19:15, he said, "There was a sword that shot toward the sword that went out of his mouth, which is the word of God." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is the word. &gt;&gt; And the spirit and the word is the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; right? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it was guarding the way to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But in order to to have access to the tree of life, you have to go through the guard, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You have to approach the guard, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; God, hallelujah, was restoring back a healing again upon the hurt. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And here just to understand something in the message the greatest battle ever fought Satan's army brings diseases &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and God's army &gt;&gt; is commissioned to cast them out &gt;&gt; there you are &gt;&gt; every Every time Satan throws anything unto you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's army is to cast him out, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You hear that? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because God equip you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God give you the character. &gt;&gt; God give you his power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, God." That's the very technique that God used. Satan use the harmony of destruction to believe to disbelieve God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is the tactic of Satan is disbelieve. &gt;&gt; Right. Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, did somebody catch that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The tactics of Satan is disbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the devil has anointed people to disbelieve the word. &gt;&gt; That's why there's so much problem today in the world and in the churches because of disbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. and he set up a better kingdom than Michael had and God cast him out. God's method is cast out the evil, cast down reasoning, cast down superstition. So what is God's method is to cast down it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Cast down the reason. Cast down superstition because you believe, &gt;&gt; right? Yeah, &gt;&gt; you believe the word &gt;&gt; and because you believe the word, it will anoint you with power. &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "I have gi you power." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. To tread down serpents. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You are above it. You are above sin. You are above worry. You're not supposed to worry. &gt;&gt; That's the tactics of the devil. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You are above worry. &gt;&gt; At times when you feel a little feeling of worry come upon you, it's the devil that has anointed upon you. You are above it. You must tell yourself, hallelujah. And shake it off. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I am above this warrior. &gt;&gt; I am above it. I am resurrected in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, saints, this is my testimony. You know, months, months, probably about two months. My wife, she has been going through a phase, a season. And you know I was there and the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said call her and I said stop allowing the devil to kick you around like some football &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; rise up above this &gt;&gt; stop your worry &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; stop your worry &gt;&gt; she was battling &gt;&gt; for months hallelujah And it was so oppressive, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That it was affecting her emotionally and spiritually, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The devil try to whisper things in her ears that she blasphe against the word, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And I said to her, you know what blasphem is? And then when I heard brother Dale spoke about blasphem last week, I said, this must be gone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I said blasphem is when you know it is the power of God and you deny it. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I said, "Have you reached to that stage?" She said, "No." I said, "You know what?

[Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wow. What a tremendous, tremendous message. Oh, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. You know, Brother Junior, when he was ministering, just the Holy Spirit just brought something to me. You know, Satan's tactics never changed. He came to Jesus when he tempted him and he said, "If you be the son of God, you know, God's never said that to one of his." &gt;&gt; God's never said that to one of his children. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Anytime somebody comes and says, "Well, if you're a Christian, &gt;&gt; you wouldn't have made that mistake." God never ever said that to anybody. Jesus. &gt;&gt; God knew we would make mistakes. &gt;&gt; God knew we would fall down. &gt;&gt; When they hung Jesus on the cross and the soldiers were speaking, Satan was speaking through the soldiers said, "If he was the son of God, he would come down." He saved others, but he can't save himself. If &gt;&gt; the next time Satan comes to you and say, "If you're the bride of Christ, if you're a believer, if you're a good person, if you're the the wife of Christ, if you are, you wouldn't have made that mistake. your kids wouldn't have done that. You wouldn't have had that thing, terrible thing happen. You know, Satan was always looking for something. But God wasn't. You know why God never said if you are? Cuz he knew who you were. Hallelujah. Oh wow. This word is just amazing. God never ever come to you and said, "If you were mine, you wouldn't have done that." He knew you would do that. He knew I would fall down. He knew he would have to come and save a dummy like me. &gt;&gt; Wow. Ain't that amazing how we can just recognize Satan the liar. Hallelujah. Just beautiful. Thank you, Junior. What an amazing. Let's sing that song as family of God. Amen. So, God bless you. We just look forward to fellowship just as much as we want and just uh it's amazing. Amen. If it's it's not if you are. You know the very no matter how worse of a sinner that would ever be in the world if they have a thought towards God proves &gt;&gt; that they came from God. &gt;&gt; Cuz no man come to the father unless the father give them the thought to think about him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You will notice. [Music] [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] [Applause] Heat up [Music] here. [Music] [Applause] Heat up [Applause] here. Heat. [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Applause] Heat.
