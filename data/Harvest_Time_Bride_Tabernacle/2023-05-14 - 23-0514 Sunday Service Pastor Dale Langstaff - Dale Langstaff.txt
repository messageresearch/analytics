your precious name we pray amen amen thank you Lord Jesus blessed be his name thank you Jared and musicians for song Servicing thank you Jared and Matt both for singing songs we don't know amen it's fantastic it really really is because they're wonderful whether we know them or not amen and it just is a wonderful worship and it just expands our Horizons to uh serve Christ amen it's just so nice to have ones that aren't sung maybe regular all the time amen amen Hallelujah let's just uh we just greet the mothers a special way maybe maybe before I I read our scriptures I'll read a quote that a prophet said man he said I would like my mother come and sit on the platform with me now he said I know she's real boxer just like I was used to be nice you'd think if a minister asked all the mothers to come sit in the platform you'd think he'd maybe went cuckoo but that was what the prophets are amen he said I think mothers are the Fifth Gospel he said she came before Matthew Mark Luke and John because mother got him first and they're the ones that bring them up first his mother Hallelujah let's turn to or scriptures waiting on God events let's go to Psalms on 127. and three when twenty seven and three just greet you all and wish you all happy Mother's Day in and the church has something for the mothers after amen we can see oh man just a good day of fellowshipping man thank God for the beautiful weather and springtime also just in a way of testimony we went over to uh Dan right left right left Church which was Sam Johnson's old church I believe it's a new building now beautiful beautiful building and and we we had a wonderful day they treated us like for loyalty it was just beautiful I had never actually met Dan in the flesh but he treated us amazing it would have been impossible to treat us any nicer and he desires to have long-term friendship with us and and the church's code Mingo and all that their church is about the same as ours size wise and Manning and it was just beautiful from the beginning to end the message that uh Pastor Abraham brought from Uganda I'm going to steal I'm in a I put my fishing rod in his pond already and I got enough of his inspiration to uh make add to and and it was just really a wonderful wonderful message and it was a you know wheat Church started that quarter after seven on Wednesday and we got back to our room about 11 30. and we're not that far from church it was a good two and a half hours of solid preaching and altar call after a little prayer line on a Wednesday night and believe me it was worth the state it was really nice and we are honored to have our grandkids with us brother Bernard's kids and so I was Grandma and Grandpa and that was a great privilege and sister Ruth went with us and it was just fantastic from the beginning to end and so uh also in that same line You'll see I put out another poster and man I encourage you to you know you know I'm going to read a quote today that God Made You for Fellowship that that was that was God was lonely that's what the Bible says and God redeemed you so you would come back into fellowship with him and our Prophet said that when you if if you backslid and you really came from God you're you're just out of Fellowship but when you get redeemed back you know he don't lose see you know I said there you know when I he asked you know we had a good time and he asked us to pray and I I mentioned it here and it must have came out different because sister Ruth even said uh you know it was just a blessing to her but you know when the in the Bible in Genesis 1 27 and 28 when God made you ask you to make you the prophet said you were God's logos we normally call it theophany but you're going to find out that if we really come into maturity and we're living on the word of God we're going to take a lot you know the you know people came to the prophet I'm sorry I'm preaching but and they said well I don't believe in this he said well of course you don't because you're not a believer but if we actually become believers if we actually come to the to Statue of a perfect man and we actually are mature believers you know when I was studying like like I was so stunned in some of the things that the prophet said that I I was almost cautious to even mention them this morning because it was coming to the fullness of if we take the word of God you know the Bible says that all all that's a Double L scripture is given for inspiration Doctrine that's pretty solid wow wow Psalms one let's read this amen low children are a Heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the room is his reward as arrows in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth happy is a man whose quiver is full of them and they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate amen we just ask God to add the blessing to his word amen is used to be seated tonight amen let's turn to First Corinthians 10 and 13. and we're going to lay a foundation and we're going to talk about coming into this into this statue of a perfect man in the fullness in Christianity and and you're going to be able to take God at his word and we live in in adult States way too long you know like you're doubting your healing but you're God's logos but you're the logos of God in the spirit man but you doubt whether God could save you heal you or save your kids but you're actually God you are actually when when God made you in the logos the prophet said the brother Brown said that that was exactly how he made the son Jesus Christ now you wonder when Jesus Christ came to the world and he could just speak Miracles and stop the storm and and heal the person that where God he was in the mind of God so when he went to the pool amen he only healed one person he didn't go to the graveyard but in the mind of God and and the Bible says that the bride will have the word and the mind of Christ and know what he wants done with it amen and if we were living in the scriptures amen God said Jehovah God said to Moses he said what are you crying about just speak it just speak it and go far away now watch this what the prophet said if if this if if something comes forward believe me I struggled with it before you amen But First Corinthians 10 13 says that that there has no temptation taking thee but such as is common to men but this is where we want to start out but God is faithful I don't think we heard that but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able by God but the god that you came out of that the god that cares about you that the god that you're a part of he's faithful don't matter it does but if you're not faithful but he is amen and he will give you more than you can bear but will with the temptation but will with the Temptation also make but also make you want something in your life you need you need something in your life but he also with the Temptation the temptation of sickness the temptation of not having to pay your bills the temptation of not being able to go to God all the time or the dentation or whatever's in your life not being married or being married to a knucklehead or the to Jason he will make this is God's word by the way amen but he God that's faithful will make a way of Escape but we don't believe that we don't live like that we don't live like a conquering life we say well we're going to help God help God how are you going to help God you you think God needs your help God wants one thing from you worship worship worship worship worship and obedience amen obedience is better than sacrifice but worship and obedience actually you can't even worship God properly unless first you're obedient but if you're obedient you're one of Christ then you can worship God but this same God that's faithful will make a way of Escape so we're like really you know when we I'm already fishing in brother Abraham's Pond you know he said something he said if Jesus Christ in the flesh Jehovah God in the flesh and that and literally the pillar fire and the cloud were both walking with them in the Elohim and and you could cut the air with a knife because The Presence of Jehovah God was in this place he couldn't do once back more for you not once back you don't believe that I know you don't he couldn't do one Speck for you more than he is already done he's already done you're gonna do one more space he said well you want to be saved well I already saved you I already paid Daytona you want the baptism my Lord God but I already paid the atonement for that you want your healing by your stripes you're healed that that's that's a past tense I've already glorified you that's the pie I said but I'm waiting for my husband he already gave you their husband amen if you ain't got a husband in the flesh you've got the Holy Ghost who's your husband amen but I'm waiting for my my uh my husband Dale to to line up well he's already done that but it's there's not one more thing he could do not one more thing actually if you want and I'm jumping way ahead the prophet said if you wanted him to do something for you there's one thing he could do just one thing Jesus Christ Jehovah God there's just one thing he can do for you today and that's preach the word well he can preach the word you preach the word and you'd look like a meal looking at a new gate like who you brings away but he couldn't he couldn't fulfill your word because it's already fulfilled your family is already saved if you've claimed them they're the heritage of your family they're already saved you said but I don't see it God say brother Dale's already Perfection he said I definitely don't see that but he does because in Romans 8 he says already already glorified but he's enough I know but in God's eyes but God who's faithful but the god who's faithful will make a way of Escape that you may be able to Bear it now here comes the bombshell and I said bombshell believe me I got it this week you take that scripture right there and you take birth control Prophet said it zillions of times do you want to tell you something in Google it had the 10 weirdest families in North America I shared this I think with brother Matt um the 10 weirdest families in North America what was the ninth weirdest Family in North America I love it I mean that really blessed my heart you know they have I don't even know about Watson all but you know there was some weird things you know but the ninth weirdest see the Bible says that where you'll be peculiar if you're not peculiar you're in Dangerous Ground if you don't look a bit weird if when your wife stands up and you walk out of the restaurant and all the heads don't turn well then you're you're in Dangerous Grounds right because you're supposed to be a light you're supposed to be peculiar and they're supposed to go what's that hey man so the ninth we're just like this was for Google well it's a family that never used birth control they believe that God wouldn't give them more than they could bear they had 19 children you know use I know what you're thinking right now and you can just bypass that thought you know I remember zillions of people I could name them by name my wife definitely does that when we had Vicky they said you got a Millionaire's family to stop right there boy and a girl which one of you kids would like to go back you know John dank well Benjamin was a complete opposite he was a mistake that's disgusting my wife was a mistake can you imagine god making a mistake my rib wasn't here yet oh well I think a lot of you kids would have trouble coming if your wife if your mom hadn't been a mistake you see sometimes God makes mistakes in our eyes oh they weren't his mistakes and our eyes they were our mistakes because nowadays the prophet said he said now people and kids and families are a embarrassment disgrace disgusting because you want to live a Hollywood lifestyle I wonder if all these things that we do in the church and I'm preaching to brother Dale too are you we found in a movie or something somewhere see they don't have too many kids in Hollywood because then they couldn't be in the Showbiz yeah showbiz well that sound good you know I have a hard time being a sister lawyer and have 19 kids yep and you know I know three sisters in churches in Ontario that are all lawyers I wonder if we're watching too much Hollywood you can fill in that blank it's yes in case you were wondered yeah the right answer is yes let's go to Psalms 37 23 and 24. because see now now now like the only thing you got to clarify here is if you're a believer and if this is the Bible that's all you got to clarify because you know I studied a little bit I didn't go to school along I was basically in school but I learned a lot more preaching God's word than I learned in 12 years of school and I have never found birth control in the Bible not nope I mean you can your family is stubborn but I'm just telling you what the Bible says what the prophet said 23 first and the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord and he delighteth in his ways but now if you're helping God to get your Delight maybe it's you ordering your steps or 24 though he would fall he shall not utterly be cast down for God will withhold him with his hand amen amen see and what this is on just just jump ahead you know because we're human it's the only excuse we can come up with we're Believers but we're human and we struggle to believe that's why we don't believe our healing like we believe God could save us brother Matt but no he couldn't hurt my he couldn't save my my knee because that's harder that's harder like he could save your soul and that's Supernatural but your knee I'll live with it live with it that's not God's desire I know the thoughts I had for you before I made Elohim and there were thoughts of prosper and good health and a family in heaven and and all that were numbered in his hand do you realize that and I don't know where this is coming from do you realize what you think you're doing in your union as marriage and helping God or hindering God God's trying to bring you a baby and maybe it's in his hand and you're trying to withhold it and God's like they don't stop doing that pretty soon we can't lose them anyway back to the number one they were the weirdest night's weirdest family because they didn't use birth control in the head 19. you hanging on to your seats number two when their children were in a relationship they didn't date like random dating they did this thing they called like Google because see they're not used to like the Bible and stuff Google it's not really up to date on all the god stuff you know it used this thing called courting courting not dating because dating you just you know you know what you do but but they use this thing called corking and it's weird because you're never together alone and they said you have virtually no physical contact until the vows now that is extremely weird I mean hey wait a minute this made the ninth weirdest Family in the United States in Google now I'm going to tell you something else there was some final stuff on it but we're living in a world that the word of God is considered so far it shouldn't be that way I'm trying to think of whatever else that was the main thing yeah the Corky and they actually had minimal to no physical contact until marriage in the world's like that's weird song with God's Bible says God help us you know see we got to be we got to get comfortable living in a weird place because you know Sister Ruth said some powerful things from where God said it's going to get weirder it's going to get weirder you know I cited a message Church with Brothers and me and Danny Funk went over inside his house later and that church now has a warehouse door in the end and they sold the message pews over there I sat in that church with the presence of God there the pulpit's been burned or whatever and the bathroom's knocked out and they're parked in wagons when I heard that I had trouble sleeping the next night I literally had trouble sleep be careful how far Satan will take you he might take you farther than what you desire because when you leave the word of God you're a dangerous slow now when the snowball starts going down the slope it's really tiny that Satan starts rolling but when it picks up speeding gets bigger it would take an atomic miracle to slow it down wow you know motherhood and our Prophet said this and it made me feel really a lot better after that is a perfect type of Christian matter of fact Let Me Maybe I should tell you my table motherhood is our spiritual life motherhood is our spiritual life it's almost you know when the prophet gave types like Joseph Joseph in the Bible and all that they're almost a perfect type of Jesus but not quite see he asked his dad to lie like just barely said you know be a farmer instead of a Shepherd because it was an insult to be a shepherding Egypt well I didn't lie but motherhood other than maybe one little tiny thing is a perfect type of your spiritual life I'll tell you which part is not the perfect type mothers get blamed for everything that's the only part that's not a part of your spiritual life it is I know Brothers this is not your day I understand perfectly but if you're a mother this morning let's brother Maggie you're a lot better than the slang staffs but generally speaking you've been blamed because there's no money in the bank you've been blamed because cooked and the clothes aren't washed and she didn't iron the right shirt and she knew what you were thinking ahead of time your shoes aren't shined you can't find your checkbook or you know what I mean that's the only comparison the same as your spiritual walk because Jehovah God never one time not one time now we can do better Brothers not one dying is Jehovah God accused his bride not one day not one time but let's go into all the things that she types and if I get to the quote this morning which I pray I do well two and a half hours I'm sure to get a lot covered I mean that's a Wednesday night so I get three and a half today like amen they but everything else in motherhood is your spiritual walk in life to a T you're not a mother this morning unless you surrendered your will you're not a Christian this morning and a Believer unless you surrender your will you're not a mother this morning unless you put everything ahead of your own life flash included you're not a Believer this morning unless you put your flesh it's night and put everything ahead of this flesh but I was like what and when you're a mother you brought forth new life and if you're a Believer you brought forth New Life there is nothing other than being wrongfully accused that ain't a perfect type to your spiritual walk and life in Christ and God showed us the parallel perfectly in motherhood he's an awesome God and we can look at mothers I mean look at look at when the angel came to John the Baptist mother and father and the father was a knucklehead I mean let's just say it the way it was he didn't believe him and we ain't moved far from that state Brothers but don't you need my help God but I was gonna hey Sarah thought Hagar I'll help you maybe there's a doctor or a pill I can buy maybe I'll get counseling maybe I'll go to theology you know what God the angel God through the angel told John the Baptist Daddy he said you're going to be spiritually blind until you start listening to me that's about where brother Dale's been most of his life brother Dale's starting to get sick of being there you know I I did something weeks and weeks ago and this is the only mistake my wife ever made in 40 years I said honey do this and buy it and she acted like the men that time she said but uh but uh and then she had to go to Michigan and listen to brother Abraham American uh Uganda pastor and the first thing she said when she got in the vehicle she said I should have listened to you did what you said you know when Joshua took the people who and the Cross Jordan it was in the springtime brother Matt and it was flood and God said go ahead and cross God don't make things simple meh and that water was slipping right on their toes and it says and the deacons were really scared because they hadn't prayed through like the pastor Joshua had and it was the deacons that stepped in first and the water would have been right at their knee the first step and it just went how's the river go whoop if that's a beaver God made the Beavers but we say well we'll wait till the drought comes oh oh you waited long enough it's a drought just go to Michigan if you don't think so and go in the store and we went somewhere and our weight just came up and the tree was very nice I know very good she had things in her skin that would have hurt my skin I mean they were and and like I mean when you when I when you know if I if I've got horns on the cow and I'd burn the horn so it won't bleed I mean that would hurt me but like it don't hurt people in Michigan I mean that's special flesh because like when when you have I'm serious Brother Matt when you like when you friend yourself I mean all the kind of I did they jumped I mean yeah I'm not going to that shop I'm not going to the shop to get a tattoo no I'm fine just like I am I never did like needles I actually passed out when they me and you're gonna go no no no no no no no you know the problem I couldn't find one of the quotes that said but you know God's getting fed up with us not taking him out his word you know he's getting that's just flat up the way it is you know watch this Brothers you know if you told your wife to go buy groceries number one you probably wouldn't have to tell her but if you did and and you come home there was nothing in the house this is spiritually and there was nothing in the house she said well I didn't go buy groceries she said I was afraid there was no money but you said but I told you to buy it yeah but I was a feared I was a theater I just flipped that right over to God God said God told Moses Moses was God to pharaoh and Pharaoh ran into some rough road it was a Uganda road and it was getting kind of rough and the people were going to Stone him no no no I tell you what if you were throwing stones at me that's one thing but eggs is bad enough and most oh my God oh God he said just are you afraid you're going to speak the wrong thing I don't believe you are but you don't believe enough to believe God will back it up you think it's got to be a prophet or something and there ain't nothing wrong with Prophets but they just believed and I believe in my heart that there will be more in this age than just Brown that makes it that means there's got to be another some people that are actually believing and if you're believing then you better start speaking it hello why what's how this you know what motherhood surrenders to God's seed you know and she denies all her rights and her desires you know a mother could be sleeping in bed and everybody's the middle of the night three o'clock and the babies in three rooms down and like it's like a supernatural ability the baby like you would need radar Quality Air complaints and something that baby just oh they're like oh how'd you still get us for a spiritual watch if God just you know amen should denies all her right and her purpose for Father God and everything comes ahead of mother mother sleeps less mother eats less mother does everything last she gets nice things last everything is less you have a nicer Barn then you have a house you have a nicer tractor then you have a car you have a nicer suit than your wife has a dress everything's last for mother and God showed us that's how it should be for our flesh to serve him but we're not willing to go there in Matthew 16 24 said then Jesus said unto his disciples If any man will come after me and will deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his for my sake we'll find it that same scripture is also recorded in Luke 9 23-24 we're doing a lot of saving of our flesh but not too much a following because it's it's just like this it's just it's very very very very simple if you believe then you're not afraid and if you believe you will step out so we actually in Reverse math you know I was really good at math if you checked your answer then that actually means if you don't step out just say I'm Healed I have that family I have my husband period I I he's he's just right here I I tug him every night before I go to bed I know you think I'm nuts but what about the people that were getting their uh saying they were blind and the prophet prayed for him in fact and they were sitting in the barber chair and the barber was making fun of them oh oh that's what it is you don't want to be made fun of so you know the minister and and I'm jumping way all over the place but he said you know your flash is going to die no matter what whether you're going to Rapture or whether you just die but you're gonna die and God through free moral agent gave you a choice and and I'm definitely not going to preach that message because but but this part's good so you're gonna die so you have the right to die listen to this ladies this is good this is really good you have the right to die fighting or you have the right to die because you're afraid to die I'm afraid to take God at his word and I'm afraid to be called the fool and I'm afraid to die so I'm going to die and that brother went through the Bible and he just showed like a dozen things in Bible a fools people that took God at his work just I just wow you know the prophet said that Abraham bought baby clothes for waiting 25 years and said his face never wavered a bit he kept asking Sarah on a regular basis you feeling anything different because he didn't just believe it he just was he talked about it he claimed it I'm Healed I don't if feelings have nothing to do with this Bill's had nothing to do with it it's fine to feel nice I like feeling nice but just when you believe you just like it's here your babies are here all the babies are here even even watch this even when you're praying for healing you say Lord I'm Healed if if if I enter which I don't but if I had something wrong with me and I said Lord Heal me and I just I Lord I claim a healing and I died in five seconds God healed me and you're down here crying and I'm up there jumping and doing head stamps and jumping off of golden trampolines and you guys because I was the low Goss of God before I ever was flesh amen Hallelujah is it all right to read some quotes behold greater than all of them is here a 62 quote mold us and we're coming down to the from The Potter's House and break us up Lord and mold us and make us real Christians and give us a new birth and the spirit of God in us like the spirit of motherhood you thought I was coming up with that on my own here's the prophet saying the spirit of motherhood and the spirit of God make us like the spirit of motherhood just like that deer was that was willing to die because she was a mother now she told that story and I'll just tell it fast and thing but brother Branham was hunting with the meanest man he ever knew and he he bragged about killing fawns and and does and and all this thing and and brother Branham they went hunting and and he called brother Brown the chicken-hearted preacher see see people will make fun of you but if you have problems with that then they call that they call that like you you're inferior to peer pressure you know that's a big thing like in high school I'll tell you honestly I was never affected by you not a little bit somebody was a very mean in high school they got a punch in the nose it's just straightforward it was just black and white amen but everybody wants to fit you're not going to fit in in this world you can move to straight Mennonite country or where only bears live Jared and you ain't gonna fit in because this world ain't our home and if it is your home you're really in trouble amen and brother Brown never prayed for this brother he never preached to this brother and I got another question why would brother Branham even take the meanest manhunting he never took all the brothers that loved them all the ministers all the deacons not no he took up he took it and they stopped and brother Brown thought they were having a lunch and he pulled out a fond whistle and they were in a Mallow and as soon as they blew the whistle a fond deer a doe deer jumped up and was looking right just just as close as just a few yards away because she had an instinct of her Bay day it was just my baby my baby my baby my baby it didn't matter if there was a tank coming a atomic bomb it didn't matter if it was my body my baby she had no brains between her and her it was just my baby my baby her brains went to Mush poo my baby my baby and she stood right up front with her saying don't do it there's two Hunters here they got guns I can smell them everything she knew what was complete Insanity my body my baby and she said just shoot me do anything you want but my baby my baby my baby needs me but you won't serve Christ like that I don't normally well if it's dangerous look the government said we should don't get on that subject you know in the Bible the government told the disciples not to preach in Jesus name and got beat do you know Moses against the law Moses wife against the law hid Moses hid Moses mom goes mom there's the mom again hid Moses against the law against Allah she broke the law because he was actually born a boy believe it or not and like you know we can just go on and go on and go on like Daniel broke the law broke the law and Daniel didn't even have to break the law because Daniel could have still lived but he wouldn't even curb the law because even the prophet said that that Samuel the prophet Samuel's mom when she cried and cried for a baby she probably she prayed in her heart and her lips never moved now that's that's that's in the actual the Bible so how come Daniel when the government changed the law I said well I can pray and I want Believers that will never come to a prayer meeting they would just stay at home because well I can pray on the couch and I won't move my lips better yet this would fit more Believers forget that I won't even pray at all I'll turn uh-huh Prophet said that prayer was powerful than any atomic bomb ever you just say God you said in your word here this is mine I take it I accept it over you don't have to be really big you can think of the the woman where where they're brought the plane down in the States you know and she was praying and and you know she was converted by the way yep she was she was actually a believer because she prayed for her baby that had a disease from sexual living like AIDS yeah now that's pretty bad brother Matt yep and he was dying dying was crying to his mom he said Mommy it's getting darker and darker and darker and darker in here and she said to God she said God you gave me this baby and I'm like the cinema woman and you didn't give me this baby to die when it's getting darker and darker and darker and I will not I will not I refuse God now she's preaching to God hallelujah see you forgot she was the logos of God and she said God I'm a part of the logos and I'm going to tell you a couple things I will not I refuse to saith the Lord and she was the logos of a woman she said I will not back up and God talked to a Jet Airlines through all the media and those controlled traffickers and said there's a storm up and there's there's oil leaking in your engine and brought down a chat with 300 people in it and the prophet said well it's a Monday night sunny day out today I think I'll go check out the trees if he was checking out the trees God said keep on going he said something that we should never we should take it out of our language he said but but God hates Bob the devil loves bud the devil and butt are in the same sense but the prophet just for a split second had spiritual amnesia and then he said okay that's about how long it lasts with brother Dale it lasts about 35 years God help me I'm gonna have to live old tell you what he's okay and he's walking along and this is a mother a mother that raised a no-good son the world it was her fault and she's standing out there and brother Brown looked a million miles from a preacher he had bib overhauls on and probably a raccoon hat and I'm making this up but he wasn't dressed for preaching brother not and he's just thrown along checking up trees and he said come on Amanda good morning and she said good morning parser and she said hey excuse me he didn't wear his name tag on the poster of William he didn't wear a name take on the prophet to leave receiving Church each and I want everybody in the tune to know he said excuse me he said how'd you know I was a pastor that means he didn't look like a pastor brother Mike he said how'd you know I was person woman and she said you know I was praying the other night that's something us Believers don't do very much so I was praying the other night that's something the guy said from Uganda Abraham he said you know if we'd pray once in a while maybe God would answer so I was praying the other night I was praying and I was telling God God I ain't giving you my son when he's getting darker you don't have a choice I know you were shocked I said that right God didn't oh you said Dale how could you say he said it's called something called we called the Bible it's actually called the word of God brother Matt and in first John 1 it says and the Word was with God and the word oh and the word and the Word was God and she was a logos of God and she said God you gotta line up to your word and God pulled out his Bible in heaven and said John 1. he didn't have to pull it out he just went in his computer and he said thank you madam thank you mother he said so madam the prophet said that she had a dream so she was praying that she fell asleep she prayed so long we definitely don't do that because we'd go to bed praying and he fell asleep and he gave her a dream and he said you know I'll send you by a pastor tomorrow papyrus and I want to tell you something this morning it was just a dream brother night she physically seen what brother Brown looked like now if you don't think that's an awesome God I'd say that's a pretty good dream and the kind of closing the shirt he was it wasn't just some random like fly and then I garbage no God was identified perfectly that's exactly what he'll look like sister Patty oh that that's the kind of God I'm I'm interested wow and he walked in her house he said she told him he said I have a son and he's died she didn't hide told him what it was come in and pray for him and the prophet said he said I've stepped in 20 million dollar houses he said I had no idea when I stepped in that house the token was on the door the president's got he said the first thing I've seen is is uh for me and my house to serve the Lord right here there was testimonies everywhere where he went and he said so she wanted him to pray and she said madam Mama madam why don't you pray first anybody read that lately that's a good story to read on Mother's Day and our prophet was a man of Prayer he said when she started praying he didn't say she had great words he didn't say that he didn't say she was educated he didn't say she knew all the right message lingle brother Matt he said but I knew it instantly that she knew the boss I knew instantly he said God my son's here and you're going to save them period and I'm expecting it today today not tomorrow not maybe not if you feel like it no she started giving God orders and then the prophet prayed and he said Mama it's getting a lot lighter in here it's getting a lot lot lighter in here I can see a lot better in here it's getting a lot lot lighter you know years later the prophet went somewhere and was into the area or something and the man came up to him he said you know person he said remember you came in that little old house see she was a believer she was a Believer and so God actually showed her I said God I want to be a part of that amen and the message 63 and this is the sign of this he said the reason that the deer could display the motherhood that gallantly is because she was just a mother she didn't have to think about it she didn't have to premeditate it she didn't have to go to cemetery or university she was just a mother and her nature I wonder if this site was a mother now if you happen to be a believer you won't have to think about being a Believer and your nature will just be I believe there's no man I just I believe it's just really straightforward God make that's what the prophet said and in the message it put it all capital letters he said God make us Christians our nature Christians God make our God make Dale's nature a believer a Christian Lord and just something put it in there but make me a Christian at heart and that and represent that has respects to the the and sorry that's represented to the world to display Christianity and The Godly love like that old deer dead in motherhood you know what if you're a Believer you'll just walk right up you just you just walk right in front of semis brother Matt because if you're a believer I don't mean if God's I'm not saying be Reckless when you come to stop sign you still look both ways but you see what I mean I don't have to tell you to look both ways because we're too over cautious our nature is not belief hey man I'm trying to push you the other way God's trying to push you the other way this world is falling apart in 63 he said the backbone of a Nation is motherhood and you and you break motherhood and you've broken the nation right there now lots of religious theologians would say the backbone of the nation's God see it's a perfect time man it is God but God's in motherhood amen and that's the one thing that holds everything together is God in motherhood real genuine motherhood amen Hallelujah amen are you scared to read some quotes here and I got to find a pair of glasses amen 64. and he was to pass this way he said in genuine loyal loyal mother standing here he said she wasn't hypocritical and she was she she wasn't just putting that on a sideshow she was a mother and why is she doing it death didn't mean nothing to her her baby was in trouble and she thought that her baby she thought more of her baby than she did her own life let the hunters come and take that Royal loyal heart of the motherhood it was motherhood in her was calling out her baby was crying this man that went with the prophet the prophet was standing there expecting him to kill that little fawn I'm sure you know the story and and the prophet was praying the Lord how can you let him do that and he opened his eyes and the gun was loading up like that and he threw the gun down and he said I've had enough of this he said show me this Jesus man he hadn't preached him a sermon he lived in the sermon an invisible Union of the Bride he said what was that sacred trust what what a sacred trust what now think of Christianity what does sacred trust God's give to the bride of Christ look at the Revelation and the the the the the revealed word and everything a brand new book The Seal's open that God's given to you a sacred Trust and what a responsibility it is to the woman amen and now you see why she's a type of the church which was the same responsibility as a woman had a sacred responsibility to her motherhood motherhood has been lost in this day the sacred responsibility of motherhood to her virtues and to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility to prayer to the word and to Christ just the same as the woman has to her husband wow God help us amen the prophet tells this story and I'm just going to do it from paraphrase it tells a story about the possum man you all know the story it was about 10 o'clock at night and the possum come in dragging its leg come up this thing and come up saying they're normally scared of humans and it was it was it must have been 10 in the morning because he said they don't normally travel at the daylight and I don't know I could read it here but it would take me but the possum sat there for days and days and people come by and said why don't you just take your gun and take her and put her up her Ministry and see the pouch like a kangaroo and all her babies six or seven of her babies were in there and her power of instinct was to live at any cost because what was in that poach at any cost I'm taking care of that pouch she's dragging her leg she's dragging her leg blokes on the sidewalk and he said there was maggots now you could physically see maggots and he's the prophet was a human being by the way and he said I took a rake and scraped her off the sidewalk maggots he really didn't want that at the front door and he kept thinking she would die and they wanted them to kill her and he said he said you know you hunt go get one of those revolvers and shoot he said he said I'm a Hunter but I'm not a murderer am I going just laying the gun between her hey man and this is just exactly where you are because we haven't came up the profit hadn't come up to the fullness God had to hit him over the head with the and he was talking the one morning he went out to check her and she was still there and he was actually hoping she was gone or dead gone or dead some of the people you're praying for you hope they die so you can quit for him because we're not Believers yet now God can deliver people by I've prayed that if God if you don't see fit to heal them then take them home let them because I don't want to live here like that don't never let me live in a state we have an agreement with my wife when I get like that there's two by four and you right there yep okay and God said God said to the prophet just like this don't don't think God's expecting you to be there God said boy send her to your front door you all got something on your front door and you wish God would get rid of it for you he said I sent it to you and all you got to do with what's on your front door did you spend a little time in prayer just just even a little bit the prophet apologizes to God and he said God forgive me for being a stupid prophet stupid or he uses a very strong word and not recognizing what you were doing and he don't pray for three hours and three days he might preach for three hours but he don't pray for three hours he said little apostles you're a mama and you're trying to save your babies and he said I give you your life and he said just like that she just walked down the street yes sir and she got to the gate she turned around and did a big old thank you sir to God wow amen in 60 and 53 the ministry of Christ he said sometimes it awful it happens in a something awful had happened in their family and they wanted a baby John the Baptist and he was prophesied his mom and dad and then them those days it was a disgrace not to have a baby but nowadays I mean how are you going to put on this Jezebel clothing if you are have a baby I mean you're just going to be disfigured but God never ever made motherhood or Believers or Christians to put on that garbage amen and them days it was a scratch that babies now it wasn't she wanted a baby let's look at some of my quotes here so I don't take them all back home he said uh multiple times he said you're the Fifth Gospel he said let me talked about Moses mom Fifth Gospel amen so much my goodness God is good enough anyway just to preach forever he said he said and it isn't Communists that's hurting America he said it's our own rottenness among ourselves amen you know I want to throw this out here just come to me this is fresh he said you know Samson was called of God I got a question for you who killed Samson thank you sister Patty Samson killed them he played him long enough that Samson killed himself and he was a fool by the way he could have died a fighter but he died a fool that's what Abraham preached on although he didn't use Samson but that's another one it was Samson but we don't want to be sentencing amen even though Samson was saved I'm not interested in having a dire a life history like Samson no sir he said it's a rottenness and he said to the morals and it's bacon breaking the back immorals and all these things it's breaking the back of our nation he said motherhood is marred amen and he was watch this he said I'm just reading what I got highlighted he said motherhood and the great principles like that is broken when mothers no just listen to what he said I'm just going to read this paragraph that's all right he's a motherhood in the great principles like that are broken when mothers will pay a hundred dollars for a little snotty-nosed dog excuse the expression and take it in their house with them and give it Mother's Love and right around in the automobile and practice birth control any nation that will sink a stuff is that and our police force will allow her to strip naked in the street and walk down and the things and they censor the TV cast he said oh bonger four or five times married women education is at the end help me out delinquency is at the end yeah thank you thank you that's a twister children there ain't no hope for the children they're gone insane you know I said the other day and I praise God we had a wonderful time with sister Ruth he said if you're a believer well I well you homeschool your kids that's scriptural period and that's with an exclamation mark you can't have no education he said you can't go down to this that school and have a kid get with education now that is word for word because he will be too full more of how when he comes out than he will when he went in amen and let the teacher say something to him just watch this look at that brother so you can't have no education you go down there to that school and have good kid be insane oh right here with education he'll be two for the children of Hal when he comes out oh bless God we got message people that are lawyers and doctors and praise the Lord hallelujah practice and birth control oh I know that's crazy I agree with you I'm right I'm sick right beside you but this was a believer that spoke yet and they do these insane things and would would kill you or poison you do anything the next your children are bearing is that the children bearing is at the end and motherhood and mother motherhood Womanhood and motherhood why birth control practice everywhere and little doggies have taken their place now obviously he's talking there about women in the child bearing age if you have a little doggie in your past a child bearing age you've already had your children but he's talking about having a little doggy and nothing there changing the diapers of the dog you know I never was a big fan of changing diapers and I did it every time it was absolutely needed but it just I just arranged it that it wasn't necessary very many times brother Matt but I get amazed when I drive down the road and men and women and old women that are too old to come to church praise God because they're arthritis and Mr Arthur and all that but they'll Bend out and scoop up well little Rover does on the neighbor's lawn and I'm like foreign God I'm not going to drown in the diaper pail do I remember my sister singing that when I was eight and she was disgusted because she had babies and that stuck with me until my fat gray-haired man there's some things that shouldn't come out of your mind like oh you were a mistake we were planning on three and by golly we got four well I was supposed to be a girl I mean the last five were supposed to be girls sake's alive you don't have seven in a row and you're hoping for another I mean we all know that go to school for that one you see too much said brother Dale in that and too much of you in that see we had a plan my mom and dad had a plan that I would be a girl but God knew a girl couldn't preach and and if if I hadn't they would have knew I wasn't a girl I wouldn't have been here anyway just like all the ones past Vicky wouldn't have been here because see as soon as we went past the Vicki we became poppers because the millionaire family was over righteous day ain't that crazy some of the things people say man God help us man God help us amen motherhood perfect type of our walk with Christ I wonder how much you're surrendering to him I wonder how much times your mother gets up and fixes a baby in the middle of the night I wonder how many times God would like you to get up in the middle of the night fix your spiritual watch I just I just wondered I just wonder if you ain't got what you think you should have spiritually if you've been changing many diapers spiritually in prayer like motherhood and man we know what Sam or the Prophet said in Proverbs about a virtuous woman amen it says that this I'm thinking completely spiritual here it said that she looketh she looketh well on her ways of her household and she eateth not the bread of items spiritually what have you done for Christ is the only thing you will last nothing you're doing her children rise up and call her blessed and her husband also ask her where the money is That was supposed to be there I know it was in there oh I just know it was and he Praises her for spending the money amen the fruit of her hands let her own work praise her indicates and your spiritual walk the fruit of your own hats will praise you when you get to the gates God will never forget God help us God help us I wonder if you could be like God and say that you safely trust God could safely Trust in you that you wouldn't do nothing outside of his word like the heart of her husband safely trusts the sinner because he knows he she would never step out of the Covenant their Covenant what about God's covenant let's close with this Hagar In the Bible in first Samuel and we'll just go through this fast I mean just for uh preacher was Hager was in the Bible am I saying that right hey Hannah I'm sorry I'm sorry yeah had no children hey man and her husband loved her abundantly he had two wives Old Testament we don't do that now amen and he went Year to you know the Tabernacle to pray and Hannah wept earnestly ate and grieved in her heart man she went to the Tabernacle and if there's something in your life that you need like a little bit more bread in your pocketbook or a little bit of husband to come and work and pay your bills as long as he's a believer make really good insure he believes everything it says that she prayed bitterly in her soul this is Samuel 1 1 10. you prayed unto the Lord and wept saw her and she vowed with God she said God if you answer my prayer I'll serve you but not just me now she's speaking for the family but the child you give me to you all the days of his life how she how could she do that she couldn't be sure the child would be like that amen said I will if you and she was specific she she asked for a man child so I'll give them all the days of his life you know the story she conceived God gave it to her and when she had that child Samuel she took him most of you women have a hard time your mothers are all out there but you listen out there mothers as soon as a child was weaned that'd be every child in our church she took them to the priests the Tabernacle and she never took him home she came to church regular she wanted to see her son she had to come to church wow amen it's like something oh God man she took him and kept her Covenant her vow she's reading she brought him back to the house of God and left them there and you know how powerful of a testimony Samuel was and it was because of a mother a hundred percent I'll just fast forward on that testimony Samuel was there and the Tabernacle was falling apart and the priesthood was falling apart and God was moving the pull unto Samuel's heart and God would answer this is just and I'm going to close with this I promise and God would say Samuel and he would jump out and run out and talk to the priest he said you called me the guy's like no I never thought so just go it's the middle of the night for crying out loud would you shut the radio off quit playing that message when you're sleeping you're hearing things coming back the three times I believe it was on the fourth time then God had to tell the whole priest he said it's actually me calling God's talking to us today he's been talking to you for a long time but are we hearing man listen to him God help me you know it's time that we were believers we're believers can I can I read just I I I just pulled this out of my Pulpit you know this is just beautiful it's talking about God and Jehovah and he says he was God was the all-existent one created and he created us off of him and he said so you are a temp you are an amateur of God and he said he gave men to be an amateur God because he was God the father and he man main man God small G and this was what he so he isn't the self-existing one anymore but he exists with his family wow God exists with his family God loves fellowship and that's what he made man for in the first place was the fellowship and he came down and renamed them back to himself because man wouldn't listen and fell because God loves Fellowship that much an object of worship was God but he won God help us amen just beautiful beautiful beautiful words Hallelujah amen motherhood your spiritual life in Christ are you willing to surrender everything as a natural mother would to bring life are you willing spiritually just shut up and put up surrender everything to Christ and his will I close to say this he said there's not one more thing not one single more thing God could do for you but preach the word the words it's already at you he's already given it to you it's up to you if you don't want to buy gross you're afraid if you're I well then you can if you're afraid to live then you can be afraid to die God help us God help me Amen to take him out his word and just step out amen if God said it yeah yeah oh wow God said this in the Bible he said I dare you you want to know where he said that when he talks about he said try me and see if I won't prove my word just try me I dare you I dare you I double dare you and he says right in the Bible that he said I'll take the Lesser and make it Greater I dare you I double dare you and all your spiritual building and God's saying and all this word of God you're saying I don't know I'm afraid you won't give it to me I don't think it's God's will if it's in his word you know what if it's in his words it's Patricia it's God's will okay it's God's will for you to be healthy that's that's just because he didn't make sick people so it's got so you don't forget about that if it's God's will if it's in here it's God's will amen I don't well I think I might you think you might of course you just say God you know the lady in the Bible that was kind to the prophet it's important to be kind you know it's right near the top of the thought you're mad and the prophet said what can I do for you they said well she's Byron she don't have kids he said this time next year this time next year you'll be in the crowd this damnation that's not maybe you say well I'm afraid God won't open that you'd have to say God you backslid but I can assure you ahead of time he won't do that you say but I'm afraid to say that is it not God's will for you to have a family replenish the Earth is that God's word curious you don't think he would want bride children on the earth more than he would judge about children you think the Jezebel the single motherhood and Parenthood and all that they're the only ones that can have kids that sleep around and live a jezebel life and have three or four well no not three or four Thirty or forty different men and they don't know who the man is from and you can have a Holy Covenant in the marriage Cinema the Holy Covenant where God created man or woman to live together and the bad was undefiled and all that and those people can't have kids you just got to become a believer you just got to become a Believer and the prophet say this time next year this time next year we'll have another member in the church amen it'll be junior amen spoken word you are the spoken word you are God's spoken words Prophet said it was first in his thoughts and when he made the logos you were the spoken word and he expects you to speak the word the prophet said in the message that you are the word and you know what he wants done with it and you can you don't have to ask for permission and we've been asking for permission like we're we're growing children and we're asking for information can I can I have a cookie they've got his cookies in here you don't have to ask if you can have a cookie hey man I gotta stop amen please let the Lord have
