[22:09] amen just a good to see my buddy brother
[22:12] Bart amen he's been working hard and and
[22:16] just haven't seen him for a little time
[22:18] and brother Bart sends me nice messages
[22:21] and fellowship and music and different
[22:24] things and it's it's beautiful how the
[22:26] bride of Christ
[22:28] can be friends and have a relationship
[22:31] together
[22:32] amen amen we praise God for that
[22:36] amen hallelujah let's just look into his
[22:38] word this morning and uh just as we're
[22:42] going we're going to turn to Isaiah
[22:45] 28 and then we're going to read in
[22:47] Matthew and just Isaiah
[22:50] 28 uh starting at verse
[22:53] uh
[22:55] two amen and just I just want to make
[22:58] make a a small disclaimer this morning
[23:02] uh uh this was God's plan this was not
[23:05] my plan but I said we were going to
[23:07] preach on Church order and
[23:09] Doctrine and I very very seldom preach
[23:12] more than one message on the same same
[23:15] topic almost almost
[23:17] never um this is going to probably be
[23:20] one of part three at least amen this is
[23:23] just kind of laying a foundation and
[23:25] trying to catch the spirit of Christ as
[23:29] the prophet preached Church order and
[23:31] Doctrine you know the prophet said this
[23:32] he said one of the one of the things
[23:34] that made him the
[23:36] sadus was people
[23:38] misinterpret or mishear what I've
[23:42] spoken the misinterpret mistake amen and
[23:48] uh and and by no
[23:50] means we believe the word of God so
[23:53] we're not talking about Doctrine as far
[23:56] as leaving the doctrine and the princip
[23:57] principles of Christ that's not possible
[24:01] because we're part of
[24:02] him that's just not possible but all of
[24:06] us you know the prophet said that we all
[24:08] have every church is Sovereign every
[24:10] home is Sovereign and we all have our
[24:12] own doctrines like
[24:14] individually that are are are upbringing
[24:18] and different things amen and there's
[24:20] where the trouble is in the body of
[24:23] Christ amen you you'll watch that you
[24:26] you will watch that and we'll look at it
[24:28] in the word of
[24:29] God Amen help us Lord Jesus behold
[24:49] the I got a different scripture than you
[24:56] Amy I got Isa isah
[24:58] 28 oh verse 8 maybe you should try that
[25:03] sorry my PR is small on my iPad I'm
[25:07] sorry I'm afraid to touch my iPad
[25:10] sometimes it disappears on me does
[25:13] tricks amen sorry Amy there we go for
[25:16] all the tables are full of vomit and
[25:18] filthiness so that there is no place
[25:22] clean Whom Shall teach knowledge and
[25:24] whom shall make understand Doctrine and
[25:28] they are they that are wean from the
[25:30] mouth that draw from the breast now
[25:32] there there the Bible's talking about
[25:35] the maturity of Christ amen there
[25:38] there's no way that a mature person
[25:40] needs to separate when they're on the
[25:43] word of
[25:45] God
[25:48] Amen God help us God help me man for
[25:51] precept must be upon precept and precept
[25:54] upon precept and line upon line and and
[25:57] line upon line and here a little there a
[25:59] little for with understanding for with
[26:02] for with staming lips sorry and another
[26:05] tongue he spake to this people to whom
[26:08] he
[26:08] said this the rest wherewith ye may
[26:12] cause the wean to rest the weary to rest
[26:16] and this the
[26:18] refreshing yet they would not hear but
[26:21] the word of Lord the word of the Lord
[26:23] was unto them precept upon precept and
[26:28] line upon line and line upon line and
[26:30] here a little there a little that they
[26:32] might go and fall backward and be broken
[26:36] and a snare be
[26:39] taken wherefore hear ye the word of the
[26:42] Lord ye scornful men that rule this
[26:46] people of
[26:49] Jerusalem
[26:52] wow I would say that today is directed
[26:55] at the ministry where wherefore you
[27:03] ministers that teach Doctrine over God's
[27:08] bride
[27:09] amen be
[27:11] careful careful let's turn to Matthew
[27:15] 116 Matthew 11 116 just one Short
[27:20] scripture here and and I want to just
[27:22] say this as you're turning to Matthew
[27:24] 11:6 you know the prophet said this
[27:26] multiple times they say when you die or
[27:30] you're
[27:31] dying you speak a different
[27:34] language you look that up he said that
[27:36] about 30 some times he said when you die
[27:40] and if we got the baptism of the Holy
[27:42] Ghost this morning we're all language
[27:46] amen it's it's got to be Christ language
[27:48] I don't mean individual language but
[27:49] when we die we're not speaking our own
[27:51] flesh language so that means we laid
[27:54] aside our
[27:55] upbringing that means we laid aside the
[27:58] old Creeds that our daddyy taught
[28:00] us because we're speaking a new
[28:03] language it's Christ language amen amen
[28:06] he said when you die and when Christ
[28:08] died we spoke a different language God
[28:10] help us to grasp that this morning amen
[28:14] one scripture is blessed is he
[28:17] whosoever is not offended in me amen
[28:21] Lord Jesus we pray that you would just
[28:23] bless your word and Lord you just be
[28:25] with the visitors and so many new people
[28:27] here today Lord and we preaching really
[28:29] to the home crowd and God we pray that
[28:31] you'd have your way and and catch the
[28:34] anointing and the spirit that you've
[28:36] revealed to me Lord Jesus in this
[28:38] thought and may your will be done and
[28:41] everything that's done and said be
[28:42] according to your word Lord Jesus we
[28:45] pray your beautiful name we pray amen
[28:48] you may have your seats this morning we
[28:50] welcome you it's a great
[28:53] honor great honor and our privilege our
[28:56] friends and
[28:58] amen
[29:01] hallelujah
[29:08] amen thank you Lord
[29:11] Jesus Hallelujah you know we want to
[29:14] look into this topic of of uh of uh the
[29:18] church order and and just the thoughts
[29:20] and just laying a foundation and my next
[29:22] Sunday Lord willing if he allows me and
[29:24] we continue this same walk I'm going to
[29:26] preach on the the three Wells that Isaac
[29:30] dug and the first two Wells he had to
[29:32] keep moving on and the reason why Isaac
[29:35] had to dig the well but he wasn't
[29:38] allowed to stay with the well and and
[29:40] you know we're going to type that to the
[29:42] three pulls of brother Branham and how
[29:44] brother brandham brought the three pulls
[29:46] but he kept moving amen but the
[29:48] denominational world will never come
[29:50] under the third pull in the word the
[29:52] revealing of the word and the receiving
[29:54] of his seed they'll never do that amen
[29:57] and we just want to carry that on and
[30:00] show it it just is a beautiful type you
[30:02] know and and here in this day you know
[30:04] we know that we type Elisha's Ministry
[30:06] and we have a double portion and we're
[30:08] we're Elisha today a type of Elisha in
[30:11] his ministry and you know we're never
[30:14] ever you know for for us to believe and
[30:17] you know when we would teach Unity of
[30:19] the body of Christ and and these things
[30:21] we all we we we come under Unity of the
[30:24] word but we'll never come under Unity of
[30:27] our individual doctrines that's not
[30:30] going to happen and if you're looking
[30:32] for that you're looking in a in a myth
[30:35] and of dream that will never will never
[30:38] arrive because every home would have its
[30:40] own its own headship you know every
[30:42] Church would have its own headship
[30:44] un I'm not talking about leaving the
[30:46] word I'm talking about
[30:48] individual will will standards amen and
[30:51] here we
[30:52] see here we see so many things in the
[30:55] Bible that are wrote in a Paradox and
[30:58] you have to be a part of the family to
[31:01] understand the family talk you
[31:03] understand what I'm saying you have to
[31:05] be a part of the family of Christ to
[31:07] understand the family's talk amen like
[31:10] the Bible is not wrote like a newspaper
[31:13] we must read it between the lines and
[31:15] and in no way I'm going to say some
[31:17] things that are really out there really
[31:19] out there and in no way am I promoting
[31:21] sin no way no way at
[31:26] all
[31:28] but Abraham
[31:29] lied and when Paul wrote the doctrine
[31:32] men of about him in the New Testament he
[31:34] never ever mentioned it Isaac
[31:37] lied and it was never ever documented to
[31:40] him Rahab lied to hide the
[31:44] servants and she was give the
[31:48] promise now I'll tell you what for
[31:50] brother Dale that's that I have to chew
[31:54] on that one
[31:55] for amen
[31:57] now I don't say that no way to promote
[32:03] lying Bible says that there will be no
[32:06] Liars in
[32:07] heaven but God is the own his own
[32:11] interpreter of his word amen and we
[32:14] should never separate over our
[32:19] own things that we've had to die out to
[32:23] let me let me show you what I mean you
[32:25] know when the prophet preached Church
[32:26] order and Doctrine
[32:28] most of the church order Doctrine he
[32:29] didn't live
[32:32] himself I'm not offending the prophet
[32:35] I'm not I mean I'm not insulting the
[32:36] Prophet The Prophet says that himself
[32:39] the prophet said that his service should
[32:40] not be longer than 30 minutes he he
[32:43] apologizes three times in church order
[32:45] and Doctrine for that the prophet said
[32:47] that a pastor should not be in the Serv
[32:50] like should uh be set aside to come
[32:52] under the holy of holies and be under
[32:54] the anointing before he did that but he
[32:55] almost never did that himself
[32:59] and so see there was things said that
[33:01] were were in context in an ideal
[33:06] situation but weren't
[33:08] law you see what I mean like those are
[33:11] proper
[33:13] things but we're
[33:16] humans you know what I'm saying now now
[33:19] we don't make a trend of coming late to
[33:21] church or different things let me show
[33:23] you something what I'm trying to show
[33:25] you is we we have to
[33:27] we have to respect each other we need to
[33:29] have Grace for each other I didn't say
[33:32] compromise and I didn't say leave the
[33:37] word but no man gives somebody else
[33:40] Revelation if you have a higher
[33:43] Revelation than me you can't give it to
[33:46] me blessed are you Simon bar Jonah Flesh
[33:50] and
[33:51] Blood gave this to you by my Father
[33:55] which was in heaven so all you can do is
[33:58] go and pray for that dumb brother Dale
[34:02] that God would have mercy on me and open
[34:04] my blind
[34:06] eyes you see what I'm saying and so so
[34:09] many times there's friction in the body
[34:11] over things that it don't need to be
[34:13] friction
[34:15] over amen now I don't know why God's
[34:18] doing this but our church here locally
[34:20] have grown and God's blessed us and we
[34:23] fantastic friends that with all my heart
[34:26] I love and I don't want to see Satan
[34:28] come in and change that
[34:31] ever it's of the
[34:33] devil he
[34:35] does and see we need to we need to just
[34:38] have you know we were gone to Salvador
[34:41] and we had a wonderful time and I
[34:43] preached in four different churches and
[34:45] it wasn't until I come home that I even
[34:47] knew who was a member of which church
[34:50] because they were so IND dovetailed like
[34:53] this I couldn't know who sat under who
[34:55] pastor and who the Pastor wasn't close
[34:57] or far or
[35:00] near amen we're not going to have our
[35:03] own clicks and our own bedrooms in
[35:05] heaven amen because we have some kind of
[35:09] a
[35:10] different amen God help us to to realize
[35:14] this in this last day
[35:19] amen
[35:21] hallelujah you know we are the prophet
[35:25] said this he said we are the final voice
[35:28] to the final age under a prophet's
[35:31] Ministry and the only Bible the world
[35:34] ever seee is I know that they're my
[35:37] disciples by how they love one another
[35:41] amen and we we need to we need to mature
[35:44] on this case amen we need to mature
[35:47] greatly in this case you know I want to
[35:49] I want to start out by John here and
[35:51] here we see John and and and and and I'm
[35:54] I'm gonna show you well matter of fact
[35:56] I'm gonna I'm going to go some a
[35:57] different one let's go to Romans 14 1-4
[36:00] and this will lay a strong Foundation
[36:02] that will establish where we're
[36:05] going a strong foundation and and and I
[36:09] want you to to to if you will with me is
[36:12] is is put this together in the
[36:15] scriptures and compare this in every
[36:18] stage of your
[36:19] life him that is weak in the faith
[36:22] receive ye him uhoh that means if you
[36:26] think you got of Revelation and a part
[36:28] of the faith that is greater than I
[36:30] haven't caught and I don't
[36:34] believe you still have to receive
[36:39] me but not
[36:41] doubtful disput
[36:45] disput for one believeth that he may eat
[36:48] all things and another who is weak
[36:51] eateth
[36:53] herbs now I want to tell you what I'm
[36:55] guilty in this are area right here so
[36:57] confession number one I have openly
[37:00] mocked people that don't eat
[37:07] me but the Bible corrects me right
[37:11] here
[37:13] uhhuh he said let not him which eateth
[37:16] despise him that eateth not uhoh that
[37:20] means you're to keep your conviction on
[37:23] eating meat or eating herbs to yourself
[37:26] now I want to tell you what the word of
[37:28] God says that Jesus Sanctified it all
[37:31] for us he told Peter that all is ho he
[37:35] Jesus himself told Peter he said don't
[37:38] call cursed what I
[37:45] bless
[37:47] okay and he actually calls those that
[37:49] can't receive that
[37:52] weak but he don't give you no chance to
[37:55] come against the weak
[37:57] he says You must receive
[37:59] them that means you must have fellowship
[38:02] with them oh bless God I
[38:06] don't
[38:08] uhoh I think that's why the prophet said
[38:10] when he was here there was like a
[38:12] thousand different denominations now we
[38:14] have a thousand different message
[38:17] denominations well bless God I go to son
[38:19] so's Camp me well I don't go to that
[38:22] camp meeting because we got bless God I
[38:23] go to thos camp
[38:25] meeting those are denominational
[38:28] spirits in the
[38:30] message
[38:34] amen amen God help us I I'm sorry for
[38:37] you visitors forgive me I just just you
[38:40] talk to God about this um because uh
[38:44] verse four he said who art thou that
[38:48] judges
[38:51] another
[38:53] uhoh now every one of us if you're
[38:55] breathing this morning morning you've
[38:56] done
[38:59] that thank you brother amen obiously
[39:01] amen for the rest of you if you're
[39:03] breathing this morning you've judged
[39:05] other people's opinion on herbs and
[39:08] meat and
[39:15] doctrines
[39:17] hallelujah amen to his own Master he
[39:21] standeth or
[39:23] filth yay he shall be held up hold it
[39:29] up for
[39:31] God praise God it's not the ministers or
[39:36] the Ley for God is
[39:40] able to make him
[39:43] stand weak and
[39:45] strong amen that's fairly
[39:49] plain God is
[39:51] able to make him stand or strong you see
[39:56] let me let me lay a lay more of a
[39:58] foundation here you see you see they
[40:01] came to Jesus now I would say that Jesus
[40:04] when he was here tabernacled in the
[40:06] flesh I would say that like he had it
[40:09] all together correct I mean he was the
[40:13] fullness of the godhead bodily
[40:15] tabernacled in
[40:17] flesh and the religious World condemned
[40:22] him and those Spirits are very healthy
[40:25] today
[40:28] wo Hallelujah they're very healthy
[40:31] today because Jesus took his disciples
[40:34] in a corn field and they were hungry and
[40:37] they pluck corn on the Sabbath oh bless
[40:40] God would you want me to tell you what
[40:42] in Philippines it's already
[40:46] Monday so what is the Sabbath I mean of
[40:49] course we know the Sabbath is the
[40:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost but if you
[40:52] were in the law under a Sabbath I would
[40:56] was raised under that my dad wouldn't do
[40:58] work on the Sabbath he wouldn't buy or
[40:59] sell on the Sabbath but what's the
[41:01] Sabbath it's already Monday there so
[41:03] it's fine to start to
[41:07] combine what are you going to do if it's
[41:09] in Alaska and it's dark 24 hours a
[41:12] day it's always evening
[41:15] time you see these things they're
[41:18] they're they're they're stumbling blocks
[41:20] in our flesh and here Jesus said he said
[41:24] but Jesus answered he said have you not
[41:26] read that David did when he went into
[41:29] the when he was hungry and went into the
[41:32] Tabernacle and ate the shoe
[41:34] Brad now I'll tell you what they were
[41:37] living under the law when that happened
[41:40] and it was dos and don'ts and God had
[41:43] the right to kill
[41:50] him amen because it was it was in the
[41:54] grace dispensation remember Moses wrote
[41:57] the law Paul wrote Grace and they were
[42:00] doing dos and don'ts and the shoe bread
[42:03] was for the the the
[42:06] ministry the
[42:09] Tabernacle and was he
[42:13] condemned now you you see what I'm
[42:15] saying you're not all gonna we have this
[42:19] crazy idea in this world of Education
[42:22] that we're going to have
[42:24] Jehovah completely figured out and we're
[42:26] going to put them in our box I'm going
[42:28] to put them right in my box right
[42:30] here and the box is going to have the
[42:32] address
[42:38] Wyoming
[42:40] sorry that ain't going to
[42:45] work amen now I'm in no way condoning I
[42:51] believe the prophet said this he said
[42:53] this is my absolute this was the
[42:55] prophet's quotebook that's what he
[42:57] quoted all the time and I believe that
[43:00] the the the Holy Spirit has come through
[43:02] a prophet and Anointed The it revealed
[43:04] the Mysteries that was everything was
[43:06] already in here completely revealed it
[43:08] and it's a brand new book and if our
[43:10] Prophet had to read between the
[43:12] lines you're going to have to read
[43:14] between the
[43:18] lines can you explain this can you
[43:21] explain how David was able to do
[43:25] that that's
[43:28] recorded amen I have this here
[43:33] somewhere in first Samuel anyway where
[43:36] David went in the priest actually feared
[43:44] David and David did that and God said
[43:47] we'll come to it
[43:48] later and David said there's a man after
[43:50] my own heart and he's breaking the word
[43:52] of
[43:53] God now I'm not I'm not bringing that
[43:56] that I don't I don't believe for one
[43:57] second I should go out and start
[43:58] breaking the word of God because I would
[44:00] be in
[44:01] sin but I'm trying to stretch I'm trying
[44:04] to lean you on this side of the road to
[44:07] bring us back in the
[44:09] center that we've separated over things
[44:12] that we thought we had figured
[44:15] out and there's nothing wrong with you
[44:19] you know there was nothing you know you
[44:20] know when we went to Salvador all four
[44:22] of those churches were within a 20 Drive
[44:24] half an hour stretch Maybe
[44:27] the there nothing wrong with that but if
[44:30] there was anything going on it was one
[44:34] church when we go to heaven it'll be one
[44:37] church amen it'll be one church and so
[44:41] we have to so here here let's just jump
[44:43] forward here and we go into to John here
[44:47] and now the the prophet said that John
[44:49] was the greatest messenger Of All Times
[44:53] They said everybody else in the word of
[44:55] God came and talked about Jesus but John
[44:59] actually said there he is right
[45:05] there Jesus himself said there was not a
[45:08] greater man born of a
[45:10] woman than
[45:13] John but John got in
[45:16] prison and we get in our prison
[45:19] sometimes it's called the lack of
[45:22] Fellowship you know the first thing I
[45:24] told the church when I come back from
[45:25] Mador is I said you all need to get on a
[45:27] plane and
[45:30] travel because see every country has
[45:32] different different uh what do you call
[45:35] it different uh you know Customs thank
[45:38] you
[45:39] customs and we separate over our custom
[45:42] oh bless God if I don't wear TI and I
[45:49] don't
[45:50] Customs you go to the Philippines and
[45:53] 90% of the people are wearing a t-shirt
[45:55] blue jeans and flipflops it's
[46:05] 120 you would die if you wore a threp
[46:09] suit it's called heat
[46:13] stroke you see
[46:15] Customs you see what I mean and when and
[46:18] if so any time we're going to bring a
[46:20] group of Believers
[46:23] together uhhuh
[46:26] we all have our little
[46:30] niche and we have to set that little
[46:32] niche aside I want to tell you something
[46:34] brother Dale had to do brother Dale had
[46:36] a lot to learn in his lifetime but I had
[46:38] to set niches aside just when we were in
[46:40] a Salvador let me just tell you
[46:43] one they give the time of the church
[46:46] when it starts so like a good brother uh
[46:50] we came a half an hour early but they
[46:53] announced the time a half an hour before
[46:55] the service starts a half an hour early
[46:57] so I sat in the Pew for over an hour and
[46:59] I was getting bad sores and they hadn't
[47:02] even sang the first song I oh bless God
[47:05] you're a
[47:06] liar no that was their
[47:09] custom that was their
[47:12] custom you see and if I would have let
[47:16] believe me believe me you've all been
[47:19] there if you're breathing you've all
[47:20] been there if I would to let Satan W me
[47:23] up I'll tell that person a thing or two
[47:27] here I am it was only 102 here I am
[47:31] sitting
[47:35] here and Satan is just saying
[47:39] oh he ain't getting nothing out of this
[47:41] service
[47:45] today did they do anything wrong no did
[47:49] I do anything wrong nope who
[47:51] won the devil if you let him you see
[47:56] do you know what that that church is his
[47:59] own custom
[48:00] is you want to fasten your seat belt for
[48:03] this you in the music department Jared
[48:05] for sure
[48:06] you if you're in the music
[48:09] department and you don't show up one
[48:12] hour before the half an hour before the
[48:14] service
[48:15] starts you're not allowed to play in the
[48:17] musician you sit in the
[48:20] Pew that's an hour and a half plus
[48:23] before the first
[48:24] song
[48:28] now is it my place to say anything ah
[48:32] thank you brother Gord
[48:34] no if those people are happy and they're
[48:37] serving God praise God I'm in Rome I'm
[48:40] going to do as a
[48:42] Romans do you see what I mean but we let
[48:46] Satan come in and then we go behind the
[48:48] scene and we find another person and we
[48:54] go and then when that person leaves the
[48:57] church
[48:58] splits and Satan's
[49:01] going I got him I got
[49:08] him you see it with
[49:10] me so remember that Paul brought
[49:14] Grace and and let me tell you a story
[49:18] about this you know there's a a story
[49:21] and probably some of you have read it or
[49:22] seen
[49:23] it but there was a man
[49:26] that was a Christian believer doing his
[49:28] best and he comes to
[49:32] church now is there any Angels here I
[49:35] know there's Angels here but I can't see
[49:37] them so like okay the ones I can see
[49:40] haven't put their hands on and by no
[49:43] fault of his

[50:20] human okay so you're a human and his
[50:24] cell phone rung and the preacher rebuked
[50:26] him from the pulpit the Deacon came from
[50:29] the back and he rebuked him and his wife
[50:31] rebuked him on the way
[50:33] home guess where he went that night he
[50:36] went to the
[50:38] bar he went to the bar and he was so
[50:43] uptight from getting attacked

[51:22] the deacons were in the church and and
[51:23] that just made me proud
[51:29] because I don't want people to know who
[51:30] the deacons
[51:32] are I don't want a church where the
[51:34] deacons go around with a
[51:50] revolver oh I know I know I know the

[52:36] me when I went to a
[52:40] church not that long
[52:43] ago
[52:44] and it was fine it didn't affect I don't
[52:49] really know why but my wife came to me
[52:51] after he said honey what was he doing
[52:56] I said I don't know but for whatever
[52:59] reason it didn't affect me but the Min
[53:03] I'm preaching and the minister comes
[53:05] right up like almost walks five feet
[53:07] from the pole I thought he was going to
[53:08] stop me from preaching then he gets out
[53:10] and he walks down the side of the church
[53:11] and he's looking in every window
[53:19] like and my wife's there and she's
[53:21] distracted because of the
[53:24] distraction

[53:30] order you know what I
[53:33] mean amen let me get back and I'm sorry
[53:37] if this is different than you thought
[53:39] I'm sorry but it's it's it's it's for
[53:41] it's just for the local crowd amen but I
[53:44] I don't want to see Satan be allowed to
[53:47] come in you know if you like green and I
[53:49] like blue and you think I should wear
[53:52] you know there's ministers think that
[53:53] it's it's against a laot of preaching
[53:54] not way shirt because it's reference I
[53:57] mean if okay I'm sorry I disappointed
[54:00] you this morning but maybe don't tell me
[54:02] you think that way I mean or don't tell
[54:06] anybody else at least come and tell me
[54:10] privately you see what I'm
[54:13] saying but here John was the one that
[54:15] introduced
[54:17] Christ he
[54:20] baptized now I be pretty
[54:23] hard to not understand who he was when
[54:26] the Holy Spirit came down in the form of
[54:28] a dove and a voice come out of that and
[54:30] said this is my beloved Son hear ye him
[54:35] now you can't get a lot clearer message
[54:37] than
[54:44] that and when John got in his livelihood
[54:47] he said I'm not sure if you're the one
[54:48] or
[54:50] not and that he gave Jesus the greatest
[54:54] insult
[54:56] a human could have
[54:58] gave I don't know if you're
[55:02] qualified I don't think you're going to
[55:04] cut the
[55:05] Jesus you could never be my
[55:08] pastor I'd never go across the road to
[55:11] hear you
[55:12] preach are you even
[55:17] him huh and bless God if that was me I
[55:21] i' say I'll show him a thing or two
[55:26] well if you haven't died yet you would
[55:28] have but see when you die you have a new
[55:32] language let me show you what that new
[55:34] language
[55:36] was Jesus answered and said unto them he
[55:38] said go show John the things that you
[55:41] hear and
[55:42] see and he said the blind receive their
[55:45] sight the lame walk the lepers are
[55:46] cleansed the death hear the dead are
[55:49] raised up and the power of the Gospel
[55:52] preached to him and then he says these
[55:54] words said blessed are
[55:57] he who is not
[56:00] offended because I am who I
[56:09] am and as they departed Jesus began to
[56:12] insult
[56:18] John and he said what went you out in
[56:21] the wilderness to see what came you to
[56:24] wyom to see you came to see brother tail
[56:28] you're going to be sadly
[56:29] disappointed I'm
[56:32] obes I wore a green
[56:36] shirt a reed shaking in the wind he said
[56:40] what want you out to see a man clothes
[56:42] in white linen oh praise God I didn't
[56:44] wear a white shirt this morning maybe I
[56:46] should have even Jesus talking about it
[56:48] behold they wear soft clothing in King's
[56:53] houses he looks like the a
[56:56] bishop
[56:58] oh but what want ye out to see a prophet
[57:02] yay I say unto you more than a now how
[57:05] could he been more than a
[57:08] prophet more than a prophet the only way
[57:10] he could have been as the wife of Christ
[57:12] the bride of Christ like you are this
[57:14] morning he said for this is he whom was
[57:18] written behold I'll send my messenger
[57:20] before my face to prepare the way for
[57:22] thee verily I say unto
[57:26] you you see Jesus returned the greatest
[57:30] the highest
[57:32] compliment it couldn't have been any
[57:35] higher it's not physically
[57:38] possible for the greatest insult
[57:43] receive that's
[57:45] scriptural Bible says blessed are you
[57:47] that are persecuted for righteousness
[57:49] sake for rejoice and be ex hallelujah
[57:54] praise God they didn't recognize me
[57:58] Hallelujah they didn't recognize
[58:00] Jesus they called him
[58:06] belah
[58:08] amen but you can tell by the
[58:11] fruits whether you've died
[58:14] yet because your
[58:17] language exposes you they said that
[58:21] about
[58:22] Peter here Peter is cursed
[58:25] Christ to save his what he thought was
[58:28] his own
[58:34] n and a woman
[58:38] said your speech she wasn't talking
[58:42] about the
[58:43] car your
[58:46] tongue reveals who you
[58:49] are
[58:51] amen let me ask you does and I'm sorry
[58:55] this was kind of on the same theme we
[58:57] preached on living a sermon but does our
[59:00] tongue reveal who we
[59:02] are does my tongue reveal who I
[59:08] am he's still working on me don't kid
[59:11] yourself there's no doubt about it we
[59:15] have no
[59:17] right brother Dale has no right to go
[59:20] behind the scenes and say you know this
[59:22] is a wonderful brother and sister
[59:25] oh that's up the devil right there close
[59:29] the garbage
[59:36] can I understand that maybe in the case
[59:39] of if you were if ministers were trying
[59:41] to protect what they thought were sheep
[59:44] God's sheep and there was a wolf that
[59:46] they actually believed was a wolf
[59:53] and amen see we have to be careful that
[59:57] we don't devour each
[59:59] other a prophet said he said We Fight
[1:00:02] Together in the front yard we fight
[1:00:05] against each other in the backyard but
[1:00:07] nobody knows about
[1:00:08] it nobody knows about it you know in
[1:00:12] Jeremiah the Lord came to if you read
[1:00:13] Jeremiah 30 the beginning the word of
[1:00:15] the Lord came to Jeremiah in Jeremiah 1
[1:00:17] and here he's talking about Jacob and
[1:00:20] he's talking about how Jacob had battled
[1:00:22] and people had come against him and and
[1:00:24] you read in verse 16 he said therefore
[1:00:26] they all that will devour
[1:00:28] you will be devoured
[1:00:33] themselves we need to be careful bride
[1:00:35] of
[1:00:36] Christ that we don't Devour the bride of
[1:00:39] Christ amongst the bride of Christ we
[1:00:42] don't need to point fingers outside the
[1:00:44] bride of Christ we just the bride of
[1:00:47] Christ you know if you don't agree with
[1:00:49] somebody say bless God him in that area
[1:00:52] and whatever he's doing for Christ you
[1:00:54] know if you want to be kicked I and my
[1:00:57] home Church probably knows this but if
[1:00:59] you ever want to be kicked do something
[1:01:00] for Christ and you won't have to worry
[1:01:03] you'll have a lineup they'll wait to
[1:01:04] kick
[1:01:06] you that's not
[1:01:08] right we're not going in a Rapture like
[1:01:11] that oh bless God he done that way bless
[1:01:14] God I would have picked a different
[1:01:15] address I would have started a different
[1:01:17] time I wouldn't have ate I would have
[1:01:20] ate I wouldn't have wore a green
[1:01:23] chart I wouldn't have picked
[1:01:31] him
[1:01:34] huh and that you know the message Hub is
[1:01:36] a great thing for ministers and the
[1:01:39] bride and so I went to the message Hub
[1:01:42] here on Jeremiah 30 verse 16 and 17 and
[1:01:46] the prophet commented on
[1:01:48] this and we want to read it he said how
[1:01:52] I would love to sprend the rest of the a
[1:01:54] few minutes and now I'd like to pick
[1:01:56] this up right here he's talking about
[1:01:58] that Jeremiah
[1:01:59] 30 amen 16 and 17 you want to read
[1:02:03] Jeremiah 30 but 16 and
[1:02:05] 17 and you can maybe pull them up and
[1:02:07] switch them if you want jerem girls he
[1:02:10] said regardless of how many
[1:02:13] people regardless of how many of the
[1:02:16] churches have gone
[1:02:18] back stay under the
[1:02:21] blood he said that's the place to abide
[1:02:25] in our outs ups and downs thick and thin
[1:02:30] whatever it may
[1:02:32] be stay under the
[1:02:35] blood but here he's talking about uh uh
[1:02:39] one of the daughters of of uh or or
[1:02:41] sorry this was uh uh Naomi when they
[1:02:45] went out from the land and God took her
[1:02:47] husband and her two sons amen and the
[1:02:50] daughters were with and he said she
[1:02:51] thought she would go to a better place
[1:02:54] and join mother group see here in this
[1:02:57] time people will always move because of
[1:03:00] famine or
[1:03:02] hardships but hardships are what build
[1:03:04] your character let me just throw this in
[1:03:07] here you know I told you about Pastor
[1:03:09] Jose and and being in El Salvador and
[1:03:11] him testifying to us stuff uh that you
[1:03:15] know I didn't even know about their
[1:03:17] Civil War in their country but you know
[1:03:20] all those people that we minister to
[1:03:22] live through that hardship and I'm just
[1:03:25] thinking
[1:03:27] wow I would have
[1:03:30] run I would have
[1:03:32] run all the old people lived through the
[1:03:35] Civil War the army shooting at the
[1:03:39] people then after the Civil War they
[1:03:42] lived through the
[1:03:44] gangs you know we St it at the pastor's
[1:03:46] house where he moved he moved this front
[1:03:48] door right out to the sidewalk put a
[1:03:50] gate because the gangs came and would
[1:03:53] knock and demand money and he pulled
[1:03:55] this girl out of school but they still
[1:03:57] went to church when the gangs were
[1:04:00] everywhere to demand money for
[1:04:06] protection I'm like these people have
[1:04:09] just went through
[1:04:12] basically well really bad
[1:04:15] times and they still serve
[1:04:18] God you know we're
[1:04:21] soft you know like look at China you
[1:04:23] know the I I'm just trying to I'm not
[1:04:25] trying I'm going to clarify this again
[1:04:28] I'm not condoning
[1:04:30] sin but your brothers and sisters in
[1:04:33] China lie every time they get
[1:04:42] together you know how they buy a
[1:04:45] birthday cake it's against the law for
[1:04:47] them to gather and if any Authority
[1:04:50] comes in the church they say we're
[1:04:51] having a birthday party that's a blatant
[1:04:53] lie are they your brothers and
[1:04:56] sisters well you don't have it's up to
[1:04:58] you to decide if they
[1:05:00] are they're liying to me you see what I
[1:05:04] mean see like when we draw hard
[1:05:07] lines I wouldn't have blessed God I'd
[1:05:10] never do that maybe you wouldn't but
[1:05:12] maybe it's recorded in the Bible
[1:05:14] multiple times that they did it look at
[1:05:17] Moses when God told him to pick a wife
[1:05:19] and his sister marked God and she struck
[1:05:21] her with
[1:05:22] Leprosy which is Eternal eternally
[1:05:28] lost I don't know God's God why do you
[1:05:30] do it I don't know it's not my
[1:05:34] business but it's not
[1:05:37] yours you know what I'm
[1:05:41] saying he
[1:05:44] said he said she left to join another
[1:05:46] group because they were having some
[1:05:47] troubles spiritual bread wasn't
[1:05:51] there restore it back I will restore it
[1:05:54] sayith the Lord he said stay in now
[1:05:56] watch this is a commandment the prophet
[1:05:58] saying he said stay in the field where
[1:06:01] it comes
[1:06:03] from in other words don't run when
[1:06:05] hardships
[1:06:09] come so we find that she began a long
[1:06:11] journey
[1:06:13] back because she had heard there was
[1:06:16] Revival and you'll notice it was in the
[1:06:18] barle
[1:06:22] season see we we we think sometimes we
[1:06:25] think we're going to help God I'll help
[1:06:28] you make up your
[1:06:29] decision you know what I mean and so we
[1:06:33] we want we want we want to be a
[1:06:36] bible-based message church but we don't
[1:06:40] want to devour each
[1:06:43] other we can actually disagree and you
[1:06:46] don't need to tell
[1:06:49] me amen that that that that brings Unity
[1:06:53] under the word
[1:06:55] it it like amen you you know I feel like
[1:06:59] there's something on the you know when
[1:07:01] when the when the the cloud came down
[1:07:03] and the seven angels and it was it was
[1:07:05] Christ the headship came down many
[1:07:07] people told the prophet he said go tell
[1:07:10] the scientists and the news what this
[1:07:12] really is and the prophet started to
[1:07:20] go and God stopped them the holy he says
[1:07:22] it like this he said the holy Spirit
[1:07:24] stop me he said it's not for
[1:07:27] them don't throw your pearls before the
[1:07:29] swine so I I brought I brought that up
[1:07:32] to say you know if God's gave you
[1:07:35] Revelation or a cut that you know is
[1:07:39] different than the
[1:07:41] pastors or anybody else's just keep it
[1:07:44] to
[1:07:46] yourself you know I I heard a minister
[1:07:49] talk you know I'm we we're doing good on
[1:07:52] time but I I got a a lot of stuff here
[1:07:54] to show you and things that our Prophet
[1:07:57] said you know I've noticed in the
[1:07:59] ministry that people will really hang on
[1:08:01] one part of what the prophet said but
[1:08:03] then when he comes on another spot
[1:08:05] they're kind of kind of loose on that
[1:08:08] you know and I say well if you're going
[1:08:09] to take a little bit of it is it okay if
[1:08:12] we take it
[1:08:14] all let me let me just well let me I
[1:08:17] I'll try to stay in order here
[1:08:19] but he said amongst a lot of people we
[1:08:22] find a where there's a lot of
[1:08:25] motions oh there you go and so forth and
[1:08:30] there becomes titling and
[1:08:32] backbiting and all kinds of
[1:08:35] ungodly
[1:08:36] things brother that's seuic acid in the
[1:08:40] church and it's demon
[1:08:44] power Spirit of man and woman who get
[1:08:48] among one another and try to push off
[1:08:51] and say well that's this ain't not right
[1:08:54] that Pastor is wrong this ain't right
[1:08:56] that Ministry is wrong bless God I have
[1:08:58] the spoken
[1:09:01] word that's not right well if you just
[1:09:04] Chase it down 90% of the time he said
[1:09:08] nine out of 10 times the very
[1:09:11] person that's making a stir in the
[1:09:15] group is the person that ain't right
[1:09:18] with
[1:09:20] God another place he said if you'll look
[1:09:23] in their closet normally they'll have a
[1:09:28] skeleton he said let me read it he said
[1:09:30] that very person making a steer is not
[1:09:32] right amen he said God hates Discord
[1:09:36] among the Brethren be reverent be holy
[1:09:41] love God and stand by
[1:09:44] God as long as you know your life is
[1:09:48] right and your heart is pure and your
[1:09:50] thought is pure and love toward the
[1:09:52] brother and trying to uphold the the
[1:09:53] kingdom of God we're not most cases
[1:09:56] we're not trying to uphold the kingdom
[1:09:57] of God we're trying to uphold our own
[1:10:00] kingdom amen thank you
[1:10:04] brother well that'll hurt my
[1:10:06] pride maybe that's what you
[1:10:11] need
[1:10:13] amen who does the church belong to whose
[1:10:17] bride is it do you know eler when he
[1:10:19] brought Rebecca to Isaac he's never
[1:10:21] mentioned again so the pastor wasn't too
[1:10:25] valuable in that
[1:10:27] case it's about Christ and his bride his
[1:10:30] wife it's not you do to me we're if if
[1:10:33] if you're going to somebody and he's
[1:10:35] pointing to himself oh run for your life
[1:10:40] man enticing Spirits going forth demons
[1:10:44] under dis
[1:10:47] discretion and the last days we're in
[1:10:50] the last days we're in the end times
[1:10:53] amen God help
[1:10:56] us I'm saying this for the bride of
[1:10:59] Christ we must we must dwell together
[1:11:02] here before we're going to dwell
[1:11:04] together there amen and anybody that
[1:11:07] can't dwell together here ain't going to
[1:11:11] be
[1:11:13] there amen now I'm not saying that there
[1:11:16] I think every town should have a
[1:11:20] chch be able to come together whenever
[1:11:23] it's you know there's a big pwell going
[1:11:26] on
[1:11:28] amen
[1:11:30] hallelujah amen so I mentioned about
[1:11:33] Abraham
[1:11:35] Isaac and Rahab
[1:11:39] already Rahab lied and got blessing for
[1:11:42] it that's a
[1:11:44] paradox that's that's a paradox you can
[1:11:47] study that as long as you want to it's a
[1:11:49] paradox she blatantly
[1:11:52] lied
[1:11:56] amen so you you can you know you hear
[1:11:59] people say oh bless God we should follow
[1:12:01] what the government says Rahab never
[1:12:03] they K came to her
[1:12:06] house said turn them
[1:12:08] over she said they've already
[1:12:12] gone I'll say amen for
[1:12:15] you do I understand all that NOP I don't
[1:12:20] but we have to be careful we don't drive
[1:12:21] our Stakes down too far because when we
[1:12:23] do that we
[1:12:25] separate and that's not of
[1:12:28] God
[1:12:30] Amen God help
[1:12:35] us amen we already mentioned about David
[1:12:40] that's 1
[1:12:42] Samuel 21 1-6 1 Samuel
[1:12:48] 1 21 1-6 where David went in the
[1:12:51] Tabernacle and took the SHO bread that
[1:12:54] was
[1:12:55] unlawful for him to
[1:12:58] do and God never said one word about it
[1:13:00] matter of fact quite the opposite God
[1:13:03] actually used that for an example in the
[1:13:04] New Testament how he never judged
[1:13:07] it you see to me you're trying to figure
[1:13:10] out this you know the the prophet said
[1:13:12] things like this he said you're never
[1:13:14] going to learn and study and find out
[1:13:16] who job is your brain's only three
[1:13:19] pounds you might be a genius but he's
[1:13:22] Jehovah
[1:13:24] amen I I I heard that the person
[1:13:27] answering an atheist you know and
[1:13:28] talking about the computer and the
[1:13:30] definition of God and and and he said he
[1:13:33] said if you could figure out my God in
[1:13:35] your three prown bring it wouldn't be
[1:13:36] the God I
[1:13:38] serve so our Prophet said this he said
[1:13:40] if you find somebody that's got all the
[1:13:42] answers even though in the same sentence
[1:13:44] we believe all the Mysteries are
[1:13:47] revealed he said run for your life
[1:13:49] because he don't
[1:13:52] know
[1:13:59] wow here the prophet talks about another
[1:14:02] thing I want to show you how God Chang
[1:14:05] and I just got two or three more things
[1:14:07] it's just quarter after 11 we're doing
[1:14:08] good
[1:14:10] amen here here the prophet I want to
[1:14:12] show you how the prophet's Revelation
[1:14:14] grew and and I want to I want to close
[1:14:16] with a a real shocker to you but here
[1:14:19] here the prophet was in his own church
[1:14:22] and he had been visitors and he was
[1:14:25] preaching New Year's Eve service and he
[1:14:27] was preaching on Daniel and
[1:14:30] Revelations amen and the people got so
[1:14:36] excited by the way I just for a
[1:14:38] disclaimer if you get excited in the
[1:14:39] church when you're preaching it won't
[1:14:40] distract me it'll be just say sium it
[1:14:43] won't matter if you're dancing shouting
[1:14:45] or walking or if it's in the spirit it
[1:14:46] won't affect me because it's in the same
[1:14:48] spirit
[1:14:50] amen and the prophet said I was so
[1:14:53] skeptic of that kind in my heart
[1:14:56] criticize that in my heart people
[1:14:59] started rejoicing and they were free and
[1:15:02] you know the story I know you know but
[1:15:04] he tells this in 61 by the way and only
[1:15:08] believe and he said a a woman came out
[1:15:11] and started dancing in the
[1:15:14] alleyway he said i' never been to a
[1:15:16] dance in my
[1:15:18] life uh oh see I can understand this
[1:15:22] because we weren't allowed to dance when
[1:15:24] we were kids and when the school had a
[1:15:26] dance at the public school we s out they
[1:15:28] knew that from our parents amen so I can
[1:15:32] fit right into where the prophet's
[1:15:33] thinking was that's
[1:15:38] evil and then he said I started thinking
[1:15:40] you
[1:15:41] know these two or three people I at
[1:15:44] first he says Oh my he said what are
[1:15:46] they doing in my
[1:15:48] church couldn't they just serve God and
[1:15:50] shut up they're being so on
[1:15:53] disrespectful that's not Church order
[1:15:55] and daughter chist God things are out of
[1:15:58] control
[1:16:00] uhoh and then he said I got thinking
[1:16:04] about the Bible this is all when it's
[1:16:05] going on he said right up and down the
[1:16:07] floor he said as hard as she could go
[1:16:09] she was dancing like that that old girl
[1:16:11] about 16 or 18 we would have you know
[1:16:13] what a 16 year old girl started dancing
[1:16:15] around this church this
[1:16:17] morning I'll guarantee you there's some
[1:16:19] of you in there with
[1:16:21] question you know why you know how I
[1:16:23] know that because you're a
[1:16:25] human ah she's too young to know ah
[1:16:28] she's too old to know I wouldn't do that
[1:16:32] I've never done
[1:16:33] that that's exactly how the prophet
[1:16:39] thought praise
[1:16:42] God and he said you
[1:16:45] know he said isn't that something he
[1:16:48] said right here in my
[1:16:49] church however they am I going to live
[1:16:52] this down
[1:16:54] they're they're they're cursing the
[1:16:55] church see he said watching her like
[1:16:57] this in my thought he said what are they
[1:16:59] doing for why why do they have to do
[1:17:06] this I'm trying to show see the prophet
[1:17:09] was trying to put a cap on it but it was
[1:17:13] God and he
[1:17:15] said why could what watch the prophet
[1:17:18] watch his language he said why couldn't
[1:17:20] they just play their music and went on
[1:17:23] and let it
[1:17:25] alone oh bless God I wouldn't have done
[1:17:28] it that
[1:17:30] way
[1:17:32] uhuh so so because of that you won't go
[1:17:35] to that camp meeting you won't go to
[1:17:38] that special
[1:17:42] meetings and I thought well that what
[1:17:45] watch his exact words this paragraph 10
[1:17:47] this was a 61 mess he said that's
[1:17:51] terrible that's terrible
[1:17:53] they haven't got church order and
[1:17:59] doctor now now you know I believe in
[1:18:02] church order and Doctrine I'm just I'm
[1:18:03] showing you a I'm showing you a balance
[1:18:05] here show I'm showing you the balance
[1:18:08] from church
[1:18:09] order if you're not in order you're
[1:18:12] disrespectful I'm not condoning
[1:18:17] disrespect no no disrespect needs
[1:18:21] the the rod of
[1:18:24] Direction but we're not but this ain't
[1:18:27] the case see this was it was a it was a
[1:18:32] Creed that he had grew up with and he
[1:18:35] he'd been raised with it he never done
[1:18:37] it and he didn't understand it and he
[1:18:39] thought it was out of control the
[1:18:41] prophet and he's telling this in
[1:18:45] 61 and only believe and he said I got to
[1:18:48] thinking now there in the Bible there
[1:18:49] was things like dancing and I got to
[1:18:51] remember that David danced around the
[1:18:53] ark and all these
[1:18:54] things and he said he danced before the
[1:18:57] Lord and the Lord said he was a man
[1:18:58] after my own heart he said I got to
[1:19:00] think it well that's
[1:19:02] not you see how
[1:19:06] he uhhuh that would be the same way as
[1:19:09] brother Dale going a half an hour early
[1:19:11] on a service that's already booked a
[1:19:12] half an hour early and so I sat there
[1:19:14] for an hour and 10 minutes before the
[1:19:15] first song Started I like how my wife
[1:19:18] like I'm like
[1:19:21] this
[1:19:26] bless God that's not how we do
[1:19:33] it yeah and he said I got to thinking
[1:19:36] well maybe I haven't got the victory he
[1:19:39] said he said he realized that he talked
[1:19:41] about maram that went dancing with the
[1:19:43] tambourine when the children of Israel
[1:19:45] crossed the Red Sea and all the sisters
[1:19:46] come up and danc and it was all Victory
[1:19:49] and thing he said maybe I'm not
[1:19:50] converted maybe I ain't got the victory'
[1:19:52] and he see I got to thinking about this
[1:19:54] and he said you know what happened after
[1:19:56] a while he said I started patting my
[1:19:57] feet and he said before you know what I
[1:19:58] was out dancing on the aisle with the
[1:20:01] sister now that's a drastic
[1:20:04] change and most of us sadly most of us
[1:20:07] wouldn't be willing to do it would' say
[1:20:09] ah bless God I've done this for 30 years
[1:20:12] I ain't about to change
[1:20:16] now God give me this and I'm not moving
[1:20:19] to
[1:20:21] this that's what the denominational
[1:20:23] churches did said God give me this but
[1:20:25] I'm not moving to
[1:20:27] this and God said no problem I moved on
[1:20:30] he went from Luther to Wesley and then
[1:20:33] he went from Wesley to Pentecost real
[1:20:36] the gifts and then he went to the
[1:20:37] opening of the
[1:20:38] word uhuh just like Isaac drilled one
[1:20:42] well he he unplugged all his his own
[1:20:45] Wells of David his dad Abraham he
[1:20:47] unplugged all those Wells and then he
[1:20:48] went over and he went to this church and
[1:20:50] he dug a
[1:20:51] well and I'm getting into next Sunday
[1:20:53] serving but this is this is just
[1:20:55] powerful I mean this revealed my whole
[1:20:57] life when God showed me this and there
[1:21:01] was no problem when Isaac was digging
[1:21:03] the well brother Matt but as soon as
[1:21:05] water come up and there was signs and
[1:21:07] wonders look out Go the whole place
[1:21:11] filled up there wasn't even room for
[1:21:16] Isaac amazing how that
[1:21:19] happened well this is mine this
[1:21:23] building's mine this ministry is mine
[1:21:25] it's mine this God's mine this message
[1:21:28] is
[1:21:29] mine and I won't share bless God you're
[1:21:33] gonna have to go get dig another
[1:21:36] well that's what Isaac had to do and
[1:21:39] Isaac said okay I love you Brothers but
[1:21:41] there's not room for me to get a drink
[1:21:43] of water so I'm going to go and he
[1:21:45] said they did the people that kept it
[1:21:47] remember they didn't dig
[1:21:51] it they didn't dig it so he went to wall
[1:21:54] number two and you know what wall number
[1:21:57] two was I'm sorry for those of you be
[1:21:59] here next Sunday but he deal the world
[1:22:01] number two and there was no water in
[1:22:02] that well
[1:22:04] either until the water came and it was W
[1:22:08] and you know what sprung up on that
[1:22:10] well hatred and envy said bless God I
[1:22:14] don't like
[1:22:15] you you think I'm making this up you
[1:22:18] read your
[1:22:18] Bible that's why the prophet couldn't
[1:22:20] find nobody in the second pull to to
[1:22:23] have them preach in the thir bless God I
[1:22:24] don't like your ministry no
[1:22:26] more I'm going to go to a
[1:22:29] different I'm going to send my
[1:22:31] missionary money somewhere else where
[1:22:33] God can really use
[1:22:36] it and you know what Isaac did he said
[1:22:39] oh I love you Brothers but I can't drink
[1:22:42] so I'm going to go and I'm going to dig
[1:22:43] another
[1:22:46] well and the water come
[1:22:49] up and praise God he said this is what
[1:22:52] the prophet said in the Bible said the
[1:22:55] Lord has made room for us
[1:23:00] all the Lord's made room for us all who
[1:23:04] dug the
[1:23:06] wells and he wasn't able to keep
[1:23:10] them
[1:23:15] uhhuh
[1:23:16] powerful you wonder why you got to move
[1:23:19] in your spiritual life where something
[1:23:21] starts in your spiritual life life and
[1:23:23] there's no water there for you to
[1:23:25] drink read
[1:23:30] Isaac do you think he was happy to move
[1:23:32] on does anybody have any idea what it's
[1:23:34] like to dig a well back then well if you
[1:23:38] want to have an idea I have some
[1:23:39] pictures from Uganda where they dug it
[1:23:41] all by hand 50 I think they went about
[1:23:44] 56 feet before they hit any water they
[1:23:47] come back and went another 20t deep and
[1:23:48] then put brick around it that was at the
[1:23:50] orphanage by hand no safety precautions
[1:23:53] in there if that well would have caved
[1:23:55] in they would have been buried to life
[1:23:56] and they would
[1:24:02] just I'm not the man going down there
[1:24:05] now it's 120 with
[1:24:09] air there wasn't a big Breeze down in
[1:24:11] that well 70 feet in the
[1:24:14] ground can you
[1:24:16] imagine I'm trying to think of
[1:24:19] Isaac if I had been Isaac I would have
[1:24:22] pulled out my guns and said uh excuse me
[1:24:26] this is my
[1:24:27] water I'm just being I'm just human
[1:24:32] enough you think you would have just W
[1:24:34] oh bless God I'll just move on I mean I
[1:24:37] enjoy digging 70 feet deep oh no no no
[1:24:40] no if you got
[1:24:42] any
[1:24:45] uh oh but if you've
[1:24:48] died see those are a perfect shadow
[1:24:53] of the three-fold ministry and we're
[1:24:54] going to go into that next
[1:24:55] week we'll leave it there look at here
[1:24:59] where the Prophet messes and I got two
[1:25:01] more topics and my iPad even shut down
[1:25:04] it said it's time to close whatever that
[1:25:09] means
[1:25:12] uh that people
[1:25:15] mistake from the prophet you know what
[1:25:17] I'm saying we it's like it's like well
[1:25:20] it's I'm I want I want you to get it's
[1:25:22] the devil because anytime somebody says
[1:25:26] this is God and you can't have it and I
[1:25:30] got them and you can't and it's my
[1:25:33] kingdom and I didn't even dig the
[1:25:37] well huh
[1:25:40] h
[1:25:42] Huh here the prophet said he said now
[1:25:44] you know you ladies today you ladies
[1:25:46] that wear hats he said and you say
[1:25:48] that's your covering he said that's
[1:25:51] wrong
[1:25:53] Now ladies today don't say that I mean
[1:25:56] not in our church amen but he said
[1:26:00] lady's hair is recovering now that's
[1:26:03] Bible That's Bible but watch how people
[1:26:06] take that now there's a country I've had
[1:26:08] ministers tell me if you sisters showed
[1:26:10] up now I grew up in a church where 98%
[1:26:14] of the women wore a hat and I tell you
[1:26:16] what you want to be decked out you want
[1:26:18] to see the fanciest pictures of me and
[1:26:19] thew when we go to a coup's party woohoo
[1:26:22] it's when she puts on a $100 hat
[1:26:25] amen now that's
[1:26:28] class okay but there's message churches
[1:26:31] that if a sister showed up with hair
[1:26:34] dragging on the ground and she had a hat
[1:26:37] on her head they wouldn't let her in the
[1:26:43] church I I I I I've got that straight
[1:26:46] from Pastor to
[1:26:47] Pastor okay because they said oh bless
[1:26:51] God the prophet said the you can't wear
[1:26:53] a hat no no no no no no no no he said
[1:26:56] you can't make the Hat you're covering
[1:26:58] she's never cut her hair she can wear a
[1:27:02] hat to look
[1:27:03] party
[1:27:08] hello that's not compromise but that's
[1:27:11] the type of things that starts other
[1:27:13] caps so if I mean I would struggle with
[1:27:16] that that same area if you're in a
[1:27:20] position and the church
[1:27:23] you must by Church order and law wear a
[1:27:27] tie or you get
[1:27:30] demoted a lot of us would be demoted in
[1:27:32] our
[1:27:33] church but
[1:27:37] like that's in St Luke
[1:27:42] 45 it's version number uh it's like
[1:27:46] there's a lot of new virgins in the
[1:27:48] Bible it's uh it's like the cwe or
[1:27:51] something
[1:27:54] you know we have enough things to
[1:27:56] follow in the Bible that are are
[1:27:59] salvation issues salvation issues there
[1:28:02] you go hallel we have enough things to
[1:28:05] follow and Obey for the baptism of the
[1:28:07] Holy Ghost we don't need men's laws and
[1:28:11] digas a lot of the Bible's types and
[1:28:14] sadles amen it's like just like the
[1:28:17] Lord's Supper the Bible says yes Jesus
[1:28:22] did it in the supper time I don't care
[1:28:25] if you disagree with me it it don't make
[1:28:28] no difference the Bible says this do in
[1:28:33] remembrance it's a ceremony of
[1:28:37] remembrance and if you do it at night
[1:28:39] time here it's dinner time in the
[1:28:41] Philippines so somebody's
[1:28:46] backsliding
[1:28:49] hello I mean if you want to be
[1:28:52] doctrinally right about that the only
[1:28:54] person that did communion right was the
[1:28:56] Lord
[1:28:58] Jesus cuz every other country it was a
[1:29:01] different
[1:29:03] time the Philippines is 12 hours ahead
[1:29:05] of us Africa is eight hours ahead of us
[1:29:08] so like Leo he's probably already doing
[1:29:11] might be you know what I
[1:29:12] mean hey if you want to go to that law
[1:29:15] you go right back to the Sabbath well
[1:29:17] let me see I can't start my combine on
[1:29:19] the Sabbath but it's already 5:00 in the
[1:29:22] Philippines I wonder if God would
[1:29:28] understand is this a god of a country or
[1:29:31] a god of a
[1:29:33] universe you see to
[1:29:35] mean amen I mean you can mention
[1:29:38] Christmas the prophet anything the
[1:29:40] prophet preached about Christmas and
[1:29:42] Easter it's Pagan it's 100% Pagan Google
[1:29:45] will tell you it's Pagan this Bible will
[1:29:47] tell you it's Pagan and brother Dale
[1:29:49] don't grow a Christmas tree Jeremiah
[1:29:52] says don't be like the heathens take an
[1:29:54] ax and whack a tree them
[1:29:58] but he said there he goes he's
[1:30:01] compromises but you're little kitties
[1:30:03] praise God there's none in public school
[1:30:05] n this church
[1:30:07] hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus we don't
[1:30:10] want to find out what sex they aren't
[1:30:14] amen hallelujah God give your children
[1:30:16] to teach your yourself not the
[1:30:17] government in what kind of a world did
[1:30:20] God give Holy Ghost build mother and
[1:30:22] father the children and say the
[1:30:24] government's going to teach my kids
[1:30:26] that's
[1:30:29] ridiculous the Bible says train up a
[1:30:31] child in the way he shall go and don't
[1:30:33] let trudel or Hitler teach
[1:30:36] them thus sayith the pastor if God give
[1:30:39] you the kids you teach them
[1:30:41] yourself oh God put the under them so
[1:30:45] when I send them to the devil's the
[1:30:47] prophet said that when you go in places
[1:30:48] the Holy Spirit Waits
[1:30:50] outside
[1:30:52] hello hello he said if you intentionally
[1:30:55] go to a strip bar the Holy Spirit can't
[1:30:57] go in there with you so he waits outside
[1:31:00] but you think you can send your kids
[1:31:02] there you need
[1:31:04] prayer you need a lot of
[1:31:07] prayer that was free because that wasn't
[1:31:09] on there but the pro back to the
[1:31:11] Christmas but he said your kids if they
[1:31:13] were in school praise God they're not or
[1:31:16] they hear about kids getting a present
[1:31:18] that he said they don't understand he
[1:31:20] said it's like a two Tire it's here to
[1:31:23] stay so if you have a little kid and all
[1:31:25] the other kids in town are getting a
[1:31:26] present buy him a
[1:31:28] present just tell them the true meaning
[1:31:31] Jesus was born in April or May he was a
[1:31:34] lamb and it's not this time of year
[1:31:36] they're worshiping the Sun God because
[1:31:38] they think the soulless is going to burn
[1:31:39] up and all this Greenery is because
[1:31:41] there's not going to be no more sun but
[1:31:43] here here's a new bike go ride it and

[1:31:57] profit never said bless God I'm going to
[1:31:59] change the world I'm going to get them
[1:32:02] to stop changing Christmas
[1:32:05] no no and see along that same Spirit
[1:32:09] you're not going to change everybody to
[1:32:11] your own personal Doctrine Revelation on
[1:32:14] the word of God either don't even try
[1:32:17] because it'll get you all riled up and
[1:32:19] fussy and I I don't understand
[1:32:22] what you don't see it just exactly like
[1:32:26] I
[1:32:27] do well because you're two different
[1:32:30] human beings that are at two different
[1:32:32] levels and two different things and just
[1:32:34] let you know God he's still Jehovah he
[1:32:37] can do a lot of amazing
[1:32:39] things
[1:32:41] amen oh man God help amen I want to just
[1:32:45] I want to close on this thing here
[1:32:47] matter of fact I'm going to close my
[1:32:48] iPad you know what I mean I'm just
[1:32:50] saying we have to we have to be
[1:32:53] respectful to one
[1:32:55] another respectful is there anything
[1:32:58] wrong with respect yes I
[1:33:01] believe like if there was a kid 10 years
[1:33:03] old and they're being disrespectful in
[1:33:05] the sanctuary they're going to be dealt
[1:33:08] with yes
[1:33:10] sir but if they're two months old take a
[1:33:14] pill they're two months
[1:33:17] old there's no kid under the age of
[1:33:20] seven that ever have to Disturbed me
[1:33:22] preaching God has given me a volume that
[1:33:25] I just control it up here I just turn it
[1:33:27] up amen if those kids didn't make noise
[1:33:30] and they sat still you take them to the
[1:33:32] doctor because they had epilepsy or
[1:33:35] something God made kids to way go amen
[1:33:40] you and this is free but I don't know
[1:33:42] where this go you know the disciples
[1:33:44] were bothered by
[1:33:46] children you know what Jesus told
[1:33:49] them back off
[1:33:53] and if you don't become like them Wiggly
[1:33:55] and movie you won't even be in the
[1:33:57] kingdom of
[1:33:58] heaven and you can go a lot further with
[1:34:00] that and I'm just going to throw this
[1:34:01] out there was I mentioned this Wednesday
[1:34:04] I don't know why I'm preaching two
[1:34:05] sermons in one you watch when Jeremiah
[1:34:08] went went around the walls of
[1:34:13] Jericho
[1:34:16] amen so I'm going to shock you all and I
[1:34:19] do have one I have one more quote I'd
[1:34:21] like to do after but I'm going to shock
[1:34:22] you so there's something on Church order
[1:34:24] and doctrine that I don't agree with the
[1:34:26] prophet it's all
[1:34:29] right I'm not that's not
[1:34:34] evil there church order and Doctrine the
[1:34:36] prophet said that if your kids can't be
[1:34:38] quiet in church leave them home that's
[1:34:39] on
[1:34:41] scriptural because the disciples tried
[1:34:43] to keep them from Jesus and he said back
[1:34:45] off bring them
[1:34:49] on now now listen listen this is where
[1:34:53] the prophets write if they're nine or
[1:34:56] 10 they don't need to be left at home
[1:34:58] they need the rod of
[1:35:01] Correction and they used to call it when
[1:35:03] I was a kid they used to call it the
[1:35:04] Woodshed and it's soed under the back
[1:35:06] tree and nowadays it'd have to be
[1:35:08] insulated so the government couldn't
[1:35:10] hear you and it's called give them a
[1:35:11] good old
[1:35:12] thrashing because that's
[1:35:15] disrespect but children are children and
[1:35:19] they will do what children do and that's
[1:35:21] not disrespectful and so you see when
[1:35:23] they went around the walls of Jericho
[1:35:25] the children had to be there for those
[1:35:26] walls to come
[1:35:30] down Joshua had to take the people out
[1:35:33] of the old age home and push them in the
[1:35:35] wheelchair he had to wait till the
[1:35:36] mothers changed all the baby and did all
[1:35:38] the
[1:35:39] breastfeeding well wait wait I got a
[1:35:41] diaper I got a dirty one here just hold
[1:35:42] on wait I got to be a part of this seven
[1:35:45] you don't think so read your Bible just
[1:35:48] go read your Bible and see if Joshua
[1:35:51] would have went around the walls if the
[1:35:52] walls would have come down without the
[1:35:53] old people and the young
[1:35:56] people said every
[1:35:59] soul
[1:36:01] soul that's if you're
[1:36:03] breathing amen but you see how we see we
[1:36:07] get if we get in different ages probably
[1:36:09] God help me if I don't get that way but
[1:36:11] you know we get old and crunchy well I
[1:36:12] don't understand kids no more or I'm
[1:36:14] ready you know I mean hey I remember
[1:36:16] what it's was like we had nine under we
[1:36:18] had six under nine I remember people in
[1:36:20] other churches is coming to me six kids
[1:36:22] undernight and saying hey uh your kids
[1:36:25] disturb me I said well stop breathing
[1:36:30] then I think you should sit in a
[1:36:32] different spot in
[1:36:33] church I don't want a church like that
[1:36:37] so I'm going to go to a different
[1:36:39] well that that's plain preaching but I'm
[1:36:42] sorry if that offends you but that's
[1:36:43] just factually the truth I have a Bible
[1:36:46] to back it up I'm going to a different
[1:36:48] well where there's room for all of us
[1:36:53] that's just Amen in this church there's
[1:36:55] room for kids because brother Dale won't
[1:36:58] be here forever and if God carries and I
[1:37:00] know the Rapture is overdoing it's past
[1:37:01] doing it might be my fault but if the
[1:37:04] Rapture terries it'll be the kids that
[1:37:05] carry
[1:37:06] on Amen we need to have a little bit of
[1:37:10] understanding and a little bit of love
[1:37:11] and respect and understand that we're
[1:37:13] all breathing humans like the guy that
[1:37:16] made the mistake on his cell
[1:37:19] phone I'm to close with this one
[1:37:23] thought and I'm just going to forewarn
[1:37:25] you before I close on this you're going
[1:37:26] to think that brother Dale has some kind
[1:37:29] of an agenda or
[1:37:32] something I I'm just going to clarify
[1:37:34] just for you know for the Satan's sake I
[1:37:38] don't but this was in 64 so this is
[1:37:41] after the Seal's questions and
[1:37:43] answers and you know this is for the
[1:37:45] people that love this part but they
[1:37:47] don't like this part you know and by
[1:37:49] God's grace you know I I I promised God
[1:37:52] when he called me here to this area I'll
[1:37:54] preach exactly what you give me if it's
[1:37:55] me and my wife period because because
[1:37:59] I'm going to get over there I'm going to
[1:38:00] have a clearing conscience I like to
[1:38:02] sleep when I lay my head down in that
[1:38:03] pillow there ain't going to be no phony
[1:38:07] baloney
[1:38:09] Amen brother Brown said I preached to
[1:38:12] thousands of PE tens of thousands exact
[1:38:17] quote that were completely
[1:38:20] newe
[1:38:21] [Music]
[1:38:27] this is
[1:38:29] 64 this is after the
[1:38:31] seals so his Revelation is very
[1:38:38] sharp so what would you do this
[1:38:40] morning if a lady from town walks in in
[1:38:43] a two-piece
[1:38:50] bikini
[1:38:51] she can sit any Pew in this church she
[1:38:54] wants
[1:38:54] to and the word will now now wait no
[1:38:58] this wait a minute now now if that was a
[1:39:00] backs sitting sister that had left the
[1:39:03] church and knew better or something like
[1:39:06] oh that would should be handled
[1:39:07] differently so you know you were raised
[1:39:10] in a home that's
[1:39:13] Defiance that's called iniquity to
[1:39:18] know but if somebody walks in from the
[1:39:20] world
[1:39:22] that you have never seen before except
[1:39:25] in the grocery
[1:39:29] store she's welcome in this
[1:39:33] church
[1:39:40] amen yep she might be the woman at the
[1:39:45] well that Jesus said I have an
[1:39:48] appointment and all you religious
[1:39:50] message Believers I'm going to send you
[1:39:52] up town to buy groceries like his
[1:39:54] disciples because your nose is too high
[1:39:56] in the air and you won't receive a
[1:39:58] prostitute uh oh uh oh oh ouch I don't
[1:40:03] like
[1:40:04] that
[1:40:08] ouch huh that's that's what our Prophet
[1:40:11] said said the disciples had a religious
[1:40:13] spirit on them and Jesus Jehovah sent
[1:40:16] them up town to buy physical food
[1:40:19] because he had an spiritual appointment
[1:40:21] with the prostitute that nobody would
[1:40:24] allow in her church she came to the well
[1:40:27] remember alone a different time when no
[1:40:31] other church members were at the well
[1:40:34] because she was not
[1:40:39] accepted oh you don't like that one at
[1:40:41] all I know you don't you I don't like
[1:40:43] that makes me really
[1:40:45] uncomfortable but she was a
[1:40:46] predestinated
[1:40:49] seed and you know what the Rapture is
[1:40:52] waiting for the last predestinated seed
[1:40:55] and it might be black in color of skin
[1:40:58] or it might be black in the color of
[1:41:00] sin and it very well could be in Wyoming
[1:41:03] because if you've heard the testimony it
[1:41:05] was definitely God that put this little
[1:41:06] place here
[1:41:09] Lighthouse and how will we receive
[1:41:12] her I didn't say compromise with
[1:41:16] her
[1:41:18] amen amen glory to God it's still the
[1:41:21] same
[1:41:26] message
[1:41:34] Hallelujah he said I was talking to some
[1:41:37] friends I'm going to read some of this
[1:41:38] because you just got to hear it from him
[1:41:40] because it's very clear away up in the
[1:41:43] mountains and there were some young
[1:41:46] women and I just prayed for her baby it
[1:41:49] had Upsy and the baby baby was well and
[1:41:51] the little poor family way up in the
[1:41:53] holler up there and they were black they
[1:41:55] had a black Tobacco
[1:41:57] Patch around the house and two rooms in
[1:42:00] the house there were seven or eight
[1:42:01] children and the wom folks and I said oh
[1:42:03] my just a board ax out there and she
[1:42:05] chopped her firewood and things like
[1:42:07] this hoing the garden and canning stuff
[1:42:09] and and I said I looked at that poor
[1:42:11] woman and she had the same dress on that
[1:42:13] she had two years ago and all the splits
[1:42:15] up and everything and I was trying to
[1:42:17] find some of medus me his wife dress for
[1:42:22] her to wear the next
[1:42:24] week and he said and and we were noticed
[1:42:27] standing there a couple of the brothers
[1:42:29] and I and this lady was nursing her baby
[1:42:33] and she just removed her breast and just
[1:42:35] dropped it out
[1:42:39] there
[1:42:40] and from her from her dress and began to
[1:42:44] nurse her baby and it was kind of an
[1:42:47] amazing minute for
[1:42:49] me
[1:42:54] that's the way my mama nursed
[1:42:58] me he said that's exactly
[1:43:04] right next paragraph paragraph 25
[1:43:07] remember this is in
[1:43:09] 6408 he said I have more honor for a
[1:43:13] woman like that than I have for some of
[1:43:16] these women that'll put little Ola
[1:43:18] straps under them and throw them out
[1:43:21] like that and they don't even look human
[1:43:24] I want to tell you something that was
[1:43:25] shocking I'm I please forgive me brother
[1:43:29] I God had just already talked to me
[1:43:32] ahead of time so th this is for the home
[1:43:34] you know do you know we physically had
[1:43:37] people leave this
[1:43:39] church
[1:43:41] leave and they have the message on my
[1:43:46] phone because they thought there was
[1:43:48] sisters in the
[1:43:49] church
[1:43:51] that were at their home and did not have
[1:43:54] a bra
[1:44:04] on now is that the 100% the truth 100%
[1:44:08] the truth 100% the
[1:44:12] truth and I I'm just like I'm
[1:44:18] like I'm like
[1:44:21] I'm
[1:44:26] like you see what I
[1:44:29] mean
[1:44:31] Satan that's his
[1:44:36] thing you know I was preaching in Ghana
[1:44:39] I was preaching for Pastor John and I
[1:44:41] don't know his last name and it doesn't
[1:44:43] matter but he was right close to an
[1:44:44] orphanage that that we had been to
[1:44:47] actually Vanessa stayed at the orphanage
[1:44:49] do you remember his last name Vanessa I
[1:44:50] said don't matter anyway and I was just
[1:44:53] letting her fly and I had pictures of it
[1:44:55] and right where my wife's sitting a
[1:44:57] sister just dropped her thing out and
[1:44:59] the baby was nursing and I was just
[1:45:00] flying I
[1:45:01] looked and and you have to be a minister
[1:45:04] to understand it it it didn't affect me
[1:45:06] because I was under the anointing but
[1:45:08] the next time I looked over the baby had
[1:45:12] liked my and the baby was on up till the
[1:45:15] baby was looking around and the MK was
[1:45:16] just running over and the mother just
[1:45:18] put her finger over the end of it like
[1:45:20] this and the baby's like how you doing
[1:45:21] white preacher I said I'm doing good and
[1:45:25] all of a sudden the baby just hit the
[1:45:27] mama and went back on her
[1:45:28] breast and she was in the second row in
[1:45:32] Pastor John's Church in Ghana next to
[1:45:35] the
[1:45:36] orphanage about four hours where John
[1:45:38] Dan actually came
[1:45:44] from now what would most of you do if
[1:45:47] that happened
[1:45:49] here like are they part of the
[1:45:53] Bride are they Believers see our Prophet
[1:45:56] said that there was no sexual desire in
[1:46:02] feeding the baby she was doing what she
[1:46:05] was Barn to do doing Barn to do there
[1:46:11] was no and so I I'm I'm I'm just I'm
[1:46:14] trying to prove a point how we separate
[1:46:16] over foolish things they're all foolish
[1:46:19] even if you think your doctr good it's
[1:46:21] still
[1:46:21] foolish because behold how they love one
[1:46:24] another how they can Fellowship together
[1:46:27] and it'll never be the same
[1:46:31] Doctrine but you can lay aside your
[1:46:33] Doctrine to
[1:46:35] Fellowship amen so the last time we were
[1:46:37] at Pastor Leo's and I hope nobody
[1:46:40] watches this they got night service so
[1:46:42] I'm at Pastor Leo's and there's tents on
[1:46:44] three sides of the church one tent on
[1:46:47] the back was for people to eat under but
[1:46:49] on the side right and the front of the
[1:46:51] church was all tents the church holds
[1:46:53] like 600 people and all the you know
[1:46:58] like like under the tents was full too
[1:47:00] he had physically told pastors that come
[1:47:04] do not bring your church we have no room
[1:47:07] to sit them okay that's pretty plain am
[1:47:11] me so there's a lot of people there and
[1:47:13] so I my whole key I'm just thinking
[1:47:15] there like they really raise you
[1:47:18] up like a white God
[1:47:21] and I try to bring myself down and eat
[1:47:22] with the kids and so I go around I shake
[1:47:25] all the kids hand I shake every single
[1:47:27] person you know the most oldest and the
[1:47:29] ugliest and the youngest and everybody's
[1:47:32] hand so I go out to the town I'm shaking
[1:47:34] and I was like whoa oh oh I'm sorry I'm
[1:47:37] sorry and everybody was
[1:47:41] exposed I'm
[1:47:43] like I think I'll go back in the church
[1:47:49] building
[1:47:51] but if we were here in North America say
[1:47:53] bless God we're educated we're not doing
[1:47:55] that I went to different
[1:47:58] Cemetery I wouldn't be a part of that
[1:48:00] kind of stuff you
[1:48:04] know and so we go to different camp
[1:48:06] meeting and we have a denominational
[1:48:09] spirit and we
[1:48:11] separate
[1:48:13] over
[1:48:15] over something that has never ever been
[1:48:19] told
[1:48:24] you know the denominational they have
[1:48:26] like a membership book and it's like you
[1:48:29] must not color your
[1:48:32] hair you can cut it but don't color
[1:48:35] it you know I'm just you know you you
[1:48:39] want to see how I'm sorry but
[1:48:42] I but are we beyond the book I don't
[1:48:46] mean the Bible and I don't mean the
[1:48:49] message
[1:48:52] but do we have the baptism of the Holy
[1:48:54] Ghost let me let me close with this
[1:48:57] thought you know the prophet had a
[1:48:59] sister come up and she said Prophet I
[1:49:01] don't wear slacks now I believe in
[1:49:04] Holiness and you with see God so you
[1:49:07] won't be there if you want to wear
[1:49:09] women's clothes or men's clothes I hope
[1:49:11] you enjoy hell it's no
[1:49:17] problem but my sisters my
[1:49:20] daughters do
[1:49:22] construction and that's not illegal I I
[1:49:25] never found that anywhere in the Bible
[1:49:26] where that was illegal in the Bible
[1:49:29] never seen that if you find it you can
[1:49:31] send children them in private
[1:49:35] uh and
[1:49:37] so there was people that struggled with
[1:49:41] them wearing pants with a dress over
[1:49:44] it now like if it gets to minus 20 and
[1:49:47] you go on a genie boom like jar Genie
[1:49:50] boom we need to fix the bell at the
[1:49:52] thing praise God I got a whole bunch of
[1:49:54] kids do construction but I got to wait
[1:49:55] for the Bell fix uh it goes I think 65t
[1:49:58] in the air now you would be a little
[1:50:00] exposed if you only had a dress and your
[1:50:01] underwear
[1:50:02] on so you wear pants it's minus 25 and a
[1:50:07] dress over it completely to the knee you
[1:50:11] know what the prophet said you want to
[1:50:12] know what your Prophet said he said you
[1:50:14] you want to know what modesty is read
[1:50:16] the Old Testament where the Levites and
[1:50:18] the priests they covered their thigh
[1:50:21] and the prophet goes right along with
[1:50:22] the Bible and he says if your knee is
[1:50:24] exposed you Mar your testimony that's
[1:50:27] good for men and
[1:50:29] women if you show your knee you Mar your
[1:50:34] testimony okay so if your knee is
[1:50:37] covered and you're a man you're not
[1:50:38] wearing shorts because your knee's
[1:50:39] covered that's th sayith the prophet if
[1:50:42] you have trouble with that the him when
[1:50:43] you get to heaven you know or wherever
[1:50:46] you get but uh so there was also people
[1:50:52] that rebuked me for my girls wearing
[1:50:56] pants under their dress and they sent me
[1:50:58] the quote on my nice little phone here
[1:51:00] my nice pretty like wonderful phone it's
[1:51:02] amazing how people send you nice little
[1:51:04] messages and they highlighted the part
[1:51:06] where the Prophet said that it was
[1:51:09] illegal for a girl to wear
[1:51:14] overhauls but he didn't say nothing
[1:51:16] about putting a dress over the overhauls
[1:51:18] do you know what a jumper skirt is
[1:51:22] it's an overhaul with the skirt
[1:51:26] bottom and the prophet talked about a
[1:51:28] tuxedo on the bib overhauls and a jumper
[1:51:31] skirt that with the skirt bottom had
[1:51:35] pants on it now you want to watch how
[1:51:37] foolish people are and I promise I'm
[1:51:38] closing on this one close there was
[1:51:41] people in
[1:51:43] Africa so this sister came to brother
[1:51:45] Brown and he said brother Brown I don't
[1:51:47] wear
[1:51:48] slacks I wear
[1:51:50] shorts and brother Brown said well
[1:51:52] that's worse than wearing pants you're
[1:51:55] supposed to wear a dress and so the
[1:51:57] people in Africa took it see now the
[1:51:59] prophet also took that a guy that was a
[1:52:01] wore Grandma's underwear because
[1:52:03] Grandma's underwear used to be like you
[1:52:05] know about this now Grandma's underwear
[1:52:07] didn't go below the knee because but it
[1:52:09] was like long underwear so they took it
[1:52:12] that it was worse to
[1:52:13] wear
[1:52:15] shorts than it was to wear slacks so
[1:52:19] they passed the lawn their church I'm
[1:52:20] not making this up you're going to think
[1:52:22] I'm making this up I want to show you
[1:52:24] how ridiculous we separate over that the
[1:52:26] sisters couldn't wear
[1:52:31] underwear because it was pants under
[1:52:33] their dress until so they were wearing a
[1:52:34] man's garment and it was worse than
[1:52:39] slacks and if you would like to meet
[1:52:41] some of those people or have their name
[1:52:43] I can give it to you because I've been
[1:52:45] to Africa three
[1:52:46] times so you send a fat white person
[1:52:49] over there and I said are preaching I'm
[1:52:50] just preaching the word of God and they
[1:52:53] they got her like
[1:52:55] flies I'm like what did I
[1:53:01] say what did you say you interrupted
[1:53:05] their own private Doctrine and their own
[1:53:09] kingdom and so they
[1:53:12] left you see you see now that is the
[1:53:17] truth and I did not make that up and I
[1:53:20] have names and numbers I can give you
[1:53:23] but you see how far people will be
[1:53:26] foolish So In This Very church this very
[1:53:30] Church we've had people
[1:53:34] leave I
[1:53:36] like because they didn't think some
[1:53:39] people wore a
[1:53:41] bra how they knew
[1:53:46] that uh you know I but did you you but
[1:53:50] this isn't a
[1:53:52] message they're actually going to
[1:53:54] another message Church in
[1:53:59] Ontario okay hello so if you go to
[1:54:02] Convention to camp meeting you're
[1:54:03] probably going to sit beside that
[1:54:07] person and I've also had people tell me
[1:54:11] that if my girls wore a dress over any
[1:54:14] outer uniform they were wearing mans of
[1:54:17] perel and that was a sin so they
[1:54:19] couldn't wear underwear they couldn't
[1:54:20] wear long legging socks they couldn't

[2:00:32] 8 God promises to break the Yoke of

[2:00:39] his enemies had attacked him amen and I
[2:00:42] don't know if you know just
[2:00:45] recently the you know people and and we
[2:00:50] have it we need to learn to be careful
[2:00:54] what we
[2:00:58] speak God won't be
[2:01:02] mocked God won't be mocked that's good
[2:01:05] advice for brother Dale
[2:01:08] also any of you that seen online the
[2:01:11] Turkish
[2:01:12] leader started to mock
[2:01:15] Israel and tell the UN that Israel would
[2:01:20] pay from
[2:01:22] Allah for what they're doing and he fell
[2:01:26] immediately out of that
[2:01:28] apum and they buried him two days later
[2:01:31] he was pronounced dead let me read for
[2:01:34] it two days later and you think that you
[2:01:37] can go around and preach your mouth
[2:01:41] against the bride and wife of
[2:01:44] Christ you're walking Where Angels With
[2:01:46] Fear To
[2:01:47] Tread On hot
[2:01:50] cools because God's still God and just
[2:01:54] like he opened up the Earth and
[2:01:55] swallowed up Nathan and car for
[2:01:57] blaspheming God's chosen
[2:02:00] one he just did it again in Israel you
[2:02:03] want to see God alive and well today go
[2:02:06] to the UN you don't even have to go to a
[2:02:09] message
[2:02:10] church you can go to the
[2:02:12] UN because God's in both of
[2:02:15] them and he won't be mocked

[2:02:39] her for her
[2:02:42] life man I'm just trying to say that
[2:02:46] sometimes God does things
[2:02:50] that we will not understand on this
[2:02:52] side we will not understand most people
[2:02:54] didn't understand why he would call
[2:02:56] Brother Brenham with no education and
[2:02:59] couldn't speak
[2:03:00] good and they laughed him to scorn when
[2:03:04] he gave them their testimony of the
