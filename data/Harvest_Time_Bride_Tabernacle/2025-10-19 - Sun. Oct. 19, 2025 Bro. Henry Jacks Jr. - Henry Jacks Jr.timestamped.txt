[6:58] amen
[7:05] praise his
[7:23] Good morning and God bless you all.
[7:26] Today is a really special day for me. Um
[7:29] 11 years ago I was baptized
[7:32] and today I really wanted to share that
[7:36] testimony and give God the glory but
[7:39] also to share a testimony that happened
[7:41] a couple weeks ago
[7:43] just to share how good God is and how
[7:46] perfect his plans are. So, two weeks ago
[7:50] after church, um we were going to pick
[7:54] up a few dump trucks for our boys and
[7:57] around 3 p.m. our neighbor was going to
[7:58] take our boys on a combine ride.
[8:01] And Jeff said, "You know, after we pick
[8:03] up those dump trucks, I really want to
[8:05] drop by in forest because there's a
[8:08] Canadian tire there and I need to return
[8:10] something and I want you to see the food
[8:11] land there because you've never been."
[8:14] And so we went to the lady's house and
[8:16] we ended up chatting with her for a
[8:18] while. So she um she separated from her
[8:21] husband and sold her house and she said,
[8:23] "You know what? I have a lot more I'm
[8:25] giving away because we're moving into
[8:27] the city." So she ended up blessing our
[8:29] boys with just some other outdoor toys.
[8:32] And she even gave me like a chicken
[8:33] feeder. So it was a blessing, but we
[8:36] took extra time. So when we looked at
[8:39] the time in the vehicle, we thought,
[8:41] "Okay, we should probably just head
[8:42] home." our neighbor will be waiting for
[8:44] the boys.
[8:46] And when we got home, I messaged our
[8:48] neighbor, but he never replied. So Jeff
[8:50] said, "Maybe he's, you know, he's busy,
[8:52] so let's just go to Forest and then come
[8:53] back." So this is just a testimony of
[8:55] God's time.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; When we went into uh town in Forest
[9:01] there, um I went into the food land by
[9:03] myself with Kazaya and Jeff said,
[9:06] "Remember, I'm in the vehicle with the
[9:07] boys basically like be quick and you
[9:10] know, we got to get going." He just
[9:12] wanted a bit of ice cream. So, as I went
[9:14] in the store and I'm just looking, you
[9:16] know, looking at the food land I've
[9:18] never been in before and I was like, I
[9:20] should probably just grab maybe a couple
[9:21] cans of tuna, a couple cans of tuna. So,
[9:24] I went down the tuna aisle and there was
[9:26] no one there. And all of a sudden, this
[9:28] gentleman comes by and he looks at
[9:31] Kazaya and he's like, "Wow, she's so
[9:33] beautiful." He's like, "I've always
[9:35] wanted to have a daughter. I have two
[9:37] young boys, but I've always heard about
[9:39] what happens when they're teenagers and
[9:41] whatnot. And and he's like, "You don't
[9:43] seem like you gave your parents
[9:45] trouble." He said to me. Um and anyway,
[9:49] shortly after I just shared about how we
[9:52] just moved to the area from Cambridge
[9:54] and we've been through some trials, but
[9:56] I said, "You know what? God's in
[9:57] control." And he goes,
[10:00] "You know what? I'd like to think I have
[10:02] faith." He's like, "I I lost my dad a
[10:05] week ago." He's like, "I'd like to think
[10:07] that he's up there and that I'll see him
[10:10] someday."
[10:12] But he didn't seem very sure.
[10:15] And so after that, you know, he saw the
[10:19] faith that I had and I ended up sharing
[10:21] my testimony a bit about how I was a
[10:22] Muslim and I came to know Christ. And he
[10:25] goes, "But aren't Muslims decent people?
[10:28] Don't they have a decent faith?"
[10:31] He goes, "A Muslim doctor actually
[10:34] helped my father to swallow again after
[10:38] he went through some trauma." And that
[10:41] doctor's name was Muhammad Muhammad.
[10:44] And you know, I said to him, you know
[10:47] what? I had the same question when I
[10:49] came to the faith of of Jesus. When I
[10:52] came to know Jesus, I had a question of
[10:54] is Allah Jesus but in a different name.
[10:58] So, I remember walking into a bookstore
[11:00] shortly after I got saved and there was
[11:01] a Christian owner and he said, "I need
[11:04] to show you something and I need you to
[11:06] come into this room." So, he opened the
[11:09] Quran, the Muslim
[11:12] book of faith, and he opened the Bible
[11:15] and he showed me two similar scriptures,
[11:19] similar but not quite the same. And he
[11:22] said, "Look, in the Quran, Allah had no
[11:25] begotten son." And he said, 'When you
[11:28] see here in the Bible, our God had a
[11:30] begotten son and that was Jesus Christ.
[11:33] And that there just answered my
[11:37] question. And I and I shared that with
[11:38] this gentleman and he goes, "Look,
[11:42] um and I told him about my parents and
[11:45] how
[11:47] they still accept us in their life."
[11:50] He goes,
[11:52] "I hope your mom lives a hundred years."
[11:55] But he goes, "When she passes, do you
[11:58] believe that she'll be up there with
[12:00] you?" And I said, "You know, my mom has
[12:05] done a lot of good for our family. So
[12:08] much more than I could put into words."
[12:10] And I so I I I believe on judgment day
[12:12] I'll be be able to speak for her. And I
[12:15] said, 'I'm still praying for her soul
[12:17] and her salvation though today uh on
[12:20] earth.
[12:22] And so he was just so moved by all of
[12:24] this. And a lady came up that was
[12:26] working at Foodland and just gave him a
[12:28] big hug. And he's like, "Thank you." I
[12:31] just actually went on a drive to clear
[12:33] my head.
[12:35] So God just had this perfect time of me
[12:37] being there to testify to this man. And
[12:40] later on when I was sharing this
[12:41] testimony with sister Julie and sister
[12:43] Lanne, I mentioned the name of that
[12:45] doctor and they go, "That was the same
[12:47] doctor that helped Steve to swallow the
[12:51] brother Steve that passed away a couple
[12:53] weeks ago." And sure enough, this was
[12:55] his son that I met in Foodland and had
[12:58] no idea that it was him because I've
[13:00] never met Steve. I've met never met his
[13:02] family. And here's his son. And like
[13:06] Pastor Dale has testified to his dad
[13:08] when he was sick and visited him when he
[13:11] was ill. And
[13:13] you know, I had no idea it was his son
[13:15] and there I am just openly
[13:18] testifying of my faith. So it was just
[13:20] so beautiful. And to hear the connection
[13:23] later on just made it even more
[13:25] beautiful.
[13:27] And here I am today to share my
[13:29] testimony of how God saved me. And a lot
[13:33] of people ask me, they're like, "How do
[13:35] you come from the Muslim faith to
[13:37] Christianity?" Like, "How do you just
[13:39] make that choice?" But it wasn't a
[13:41] choice of mine. You know, God chose me.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; And God showed me who I was. And he
[13:48] showed me that he was the truth. And
[13:51] that's how I was saved. I just knew that
[13:53] I knew. It's not wasn't a choice of
[13:55] mine. And I just knew he was the truth
[13:57] when he showed himself to me. So, I
[13:59] praise God for that. I really love the
[14:03] Lord and I I wrote my testimony in a
[14:06] poem. So I'd like to share that poem
[14:08] with you. Um I have shared this poem
[14:10] when we went to uh when we lived in
[14:12] Cambridge and we went to Pastor Jose's
[14:15] church. Um but I would love to share it
[14:17] today just in honor and glory of him.
[14:20] And um I pray it blesses you.
[14:25] You founded the world and knew me even
[14:28] before. You had a criate Muslim couple
[14:31] married in 1984.
[14:33] Fate sealed by a picture that fell on
[14:36] the floor. On April 5th, 1986, a baby
[14:40] girl, it was me that she bore. I find it
[14:43] so amazing that you always covered me.
[14:46] Before you even formed me in the belly,
[14:48] you knew me. And throughout my sickness
[14:51] when I was four, you healed and
[14:53] protected me through heaven's door.
[14:56] When I was a young girl, I prayed to a
[14:58] God that wasn't real. As I spoke, it was
[15:01] emptiness I would feel as the words left
[15:04] my mouth and in the dark they would
[15:06] fall. I wondered if I might as well be
[15:09] speaking to a wall. I would sing when
[15:12] the saints go marching in on a keyboard
[15:15] playing. I would have been the meaning I
[15:18] didn't quite yet know, but who I am in
[15:21] Christ, you would soon decide to show.
[15:24] Fast forward to my 22. You had my other
[15:27] half chosen for me to say I do. To meet
[15:30] me, he deviated from his walk with you.
[15:34] I smile when I think that all of this
[15:36] you already knew. We married before I
[15:39] knew you, but you knew my name. If we
[15:42] married in a church, my parents wouldn't
[15:44] have came. Little did we know then that
[15:47] you would mend a broken road through a
[15:49] vision that you would send. You showed
[15:52] me a vision of a man with a hat standing
[15:55] in between some pews. I said, "Jeff, I
[15:58] had a vision of this place, a church and
[16:00] a man, but I couldn't see his face." He
[16:03] said, "Maybe let's find a church then
[16:05] with God-fearing women and men." First
[16:08] to Alabama we would go, as my
[16:11] grandmother's memory is beginning to
[16:13] slow.
[16:14] To Alabama with our shepherd we went.
[16:17] Jesus decided it was us he sent to
[16:20] change our lives forever so that we
[16:23] would begin to honor and serve him
[16:24] together.
[16:26] On Saturday we arrived in the state as
[16:29] God had already prepared our beautiful
[16:31] fate. Uncle and Auntie McGregor was the
[16:34] name. They said we had turned we attend
[16:36] church on Sunday and we'd be happy if
[16:38] you came. With excitement in my eyes, I
[16:41] told Jeff my hope. His jaw nearly hit
[16:43] the floor as he could barely cope. Do
[16:46] you really want to go to church
[16:47] tomorrow? We might miss the flea market
[16:50] and there's no time. There's no more
[16:51] time we can borrow.
[16:54] Off to New Hope Revival we did go.
[16:57] During worship service, what to do? I
[16:59] did not know. I said, "God, please have
[17:02] your way." And a few songs in my
[17:04] discomfort he took away. How great thou
[17:07] art. How do I know this song and this
[17:10] part? I remember now I was asked to sing
[17:13] it from a book when my friend's
[17:16] grandmother's life God had took. Oh, I
[17:19] started to sing and I couldn't stop.
[17:21] Jesus, a hold of my heart he sure got
[17:24] from there. The many questions that
[17:26] occurred, God answered through Pastor
[17:28] Shel's words. I had never owned or held
[17:31] a Bible before.
[17:33] In a journal, I wrote everything down
[17:35] and wanted to know more. Soon, I would
[17:37] tell my mom the news, but she would not
[17:39] applaud. I would be giving my life to
[17:42] Jesus, the one and only true God. Just
[17:45] over a month after I was baptized in
[17:47] your name, all that mattered was you,
[17:49] not wealth or fame. It's amazing that
[17:52] you truly knew my name. After I was
[17:54] baptized, even the colors of the earth
[17:56] were not the same. As we think of your
[17:59] sacrifice
[18:01] on this 11th anniversary day, it
[18:03] overwhelms my heart to think of the
[18:05] price you had to pay for my burdens and
[18:08] sins. You died for tortured, mocked, and
[18:11] your clothes tore. Thank you, Jesus, for
[18:14] bearing the weight. We await your
[18:16] return, but do not know the date. We
[18:19] will serve you by serving those in need,
[18:21] shining your light and your love in
[18:23] every deed. Our God, we thank you for
[18:25] your love and grace. For you and your
[18:28] perfect will, we will gladly run this
[18:30] race. One day, when it's time, we pray,
[18:33] we will hear, "Well done, thou good and
[18:36] faithful servant in our ear. Until that
[18:39] day, let thy precious will be done.
[18:41] These battles we are facing, you have
[18:43] already overcome.
[18:45] Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, our
[18:47] King, we will forever praise you and
[18:50] give you thanks in everything.
[18:53] Um before I go, I I um I have a couple
[18:57] of pictures I wanted to share of my
[18:58] baptism.
[19:00] Um the first picture actually I'll talk
[19:03] about here.
[19:04] This is how beautiful God is. Jeff's
[19:07] dad, brother Lauren, was in one of
[19:09] brother Brandham's services when he was
[19:11] two, and he remembers it actually very
[19:13] vividly. And Jeff's family ended up
[19:17] becoming really good friends with
[19:18] brother Perry Green. And many of you may
[19:21] know him, but his ministry was was
[19:23] sharing the miracles that God did
[19:26] through Brother Brham.
[19:28] And like God picked my husband who
[19:32] already, you know, had this beautiful
[19:34] foundation in this truth in the message.
[19:37] And they were friends with brother Green
[19:39] who was friends with brother Brandham
[19:41] and saw his the miracles that God did
[19:44] firsthand through him. And I just love
[19:46] it. I love that God is just beautiful in
[19:50] everything he does. So I wanted to share
[19:52] this picture. So that's brother green um
[19:55] with the with the glasses there on the
[19:57] on the left and um his arm is around
[20:01] brother Josh. So that's Jeff's second
[20:03] youngest brother. Um
[20:06] Joseph is around his left arm. Joseph is
[20:10] Jeff's youngest brother there. Jeff is
[20:13] behind um Joseph wearing the royal blue
[20:17] dress shirt there. Uh, brother Lauren
[20:19] has the royal blue tie. And, uh, behind
[20:24] brother Lauren is brother Justin. So,
[20:26] that's Jeff's second oldest brother. Uh,
[20:28] there's brother Green's wife beside
[20:30] sister Sheila. And brother John, Jeff's
[20:32] oldest brother, is with the dark
[20:35] sunglasses there. So, and then I have a
[20:37] couple of pictures of when I was
[20:39] baptized. So, I came to know the Lord
[20:41] October, sorry, September 14th, 2014.
[20:46] and I I knew I knew it was the truth and
[20:50] I was going to be baptized. So, I
[20:52] actually ended up being baptized on
[20:53] October 19th, 2014.
[20:56] October 19th is actually also my
[20:58] father's birthday. And I didn't at the
[21:01] time I was I didn't even think the dates
[21:03] were the same, but because I was just so
[21:05] excited to be baptized and come to know
[21:08] the Lord. But this is the day I was
[21:10] baptized. I was actually the first
[21:12] person to be baptized um in Pastor John
[21:14] Denqua's new church and it was just one
[21:19] of the best days of my life and I wanted
[21:22] to share that with you today and give
[21:23] God all the glory.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:29] [Applause]
[21:41] his his goodness and mercy and you know
[21:44] testify of his his uh his leading. Amen.
[21:48] It's just uh it's just wonderful.
[21:51] Praise his name.
[21:54] And let's sing uh river. There's a river
[21:56] of life flowing out for me. Amen.
[22:03] There's a river of life flowing out from
[22:08] me. It makes the lame to walk and the

[29:03] &gt;&gt; You know the other day I was crying when
[29:06] I read the news and see so many children
[29:08] have gone missing.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; I have a son. You know I'm a parent
[29:13] &gt;&gt; and I love children. But you know the
[29:17] this world is evil.

[29:20] &gt;&gt; But I thank God that we have a God.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; And you know and God is working
[29:27] &gt;&gt; and God is working.

[29:44] that are lurking.

[32:49] leading of the Holy Spirit.
[32:53] Hallelujah.

[33:02] what must I say to the people

[33:48] &gt;&gt; but we're going to go into it.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:52] 1 John chapter 5.
[33:56] We're going to read a few verses and
[33:58] then we're going to turn over to St.
[33:59] John chapter 4. The Bible said in 1 John
[34:02] chapter 5, we're going to read from
[34:04] verse 4.
[34:07] For whatsoever,
[34:10] and that whatsoever can also mean
[34:11] whosoever,
[34:13] &gt;&gt; for whatsoever is born of God,
[34:17] hallelujah,

[34:37] You can turn your Bibles to the book of
[34:39] St. John chapter 4 and then we're going
[34:43] to read a verse here
[34:45] and then you can be seated. St. John
[34:48] chap St. John chapter 4 verse 23 when
[34:54] Jesus was speaking to the woman at the
[34:56] well.
[34:59] Hallelujah.
[35:02] He said, "But the hour cometh,
[35:05] and now is when the true worshippers
[35:10] shall worship the father
[35:12] &gt;&gt; in spirit and in truth."
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Hallelujah. The hour
[35:19] cometh.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; And now his
[35:22] &gt;&gt; glory to God.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; That the true worshipper. So the father
[35:25] is seeking the true worshippers.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. in spirit and in truth.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; For the father seeketh such to worship
[35:35] him.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Verse 24, God is a spirit, and they that
[35:43] worship him must worship him in spirit
[35:46] and in truth.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; You can be seated as we ask the Lord to
[35:50] have his blessing to his word.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What an interesting day that
[35:56] we're living in.
[35:58] What an interesting time we're living
[36:00] in.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; What an interesting season we're living
[36:03] in.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Saints of God.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We see so many things that
[36:10] is happening.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Our faith is being attacked day after
[36:14] day.
[36:16] And sometimes the devil will come in
[36:20] certain form for you to question your
[36:22] faith
[36:25] &gt;&gt; and even doubt in who you are.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; But I thank God
[36:32] that we have a word today.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We have a word today. Amen.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; And the thought
[36:43] your victory is manifest through your
[36:48] worship.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; We're when we talk about the world,
[36:55] we're talking about the things of the
[36:58] world.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; We're talking about so many things are
[37:02] happening in the world today.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; But in St. John chapter 17, Jesus said,
[37:10] "I pray, Father, that you do not take
[37:14] them out of the world, but I pray that
[37:18] you may keep them from the evil of the
[37:20] world."
[37:22] &gt;&gt; There is a promise over your life.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; This world is filled with darkness.
[37:30] And even though it is filled with
[37:32] darkness, there is light.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said in Egypt, the whole
[37:40] lot of Egypt was in darkness, but there
[37:43] was light in
[37:44] &gt;&gt; go.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Thank God that we have a light today.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Thank God. Hallelujah. That God has
[37:56] leave this hurt without a witness.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Thank God. Hallelujah. that he has that
[38:05] he has sent his angels to be with his
[38:08] people
[38:10] &gt;&gt; in spite of everything that is
[38:13] happening.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; And saints of God, how can we have a
[38:20] victory if we don't have a battles?
[38:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; The battles has to come for you to get
[38:27] the victory.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. In order for
[38:32] you to have a testimony, you got to have
[38:35] an experience first.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got to be tested.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; It's Hallelujah. It's in the will of God
[38:45] for you to be tested.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; It's in the will of God for you to fight
[38:51] some battles.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:55] Glory to God.
[38:57] And many times, oh glory, we look at our
[39:02] circumstances
[39:04] and we think that our victory lies in
[39:08] our strength.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; But our victory does not lies in our
[39:13] strength
[39:14] &gt;&gt; or in the amount of knowledge that you
[39:17] contain in your head.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:22] You can you can know the entire Bible.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; You can know the 1,200 odd messages from
[39:31] the prophet.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; But that doesn't guarantee you victory.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; You can quote the entire Bible from
[39:43] Genesis to Revelation,
[39:45] &gt;&gt; but that doesn't guarantee you victory.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[39:53] You may be gifted with more than one
[39:57] gift of the spirit.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; The Bible talks about the gifts of the
[40:02] spirit in 1 Corinthians 12 from verse 4
[40:05] come down to verse 9.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; And according to the Bible, persons can
[40:12] be given more than one gift.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; So you can be gifted, but that doesn't
[40:18] guarantee you victory. Amen.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:23] Praise God.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; And many times
[40:28] we place so much emphasis, Hallelujah.
[40:32] And gifts and gifts and gifts.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; And more than understanding of the word,
[40:40] &gt;&gt; glory to God. We must understand the
[40:44] word. By understanding the word, it will
[40:48] help you to place those gifts in the
[40:51] correct order.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; The prophecy, the gifts must be in the
[40:59] church.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; But it takes understanding
[41:06] &gt;&gt; and we must come back to the
[41:08] understanding of the word.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:12] Jesus said, "Here is a parable of the
[41:16] good swer,
[41:17] &gt;&gt; he that sweth the seed, and he that
[41:21] understand it."
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Paul said, "He that lacketh
[41:28] wisdom, let him ask of God." Amen.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; According to the Bible, he said Gabriel
[41:36] who was sent from God to Daniel. Daniel
[41:40] was studying the books.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When the children of Israel
[41:46] was there in Babylon,
[41:49] &gt;&gt; and when the time of deliverance was
[41:52] getting closer,
[41:55] hallelujah,
[41:57] &gt;&gt; it was getting closer.
[42:00] But Daniel, something touched Daniel. He
[42:04] went back to the Bible. He went back to
[42:07] the book and started to pro I start to
[42:10] study the writings of Jeremiah.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:17] And when they start to study,
[42:19] Hallelujah.
[42:21] Glory to God. You realize that in the
[42:24] time of departure was getting closer.
[42:28] The prophet under the anointing of God,
[42:31] he said the time that Daniel was
[42:33] studying was the 60th year. Hallelujah.
[42:37] 2 years before the 70 years be
[42:40] accomplished at Babylon.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[42:46] And the Bible said Daniel, he set his
[42:51] face and seek God.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God sent the angel
[42:59] Gabriel to come to Daniel to give him
[43:02] skill and understanding.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:09] When you understand
[43:11] God requires worship.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because worship is a
[43:18] package.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a package.
[43:23] The attribute of worship is respect.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; It is obedience.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is holiness.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; It is submission.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. When you understand all of
[43:39] that, it's a package.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; And God said, hallelujah. In the book of
[43:45] St. John chapter 4 he said now is when
[43:50] you shall worship the father in spirit
[43:54] and in truth.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[43:59] When we talk about the doctrines the
[44:02] doctrine of the nicicoatans.
[44:06] Hallelujah.
[44:07] What are the what is the doctrine of it?
[44:10] When they take out the spirit.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. And when they take out the
[44:14] truth, it becomes the doctrine of the
[44:16] nic nicatians.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; But when the the spirit of God is in it
[44:23] and when the truth of God is in it, it's
[44:25] not a doctrine of Nicicoatians. It is a
[44:28] doctrine of the son of man.
[44:31] [Music]
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. So here Jesus said to the
[44:39] woman at the well
[44:42] you said you worship hallelujah on the
[44:45] mountain.
[44:47] And the Jews the woman was telling Jesus
[44:51] and the Jews said Jerusalem is a place
[44:54] where men ought to worship.
[44:58] Jesus said it is coming and now is. It
[45:02] is no longer in Jerusalem.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's no longer a geographically
[45:08] location.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; It becomes a dimension now.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; It's not a geographically location but a
[45:20] dimension.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:25] And Jesus said in spirit.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Oh praise God.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; What is the spirit?
[45:34] The spirit is the Holy Ghost.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; And it comes to vindicate his presence.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[45:47] There is seven compound name of Jehovah.
[45:52] And the Bible said, hallelujah, in in
[45:56] the book of Genesis chapter 22,
[46:01] hallelujah, when you know God, when you
[46:05] understand God, it requires worship.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; And when it requires worship,
[46:12] hallelujah, it brings you victory.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You hear that, somebody?
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:21] When God is revealed to you,
[46:23] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, when God is made known to
[46:26] you, hallelujah,
[46:28] &gt;&gt; you're it attracts you to worship.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you worship God, no
[46:35] matter the circumstances like Abraham,
[46:38] what the circumstances that Abraham was
[46:41] facing, he didn't have a sacrifice.
[46:45] All he had was his son Isaac.
[46:49] to God.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Isaac who was a very knowledgeable boy,
[46:55] he was looking and he said, "Father, I
[46:57] have seen the hood. I have seen the
[47:00] knife,
[47:01] &gt;&gt; but where is the sacrifice?
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Where is the sacrifice?"
[47:11] But before before we come to that verse,
[47:14] Abraham said said to his servants, you
[47:18] guys stay here. Me and the lad is going
[47:22] to go up and worship.
[47:24] [Applause]
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "We're going to go up and
[47:31] worship and then come back again."
[47:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, am I preaching this morning? Amen.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Worship. Now
[47:45] it it requires humility.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Humility.
[47:53] It is a fundamentally a part of humbling
[47:56] ourself before an awesome God.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; It we bow down because there's no
[48:05] greater or more powerful being and is
[48:09] worthy of our complete complete
[48:13] surrender.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. Abraham come on the complete
[48:19] surrender. When God said take now thine
[48:23] only son whom you love. Amen.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; You're talking about for 25 years.
[48:30] Abraham was waiting on this promise.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When he was 75, God said, "I
[48:40] will give my son."
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Sarah was about 65 years old at the
[48:46] time.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; And when he was 99, God said, "Now I'm
[48:51] ready.
[48:53] Amen.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Now I'm ready to fulfill my promise.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Now I'm ready. But God through all that
[49:02] God was revealing revealing himself to
[49:06] Abraham.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; God keep revealing himself. That's why
[49:12] Abraham know the importance of worship.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. I tell you saints when you
[49:21] worship God even though Hallelujah the
[49:25] circumstances showing you death but
[49:27] there's victory.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet said? Abraham
[49:33] believed God so much. Hallelujah.
[49:37] Abraham believed God so much that even
[49:39] if Isaac was dead, God was able to
[49:42] resurrect him.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:45] Amen.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; He said God was able to resurrect him
[49:53] &gt;&gt; because it was God that gave him the
[49:55] promise. I said, "Out of thine seed."
[49:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; He said, "Out of thine seed, all nation
[50:03] shall be blessed."
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; God. Hallelujah. Have you been to a
[50:11] situation that Hallelujah? God said
[50:14] through your mouth I will use you.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you feel like that.
[50:20] Hallelujah. You reach to a stage that
[50:23] you feel like that you can't even open
[50:25] your mouth.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:32] But Abraham must completely surrender to
[50:35] him.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. But it must begins with
[50:44] humility.
[50:47] Hallelujah. Submission.
[50:51] Worship is about submission of
[50:53] ourselves.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; To the purpose,
[50:58] &gt;&gt; to the purpose of God.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. When you recognize his
[51:06] purpose,
[51:08] God said, "And we know through the mouth
[51:13] of brother Paul."
[51:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "For we know that all things
[51:18] work to good."
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Look at it. He said, "We know."
[51:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "We know."
[51:25] &gt;&gt; How do we know? It has to be revealed to
[51:28] you.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "And we know that
[51:35] all things work for good."
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; You can be at a place whereby you feel
[51:46] like that your whole world is turning
[51:49] upside down.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Everything is falling apart.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; But then all God require is your
[51:58] worship.
[52:01] All God require is your worship.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Because through your worship will brings
[52:07] victory.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we know
[52:14] I love how brother Paulie put that. I'm
[52:17] a part of that. We
[52:19] &gt;&gt; you must able to place yourself in the
[52:23] word.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Three things.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Place yourself in the word.
[52:30] at what time
[52:32] &gt;&gt; and what season.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; Because all things Hallelujah is
[52:42] according to time and season.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; When the situ when the situation feel
[52:49] like it's turning upside down, I know
[52:52] that it work for my good.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Because God glory has to be revealed.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Listen
[53:11] two things.
[53:13] Because you love the Lord.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:17] You know that I tell you that
[53:21] the last time I mentioned that the love
[53:25] of God cannot be reason with. It has
[53:30] nothing to do with reason.
[53:33] Once there's reason, there's
[53:35] expectation.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; Do you know that you are created to
[53:42] love? That's right.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Do you know that you were ordained from
[53:47] before the foundation of the world to
[53:50] walk before him in love?
[53:54] &gt;&gt; The book of Ephesians teaches us that.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; He said, "You were ordained from before
[54:01] the foundation to walk before him in
[54:04] love."
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:11] Because you love the Lord and are.
[54:16] See that word and he drawing it now.
[54:20] Love and call
[54:24] according to his purpose.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Not your purpose.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Not the pastor purpose, not your
[54:32] parents' purpose,
[54:34] &gt;&gt; but according to his purpose.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[54:41] Many times we we fail when we're when
[54:44] we're praying to God, we fail to remind
[54:47] God. So it is according to your purpose.
[54:51] [Applause]
[54:53] &gt;&gt; You must remind God what you're going
[54:56] through is according to his purpose,
[54:59] &gt;&gt; not your purpose.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:06] You know what you're doing when you
[55:07] remind God? You're worshiping him
[55:11] &gt;&gt; in spite of it. Hallelujah. As brother
[55:15] Job said, "Though you slay me, yet will
[55:19] I trust."
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; The only one that you can apply to
[55:30] worship
[55:32] is your physical response.
[55:35] Yes sir.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; It's not just an inward response
[55:40] but is also a physical response.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:47] Because our hearts and our bodies are
[55:50] closely connected.
[55:53] I wonder why the prophet said
[55:56] he said your body will obey your
[56:00] confession.
[56:01] Yes sir.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Let the weak say I am strong.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; And let the poor say I am rich.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. That's right.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:17] Am I helping somebody this morning?
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. We're shaking
[56:25] up the plans of the enemy this morning.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; We're digging up some things this
[56:31] morning.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; We got to stop look at our
[56:34] circumstances.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Sometimes when you look at the
[56:37] circumstances, you you put you focus so
[56:40] much on it that your joy and your peace
[56:44] is dependent on the circumstances.
[56:47] And once the circumstances been moved
[56:50] away, you don't have any joy and peace
[56:52] anymore.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Remember he said we must worship him in
[57:05] spirit and in truth.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; Mean you must be in that dimension.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Let's look at truth.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; He never said that you must say the
[57:20] truth. He said I am the truth.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; So the truth becomes a person. Right.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sometimes we people would
[57:34] say that brother Jer it is very hard to
[57:38] define.
[57:40] If you ask somebody said
[57:42] what is the truth?
[57:45] They say some may say it is very hard to
[57:48] define.
[57:52] Glory to God. They would say that it's
[57:55] it's a collection of facts that has to
[57:58] do with real reality.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; You know, some person will use it as a
[58:04] scientific and said it has to be proven.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; For example, if you go outside and I ask
[58:12] you, tell me what color is the sky.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; And you look up in the sky, you may say
[58:18] it is blue. Hallelujah.
[58:22] That can be proven because I see the
[58:24] color.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; But Jesus was moving them away from it.
[58:30] [Music]
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "I am the truth."
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; When Thomas asks him, Jesus in first in
[58:40] John 14:E6, he said, "I am the way and
[58:44] the truth."
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, in order for you
[58:48] to know the truth, it has to be revealed
[58:50] to you.
[58:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How can you know that I am
[58:56] Jehovah Gyra?
[58:59] &gt;&gt; It has to be revealed to you.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Like it did to Abraham in Genesis 22
[59:05] when Abraham said, "The Lord himself
[59:09] shall provide himself a sacrifice."
[59:12] Amen.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the truth now.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He has to be revealed to
[59:22] you.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; And that's what God does. He revealed
[59:27] himself.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Then when he's revealed to you, you can
[59:33] testify and said, "Yes, it is true."
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:41] Glory to God.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Gyra, my provider.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:53] You know that the devil, Sister D, thank
[59:56] you for your testimony.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you. You know the devil doesn't
[1:00:01] like when we testify.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't like it, you know.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Sis, I'm not going to try to scare you.
[1:00:09] But because you testify, the devil is
[1:00:11] going to attack you.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; But you stall up on your promise.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Stall up on your promise.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; You know,
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; let me tell you this. Every time
[1:00:21] probably ministers can tell you this and
[1:00:23] person that testify, every every time
[1:00:26] you testify in church, the devil comes
[1:00:28] to attack you.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; And every time you minister the word,
[1:00:32] the devil comes to attack you. Yeah.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; I sister Ruth even can testify of that.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; But you know what?
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; We are standing up on the word.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; We're not moving away from it. We're not
[1:00:48] afraid of the devil.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Before I go even further, let me share
[1:00:57] this. You know, I used to have a good
[1:00:59] friend of mine.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; He's a minister and he's a song leader.
[1:01:03] You know, and he used to love singing
[1:01:05] this song. Hallelujah. He said, "I can
[1:01:08] recommend my God to any man when I'm
[1:01:13] sick, he heal me." He used to love
[1:01:15] singing the song, Brother Jer.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; And every time he sing the song in
[1:01:19] church,
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; he say during the week, he's been
[1:01:22] attacked with sickness.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "You know what? I
[1:01:27] can't sing the song anymore.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Because every time I sing the song in
[1:01:32] church, I am being sick.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; He was afraid of singing the song.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; But I said, "Brother, God has not given
[1:01:40] us the spirit of bondage to fear."
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; But he has given us the spirit of love.
[1:01:48] Hallelujah. And of power and of a sound
[1:01:50] mind.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:56] Don't be afraid of the devil.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Give your testimony.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid that somebody might
[1:02:02] dislike your testimony. Don't look at
[1:02:04] them. Testify about your God.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; You know, I remember one time,
[1:02:16] you know, I testify that God healed me.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; You know, two days later, the pain was
[1:02:23] rocking my body. I said, "No, devil.
[1:02:27] No devil, I will not accept this.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to accept this."
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible said we are
[1:02:37] already been healed.
[1:02:39] [Applause]
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:45] We are already being healed.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; So, you know what? Requires worship.
[1:02:54] [Music]
[1:02:56] worship.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; And I tell you since I began to worship
[1:02:59] the Lord and when the pain was rocking,
[1:03:03] I began to worship more.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then after this, oh
[1:03:09] glory. Then the devil departed.
[1:03:13] [Applause]
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; No more pain.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; You know what the pain was?
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; My heart, my chest.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; I had a stomach pain.
[1:03:24] in so much that it was so severe
[1:03:28] that I could hardly move
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; and all many things was going through my
[1:03:33] head. Many things were going through my
[1:03:35] head.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Said, you know what?
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to accept that.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to accept it. I know the
[1:03:43] God I serve.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; He has revealed to me that he is my
[1:03:47] healer.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; And I am already healed.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:54] Hallelujah.
[1:03:55] Glory to God.
[1:03:58] Oh, praise God.
[1:04:01] You know, this morning I was coming to
[1:04:03] church.
[1:04:06] You know, all of a sudden my head I had
[1:04:08] a severe headache.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Severe headache.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Believe me, saints, while I'm up here, I
[1:04:16] have no more headache. Amen.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you this. You know the devil
[1:04:24] come to church
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; you're here sitting down under the
[1:04:27] anointing
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; and the devil will make you feel like
[1:04:30] that you're sick.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:34] And the devil will put things in your
[1:04:36] mind when you're supposed to be focusing
[1:04:38] on the word.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; He drop things on your mind to shift you
[1:04:42] away from the word.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; That's how he works.
[1:04:46] That's right.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Seven compound name.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Of Jehovah. Is Jehovah Gyra
[1:05:01] my provider.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He identify himself that
[1:05:07] he's your provider.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; He reveal himself to you. So you know
[1:05:12] the truth.
[1:05:14] Yeah.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; This woman that Elijah went to and the
[1:05:23] Bible said she had no flower. All she
[1:05:26] had was just a little cruise and a
[1:05:28] little high.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; When the miracle was performed,
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; she could testify to everybody that he
[1:05:36] was his that that God was his provider.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:43] Hallelujah.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Because he identify himself.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Jehovah Rafa,
[1:05:52] the Lord that he is.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; God was revealing his attribute, his
[1:06:00] redemptive to Israel which was the first
[1:06:04] church.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:07] In the book of Exodus.
[1:06:11] Hallelujah.
[1:06:12] Exodus 15 verse 26,
[1:06:17] he said,
[1:06:19] "And said, if thou will diligently
[1:06:22] hearken to the voice of the Lord thy
[1:06:26] God,
[1:06:28] and will do that which is right in his
[1:06:31] sight."
[1:06:32] See that word diligently hearken?
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Mark that word.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Mark it.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Diligently hearken.
[1:06:41] Hebrews 11 verse 6.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; What? Hebrew. Hallelujah.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; That ties right back to Hebrews 11:6.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Verse 5 said, "By faith, Enoch had this
[1:06:59] testimony
[1:07:00] and he was translated
[1:07:04] because he has this testimony that he
[1:07:06] pleased God."
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible said without faith
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; it is impossible to please him.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; For he that cometh to God
[1:07:25] must believe.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; You hear that?
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; What are you coming to him for?
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; How you coming to him because he is
[1:07:41] Jehovah Gyra? You must believe
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; that he is Jehovah
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Gyra.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; And when you believe, you must worship.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; And when you worship, you will get the
[1:07:53] victory.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; You must believe that he is

[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Exodus 15:26.
[1:08:20] Hallelujah.
[1:08:21] And will do which is right in his sight,
[1:08:24] and will give he to his commandments,
[1:08:27] and keep all his statutes. I will put
[1:08:31] none of these disease upon thee
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; which I have brought upon the Egyptians.
[1:08:37] For I am the Lord that healeth thee.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Who heal you,
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; the Lord.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; No wonder why brother James said, "He
[1:08:47] that he that is sick,
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; anyone that is sick, let him call for
[1:08:52] the elders of the church."
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:58] Because it is God's duty to heal you.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; He wants to heal you.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; It's a part of his attribute.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Without faith, it is impossible to
[1:09:14] please him.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; John said, "He that overcometh the
[1:09:18] world, and this is a victory, even our
[1:09:20] faith,
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; without faith, it is impossible to
[1:09:25] please him."
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. He that cometh to God must first
[1:09:29] believe
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; something dropped in my spirit.
[1:09:40] Thank you Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we say we believe. Brother
[1:09:45] Jared, this just dropped in my spirit.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we say we believe,
[1:09:53] right?
[1:09:55] And then we just stop.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; No wonder why some person is not healed
[1:10:01] because they stop.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; You must continue believe.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit just dropped that in my
[1:10:17] spirit.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We say we believe
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; and then we just stop.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; That's why some persons are not healed
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; because they stop.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; John 8, if you just continue.
[1:10:37] John 8:31.
[1:10:39] If you continue in my word,
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; you see, you have to continue believe.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's why the Bible said

[1:11:07] doing this but the Holy Spirit is just
[1:11:08] moving me this morning.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We say that we believe God for the
[1:11:14] phone,
[1:11:16] right?
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; But some persons
[1:11:20] before they even testify that they
[1:11:22] receive the phone, they have to get it
[1:11:23] in their hand first.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; But you know that that is not faith.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; That is not faith.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; You testify that you receive it before
[1:11:36] you even see the phone.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; Before you even have the phone in your
[1:11:40] hand. Yeah,
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; that's faith.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; So why can't we testify
[1:11:52] before we even get the job
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; that I have get a job?
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Before we even get the car that I have
[1:11:58] get the vehicle, why can't we? And we

[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; he that cometh to God must first believe
[1:13:16] that he is a rewarder of them that
[1:13:21] diligently seek him.

[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Some of those neighbors were probably
[1:18:41] her enemy.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; But you know what? She was in line with
[1:18:46] the word.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; You know what? And when she went to the

[1:19:20] writing a check."
[1:19:22] I said, "Brother Matt, here's $50,000.

[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; The Lord is your shepherd. And because

[1:21:15] We are We are blessed saints.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; No wonder why the prophet said if the
[1:21:21] bride could recognize who she is,
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; who she is.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of quoting that. I'm tired of
[1:21:30] repeating that.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; If the bride would recognize who she is,
[1:21:35] when are we going to recognize?
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Every every year upon here, we recite
[1:21:40] that over and over. If the bride will
[1:21:43] recognize who she is. So when are we
[1:21:45] going to recognize it?
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; If we're going to keep reciting it, it's
[1:21:50] full time that we step into that.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; I said, I know who I am.

[1:22:23] when the father seek such to worship
[1:22:25] him, he was speaking God was now moving
[1:22:29] from a geographically location
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; from a physical place into a dimension.
[1:22:38] When you're being in that dimension,
[1:22:40] hallelujah, you will, oh, glory to God,
[1:22:44] your peace, you will always have peace
[1:22:47] and joy.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; But you see, when you're not in that
[1:22:50] dimension,
[1:22:52] you've been governed by circumstances.
[1:22:55] [Music]
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Govern by circumstance. And every time
[1:23:02] the devil will anoint the circumstance
[1:23:04] around you.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:06] And when he anoint the circumstance
[1:23:08] around you,
[1:23:11] you start to cry out. Fear trips in.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; God said to Peter,
[1:23:18] "Come,
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; come,
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; come."
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; And Peter stopped to walk on water. And
[1:23:28] the devil just touched the water.
[1:23:31] And Peter, he shift his focus
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; of God, of Christ, and he start to look
[1:23:38] at his circumstances.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; When you look at your circumstances, you
[1:23:43] begin to jump.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; Keep focus on the Lord.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Shift your focus on the Lord.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Do not shift your focus on the
[1:23:54] circumstances because that's when you
[1:23:57] will start to drown.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes sir.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Walk
[1:24:06] above your sickness.

[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Before I close this
[1:29:48] morning,
[1:29:49] I want to read another scripture here.
[1:29:53] I think it's Psalms 137.
[1:29:58] Psalms
[1:30:05] 137, bless the Lord, oh my soul.
[1:30:10] You know,
[1:30:13] I want to sing this song this morning. I
[1:30:15] don't know if you know it, Sister Vicki,
[1:30:21] but
[1:30:24] you know, I felt led. The song was being
[1:30:26] on my heart.
[1:30:28] The song said, "God will not worship the
[1:30:33] Lord."
[1:30:35] The chorus goes for worship. Simple
[1:30:38] worship.
[1:30:40] If you are crying, worship.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; In your child's worship.

[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; He will hear your praise. seen me.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; You know that song?
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; You don't know it.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; You know it, Sister Ruth.
[1:31:04] I want you to sing it for me after after
[1:31:06] we dismiss
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; because that song is for somebody this
[1:31:09] morning.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; I'm going by the leading of the Holy
[1:31:13] Spirit.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; That song is for somebody this morning.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; He just came to my spirit.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just worship the Lord.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Amen.
[1:31:28] Psalms 137.
[1:31:31] Hallelujah.
[1:31:36] Bless the Lord.
[1:32:04] You know, this was
[1:32:07] this was a time, as I said,
[1:32:12] when the children were in Babylon,
[1:32:14] before Daniel,
[1:32:17] before the prophecy came to them.
[1:32:20] This this was wrote
[1:32:23] the Bible said verse one by the rivers
[1:32:26] of Babylon.
[1:32:30] Babylon means captivity.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; They were in captivity
[1:32:36] where we sought them. Yeah, we wept when
[1:32:41] we remember Zion. Zion would have been
[1:32:44] Jerusalem
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; or the body, the house.
[1:32:49] Hallelujah.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; But while they were in captivity and
[1:32:53] they sat down by the rivers of water,
[1:32:56] they wept
[1:32:59] when they remember Zion.
[1:33:02] Glory to God.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; They said we hung our harps upon the
[1:33:11] willows in the midst there. They hung
[1:33:14] it. They hung their harps. There was no
[1:33:17] desire to praise.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; There was no desire to worship.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Because of what they were going through.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Verse three. For there they
[1:33:33] that carried us away captive require of
[1:33:37] us a song. The Babylonian them requires
[1:33:41] a song because they knew that the
[1:33:44] children of Israel was great musician.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But their spirit was
[1:33:55] ruined
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; because of the captivity. It was ruined.
[1:34:02] Jesus. My God.
[1:34:05] Hallelujah.
[1:34:08] And they that wasted us. Look at it. The
[1:34:12] enemy wasted them.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:19] Requireth us merch, saying, "Sing us one
[1:34:23] of the songs of Zion."
[1:34:26] Hallelujah.
[1:34:28] Verse four. How shall we sing the Lord's
[1:34:32] song in a strange land?
[1:34:35] Hallelujah.
[1:34:39] In every situation,
[1:34:42] no matter the place you are, God said,
[1:34:45] "I will be there."
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Do not let the enemy defeat your spirit.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Do not let the enemy bring you down
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; that your spirit is so defeated that you
[1:34:59] cannot sing,
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; that you cannot worship. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; David said, he said, if I lay my bed in
[1:35:08] hell, he's there.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; And if I should take a ship and go to
[1:35:14] the uttermost part of the earth, he's
[1:35:17] there.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; God will never leave you.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; And he will never forsake you.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:35:31] If I forget thee, hold Jerusalem. Let my
[1:35:35] right hand forget her conning.
[1:35:39] Hallelujah.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; They ask, "How can we sing the Lord's
[1:35:46] song in a strange land?"
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; We are in a strange land.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; This is not our home.
[1:35:58] We're just a passing through.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; But the songwriter said, "My heart will
[1:36:06] go on singing until the day."
[1:36:10] Hallelujah.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Until the day my Lord calls me home.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; This situation is shifted now.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; The scene, the sen the scenario is being
[1:36:22] shifted. Amen.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; They couldn't sing, but we can sing.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:30] [Applause]
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; We can lift our voices.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; We can praise the Lord. We can worship.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; We don't lift. We're not hanging our
[1:36:40] hearts on no widow tree.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Just stand on her feet.
