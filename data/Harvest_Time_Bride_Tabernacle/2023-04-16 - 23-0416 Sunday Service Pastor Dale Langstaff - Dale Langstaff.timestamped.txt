[32:52] amen
[32:54] thank you Jesus amen Philippians 4 just
[32:58] another ones here
[33:01] Philippians 4 and I'm going to be still
[33:03] kind of touching on our our teaching the
[33:06] kitchen table of God's kitchen table and
[33:09] I just really have enjoyed that myself
[33:11] amen and Ephesians 4 11
[33:14] and now that I speak in respects of one
[33:19] for I have learned
[33:22] and whatsoever state they're with
[33:25] whichever state I'm in
[33:27] there with to be content and I know both
[33:31] how to abound be abased and I know how
[33:34] to abound and everywhere in all things I
[33:37] am instructed both to be full and to be
[33:40] hungry and both to abound and to
[33:42] suffering
[33:43] and I can do all things
[33:47] through Christ
[33:49] who strengthens me
[33:51] Hallelujah Lord Jesus we decide so you
[33:54] just add your blessings to the your word
[33:57] this morning and we give you the glory
[33:59] and honor for it
[34:01] in your name we pray amen you may have
[34:03] your seats I just was looking for
[34:05] another scripture here that
[34:07] was supposed to be on top here let's
[34:09] turn to Hebrews 2 just laying a
[34:12] foundation and just trying to surrender
[34:14] to God in how we will go amen and and
[34:17] this morning Ephesians 2 or Hebrews 2
[34:21] sorry Hebrews 2. one
[34:25] and it just uh this is concerning that
[34:28] God's kitchen table and instructions and
[34:30] his word and you know I want to say this
[34:33] you know in the world we're living in if
[34:35] if we stay with the word of God if we
[34:37] stay with what's right
[34:40] that this sink in
[34:42] you're gonna seem
[34:43] radical
[34:46] and if we stick with the message of the
[34:48] hour and the pure truth
[34:53] you're going to be snubbed
[34:56] by believers
[35:01] your pastor brother Dale's going to be
[35:03] because the the word of God just says
[35:06] some really
[35:10] hard things sometimes
[35:13] and and there's no way in the world I
[35:15] could give you an answer for it
[35:17] but believe it
[35:19] amen
[35:21] but I know in all of that
[35:24] that if somehow brother Dale can
[35:26] surrender
[35:29] there's an amazing piece
[35:32] that it can be lightening out and
[35:34] storming
[35:36] and the world going to war and blowing
[35:39] up and
[35:40] just anything and you can just walk
[35:43] around and you're just like
[35:47] it's like you ever see a kid that's been
[35:49] in a war-torn area and there's bombs
[35:51] falling in the neighbor's yard and that
[35:53] and it's and it's like if I tell you a
[35:55] story he said but you know I was working
[35:56] with electrician Herman Leicester the
[35:58] one time and and he was wired with the
[36:01] light draw on he was he was
[36:04] you know he was an electrician so he
[36:06] didn't fear him we're Christians so the
[36:08] world don't fear us
[36:10] help me preach and and so he would touch
[36:13] the wire and it would shock and he
[36:15] wouldn't even Flinch you know like a
[36:16] bomb would fall and rush and he just and
[36:19] I was standing beside him
[36:21] like this did he touch it again and it
[36:23] shot and he said Dale would you get away
[36:25] from me you're making me nervous
[36:33] didn't Jesus when he went and pray for
[36:34] the the little girl he said get away
[36:37] from me
[36:38] you're making me nervous
[36:41] that was god Jehovah
[36:48] whoo
[36:49] turn the news off brother Dale
[36:53] ouch
[36:56] whoa
[36:58] you know you should only listen to the
[37:00] news to see what time we're in
[37:02] and I'll tell you right now
[37:05] man if you don't believe in the Rapture
[37:07] you're in the wrong church because it's
[37:09] it's like
[37:14] amen
[37:15] Hallelujah
[37:17] I say this before we preach and this is
[37:19] not
[37:20] uh prophecy
[37:23] this is not a prophecy
[37:25] if I process I'm going to be able to see
[37:27] it
[37:28] plainly from God
[37:32] this is your brother Dale in the flesh
[37:37] the states will go to war with China
[37:43] they will
[37:44] they have to
[37:46] because China's cornering them in a box
[37:49] and they're going to go broke either way
[37:51] and they'll fight going broke
[37:55] guaranteed
[37:56] guarantine a hundred percent
[38:01] and I believe we're going to be here to
[38:03] see some of that I hope we're not but we
[38:05] won't be here for Atomic Warfare the
[38:07] prophet said that
[38:08] we won't be here there will be no atomic
[38:10] bombs
[38:11] but the US dollar is going down
[38:14] and there and China's pushing hard
[38:18] and the states will retaliate it's
[38:21] guaranteed it'll be over Taiwan but it
[38:23] will happen you can mark that on the
[38:25] calendar and put brother Dale's Name by
[38:27] it it'll happen
[38:29] amen
[38:30] Hebrews 2 1. therefore we ought to give
[38:34] the more Earnest heed to the things
[38:37] which we have heard
[38:39] lest at any time now we're talking about
[38:42] the word of God
[38:43] not brother Dale in the flesh
[38:45] less at any time
[38:51] they slipped away from us
[38:55] first the word be spoken of angels was
[38:57] steadfast and every transgression and
[39:01] every Disobedience received a just re
[39:04] recompense of reward how shall we escape
[39:09] how are we going to escape message
[39:12] believers
[39:15] the word of God
[39:17] if we don't obey it
[39:19] how's brother Dale going to escape
[39:22] brother God put it there
[39:23] and he sent us a prophet he loved us
[39:25] double
[39:26] he loved us double because he he didn't
[39:28] put it there he sent a teacher to
[39:30] explain it
[39:32] amen how so brother Dale Escape how
[39:35] shall we escape if we neglect
[39:38] this word of God
[39:40] you say this great salvation this great
[39:42] salvation is the word of God this is the
[39:44] message this salvation the only place
[39:46] you're going to find the Salvation is in
[39:48] the revealed word for your day
[39:50] how are you going to escape
[39:52] if we neglect this great message this
[39:55] great salvation which was first begotten
[39:58] to smoke by the Lord and was confirmed
[40:00] unto us by them
[40:03] who heard him
[40:06] wow
[40:08] see Satan knows he's a great adversary
[40:12] and he knows when to attack the bride
[40:15] he knows when like number one
[40:18] we said this last time we've ministered
[40:20] all the guns are on God's chosen
[40:23] they're not on who Satan's already
[40:26] conquered they're on his side
[40:28] they're all on God's chosen and Satan
[40:31] knows exactly when to attack
[40:34] he's fat and he's lazy
[40:37] you say brother no you don't listen
[40:39] Satan always comes in for the good
[40:42] spoils
[40:43] of God
[40:47] number one
[40:49] he's coming for God's the best
[40:52] chosen bride
[40:54] hello hello
[40:56] and he's waiting
[40:58] until you're at perfection
[41:02] and then he wants to pick the flower
[41:05] oh he don't wait
[41:07] he don't come when the flower's getting
[41:08] planted no no no he's not interested in
[41:10] the work remember how many people helped
[41:12] the chicken baked the loaf of bread
[41:14] that's like Satan
[41:16] he he he's not interested in planting
[41:18] flowers he's not interested in praying
[41:20] he's not interested in coming to church
[41:22] or foot washing the community no no he's
[41:24] not interested none of that but when you
[41:26] get raped nice and pure and holy
[41:28] and you just open up all those that
[41:30] fresh fragrance
[41:32] then Satan says that's beautiful
[41:35] I think I'll come by
[41:37] you say brother Dale
[41:40] give me an example the Philistines when
[41:42] they come in and attacked Israel
[41:45] and took the crops
[41:47] they weren't around when the Israelites
[41:50] were planting the crop in the springtime
[41:52] they weren't around when they were
[41:53] greasing the tractor and trains in the
[41:55] oil
[41:56] and the Campbells and feeding the oats
[41:58] and the hay and carrying out the waste
[42:00] no no no no Satan wasn't around no no no
[42:02] they were completely free
[42:05] amen they weren't around when when they
[42:08] were the Philistines came to church and
[42:10] they were praying on their crops nope
[42:12] nope nope Satan they were completely
[42:13] free oh praise the Lord they weren't
[42:16] around when the crops were really green
[42:17] and Lush and looked beautiful nope nope
[42:20] see then they were they were the church
[42:21] was just having Revival Glory Hallelujah
[42:24] praise God
[42:29] but when there got to be some value
[42:31] there
[42:32] when they start to open up the rows when
[42:35] that grain came all in the head and it
[42:37] started bowing under the weight of the
[42:39] beauty
[42:40] and you see you see a holy ghost-filled
[42:43] person it I'm serious you see a holy
[42:46] ghost-filled person you know the prophet
[42:48] said I never wanted to grow up and be an
[42:50] old crunchy old man but you see a holy
[42:53] ghost filled god-filled safe that's just
[42:56] filled with the Holy Ghost and he's just
[42:58] he's just like
[43:00] honey it's just so full
[43:05] and brother I just want to rub up by him
[43:09] because he's just adorable
[43:13] and that's when Satan come in
[43:15] and said I'll take the crops
[43:19] that's when Satan comes in when you
[43:20] raise up your girl's brother Matt or any
[43:22] of you your parents raise up your kids
[43:23] and then you raise them up and you labor
[43:26] indefinitely
[43:27] until it becomes teenagers
[43:29] then Satan says I'll take him he wasn't
[43:31] around when he was changing the diapers
[43:33] no no no he wasn't around sister Ruth
[43:35] when you were praying on your knees all
[43:37] night for your little girls to get the
[43:38] Holy Ghost no no Satan wasn't around
[43:40] that but then when they're coming right
[43:42] up to Beauty
[43:44] Jake says ah thank you very much
[43:51] and it's about time you punch Satan
[43:53] right in the nose
[43:54] amen you need to stand up like the
[43:57] Israelite did and I looked in the Bible
[43:59] I forget his name leaves me right now
[44:00] but he killed over 600 Philistines
[44:04] doubles himself
[44:06] I said Satan you can line up or attack
[44:08] me all out once don't make no difference
[44:10] to me
[44:11] I'd done had a rake to hear
[44:17] no no that's not that's not that's not
[44:19] that's not brother Hill talking oh no no
[44:21] no no no no no no no all these people in
[44:22] the Bible it was the anointing of the
[44:24] Holy Ghost
[44:26] it was Samson was anointing of the Holy
[44:28] Ghost I said back up double
[44:33] you're not coming fresh bullions
[44:35] and there's things in the word of God
[44:38] that we need to stand on and that's why
[44:40] he's saying that song is be at peace
[44:42] perfect peace it's not your peace
[44:45] yeah and if you're looking for peace in
[44:47] a bank account like
[44:49] sorry but you ain't never having one in
[44:52] this country
[44:55] because it's called tax
[44:57] it's It's Supernatural peace it's God's
[45:00] peace that in the storm it's not even
[45:03] affected man I read it I read an article
[45:05] in the studying and I it was talking
[45:07] about an airplane that was flying over a
[45:09] ship and the air the plane was it well I
[45:12] read another one about an airplane but
[45:13] but the ship was just tossed crazy in
[45:16] the out of control and there was a the
[45:19] one of the persons on the plane said
[45:21] something about why don't that ship sink
[45:22] and there was an old sailor on the ship
[45:25] or on the plane he told the person he
[45:28] said you know why that ship don't say
[45:30] she said that's just anchored on the
[45:33] Rock of Ages
[45:34] he said that ship's got a good old
[45:36] anchor and he said don't matter how that
[45:38] tossed he said that's holding that ship
[45:39] solid and those waves can come ready
[45:41] without but that's
[45:44] it's connected
[45:47] it ain't just
[45:48] bouncing on the race like this no it's
[45:51] connected to a rock
[45:53] called Christ Jesus
[45:55] oh hallelujah amen and we need to stand
[45:58] on God's word and we need to be at peace
[46:00] with God's word but but there's a
[46:03] disclaimer
[46:05] if we don't have the Holy Ghost
[46:07] which I which I believe you do
[46:10] but if you if somebody don't have the
[46:12] Holy Ghost
[46:13] then they can't find peace and rest and
[46:16] they definitely can't find it in the
[46:18] word of God and the message of the hour
[46:20] because they won't like it
[46:27] they won't like it
[46:31] you know I I want to share something
[46:33] with you just just give me a second
[46:37] I I believe me I'm not even preaching on
[46:40] this but but well I'll just mention this
[46:42] just
[46:43] in case
[46:45] you know in the Bible when the
[46:47] Israelites married non-believers
[46:49] God never forgave them they died in the
[46:53] wilderness
[46:55] I know I know they were under law and
[46:57] Grace
[46:58] but you know the Bible is very clear and
[47:00] I'm going to talk preaching about
[47:01] marriage
[47:02] but I'm showing you how Satan works
[47:06] you come you remember what we said about
[47:09] the kids you come and they come to an
[47:10] age it's natural even the Holy Ghost
[47:14] says natural
[47:16] it's natural affections that people want
[47:19] to get married and move on tonight
[47:22] but don't you never flirt with devil
[47:25] don't you never flirt with a religious
[47:27] devil that would be worse
[47:30] than just a flat out devil
[47:34] man
[47:35] amen I wish I could just show you my
[47:38] heart but you see religion how it's just
[47:41] fell into complete
[47:44] nothings
[47:46] amen nothing
[47:49] I was with people yesterday and people
[47:52] that are going to church or in church
[47:54] today and and I have to disclaimer but
[47:57] because they could even watch
[48:00] but
[48:01] we believe in a rapture
[48:04] and this world's not my home
[48:07] I'm on a holiday
[48:09] I'm just passing through
[48:11] and you can lay up all the treasures you
[48:13] want but they're going to burn
[48:15] they're gonna burn burn
[48:18] and now I believe in providing for
[48:21] yourself I don't mean that I I look
[48:23] ahead too
[48:24] but I'm looking ahead that they're going
[48:25] to burn
[48:27] and I'm going to heaven but there's
[48:31] every Church in town it's not preaching
[48:33] that
[48:34] it was people yesterday he said oh he
[48:36] said don't go to that place
[48:38] oh he'll depress you believes the
[48:41] world's coming to that and I'm sitting
[48:43] there
[48:44] and I'm trying not to say nothing
[48:48] and I'm thinking like I don't know if I
[48:50] should put my hand in my mouth my foot
[48:52] or I'm just the the furnaces and
[49:00] and I'm like
[49:03] the Bible says the world's going to come
[49:05] to an end
[49:06] how in the world are you sitting in a
[49:08] church believing that the world didn't
[49:09] come to an end I'm like
[49:12] my life
[49:14] hello
[49:19] but Satan
[49:21] has gnawled their senses
[49:24] over time
[49:26] and it'll never happen
[49:28] in this generation
[49:32] whoa
[49:34] here here's an example and and I really
[49:37] really I just pulled this quote up this
[49:39] morning late and so I'm really I'm going
[49:41] to go a different route and I'm going to
[49:43] be all over I'm preaching with a shotgun
[49:44] this morning but but here here here in
[49:47] the Bible
[49:49] there was a man that married the world
[49:53] and and God really was upset with them
[49:57] it was the worst King Israel ever had
[49:59] sound familiar
[50:01] bring that up to date and we're
[50:03] we've ever had
[50:06] amen and they Ahab was raiding over
[50:09] Israel and he looked at all the message
[50:11] believers
[50:13] and their beauty of holiness
[50:16] and he had a taste for something else
[50:19] that's disgusting
[50:21] that's completely disgusting
[50:24] just good old-fashioned beautiful
[50:26] natural God made us if God wasn't a
[50:29] professional
[50:32] oh my unbelievable
[50:34] amen
[50:36] and here
[50:37] he married
[50:39] Jezebel
[50:44] and she was an idol worshiper you say
[50:46] well that'll never happen in our that'll
[50:48] never happen around careful
[50:51] careful don't say that
[50:53] amen because see that's how Satan see
[50:56] see there's this crazy thing called
[50:59] feel your love
[51:01] affection and it messes up your brain in
[51:04] common sense
[51:08] and okay now let me jump forward to that
[51:10] okay I I was at the guy say I believe
[51:12] the footsteps of the righteous are
[51:14] ordered of the Lord that's that's our
[51:15] Bible you know and so I was at the gas
[51:17] station paid for some guys to just
[51:19] randomly on Friday and and a man
[51:22] commanded can I be truthful can I preach
[51:25] truthful he had shorts on he was really
[51:28] it really he didn't have a nice beard
[51:30] like brother Tim it was all full of gray
[51:32] hair so it was like it was like
[51:33] sandpaper gray and black and all that
[51:36] and but it kind of looked like on cap
[51:39] is that all right
[51:41] and he come up to the guy said he said
[51:43] tell her and he said he said I just want
[51:45] to introduce myself I'm the new pastor
[51:47] in the church down the road
[51:50] I was standing right like just right
[51:52] there
[51:54] I'm watching the whole thing
[51:57] and he said you know if you need
[51:58] anything ever and all this stuff
[52:01] and
[52:02] and I I I I I and he left and I said
[52:05] he's just going out there I said Hey
[52:07] brother I said just wait a second I'll
[52:08] talk to you in the other side
[52:10] and so I paid for my gas now what I'll
[52:13] say I said I want to introduce myself
[52:15] I said I'm a pastor too in Wyoming
[52:17] nice to meet you
[52:20] and so he asked me some things if I knew
[52:24] Pentecostal people and all this and no
[52:25] no no no no and he said well do you know
[52:27] this that organization that we we go and
[52:29] all the denominations come and praise
[52:31] and I said yep yep I know about that I
[52:33] said there's a brother gives money to
[52:34] the orphanage and he went to it I said
[52:36] yep I'm all about I heard it was
[52:38] it was wonderful yeah
[52:40] all us pastors pastors aren't you we get
[52:43] together once a month
[52:45] and pray for each other and he said I'll
[52:47] give your contact to the Pentecostal
[52:49] Pastor I said praise God
[52:51] I said I'd love to be there
[52:53] but I'm not joining them
[52:58] see I'm already married
[53:00] spiritually
[53:02] but see
[53:05] you can't put your light on your bushel
[53:08] so I'm going to go
[53:10] and I'm in heaven like this
[53:14] and if they bring up something like
[53:16] Trinity
[53:17] I'm going to blow out their light
[53:22] or they bring up
[53:23] uh-huh
[53:26] but Satan comes in
[53:29] in feel your love and he tries to will
[53:33] you
[53:34] when you're guards down he comes in when
[53:36] the crop's right like in marriage
[53:40] and then he said oh well bless God you
[53:42] know they're they go to a pretty good
[53:44] church
[53:47] they have a pretty good message
[53:48] background
[53:57] help me there's Jesus
[54:00] don't go there pretty good don't work
[54:02] with God
[54:04] amen
[54:06] and Jezebel brought adultery into the
[54:09] nation among the people and the priests
[54:11] and the ministers and they fell victim
[54:13] to this great popularity demand
[54:16] popularity demand
[54:19] hello
[54:20] popularity demand
[54:23] thank you brother man somebody's helped
[54:25] me
[54:28] popularity event
[54:31] you ever see me getting popular kick me
[54:34] in the knee
[54:37] or smash the camera one or the other
[54:40] it's not about that
[54:43] we could have Silas preaching
[54:46] you know and it is the very picture of
[54:49] our country today
[54:52] wait a minute wait a minute this was the
[54:53] prophet you this was our prophet
[54:56] the very picture of our country today
[54:58] we've Fallen to popularity man oh no I
[55:03] don't like that story
[55:05] let's not let's stop right there
[55:08] but this is the same prophet
[55:11] but I don't like that story
[55:18] no doubt the priest thought that it
[55:21] would be all right
[55:22] no doubt the message preachers thought
[55:24] that it would be okay
[55:27] if we just didn't preach on the ones
[55:29] that hurt
[55:31] amen
[55:33] he said
[55:37] I'm reading this as a quote by the way
[55:40] he said no don't no the priest thought
[55:42] that it would be all right as long as
[55:45] the government okayed it now you know
[55:47] what
[55:48] this is an amazing prophet
[55:51] and I'll tell you what if he was ever
[55:52] Vindicated
[55:54] that was just number 300 million
[55:58] how did he know covet was going to
[56:00] happen do you know I posted Facebook in
[56:03] and Bible quotes and Bible two
[56:05] scriptures and two quotes and I had
[56:07] message preachers tell me he said but
[56:09] this is different because the government
[56:11] this is Coveted and so God understands
[56:15] that we're locked out of church
[56:20] wait a minute no this was a well-known
[56:23] message preacher
[56:25] and I definitely mentioned his name
[56:27] because every single one of you should
[56:28] have known
[56:33] do you know that every single person in
[56:35] the Bible
[56:36] that was a believer
[56:37] war against the government
[56:40] every single person
[56:41] Moses
[56:43] uh the the the the woman that delivered
[56:45] the babies for the Israelites
[56:47] where should I go like the disciples
[56:50] when don't go out and preach a Jeep
[56:52] thing and they beat them
[56:54] beat them
[56:57] but I don't want to be beat for the
[56:58] gospel
[57:00] God
[57:01] we have a modern gospel we're dignified
[57:07] but but we preach about those people but
[57:10] we don't believe what they believe
[57:12] there's no way we believe what they
[57:14] believe
[57:15] no we don't because I know church is
[57:18] right in this province that when the
[57:20] government allows them to open allowed
[57:23] them to open
[57:25] hello allow them to open
[57:28] they took a month to sterilize the
[57:29] church
[57:34] so you couldn't even use the government
[57:35] quote
[57:37] whoa
[57:39] ouch
[57:40] but I don't care what the government
[57:42] okays it's got to be what God okay oh
[57:47] man that hurts
[57:49] ouch no that's certainly God that'll be
[57:52] I got it highlighted right there
[57:55] I don't look for this stuff
[57:57] God chose it to me
[57:59] I mean if you knew how hard it was to
[58:01] find that intentionally
[58:03] it'd be impossible
[58:07] and one might ask me to retrace what I
[58:11] have just said oh
[58:14] foreign
[58:19] like I mean he's great in my head
[58:30] like that's unbelievable
[58:33] but it's actually true and that is a
[58:35] very likely picture of
[58:38] today
[58:40] now by the way I'm still reading word
[58:43] for word
[58:45] you may not think that we're idle
[58:47] adulterers worshipers this is being
[58:50] certain of God 5901 25 paragraph 10.
[58:55] you may not think that we are Idol
[58:57] worshipers brother Matt
[59:00] oh but I don't want to read the next
[59:01] part I don't think we are this don't
[59:03] qualify for us this but we are
[59:08] they are
[59:10] I change that person and the government
[59:12] endorses it people today are idle
[59:15] worshipers because they worship idols
[59:17] some of them worship
[59:20] um
[59:24] movie stars
[59:26] you say oh bless God I'm a message
[59:28] believer I don't do that I don't do that
[59:31] at all
[59:32] I don't worship any movie stars
[59:34] I don't have any TV stations in my
[59:36] thinking but sometimes when you see a
[59:39] sister preach so and they hold it like
[59:42] Dolly part
[59:42] [Music]
[59:48] or however they do it
[59:50] and I just think wow is that your own
[59:53] personal technique
[59:55] you know what our Prophet said he said
[59:57] if you tried to imitate somebody you'd
[59:58] look like a clown and that was somebody
[1:00:00] with the Holy Ghost
[1:00:01] what about Hollywood
[1:00:03] you would look like a dumb clown
[1:00:07] why not just
[1:00:10] be human and yourself
[1:00:13] is there something wrong with that
[1:00:18] for idols and some worship oh
[1:00:26] money money
[1:00:29] some so much money
[1:00:33] I've heard message believe or something
[1:00:35] he said you know praise God God give me
[1:00:37] a job I'm never at church but it was God
[1:00:39] to give it to me money
[1:00:43] Mommy
[1:00:47] well I definitely wasn't going this way
[1:00:49] this way
[1:00:51] [Music]
[1:00:52] I studied yesterday and I pulled this up
[1:00:55] this morning
[1:00:57] amen
[1:00:59] Wow money
[1:01:01] for idols and some worship television
[1:01:04] television stars for idols
[1:01:07] but all the all that you put before God
[1:01:11] is an idol let it be whatever it may be
[1:01:13] now that might be now I'm going to come
[1:01:16] in closer to you you said well breast
[1:01:18] God I don't have no problem with none of
[1:01:20] that yep praise God I'm right beside you
[1:01:22] but what about your opinion on God's
[1:01:25] word oh oh what about your opinion on
[1:01:28] the message revealed word lined up with
[1:01:31] the Bible
[1:01:34] oh oh
[1:01:41] even to Satan our great adversary
[1:01:44] is such a smart one until he puts
[1:01:47] something in the church before God
[1:01:50] and you might have a great big church
[1:01:52] you might have a great building you
[1:01:53] might have a great denominations
[1:01:55] and again you might even have a great
[1:01:57] congregation oh I'm glad you didn't say
[1:01:59] pastor but let nothing come before God
[1:02:03] and your heart
[1:02:05] and that includes
[1:02:08] any Ministry including your pastor
[1:02:11] like this relationship is not with your
[1:02:14] pastor it's with God it ain't worth the
[1:02:17] Evangelist it's with God it ain't with
[1:02:19] your favorite evangelist it's with God
[1:02:21] it ain't worth
[1:02:23] amen it ain't worth none of the fight
[1:02:25] for it's with God
[1:02:27] amen
[1:02:30] anything before God is an idol and these
[1:02:33] people knew that they wasn't
[1:02:34] spirit and these people knew that they
[1:02:38] wasn't spiritual like they
[1:02:41] used to be
[1:02:44] under the reign of other kings
[1:02:47] and they thought just because they was a
[1:02:51] religious message believer it says
[1:02:53] Nation ouch
[1:02:56] that everything would be all right and
[1:02:58] that's the way we have come to the place
[1:03:01] also
[1:03:02] and there's a lot of people brother Matt
[1:03:04] sitting in message churches and they
[1:03:06] think you know
[1:03:08] but
[1:03:10] they're like
[1:03:14] and if you lay out some word
[1:03:16] they think oh well you're a radical
[1:03:18] Dale's a radical preacher don't don't
[1:03:20] have nothing to do with him he's radical
[1:03:22] those people they're radical
[1:03:24] they they have radical
[1:03:27] they go against what the government says
[1:03:28] they're radical
[1:03:30] amen
[1:03:31] I tell you what you believe the
[1:03:32] government all you can believe a hundred
[1:03:34] percent
[1:03:35] and to be submissive to the government
[1:03:37] until it comes between you and God
[1:03:39] just like husbands and wives you you
[1:03:42] wives you love your husband but when he
[1:03:44] steps between you and God
[1:03:48] that's a different Covenant
[1:03:50] and the same thing for husbands you can
[1:03:54] love your wife to death but she starts
[1:03:56] stepping between you and your God and
[1:03:58] says you know don't serve
[1:04:00] he said wait a minute I love you dearly
[1:04:02] honey
[1:04:03] but there's just one little thing I tell
[1:04:04] you for me and this house
[1:04:07] we're going down serving the lord
[1:04:10] we're going down serving the lord and
[1:04:12] all my faults I'm still going down
[1:04:14] serving the lord
[1:04:19] Hallelujah he said here here in the
[1:04:22] message brother Brown said he said God
[1:04:24] could never bless Abraham until he fully
[1:04:27] obeyed and God will not bless his seed
[1:04:31] until you fully obey
[1:04:33] separating yourself from all things of
[1:04:36] the world
[1:04:39] amen
[1:04:40] God help us God help me and I I don't
[1:04:44] see listen listen I want I want to
[1:04:46] disclaimer preachers are not perfect
[1:04:49] beings
[1:04:51] and for sure this one
[1:04:53] if you find one that's perfect
[1:04:57] praise God for the perfect ones or very
[1:05:00] close
[1:05:00] but I'm only human
[1:05:03] I'm I'm just only human
[1:05:06] like if you step on my toes this chances
[1:05:09] are
[1:05:12] I'm just human brother man
[1:05:14] amen but God can use just humans
[1:05:18] like you use the donkey sometimes
[1:05:21] amen and the weather
[1:05:23] and all these things amen
[1:05:26] I said I wasn't gonna
[1:05:28] so I have to apologize I said I was
[1:05:31] going to leave
[1:05:33] uh
[1:05:35] uh children
[1:05:38] and uh
[1:05:40] I thought I was done it at God's table
[1:05:43] but I want to mention some more
[1:05:45] scriptures that are very hard scriptures
[1:05:47] and I can't explain them
[1:05:50] or understand but I just want you to
[1:05:52] know that they're in God's word
[1:05:54] I can tell you some of my
[1:05:57] personal thoughts on it I'm disclaimer
[1:06:00] or not
[1:06:01] but and then we're going to move on
[1:06:03] to to God's table and different things
[1:06:06] you see you see everybody has their love
[1:06:10] for special Parts amen and you know
[1:06:13] that's one thing we've seen when we even
[1:06:15] when we went to Uganda we'd ask some
[1:06:17] questions like why do you do it this way
[1:06:19] or why do you do this
[1:06:21] they said well you know but but you have
[1:06:24] to stay you know what I mean
[1:06:27] you have to stay
[1:06:32] and so I know exactly the world we're
[1:06:34] living in
[1:06:36] I happen to live in it too
[1:06:39] I understand the laws of the land
[1:06:45] and God's left us here for a reason
[1:06:48] and I believe that you're going to
[1:06:49] Blossom where you were planted
[1:06:53] but I don't believe ever
[1:06:55] that you're supposed to leave God's word
[1:06:56] now I'm going to read these scriptures
[1:06:58] and they're going to they're going to
[1:06:59] make you fall off your Pew and you're
[1:07:01] gonna think but
[1:07:03] but I'm going to give you a disclaimer
[1:07:04] after
[1:07:06] but it's something and and this is not
[1:07:08] when I read these scriptures I'm really
[1:07:10] disclaiming because it's they're they're
[1:07:13] loud
[1:07:15] but this doesn't mean that I when I was
[1:07:18] in those scriptures did it right
[1:07:25] even the prophet made mistakes and went
[1:07:27] back and apologized
[1:07:28] see because we're human I mean I don't
[1:07:31] mean I'm a prophet I just mean
[1:07:33] we're humans
[1:07:35] Hebrews 2.
[1:07:38] Hebrews 23 14.
[1:07:42] it says and I I truly am going to leave
[1:07:44] this children thing and move on to the
[1:07:45] table I'm just mentioning this for a
[1:07:47] thing this is I thought I was done and
[1:07:49] as soon as I left you know probably last
[1:07:52] two Sundays ago
[1:07:55] God said you forgot about this
[1:07:57] Hebrews 23 14 he says then then shall
[1:08:01] you beat him with a rod and he shall
[1:08:04] deliver his soul
[1:08:06] from hell
[1:08:10] now that's fire out
[1:08:13] I don't believe in beating
[1:08:16] that's what the Bible says
[1:08:19] let's let's continue reading another one
[1:08:21] a rod and reproof give wisdom but a
[1:08:25] Child Left to himself bring us his
[1:08:27] mother
[1:08:28] shame
[1:08:30] why just this mother
[1:08:34] a Child Left to himself behold not
[1:08:38] withhold not correct oh I'm sorry
[1:08:41] Hebrews the last one was he Proverbs 29
[1:08:45] 15. this one's Proverbs 23 13 sorry
[1:08:50] with whole night correction from a child
[1:08:52] for if thou bedest him with the rod
[1:08:57] he shall not die
[1:09:01] I'll go to prison
[1:09:07] with whole night correction from a child
[1:09:09] for if thou beat a Sim with the rod beat
[1:09:12] him that's hard
[1:09:16] he won't die
[1:09:18] he won't die
[1:09:23] this this is in the Bible buddy
[1:09:26] okay Proverbs 22 15.
[1:09:30] foolishness abounds in the heart of a
[1:09:32] child
[1:09:33] but the rod of Correction drives it far
[1:09:39] far far from him
[1:09:42] I'm going to tell you something
[1:09:44] I believe that scripture is singing
[1:09:49] I think
[1:09:50] many parents make mistake that's I don't
[1:09:54] mean anything personally here I don't
[1:09:56] believe I believe our kids are angels
[1:09:59] every one of them
[1:10:00] every one of them
[1:10:02] amen
[1:10:04] but when you're raising kids
[1:10:06] you can
[1:10:10] the Bible says erotic but your finger
[1:10:13] can be a rod
[1:10:14] to a three-month-old baby
[1:10:19] a six month old baby
[1:10:21] maybe a
[1:10:23] seven month old baby help me out sister
[1:10:25] Patty how old you know when the child
[1:10:27] just starts defying you and they're
[1:10:30] really young
[1:10:31] you can just go
[1:10:33] and they'll go
[1:10:35] have you
[1:10:39] and see you don't have to worry about
[1:10:41] never going calling up 9-1-1 and saying
[1:10:45] my dad just beat me to death
[1:10:47] I've never seen an eight-year-old mate
[1:10:50] seven month old talk yet
[1:10:52] I've never seen a seven month pick up
[1:10:54] the receiver and dial
[1:10:56] you say to me
[1:10:58] and what happens in this many times not
[1:11:01] here this is this is not for us this is
[1:11:04] for the online people brother Jim and
[1:11:05] sister Lyndon Chatham they're grandkids
[1:11:08] sorry brother jump uh
[1:11:11] as the kids get too old
[1:11:15] you can't chain you can't make an old
[1:11:18] dog new tricks
[1:11:21] and so when they're just and and listen
[1:11:24] children were born to cry
[1:11:27] okay
[1:11:28] I'm not talking about that I'm talking
[1:11:30] about
[1:11:32] when you know they're defying you or
[1:11:35] disrespecting you as a parent and a
[1:11:39] person
[1:11:40] and they're tiny you can correct them
[1:11:43] gently with with your rods
[1:11:47] God give you 10 rods
[1:11:50] and that's all it will take for a little
[1:11:54] Enders
[1:11:56] amen
[1:11:58] and then when the child becomes older
[1:12:00] you can just you know when you're in the
[1:12:02] grocery store you can just give them
[1:12:03] this look
[1:12:05] and they go
[1:12:10] you know what I mean
[1:12:11] because they know that look follows
[1:12:14] something
[1:12:17] amen you should never correct the child
[1:12:20] in public
[1:12:23] you should say but when we get home I
[1:12:26] have a present for you
[1:12:28] see you have ways of you know in our
[1:12:31] world I have a present I'm going to give
[1:12:33] you when we get home but make sure you
[1:12:34] keep your promise
[1:12:36] and fulfill the present
[1:12:38] in private
[1:12:40] and if they were old enough explain it
[1:12:42] to them
[1:12:44] but you know 1999 and I don't mean I did
[1:12:47] it right
[1:12:49] I remember when we went to Ohio camp and
[1:12:51] we had six kids under nine
[1:12:54] and I told him when we left the motel
[1:12:56] room if you Breeze loud in church
[1:12:58] when we come back to this room
[1:13:01] praise God we're gonna
[1:13:04] have a present for you
[1:13:07] when they there I can't I just go Meddle
[1:13:14] excuse me
[1:13:16] if you're trying to correct a kid that's
[1:13:18] like
[1:13:21] I mean I'm in favor of correcting kids
[1:13:23] that are in school
[1:13:26] you waited too long
[1:13:33] no I believe in
[1:13:35] like well believe me
[1:13:38] you know what I mean
[1:13:40] like like for example
[1:13:44] if you're in a restaurant eating shrimp
[1:13:46] with brother Dale
[1:13:47] and your kid throws a fit and you stand
[1:13:49] up and go outside and he smiles he knows
[1:13:52] he got that's the language he's speaking
[1:13:56] cry go for a ride
[1:13:58] so when our kids were in charge
[1:14:00] and
[1:14:02] we'd make him go to the bathroom before
[1:14:04] now once you pass 55 sometimes you have
[1:14:07] to go for walks more often I found that
[1:14:09] out but
[1:14:11] uh but if kids now and parents know if
[1:14:15] your kids are sick
[1:14:16] if your kids are sick we're humans
[1:14:19] don't be mean to your that's ridiculous
[1:14:23] I'm not talking about
[1:14:26] your kids are sick they need bathroom
[1:14:31] man
[1:14:33] but you know I remember a few times like
[1:14:35] when our kids
[1:14:36] just the preacher preached too long
[1:14:39] and if they needed to go up for a thing
[1:14:42] maybe if you made out there less
[1:14:45] comfortable than in here they never
[1:14:47] wanted to go out very often
[1:14:49] so every time we went out we give them a
[1:14:52] little erotic correction like
[1:14:54] Maybe
[1:14:56] there was no time at all and they had no
[1:14:57] trouble sitting on the cushion pews
[1:15:00] you know what I mean but but
[1:15:05] God said you have to tell the church
[1:15:06] this because it's here no you guys have
[1:15:09] wonderful families every one of you I
[1:15:11] mean
[1:15:12] my grandkids especially like this
[1:15:16] but you know what I'm saying they're
[1:15:18] saying for us but but there's there's
[1:15:21] problems in message churches like that
[1:15:24] and the other thing that God wants to
[1:15:27] tell you is and Uganda is wonderful at
[1:15:29] this
[1:15:31] when you discipline your kids
[1:15:34] you don't have to get upset
[1:15:38] it's not your fault
[1:15:40] they were born human so you don't have
[1:15:42] to go
[1:15:45] like in Uganda
[1:15:47] you know
[1:15:48] a mother could have five kids crawling
[1:15:50] over top of her and one's fussing and
[1:15:51] she just goes
[1:15:56] because they're very
[1:16:01] non-excitable or varied
[1:16:04] not langstas
[1:16:09] they're not like every time
[1:16:11] the house catches on fire
[1:16:14] in Uganda they like to fire beside the
[1:16:16] house
[1:16:19] because because they're
[1:16:23] but when you
[1:16:24] God didn't make you to discipline your
[1:16:26] kids and scream at them
[1:16:28] because that's insanity
[1:16:32] you just you say Hey you know
[1:16:36] but you may
[1:16:38] you would actually do most of the
[1:16:39] discipline before you can talk to them
[1:16:42] and it's and it's not like a rod it's
[1:16:45] God give you 10 rods it's just
[1:16:49] you can't bite Mommy
[1:16:52] you know you can't
[1:17:00] amen
[1:17:02] but that's part of the word of God
[1:17:05] whether the country knows it or not you
[1:17:07] know
[1:17:08] I had a example
[1:17:13] if you wait too long
[1:17:15] I had a brother in the flesh
[1:17:18] that had one of his uh
[1:17:20] kids
[1:17:22] had malfunctioned you know and he was a
[1:17:25] lang staff
[1:17:26] by the way that that has to be
[1:17:28] disclaimered and
[1:17:30] he spanked this kid
[1:17:33] and the kid kept acting up
[1:17:36] and he just keep on spanking them
[1:17:38] and this kid was old enough to talk so
[1:17:40] it was a problem
[1:17:42] and and he warmed them up really good
[1:17:45] and they get all done the spanking
[1:17:48] and the kid came up to Daddy and he said
[1:17:50] Dad
[1:17:51] I thought you were going to kill me
[1:17:54] and the dad said I thought I was going
[1:17:56] to have to
[1:18:02] that's the problem with waiting too long
[1:18:05] because
[1:18:07] when something's trained to get away
[1:18:09] with it
[1:18:12] it does it more often
[1:18:15] man
[1:18:17] it does it more often so then it takes
[1:18:19] more beatings correction
[1:18:22] amen
[1:18:25] amen
[1:18:26] see living in this world
[1:18:29] we sang that song peace I want to read a
[1:18:32] couple scriptures on that Philippians 4
[1:18:34] 9 and someday God's actually really
[1:18:37] leaning on my heart to preach on peace
[1:18:39] but this world is is in great chaos and
[1:18:43] the people and and everything about it
[1:18:46] but somehow
[1:18:48] we have to be the salt of the earth and
[1:18:50] we have to be we have to be anchored
[1:18:54] so the storm don't affect us
[1:18:57] and but I want to show you something
[1:18:59] that has to be in every Walk of Life
[1:19:03] you heard up
[1:19:06] it needs to be your anchor because see
[1:19:08] your bank account status or your bill is
[1:19:11] even unpaid
[1:19:13] don't change your status with God
[1:19:16] amen and whether you're married or not
[1:19:19] married that don't change your status
[1:19:21] with God
[1:19:23] and whether you're young or old that's
[1:19:26] how old people when they hurt
[1:19:28] they're not grouchy I had no idea that
[1:19:31] my dad went through the things he went
[1:19:33] through
[1:19:35] until I'm starting to get a little bit
[1:19:37] there
[1:19:38] and you know why I had no idea didn't
[1:19:41] show it he didn't say it
[1:19:43] amen and so you have to
[1:19:46] because if we're Anchored In Christ
[1:19:49] these little things don't affect our
[1:19:52] flesh
[1:19:54] but they do they affect my flesh but
[1:19:57] we're to get by that
[1:20:00] brother Dales to get by that
[1:20:02] hello
[1:20:04] I am so let me show you that in
[1:20:06] Philippians 4 9 he said these things
[1:20:08] which ye have both learned and received
[1:20:10] and heard and seen in me
[1:20:15] now there's Paul teaching the people
[1:20:19] about what I just did about children
[1:20:23] or other things
[1:20:26] let me read that again
[1:20:28] and these things which you have both
[1:20:30] learned
[1:20:31] and received
[1:20:33] and heard
[1:20:37] was that from a person
[1:20:39] that God used in the Holy Ghost
[1:20:42] and you even seen it me so see Paul was
[1:20:45] worthy of the Gospel
[1:20:47] amen live me a sermon
[1:20:50] not not not to Perfection if you're
[1:20:53] looking you know and God of Peace
[1:21:01] will be with you
[1:21:02] in a world
[1:21:05] that there is no peace
[1:21:07] there is zero peace
[1:21:10] absolutely
[1:21:12] no peace
[1:21:14] let's go to Romans 8 6.
[1:21:18] Romans 8 6 he says
[1:21:20] for it to be carnally minded is death
[1:21:24] okay now is it okay to be honest
[1:21:28] okay that's where brother Dale is too
[1:21:30] much
[1:21:32] ouch
[1:21:35] let me to be carnally minded as death
[1:21:38] ouch that's me too much
[1:21:44] that's every one of us if you know if if
[1:21:46] things just you know
[1:21:50] I wish that cow hadn't died
[1:21:53] I wish I would have got that new job
[1:21:58] I wish my wife wouldn't have bought that
[1:22:00] vacuum
[1:22:00] [Music]
[1:22:03] I wish they
[1:22:04] you know
[1:22:07] but to be spiritually minded
[1:22:15] in the storm
[1:22:17] this piece
[1:22:18] life and peace
[1:22:20] see you can have peace but you get to
[1:22:24] choose
[1:22:25] if you wanted
[1:22:29] see the God of Peace is here
[1:22:33] do you accept them
[1:22:35] the God of Peace is here
[1:22:39] but are you living carnally
[1:22:46] wow
[1:22:47] you know that song we're saying is
[1:22:50] powerful song
[1:22:53] can you just imagine when we see the
[1:22:56] author of Peace at all I'll tell you
[1:22:58] right now brother Matt I'm going to lose
[1:23:00] my mind and it might not be much of a
[1:23:02] mind but it's going to be completely
[1:23:05] out of control
[1:23:07] the deacons are probably going to throw
[1:23:08] me out the window of Heaven
[1:23:10] because like it's going to be a mess
[1:23:16] we can't we we can't
[1:23:19] amen we need to we need to recognize who
[1:23:22] our God is we need to recognize the
[1:23:25] revelation of Jesus Christ and what he's
[1:23:27] given to us we don't have to live like
[1:23:30] you know God never put you know what
[1:23:33] when you come to church and you think oh
[1:23:36] it's Sunday again oh man
[1:23:38] I wished it was Monday
[1:23:42] you know who rejoices the devil
[1:23:45] no no okay I know we don't do that
[1:23:48] because
[1:23:49] when you're down and you're when you're
[1:23:51] disheartening and say brother Matt when
[1:23:53] I'm having a when my beans get caught in
[1:23:57] the crust
[1:23:58] and they don't want to grow and my dad
[1:24:00] used to say oh he's under pressure until
[1:24:02] the crop came through the ground
[1:24:05] okay
[1:24:07] but there's only one person that gets
[1:24:09] glory in that
[1:24:11] you know who it is Satan because you're
[1:24:14] carnally minded I mean he's like
[1:24:17] Dale's depressed today
[1:24:20] he can't worship God like he should
[1:24:23] I got him down
[1:24:25] a reindeer came out in front of me and I
[1:24:27] hit it with your nice new shiny car
[1:24:29] truck
[1:24:31] and you're upset oh good I got him
[1:24:36] the guy never ever planned that what
[1:24:38] does the Bible say who has he said I
[1:24:41] know the thoughts
[1:24:43] that I have towards you
[1:24:46] that's a piece
[1:24:48] prosper and health
[1:24:51] and strength and we're Believers and we
[1:24:54] are sad and depressed and burden and
[1:24:58] under pressure and we take depression
[1:25:01] pills
[1:25:02] and we take sleeping pills
[1:25:05] we take our
[1:25:08] God and here's God he's just right there
[1:25:10] and he said you know I don't I don't see
[1:25:12] you as having high blood pressure I
[1:25:13] don't see you as having trouble sleeping
[1:25:15] I don't see you having
[1:25:17] trouble burden of whether you can buy
[1:25:20] that
[1:25:27] that's one thing we've learned we've
[1:25:29] learned I've learned the way
[1:25:32] the people that have the least of the
[1:25:34] worldly Treasures
[1:25:39] are the happiness
[1:25:42] if you don't think that's the case then
[1:25:44] why is the richest people in the world
[1:25:46] commit suicide
[1:25:47] you know you can go to Uganda and their
[1:25:49] suicidal rate is zero they don't even
[1:25:51] know what you're talking about
[1:25:56] verify
[1:25:58] I don't have it that bad
[1:26:02] that we're sitting here on a plush
[1:26:04] Leather Coach
[1:26:05] with our feet up eating potato chips
[1:26:08] oh I'm so hard done by again about now
[1:26:21] and that's exactly how we live our
[1:26:23] spiritual life
[1:26:25] because we're we're soft
[1:26:29] you're worried about coming to church
[1:26:31] and it being air-conditioned most of the
[1:26:33] world dirt is happy
[1:26:36] under a tree
[1:26:45] I stayed in a church the other day
[1:26:47] this week
[1:26:48] and it was in the good old-fashioned
[1:26:50] Philippines in the rainy season and the
[1:26:52] water was just below their knee
[1:26:58] and every Pew was full
[1:27:00] you think a little bit of rain is going
[1:27:02] to keep us from going to church
[1:27:04] I'll tell you what when the water gets
[1:27:06] knee-deep in here and you show up to
[1:27:08] church in every peaceful I'll know that
[1:27:16] it's all in your approach
[1:27:20] God God's not the problem
[1:27:24] it's brother Dale's the problem
[1:27:26] it's our it's our flesh it's the problem
[1:27:28] amen God help us God help me God help me
[1:27:31] I'm not preaching to you I'm preaching
[1:27:32] to me
[1:27:34] amen peace
[1:27:36] you know
[1:27:43] we need to get to that point
[1:27:45] and when we get in that atmosphere
[1:27:49] I'll tell you what
[1:27:50] you talk about standing up brother Mike
[1:27:52] oh
[1:27:54] whoa
[1:27:57] you'll be like
[1:28:01] I tell you what it'll be like this
[1:28:03] brother Matt I can only give you
[1:28:05] examples that I see
[1:28:07] me and Luanne went to a restaurant
[1:28:09] not long ago
[1:28:11] and there was all the Pentecostal people
[1:28:13] there and oh praise God we're Believers
[1:28:15] and we speak in tongues and perhaps I
[1:28:17] know I believe in that too I'd like to
[1:28:19] do that every service
[1:28:21] those God's will
[1:28:24] it was all there's the bells there hold
[1:28:26] on
[1:28:27] and my wife get up
[1:28:30] and I'll tell you what
[1:28:34] God might judge standing right behind
[1:28:36] this Pulpit every head in that place
[1:28:38] there
[1:28:41] and it was right downtown at this
[1:28:43] breakfast restaurant
[1:28:45] and there was ladies four at a table on
[1:28:48] there
[1:28:51] like they were looking at a new gate
[1:29:01] man
[1:29:05] that's what God expects
[1:29:08] God expects them to do that of me
[1:29:12] because you're just so
[1:29:15] not Earthly
[1:29:17] but amen and you can't manufacture that
[1:29:21] piece
[1:29:22] because you get a big check in the mail
[1:29:24] it ain't gonna make it come to you
[1:29:27] amen because you have 15 kids it ain't
[1:29:30] gonna make you come to you or because
[1:29:32] you have the best wife in the world
[1:29:33] ain't gonna make you come to you
[1:29:36] it'll be God
[1:29:39] it'll be God almighty
[1:29:43] God help us
[1:29:47] let's turn to Luke 14.
[1:29:51] I'd like to get on at least one
[1:29:54] paragraph of scriptures on my kitchen
[1:29:56] table
[1:29:57] but we're going to end the year on this
[1:29:58] kitchen table
[1:30:01] Luke 14 27
[1:30:03] to 33.
[1:30:06] in some of these verses I might
[1:30:08] paraphrase but I got them in my iPad
[1:30:12] see
[1:30:14] and what God's trying to tell us is if
[1:30:16] we come into Christ let me let me read I
[1:30:19] gotta I'm sorry I'm sorry about this I
[1:30:21] had slept Old Bay
[1:30:23] amen let me read this in Colossians 1 26
[1:30:27] he said this even this is a mystery
[1:30:29] hidden of the ages from Generations but
[1:30:31] it's now manifested to us
[1:30:35] what's the mystery
[1:30:37] to whom God would make known The Riches
[1:30:39] of his glory of this
[1:30:41] mystery they they eat they use the word
[1:30:44] twice why do you use the twice
[1:30:47] and so brother Dale gets it
[1:30:51] and it's among the Gentiles
[1:30:53] so it's for us
[1:30:55] Colossians 1 27 Amy
[1:30:58] it's Christ
[1:31:01] in you
[1:31:03] the hope of glory
[1:31:06] and it's a mystery
[1:31:09] it's Christ in you
[1:31:11] and you cannot have Christ in you and be
[1:31:14] the same it just cannot it it will not
[1:31:18] and cannot happen it's Christ in you
[1:31:21] but it's a mystery
[1:31:27] here in Galatians 2 Galatians 2 and 20
[1:31:30] and I'm going to get back to my
[1:31:31] scripture in Luke but Galatians 2 and 20
[1:31:33] I just felt to say this here's Paul
[1:31:35] talking he said I'm crucified with
[1:31:36] Christ
[1:31:39] because I'm not alive
[1:31:43] nevertheless I live and yet
[1:31:46] not I
[1:31:49] I'm not alive
[1:31:52] and when I'm not alive
[1:31:54] it don't matter
[1:31:55] what's happening on this Earth
[1:31:57] it don't matter if China and the states
[1:32:00] go to war it don't matter if it's over
[1:32:02] Taiwan or not it don't matter if what's
[1:32:04] going on in Ukraine between Russia and
[1:32:07] the states and really it's just Russia
[1:32:09] and the states and
[1:32:10] Ukraine just happens to be in the middle
[1:32:13] uh
[1:32:14] it meant but see like these are this is
[1:32:18] just like see watch this this is
[1:32:20] definitely for brother
[1:32:21] that's just information
[1:32:24] but it's not really important
[1:32:26] like I know about it but
[1:32:30] because because I'm not alive like this
[1:32:33] ain't my home and I'm just passing
[1:32:35] through and like I'm not gonna have to
[1:32:37] plant crop on those fields because I
[1:32:39] won't be here and
[1:32:40] like not long term see see when we get
[1:32:43] that's what got so when we get to this
[1:32:46] piece
[1:32:48] if if it ain't in a Rapture if God comes
[1:32:51] and it will happen if the Rapture don't
[1:32:53] take place
[1:32:55] it's going to come and take one of us
[1:32:57] home
[1:32:58] and it very much brother Mike could be
[1:33:00] me
[1:33:01] but when you're in total peace with God
[1:33:04] I mean I mean you can't fake this
[1:33:06] brother man
[1:33:08] this is complete peace
[1:33:12] it's God's will
[1:33:14] you say listen God seemed it was just
[1:33:16] beautiful and instead of going to my
[1:33:19] funeral and crying you should say
[1:33:23] what an awesome God we sir
[1:33:26] I'd gone soon too God take me tune
[1:33:30] see it's completely different way
[1:33:32] because
[1:33:33] because I'm not even alive
[1:33:38] it's like brother Dale gets so uptight
[1:33:41] over whether it rains or don't rain or
[1:33:43] you know I mow the grass or don't mother
[1:33:46] but I'm not here
[1:33:50] hey hey hey
[1:33:52] our Prophet kind of lived God
[1:33:54] let me rephrase that our Prophet didn't
[1:33:57] kind of live that our Prophet did live
[1:33:59] that
[1:34:03] seeing his wife and and his little girl
[1:34:07] hello hello and looking back at his body
[1:34:10] on the bad and saying oh God don't send
[1:34:13] me back there don't send me back no send
[1:34:15] me back to Wyoming
[1:34:17] Edward Wyoming say oh God don't take me
[1:34:20] over there
[1:34:21] and God's like
[1:34:24] going
[1:34:25] they're reading the same letters
[1:34:29] and one's over there saying please don't
[1:34:31] send me by God please don't send me back
[1:34:34] what did Brother Brown's wife say
[1:34:38] can somebody help me preach when she was
[1:34:41] crossing over
[1:34:44] he said why in the world
[1:34:47] brother why in the world did you call me
[1:34:50] back
[1:34:52] can you imagine if one of us was safe
[1:34:56] and we were ready to go to Glory
[1:34:59] stop praying I'm gonna like swing a
[1:35:02] hammer out of my back says Patricia so
[1:35:04] you suck
[1:35:08] we don't believe that
[1:35:10] do we
[1:35:12] do we believe that do we really believe
[1:35:16] that I believe it's hope Brethren's
[1:35:18] first way
[1:35:19] do we really believe that she wished
[1:35:21] brother Branham wouldn't have prayed her
[1:35:22] back
[1:35:24] I believe
[1:35:26] uh-huh
[1:35:34] that's not religion
[1:35:37] that's that's that's not about this
[1:35:38] church
[1:35:39] that's something a lot higher than that
[1:35:45] whoa
[1:35:48] that's something that we can obtain here
[1:35:52] to be so at peace not you can't
[1:35:56] manufacture it's not your peace but
[1:35:58] you're so at peace and rest with God
[1:36:00] that's just like
[1:36:03] now I don't mean like when you come to
[1:36:05] the stop sign I'd look both ways still
[1:36:10] okay I'm not talking about being like
[1:36:12] like don't tempt the Lord thy God
[1:36:15] okay I'm not saying come to the Lord
[1:36:16] that God but if you've looked both ways
[1:36:20] and you didn't see somebody
[1:36:24] but we you know but but what we do is we
[1:36:26] live in guilt oh it's my fault they died
[1:36:28] if I would have prayed harder but I
[1:36:31] would have prayed harder and fast then
[1:36:32] brother Dale wouldn't have died
[1:36:34] or or one of your kids get killed in the
[1:36:36] car and he's like oh it's my fault I
[1:36:37] pulled right out in front of that guy
[1:36:40] no
[1:36:42] no what's your fault
[1:36:45] and then you let Satan just churn that
[1:36:50] you know
[1:36:51] you're backing up a semi and you you
[1:36:54] drive over a kitty cat or something I
[1:36:56] was going to say you know oh that was my
[1:36:59] fault I should have seen it how
[1:37:03] you were looking in both mirrors
[1:37:05] and Satan just
[1:37:08] turns out
[1:37:10] and guess who's winning
[1:37:13] because you just you just said well God
[1:37:17] I did all I could
[1:37:18] that's why when your kids if they go
[1:37:21] Wayward and you've raised them right and
[1:37:24] you've used your 10 rods of Correction
[1:37:30] okay yeah or less if you've lost
[1:37:32] anything
[1:37:33] and and you see you've raised your kids
[1:37:36] the best you knew
[1:37:37] and if you didn't know then from here on
[1:37:40] forward you're different
[1:37:41] and then you just say oh God you know
[1:37:43] what's all right God
[1:37:45] I did what I
[1:37:47] my best
[1:37:49] and then you're just peace
[1:37:51] you don't go like
[1:37:53] I hope
[1:37:55] hope
[1:37:57] I mean Hope's all right but it don't
[1:37:59] have a backbone
[1:38:01] faith has a Bible
[1:38:05] Prophet said the greatest
[1:38:08] enemy that Faith had
[1:38:10] what's that
[1:38:12] oh bless God I hope I go to heaven hope
[1:38:17] oh buddy if you're only hoping you're
[1:38:18] going to heaven you you better you
[1:38:21] better
[1:38:23] you better get in your closet when you
[1:38:24] go home today
[1:38:26] there's no hope in this
[1:38:28] I ain't taking something this seriously
[1:38:30] just by open
[1:38:31] yeah you know it's like this if I write
[1:38:33] a big check
[1:38:35] and I haven't called my wife and got
[1:38:36] permission I said I hope it goes through
[1:38:38] the bank no no no no no no no no no no
[1:38:40] no this is like eternity
[1:38:49] I'm crucified with Christ never yet let
[1:38:52] I
[1:38:53] I live not I but Christ liveth in me and
[1:38:57] the life which I now live in the flesh I
[1:38:59] live by the by The Who by the the faith
[1:39:05] the faith has a backbone and it's not
[1:39:07] hope
[1:39:08] by the faith of the Son of God that's
[1:39:10] that's concrete evidence guaranteed
[1:39:14] the money's in the bank
[1:39:17] Man Who Loved Me
[1:39:22] and gave himself for me
[1:39:24] amen see it's not about us it's all
[1:39:27] about Christ let me let me I promise I'm
[1:39:29] gonna
[1:39:30] close today
[1:39:32] I'm going to just read my Luke scripture
[1:39:34] Luke 14 27-33 and and uh I hope I hope
[1:39:39] there's something in this but I want to
[1:39:42] look into the scripture and see see
[1:39:44] these things that we don't normally you
[1:39:46] know when we're having Revival meetings
[1:39:47] we don't normally look into things like
[1:39:51] like dig down and you know the prophet
[1:39:53] said teach him gives you deep roots
[1:39:56] and when the winds blow
[1:39:58] you know
[1:40:01] amen
[1:40:02] and whosoever does not bear his cross
[1:40:04] and come after me
[1:40:06] cannot be his disciples now if we're not
[1:40:08] following all the word of God ain't that
[1:40:10] kind of like
[1:40:13] ain't that kind of like not marrying
[1:40:15] your cross
[1:40:19] see God allows God gave you his word for
[1:40:22] his your guidance
[1:40:24] then he gave you her Holy Ghost
[1:40:27] to overshadow it all
[1:40:31] amen
[1:40:32] amen for which of you denying for which
[1:40:37] of you pertaining to build a tower
[1:40:40] Sid us not down first encounters the
[1:40:42] cost whether he is sufficient to finish
[1:40:44] it or not unless happily after he has
[1:40:47] laid the foundation is not able to
[1:40:49] finish it all that beheld it began to
[1:40:54] mock him now I know you're thinking
[1:40:57] physical
[1:40:58] but just think spiritually
[1:41:03] things like
[1:41:05] they thought they were a believer I took
[1:41:07] their kids
[1:41:09] because they were beautiful and
[1:41:11] [Music]
[1:41:13] saying this man began to build and was
[1:41:16] unable to finish or what king is going
[1:41:18] to make war against another king and
[1:41:20] said it's not down first and consult us
[1:41:23] whether he is able with the ten thousand
[1:41:25] to meet him that cometh with him with
[1:41:26] twenty thousand or else another is yet a
[1:41:30] great way off he'll send an ambassador
[1:41:34] and desires
[1:41:36] connect
[1:41:38] ions of peace so likewise
[1:41:41] what and I got a quote for this
[1:41:43] scripture by the way so likewise
[1:41:45] whosoever he be of you that forsaketh
[1:41:49] not all
[1:41:53] but I didn't like those scriptures my
[1:41:54] pastor read this morning
[1:42:00] for sake it's not all their opinions
[1:42:04] cannot be my disciples
[1:42:07] but but I have a problem with that
[1:42:11] well
[1:42:13] you have to share that with God but let
[1:42:16] me it'd be okay if I read one scripture
[1:42:19] on that
[1:42:21] amen
[1:42:25] or two
[1:42:33] amen
[1:42:36] we've seen the star this is 63 12 16
[1:42:39] growth long ago
[1:42:41] as long as you're I'm just reading the
[1:42:43] Highlight Parts as long as you're tied
[1:42:46] up with a bunch of unbelievers you don't
[1:42:49] believe those things you'll never be
[1:42:51] able to Able you see you'll be as blind
[1:42:55] as a bat
[1:42:57] cut yourself away from everything mother
[1:43:00] father
[1:43:01] you know he mentions all the things
[1:43:03] forsaking his own and come after me for
[1:43:06] is not worthy
[1:43:08] who is would put his hand to the plow
[1:43:11] and look back it's not worthy
[1:43:15] and
[1:43:16] brother or sister let me tell you that
[1:43:18] there is a genuine true Christian now
[1:43:20] this is our Prophet talking here
[1:43:22] a genuine true Christian light shining
[1:43:26] today
[1:43:28] he says tonight and it's Jesus Christ
[1:43:30] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:43:32] caught loose from everything else
[1:43:36] including make belief make believers
[1:43:39] and he is the word and he's always the
[1:43:41] word and God's word is always perfectly
[1:43:43] right and it has no private
[1:43:46] interpretation
[1:43:49] ouch
[1:43:50] this means just what it says the Bible
[1:43:54] said no private interpretation and I
[1:43:57] want to just drop down here he said uh
[1:44:01] well let me let me finish this he said
[1:44:03] if it's black it's black and if it's
[1:44:04] white it's white and that's just what
[1:44:06] it's the urum it's the absolute and
[1:44:09] everybody's born of the spirit of God is
[1:44:11] tied to this now that's all the
[1:44:13] scriptures
[1:44:17] even the ones we read today
[1:44:20] even the ones you don't understand
[1:44:22] even the ones you don't think your
[1:44:24] government will understand
[1:44:30] no matter nothing will separate him
[1:44:34] if he's tied to that word because it's
[1:44:37] Christ is the word and Christ cannot lie
[1:44:40] he's the word
[1:44:42] and you say well
[1:44:44] I know he said that but
[1:44:46] oh
[1:44:49] I know God put that in the Bible but he
[1:44:51] didn't realize that he would have this
[1:44:53] liberal government you know and
[1:44:58] there ain't no box
[1:45:01] and nothing about it he just said it and
[1:45:04] that's the way and that's what it is he
[1:45:06] can't change it he can't he's
[1:45:08] unchangeable he said Heaven's a nurse
[1:45:11] will pass away but my word will never
[1:45:12] pass away
[1:45:14] he said it'll be right
[1:45:18] and there's a season
[1:45:21] and there will be somebody
[1:45:23] and there will be somebody
[1:45:26] that'll shine in that season there'll be
[1:45:29] somebody
[1:45:30] oh it might not be many
[1:45:32] but there will be somebody
[1:45:34] it's guaranteed
[1:45:35] there'll be a few
[1:45:37] you see
[1:45:39] and I'm going to read one more quote and
[1:45:41] I'm going to close I promise but you
[1:45:42] know in some of these scriptures we've
[1:45:43] read
[1:45:44] wow the prophet said
[1:45:47] things that aren't preached in message
[1:45:49] churches today but the prophets preached
[1:45:51] them
[1:45:53] you know
[1:45:55] amen
[1:46:03] he's talking about this
[1:46:06] parable about before you would build a
[1:46:08] tower or go to war
[1:46:10] that you would
[1:46:12] consider the cost before you would build
[1:46:14] it or consider the amount of the war
[1:46:17] and watch how he answers this and he
[1:46:19] said now the first thing I want you to
[1:46:21] notice closely
[1:46:23] this is an enticing Spirit 55. he said
[1:46:26] the first thing I want you to notice
[1:46:28] closely is that this is a parable
[1:46:32] you know what that means
[1:46:35] it's a fleshly
[1:46:37] talk about spiritual things
[1:46:40] amen so he's talking fleshly and it will
[1:46:43] apply In the Flesh don't build the house
[1:46:45] unless you know you can finish it but
[1:46:47] but but it's got a greater meaning
[1:46:51] and you know what that greater meaning
[1:46:52] is
[1:46:54] make sure you when you start your
[1:46:56] Christian watch
[1:46:57] you can finish it
[1:46:59] it may make sure you have the Holy Ghost
[1:47:02] so you know he will carry He will carry
[1:47:05] you through
[1:47:06] make sure you put the token over your
[1:47:08] family
[1:47:09] so until they get the Holy Ghost it will
[1:47:12] carry them through
[1:47:14] and make sure you follow all the
[1:47:16] scriptures of the word of God
[1:47:18] and then the Holy Ghost is obligated to
[1:47:21] do
[1:47:22] what the flesh never
[1:47:25] uh-huh
[1:47:28] he said now
[1:47:31] if a king was twenty thousand soldiers
[1:47:33] and he was fighting up against 10 he
[1:47:34] said first he'd sit down and see whether
[1:47:36] he can he said for whom you would not
[1:47:39] forsake all
[1:47:41] cannot be his disciples if you can't
[1:47:44] forsake everything you can't be his
[1:47:46] disciples now I want to just drop to
[1:47:48] here's the prophet it's a prayer and he
[1:47:50] said heavenly father he said I know us
[1:47:52] you know all things regarding the person
[1:47:54] of man
[1:47:56] and what the man is and thou are mindful
[1:47:58] of him and you made him man and he's
[1:48:01] just the flower of the fields and today
[1:48:04] he's beautiful and tomorrow he'll be cut
[1:48:06] down and cast into the oven and wilted
[1:48:09] away now that's good for all of us
[1:48:12] and I pray Lord to thee to be merciful
[1:48:16] to us today to let each one of us take
[1:48:18] inventory
[1:48:20] that's pretty good advice
[1:48:22] take inventory and we're here in the
[1:48:25] house of
[1:48:27] correction
[1:48:30] and we're here to
[1:48:32] learn
[1:48:34] this is the prophet talking
[1:48:36] this is I believe he's in a church
[1:48:39] we're in the house of correction and
[1:48:41] we're here to learn and know
[1:48:46] how to live
[1:48:48] now wait a minute that's what the Holy
[1:48:50] Ghost was for
[1:48:57] I'm confused
[1:49:02] well that's what the people say that
[1:49:04] don't want to fight for Ministry
[1:49:10] oh
[1:49:11] now I'm not confused see they have a
[1:49:13] problem with headship
[1:49:15] they have a problem with coming together
[1:49:16] and being brothers and sisters and
[1:49:18] buddies they have a problem with going
[1:49:20] fishing together
[1:49:22] or whatever they do
[1:49:24] you see
[1:49:25] they have a problem with living with one
[1:49:28] another
[1:49:28] like sister Patty was out this week and
[1:49:31] she was finding some nice things at one
[1:49:33] of my favorite stores for the Mennonite
[1:49:35] stories you know I love those places and
[1:49:37] she called my wife to see if she could
[1:49:39] get me something and Luanne said oh she
[1:49:41] said we're spreading fertilizer on the
[1:49:42] wheat and sister Patty said well do you
[1:49:44] want me to pray for you
[1:49:46] and my wife
[1:49:51] said
[1:49:53] no it's going good don't pray
[1:49:56] oh
[1:50:00] what
[1:50:03] what's but now now that's a joke but
[1:50:06] that's kind of how brother Dale thinks
[1:50:09] because see when I'm thinking currently
[1:50:11] minded well
[1:50:12] I got everything under control
[1:50:16] look out there's a deer coming up
[1:50:19] you soon won't have it under control
[1:50:22] but see but if
[1:50:24] like if we just have like see if we just
[1:50:27] have no opinion and it's just God
[1:50:32] that's how that's how a pastor should be
[1:50:34] with this church see
[1:50:36] you're not mine
[1:50:38] you're Christ
[1:50:40] and so whether you come or not it's all
[1:50:42] about Christ it's not about me like you
[1:50:45] see
[1:50:46] but see what the problem is pastors have
[1:50:48] low self-esteem so if you stop coming
[1:50:50] they're like
[1:50:55] but that but where was God in that
[1:50:57] picture
[1:50:58] see God had a better place for them to
[1:51:00] go
[1:51:02] maybe a better pastor
[1:51:05] but oh but I was thinking oh
[1:51:08] oh I see
[1:51:10] yeah yeah
[1:51:14] and we're here to learn and know how we
[1:51:16] should live and let it come forth from
[1:51:18] the word of God today oh Eternal God
[1:51:21] hallelujah
[1:51:24] your children here for years but as that
[1:51:27] we come back to the house of God to
[1:51:29] learn and he repeats himself why does he
[1:51:31] repeat himself
[1:51:33] because you knew I was gonna God knew I
[1:51:34] was going to read this today
[1:51:37] and we come back to the house of God to
[1:51:39] learn and now he declarifies that he's
[1:51:41] in the house of God remember I said I
[1:51:42] think he's in church
[1:51:45] to learn and to know but but the Holy
[1:51:48] Spirit does all my teaching
[1:51:50] I mean I just sit on the couch and
[1:51:54] get a coffee and God just
[1:51:58] well that might happen too
[1:52:04] but the Bible also says forsake not to
[1:52:06] something of yourself together and all
[1:52:08] the more as you see the wars and the
[1:52:10] bombs Fallen
[1:52:11] because uh
[1:52:13] in like manner that some did because see
[1:52:16] God seen the coaches ahead of time and
[1:52:18] the prophets amen you don't think that
[1:52:20] the prophets in the old time seen the
[1:52:22] cards the Chariots with with fires
[1:52:24] lights going out racing down the 401
[1:52:26] they've seen that in the Bible it's
[1:52:27] wrote right in the Bible just like that
[1:52:29] they've seen the courage but they were
[1:52:30] horses and chariots it's just
[1:52:32] it's just
[1:52:34] just well it's just God it's just
[1:52:36] Supernatural it's just amazing that God
[1:52:39] is so
[1:52:41] beautiful
[1:52:43] all-knowing
[1:52:45] and then people think that
[1:52:46] we're just going to get there by chance
[1:52:49] oh my goodness
[1:52:52] but see God wants you he wants to know
[1:52:56] amen
[1:52:58] see in Revelation it said the wife
[1:53:01] it didn't say the Holy Ghost
[1:53:04] it said the wife
[1:53:07] oh the Holy Ghost no the wife
[1:53:12] has made herself ready
[1:53:15] and I your servant desire to know more
[1:53:18] about you this is the prophet talking
[1:53:19] about God and he said I pray that you'll
[1:53:21] bring the inspiration of the Gospel upon
[1:53:23] us today and upon your servant and that
[1:53:25] your presence will inspire us through
[1:53:29] this building and will be so great today
[1:53:31] that we'll leave with our hearts
[1:53:33] Desiring to be better Servants of yours
[1:53:35] and that will Prof profitable
[1:53:39] and it'll be profitable for us
[1:53:42] to have come to church
[1:53:44] all merciful god Grant this blessing
[1:53:49] in Jesus name
[1:53:53] and and the title was
[1:53:56] enticing spirits
[1:53:59] how Satan says oh it's all right brother
[1:54:01] Matt you know it's all right if you
[1:54:04] know let's stand
[1:54:07] let's stand
[1:54:10] oh I'm sorry I I hope there was
[1:54:13] something
[1:54:14] yeah
[1:54:17] amen I I really believe that
[1:54:20] we serve an awesome God
[1:54:22] and and I know that God's got everything
[1:54:25] in control
[1:54:27] and even when brother Dale makes a
[1:54:29] mistake God still got it in control
[1:54:32] but I believe God still wants us to obey
[1:54:35] his word
[1:54:36] and
[1:54:39] do all the instructions that he showed
[1:54:41] us and then he will do what you couldn't
[1:54:45] do
[1:54:46] man you you raise up a child you train
[1:54:48] him teach them
[1:54:50] and you correct them
[1:54:51] and then God takes over
[1:54:53] man you come to church and you listen to
[1:54:55] the fivefold ministry and then God takes
[1:54:57] over it's not what the faithful Ministry
[1:55:00] says it's how God takes over but God
[1:55:02] wanted both we surrender ourselves to
[1:55:05] each other
[1:55:07] all including the faithful Ministry and
[1:55:09] then God takes over
[1:55:11] amen it's just beautiful how it comes
[1:55:13] together but we can't take out a peace
[1:55:16] and go
[1:55:20] die down it won't work no that won't
[1:55:23] work and and you know the situation and
[1:55:27] the world
[1:55:28] it's taken out
[1:55:30] a few pieces
[1:55:33] a few pieces
[1:55:37] amen God help us God help me
[1:55:41] God help me I I you know what I went you
[1:55:44] can play something honey I don't want to
[1:55:46] be known as
[1:55:48] radical
[1:55:50] I don't want to be known that one
[1:55:52] I don't desire to be looked at
[1:55:54] as uh
[1:55:56] not fitting in
[1:56:00] I don't desire that
[1:56:05] but I'm more concerned about fitting in
[1:56:06] with my Holy Spirit
[1:56:08] my Lord Jesus if I fit in really good
[1:56:11] with him
[1:56:13] and it means I don't kind of fit in
[1:56:15] to all the little clicks around here
[1:56:21] I I can I'm going to deal with that
[1:56:25] I'm going to deal with that I I just
[1:56:27] want to close with this I want to tell
[1:56:29] you Satan is a liar
[1:56:32] and he is uh he's a slicker
[1:56:37] and he'll come in just hairs
[1:56:42] hairy hairs just hairs
[1:56:47] and the next thing you know you'll be a
[1:56:50] million miles from God
