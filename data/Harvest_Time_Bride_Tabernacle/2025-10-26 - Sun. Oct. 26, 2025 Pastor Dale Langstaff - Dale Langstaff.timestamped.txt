[2:16] give us a deposit this week you know and
[2:19] that just that'll carry us right through

[9:11] fall
[9:13] and hears me when I call.
[9:20] Amen. He sure does hear us when we call.
[9:23] Amen. So, Amen. We're going to ask uh we
[9:26] got a few prayer requests. So, Dad's
[9:28] going to come this morning and just kind
[9:30] of read read them off and uh then we'll
[9:32] go in prayer. Amen. So,
[9:36] &gt;&gt; praise you, Jesus. Praise his name.
[9:42] Amen. Amen.
[9:46] Jesus,
[9:53] man. God bless you this morning. There
[9:55] just many needs uh before the throne
[9:58] this morning. Sister Cindy's in Sarnia
[10:01] Hospital and we talked to her yesterday
[10:03] and she's going to London um the first
[10:05] of the week um for surgery and I believe
[10:08] the surgery is a 50/50 chance that she
[10:10] would even live. Um but it's a surgery
[10:13] that you know if she does live she it
[10:16] would help her to walk and and different
[10:18] things and just Sister Cindy's ready to
[10:22] go to heaven. She's begging God to take
[10:23] her to heaven. She's she's
[10:26] we don't visit her without her crying
[10:29] saying, "Lord, I I ask you to take me
[10:30] home." Her moment she she she clearly
[10:34] clearly says that God showed her that
[10:35] her mom and dad are waiting for her.
[10:37] Dan, brother Danny Funk's waiting for
[10:38] her.
[10:39] &gt;&gt; She has no problem going home. She has
[10:42] more problem staying here. And just so
[10:45] let's remember her
[10:46] &gt;&gt; and and just Jesus. Yes.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; You know, if either one of us was in
[10:52] that state. Amen. The compassion that
[10:56] that we would need. Also, sister
[10:58] Margaret and brother
[11:00] Leu Lu from Uganda. Our family, they're
[11:04] not here yet. Um he lost his father.
[11:08] Amen. And um she just let us know that
[11:10] yesterday. And uh I'm not sure if they
[11:13] go home, but I do know the customs of
[11:15] Uganda. If you don't show up at a
[11:17] funeral, you're really an outcast. Um,
[11:21] and especially it being his father, that
[11:23] would just be probably not prohibited
[11:26] almost. Um, but just remember them that
[11:30] they lost. And um, also let's remember
[11:33] Jamaica.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; Um, it's uh,
[11:39] it it really
[11:42] needs our prayers. Amen. They um they
[11:46] said
[11:48] I'm sure many of you have heard
[11:49] different things, but they said since
[11:51] bookkeeping, since as long as they've
[11:54] done recordkeeping, there will never hit
[11:56] something like this before. And they
[11:59] said common winds will be 150 to 160,
[12:03] but they said the winds could reach 204
[12:06] to 29 miles an hour. I can't even
[12:10] comprehend what that would be like.
[12:12] There's nothing standing that will be
[12:14] left standing. And they could reach up
[12:17] to 50 inches of rain. That's like beyond
[12:22] belief. I mean, just um and the worst
[12:25] part of it all, it's going to be for 3
[12:28] days. Amen. So,
[12:30] &gt;&gt; and
[12:31] &gt;&gt; so [snorts]
[12:34] &gt;&gt; you can just imagine
[12:38] brother Junior here and his wife and
[12:42] little boy is in their house alone over
[12:46] there.
[12:48] I mean, and I I I've talked to brother
[12:51] Osborne. I talked to him even this
[12:52] morning. He and and it was just a short
[12:54] clip. They have no electric. But uh it
[12:58] he said he said it's not he last night
[13:01] he said Dale it's not good.
[13:06] Amen. So
[13:10] yeah. Yeah. So you just remember Uganda.
[13:13] Amen. Or Jamaica. Sorry. Jamaica. And
[13:17] also uh uh brother William or brother
[13:19] William's dad. Brother hos uh brother
[13:21] Jose's son-in-law. his dad uh Dreardo in
[13:26] the in El Salvador is the pastor there.
[13:28] I preached for him uh at least twice,
[13:31] multiple times. Every time I went and
[13:32] preached for him, he got he's been
[13:34] notified he's got stomach cancer. And uh
[13:38] William had called me and uh William
[13:40] said, "You wouldn't believe how much
[13:41] he's failed since Sunday." That was just
[13:43] like 7 days ago. [snorts] And he's not
[13:45] eaten or that like he if God don't do a
[13:48] miracle, he will totally be gone. Amen.
[13:51] Let's ask brother Bernard to please come
[13:53] and and pray for these needs. Amen. And
[13:56] just that God can God can do miracles.
[13:58] Amen. He's the same yesterday, today,
[14:00] and forever. Amen. Nothing's too hard
[14:02] for God. He knows exactly what he's
[14:03] doing. But he can heal these just not
[14:06] only from our prayer. We're going to
[14:07] hear that this morning, but he can fix
[14:09] these situations by your love and
[14:11] compassion for those people. Amen. God
[14:14] bless you, brother.
[14:28] Let's pray.

[32:34] though in all things you can give
[32:35] thanks. We're thankful that it didn't
[32:37] decide to work when it was minus 20 and
[32:39] nobody was here.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[32:41] &gt;&gt; that would have been quite a water
[32:42] problem. Amen. But uh we just let's just
[32:45] remember these prayer requests and
[32:47] sister Margaret you have our condolence
[32:49] and and the family and our great
[32:52] condolence and I can you know we have a
[32:56] great hope that we'll meet again but it
[32:58] on this earth it'll never quite be the
[32:59] same you know because uh we have loved
[33:03] ones that we miss. Amen. And uh did did
[33:07] the brother go did he go home? Did
[33:09] brother go oh no. Okay. Yeah. Wow. Can
[33:12] you imagine missing your daddy's funeral
[33:14] because of distance?
[33:18] God bless our brother. Amen.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Just I just wanted to give a
[33:23] testimony from the and we're going to
[33:24] sing a song before we preach. We had a a
[33:27] wonderful time when we were gone and I
[33:29] know you had a wonderful time here with
[33:32] brother Junior and and uh but just to
[33:36] give you a little bit of history and
[33:38] kind of what we did and I I believe that
[33:40] would be okay. Amen.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Um
[33:43] um so we left we left early Saturday
[33:46] morning and and uh Akran, Ohio's about
[33:49] not quite 5 hours and and so uh we met
[33:54] the pastor at the church and uh he took
[33:57] us to Mexican restaurant and uh by our
[34:00] strong approval
[34:02] uh right down the road and and uh but
[34:06] before we went he showed us a church and
[34:08] like they rent a place. It's very It's
[34:10] very similar congregation to us or maybe
[34:13] just slightly smaller but but very
[34:16] slightly but uh I I can tell you this
[34:19] they they just showed us amazing
[34:21] kindness. They bought us a amazing room
[34:24] for two nights at the comfort in suites
[34:26] and and it was fantastic. It was
[34:29] actually close enough that Saturday
[34:30] night we walked over to the church and
[34:33] and it was also close enough to walk to
[34:35] the Mexican restaurant. That's very
[34:37] important. Very important stuff. But uh
[34:40] uh you know uh this uh pastor Jesse has
[34:46] uh they just had their ninth child and
[34:48] their oldest son is 21. So their
[34:51] youngest uh girl was 5 months. Amen. And
[34:56] so uh we've invited him here as that's
[34:58] originally how our friendship had
[35:00] happened. And uh we've also invited them
[35:03] to camp and uh so but you know
[35:07] uh every area is is just slightly uh you
[35:10] know you know and that's good you know
[35:12] God loves flavor and different flowers
[35:14] and that they just could not believe
[35:18] they just could not believe that we
[35:21] would drive 5 hours and get a passport
[35:24] to come and see them. The whole boys I
[35:26] would have went a lot further than that.
[35:28] They just couldn't believe it. every
[35:30] every time we met him, every time of his
[35:31] service and everything, they said, "Can
[35:33] you imagine?" They went and got their
[35:34] pastors, drove 5 hours to come see us. I
[35:36] just couldn't believe it. So, I I have a
[35:38] feeling with his family, they don't go
[35:40] far. He's a school teacher, teaches
[35:43] full-time. And his kids, I just uh show
[35:45] you how his family supported it was kind
[35:48] of similar to us. Uh his oldest son uh
[35:51] does lead songs. They have two services
[35:53] on Sunday, Sunday night. But he was
[35:56] self-taught in the piano. Elliot, I
[35:58] thought of you.
[36:01] It was
[36:03] &gt;&gt; it was uh wow could he like he was a
[36:06] concertous performer and he never took
[36:09] one message. He couldn't read one note
[36:11] but he could just the the piano was like
[36:13] jumping off the floor. It was just
[36:15] unbelievable. And then you know they
[36:18] just you know they you know we were
[36:20] meeting their family. Well actually we
[36:22] prayed before we went to the service and
[36:23] there was a little tiny girl like Leah
[36:25] there and and so she was part of the
[36:28] musician. and we're praying for her and
[36:30] and you know I've never seen him before.
[36:33] Never even seen the pastor before and
[36:35] she was the drummer
[36:38] and wow she was the drummer in heaven. I
[36:40] can tell you that because it was just
[36:42] unbelievable this just little tiny girl
[36:45] that the whole building was vibr like we
[36:48] were just blown away. We said who is
[36:51] that? uh just just a little tiny girl
[36:54] and and uh you know another girl played
[36:55] accordion or organ and another girl did
[36:58] the sound and the videos and everything.
[37:01] So it was uh very similar but they had
[37:04] many many African people there uh at
[37:08] least three families two two and a
[37:10] grandma I think and uh just just uh you
[37:14] know many single brothers there was
[37:16] three or four single brothers and
[37:17] different things and uh and then we
[37:20] Monday we we left there with we we had
[37:22] amazing fellowship amazing services and
[37:25] they their kindness they give us a the
[37:27] gift that we don't deserve and and uh
[37:31] and have us invited back for April.
[37:34] And uh um anyway, so Monday we went over
[37:38] to see Luan's brother that had open
[37:39] heart surgery, triple bypass, and uh and
[37:43] some of his arteries were 99% blocked
[37:45] and we didn't let him know we were
[37:47] coming. So he was driving around in the
[37:49] yard and he was very very shocked and
[37:51] surprised. And we also seen her her
[37:54] sister and uh so we met her sister. We
[37:57] we seen the brother and you know we we
[38:00] slept in the shed. They have a very nice
[38:02] shed. [snorts] We stayed there in the
[38:04] shed on Monday night and then we went to
[38:06] see her sister at a Mexican restaurant
[38:08] on Tuesday and then we drove up to John
[38:10] Laura Garrett's and we took them to
[38:12] another Mexican restaurant in uh Fort
[38:15] Wayne and uh then we had great amazing
[38:18] fellowship with them. Uh stayed up late
[38:21] just visiting and and sharing the gospel
[38:24] and God's goodness. And then we uh had
[38:28] breakfast with them. On Wednesday, we
[38:29] come over to uh Dayton, Ohio to Paula
[38:32] Fontaine's church. And uh uh it was just
[38:36] uh really fantastic to see another
[38:39] church operate on Wednesday night. It's
[38:41] a it's a very if you haven't been there,
[38:43] it's a very big church. It's probably
[38:45] 300 people
[38:47] um or close to that on a Sunday. But I I
[38:50] I was I was I was warning Lan how it was
[38:52] going to be on Wednesday because I had
[38:54] been there on Wednesday before and
[38:55] Brother Paul had told me what it was
[38:56] like. A lot of their people they have
[38:58] people that drive like two three hours
[38:59] to church hours like well there's many
[39:02] people drive from Windsor to brother
[39:04] Paul the Fontaine's church. Anyway,
[39:06] there was a lot of people there and and
[39:08] the their kindness. Brother Paul's just
[39:10] a wonderful brother and and he has been
[39:14] uh extremely kind to us and you know,
[39:17] brother Paul Fontaine's church is one of
[39:18] the closest uh sister churches that you
[39:22] know reaches out to us and and that like
[39:24] they're closer than even brother Jose
[39:26] and Kitchener. Um and uh but we seen
[39:29] multiple people the all Julie you seen
[39:32] all the all of Quebec was there the
[39:34] Frenchman everybody from Quebec's
[39:36] movement to Paul Fontaine's church or a
[39:38] lot of them. Amen. And uh we had a
[39:41] wonderful time. So we just praise God
[39:43] for that. But uh we you know I told the
[39:46] church there I said next to the Holy
[39:48] Ghost next to salvation maybe next to
[39:50] your wife or husband the greatest thing
[39:52] that you will experience on this earth
[39:54] is meeting the other part of Christ
[39:56] &gt;&gt; while you're still here
[39:57] &gt;&gt; you're going to spend eternity together
[39:59] &gt;&gt; and if you get to meet them here
[40:02] &gt;&gt; it was just unbelievable that you you
[40:04] know Pastor Jesse we had communicated of
[40:06] course and I've watched many of his
[40:08] videos and and that but it was just
[40:10] unbelievable the unity and the and the
[40:13] kindred spirit spirit and it was just it
[40:15] was supernatural. Uh even though we
[40:19] hadn't seen in the flesh, we had been
[40:20] together in him before the foundation of
[40:23] the world. It was just really really
[40:25] really good. So, Amen. Amen. I guess I
[40:28] got to get out of this to get my Esther.
[40:30] I need you to help me sing this.
[40:32] [clears throat]
[40:33] We'd like to sing a song before we
[40:37] [music]
[40:39] just encourage you to listen to the
[40:40] words more than [snorts] uh Oh, here you
[40:45] can uh
[40:47] [snorts]
[40:47] you know uh
[40:52] you know uh every one of you's have a
[40:55] gift, a special gift,
[40:58] &gt;&gt; but I have never seen a gift like in the
[41:01] Lefontaine family [music] to write
[41:03] songs.
[41:05] It is it is beyond supernatural.
[41:09] [music]
[41:09] &gt;&gt; I mean, if if that's possible, which it
[41:12] ain't. But brother Paul Devontaine wrote
[41:14] this song in 1988 [music] when the world
[41:17] was trying to make a peace agreement in
[41:19] Israel. Man, listen to the words.
[41:25] Amen.
[41:27] While living [singing] below,
[41:30] everywhere that I go, this world's full
[41:34] of [singing] trouble and pain.
[41:37] [music]
[41:38] There's murder and crime. It's at the
[41:42] end time when everyone's going insane.
[41:47] [singing and music]
[41:49] But I found a release and my heart is at
[41:53] peace with the word of [singing] the
[41:56] hour snuggled in
[42:00] with troules unto my anchor still holds
[42:05] [music] to Jesus [singing]
[42:07] again and
[42:11] this world is falling aart.
[42:15] I'm so glad Jesus lays down
[42:18] [singing and music] in my heart.
[42:22] I'm carried away by the light of today.
[42:27] As this world is so dismal [singing] and
[42:30] dark,
[42:32] while there struggles and trles outside,
[42:37] something is [singing] stiring inside of
[42:41] the bride.
[42:43] As the world gets the dark and it all
[42:47] falls apart, I'm glad Jesus [singing]
[42:50] lives down in my heart.
[42:54] They're praying for peace, for a hostage
[42:58] release while holding a gun in their
[43:03] hand.
[43:05] There's moral decay, a great falling
[43:09] away in the shape this world in it won't
[43:13] [singing] stand
[43:16] but let it crumble and fall. I'm not
[43:19] bothered at all in the cl of the rock I
[43:24] can hide.
[43:27] When it all comes undone, I'm trusting
[43:30] in one who gives me [singing] this peace
[43:34] down inside.
[43:37] But this word is falling apart.
[43:42] I'm so glad Jesus lives down in my
[43:46] heart.
[43:48] I'm carried away with the light of
[43:52] today.
[43:56] Amen.
[43:59] While there struggles and troubles
[44:02] outside,
[44:03] something is stiring inside of the
[44:07] bride.
[44:10] As the world gets so dark and it all
[44:13] falls apart, I'm glad Jesus lives down
[44:17] in my heart. Let's sing the chorus.
[44:19] [music]
[44:21] This word is falling apart.
[44:25] I'm so glad Jesus [music] lives down in
[44:28] my heart.
[44:31] I'm carried away [singing]
[44:34] with the light of today. As the world
[44:37] gets so dismal and dark,
[44:41] while there struggles and trles outside,
[44:46] something is stiring [singing] inside of
[44:50] the bride.
[44:52] As the world gets so dark and it all
[44:56] falls apart, I'm glad Jesus [music]
[44:59] lives down [singing] in my heart.
[45:02] Hallelujah.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Maybe we'll stand and
[45:12] honey, you could text village.
[45:15] Amen. We'll just turn over to God bless
[45:17] you. It's just a great honor and we
[45:20] desperately love you, dearly love you in
[45:23] Christ. First uh John or sorry, just
[45:25] John 13:34
[45:27] and 35. Amen. I believe this will be our
[45:32] fourth uh fourth part to love. And I
[45:36] believe if if God will let me, this will
[45:38] be our last part. Amen. Next Sunday or
[45:40] next week, Brother Ben Nor will be here.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Saturday service is 3:00
[45:46] Sunday at regular time.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. John 13:34. A new commandment I
[45:54] give you, that ye love one another, as I
[45:58] have loved you, that ye also love one
[46:02] another. But this shall all men know,
[46:05] that ye are my disciples, if you love
[46:09] one another. Let's read that first verse
[46:11] again. This ain't an option, brothers
[46:13] and sisters. This is a commandment.
[46:16] A new commandment I give unto you, that
[46:20] ye love one another as I have loved you.
[46:24] Now that he gave his life for us, that
[46:27] ye also love one another. Lord God, I
[46:30] pray that that you will catch the this
[46:33] uh atmosphere, Lord God, which I know
[46:35] you have. We thank you for your
[46:37] presence. Bless your bride that's
[46:39] present here, Lord God. But Lord, I pray
[46:41] that you can use your servant to portray
[46:43] this thought to your people, Lord God.
[46:46] And may they catch the revelation of of
[46:49] who you are in this thought, Lord God,
[46:51] we pray. And what you've shared through
[46:53] me or shared to me, Lord God, we pray.
[46:56] Bless your bride. In your name we pray.
[46:58] Amen.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats. Amen.
[47:03] In the message discerning the spirits a
[47:05] man here brother Bram said the action of
[47:08] God to know that God the action of God
[47:11] in one another draws us together for we
[47:14] are one in Christ Jesus and God's
[47:17] purpose is to bring us together. See
[47:21] God's purpose you know brother said the
[47:24] reason he was against the spirit of
[47:26] denomination was because they built wall
[47:28] and divided the brotherhood.
[47:31] Amen. God's spirit is exactly the
[47:34] opposite. When he here, the prophet
[47:35] says, he says, "When a man's anointed by
[47:38] the spirit of God and he's got the
[47:40] action of God, that action will never
[47:42] break us up."
[47:45] &gt;&gt; So, just think of every time you're
[47:46] broken up, it's never the spirit of God.
[47:49] The action will draw us together for
[47:51] we're one in Christ. Amen. Just look
[47:54] over just laying a little foundation.
[47:56] We're going to look into this some
[47:58] things that God showed us here in John
[48:01] 15:12 and 14 uh John 15:12-13,
[48:06] sorry. And my commandment that ye love
[48:09] one another that as I have loved you,
[48:14] greater love hath no man than this, that
[48:16] a man lay down his life for his friends.
[48:20] Amen. You see that first scripture we
[48:22] read that we're to have the same love as
[48:24] Christ and he left the splendor of
[48:26] heaven
[48:28] to get his beard pulled to be called the
[48:30] devil
[48:32] &gt;&gt; to be spit upon falsely accused
[48:37] &gt;&gt; for me
[48:39] &gt;&gt; that that's an amazing love. Amen.
[48:40] Here's the Bible saying no greater love
[48:42] has anybody than he would very seldom
[48:45] would somebody lay down their love their
[48:47] life
[48:49] &gt;&gt; for their love. Here here another uh
[48:51] just a short quote here. He said the
[48:53] world's dying for love. There's
[48:55] something wrong. And he said he said
[48:57] what we need today is a baptism
[49:01] of love for one another.
[49:05] Amen. And you know we looked into that
[49:07] in great detail and every every example
[49:10] of being having the baptism every
[49:13] evidence of the baptism of the Holy
[49:14] Spirit was [snorts] love. Everything God
[49:18] is is love. The word of God is love. God
[49:20] is love. God protects his love. Amen.
[49:22] And brother Bram tells the story. You
[49:24] know, I got a bunch of this off this
[49:26] message. Uh he he brother preached love
[49:29] in uh 56. And if if you it's a great
[49:32] I've listened to it multiple times in
[49:34] our in our house. Amen. But he uses many
[49:38] examples. And one of the example he's
[49:40] used is a daughter that went off to
[49:42] college. And I I know you've all heard
[49:44] this, but I can only repeat what uh
[49:46] bring it to your memory. the daughter
[49:48] that went off to school and she got new
[49:50] friends and of course the new friends
[49:52] then know her family and and they they
[49:54] thought you know I I'll tell you this
[49:56] that blood runs thicker than friends by
[49:58] the way
[49:59] &gt;&gt; the family of God is the blood of God.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know I can remember you know
[50:04] you you can't have a close relationship
[50:07] that somebody how can two walk together
[50:08] unless they agree
[50:10] &gt;&gt; and it's part of the family of God will
[50:13] be will be an unbreakable thing. And so
[50:15] she was this girl being young. She
[50:17] brought home her new friend
[50:19] [clears throat] and she was coming home
[50:20] on the train and and there was a woman
[50:23] standing out there and her friend before
[50:25] she had said that that was her mother.
[50:26] Her friend said, "What an ugly person
[50:29] that is outside the train."
[50:32] And this girl being young and and
[50:34] immature and embarrassed, that was her
[50:37] mother.
[50:39] And so she avoided her mother because
[50:42] she didn't want her friend
[50:46] to see her mother was ugly. She was
[50:49] living a double life.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; You can't live a double life.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; You can't have love at church and hate
[50:56] your family.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; You can't have love at church and hate
[50:59] your boss. You can't love have here in
[51:02] the family of God and then go up town
[51:03] and hate the people in the grocery
[51:04] store. You can't have that kind of love.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; That's cheap
[51:10] garbage love. Yeah.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; And here the train man seen all this
[51:15] happening
[51:19] and he was overcome with emotion
[51:23] and he went up to that daughter
[51:26] and he reminded her of what she already
[51:28] knew. He said, "Your mom was twice as
[51:32] beautiful as you when she was your age,
[51:37] but because of love when your house was
[51:39] on fire and nobody would go through the
[51:43] fire to save you, and you would have
[51:45] died. You would have burnt alive.
[51:48] Your mother ran through the flames
[51:50] uncovered
[51:52] and her flesh fell off
[51:56] &gt;&gt; because of love.
[51:58] That's more beautiful
[52:03] &gt;&gt; than what people will avoid you for
[52:04] because of appearances.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; That's a beauty that money can't buy.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; That's that's a that's a nature that's
[52:13] inside that that you know, if we were in
[52:16] those situations, we don't really know
[52:18] what we would do
[52:20] until we live that out.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; We really don't. The keys on the desk,
[52:26] honey, corner of my desk. You know, it's
[52:29] the love that God's required of us
[52:33] is this kind of love. And this love, not
[52:36] only will it change our church,
[52:38] &gt;&gt; it'll change everybody you touch,
[52:41] &gt;&gt; it'll change the message.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; It'll change the world.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; It will literally change the world. You
[52:50] know, when we have our prayer requests
[52:51] today, you know, there's people that are
[52:55] going through a terrible hurricane and
[52:57] there's people that's lost loved ones.
[52:59] It'll be love that'll heal. I'm going to
[53:02] show you an example where brother Bram
[53:04] had had blind healing and he never
[53:07] prayed.
[53:09] Remember the good Samaritan? There was
[53:11] compassion.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; The world's dying for compassion, love.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:19] He said telling you brother and sister
[53:21] there's only one thing that can enter
[53:25] heaven is perfect love. He said not
[53:28] because you're loyal to Brandon
[53:29] Tabernacle or to your he mentions many
[53:32] denominational churches. He said they're
[53:34] all right
[53:36] but he said you should be. He said, "But
[53:39] old friends," he said, "if you because
[53:41] I've spoke in tongues or danced in the
[53:44] spirit or or went to church or cast out
[53:46] devils or moved mountains with faith."
[53:49] He said, "All of them are all right and
[53:51] they're good." But he said, "Unless you
[53:54] have real, perfect, genuine love.
[53:58] That's all that was there." He's talking
[54:01] about be when he went behind the curtain
[54:02] time, he said that's where perfect love
[54:04] was. And to get there, you're going to
[54:07] have it before you go. He said, "And
[54:10] that's the only thing that'll ever let
[54:12] you in there. That's the only thing that
[54:16] can stay there. It's the only thing that
[54:19] there was." Oh my. He said, "That's
[54:22] adoption.
[54:24] Perfect love."
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Man, I don't know if you're able to pull
[54:27] these up, Vicki, when you can.
[54:31] He said, "Thus sayaith the Lord, it'll
[54:32] take perfect love to put you in that
[54:37] place, for that's all that was there."
[54:42] Amen. You think of all I It's just It
[54:44] never I don't know. It's been a long
[54:46] time since I had a scripture affect me
[54:48] as much as a good Samaritan. What must I
[54:51] do to inherit eternal life? [snorts]
[54:54] We're so concerned about all our
[54:55] doctrines and the seven seals and all
[54:57] the message and memorizing and they're
[54:59] good. They're they're the truth.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Even memorizing the Bible, but just
[55:03] compassion.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Perfect love.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; No matter what money or how religious
[55:16] you are or how good a deeds you've ever
[55:19] done, he said that won't count nothing
[55:21] on that day. It'll take perfect love. So
[55:24] whatever you do, lay everything aside.
[55:28] else until you find and you're full of
[55:30] the love of God till you can love those
[55:34] who hate you.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; You know, I want to I want to share
[55:40] something. You can't make the ones that
[55:42] hate you love you,
[55:43] &gt;&gt; but you can still love them.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that when you love
[55:47] them, you actually put coals of fire on
[55:49] their head because they can't figure out
[55:51] this love because it's not natural love.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; It's supernatural love. Here is another
[55:58] one. It's beyond the curtain of time.
[56:00] This is a later quote. He said, "I'm
[56:02] more convinced than ever in my life that
[56:04] it'll take perfect love to enter that
[56:06] place. And there will be no jealousy,
[56:09] no tiredness, no sickness, and no age,
[56:13] old age, no death, only supreme beauty
[56:19] and joy. And whatever you do, lay aside
[56:22] everything." You know, you know, when we
[56:24] when we grow into this statue of a
[56:26] perfect man, you'll recognize trying to
[56:28] change everybody around you,
[56:31] it doesn't really matter.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; You don't you a matter of fact, not only
[56:36] do you not have to be like me, you
[56:38] probably don't want to be like me.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Why can't we just get this unconditional
[56:46] love
[56:47] &gt;&gt; and accept people where they're at and
[56:49] try to understand their situation?
[56:52] Yeah.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; The prophet shows us this perfectly.
[56:57] He said, "Whatever you do, lay aside
[56:59] everything and find perfect love and get
[57:02] to where you can love everyone, even
[57:04] your enemy. No matter if the planes are
[57:07] rocking and the lights are flashing and
[57:09] the guns of the enemy are around you,
[57:12] those things don't matter. Get perfect
[57:14] love. And if you're not saved, accept
[57:17] Jesus as your savior now. And if you've
[57:19] been baptized in water, be baptized now.
[57:22] And if you receive the baptism of the
[57:24] Holy Ghost, press on to perfect love.
[57:27] It'll take you to that beautiful, joyful
[57:30] place beyond the curtain of time. Amen.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Everything in our Christian walk is
[57:37] love. It's not being right. That's
[57:39] that's the part that that that we have
[57:42] made a mistake on. Yeah.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; No,
[57:46] &gt;&gt; God. Everybody in the Bible were wrong.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; God still loved them.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; EVERY ONE OF GOD'S PROPHETS made
[57:54] mistakes.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; It didn't change that they were God's
[57:57] prophets. God loved them
[57:58] unconditionally.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; We're looking for this some kind of
[58:02] earthly perfection in people.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; That don't exist.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Love.
[58:12] Amen.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; God help us
[58:19] &gt;&gt; here. He said, "Then a voice spake
[58:21] behind me and he said, that's what you
[58:23] preach the Holy Ghost is. It's perfect
[58:26] love
[58:28] and nothing can enter here without it."
[58:31] God help us. Let's look in First John 3
[58:35] 11-14. [clears throat]
[58:36] And I'm going to show you how Brother
[58:37] Bram shows us this story. We're going
[58:39] right into that after this. He said,
[58:41] "For this is the message that ye have
[58:43] heard from the beginning,
[58:46] that you should love one another." In
[58:48] verse 14, "And know that we have passed
[58:51] from death unto life,
[58:54] because we love the brethren. And he
[58:56] that loveth his brethren abideth, he
[58:59] that loveth not, sorry, his brethren
[59:03] abideth in death.
[59:07] Hereby perceive we the love of God
[59:10] because he laid down his life for us.
[59:13] How should we ought to lay down our
[59:15] lives
[59:17] for our brethren?
[59:21] You know, I want I you know, when you
[59:22] look at that, that's Bible. And when you
[59:25] look at this next story and you show how
[59:27] the prophet did, I was thinking of this
[59:29] as even a parent.
[59:32] I I would I would if you're not in this
[59:35] seat, that's all right. But I I wonder
[59:37] if how many of us parents wouldn't even
[59:39] have this kind of love for our kids.
[59:44] If you look real deep inside yourself,
[59:47] it's a part of the human body that if we
[59:51] can't change something and fix
[59:53] something, we say, "Well,
[59:56] not my problem.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; It's not my fault. They chose that."
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; But that's not God.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; You could think right now and you could
[1:00:08] think of the people in Jamaica and you
[1:00:09] say, "Well, I don't live there."
[1:00:12] Yeah.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; You know, there's always been hurricanes
[1:00:14] go through there.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Why would anybody stay there?
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; You see how we just exclude
[1:00:23] everything? Parents, when your kids grow
[1:00:25] up and they whatever they would do to
[1:00:27] come into adulthood and they would
[1:00:29] struggle or whatever avenue it would be,
[1:00:32] it's like, well, I tried to show them.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah, we all tried to show them,
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; but you love them in their mistakes.
[1:00:43] You love them when it don't work out
[1:00:45] their decisions they made
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; and you knew better. But you say, "Well,
[1:00:49] you know, it's real easy to say, well, I
[1:00:54] I said told you so under my breath,
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; compassion. Remember, keep this love.
[1:01:07] Compassion is love." And so,
[1:01:11] you know, you can look at, you know,
[1:01:14] I want I want to just slow down this
[1:01:16] quote. This quote is about Mexico. And,
[1:01:19] you know, most of the world don't live
[1:01:20] like North America and UK.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; And so, you can think of people that are
[1:01:25] not as as uh physically placed as you
[1:01:29] financially or comfort
[1:01:32] and you can brush that off real easy.
[1:01:36] And if you find somebody that almost
[1:01:39] bankrupts himself at home to try to make
[1:01:41] that change, people will almost
[1:01:46] well they won't understand. Shut the
[1:01:48] door, Jerry. Um, they won't understand.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; But God understood.
[1:01:57] And God showed this kind of love through
[1:01:59] a prophet.
[1:02:02] And I I I just want to I want you to
[1:02:04] try, you know, we can we can all try to
[1:02:06] justify our situation.
[1:02:09] You know, you know, I I want to say
[1:02:11] this. So, the one brother that came that
[1:02:13] was a visitor to the camp meeting and
[1:02:16] we've been to his house and he has a
[1:02:17] sign right up on uh on in his house and
[1:02:22] he you help me out how the sign says but
[1:02:24] he says we we live
[1:02:28] we simply live so others can actually
[1:02:31] simply live
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; and they had loads of money
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; but they're staying in an apartment in
[1:02:40] an H home.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; And there was times that he told he's
[1:02:46] Pentecostal, by the way. And there was
[1:02:48] times he told us that he'd give tens of
[1:02:50] thousands
[1:02:51] for people to build churches. Tens of
[1:02:53] thousands. I about fell over. A matter
[1:02:56] of fact, I did fall over inside. Now,
[1:02:59] it's not I'm not saying to give your
[1:03:01] money away and we have to have a house
[1:03:02] to stay in, you know, like,
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; but I want to show you that compassion
[1:03:10] is eternal life. So, you you know I I
[1:03:15] want a nicer house than what I'm in.
[1:03:16] That's that's not evil. But do you still
[1:03:19] have compassion for the people that
[1:03:20] don't have a house?
[1:03:23] Man,
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; that's why that's why, you know, Brother
[1:03:25] Bram tried to take many people to the
[1:03:27] mission field and every one of you
[1:03:29] people here should come with me sometime
[1:03:30] because you can't go and come home the
[1:03:33] same. It's not possible.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; You're I'll just tell you ahead of time,
[1:03:38] you're not strong enough.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; I know you're not strong enough. Yeah.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; Because I thought I was strong.
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram tells this and I I I like
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; it's just a really good example here.
[1:04:00] He said [clears throat] a few weeks ago
[1:04:01] he said, "I was standing on the platform
[1:04:03] before thousands and thousands of people
[1:04:07] in Mexico
[1:04:09] and he said an old Mexican brother come
[1:04:11] up and he was blind. We probably
[1:04:14] wouldn't have let him in his church
[1:04:15] because he would have smelled. He would
[1:04:17] have been dirty. And he had a shaw
[1:04:19] laying over him that was dusty and
[1:04:21] dirty. That would have bothered me
[1:04:23] because I would have had the vacuum.
[1:04:27] And the poor old fellow had a little
[1:04:28] cross in his hand. He was doing Hail
[1:04:30] Mary. And I said, "That's not
[1:04:31] necessary."
[1:04:33] And so he come up and he wanted to know
[1:04:35] and he came to him and he said, "I seen
[1:04:38] his gray hair
[1:04:40] under his big straw hat.
[1:04:44] Didn't he know he wasn't supposed to
[1:04:45] wear a straw hat in church
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; where he had pulled it down?
[1:04:52] And he was saying something in Spanish
[1:04:54] and I couldn't understand him. They were
[1:04:56] interpreting it. [cough] Excuse me. And
[1:05:00] he put his arm on my shoulder
[1:05:04] and he said something struck me.
[1:05:08] He said, 'I looked at him about 70 and I
[1:05:12] said, that would have been about the age
[1:05:13] of my old daddy
[1:05:16] if he would have been living.
[1:05:19] And he said, I looked at his feet,
[1:05:24] he didn't have any shoes,
[1:05:26] and I thought
[1:05:29] maybe he's never had a pair of shoes.
[1:05:34] He said, "All of a sudden, something
[1:05:35] began to move in me."
[1:05:38] And he said, "I put my foot up beside
[1:05:39] his
[1:05:41] to see if they would fit him."
[1:05:48] And I thought, "If my shoes will fit
[1:05:49] him, I'll just take them off right now
[1:05:52] and I'll just give them to him
[1:05:56] cuz maybe he's never had a pair of
[1:05:58] shoes." And he said, "I pulled up close
[1:06:00] to him. if my shoulders
[1:06:03] and he was a wider man than me, I would
[1:06:06] have given him my coat.
[1:06:10] And some of you are sitting here and you
[1:06:11] think, well, that has nothing to do with
[1:06:13] the gospel.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; That has nothing to do with the seven
[1:06:16] seals. That's just
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; it had nothing to do with it. You know,
[1:06:22] brother Bam said another place he said
[1:06:24] when he crossed the US into the Mexico
[1:06:26] border and he seen a baby with a big
[1:06:28] stomach in Mexico and they were he was
[1:06:30] starving to death. That's why he was
[1:06:32] bloated. He said, "That boy deserves to
[1:06:33] live as much as my kids at home do."
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; He's made in the image of God.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; But it's so easy that we can just
[1:06:42] exclude from that and we just say,
[1:06:44] "Well, I I know there's not one of us
[1:06:46] here that could feed all of the world."
[1:06:48] But do you even care?
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; You're going to spend eternity with some
[1:06:54] of those people that starve to death
[1:06:57] in this message.
[1:06:59] Brother Bram talked about us building
[1:07:02] palaces of churches here, million-dollar
[1:07:04] churches and missionaries going living
[1:07:06] on water and no shoes.
[1:07:09] That's not God.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; That's not the God I want to serve.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Even though I like things nice things
[1:07:15] here, I'm driving a nice car.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said I loved him
[1:07:23] something or another. I loved him. And I
[1:07:28] thought, look at there, that old fellow.
[1:07:29] Maybe he's never sat and ate a decent
[1:07:32] meal in his life.
[1:07:38] And maybe he's never wore a pair of
[1:07:40] shoes
[1:07:42] and his old rusty scuffy looking feet
[1:07:44] and his toenails all turned up. And I
[1:07:47] thought, that poor old fellow,
[1:07:50] he's got just as much right to a good
[1:07:52] pair of shoes
[1:07:54] as I do. You know, sometimes, and this
[1:07:58] is just general, but sometimes you young
[1:08:00] kids come up, you get your first job,
[1:08:02] you go out and buy a 100 pair of shoes.
[1:08:03] What about the person that don't even
[1:08:04] have a one pair?
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; That's not good stewardship. That's
[1:08:09] called stupidity.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam calls it something. He calls
[1:08:14] it selflove.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; And in Leo, there's a lot of self-love.
[1:08:18] I have that quote.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; It's all about me and mine and my hund
[1:08:23] pair of shoes.
[1:08:28] That's right.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Said, "He's got just as much right to a
[1:08:33] pair of shoes and just as much right to
[1:08:35] wear a good coat as I do, and I got just
[1:08:39] as much right
[1:08:41] to sit down to a good meal as I have."
[1:08:47] And besides all that, the devil's
[1:08:49] blinded him. [clears throat] So, see
[1:08:52] what? And something entered into me.
[1:08:54] Watch. You need to hear this word. And
[1:08:57] he said, "It was not me."
[1:09:01] Wait a minute. We all got the Holy
[1:09:04] Spirit. The Holy Spirit. Oh, God.
[1:09:08] Was talking to me.
[1:09:10] Wait a minute. He's just talking about
[1:09:12] poorness and money. That don't got
[1:09:14] nothing to do with the seven seals.
[1:09:18] That don't got nothing to do with the
[1:09:19] mysteries. This is the greatest mystery
[1:09:21] of all right here.
[1:09:23] Compassion. You don't think so? It's
[1:09:25] eternal life.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; He said, "It wasn't not me. The Holy
[1:09:35] Spirit, oh God, was talking to me into
[1:09:38] the feeling." And oh, when you come to
[1:09:41] project life by taking it into the
[1:09:44] feeling of
[1:09:46] love for that old man.
[1:09:50] You know, Brother Bram talked about this
[1:09:52] in many of the other things we'd read
[1:09:53] about when somebody makes a mistake and
[1:09:56] they're down, what do they need? They
[1:09:58] don't need your correction. They just
[1:09:59] need
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; love.
[1:10:03] You don't need to preach to them. They
[1:10:05] already heard that sermon. They turned
[1:10:07] from that sermon. They need love.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; And just then, I put my his arms or just
[1:10:14] then he put his arms around my shoulder
[1:10:17] and began to weep on my shoulder and
[1:10:19] something happened. And I thought that
[1:10:21] cursed blind devil
[1:10:25] that blind this poor man that has never
[1:10:29] had any kind of privileges
[1:10:32] in his life. And I said, well, blind
[1:10:36] spirit come out of him and all of a
[1:10:37] sudden he opened his eyes
[1:10:40] and began to scream, I can see. I can
[1:10:44] see. He said, what was it?
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; It was praying.
[1:10:51] It was fasting.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; It was studying the message so we can
[1:10:55] fight.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; It was simply living so others can just
[1:11:02] simply live.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Just simply living so others could
[1:11:09] simply live.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; What was it? Projecting the love of the
[1:11:15] Holy Spirit. the evidence of the Holy
[1:11:18] Spirit,
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; compassion,
[1:11:22] and that's the way it happened. You
[1:11:25] know, Brother Bam goes right into this.
[1:11:26] If you listen to this love message, and
[1:11:28] I didn't put this down, I was actually
[1:11:30] going to skip it, but he talked about
[1:11:31] the maniac that come up. He goes
[1:11:33] immediately right into this, this
[1:11:36] message of love.
[1:11:38] [snorts] And he said when that maniac
[1:11:39] was coming in, he told Brother, "I'm
[1:11:41] going to break every bone in your body."
[1:11:42] And he had had a history of hurting
[1:11:44] other pastors. All the pastors on the
[1:11:46] platform flee and ran away from him.
[1:11:48] Brother Bram stood there and you know
[1:11:49] what brother Bam said in this love
[1:11:51] message in 56 he said he said I thought
[1:11:54] oh you poor brother you've got that
[1:11:56] spirit on you and he said he fell on my
[1:11:58] feet. He said I had compassion for the
[1:12:02] man that was going to come up and hurt
[1:12:04] me.
[1:12:06] He said I thought I I'm just from
[1:12:08] paragraphs. said, "Oh, that poor brother
[1:12:11] has got this on him and to come up and
[1:12:14] attack me." And it was a projection of
[1:12:17] love.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; It was a projection of compassion
[1:12:22] on a maniac.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; That made him fall across his feet. Now,
[1:12:27] I I I know some of you are looking at me
[1:12:29] kind of strange, weird like this, but
[1:12:31] Brother Bram actually give multiple
[1:12:33] examples. You know the example about the
[1:12:34] bull? That's about as weird out as you
[1:12:36] can get. Yeah.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; You know when brother Bam said that the
[1:12:40] love projected the bull went down, he
[1:12:42] apologized to the bull for coming in his
[1:12:44] house.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; I've never done that yet to any of my
[1:12:48] cows.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; I know that's a bit crazy.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Do you remember the beast story? He also
[1:12:59] apologized to the bees. I would have got
[1:13:01] the blaster
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; to kill them.
[1:13:06] See, this ain't natural.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; That's why it's easy not to worry about
[1:13:11] people that I'm I'm not saying I'm not
[1:13:14] saying give your money. I'm just you
[1:13:15] just do whatever you can live with God
[1:13:18] and and survive.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; But if you have no thought of it or no
[1:13:23] character, you know, it's like these
[1:13:24] prayer requests that we prayed for. We
[1:13:27] were preparing for church and we were
[1:13:29] thinking, I don't mean that I'm anybody,
[1:13:31] but you can be like this this week.
[1:13:33] Every time I woke up in the night, me
[1:13:35] and my wife, it was like Jamaica.
[1:13:36] Jamaica pray sister Cindy, this the
[1:13:39] family that lost their father. It was
[1:13:41] like I wake like it was just I I was I
[1:13:44] went to bed consumed with it.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Somebody's lost the father. Somebody's
[1:13:48] lost the grandfather.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Somebody's hiding for their life.
[1:13:53] Somebody's wife's there without their
[1:13:55] husband there.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:59] But you know why you had to be in that
[1:14:02] spirit of prayer
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; was first you had to get in the spirit
[1:14:05] of compassion
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; cuz
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; I was sleeping
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; right but it's not just coming to a
[1:14:16] specific spot and that's all right if we
[1:14:17] do and and kneeling down that but you
[1:14:19] can be in the spirit of caring and and
[1:14:23] praying for these needs that that
[1:14:25] there's there's people already but
[1:14:27] there's going to be people die in
[1:14:28] Jamaica A die.
[1:14:32] Period.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; They're going to die
[1:14:38] [crying and screaming]
[1:14:40] and we just Oh,
[1:14:42] which restaurant are we going to go to?
[1:14:44] Mexicans.
[1:14:46] See how easy it is to just, you know, I
[1:14:48] could I could personally testify that
[1:14:50] every time I come home from especially
[1:14:53] Africa, especially Uganda, I was messed
[1:14:56] up for at least a month. cuz every time
[1:14:59] I got in my vehicle or every time I
[1:15:02] every time I bought a coffee that was
[1:15:03] $2, I think, well, there's people work
[1:15:05] all day for that.
[1:15:07] I couldn't justify nothing. It was just
[1:15:10] it it just it just twisted my mind.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Pastor Leo works five and a half days a
[1:15:23] week. He works Saturday morning. He gets
[1:15:25] $55 Canadian.
[1:15:27] He can work all week overtime and he
[1:15:30] can't gas up the van that this church
[1:15:33] bought for him.
[1:15:36] Amen. We can't maybe change that.
[1:15:40] But do we even care?
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; It'll show. Amen. See how the blind man
[1:15:46] it was it was when God's love projected
[1:15:50] what healed the blind man in Mexico.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown taught us. He said, "You
[1:15:55] know, if I'm going to pray for you, I
[1:15:58] have to put myself in your shoes. I have
[1:16:01] to walk a mile in your moccasins." Some
[1:16:03] of you parents that have kids that are
[1:16:05] struggling or that, just try to be a
[1:16:07] kid.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Just try to relive their age again.
[1:16:19] Maybe you remember when you were a kid,
[1:16:22] there was no halo over your head either.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Just compassion,
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; love.
[1:16:35] Amen. 1 John 2.
[1:16:39] Brethren, a new commandment. 2:7. It's
[1:16:42] 11. It's really 10 I want. But brethren,
[1:16:44] I write a new commandment onto you. But
[1:16:46] the old commandment which you had from
[1:16:48] the beginning, and the old commandment,
[1:16:50] the world which you heard from the
[1:16:52] beginning, and again a new commandment I
[1:16:54] write unto you, which things is true in
[1:16:56] him and in you, because darkness is
[1:16:59] passed, and true light now shineth. And
[1:17:02] he that saith that he is in the light
[1:17:05] and hateth his brother is in darkness
[1:17:08] even until now. But 10 is the one we
[1:17:12] really But he that loveth his brother
[1:17:14] abideth in the light. And there is no
[1:17:18] occasion
[1:17:19] of stumbling in him.
[1:17:22] But he that hateth his brother is in the
[1:17:24] darkness and walketh in the darkness.
[1:17:26] and knoweth neither he goeth because the
[1:17:28] darkness has blinded his eyes. Now I'm
[1:17:33] not I'm not saying that there's hatred
[1:17:35] but you know in some situations our
[1:17:38] country has blinded our eyes. Distance
[1:17:42] has blinded our eyes.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Comfort has blinded our eyes. And I like
[1:17:47] I said I'm not I'm not we're not taking
[1:17:49] up a missionary offering. That's that's
[1:17:51] entirely between you and God. But I'm
[1:17:54] just saying there's others. Do you see
[1:17:55] what I mean?
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham didn't have to feel for
[1:18:01] the man. Brother Bram didn't have to
[1:18:02] give the blind man his clothes.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Wasn't his problem. Brother Brandham was
[1:18:07] already a poor man.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Dirt poor.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; But it was something that he came up
[1:18:16] from inside him
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; was God.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; It was a spirit of God.
[1:18:24] Amen.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; You know the scripture, by their love
[1:18:28] for one another will shall all men know.
[1:18:31] We I think we've kind of failed in that
[1:18:33] area.
[1:18:35] Man, I I want to just tell you a little
[1:18:37] story. This come up fresh. And this
[1:18:40] wasn't regarding love, but wow, it was a
[1:18:42] weird experience. And and and you can
[1:18:45] ask my wife separately. After Paul
[1:18:48] Fontaine, we had an eight. We hadn't ate
[1:18:50] since breakfast.
[1:18:53] And they had a wonderful Wednesday
[1:18:55] service just I mean they had specials
[1:18:57] and I mean it was I told the way I said
[1:18:59] I couldn't believe the way that people
[1:19:00] were entering into worship and wouldn't
[1:19:02] leave after we fellowship all and they
[1:19:04] would have talked some of them like it
[1:19:07] was just overwhelming
[1:19:09] and we left there
[1:19:12] we went to the only restaurant that was
[1:19:13] still open
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; a bar and grill
[1:19:19] I hadn't ate since breakfast
[1:19:24] and you know I wasn't carrying my Bible.
[1:19:27] [clears throat]
[1:19:27] I took my tie and vest off and just for
[1:19:31] so you all know I had bibs on underneath
[1:19:33] of it. Yeah. I went to Paula Fontaine
[1:19:37] with my bibs on and an open shirt and I
[1:19:39] put a vest on in church. So I took my
[1:19:41] vest off and I was going in this bar
[1:19:45] trying to look
[1:19:55] And everybody in that bar knew that God
[1:19:58] had walked in
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; and it had nothing to do with me. It was
[1:20:06] Was it weird? Oh, it was so weird. The
[1:20:10] guy the lady sat us and a guy come up
[1:20:14] and I thought he was drunk.
[1:20:18] and they had been playing bingo.
[1:20:21] And he said, "Can I move you to a more
[1:20:23] quieter table? They're awful noisy.
[1:20:26] You're playing bingo." And I said, "No,
[1:20:28] no, this is fine." It was the owner.
[1:20:33] I never seen him come by again.
[1:20:38] Just sitting down. We ate a little bit
[1:20:42] and L had only got a bowl of soup. So,
[1:20:44] we actually ordered a BLT sandwich after
[1:20:47] we had ate.
[1:20:50] And the bartender
[1:20:54] when we left said, "God bless you."
[1:21:00] When we walked out of the bar and we
[1:21:03] were like,
[1:21:07] and I'll be flat out honest with you, I
[1:21:08] never said anything because I thought he
[1:21:10] was mocking.
[1:21:12] And Lanne said, "Everybody in that bar
[1:21:18] knew that a different atmosphere."
[1:21:21] We had just came from a powerful service
[1:21:24] and Paul Fonte and the first words that
[1:21:26] come out of my mouth I think I saw at
[1:21:28] the table was I looked across the way I
[1:21:30] said, "Wow,
[1:21:32] this is a lot different atmosphere than
[1:21:34] we just came from."
[1:21:36] You don't think they It was
[1:21:39] unbelievable.
[1:21:41] You want me to tell you what? We never
[1:21:43] had to open one door when we left. We
[1:21:44] walked through two doors and people held
[1:21:46] the doors for us.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; You don't think you're comp You don't
[1:21:50] think your presence PEOPLE RECOGNIZE IT?
[1:21:53] YOU'RE BLINDED TO IT.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE BLINDED TO IT. YOU'RE not even
[1:21:57] recognizing the atmosphere that you're
[1:21:59] in.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; You're you're packing Jehovah. You can't
[1:22:03] cover him up.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; You can take off your vest and wear bib
[1:22:07] overhauls. Jehovah's shining out.
[1:22:12] That's right. Amen. Amen.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 5:25
[1:22:17] and 28.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; I want to show you something here. And
[1:22:23] we're going to read a few quotes. We're
[1:22:24] not going to be we're going to close
[1:22:25] here soon, Lord willing.
[1:22:29] And this has nothing to do with
[1:22:31] relationships.
[1:22:34] We're not even going there. I want you
[1:22:36] to really hear what the prophet Paul's
[1:22:40] saying and how Christ anointed him. He
[1:22:42] said, "Husbands,
[1:22:45] love your wives."
[1:22:48] This is the part I want. Even as Christ
[1:22:50] loved the church, that means he died for
[1:22:52] us.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Husbands, be willing to die
[1:22:58] for your wives.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Most of us would not be.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Husbands, be willing to die for your
[1:23:04] wife.
[1:23:06] Husbands, would you be willing to die
[1:23:08] for your kids?
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Even as Christ also loved the church,
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; it was life and death was the love. So
[1:23:24] ought a man to love his own wives, verse
[1:23:27] 28,
[1:23:28] [snorts]
[1:23:29] as their own bodies.
[1:23:34] And because we couldn't understand how
[1:23:36] strong this love was, he said, "Anybody
[1:23:40] that loveth his wife loves himself
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; because nobody has ever hated his own
[1:23:45] flesh."
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; See the power in love.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; The love was just complete. This ain't
[1:23:58] this cheap, you know, but this was real
[1:24:01] God love. Yeah,
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; this wasn't the filial cheap
[1:24:05] love.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; But when you had a God be loved. Brother
[1:24:08] Bram told the story of this. He said and
[1:24:10] and I I I fear God fears that that maybe
[1:24:15] we can do better. You know that if if a
[1:24:17] if a somebody would come up and mistreat
[1:24:19] our loved ones,
[1:24:22] we would just we would even the score.
[1:24:27] You know what I mean?
[1:24:31] we would either beat him away or
[1:24:35] if you were in the States, you'd be
[1:24:36] packing.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; But brother Bram said that if somebody
[1:24:42] come up and mistreated your kids or your
[1:24:44] wife, he actually said handled your wife
[1:24:49] that God's love was you would get down
[1:24:51] and pray for his soul. Brother Dale
[1:24:52] wouldn't do that.
[1:24:57] You can tell me you would, but but
[1:25:00] that's where we got to be to get there.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; If somebody
[1:25:07] touches my sweetheart after we get the
[1:25:10] score settled, I'll pray for his soul,
[1:25:12] but he'll be dead then, so it'll be too
[1:25:13] late.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that's that's that's what
[1:25:19] agape love is.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; That it's ridiculous. It's insanity when
[1:25:24] brother Brandon he just rolls it right
[1:25:25] off his thing. He says somebody's going
[1:25:27] to mistreat and you're going to get down
[1:25:28] and say, "Well, Lord, you know, save
[1:25:29] him." He didn't mean he don't know what
[1:25:30] he's doing.
[1:25:33] See, we thought we had the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; You can tell that by how you would
[1:25:38] retaliate.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; I said ouch before you. I said ouch when
[1:25:46] this was coming to me.
[1:25:48] You know, Brother Bram said that your
[1:25:49] response to road rage could affect the
[1:25:51] person's eternal destination
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; because we're going to even the score.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Well, that you know,
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; I know the thing popped there, but it's
[1:26:04] real.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; He said when he went behind the curtain
[1:26:06] of time, the only thing that was there
[1:26:09] was completely perfect love.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Here the prophet says a 64 quote. He
[1:26:21] said, "Many times we want to judge a man
[1:26:24] because he didn't agree with them. We're
[1:26:27] not to do that."
[1:26:31] Wow.
[1:26:34] We can disagree with one another and be
[1:26:36] friendly.
[1:26:38] And if you can't disagree with the man
[1:26:41] and still love him and pray for him.
[1:26:45] Wow. And pray that he would get more
[1:26:48] enlightenment.
[1:26:52] When you don't want to say nothing to
[1:26:54] him and you always want to disagree with
[1:26:56] him, be friendly because I love him. And
[1:26:59] I certainly don't want to see him lost.
[1:27:01] The person that you disagree with
[1:27:03] bitterly, would you like to see them in
[1:27:05] hell?
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:27:17] See, a real Christian, the Bible says,
[1:27:20] now he knew, God knew because he's
[1:27:21] omnipotent. He knew that not all would
[1:27:23] accept him, but he would that none would
[1:27:26] be lost.
[1:27:28] That means somebody comes and robs your
[1:27:29] family, you pray that they're in heaven.
[1:27:34] I've heard things like this said, "I
[1:27:35] hope I don't want to spend time with
[1:27:37] them in heaven."
[1:27:39] So, you would hope they would go to the
[1:27:40] opposite place.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; You know, like the little Sunday school
[1:27:46] girl that came home from school and the
[1:27:48] the atheist was sit or come home from
[1:27:50] Sunday school and the atheist was
[1:27:51] sitting on the porch. Brother Bram tells
[1:27:52] the story and he says, "How do you know
[1:27:55] that all this stuff's real?" And he
[1:27:56] said, she said, "Well, when I get to
[1:27:58] heaven, I'll ask Jonah." It was talking
[1:28:00] about Jonah. I'll ask him. She said,
[1:28:02] 'What if he ain't there? And she said,
[1:28:03] 'Well, you can ask him at the other
[1:28:04] place.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Just she just believed.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; She just believed. Amen.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; But you know which one of us if somebody
[1:28:16] really hurt your kids.
[1:28:20] Could happen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Canada's kind of changing.
[1:28:24] Y
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; there's things happening in Toronto in
[1:28:28] Vancouver that you would have never
[1:28:30] believed would happen in this country.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Do you know in Vancouver I think uh
[1:28:34] three out of four people that go up town
[1:28:36] get mugged?
[1:28:40] Think of the believers there. Think of
[1:28:42] the sisters, young sisters go up town.
[1:28:44] Four go up town together. Three get
[1:28:45] mugged.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; They're going to pray for that person's
[1:28:48] soul.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; That's a god by love.
[1:28:54] That's a place that
[1:28:57] maybe we have to get to.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what it'll have to be when
[1:29:02] we get behind the curtain of time. Amen.
[1:29:08] [clears throat]
[1:29:09] Amen. God help me. I I had to digest
[1:29:13] this before I could bring it. It's it's
[1:29:16] it's something else. Amen. Love.
[1:29:21] He here the prophet says excuse me
[1:29:23] standing here on the platform he said
[1:29:26] speak this and rejoicing because I'm so
[1:29:29] happy to be here said I think God wants
[1:29:31] his children to be happy
[1:29:34] and I believe we can run it into the
[1:29:36] extremes but he said I believe
[1:29:40] that God wants his people to be real
[1:29:42] happy
[1:29:44] and sociable and friendly from our
[1:29:47] hearts loving
[1:29:49] each other as God for Christ's sake
[1:29:52] loved us.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Just be happy in love. Who cares what
[1:29:56] any It don't matter if you're dressed
[1:29:58] like me, live like me, talk like me,
[1:30:02] just love.
[1:30:05] Maybe they'd want to be what you are.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; I think that's the way we ought to be
[1:30:12] happy Christians. I want to close with a
[1:30:15] scripture and maybe just we're we're
[1:30:17] just right. Actually, I got the end and
[1:30:18] I'm going over it. So, [snorts] Proverbs
[1:30:23] 21:2,
[1:30:26] and we mentioned this earlier, this I
[1:30:29] actually just it was it actually come
[1:30:31] over the radio when I was going to pick
[1:30:32] up bags yesterday and I immediately put
[1:30:35] it on my phone. Every man is right in
[1:30:37] his own eyes.
[1:30:39] Oh, boy. That sure took to me. Said,
[1:30:42] "Yes, sir." That's brother Dale.
[1:30:46] Every man's right in his own eyes. But
[1:30:47] God ponderth
[1:30:49] the heart.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; And you know what our prophet said about
[1:30:53] the heart? That's where the compassion
[1:30:54] and love dwelt. You know when you came
[1:30:57] out of God, you come out from his heart.
[1:30:59] You know when Eve come out of Adams, you
[1:31:01] come out from underneath the heart.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said that we are the heart
[1:31:06] of God.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:31:14] Amazing. Amen. You see, it's so easy to
[1:31:16] justify in place where we're at. Amen.
[1:31:19] Amen. God help us. Now, like I said, we
[1:31:23] can't you can't make people like you,
[1:31:26] but you can still be friendly to them.
[1:31:29] You can still hold the door and Amen. If
[1:31:32] somebody walks away from people walked
[1:31:34] away from Brother Brown's family because
[1:31:35] of his dad, he couldn't make them love
[1:31:38] him,
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; but he still showed them from his side
[1:31:42] love them back.
[1:31:44] Amen.
[1:31:46] Here in Proverbs 18, and and we we
[1:31:48] really are winding this down. Proverbs
[1:31:51] 18, he said, "A man that has friends
[1:31:54] must show himself friendly."
[1:31:58] And there is a friend that stickketh
[1:32:00] closer than a brother.
[1:32:03] You know, if you if you want to be a
[1:32:05] part of God's family and and you want to
[1:32:07] be involved, you just press into it.
[1:32:10] Press into the people. You know, I I
[1:32:12] I'll confess this. When we went to Paula
[1:32:14] Fontaine's church, we'd been gone a long
[1:32:16] time. We'd been gone 5 days. I was kind
[1:32:19] of done with being gone.
[1:32:22] And we came that close to not going. And
[1:32:26] you know, you know what? Just tip there
[1:32:28] was the last straw to tip the camel's
[1:32:29] back. The man said, "Well, I've never
[1:32:30] been to the church."
[1:32:33] I said, "Oh, okay. Well, that's good."
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; But see, if you want friends,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; you have to be friendly.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. push it. Invite people over. Go to
[1:32:45] their house. Go. Don't go uncalled. If
[1:32:48] you're not welcome, just leave.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; God, watch. God help us.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; I want to read my last quote and we'll
[1:33:01] close on this. He said a whole lot.
[1:33:03] That's the very last one on the thing,
[1:33:05] Vicki. I got it marked. I'm not going to
[1:33:07] read it, but I'm going to read it
[1:33:08] anyway.
[1:33:10] He said when Mary and Elizabeth seen
[1:33:12] Mary come, when Elizabeth met Mary and
[1:33:15] seen her coming, he said no doubt they
[1:33:17] both I think I mentioned some of this
[1:33:19] before they both mention and they rung
[1:33:21] and hug each other like women used to do
[1:33:24] and they greet each other and friendly
[1:33:26] smile. But he said he said I'll tell you
[1:33:28] what's a whole lot the matter with
[1:33:29] people today. He said they're not
[1:33:32] friendly like that like they used to be
[1:33:34] because people got too much selfish
[1:33:38] selflove.
[1:33:42] He said we got to the place where they
[1:33:45] think they live in their own little
[1:33:47] world of the self of self-love. Amen. He
[1:33:50] talked about self-love in in the Leoian
[1:33:54] church age.
[1:33:56] Amen.
[1:33:58] But you know he he told us that
[1:34:00] Christianity was living for others
[1:34:04] that I'm not saying you have to take
[1:34:05] care of your own family and I'm not
[1:34:07] saying you know I'm not competing for
[1:34:10] money for other people poor people that
[1:34:12] that has nothing to do with me. That's
[1:34:14] between you and God. And you would be
[1:34:17] unwise if you didn't take care of your
[1:34:18] own family first. You have to take care
[1:34:21] of your own family first. A man that
[1:34:23] don't provide for his family is worse
[1:34:24] than an infidel. But compassion is
[1:34:27] eternal life. Eternal life is living for
[1:34:30] others.
[1:34:32] And do you even care?
[1:34:34] And the real way to pray for somebody,
[1:34:36] the way our prophet could pray for
[1:34:38] somebody is he would put himself
[1:34:41] in those people's shoes. The reason the
[1:34:44] blind man got his sight from Mexico was
[1:34:47] cuz brother Brandham was comparing him
[1:34:50] to his daddy.
[1:34:53] And if one of you brothers come up and I
[1:34:55] compared you to my daddy,
[1:34:57] you'd get healed, too.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Because I love my daddy.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; I tell you, even for for not just as a
[1:35:07] church and us believers and how we go
[1:35:10] and fellowship with other churches, I I
[1:35:13] want to tell you what, you you have all
[1:35:15] the freedom that the Holy Ghost has
[1:35:16] given you. You fellowship where God
[1:35:19] leads you to fellowship and and visit
[1:35:21] and and you know, I mean, you might call
[1:35:23] this home, but you're not under chains
[1:35:25] and balls and slavery. Amen. The Holy
[1:35:28] Ghost is your guidance. Amen. And and
[1:35:31] when you go there, just even if there's
[1:35:33] something you can you can eat the whole
[1:35:35] loaf of bread and just spit out one pit,
[1:35:37] but show yourself friendly. Don't try to
[1:35:39] Don't tell them you're spitting out a
[1:35:41] pit. Don't even bring it up.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Don't even bring it up.
[1:35:46] Just eat the pie. It'll still be good.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just eat the pie. Amen.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; But I want to even bring it down closer
[1:35:54] into our individual homes. If us parents
[1:35:57] would understand what our kids are going
[1:35:59] through or your grandkids are going
[1:36:02] through,
[1:36:03] you might change. I'm not saying
[1:36:05] compromise. I'm not saying I'm not
[1:36:07] promoting sin or that, but I'm saying or
[1:36:10] try to remember when you were there and
[1:36:12] it's a lot worse now.
[1:36:16] Brother Paul De Fontaine, they just had
[1:36:17] a youth camp in the states. I think in
[1:36:19] North Carolina, there was 400 youth
[1:36:21] there. He was talking about what the
[1:36:23] youth are in, you know, can be involved
[1:36:26] in today compared to when he was a
[1:36:28] youth.
[1:36:30] Satan is real.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it'll be your love to the ones
[1:36:36] that are struggling and compassion
[1:36:38] that's going to help bring them along.
[1:36:40] It's going to bring them into maturity.
[1:36:42] for your love and guidance. Say, you
[1:36:44] know,
[1:36:47] not not compromising with the sin, but
[1:36:50] saying, you know, you can do better. You
[1:36:52] can make it.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can make it by God's grace.
[1:36:57] Amen.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; But it it it changes everything.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; You know, around the atmosphere of the
[1:37:07] Holy Ghost,
[1:37:09] there's no friction.
[1:37:12] There's absolutely around your family
[1:37:15] home with this compassion and love.
[1:37:19] Everybody wants to come to your place
[1:37:22] because there's no friction around the
[1:37:23] church. Everybody will want to visit
[1:37:26] here because it's just like what? And
[1:37:30] then when you go out to a a restaurant
[1:37:34] bar because all the other places are
[1:37:35] closed,
[1:37:40] all the world will know that you just
[1:37:43] walked out of a church service where the
[1:37:45] atmosphere was a lot different. You
[1:37:48] know, those people might never be able
[1:37:50] to,
[1:37:52] you know, brother Brandham, I I'm I'm
[1:37:53] trying to close. You know, Brother
[1:37:55] Brennham had people in his ministry in
[1:38:00] charge of the tapes
[1:38:03] that not one of us would vote in favor
[1:38:04] of.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; They had a sinful life.
[1:38:10] And Brother Bram's words were, "This is
[1:38:14] the closest to the Holy Ghost
[1:38:17] they'll ever get."
[1:38:21] Maybe some I pray not, but maybe some of
[1:38:24] those people in that restaurant bar
[1:38:26] where we went to get because we hadn't
[1:38:28] ate since breakfast and it was 9:00 at
[1:38:31] night. That might have been the closest
[1:38:33] they'll ever get to that atmosphere.
[1:38:37] Unless God changes their heart.
[1:38:40] When you look at it like that,
[1:38:42] would I want those people in hell? No.
[1:38:45] God God God didn't even make hell
[1:38:50] for us the people. He never even made
[1:38:52] hell for the sinners.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; It was made for the devil and his
[1:38:56] angels.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; And and and I am going to close on this.
[1:38:59] Brother Bam said if you go there, you're
[1:39:01] going to pass every roadblock and every
[1:39:04] sign says deter
[1:39:07] and blunt right in to eternal damn or to
[1:39:11] to damnation. not eternal but damnation
[1:39:14] because he didn't want nobody to go
[1:39:16] there. And if you came from him, you'll
[1:39:20] have the same spirit on you.
[1:39:24] You'll have the same spirit on you.
[1:39:29] I I I just I like that thought of that
[1:39:31] sign. I didn't It It just is fresh
[1:39:34] today. But we live simply
[1:39:38] so others can simply live.
[1:39:42] How even think of eternal life like that
[1:39:44] way? I live your spiritual life simply
[1:39:47] so others will catch the vision
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; and they'll go with you.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:06] Would it be all right if we sing our new
[1:40:07] song again?
[1:40:11] Wow. I just thought it was just so good.
[1:40:13] Let's sing that song that we sang. This
[1:40:15] world is falling apart.
[1:40:22] You know, these words really spoke to me
[1:40:24] because this is actually happening right
[1:40:27] underneath our feet.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Our houses are being deualed.
[1:40:31] Our dollar is being deualed. [music]
[1:40:34] We have no hope here at all.
[1:40:39] But when you have Christ, you can say
[1:40:42] goodbye to all your riches because we're
[1:40:44] not living. We're just was on a holiday.
[1:40:47] [music] This holiday is going to come to
[1:40:48] an end really soon. And we're going to
[1:40:51] go to paradise [music]
[1:40:52] to heaven to a much the millennium much
[1:40:56] greater place. Amen.
[1:40:58] Amen. [music]
[1:41:00] While living below, everywhere that I
[1:41:05] go, this world's full world of trouble
[1:41:09] and pain.
[1:41:11] There's murder and crime. This [music]
[1:41:15] is the end time. Everyone is going
[1:41:20] insane.
[1:41:22] But I found a release. And my heart is
[1:41:26] at [music and singing] peace with the
[1:41:28] word of the hour struggle.
[1:41:33] with the troubles onto my anger.

[1:45:07] this. He said, "When love was protected,
