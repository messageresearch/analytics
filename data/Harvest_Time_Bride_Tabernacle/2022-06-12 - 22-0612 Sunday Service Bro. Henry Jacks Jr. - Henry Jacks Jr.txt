how you know the the wife had just got blessed and they'd had a prayer line and she'd got slayed in the spirit and she was unable to go in the prayer line because she had her own prayer line on the side you know god knows everything he knows everything his brother had just delivered a car dropped it off for him so he have a vehicle the next day they said how many people drop off a vehicle and no

yesterday the spirit revealed to me hallelujah that i must preach my next message must be must be a marriage of the lamb the marriage of the lamb hallelujah praise god and also the benefits of marriage don't you know that there are benefits that comes with marriage oh jesus hallelujah you know i think it was last week or the other week brother dale i was at work and i was meditating upon the lord and the spirit said to me many believe this message many believe this message but they're not staying in the presence of the supernatural and when that struck my heart i said my god many believe in this message but then but they are not staying in the presence of the supernatural hallelujah lord believe in god but lord never stay in the presence of the supernatural the bible said abraham did that's why god revealed revelation to abraham when you stay in the presence of the supernatural god is obligated to give you revelation hallelujah and when you receive revelation you cannot leave you cannot leave the presence of god you're gonna leave the presence of the supernatural oh god oh my god god is real hallelujah stay in the presence of the supernatural jesus said to peter hallelujah upon this revelation upon this revelation i'm going to build my church hallelujah and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it the gates are there cannot prevail against the revelation because revelation is power and the devil is afraid of revelation because it is power amen praise the lord we start we started i started thought here i just want to finish it the unity of the fate hallelujah ephesians chapter 4 verse 11. but look at verse let's read verse 7 first but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ notice that every one of us it is given grace according hallelujah according to our know no according to who we are no according to the gift hallelujah according to the gift of christ praise god hallelujah wherefore he said when he ascended up an eye he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men praise god i like that hallelujah amen verse verse 11 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers no you're gonna look at verse 12 for the perfecting because god is a god of perfection and the word perfected means complete hallelujah for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry because you are given a ministry hallelujah for the edifying which is the building the construction of the body because the body is under construction it is the holy ghost that are present here with us that are constructing the body of christ hallelujah amen praise god till we all come that now hallelujah do we all come in glory no till we are reaching the rapture no hallelujah do we all come in the unity of the faith rich the faith here in the unity of the faith it is speaking of the maturity your maturity hallelujah oh praise god and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man look at the word perfect again complete you are fully grown you're fully mature you can be seated hallelujah we ask the lord to have his blessing to his word hallelujah till we all come in the unity of the faith the last time hallelujah we mentioned by the spirit hallelujah that the faith here that brother paul was speaking about was not the faith in first corinthians 13 first corinthians 12. hallelujah it is not that faith glory nor nor your faith that is your personal belief of something hallelujah just to do a little bit backtrack so that we can come to an understanding hallelujah the faith here that that brother paul was speaking about was the righteousness of god which is the spirit of god which is the holy ghost brother paul said to them god revealed that faith to abraham hallelujah no wonder why we said it earlier that abraham had stayed in the presence of the supernatural so that's why he was able to get revelation hallelujah that's why abraham he could express hallelujah the mercy seat of god when god came down and abraham said lord are you going to destroy the righteous with the wicked oh my god god said can i hide anything from my friend abraham hallelujah i tell you when you stay in the presence of the supernatural you are of god god is obligated to reveal his secrets to you hallelujah oh praise god but when you are not afraid of god he will not reveal his secret still but when god when you and god are friends god has to reveal his plan god has to reveal his secrets to you because he trusts you hallelujah because we are because we are friends if me and your friend i'm gonna trust you hallelujah oh glory to god hallelujah because our relationship oh hallelujah we have a good relationship hallelujah and here god's abraham said are you going to destroy the righteous with the wicked god intention that he was going to destroy sodom and gomorrah even remember that lot was down here hallelujah it's a lord i know that is not that that is nothing new to destroy the righteous with the wicked he said if you find 50 will you not save the city if you find 45 will it not save the city if you're flying 35 will they not save the city and they come down to five hallelujah and god hallelujah he brings a lot from out of sodom and gomorrah with lot and his two daughters his wife was supposed to come out but she turned back and look back hallelujah of the things of sodom and gomorrow when you're going forward keep going forward do not look back that's why brother paul said i press toward the mark of the price because the mark of the price of that calling of god is before me and that's the direction i'm going i'm pressing hallelujah toward the mark of the price and when i'm not when i'm pressing i'm not looking back all behind me are distractions and that's what brother paul is saying till we all come in the unity of the faith hallelujah to welcome in the unity of the faith and that unity of the faith is talking about your maturity hallelujah you must attain it you must arise at your completion hallelujah because without christ you're not completed what is the purpose hallelujah of the holy ghost the purpose of the holy ghost is is to express christ hallelujah jesus hallelujah is he was the body he was the body hallelujah of the living god god was dwelling in that body hallelujah to reveal himself hallelujah before god came into a body man could not touch god hallelujah man could not see god because the word of god should normally see god and live hallelujah one time moses said lord show me your glory god said if i show you hallelujah you're going to die well you know what i'm going to reveal my glory to you hallelujah he said come upon a rock and the word of god said when moses turned up on the rock god went before when god passed moses and put his hands over moses moses could not see his front part and then when god moved past remove his hands all moses could see was his back and moses said his back was like the back part of a man hallelujah hallelujah but god hallelujah came into our body one day hallelujah and that body was called jesus christ so that he could become tangible so that you can touch him so that you can see him hallelujah oh praise god and here today can i say this he's in a body again hallelujah we can see him and we can touch him i said when i see you i see christ when i touch you i touch christ oh praise god when you receive the spirit of god hallelujah i'm not looking at brother churchill i'm looking at christ hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah be so that we can touch him again no wonder why the prophet said he said when i you know when i see christ i just look at the people one time jesus said to say said to saul it says saw saul why has no protest persecuted me persecuted you i thought i was persecuted in the church hallelujah jesus said you persecute me because my spirit is in them i am intent hallelujah in saint john 14 19 to 20 at that day you shall know that i am in the father and the father in me hallelujah oh praise god the purpose of the holy ghost is to express is to express christ hallelujah is to express its characteristics what is his characteristics grace mercy peace joy love hallelujah faith temperance brotherly kindness these are his characteristics hallelujah so when you receive the holy ghost you are you're you are hallelujah you're here to express his characteristics all that was in god he poured into christ and all that was into christ he poured into his church hallelujah i'm not looking at the church i'm looking at christ holy where is the mercy today the mercy is in his people where is his joy today is joy is in the body where is his peace today this piece is in our body where is the love of god today it is in his people it must be in his people hallelujah and the love of god covers all multitude of sins oh praise god hallelujah when it comes to the love of god there's no boundary there's no limit hallelujah sometimes people can reach to a point where the day that they are in hell hallelujah but once you're in the spirit of god there is no boundary there's no dimension can stop you hallelujah david said if i should take a ship and go to the autonomous most part of the earth he's there with me if i die and go to hell they steer with me there's no bungie can stop the spirit of god in the book of revelation when john said when i saw the book open he said every man in heaven and in the church and in the sea and under the earth hear me saying john was listing the dimensions hallelujah he said man that are in the sea heard me hallelujah because it was a dimension man under the earth hear me when you're in the spirit of god there's no dimension can stop you oh praise god the spirit of god move in every dimension oh praise god when you understand visions hallelujah and you go to places you don't go to places in the party you go to places in the spirit hallelujah brother brother paul said i was caught up in the third heaven hallelujah because it's spirit hallelujah bringing up into that dimension oh praise god no wonder why but the paul said a door was set before me and hope and door hallelujah what is that open door the open door is jesus christ in the book of revelation 4 john said hallelujah the voice said come up higher john he said hallelujah immediately i was in the spirit and the door was hoping hallelujah and jesus said in saint john 10 i am the door i am the door what is the purpose of a door hallelujah a door has been put on a building hallelujah to close and to open hallelujah so if you want to go into this church how do you have to go through the door mean you have to ask it's an entrance it's access hallelujah oh praise god and we have a door today and the door is the spirit of god hallelujah oh praise god the door it is the spirit of god for what to get in the revelation to go high in the revelation of god hallelujah oh praise god can i say this when the tabernacle in the old testament was building what was bill hallelujah there the outer court and the inner court and the holy of all is three different sections three different parts in the holy of holies there was a curtain that parted it in order for you to go through the holy of holies you have to you have to open the curtain to go through but no man can go through it except you are the priests hallelujah and in the inner court hallelujah there were incense burning and the priests would take up their incense it is called the prayer of saints and they would bring it into the holy of holies hallelujah and jesus was a priest of god hallelujah and the saints the prayer of saints hallelujah when jesus he took the prayer of saints and went into the holy of holies and then when he was crucified and he's resurrected and sent back his spirit he sent back his spirit upon the body upon his people so that they can become the priests of god oh jesus in the book of revelation one verse five john said you have made us kings and priests hallelujah so now it is our responsibility to take the prayer of saints and step into the holy of holies hallelujah somebody's praying for you you're not alone sometimes when you feel weak hallelujah somebody is bringing your prayer before god there is a priest god of a priesthood up on the edge hallelujah oh praise god and they are went and they are stepping into the holiest of holies and offered before god upon the mercy sheet of altar of god oh jesus hallelujah the holy ghost is to express its characteristics hallelujah we're here to express its characteristics can i say this the rapture was not made for the bride the bride was made for the rapture oh praise god hallelujah god made a moses for the people hallelujah oh praise god hallelujah when mo when moses was there god said moses i want you to go down to egypt because my people stoned here god made a moses for his people because the people of god was before moses hallelujah that's why jesus had to say to them this man was made for the sabbath it was a sabbath for man hallelujah amen and as we said the last time when god the bible said he rested his works hallelujah all this works on the sixth day but on the seventh day he sanctify it the seventh day is sanctified for in hit he rested many people believe that seventh day today is speaking of sunday can a person rest inside a sunday you cannot rest it is oh my god you can't rest inside a sunday the bible said he sanctify it for in hit arrested the word in means inside you're looking at this can you can you sit down inside of this no you sit down on it isn't that right amen hallelujah so the word of god said is sanctified for in heat he rested clearly hallelujah that sabbat that day he was speaking of the image his image that was man hallelujah god step in that image hallelujah that was called adam hallelujah oh glory it was god now rested in his image for his image to continue the work of god oh praise god that's why mark 11 verse 28 said jesus said come unto me all that labor on our heavy lady and i will give you rest in other words i will give you what because the word sabbah means rest you understand hey amen hallelujah and that's the word of god brother jude his right name was actually was actually called judas but the writer didn't mention him as judas he mentioned him as jude actually there are six there are six judas in the bible hallelujah so the writer wanted to differentiate between him and judas iscariot hallelujah but jude was also the brother of james and james was the elder of the church in jerusalem hallelujah and jude and james was also the half-brother of jesus when jude wrote the letter in the book of jude he did not refer to himself as the brother of jesus he said i am a born servant i am a servant of jesus he was showing his humility hallelujah before the resurrection of jesus they did not believe in jesus jude and james did not believe in jesus it was after the resurrection of jesus they believed hallelujah and jude said in his letter he said i earnestly for the faith oh jesus hallelujah is a content for the faith the word content it means to stand for it means to block the faith hallelujah he said you must stand for the faith what was the faith that jude was speaking about hallelujah we must get back to what jude was speaking about because at that day hallelujah there was a spirit up there of error hallelujah that was sweeping its way against the truth against the gospel of christ and jude said you must contend for the spirit of truth jesus said i am the truth the way and the life the church is the truth the church is the way the church is the life hallelujah oh glory to god all that was in god it poured into christ and all that was in christ import into the church hallelujah praise god so the church reaches the body of christ they are the way hallelujah if you want to know the way to the father follow me brother paul made some strong arguments he said hallelujah follow me as i also follow christ brother paul said hallelujah if any man look at these strong arguments hallelujah if anyone preached any other gospel than this let him be a curse wow hallelujah brother paul if any man preached any other gospel this was a man hallelujah the way this arguments hallelujah it shows that he knows god hallelujah and god stands for him it's a no man can be established according to he says i establish your according to my gospel right my gospel when i look up that what does he mean by my gospel i thought the gospel was christ i thought it was christ but he was connected to christ he and christ become one so that's why i said according to my gospel hallelujah when a wife and a husband come together and they become one what belongs to the husband belongs to the wife hallelujah so that's why i can say today i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ because it is my gospel for it is the power unto salvation [Music] i'm not afraid hallelujah brother paul said oh glory to god he said no my i establish according to my gospel outside of this you can't be established thank god for the word thank god for the spirit of truth hallelujah it is your gospel the kingdom is yours it is a father's will to give you the kingdom whoa here is the father will to give you the kingdom hallelujah and the kingdom is the holy ghost brother paul said in romans 14 verse 17 for the kingdom of god is neither meat nor drink but it is righteousness in the holy ghost it is peace and it is joy it is the holy ghost jesus said colossians one brother paul said he have translated us out of darkness and deliver us into the kingdom of his dear son praise god hallelujah for the perfecting of the saints the sanctify one for the perfecting of the sanctified sanctify them father to thy word because thy word is truth hallelujah that is what we're dwelling on today it is truth when we're hearing truth we're being set apart the word sanctify means to sit apart that's why jesus before you leave he said albeit when he the spirit of truth is hallelujah and that's what brother jude was speaking about content for the faith the faith which is the spirit of truth hallelujah when he the spirit of truth come he shall guide you into all truth what is against the spirit of truth today really john religion is against the spirit of truth hallelujah people are doing so much things today hallelujah because of this because they use this and create religion and all the religion does it you just project hatred violence division hallelujah it doesn't produce it doesn't project peace it doesn't produce joy it doesn't produce love hallelujah but when christ came the spirit hallelujah of truth what it does it project peace joy love unity hallelujah praise god hallelujah and it also reveal to you who you are i am christ i am the son of god i come from god and i'm going back to god i know who i am hallelujah when you get the spirit the bible says the spirit spirit witness with our spirit that we are called the children of god that's a revelation and when that revelation struck your heart nothing can take it out of your heart hallelujah oh praise god you're not walking around again hallelujah walking i'm walking confused hallelujah you know we are calling you know your purpose hallelujah you know what is expected of you hallelujah i am called to do the work of god i am called to reveal my father's character when jesus said in the book of satan john 17 father i have manifested thy name before the man that you gave me out of this world hallelujah did you know that the name was also speaking of the character of the person when jesus said i have manifested thy name it means i have manifested thy character hallelujah oh praise god that's why jesus said i come in my father's name saying john 5 verse 3. i come in my father's name and you receive me hallelujah glory to god the bible said he sent the comforter in his name oh praise god we receive the holy ghost in the name of the father and the father name is the lord jesus christ revelation 14 john said i saw the injured and fought four thousand with the father's name in their forehead and the father's name was the name of jesus christ because jesus said it's in john 5 43 i come in my father's name and mark 1 verse 18 and this wise was the birth of jesus christ hallelujah what shall we do whatsoever we do in these action do it all in the name of jesus christ hallelujah hallelujah when a wife married get married to her husband she take on the husband name she take on the husband name my god you know what that means that signifies ownership ownership submissive she is now submissive hallelujah glory to god hallelujah the natural types it also means who i said ownership it also means kohiko it also means now you're ready to lead you're ready to lead with your husband ready to rule with your husband esther for example she was married to the king coming along to this esther was married to the king and she was put in a different part of the kingdom and the king was ruling from a different part in the kingdom so the play the room where the king was ruling was different from where esther was staying hallelujah but esther glory to god when she was preparing to get
