[29:20] struggle but she she has a struggle
[29:26] amen and God know knows and God has a
[29:29] reason and God has a plan amen
[29:33] amen
[29:35] amen amen well I promised you last
[29:37] Sunday that I preached two messages so
[29:40] I'd be really short this Sunday so
[29:42] whatever I don't get done I'm just going
[29:44] to use on Wednesday
[29:48] night amen but I I want to share some
[29:51] thought with you that uh I I'll just
[29:55] tell you right up front will be
[29:57] misunderstood
[29:59] but I I pray it isn't but brother Bram
[30:02] said that when he preached on this he
[30:04] said it wouldn't matter what I say on
[30:06] this topic you will misunderstand
[30:10] me it won't matter what I say it won't
[30:13] matter which way
[30:15] I but please don't do that brother Dale
[30:18] has no
[30:20] agenda I have less than zero desire to
[30:25] uh to control God's people or to give
[30:29] you advice that you don't agree with or
[30:31] even Doctrine amen and uh and I believe
[30:35] that we're free moral agents and you can
[30:38] make good decisions when you have the
[30:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost but I'm going
[30:43] to show you something that's in God's
[30:47] word and brother Brown preached it and
[30:50] I'm going to even read some scriptures
[30:51] if I don't get them today that I
[30:54] understand I and studying that they're
[30:56] met for multiple reasons and brother
[30:58] Brown said multiple times that all
[31:01] scripture and prophecy has got a
[31:03] compound meaning he said many times that
[31:05] it's circles around and around again or
[31:08] it's for different times and different
[31:10] years and many times in the Old
[31:11] Testament that the scripture is wrote
[31:14] from a from a Earthly or fleshly
[31:17] perspective but it meant for a spiritual
[31:20] perspective and then I would share a
[31:22] scripture if I get to it today that we
[31:24] know that Jesus come up and he meant it
[31:26] from a spiritual perspective from Israel
[31:30] but it's wrote from a physical
[31:31] perspective for us today and you know we
[31:34] can uh I I'm sorry that it's just this
[31:37] way but you know we can preach on the
[31:39] Seven Seals and we have and we could
[31:42] preach on the two prophets that are
[31:44] going to come to Israel and God will
[31:46] turn his eyes to Israel Grace will then
[31:48] end at that time we will go in a Rapture
[31:51] Grace will not end until the bride is
[31:53] gone in a Rapture and God turns his
[31:56] attentions to the Jews and we can talk
[31:58] about all those things and they're true
[32:00] and we should talk about them but many
[32:02] of those things for the young kids and
[32:04] the young people in school will do
[32:06] absolutely nothing to change their life
[32:08] or help them live a Christian Life I
[32:10] mean it it's the mysteries of life and
[32:12] they're true and they're real and
[32:13] they're amazing and there's something
[32:15] that you need to know but if we dwelt on
[32:18] them and I would feel sorry for anybody
[32:19] that has a pastor that all they preach
[32:21] on is the mysteries in the word of God
[32:24] and these things because
[32:26] uh uh
[32:28] there's just uh more in God's word than
[32:32] these things amen and so please
[32:38] again th this is is is not this is
[32:41] however you feel it's for you but it's
[32:44] not brother Dale cramming this down your
[32:45] throat but we have a
[32:48] problem and we've had a problem and
[32:52] Vicky you can put out my first picture
[32:53] but make sure you do the right one amen
[32:57] we had a problem in the
[32:59] past of
[33:03] slavery and we still have that
[33:06] problem
[33:08] today and and many Christians are being
[33:11] mocked by Satan because of the simple
[33:15] principles that God has in his
[33:18] word amen
[33:21] now we we just uh I I like I said I'm
[33:25] going to promise I'm going to go slow
[33:26] with this and uh
[33:29] and if we don't finish we will we'll
[33:32] pick it up when God allows but we
[33:34] recognize this kind of slavery very
[33:39] easily very easily and and it's
[33:42] disgusting from every angle
[33:46] amen but sitting in the bride of
[33:49] Christ is the same similar type of
[33:54] slavery and Satan has pulled over us and
[33:58] we've Justified oursel upside down to
[34:01] justify
[34:03] it and we've been
[34:05] wrong and i' I I got some amazing things
[34:10] that God's dealt with me and I I was
[34:12] even sharing this with ministers around
[34:14] the
[34:16] world and some of the ministers said he
[34:19] said I've never seen those things that
[34:20] brother Brown said never you know we'll
[34:24] justify the ministry or we'll justif we
[34:27] can just ify anything in the word of God
[34:29] we'll say oh God's behind us and praise
[34:31] God you know I can do
[34:34] it be careful be careful cuz you could
[34:38] be going down a path that God's not
[34:40] behind at
[34:41] all amen and many times we're like balam
[34:44] in the Bible you know balum was you know
[34:48] he he sold his soul for money but he was
[34:51] God's anointed and and he had a problem
[34:54] with money and he knew that he was
[34:56] making mistakes and you'll read it in
[34:58] the chapters in Numbers 22 where balum
[35:01] even comes back and that's where God
[35:03] stops him on the road with the donkey
[35:05] and speaks through a
[35:07] donkey God forbid he would have to speak
[35:09] through a donkey today unless it was
[35:12] brother Dale but uh balam comes there
[35:16] and repents and says God I'm wrong like
[35:20] I mean it was black and white I'm wrong
[35:22] I've sinned and I'm going to change and
[35:24] he went right out the very next day and
[35:27] Contin you down the exact same sinful
[35:30] road that God had already showed him was
[35:34] wrong
[35:37] amen God help us to break the chains of
[35:41] the yolks that are binding us because
[35:45] you know everything in your physical
[35:47] life dictates how you can serve God
[35:53] spiritually let me resay that your
[35:57] physical
[35:58] environment Dix takes
[36:05] 100% your spiritual
[36:07] environment now you say oh no wait a
[36:10] minute I can put oh yeah just try being
[36:12] sick in the hospital on a coma and
[36:14] worship
[36:18] God
[36:22] uh-huh
[36:24] amen and I want to go into uh some
[36:27] examples brother Brown and show you a
[36:29] lot of of scriptures
[36:36] here but with this first
[36:39] scripture we'll see here that brother
[36:42] Brown said as he says I always tell
[36:44] young
[36:45] couples that happy happiness does not
[36:48] consist of the world's Goods that you
[36:53] own but how content you can be with the
[36:56] portion
[36:57] that's allotted to you and then that
[37:00] that exact same quote he gives the
[37:02] example he had young people that would
[37:04] come to him and they had absolutely
[37:09] nothing and it will shock you that
[37:11] brother Brown still married them you
[37:15] w guaranteed you w it I've heard
[37:19] ministers say you don't you have no
[37:20] right to get married until you have
[37:22] money you have support that's not what a
[37:24] prophet beli and he went to the people
[37:27] that mared that were so wealthy that
[37:29] their door knobs on their house were
[37:31] gold 14 karat
[37:33] gold and he went by and seen the poorest
[37:36] of the poor and the people that had the
[37:39] 14 karat gold
[37:40] doorknobs and he said I would rather be
[37:42] in the poor people's life than in the
[37:45] rich people's
[37:46] life amen now brother Bram says and I'm
[37:50] I'm I'm I'm I'm taking my time I'm
[37:52] clarifying this there's nothing wrong
[37:54] with being having money and I believe
[37:57] been being like The Ant and preparing
[37:59] for winter I believe like Solomon's wife
[38:02] that she was uh sold for winter time cuz
[38:06] you would freeze to death and we have to
[38:08] have a warm house and we have to have a
[38:10] roof to keep rain off our head and if
[38:13] you have lots of money in the bank
[38:15] praise God for it and that won't keep
[38:18] you out of Heaven as long as it ain't
[38:21] your God but I want you to recognize
[38:24] some things that Satan has pulled over
[38:26] on us
[38:28] and we've swallowed them Hook Line and
[38:32] Sinker he said about 25 years
[38:35] ago or around that fact that God showed
[38:39] me and I'm so glad I woke up to
[38:44] it that happiness doesn't
[38:47] consist of these Earthly Treasures but
[38:49] it consists of Eternal things that makes
[38:51] our soul happy
[38:55] amen and here let's just goool maybe uh
[38:58] uh maybe we can leave this uh well you
[39:00] can we'll maybe leave the picture if
[39:02] that's easy for you Vicki first John 25
[39:06] and 17 love not the world nor the things
[39:08] of the world and if any man love the
[39:11] world the love of God is not in him now
[39:15] we we know that scripture and we have it
[39:17] memorized
[39:19] sideways and and and we think of it
[39:22] spiritually
[39:23] speaking for all that is in the world
[39:27] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[39:29] eye and the pride of life is not of the
[39:34] father but is of the world and the world
[39:36] passes away and the lust thereof but he
[39:39] that doeth the will of
[39:41] God abides
[39:44] forever now
[39:58] I'm going to skip my Isaiah scripture
[40:00] and maybe come back to it Proverbs
[40:03] 22:1 and then we're going to change our
[40:05] picture Vicki Proverbs 22:1 a good name
[40:09] is rather to be chosen than great riches
[40:13] and loving
[40:15] favor rather than silver or gold now I'm
[40:19] going to tell you something you can have
[40:21] [Music]
[40:23] both you can have both so I'm not
[40:25] preaching against I I don't care if your
[40:27] house costs I mean amen I don't I'm
[40:31] driving a nice car brother Dale is
[40:32] driving a nice car and you can have a
[40:35] brother Dale might build his sweetheart
[40:37] a nice house someday nothing wrong with
[40:40] that that's not what I'm talking about
[40:43] I'm talking about a different angle
[40:45] watch this here but the rich rule over
[40:48] the
[40:49] poor and the
[40:50] borrower is a slave to the
[40:54] lender and you can do whatever you want
[40:56] to that
[40:57] scripture you can throw it in the
[41:01] garbage but it's in the word of God and
[41:03] brother Brown talked about it and Paul
[41:07] wrote it here and it there's many many
[41:09] script do you know I want to show you
[41:10] something do you know that there's more
[41:12] talked in the Bible about money and
[41:16] stewardship of money than there is
[41:18] salvation or the Holy
[41:26] Ghost that's a
[41:28] amazing
[41:33] amen God help
[41:35] us here let let me read another
[41:38] scripture VI you before we bring up
[41:39] Jeremiah 29:11 and4 for I know the
[41:42] thoughts that I think towards you now
[41:45] God gave his
[41:47] scripture for his for our obedience to
[41:50] what he pre-plan for us in our future I
[41:54] know the thoughts that I think towards
[41:55] you and this ain't just spiritual
[41:58] because then we wouldn't believe in
[41:59] Divine Healing but God give care about
[42:02] our healing amen and and see we're
[42:05] living in a world well let me finish
[42:07] this
[42:08] here the thoughts of peace and not of
[42:11] evil and to give you unexpected end and
[42:14] then you shall call upon me you
[42:16] shall you shall go and pray unto me and
[42:19] I will hearken unto you and you shall
[42:21] seek me and you shall find me and when
[42:24] you shall search with me with all your
[42:25] heart notice say
[42:27] says all your
[42:30] heart all the word of God you will find
[42:33] me sayith the Lord and I will turn away
[42:36] from your
[42:37] captivity now don't just think in the
[42:40] the sense of
[42:43] soldiers
[42:45] captivity and I will gather you from all
[42:48] the
[42:50] nations and from all the places hither I
[42:52] have driven you sayith the Lord and I
[42:54] will bring you again to the place hence
[42:57] and cause you when I cause thee to be
[43:01] carried away I know this is talking
[43:03] about
[43:04] Israel in a physical sense but remember
[43:08] our Prophet said multiple times about a
[43:10] dozen times or more that all scriptures
[43:13] and prophecy has compound meanings and I
[43:16] want to show you something that whether
[43:18] you admit it or not and I this ain't for
[43:20] some of these scriptures uh some of this
[43:22] thing we can't just preach to the older
[43:24] mature ones in the message all the time
[43:26] we got to hit H the the teenagers and
[43:28] the brother dalees because I'm just a
[43:30] teenager at heart and so this message is
[43:33] for
[43:34] me because people are building their
[43:37] lives you might be at the end of your
[43:40] life but there's other people just
[43:41] starting their life amen and we're
[43:44] living in a world where there has never
[43:46] ever in history been more mental
[43:51] illness in the
[43:55] churches don't worry about the world
[43:58] in the
[43:59] message and more
[44:03] depression inside a message
[44:07] churches amen now did God thoughts for
[44:11] you to be
[44:12] depressed how in the
[44:15] world you're you're the bride of Christ
[44:18] this morning so you have eternal life
[44:20] that's just facts you came from God he's
[44:23] the only person that was eternal and so
[44:25] that makes you Eternal you're
[44:27] and there's people in that state that
[44:30] would take medication for
[44:35] depression
[44:39] wow and almost 100% of the time it's
[44:44] because of
[44:45] slavery maybe not always but almost 100%
[44:48] of the time it's because of slavery do
[44:50] you know that the number one probably
[44:52] the dead number one cause of divorce
[44:57] in North
[44:59] America is based
[45:02] on money number
[45:05] one ahead of anything
[45:08] else even other
[45:13] things
[45:15] money you know brother Bram said and and
[45:18] if I scroll down to it I'll just
[45:19] paraphrase it I'll come to it I'll
[45:21] repeat it he said you're putting your
[45:23] hopes in a piece of paper that within 5
[45:26] years
[45:28] that was in the'
[45:30] 40s in 5 years it'll be worthless now
[45:33] now I know what you're thinking cuz
[45:34] Satan told me he said well brother Brown
[45:36] made a mistake no he
[45:38] didn't it's called
[45:42] inflation it's exactly worthless do you
[45:45] know that you can Google inflation by
[45:47] the Banks and it was the world's Bank
[45:51] plan to trick you to think that you're
[45:54] working for the same amount of money or
[45:56] more
[45:57] and you're actually working for
[46:00] nothing well that's what Google will
[46:03] tell you you don't have to believe your
[46:05] pastor and your Prophet said that 5
[46:07] years ago that would have been about 70
[46:09] years ago that what you're putting in
[46:11] your hopes now I'm not saying you
[46:15] are will be worth
[46:21] zero
[46:25] amen and
[46:27] I and this is everybody has to work out
[46:30] their own for their own uh household I'm
[46:33] not I'm not I'm not going there but I I
[46:36] don't believe it's wrong to
[46:39] money if you need to you have to have a
[46:41] house to live in so you're going to you
[46:43] you you can rent or borrow money for a
[46:46] house that's your
[46:48] choice brother Bram talked about paying
[46:50] your bills he said he said I don't mean
[46:52] owe no man Nothing by like don't have a
[46:55] hydro bill or don't have a water bill
[46:58] we're not talking about that you know
[47:00] you'd get thirsty if you didn't have
[47:01] water and you'd get blinded if you
[47:04] didn't have
[47:06] lights but what we're talking about is
[47:09] the love of the world that who has the
[47:12] most toys isn't who
[47:15] wins
[47:17] amen and and the
[47:20] toys are
[47:22] something that just are a trick to us
[47:25] and so you can pull up next preacher and
[47:27] I'll read a scripture he said here
[47:29] brother Brown's talking about money he
[47:31] said he said everything's paid up he
[47:33] said we never left the city owing a and
[47:37] he said everything was taken care of and
[47:38] he said I don't believe in anything else
[47:40] than that and he said you must you
[47:43] mustn't owe anyone he said you must be
[47:47] square and straight and you say owe no
[47:48] man nothing and go face to them and tell
[47:52] them that you owe them but you'll give
[47:54] them a little time and you'll pay it
[47:56] that's always better it's a mark of a
[47:58] good Christianity being honest and
[48:00] upright he said watch here stay close to
[48:03] Christ and he said let me warn you now
[48:06] and as a minister of the Gospel it don't
[48:09] take any foolishness don't imagine
[48:12] anything say right here United inside on
[48:16] the inside anchored in the word right in
[48:18] Christ because the only thing that's
[48:20] going
[48:22] to every is going to deceive this age
[48:25] that we're living in and if you're
[48:27] deceived it'll if it were possible it
[48:29] would be as close to the
[48:32] elect because they have the
[48:35] anointing and they can do anything like
[48:38] the rest of them now he's talking about
[48:40] people deceiving us so watch this he
[48:42] said now now this is our prophet he said
[48:44] now clean up your
[48:47] lives and pay your
[48:53] debt oh no man nothing
[48:57] Jesus said now I don't mean like your
[49:00] house rent and stuff you got to do
[49:03] that but he said get all these things
[49:06] off your hands he said get anything get
[49:10] everything right and make ready get
[49:12] ready remember that the name in the name
[49:14] of the Lord
[49:16] something is fixing to
[49:20] happen amen that's what our Prophet said
[49:23] see if we get so cluttered in our mind
[49:27] there's actually people that are
[49:29] are you can't help it that they're so
[49:32] involved with their families or their
[49:34] kids or their toys and stuff and we have
[49:37] an evil thing in this day and you can
[49:39] pull up the picture Vicki and and I have
[49:41] one so so you can throw stones at me
[49:45] too but there's modern-day slavery right
[49:48] there where you can go on your phone and
[49:51] you can call up Amazon and you can order
[49:52] something that you don't even want or
[49:55] need they know that they're you're even
[49:58] thinking about
[50:00] it and I I know I don't mean to offend
[50:03] anybody this morning and
[50:05] and but we're living in a world here
[50:08] where we have 50 pair of shoes you can't
[50:11] wear 50 pair of
[50:12] shoes and I have a separate closet from
[50:15] my wife cuz our clothes are still they
[50:17] won't
[50:19] fit and our closet bar is like 7 ft long
[50:27] yeah
[50:30] amen that's an
[50:34] addiction no
[50:37] no brother Dale's in an addiction in
[50:40] what kind of a world do you have to have
[50:43] I I couldn't even dream how many pair of
[50:44] shirts I would have
[50:47] hundreds how
[50:52] why amen you don't never used to be
[50:56] whereever advertisement was everywhere
[50:57] and it used to be that it was it when it
[50:59] came out into the World War II or after
[51:01] that it was on signs and you know you
[51:03] had to get the Sears catalog and it was
[51:05] on paper now you pick up your phone and
[51:07] you you could be doing anything and
[51:09] advertisement ads will come up and say
[51:11] buy me and if you don't buy me I'm half
[51:13] PR you're an
[51:16] idiot you say but I was just going for
[51:20] breakfast and now I'm into buying long
[51:23] johns hello
[51:27] yeah it's because Satan knows that if he
[51:30] overwhelm you notice that the the the
[51:32] the Bible scriptures don't pop up like
[51:35] that do you notice that quotes just
[51:37] don't pop up like
[51:39] that this is coming from Satan to
[51:42] bombard us with with things that we're
[51:44] not even W you weren't even thinking of
[51:47] buying a new
[51:49] hat which I love or you know what I'm
[51:54] saying and so instead of praying for
[51:58] your your kids or your wife or that now
[52:00] you're on Amazon or
[52:06] wherever because of these cards now I
[52:08] now listen now we live in a modern world
[52:10] and me and brother Carson couldn't cost
[52:12] a bridge without having a
[52:14] card and brother cars and I actually
[52:16] asked him to use his card because of
[52:18] personal reasons mine is ridiculous
[52:27] but I wonder if that's part of
[52:30] God's
[52:31] plan I'll show you it's
[52:34] not I'll show you that your Prophet said
[52:36] he told God he said multiple times this
[52:38] was the the quote I sent to other
[52:40] ministers you know brother Dale could go
[52:42] to the mission field and I have borrowed
[52:44] money on my line of credit by God's
[52:47] scriptures and the message I shouldn't
[52:53] go I'll say it for you
[52:57] ouch that was the ouch for
[53:00] me cuz brother Bram told God he said the
[53:04] day you sto paying the bills for my
[53:06] Ministry the day I stopped
[53:12] preaching and he also said you'll never
[53:16] talk about
[53:17] money or pull for
[53:21] it because see he believed that God was
[53:25] Supernatural
[53:27] and he believed that God could do
[53:28] anything and God owns the cattle on a
[53:30] thousand hills and you don't need a
[53:31] minister to tell you what to do with
[53:33] your money so that see I I already
[53:35] established that Foundation this morning
[53:37] I'm not telling you what to do with your
[53:38] money you have your own mind and you
[53:41] have your own Holy Ghost and you have to
[53:43] talk to God about
[53:45] that and if you have a minister that
[53:47] ever comes and tells you what to do with
[53:49] your money it'll almost always regard
[53:53] something that's self- serving and
[53:55] that's disgusting
[54:00] yeah
[54:03] amen and so watch this when I was
[54:06] dealing with so I was talking to
[54:07] ministers and I know this can I step out
[54:09] of the side let me go to the other side
[54:11] of the road for a minute I was talking
[54:12] to ministers around the world where they
[54:14] don't have much money and they were
[54:15] going to do things for God and I said do
[54:18] you have the money they said well no I
[54:20] said you're out of God's will like they
[54:22] almost wed the phone
[54:27] I said well like if you're in God's will
[54:28] God will pay all his own bills yeah
[54:30] whose kingdom are you working for see if
[54:33] I travel the world to say I'm
[54:35] ministering but I'm and I have a thirst
[54:36] for popularity I'll borrow the
[54:41] money oh that burns
[54:44] me am it burns a lot of other ministers
[54:49] too that's why you don't hear it
[54:54] preached so oh I'm a I'm a servant of
[54:57] God and the people and I'm
[55:01] I God has a
[55:04] standard God has a standard brother
[55:07] Braham said if you can't go yourself you
[55:09] could send somebody but you don't need
[55:10] to tell nobody who you're going to send
[55:12] or
[55:17] when the Bible clearly says that a
[55:20] servant's worthy of his labor so people
[55:21] that go around and labor for
[55:24] God and don't get a chicken or or a cob
[55:26] of corn or a potato or an
[55:31] egg or's something wrong with this
[55:33] picture now I know this is kindergarten
[55:35] for all of
[55:37] us but we got to get out of
[55:42] kindergarten because we have a slavery
[55:44] here you know I had a brother that that
[55:47] got me thinking of this months ago
[55:50] months ago and he was from
[55:53] Pakistan and I commented on this post
[55:56] and you can put up the next one Vick you
[55:57] had both of
[55:59] them
[56:00] and I commented on his post and he said
[56:03] brother Dale he said there's family
[56:08] Generations that are slaves in the big
[56:11] fact the brick
[56:13] Factory for like 10
[56:16] bucks 20
[56:19] bucks five
[56:22] bucks because interest interest in the
[56:26] Philippines when you plant your rice is
[56:30] 60%
[56:33] interest 60 that's six and then the
[56:40] zero God never ever intended for
[56:45] believers to be in this
[56:48] trap and that interest ain't going to
[56:50] God's
[56:52] kingdom it's going to the World Bank
[56:56] which will be part of the One World
[56:58] Government in
[56:59] Rome amen now listen now let's balance
[57:04] this if you didn't have a house mortgage
[57:06] you'd have to pay
[57:08] rent okay nothing wrong with that you
[57:11] you must have a house to live in period
[57:16] it in Canada because we're spread
[57:19] out it'd be hard to ride a bike to
[57:22] church brother Dale would not have a
[57:23] weight problem if I rode a bike to
[57:25] church
[57:26] and if I brought a pony it wouldn't have
[57:29] a weight problem
[57:31] either so I'm not talking about your
[57:34] needs but does do we remember the
[57:36] scripture says that I will supply your
[57:39] needs according to my
[57:42] riches and
[57:46] Glory so we buy our kids something and
[57:48] they play with the
[57:50] box and you're caught in a trap because
[57:52] you put it on your
[57:54] card yeah
[58:00] amen your kids don't love you no l they
[58:03] your kids could care less whether they
[58:05] got those new coold
[58:07] toys you think of what you older ones
[58:10] played with when you it wasn't it wasn't
[58:12] about new
[58:13] plastic when you when US 60 year- olds
[58:16] grew up we never grew up with a yard
[58:18] full of plastic
[58:20] no we had maple
[58:23] trees that our grandpa built that we
[58:26] climbed and we jumped off and broke our
[58:28] arms we had Bor twine that was thrown in
[58:32] the garbage that we braided ropes and
[58:34] tried to tie up the dog
[58:40] and and so we have Christians that come
[58:43] to
[58:44] church and they can't worship God CU
[58:47] they don't know how they're making their
[58:49] minimum payment on their credit
[58:50] card
[58:54] tomorrow tomorrow
[58:59] M amen God help
[59:13] us here can I finish this quote he said
[59:16] I'm going to the hills and he said it's
[59:18] not exactly to hunt squirrels because
[59:20] well I like to hunt squirrels but I'm
[59:22] going there for a purpose for this
[59:24] purpose saying God I don't know which
[59:27] way to
[59:28] move and I don't want to miss you help
[59:30] me and you pray for me and I'll do and I
[59:33] will that too I'll pray for you and I
[59:35] hope by God's mercy that we'll meet
[59:37] every one of us in that better land in
[59:40] heaven and that we'll be coming here and
[59:44] what we are doing and we're coming here
[59:46] that we're not playing games he's
[59:48] talking about coming to church that
[59:49] we're not playing games that are we
[59:52] coming here to meet in a lodge
[59:56] or is it Christ that came until the
[1:00:00] church it's Christ that can't come until
[1:00:04] the church is perfectly right and he's
[1:00:07] waiting on us and I believe this was in'
[1:00:10] 65 he said I believe then we're at the
[1:00:14] End Amen and like I said this is an
[1:00:18] individual thing but it it will it
[1:00:20] should it should if if this message
[1:00:22] don't do nothing else just consider and
[1:00:24] think about before you buy thing that
[1:00:26] wasn't even on your mind to
[1:00:29] buy does you know I bought something the
[1:00:31] other day I was in the secondhand store
[1:00:33] and I bought a bell and Lan said well
[1:00:35] that'll just be something else for the
[1:00:36] girls to
[1:00:37] dust you know lean grew up with menites
[1:00:40] in Indiana and she went in their houses
[1:00:41] and they're almost straight wood their
[1:00:43] houses and they have absolutely nothing
[1:00:47] in their
[1:00:49] house it will actually freak you out
[1:00:52] when you go in their house and it will
[1:00:55] outo be because they have nothing in
[1:00:58] their house I don't even believe they
[1:01:00] have curtains I don't believe they did
[1:01:01] oh they did have curtains okay they have
[1:01:03] not it's a barest looking thing you ever
[1:01:05] the most cluttered room was the kitchen
[1:01:08] cuz it had a table and chairs in the
[1:01:10] living room there might be one wooden
[1:01:12] bench they don't believe in soft cushion
[1:01:14] chairs because that's making it easy on
[1:01:17] your
[1:01:18] life and they'll have a grandfather
[1:01:22] clock and that's
[1:01:24] it they don't believe in
[1:01:27] pictures they won't have nothing
[1:01:32] soft there'll be nothing in the yard but
[1:01:34] the maple tree and the pony tied in the
[1:01:38] pasture the dog running
[1:01:42] around you say well we're way beyond
[1:01:45] that are
[1:01:47] we our Prophet talked about it God
[1:01:51] talked about it said the borrower is the
[1:01:53] slave to the lender said oh no man
[1:01:55] nothing
[1:01:57] it's not something you hear very
[1:02:00] often says you know give your shirt to
[1:02:03] you know you know in James it talks
[1:02:05] about if somebody comes you with a
[1:02:07] need watch this I'm going to I'm going
[1:02:10] to balance it this way if somebody comes
[1:02:12] to you with a need like they you know
[1:02:15] we're living in a different world
[1:02:16] because of the Internet it's very
[1:02:19] different there's not a day goes by that
[1:02:21] somebody don't ask me for money
[1:02:26] but the Bible says that if you know if
[1:02:28] you said now I'll pray for you and go in
[1:02:32] peace and they were starving to death
[1:02:34] and you had now this is a key part and
[1:02:37] you had the
[1:02:39] ability to give them something eat that
[1:02:43] would be
[1:02:45] wrong but if you are operating on
[1:02:47] borrowed money you're already in
[1:02:52] sin so I tell people when they ask me
[1:02:55] for money now because my wife is very
[1:02:57] very wise and is the balance of the the
[1:03:00] way scale I say I I haven't got all my
[1:03:03] own bills paid yet this
[1:03:05] month and I might have to borrow money
[1:03:08] to pay them
[1:03:09] so
[1:03:14] sorry man see that's not that's not out
[1:03:17] of order that's just that's Bible see
[1:03:21] you you don't give God never well God
[1:03:24] will never ask you to give something
[1:03:25] that first he didn't give it to you
[1:03:27] first more and abundantly more than you
[1:03:30] could even ask or think like if what you
[1:03:33] give God is beyond what you could even
[1:03:39] spend
[1:03:41] amen you know I want I want and and I I
[1:03:44] have a lot more scriptures a lot more
[1:03:46] quotes and I want to just hit a thing
[1:03:49] late and we're we're doing really good
[1:03:50] it's just 11:00 you know I want to show
[1:03:52] you
[1:03:53] something farmers generally owe a lot of
[1:03:56] money and if you're borrowing money to
[1:03:59] make money like you know if you're a
[1:04:01] truck driver you got to have a truck to
[1:04:03] drive hello a semi so like that's your
[1:04:07] that's your job so you're going to buy a
[1:04:09] semi and then drive it to make money
[1:04:13] that's called
[1:04:14] livelihood that's that's a
[1:04:16] necessity that's that's not I'm not
[1:04:19] talking about that like a farmer if a
[1:04:21] farmer don't have a farm he's not a
[1:04:23] farmer
[1:04:25] I'm talking about the other
[1:04:27] stuff that's a clutter in your
[1:04:32] life
[1:04:35] amen and if we get rid of all the
[1:04:37] Clutter that that we're paying interest
[1:04:40] on I I want to just show you something
[1:04:42] example when I bought the farm that we
[1:04:44] started the House Church in right north
[1:04:46] of
[1:04:47] me Interest was 99.3% interest when I
[1:04:51] bought it and that was so cheap then no
[1:04:54] that was before Esther was born so that
[1:04:55] was before there was wheels and uh that
[1:04:59] was so cheap that I locked it in for 5
[1:05:01] years terrible
[1:05:04] mistake yeah so cheap I locked it in for
[1:05:06] 5 years and you know when I made my
[1:05:08] first Farm payment I I'm just I'm I know
[1:05:11] I'm jarring you but and you don't you
[1:05:13] can just throw this in the thing I pray
[1:05:16] you don't say I was a waste of money
[1:05:17] coming to church this morning cuz I hope
[1:05:19] I give you enough scripture already for
[1:05:21] that but I made my first Farm credit
[1:05:23] payment and it was 33,000
[1:05:27] and you wouldn't believe how I sweat to
[1:05:29] make
[1:05:31] that CU Esther wasn't
[1:05:34] born tells you how old my kids
[1:05:36] were and I paid less than 3,000
[1:05:44] principal and when I got the Sleep
[1:05:47] the sheet and I seen that I almost
[1:05:49] vomited
[1:05:56] I did all that
[1:05:58] struggle to feed the
[1:06:01] devil I I'm talking about myself brother
[1:06:04] Dale I'm not I that's entirely up to you
[1:06:07] where you go with
[1:06:08] that you see what I mean and so there's
[1:06:12] times now I'm getting a little bit
[1:06:14] whiter around the ears there's times I
[1:06:17] say you
[1:06:18] know I don't need that struggle I like
[1:06:21] staying in the living
[1:06:23] room studying the message
[1:06:27] CU if there ain't a profit to it and a
[1:06:32] need why are
[1:06:36] we
[1:06:40] uhhuh 1 Timothy 63 and 10 if any mind
[1:06:45] teach you otherwise
[1:06:48] consist consist not to Wholesome words
[1:06:51] even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:55] and to the doctrine which is according
[1:06:57] to Godliness 1 Timothy 6 3 and starting
[1:07:02] at four
[1:07:03] now he is proud knowing nothing but doth
[1:07:08] about questions and strife and words
[1:07:09] thereof cometh envy and strife railings
[1:07:12] and
[1:07:15] evil verse
[1:07:17] five disputings of men and corrupt minds
[1:07:20] and all these things the truth supposing
[1:07:24] that gain yeah
[1:07:27] yeah now now you can say I'm right out
[1:07:30] to lunch but this is the
[1:07:33] Bible and Paul wrote
[1:07:37] this but gain is
[1:07:40] godliness for such withdraw
[1:07:48] yourself so I I don't believe that
[1:07:51] that's just boring we're Way Beyond that
[1:07:53] we have the Mysteries this is is a
[1:07:57] mystery this is a mystery and if you
[1:08:00] don't believe it you don't even believe
[1:08:01] the word of
[1:08:05] God withdraw thyself but godliness with
[1:08:10] contentment is great
[1:08:12] gain and for we brought nothing into the
[1:08:15] world and it is certain that you ain't
[1:08:17] carrying nothing out having food and
[1:08:19] rign and let us therewith be
[1:08:22] content oh I don't like service is like
[1:08:25] today neither do I I had something a lot
[1:08:28] more happy to preach you know I had a
[1:08:30] minister from another
[1:08:33] country and he had listened to one of
[1:08:35] our
[1:08:37] CDs and he said brother Dale I'm not
[1:08:40] going to tell you who it is I'm not even
[1:08:42] going to tell you if you asked
[1:08:44] me brother Dale he said that should be
[1:08:46] preached in every message
[1:08:48] church but he said they'll never ask you
[1:08:51] because you're not
[1:08:53] popular and you didn't make the people
[1:08:55] people
[1:08:57] happy you didn't preach to people happy
[1:09:00] we only invite people that preach you
[1:09:02] happy if if we preach me happy then then
[1:09:05] I'm all excited the offering is way
[1:09:07] bigger that's completely God's see but
[1:09:10] are are like are we mature
[1:09:13] adults
[1:09:16] amen but
[1:09:20] Godly for we buy nothing into this world
[1:09:22] and is certain we're going to carry
[1:09:23] nothing out having food and rment there
[1:09:25] was be content but
[1:09:28] they that will be rich fall into
[1:09:31] Temptations and a snare onto many
[1:09:35] foolish and hurtful lusts which drown a
[1:09:39] man in
[1:09:44] destruction that's a fairly serious
[1:09:47] thing now I don't know for any of you
[1:09:49] said no but I I trap foxes with my
[1:09:52] brother Allan from a snowmobile and a
[1:09:54] snare does any everybody know what a
[1:09:55] snare is it's like a trap but you can't
[1:09:59] see
[1:10:00] it it's the smallest piece of wire there
[1:10:03] is and it's a cable and it's got a
[1:10:05] one-way slip thing and so when an animal
[1:10:08] goes in it it won't release but when it
[1:10:11] goes in it it never seen
[1:10:13] it I don't care if it was an eagle it
[1:10:16] never seen it that's what the definition
[1:10:18] of a snare it's invisible because it's
[1:10:21] put like in a fence or in a weeded area
[1:10:24] where looks like
[1:10:26] the
[1:10:29] surroundings but it's a
[1:10:32] trap
[1:10:36] unawares
[1:10:37] amen now we know there's no problem we
[1:10:40] already clarified that you know you need
[1:10:42] a house and a vehicle for the love of
[1:10:43] money is the root of all evil which some
[1:10:47] have converted after and they have AED
[1:10:50] from the faith and pierced themselves
[1:10:52] through with many Sorrows now we're not
[1:10:54] talking I don't believe believe that
[1:10:56] that like having a job and preparing and
[1:10:59] preparing for old age that's not the
[1:11:00] love of money that's just I mean you'd
[1:11:03] be foolishness to balance this out the
[1:11:05] Bible says a man that don't prepare or
[1:11:07] or Supply the needs of his family is
[1:11:09] worse than a fool an Infidel so I'm not
[1:11:11] talking about
[1:11:14] that I'm talking
[1:11:17] about being
[1:11:19] content to not stress out and putting
[1:11:24] your emphasis on God watch this here
[1:11:25] brother Brown said he said the move of
[1:11:28] God's spirit is not by the amount of
[1:11:30] money or this I love our Prophet or
[1:11:34] talent in the
[1:11:36] church the move of God's spirit Hol
[1:11:40] spirit is not based on the amount of
[1:11:42] money in the church or the amount of
[1:11:46] talent that people are that have that
[1:11:49] are in the church amen amen Romans 131
[1:11:55] and two and then we're going to jump to
[1:11:56] 8 and six and I'll I'll tell you when we
[1:11:58] do let every soul be subject to the
[1:11:59] higher powers and therefore there is no
[1:12:02] power but god the powers that are
[1:12:05] ordained of God whosoever whosoever
[1:12:09] therefore resisteth the power resisteth
[1:12:12] the ordinance of God and they that
[1:12:16] resist it shall receive thems damnation
[1:12:19] so I'm showing you what's wrote right in
[1:12:21] God's word
[1:12:25] you might want to consider it don't
[1:12:28] matter to me what you do with
[1:12:30] it verse six for this cause pay ye
[1:12:35] tribute also for they are God's
[1:12:37] ministers attending continually upon
[1:12:40] this very thing in verse 7 render
[1:12:42] therefore to all their dues and tribute
[1:12:45] to them their dues and their Customs to
[1:12:48] customs and fear to whom fear and honor
[1:12:51] to whom is honor but verse eight is the
[1:12:54] one that I highlighted
[1:12:56] oh no man
[1:12:58] nothing oh no man anything but love one
[1:13:02] another for he that loveth another
[1:13:06] fulfill the
[1:13:08] law amen now we know that the prophet n
[1:13:11] mentioned some things about this he said
[1:13:16] now I'm just going to mention some
[1:13:18] quotes that he mentioned from that
[1:13:20] scripture he said now I was laying here
[1:13:21] and he said he came in he came into the
[1:13:23] service and he's preaching a different
[1:13:24] message
[1:13:25] and he
[1:13:27] said there's been many
[1:13:29] requests this week on what I said last
[1:13:33] Sunday's message so you know even the
[1:13:36] prophet dealt with things from people
[1:13:38] you know people are humans he said I
[1:13:40] believe I forgot to title last Sunday's
[1:13:43] message but it was something about
[1:13:46] paying your
[1:13:49] debts and he said you
[1:13:51] know now I'm reading no matter matter
[1:13:55] what you say it's misunderstood by
[1:13:59] many so I'm not trying to you can do
[1:14:02] whatever you want to your money makes no
[1:14:05] difference to brother
[1:14:08] Dale it's just something that God was
[1:14:10] stealing with me huh brother Dale's done
[1:14:14] those bill paying things where you get
[1:14:18] $33,000 Bill and you pay only 3,000
[1:14:22] principal I kind of matured past those
[1:14:24] kind of
[1:14:28] operations he said you misunderstood
[1:14:30] many times not because they want to
[1:14:32] misunderstand it but because you simply
[1:14:35] misunderstand it he said now you know
[1:14:37] someone say shouldn't we buy a car and
[1:14:40] he said no it isn't that Jesus spoke in
[1:14:42] the Bible oh no man nothing he said
[1:14:44] that's lingering debts that you can pay
[1:14:46] pay them he said oh no man nothing
[1:14:48] doesn't mean he said you owe your rent
[1:14:50] you owe your phone bill and whatever
[1:14:52] more he said we owe these things and we
[1:14:54] pay them but
[1:14:56] no but an old lingering debt that you
[1:14:58] could pay and and be paying on pay it
[1:15:02] off see now don't go with anything
[1:15:04] hanging on you like that remember the
[1:15:07] time when I was sick he's talking about
[1:15:09] when he was sick he come out of the
[1:15:10] hospital he owed
[1:15:11] $2,000 and he used drugs from the store
[1:15:14] and he said I owed him about $300 or
[1:15:16] $400 for my drugs and he said he never
[1:15:19] even knew
[1:15:21] me and he said I went to the man and he
[1:15:24] said never refused to send me the drugs
[1:15:26] and he said he said now I owe you and he
[1:15:29] said I'm just still awful weak this is
[1:15:32] Brother Brown coming out and he said but
[1:15:35] I'm trying to go to work he said now if
[1:15:38] I can't pay you he
[1:15:40] said I just become a Christian and I
[1:15:43] said the first thing I pay to the man
[1:15:46] from the drugstore is my duty to God he
[1:15:49] said I owe him my ties and he said I
[1:15:51] want to pay him my ties first and I said
[1:15:54] then the next duty is I pay my
[1:15:57] debts and I said my father is really
[1:16:00] sickly and he's got about 10 of us
[1:16:03] children in the family and he said if I
[1:16:06] can't pay you at least now watch this he
[1:16:09] owed him
[1:16:13] $2400 and he was going to pay him
[1:16:20] 25 that would have been a long time
[1:16:23] clearing up the debt
[1:16:26] he said but if I can't pay you at least
[1:16:28] 25 cents I'll come by and tell you about
[1:16:30] it he said if I can't do it this time
[1:16:33] but now by the help of God I'll pay
[1:16:36] every bit of it off and that's what I
[1:16:38] mean and he said oh some Christians here
[1:16:39] in the church one time he said they went
[1:16:42] out and they got some work done on their
[1:16:44] car here and a man came back the man
[1:16:46] said I I'll pay you and he said I get
[1:16:50] paid on
[1:16:51] Saturday or something
[1:16:53] another and he never paid him and weeks
[1:16:57] after weeks rolled by and he never paid
[1:17:00] them and he never said a word and the
[1:17:03] man came to brother bam and asked me he
[1:17:05] said you see that reflects on the
[1:17:09] church he said it reflects against
[1:17:13] Christ amen and he said if you can't pay
[1:17:17] him tell them you know I can't pay you
[1:17:20] just right now but I'm a Christian and
[1:17:22] I'll just remember it's watch this now I
[1:17:25] want you to this may shock you cuz you
[1:17:29] probably never well I whatever he said
[1:17:32] this s Prophet said he said now
[1:17:34] remember I owe this and remember it's on
[1:17:39] God's books
[1:17:42] too you don't think God cares about you
[1:17:45] what you do with your
[1:17:46] money it's on God's books too and you
[1:17:49] know that you do and so that I'm trying
[1:17:51] to tell you for myself and all of us
[1:17:54] here together try to be ready for we
[1:17:56] know that we're getting near
[1:17:58] something very near something is going
[1:18:01] to take place and so we want to be ready
[1:18:04] when the coming of the Lord draws nigh
[1:18:06] and we want to be ready for that great
[1:18:10] hour wow I already told you I'm just
[1:18:13] going to highlight this so I can go
[1:18:15] through it fast here brother Brown's
[1:18:16] talking about his ministry and and and I
[1:18:19] I just want to read you
[1:18:21] uh I want to read you some of his things
[1:18:24] because it was shock you he said I was
[1:18:26] down a few months ago and he said we had
[1:18:28] a meeting and I was really
[1:18:30] discouraged in
[1:18:32] California and my meaning are you
[1:18:35] hanging on had
[1:18:38] failed
[1:18:46] terribly and I promise the Lord that if
[1:18:48] he ever failed me to pay the
[1:18:51] bills and he goes into Samson fford wh
[1:18:55] and Saul fell for popularity and balum
[1:18:57] fell for money he said when God quits
[1:19:00] paying the bills I quit
[1:19:03] preaching
[1:19:07] amen he don't mention that one time he
[1:19:11] mentions that
[1:19:12] repeatedly so you know anytime that
[1:19:15] people are out doing work for God they
[1:19:18] shouldn't ask other believers it's you
[1:19:20] know it's not God's will for a man of
[1:19:24] God
[1:19:25] to want to do God's work and beg for
[1:19:28] money that's not God's will a matter of
[1:19:31] fact I'll even rephrase it more than
[1:19:33] that it's not even God's will for me to
[1:19:38] ask better yet I'll even confin it even
[1:19:41] more it's not even my will God's will
[1:19:43] for the minister to tell
[1:19:47] you do you believe God's
[1:19:50] omnipotent do you believe he speaks to
[1:19:52] people that got the Holy Ghost do you
[1:19:54] believe that he can make the phone ring
[1:19:56] on both ends brother did Brother Brown
[1:19:58] say he works on both ends
[1:20:01] uhhuh are we mature Christians or not
[1:20:03] and see so all these things people like
[1:20:05] acting like in kindergarten you got more
[1:20:07] faith in rich countries than you do in
[1:20:11] Jehovah you
[1:20:17] see that's perfect
[1:20:19] balance amen what we need to do is just
[1:20:23] trust God
[1:20:25] and
[1:20:27] Obey just trust God and Obey and see God
[1:20:31] May control where you go by see watch
[1:20:35] this you know the Bible says when you go
[1:20:37] don't take an extra set of clothes with
[1:20:39] you don't prepare what you're going to
[1:20:41] sleep don't take no money with
[1:20:44] you but we take the credit
[1:20:49] card because you have more faith in that
[1:20:51] Visa than you do in God yeah
[1:21:00] maybe you didn't pray through Ono
[1:21:03] then
[1:21:08] amen I promise the Lord in my meetings
[1:21:11] that when my meetings got started he
[1:21:13] said they didn't financially support
[1:21:16] themselves I would never let them beg
[1:21:18] anyone that ever begs for money or who's
[1:21:21] going to give $50 or so forth he said
[1:21:24] that time will stop
[1:21:26] it they go what they're talking about if
[1:21:28] they ever take up pledges he said if you
[1:21:30] ever brother Brown never ever believe
[1:21:32] and take up who will pay pledges down
[1:21:34] the road for next month when
[1:21:39] we said I don't believe in that
[1:21:42] garbage because you're binding the
[1:21:44] people that then they got something else
[1:21:46] they got to think about for two months I
[1:21:47] wonder if I can meet the pledge that's
[1:21:50] not God's
[1:21:52] way amen
[1:21:56] y now Lord when you don't support me he
[1:22:00] said it's time for me to come back
[1:22:04] home God help
[1:22:06] us here here's this one where uh I said
[1:22:10] I said look a few years from now look in
[1:22:14] a few years from now and I will say it
[1:22:16] within the space of five years or maybe
[1:22:19] a little bit longer or maybe a little
[1:22:21] bit less your money won't be worth the
[1:22:24] paper
[1:22:25] it's rodon he said it won't be worth
[1:22:28] nothing and I'll just tell you something
[1:22:31] that's that's came
[1:22:33] true that's came true brother Brown was
[1:22:36] exactly right it ain't worth
[1:22:39] nothing I I showed you a few maybe it
[1:22:41] might have been a year or so ago I was
[1:22:43] showing you the difference of of
[1:22:44] inflation and how it works and if you
[1:22:46] Google the bank it'll talk about how it
[1:22:48] trick people to inflation but you know
[1:22:51] when my dad bought his farm before I was
[1:22:53] born
[1:22:55] he paid $1,200 for it today it would
[1:22:58] sell for 3 or 4 million that's inflation
[1:23:01] when I was in elementary school in grade
[1:23:03] two they would have hot dog day and the
[1:23:05] hot dog was a
[1:23:07] quarter a a thing of milk was a
[1:23:10] dime a
[1:23:13] DME that's called
[1:23:16] worthless we went to sale yesterday and
[1:23:20] Felix went down to the thing and he had
[1:23:21] 20 bucks and it took 20 bucks to buy a
[1:23:23] hamburger and some
[1:23:25] priz a small potato 20 bucks
[1:23:30] 25 what the prophet said was exactly the
[1:23:36] truth amen here he says this quote and I
[1:23:40] want to go into this and I want to I'm
[1:23:41] going to finish with this it's talking
[1:23:43] about when he met his
[1:23:46] wife he said it's not the robin the p on
[1:23:49] we mentioned this Wednesday night and we
[1:23:50] had a wonderful time if you miss
[1:23:52] Wednesday night service you're missing a
[1:23:54] lot
[1:23:55] he said it's not the robin that pecks on
[1:23:56] the outside of the Apple that hurts the
[1:23:59] Apple it's the worm on the inside that
[1:24:02] you can't see that kills
[1:24:08] it
[1:24:09] amen he said I guess you'd like to know
[1:24:12] how I met my my wife and his girl said
[1:24:15] and I want to go through this because he
[1:24:16] talks about some
[1:24:19] relationship uh things and he also talks
[1:24:22] about some money issues and I want to
[1:24:23] show you you how we and I I promise I'm
[1:24:26] going to close when we finish this one I
[1:24:28] have much more but we'll just move it
[1:24:30] back cuz it's it's we're coming up to
[1:24:34] time but he talks about when he met his
[1:24:37] first
[1:24:38] wife
[1:24:40] there and
[1:24:43] uh he thought she
[1:24:46] was super
[1:24:48] lovely very sweet character and he's
[1:24:50] talking about this I'm just paraphrasing
[1:24:52] I have this quote in front of me and he
[1:24:54] he said I went with her for a while and
[1:24:55] he said I come home and he said her
[1:24:58] father was uh working during the
[1:25:00] Depression I want to show you something
[1:25:03] here uh honey you got your phone divide
[1:25:07] uh 60032 into 600 I forgot to do that
[1:25:11] forgive me and he said his father her
[1:25:13] her
[1:25:14] father had a job during the Depression
[1:25:17] and he made 600 a
[1:25:20] month and he said I was working this for
[1:25:23] any of you that have any daughters that
[1:25:25] might get married in the future and he
[1:25:27] said I was working digging ditches this
[1:25:29] is brother brandham and he said I was
[1:25:33] making $32 a
[1:25:37] month it was 25 cents a day I think it
[1:25:41] was but it was or or maybe it was
[1:25:44] something different now I I actually
[1:25:45] don't have that right here and he said
[1:25:47] oh he said well I shouldn't go with her
[1:25:52] any
[1:25:53] longer cuz she's too pretty of a girl
[1:25:56] and I either need to make a commitment
[1:25:58] to her or let her go free how many times
[1:26:00] that go
[1:26:03] in okay 19 times you know I wonder I
[1:26:07] wonder if you know us dads if we had if
[1:26:10] if we were making uh I wonder if us dads
[1:26:14] were making $1,000 a week that ain't
[1:26:17] very much now but if we were making
[1:26:19] $1,000 a week it's easier to do the math
[1:26:21] and we had somebody come to want to
[1:26:23] marry our daughter for $50 a week we'd
[1:26:25] say
[1:26:31] yes you think brother
[1:26:34] [Laughter]
[1:26:39] Matt let's see what let's see how it
[1:26:41] panned out for the
[1:26:43] prophet he said well I thought that I
[1:26:46] shouldn't go with her any longer cuz I
[1:26:48] was taking up her time and she's a good
[1:26:49] girl and she and you know she's going to
[1:26:51] make somebody a good wife and I should
[1:26:53] let her go or ask her to marry me and he
[1:26:57] said I just couldn't get the nerve
[1:27:00] up and he said there's some really
[1:27:03] special stuff in here we need to
[1:27:06] understand cuz sometimes we believe
[1:27:08] something that ain't even real and he
[1:27:10] said so I guess
[1:27:12] how he said I I could never ask
[1:27:15] her cuz that would just be not
[1:27:18] possible so he said I wrote her a
[1:27:22] letter and he said I asked her in the
[1:27:24] letter to marry me and he said well now
[1:27:27] you know it wasn't just a Dear Miss will
[1:27:30] you will you have me he said it was a
[1:27:33] little
[1:27:34] bit
[1:27:38] mushier than
[1:27:42] that our Prophet was
[1:27:46] mushy whoa that's not
[1:27:51] spiritual that might just be your
[1:27:53] thought
[1:27:55] he said it was a little bit musier what
[1:27:58] you would call musier than that and I
[1:28:01] kind of talked to her and I remember the
[1:28:02] thought and I got something right and he
[1:28:05] and so
[1:28:07] uh he said so I worked up till the
[1:28:11] morning I worked at the public works and
[1:28:13] he said I got the nerve to put the mail
[1:28:16] letter in the mailbox it took him a few
[1:28:19] days after he wrote the letter to just
[1:28:21] get the nerve to mail it and he said it
[1:28:23] was on Monday morning I dropped it in
[1:28:25] the box and he said all day I thought
[1:28:26] about this letter and he said tonight I
[1:28:30] said oh no he said oh no he said he said
[1:28:33] I'll hear from her tonight and her
[1:28:35] mother will call me and rake me over the
[1:28:38] coast and I went on he said and it went
[1:28:42] night was all like that I was afraid of
[1:28:45] getting raked over the
[1:28:50] coast you know what God showing you this
[1:28:53] morning our Propet was a real
[1:28:57] person God uses real
[1:29:01] people and I was to meet her on
[1:29:03] Wednesday night to go to
[1:29:06] church and so I remember when I came
[1:29:09] towards Wednesday night he said I was
[1:29:11] just so
[1:29:14] nervous I didn't know what to
[1:29:18] do he said I thought what I'm going to
[1:29:22] do when I get there
[1:29:25] so I asked my
[1:29:26] mother I said you got to rely on your
[1:29:29] good old
[1:29:30] mother I
[1:29:32] said has hope called he said she said no
[1:29:35] did you get any mail he she said no said
[1:29:38] well maybe it got hung up in the mailbox
[1:29:42] and she didn't even get it out of the
[1:29:43] box yet and I thought oh something's
[1:29:45] going to happen here he said oh I went
[1:29:47] up and he said I drove up to her house
[1:29:50] on Wednesday night that's another good
[1:29:52] question for your brother Matt
[1:29:55] and he said rather than go
[1:29:58] in I blew the
[1:30:06] horn I would have
[1:30:09] went any man that don't want to come
[1:30:11] into the door knock to get my daughter
[1:30:15] and he sits out and like B his horn yeah
[1:30:16] just thank you sister joony I would have
[1:30:19] said you little squirt
[1:30:25] he blew the
[1:30:27] horn if that had been my wife I would
[1:30:29] have got a terrible tongue lashing when
[1:30:31] she got out
[1:30:34] there and she come out and said come
[1:30:38] in and he said I panicked he said Oh I
[1:30:42] thought oh no he said what am I going to
[1:30:46] say in there to his mother to her mother
[1:30:49] and I'm really going to get
[1:30:52] it I'm really going to get it he said
[1:30:55] are you ready to
[1:30:57] go and she said let's walk to
[1:31:01] church and so he said oh no he said I
[1:31:05] said oh okay and so they walked to
[1:31:08] church on Wednesday night and he said
[1:31:11] the minister looked or oh he went into
[1:31:13] the house too and he he seen his
[1:31:14] mother-in-law and she said hello Bill
[1:31:16] and I said hello how are you and he said
[1:31:19] I was so nervous so I thought
[1:31:22] something's going to happen
[1:31:24] you know how you feel when you're under
[1:31:26] a great
[1:31:34] strain
[1:31:35] amen I'm trying to show you that he was
[1:31:38] a human and you can even get under a
[1:31:40] strain
[1:31:42] by
[1:31:44] slavery we have other things that affect
[1:31:46] cuz we I'm going somewhere so we went
[1:31:49] out and we went to
[1:31:52] church now this is a Vindicated prophet
[1:31:55] and he is
[1:31:56] Vindicated and honestly I didn't hear
[1:31:59] one thing the preacher
[1:32:04] said
[1:32:06] wow now if we had any young people come
[1:32:08] to church and they were so affected by
[1:32:11] the relationship that they didn't hear
[1:32:12] me preach we would judge
[1:32:15] them we would you might as well just say
[1:32:17] yes because you
[1:32:19] would I'll say it for you
[1:32:22] amen getting too quiet
[1:32:25] he said honestly I never heard a thing
[1:32:27] that Pastor Davis said that night and he
[1:32:30] preached he just preached the way and I
[1:32:33] I I I didn't know what he was saying he
[1:32:35] said I was scared something was going to
[1:32:41] happen and I looked at her oh she was so
[1:32:45] pretty and she was going to tell
[1:32:47] me that this is all
[1:32:50] over and it's the end for you don't come
[1:32:53] and see me anymore
[1:32:55] more and stay away from home after
[1:32:59] tonight and so I had all fixed up what
[1:33:02] she was going to tell me see our Prophet
[1:33:04] was dreaming about things that was going
[1:33:06] to happen and he was see how I I'm
[1:33:10] showing you something by this that I
[1:33:12] know some of you are missing but our
[1:33:14] life choices affect how we worship
[1:33:17] God see things that are in our
[1:33:20] environment affects what's going on in
[1:33:22] church
[1:33:25] man and then they may not even be evil
[1:33:27] it's not evil like it's fine to get
[1:33:29] married but that's the same thing that
[1:33:31] happens with finances it can affect our
[1:33:34] we can be so sidetracked that it
[1:33:36] wouldn't matter if we preach Hellfire
[1:33:38] and brimstone or or Jesus walked in
[1:33:41] himself cuz our mind is somewhere else
[1:33:44] that's all I'm trying to say and he so
[1:33:47] after church was over and we started
[1:33:48] walking back home and he said oh it was
[1:33:50] pretty Moonlight and he said we're
[1:33:51] walking down the street
[1:33:54] and we went on and he said I looked at
[1:33:56] her and I thought oh I'm going to hate
[1:33:58] that this is the last night I'll ever be
[1:34:00] able to see her and all this and I and
[1:34:03] she
[1:34:05] uh and I said how are you doing tonight
[1:34:08] and she said just fine how are you and I
[1:34:12] thought now this is a prophet I I love
[1:34:14] this it might be killing you but I love
[1:34:16] it he said he says I thought hurry up
[1:34:19] lady tell me something
[1:34:24] i i before I
[1:34:30] faint don't get too close to home I
[1:34:33] walked a little farther and I
[1:34:35] said sure pretty night she said yep it
[1:34:38] is I thought well why don't you hurry up
[1:34:41] say something you know women can just
[1:34:45] keep you like that anyhow and you know
[1:34:48] under such
[1:34:50] suspicion and I walked on and I thought
[1:34:52] well she's getting pretty close to home
[1:34:53] I said uh did did did did you get a
[1:34:57] letter in the
[1:34:58] mail and she said
[1:35:01] uh that was all she said uh that was
[1:35:05] all she she didn't even say if she got
[1:35:08] it or not and he said uh did you get my
[1:35:13] letter and she said
[1:35:17] uh and I thought my oh my I certainly
[1:35:22] burn an energy there
[1:35:24] I said well I said did did did you did
[1:35:27] you read
[1:35:29] it and she said
[1:35:32] uh-huh and I said I said well what did
[1:35:36] you think of it she said it was all
[1:35:41] right and I said well my I said I now he
[1:35:45] he stuttered now he said did did did did
[1:35:47] did you did you did you read it
[1:35:51] all see he was looking for for an answer
[1:35:55] and she
[1:35:56] said
[1:35:58] yes and I said
[1:36:00] well what did you
[1:36:03] think and she said well it was
[1:36:07] okay and we got
[1:36:11] married and there it was and I don't
[1:36:13] know how we just got
[1:36:16] [Music]
[1:36:17] married and then he goes on and he he
[1:36:20] goes and he and I I want to show you
[1:36:22] something here he says I want to show
[1:36:24] you the strain that he was under now
[1:36:27] that's what I'm I'm not trying to change
[1:36:30] the subject but it's the strain that God
[1:36:32] don't want us
[1:36:35] under you you can live your life and
[1:36:38] you've got to buy all the things you
[1:36:39] need but it's the
[1:36:42] strain there and now there's some
[1:36:44] strains you can't help like there's
[1:36:46] things that happen that are like flat
[1:36:47] out accidents sister Joan's basement
[1:36:49] flooded sister you know sister Donna you
[1:36:52] know AC or stuff okay that's just that's
[1:36:55] called
[1:36:56] life okay but I mean you know strange
[1:37:00] that you choose to put yourself under we
[1:37:03] don't have to go under
[1:37:05] them amen and they affect your worship
[1:37:10] they affect how you go to church they
[1:37:12] affect how you worship they affect how
[1:37:13] you lose yourself with
[1:37:16] Christ and I said the next strain came
[1:37:20] when I was to ask her mother and daddy
[1:37:22] and he said well you know he he said
[1:37:23] apparently I uh he said it was apparent
[1:37:27] to do that and so I never would forget
[1:37:30] her dad Charley he said he was sitting
[1:37:33] right there that afternoon and her
[1:37:35] mother was very prissy sort of a woman a
[1:37:38] fine woman and she belonged to up in the
[1:37:40] ranks you know she was wealthy and
[1:37:42] Charlie was just a good old humble
[1:37:45] brother praise God for good old humble
[1:37:48] brothers and I thought well I'll ask him
[1:37:51] and I'll let him ask her
[1:37:54] and I thought could I get by with man a
[1:37:57] lot better than I could ever talk to her
[1:38:00] so one night I was leaving now he didn't
[1:38:03] do it then he one night I was leaving
[1:38:05] and hope said he said did you ask Dad
[1:38:09] yet and she he said no he said
[1:38:14] well well you ought
[1:38:16] to and he said why know I should
[1:38:21] but I'm not
[1:38:24] hope said I think it'll be
[1:38:27] okay so when I went out to leave that
[1:38:32] night he said see you later her dad said
[1:38:36] see you later
[1:38:38] Billy and I said uhuh Charlie he
[1:38:43] said I said could I talk to you just a
[1:38:48] bit and he would have said I said he
[1:38:51] come out and this is his English he's
[1:38:52] stuttering here
[1:38:54] and he said he came out and we walked on
[1:38:56] the front porch and he said I was
[1:38:58] sweating and
[1:39:04] shaking I said Charlie I want to ask you
[1:39:08] something he said oh you can have her
[1:39:11] Billy he said just go and be good to
[1:39:15] her he never did ask
[1:39:19] her and I said oh I love him to this day
[1:39:22] because of that
[1:39:25] you know I I'm showing you some things
[1:39:28] sometimes we don't have to hurt people
[1:39:30] or or you know put you know what I'm
[1:39:32] saying like we're all unique and if you
[1:39:35] know somebody's got strength
[1:39:38] just trying you know what I mean there
[1:39:42] there's a lesson to be learned in this
[1:39:43] it's not here for nothing just kind
[1:39:47] of we're all on the same side
[1:39:57] and I said oh Charlie I can't give her
[1:39:59] the
[1:40:00] living or the clothes and I can't buy
[1:40:03] her what you can buy her but he said
[1:40:05] I'll promise you this I'll be I'll love
[1:40:08] her with all my heart and I'll work till
[1:40:10] my hands bleed for living and I'll be
[1:40:12] true to her and I know as true to her as
[1:40:16] I know how to be and he put his arm
[1:40:18] around me and he was a
[1:40:19] German and he said his big hand over me
[1:40:22] and he said Billy
[1:40:25] I'd rather that you would have her be
[1:40:28] good to her than somebody that could
[1:40:30] give her a
[1:40:32] lot of
[1:40:35] money that's what I was getting
[1:40:38] to and would treat
[1:40:40] her
[1:40:44] mean sometimes is people in the world
[1:40:47] that we live in we put a lot of stake in
[1:40:51] money money
[1:40:53] it's just something
[1:40:55] that we're using but we shouldn't put
[1:40:58] our stake in it it's all going to burn
[1:41:02] it's all going to pass away and you know
[1:41:04] when we get to the ply Gates they're not
[1:41:05] going to ask how much money you had they
[1:41:08] God ain't going to rate us we're not
[1:41:09] going to sit around the throne based on
[1:41:11] how much we had in rsps or savings cter
[1:41:15] how many cars we
[1:41:16] drove you s to me but we're
[1:41:21] humans and it's hard to leave that own
[1:41:23] now you see what I
[1:41:24] mean they're not wrong I'm I'm not
[1:41:27] saying that you understand I I drive a
[1:41:29] nice car so I would be the first one
[1:41:31] sining and I have a Visa and it's got
[1:41:33] money on
[1:41:35] it amen but my plan even in the future
[1:41:39] is to change some
[1:41:45] things you know we have 50 pair of shoes
[1:41:48] there's people in many countries have
[1:41:52] none you know we went to El
[1:41:54] Salvador and they don't need three
[1:41:56] closets for one
[1:41:59] person you know Uganda I mean you can
[1:42:03] just I mean you can just name it most of
[1:42:04] the people there they're you know what
[1:42:06] I'm saying and and that don't make us
[1:42:09] like we do have a cool
[1:42:11] climate but I have 20 winter coats I
[1:42:14] don't wear any of
[1:42:16] them you know what I'm saying there's
[1:42:19] balance in this and and are are we the
[1:42:22] stewards that we should be for God's
[1:42:27] kingdom I just I just wonder I pray we
[1:42:29] are I pray we are this this message is
[1:42:32] not about money but I or not about uh
[1:42:36] changing your thing but see balum
[1:42:39] couldn't get away from even though God
[1:42:41] stopped them on the road with a donkey
[1:42:43] even though God whooped them like you
[1:42:46] would not believe would have actually
[1:42:48] killed them if the donkey hadn't stopped
[1:42:50] them killed them he went right back out
[1:42:54] because he
[1:42:56] loved the credit
[1:43:00] card he got sheep and
[1:43:03] goats and he never could
[1:43:05] do what Bao wanted him to do because it
[1:43:08] wasn't
[1:43:11] impossible amen God help
[1:43:14] us God help us I want to just finish I'm
[1:43:17] still on this quote is that all right
[1:43:19] I'm still uh and we're finishing soon he
[1:43:22] said we got married and we we started
[1:43:23] housekeeping and I wanted to show you I
[1:43:25] mentioned about uh having your house
[1:43:27] cluttered and and if yours is ours is
[1:43:29] too I can barely get to my chair without
[1:43:32] snorkeling through the plants but uh he
[1:43:36] said the only thing we had I'll tell you
[1:43:37] what we had he said we had a an old
[1:43:39] place where my rent cost
[1:43:44] me $4 a
[1:43:48] month $4 a month and I went to a little
[1:43:52] old place there and somebody give me an
[1:43:53] old-fashioned folding bed and you
[1:43:56] remember the oldfashioned folding beds
[1:43:57] they had straw
[1:44:01] mattresses and we had a little old table
[1:44:03] that I bought at Sears and
[1:44:05] robu that was when they were together
[1:44:08] that was way back and the chairs and I
[1:44:11] painted
[1:44:14] them and he said we had two
[1:44:21] rugs and they cost
[1:44:24] a quarter a
[1:44:26] piece and I went over to Websters and I
[1:44:29] bought he was a junk dealer and he said
[1:44:31] I bought a cooking stove and I gave him
[1:44:33] a dollar and something for it and I had
[1:44:36] to and I had to pay a dollar.
[1:44:41] 75 for Gat for grates to put in it and I
[1:44:45] got a nce box at the Public Service
[1:44:47] Company for
[1:44:49] 50s and one of them was in a swap
[1:44:54] and we went to keeping
[1:44:56] housekeeping now there ain't one of us
[1:44:58] sitting here that if we were honest with
[1:45:00] ourself would let our daughter go into
[1:45:03] that
[1:45:04] situation
[1:45:09] why because you think you're too
[1:45:12] good me too I I'm preaching to me too
[1:45:16] because I think my daughters would be
[1:45:18] too good
[1:45:19] too and Friends
[1:45:23] I'm still
[1:45:25] reading does everybody believe the
[1:45:27] prophet like is that okay like oh thank
[1:45:29] you brother Bernard I'm good brother
[1:45:31] matter whoever was said friends it was
[1:45:35] Paradise on
[1:45:37] Earth we had each other and we became a
[1:45:41] covenant in that time and I became a
[1:45:44] minister and was
[1:45:46] preaching and we loved one another and
[1:45:49] that's all we cared for I want to show
[1:45:52] you something see it was
[1:45:55] Simplicity that he could minister to God
[1:45:58] if our Prophet would have had a Visa
[1:46:01] card would have he been
[1:46:05] successful amen we don't know but he
[1:46:08] never watch this he said listen
[1:46:10] happiness does not consist of how much
[1:46:12] of the world's good you have or but how
[1:46:14] content you are with the portion that's
[1:46:16] a lot of to you that's right remember
[1:46:19] that's all we had and we were happy
[1:46:23] and lovely and I had a little church and
[1:46:26] they had built for me and I started
[1:46:28] preaching the group
[1:46:30] see sometimes we we think well times
[1:46:32] have changed but have
[1:46:35] they
[1:46:37] amen and What's happen is the Love of
[1:46:41] Money can come
[1:46:43] in and it can affect how we serve God
[1:46:47] not that it can it has or God would have
[1:46:50] told me to preach this
[1:46:51] today it's not it can it already
[1:46:54] has and there's people that you know you
[1:46:58] just you for you and your household you
[1:46:59] need to make sound
[1:47:01] decisions that you know I I I make a
[1:47:05] confession there's not been one time
[1:47:08] that I've come back from Africa that it
[1:47:11] didn't affect me for months I come
[1:47:15] back CU I'd go for breakfast and I'd say
[1:47:18] that's more than they make in a
[1:47:20] month or i' gas up my truck and I'd say
[1:47:24] well they couldn't spend that in a
[1:47:31] year
[1:47:39] uhhuh he talked about Billy Paul was
[1:47:42] being born and and they went to the
[1:47:44] Pentecostal meetings and I I'm closing
[1:47:46] this is the same quote he's he's given
[1:47:48] this for a reason and he went to the
[1:47:51] Pentecostal meeting and you know they
[1:47:53] were happy people and they had the Holy
[1:47:54] Ghost and they were dancing he never
[1:47:56] seen this
[1:47:58] before and he said I was counting my
[1:48:00] money and he was way away in another
[1:48:03] state I want you to know this he was he
[1:48:05] was following the biblical principle
[1:48:07] take not an extra coat with you an extra
[1:48:09] thing and he said I counted my money and
[1:48:11] I had $2.50 left and he said I wanted to
[1:48:15] stay over and he said I had just enough
[1:48:19] gas to buy and put in my car to get back
[1:48:21] to Indiana just enough gas he couldn't
[1:48:24] eat and he couldn't get a
[1:48:28] room but he still
[1:48:30] went there's not one of us sitting here
[1:48:32] that would have done
[1:48:34] that but that's why God worked through
[1:48:38] him and and see he wasn't in debt no he
[1:48:42] didn't have a credit
[1:48:43] card and he said I looked at he he
[1:48:46] talking about his trousers and you know
[1:48:48] you know that he slept in the cornfield
[1:48:50] that night and he said they invited me
[1:48:52] to breakfast
[1:48:53] but he said I wouldn't go to the church
[1:48:55] breakfast cuz I couldn't put nothing in
[1:48:58] the offering because I couldn't get back
[1:49:01] home and he says oh they were just so
[1:49:04] friendly and invited me and he said they
[1:49:07] were just so inviting and welcome me and
[1:49:09] he said it wasn't and I wasn't going to
[1:49:12] eat with him because I didn't have no
[1:49:14] money to put in but I
[1:49:16] didn't I didn't eat with them but they
[1:49:18] made me feel so welcome
[1:49:21] anyway he said they were the cream of
[1:49:23] the crop and he said I got to tell you
[1:49:25] something he came back home and he was
[1:49:27] telling his wife they were the cream of
[1:49:28] the crop and they screamed and shuttered
[1:49:29] and jumped and all this and they weren't
[1:49:31] ashamed of their religion and and so and
[1:49:34] so he was so inspired by God now watch
[1:49:36] this he had a job I'm showing you
[1:49:38] something I'm closing with this real
[1:49:39] soon but he had
[1:49:41] nothing
[1:49:43] nothing zero when he got home he was
[1:49:46] broke and he came home to his wife and
[1:49:49] he said I met the cream of the crop and
[1:49:51] they're not ashamed of their religion
[1:49:53] and he said they've invited me out and
[1:49:54] he said I'm going to quit my
[1:49:58] job and his wife went
[1:50:02] oh you're getting
[1:50:06] right and he said look I'm going to quit
[1:50:09] my job and start right out to preaching
[1:50:11] and she said well we haven't got any
[1:50:14] money she was related to
[1:50:17] Len and I said but how much money do we
[1:50:20] got
[1:50:22] that sounds like me and she said well
[1:50:25] you got $12 and the payment on the forge
[1:50:27] 12
[1:50:32] bucks you
[1:50:35] see and he
[1:50:37] said well I'm going preaching for
[1:50:41] them and will you go with me and she
[1:50:43] said bless her heart she said I'll stick
[1:50:46] with you
[1:50:47] Billy I'll stick with you and I'll go
[1:50:50] with you I'm closing with that you know
[1:50:54] I I was showing you different things
[1:50:55] there and I I pray you got some of it
[1:50:58] but times haven't
[1:51:00] changed they were just making a
[1:51:03] living it's a bigger
[1:51:05] number but they were just
[1:51:08] surviving and brother Brown made hard
[1:51:11] decisions to serve
[1:51:14] God because he wasn't in a trap and of
[1:51:17] course he was called and
[1:51:19] dedicated and his wife was there you see
[1:51:22] you see how things are you think well
[1:51:24] you know well it's it's harder now we're
[1:51:26] that's it's always been hard you see
[1:51:30] what I mean you can ask any of these
[1:51:32] younger people here that started out was
[1:51:35] it easy when you got married sister Don
[1:51:37] sister Jan or brother no it was always
[1:51:41] hard it'll always be hard but your good
[1:51:45] decisions with God in the center just
[1:51:47] like a marriage it takes three with God
[1:51:50] in the center of your finan say what
[1:51:52] would God
[1:51:55] do what would God
[1:52:00] do do you know the young people need to
[1:52:03] hear things like this we didn't grow up
[1:52:05] in a world of
[1:52:07] restaurants you maybe had Granny's
[1:52:10] Kitchen or something I remember when
[1:52:12] fast food restaurants come out they had
[1:52:15] a beginning and they will actually have
[1:52:18] it in you know I remember when we went
[1:52:21] on family trips we took a loaf of bread
[1:52:24] a pound of baloney and the mustard
[1:52:27] can and we
[1:52:33] lived but it's about bondage and
[1:52:37] stress you make choices if you bind
[1:52:41] yourself and Satan SS back and
[1:52:45] laughs Satan sits back and laugh now I'm
[1:52:48] not trying to put you uh God just God
[1:52:52] helped us God help me be good stewards
[1:52:55] of what God give us and you
[1:52:57] know there's things we have to have
[1:52:59] let's stand musicians can come God just
[1:53:02] God help us you know I I believe and I
[1:53:05] know for a fact whether you believe it
[1:53:07] or not I'm I feel sorry for you but
[1:53:09] Satan's pulled the wool over our
[1:53:11] eyes and the World Bank has pulled our
[1:53:14] wool over our eyes and inflation and and
[1:53:17] you know everything's going to end it's
[1:53:19] just changed for me greatly because I
[1:53:21] don't know I must be getting younger in
[1:53:23] one way but you know when you get older
[1:53:25] it just changes your environment you
[1:53:27] know my brother called me and I maybe
[1:53:29] mentioned this Wednesday night there was
[1:53:30] a man that died in metya and he was
[1:53:33] worth he he just lived in a common house
[1:53:35] he' never get married and that and he
[1:53:37] bought a bunch of land and when he was
[1:53:39] younger and none of this matters but you
[1:53:42] know when you die you're
[1:53:43] dead it don't
[1:53:46] matter and my brother Paul said he said
[1:53:49] the government won't have no trouble
[1:53:50] meeting their bills this week cuz the
[1:53:52] guy was worth like 40 million he had
[1:53:54] hundreds and hundreds of he was telling
[1:53:56] me Parcels of land that he bought 400
[1:53:58] acres for $100 an acre they'll sell it
[1:54:00] now for 25,000 an acre but where will
[1:54:03] the money go he's still
[1:54:05] dead like does it don't even you know
[1:54:09] what I mean and we got to go back to the
[1:54:10] scripture that says lay up your
[1:54:13] Treasures your Treasures are your family
[1:54:16] the Eternal beings in your
[1:54:18] environment lay up your Treasures where
[1:54:21] moth and rust won't up now there's
[1:54:23] things we have to have I we will freeze
[1:54:25] to death if you don't have a warm house
[1:54:28] but just in balance in Balance amen and
[1:54:32] and and I also I I I I believe God wants
[1:54:35] to tell you this if you don't have it
[1:54:39] don't ever let a minister tell you or
[1:54:41] put pressure on you to give something
[1:54:44] that you don't have to
[1:54:45] give that's not God's
[1:54:48] way that's not God's way you need to
[1:54:50] know those things amen amen amen God
[1:54:54] help us you know if we're
[1:54:58] simpler we can serve him
[1:55:01] Freer and
[1:55:05] better amen
[1:55:07] amen there's things I did in my life you
[1:55:10] know I can remember and I'm I'm closing
[1:55:12] I'm trying to wind down I can remember
[1:55:14] when I spend in my bunker my yard for
[1:55:17] cattle I came that winter
[1:55:22] I said oh man if I was making that
[1:55:23] choice again I'd have that money back in
[1:55:25] the bank CU I could never pick it up
[1:55:29] again it was
[1:55:31] gone
[1:55:33] forever you know me before you make hard
[1:55:37] decision don't call Brother Dale I won't
[1:55:40] know what to do either but just think
[1:55:43] them through what would God do how will
[1:55:47] you feel about I have a good thing you
[1:55:49] know my grandpa and my mother's side
[1:55:51] used to say had a partnership with his
[1:55:53] son Larry and he'd anything that he was
[1:55:56] making a deal with he'd say well I have
[1:55:57] to talk to Larry but I tell people I say
[1:56:00] I have to sleep on it I have to pray or
[1:56:04] sleep on it and what I feel like in the
[1:56:06] morning when I wake up if I toss and
[1:56:08] turned all night I don't need whatever I
[1:56:10] toss and turned over I value the night's
[1:56:12] sleep a lot better than the tossing and
[1:56:14] turning amen that's what we're talking
[1:56:17] about amen God help us God help I hope
[1:56:21] that spoke to somebody a simpler
[1:56:24] life who has the most isn't who wins
[1:56:29] amen it's who is got the simple life
[1:56:33] that can heal the still small voice of
[1:56:36] Jehovah speaking in the
[1:56:39] cave amen we're getting so tied up with
[1:56:42] just Rat Race just running
[1:56:47] everywhere and and it and I mean
[1:56:49] sometimes you have seasons that you go
[1:56:51] through but but then you have to amen
[1:56:55] amen God help us
[1:56:59] amen we are in the
[1:57:03] season of the coming of the
