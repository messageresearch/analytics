Believers in Hell Satan believes but he won't be in heaven Jesus he just showed the scripture in John how the difference was if you keep my word you'll never taste of death and it was just a was just a powerful powerful message message and I would strongly encourage you it's on Little Flock video on Facebook um I I actually have the link so if you ask me I could send it to you but it was wonderful wonderful word it was just showed the brother just showed how we missed the plan of God because here Jesus came and he told the disciples exactly what was going to happen he said I'm here to pay the price of redemption and when he did that they thought it was was over and he said but that's what I told you I've been with you all these years and I was telling you exactly what was going to happen and you miss it and then it just showed you know in Thessalonians how Paul you know when he was traveling to Rome and they were going to take his life and all those things happen it was just like you know death where's your sting grave where's your Victory you know like it was just so beautiful how we can see beyond the little bumps that God's bringing us to character and bringing us to the Statue of the perfect man and the great plan of God in eternity it was just beautiful amen we were we were very blessed sister Ruth and brother Bernard and the family went and it was just a it was a

really enjoy the the fellow oh it was awesome brother Jose last night yes it was and driving home and I tell you you I pray I pray that we Great Fellowship and and His blessings upon us and I really feasted upon the word of the Lord this weekend this but I'm I had to go home you know things some time has to come to an end yeah interesting though that after the weekend my my wife knew I was going to come home Tuesday so after the weekend she the service was uh I was here Friday Saturday Sunday but by Tuesday she was saying I said we made an agreement you know that I'll spend two Sundays here but I just love you with the love of the Lord and know I I I I preach world because I love God Amen definitely love God at my you know I'm getting there really when I mean getting there and not to be a chart but I'm getting to be God want me to be amen and so I tell you what I ask God this turn your Bibles in the same time in the book of mar uh is it Mark 11 good read from verse just a few verses there in saints of God Amen we we uh we're going to take a little topic here and you know last night the Lord just blessed us with his word and I tell you the the camp meeting was great great man and the Saints R it back out because this as this morning I got a text message oh I enjoy that message but it was there I said wow that's good so much for technology yes good all right Luke chap 11 and uh we're going to look at let's start from verse 12 and I tell you the verses as down and on the tomorrow when they were come from Bethany he was hungry Jesus was hungry oh yes he was he was 100% man 100% God but he was hungry yes H so seeing a fig tree of far all having leaves she came if apply perhaps he might find anything there on the Fig not a mango not a orange but a fig because the Fig in those days had a lot lot sugar right and so they used to use it to make sugar so when you're hungry what normally happens is like your blood sugar drops so Jesus needed the sugar right good and so that he might find anything there and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet wow and Jesus answered and said unto it the Fig Tree no man eat of thee there after forever unless disciples heard it let's jump down what's happened later on verse uh 20 and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter calling to Rememberance said unto him amen Master behold the Fig Tree which though curse is withered away amen and Jesus answering said unto them have Faith sounds simple isn't it oh just have faith you know it sounds simple to the he oh just have faith Master then why don't I do it I got faith I've been in the message for 50 years why can't I do that Jesus said just have faith but everything goes together amen for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he says that the word says you say Amen but he went down now you don't stop therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive him and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive right wow forgive so it goes together beautiful yes sir if you have ought against any that your forgive if you have ought against any that your father which also in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your tres OES that's interesting God bless you amen so God bless you be seated love you with my love of the heart and uh can we just look at the little you know uh little topic here and um against the normal against the normal and uh as I tell you it's very interesting sometime you're studying the word and you're in the meditation of the word and things jump out to you and I remember a time a young man and you know was saying to me that that you know Pastor I've been praying for things and it's just not happening and you know you know real good pay the tithing and offering and all of that real faithful to to to to church yeah and uh you know I prayed about it and you know you want to give an answer because you know people if you understand a pastor sometime he has to be a doctor he has to be a psychiatrist he has to be a psychologist he has to be a mechanic I was telling brother Dale this morning a brother from church texting me he want to buy a car and he send me the call what what you think about this so he need an answer sometime a pastor is a is an architect you know I'm going to build a house you like this design so you got to have you may not have answer for everything but it's surprised to know what people think about a leader and so you know many have thought about it then I then I say Tri real wonderful have family and I say brother I I I hope that you're treating your wife well now what do you mean it says do you know the Bible says in 1 Peter chapter 3:7 you must honor your wife honor your wife as the weaker vessel so that your PR and the way you treat her your prayers can be [Applause] hindered wow your prayers can be hindered the way you treat your wife and he said I never thought of that but be I said brother I tell you when that scripture jump out me I I all me personally brothers and sisters I said I try to do everything in the word of God Amen to treat that of the sweetheart of mine right oh God because I don't want when I pray for something doesn't happen amen thank you Jesus and he said thank you brother I will look into the word and I said but that's what the word says but s of God has we look at even the nothing is wrong with the word of God don't you debate the word of God don't do it no I do not sayage on the word that means personal the message and the word I put them together and I call the word of God listen me I call the word of God and I understand it that way true the leading of the holy spirit amen now notice even the parable that Jesus Christ spoke about you remember the parables in Matthew Chapter 13 when you talk about the SE that went to seow seed nothing was wrong with the seed nothing is wrong with the word nothing is wrong with the message of God but notice the places that the seed fell oh my God that's why the way side amen the stone the ground among thorns and the good ground it was the place that the seed fell that was the problem nothing is wrong with the word but who get is where the word reaches oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen brother Luke's account of it Luke 8:1 15 he says amen but that on the good ground are they which receive in an honest art and having heard the word keep it you bring forth fruit honest art you keep it so you must be honest your heart must be pure your heart must be right and when the word of God hit that heart oh my you will bring forth fruit and much fruit with patience many times God will do things against the normal and we will miss it right because we're not seeing or hearing the message beyond that or the bigger message beyond what God is doing because sometime we can just structure her life in such a pattern that we are not seeing the bigger picture beyond what God is doing there you yes we can but look at the Saints against a normal against the usual way when Joshua looked and said Son stand still that wasn't normal glory to God you heard that that's not normal amen Moses never did that glory to God Moses speak to the Rock that's not normal because God told him before strike the rock with your Rod oh my I remember 7: 26- 27 God told Israel as he laid out the the laws of offering he said it's Abomination to eat anything with blood whether birds or beasts any person that do that you will be cut off from the people from among my people and yet Jesus who said those words God himself glory to God yet Jesus God in flesh stood there in Jerusalem in John 6 for when Jesus preaching publicly and said except you drink my blood and eat my flesh you have no life in you that's against what he already said who can take it's a heart saying who can take it when God do things against the normal many times it stumbles people but there is a message beyond that read between the lines he that haven't hear to hear will hear what the spirit of God is saying unto the churches glory to God but because it's against my pattern because it's against my structure I'm not able to see it oh Hallelujah ujah glory to God Amen remember Amen Brother John laid it out in John 23 St John chap 21:3 amen show that the disciples usually uh fish at night and they toil all night in Luke 5:4 they toil all night and catch no fish because these guys were experienced fish man amen and when Jesus said to them cast your net in the Deep because it's not day this a master but we to all night and catch nothing we are fishermen I'm a fisherman from a from I was about six years old uh I'm going about with my daddy I know this thing from inside out obey the word I'm doing this against the norm I'm the body so when they pulled in that it was so heavy they called the other brothers come over here and help me what is it God is showing us something he he is God thank you Lord so here Jesus is going to do something again against the normal against the normal so Jesus walking was hungry amen who was walking here the Creator right yes sir the Son of God is that right he created and the Creator walking towards the creation the word of God told us in Revelation 4 and verse 11 as the four beasts and 24 helders cast their Crown before him the words of worship or thou are worthy to glory to God you are worthy worthy are you Lord to take to receive power and glory and honor for thou Hast created all things and for by th for your pleasure they were and are created Jesus is that right sints for his purpose they were created Hallelujah the one sitting on the throne he said thou are worthy you receive honor honor and glory and power you create all things so here was the creator in flesh as the flesh got hungry Hallelujah walk up to the walk up to the Fig Tree amen hallelujah what was normal here is that it was not the season for it amen read the word wow amazing the Bible says amen but the leaves were right there flourish looking beautiful for the time of figs was not yet that was the normal because ecclesiastic God already established in his word ecclesiastic 3 verse one what did he said to everything there is a season woo Hallelujah I love God God who can accuse God of acting wrong he's God hallelujah he do what he pleases and what he pleases oh my everything ACC act according to pattern I also plant yams at home and when I became a farmer learning amen I go to the brother's farm and oh a yam you know I would be among them and you know watch how they do I didn't even know how to wrap the yam on the on the sticks they put it there and and they would wrap it then one of the brothers said brother Bartley he said pastor he said you got to wrap it a certain way because I thought you just hang it and he said no he and me every Vine and HT wraps one way in a clockwise Direction and I didn't know that God is in nature amen yes sir the prophet said that woo glory to God he said the closer you are to Nature the more you understand the word of God and they showed me the vine and they had to wrap it one a certain way and I WRA that vine we had beans that grows and Vine they showed me you got to wrap it a certain way and at night she said every time it grows it WRA itself he WRA itself one way I said my look at God as creation has to fall in line with their cre word god already created that in that fashion Hallelujah creation work in harmony with its creator glory glory to God hallelujah we are God's creation we have to fall in line amen with what the Creator requires amen know the saints of God and this we're going to pull up Hallelujah not the season that for according to the original creation but now the Creator is hungry glory to God thank you Lord the Creator is hungry what's your response the Bible says and he answered Christ was in communication with the fig tree right he was speaking with the fig tree right and the Fig Tree amen was communicating with Jesus that's why the word says and when he came nothing was there Jesus answered and said Oh Glory Hallelujah Jesus answered and said unto the tree oh God the tree of hears the mountains of hears all of God's creation were created with the faculty to hear from you to speak with you to respond to the command of God but now that God reach and standing here don't you tell him that you are not ready to produce you got to produce amen you have to produce Hallelujah no man shall eat of this thereafter it dried from The Roots Jesus said it's just Faith it's Faith have faith but you know what works with faith anonine love you can stand up and pray a two hours of magnificent prayers reeling out words from your from your dictionary to God and it just bouncing back why you got to learn to forgive Jesus Hallelujah you don't like that how could Jesus talking about faith amen laying the foundation this is what happened Jesus said it's just faith I spoke it the spoken word operates by faith he that come to God must believe that he is because without faith it is impossible to please God but Jesus jumped from faith and said guys when you are praying make sure that you forgive wow forgiveness comes from love glory to God hallelujah forgiveness comes out of love and love comes out of a pure heart love is of God and Jesus said yes you want this Faith you got to love first hallelujah oh my glory to God lord may I start loving first before I start preaching Lord may I start loving first before I start amen teach him the word we talk about faith faith faith start to love first oh God so Jesus said I Faith now what brought this faith what brought about this faith that Jesus manifested desperation he was hungry he was hungry now the holy spirit says tell the people desperation bring Christ on the scene desperation produced this fate not frustration sometimes we go to God in frustration not desperation don't go to God and tell him you're tired of the economy no don't go to God and tell him you're tired of the government all things were created by Him and for him amen Glory Hallelujah you know I look up the word frustration is a Fe feeling of being upset annoyed or deep chronic sense in a state of insecurity and dissatisfaction arising from unsolved problems or unfulfilled needs that don't bring Fai oh can I read something where the prophet of God says I believe the reason we don't have desperation is because the church lack the love of God the love of God Amen causes desperation not frustration oh God Lord I'm tired of wearing this one shoes Lord my shoes is broken I can't wear anymore I'm not going to church that's frustration desperation is Lord no matter how broken it is I'm going to worship you anyhow Lord I'm going to worship you anyhow glory to God hallelujah put him the hours and your reward is sure desperation will bring Christ on the scene desperation is what brings out the true you glory to God hallelujah amen the prophet said usually it's human it's human human are slothful in their minds it takes an emergency has to rise and when that do it throws them in desperation oh Hallelujah but you know desperation usually brings out the real thing that you are it shows what you are made of thank you Jesus thank you Lord so did Jesus just curs the Fig Tree because he God that Jesus was uh was being unjust to the Fig Tree he was sh them something here hallelujah the anger brings out a level of faith and that levels of Faith amen comes from desperation as a son and daughter of God God uh we are built uh in the image and likeness of God uh something lies uh beneath this flesh and that's God himself the true you how will that come out desperation pressure pressure glory to God it usually pulls out the good things that's are in that is in you Jesus I'm reading that it usually brings out the good thing now no this things and I look up this and I says by faith Enoch was translated all right that he should the Bible said that he should not see there something in heo we talk about it the other day the heo had to train his senses something and remember he had families all around hadam was there hadam had the Original Seed like how brother BR put it he said hadam never had a belly button because he never cut from a mama so I can't imagine the Curiosity that build around Adam's life because at the worlden when his study hadam was 752 years when hoch was born hoch uh 65 years later you know uh unto him was born Methuselah so all the these men were around hadam and oh my 300 years later hoch was translated the Apostle the Bible says Enoch walked with God two times that statement is used in the Bible never use again he said Noah walked with God that he said Enoch walk with God the statement walk with God doesn't mean that you physically walk it mean that you live in the presence of the supernatural oh Hallelujah you constantly dwell in the presence of the supernatural Hallelujah you constantly meditating on the word of God you constantly live under expectation Hallelujah and you know what happened the prophet said what you expect is what you shall get amen glory to God I expect daily in your life uh you got to live on expectation that you shall have a body change Hallelujah any day now you shall have a body change any day now you shall have a change no wonder this world is in confusion when you tell them about the Rapture because it's against the norm right yeah how will that happen and gravity pulls everything that goes up right it's against the nor GL God hallelujah now 69 years after the translation Noah was born now no this says when Noah came on the scene what was the talk of the day your great-grandfather has disappeared we don't know where he is because God never explained to anybody you know why I took him and he's with me God don't explain it glory to God she watch message of the day yeah oh your grandpa disappeared we don't know where he's at he mean your great grandpa disappeared where is he nobody ever seen in him do you know he he was the only one that lived such a short years 365 because God had a patter over he's life types one oh Hallelujah glory to God amen don't you realize amen that Noah kept his eyes on the words of Enoch and he was desperate Amen to revisit what happened and through the desperation God brought the FI to Noah why because Noah realized that Enoch saw something in Adam he saw something from the original seed hallelujah oh glory to God and there it brought that Faith the prophet says desperation produced that faith and that faith comes from love right I like how we put it we got to walk with God the same way to produce his faith we sing all the times in the message because we can read it oh we Enoch the seventh of Adam oh we are the in the seventh age right this is not stepping off into nowhere no just like that we're going to come on the squeeze the squeeze produce desperation Glory desperation produced this Rapture in faith Hallelujah glory to God so notice like the prophet said when God sent his Prophet to ezekiah the king and said look here your time is up your it's over mind as well you make your pack your bag you're going to die you're going to die the prophet said desperation change God's program wow he said it desperation ezekiah turned his face to the wall as the man of God was on his journey back he talked to God hallelujah and that desperate condition God tell the prophet as a matter of fact stop where you are go back to him and tell him that I'm giving him 15 more years oh Hallelujah glory to God God had 15 more years to his life what causes a desperation what produces that hallelujah oh the love of God faith in Christ brings about salvation daily but you can you you can have faith in Jesus Christ but you don't have the faith of Jesus Christ that's the thing read the Bible that's in there Apostle Paul talk about you got faith in Jesus right you read right through the scriptures many had faith in Jesus but they never had the faith of Jesus Oh Hallelujah when you had the faith of when Jesus have faith in God he was the son of God Jesus said the father work and work yeah why do you think he prayed the prayor when he's the father in John chapter 17 about three times here consecutively Jesus said father I want them to be one as we are father let them to be one as we are what would that mean Jesus said I am the father one the father speak and I speak glory god thank you Lord Brother D you and I will never be one you may like steak I don't like come on in the natural in the natural we'll never be one you things you like I don't like God is a god of variety but how can we we be one as we are I cannot be in you and you in me we got to be one in Christ may we be one Lord may they be one as we are amen hallelujah glory to God may I produce attributes as the Son of God that's who the world creation has been waiting for creation has never been waiting for the Baptist the Methodist the Church of God Pastor Dave Pastor Bartley always waiting for the message Believers the world creation has been waiting for the manifestation of the what sons of God glory to God sons of God that are being created by the word of Truth the Faith of Christ Jesus brought us about the knowledge of the Son of God the faith of Jesus produced the revelation of redemption the faith of Jesus brings a revelation of our identity the faith of Jesus glory to God reveals the true purpose of the son of God in this last day desperation calls for a subject I'm reading and he said notice when when the subject no matter how faint that subject is it received this it received desperation right there right because Faith catches when desperation pushes oh I love that have faith in God notice can I say that again Faith catches it when desperation push it love in there mix with that you got to mix love with that to God mix love with that glory to God Amen you see that so faith will catch what desperation pushes but desperation is an anointing that sege for subjects but that predestinated subject oh amen the desperation will come on you brother Dale and when desperation HS you God knows he's not destroying you you it's putting you under pressure why to produce that Faith glory to God but if that love is not in you sometimes what the pressure produce is anger and miserableness and hatefulness oh Hallelujah can I preach this but when the love is inside there you are forgiving you are kind you are Meek you are gentle put them together it brings the faith of God hallelujah you know the problem with some of us sometimes we sign a contract to work 40 hours for the week but you only work 20 and at the end of the week you won 40 hour pay that's unreasonable oh God help some of us how do you do that and then when you don't get the 40 hour pay and you're not able to match up your bills and you get miserable you're hungry put in the 40 hours come on Saints put in the 40 hours oh hallelujah oh oh I I feel like reading again desperation is always calling for a subject right and when he find the subject no matter how faint that subject is the subject will receive that anointing but then what happen because desperation is pushing pushing oh faith will catch that but you got to mix that with love and then it produce what God want Glory oh my God thank you Jesus whoa Hallelujah the prophet said I believe go let me go further on just one more right one more quote he said and when notice Elijah the prophet on the dead baby right on the dead baby he said he laid on him over the bed baby the baby sneezed seven times what did he laid over he laid over desperation the baby come to life why because that desperation drove the woman to the prophet and Desperation drove the prophet to the baby so desperation in both of them drove to God and bring God on the sea but that has to come with love love for his people hallelujah glory god that has to come through love when you love God and love his people that's what brought the love of God down and he throw faith into the Battlefront and what will produce the work will take place oh God hallelujah amen all right hallah you got to learn to love God's people right we have all differences yeah but what you do love cast all of that way we going to see all men clearly from a pure mind Revelation chapter 10 the Bible says and Christ appeared in the form of a mighty Angel the rainbow the Covenant of Life The Covenant of Love that God has came down upon him he was the angel as he cried with a loud voice not a shout but a voice because that's where his sheep will hear because he said my sheep hear my voice as the king echoed a as a lion roared seven Thunders utter their voices glory to God their Li is a Rapture in faith that's why you said everything you got you have need of right now in this life journey is in you Hallelujah don't try to pull for nothing else it's already in you just drink the word and push it out hallelu glory to God that's what bring rapturing Faith not no great deep Revelation over here oh brother brle you are so deep deep deep I want I don't want to be deep I Want to Be Right Hallelujah God I want to be humble I want to be a loving person I want to love God's people love God and love God's people oh last night the Holy Spirit brought something to us so clearly I never even see it that way but the Bible said for as many as receive him John chapter 1:12 to them gave he power to become the sons of God oh you are already Son of God but the statement to become means you come up to maturity you come up to the adoption to receive him how do you receive Christ how do you receive Christ by confessing that Jesus is Lord how do you receive Christ by baptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ no Jesus said if you receive him that I said you receive me Hallelujah woo God you see you see that Jesus said if you receive if that I said you receive me thank you Jesus who am I to tell God I don't want the Ravens feed me God why didn't you send a bunch of doves but God said I command the Ravens it's against the norm because doves are clean Ravens are attracted to me amen God said I have I have commanded the widow woman she had nothing right everything she had was over why didn't God command that the the the governor of the herea of zapi to sustain you so that you can stay in a nice five star oh my you can have three meals a day but God send you in an empty house against a normal glory to God desperation brought John in the state where he said John go and take the book and eat it oh it's not going to be too Pleasant in the belly it will feel nice and sweet in the mouth it's going to taste real good but it's going to purge you it's purging you what is it doing uh it's putting you in another atmosphere you're going to get desperate to push it out again it's going to come out in Prophecy it's going to come out in Prophecy oh oh Hallelujah if the bride of Christ in this last days could understand and catch the agap of love of God Lord hallelujah and to realize that she has the secret of God she has dust said the Lord she has the word on her inside she cannot be programmed you cannot live and structure your life up through a pattern because God can come today and say something you never said yesterday that's right amen who is it that said to the children of Israel this is clean that's unclean this is clean that's unclean who said it Moses God and then God will look at Peter bring down the curtain the big sheet and show him a bunch of stuff and PR God come on this must be a nightmare no it's a vision this is not a nightmare it's a vision right I'm giving you an instruction kill and heat God Peter start to do some selection God this is clean this is unclean this is not right God said don't you ever call anything that I create unclean wow Hallelujah who is God who is he when you know God and you love God do you know you love everybody God he that love not knoweth not God for God is love so Jesus talking about faith so can we see the big picture beyond the Fig Tree dying he was just laying out Faith but he said with faith you got to have love and when you love you forgive because when you forgive you liberate yourself you know that when you forgive you liberate yourself you free yourself oh Lord you free yourself when you forgive you pure your mind you flush your system because you forgive leave it let God's avengeance is mine leave that to God you cannot be a child of God and have a revengeful heart a hated heart and you may take the phone up and you call did you hear this about Jared and Jared did this and your brother did that and your sister did that come on sints of God that's not the attribute of Christ Jesus Christ knew that Peter had something in him he's going into the garden to have prayer meeting and he tell to go buy a sword come on SS of God that's against nor how are you going to have prayer meeting and buy sword we don't need sword and prayer meeting and he said Peter why something in Peter need to change see Hallelujah with more as Peter cut the ears off of the enemy Christ put it back on Oh Glory to God woo Hallelujah such as I have I give in the name of Jesus put away your sword let's repair we're going to repair we're here to repair we're here to build we're here to give life what am I producing Faith what am I producing Faith that's the faith of God hallelujah what am I expressing the spoken word age that's what I'm expressing I'm going to say to that mountain move I'm going to say to that tree come over here how will that come forth I am expressing love first thank you lordes w God help us the reason the church is not desperate enough because the church lacks the love of God God it's so simple oh yes and without desperation we don't have this Faith sometime when you preach a word or you study a word it looks so simple isn't it I thought God because I don't know this even God because I don't read off the church age book God because I don't no God never said that he said the reason why we cannot produce that faith is because there is no desperation and he said because why there is no desperation he said we lack the love of God God so simple yes it is we may have indifferences but I must be able to shake your hand and said I love you thank you Lord we will never see the same thing no never you want to understand that read the book marthew Mark and Luke read all of it especially on on the resurrection they never see everything together who is right who is wrong who made an heror I have no time for that I want to express love out of oh Hallelujah GL I love you thank you Jesus Hallelujah can you say Thank You Lord thank you Lord Jesus can you say thank you Jesus thank you Jesus everything were created by Him

beyond our way of structuring how we ping ourselves we love to do it to me he enjoyed doing it glory to God many things Jesus would have said he never explain a word right there he just walk up and let it sometime the discip said Master you just drop that on them like that and you didn't even explain it Jesus said I didn't even want him to understand it because they're going to have eyes they won't see they will have ears I won't hear because if I tell them the truth they won't believe it so what's the sense but it's for you to know the mysteries of the kingom Hallelujah I'm glad for this
