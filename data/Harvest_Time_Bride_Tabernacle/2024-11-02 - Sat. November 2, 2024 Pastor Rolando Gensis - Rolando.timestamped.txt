[29:45] Jesus we
[29:47] pray
[29:49] amen amen you may have your seats for
[29:52] just a moment I I ask the musicians to
[29:55] St I want to sing uh we have come into
[29:57] his house house to magnify his name and
[30:00] worship him we just thank you from the
[30:03] bottom of our hearts for coming and God
[30:06] is good and we just uh it's amazing to
[30:11] have friends and to be a part of the
[30:13] family of God and you know there's many
[30:15] out of the home church for different
[30:17] reasons and activities and sisters
[30:19] Patty's mom had fell bad and she was
[30:22] going to see her at the hospital and
[30:24] different brother Jim and Junior will be
[30:27] here tomorrow and
[30:29] but we just know that God knew exactly
[30:32] who would be here and it was who was
[30:34] part of his plan
[30:36] and and it's an amazing message amazing
[30:39] truth that we have been blessed to be a
[30:42] part of and understand this Revelation I
[30:45] want to just share something just for a
[30:47] moment I know you didn't come to hear me
[30:49] and I didn't come to hear me
[30:52] either just a moment before we sing that
[30:55] song and invite our brothers
[30:58] we we preached a message on Sunday that
[31:01] I believe some people
[31:03] misunderstood and I want to quote
[31:05] something that brother Bram said when I
[31:06] preached on this he said that don't
[31:09] sound very good to you and he said I
[31:12] don't think you're getting
[31:14] it and in this message that we
[31:17] ministered
[31:18] on brother Bram mentioned this word 618
[31:23] times and he never mentioned it once
[31:26] until 53
[31:28] now his recording start what
[31:32] 45 and every year he mentioned it more
[31:35] and more and more when he got to 59 he
[31:37] mentioned a lot when he got to 60 he
[31:38] mentioned it almost every message 62 and
[31:42] 63 and that
[31:46] word is
[31:49] predestinated and let me read you a
[31:51] quote that brother Brown said you know
[31:53] he said humanity is always trying to do
[31:56] something to get saved
[31:59] but you never did nothing to be
[32:02] saved the minites are a lot more holy
[32:05] than the holiest person in this
[32:09] church that's hard for you to swallow
[32:12] but that's still the truth watch what
[32:15] the prophet said here he said there's a
[32:16] way my dear precious Nazarene brothers
[32:19] and so far you've left the
[32:22] mark why you're falling because you
[32:24] never moved with the light now brother
[32:26] Bram called preach destination a
[32:29] revelation you call election
[32:31] predestinated a revelation because you
[32:34] refuse to walk with the light that's
[32:36] exactly right that's exactly right he
[32:39] repeats it and he said you know the
[32:41] first altar that I ever kneeled at was
[32:43] an old Nazarene altar God bless them
[32:46] they're good holy clean
[32:49] people but you are so legalistic that
[32:52] you go and you must do this and you must
[32:56] do that and you must do the other and
[33:00] you don't realize that it's the grace
[33:02] that God that called you and elected you
[33:07] and it's not by them that willth or them
[33:10] that runneth but it's God it's not
[33:14] brother Dale but it's God that show us
[33:17] mercy and it's God that predestinated
[33:20] his church before the foundation of the
[33:21] world and we got a question on that in a
[33:24] few minutes and he said you can't take
[33:27] the thought and add one cubic to your
[33:30] stature no you can come and you can
[33:32] accept me the father no one can come to
[33:36] me except the father draws them you
[33:39] see it's God that did the calling and it
[33:43] was God that did the pulling and it was
[33:46] God that set the church in order and he
[33:48] said now you say brother Brown that's
[33:50] pure
[33:51] Calvinism he said no it isn't he said
[33:53] now wait you don't believe that that's
[33:56] God that takes them man up and just say
[33:59] here I am I'm going to pick you now
[34:02] watch this I want to just show you
[34:03] another couple short quotes he
[34:06] said here they asked brother brownman
[34:09] questions and answerers 63 they said
[34:12] what how will we know who will be saved
[34:16] in the end of the world and he said he
[34:19] said well all the Jews be actually the
[34:20] question is is it true that every Jew
[34:23] that's born since Christ into the world
[34:26] will be saved and he said
[34:28] no nothing will be saved only those
[34:31] whose names is on the Lamb's Book of
[34:34] Life before the foundation of the world
[34:37] now watch this he says
[34:39] Jew
[34:41] or
[34:44] Gentile
[34:46] amen and he said it's not one name but
[34:49] he said it's a great
[34:51] mystery and he mentions here I want to
[34:54] say he says
[34:58] he said it's a great mystery and he said
[35:00] no you can't see
[35:03] it you know we have to be so careful
[35:06] that we don't get religiously
[35:08] minded and you know I believe in
[35:10] Holiness the Bible says without Holiness
[35:12] no man will see
[35:14] God but if you just believe in Holiness
[35:17] you're going to have to explain to me
[35:18] the thief on the cross and King Saul
[35:21] because King Saul was killing David
[35:23] going to a witch to pray to the prophet
[35:25] and prophet Samuel said but you'll be
[35:27] with me in Paradise you and your sons it
[35:30] don't sound like a holy man to
[35:32] me but he was
[35:35] predestinated amen it's amazing grace
[35:40] that's what I'm trying to tell you it's
[35:41] amazing grace Amazing Grace I'm not con
[35:44] I'm not condoning King Saul I don't
[35:46] believe in killing Christians but the
[35:49] prophet said in the word of God that him
[35:51] and his sons would be with him in
[35:53] paradise and Jesus said this the thief
[35:56] on the cross God help help us God help
[35:59] us to understand and be able to move
[36:01] with the
[36:05] light you know we're the only message
[36:07] that understands
[36:10] predestination and everybody else
[36:12] believes they're saving by
[36:14] works and many in the
[36:16] message thinks that they're going to be
[36:18] saved by works too you know I had a
[36:21] minister tell me and I'm going to close
[36:23] with this we're going to sing Our Song
[36:24] you put the words up he said many
[36:26] believed in Elijah was the
[36:28] prophet and Elijah's day but only one
[36:32] got his
[36:37] mantle there'll be many that believe
[36:39] this message Are Holy people and they'll
[36:42] go to hell if their name ain't in the
[36:44] Lamb's Book of Life amen it's just
[36:48] Amazing Grace you can't put it in and
[36:50] you can't take it out praise God for
[36:52] that you can't put me in you can't put
[36:54] me out and I can't put you in and I
[36:56] can't take you out
[36:58] but we got to move with the light and I
[37:01] I challenge any of you to go look up
[37:04] predestinated 800 618 times and you'll
[37:09] see how it just is more and more and
[37:11] more and more and this last year or two
[37:13] it's mentioned dozens of times every

[45:42] Lord the bible say that all the

[46:51] 11 to
[46:53] 14 it says
[46:57] for the son of man is come to save that
[47:00] which was lost how think ye if a man
[47:04] have 100 sheep and one of them begun
[47:09] astray do not do he not leave the 0 and
[47:13] n and goeth into the mountains and
[47:17] seeketh that which is GH stray and if so
[47:21] be that he find it verily I say unto you
[47:25] he rejoiceth more that more of that ship
[47:30] than of the 90 and N which went not
[47:34] astray even so it is not the will of
[47:37] your father which is in heaven
[47:40] that one of these little ones should

[55:26] ship right Hallelujah the Lost ship and
[55:31] he he had gone astray right and
[55:36] uh uh separated disconnected from the

[55:57] Hallelujah it is not in us to look or to
[56:01] seek for God no it was God who seek us

[56:10] Hallelujah when when one ship was lost
[56:15] the shepherd left the 99 and then he
[56:19] looked for that onip H Allelujah and
[56:22] when he found it he said that he
[56:25] rejoiced more Hallelujah of that ship
[56:28] than of the 90 and N which went not
[56:32] astray Hallelujah and he says that even
[56:36] so it is not the will of your father
[56:39] which is in heaven that one of these
[56:41] little ones should perish no one in his
[56:46] ship should perish no one in his sons in
[56:51] his children Hallelujah should perish
[56:54] Hallelujah once you are a sheep right

[57:08] the beginning hallelujah hallelujah and
[57:10] your name is written in the Lamb's Book
[57:13] of Life Hallelujah

[57:23] to be redeemed and the prophet said that
[57:26] not all the people are redeemable yeah
[57:29] Hallelujah only those that came from him
[57:33] that were all that are part of him will
[57:36] be redeemed Hallelujah that's why

[57:42] life this evening if you have eternal
[57:44] life tonight you didn't have it when you
[57:47] believe him you have it Hallelujah

[1:08:31] Lord and have gone the way which the
[1:08:34] Lord sent me and have brought AOG the
[1:08:37] king of amalik and have utterly
[1:08:40] destroyed the amalekites it

[1:09:30] right wow Rebellion right Hallelujah wow
[1:09:35] you know brothers and
[1:09:37] sisters help Lord did Soul make any

[1:09:59] Witchcraft and
[1:10:00] stubbornness is as iniquity and
[1:10:04] idolatry Hallelujah then Samuel said

[1:10:10] the Lord he had also rejected thee from
[1:10:14] being King wow Amen Hallelujah by
[1:10:18] rejecting the word of the Lord you are
[1:10:21] now disconnected with God Amen you are
[1:10:25] now separated with God there has been a
[1:10:28] bridge between him and God hallelujah
[1:10:31] just like David you know you remember
[1:10:34] David his intention is Right Hallelujah
[1:10:37] to bring the ark Hallelujah back to
[1:10:40] Israel but he brought it
[1:10:43] in different way than what hallelujah
[1:10:47] amen the way of the Lord told them
[1:10:50] Hallelujah and the Bible said there were
[1:10:53] there had been a bridge between God and
[1:10:56] the People
[1:10:58] Israel Hallelujah just a a small you
[1:11:01] know a little
[1:11:04] disobedient
[1:11:06] Hallelujah a
[1:11:08] little
[1:11:11] unbelief it will cause disconnection
[1:11:15] Amen
[1:11:16] Hallelujah by disobeying because of this
[1:11:19] obeying God's
[1:11:21] word and now you can imagine brothers
[1:11:24] and sisters after
[1:11:28] that Samuel told Saul that God had
[1:11:32] rejected you and maybe Soul he still
[1:11:37] looks like a king you
[1:11:40] know he is still on his throne wearing
[1:11:45] the the robe of a king yeah there you go
[1:11:49] Hallelujah doing the service of a
[1:11:53] king and maybe the people still regarded
[1:11:58] him as
[1:11:59] king but in the sight of
[1:12:02] God hallelujah he is no longer a king he
[1:12:06] was
[1:12:07] separated Hallelujah from
[1:12:15] God and because of his unrepining Spirit
[1:12:20] you know right instead that uh amen he
[1:12:24] had to repent
[1:12:26] right and he got jealous you know you
[1:12:28] know and he had
[1:12:30] been seeking for the life of David you
[1:12:35] know
[1:12:37] his connection with God was totally cut
[1:12:41] off and he no longer heard any words
[1:12:45] from the
[1:12:46] Lord H Allelujah amen and then he went
[1:12:52] into the wit of indor
[1:12:57] witchcraft which is an Abomination
[1:13:00] before God it means from one sin he
[1:13:04] added another sin Hallelujah instead
[1:13:09] of humbling himself repenting himself
[1:13:13] Hallelujah
[1:13:15] accepting the sin that he had done and
[1:13:18] he did not repent brothers and
[1:13:22] sisters and because of that but he died
[1:13:26] in a horrible death yes Hallelujah
[1:13:30] although he didn't lost his salvation
[1:13:34] right because when he in when he
[1:13:37] inquired Samuel through the wi of indor
[1:13:41] right Hallelujah Samuel said tomorrow he
[1:13:45] will be with me amen it
[1:13:47] means if Samuel was in hell then Saul
[1:13:53] was will be in hell but if Samuel will
[1:13:56] be in heaven Saul is with him
[1:14:00] then he will be in
[1:14:02] heaven

[1:19:44] Cornersville did you pray go around and
[1:19:47] get the neighbors and have little prayer
[1:19:50] meetings we forgot those things and
[1:19:54] that's that's why we get in
[1:19:57] trouble now he says they went seven days
[1:20:02] out into the Wilderness never pit no
[1:20:05] compass and come to find out they got in
[1:20:08] trouble yeah they went without
[1:20:12] consulting God and all the water supply
[1:20:16] was cut off yeah
[1:20:19] Hallelujah instead of Consulting God
[1:20:23] seeking his perfect will in everything
[1:20:26] that we do Hallelujah right and they
[1:20:31] didn't do it and that's the reason the
[1:20:34] water supply Supply was cut off that's
[1:20:38] the matter with the church tonight the
[1:20:40] water supply is cut off trying to carry
[1:20:43] the church the church on without the
[1:20:47] supernatural trying to try to carry the
[1:20:50] church on just in its
[1:20:53] natural trying to pattern after the
[1:20:56] other churches of the world and that's
[1:20:59] the reason we are not having the
[1:21:03] blessings we used to
[1:21:10] have and sometimes not only that but
[1:21:15] sometimes uh we want to do
[1:21:19] something and we feel that there is a
[1:21:24] red light in our hearts right giving us
[1:21:28] warning not to cross Hallelujah
[1:21:32] right that's why brother said that uh
[1:21:35] going to hell not is is not easy right
[1:21:39] you have to cross that red light
[1:21:42] Hallelujah that's because God will will
[1:21:45] warn you not to do it he will and then
[1:21:48] you force it
[1:21:51] Hallelujah true and he said Remember the
[1:21:54] first time you heard the Hy sang at
