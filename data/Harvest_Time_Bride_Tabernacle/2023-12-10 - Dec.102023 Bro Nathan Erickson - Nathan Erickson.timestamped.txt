[25:00] with you again and uh spent a couple
[25:02] years the last time I I don't remember
[25:04] what year was exactly I know it was
[25:06] covid times and and uh trying to get
[25:09] home a bunch of crazy Canadians on their
[25:11] tractors had the bridge blocked so I had
[25:13] to go down to uh cross over at Detroit
[25:15] and it sure was an adventure so uh this
[25:18] time it was a little smoother sailing
[25:20] and my it's just wonderful we can be
[25:22] more free to get together and fellowship
[25:24] amen appreciate brother Dale inviting us
[25:27] and and uh the just the fellowship with
[25:29] the langstaff family you amen we say God
[25:32] bless you bring you warm greetings from
[25:34] home from True Word Tabernacle Brother
[25:36] Ray Erikson uh just had his 85th
[25:38] birthday yesterday he's uh uh his Caleb
[25:42] birthday Four score and five and this
[25:45] year he's uh he's kind of retired or
[25:47] moved to like a senior pastor position
[25:50] brother Wayne Lawson we vote him in as
[25:51] the pastor for the future we're just
[25:53] thankful For What the Lord Has Done and
[25:55] what he has in store also greetings for
[25:57] from your friend brother Mike Allen amen
[25:59] your good buddy who comes up here quite
[26:01] often to minister amen uh we just bring
[26:04] love and greetings from the Saints I
[26:07] won't keep you too long standing let's
[26:08] just go right to the word of
[26:10] God Amen in uh 1 Corinthians chapter
[26:16] 12 and just trust in the Lord for his
[26:19] grace
[26:20] today 1 Corinthians chapter 12 we'll
[26:24] start at Verse
[26:26] 18
[26:31] amen and we'll read down to the 25th
[26:34] verse the Bible says but now hath God
[26:37] set the members every one of them in the
[26:40] body as it hath pleased him and if they
[26:44] were all one member then where were the
[26:46] body but now are they many members yet
[26:49] but one body now of course he's saying
[26:52] now being members of the body of Christ
[26:54] if we were all the same part in the body
[26:55] it wouldn't be much of a body
[26:58] right but he says so the eye can't say
[27:00] to the hand I have no need of thee uh
[27:03] nor again the head to the feet I have no
[27:06] need of you n he says much more those
[27:08] members of the body which seem to be
[27:10] more feeble they are necessary and those
[27:14] members of the body which we think to be
[27:16] less
[27:17] honorable uh upon these we bestore more
[27:20] abundant honor my and our uncomely parts
[27:24] have more abundant comeliness so the way
[27:27] that God values things we find out right
[27:29] away is not the way that it's not
[27:31] according to our own
[27:33] evaluation amen uh so he says for our
[27:36] comely Parts have no need but God hath
[27:39] tempered the body together having given
[27:41] more abundant honor to that part to that
[27:44] part which lacked that there should be
[27:46] no Schism in the body but that the
[27:49] members should have the same care one
[27:52] for another amen don't you love him
[27:55] don't you want love one another let's
[27:57] before we pray let's turn to Ephesians
[27:59] chapter 3 and just take my text
[28:01] today Ephesians chapter 3: 8 and
[28:09] 9 now Paul will will begin to speak of
[28:13] this great
[28:14] mystery amen which is hidden in the word
[28:16] of God to be revealed in the end time
[28:19] amen a great Revelation which will make
[28:22] the Bible a new book Paul says unto me
[28:25] who am less than the least of All Saints
[28:27] is this Grace given that I should preach
[28:31] among the Gentiles The unsearchable
[28:33] Riches of Christ and to make all men see
[28:37] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[28:40] which from the beginning of the world
[28:42] hath been hidden God who created All
[28:45] Things by Jesus Christ Now That Word
[28:48] Fellowship is sometimes translated as
[28:52] economy it's an interchange it's a it's
[28:55] an it's it's an economy it's it's sort
[28:57] of a group thing and so uh and that's
[29:01] where we get that phrase that we've
[29:02] heard uh you know over the years people

[30:28] morning on God's economy God's economy
[30:32] and Paul has said that uh that it it
[30:35] fell to him in his ministry as one of
[30:38] the as one of the messengers of the
[30:40] church and the one that would set the
[30:41] pattern for all of the messengers down
[30:43] through the seven Church ages that that
[30:45] uh that he would he would preach these
[30:47] UNC searchable Riches of Christ so that
[30:49] all men would be able to see The

[30:55] of the mystery now now that that word
[30:58] Fellowship there as I've said is
[31:00] sometimes in uh it's translated to mean
[31:03] an economy an economy and so so there's
[31:07] an economy of this mystery and uh and
[31:10] and so when we think about the
[31:12] revelation of the mystery we don't think
[31:14] of it as a singular thing we don't just
[31:16] think of it as something that happens in
[31:18] one man or one person or one Ministry or
[31:21] one church amen but it is there's an
[31:23] economy to this mystery in other words
[31:26] everybody is a participant that it's a
[31:29] it's group participation everybody has a
[31:32] part to play in the economy of God to to
[31:35] to reveal this mystery and I've been
[31:37] I've been ministering around different
[31:38] places a lot on God and morphe how many
[31:41] know brother brandom teaches that about
[31:42] God and morphe in this age now God it
[31:46] means that God in a mass God in a
[31:48] different form uh uh when the Bible says
[31:51] uh that Jesus Christ thought it not
[31:53] robbery to be equal with God but he was
[31:55] in the form of God Amen it was God in
[31:58] the form of a man right God and morphe
[32:01] changing his mask and so we find out
[32:04] everything that the that the message is
[32:05] teaching us and just to just to not to
[32:08] go too deep into these things but but
[32:10] just to lay a little Foundation this
[32:11] morning we find that we're living in a
[32:14] very crucial hour there's a there the
[32:17] you may not think so but and it may not
[32:19] appear from the outside but it's a very
[32:21] very important time for the people of
[32:23] God Amen because God has has changed his
[32:27] mask once again Amen in this great drama
[32:30] that's been playing out ever since God
[32:32] said let there be light he set the stage
[32:34] and he has changed his mask from Prophet
[32:37] unto prophet and from messenger unto
[32:39] messenger he has changed his mask and
[32:41] played different parts uh all in a
[32:44] progressive revelation of himself
[32:46] there's a there's a mystery that's in
[32:48] God there are things about God that are
[32:50] mysterious one day but then after he
[32:52] manifested they become revealed one day
[32:54] it was a mystery amen that God was a A
[32:57] Healer nobody knew that God had had the
[32:59] power and the and the will to heal human
[33:01] beings until he came and he manifested
[33:04] that he was a Healer amen and then they
[33:06] found out that god Jehovah was not just
[33:08] a God but he's a god healer he's Jehovah
[33:11] Rafa amen amen there was a time when we
[33:14] did not know that God was a provider
[33:16] amen but but uh uh we knew that he was
[33:18] Jehovah but we didn't know that he was a
[33:20] provider until it came time that Abraham
[33:23] needed a ram amen he needed a a
[33:25] sacrifice there was something that was
[33:27] required that that man did not have the
[33:29] ability to produce and so God comes down
[33:32] and he provides Abraham a ram and we
[33:34] find out he's not just Jehovah he's
[33:36] Jehovah Gyra he's my provider and so see
[33:39] God is in the business of revealing
[33:41] himself God is in the business of taking
[33:43] things that are a mystery within himself
[33:46] and then and what he wants to do is not
[33:47] have it remain a mystery but he wants to
[33:50] manifest it so that people on the Earth
[33:52] could receive the revelation of it and
[33:54] they could understand him in a way that
[33:56] they didn't understand him yesterday
[33:58] amen amen and see that's happening right
[34:00] now today God has sent a prophet Amen to
[34:03] reveal amen The Mystery of the word in
[34:06] the days of the voice of the seventh
[34:07] angel the mystery God is supposed to be
[34:09] finished it's so it's supposed to be
[34:11] fully revealed until the Bible would
[34:13] become a new book to us and and the
[34:15] things that were hidden down through
[34:16] ages all the Loose Ends would be tied up
[34:18] and we would have a perfect revelation
[34:20] of the word is that right amen and how
[34:23] many believe that we've had a prophet
[34:24] that that that revealed the mystery of
[34:26] God amen but see but see God Amen has
[34:30] not stopped revealing things since
[34:33] 1965 God has not stopped his
[34:35] self-revelation he's never ceased to
[34:37] reveal himself amen but we find out that
[34:39] that there was more mystery in the in
[34:42] the heart of God than Doctrine amen
[34:44] there was more of there was more to the
[34:47] mystery than the right kind of water
[34:48] baptism amen amen we're building towards
[34:51] something now there was more in the
[34:53] mystery of God's mind amen than than the
[34:56] right uh revelation of the godhead there
[34:58] was more in the mystery of God's mind
[35:01] amen than than uh than you know serpent
[35:03] seed and these things amen but there
[35:06] were there were people whose names amen
[35:09] were recorded in his mind before the
[35:11] foundation of the world and that's you
[35:13] my brother that's you my sister you were
[35:15] in him the Bible says chosen in him
[35:17] before the foundation of the world Amen
[35:20] but see back then you were a mystery
[35:22] amen but now God has changed his mask
[35:25] amen and he has mased himself not just
[35:27] in church Messengers not just in the
[35:30] ministry of a prophet not just in the
[35:32] five-fold ministry but he has masked his
[35:34] spirit in the bride body of Jesus Christ
[35:38] and you in your own life amen are
[35:40] revealing something amen that was hidden
[35:42] in God before the foundation of the
[35:44] world you might think that your
[35:45] Christian walk doesn't matter you might
[35:47] think that it's insignificant the world
[35:49] might not see it your church your fellow
[35:51] church members may not acknowledge it
[35:53] amen but what is happening spiritually
[35:55] in you as a son or daughter of God is
[35:58] the Revelation amen of a of a thought
[36:01] amen it's a it's the speaking of
[36:03] something that God thought before the
[36:05] foundation of the world Amen there is
[36:07] nobody in God in the body of Christ
[36:10] there's nobody in the bride of Christ
[36:12] whose life doesn't matter or whose work
[36:14] doesn't matter or whose Ministry doesn't
[36:16] matter why because it's God's economy
[36:19] Amen to reveal the mystery that was in
[36:21] him before the foundation of the world
[36:24] hallelujah amen you are a ask for the
[36:27] word of God in this hour this message
[36:29] wasn't just meant to be talked about it
[36:31] wasn't just a church that we would join
[36:33] it wasn't just a lifestyle to raise our
[36:35] children under amen but it was a
[36:37] revelation it was a quickening of a sea
[36:39] that was on the inside of you amen that
[36:42] the word that this message amen would
[36:44] not only exist in the ministry of a
[36:47] prophet but it would be masked Amen in
[36:49] the life and in the body and in the
[36:52] vessels of human beings amen before the
[36:55] amen just before the the coming of the
[36:57] Lord You're a mask for this word and
[36:59] you're giving life to a mysterious
[37:01] purpose that he had in his mind be way
[37:03] back before the foundation of the world
[37:05] brother Bram said you being a part of
[37:08] God's Gene how many believe you're a
[37:10] gene
[37:10] seed then he said you're a part of the
[37:13] word and other men are a part of the
[37:15] word God's word and seated together it
[37:18] manifests the entire body of Christ you
[37:22] say brother Nathan I'm looking for the
[37:24] coming of the Lord and I'm looking for a
[37:26] 7 foot Jesus in the sky with a Robee and
[37:28] sandals brother sister don't miss don't
[37:31] miss now we don't do away with the of
[37:32] course the physical coming of the Lord
[37:34] and the Rapture amen but there but
[37:36] there's an appearing before the coming
[37:38] amen amen there's prophesied that God
[37:41] and his bride would be so one until it
[37:43] would be Christ himself manifested in a
[37:45] bride body amen you're manifesting the
[37:48] entire body of Christ so it makes you as
[37:51] an individual very very
[37:54] special very very important the part
[37:56] that you play is very very crucial
[37:59] because the Mi the mystery is an economy
[38:02] I hope it's clear where I'm where I'm
[38:03] going with this today it's an economy
[38:06] amen and you know the thing about a an
[38:08] economy is participation is not an
[38:12] option
[38:14] participation is not an option let's
[38:16] just think naturally speaking now we all
[38:17] know what it is to live in a in in a in
[38:20] a modern day economy right and and and
[38:23] and you find out that this economy that
[38:25] we live in of worldly finances and
[38:28] production and goods and and trade and
[38:30] all those things it takes everybody or
[38:33] it doesn't
[38:34] work everybody's required or it doesn't
[38:36] work you see somebody has got to you
[38:39] know design the airplane and somebody's
[38:41] got to design the car and somebody's got
[38:43] to put gas in it and somebody's got to
[38:45] turn the nuts to put it together and
[38:47] somebody's got to somebody's got to you
[38:49] know uh somebody's got to clean it and
[38:51] somebody you somebody's got to you you
[38:53] you say well you know what I'm going to
[38:55] do brother Nathan I'm going to go off
[38:56] grid and I'm going to be a homesteader
[38:59] and I'm going to get I'm going to get
[39:00] off grid I'm going to get out of this
[39:01] economy I'm going to I'm not going to be
[39:03] dependent on anything and you know like
[39:05] brother Jared you got a nice Farm going
[39:07] there you got your own animals that you
[39:08] can eat and you're planting your own
[39:09] crops that you can eat and you could
[39:11] feed your animals and everything but but
[39:13] you got to have some electricity you got
[39:15] to have it you got to you know you you
[39:17] got to have a vehicle amen and that
[39:19] vehicle you couldn't you know you
[39:20] couldn't go in your Backwoods and build
[39:22] a vehicle even if the iron was laying
[39:25] there it's got to be fined and it's got
[39:27] to be smelted and it's got to be formed
[39:29] and it's got to be for so everybody's
[39:31] got to participate to make the economy
[39:34] work is that right you can't just not be
[39:36] a part of it you've got to be you'll
[39:37] starve to death you've got to work and
[39:40] you've got to play your part amen so to
[39:42] be part of the economy so that you can
[39:43] eat so that you can enjoy good things
[39:45] and all those kind of things and that's
[39:47] the way it is naturally but spiritually
[39:49] brother sister it's the same way amen if
[39:52] God Amen had in his mind that there
[39:54] would be an economy of the revealing of
[39:56] the mystery in the end time amen then it
[39:58] wouldn't be for you and I to just sit on
[40:00] our hands and let the preacher do all
[40:02] the preaching and let the singer do all
[40:04] the singing amen and and let the let
[40:06] somebody else say amen and just live a
[40:09] comfortable Christian churchgoing Life
[40:11] brother sister participation is not an
[40:14] option amen but it is required that we
[40:17] would all catch the revelation of this
[40:19] mystery and realize that you and I each
[40:22] have a very vital part to play in the
[40:24] revelation of the very heart of God in
[40:27] this
[40:28] hour Hallelujah say brother Nathan but
[40:30] I'm not you know I'm not I'm not
[40:32] important I don't have an office in the
[40:34] church and I don't have a great gift but
[40:36] I'll tell you what you are brother brah
[40:38] said you were a son or daughter of God
[40:40] before there was a moon before there
[40:42] were stars before there was a molecule
[40:45] you say oh I'm not important how could
[40:47] you be unimportant when you're Sons and
[40:49] Daughters of God for you're only the
[40:51] physical manifestation of the attributes
[40:54] that were in God at the beginning
[40:56] brother Bram said there's only one form
[40:58] of eternal life and that was you
[41:01] before I just love that that was you
[41:05] before the only form of eternal life in
[41:07] the image of God you are
[41:09] made and you are manifested for the
[41:12] glory and The Fellowship Of God and as
[41:16] sure as your Gene had to be in your
[41:18] father before your natural birth he said
[41:20] your spiritual Gene had to be in God
[41:23] Amen because you're an expression of the
[41:26] attributes of his thoughts before the
[41:28] foundation of the world and I like what
[41:29] he says now no way around
[41:33] it No Way Around
[41:36] It Hallelujah if you were in his mind
[41:38] and you're a genan seed of the father
[41:40] you've got to be expressed you've got to
[41:43] reach your potential you've got to come
[41:45] to life in this age and do what you were
[41:47] called to do and fulfill the purpose
[41:49] that you were created for amen there's
[41:51] no way around it brother sister the
[41:53] economy participation is not an option
[41:55] amen it's the economy of God if you are
[41:58] in the mind of God you've got to be part
[42:00] of the unveiling cuz if he thought you
[42:02] back there if he doesn't speak you now
[42:04] and you don't and you don't exist now
[42:07] and you don't manifest yourself now then
[42:09] the mystery is not revealed amen it's
[42:11] not revealed without a brother Jared
[42:13] it's not revealed without a brother
[42:14] Julie a sister Julie amen it's a it's
[42:17] not fully revealed until every one of us
[42:20] amen has has manifested what was in
[42:23] God's thinking before the foundation of
[42:25] the world Amen because the seventh
[42:27] Angel's message was to reveal the entire
[42:29] Min mystery as I said not just mysteries
[42:32] of Doctrine not just mysteries of belief
[42:34] amen or or Bible teaching not just
[42:37] mysteries of prophets and pastors and
[42:39] preachers amen but to everyone that sits
[42:42] in a Pew Amen to everybody that feeds on
[42:44] the message of the hour to everyone
[42:46] who's a member of the Bride of Jesus
[42:48] Christ this mystery is unto you and
[42:51] you're a part of the mystery amen and if
[42:54] God s you before the foundation of the
[42:55] world then when he speaks you now you're
[42:58] nothing less than the spoken word of God
[43:01] manifested that's where we're living
[43:03] right now we're living in the big reveal
[43:05] brother Bram said this is the time when
[43:07] he takes the mask off the whole thing
[43:09] Hallelujah he's unmasked himself where
[43:12] in The Bride of Jesus
[43:14] Christ and so it's manifesting time
[43:18] every single attribute has got to be
[43:19] revealed whatever seed is in you it's
[43:22] got to bear fruit it's got to bear fruit
[43:25] watch this this now in the first deal
[43:27] brother Braham talks about the lamb you
[43:30] know after Jesus died how many know he
[43:32] went to the throne and he and he's began
[43:34] a work of
[43:35] intercession and in in a time of
[43:37] intercessory there brother Bram said he
[43:39] knew there were names there that were
[43:41] put there from the foundation of the
[43:43] world a question I've asked myself many
[43:46] times I say you know if Jesus came 2,000
[43:49] years ago and died to forgive our sins
[43:51] to pay the price to cover all all sins
[43:54] For All Mankind that whosoever whoever
[43:56] will could believe un salvation on the
[43:58] name of the Lord Jesus Christ 2,000
[44:00] years ago he did that doesn't it make
[44:02] you wonder what we're still doing here
[44:04] sometimes don't shouldn't it make
[44:06] shouldn't it make the Believers
[44:07] shouldn't it make religious people
[44:09] shouldn't make you know Christian
[44:11] Christianity Marvel to say then why are
[44:13] we still here 2,000 years later why are
[44:15] we still here and why are we still going
[44:17] on and why do we still come to church
[44:19] and why do we read our B and why do we
[44:21] do all this thing why didn't Jesus take
[44:23] us all back home 2,000 years ago amen
[44:26] why why why why is he laid there before
[44:29] the throne doing a work of inter why so
[44:31] long what's going on what's been
[44:34] happening all this time watch this now
[44:37] but brother Bram said he knew that there
[44:38] were
[44:39] names amen that were put on his book
[44:42] before the foundation of the world and
[44:44] as long as those names had never been
[44:47] manifested on Earth as yet he had to
[44:50] stay there as an intercessor as long as
[44:52] there was one name that had not been
[44:55] declared in Earth
[44:56] Christ had to stay as an intercessor to
[44:59] take care of that name oh brother sister
[45:02] amen God thought you he knew your name
[45:04] before the foundation of the world Amen
[45:07] he put your name on the Lamb's Book of
[45:09] Life amen and as long as that name has
[45:11] not been manifested yet amen then all of
[45:14] the Judgment of God is held back the
[45:16] Rapture can't come brother sister
[45:18] nothing can happen until every member of
[45:20] this bride is manifested in this day
[45:23] until each of us are quickened to that
[45:26] seed comes to life and bears fruit and
[45:28] we reach the potential God called us to
[45:30] walk in then brother sister you see how
[45:32] vital you are to the economy of God this
[45:35] thing doesn't run without you this thing
[45:37] doesn't run it doesn't it doesn't
[45:38] function it won't reach the goal you see
[45:41] without a bride brother Braham said when
[45:43] the bride recognizes her position when
[45:45] she recognizes who she is that's the
[45:47] when the Rapture will go he didn't say
[45:50] it would come he said but when you
[45:51] recognize who you are it'll go amen and
[45:55] brother sister you see you see how
[45:57] crucial it is then that we understand
[45:59] who we are and that we understand how
[46:02] how important amen uh our part in this
[46:04] economy is because without a bride
[46:07] manifestation there is no Rapture
[46:09] without a bride manifestation there is
[46:11] no Millennial Reign without a bride
[46:13] manifestation there's no thousand years
[46:14] of Peace amen there's no there's no Gog
[46:17] and Magog there's no new heavens and no
[46:19] new Earth without you brother sister the
[46:22] Bride of Jesus Christ revealing man
[46:26] esting the mystery that he had in his
[46:27] mind before the foundation of the world
[46:29] how could we feel insignificant today
[46:31] amen when God has called
[46:34] us he has called us he has elected us he
[46:37] has predestinated us to be the final
[46:40] voice to the final age living out the
[46:44] final
[46:45] Revelation amen revealing the final
[46:48] mystery and he said so he stays there as
[46:51] an intercessor to take care of that name
[46:54] Hallelujah so many times I feel like
[46:57] maybe maybe if it was up to me I
[46:59] couldn't make it just like you feel many
[47:01] times you say oh brother Nathan I just I
[47:03] don't feel like I could make it I don't
[47:05] feel like I have the strength I doubt
[47:08] myself I doubt my position I doubt all
[47:10] all we have many doubts about ourselves
[47:13] amen but we know this that he's going to
[47:15] take care of that name he'll do the
[47:17] taking care he'll do the holding on
[47:19] he'll do the leading amen he'll do the
[47:21] guiding he'll do the delivering amen
[47:24] he'll he'll bring the power you just
[47:26] bring the name amen you just bring
[47:28] yourself and and lay under this message
[47:31] and let it reveal to you who you are and
[47:33] what you are put on this Earth to be and
[47:35] what you are put on this Earth to do and
[47:37] realize that your part in this amen is
[47:40] just as important as any Prophet uh amen
[47:43] or any Ministry or anybody in the
[47:46] economy of God and you say well but I'm
[47:49] feeble amen I I I'm less comely but that
[47:53] but in God's economy you're more Val
[47:55] valuable you are more you're given more
[47:58] honor Amen to live that simple Christian
[48:01] life amen and fulfill what you were
[48:04] called to fulfill the Bride of Jesus
[48:05] Christ is this okay today amen
[48:10] hallelujah no way around it so you can't
[48:13] be halfway in this message and halfway
[48:15] out you can't just be riding the fence
[48:17] you've got to manifest what you are this
[48:19] is not the message is not a church that
[48:21] you join the message is not a lifestyle
[48:23] it's not a Creed it's not a SL better
[48:26] church with slightly better Doctrine
[48:28] right uh to be a message believer
[48:30] doesn't mean that that you're like a
[48:31] Baptist but you're a little bit Freer in
[48:33] the spirit it doesn't mean that you're a
[48:35] Pentecostal but you got a little bit
[48:37] better Church order that's not what it
[48:38] means brother sister but it means that
[48:41] amen God before the foundation of the
[48:43] world had a person in his mind amen he
[48:47] they had a certain color hair they had a
[48:49] certain stature oh I'm getting ahead of
[48:51] myself amen he designed them a very
[48:53] specific way amen so so that oh and he
[48:56] thought about it amen but today he's not
[48:59] thinking about it he has spoken
[49:02] it Hallelujah and our existence on this
[49:05] Earth is the Revelation and the
[49:07] manifestation of the mystery of his
[49:09] thinking before the beginning of the
[49:11] world hallelujah amen oh and he's taking
[49:15] care of your name Hallelujah see a word
[49:19] is a thought expressed and we talk a lot
[49:21] about around the message about well we
[49:23] have the word the word the word you know
[49:25] we got the word brother Nathan we don't
[49:27] need a you know we don't need any of
[49:29] that spiritual stuff we don't need the
[49:31] Holy Ghost and we don't need the moving
[49:33] of the spirit all that now we have the
[49:34] word brother sister amen you got to
[49:37] realize you are the
[49:39] word you are the word amen and you've
[49:43] been expressed Amen to manifest
[49:45] something to be something you say we got
[49:47] the word I say Mark 16 is in the word
[49:50] acts 238 is in the word amen these signs
[49:53] shall follow them that believe the word
[49:55] word amen the spirit leads them that are
[49:58] in the word hallelujah we've got the
[50:01] word and it means something brother
[50:02] sister it means that you are the word
[50:05] hallelujah and that means all that the
[50:07] potential of the spoken word is in you
[50:10] brother Bram said it was enough power to
[50:12] create a world and go live on it amen
[50:14] we'll Circle back to that quote in a bit
[50:16] but see now notice brother Bram said the
[50:18] word had to be
[50:20] manifested and when the word is
[50:23] manifested that's what God sends a
[50:24] prophet for
[50:26] talks about Moses was called to his job
[50:28] and he said and nobody else could do it
[50:31] there's nobody can take your place with
[50:33] your
[50:35] peculiarity now how many have some
[50:38] peculiarities we're all A peculiar
[50:40] people right some of us more than others
[50:44] amen but watch brother brandom he says
[50:46] now how often you think well if there
[50:48] should be anybody secure in their
[50:50] position it ought to be the messenger
[50:52] but brother Bram said often I wondered
[50:54] he said I how I would like to take oral
[50:56] Robert's place he said I would like to
[50:59] take Billy Graham's place somebody like
[51:02] that you see brother brandom had other
[51:04] people that he would look at he'd say
[51:06] now if I was a little more like that
[51:07] then I'd be
[51:08] somebody now if I was a little bit more
[51:11] like brother Dale if I was a little more
[51:13] like sister Julie or this one or that
[51:15] one well then I'd really be somebody
[51:17] then I'd really you know uh uh uh uh see
[51:19] but but brother Bram says but I can't be
[51:21] Billy
[51:22] Graham but neither can Billy Graham be
[51:25] me
[51:27] I can't be Oral Roberts but Oral Roberts
[51:29] can't be me and brother Bram said you
[51:31] are each one set in God's economy just
[51:34] for its place oh my like a little sister
[51:37] came to brother brandom and she said
[51:38] brother brandom I fasted and prayed and
[51:40] fasted and prayed and I'm still never
[51:41] cast out a devil he said well sister
[51:44] yeah that's not how it works you're
[51:46] supposed to fast and pray so that I can
[51:48] cast out a devil brother B said one
[51:51] fasts all the time and communes with God
[51:53] and another one casts out Devils cuz
[51:54] this one is is fasting but it's the
[51:56] whole body of Christ working together
[51:59] that's the unity brother sister it's so
[52:01] beautiful that you are you and I are an
[52:04] authentic we are a one-of-a-kind uh
[52:07] creation of God's expression and God
[52:10] doesn't do anything halfway I don't care
[52:12] how you value it in God's economy amen
[52:15] it's valued it's important it's vital
[52:19] amen it's Irreplaceable your part in the
[52:22] economy of God no notice now brother
[52:25] talks about we'll just uh we'll just
[52:27] paraphrase these quotes how that your
[52:28] name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[52:30] before the foundation of the world and
[52:32] he said and the color of hair that you
[52:34] have the color eyes that you have the
[52:36] stature that you're in now some of you
[52:38] would like to be two inches taller amen
[52:40] but see the stature that you're in God
[52:42] saw before the foundation of the world
[52:45] Amen and he seen you a human being like
[52:48] you are isn't that beautiful brother
[52:50] sister when God chose you he didn't just
[52:52] before the foundation of the world spin
[52:54] the wheel and let
[52:56] it click and it pulled up your number it
[53:00] wasn't a lottery of chance it was not a
[53:02] blind selection you have been designed
[53:04] brother sister you have been shaped you
[53:07] have been molded in the mind of God he
[53:09] knew what color hair he wanted you to
[53:11] have he knew what he wanted you to look
[53:13] like he knew how he wanted you made how
[53:15] you would stand how tall or short you
[53:17] would be Hallelujah he knew all of those
[53:20] things amen and and and he saw that
[53:22] image before the foundational world he
[53:24] said put that one on my book that one
[53:26] will fit perfectly in my economy that
[53:29] one will do the job just right
[53:31] hallelujah oh my amen he talked about
[53:35] the Bell maker is that right how the
[53:38] Bell maker he would mix brass and iron
[53:40] and and copper and all these things and
[53:42] mix these metals and every Bell gets a
[53:45] different mixture amen but he mixes it
[53:47] differently so it'll have just the right
[53:49] sound when he strikes it and makes just
[53:52] the right sound amen there are things
[53:54] that you've got more of than I do but
[53:56] then there's other things I've got more
[53:58] of a mixture than you do amen and it's
[54:00] all different ratios but it's built to
[54:02] be in harmony it's built to be a
[54:04] symphony amen and nobody's unimportant
[54:07] in the Symphony of God Amen because he's
[54:10] a master musician he's a master composer
[54:13] he knows how to make things beautiful if
[54:15] we would just play our
[54:17] part you know and when it comes to a
[54:20] great Symphony Orchestra you know
[54:22] somebody's got to be the lead violin and
[54:24] they play that solo and it just fills
[54:27] the house with music you know and
[54:29] everybody's crying and and it and and
[54:31] it's powerful and the spotlights on him
[54:33] and then there's one guy in the back who
[54:36] sits there for two
[54:38] hours never makes a sound until just the
[54:41] right time and he pulls out that
[54:42] triangle he goes
[54:45] Bing but see without that Ting amen then
[54:48] the symphon is not complete and the art
[54:51] form is not expressed and what was in
[54:53] the mind of the composer is not perfect
[54:55] perfect if somebody doesn't play the
[54:57] triangle Hallelujah and in the eyes of
[54:59] the composer amen it's just as beautiful
[55:02] as the lead violin it's just as valuable
[55:05] it's not perfect without it that's why
[55:08] brother Bram said if God would lose you
[55:09] he would no longer be God if he lost one
[55:11] of his thoughts he would not be perfect
[55:15] amen because the thoughts of an eternal
[55:17] God are Eternal and they are attributes
[55:20] of him how beautiful how beautiful amen
[55:24] see there's a lot of times we look in
[55:26] the mirror I I do anyway I look in the
[55:29] mirror and I see some stuff I don't want
[55:32] I see a lot of extra you know I see a
[55:34] lot of things I'd like to rearrange when
[55:37] I look in the mirror but see God is
[55:40] getting what he
[55:41] wanted now now what's more important to
[55:44] a believer that we would see what we
[55:47] want or that God would get what he
[55:50] wants amen that God would get what he
[55:52] wants wo oh my you know brother BR
[55:57] talked about your eyes your stature
[55:58] everything was in his thinking at the
[56:00] beginning and he said the only thing you
[56:01] are you are an expression you are a
[56:05] word after he thought it he said he
[56:08] spoke it and here you
[56:11] are and here you are oh my after he
[56:15] thought it can you imagine God before
[56:17] the foundation of the world describing
[56:18] to the angels what you would look like
[56:21] oh and what you would do and the church
[56:22] that you would go to and the situations
[56:24] in your life and the things that you
[56:25] would overcome and telling them all the
[56:27] story and just going down chapter after
[56:29] chapter of your life saying Gabriel he's
[56:31] going to go through you know there's
[56:32] going to be a time he's going to go
[56:34] through a hardship he's going to hit a
[56:35] real struggle and and the road's going
[56:38] to get bumpy he's going to wonder he's
[56:39] going to wonder a little bit whether I
[56:41] whether whether I've forsaken him but
[56:43] I'll never forsake Him Gabriel because
[56:45] he somewhere I'm trying to there's
[56:46] something I'm trying to mold into him to
[56:48] bring him to a certain place to do
[56:50] something nobody else can do I want to
[56:52] put him in the right time in the right
[56:54] place to play my part and Gabriel says
[56:56] oh my what a wonderful thought Lord amen
[56:59] that you'd have somebody at the right
[57:00] time at the right place to say the right
[57:02] word and be there when it's really
[57:04] needed you'd have brother Dale there
[57:06] when somebody really needed him amen he
[57:08] might have laid oh my just going with
[57:11] inspiration now he might have laid
[57:12] dormant for many years amen just just
[57:15] just belonging to a church and living a
[57:17] good Christian life but there was a time
[57:19] appointed amen when he would be at the
[57:22] right time at the right place to take
[57:24] the pulpit amen and be a light Amen in
[57:26] the in the in a little town called
[57:28] Wyoming see God's thinking is perfect
[57:30] and I can see him describing it to the
[57:32] angels and all the angels will say oh my
[57:35] what a thought the brother Dale how
[57:37] beautiful what a wonderful thought he
[57:39] says but you think that's wonderful wait
[57:42] till I speak it just wait till I speak
[57:44] it wait till the year 2023 when that
[57:47] which was a thought has become expressed
[57:50] and it all unfolds just the way I had it
[57:52] in my mind what a beautiful reality
[57:54] brother sister that's where I want to be
[57:57] I just want God's Sovereign will to be
[57:58] done in my life so that my life would
[58:01] have eternal value meaning
[58:07] purpose oh my see brother Bram said God
[58:10] is Sovereign in his choosing God is
[58:12] Sovereign who was back there he said to
[58:15] tell him a better way to run the world
[58:17] who would dare to tell him that he was
[58:19] running his business wrong now some of
[58:22] us would have
[58:23] tried you you know that's true some of
[58:26] us would have tried cuz we do that every
[58:27] day God why' you make me this way God
[58:30] why do I have to deal with that God why
[58:32] am I create why why do I look like this
[58:34] why do I sound like that why don't why
[58:36] am I not more like this one my why am I
[58:38] not more like that one God why' you make
[58:40] me like this oh my see we're arguing
[58:44] with the sovereignty of God Amen why is
[58:47] it that we put what we think over what
[58:49] God thought if God in his eternal mind
[58:53] thought of you and I before the
[58:54] foundation of the world shouldn't that
[58:56] mean something to us shouldn't it have a
[58:59] value if you're is thought brother
[59:01] sister you are Eternal you are special
[59:04] and you are powerful brother Bram now we
[59:07] come to it brother Braham said the power
[59:09] that's in you now what power is that
[59:11] it's the spoken word the voice that said
[59:14] let there be light is the voice speaking
[59:15] in your life amen by the manifestation
[59:18] of the spirit that's in you the power in
[59:21] you and that power in you brother Bram
[59:22] said could make a new world could make a
[59:25] new world you say well brother Nathan
[59:26] how come it don't happen because we
[59:27] don't need a new world Amen but he
[59:30] thought us and spoke us to live in this
[59:32] one Amen to be part of the economy of
[59:34] the mystery but see it's enough power
[59:37] could make even a new world if it was
[59:39] needed see God doesn't have little weak
[59:42] spots now here we have to retrain our
[59:44] thinking God doesn't have little weak
[59:46] spots and big heavy spots that's
[59:48] powerful now of course brother brandom
[59:49] that's a big heavy spot right that's a
[59:52] big heavy powerful spot in the mind of
[59:53] God and Me me and you we're just little
[59:55] weak spots uh-huh well you know the
[59:59] pastor or the Deacon or this one or that
[1:00:02] one they're the big heavy they they
[1:00:04] they're the powerful one I'm just a
[1:00:06] little weak spot brother BR said God
[1:00:08] doesn't have a little weak spots he said
[1:00:10] the least little touch of God you know
[1:00:13] the quote is
[1:00:15] omnipotent is omnipotent that means all
[1:00:20] powerful that means all powerful all the
[1:00:23] way powerful you say well brother Nathan
[1:00:25] if I'm part of that light if I'm part of
[1:00:27] that word if I'm part of that Eternal
[1:00:29] logos in the beginning then I'm the
[1:00:30] littlest bitti little spark that spun
[1:00:32] off of the logos I'm the littlest if I'm
[1:00:35] in the body of Christ I'm the I'm just
[1:00:37] the skin on the bottom of the little toe
[1:00:40] I mean I'm the most insignificant one in
[1:00:41] the body well that just puts you right
[1:00:43] down where the action is you're the
[1:00:45] closest one to the neck of the enemy
[1:00:46] brother and sister if you're the little
[1:00:48] toe in the body of Christ every devil of
[1:00:50] hell is under your feet every Power of
[1:00:52] the enemy is Beneath You amen if just
[1:00:55] just be in him amen doesn't matter if
[1:00:57] you think it's an important spot or not
[1:01:00] amen it's part of the body of Christ and
[1:01:03] so it amounts to
[1:01:05] Perfection it amounts to completion it
[1:01:08] adds up to Value brother sister no
[1:01:10] matter how you think about it oh my the
[1:01:12] least little touch of God is omnipotent
[1:01:14] brother Bram said he's seen something in
[1:01:16] me and he's seen something in you he
[1:01:18] said he had a reason to save you he said
[1:01:21] look at the people that's unsaved today
[1:01:24] look at the Millions he could have took
[1:01:26] beside
[1:01:27] you I read a quote like that this
[1:01:29] morning and it just stopped me in my
[1:01:32] tracks brother BR said when he saved me
[1:01:34] a million were lost but he saved me oh
[1:01:37] my look at the millions he said he could
[1:01:39] have took beside you but he took you no
[1:01:43] one can take your place you're in God's
[1:01:46] economy no one else can do it that's his
[1:01:48] love to
[1:01:50] you see we got to learn to think in
[1:01:54] terms of of God's economy I might slow
[1:01:56] down for a minute and just teach on this
[1:01:58] a little bit and just these are just
[1:02:00] some of some of my thoughts you just
[1:02:01] take it for what it's worth but I
[1:02:03] studied just a little bit of Economics
[1:02:04] you know in school and things and uh and
[1:02:07] and and and and the thing about our
[1:02:10] economy our society this world that we
[1:02:12] live in the way that it's built the way
[1:02:15] that it's all arranged it it's all built
[1:02:18] on the idea of relative value that one
[1:02:21] object is more valuable than another and
[1:02:24] maybe one person is more valuable than
[1:02:26] another and one gift is more valuable
[1:02:28] than another and one position is more
[1:02:30] valuable than another and everything is
[1:02:32] relative and everything has a value and
[1:02:34] it's all compared and it's all traded
[1:02:36] you see and it you know it all has to do
[1:02:38] with money and all those things I was I
[1:02:40] was reading one time I thought it was
[1:02:41] quite amazing you know if you go to
[1:02:43] school and you take an economics class
[1:02:45] the first thing that they teach you they
[1:02:47] teach you about barter is that right and
[1:02:49] they talk about barter about well you
[1:02:50] know now we have money and money
[1:02:52] represents value but there was a time
[1:02:54] they say when they didn't have any money
[1:02:56] and they didn't have the idea of money
[1:02:58] and so they just had a barter economy
[1:03:00] and that meant well you know uh I I
[1:03:02] really need some milk so I'll trade my
[1:03:04] 10 chickens for your cow and then you
[1:03:06] know we'll work something out we'll just
[1:03:08] barter and we'll trade kind for kind and
[1:03:10] like that and then and then they say
[1:03:11] that went on and eventually somebody
[1:03:13] came up with the idea of money and money
[1:03:15] replaced all that and gave everything a
[1:03:18] value well you know it's quite
[1:03:20] interesting and like I say you could
[1:03:21] take this for what it's worth but in all
[1:03:23] of history and all of anthropology and
[1:03:25] AR and archaeology and all the studies
[1:03:27] of men they don't know of a single
[1:03:30] society that ever existed as far back as
[1:03:34] they can go without
[1:03:35] money there's no Society or civilization
[1:03:38] that they know of that didn't have the
[1:03:41] concept of value and relative value and
[1:03:44] one thing being measured against another
[1:03:46] you know what that tells me brother
[1:03:48] sister is just that is just this that
[1:03:51] the idea of value is something that's so
[1:03:54] so deep in the human heart it's B it's
[1:03:57] it's it's it's buried it's it's formed
[1:04:00] so deep in a human being it goes all the
[1:04:03] way back to the beginning goes all the
[1:04:05] way back to the Garden of Eden when man
[1:04:07] had value and it was value was lost and
[1:04:10] man had something of great worth but it
[1:04:12] was lost friends and there's something
[1:04:13] whether he's religious or not there's
[1:04:15] something in the heart of every human
[1:04:17] being amen way down deep they know that
[1:04:20] they are need to be redeemed they know
[1:04:23] that they are lacking in value amen they
[1:04:25] know that they're lacking in worth and
[1:04:27] brother sister from the time that we're
[1:04:28] born we're aware of this and we're
[1:04:31] taught this and the world teaches it to
[1:04:34] us from the beginning you know how it is
[1:04:37] every day of your life you will be
[1:04:39] compared to somebody when our children
[1:04:41] in in school you know they they might be
[1:04:44] a good student they might have friends
[1:04:47] but somebody's going to be more popular
[1:04:48] somebody's going to be more talented
[1:04:50] somebody's going to be more this or more
[1:04:52] that or or or smarter or whatever you
[1:04:55] know wherever you get into your life
[1:04:57] you're going to be compared quite it's
[1:04:59] quite it's quite harsh you know it's
[1:05:01] quite a hard thing to think that you and
[1:05:03] I could never be enough in our own
[1:05:05] Humanity to be something that's valuable
[1:05:08] when we're always compared to somebody
[1:05:09] else you know how it is you might decide
[1:05:12] I'm going to learn to be a great piano
[1:05:13] player and I'm going to practice the
[1:05:15] piano every day for the next 30 years
[1:05:17] and I'm going to I'm going to reach my
[1:05:19] full potential to be the greatest piano
[1:05:21] player I could be and some six-year-old
[1:05:23] kid from CH on YouTube is going to blow
[1:05:25] you out of the
[1:05:27] water cuz that's the world that we live
[1:05:29] in somebody's always going to be smarter
[1:05:31] somebody's always going to be better
[1:05:32] looking somebody's always going to be
[1:05:34] richer somebody's going to have a nicer
[1:05:36] house somebody's going to be more famous
[1:05:38] somebody's going to be
[1:05:40] more amen and so in the economy of this
[1:05:42] world you're always compared and you
[1:05:44] always come up lacking but God's economy
[1:05:48] does not look at relative value God's
[1:05:52] economy only looks at Eternal
[1:05:56] value and brother and sister we got to
[1:05:58] Humble ourselves to that we have to
[1:06:00] throw away our way of thinking cuz this
[1:06:02] human mind can only think in terms of
[1:06:03] the worldly economy amen but in God's
[1:06:06] economy oh Hallelujah you're not
[1:06:09] measured by what people think of you but
[1:06:11] you're only measured by your connection
[1:06:13] to eternal life and so your value is
[1:06:17] eternal value it's deity value it's God
[1:06:21] value because you're a part of him and a
[1:06:23] part of his word you know that today we
[1:06:26] have
[1:06:26] inflation we have all kinds of quirks
[1:06:29] and things in our economy we have
[1:06:30] inflation you know when uh uh sometimes
[1:06:33] the market just goes haywire and you got
[1:06:35] to go down to go down to the store and
[1:06:36] you got to pay you know $12 for a dozen
[1:06:39] eggs well the eggs aren't worth
[1:06:42] $12 but because of inflation because of
[1:06:45] relative value because of this worldly
[1:06:47] economy that's what you got to pay the
[1:06:49] price does isn't the value but you got
[1:06:51] to pay the price but in God's economy
[1:06:54] there's no Market
[1:06:56] manipulation there's no inflation in
[1:06:59] God's economy the value is the price if
[1:07:02] a price has been paid then that's the
[1:07:05] value and if God would shed his blood
[1:07:08] amen if God would give his very life
[1:07:10] which is eternal Amen to redeem you and
[1:07:13] to call you out of the Dust of this
[1:07:15] Earth and to fill you with purpose and
[1:07:17] meaning and and and and be the
[1:07:20] expression of his desire amen then that
[1:07:23] is your value
[1:07:24] you that is your worth it's not inflated
[1:07:28] amen God didn't get ripped off amen when
[1:07:31] he when he purchased you but he knew
[1:07:33] what he was getting and he willingly
[1:07:35] shed his blood and paid the price of his
[1:07:37] only begotten son that's what you're
[1:07:40] worth that's what all of us are worth in
[1:07:43] God's
[1:07:44] economy oh if we could just be Washed by
[1:07:47] the Water of the word and have all the
[1:07:49] stinking ideas of this worldly economy
[1:07:51] and our human way of thinking and our
[1:07:53] human evaluation washed from our mind
[1:07:56] that we could see the worth the
[1:08:00] value the value oh oh how dare we speak
[1:08:04] against the blood how dare we devalue
[1:08:07] what God has valued how dare we talk bad
[1:08:10] about one another how dare we talk bad
[1:08:12] about
[1:08:13] ourselves when God has given his
[1:08:16] evaluation you're worth what he said you
[1:08:19] were
[1:08:20] worth you think he shed his blood
[1:08:22] because of obligation to you
[1:08:24] because he had to because he was trapped
[1:08:26] into it God shed his blood for you
[1:08:28] because of
[1:08:30] desire you see you see what I'm talking
[1:08:33] about value now there's churches there's
[1:08:35] preachers all over this world probably
[1:08:37] on this Sunday morning preaching to
[1:08:38] their Church on similar lines of this
[1:08:41] but see this is not some water down uh a
[1:08:44] seminary some kind of a Veggie Tales
[1:08:47] Theology of just you know God made you
[1:08:50] special and he loves you very much you
[1:08:53] see I'm not preaching this to you now
[1:08:55] you're valuable to me as brothers and
[1:08:56] sisters of the Lord but but see it's not
[1:08:59] my evaluation that we're that we're
[1:09:00] dealing with now you're sure you're
[1:09:02] valuable to me but see but but but but
[1:09:05] it's not that I assign you value because
[1:09:08] we're friends and because we both belong
[1:09:11] to message churches and because brother
[1:09:12] Dale invited me to pre and just because
[1:09:15] because in some human way of thinking I
[1:09:17] assign you value and I treat you like
[1:09:20] you're valuable whether you are or not
[1:09:23] that's not it in God's economy you are
[1:09:28] value you are value can you see the
[1:09:32] difference can you see the difference
[1:09:34] amen you are value you are worthy you
[1:09:38] are righteous you are redeemed you are
[1:09:42] bride you are royal you are seed you are
[1:09:45] genan you are him bone of his bone and
[1:09:50] flesh of his
[1:09:51] flesh that's what you are
[1:09:54] are Hallelujah you are value I might
[1:09:58] assign you all the value that I can and
[1:09:59] I certainly do but it's not my
[1:10:01] evaluation that will matter but what
[1:10:03] matters is his
[1:10:05] evaluation of you and
[1:10:07] I Hallelujah we've got to be retrained
[1:10:11] in our way of thinking brother Bram said
[1:10:13] sometimes great guys get together oh and
[1:10:15] you hear them say oh great so and so and
[1:10:17] great so and so you know this great
[1:10:19] brother and that great one he said don't
[1:10:21] ever do that there's no great ones Among
[1:10:25] Us there's only one great one and that's
[1:10:28] God yes sir that's right he said we are
[1:10:30] brothers sisters he said I don't care if
[1:10:32] you're pastoring a church it's got five
[1:10:34] people in it that don't make you little
[1:10:36] it makes you a brother see God's
[1:10:38] evaluation what God is looking at God
[1:10:40] doesn't have little children and big
[1:10:42] children he just has children he said
[1:10:46] they're all the same and God himself
[1:10:48] came down from the ivory palaces of
[1:10:50] Glory to become one of us now who's the
[1:10:53] big one
[1:10:54] he didn't come down here to take the
[1:10:56] form of a priest he took the form of a
[1:10:58] servant amen being found in the fashion
[1:11:01] of a man he humbled himself he washed
[1:11:03] the very clay that he created the feet
[1:11:05] of his Apostles and others now who's
[1:11:07] great brother sister forget what you
[1:11:10] think and I think of who's important and
[1:11:13] who's a big great big so and so and and
[1:11:16] and and and and what matters in our
[1:11:18] human way of thinking there's only one
[1:11:20] rank in the economy of God that's
[1:11:22] footwash flun
[1:11:25] footwash flunky if you're a bishop if
[1:11:26] you're a pope if you're a whatever you
[1:11:28] are if you're the if you're the foremost
[1:11:31] evangelist on the field or whatever you
[1:11:32] are whatever you're doing for the
[1:11:34] kingdom of God do what you're supposed
[1:11:36] to do amen and it's just and it's the
[1:11:39] same he just has children now of course
[1:11:43] it doesn't mean we're all going to look
[1:11:44] the same it doesn't mean we're all going
[1:11:46] to have the same Min Ministry like
[1:11:48] brother jar and I were fellowshipping
[1:11:49] somebody's you know there somebody's
[1:11:50] going to be out preaching around the
[1:11:52] world and then somebody's going to be
[1:11:54] somebody's going to keep it stable at
[1:11:56] home and and somebody's not going to
[1:11:58] preach at all but they're just going to
[1:11:59] send a friendly text or check in on
[1:12:01] somebody or bring somebody a hot meal or
[1:12:03] whatever you're doing in your ministry
[1:12:05] brother sister amen it's not all going
[1:12:07] to look the same and some are going to
[1:12:09] look important and some are not amen
[1:12:12] even brother Brandon would use words
[1:12:14] like our great brother so and so and
[1:12:15] things like that amen see don't expect
[1:12:18] it to all look the same it's not that
[1:12:20] they're the same but they're value the
[1:12:22] same and anyone with the Holy Ghost and
[1:12:25] a genuine revelation will value you the
[1:12:27] same if you're in God's economy right if
[1:12:31] you're in God's economy
[1:12:34] Hallelujah
[1:12:36] my in God's economy we're all different
[1:12:39] but we're all valued the same now that's
[1:12:42] of course adoption that's the revelation
[1:12:45] of adoption brother Bram said your
[1:12:47] adoption would it be your maturity it'd
[1:12:49] be Reaching Your Potential it'd be
[1:12:51] fulfilling your calling your ministry
[1:12:53] your adoption is a positional
[1:12:56] placing so when you come in your
[1:12:58] position it doesn't really you know it'd
[1:13:00] be like if we're trying to build a
[1:13:02] church a big great big Stone
[1:13:04] Cathedral and then you just you you get
[1:13:07] your stone and that represents your life
[1:13:09] and you just shape that up just perfect
[1:13:11] you got it all every every corner is
[1:13:13] perfectly square and all the geometry is
[1:13:16] just right and your life is so perfect
[1:13:18] then throw that out in the field and say
[1:13:19] look at that church well it doesn't mean
[1:13:22] anything till you put your stone against
[1:13:24] my stone put another Stone on top of
[1:13:27] that then put the pasture up here and
[1:13:28] build it up until we all come together
[1:13:31] you can't all you can't all stack it up
[1:13:33] in the same position everybody's got a
[1:13:34] different place but when you put it
[1:13:36] together it's a great house of worship
[1:13:38] and the presence of the Lord can fill
[1:13:40] that vessel Hallelujah that's that's
[1:13:44] what our adoption means it doesn't mean
[1:13:46] and that's why nobody could preach
[1:13:47] adoption like brother brandom I'm
[1:13:49] telling you let if God had come down in
[1:13:51] the 1960s to any other charismatic
[1:13:54] leader to any of the great Oneness
[1:13:55] Pentecostals or any of those men and and
[1:13:58] and and those great generals and great
[1:14:00] men as we would call them imagine if God
[1:14:02] had come down to one of them and he said
[1:14:04] now I've chosen you brother so and so I
[1:14:07] I've chosen you great leader and you're
[1:14:09] going to be the one that's going to
[1:14:10] preach the message of adoption in this
[1:14:12] day and bring the bride to her maturity
[1:14:14] you're going to loose the Revelation you
[1:14:16] know what adoption would have been the
[1:14:18] manifestation of sons Power Authority
[1:14:20] your her name on the check being as good
[1:14:22] as his you know what they would have
[1:14:23] made it they would have turned it in it
[1:14:25] would have been a worldwide Ministry
[1:14:26] they'd have been on television
[1:14:27] everywhere they'd be emptying out
[1:14:29] hospitals and walking on the water and
[1:14:30] there'd be no place for you and I we
[1:14:33] wouldn't even be in the picture it'd be
[1:14:35] some great leader it'd be something but
[1:14:37] brother brandom a god-called prophet a
[1:14:39] man with a true Revelation preaches the
[1:14:41] message of adoption he said if you're a
[1:14:43] farmer he said if you're a factory
[1:14:45] worker he said if you're a housewife and
[1:14:48] at whatever you are you get in your
[1:14:51] position and that's your adoption oh my
[1:14:54] Hallelujah a prophet a man with a man
[1:14:57] who made an altar call amen and 30,000
[1:14:59] people came to the Lord in one night but
[1:15:01] there was enough room in adoption for me
[1:15:03] there was enough room in adoption for
[1:15:05] you there is enough room in God's
[1:15:07] economy for all of us hallelujah
[1:15:11] hallelujah oh brother brandom talked
[1:15:14] about talked about David and how you
[1:15:16] wouldn't have you wouldn't have picked
[1:15:18] him out of the bunch he didn't look like
[1:15:19] the strong one or the great one he was a
[1:15:21] stripping boy he was the run to the
[1:15:23] litter well he said now you could say
[1:15:26] well brother brandom I wasn't called to
[1:15:27] be a preacher he said you might be
[1:15:29] called to be a housewife he said but you
[1:15:31] got your position in Christ Jesus by the
[1:15:34] Holy Ghost you're just as much David as
[1:15:36] the rest of them brother sister don't
[1:15:40] devalue what God has valued he said
[1:15:42] you're just as much David as the
[1:15:44] preacher as the prophet amen if you're a
[1:15:46] housewife and you're raising those
[1:15:48] children in the fear and admonition of
[1:15:50] the Lord and you're that Fifth Gospel I
[1:15:53] know people will make you feel unvalued
[1:15:56] but in God's economy Hallelujah you're
[1:15:58] dripping with the oil of anointing
[1:16:01] you're a ro as Royal as David was Royal
[1:16:04] you have your place in the adoption of
[1:16:06] the body in the manifestation of sons
[1:16:09] see every joint
[1:16:11] supplies nobody in this body is without
[1:16:14] P purpose like we said participation is
[1:16:17] not an
[1:16:18] option so if every joint is supposed to
[1:16:21] be a supplier then you can't just sit
[1:16:24] around and be a
[1:16:26] consumer come on somebody because that's
[1:16:29] the way a lot of us we you know we'll go
[1:16:31] to church on Sunday we'll sing a few
[1:16:33] songs and say amen and all those kind of
[1:16:35] things but see there's a difference in
[1:16:37] being a church member amen and being the
[1:16:40] church amen the called out the elect
[1:16:43] amen the the the to being a part of the
[1:16:45] body where you show up and you're not
[1:16:47] you don't show up saying boy I hope we
[1:16:49] got a good preacher today and man I hope
[1:16:51] the singing is in tune and man I hope
[1:16:54] they sing my favorite song and oh you
[1:16:56] know I Hope Church doesn't go too long
[1:16:58] and I I I I hope uh I hope that that the
[1:17:01] the sister brought the right thing in
[1:17:02] the crock pot you know that my favorite
[1:17:05] dish no and just consume and consume and
[1:17:08] consume who wants that kind of Life
[1:17:10] brother sister but I want to supply
[1:17:13] something I want to have a purpose I
[1:17:16] want to be a part of this thing now
[1:17:18] whether I'm going to stand in the Pulpit
[1:17:19] or whether I'm going to sweep the floor
[1:17:21] or whether I'm going to greet somebody
[1:17:22] at the door or whatever my place is
[1:17:24] brother sister I'm happy to do it amen
[1:17:27] just give me a part just let me be a
[1:17:30] part
[1:17:32] Hallelujah my this is going off but
[1:17:35] something I've shared before and maybe
[1:17:37] you didn't maybe just enjoy it but in my
[1:17:40] heart you know in my
[1:17:42] heart there we know that there's Great
[1:17:44] Men great Min we would call them great
[1:17:46] men and great Ministries around the
[1:17:48] message people that we look up to people
[1:17:50] that we enjoy you know we look at we
[1:17:53] look at the five-fold ministry we look
[1:17:54] at pastors we look at those things oh my
[1:17:57] it looks great to us and we appreciate
[1:17:59] that now some people get jealous you
[1:18:01] know and Petty about those things I
[1:18:02] don't I appreciate what God has given
[1:18:05] because because of this revelation of
[1:18:07] God's economy amen because of realizing
[1:18:10] I have a part in this thing nobody can
[1:18:12] take away from me and it's of no less
[1:18:14] value then that what that means to me if
[1:18:16] you say brother Nathan well you're not
[1:18:18] much of a Preacher that's all right or
[1:18:20] you know maybe your ministry is not
[1:18:21] going to go far that would be all right
[1:18:23] as long as it would go where God wanted
[1:18:25] it to go because see be this what I'm
[1:18:28] preaching you means so much to me that
[1:18:31] if you took away my Ministry and you
[1:18:33] said and and the Lord came and he said
[1:18:36] Nathan you can't preach anymore you
[1:18:38] can't you you can't have a position in
[1:18:40] the church anymore you can't work with
[1:18:42] young people anymore you can't be
[1:18:43] anything in the church you can't hold a
[1:18:45] mop you can't you can't answer the door
[1:18:47] you you you just I'm taking you down
[1:18:49] until you're just whatever this means a
[1:18:51] regular member of the bride just a
[1:18:54] regular just a plain basic entrylevel
[1:18:56] bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:58] member oh my and you say and you're
[1:19:01] never going to be like that great
[1:19:02] brother and that great ministry and that
[1:19:05] man with that big church and his and and
[1:19:07] that one that's well known and you'll
[1:19:08] never be that oh my you know what that
[1:19:11] would mean to me that God thought so
[1:19:14] much of me that he would raise up that
[1:19:16] man he would raise up that Ministry he
[1:19:18] raised up Ray Ericson he raised up Wayne
[1:19:21] Lawson he raised up brother d he raised
[1:19:23] up men of God Amen for my benefit cuz he
[1:19:27] was thinking about me you see we got to
[1:19:30] turn it around and see the way God
[1:19:31] thinks about it he said I send you
[1:19:33] Elijah the prophet I'm the reason God
[1:19:36] sent a prophet You're the Reason God
[1:19:38] sent a prophet if he was great it's cuz
[1:19:40] you were great in the mind of God you
[1:19:43] were valued you were important you were
[1:19:45] worthy of receiving this ministry you
[1:19:48] don't think that's true brother Bram
[1:19:50] said that widow woman that Elijah went
[1:19:52] to he he said God would have never sent
[1:19:54] his Prophet to a house that was unworthy
[1:19:56] he said so she must have been of the
[1:19:58] same caliber as Elijah brother sister if
[1:20:01] you're in the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:20:02] you're not undervalue you're the same
[1:20:05] caliber amen as this Kentucky hillbilly
[1:20:08] amen who died out to all his flesh and
[1:20:10] ran this message around the world to
[1:20:12] gather up the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:20:14] You're the Reason God sent a prophet you
[1:20:16] say but he's the best man yes but you're
[1:20:18] the
[1:20:19] bride
[1:20:21] Hallelujah
[1:20:23] Hallelujah
[1:20:25] see the mystery is an
[1:20:28] economy the mystery is an
[1:20:32] economy oh what is this great mystery to
[1:20:34] the Gentiles it's
[1:20:37] Christ and
[1:20:39] you it's a hope of
[1:20:41] glory you and I could live a life of
[1:20:44] glory amen it won't be according to this
[1:20:47] thinking it'll be according to his
[1:20:48] thinking yes sir a hope of glory Christ
[1:20:52] and you that's the
[1:20:55] mystery so the mystery of the message is
[1:20:58] not what's being revealed just to your
[1:21:01] life not God sent you a prophet and he
[1:21:03] taught you how to baptize and he taught
[1:21:05] you that God was one and he taught you
[1:21:07] about serpent seed and he preached the
[1:21:09] seventh seal and the third pole and all
[1:21:11] those kind of things it's deeper than
[1:21:12] that brother
[1:21:14] sister not just what's revealed to you
[1:21:17] but what is being revealed through
[1:21:20] you God didn't fill you with his spirit
[1:21:24] you know to turn you into a pastor
[1:21:26] overnight or turn you into if you're a
[1:21:28] young man or young woman these little
[1:21:29] boys and girls God wants to fill them
[1:21:31] with the Holy Ghost not so that they'll
[1:21:32] immediately become a
[1:21:34] 30-year-old God wants to show the world
[1:21:37] what the Holy Ghost looks like what God
[1:21:39] looks like what deity looks like in a
[1:21:41] 13year old in a 14y old in a farmer in a
[1:21:45] factory worker in an engineer in a
[1:21:48] preacher in a singer in a in an Amen
[1:21:51] Corner in a prayer Warrior
[1:21:54] Hallelujah that's the mystery but it's
[1:21:57] an economy brother sister amen how many
[1:22:02] how
[1:22:03] many as I just feel to bring it down
[1:22:05] now maybe we'll just
[1:22:15] stand amen you love him
[1:22:18] today amen has this meant something to
[1:22:21] youj brother sister if we would bow our
[1:22:24] heads
[1:22:26] now and begin to just Ponder on the
[1:22:30] things that we've
[1:22:33] heard now I'm
[1:22:35] guilty many times in my
[1:22:38] life of being a
[1:22:41] consumer I'm guilty and maybe because I
[1:22:45] didn't
[1:22:46] value myself what I could
[1:22:49] bring maybe many times because I didn't
[1:22:51] value my own gift or I didn't value my
[1:22:53] own position in the body or whatever it
[1:22:56] would be somewhere this human thinking
[1:22:59] got in the
[1:23:01] way and when I could have
[1:23:05] supplied I sat by and consumed oh
[1:23:08] brother sister is there somebody here
[1:23:10] today would lift a hand to him and say
[1:23:12] Lord forgive me for being a consumer let
[1:23:15] me
[1:23:16] Supply Lord let me throw my all to the
[1:23:19] cause Lord let me fill my place in God's
[1:23:23] economy I see that participation is not
[1:23:25] an option Lord I want you to have my
[1:23:27] whole life whether I would value it
[1:23:31] whether somebody else would value what I
[1:23:33] bring Lord as long as you're pleased as
[1:23:36] long as I'm revealing the mystery of
[1:23:39] what was in your mind for me pertaining
[1:23:41] to my life Lord I'll be
[1:23:45] content but father I just want to serve
[1:23:47] you live a life that's worthy of this
[1:23:50] great message Lord you thought I was so
[1:23:53] valuable that you pay the ultimate price
[1:23:57] and that's where you set my worth Lord
[1:23:59] then I I Surrender my doubts I Surrender
[1:24:03] my complexes I Surrender my misgivings
[1:24:06] Lord and I accept your evaluation Lord
[1:24:10] by Faith Lord I I want to take hold of
[1:24:12] it Lord and I I I want to truly believe
[1:24:16] by your spirit Lord revealing it to me
[1:24:18] that I'm your bride and that I'm of
[1:24:21] value to you and I'm living a life of
[1:24:23] Eternal purpose Lord something that will
[1:24:25] matter on the other side Lord if we if
[1:24:28] we were rich on this side if we were
[1:24:30] great if we were famous if we were
[1:24:32] important and we were Mighty Lord we
[1:24:34] might achieve great things through human
[1:24:36] efforts father but then on the other
[1:24:38] side Lord Lord when this Mortal goes to
[1:24:42] the Earth father back to the dust and it
[1:24:44] all fades away into the void Lord then
[1:24:47] let there be something that lasts Let
[1:24:49] There be something that's Eternal Father
[1:24:51] only what's done for you will matter
[1:24:54] over there Lord I Thank you for Lord
[1:24:57] these honest hearts that have responded
[1:24:59] to your word Lord let them see father
[1:25:02] how important they are to you Lord speak
