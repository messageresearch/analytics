[23:24] Lord Jesus, we we make these chorus of
[23:28] this song our prayer this morning
[23:31] &gt;&gt; and we know your word says you won't
[23:33] pass us by
[23:34] &gt;&gt; and you'll never leave us nor forsake
[23:36] us. But our prayer is that you wouldn't.
[23:38] And Lord God, we pray that you'd be here
[23:42] this morning
[23:44] &gt;&gt; in our gathering, Lord God, that's
[23:46] dedicated to serve and worship you, Lord
[23:48] God. And Lord, we know the weather is
[23:51] many are unable to be here and be with
[23:54] them and keep them safe. Lord God,
[23:56] that's most important. And Lord, just be
[23:59] with the ones that were able to come.
[24:00] And Lord, may everything that's done and
[24:03] said
[24:04] &gt;&gt; be pleasing to you, Lord Jesus. We pray.
[24:08] Amen. Amen. You may have your seats this
[24:11] morning. God bless you. Just going to
[24:15] It's good to be here. We know that. We
[24:17] know that different ones cannot be here
[24:19] because of the weather. The weather's
[24:21] been We me and Lynn went and got some
[24:24] chairs and where Matt and Abigail are,
[24:27] the weather's much much worse than here
[24:30] and and different ones and but uh
[24:35] we uh
[24:37] we uh
[24:40] want to show you some pictures. We kind
[24:41] of had a a full week this week.
[24:46] And uh
[24:48] God is very good. Amen. I wasn't sure
[24:50] what I was going to do. I actually had a
[24:52] brother offer to come and minister, but
[24:55] um
[24:58] I uh I chose not to. But Vicki, you can
[25:02] show the pictures. This is what happened
[25:04] last Sunday and Sunday evening or
[25:08] Monday.
[25:10] I didn't realize that this was happening
[25:12] when Vicki was showing our quotes last
[25:15] Sunday, but she wasn't feeling well.
[25:18] So, we lost our little grandson.
[25:23] God decided that
[25:58] God is God and he's sovereign. Amen. And
[26:02] we are his bride and
[26:05] his wife.
[26:13] I would have chose to
[26:15] been me a thousand times. I'm an old man
[26:18] and
[26:20] let my family live and enjoy life. But
[26:24] but God is God. Amen.
[26:30] I really believe that when the church
[26:33] comes into perfection
[26:36] and perfect love,
[26:39] we'll feel each other's pain. Amen.
[26:43] And you have to
[26:51] picture if you've been waiting 15 years
[26:54] for your first baby.
[27:00] Amen.
[27:03] Amen.
[27:05] It's his little feet that are walking in
[27:07] heaven now, waiting for his old grandpa
[27:10] to hurry up and get there.
[27:13] Amen.
[27:17] Amen. So, we kind of went from funerals
[27:19] to birthdays this week and it was kind
[27:21] of
[27:23] kind of all over the charts. Amen.
[27:29] We we feel Tim and Vickiy's pain
[27:33] tremendously.
[27:35] And you know, the Bible says we rejoice
[27:37] with them that rejoice and we weep with
[27:39] them that weep. And that's just because
[27:41] we are
[27:43] we are one and we feel if there's
[27:46] somebody homeless in our midst, we're
[27:48] concerned about that person. If there's
[27:50] somebody not eating in our midst, we're
[27:52] concerned. If we're one, we are. If
[27:55] there's somebody that can't pay their
[27:56] hydro bill, we're concerned about that.
[27:59] Amen. We have to be, or we want to.
[28:02] Maybe Vicki, if some are just coming in,
[28:04] so maybe if you don't mind just going
[28:05] through them. Amen. Because that makes
[28:07] us one in Christ. And you know, God is,
[28:10] he's an amazing God because
[28:14] we've been preaching on the feminine
[28:20] side of God. Amen. Which that's what we
[28:22] are.
[28:24] And the feminine side will never have an
[28:26] arrogant spirit.
[28:28] It was never ever the will of God. Amen.
[28:33] Never ever the will of God. So
[28:36] someday I'll meet him.
[28:38] I pray it's sooner than later.
[28:41] Little
[28:43] EMTT James
[28:46] Recman.
[28:48] Amen. Is waiting for Grandpa.
[28:51] But uh he's doing the farming up there
[28:54] till I get there. Amen. Ain't Lent's got
[28:57] a song for us to sing.
[29:51] He giveth more grace
[29:56] when the burdens grow.
[30:02] He sendeth
[30:03] more strength.
[30:06] When the laborers
[30:09] increase
[30:11] to added
[30:14] action
[30:16] he addeth
[30:18] his mercy
[30:22] to multiply
[30:25] trials
[30:27] is multiplying
[30:30] peace
[30:33] is
[30:36] Love has no limit.
[30:40] His grace has no measure.
[30:45] His power
[30:47] has no boundary
[30:50] known unto
[30:52] men.
[30:54] pour out of his infinite
[31:00] riches
[31:02] in Jesus.
[31:05] He giveth
[31:08] and giveth
[31:11] and
[31:13] give
[31:15] giveth
[31:17] again.
[31:20] When we have exhausted
[31:25] our store of endurance.
[31:31] When our strength has filled
[31:36] and the day is half done.
[31:41] When we
[31:43] reach the end of our hoarded
[31:48] resourcees,
[31:52] our father's
[31:54] forgiving
[31:56] is only
[31:59] beun.
[32:02] His love has no limit.
[32:08] His grace has no measure.
[32:13] His power has no boundaries
[32:18] known unto men.
[32:23] pour out of his infinite
[32:29] riches
[32:30] in Jesus.
[32:33] He giveth
[32:36] and giveth
[32:39] and giveth
[32:42] again.
[32:49] Thank you. And we definitely Amen.
[32:54] We definitely want to thank all the ones
[32:56] that had uh sent wonderful kind comments
[33:00] and called and and u
[33:05] just very very very special.
[33:09] Um, some had wanted to come by, but most
[33:12] of the family were just kind of uh
[33:17] spending
[33:19] their self time. Amen.
[33:23] Amen. I'm going to read a scripture.
[33:25] Romans, you're you're welcome. You're
[33:27] you're okay to be seated this time.
[33:30] Romans uh 12:16.
[33:34] I'm just I'm going to see what
[33:37] what God uh lets us do. I'm not
[33:39] necessarily going to preach a long
[33:41] message. I'm not sure I I'm uh going to
[33:45] be able to.
[33:52] I really believe what God was
[33:54] ministering was God's will. And I
[33:57] believe he really
[33:59] truly laid it on my heart to minister.
[34:02] And uh I got a taste of that
[34:06] this past week.
[34:10] Be of the same mind one to another.
[34:15] Mind not the high things, but be consc
[34:19] condescend to men of low estate, and be
[34:23] not wise in your own conceit.
[34:27] Be ye of the same mind towards one
[34:29] another.
[34:31] Mind not the high things, but condescend
[34:33] to men of low estate.
[34:36] And be
[34:38] not wise
[34:40] in your own conceit. Lord God, we pray
[34:42] that your will will be completely done
[34:45] &gt;&gt; and this place totally. Lord God, we
[34:48] surrender our vessel to you. We only
[34:51] desire to serve you and please you Lord
[34:54] Jesus this morning. In your name we
[34:56] pray. Amen.
[34:58] Amen. You may have your seats. God bless
[35:00] you and we desperately love you in
[35:04] Christ Jesus. And thank you for your
[35:06] kindness to us. Amen. And Tim and Vicki,
[35:10] this this word condescend. You know, we
[35:12] we were preaching on the seed of God
[35:16] will always bring the nature of God. And
[35:18] we're going to look into some things
[35:20] that Brother Brandham mentioned about
[35:22] who we are, the feminine side of God.
[35:25] and and uh and you know we've been on
[35:28] this for I it's very unusual for me to
[35:31] to preach multiple messages and I was
[35:34] actually doing my devotions this week in
[35:36] Corinthians and about every chapter of
[35:38] Corinthians Paul was saying something
[35:40] that was what we were preaching on but
[35:42] this condescend means to show feelings
[35:45] of support uh superiority
[35:50] and you know I I want to just say this
[35:52] that and and I've said this every
[35:53] service the message of that we believe
[35:55] of the hour that God graciously sent us
[35:58] through brother Brandham is is the
[36:00] revelation
[36:02] of unsealing the mysteries of the Bible
[36:04] is 100% the truth
[36:08] and I know that there's going to be a
[36:10] bride or a wife or whatever you want to
[36:12] call her in heaven and I know there's
[36:14] going to be servants in heaven I know
[36:16] there'll be 144,000 Jews saved
[36:21] and I know there will be people saved
[36:22] that go through the tribulation
[36:25] But you have no right as the bride of
[36:27] Christ or the wife of Christ to show
[36:30] your spir superiority
[36:35] &gt;&gt; in this world. And majority of message
[36:38] people do
[36:41] &gt;&gt; until you get to the millennium
[36:44] &gt;&gt; and when you sit on the throne and you
[36:46] judge the world then that's when you can
[36:48] show your superior superiority.
[36:53] But until now, you're God's wife
[36:57] &gt;&gt; and you got very little to say about it.
[37:02] &gt;&gt; You know, I was
[37:05] fellowshipping with most looking at most
[37:08] of your kind remarks this week and me
[37:10] and Lanne, and I I sent hard questions
[37:13] to Osman Bartley, and I said, "Osman, we
[37:16] prayed
[37:18] and God never heard us."
[37:21] The Bible says if you you have not
[37:24] because you ask not. We definitely ask.
[37:30] And that what that see God God heard us
[37:34] but he answered in a different way
[37:36] because he's an omnipotent God. And we
[37:40] have no right to show our superiority
[37:43] around what we think people are going to
[37:45] rank in the in the rapture and where
[37:47] they're going to be in heaven and that.
[37:49] It's not the mind of Christ. And I'm
[37:51] going to read what the prophet said. He
[37:52] said it's out of the nature of what God
[37:55] placed in you.
[37:57] He said something
[38:00] this this word uh condescend is a hotty
[38:03] spirit
[38:05] and that as though someone is below your
[38:08] dignity
[38:10] or level of importance.
[38:13] Now, if you listen to somebody like, "I
[38:16] know God's going to have a wife and a
[38:17] bride, but we don't have no right to put
[38:19] people out."
[38:21] Brother Bram said it like this. He said,
[38:23] "You're a fisherman, and you throw the
[38:25] net out, and God throws the things out
[38:28] of the net that God chooses, not the
[38:30] minister."
[38:34] You know, some people eat shrimp, but
[38:36] they're not fish. Some people eat
[38:38] starfish, but they're not fish.
[38:42] Amen.
[38:45] And you know it just it we we are to
[38:48] serve God humbly
[38:50] and reverently
[38:53] and in unbelievable gratitude for what
[38:55] God's surrendered onto oursel this the
[38:59] end of this verse and I want to I want
[39:01] to show you some things our prophet said
[39:02] just to back us up. To be wise in our
[39:05] own conceit, it means an extensive pride
[39:09] in oneself,
[39:11] puffed up and vanity.
[39:16] Well, bless God, I'm not them.
[39:22] That's not of God.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; It's not of God.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm going to show you, but
[39:30] let's let's just let's just get into it
[39:32] for a few minutes here. Here our first
[39:35] quote in the brother M Brown preached
[39:37] the humble yourself. He said the reason
[39:39] the Bible has become such a problem
[39:40] today is because people try to interpret
[39:43] it to a higher type of language.
[39:47] Now let's just go to the next paragraph.
[39:48] And so God humbled himself humbles
[39:51] himself and God is humility. And a man
[39:54] can humble himself is is on his road up.
[39:59] And he that exalts himself is on the
[40:01] road down
[40:04] always. And we must remember that
[40:07] Christianity is not pushing ahead but is
[40:09] trying to go ahead of this fellow. It's
[40:12] not trying to get ahead of this fellow.
[40:15] But that's what the message has become.
[40:19] But stepping back and taking a back
[40:22] seat. You see, trying to let the other
[40:25] person go on. That's Christianity.
[40:28] Humbling yourself.
[40:32] Wow.
[40:35] God help us. God help me. Amen.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Let you know in in all situations, God
[40:42] is God. God's omnipotent. He's he he is
[40:45] the one that chooses. Amen. Watch this
[40:48] here. And I read I did read this one in
[40:50] June 22nd. I I keep track. So I don't
[40:53] Nothing here is new material or I mean
[40:55] it's all new material except this quote
[40:58] here. He said you show me a church
[41:00] that's humble. A real humble not
[41:04] arrogant.
[41:07] A church just sweet humble church. And
[41:09] I'll show you a church that's got the
[41:11] favor and power of God in it.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; That's right. The things it takes is
[41:17] humility. Humbling oursel before God.
[41:20] letting God work through us.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, this this next scripture that
[41:27] we want to look at, 1 Corinthians, and
[41:29] oh boy, Paul ever hit on this and and
[41:32] you know, it's we're going to we're
[41:33] going to minister on it if God allows us
[41:35] down the road. My iPad's acting up down
[41:38] the road if God allows us.
[41:42] But 1 Corinthians 8 and2
[41:47] brand new scripture we've never read
[41:48] before in this series. If any man think
[41:52] that he knoweth anything,
[41:57] he knoweth yet as he ought to know.
[42:02] An abandoned man thinkketh he knoweth
[42:04] anything. He knoweth nothing yet as he
[42:08] ought to know.
[42:10] you know, and and I I don't I don't mean
[42:12] this I'm not trying to, but I just think
[42:14] that that when we come into the perfect
[42:17] capstone, we need to get away from being
[42:22] I don't know how to say it without but
[42:24] just just preach on ourselves and and
[42:27] not worry about
[42:32] &gt;&gt; just concentrate on am I right,
[42:36] &gt;&gt; not if the person next door is right.
[42:38] Yeah.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; You know, and I mentioned this last
[42:47] week, you know, Paul had an infirmity in
[42:49] the flesh because God had given him such
[42:51] enormous revelation
[42:54] &gt;&gt; that God said he wouldn't heal him. He
[42:56] said, "My grace is sufficient for you."
[42:59] Now, God has given us enormal
[43:01] revelation.
[43:10] I wonder if we flaunt it.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Not everybody does, of course. It just
[43:20] it's just a spirit that is around the
[43:23] area. I want to I want to show you this
[43:24] is a direct quotes to the prophet on
[43:28] messagehub to this exact verse.
[43:33] You might be surprised what the prophet
[43:35] says. So if you look around today and
[43:37] think how the world is in its condition
[43:40] and that great bunch of confusion, the
[43:42] great bunch of nonsense and the world is
[43:44] and dogging in today, I we wonder where
[43:47] it come from, especially
[43:51] especially
[43:53] in church life.
[43:56] Now remember this directly tied to this
[43:59] verse in the message of being that we
[44:01] are Christians, we deal mostly on that.
[44:05] And how could there be so many people
[44:08] with so many different ideas and so many
[44:10] different thoughts and so many different
[44:12] angles to approach the gospel and
[44:16] everyone is claiming that they're
[44:17] perfectly right and the next fellow's
[44:21] wrong.
[44:22] When you see someone's doing that and
[44:26] you're pretty well
[44:28] when you see someone doing that, then
[44:30] you're pretty well on the line.
[44:34] The Bible says if he thinks he knows
[44:37] something,
[44:39] he knows nothing that he ought to know.
[44:44] So, Brother Bram's saying here, if you
[44:45] see somebody that thinks they got
[44:47] everything right, Brother Bram, a quote
[44:50] that's way down. I will read it
[44:52] tomorrow, but brother Bram said in this
[44:54] in this message late quote after the
[44:57] seals I believe it is um I don't have it
[44:59] in front of me right on my screen but he
[45:01] said how do you know that when you get
[45:02] to heaven that how you believe the
[45:05] interpretation of the message won't be a
[45:07] little different than what God intended.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Now that dare quote will take away your
[45:14] hotty spirit.
[45:20] Now, in this message hub, brother Bram
[45:22] had, I think, five quotes. I put two up
[45:26] here directly connected to our
[45:28] Corinthians verse.
[45:31] Next quote,
[45:34] he said, "Now listen, we're going to say
[45:36] something now that might score you."
[45:41] The prophet's warning the people.
[45:43] He said, "Bless God. I'm the oneness."
[45:48] Hallelujah.
[45:50] And bless God, I'm the assemblies.
[45:53] And glory to God, I'm the church of God
[45:56] and you're this kind and you're that
[45:59] kind.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; You're nothing.
[46:06] As long as you think that, you're
[46:09] nothing.
[46:11] Now, I think if you could put in that
[46:12] quote that you're this kind or you're
[46:15] that kind, maybe you could put in you're
[46:16] this kind of a message believer or
[46:18] you're that kind of a message believer.
[46:21] He he uses all the things. Watch till we
[46:23] finish it. He said, "Then you're
[46:24] nothing."
[46:26] See, your thinking's wrong. As long as
[46:29] you think that, you're nothing. The
[46:31] Bible says that when a man thinks he's
[46:33] some some thinks himself something, he's
[46:36] nothing. Now, this is what Brother Brham
[46:39] says. Listen what brother Dale says.
[46:43] He is nothing that he ought to be.
[46:45] That's exactly right. You think yourself
[46:47] nothing, come down so God can empty
[46:50] yourself out and try to fill yourself
[46:54] up. You're empty. If you try to fill
[46:56] yourself up, you're empty. That's the
[46:58] biggest job for the church and the
[47:01] individual is to empty itself. Well,
[47:05] another word of empty itself would be to
[47:08] be humble.
[47:09] or to not have a hotty spirit.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:17] Only us individually can do that. Amen.
[47:21] I really believe only us individually
[47:24] can choose to let God be God. Amen. Here
[47:36] our prophet is talking about the
[47:39] feminine spirit. That's what we are.
[47:42] Brother Brham typed everything in the
[47:43] natural to the spiritual.
[47:46] We were the feminine side of God. We
[47:48] come out of God like Eve came out of
[47:50] Adam was the feminine side. And here,
[47:52] watch what he says here in questions and
[47:54] answers. And I just to clarify, I I put
[47:57] I put three down here,
[48:01] but there was multiple ones that were 64
[48:04] and 65 after the seals. Same message.
[48:09] And when you see a woman act now, this
[48:11] this quote is a natural quote, but think
[48:14] of it spiritual. When you see a woman
[48:16] acting like a man, she's got out of her
[48:19] place. When you see brother Dale acting
[48:22] like Jehovah God, I'm out of my place.
[48:30] You see in the beginning, see, all
[48:32] right, she's supposed to I think it's a
[48:34] shame that woman has lost their dignity,
[48:37] their feminine place. It's a disgrace. I
[48:41] tell you it is. It is. And you know, I'm
[48:43] going to say this and I know it's
[48:46] talking about you women here. I know
[48:48] it's not talking about you women and and
[48:50] this is the same applies today. This is
[48:52] a message uh this is a grand message for
[48:56] the spirit around us.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Uh I'm not I'm not talking about in the
[49:01] individual. I mean I'm I'm the woman
[49:03] spiritually speaking. So if I'm
[49:05] preaching I'm preaching to myself.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; But of course if it hurts it just does.
[49:10] But look here. Let me ask you something.
[49:13] It used to be that a woman was so
[49:16] feminine till a man would go talking to
[49:20] them and they would blush.
[49:30] Oh, what is blushing anyhow? I haven't
[49:33] seen it for so long. Won't even know
[49:36] what it is. was if some woman blushed,
[49:40] they haven't got any dignity left
[49:43] anymore.
[49:45] That's all the fine feminine spirit. Now
[49:49] watch this. Now we are the feminine side
[49:51] of God. We come out of the side of God
[49:54] in Genesis 1:26-27.
[49:57] And so and and I know we we are the
[50:00] feminine side of his deity. But until we
[50:02] sit on the throne and judge the world,
[50:09] Wow.
[50:10] We have we should be ministering message
[50:13] ministers should be ministering as to to
[50:16] brother Bram said last week is to throw
[50:18] your arms around everyone.
[50:20] Let God sort it out.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Every time he brother Bram divine he he
[50:25] he he explained that denominational
[50:28] spirit was to build walls. I got it and
[50:30] you don't.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; I got a revelation that you don't got.
[50:37] Amen.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; Ne quote here he says now I want to put
[50:48] some things this time he said make it
[50:51] something to worship. So his attributes
[50:54] produce this. And when he made a man in
[50:58] a man, he looked lonesome. And now he
[51:01] showed now his great mind. And what had
[51:04] in the picture was Christ and the
[51:07] church.
[51:08] And Christ is our head.
[51:11] And we are the church or we are the
[51:13] bride or we are the wife. You can just
[51:15] call it whatever you are. And when we
[51:18] start acting like the head,
[51:20] we've missed it. Yeah,
[51:23] &gt;&gt; we might be the neck and he loves us
[51:26] greatly, but when we become Jehovah,
[51:32] &gt;&gt; we're out of our place. And I and I'm
[51:35] I'm
[51:36] I believe God believes a lot of us are
[51:39] out of our place
[51:41] &gt;&gt; and we're pushing them around.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; You can't push that around. We found
[51:47] that out this week. Yeah.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; If God decides to take your little baby,
[51:51] you can push all you want. He's still
[51:53] God.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; And he took not the different piece of
[52:03] clay, but he made the woman. See, now
[52:05] he's shown this spiritually, but he took
[52:07] it from the side of Adam, the rib, and
[52:09] he took the spirit of Adam, the
[52:11] feminist,
[52:13] and he put it in this rib. And when you
[52:15] see a man that acts there's
[52:17] something wrong.
[52:19] But when you see a woman,
[52:22] that's the church
[52:25] &gt;&gt; that acts like God, a man, there's also
[52:29] something wrong.
[52:37] I'm telling you, there's there's a lot
[52:40] of spirits that are wrong in the
[52:43] ministry
[52:45] in our ranks today.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; God knows it.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; God God knows it. It's It's the dead
[52:52] truth.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; You can You can ask God for something,
[52:58] but you don't order him to do anything.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; It won't work out so good for you.
[53:08] You see
[53:10] there's something wrong the two
[53:12] different spirits all together but
[53:14] they're together when they make united
[53:18] here. Let's just go to our next one and
[53:20] then we're going to go into a scripture
[53:21] and probably we'll close with this into
[53:23] Acts. He said you're nothing as long as
[53:26] you think you're think that you're
[53:28] nothing.
[53:30] The Bible said that when a man thinks
[53:32] himself something, he's nothing. And
[53:34] he's nothing that he ought to be. That's
[53:36] exactly right. Did I read this one
[53:37] already?
[53:39] &gt;&gt; I don't think I did. If I did, I'm
[53:42] sorry. You think you
[53:45] Now come down and empty yourself. I
[53:47] don't Man, I feel like I did. You're
[53:50] trying to fill yourself up. I'm sorry if
[53:52] I did.
[54:02] I apologize if I did,
[54:05] but the biggest job for the church and
[54:07] the individual is to empty itself.
[54:09] That's rough, but it's good. He said,
[54:11] "And though," I'm positive I didn't
[54:13] read. And though doing this, I was
[54:16] reading a medical journal and I believe
[54:18] it was the Reader's Digest. And now, now
[54:22] watch this. This is our prophet showing
[54:23] us something years ago. how that it's
[54:26] changed the course of life
[54:30] for people.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; It's even perverting men and women.
[54:41] Listen now, if you just jump to
[54:43] spiritual, it's perverted the church
[54:47] that men are becoming more like a woman
[54:50] and women like a man and men are
[54:53] becoming cisified and women are becoming
[54:56] masculine,
[54:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:58] &gt;&gt; And and that that's the truth physically
[55:01] 100%. But that's the truth spiritually.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; And if it is for those people, they're
[55:10] off.
[55:12] They're really off. You know, I want,
[55:14] you know, and I I want to go to Acts 10,
[55:16] but I want to share something with you
[55:18] because I I I believe and I I've said
[55:21] this for years and and and please, I
[55:24] mean, you can take this for what it's
[55:25] worth, but we're at the end.
[55:28] We are at the end. Brother Brown totally
[55:31] believes he would go in the rapture.
[55:33] That was over 70 years ago.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; We're at the end.
[55:38] And I want to can I show you a type in
[55:41] the natural to the type in the
[55:43] spiritual? And then I want to go into
[55:45] Acts and I want to show where God
[55:48] rebuked Peter. And I'll close on that.
[55:52] And you know that Paul came to Peter.
[55:53] But I want to show you in Acts 10 where
[55:57] Peter
[56:00] gets rebuked by God.
[56:04] And I and this this is not politic. If
[56:06] you if you taking this as political,
[56:08] you're missing it. It doesn't matter
[56:10] what government is in either country.
[56:12] I'm not take I'm talking to the spirits.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Look at an arrogant spirit
[56:19] in studying this. You can study h
[56:23] history and every kingdom that's fell.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Thank you. It's because of arrogancy.
[56:32] Yeah.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Rome back in the Bible times fell
[56:35] &gt;&gt; because they were cocky.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; And we understand Revelation 13
[56:45] and the states is Revelation 13. And
[56:49] they'll f they'll force the world to
[56:51] worship the beast that those that our
[56:54] names are not in the lamb's book of
[56:55] life. Now watch this.
[56:58] They will collapse. That's prophecy.
[57:01] because of arrogancy.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Not because they're not strong, not
[57:06] because they're not wealthy, but it's an
[57:08] arrogant spirit. It don't matter what
[57:11] the president is.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; It's the spirit when you cross the
[57:16] border.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Watch this. By the very
[57:22] authority
[57:25] &gt;&gt; will be their downfall. Now watch how
[57:27] this has happened. All the Brinks
[57:30] country are countries that the states
[57:32] have invaded and tried to attack.
[57:38] The states is preparing to invade
[57:40] Venezuela.
[57:42] And I'll tell you,
[57:44] &gt;&gt; thus sayaith,
[57:48] brother Dale,
[57:50] it will not go well for them if they do.
[57:53] Because China has 62 billion invested in
[57:58] Venezuela's oil companies. And the
[58:00] smartest engineers of China are in
[58:03] Venezuela pumping the oil. And the
[58:06] states come out and put a tariff on any
[58:08] country that would buy Venezuela oil
[58:10] 25%. And they said, "Well, that's no
[58:13] problem. Russia can buy it all and China
[58:15] will buy it from Russia by the Chinese
[58:18] yen."
[58:20] And he said it will drop the use of the
[58:22] petro dollar which will literally
[58:24] collapse the finances of the states
[58:28] and because the states is putting
[58:30] missiles in Ukraine which is terrible.
[58:34] War is terrible no matter where it is.
[58:36] Remember politics it's not there there's
[58:38] believers in Ukraine that are going to
[58:40] die
[58:41] &gt;&gt; or could die.
[58:43] There's a message churches in Ukraine.
[58:45] Huge message people,
[58:48] &gt;&gt; but there's also message people in
[58:49] Venezuela. That's right.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; So, Russ has sent over two different
[58:54] kinds of their missiles and place them
[58:57] in Venezuela and they can hit every
[58:59] major city in the states from the s
[59:02] southern hemisphere in Venezuela.
[59:05] Yeah.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; So the dumbest thing the states could do
[59:09] is show their doineering
[59:12] egotistic
[59:14] &gt;&gt; attitude that we control the world.
[59:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; And it'll collapse them.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; It won't collapse because somebody will
[59:27] beat them in war. it'll collapse them
[59:29] because all the countries that that that
[59:32] arrogant spirit is attacking are joining
[59:36] together and they're dealing outside of
[59:38] the states.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; And so they said literally and now this
[59:44] this is politics. I'm going to go back
[59:45] to the Bible. They said literally it's
[59:47] costing the states almost 100 million to
[59:50] park the ships outside of Venezuela.
[59:53] And if they attack, they'll be destroyed
[59:55] because if Russia will attack back and
[59:58] if they don't attack, it'll be a step
[1:00:00] down that they've surrendered to the
[1:00:02] world.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; See how the arrogant spirit in the
[1:00:12] natural. Now watch the arrogant spirit
[1:00:15] in Peter.
[1:00:18] Oh, now we're going back to the Bible.
[1:00:20] Acts 10:13. And there was a voice that
[1:00:22] came unto Peter, arise and kill and eat.
[1:00:25] And Peter said, now he's bossing God
[1:00:27] around now. He said,"Not so, Lord, for I
[1:00:30] have never eaten anything that is
[1:00:32] uncommon or clean." And God came back
[1:00:35] and spake unto him again the second time
[1:00:37] and said, "God has cleansed."
[1:00:42] What? God has cleansed that not thou
[1:00:47] common.
[1:00:49] Now, Peter had forgot that he was the
[1:00:52] bride of God.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; And he's telling God, "I'll tell you
[1:00:57] what to do."
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; It didn't go so well for Peter.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; You see? See? See the spirit?
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Watch this.
[1:01:12] Verse 34.
[1:01:16] Just to to be faster. And Peter opened
[1:01:18] his mouth and said, "Of a truth I
[1:01:21] perceive that God is no respector of
[1:01:25] persons,
[1:01:27] but we are."
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Spiritually speaking, we are.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Wasn't many amens in that one.
[1:01:42] Brother Brandham had people sit on his
[1:01:44] platform that were baptized in a
[1:01:46] doctrine he preached against father,
[1:01:50] son, and holy spirit.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; And he said,
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; William Brandham said that they had the
[1:02:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; and that's what it'll take to go in the
[1:02:04] rapture.
[1:02:09] Now, you can either believe Brother
[1:02:10] Brandham or you can believe message
[1:02:12] preachers that say that's not possible.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter to me which one you
[1:02:20] believe, but it shows the spirit of
[1:02:24] doineering
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; masculine
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; and it's out of place.
[1:02:31] Verse
[1:02:33] 35. But let every nation that fearth
[1:02:36] him, that's God, fearth him, and
[1:02:39] workketh righteousness
[1:02:42] is accepted.
[1:02:45] Whoa. Oh, that can't be
[1:02:48] is accepted
[1:02:50] with him.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; But I thought it had to be my way.
[1:03:02] You see, brother Brham said that the the
[1:03:05] the rules of lack have changed. Men have
[1:03:09] become sisified. You can see that in our
[1:03:12] country especially. But women have
[1:03:14] become th I in studying this I've
[1:03:17] watched this. you know that that the
[1:03:19] average age in the like the 70s or 80s
[1:03:22] like what they were saying in the other
[1:03:23] countries but around the world no matter
[1:03:25] where you go the average age of that
[1:03:27] like 90% of girls were married was like
[1:03:30] just say 25.
[1:03:32] Now at like 45 there's only like 15%
[1:03:36] married. It's because the dominating
[1:03:40] spirit
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; is a masculine spirit that has invaded
[1:03:45] the church.
[1:03:46] Yeah.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; And the woman,
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; what happens physically happens
[1:03:55] spiritually.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Here in Acts two, and the word which God
[1:04:04] spake unto the children of Israel,
[1:04:07] preaching peace by Jesus Christ, he was
[1:04:10] the Lord
[1:04:12] of all.
[1:04:14] See, God is the Lord of all.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; And you may be his bride,
[1:04:20] but he hasn't given you the opportunity
[1:04:22] to start giving orders yet.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; If he had a My little grandson wouldn't
[1:04:30] have died.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Let's jump to 44. And while Peter yet
[1:04:42] spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell
[1:04:44] on them which heard the word. Oh, and
[1:04:48] they weren't message believers.
[1:04:52] And they of the circumcised which
[1:04:54] believed were astonished.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; And the message believers were
[1:05:00] astonished
[1:05:02] that there was people that had the wrong
[1:05:05] baptism that went in the rapture.
[1:05:10] And they were astonished, as many as
[1:05:13] came with Peter, because that the
[1:05:15] Gentiles
[1:05:17] also was poured out the gift
[1:05:22] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; And they were astonished.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying?
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Is this Bible? Is this Bible?
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Did I Did I read some message quotes?
[1:05:43] It's a spirit has changed in the
[1:05:46] environment in the world in the politics
[1:05:49] but it's also changed in the church
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; cuz Satan is no respector of like the
[1:05:56] government or the church government or
[1:05:58] the grocery store or this tabernacle.
[1:06:01] It's a blanket spirit.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; And you don't have to come into it.
[1:06:08] Yeah,
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; but it it's around us. I'm not even
[1:06:11] saying this church is into it, but it's
[1:06:13] around the churches.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Watch verse 47. Now, we I I've been in
[1:06:24] multiple churches where message people
[1:06:26] would forbid people that were outside.
[1:06:29] But watch what it says here. Can any man
[1:06:32] forbid water
[1:06:35] that these should be not baptized which
[1:06:37] have received the Holy Ghost
[1:06:40] as well as we
[1:06:47] as well as we
[1:06:50] yes God has blessed us with the the
[1:06:54] mysteries of the Bible and the secrets
[1:06:56] and all this thing but it don't it it we
[1:06:59] have to fight the arrogance spirit
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; because you live in a nice house where
[1:07:05] you got a heat and radiator and all
[1:07:06] this. You have to fight the arrogant
[1:07:08] spirit because you drive a nice there.
[1:07:10] That's not sinful in itself. It's the
[1:07:12] arrogant spirit that's sinful.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; You can have all that you have and still
[1:07:18] be humble. Say, "Oh, God, you've blessed
[1:07:20] me more than I deserve. Thank you very
[1:07:22] much for my breast and my house and my
[1:07:25] food and and I'm obese. I'm obese. I'm
[1:07:28] taking to myself now. and I eat too
[1:07:30] much. When when believers will like
[1:07:32] there will be believers in heaven that
[1:07:33] will die of starvation.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; You know what the sin is? The arrogant
[1:07:43] spirit.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; The arrogant spirit. By God's grace, I'm
[1:07:49] going to try to the best of God's I pray
[1:07:52] that God will keep our pulpit clean.
[1:07:55] Keep our capstone clean. We don't need
[1:07:58] to fellowship with an arrogant spirit.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; That that spirit is disgusting. And now
[1:08:07] now I just read Acts, but you know very
[1:08:10] well the story when Paul and Peter met
[1:08:12] up that Peter was Paul was stood Peter
[1:08:15] to the face
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; and rebuked him because he was a
[1:08:19] jellyfish
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; because he lived double life.
[1:08:27] Amen.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just just if if if it's all right.
[1:08:35] Mark 10. I I I'm not planning on going
[1:08:38] long, but we're we're in some good food
[1:08:40] right now. Just I I'll give you some
[1:08:43] stuff. This honestly, I I pray you hope
[1:08:46] that this is not brother Dale. I'm
[1:08:48] fighting with this.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Well, wait a minute. I was fighting with
[1:08:54] this on Monday.
[1:08:56] I went to go get those red chairs on
[1:08:57] Monday.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; When I got the news, you think I got
[1:09:01] blessed.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Mark 10:13. And they brought the young
[1:09:16] children to him
[1:09:19] that he should touch them. That's
[1:09:22] improper.
[1:09:26] And his disciples rebuked those that
[1:09:28] brought them,
[1:09:30] said they should use birth control.
[1:09:34] But when Jesus saw it, he was much
[1:09:36] displeased, and said unto them, "Suffer
[1:09:39] the little children to come on me, and
[1:09:41] forbid them not, for such is the kingdom
[1:09:43] of heaven. And verily, verily, I say
[1:09:46] unto you, that whosoever shall not
[1:09:47] receive
[1:09:49] the kingdom of God as a little child."
[1:09:51] Now, you know, if any of you seen a
[1:09:55] little child that had an arrogant and
[1:09:57] was sassing his parents, even though you
[1:10:00] weren't the parent, you'd want to go,
[1:10:01] "Woo!"
[1:10:03] You'd feel like it
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; and you'd use great restraints. Keep
[1:10:06] your hands in your pocket.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; But what about God?
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; God's a lot bigger than Brother Dale.
[1:10:18] Oh,
[1:10:20] you could barely
[1:10:22] were specs.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; He's Jehovah.
[1:10:26] It's the spirit. It's the all these
[1:10:29] things are pointing at the spirit. And
[1:10:31] I'm going to tell you ahead of time.
[1:10:33] First Corinthians is Jehovah. Every
[1:10:36] chapter Paul mentioned it.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Every chapter. It was unbelievable.
[1:10:43] Here, let me just close with I'll read
[1:10:45] just a few. Maybe we'll get just uh two
[1:10:47] or three quotes and then we'll close
[1:10:49] before we get into Corinthians
[1:10:52] here. In his trip to India, he said,
[1:10:54] "Don't you see the same arrogant spirit
[1:10:56] gets among denomination and denies
[1:10:59] Christians the brotherhood in the same
[1:11:02] way?
[1:11:04] And we are the products of God, every
[1:11:07] one of us. And we should be brothers
[1:11:12] closely knit together by the gospel."
[1:11:15] and in our motives and our ideas and
[1:11:18] everything we should give God for the
[1:11:22] relief and the furthering
[1:11:25] of the gospel
[1:11:28] and to bring together the brotherhood
[1:11:32] and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:11:37] Arrogant spirit can never do that.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:45] Next one.
[1:11:49] There's many of us and many of us do
[1:11:52] that in our lives. As soon people as
[1:11:55] soon as they become Christians.
[1:11:58] Oh wow. It's a good thing you're sitting
[1:12:00] down.
[1:12:04] says, "As soon as you become a message
[1:12:06] Christian,
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; you become arrogant
[1:12:12] and different." That's right.
[1:12:16] When they're just taking vice versa
[1:12:19] versa path and they're going backwards
[1:12:22] instead of forwards.
[1:12:26] This is this is brother Brown's
[1:12:28] preaching. So if you think I'm off,
[1:12:34] then more of you can get out of
[1:12:36] yourself. More room you the more you can
[1:12:39] get out of yourself, the more room you
[1:12:42] got for the Holy Ghost to come in.
[1:12:48] As soon as people become
[1:12:51] Christians, well, bless God, I'm not a
[1:12:54] sinner.
[1:12:56] Well, you just were five minutes ago.
[1:12:58] Well, bless God. I would have never No,
[1:13:00] but you did something way worse.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Bless God, my kids would never do that.
[1:13:07] Oh, be careful.
[1:13:09] Be very careful.
[1:13:22] You would not believe how much Brother
[1:13:23] Brown preached on this. You think I
[1:13:25] you're going to praise God when I get
[1:13:27] done this series? So am I.
[1:13:31] Brother Bram preached on this every way
[1:13:34] possible. Upside down and sideways.
[1:13:38] And I'll also tell you, brother Bram's
[1:13:40] life
[1:13:42] was not this.
[1:13:47] He was a Christian.
[1:13:53] And we are about the father business of
[1:13:56] the Holy Spirit and getting every soul
[1:13:58] saved that we can. You know, brother
[1:14:00] Brandham said, you know, and and and I
[1:14:02] know I know we got to take people to the
[1:14:04] the new birth and the baptism of the
[1:14:06] Holy Ghost. I know that. I know. Brother
[1:14:08] Bram said that the the the TV
[1:14:10] evangelists never took them far enough.
[1:14:12] I know that. But you know, brother said
[1:14:14] the only thing in the world that had
[1:14:16] value in it was saving souls.
[1:14:19] Do you know that a soul has to be saved
[1:14:21] before it can get a new birth and
[1:14:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost?
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; But we get sometimes we get so much in
[1:14:29] the revelation of deity and the seals
[1:14:32] and whatever that we never preach
[1:14:35] salvation.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; We just go straight to Holy Ghost. It
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; don't work that way.
[1:14:41] Don't don't go to the grocery store and
[1:14:43] tell people, you know, God sent a a
[1:14:45] prophet and and you know, the cloud came
[1:14:47] down and and you know, he had the
[1:14:48] Baptist. Like, that's all true, but
[1:14:51] they're not even saved yet.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; You got the cart ahead of the horse. You
[1:14:56] got the the horse eat the cows eating
[1:14:58] grass on top of the tree
[1:15:00] and the buggies underneath the tree. Why
[1:15:02] don't you just tell them that Jesus
[1:15:03] loves you and died for your sins?
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; He died for your sins. And then when
[1:15:10] they get saved,
[1:15:13] they can move on
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; to the fullness of a perfect net.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Getting every soul saved that we can
[1:15:26] just on the word or we are
[1:15:31] if we don't do that or we are
[1:15:36] and what's that big word and
[1:15:38] dilatory
[1:15:41] and arguing our little religious
[1:15:43] differences, splitting hairs.
[1:15:46] Such nonsense.
[1:15:49] No wonder faith
[1:15:52] is gone.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:08] I believe for God's
[1:16:11] chosen ones,
[1:16:13] whoever they are,
[1:16:15] we can lay down our splitting hairs,
[1:16:19] and just come in and feel each other's
[1:16:22] pain and what they're going through. I'm
[1:16:25] not saying compromise. I'm didn't say
[1:16:27] leave. The message is the truth. This is
[1:16:30] the message.
[1:16:33] But if the message has brought an
[1:16:35] arrogant spirit onto any so-called
[1:16:38] believers, they're not believers.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Because the revelation and the Holy
[1:16:46] Spirit, the spirit of Christ, the seed
[1:16:49] of God, and the nature of God will never
[1:16:53] bring an arrogant spirit on his wife.
[1:16:57] It'll never bring a hotty, arrogant
[1:16:59] spirit
[1:17:01] because it's out of nature.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:21] We have to be careful when ministers
[1:17:24] minister the doctrine of the message
[1:17:26] which is the truth.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; That we give room for people listen to
[1:17:33] me that can't comprehend it yet.
[1:17:37] We give room for people that God hasn't
[1:17:39] showed the re no man showed this to you
[1:17:42] Simon Barjonah but my father which is in
[1:17:46] heaven. It won't matter how great a
[1:17:48] five-fold ministry have or how much the
[1:17:51] theologians are they cannot reveal the
[1:17:53] mysteries of God to you.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; It's God that can reveal it to us.
[1:18:01] I mean, I can explain any a part of it
[1:18:04] to you upside down. And I've done that
[1:18:06] to different people and they just look
[1:18:08] at me like they're staring at a new gate
[1:18:09] at the fence. Like,
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; do you know there was things that you
[1:18:16] believe in this message, Brother Bram
[1:18:17] said, it don't take a revelation to
[1:18:19] understand,
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; but there's people that can't understand
[1:18:23] it.
[1:18:25] But you if but if you come after that
[1:18:28] and attack it, it shows that you're not
[1:18:31] even converted either.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; You don't attack somebody because
[1:18:40] they're different than you.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; God help us. I I I know God knows this
[1:18:53] is this this this has to be corrected
[1:18:56] before we leave this place.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you know all the other things
[1:19:02] like last Sunday the ones I showed you
[1:19:05] positively what our prophet brought.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; I mean this is the message
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; but it's been mis it's been mis
[1:19:15] construed
[1:19:17] in different ways.
[1:19:22] Yeah, it is.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; God help God help me.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; God help us to catch the spirit of
[1:19:33] Christ.
[1:19:35] Grace is still here on the earth.
[1:19:38] and grace here until God comes back in
[1:19:42] the it'll even still be here even when
[1:19:44] Christ comes back in the revelation
[1:19:46] because he's going to turn his grace to
[1:19:48] the Jews.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, they'll suffer for it. But even
[1:19:52] that is still grace. Yeah.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; See the spirit that wants to ex the
[1:19:59] spirit that wants to say grace is over
[1:20:01] is the same spirit that's arrogant
[1:20:03] saying well I got something you can't
[1:20:05] have
[1:20:07] that
[1:20:09] that's like parents dividing their will.
[1:20:13] Do you do you know do you know my uncle
[1:20:16] my uncle did this. He gave the farmland
[1:20:18] to his sons and give the daughters
[1:20:19] nothing. They're they're women.
[1:20:23] That's disgusting.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; But in the spirit realm
[1:20:30] sometimes
[1:20:32] people that hang around us,
[1:20:35] you know,
[1:20:37] just let God all brother Dale God's
[1:20:39] trying to say through brother Dale is
[1:20:41] let God decide who he gives his
[1:20:43] inheritance to.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Let God decide who he gives his
[1:20:49] inheritance to.
[1:20:52] Not very many cases the kids get to
[1:20:54] write the inheritance will.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:04] Wow. And I I I tell you and I mean if if
[1:21:08] anybody wondered about this, I would
[1:21:10] sure give them nicely, but a lot of
[1:21:13] these places in the message hub, I took
[1:21:16] two or three out and there was multiple
[1:21:20] There was multiple ones out. The ones I
[1:21:21] took out earlier out of Corinthians, I
[1:21:23] took two. There was like a half a dozen.
[1:21:25] Some of them right up to 64, 65.
[1:21:29] Prophet still dealing with the nature
[1:21:31] change.
[1:21:33] It's a spirit that's in the world right
[1:21:35] now.
[1:21:36] Do you know? Do you know that there's
[1:21:38] very few countries in the world, there
[1:21:40] is a few, that it's wrong to have a
[1:21:44] change in the natural?
[1:21:49] You know what I mean?
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Russia's one of them.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; They put people that they think they're
[1:21:57] something different.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; At the very least in jail
[1:22:03] because it ain't natural.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; And the seed of God will you will always
[1:22:08] have the characteristics of Christ and
[1:22:11] it was to save your brother even the
[1:22:14] unsavable. And I'm going to close with
[1:22:16] this. This is this is this is
[1:22:19] God tried to save Cain.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; He said if you do like your brother, you
[1:22:26] will also be saved.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Wow. It's true.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; And if you came from God, you'll have
[1:22:43] the same nature. If you're the seed of
[1:22:45] God, you'll have the same nature as God
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; and you won't know it's a cane, but
[1:22:53] you'll put out all the love and grace
[1:22:55] that you can to all those people. Say,
[1:22:58] "Jesus died for you." And if they go
[1:23:01] that far, then he did a lot more. He
[1:23:03] actually showed himself,
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; man. Let's stand.
[1:23:10] Amen. God help us. God help me. Amen.
[1:23:20] Brother Bram clearly taught that the way
[1:23:22] up with God was the way down. Emptying
[1:23:26] oursel out. Brother Bram said multiple
[1:23:29] times in studying this message, he said
[1:23:31] anytime God had a minister and he gave
[1:23:35] him just a little bit of blessing
[1:23:38] and he went out and bought a nice big
[1:23:39] fancy tuxedo,
[1:23:41] got a $100 haircut and got all puffed
[1:23:45] up.
[1:23:49] God could never speak through him again.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Because he thought he
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; was the God,
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; wrong spirit.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; The masculine feminine spirit.
[1:24:03] And anytime you see it jump,
[1:24:06] this ain't just physical spiritual. You
[1:24:10] can see the masculine spirit come in a
[1:24:12] feminine spirit
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; just like that.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; It's not natural. Amen. God help us.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; God help us. Amen.
[1:24:24] Amen. I believe we're going home soon. I
[1:24:27] really believe that. And if we don't,
[1:24:29] even if we don't, it's God if we don't
[1:24:32] go home soon, it's God's grace to the
[1:24:35] world, waiting for the last seat to come
[1:24:37] in. And he's relying on you and me, me
[1:24:42] having the right attitude and the right
[1:24:44] spirit to to bring that brother in.
[1:24:48] Maybe it's brother Fred driving back
[1:24:50] from out west
[1:24:53] that called me two or three months ago
[1:24:55] and his membership's over in the Dutch
[1:24:57] church, been there his whole life with
[1:24:59] his family and he wanted to send to the
[1:25:01] Dutch church and close his membership
[1:25:03] and move it over here
[1:25:07] and sign a piece of paper that he'd be a
[1:25:09] member of our church.
[1:25:12] It don't matter to me that he don't
[1:25:13] understand that. I'm not gonna go and
[1:25:16] humiliate and do something. You see what
[1:25:18] I mean?

[1:28:56] Jesus
[1:29:12] Christ
[1:29:14] is
[1:29:19] Lord God. We love you today. Lord God,
[1:29:23] we thank you for your grace and mercy on
[1:29:26] us, Lord God.
[1:29:30] Lord, as we we never read the quote that
[1:29:34] study, Lord God,
[1:29:36] all the different ones that you sent
[1:29:39] trials,
[1:29:41] tribulations to, Lord God, you did it
[1:29:45] because you had confidence
[1:29:48] in those people.
[1:29:50] When you sent trials to Job,
[1:29:54] you knew that he would stand.
[1:29:57] When you sent trials to Abraham and told
[1:30:00] him to go up and kill his son that you
[1:30:03] had gave him, you knew
[1:30:06] he would stand.
[1:30:10] Your prophet told us, Lord God, in this
[1:30:12] day that when God sends trials and
[1:30:14] tribulations
[1:30:16] to us, he don't send them to us because
[1:30:19] he don't love us.
[1:30:22] He sends them to us because he's got
[1:30:24] confidence.
[1:30:26] I will stand.
[1:30:31] Thank you Lord God.
[1:30:34] Thank you Jesus.
[1:30:39] Lord bless these beautiful people
[1:30:43] of Jesus Christ
[1:30:46] of your own blood in your mind before
[1:30:49] the foundation of the world. that you
[1:30:53] abundantly bless and take care of them
[1:30:56] Lord God. They show their friendship and
[1:30:59] kindness through us Lord God and support
[1:31:01] your work Lord God.
[1:31:04] Meet every need we pray.
[1:31:07] Bless you around the world Lord Jesus we
[1:31:09] pray. Jesus name we pray. Amen. God
