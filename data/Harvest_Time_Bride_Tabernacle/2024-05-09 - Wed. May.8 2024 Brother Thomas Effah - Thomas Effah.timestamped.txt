[21:16] even with the
[21:18] ground and the children within

[21:38] blessing to reading of his word you can
[21:40] have your
[21:41] seat thank you Lord you want to speak on
[21:45] the subject the
[21:48] hour of
[21:52] visitation the hour of
[21:56] visitation you are come to ch church
[21:59] because you have got an
[22:01] appointment
[22:03] right that is why you are
[22:05] here that's right you have an
[22:08] appointment with Jesus
[22:11] Christ therefore you have recognized the
[22:14] hour that you supposed to meet with
[22:17] Jesus that's why you are here yes sir
[22:22] amen and if you have recognized and he
[22:25] has made a promise and he has to meet
[22:27] with you and you have come then
[22:31] definitely something will happen
[22:34] you because he keeps all his
[22:39] appointments yes he does that's right
[22:42] the hour of
[22:45] visitation look at the scripture we read
[22:48] it's very
[22:50] sad for Israel a chosen
[22:54] generation a chosen Nation right that
[22:59] God has chosen them to make a
[23:02] showcase right to demonstrate his power
[23:06] to show his love to show his
[23:10] righteousness his manner of Life his
[23:16] conduct and they have the
[23:20] scripture God has spoken to them by the
[23:26] prophets so that they could not be in
[23:30] darkness and you know how they treated
[23:32] their prophets but however God spoke to
[23:39] them and they knew that there will be a
[23:43] coming mesiah right yes sir the
[23:47] scripture has explicitly it has really
[23:50] spoken of a coming
[23:53] mesiah and that coming Mah is not for
[23:56] anyone it he is for
[24:01] isra that is your king yes sir that is
[24:05] your
[24:08] God but
[24:11] suddenly when this King arrived when the
[24:14] Messiah arrived what did they do to him
[24:17] they call him a sinner they call him B
[24:21] they call him a witch they call him
[24:23] every name
[24:26] wow why they refuse to see their
[24:34] visitation they couldn't recognize their
[24:38] day
[24:40] sir friends and Jesus is speaking to
[24:43] them here you are going to suffer this
[24:47] you are calling my blood to come upon
[24:49] you and your children no stone will
[24:52] remain upon a stone this Solomon Temple
[24:55] that you are bragging that you are
[24:56] showing me there will be no stone upon
[24:59] in the stone
[25:01] right that's
[25:04] right it all come
[25:07] down and your enemies will come pass
[25:09] around
[25:10] you and blood will flow because you
[25:15] refuse to see the day of your
[25:21] visitation may God brother that is the
[25:24] word may God help us let it not happen
[25:27] to us any one of us
[25:29] yes sir to refuse our
[25:34] visitation as you sit there right there
[25:37] God has made a promise you are a child
[25:40] of
[25:41] God you are God's son you are God's
[25:44] daughter therefore all the benefit of
[25:47] Calvary belongs to you nobody can stand
[25:51] in your way when you are making your
[25:54] claim in the presence of God
[25:59] that's
[26:01] right but why what is
[26:04] happening what is wrong with God's
[26:06] children
[26:08] today have you forgotten our identity
[26:11] have you forgotten that you a child of
[26:18] God
[26:22] hey
[26:23] Jeremiah 8:12
[26:30] he said when they
[26:32] ashamed when they
[26:36] ashamed when they had committed
[26:41] Abomination n they were not at all
[26:49] ashamed neither could they
[26:53] brush wow therefore shall they fall
[26:57] among them that
[26:59] fall in the time of their visitation
[27:03] they shall be cast down see the
[27:07] Lord it will not be you were supposed to
[27:11] enjoy two
[27:15] visitations the first visitation is
[27:19] Grace the first visitation is
[27:22] [Applause]
[27:23] salvation and when you sh it when you
[27:26] really
[27:29] refuse right that visitation there is
[27:33] another visitation that is waiting for
[27:35] you and
[27:37] me the wrath of
[27:43] God that's what God is telling Israel
[27:46] here
[27:48] friends it's
[27:55] terrible in the Book of Luke Luke
[27:58] chapter 21 say verse number
[28:07] 20 and when he shall see Jerusalem
[28:10] compass with
[28:13] enemies then know that the disolution
[28:16] thereof is
[28:18] near then let them which are in Judea
[28:22] flee to the mountains and let them which
[28:25] are in the midst of it the
[28:28] part out and let not them that are in
[28:33] the countries enter there
[28:36] to for these be the days of
[28:42] Vengeance that all things which are
[28:46] written may be
[28:52] fulfilled and 24 he said and they shall
[28:56] fall by the edge of the SW
[28:59] and shall be led away captive into all
[29:03] nations and Jerusalem shall be thr it
[29:06] down of the genti until the town of the
[29:10] Gentiles be fulfilled
[29:15] right God speaking to Israel Jesus
[29:19] Christ the very God they were singing
[29:23] they were in expectation to receive
[29:25] Messiah
[29:28] he come right into their
[29:32] hands they refuse him they rejected him
[29:38] they call him
[29:41] B their own
[29:46] god what happened to
[29:49] them they were B they were occupied with
[29:53] Traditions they were occupied with the
[29:56] understanding they were occupied with
[29:58] man's theology man's
[30:03] understanding and it occupied their mind
[30:06] until there was no room for them to
[30:13] reason
[30:16] friends the bride we have come to the
[30:18] same place right may God help the bride

[30:54] Jesus amen thank you Jesus
[31:00] listen and Daniel was speaking here in
[31:05] Daniel chapter 8
[31:09] verse3 then I heard one Saint speaking
[31:13] and another Saint said unto that certain
[31:17] Saint who
[31:19] spake how long shall be the vision
[31:22] concerning the daily
[31:25] sacrifice and the transgression of the
[31:27] the solution to give both the sanctuary
[31:31] and the hor to be troen under the foot
[31:35] and he said unto me unto
[31:39] 2,300 days then then shall the sanctuary
[31:43] be
[31:45] cleans
[31:49] Hallelujah
[31:52] brother these people the sacrifice they
[31:57] were kill animals they were sacrificing
[32:01] animals unto God and they were eating
[32:05] meat and they were enjoying it and it
[32:07] became a tradition right
[32:12] go and when you read the book of Daniel
[32:15] they said no that will not happen we are
[32:18] really enjoying this sacrifice do you
[32:20] mean to tell me that this daily
[32:22] sacrifice will be taken away and what
[32:25] will be the business of the priest that
[32:27] is our business that makes us so unique
[32:31] among the people we do the
[32:36] sacrifice the daily sacrifice will be
[32:38] taken
[32:41] away they could not figure it out they
[32:44] could not understand how they are
[32:47] delivered they have been chosen they
[32:49] could not know that those sacrifices
[32:52] could not take away sin the the Bible
[32:54] said the iniquity of Jacob might be
[32:57] wiped away
[32:59] the iniquity of
[33:04] Jacob but any man blood couldn't do
[33:08] that blood of Bo and BLS could not do
[33:13] it so John come to introduce the lamb
[33:18] that they supposed to know that the
[33:19] daily sacrifice must be taken away and J
[33:23] comes but the prophet that not the
[33:26] prophet of all the prophets
[33:29] to introduce the sacrifice to introduce
[33:32] the Messiah Behold the Lamb of God that
[33:35] taking away the sins of the
[33:41] world you mean they didn't hear they
[33:44] heard
[33:45] it they were all at Jordan many of them
[33:48] were at Jordan many of them are the
[33:51] sacrifice that's the baptism the
[33:53] baptismal service they were all looking
[33:56] at what is happening
[33:58] they saw
[34:00] him they heard John introducing him that
[34:03] the when that sing me to baptize he said
[34:06] the one that I will baptize and the Holy
[34:09] Ghost will come upon him he is the
[34:11] Messiah he is our King and behold I
[34:15] testify unto you behold this man he is
[34:18] the Lamb of God that taketh away the
[34:21] sins of
[34:25] the thank you Jesus

[35:17] wounds in your hands then shall he
[35:19] answer those with which I I was wounded
[35:23] in the house of my
[35:25] friends they could not know
[35:29] that Jesus Christ the Messiah what they
[35:33] were doing to him they couldn't really
[35:36] understand that they were even
[35:37] fulfilling scripture they were killing
[35:40] him for him to wipe away the sins of the
[35:46] world but to them they kill him as a as
[35:50] as an outcast a man that you must really
[35:53] away with
[35:56] him they couldn't Place him in the
[36:02] scripture they call him a wicked man he
[36:04] has come to destroy our church he has
[36:07] come to destroy our
[36:09] systems away with
[36:13] him but he will come
[36:16] again that is why Israel is in trouble
[36:19] they refuse him but he's coming again to
[36:22] show him his
[36:24] palm he will show Israel his palm
[36:28] and they will ask him where did you
[36:31] obtain where did you get these
[36:34] wounds say you are the people that did
[36:37] that to
[36:39] me like they did to Joseph they weap and
[36:44] cry but you say don't cry for these
[36:48] things you did it for me to preserve
[36:51] life and that is why the Gentile bride
[36:54] has come in
[37:00] that is why we have also got our place
[37:03] for Israel rejection has given us
[37:07] acceptance to accept
[37:14] Christ The Hour of the
[37:23] visitation
[37:25] remember when Solomon the
[37:29] temple right in their own glare they saw
[37:32] the pillar of fire the cloud coming
[37:36] right into the temple that even the
[37:38] Bible said the ministers could not even
[37:41] enter into the temple to minister they
[37:44] saw the pillar of fire they saw God
[37:48] coming into his
[37:51] Temple but on that day when they lifted
[37:55] the son of man the Temple ve turn from
[37:59] top to bottom they supposed to know that
[38:02] something has
[38:05] happened but they couldn't
[38:08] recognize that the temple was hanging
[38:11] right
[38:12] there yes today friends the AR of God
[38:16] you are carrying God's act yes sir you

[39:11] Babylon and they shall be they shall be
[39:15] until the day that I visit them say the
[39:19] Lord then will I bring them up and
[39:22] restore them in his place
[39:28] God because they rebel against
[39:33] God said God had a tool in his hand and
[39:37] that to was
[39:41] Nebuchadnezzar to punish
[39:44] Israel they took away the vessels the
[39:48] golden cups they took everything
[39:52] away
[39:55] right go golden cab sitting in the
[39:59] temple of God has been removed from his
[40:03] place because Israel refused to see
[40:08] their
[40:13] visitation Brethren but thank God he
[40:17] said I will restore I'll bring all this
[40:21] ver back in the days of n in the days of
[40:24] Ezra he has to bring everything back to
[40:26] his place place that is why the Bri is
[40:30] back to a place that is the restoration
[40:34] God has restored is back to our place
[40:37] back to our position back to the message
[40:40] back to the
[40:42] [Applause]
[40:45] Bible

[40:58] brought forth the vessels of the house
[41:00] of God which Nebuchadnezzar has brought
[41:03] forth out of Jerusalem and had put them
[41:06] in the house of his
[41:09] God chapter 5:14
[41:12] Ezra and the vessels also of gold and
[41:15] silver of the house of God which NE
[41:19] nebar took out of the temple that was in
[41:22] Jerusalem and brought them into the
[41:25] Temple of Babylon do this SOS the king

[42:03] restoration V SM be put in their
[42:06] rightful place

[42:14] that
[42:17] command you can't stop God if God's what
[42:21] God's promise God's word brother there
[42:24] is no way you can stop it right that's
[42:26] right
[42:29] it will come to pass he used the king D
[42:34] he has to reinforce he enforced God's
[42:38] word so that the temple may be built
[42:41] again so that the vses may be put in
[42:44] their rightful places

[42:52] and say we are
[42:54] restored we are restored
[42:57] back to a rful place that God can see
[43:00] his image
[43:02] again he can see his reflection again on

[57:24] they are paying for their rejection
[57:36] now Jesus did not come by any accident
[57:43] he came how did he bring Jesus on Earth
[57:47] he brought him by the
[57:49] word and how is he going to bring a
[57:52] bride he will bring a bride by the word
[57:57] there's no way he cannot do

[58:05] by the
[58:07] word when Isaiah look what did he say he
[58:12] saw a virin shall
[58:16] conceive and he Proclaim
[58:20] it IAI what did you see I saw a virgin
[58:24] carrying a baby
[58:27] and what was that that was
[58:30] Emmanuel God With
[58:35] Us and said what did you
[58:37] see a son shall be given and the
[58:40] government shall be upon his shoulder He
[58:43] Shall be Called counselor Mighty God
[58:48] Everlasting
[58:49] father Mighty God
[58:57] it was never done in
[58:59] [Music]
[59:00] darkness it was proclaimed by the
[59:04] prophet it was a
[59:06] visitation God came into his
[59:13] people and they will bring the scure and
[59:17] then they will sing and they would they
[59:19] will sing the ssms they will sing the
[59:22] sons of Moses they will sing the Psalms
[59:26] but when the Vindication when the word
[59:31] was Vindicated in their
[59:34] day they could not see
[59:38] it they couldn't see
[59:40] it that is why Paul said you the
[59:43] Gentiles don't just be so that is proud
[59:48] or don't don't don't don't abuse your
[59:50] privilege as well because God
[59:53] intentionally Blended them amen
[59:56] amen true so that we can have chance
[59:59] amen that's
[1:00:03] right and the reason why Israel is
[1:00:06] suffering is because Pastor D and myself
[1:00:10] we are not ready to go
[1:00:12] right that's why they are suffering if
[1:00:15] the bread you're ready to go from this
[1:00:17] wicked foolish
[1:00:19] world this ad world this that is all
[1:00:25] kind of
[1:00:27] yes but people are happy to live in this
[1:00:34] earth depriving Israel their chance if
[1:00:37] the bre will live today Israel will have
[1:00:39] their peace God will visit
[1:00:45] them we are the people depriving
[1:00:48] them if we never we never get out of
[1:00:52] here God cannot deal with Israel
[1:01:03] friends you must know the time of your
[1:01:10] visitation when
[1:01:13] God comes your way can you really
[1:01:19] recognize him as your God that is why
[1:01:23] Hebrews 13 said
[1:01:26] Hebrews 13 let Brotherly Love continue
[1:01:29] Hebrews 13 chapter
[1:01:30] 1 be not forgetful to

[1:02:08] to be closed and some doors must be
[1:02:13] open and it's an opportunity to have
[1:02:15] fellowship with this
[1:02:18] group when you come to Ghana you see

[1:20:38] them down you know the
[1:20:41] story that's her OED came
[1:20:45] R she recognized the hour of her
[1:20:52] visitation Abraham
[1:20:55] God has called him he has really wored
[1:20:57] with God for several years
[1:21:01] unwavering he did not doubt his his
[1:21:05] mission he did not doubt his
[1:21:07] calling why are you doubting your
[1:21:12] calling did you not hear his voice when
[1:21:15] he call you the voice never change it is
[1:21:19] the same still small voice
[1:21:28] Abraham you get a child not this
[1:21:31] Damascus guy not a laser you will get a
[1:21:35] child that is my
[1:21:38] promise and the Bible say at the time of
[1:21:42] visitation just left for one year God
[1:21:45] visited him again when Abraham was 99
[1:21:48] years
[1:21:52] amen Abraham
[1:21:55] circumcise the hour has come that Isaac
[1:21:59] will not come from uncircumcision
[1:22:03] circumcise before Isaac will come
[1:22:05] Brethren let us circumcise our heart in
[1:22:08] this time of
[1:22:11] circumcision Jesus is
[1:22:15] coming the Son of God is coming the
[1:22:18] promis hand will be arriving soon
[1:22:21] circumcised our
[1:22:23] heart
[1:22:28] amen and after the
[1:22:31] circumcision he
[1:22:33] said as the manner of Life said when as
[1:22:37] a manner of life he said the woman they
[1:22:39] understand 28 days ABR explained he said
[1:22:42] 28 days Abraham ask Sarah what has
[1:22:45] happened to
[1:22:47] her 28
[1:22:50] days you understand that was the hour of
[1:22:54] visit
[1:22:55] the church the church refused to believe
[1:22:58] Sarah said it is not possible and I'm
[1:23:01] old woman that's the
[1:23:04] church that is the
[1:23:07] church but
[1:23:10] Abraham he
[1:23:14] believe it was that said the Lord yes
[1:23:17] [Music]
[1:23:19] sir when God
[1:23:22] remembered his day and come Moses
[1:23:26] Moses I I put you in the house of
[1:23:30] pharaoh for them to train you so that
[1:23:33] you know how to destroy them God himself
[1:23:36] put him
[1:23:38] there so that he can destroy
[1:23:42] Pharaoh sometimes if Satan get you into
[1:23:45] his territory and then he he's really
[1:23:47] treating you bad don't worry you are
[1:23:51] just looking at his strategy God just
[1:23:53] plac you right there to see his strategy
[1:23:57] said whether he's a left hand man or a
[1:24:00] right hand man so if Satan put you in
[1:24:02] the ring don't
[1:24:04] worry don't
[1:24:07] worry you are in the ring to obtain or
[1:24:12] to understand his manner of fight how he
[1:24:16] does his things that's why he plays with
[1:24:18] there he he placed Moses right in
[1:24:23] pharaoh
[1:24:27] house
[1:24:29] Brethren but when God remembered his
[1:24:33] visitation he said
[1:24:35] Moses I have been waiting for you so
[1:24:38] long what was happening with you where I
[1:24:41] just put you in Pharaoh's house to the
[1:24:43] appointed time but you have wasted much
[1:24:46] time you know what God did to him Moses
[1:24:49] have to kill an Egyptian and then when
[1:24:51] he kill Egyptian they put it in the
[1:24:53] dieses a wanted
[1:24:56] man a wanted man it appeared in all
[1:25:01] dieses PHA was looking for him so he has
[1:25:04] to run away so when God was watching his
[1:25:07] son his Prophet come in God was laughing
[1:25:10] look at that wanted man I am wanting you
[1:25:13] and then you are wanted in Egypt wanted
[1:25:15] man I'm wanting you
[1:25:17] Hallelujah he was a wanted man and God
[1:25:20] was looking for his man so something
[1:25:22] must happen for some some pressure to
[1:25:25] push him sometimes pressure will push
[1:25:28] you to meet with
[1:25:32] God to push you to meet with
[1:25:36] God so he met with God in uncertain son
[1:25:40] braam said we want to see church on fire
[1:25:44] so the lot of Moses will be attracted
[1:25:46] let Fire Fall let the people hear of
[1:25:50] this assembly that fire everybody will
[1:25:53] run here
[1:25:55] fire Holy Ghost
[1:25:58] Fire when they hear the power of God in
[1:26:01] this church when they hear the
[1:26:04] walk when they hear the dam speak when
[1:26:06] they hear the blind SE when they hear
[1:26:08] power of
[1:26:11] God it will cause
[1:26:14] attraction that is the Holy Ghost
[1:26:18] Fire the time of our visitation Abraham
[1:26:22] saw a human being that walk to
[1:26:26] him and he did the same thing he sent
[1:26:30] Jesus Christ to Abraham's
[1:26:33] seed a human
[1:26:36] being when Abraham saw a human being he
[1:26:39] wash his feet he gave him food flesh
[1:26:44] human being he did
[1:26:47] not deny him he recognized his
[1:26:52] visitation
[1:26:55] but when Jesus was given to Israel what
[1:26:59] did they do you bth you sinner you that
[1:27:04] you were born in fornication you this
[1:27:07] this you call him all several
[1:27:11] names Jesus said I forgive you but when
[1:27:15] the Holy Ghost
[1:27:17] come and you blashe again may God have
[1:27:21] Mery on us not to blaspheme the Holy
[1:27:26] Ghost listen
[1:27:29] friends today Israel rejected brother
[1:27:34] said Messiah appears to those that are
[1:27:37] waiting for him Israel was waiting for a
[1:27:39] mesiah Samaritans were waiting for a
[1:27:42] messiah we Gentiles we were not waiting
[1:27:44] for any
[1:27:47] Messiah so Mah could not come to
[1:27:51] Earth so when Mah was on Earth you
[1:27:53] remember he told the disciples do not go
[1:27:57] to the way of the Gentiles Matthew
[1:27:59] chapter 10 don't go there it is not
[1:28:03] their
[1:28:04] day because we were not supposed to see
[1:28:08] any Messiah we were pagan people we were
[1:28:11] worshiping Idols that was not our
[1:28:14] day but he revealed himself to the
[1:28:20] predestinated look at Andrew when Andrew
[1:28:24] saw him when John pointed to him this is
[1:28:27] the Lamb of God that taketh away the
[1:28:30] sins of the world and you said Master
[1:28:32] you finish your work you finish your
[1:28:36] work you have baptized me but this man
[1:28:40] what did you say say it again this is
[1:28:42] the Lamb of God that take away the sins
[1:28:46] of the world say byebye master you
[1:28:47] finish I will follow this man because my
[1:28:51] sins are settled I'm settled with sin I
[1:28:55] will follow this man to to take my load
[1:28:58] my sin load from
[1:29:02] me when he stay with him and then he saw
[1:29:06] the sign of the Messiah after he has
[1:29:09] told him all things master I am not the
[1:29:13] only one waiting for you if you see
[1:29:15] Jesus call your friend said let me go
[1:29:18] and call my brother
[1:29:20] Peter wait I'll call Peter

[1:31:38] not our day but the Samaritans they got
[1:31:41] their day why because they will have you
[1:31:45] have genter and they were waiting for a
[1:31:47] messiah remember what the woman said he
[1:31:51] said the scripture says that mesiah will
[1:31:56] come and that Messiah will be Christ by
[1:32:00] the way who are you because you are
[1:32:02] manner you manner how you are conducting
[1:32:05] yourself you look like you are a prophet
[1:32:07] Jesus said woman I speak with you I am
[1:32:12] he why that was her
[1:32:16] visitation Jesus could not deny her
[1:32:19] Jesus could not hide he has to expose
[1:32:23] himself to a child of
[1:32:27] God
[1:32:31] friends this is our day for us to see
[1:32:36] Messiah amen amen let
[1:32:39] nobody say is God but let nobody also
[1:32:43] say that God did not visit us in
