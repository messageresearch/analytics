scriptures you know that we can bring up and St because the word of God is life Christ Jesus said you are clean through the word that I've spoken unto you and therefore let's just read yall find it say amen and I will read it said the Apostle uh saying tonight he said for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in my places he said wherefore take unto you the old Armor of God that you may be able to withstand we're going to look at two two two words there to withstand in the evil day which mean in the evil H right it's not Monday Tuesday Wednesday Saturday it's in the evil time and having done all you must remain standing you see that am God bless you be seated the the position that you're found in you may be seated the position that you're founding after the fight is very important so let me say God bless you everybody Welcome to amen my my country folk y'all if they're all from Jamaica they are my king my king my family and so it's so good to have them and you know so I'm I'm honored having them amen you know and I tell you those that were in the the the

and but they enjoy the whole service huh the barn Revival or the Revival the Revival was in the barn because we are the Revival you believe that we're not looking for no great Revival we are the Revival you're looking at it you know you're looking at the Revival glory to God Amen and so you know as I said the Saints back home just praying for these service and and we appreciate it for those that you know watching just the same and you know just a few minutes I want to spend with you tonight and let's just talk about standing after the fight the enemy of our faith he hates Unity because he knows that Unity can create strength a house that is divided by itself cannot stand it's weak has no substance it may look painted on the outside but it's weak and the more we fight against each other the more we try to tear each other apart is the weak we're getting and I'm not your enemy Brother D is not your enemy brother junior is not your enemy we are fighting spiritual warfare here and what you see happening in the natural it's happening in the spiritual too we are we are not wrestling against flesh and blood it's principalities and the here we know what they're doing the system is rising against us they're tampering with the food they're they're tampering with the water God knows what we're eating I can tell you that SS of God God knows what we're eating he takes the grace of God in this last day the more you fight against me and we fight Saints what is happening the time that we ought to be praying for each other protecting each other so that you build a perameter around me praying for me protecting me what is happening Satan is just laughing at us because he's jealous of us he knows who we are he knows what we have and we ought to know more than him glory to God hallelujah but in all of what is happening we're watching the news and oh my God this world is turning upside down war in heav sh Civ the war rising in almost every country around the world World we're not surprised because Jesus told us of that in Matthew 24 what to expect before the end he said when you see the wars he said the end is not yet but these things must come to pass all I am saying what is happening out there we cannot allow the condition to crumble us we got to strive in more strength and unity his strength you pray for me I pray for you you May worth a dollar I may worth a penny you may worth half a dollar we cannot kick each other aside God has a place for the pennies too every one of us have purposes in the kingdom of God and I say it like this amen Elijah never taken the Ravens to heaven when he went up he never taken the widow woman to heaven when he went up no but every one of us have a purpose in the kingom of God hallelujah glory to God it no man it's no time for segregation and the hatreds to flow through ush it's time of the perfect love of God that can heal even the sick ones Among Us May the love of God prevails than you Jesus he's the god of paradox in all that Journey in the wilderness in the midst of unbelief and disrespect to God under the anointing of their messenger Moses God was creating another generation he was preparing another generation Amen to take the spoken word leadership under Joshua to cross over the promis alive what about this Day saints of God in all the world is falling apart it's more than just singing I am glad that Jesus is in my heart it's more than that I believe God is creating another generation to take the spoken word leadership we are crossing over the alive how we shall not all sleep but we shall all be change glory to God hallelujah amen we're not all going to sleep God knows in this last day a generation has to stand up you're talking about a generation stand for the truth nothing but the truth uh Hallelujah if you put my head to the guillotin I shall look death in the face and said oh de where is dting oh grave where is thy victory victory is found on the word of God my friends brothers and sisters the solution is in the word it's not in the economy it's not in the governments every one of them are confused sir you see you heard what I just said my brothers every one of them are confused but God's word stands he said that heav and Earth shall pass but my word will never pass Hallelujah I rather stand on the word of God than any man's ideas I rather stand on the word of God than on any any Economist ideas I rather stand on the word of God that even in this church because buildings will fail but God's word never fail lasten did the night did the day at the convention amen this is a time that we ought to train our senses Hallelujah to be align with our purpose and we got to tr train our our senses to listen to our calling when we know our calling saints of God our lives are relying with a purpose Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of My Life whom shall I be afraid why because that's a time when you know your purpose you fear no evil why because the Lord your God he is with you David said if I make my bed in hell he is there GL he never let you because you're Carri on of a purpose so we look here brother Paul was exalting the Ephesian Church you know how interesting it is brothers and sisters here in the same the in the same letter that he wrote the uh the page before this I called it page they put it in chapters but in the previous page it was just had ising the church notice how we call them saints that are in Ephesus he assur them of who they were amen when he start the letter Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us with water word who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he never stop there Ephesian 1 verse when he told them we're the world Hallelujah glory to God Christ Jesus Hallelujah he's in the Heavenly places he told him that further on he would tell you where you are you are not just a go you are not just in Canada Jamaica or in Africa he says you are in Christ Hallelujah you are in Christ Jesus and where're Christ is that's where you are the word said Jesus Christ is in every places uh far above all powers and principalities uh Hallelujah and if he's there that's where you are is where you are Hallelujah outside of that you can be anywhere but when you're in Christ you are exactly where he is right Hallelujah know your calling understand your election when your fullness of your election is known to you you have nothing to fear you know who you are you know what where you're going you shall shred upon lions and serpents you shall shred upon the ladder the word of God Says with long life will he satisfy you he will show you his salvation W that's the word of God Psalms 91 and the last few verses said that we talk about then he said one page of the letter he was reminding them that they were the wife of Christ Ephesians 5 he said you're the wife of Christ he called you with a holy calling you are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh he's the right and how he would present the church unto himself without spot or wrinkle any blemishes what an assurance is that right Saints oh church when you read that part of a letter coming from a great Apostle oh you would jump and you would dance because you feels good remember what he said to a church one time he said you cannot be established unless you're established according to what my gospel Hallelujah and when you hear that word coming from him it lift your Assurance it strengthens your confidence when he tell you that you are not just ordinary but you are the wife of Christ you are everything that Christ is that's who you are oh saints of God that part of the letter would have worth more than just amen it would have worth a shouting Hallelujah glory to God Amen but then the next page he be he pulls you from here to here when he should look here even though you're the bride of Christ and he choose you before the foundational world you are not called to a picnic but you are on a [Applause] Battleground glory to God Amen you're on a Battle Ground Hallelujah and he reminds you look you're not fighting against flesh and blood but this is a spiritual war are Fe saints of God do you know when even sickness attack your body it's a demon do you know can I say this from this Pulpit do you know some of the sicknesses that rises up those well-trained doctors don't even know what it is but they have to give you something they have to write you something and when they write it give you you had faith in the doctor you go to the pharmacy and you have faith in what they says and you take it believing it's helping you what about faith in the word of God what about faith in the word of God I'm getting I'm not a scientist or or a psychologist but I'm getting to understand that even the doctors are confused today but they're afraid to say it that we are in a spiritual warfare woo God [Applause] hallelujah have known a situations where doctor tell patients to go home because I don't see anything wrong with you go home because I don't know what's wrong with you there some of them are honest enough to say that oh God why it's truth it's a war fear against the rulers of Darkness of this world there will witchcrafts on every side demon possessed and every side demons all over don't look for them with great when we were kids they used to tell us that you would have seen Satan with a long fork and a long tail and two horns and he's ugly looking oh but since I'm grown I get to see them all over they're in jacket and ties they in white shirts they are well decorated they have their PHD and the LD oh God hallelujah because Satan is himself in like angels of light deceiving whom he made my God huh my Lord but the wrer says Paul said to them I want you to put on the whole armor of God it's not this it's not a physical garment the whole armor of God is the word of God because every solution that you have need of is in the word of God when you put on when you clothe in the remember Jesus tell them Jesus said to them in John chapter 15:3 he said you are clean to the word is that right it's the word that builds you you are secured in the word it's the word that will preserve you Hallelujah so the whole armor of God is the word of God I'm not talking man's ideas I'm talking the undiluted word of God he said put on the the whole armor of God that you may be able to what withstand the word withstand there in the Greek it means that you may be able to remain undamaged unaffected that you may be able to stand opposed with firm determination can I say this brothers and sisters I mean undamaged mentally undamaged spiritually undamaged physically sometime it's your mental state that cause your physical state to damage it thought from the Mind sometime and you wonder brother Bley I'm feeling so sick sometimes it start from the mind your mind start to get damaged but keep your eyes on Jesus look full in his wonderful face and let the things of this world become strangely dim Hallelujah any great preacher any great man no matter how powerful you are if you stop to focus on the chaos of world it will affect you mentally sir you heard what I said it will definitely destroy you can I go deeper with that if you stop to pay attention Hallelujah to every conditions going on in the church World it affect you worst because people go to the church to find life and sometime they get not even life they leave worse than how they came am I preaching today Hallelujah but when Christ is in the vessel Hallelujah glory to God so you you a man GL you know why you cannot leave your damage can I say this God don't want to damage br Hallelujah you cannot leave your damage you got to be able to withstand why would God bringing you out of here damage go back and read when children of Israel was leaving Egypt God didn't never drag them by the feet they came out here properly they left wealthy too Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah I'm sorry for those who preaching that God is going to drag you drag you out to your poor oh my God and man no desire in you and you're going to look so brok and down as if Satan trampled you no way you're leaving here undamaged hallelujah glory to God get your minds right brothers and sisters get your minds right and the way to get your minds right is to focus on the word because what you have up here will affect your behavior what you have up here will affect the way you look how do you look like that I never forget brother junor preach a message at church he said come on saying startop tell a bunch of survivors he said you're Overcomers and they forget that word don't tell me you're surviving tell me you're overcoming you should have want you to withstand everything in the Heba day this time my Lord do you know nowhere is safe in the world anymore but in Christ absolutely nowhere Howen nowhere is safe only in Jesus Christ Christ I can testify to you when I go my bed at night I I just got to sleep in Jesus Oh Bley I've got a AK47 when you're sleeping it's sleeping you heard me H brothery I've got a war tunker up my G when you're sleeping it's sleeping that's right but when I'm resting my Jesus is watching he that keepeth Israel does not slumber nor sleep he shall give his angels charge over you to Bear you up in their hands they don't sleep oh God hallelujah Glory I'm preaching just the same now he said again saw that but then he said having done all of that you must remain standing the natural type is spiritual can I can I use the boxing match there are two there are two results we call it unanimous decision when the judges come together and and decide who win according to points now in spiritual warfare there's no unanimous decision there's a TKO somebody got to remain standing oh God hallelujah somebody got to remain stand read something here from amen second Corinthians chapter 4 said this to the Corinthians Church oh we got to remain standing so there is there's no judges around us going to said well he won no they're going to find me standing is that right brother Dale above all stand you know standing position tells a lot if I the end of the match and you you are the one Ling on the carpet or the canvas what they call it oh you're in trouble you're damag you're being affected by some punches woo God hallelujah Above All I Want You to remain stand this you know the position the posture speaks a lot going to show you shortly in the word it means something all right glory to God now the Apostle said in second is it 2 Corinthians chapter 4 verse 7 he said but we have this treasure in Earthly vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and what not of us behave yourself it's not you it's not a big preacher it's the power of God is that right glory to God for we are troubled on ever side yet not distressed we are perplexed but but not desp not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down you need to get up you're going to get a few punches come on Brother D you're a pastor great man I love you to my whole heart I respect you you may get a few punches but get up there are seven in this match there are seven counts seven hes you need to get up the thing about this match is fixed because Oh Our God fixed that it's fixed he already know before the foundation of the world that's why he told you Romans chapter 8 he said you are more than conquerors say when you get a knockdown amen the holy spirit is whispering in your ears remember who you are you are more than conqueror get up you may be knocked down you are not destroyed Hallelujah rise up again with strength because you are more than conqueror the word says a conqueror is one who wins if God call you conqueror he knows what he created in you he knows he created the attribute of a winner one who wins one who subdue so after Jesus Christ ascended after his work of the Messianic attribute was accomplished Steven saw him turn to Acts chapter 7 Bible studies were here don't be afraid to scroll this it's all here hallelujah the word standing means having completed a task a particular role glory to God above all at the end of this you must be found standing upright upright position glory to God and brother stepen amen from verse 54 I it from verse 54 and you know what happened when he he told them the truth hallelujah they gather in stone to destroy him the Bible said but when they heard these things there were cut to the heart and they nashed on him with their teeth but he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and he saw the glory of God hallelujah it wasn't crying and whining he knew what those stones meant Hallelujah I knew any time now I'm be hitting all over but he looked up oh I love that being full of the Holy Ghost don't leave that out being full of the Holy Ghost you're able to look up into heaven and he saw the glory of God and he saw Jesus standing isn't that important standing on the right hand of God and he opened his mouth and let them know what he saw he said behold I see the heavens open and the son of man standing on the right hand of God hallelujah notice right hand doesn't mean that God of a right and the left it means Authority he was at the authority of the father why was he standing because he had completed amen the Messianic purpose that he came for we saw when the lamb came in Revelation 5 and taken the book Hallelujah not just to look upon it but he release the seals thereof uh Hallelujah change the atmosphere of the Apostle John as he was crying because no man was worthy to take the book to loose the seal and to look upon it but the Angels said John weep not because the lion of the tribe of Judah he has prevailed oh when that scene and that atmosphere changed the Apostle hallelujah amen There song Revelation 5:9 There song a new song Hallelujah a new generation has to learn this song Thou Art Worthy thou are worthy to take the book Hallelujah to lose the seeds thereof because you have redeem us by thy blood out of every Kindred and T and Nation hallelujah thank you Lord he completed that task but the apost saw him in Revelation chap 4 2 to look at it and I show you he was seated amen there was one sat on the throne not three not two but one Hallelujah whose Throne this is Jesus already told Apostle John hallelujah oh I'm showing you something don't leave understand this he saw him once sitting on the throne when he said in verse one after this after he had given John this the instruction to write these letters and send them to the angels of the seven churches in Asia then he said after this I looked and behold the door was open in heaven Hallelujah and the voice which are heard was that it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither Hallelujah and I will show thee things Hal which must be out immediately hours in the spirit amen and behold a throne you heard that a Throne was set in heaven and one sitting on the throne he wasn't standing anymore his position changed hallelujah how Glory his position changed bride of Christ brothers and sisters notice what he said further on and he that sat upon was to look upon like a Jasper and staring Stone who was that that was Christ Jesus the Lord himself changing his position why amen and roundabout and there was a rainbow where was that round about the throne in slight like unto a hamor amen the first time the rainbow was after the flood when God Almighty amen told Noah I will no more again destroy everything for man's sake there is a covenant of Life a rainbow with seven colors God said that's a covenant between me and H what was that a covenant of life but now the Apostle caught up in a vision and he see the rainbow around the throne Hallelujah for God so loved the world Hallelujah that he gave his only begotten son a covenant of Life uh still open arms right now no matter who you are that Covenant of life is still ready to receive you thank Jesus it's around the throne Jesus said I am sitting in my father's Throne God is a spirit John chapter 4:24 a spirit don't need a cheer to a spirit is on the present but Christ Jesus was the fullness of the godhead bodily Hallelujah glory to God the prophet said when Jesus left here it was word going back to word Spirit going back to Spirit Hallelujah but the body they are representing Christ Jesus sitting why because the word of God said let's just go further down oh

Jesus are Greater Works than these shall you do because I go to the father I'm saying what the word says hallelujah glory to God but then watch Revelation chapter 10 jump over we preaching the word woo glory to God Revelation chapter 10 verse one I know some of you know it so well yes [Music] Hallelujah there's a throne promise to you in Revelation 3: 211 Jesus said if you overcome look at the condition turn to Revelation 3: 21 first because some of us want the throne and we don't want to overcome if you overcome as what as I overcame did he say that you will sit beside me now now you will sit where in my Throne I have I overcame and I am sitting now in my father's Throne Christ Jesus will be coming back on Earth that's where his throne is Oh Glory to God oh yeah you said I'm sitting he never said beside my father he said I'm sitting in enclosure on or in in I am in the authority of the father again in the beginning was the word I'm not talking when he came I'm talking before John before Adam in the beginning was the word and the word and the Word was with God was God that was were Adam Hallelujah it was the Apostle John that wrote this when did John write this after pmas who saw the fullness remember Jesus stood there and all them theci Peter who got the greatest revelation of the time and Jesus and and and and and the Bible said that disciple whom Jesus loved that was John all right and everywhere to go and John was the youngest among them and everywhere to go Jesus would carry that one and then one Time Peter was saying why is he coming Peter you know you know why is he following us all over and Jesus said what is it to you if he hallelujah what is it what is it to you if I say he will stay here till I come one of you shall see the son of man coming in his glory just it oh Hallelujah John was was to be lifted up I'm not talking the Apostle Paul Paul said I was caught up in the third heavens and I've seen things that I cannot even hutter but John every part of God he never heard it he sh it he saw on the throne 24 Elders four Beast he heard the songs that they were singing he saw the ceiling of Israel again how could Sean in his in his natural mind good sh when I open my mouth all in heaven heard me all on hurt all HT even in the sea heard me how could he say that because he saw himself in an infinite stage oh Hallelujah glory to God hallelujah is that right ah and so here he was so Jesus said if you overcome as I overcame how did he overcome if I say to you if you drive like how I drive then you're going to get a a truck I'll tell brother Lauren to give you a truck if you drive the way I drive so what would be your respon what be what would be your desire you need to know how I drive so that you can get your reward is that right yeah you got to know how I drive so how did Jesus overcome the Bible did tell you he told you in Hebrews chapter 5:8 he learned obedience through suffering Jesus never complained one day so each suffer each things that he went through he was learning learning process a learning process I think we preached here today in parot said are you a king of the Jew Jesus said you said it but you in a poor little pilot Jesus said actually it this is the reason I'm here oh Hallelujah this is the reason I'm here for this purpose I came in the world so this that you have on me it's not even you do it it's purpose Oh Glory to God hallelujah hey this UNC for a shle that you have me pilot Baby pilot this is purpose fulfilling this is God this is actually my purpose no man take my life I lay down Philippians chapter 2 said something here let's look at what it says Philippians chapter two woo glory to God I just love the word of God Philippians chapter 2 brother Paul is a great Apostle to the Gentile no one they said I magnify my office he said there are two gospels he said Peter get one and I get one he said Peter got one and I got one said Peter you go Peter God give you the gospel to the the circumcised but he give me those to the uncircumcised Oh Glory to God remember when they came and they shook their hands and said guys you go to the to the to to the Heathen these were people that had the Holy Ghost are you right is that right they're filled with the Holy Ghost coming from Pentecost but they were still calling those that they heard that God was manifesting among them the same way God manifesting among you they shook their hand and said God go with you you need to go to the Heathen even when they came from Pentecost had problem act chapter 15 tell you that read the book it's there Hallelujah so God so the apostles said here is it Philippians chapter 2 and the amen verse 6 speaking of Jesus I'm going to read six before I read five he said Christ who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God he was God but he made himself of no reputation who made him he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion of a man he humbled himself Glory Hallelujah he humbled himself I think that's supposed to be the first Hallelujah manifestation of a born again child of God humility humble yourself became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross which the ultimate most disgraceful punishment that was during the time wherefore God had highly exalted him ah glory to God hallelujah he was exalted him he was exalted and given him a name above every name oh Hallelujah before you can be exalted let's do the formula right humility humility obedience you want the right result you need to apply the right formula is that right humility obedience and the result will be right you'll be exalted don't exalt yourself Hallelujah we know nothing is that right chames it's all about God I know nothing I never try to project my own knowledge I hate that I actually I even hate who I was I hate who I was until Christ came in my life I'm learning to love people more when Christ is in you you love people hallelujah it's about love it's not about me standing up here trying to project my knowledge when I understood my purpose I spend my time in the Bible so I don't know it because I study it the Holy Spirit revealing it to me to us so what I'm saying to you right now y'all know it Oh Glory you know it it's right there before you but what God want us to hear tonight that's what I'm saying amen hallelujah that's what I'm sharing with my brother my king folk my sharing with you that's what God want us to here tonight praise be to God so I'm not saying something to you that you never know I'm not saying something you that oh I fabricated and bring it to you it's right here in the Bible it's right here in the Bible Oh Glory to God hallelujah so he was exalted after he humed himself and became obedient to his purpose Revelation chapter 10 so you still want the throne that Jesus Promised You you still want it anybody still morning it oh glory god let's mix the formula humble yourself become obedient overcome like he did Hallelujah glory to God oh brother Bley I'm studying the word because I want a throne I'm sorry you're going the wrong direction the wrong direction do you know the Bible told us is it 2 Timothy chap 1:9 the Bible told us that we're all called with a holy calling yes that's what the word said right is a holy calling not according to your Works do you know in the kingdom of God Amen there is no big you and small me do you know we all got the same Holy Spirit glory to God there is no big Holy Spirit oh brother Bley I've got 100 person and you just got 50 oh there is no measure there oh hallelujah amen we all have the same Holy Spirit the process to conversion is the same just as the overcoming part of overcoming is the same the result is the same you shall sit with me in my Throne glory to God so don't think you're going to get a gold and I'm going to get a brass and when you go there your brother is going to get a silver all of us going to get the same woo so I'm sorry hey we ought to love one another from here you believe that glory to God Revelation chapter 10 let me just wrap this up in a few minutes oh John said now he's still in the vision right so when you on understand Revelation in the vision God pull him up he saw things up there saw things on earth he saw things in heaven saw things on earth that was it all right now when you understand Revelation even though you see Revelation chapter 1 revelation 22 all things happen here does not happen concurrently Revelation chapter 10 you could have placed it in Revelation chapter 5 is that right Revelation 11 you could have dropped that right in Revelation chapter 7 amen glory to God so here John show him again this is powerful and I saw a mighty Angel any dispensation that God wishes to represent himself as a mighty Angel it means that that's a season you ought to wrestle is a wrestling season for you amen Jacob now this is not an anointing from a rock that Jacob Anointed The Rock because he felt an anointing he said this is the house of God when he was running away as a refu as a refugee right he was running away anointing hit him one night and he got a glory and he saw the ladder and when he woke up the next morning he said oh my God the anointing was so great this is the house of God he Anointed The Rock and called the place beel coming back he saw the anoint the anointing was still there he called The Place El betel but then coming back what met him in all experience Jacob Jacob experienced the presence of God he talked to God he made a bargain with God coming back the same person oh God but that night when God came as an angel Mighty Angel what did Jacob did wrestled he wrestled with Angel and he prevailed you know sometime you can be wrestling with yourself and not God that's dangerous you can be wrestling with yourself God you're trying to wrestle with you to get rid of this to get rid of that to get rid of that as long as Jacob was on that Journey he would never be converted until he wrestled with god oh my God wrestle with the angel of your Covenant Christ himself sometimes you ought to get down by yourself maybe ly in your stomach and cry talk to God I'm not even tell you how to but have you ever in a desperate stage brothers and sisters desperation
