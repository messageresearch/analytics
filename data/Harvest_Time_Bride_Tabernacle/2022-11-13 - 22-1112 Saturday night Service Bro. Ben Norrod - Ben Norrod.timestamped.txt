[36:00] before the Lord you know I I didn't get

[36:07] of it I wanted to hear all of it but you
[36:10] know we're so grateful to see younger
[36:13] men in the field
[36:15] it's a benefit it's what we need and I
[36:18] know some of you all are thinking but
[36:20] you're a young man you know you might be
[36:22] right about that but you got to remember
[36:23] this is 31 years for me and you know as
[36:27] far as being ministry-wise I feel like
[36:30] even though I'm probably just getting
[36:31] started to some people I feel like I'm
[36:33] heading toward retirement age of some
[36:34] sort but I'm glad to see younger
[36:37] brothers coming on because if there is
[36:38] another generation we need the young men
[36:40] to come on with the truth and we need to
[36:43] see them raise up in the ministry of the
[36:45] Lord and preach the gospel just exactly
[36:48] like brother Brahm the Bible delivered
[36:49] to us so I'm grateful for that and on

[55:59] praise His holy name
[56:04] if you have your Bibles this evening
[56:05] let's turn
[56:08] you're on helping us to the book of
[56:11] Ephesians
[56:12] Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22.
[56:16] and we certainly appreciate
[56:19] the spirit of the Lord
[56:21] of all the things we appreciate he's the
[56:23] greatest one of all of it
[56:26] amen Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22.
[56:31] amen we're certainly grateful to the
[56:33] Lord for
[56:35] the opportunity to be able to open up
[56:37] the Bible and
[56:38] read from the truth of this message and
[56:41] from the truth of the Bible without
[56:42] having to be confused by organization
[56:46] man's ways of things don't it feel good
[56:49] to just be able just to open your Bible
[56:51] and know
[56:52] just know know what you're reading know
[56:55] what you're talking about have that
[56:57] confidence how wonderful that is isn't
[56:59] that great
[57:00] I want to speak to the Lord helping us
[57:02] tonight upon the ministry of surrender
[57:05] under Ephesians 5 verse 22.
[57:10] now sisters this sounds like I'm getting
[57:12] ready to poke at you but this is only a
[57:13] spiritual type okay
[57:15] wives submit yourself unto your own
[57:18] husbands as unto the Lord
[57:21] for the husband is the head of the wife
[57:22] even as Christ is the head of the church
[57:26] he is the savior of the body
[57:29] therefore as the church is subject unto
[57:32] Christ
[57:33] so let the wives be to their own
[57:36] husbands and everything now if you'll
[57:38] notice the emphasis of that their own
[57:40] husbands in everything because first of
[57:44] all if I'm a married man and I have my
[57:48] own wife I don't expect my own wife to
[57:51] be taking orders and being bossed around
[57:52] by other men
[57:54] right neither does Christ accept you
[57:58] know just talking about Godly Ministry
[58:00] now might be the only way that he would
[58:01] do this but not putting the ministry
[58:03] part down now don't think I'm putting
[58:05] preachers down but only those preachers
[58:08] that are speaking on his behalf they're
[58:10] the only ones allowed to fool with them
[58:12] they're the only ones and the ones that
[58:14] come behind this desk brother Brahm said
[58:16] they've got to absolutely have the
[58:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost and they've
[58:19] got to know by call of God that they
[58:21] belong here
[58:23] any other voice any other man
[58:24] denomination Church affiliation Doctrine
[58:27] you name it anything contrary to that
[58:30] outside of that part right there
[58:33] that are not subject unto it whatsoever
[58:37] people are subject to all kinds of
[58:39] things
[58:41] heard subject to Christ they get subject
[58:44] unto a church they get subject under a
[58:46] group of preachers or a bunch of people
[58:47] again not put Ministry out now but if a
[58:50] person is really genuinely born again in
[58:53] the Holy Ghost and they're speaking by
[58:54] the Oracles of God really it ain't that
[58:56] man it's a Holy Ghost speaking through
[58:58] that person and that's the only ones
[59:00] allowed to to fool with her now listen
[59:02] to this in Jehovah John
[59:05] and it is her nature to surrender to a
[59:08] man it is the nature of the church to
[59:11] surrender to Christ
[59:13] to surrender to his will
[59:16] Just Surrender
[59:18] she has no thanking her own
[59:21] just
[59:23] somebody else's if he would have done
[59:26] that we would have never had to die but
[59:29] she listened to she listened to
[59:30] reasoning and to the reasonings but the
[59:33] pride of Christ takes the Hedge
[59:42] all right he says hallelujah now let me
[59:45] call your attention to one statement
[59:46] here he said that we don't have thoughts
[59:48] of our own now listen that doesn't mean
[59:50] we're robots and that doesn't mean that
[59:52] we're sitting around and letting just
[59:54] anybody and everybody tell us what to do
[59:56] and we're just yes sir no sir yes sir we
[59:59] have our own thinking but the difference
[1:00:01] is bride of Christ submit
[1:00:08] he's the words
[1:00:10] brings that way amen no matter what she
[1:00:13] believes no matter what kind of person
[1:00:15] she may be no matter uh opinionated we
[1:00:18] have a lot of opinionated people around
[1:00:20] the truth that's fine the nature of it
[1:00:23] is fine as far as that goes as long as
[1:00:25] that person is willing to see truth and
[1:00:27] say okay my idea doesn't matter anymore
[1:00:29] we believe the message I believe the
[1:00:32] truth the Bible amen let's pray together
[1:00:33] with the word can we while your head
[1:00:35] survived this evening if you'd just like
[1:00:37] to be remembered in prayer would you
[1:00:38] please slip your hand up God bless you
[1:00:40] my hands up too amen all over the
[1:00:42] building father what a privilege it is
[1:00:44] to come into your house Lord Jesus we
[1:00:47] surrender Our Lives to you may you come
[1:00:51] this evening time and speak to us Mighty
[1:00:54] God lord through the lips of thy servant
[1:00:57] I offer myself to you and Lord Jesus I
[1:01:00] offer these people their mind their
[1:01:02] hearts and their friends Lord and all
[1:01:04] that they may have brought with them
[1:01:05] tonight may all the baggage be set aside
[1:01:08] may all the weights be put aside and may
[1:01:10] not the Holy Spirit I pray coming here
[1:01:12] tonight take your word and speak to us
[1:01:14] expressingly Lord Jesus I pray that you
[1:01:17] will not only open up the windows of
[1:01:19] heaven and pour out us Revelation and
[1:01:21] understanding and blessings of healing
[1:01:23] and deliverance whatever the people may
[1:01:24] need but Lord God may you have the right
[1:01:28] of way in the service tonight may you
[1:01:30] get the preeminances of all things for
[1:01:32] we commit this myself this audience and
[1:01:34] every uplifted hand with that need there
[1:01:36] to the hands of the Lord Jesus we
[1:01:40] glorify your name tonight knowing Thou
[1:01:42] Art God the same yesterday today and
[1:01:44] forever we thank you this evening Lord
[1:01:46] and we appreciate you and Lord we sure
[1:01:49] stand in the need of prayer that you
[1:01:56] amen
[1:02:01] God bless you
[1:02:03] good and
[1:02:05] understand that you know we're living in
[1:02:08] a quite quite a serious time and I don't
[1:02:12] think it takes us we have the expression
[1:02:13] back home but don't take the genius to
[1:02:15] see that we're living in the last days
[1:02:17] that's for sure and uh one thing I
[1:02:20] believe is that the Bride of Jesus
[1:02:23] foreign
[1:02:26] able to fully completely understand the
[1:02:29] revelation of who she is not just the
[1:02:32] revelation of Christ not just the
[1:02:34] revelation of the Bible the revelation
[1:02:36] of the devil and whatever more
[1:02:37] revelation of a church or a pastor or an
[1:02:39] evangelist or some kind of teacher or
[1:02:41] something but I believe she is going to
[1:02:43] come to the revelation of who she is
[1:02:45] because don't forget that the great
[1:02:47] mystery of God is not just the mystery
[1:02:50] of Jesus Christ but it's also the
[1:02:52] mystery of you and there is a part given
[1:02:55] to God that we surrender ourselves to
[1:02:58] God and that is placed in Us by the New
[1:03:01] Birth by the Holy Spirit the potential
[1:03:04] or the ability to be able to completely
[1:03:06] and totally surrender and only God can
[1:03:10] put that in the human heart in the first
[1:03:12] place now we know what the Bible tells
[1:03:14] us that in the last days people will be
[1:03:16] lovers of them on their own selves and
[1:03:18] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:03:21] God and you know uh pleasure in itself
[1:03:24] is not a bad thing I enjoy playing the
[1:03:25] piano and singing matter of fact you
[1:03:28] know sometimes when we get together with
[1:03:29] other musicians I like to show off a
[1:03:31] little bit when I get with them I I love
[1:03:33] it I love playing and singing and the
[1:03:35] Lord but let me do that instead of this
[1:03:37] preaching thing I choose that any day of
[1:03:38] the week I love it but I would never
[1:03:40] ever because of how much I love music
[1:03:42] ever put that above my love for the word
[1:03:45] or my love for Jesus Christ you might
[1:03:47] like to paint you might like to write
[1:03:49] poems you might like to do certain
[1:03:51] mechanical things or work on a farm or
[1:03:53] you might have some kind of love like
[1:03:55] that pleasure within itself is not bad
[1:03:57] but it's whenever the people take that
[1:03:59] and put that above the holy spirit so
[1:04:01] the people of the last day then that's
[1:04:03] been prophesied to have this type of
[1:04:06] anointing on them the last days of
[1:04:08] perilous times and incontinent and fears
[1:04:10] and things of that nature these are
[1:04:12] people that actually value their own
[1:04:15] selves above the things of God and you
[1:04:18] see to be a genuine Christian the one
[1:04:20] thing that we learn is that Christianity
[1:04:23] comes as a self-sacrificial life as
[1:04:27] Lambs of God or sheep of God we have
[1:04:29] been designed and created by God in a
[1:04:32] manner in which we can surrender our
[1:04:34] will surrender our desires and all of
[1:04:37] those things to the Lord now I know you
[1:04:38] know that and I'm just kind of
[1:04:39] rehearsing a moment things that you
[1:04:41] already know but the one aspect about
[1:04:43] surrender to God that I think people
[1:04:46] Miss sometimes brother Jim is the idea
[1:04:48] that the Lord Jesus Jesus in this
[1:04:50] surrender is not asking us to become a
[1:04:53] bunch of robotic people around this
[1:04:55] message I'm going to say something and I
[1:04:57] hope you take this right and I'm going
[1:04:59] to try to say it right and I hope that
[1:05:01] when I express this you don't think that
[1:05:03] I'm against Holiness or the things of
[1:05:05] God but like you look around our message
[1:05:07] and you see our girls and many of our
[1:05:09] girls when you look at them they've all
[1:05:11] got the same look to them same type of
[1:05:13] hairstyle same type of dresses same flat
[1:05:15] shoes or something like that now listen
[1:05:17] I'm not against Holiness or dressing
[1:05:20] holy before the Lord but if we're not
[1:05:22] careful we become a people that have
[1:05:25] manufactured Holiness in Christianity
[1:05:28] rather than having our individual Walk
[1:05:30] With Jesus Christ I I Marvel sometimes
[1:05:33] when I hear preachers telling me about
[1:05:35] girls curling their hair and how awful
[1:05:37] that is and and you know a woman wearing
[1:05:39] a pen on her on her on her sleeve or
[1:05:41] something like that and you see what
[1:05:43] we've done is we've tried to manufacture
[1:05:46] we've tried to reproduce Holiness based
[1:05:49] on what we like what we don't like but
[1:05:52] Holiness is not what you do it's what
[1:05:55] God does for you from the inside out
[1:05:58] that's why we have so much foolishness
[1:06:00] that runs around the rings to this
[1:06:02] message is because brother cars frankly
[1:06:04] man takes his own idea his own likes his
[1:06:07] own dislikes and pushes that on people
[1:06:09] as the doctrine of the Lord and then we
[1:06:12] wonder why our young people sit around
[1:06:13] the message confused and all of a sudden
[1:06:16] they hear a voice of clarity on the
[1:06:18] internet and that makes much more sense
[1:06:19] to them than what they hear in church
[1:06:21] it's our fault if they run out the doors
[1:06:24] it's our fault if people walk off from
[1:06:26] this truth because we are responsible to
[1:06:29] keep the smut off this message we are
[1:06:32] responsible to keep it clear to keep the
[1:06:35] message right and if there's any fault
[1:06:37] on people walking out the doors it's
[1:06:39] upon us because somewhere we have not
[1:06:41] done the thing that we should do to keep
[1:06:44] the standard of the Lord and to keep the
[1:06:46] message right before the people amen I
[1:06:48] know you ain't gonna like that you'll
[1:06:49] blame it on Bergens and the Collins boy
[1:06:51] and all the rest of that but listen we
[1:06:53] were in the hen house way before amen
[1:06:56] they did amen we were in we were the
[1:06:58] ones stealing the eggs way before the
[1:06:59] fox got in there amen come on somebody
[1:07:02] preached to me a little bit amen and we
[1:07:04] need to realize that any kind of
[1:07:07] disintegration of Faith or truth it
[1:07:09] always comes from the inside rather than
[1:07:12] the outside amen if we're walking where
[1:07:14] we should walk talking where we should
[1:07:16] talk and living like we should live
[1:07:18] surrender like we're surrendered amen my
[1:07:21] Bible tells me I am more than an
[1:07:24] overcomer if I am living by that word if
[1:07:27] I am surrendered to Jesus Christ there
[1:07:30] is nothing that can come against a child
[1:07:32] of God but what we don't have the answer
[1:07:34] for is amen stay with me a little while
[1:07:37] now you realize that the spirit of God
[1:07:39] is calling us to a total complete life
[1:07:43] of surrender
[1:07:44] I hope you understand that I hope you
[1:07:47] realize that when we talk about things
[1:07:49] like third pool manifestations of the
[1:07:52] sons of God we're talking about the
[1:07:53] return of the son of man Ministry the
[1:07:55] revealing of the son of man all of that
[1:07:59] is pointing to one attribute of a child
[1:08:01] to God and that's learning to surrender
[1:08:03] and yield ourselves to the mind and the
[1:08:06] will of God the one thing that we must
[1:08:09] learn to do before we get out of here
[1:08:10] that is to Humble ourselves to the point
[1:08:13] to where that even if I have a certain
[1:08:15] thought listen as a preacher I don't
[1:08:18] mind telling you it doesn't embarrass me
[1:08:19] to say this as a preacher I've been
[1:08:21] reading things in the Bible and shake my
[1:08:23] head and go that couldn't be right I've
[1:08:25] heard brother Brown say things and say
[1:08:27] he's crazy where does he get ideas like
[1:08:30] that human is speaking I've had my
[1:08:32] queries I've had my questions I've had
[1:08:35] my ponderings and my wonderings but the
[1:08:37] difference between someone like me and
[1:08:39] maybe some of the others is when I've
[1:08:41] got a question I am willing to let the
[1:08:44] word correct like me on whatever I
[1:08:46] believe
[1:08:47] amen somebody help me a little while I'm
[1:08:49] willing to let the Holy Spirit tell me
[1:08:51] this is his word this is what you're
[1:08:54] reading many times I'll be reading it
[1:08:56] wrong
[1:08:57] write words but wrong understanding have
[1:09:00] you ever been there you're reading the
[1:09:02] exact scripture you need to read but
[1:09:04] you're not reading it in the right eyes
[1:09:05] of the Holy Spirit and if you're humble
[1:09:07] and you're patient you wait on the Lord
[1:09:09] amen he can reveal that thing and
[1:09:11] straighten it out and spiritual standing
[1:09:12] right here and sitting tonight amen the
[1:09:14] same exact thing you hear Brother Adam
[1:09:15] say when he comes in hard doctrines now
[1:09:17] you just stop your tape right there get
[1:09:19] your Bible open and say sit before the
[1:09:21] Holy Spirit and let God reveal to you
[1:09:23] what I'm saying amen you know it's
[1:09:25] amazing even those people back in those
[1:09:27] days when brother Brown was alive they
[1:09:29] were pushing play and half of them
[1:09:31] didn't know how to obey
[1:09:33] right exactly Ryan amen robane comes by
[1:09:37] the gift of God in your life and that is
[1:09:39] a gift of surrender amen it is a
[1:09:42] Ministry that is given to the wife and
[1:09:45] her Administration is to surrender to
[1:09:47] God Amen we talk about gifts we talk
[1:09:50] about supernatural we talk about powers
[1:09:52] of God Amen I had a conversation some
[1:09:55] years ago with a fella that had come to
[1:09:57] the meeting here amen and he was telling
[1:09:59] me on on Facebook how that you know we
[1:10:02] need to come to the place to where the
[1:10:03] bride has great Supernatural powers to
[1:10:06] speak in tongues and prophesy and raise
[1:10:08] the dead I love all of that if somebody
[1:10:10] fell dead tonight I would love nothing
[1:10:12] more than to see the Holy Ghost anoint
[1:10:14] somebody to lay their hands on them and
[1:10:16] raise them up from the dead amen but I
[1:10:19] am not going to put the cart before the
[1:10:21] horse none of that can take place until
[1:10:24] I learn how to surrender everything that
[1:10:27] I am my mind my thoughts my personality
[1:10:30] my likes my dislikes my wants all of
[1:10:34] that must be surrendered to the Lord in
[1:10:36] order for great things to happen like
[1:10:38] that
[1:10:39] let me tell you why you struggle with
[1:10:41] preachers in the Pulpit because some of
[1:10:42] them ain't surrendered and when they
[1:10:44] preach to you you can feel it you can
[1:10:46] tell it you can't Bluff human beings if
[1:10:48] a man don't believe what he's talking
[1:10:49] about or he's trying to put over
[1:10:51] something on you amen you're smart
[1:10:53] enough to sit and appeal and feel it you
[1:10:55] know it but listen how beautiful is it
[1:10:57] when a man can surrender and you can
[1:11:00] surrender watch Holy Ghost just sweep
[1:11:02] through that congregation
[1:11:03] [Music]
[1:11:04] hallelujah amen and answer the needs of
[1:11:07] the people sitting in the pews it all
[1:11:10] comes to surrender amen I don't care how
[1:11:12] Talent a person is or how talented they
[1:11:14] might have all the gifts in the world to
[1:11:16] play and sing and whatever more but you
[1:11:18] take that person and let them just
[1:11:20] perform that gift rather than surrender
[1:11:22] it there's a difference in the music you
[1:11:23] hear
[1:11:25] they might hit some of the prettiest
[1:11:26] notes you've ever heard they might sing
[1:11:28] the best things you've ever heard
[1:11:29] brother Jim you know what I'm talking
[1:11:30] about amen but if you yields your hands
[1:11:33] and your mind your voice and what more
[1:11:35] to the Holy Ghost amen it's a different
[1:11:37] ring altogether amen why because it's
[1:11:40] not the gift amen you're not feeding off
[1:11:42] that gift the gift is to get yourself
[1:11:45] out of the way so the Holy Ghost can
[1:11:47] anoint it and Bless the people
[1:11:49] that's where healing comes from amen
[1:11:52] healing comes through things like music
[1:11:54] and singing and all of this but only if
[1:11:57] it's yielded to the Holy Ghost
[1:11:59] I've heard some of the best singers in
[1:12:01] the country sing with some played music
[1:12:03] for some of them and there's some of
[1:12:04] them that can only just be good singers
[1:12:07] they're not tools of ministry
[1:12:09] they're not tools of blessings they're
[1:12:11] not tools of ministering and giving to
[1:12:14] the people Divine Healing amen through
[1:12:16] the gifts and things that God given
[1:12:18] they're just good singers that's all
[1:12:19] they are amen or good preachers for that
[1:12:22] matter or whatever they might be amen
[1:12:24] what we need in the message of the hour
[1:12:26] is a return to good old-fashioned
[1:12:28] surrender to the Lord
[1:12:31] exactly right if we could get the
[1:12:32] preachers and all of us straightened out
[1:12:34] then we work on the people a little
[1:12:35] while
[1:12:36] right now listen to this amen let's turn
[1:12:38] to First Peter chapter 5 verse 5. now is
[1:12:42] you're working through this with me a
[1:12:43] little bit I want to take several verses
[1:12:45] here and uh we want to try by the help
[1:12:48] of the Lord our best to um uh to uh
[1:12:52] bring in a couple of things just from
[1:12:53] the Bible and and I got several places
[1:12:55] there if you'd like to write them down
[1:12:57] look at them later that's fine and uh if
[1:13:00] you would happen to miss something or
[1:13:01] you'd like some help in it let me know
[1:13:03] and I'll certainly share with you where
[1:13:04] I'm at Amen in the word of God and uh
[1:13:07] somebody uh please remind me there's a
[1:13:10] pastor in North Carolina him and his
[1:13:12] family are fighting the flu and we want
[1:13:14] to have prayer form at the end of the
[1:13:15] service when the we come to the end and
[1:13:17] the anointing was hearing things and uh
[1:13:19] somebody please remind me if you see me
[1:13:21] walk all this platform I don't pray but
[1:13:23] please remind me amen we want to just
[1:13:25] remember all of the sick and Afflicted
[1:13:26] and hold them before the Lord amen so
[1:13:29] first Peter 5 verse 5. now listen the
[1:13:32] Bible said likewise you younger submit
[1:13:35] yourselves unto the Elder yay oh you
[1:13:39] know you can stop right there and
[1:13:41] there's a lot of the older ones and I'm
[1:13:43] not trying to hit at you tonight but a
[1:13:45] lot of them say yeah that's right you
[1:13:46] young people you need to surrender to us
[1:13:49] older people well older people just keep
[1:13:52] reading he said and all of you be
[1:13:55] subject one to another
[1:13:57] so it ain't just because they're old or
[1:13:59] because they've got a lot of experience
[1:14:00] or some teenage kid comes along and
[1:14:02] thinks they own the world and and and
[1:14:05] some kind of disrespectful thing like
[1:14:07] you know you young person need to pay
[1:14:10] attention to the older ones the older
[1:14:11] ones need to pay attention a little bit
[1:14:12] too
[1:14:14] listen I'm in a time of life where
[1:14:16] there's a whole generation underneath me
[1:14:18] that I don't understand them
[1:14:20] I don't know what they're facing I don't
[1:14:22] know how they're speaking I don't
[1:14:23] understand their language I got three
[1:14:25] girls in my house two of them are
[1:14:27] teenagers and sometimes I'm wondering if
[1:14:29] I need to pray for interpretation of
[1:14:31] tongues
[1:14:34] they talk with a language all of their
[1:14:36] own sometimes even little jokes and
[1:14:38] things they'll say I wonder what in the
[1:14:40] world are these kids saying but I was
[1:14:42] like that too when I was a teenager I
[1:14:44] had my own language and US older ones
[1:14:47] need to listen to that younger
[1:14:49] generation so we know how to be a
[1:14:51] blessing to them a lot of times we throw
[1:14:53] them off and cast them aside oh just a
[1:14:56] bunch of kids but the Bible said don't
[1:14:58] despise their youth
[1:14:59] amen they've got energy to serve the
[1:15:01] Lord they've got a feeling to serve the
[1:15:03] Lord they're not in that hardened place
[1:15:05] like a lot of us are with scars and
[1:15:07] battle scars and wounds and the Lord can
[1:15:09] do great things with them and I believe
[1:15:12] this is one reason why some of this
[1:15:14] younger generation is getting fed up
[1:15:15] with the message because they got a
[1:15:17] bunch of dictators sitting in the pews
[1:15:19] as they got some gray heads and some
[1:15:20] experience that think they ought to make
[1:15:22] everyone subject to them because they're
[1:15:24] older well who are you going to be
[1:15:26] subject to
[1:15:28] somebody got to be the boss around here
[1:15:31] and it ain't me and ain't no other
[1:15:32] preacher it's Jesus
[1:15:34] we've got to learn to be subject one to
[1:15:36] another
[1:15:39] anybody ever want to see a congregation
[1:15:41] from shout to pound to under two seconds
[1:15:43] get a picture right now
[1:15:45] oh I know I know that pinches you that
[1:15:47] that's disrespectful it's the truth and
[1:15:50] if we're paying attention to where we're
[1:15:52] at you need to understand that in order
[1:15:55] for the church to rise up and take her
[1:15:58] position we must learn to be subject one
[1:16:00] to another
[1:16:01] amen Tate brother here in his small
[1:16:03] family these good-looking boys sitting
[1:16:05] around here amen if he is not sensitive
[1:16:07] to the needs of these kids he'll lose
[1:16:09] them
[1:16:10] they'll get bitter against him and that
[1:16:12] you know Dad just don't get me and Dad
[1:16:14] don't understand that we're too quick
[1:16:16] sometimes to push people out because
[1:16:18] they don't dance our tune amen we have
[1:16:21] no Grace for people we see them fall
[1:16:23] into things and go into air and we
[1:16:25] become immediately critical but listen
[1:16:28] just because we've arrived at a station
[1:16:31] of life to where we're older and we
[1:16:33] don't have to listen or put up with it
[1:16:35] anymore that doesn't mean that we
[1:16:37] shouldn't be subject to those in the
[1:16:39] church body come on somebody preached to
[1:16:41] me that we should learn to be subject
[1:16:43] and know their need and feel the burden
[1:16:46] for them the same as everybody else
[1:16:49] amen even old people odd times and when
[1:16:52] I say old people now I'm talking the
[1:16:53] elderly the really uh 80s and uh things
[1:16:56] like that okay coming up into the time
[1:16:58] of life they're past that three score
[1:17:00] and ten that God give them and the Bible
[1:17:02] said if they're a widow indeed if
[1:17:04] they've washed feet if they've
[1:17:05] entertained Saints and things like that
[1:17:07] to consider them a widow and to bless
[1:17:09] them and be with them but a lot of times
[1:17:11] older people feel like I've come to the
[1:17:13] spot I can't do nothing for the Lord
[1:17:15] anymore I'm too old don't you never
[1:17:17] believe that if there is wind in your
[1:17:20] lungs God's give you a purpose amen
[1:17:22] right here tonight to be able to take
[1:17:24] what God's give you and submit it to
[1:17:27] somebody else
[1:17:28] amen the prophet of God Amen standing in
[1:17:31] front of a platform of thousands of
[1:17:33] people just a man in his 30s and 40s
[1:17:35] like me would dare stand and tell people
[1:17:37] with gray heads and everything else
[1:17:39] about his life story and dare say I want
[1:17:42] you to use my experiences as a stepping
[1:17:45] stone for what not to do and how to do
[1:17:47] better
[1:17:48] imagine that the gall the nerve the
[1:17:51] unmitigated boldness what was
[1:17:53] brethrenham trying to do exactly what
[1:17:55] the Bible said surrender himself one to
[1:17:57] another
[1:17:58] whatever experience he had it was his
[1:18:01] experiences and maybe it will help
[1:18:03] somebody I don't know about you but any
[1:18:05] man or woman that listens to the life
[1:18:07] story if you don't aren't in tears about
[1:18:09] three quarters of the way through it you
[1:18:11] are the hardest person that ever
[1:18:13] amen it does something to you it it
[1:18:16] affects you in a way to hear how this
[1:18:18] man missed the will of the Lord and how
[1:18:20] God Amen took his wife and his baby from
[1:18:22] him amen what a what a heartbreaking
[1:18:25] thing but you know what it does for me
[1:18:27] Amen to hear that man talk about him
[1:18:29] missing God Amen that I can be aware
[1:18:31] that if the Lord speaks to me I don't
[1:18:33] get off the hook either
[1:18:35] I can adjust myself to follow God's mind
[1:18:38] and the will of the Lord
[1:18:40] amen we should share our testimony don't
[1:18:43] forget we overcome by the blood of the
[1:18:46] lamb and our testimony
[1:18:49] I tell folks don't run around telling
[1:18:51] the young people all the time how much
[1:18:53] you drink and how much you run and how
[1:18:55] mean you was tell them how God saved him
[1:18:58] tell them how low down you was I might
[1:19:00] just just put it in a very simple way
[1:19:01] but how God reached to the lowest and
[1:19:04] pulled you out of there and gave you the
[1:19:05] Holy Ghost
[1:19:07] what I'm trying to say is no matter what
[1:19:09] you tell them give them hope
[1:19:11] give them hope that there is an answer
[1:19:13] amen because we're living in a
[1:19:15] generation of people that are having a
[1:19:17] hard time finding a place they fit in
[1:19:19] they're having a hard time finding a
[1:19:21] place that they can feel a part of a
[1:19:23] message of the hour and we stand up here
[1:19:26] as preachers and we quote from a man
[1:19:27] that preached in the 50s and the 60s to
[1:19:30] people living in 2022.
[1:19:32] and then we expect them to fit in with
[1:19:34] the program that's why they've got to
[1:19:36] find the mind of God and the only way
[1:19:39] they'll do that is if we submit
[1:19:40] ourselves one to another
[1:19:42] lift God up out of history and make him
[1:19:45] real right here tonight and see what a
[1:19:47] difference it makes in all of us amen I
[1:19:50] don't know where that come from but
[1:19:51] there it is amen good batter up there it
[1:19:55] is right now listen to this in First
[1:19:57] Peter 5 picking up verse six now he told
[1:20:00] us let's finish five actually he clothed
[1:20:02] be clothed with humility for God
[1:20:04] resisteth the proud
[1:20:07] and gives grace to the humble can you
[1:20:09] say Amen to them
[1:20:11] amen humble yourselves therefore under
[1:20:14] the mighty hand of God that he may exalt
[1:20:18] you in due time
[1:20:19] now to be exalted by the Lord doesn't
[1:20:23] necessarily mean that God's going to put
[1:20:25] a spotlight on you and all of a sudden
[1:20:27] he's just going to raise you up to be
[1:20:29] some big guy or a big girl among the
[1:20:31] people but what he means by exalt here
[1:20:33] is in other words that God will help you
[1:20:36] raise to your position in Jesus Christ
[1:20:38] to rise up to meet the challenge that
[1:20:41] God's called you for
[1:20:43] praise the Lord I want that don't you I
[1:20:46] want God to help me raise to meet the
[1:20:49] challenge that's been placed before me
[1:20:51] but if I'm proud if I've got an arrogant
[1:20:54] Spirit if I've got the type of spirit on
[1:20:57] me like a narcissist that always wants
[1:20:59] everything their way and it's all about
[1:21:00] them if I've got that kind of spirit on
[1:21:03] me the spirit of Christ I have not
[1:21:05] because no one was such a proud arrogant
[1:21:08] attitude like that amen is ever going to
[1:21:10] tell me that the Holy Ghost is dwelling
[1:21:12] inside that heart the first thing God
[1:21:14] does when he gives you the baptism the
[1:21:16] Holy Ghost is he gives you humility
[1:21:18] amen especially if you've been a sinner
[1:21:20] A ranked Center and the amazing grace of
[1:21:23] God Saves you
[1:21:24] to come out of that and to come into the
[1:21:26] Glorious Grace of his gospel amen what
[1:21:29] it must do for a heart amen that's been
[1:21:31] out in the world and been through hell
[1:21:33] on this Earth and all of a sudden God
[1:21:34] saved them it should change the way we
[1:21:36] even feel about ourselves
[1:21:39] but the real story comes back to this
[1:21:42] scripture here humble yourself under the
[1:21:44] mighty hand of God
[1:21:46] that's a hard thing to do now when I say
[1:21:49] this this is not meant to be an
[1:21:51] unchristianizing thing but I'm saying
[1:21:53] this because we must be responsible for
[1:21:55] all of our movement amen our corner of
[1:21:58] the world's our corner of the world but
[1:21:59] remember we represent something to
[1:22:01] people and the people of God must be the
[1:22:04] most surrendered group on the face of
[1:22:06] the planet
[1:22:07] amen and you know it's sad in other ways
[1:22:09] when you see people in their own
[1:22:10] religions way more committed to what
[1:22:12] they believe than we are to what we
[1:22:14] believe I'm challenging you tonight I
[1:22:16] hope you're able to raise to the
[1:22:17] challenge but we should be a living
[1:22:19] example of what God has projected
[1:22:22] through that Prophet about that what the
[1:22:25] Christians should be what our life
[1:22:26] should look like and that we should be
[1:22:28] Billboards for Jesus Christ and the only
[1:22:30] way you can project that Hallelujah is
[1:22:33] through the ministry of surrender
[1:22:35] amen you may not have any other Ministry
[1:22:37] in your life but this ministry is what
[1:22:40] God gave to a wife
[1:22:41] the ministry to surrender herself yield
[1:22:45] herself to the things of God you say
[1:22:47] well brother Ben I am yes but that's
[1:22:49] just the one time you're thinking of
[1:22:51] you're thinking of maybe just a an
[1:22:52] everyday well I Just Surrender every day
[1:22:54] but it goes even deeper than that amen
[1:22:57] you got to go even deeper than just an
[1:22:59] everyday surrender amen you've got to
[1:23:01] come to the place to where you don't
[1:23:03] even have to try to surrender or
[1:23:05] continue to surrender you got to go
[1:23:07] deeper than that it's just an automatic
[1:23:09] I am surrendered amen trying to
[1:23:12] accomplish it's one thing but being
[1:23:13] surrendered is an entirely different
[1:23:15] thing altogether folks how do you think
[1:23:17] brother Brown was able to accomplish
[1:23:19] what he did speak squirrels and talk to
[1:23:21] storms and everything else because he
[1:23:23] was a surrendered man to the Lord
[1:23:27] hallelujah amen think about him when he
[1:23:30] spoke to that storm in Colorado walking
[1:23:31] down through there and the Holy Ghost
[1:23:33] said would you like to walk with me
[1:23:36] amen imagine what that must have been
[1:23:38] like for brother Branham knowing that
[1:23:40] he'd just come out of that death trap up
[1:23:42] there amen and he was stand up here in
[1:23:44] that mountain the Holy Ghost said go
[1:23:45] back up into that thing
[1:23:47] now I don't know about you but if I'm
[1:23:50] standing there looking at that storm
[1:23:51] like that my first impression is not
[1:23:54] going to be listen to that my first
[1:23:55] impression will be I've lost it I better
[1:23:57] get out of here
[1:23:59] but the prophet of God said he said I
[1:24:01] went around that tree and he said pulled
[1:24:03] my hat off and I heard I am the creator
[1:24:04] of the heavens and the Earth he said
[1:24:06] I've heard that voice my whole life amen
[1:24:09] in other words he was so surrendered to
[1:24:11] God that even if it would have meant
[1:24:13] death he was willing to go do what God
[1:24:15] wanted him to do
[1:24:17] now you see people with quote books in
[1:24:19] their arm and in the old days running
[1:24:20] around you know now they've got tablets
[1:24:22] and the message around and they'll throw
[1:24:24] quotes around left and right amen we've
[1:24:26] got a lot of good preachers we've got a
[1:24:27] lot of big churches a lot of good
[1:24:28] movement but we don't have enough
[1:24:30] surrender
[1:24:32] amen you say well we do do we is there
[1:24:34] if we got enough surrender tell me why
[1:24:36] people are getting discouraged and not
[1:24:38] coming to church all the time and why
[1:24:40] they can't sit under and submit
[1:24:41] themselves to Godly pastors tell me why
[1:24:44] people walk around in mental depressions
[1:24:46] and oppressions all the day long and why
[1:24:48] they're taking one nerve pill after
[1:24:50] another come on somebody talk to me why
[1:24:52] we've got the word but we don't have
[1:24:54] enough surrender to it that's what God
[1:24:56] needs out of us
[1:24:58] somebody's going to help me preach
[1:25:00] tonight
[1:25:01] amen I'm coming on with it anyways or
[1:25:04] not amen that's right we need it need
[1:25:06] that more than we need anything else
[1:25:09] a Ministry of surrender humble yourself
[1:25:12] so in other words if you're proud God
[1:25:14] resists you
[1:25:15] be a preacher be whoever it is if you're
[1:25:18] proud God will resist you I don't want
[1:25:20] him resisting me I don't want him to be
[1:25:23] resistant to my nature or my spirit or
[1:25:25] my soul whatever part of me might I want
[1:25:28] God to see that he can use me folks do
[1:25:30] you understand this is one reason why
[1:25:32] people have a hard time worshiping like
[1:25:34] they should in church
[1:25:35] they're willing to give their soul to
[1:25:37] God to be saved they're willing to give
[1:25:39] their human spirit and things for God to
[1:25:41] clean up their memory and give them good
[1:25:43] dreams and let them sleep well but then
[1:25:45] they come to the house of God and
[1:25:47] they've got rain over their hands and
[1:25:48] their eyes and their mouth and then
[1:25:50] preachers have to holler come on
[1:25:51] somebody come on somebody come on
[1:25:53] somebody you know why we do that because
[1:25:55] they're not really surrendering what we
[1:25:57] are so we can worship like we should
[1:26:00] amen and amen it's exactly right now you
[1:26:04] can say oh well but in the house of the
[1:26:06] Lord I I'm a quiet natured person honey
[1:26:08] let the Holy Ghost get a hold of you one
[1:26:10] time he'll run all that foolishness out
[1:26:12] of you
[1:26:13] there's no such thing as a quiet person
[1:26:17] even yourselves right now are vibrating
[1:26:20] higher than what you could ever measure
[1:26:22] it
[1:26:23] amen the Bible said your thoughts in
[1:26:24] heaven ring louder than your mouth does
[1:26:26] here on the earth no such thing as a
[1:26:28] quiet person it's an excuse we make
[1:26:30] because we don't want to give him our
[1:26:32] hands we don't want to give him our
[1:26:34] mouth to worship God why that's too
[1:26:37] Pentecostal oh there's no I'll tell you
[1:26:39] one thing it might be that but the Bible
[1:26:41] said amen the joy of the Lord is my
[1:26:45] strength
[1:26:48] and maybe if we had a little bit more of
[1:26:50] that in the house of God maybe we'd
[1:26:52] leave out them doors feeling like we've
[1:26:53] been to church for a change
[1:26:56] right amen instead of feeling like we've
[1:26:59] been sitting in a lecture in this hour
[1:27:00] all night
[1:27:03] words Amen in case you forgot it
[1:27:06] amen I remembered if you need help but
[1:27:09] just don't forget it now right you say
[1:27:12] but that's that's hard preaching yes but
[1:27:13] it's where we're living at
[1:27:16] I mean I I know people are resistant to
[1:27:18] things they say well I hear what all the
[1:27:21] man says before I say Amen you don't
[1:27:23] have the Holy Ghost
[1:27:24] you mean the Holy Ghost can't tell you
[1:27:26] if that guy's honored or ain't
[1:27:29] the problem is we weigh too much out
[1:27:31] because what we're really saying I want
[1:27:33] that man to move me God ain't here to
[1:27:35] let me or nobody else move you you're
[1:27:38] the one that's a priest you're the one
[1:27:40] that's under obligation to offer your
[1:27:42] spiritual sacrifices to Christ
[1:27:46] amen I'm telling you right there's not
[1:27:48] enough good good preaching or whatever
[1:27:49] in the world to move some people because
[1:27:51] they're stubborn
[1:27:53] and they're stubborn and to be stubborn
[1:27:55] is to be a witch
[1:27:58] whoo
[1:28:00] praise the Lord brother man somebody saw
[1:28:03] the United States church because they
[1:28:04] were led by a witch why Rebellion is
[1:28:07] what leads a lot of these churches
[1:28:09] you watch them around the ranks of this
[1:28:11] message what young people and older
[1:28:13] people the man goes preaching right down
[1:28:15] their alley they'll tighten up on him
[1:28:17] they'll hold her amen's back
[1:28:20] let him say what they want him to say
[1:28:21] and let him get out there and preach
[1:28:23] what they like and boy they'll tear the
[1:28:24] house down but you rub them the wrong
[1:28:26] way you see a green-eyed monster
[1:28:28] don't you tell me that you're
[1:28:30] surrendered to God you're not
[1:28:32] when the Holy Ghost comes down your eye
[1:28:34] away and skins your heart that's when
[1:28:37] the bride should be Holland amen even
[1:28:38] louder amen Lord I believe it's the
[1:28:41] truth
[1:28:43] the man or woman is surrendered ain't no
[1:28:45] such thing as hard preaching
[1:28:48] well he's a hard preacher he looks he
[1:28:51] said that that's because you surrendered
[1:28:54] amen now listen to this a message for
[1:28:58] the meanest man
[1:29:00] that could come to me
[1:29:04] to this day but a bride veils her face
[1:29:07] why the man is her head and then she has
[1:29:11] no uh
[1:29:15] reason the church
[1:29:17] is not ahead and that's Christ
[1:29:20] tells us to be clothed
[1:29:23] when he says that we are to be veiled
[1:29:25] how are we supposed to be veiled in
[1:29:27] humility
[1:29:29] the humility of the Bride of Jesus
[1:29:31] Christ The Veil that she wears over
[1:29:33] herself the veil of humility is a sign
[1:29:36] that he's the boss
[1:29:40] he's in charge
[1:29:43] you want to know who runs this house my
[1:29:45] husband runs his house
[1:29:47] she's veiled with humility to show that
[1:29:50] you say but brother Ben what's that got
[1:29:52] to do with anything all right listen
[1:29:53] when the tear and the wheat come to
[1:29:55] their full manifestation you you farmers
[1:29:58] in here know what I'm talking about
[1:29:59] you ever watch a wheat when it comes
[1:30:02] closer to maturity if that tear is
[1:30:04] growing right up with that wheat the the
[1:30:06] wheat will bow its head down like this
[1:30:08] and that Terror will stay straight up in
[1:30:10] the air that Pride that lives exists in
[1:30:13] that person that little inferiority
[1:30:15] complex that they think they're a big
[1:30:17] shot when they're not
[1:30:19] right that's something that lives inside
[1:30:21] that person amen don't you know where
[1:30:23] that comes from it comes from the Devil
[1:30:26] Satan was the first one to exalt himself
[1:30:28] lift himself up put himself up in Pride
[1:30:31] Chimes have to be some great something
[1:30:35] amen but Jesus Christ ever moves in the
[1:30:37] human heart it makes us humble down
[1:30:41] you know and I'll show you how simple
[1:30:42] this is sometimes you know you take a
[1:30:44] wife
[1:30:45] you know and husbands have a hard time
[1:30:47] submitting to their wives that they're
[1:30:49] command men you know the boss of the
[1:30:51] home
[1:30:52] you know and they don't want to go
[1:30:54] shopping or they don't want to let her
[1:30:55] have a say or they won't let her have an
[1:30:57] opinion and they don't like something
[1:30:59] glory to God I'm the man of the house
[1:31:01] you might be the man of the house do you
[1:31:03] have a responsibility to remain humble
[1:31:08] sometimes men you just need to shut this
[1:31:11] and open him God give you two of these
[1:31:13] and one of these
[1:31:15] I figured the sisters would be shouting
[1:31:17] about right now but
[1:31:19] come on
[1:31:21] sometimes you just need to listen up
[1:31:23] listen up and shut up and let them have
[1:31:25] a say let them have an opinion but oh
[1:31:28] we're the men of the house that is the
[1:31:31] devil's way of dominating a home any
[1:31:34] woman that lives by the grace of God and
[1:31:36] that man treats her right he doesn't
[1:31:38] have to force her to surrender she wants
[1:31:41] to
[1:31:42] I feel the same about Jesus I don't want
[1:31:44] to come into the house of God but the
[1:31:46] host I don't want him to have to force
[1:31:48] me or scare me or intimidate me or hang
[1:31:51] me over hell or you better get right now
[1:31:54] Ben or I'm going to send you to the
[1:31:55] reach of the law no he loves me in such
[1:31:58] a way that I just want to serve it with
[1:32:01] all of my heart give him everything I
[1:32:04] God's what I want to do
[1:32:06] you don't have to force us he just loves
[1:32:09] us right into that situation
[1:32:11] now I don't say sometimes that you don't
[1:32:13] have to take a stand in your home and
[1:32:15] that you don't have to have a principle
[1:32:16] I know better than that but let's face
[1:32:18] facts we have allowed ourselves to get
[1:32:21] sucked in to a society of men in the
[1:32:24] message that are nothing less than a
[1:32:26] bunch of unconverted dictators
[1:32:30] and these women in this message they sit
[1:32:32] and endure a bunch of preaching about
[1:32:34] their hair and her dress and their
[1:32:35] thoughts and their this and that and
[1:32:37] these preachers let these rotten men sit
[1:32:39] in these people don't say a word about
[1:32:40] them
[1:32:41] before there was ever a bad woman there
[1:32:43] has to be a bad some man somewhere
[1:32:46] oh you say that ain't true go back in
[1:32:48] the Garden of Eden who got to Eve first
[1:32:50] man or woman
[1:32:52] go back to questions and answers brother
[1:32:54] man said the serpent was a man
[1:32:56] that man perverted a woman's life
[1:32:59] amen Real Son of God doesn't make a
[1:33:02] doormat out of her
[1:33:04] he loves her into the situation yes I
[1:33:07] know love is corrective but my god when
[1:33:09] do we come to the place to where we
[1:33:11] start just laying aside some of that
[1:33:12] foolishness I know people married 40
[1:33:14] years sometimes they still the cats and
[1:33:17] dogs
[1:33:18] and then people always blame the woman
[1:33:20] well if she was submissive who knows Big
[1:33:22] Mouth the reason she's doing it is
[1:33:24] because you won't be submissive
[1:33:26] maybe she's got a little fight in her
[1:33:28] and won't put up with you big boy
[1:33:33] where's this coming from by the way help
[1:33:35] me
[1:33:37] right surrendering yourself to the Lord
[1:33:39] amen not a dictator preachers are not to
[1:33:42] be overlords over the house of God they
[1:33:45] take the oversight but they're not to
[1:33:47] Overlord over the people
[1:33:49] amen a bunch of preachers run around
[1:33:51] saying but you better see it the way I
[1:33:53] see it or you'll wind up in hell
[1:33:56] who showed it to you
[1:33:58] God showed it to the preacher
[1:34:00] so he's surrendered to God the same as
[1:34:02] the people should be surrendered to God
[1:34:04] right our mission is not to point
[1:34:06] ourselves to ourselves it's appointed to
[1:34:09] Jesus Christ
[1:34:11] amen do you believe that's true
[1:34:13] amen amen as brothers say when people
[1:34:16] listen to the radio don't turn your set
[1:34:17] off on me I turned out amen hang in all
[1:34:20] right second chronic chapter 34 verse 27
[1:34:23] now the Lord speaking to Israel here and
[1:34:25] he's giving them a kind of a
[1:34:28] uh like a praise or some kind of an
[1:34:31] encouragement to say and second
[1:34:33] Chronicles 34 27 because thine heart was
[1:34:36] tender
[1:34:36] thou does humble thyself before God
[1:34:40] well now notice his words against this
[1:34:43] place and it's the inhabitants thereof
[1:34:45] huh
[1:34:46] before me and did run thy clothes and
[1:34:50] wept before me I have even heard also
[1:34:54] saith the Lord now the Jews in their
[1:34:57] particular time whenever they were going
[1:34:59] to Humble themselves or chastise himself
[1:35:03] before the Lord many times they get in
[1:35:05] the dirt and grab a bunch of dirt and
[1:35:06] rub it on their face they would Rim
[1:35:08] their clothes they'd rip out their beard
[1:35:09] they would lay in sackcloth and Ashes
[1:35:12] they were showing God in a physical way
[1:35:14] that they were surrendered to his will
[1:35:17] to his mind they wanted God to see we
[1:35:20] are serious about you being in control
[1:35:22] forgiving us and taking over we have an
[1:35:25] equivalent of that today in the 21st
[1:35:27] century we call it giving your life for
[1:35:29] God like this amen maybe fasting from
[1:35:32] time to time having a prayer life taking
[1:35:34] time to come to church paying your tires
[1:35:37] and your offerings moving bitterness out
[1:35:39] of your heart loving God no matter
[1:35:41] what's going on around you and trusting
[1:35:43] the Lord our sacrifice and our humbling
[1:35:46] may not be exactly like it was and then
[1:35:49] with the Jews but when I come to the
[1:35:51] house of God and I give him my mouth and
[1:35:53] I give him my hands and I give him my
[1:35:55] worship and then when I walk out to him
[1:35:57] back doors amen I keep fighting the good
[1:35:59] fight and I sacrifice my life amen I'm
[1:36:02] doing the same thing that them Jews did
[1:36:04] when they would pull their beer down and
[1:36:07] if he heard them and brother bam said if
[1:36:09] he ever did it one time he's got to do
[1:36:10] it the same the next if he heard them
[1:36:12] he'll hear us
[1:36:16] hallelujah if we'll humble ourselves
[1:36:19] down then God can hear from heaven and
[1:36:21] straighten out many of our problems
[1:36:24] I think what we've done is we've come to
[1:36:27] the place to where we have such a deep
[1:36:28] knowledge of stuff
[1:36:30] we know so much about the message about
[1:36:32] history about the prophet we know so
[1:36:34] much about churches and how churches
[1:36:36] offering we become so dependent upon our
[1:36:40] own personal knowledges of things that
[1:36:43] we forget God is still in control of the
[1:36:45] universe
[1:36:46] he feeds sparrows and I don't even have
[1:36:48] it in my budget to feed one
[1:36:51] he lets the Earth turn around and I
[1:36:53] never even wake up and worry about it he
[1:36:56] takes care of everything if we let him
[1:36:58] have the control of life and everything
[1:37:00] else you'll find out it'll work a whole
[1:37:02] lot better when you let him be the boss
[1:37:05] let's just say I've got kids that are
[1:37:07] lost grandkids are lost I got family
[1:37:09] members that aren't saved amen but if
[1:37:11] you give them to God if you humble
[1:37:13] yourself down Amen to let God do the
[1:37:16] work you'll find out very quickly that
[1:37:19] every time you take it back in your
[1:37:20] hands you make it worse
[1:37:23] a lot of times the only thing you can do
[1:37:25] is just surrender it to the Lord and say
[1:37:27] God you see it you see it you know it
[1:37:30] you understand where it's at and I'm
[1:37:31] trusting you to take over and do the
[1:37:33] right thing
[1:37:34] in Psalm chapter 10 verse 17. now the
[1:37:38] Bible said Lord thou has heard
[1:37:41] of the humble
[1:37:44] now how many wants God to hear your
[1:37:46] desire
[1:37:48] well how does
[1:37:52] well now listen he said
[1:37:55] thou will prepare their heart thou will
[1:38:00] cause thine ear to hear
[1:38:02] so in other words
[1:38:05] when my desire is to say God you see the
[1:38:08] certain need or this certain thing every
[1:38:10] what it is
[1:38:11] your Bible said if I desire that
[1:38:14] if I believe you when I pray I'll
[1:38:16] receive it
[1:38:18] but if my desire doesn't align with his
[1:38:21] desire you might as well forget about it
[1:38:25] that's why we always pray first thy will
[1:38:27] be done as it is in heaven so let it be
[1:38:31] in the Earth or me
[1:38:33] and if I Surrender that to God in the
[1:38:35] right way and say all right Lord this is
[1:38:37] what I want this is what I think is
[1:38:39] necessary this is what we need this is
[1:38:41] the thing and I Surrender that and he
[1:38:43] says all right sounds great to me I
[1:38:45] think it's fine praise the Lord in
[1:38:47] Hallelujah I move right on in the will
[1:38:48] of God and receive what I'm asking for
[1:38:51] but if the Lord has a problem with it
[1:38:53] if he takes exception to it
[1:38:56] then that's where a lot of times
[1:38:58] we start falling into that category of
[1:39:01] trying to make it happen
[1:39:04] well I'm already in trouble I might as
[1:39:06] well just go ahead and clinch the nail
[1:39:09] we try to force it into a corner and say
[1:39:11] well I I think I can make this fit
[1:39:15] we'll come up with every quote in the
[1:39:17] world I mean you just watch whenever
[1:39:18] Kamala got voted in down there in her
[1:39:20] purple clothes every person in the
[1:39:23] message throwing a woman in purple woman
[1:39:25] in purple how do you know that's her
[1:39:28] you don't know anymore and I do you're
[1:39:29] guessing like I am
[1:39:31] and frankly I'm not waiting on something
[1:39:33] like that what I'm looking for is I'm
[1:39:35] looking for Ben to get lined up
[1:39:38] then to get straightened out been to get
[1:39:40] surrendered in the right way amen I'm
[1:39:42] not worried about what this world
[1:39:43] economy is going to do I'm not a part of
[1:39:45] this Cosmos out here I'm looking for
[1:39:47] what Christ will have us do
[1:39:51] I mean I understand people are curious
[1:39:53] fine but that's what I mean but if they
[1:39:55] can't make that work they'll try to take
[1:39:57] that square of Peg and shove it around
[1:39:59] the hole
[1:40:01] and try to make the thing fit I've heard
[1:40:03] people do that when it comes to
[1:40:05] marriages and remarriages and divorcing
[1:40:07] and everything else in the world I mean
[1:40:08] they've got a stack of quotes like this
[1:40:10] to prove why they're allowed to do the
[1:40:12] thing they already know they shouldn't
[1:40:13] do
[1:40:15] but this is what I'm talking about if
[1:40:17] we're surrendered to Christ in the right
[1:40:18] way if we surrender our life to them the
[1:40:21] right way and I have a desire for
[1:40:23] something and the Lord says no
[1:40:25] I need to be okay with that
[1:40:28] I need to be okay that he said no to me
[1:40:31] and I need to be willing to accept that
[1:40:33] he has the higher judgment and the
[1:40:35] higher authority he has the wisdom to
[1:40:37] know where that thing's going to lead
[1:40:38] and where it ain't going to lead
[1:40:40] and there are many many times in my life
[1:40:42] I'm looking back now a lot of times in
[1:40:44] my life just the last few months I've
[1:40:46] been thinking about certain little
[1:40:47] things that I really wanted to see
[1:40:49] happen I wanted to take place and now
[1:40:51] things are beginning to manifest in a
[1:40:53] way that now look I say if that would
[1:40:54] have happened look where I'd have been
[1:40:57] I'm talking about messes explosions
[1:40:59] disasters flaming disasters all around
[1:41:01] you and if I would have been able to go
[1:41:03] that direction it would have been a mess
[1:41:05] and I'm thankful I stand here tonight A
[1:41:08] grateful and thankful man to God that
[1:41:10] the Lord didn't always answer every
[1:41:12] prayer I put before him
[1:41:16] he knows what's best for us
[1:41:19] amen
[1:41:22] sure well you say but God gives us that
[1:41:24] as I want to see my my kids saved and my
[1:41:27] family saved and I want to see I
[1:41:30] understand where you're coming from I
[1:41:32] get that but I can't save me any more
[1:41:35] than you can save them or though
[1:41:36] yourself
[1:41:37] the only thing we can do is commit it to
[1:41:40] the Lord and ask God to let things
[1:41:42] happen all in place to give us the
[1:41:45] desires of his heart of our heart
[1:41:47] notice again in Proverbs chapter 16 19
[1:41:50] better it is to be of a humble spirit
[1:41:52] with the lowly
[1:41:54] than to divide the spoils with the proud
[1:41:59] now you see when brother Branham was
[1:42:01] told by his mother-in-law that the
[1:42:02] Pentecostal people was trash
[1:42:05] the problem that God took with that
[1:42:07] wasn't so much that listen you go back
[1:42:10] in history and look the Pentecostal
[1:42:12] people were trash in the eyes of the
[1:42:14] world
[1:42:15] they were the scum of the earth people
[1:42:17] looked at them they were poor and they
[1:42:19] were ignorant and they were unlearned
[1:42:20] had no Prestige about them or just all
[1:42:22] kinds of things but but the thing of it
[1:42:24] was his mother-in-law was trying to make
[1:42:27] them people beneath brother Branham
[1:42:31] and God took exception to that
[1:42:33] once brother Branham learned that he was
[1:42:36] going to pray for Kings amen you imagine
[1:42:39] how some of them people looked at
[1:42:40] brother Branham coming there with no
[1:42:41] education
[1:42:44] he was certainly beneath them as far as
[1:42:46] the way of the world goes but God didn't
[1:42:48] see it that way God didn't see that a
[1:42:51] king or a monarch was more powerful or
[1:42:52] better in some way than brother Brennan
[1:42:54] was amen why he allowed that man who he
[1:42:57] prayed for the king Amen to surrender
[1:42:59] himself to each other
[1:43:01] amen and this is what I'm saying if we
[1:43:03] got to be careful of this idea like with
[1:43:05] young people we can't look at young
[1:43:07] people and feel like they're beneath us
[1:43:09] listen to me church if we do that we'll
[1:43:11] lose our young people
[1:43:13] can't look at them as though they're a
[1:43:14] second class citizen can't look at other
[1:43:16] people as though they're beneath us well
[1:43:19] they don't have the Revelation I do and
[1:43:20] they know the message as long as I have
[1:43:22] well praise the Lord I'll get your gold
[1:43:25] star and your cookie for you after
[1:43:26] church
[1:43:28] to say the thing of seniority who's been
[1:43:31] in it the longest and who was in brother
[1:43:32] branham's meetings this is a life a
[1:43:35] Ministry of surrender one to another
[1:43:37] amen
[1:43:39] we should submit ourselves
[1:43:41] do you understand that many of you
[1:43:43] people in here I'm talking about you
[1:43:45] women do you understand that there's
[1:43:47] only certain things that men can do in
[1:43:49] talking to you you're limited in Sister
[1:43:51] Vice Versi you're limited how how deep
[1:43:54] of a conversation you can have with a
[1:43:56] man you're the opposite sex you ought
[1:43:57] not be talking real deep intimate things
[1:43:59] with each other
[1:44:01] and a man has only a limited knowledge
[1:44:04] and outside looking in knowledge of what
[1:44:07] it might be for a woman to go through
[1:44:08] that
[1:44:09] ever what it might be some female thing
[1:44:11] or female troubles or women problems or
[1:44:13] whatever it might be amen but how
[1:44:15] wonderful it is to know that there are
[1:44:17] sisters in the church that's been
[1:44:19] through that but are willing and open to
[1:44:22] say you're not beneath me I'll come talk
[1:44:23] to you about it
[1:44:26] think about the power of the church how
[1:44:29] unified how knitted together we could be
[1:44:31] if we just learn to surrender ourselves
[1:44:34] one to another
[1:44:36] run just because everybody don't do
[1:44:39] things the way that we think should be
[1:44:41] done does not give up all right to radar
[1:44:44] Fellowship from them
[1:44:45] no you say what's on the basis of the
[1:44:48] word then make it on the basis of all of
[1:44:50] it not just little pet parts
[1:44:53] little selected Choice parts that we
[1:44:55] choose
[1:44:57] right about all of it so better it is to
[1:44:59] be of a humble spirit with the low
[1:45:01] then divide spoils with the proud right
[1:45:05] again Proverbs 29 23 a man's Pride shall
[1:45:08] bring him low
[1:45:10] but honor shall uphold the humble in
[1:45:13] spirit
[1:45:14] so how are we going to be honorable
[1:45:16] through humility
[1:45:19] she will bring us to a plane amen
[1:45:24] humility will bring them to a true place
[1:45:27] of honor in the
[1:45:29] humidity will do it
[1:45:31] oh never saw that before
[1:45:34] amen Isaiah chapter 57 15. now speaking
[1:45:40] I said but that's the high and the lofty
[1:45:43] one that inhabitth eternity whose name
[1:45:46] is Holy I dwell in the high and holy
[1:45:50] place with him also that is of a
[1:45:52] contrite and humble spirit
[1:45:56] so God said you want to dwell with me if
[1:46:00] you've got a contrite and humble spirit
[1:46:02] you don't dwell down there you dwell up
[1:46:05] here with me
[1:46:08] no longer Paul said we're in Heavenly
[1:46:10] places in Christ Jesus
[1:46:14] right notice to revive the spirit of the
[1:46:19] humble to revive the heart
[1:46:23] of the right ones
[1:46:25] now imagine what this is
[1:46:28] this is Revival
[1:46:30] we talk about the bride's Revival coming
[1:46:33] it'll take him seven unknown Thunders to
[1:46:36] wake her up Brad hasn't had a Revival
[1:46:38] yet it'll take the mysteries of God
[1:46:40] unfolding to wake her up he said
[1:46:44] we talk about great things happening
[1:46:47] amongst the body signs and wonders
[1:46:49] missing limbs being restored ananiasis
[1:46:52] Safari returning
[1:46:55] but he said I only bring that Revival to
[1:46:58] those that are of a humble and contrite
[1:47:00] spirit
[1:47:01] so if we want bride's Revival
[1:47:04] this is the road to get in
[1:47:07] through true humility to the Lord
[1:47:10] now you say what does that look like any
[1:47:12] idea any thought any notion any desire
[1:47:16] anything that is of you I owe you it
[1:47:19] must be offered to him as a sacrifice of
[1:47:22] praise and as a presenting my body a
[1:47:24] Living Sacrifice unto him that whatever
[1:47:27] I am I'm willing to give it to him no
[1:47:29] matter what it is
[1:47:31] you realize one reason why people don't
[1:47:33] get any further than what they get
[1:47:34] sometimes they're just not willing to go
[1:47:36] that far
[1:47:37] but you see you know you'll have this
[1:47:39] this attitude a lot of times folks run
[1:47:41] into the owner and they'll scream and
[1:47:42] they'll holler and I'm not against that
[1:47:44] I don't mind if they're scream and
[1:47:46] holler but as long as they're there if
[1:47:49] they surrender themselves while they're
[1:47:51] there then that screaming Harlem will
[1:47:53] follow them out the door
[1:47:56] help me somebody
[1:47:58] the problem is you get emotional up here
[1:48:00] unless some preacher pray for you get
[1:48:02] emotional and that's all it was was
[1:48:03] emotion but you didn't allow it to be a
[1:48:06] surrendered experience to the Lord
[1:48:09] you can sit right here on these pews and
[1:48:11] I have no doubt in my mind just let the
[1:48:13] word penetrate your heart let it
[1:48:15] penetrate your soul and purpose in your
[1:48:17] heart God I may not get that perfect
[1:48:19] tomorrow but I'm willing to surrender to
[1:48:21] that truth and watch God change you
[1:48:23] setting right there and impuse but we
[1:48:25] got the wrong idea so what we do is we
[1:48:27] have big revivals and big meetings we
[1:48:29] get everybody shouting and running and
[1:48:30] crying and get them up here and they'll
[1:48:31] slide into the Altar and people are
[1:48:33] praying or crying or Screaming I love
[1:48:35] that
[1:48:36] but I've seen more trouble caused by
[1:48:38] that than I've seen good happen by them
[1:48:40] you know why because the instruction
[1:48:42] needs to be the only reason you're
[1:48:44] coming up there is because you're
[1:48:46] calling on help to help you get
[1:48:48] delivered and calling on help to get you
[1:48:50] in a place of surrender
[1:48:52] the Bible said lay hands on the sick and
[1:48:54] they shall recover if a man lays his
[1:48:55] hands on you it is not him that has the
[1:48:58] ability or the healing or anything he is
[1:49:00] only confirming that me and that patient
[1:49:03] is willing to surrender to God's word
[1:49:05] lay hands on the sick they shall recover
[1:49:06] I'm surrendering my symptoms I'm
[1:49:09] surrendering my doubt I'm surrendering
[1:49:11] my fears I'm surrendering the doctor's
[1:49:13] report I'm surrendering all the
[1:49:15] circumstances around me to believe God
[1:49:17] Is My Healer
[1:49:21] so we have big revivals and preachers
[1:49:23] preach real fast and loud and hard and
[1:49:24] run all over the building and then they
[1:49:26] get everybody shouting and jumping and
[1:49:27] running out the back door and I promise
[1:49:29] you if it's not Blended and married
[1:49:31] together with surrender all you've done
[1:49:34] is reproduce modern-day Pentecost and
[1:49:36] God hates the thing he wanted to throw
[1:49:38] it up
[1:49:40] he said it was lukewarmness when he saw
[1:49:42] that
[1:49:44] revivals have nothing to do with emotion
[1:49:50] oh somebody didn't like that well let me
[1:49:52] say it again then revivals are not
[1:49:54] produced by emotion
[1:49:57] revivals are when all of that trash in
[1:50:00] your life is now surrendered to the Lord
[1:50:03] the trash surrenders to the lake
[1:50:06] it surrenders to the churning and the
[1:50:08] bubbling of the lake it surrend us to
[1:50:10] God and the trash is washed out of there
[1:50:12] that is real bride's Revival
[1:50:16] but you get a bunch of people running
[1:50:17] around the country and around North
[1:50:19] America and Holland you know God's
[1:50:21] bringing a Revival to the people he'd
[1:50:22] been doing us as brother Brown left the
[1:50:24] place
[1:50:25] no it ain't a bunch of Select ministers
[1:50:27] around this message or a small group a
[1:50:29] circle of people that's bringing some
[1:50:31] new great no all they've learned to do
[1:50:33] is tap into the emotion of the people we
[1:50:36] don't need your emotions tapped in we
[1:50:38] need to teach you how to surrender to
[1:50:41] the word that's already been preached
[1:50:42] here
[1:50:45] young people you sitting here tonight
[1:50:47] you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:50:48] let brother Ben tell you how to get
[1:50:50] there surrender yourself to God that's
[1:50:52] that simple
[1:50:53] amen we've made it such a long drawn-out
[1:50:55] process if you're backslid on God how do
[1:50:58] I get back Surrender Your Life to God
[1:51:00] surrender your sins to God surrender
[1:51:02] your thoughts and your feelings of I
[1:51:04] can't do it and I'll never be there and
[1:51:06] I've went too far just quit trying to
[1:51:08] reason it out and just surrender that up
[1:51:10] to him and say God it ain't my business
[1:51:11] know how you take over
[1:51:15] the Bible said repent and be baptized in
[1:51:17] the name of Jesus Christ you know what
[1:51:18] that repentance really shows it shows
[1:51:20] someone who is willing to surrender
[1:51:22] their old self to God
[1:51:24] not just the old self but the whole self
[1:51:27] that's the purpose of Acts 2 38 when I
[1:51:31] go to the water and I'm baptized in the
[1:51:33] name of Jesus Christ I am confessing
[1:51:35] that I am dead
[1:51:37] and I'm surrendering my new life to
[1:51:40] Jesus Christ
[1:51:42] I don't care what their name is or how
[1:51:44] far they think they've gone Holy Ghost
[1:51:45] is sitting right here tonight waiting on
[1:51:47] you to just simply surrender all that
[1:51:50] Let Me Go a step further you're sitting
[1:51:52] here with a bunch of flexes and a bunch
[1:51:54] of fears and you can't seem to get out
[1:51:56] of the mess that's inside this mind of
[1:51:58] yours amen you've tried every self-help
[1:52:00] book in the world you've listened at
[1:52:02] podcasts you've talked to Saints you've
[1:52:04] read and watched everything on YouTube
[1:52:05] you can get your hands on but you still
[1:52:07] can't get free and you still can't get
[1:52:09] delivered let me tell you what your
[1:52:10] answer is just surrender all that mess
[1:52:11] to God and say Lord You're gonna have to
[1:52:12] take over from here
[1:52:14] amen it's too big for me to handle this
[1:52:16] too much for me I get out to the one
[1:52:18] that can do the job
[1:52:21] I've come to a place in my life where I
[1:52:23] realize I am not able to whip everything
[1:52:26] that comes my way
[1:52:27] sometimes I'm too weak and I'm okay with
[1:52:30] that
[1:52:32] I'm okay with that Revelation it's all
[1:52:35] right with me if I don't have all
[1:52:36] supreme power and authority and can
[1:52:38] handle every situation and always know
[1:52:40] the answers
[1:52:41] I'm okay with that as long as I know how
[1:52:44] to yield myself to him and say now Lord
[1:52:47] you see that this is why the Bible said
[1:52:49] when you've done everything you can to
[1:52:50] stand just stand there
[1:52:52] to stand out and wait on him just wait
[1:52:53] on him and let him show you what the
[1:52:55] next move is amen what a powerful thing
[1:52:58] it is for the bride of Christ
[1:52:59] to understand the minute surrender
[1:53:03] James 4 and 6 he gives more grace oh I
[1:53:08] like that amen he don't just give us
[1:53:10] Grace but he gives us more grace
[1:53:16] amen for he resists the proud and gives
[1:53:18] grace to the humble amen you want Grace
[1:53:21] tonight
[1:53:21] it comes to humility amen the Bible said
[1:53:25] so James 4 10 humble yourself in the
[1:53:28] sight of the Lord he'll lift you up now
[1:53:30] listen to this and questions and answers
[1:53:31] they asked brother ran him a question
[1:53:33] says I can't give over completely to
[1:53:36] Jesus have I an evil spirit now listen
[1:53:38] to this answer he said now let me spend
[1:53:40] the rest of the time on that there he
[1:53:41] said you can't surrender to Jesus he
[1:53:43] said I don't know if this is a man or
[1:53:45] woman I can't tell which it is God knows
[1:53:46] that but you can't surrender to Jesus
[1:53:49] why what's the matter if you're a woman
[1:53:51] don't you have to surrender your husband
[1:53:53] to be a wife surrender all that you are
[1:53:56] a little lady when you're married
[1:53:57] virtuous follow your life to stay
[1:53:59] virtuous but one day you found a man
[1:54:01] that you loved
[1:54:03] you were his completely the things you'd
[1:54:06] fought for all your life
[1:54:09] he said now you put yourself completely
[1:54:12] in his hands
[1:54:14] I love that
[1:54:16] amen he said that's right all you stood
[1:54:19] for in decency moral and everything like
[1:54:21] that and now you turn it over to this
[1:54:23] man because you surrender yourself you
[1:54:26] can't do the same thing for Jesus Christ
[1:54:27] Just Surrender yourself that way all
[1:54:31] that I am all my mind all my thoughts
[1:54:37] he said I don't think you're possessed
[1:54:39] of an evil spirit but I think an evil
[1:54:41] spirit anoints you with them kind of
[1:54:43] thoughts trying to make you think you
[1:54:45] cannot surrender yourself to God
[1:54:48] and I want to go on record right here
[1:54:49] tonight and say that anybody sitting in
[1:54:51] this building tonight anybody that'll
[1:54:53] stream this service anybody under the
[1:54:55] sound of my voice that would ever allow
[1:54:57] the devil to tell them that they have no
[1:54:59] ability to surrender to God Amen God
[1:55:01] sent me to tell you tonight amen it's a
[1:55:03] light it's not the truth and you have
[1:55:06] the ability to surrender to God
[1:55:08] they're who you are I don't care what
[1:55:10] your purpose of life is or how far
[1:55:12] you've went out and done this or I don't
[1:55:14] care what the back story is amen I have
[1:55:16] been given the ability
[1:55:18] to surrender to oh somebody help me amen
[1:55:22] I've been given the ability to surrender
[1:55:24] to God
[1:55:26] never let the devil tell you otherwise
[1:55:30] oh you said but I've served the Lord
[1:55:32] many years yes that means that there's
[1:55:33] many more surrenders to come then
[1:55:36] we should even be deeper in a life of
[1:55:38] surrender we should dig even deeper into
[1:55:41] these things of surrendering ourselves
[1:55:42] to God
[1:55:43] right and the attitude becomes well I
[1:55:46] just can't do it and the reason we think
[1:55:48] that way is because there's some worldly
[1:55:50] desire or some kind of pull of the flesh
[1:55:52] or some kind of lust to the eyes that's
[1:55:54] overtaken us and overwhelming us and we
[1:55:56] just give up to that thing over and over
[1:55:57] you know why you're giving up to it
[1:55:59] because you keep surrendering yourself
[1:56:00] to it amen but take that thing and
[1:56:02] surrender it back to Jesus Christ and
[1:56:04] give him the ability you say well if I
[1:56:06] mess up do it again tomorrow what
[1:56:08] happens the next day do it again the
[1:56:09] next day what if I mess up 10 years from
[1:56:11] now just keep on surrendering don't
[1:56:13] worry about it Abraham the body change
[1:56:15] will come eventually
[1:56:17] I'd rather be found never achieving it
[1:56:19] but fighting for it than to give up
[1:56:21] completely and let the devil have his
[1:56:22] way
[1:56:24] amen I feel like shatter at me Shaq and
[1:56:26] Abednego sometimes when it comes to me I
[1:56:29] don't know if God's going to deliver me
[1:56:30] or not
[1:56:31] but I know this much I am bound down to
[1:56:33] it
[1:56:36] I'm not giving up to that thing I don't
[1:56:38] care what it costs
[1:56:41] certain desires certain things certain
[1:56:44] pools certain this that and the other
[1:56:45] amen at the end of the day I may never
[1:56:48] overcome it completely I may go to my
[1:56:51] grave fighting certain things in my life
[1:56:53] but I'm like I'm like shout at me shake
[1:56:55] it a minute ago I don't know if he'll
[1:56:57] deliver me out of this fire but I'm not
[1:56:58] bowing to it either
[1:57:01] that's a life of surrender
[1:57:03] we've got to be so surrendered that
[1:57:05] we're willing to even lose
[1:57:08] right because some won't always let us
[1:57:11] win everybody
[1:57:15] there'll be some fights you'll lose
[1:57:18] he'll let you lose battles from time to
[1:57:20] time
[1:57:24] I see that's a much different type of
[1:57:26] preaching than that good one-liner stuff
[1:57:27] I guess they're going whoa
[1:57:30] oh yeah I'm gonna win every battle
[1:57:32] somebody's lying to you
[1:57:36] more than likely you'll lose a lot more
[1:57:38] on your win
[1:57:40] that's when a real Soldier has to be
[1:57:42] dedicated to the Army
[1:57:45] only ones that ever fought down through
[1:57:46] history that ever won anything there
[1:57:48] were some of the biggest losers on the
[1:57:49] street
[1:57:50] but they didn't give up they kept
[1:57:52] fighting their way through it no matter
[1:57:54] how much they might have lost or went
[1:57:56] down
[1:57:58] and one fellow said to me I'm on my 14th
[1:58:02] I'm one I said keep fighting
[1:58:06] keep going
[1:58:09] right now watch I love this in the
[1:58:11] resurrection of Jesus Christ brother
[1:58:13] Adam says it like this he said now if a
[1:58:15] person completely can surrender
[1:58:16] themselves to the devil and he will give
[1:58:19] them twice their strength
[1:58:21] what will happen if a man completely
[1:58:23] surrenders him God
[1:58:26] we crippled up can't stand up he's up to
[1:58:30] God he gets new life and new strength
[1:58:31] comes in he goes walking away
[1:58:34] but think of it not just the physical
[1:58:36] part of it but imagine many of you
[1:58:39] sitting here tonight and I saw a moment
[1:58:40] ago when I hit that Court about nervous
[1:58:42] oppression thing I saw faces lighten up
[1:58:45] so let me take a minute on this let me
[1:58:47] say this to you that if God can give a
[1:58:50] man that has broken ankles or disabled
[1:58:52] ankles or something the strength and
[1:58:54] leap like at the gate beautiful and come
[1:58:56] on how much more can God give you
[1:58:59] strength right here
[1:59:01] and right here
[1:59:03] in your human spirit in your memory in
[1:59:05] your imagination all them nervous
[1:59:07] thoughts that keep you tore up through
[1:59:09] the Dead all of that that that anxiety
[1:59:12] that you experience on a daily basis if
[1:59:14] God can give a man the ability to walk
[1:59:16] or a woman to walk out of a wheelchair
[1:59:18] out of a cotter stretch or something
[1:59:19] like that how much more could God take
[1:59:21] your mental capacity and put strength in
[1:59:24] it to overcome
[1:59:26] somebody help me
[1:59:28] I'm telling you that God ain't just here
[1:59:30] just to raise the dead but he's wanting
[1:59:32] to raise your expectation he wants to
[1:59:36] raise your Hallelujah he wants to raise
[1:59:38] your way of thinking he wants to elevate
[1:59:41] resurrect your belief in what God can do
[1:59:44] through you
[1:59:46] we've allowed the devil society and
[1:59:48] everything else to bury our confidence
[1:59:50] in the word of God
[1:59:51] we've allowed backsliders and bad
[1:59:53] preachers and bad churches and bad bad
[1:59:55] we've allowed that to intimidate us
[1:59:57] until the people of God don't have
[1:59:59] confidence like they should
[2:00:01] I don't care if ten thousand fall around
[2:00:03] my feet God is still God in heaven he's
[2:00:06] still the same yesterday in forever I
[2:00:09] don't care what person comes our way to
[2:00:11] mess this thing up we've still got a God
[2:00:13] in Israel he's still a God of War
[2:00:17] and he can teach my hands how to find
[2:00:19] he can teach my mind how to find he can
[2:00:22] teach my heart how to believe
[2:00:25] but I got to surrender to get there
[2:00:27] how weak we've become
[2:00:30] by allowing Satan to take from us the
[2:00:32] very strength that God gives us
[2:00:35] I don't mind telling you and I mean this
[2:00:37] sincerely that many times we don't have
[2:00:40] possibly the understanding of how to get
[2:00:42] there I understand that I get that I
[2:00:45] hear people tell me all the time well
[2:00:46] brother Ben I believe but I don't know
[2:00:48] how to get there I understand that too
[2:00:49] but that's the point I'm trying to make
[2:00:52] the beauty of this is you don't have to
[2:00:55] you don't have to figure out when this
[2:00:58] thought comes what do I do here when
[2:01:00] that guy comes in you just step back and
[2:01:02] say Lord You're The One fighting the
[2:01:03] battle not me
[2:01:05] and I'll pick up my sword and fight when
[2:01:07] you want me to but until I get strength
[2:01:09] to do it until this arm can that arm of
[2:01:11] faith can pick it up and fight I need
[2:01:12] your help to get me through this
[2:01:15] amen think of some of you sitting in
[2:01:17] here how many times you battle even
[2:01:19] trying to go to sleep at night because
[2:01:20] that mind's going around in a thousand
[2:01:22] directions do you understand the devil's
[2:01:24] taking something from you God promised
[2:01:25] to you he promised that you would have
[2:01:28] sleep do you know the bible promises
[2:01:29] everything that he'll rest
[2:01:31] now if you let the devil take your
[2:01:33] arrest from you it's time for you to
[2:01:35] start fighting to take it back
[2:01:39] it's mine by God's grace
[2:01:42] when I rest and rejuvenate my body I can
[2:01:44] be the Lord at my best potential
[2:01:47] but we allow the mind
[2:01:49] to overtake us and whether we admit this
[2:01:51] or not we become crippled right here
[2:01:55] we're just as disabled as some poor old
[2:01:57] fella laying in a wheelchair that can't
[2:01:59] hardly raise his arms
[2:02:01] we don't have the mental ability to be
[2:02:03] able to take that word into our mind or
[2:02:05] you say it's not about intellect hold on
[2:02:07] the prophet said it ain't mind over
[2:02:08] matter but he said if you take that word
[2:02:11] into your mind the word you take into
[2:02:13] your mind has power to reproduce itself
[2:02:15] and if I take that word into my mental
[2:02:18] mind it will drop Faith we'll get a hold
[2:02:20] of it in a drop into my soul and it will
[2:02:22] produce something out of there
[2:02:24] hey man I can stand here and say I'm a
[2:02:26] car I'm a car I'm a car my mind will
[2:02:27] never over the matter and make me a car
[2:02:29] amen but if I take his word in my mind
[2:02:32] that says I'm more than a conqueror
[2:02:34] through Jesus Christ I may not get it
[2:02:36] today but that word has power to
[2:02:38] reproduce itself amen and it will
[2:02:41] produce that out of my life if I let him
[2:02:42] do it
[2:02:44] praise His holy name
[2:02:47] the word is what's got the power in it
[2:02:49] and you've got to surrender learn to
[2:02:50] surrender of Truth
[2:02:53] that's the process
[2:02:55] God knows what he's doing trust the
[2:02:57] process
[2:02:58] stats of a perfect man so when you
[2:03:00] surrender your complete being
[2:03:02] he said then the Holy Spirit just pours
[2:03:05] through you and these virtues and things
[2:03:07] he said then you become a living
[2:03:08] Tabernacle
[2:03:10] again when we take like the virtues of
[2:03:12] the Lord see all of those things you
[2:03:15] know we we almost get like a uh
[2:03:18] almost like a checklist
[2:03:21] of how we're going to become perfect
[2:03:23] you know we work a little while all
[2:03:25] right Faith got it moving on to the next
[2:03:29] thing
[2:03:30] then we worked for a while and we say
[2:03:31] all right virtue I'm there let's move on
[2:03:33] to knowledge but see all of these things
[2:03:35] come from a new birth all of this this
[2:03:38] is not the statue of a perfect gourd or
[2:03:40] Ben or John or Susie or silent this is
[2:03:42] the statue of Jesus Christ this is his
[2:03:43] nature inside of you and all are working
[2:03:47] constantly constantly working through
[2:03:49] your heart faith is growing a little
[2:03:51] virtue's growing a little knowledge and
[2:03:52] all these things are working you all of
[2:03:54] them at the same time until all of them
[2:03:56] will finally Express until Jesus can set
[2:03:59] himself down on you as a seal of
[2:04:01] approval that is my son and daughter
[2:04:04] but brother Branham said in order for
[2:04:06] the Holy Spirit to pour through them
[2:04:07] virtues it takes surrender to get there
[2:04:16] I'm just going to go ahead and say this
[2:04:19] I know I can feel it while I'm preaching
[2:04:21] the thought keeps rebounding we don't
[2:04:24] need this
[2:04:26] we're already surrendered people
[2:04:29] we're beyond all of this
[2:04:32] shame on you
[2:04:34] that goes to prove you need even more
[2:04:36] surrender for even thinking such a way
[2:04:39] no Christian has such a rotten attitude
[2:04:42] like that
[2:04:43] I've been feeling you I don't know who
[2:04:45] you are but the Lord has shown me I'll
[2:04:46] walk to your pew
[2:04:49] no we don't need that kind of attitude
[2:04:51] the attitude we've got to take upon
[2:04:53] ourselves is like this God no matter how
[2:04:55] smart I think I am in this truth no
[2:04:57] matter how fur along down the road I am
[2:04:59] I need more of this in my life I need to
[2:05:02] be more surrendered to Jesus Christ than
[2:05:04] I've ever been in my life
[2:05:07] God knows that this quote is laying
[2:05:10] right there before us and I'm going to
[2:05:12] quote it to you patma's Vision brother
[2:05:14] Brown said a man that is fully
[2:05:17] surrendered to God is omnipotent
[2:05:22] but he's got to be fully surrendered
[2:05:23] first
[2:05:24] we love that statement when two
[2:05:26] omnipotents meet something's got to
[2:05:28] shake but in order for you to reach that
[2:05:29] omnipotence you've got to be fully
[2:05:31] surrendered to God
[2:05:33] why do you think women dress the way
[2:05:35] they dress why do you think you sisters
[2:05:36] behave and brothers behave the way you
[2:05:38] behave your your action your behavior is
[2:05:41] showing your surrender to the Lord
[2:05:43] this is why we don't believe in women
[2:05:45] cutting their hair and man running
[2:05:46] around like when I was in Jamaica
[2:05:48] Rastafarians down there with that long
[2:05:50] hair like that
[2:05:52] I burnt them up too didn't I says y'all
[2:05:55] was there
[2:05:56] yes sir God knows that the attitude
[2:05:58] we've got to have about things is not
[2:06:00] this mechanical manufactured attitude
[2:06:03] well if I go to church and I believe
[2:06:05] brother Brown I'm and I'm going to
[2:06:07] achieve something that's what you're
[2:06:08] missing no matter how much you might be
[2:06:11] sitting in that car and that machine may
[2:06:13] have the potential of taking you down
[2:06:15] the road until that mechanic surrenders
[2:06:18] itself to the spark you won't you'll be
[2:06:20] sitting right in the garage and that's
[2:06:22] what people have done for 60 years now
[2:06:24] do you realize that this message has
[2:06:26] outlived brother Branham
[2:06:29] he died in his 50s we're going into 60
[2:06:31] years now the message itself has
[2:06:33] outlived the prophet of God if we go
[2:06:35] another 40 years what's it going to look
[2:06:37] like in our churches
[2:06:40] we're almost a spot now to where when
[2:06:42] you try to preach the gospel to people
[2:06:44] they shouldn't get mad at you
[2:06:46] think about it I'm not saying about me
[2:06:48] tonight I'm saying in general oh I don't
[2:06:50] like the way he probably I don't like
[2:06:51] the way and you were surrendered
[2:06:54] we're surrendered with that attitude
[2:06:55] Ryan
[2:06:57] it goes to prove we've got a long way to
[2:06:59] go again
[2:07:01] and that we need the Holy Spirit to help
[2:07:03] us get to this place
[2:07:05] of surrender
[2:07:06] amen listen again I love this in the
[2:07:09] token I wonder today when God leads us
[2:07:12] to a life of complete surrender and
[2:07:14] service to him I wonder if our Spirits
[2:07:16] don't sometimes kind of rebel
[2:07:20] I'll man for the rest of you because
[2:07:22] it's true for me
[2:07:25] he said and then we wonder are we Lambs
[2:07:27] a lamb is obedient a lamb is
[2:07:31] self-sacrificial it doesn't claim its
[2:07:34] own or take its own
[2:07:36] it can lay right down hear the wolf off
[2:07:38] at the only thing he said it sacrifices
[2:07:41] everything it's got that's a lamb he
[2:07:43] said it gives
[2:07:45] it is and that's the way a real
[2:07:47] Christian is
[2:07:49] self-sacrifice themselves carrying
[2:07:52] nothing for this world but giving all
[2:07:55] they got to almighty God
[2:07:58] now you think about when it comes to
[2:08:01] things like knowing the will of God let
[2:08:03] me just give you an example in Ephesians
[2:08:05] 1 9 Paul said that he's made known unto
[2:08:08] us the mystery of his will
[2:08:10] you realize that many times even the
[2:08:11] will of God is something that's slowly
[2:08:13] unfolded to you
[2:08:15] he doesn't show you everything imagine
[2:08:18] if God would show you that in 10 years
[2:08:20] from now you'd be sitting in this church
[2:08:21] without a leg or be blind or someone you
[2:08:23] really love would be dead and they'd be
[2:08:25] taken to some horrible accident how
[2:08:26] would you worship God how would you
[2:08:28] serve God how would you come to church
[2:08:30] how would you read your Bible knowing
[2:08:31] that was laying ahead of you you see
[2:08:33] many times the grace of God don't reveal
[2:08:35] things to us because it's his grace
[2:08:38] keeping us right on the same Target
[2:08:40] right on the same pathway so we can keep
[2:08:42] our eyes single and keep marching right
[2:08:44] onto the gold
[2:08:46] I know some people say Well it wouldn't
[2:08:48] matter to me I'd serve him anyways yeah
[2:08:50] you talk tough when you're sitting on
[2:08:52] this side of it
[2:08:54] but when things confront you when you're
[2:08:56] faced with a confrontation of life and
[2:08:59] loss and sorrows and everything else in
[2:09:01] the world Amen it it affects people to a
[2:09:04] place it's where they can't serve God
[2:09:05] like they want to
[2:09:07] I don't care what anybody says you hit a
[2:09:09] hard trial it affects you
[2:09:11] humanly it makes you doubt yourself
[2:09:13] doubt God doubt the message doubt the
[2:09:15] pastor doubt everybody it puts you in a
[2:09:18] place where you're not even sure whether
[2:09:19] you got the goods or not
[2:09:23] and if God always showed us everything
[2:09:25] that was coming down the road brother
[2:09:26] Jose imagine if you would have known
[2:09:28] that that great sickness the Lord
[2:09:29] delivers you from imagine if you known
[2:09:31] that was coming down the road
[2:09:33] how would it have affected maybe the way
[2:09:35] you even read your Bible you might have
[2:09:36] got frustrated and Through the Bible it
[2:09:37] says what's the point
[2:09:39] but God don't show His prophets
[2:09:41] everything
[2:09:42] God don't show his children everything
[2:09:45] so he slowly unfolds his will he lets us
[2:09:48] know just enough
[2:09:49] to keep our eyes on the prize
[2:09:53] so that faith can take over somebody
[2:09:55] help me tonight so faith can take the
[2:09:58] right place and we can march on knowing
[2:10:01] that no matter what we're going to face
[2:10:02] he's there to get us
[2:10:05] I love to say this we always focus on
[2:10:08] tomorrow but don't forget before
[2:10:10] tomorrow arrives he's already there
[2:10:14] before tomorrow shows up God's already
[2:10:17] there
[2:10:20] and you realize this is the reason why
[2:10:22] annoying the will of God watch brother
[2:10:24] random when he goes through all of that
[2:10:26] with his family
[2:10:27] he goes into that room and there's
[2:10:29] Sharon Rose Lander she's eight months
[2:10:30] old imagine an eight-month-old baby
[2:10:33] he's not only suffered and preached on
[2:10:35] the streets and went through all kinds
[2:10:37] of persecutions for what brother Branham
[2:10:38] feels in his heart as the will of God
[2:10:41] but I looks at his baby and he looks at
[2:10:43] that baby and it's got one little blue
[2:10:44] on the cross
[2:10:46] he looks down at it and he said he'd
[2:10:48] like to kill him and he said I tried to
[2:10:50] talk to the Lord and said the Lord
[2:10:51] pulled the curtain in front of me
[2:10:54] now you know if a lot of people would
[2:10:56] have known what brother Branham was
[2:10:57] known imagine if he'd known hope and
[2:10:59] Sharon Rose is going to go that way the
[2:11:01] moment his mother-in-law spoke to him he
[2:11:03] would have said lady you crazy
[2:11:05] you think I'm going to listen to you do
[2:11:07] you know what's coming down the road for
[2:11:09] me if I don't
[2:11:11] but God didn't show brother Running Man
[2:11:13] he let him go through that time even the
[2:11:15] devil talked to him and said you've
[2:11:16] preached on the streets and done all
[2:11:18] this said there's your baby laying there
[2:11:19] dying now think of it he said after that
[2:11:22] happened he said of the tens of
[2:11:25] thousands of cross-eyed children that
[2:11:26] come on the platform he said not one
[2:11:28] didn't walk off without their healing
[2:11:31] yeah brother Brown would have known that
[2:11:33] he may not have been discouraged looking
[2:11:35] at Sharon Rose but God in his will will
[2:11:39] only sometimes open up just enough for
[2:11:41] us
[2:11:42] the fight will be right there in front
[2:11:43] of us and we don't know the outcome of
[2:11:45] the fight we don't know what it's going
[2:11:47] to produce but God lets it mold us to a
[2:11:49] place to where it's going to shape
[2:11:51] something in us for later on I guarantee
[2:11:53] you not one thing after that happened
[2:11:55] there was never a mother-in-law the one
[2:11:56] nothing mother-in-law's on the planet to
[2:11:58] try but get brother Bram out of the will
[2:11:59] of God then
[2:12:00] watch him in South Africa down there
[2:12:02] when those preachers got him out of the
[2:12:04] will of God you see the Lord Jesus knew
[2:12:07] that at one point in brother Ram's life
[2:12:09] the word was going to come open you
[2:12:12] listen to him when the opening of the
[2:12:13] word happens brother Adam said he read
[2:12:14] every commentary he read every that's
[2:12:17] why some of these people run around here
[2:12:18] The Defector people say rather than
[2:12:21] plagiarize I wish to God they knew what
[2:12:23] that meant
[2:12:24] when you plagiarize something you don't
[2:12:26] tell people where you got it from yeah
[2:12:28] brother when I was a plagiarizer he was
[2:12:29] the worst version of a plagiarizer could
[2:12:31] ever be he told everybody where he got
[2:12:33] everything
[2:12:35] he told us where he was reading after
[2:12:37] swindley and Knox and Calvin and Finney
[2:12:39] and and and all the rest of them you
[2:12:42] know he told us where where those
[2:12:43] circles come from up there he told us he
[2:12:46] got that from Larkin he said but when
[2:12:48] the Holy Spirit wrote it on the back he
[2:12:50] said I left a little light there God
[2:12:52] even corrected brother Branham and
[2:12:54] Larkin at the same time because the
[2:12:55] version on the back wall was a lot
[2:12:57] better than the one he had on the front
[2:12:58] wall
[2:13:00] God completely blacked out the age
[2:13:02] altogether he said
[2:13:04] what I'm trying to say to you is that
[2:13:06] when this prophet's message was going to
[2:13:07] come open he had to be in a place to
[2:13:10] where no one could move him from the
[2:13:14] will of God
[2:13:15] so the will of the Lord took him through
[2:13:17] many deep valleys and many hard times of
[2:13:20] having to feel the sting of going his
[2:13:22] own way
[2:13:24] you imagine every time you turn on a
[2:13:26] television Setter or pull up on the
[2:13:28] Internet some of these preachers out
[2:13:30] there that are starting to say oh
[2:13:31] somebody in Texas has got back trouble
[2:13:33] I'm feeling now that somebody's got a
[2:13:35] pain and brother ram calls that
[2:13:38] the angel of the Lord told him you tried
[2:13:40] to explain that discernment you caused
[2:13:42] carnal impersonations and that's been
[2:13:44] reverberating for 60 years now William
[2:13:46] Branham calls that but God put it in
[2:13:48] such a way to when the prophet did that
[2:13:51] amen when it come to the third pool
[2:13:53] listen how careful he is
[2:13:55] he said I've hid some things in my heart
[2:13:57] and I'll take it to my grave with me I
[2:13:59] don't believe it was some great secret
[2:14:00] that nobody was allowed to know but him
[2:14:02] but I think what he was trying to show
[2:14:04] us is he come to a place of such
[2:14:06] surrender that he wasn't just going to
[2:14:08] let everything out until the Lord told
[2:14:09] him it was okay to let it out
[2:14:11] I've got secrets in my heart I'm going
[2:14:13] to take to the Grave too one of them is
[2:14:15] my new birth
[2:14:17] that Holy Ghost that lives inside of me
[2:14:19] that's a secret I'm taking To My Grave
[2:14:21] God knows what my experience is that's
[2:14:23] an experience that I've got with God
[2:14:24] nobody can shape me from being that I
[2:14:27] wasn't born again nobody can talk me out
[2:14:29] of that foundation and I've come to the
[2:14:31] place by the grace of God not even me
[2:14:33] can convince me that I don't have the
[2:14:35] Holy Ghost
[2:14:39] but you don't get there overnight
[2:14:41] you get there by the Lord slowly unfold
[2:14:43] things to you
[2:14:45] the will of God is a challenging thing
[2:14:47] for people because they want to know
[2:14:49] God's will right now
[2:14:51] and sometimes he don't do that
[2:14:53] sometimes you got to wake up in the
[2:14:55] morning put that foot forward and wait
[2:14:57] get up and put that foot forward and
[2:14:59] wait
[2:15:00] but they that wait on the Lord
[2:15:02] they shall renew
[2:15:04] their strength and mount up with wings
[2:15:06] of eagles
[2:15:08] it goes to prove surrender is the key
[2:15:12] if I'm surrendered if you're surrendered
[2:15:15] then we could soar into the Heavenly
[2:15:17] places
[2:15:19] the confidence of God
[2:15:23] amen
[2:15:24] let me read you one thing before we quit
[2:15:27] listen he said he is the head of the
[2:15:29] body Colossians 1 18 the beginning the
[2:15:31] firstborn of the day that in all things
[2:15:32] he might have the preeminence
[2:15:35] because you see
[2:15:36] the problem with a lot of this kind of
[2:15:39] preaching like this is when we hear
[2:15:42] God wants the preeminence we think of a
[2:15:44] dictator
[2:15:45] somebody that's going to force us into
[2:15:47] being the boss
[2:15:48] but that's not the key to Christianity
[2:15:51] the key to Christianity is let go and
[2:15:54] let God have this wonderful way
[2:15:56] how does a man preach out of anointing
[2:15:59] how is he doing does he studied deeply
[2:16:01] is he learned how to say certain catch
[2:16:02] phrases does he you know excite himself
[2:16:04] into some kind of an anointing you know
[2:16:06] what he does he comes to the platform he
[2:16:08] starts letting go
[2:16:10] he just starts surrendering his mouth
[2:16:12] and his mind
[2:16:13] I've lost count of the times that I'll
[2:16:15] be 30 minutes into a sermon I'm going
[2:16:18] how we get here
[2:16:21] it isn't a coincidence when you
[2:16:23] surrender yourself the Lord people will
[2:16:25] operate the gift in you the Holy Ghost
[2:16:27] will take you all kinds of places and
[2:16:29] take you right down the line of where
[2:16:30] people are sitting there
[2:16:32] I have no doubt in my heart or mind
[2:16:34] everything I've said here tonight it was
[2:16:36] needed to say it because believe me when
[2:16:38] I tell you I had an entirely opposite
[2:16:40] direction I was going to go
[2:16:42] but here we are why because God knows
[2:16:45] how to take the preeminence over our
[2:16:47] hearts
[2:16:49] he's not a dictator
[2:16:51] get it out of your mind that God is a
[2:16:53] dictator
[2:16:54] he doesn't hate us and he doesn't
[2:16:56] dislike us
[2:16:57] when we go through hard things when we
[2:16:59] go through troubled problems and
[2:17:01] whatever else it's not that the Lord
[2:17:04] Jesus is trying to be mean to us
[2:17:07] but he's trying to help us understand in
[2:17:10] the part
[2:17:12] the whole of the will of God for
[2:17:14] ourselves
[2:17:16] you're a mystery your life is a mystery
[2:17:19] and that mystery like the Bible will be
[2:17:21] slowly unfolded
[2:17:23] slowly unfolded just like with the Book
[2:17:25] of Esther and these different books like
[2:17:26] that not everything these people did not
[2:17:28] all of it was God
[2:17:29] you go read some of the history of some
[2:17:31] of these people once they got out of the
[2:17:33] hands of the Lord amen that went into
[2:17:35] all kinds of chaoses and everything else
[2:17:36] but for the moment that Christ hid
[2:17:38] himself in them that's where we get the
[2:17:40] pages of the Bible in their life
[2:17:43] not everything I'm going to do or you're
[2:17:45] going to do is going to be God all the
[2:17:46] time you're going to make decisions that
[2:17:48] are completely contrary to the will of
[2:17:50] God
[2:17:50] but even that is a part of a greater
[2:17:53] plan
[2:17:54] to help you step into the right pathway
[2:17:56] all you say but God's children don't
[2:17:58] make mistakes
[2:18:01] yeah I know
[2:18:04] I wish I could say that was true
[2:18:07] I wish I could say with all of my heart
[2:18:09] that you'll never be sad
[2:18:11] that you'll never feel like a failure
[2:18:13] that you'll never feel like you've lost
[2:18:15] your last friend
[2:18:17] I wish I could say that this life wasn't
[2:18:19] a life of rejection and constant push
[2:18:21] and drive
[2:18:22] but it is
[2:18:24] God designed it that way
[2:18:27] to bring out all the goodness that's in
[2:18:29] US
[2:18:30] because you see he allowed the fall to
[2:18:32] happen to express the good that was in
[2:18:34] him
[2:18:35] but he allows the bad to happen to let
[2:18:37] the good in you be expressed the same
[2:18:39] exact way
[2:18:42] like we were talking today really trials
[2:18:45] and things of that nature if we can see
[2:18:47] it in the right way it's really
[2:18:48] blessings in disguise
[2:18:50] the bad is actually good
[2:18:53] if we can see it in the right way
[2:18:55] he said my brother encounter Joy when
[2:18:57] you fall into diverse Temptations
[2:19:00] I always listen I used to read that
[2:19:01] brother Gordon I think this this poor
[2:19:04] fellas baked his brain in the sun who
[2:19:06] would count it Joy falling into
[2:19:07] Temptations and trials and problems who
[2:19:10] in her right mind would do that I know
[2:19:11] you think I'm probably a blasphemer way
[2:19:12] I think but I can't I'm just being
[2:19:14] honest with you I look at them
[2:19:15] scriptures I think there ain't no way in
[2:19:17] the world any sensible thing a human
[2:19:19] being can say that
[2:19:20] you know of course my heart was open to
[2:19:22] the Lord and God would tell me you're
[2:19:23] just looking at it the wrong way
[2:19:25] well how am I supposed to look at it
[2:19:26] well this is what he showed you whenever
[2:19:28] things are happening they're going the
[2:19:30] way you like them there's a greater
[2:19:32] purpose in the things you don't see
[2:19:36] and when you're going through all kinds
[2:19:37] of problems when you could just realize
[2:19:39] he is in total control
[2:19:41] how could you not count it Joy
[2:19:44] how could you not be happy to know that
[2:19:47] he can take everything around you and
[2:19:50] make all things work together for the
[2:19:53] good
[2:19:54] of them that are the called according to
[2:19:57] his purpose
[2:20:00] I know I know
[2:20:02] but you don't know the failures you
[2:20:03] don't know the history you don't know
[2:20:05] the past it don't matter
[2:20:07] it don't matter what your back story is
[2:20:09] what matters is are you willing to
[2:20:11] surrender those things
[2:20:14] to the Lord
[2:20:16] God bless you stand with me
[2:20:27] well I wanted to preach something happy
[2:20:30] to you tonight but
[2:20:32] here we are
[2:20:36] I hope you're not disappointed
[2:20:43] if there's one thing that I've learned
[2:20:45] about people
[2:20:46] people don't like this kind of preaching
[2:20:48] in some ways
[2:20:50] so hard on them
[2:20:53] because you know we come walking through
[2:20:54] the back doors kind of low anyways
[2:20:56] and then some guy comes in and starts
[2:20:58] kicking Us in the mouth
[2:21:01] but you know we don't come to church
[2:21:04] to hear sermons about how great we are
[2:21:08] because that just takes you in the wrong
[2:21:10] direction
[2:21:11] we come here to find our faults
[2:21:14] now I don't want to just dig you in a
[2:21:16] hole and leave you there
[2:21:18] but I want to pray for you
[2:21:20] that the Lord will help you find this
[2:21:22] place to surrender
[2:21:24] there is great Authority and Power
[2:21:28] in learning how to do this correctly
[2:21:31] now I don't care what you're facing or
[2:21:33] what you're experiencing tonight or what
[2:21:35] you're going through
[2:21:36] be it a mental battle and some nervous
[2:21:38] thing some anxiety deal you've been
[2:21:40] working on it doesn't matter what it is
[2:21:43] if you'll surrender that to the Lord
[2:21:44] tonight watch in the coming days how
[2:21:47] things may be a challenge and maybe a
[2:21:48] fight but watch and see the Lord don't
[2:21:50] start picking up momentum and you'll get
[2:21:52] better and better and better and better
[2:21:55] because you know I've preached a long
[2:21:57] time trying to help people figure out
[2:21:58] how to be complexes and fears
[2:22:01] fix their life and things
[2:22:03] and you know after a while brother
[2:22:04] Carson you hit a spot where you're like
[2:22:06] I'd run out of stuff to say
[2:22:08] I've told them everything I Can Tell
[2:22:10] them I've showed them how to do it
[2:22:12] and you think what's missing what
[2:22:14] element am I missing you know everything
[2:22:16] I tell them this is it right here
[2:22:19] you can go to the doctor you remember
[2:22:21] when brother Neville had preached that
[2:22:23] sermon that morning brother picks up in
[2:22:24] Satan's they thought it was a cute
[2:22:26] expression he said the doctor could come
[2:22:28] in with a pan full of needles and said
[2:22:29] but if you spit the medicine out between
[2:22:30] your mouth he said won't do you no good
[2:22:32] that's what we're talking about
[2:22:34] you can have the best quotes the best
[2:22:36] preachers the best everything but until
[2:22:38] you surrender yourself to the medicine
[2:22:41] it will never affect you the way you
[2:22:42] want it to affect you
[2:22:44] I'm challenging you tonight I don't care
[2:22:47] what you're battling or what you're
[2:22:49] going through
[2:22:50] if you'll take that and surrender that
[2:22:52] to the Lord
[2:22:53] watch him change the scene
[2:22:57] can we bow our heads together
[2:23:00] now before they play I want to just keep
[2:23:03] everything quiet for just a moment
[2:23:06] with your heads bowed now
[2:23:08] every eye closed by looking around now
[2:23:10] just keep this between you and the Lord
[2:23:13] what is it that you're facing
[2:23:15] what are you going through
[2:23:18] picture in your mind
[2:23:20] call the words up in your mind
[2:23:22] put that thing before you in your heart
[2:23:24] and mind
[2:23:26] and I want you to see yourself taking it
[2:23:28] by your own hands
[2:23:30] and giving it to God
[2:23:34] in your own mind and heart Call It by
[2:23:36] name if you need to
[2:23:38] and say Lord Jesus
[2:23:40] thing has plagued me it's a besetting of
[2:23:42] sin or it's a some kind of a fear or a
[2:23:45] deep anxiety and I can't seem to get
[2:23:48] over it the Holy Spirit keeps pulling me
[2:23:50] back toward that oppression and anxiety
[2:23:51] or whatever it is brother sister ever
[2:23:53] who you are the holy spirit is wanting
[2:23:54] to deliver you tonight this thing
[2:23:57] you take that thing lay it before the
[2:23:59] Lord
[2:24:01] you say brother Ben are you going to
[2:24:02] pray for me sure I pray for you if you
[2:24:04] want me to
[2:24:05] but what I'm trying to do by God's
[2:24:07] Graces Empower you tonight
[2:24:10] to give you tools that when you walk out
[2:24:13] of this revival meeting tonight
[2:24:15] that you can take this home with you
[2:24:18] and you can do the work before you and
[2:24:20] the Lord you don't need anybody
[2:24:23] to necessarily lay their hands on you
[2:24:27] this is the bride's ability
[2:24:30] the wife's ability it's her nature
[2:24:34] to surrender it to God
[2:24:37] take that thing whatever it is and lay
[2:24:39] it before the Lord
[2:24:41] and just say God I'm giving it to you
[2:24:43] tonight
[2:24:45] it might be three or four things it
[2:24:46] might be several things in a row don't
[2:24:48] matter
[2:24:49] take it Call It by name and say this I'm
[2:24:51] giving it Lord giving you this and I'm
[2:24:53] putting that before you this need and
[2:24:55] this thing you see what it is

[2:25:22] you come to visit us and speak to us
[2:25:25] and Lord
[2:25:27] certainly I wouldn't want to put people
[2:25:29] in this kind of position
[2:25:32] I'm here
[2:25:34] how terrible it would be Lord to just be
[2:25:36] preached into a spot like this and have
[2:25:38] no way out
[2:25:40] the Lord Jesus
[2:25:42] let every one of your children gathered
[2:25:44] here
[2:25:45] those that may come and listen to the
[2:25:47] message at some point or those that

[2:25:51] might be going on
[2:25:53] the visible or the invisible honest
[2:25:54] don't matter
[2:25:56] Lord help everyone I'm to see the way

[2:26:09] surrender in our life

[2:26:17] scars all of our flaws all of our
[2:26:19] inconsistencies all of our weaknesses
[2:26:21] help us just take all of that and
[2:26:23] present it to you Lord
[2:26:25] that you could take us in your hands

[2:26:31] that we need to be

[2:28:01] have some kind of powerful Revival that
[2:28:03] throws you in the floor and slays you in
[2:28:05] the spirit this will do if God permit
[2:28:09] but you don't need that in order to

[2:29:43] brother Lord as a pastor you got a
[2:29:45] little home Church he's been working for
[2:29:47] you and working at the same time Lord
[2:29:49] he's tired and wore out from the gospel
[2:29:52] of Saint Lord bless him father give him

[2:30:14] name of the Lord Jesus for their healing
[2:30:16] we pray
[2:30:17] Hallelujah and hallelujah how many
[2:30:21] pieces I said
[2:30:24] you believe it
[2:30:26] now you realize the Gentile ways just
[2:30:29] speak the word
[2:30:31] right you see Jewish Traditions laying
[2:30:34] on our hands
[2:30:35] that's fine this will do if God permits
[2:30:37] it's fine if any lands have hands laid
[2:30:39] on me on a thought and I'll do it but
[2:30:41] you realize the Gentile way speak the
[2:30:43] word
[2:30:45] just believe it
[2:30:47] praise God
[2:30:49] you say but I didn't feel one thing he
[2:30:51] didn't say you had to
[2:30:53] you're not slapping a Pulpit and
[2:30:55] hollering Satan come away from him I
[2:30:56] don't need to
[2:30:58] God evidently felt like you folks here
[2:31:01] tonight had enough faith that I didn't
[2:31:03] have to take mine and help you get free
[2:31:07] evidently the Lord Jesus thought that
[2:31:09] you all could fight the battle on your
[2:31:11] own
[2:31:12] or else the atmosphere would be
[2:31:14] different right now
[2:31:16] if he didn't think some of you could get
[2:31:18] free on your own believe me when I tell
[2:31:20] you the Holy Spirit would have hastened
[2:31:22] that service to come to a spot of
[2:31:23] Crescendo where you'd have somebody
[2:31:25] laying hands on you right now but you
[2:31:27] know why he's not God must be confident
[2:31:29] you've got the faith and the ability
[2:31:32] Hallelujah
[2:31:35] praise the Lord
[2:31:38] right
[2:31:39] [Applause]
[2:31:42] you see when you got some grown-up kids
[2:31:44] in here
[2:31:45] growing up kids you got that one right
[2:31:47] grown-up children God when you got some
[2:31:50] girl Lord here you don't have to always
[2:31:52] grab them by the neck and say Satan come
[2:31:55] out of them sometimes you need that
[2:31:57] time you can't fight the battle
[2:32:01] definitely the Lord must have felt like
[2:32:03] you all can do it on your own
[2:32:06] I love it
[2:32:08] he's so good to us let's sing together
[2:32:10] Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord

[2:32:32] my nature as a person ain't to be rough
[2:32:34] like that I'm actually quite gentle
[2:32:36] sometimes too gentle but you see the
[2:32:39] word
[2:32:40] has to be Sharp
[2:32:42] God has to make it very plain for us
[2:32:44] sometimes so the line of demarcation is
[2:32:47] not blurred we know exactly what's right
[2:32:48] and what's wrong
[2:32:50] so you just know any hard preach I doubt
[2:32:52] you say well you you said I was a big
