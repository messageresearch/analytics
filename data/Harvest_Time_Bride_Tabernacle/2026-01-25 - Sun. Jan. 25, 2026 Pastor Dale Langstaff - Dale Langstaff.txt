Well, you can have your seats and we uh the the girls are going to come with a song and uh Amen. &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. It is our pastor's birthday tomorrow. &gt;&gt; And we wanted to thank our Lord Jesus Christ for his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And for what Jesus has called Pastor Dale to do. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As we know, that's not an easy road. &gt;&gt; Bless him. &gt;&gt; We want to thank the Lord for the love he has put in Pastor Dale's heart, not only for our congregation, but to all of those outside of these four walls. And we want to thank the Lord for how Pastor Dale is always in search of God's truth in God's word and standing for the truth no matter what those consequences may be. He's always also humbled himself and he's been very transparent, sometimes even revealing his own thoughts that he battles with. And it's encouraging to me because I I go through the same. And we also want to thank the Lord for all his time and sacrifices along with his his wife, sister Lanne, to help those in need. Yes. &gt;&gt; When I think about how much they have been there for me and my family in the last year, it truly brings me to tears and I truly thank God for the both of them. And in honor of our pastor's birthday, we are going to sing Consider the Liies as it's one of his favorite songs. &gt;&gt; We pray it blesses you. They don't nor with more splendor for soul. Oh my master who watches. Heaven really is my you know introduce you to his friend who the stars and tells the I to shine the flowers each morning with you to be together you Heat. Heat. Heat. He really cares where your head is. Cuz in the liies and then you will know. Amen. Let's sing the last verse again, Vicki. Amen. May I Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Amen. Consider the liies. Amen. Praise his name. That song is very, very humbling. Amen. Amen. Well, thank you, girls. But, uh, that was wonderful. But man, we're going to invite Brother Jeff. He's got a song for us this morning. Just uh very much uh enjoy brother Jeff and the family and and thank you. &gt;&gt; Praise his name. &gt;&gt; He sung for us last week when we were at his house. So, it's a it's a song he wrote, I believe. But, uh and just uh just very good to have him with us, man. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Blessed Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Just going to make sure my guitar is in in tune here. Amen. Blessed &gt;&gt; in Psalm 61, Jesus read uh Psalm 61 and said this this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing. And &gt;&gt; the go I love the beginning of Psalm 61 because what we see there, the gospel brings transformation. &gt;&gt; If it &gt;&gt; from darkness to light, lost to found. from alienated to reconciled. &gt;&gt; And that's what Jesus came to do. &gt;&gt; And uh it says this. It says, "The spirit of the Lord God is upon me because he has anointed me &gt;&gt; to preach good tidings to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, &gt;&gt; to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound. Amen. &gt;&gt; To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord in the day of vengeance our our God. To comfort all who mourn. To console those who mourn in Zion. To give them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning. The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. &gt;&gt; The Lord brings that kind of transformation. And then they go on and they become trees of righteousness, a planting of the Lord that he may be glorified. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So anyway, there's a there's a song I wrote and I want to I' been asked to come share it and uh it's just from that. Put on a garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we know that uh there's a lot of people that deal with heaviness or depression, &gt;&gt; but the Lord's provided the way up, the way out, &gt;&gt; something to overcome that. &gt;&gt; So, here we go. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat up here. Heat. Heat. By your blood sheltered in your name righteousness coming Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Amen. Thank you, brother Jeff. Man, we have a we have a job to do. If we don't lift him up, who will? Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; There it is right there. Lost my pad of paper. Amen. And flow through me, Holy Spirit. And this are prairie men flow. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. So glad I'm yours. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat up here. Amen. Praise his name. Amen. Amen. Heavenly Father, I appreciate you. Amen. Heavenly Father, Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Oh, heat, heat. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Amen. Let's just pray. Lord Jesus, what a day. What a day to serve you, Lord God, and worship you. And Lord, we thank you for your amazing presence in our lives and in this place, Lord God. Lord, I pray you'll bless your children, Lord God, your bride, ones that have come, Lord God, in cold day. And Lord, we love you. That's this just we love you, Lord God. There's no other but you help us, Jesus. Bless these beautiful people that you purchased with your very own blood. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh God, we pray that you're in this place and in our hearts, no matter where we walk, may our light be so bright and way we be so salty that the world will run &gt;&gt; for a drink of your Holy Spirit to us. Run to the water of life, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. And I just want to sing a kid song if that's all right. Amen. Happiness is the Lord. See Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hey, heat. Hey, heat. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. God bless you. Just thank you for the beautiful specials. Amen. And the kind words. Amen. God is amazing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, sister Domin. The girls and brother Jeff. I love Brother. I love songs out of the scriptures. That's just amazing. &gt;&gt; Psalms is full of just beautiful psalms, right? Just right out of God's word is just amazing. Amen. Maybe we'll just uh Thank you, honey. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we'll just turn to uh to his word today. &gt;&gt; God bless you for coming. And I wasn't really sure what was going to happen, but we live in Canada. &gt;&gt; This is this is fairly normal. &gt;&gt; I walked outside in my garage and I said, &gt;&gt; "It's January." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. John 17 9 and 10. Just want to carry on the same same uh thought. We read our scripture. I might give just a little testimony. Man, this is Jesus talking here. This is amazing. And I prayed for them. And I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me. For they are mine, and all are mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them. Just one more scripture. Ephesians or sorry, Hebrews 13. Hebrews 13 and8. a really common scripture that we know and I just I'm going to just testify a second before just a little shout out to the parents. I enjoy the kids in the alleyway. We're not opposed to walking the alleyways or even running the alleyways if they're blessed. They don't scare God. God loves children. &gt;&gt; They definitely don't scare me. Amen. If the kids are Amen. We could use a few adults in the alleyway sometimes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Be a lot easier to preach. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. Amen. God bless his word. And you may have your seats. Amen. Amen. I just before I preach, I just want to say uh just a couple things and just uh uh you know uh it seems like we're almost still in a New Year's Eve mode cuz we never really New Year's Eve we had a lot of snow and and that but uh uh you know anything that's truth is under attack. The Bible said repeatedly that if you were persecuted for truth that you were in good company because Jesus was and all the prophets they killed or stoned. &gt;&gt; So everything that's truth and we're living in an age where everything is gray. There's no but that's not true &gt;&gt; because the Bible talks about when the age comes that they call good evil. Y &gt;&gt; and they call evil good. &gt;&gt; It's a great sinful time. Amen. A great sinful time. Now, I don't mean we're sinful, but I mean the age, the thing, the situation around us, the atmosphere around us. And uh and so uh yesterday we had we had a beautiful day. Brother Jeff and Sister Dama and different ones can buy the kids some and but uh the beginning of the day I was communicating with brother Osman and and what sister Dama said is very true because Len carries as much pressure of the pastorship or more than I do &gt;&gt; because she's part of me. &gt;&gt; She's part of me. &gt;&gt; She's not just my wife. She's my rib. She's my flesh &gt;&gt; like you're part of God. &gt;&gt; That's what God said. &gt;&gt; God said, "Let us make you in my image." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so, our church personally here was under a great attack September 21st. I I don't really understand why, but I know that anything that is truthful &gt;&gt; is under attack. And you can draw great hope that anything that rises against you &gt;&gt; Yeah. to hurt you will never prosper. &gt;&gt; Will never ever prosper. But we were under a great attack on that uh day inside and outside the church. Amen. There was people that didn't like our video outside the church and is now posting us as false liars. And and uh it's something when God's Bible becomes a false liar. &gt;&gt; And there's people inside our church. was calling us false liars. Amen. And so, uh, God, just God help us. We're living in a peculiar God help you. God help me. Amen. God, but God is God. &gt;&gt; We don't have to fear. Amen. And so, I want to just show you something, you know, before we start. And and like our whole absolute this morning is the Bible. It's Christ. You know, John 1:1 said that in the beginning was the word. Amen. And God become the word and the word was with God and the word was God. &gt;&gt; That's it. This is what we believe in our Bible. &gt;&gt; It's the Bible. Now, we understand that some of the things in the Old Testament like the Sabbath, Jesus said, "I'm the Lord of the Sabbath." &gt;&gt; So, when the when the religious people came and accused, can you imagine tried to accuse Jesus for picking corn on the Sabbath? He said, "What are you talking about? It's not a day. The Holy Spirit is your Sabbath. &gt;&gt; I'm God. &gt;&gt; I'm your rest. &gt;&gt; I'm totally your rest. &gt;&gt; But you know, Revelations talk about that we can't add nothing to this &gt;&gt; or take nothing away from this. And &gt;&gt; at all. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; So I had somebody just actually after our service last Sunday, he said, "Well, I don't believe the Old Testament." Well, I feel sorry for you. You're probably in the wrong church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Because there's things in the Old Testament for us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I know we're in the grace dispensation. Yes. Understand? But we don't throw out the old we don't throw the things we don't like. &gt;&gt; Amen. But I want to ask you a personal question this morning. You can all put in your head. Which is your favorite book in the Bible? Favorite verse? You you you got it all in your head now? &gt;&gt; What's your favorite verse? Jesus never wrote it. &gt;&gt; A person wrote it anointed by God. &gt;&gt; That's the same as this morning. &gt;&gt; I'm not Jesus. &gt;&gt; But if I'm anointed by Jesus and I'm preaching the Bible, &gt;&gt; it was wrote by people under the influence of Jesus. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; so I would quote anybody from this pulpit &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; that is backing up the word of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Any person, brother, sister, child, preacher, anybody, anybody that dovetales with this Bible. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; You can love, you know, let me give you an example. I got a perfect example here right now and and then then we're actually going to preach. I was just all free, but Hebrews 13, I want to read three scriptures. I read one of them and most of us really love verse 8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. That's the God I serve. Yes. &gt;&gt; Because if God ever did it in the past, he can do it today. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; I mean, I don't serve a weak God. He didn't He didn't fall to sleep. He's not tired. He ain't cold. He's God is a spirit. And those that worship him must worship him in spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; Okay. So So most people when you'd read Hebrews 13:8, they go, "Woo, &gt;&gt; beautiful." &gt;&gt; Most of us would have that memorized, &gt;&gt; right? Now, most scholars would believe that Paul probably wrote Hebrews. Paul wrote most of the New Testament. Now, if he didn't write Hebrews, some say that it was a follower of Paul, somebody that came up after Paul. But let's read this verse just above eight. It's not near as popular. Remember them that have the rule over you, for they have spoken unto you the word of God. Uh-oh. Oh, don't believe that one. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; that must be an Old Testament scripture. &gt;&gt; Cuz we don't believe the Old Testament. But we don't believe the ones that we don't want to believe. &gt;&gt; For they spoke the word of God unto you. That's like the people that are on the internet and they say, "Well, you know, I mean, if we preach against sin and your conscience condemns you and you're a sinner, now you post you post pictures of our church website and say they preached against sin." What was I supposed to preach against? Yeah. &gt;&gt; What was I supposed to preach against? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. No. Okay. Then we read, you know, read verse eight again. That'll make you strong again. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Now, this is the same person that read this. Let's drop to verse 17. Obey them that have the rule over you. Why is he repeating that the same person? &gt;&gt; You know, I want to tell you something. I'm going to give you just like a like a commercial break. Anytime I repeat to my kids, they said, "You already told me that." You already told me that once. What do you tell me again? &gt;&gt; God does it all the time. &gt;&gt; He don't want you to forget it. What did Peter say? I bring these things into remembrance &gt;&gt; for your mind. Amen. Remembrance. I If I something new, you better get out of this place. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I can just bring it into remembrance the things you already know. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Watch this. But this c this scripture ain't near as popular to the people that want to pick and choose the Bible. &gt;&gt; Obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls &gt;&gt; as they must give an account &gt;&gt; not for themselves &gt;&gt; but for you. &gt;&gt; I had somebody that came here in the past said this was the government. I said I never knew Trudeau was watching for my soul. I'm going to have to give him a raise. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I just just laying a foundation. We believe the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we don't just believe the parts you think are popular. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. If I can show you where God put it in the Bible and you don't want to believe it, then show me where God took it outside of the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you can't show me where God took it outside the Bible, &gt;&gt; then you're not a believer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; See, the Bible is just for believers. That might surprise you, &gt;&gt; but it's not wrote for unbelievers &gt;&gt; cuz they don't believe. &gt;&gt; It is impossible for you to have faith &gt;&gt; to believe that that without faith, it's impossible for you to please God. And you must believe that he is the rewarder of those that diligently seek him. &gt;&gt; And you can't have faith unless you believe that Jesus Christ was sent by God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So if you don't believe Jesus Christ came to die for my sins, then you're not a believer. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; You might sit in the church. &gt;&gt; You might send all your money to the poor people, but that don't make you a believer. &gt;&gt; No. No. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Here Paul in Galatians just just laying a bit of a foundation before we get right into our examples of meeting Jesus face to face. You know, when we meet Jesus face to face, we won't take out parts of the Bible &gt;&gt; because Jesus is the Bible. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I marvel Galatians 1:6. And I marvel that ye are so soon moved from the grace of Christ unto another gospel. Was it wasn't the Bible gospel. This is Paul talking. And he said, "Which is not another, but there is some among us that trouble and would pervert the gospel of Christ." &gt;&gt; Watch this. September 21. There was some among us that perverted &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; the real gospel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Into their own interpretation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Watch what Paul says. But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which I have preached, let him be a &gt;&gt; By the way, this was Paul doing preaching. But God had given him the revelation of the written word in the spirit. And it was God anointing him to write this. And as ye and as we have said before, watch this. Remember what I said? My kids say, "You told me that once before." Here's God, right? Again, repeating it. I'm going to have to start saying because God does. And as we have said before, well, you already told me that. So say I again. Now this must be important. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If a man preach any other gospel unto you other than what ye have received, &gt;&gt; let them be a curse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's fairly straightforward. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just jump down to Judges and get into our texts. And we want to look at some examples and and uh you know, we'll just see where God takes us. And we got some promises at the end to uh uh you know to to to uh to uh to give us great hope in that. And again, I want to say I really really enjoyed the worship service and both specials were &gt;&gt; were supernatural, beautiful, very very beautiful. And you know a church is not about the pastor. A church is about a family. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We're not worshiping me. &gt;&gt; I'm just one of you, &gt;&gt; man. If the kids got a special, they should sing it. &gt;&gt; That's part of worship. &gt;&gt; That's part of church. &gt;&gt; If God anoints you and you get blessed, cry, or stand up or run the aisles or swirl or &gt;&gt; or your kids walk around, &gt;&gt; it's fine. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. See, we want what God wants. I want what God wants for me. &gt;&gt; Not just today, but in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we see here that Samson, I'm going to tell you something that will just shock you. We know all of Samson's life, and he had a few difficulties in his life. &gt;&gt; He liked women. &gt;&gt; He liked wicked women. &gt;&gt; And he had a few of them. But I'm going to shock you and I got scripture for it. Samson in that state was a prisoner of Christ. You say God unbelief don't hinder God. The prophet said that &gt;&gt; unbelief don't hinder God. And God knew before he called you &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; that you would make mistakes. God knew before he called me in my uh office that that there would be times that I would give my wife a hard time and have to go back and apologize cuz the pressure was so great. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we see here, let's just read uh Judges 169. And and here uh he's with Delilah and Samson slept on his knee and she caused him to shave off the seven locks. Well, Samson was was uh you know, it was a chosen of God and and these locks were a a a covenant, you know, an Azarite covenant. And uh this was a that the Israel had been overrun and they were prisoners in their own land and and hostages for many years because they had disobeyed God. You know, I want to just show you something. Even with Saul, I'm jumping way ahead, but you know, it's obedience is fairly important. You know, when we say we obey the Bible, God makes a big deal about that. &gt;&gt; You know, Saul didn't make out too well when he didn't obey. When you go fight the Amorites, kill them. &gt;&gt; Kill them. &gt;&gt; If you got some demons in your life, you better kill them. &gt;&gt; If that's what God tells you to do, &gt;&gt; struggles. &gt;&gt; And you know, we're going to look in that. But, you know, like the Bible is a paradox. And I couldn't begin to answer all the paradox of God because I only have a three-pound brain and God's omnipotent. &gt;&gt; Amen. God God's eternal. He's omnipotent and and he's awesome. And so when you hear somebody try to tell you every speck of God and like say, "Well, I got it all figured out." Well, don't laugh in front of them. &gt;&gt; You know, laugh behind them. if &gt;&gt; because I believe God has taken the mysteries in this day and and the Bible is a new book and it's revealed to us. But the Bible says that someday we'll see him face to face and we'll recognize the son of Jehovah &gt;&gt; and you won't hold it together when you walk in his presence. When you realize that the King of Kings left the splendor of heaven &gt;&gt; to come to earth &gt;&gt; to die for a sinner boy like Dale. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; I want to read you how I can say that Samson was a prisoner to Christ and all of his mistakes. See, some people don't want to follow somebody that's a human. &gt;&gt; Cuz you know my mistakes. &gt;&gt; But watch what God says in Judges 13, we're in a different chapter than 16. In Judges 13:3 and5, "And the angel of the Lord appeared unto a woman, and said unto her, Behold, now thou art barren, and thou beest not, but thou shalt conceive and bear a son." Now, let me just tell you what, every one of you, you didn't get your commission from the pastor. You got your Holy Ghost from God. &gt;&gt; You got your commission from God. This ain't a Catholic church where you got to come before a priest. you you do got to come before a priest, but it's the priest up there. The priest, the king of kings and king of glory. &gt;&gt; So, an angel of the Lord came to this woman in verse four. And now, therefore, beware. Now, he's commanding the woman, &gt;&gt; not the son that's going to come. &gt;&gt; And he said, now therefore, beware, I pray thee, drink not wine, nor strong drink, and eat neither an unclean thing. Now, now I want to just clarify this was the orders from the angel in this situation from heaven. &gt;&gt; And lo, thou shalt conceive and bear a son, and no razor shall come upon his head. &gt;&gt; Okay, now remember what I said. Samson and all of his faults &gt;&gt; was a prison Christ. &gt;&gt; Right here it is. For the child shall be a Nazerite unto this church. No, no, no, no. Unto God. &gt;&gt; He shall be a Nazerite unto God. God is the boss in case you forgot. &gt;&gt; From the womb, and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hands of the Philistines. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Period. &gt;&gt; God used Samson's God was called or Samson, sorry, was called of God, specially ordained, &gt;&gt; a chosen vessel that had loads of shortcomings. But even our prophet said that it was in in his shortcomings, it was God that was able to manifest the glory. &gt;&gt; Remember Israel had a lot of shortcomings? &gt;&gt; Remember how God said to to Moses, he said, "Pharaoh, I is this hard to believe? Do you know God could harden somebody's heart? Why would he do that?" Like, I can't explain that why he would. But the Bible says so he got glory. &gt;&gt; God loves &gt;&gt; glory. &gt;&gt; God loves He won't give it to nobody else. &gt;&gt; That's why if you worship a big pastor or a TV evangelist or a prophet or a anybody. There's one God. &gt;&gt; That's right. And he deserves the glory and the honor and the praise and &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the rest of us are a family &gt;&gt; in different positions. &gt;&gt; Y that's right. &gt;&gt; I don't even mind washing the dishes when it's this cold cuz I don't have to go outside. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Give me the broom, honey. I'm not going to the tractor. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And watch this in verse 27 of 16 of Judges. And the Philistines, this is what needs to, you know, most of the time. And you know, I went to the Philistines took Samson. I'm just jumping through this. You know the story, and put out his physical eyes. I want to show you something that when you really die out to Christ, like Paul said in the Bible, it's no longer I that liveth, but Christ that liveth in me. You won't come and say, "Well, I don't believe." &gt;&gt; Cuz you know, I I got to I got a Have you ever heard a dead man talk? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; It's no longer I that liveth &gt;&gt; but Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. It's no longer I liveth. So, I'm dead. But if you're really dead, you're not talking. &gt;&gt; It's God's anointing and God's spirit that's on. It's Christ that liveth in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they plucked out his eyes. And that's when Samson could concentrate on God. &gt;&gt; He couldn't look at wicked women then. Yeah, &gt;&gt; cuz he didn't have ice. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; And where I got this that Samson was a prisoner is is in the end of verse 21 is and they took him to the grinder mill in the prison house. &gt;&gt; And you know, you may be in the prison house in a grinder mill grinding for somebody that's attacking you, but it'll never prosper. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I want just give you just a a commercial break that every kingdom will fall but God's kingdom. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And you can attack God's work inside the church and outside the church and post it on Facebook and all that &gt;&gt; and I feel very scared for you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Very scared. I pray for mercy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Help us, father. You know the people in the Bible that came to Peter and lied before the Holy Spirit, God killed them. &gt;&gt; That quick. &gt;&gt; Now, we just read the scripture that Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. God don't like when you're lying about his wife, his bride, his Christian people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. God don't like when people lie about the bloodbought purchase of the lamb that he paid for. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Pray for mercy on those people. &gt;&gt; Because good things won't happen to them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Watch that. That's Bible. God's a just God. Vengeance is mine, sayaeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You can't mock God and think it's going to go good for you. No, no. &gt;&gt; Here, Samson was in the prison house working for God. And I want to give you great hope this morning that you can be in your prison house and the pressure can come in. You know, before the rapture, there's going to be a certain amount of pressure. You know, the world's kind of went goo. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But what Satan forgot was that St. Samson's hair in verse 22. How be it that his hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven. You see Samson's covenant, now this is a unique situation, but Samson's covenant was in his hair &gt;&gt; and his power was in his hair. &gt;&gt; And for sinful reasons, he told his secret and he lost all his power. &gt;&gt; But even in his weakness, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God was still alive. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And his hair started growing. And the people in the prison house when he was grinding the flower didn't realize &gt;&gt; that his hair wasn't shaved anymore. &gt;&gt; And Samson in verse 22 28, sorry. And Samson called unto the Lord and said, "Oh Lord, redeem me, I pray thee, and strengthen me. I pray they only this once. Samson met Jesus Christ face to face. &gt;&gt; See, Samson knew who to call out for. Samson knew where his strength come from. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Samson knew what it would take. And you know the story. Let's read second Corinthians. He killed Samson killed more in his death than he did in his whole lifetime working for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. 2 Corinthians 12:9. And he said unto me, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength, that's not my strength, is made perfect in weakness. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Must gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities. You know what the infirmities is? Shortcomings, &gt;&gt; mistakes. Said the wrong thing fell down. Here Paul and Corinthians saying, "I would rather gladly glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Samson had some infirmities. &gt;&gt; Samson definitely had some shortcomings. But in Samson's weakness and in Samson's terrible state, God was made strong in his weakness. Amen. For my strength is made perfect in weakness. Ain't that power? That's a great promise. You can say, "What am I doing for God?" Or like, "How how does I fit in your weakness?" God's moving mountains in your weakness. God's doing things that you can't even comprehend or see. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just jump ahead quickly here and we'll go on to Second Kings 2 and show you another one. Elisha. Elisha was an amazing prophet in the Bible. And and here he he come up. Elijah came up under Elijah. Elisha. And it came to pass in verse 9 that when they were gone over that Elijah said unto Elisha, "Ask what I can do for thee before I am taken away from thee." And Elisha said, "I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit fall upon me." Now, I just want to show you something. This is how the Bible's wrote. But understand, the Bible's wrote in a mystery. This wasn't Elijah's power. No, &gt;&gt; this was God's power in Elisha. &gt;&gt; Eli Elisha wasn't saying, "I want to be just like you, Elijah." No, he said, "I want double of God what you got." &gt;&gt; Amen. And verse 11, this is amazing how Elisha, Elijah, seeing Christ face to face. Verse 11. And it came to pass while they still went on the way talking and living their normal life, coming to Wyoming on a snowy day, that behold, there appeared a chariot of fire. Did they ask for a chariot of fire? &gt;&gt; No. and horses a pirate. And they both and a parted both of them aunderder. And Elijah went up in a whirlwind into heaven. And Elisha saw it and he saw the face of Christ and he cried, "My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof." Do you know? I want to show you something, saints. You know, and most of you do, maybe all. But you know, God comes down to earth in many different symbols. &gt;&gt; God came in the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They're in the upper room. He came down in the cloud. When he stopped when the the Egyptians came after Israel, it was a fire by night and a cloud by day. &gt;&gt; Who was that? They couldn't go through. It wasn't a strong army. &gt;&gt; Wasn't the Russian army. &gt;&gt; No, it was God. &gt;&gt; God was a fire at night. They couldn't go through it. They tried. &gt;&gt; But he was a cloud of day. I can drive through clouds, &gt;&gt; but not a God cloud. No. And God came down in a chariot of fire and horses of fire, but he took him up in a whirlwind, &gt;&gt; a cloud. And if you jump to verse 14, and Elisha took the mantle of Elisha that had fell from him, and he smoked the waters, and he said, "Where is the God of Elisha?" Why didn't he just say, "Where's God?" &gt;&gt; See, sometimes people have trouble following a man of God. I love it when the Bible says a man of God. I pray someday God will say that about you and me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you right now, if you're a believer, he will. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not maybe. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He will. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "Where is the God of Elisha?" Because Elisha had said saw God in Elijah. &gt;&gt; You know, we're living in a headless age anymore. &gt;&gt; I don't mean you guys are. I'm just saying the spirit in the world. &gt;&gt; Watch this. Nobody wants to get married. Bless God, I'm the boss. &gt;&gt; That that's just that's just facts. I mean, people get married when they're 40 and then 95% get divorced. Not not believers. I mean, in the world. &gt;&gt; Well, like we want equal. How do you you know, see, nobody wants headship. &gt;&gt; Nobody wants to sit under any &gt;&gt; but everybody watch this worships something. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you don't worship God, you worship Satan. &gt;&gt; And how you worship, I don't mean we don't worship I'm not talking about worshiping people. That's that's sin. That's of the devil. &gt;&gt; But you watch the people that worship the devil. They'll lay out 200 bucks to go to a rock concert and hear somebody go, &gt;&gt; "Yeah, that's right." &gt;&gt; You know what they're doing? They're paying their tithe. &gt;&gt; That sure are &gt;&gt; to Lucifer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; If you don't think you worship God, you'll worship your car that'll rust out really quick &gt;&gt; or your husband or wife that might disappoint you. If it's me, it's all the time. And uh or &gt;&gt; but God won't disappoint you. Amen. &gt;&gt; But God, I feel very sorry for people &gt;&gt; that just can't see God. &gt;&gt; I see God everywhere. &gt;&gt; It don't make you weak because you see God everywhere. &gt;&gt; It gives you eternal strength. &gt;&gt; Unbelievable strength. Elisha seeing God face to face. Amen. Let's go to Second Samuel and and and we're doing good for our time. 2 Samuel 6, we see and I mentioned this maybe a couple weeks just in passing because I was studying this message two, three weeks ago. But here we see that David met God face to face. David was a man after God's own heart. Amazing. Look at the David was a a murderer and an adulteress. &gt;&gt; And he was a man after God's own heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I couldn't have sat under David's pastorship. I would have had to get converted. &gt;&gt; Father, &gt;&gt; do you know do you know that when David committed adultery with Basheba that that uh who was the husband there? Uh &gt;&gt; Ariah. Ariah's family had to sit in David's church. I couldn't have done it, brother Jeff. I would have left. I would have said that. I would have said a couple things. Yeah. Yeah. I would have said, Do you know the same Bible says that if somebody touches your wife or husband that there's no forgiveness for that? That you'll never get forgiveness for that. The Bible says that &gt;&gt; for if another man takes your wife, the man will never forgive you. That's from the Bible. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's exactly what David did. &gt;&gt; And God come up and said, "I love you so much. You're a man after my own heart." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Uh, that'll take about a day to explain that one. &gt;&gt; But I can give you the short version. David knew how to repent. &gt;&gt; Yep. When D when the prophet came to David and he said, "You are that man, &gt;&gt; Lord." &gt;&gt; Before David was going to kill that man, &gt;&gt; it would have had to been himself. &gt;&gt; See how easy it is for everybody to pick out everybody else's mistakes? &gt;&gt; Bless God. We need blinders. I think sometime, you know, maybe in the future, Brother Lord, we might pass out like dark sunglasses with like uh the frosting on them so you can't see through them and with side things like for the horses &gt;&gt; and then if Brother Dale does something wrong, you won't see or hear it. &gt;&gt; Because &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wow. But when David here in verse 12, I believe it is, it must be the part. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Oadiah, I believe it is, into the house of David with gladness. And verse 15 in 2 Samuel 6, and so David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark with quietness. They weren't excited that God was in their midst. They didn't worship very much. They just put their hand up a little bit. &gt;&gt; They worshiped the Lord with shoutings and with the sounds of the trumpet. David was losing his mind &gt;&gt; because that that the the the tabernacle the the ark was come which which held the holies of holies in the Old Testament &gt;&gt; which you have in your heart today. &gt;&gt; The Holy of Holies is the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost. So you have it right inside your heart. But when David Oh, so watch this. Watch it. This is how it works. I want to show you how it works. So David was bringing the Holy of Holies back into Israel. And when he was getting in the presence of the Holies of Holies, listen the honey, this is really good. He completely lost all physical control. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That happened today. Well, every one of you are packing the holy of the &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Holies. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's where the Holy Ghost is. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And so when you showed up church, I &gt;&gt; That's about what I did when I heard Brother Matt behind me. I Oh, boys. Oh, boys. I considered closing church and he drove from Oh, &gt;&gt; don't worry. They made fun of David, too. So, you can make fun of me, too. It won't go very good for you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I think somebody should tell those people that are attacking the church from outside that won't make very good when you attack God. &gt;&gt; You know, you know what the you know what the that that God told the prophet in Israel when he said they have not rejected me you &gt;&gt; rejected me &gt;&gt; the word &gt;&gt; that I will lead you. How could people choose to be completely free, have no king, no army, no mistress, no cooks, no taxes. Oh, that would be Wouldn't that Wouldn't that be pretty cool? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they said, "We want that." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That sounds like the people in Canada. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the prophet went to him and said, "Wait a minute. Have I ever taken your money?" &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. No. Have I ever taken your sons for the army? No. No. No. No. Have I ever taken your daughters for my mistress? No. No. No. No. Have I ever taken all your horses and cattle? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. You're good. But we want you to take them. We want a king cuz we want to serve the devil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; Watch this. I said the devil. I didn't God didn't make a mistake when I said that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They said, "We want to be like &gt;&gt; the other king." &gt;&gt; All &gt;&gt; the others. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who did they serve? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The devil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; The devil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, on on situations like that, I need counsel either from God or my wife cuz I just can't figure that out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amazing. &gt;&gt; You know, it repeats the scripture. Remember how we talked about repeating in 1 Chronicles 15:25-28. And I'm not going to read it, but I'm just going to read the good part. It said, "David went up and the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the house, and they brought it in with joy. And all the Israel bought the ark of the covenant up with shoutings and the sounds of the the cornet and the trumpets and the cher the I can't even say these words. Anything that would make noise, &gt;&gt; they beat on it. &gt;&gt; God is not afraid of your noise. We are far too quiet. You're not going to offend me if you offend. Don't worry about offending me. You're definitely not going to offend God if you get &gt;&gt; you're serving God. You're not serving me. &gt;&gt; You're not serving the church. If God anoints you and you get blessed &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you got to hold it in because you're cuz you're afraid you're going to offend the church beside you, leave the church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Would you rather offend the church or God? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who said it in the Bible that I was I was a natic radical, a fool? &gt;&gt; For Christ. &gt;&gt; Whose fool are you? &gt;&gt; I've seen some pretty bad fools. And &gt;&gt; so have you. &gt;&gt; And you know they're never ashamed. &gt;&gt; You know, you see somebody that's stoned drunk and they're just puking over the toilet. I can be stoned drunk by the Holy Spirit, but I never have to puke in the toilet. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I'm the healthiest. My My immunity goes way up to the sky. Their immunity goes way down. High time we're not ashamed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; Put a high time you're not ashamed. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of the power of God. &gt;&gt; That'll lead me to salvation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed of heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes. Thank you, &gt;&gt; God. Help us. &gt;&gt; Exodus 14:30 and 31. Here we see that God brought Israel out by a mighty hand and and Moses was actually God actually told Moses, I mentioned this maybe before. God actually told Moses, "I will make you a god to Pharaoh." That whatever comes out of your mouth is my words. &gt;&gt; That That's power. &gt;&gt; That's power. You wouldn't have made out too well if you wouldn't have followed Moses in that day. No, &gt;&gt; you would have been the ones that the earth swallowed up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz when they got on the other side of the Red Sea, he said God was God has bad days, too. Honey, ain't that reassuring? God even had a bad He said he repented that he'd made men. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And God said, "All the ones that want are Moses side come and stand with Moses. All the other one, God just went and buried them alive. alive. &gt;&gt; That was the biggest mass grave in history. &gt;&gt; God didn't need bolos. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Exodus 14:3. And thus sayeth the Lord, thus the Lord, sorry, saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians. And Israel saw the Egyptians die upon the seashore. And Israel saw the great and mighty works of the Lord. See, there's people that are alive today that ain't seeing God. I have people all the time say, "I wish we would see the power of Pentecost. I have the power of Pentecost packed inside me. &gt;&gt; I woke up today. &gt;&gt; I got to tell you another story. I actually fell asleep last night. Do you know half the world has to take downers and sleeping pills? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, I can't see God. I People are walking into God. I can't see them." No way. &gt;&gt; How? &gt;&gt; It's cuz you got great big old scales over your eyes. &gt;&gt; Cuz you haven't been in the word enough. &gt;&gt; You haven't been praying enough. You haven't been looking for God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He hid himself from the wise and revealed himself unto babes. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And they saw the great work of the Lord that did come upon the Egyptians. And the people feared. Now, this fear is respect. They respected the Lord and believed the Lord, the servant of Moses. And when they sang and uh Exodus 15:1 and then Mo sang Moses and the children of Israel a song unto the Lord and I'll bet you that was one winging of a worship service. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Hey, you know what? Israel had just taken 40 years wages in one crack. Or no, not 40. 12 &gt;&gt; because they emptied the wealth of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they came and they'd seen God in the pillar of fire in the cloud and they'd walked on dry land and then they stood around on the dry shore and watched the horses and that drowned. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Brown. &gt;&gt; And then they had a worship service. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Wow. &gt;&gt; They didn't need a song leader. &gt;&gt; It was just like atomic bomb. Boom. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Moses saying the children, it was sing unto the Lord. They spake saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously, the horse of the rider, throw down the sea. And and he said, the Lord is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation. He's my God, and I will prepare for him at habitation. My father's God, and I will exalt him, and the Lord is a man of war, and the Lord is his vain. And verse 17, and they shall bring them up and plant them in the mountain heritage, which is made to dwell in the sanctuary and established. And here, let's just drop to verse 20. This is where it was. And Maliam was losing her mind, the prophetess, and the sister of Aaron, and she took the tambourine. She was very conservative. She didn't want to make too much noise. She definitely Oh, dancing. That would be in the spirit. &gt;&gt; No, she didn't ask for permission. She was like, &gt;&gt; she took the tambourine in her hand and all the women went there. Man, they were converted after their tambourines and and with dances. Praise the God for kids when they get out. And you know when kids get out and they can't walk too good that it's like they're dancing for God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hey. Hey. You don't think so? What did Jesus say? Said if you don't become like them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; You won't even see the kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Might be time that we can't walk too good. You know, my little Oliver, he's just learning to to walk and he's kind of wobbly, but &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And Miam answered them, and said, Sing ye onto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously, the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea. Do we still believe that? &gt;&gt; Can he do that today? &gt;&gt; Can he do? Well, I tell you what. Thank you. The ones &gt;&gt; he can for the ones that believe. &gt;&gt; But if you come to the pastor after church and say, "Well, I don't believe in the Old Testament because that wasn't for us." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. See, God can't do it for everybody. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's right. &gt;&gt; It's for believers. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Believers. &gt;&gt; You must believe. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; I believe. I believe. &gt;&gt; I believe that God's more than able. Amen. I got another example was Mary that washed the woman that washed Jesus' feet. I just want to go through that fast and actually just let me give you the scripture. It's Luke Luke 7:36-48 and also John 12 1-8. But I want to show you the example and I love this. Amazing. So here's a woman that's a sinful woman and she's seen Jesus face to face. and in her state of sin, a wicked woman. John called her Mary. All the other gospels called her a wicked woman. But when she saw Christ face to face, she took all of her wealth. All of her wealth. &gt;&gt; All of her wealth. And bought a special ointment. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And she probably didn't even know why, &gt;&gt; but God did &gt;&gt; because the sacrifice had to be anointed &gt;&gt; before it was killed. &gt;&gt; And the church people that had all the answers came up to this Jesus God said, "Don't you think we wasted that money?" And Jesus said,"I have a question for you." There was two debtors and one owed a lot of money and wo just a little bit. So like let's give an example. One was born in the church and really never sin and that's beautiful. I'm not taking away from that. But if you had a bad attitude and you thought you were so holy that you barely needed forgiveness cuz like &gt;&gt; that that would be sad. And then you had the woman that was just she had no doubt. She was just a sinner. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he said, "If their debt was forgiven, this is Jesus now. This is this is God." Asked in the church, "Who would love me the most?" He said, "Oh, the one that was forgiven the most." And he said, "So I forgive her &gt;&gt; because she's actually able to love me &gt;&gt; like I expect." &gt;&gt; See y I'm going to just give you close with this and I got a couple scriptures just for promise. God don't this ain't condoning sin. &gt;&gt; I believe in being honest and &gt;&gt; and good character. You're taking your character with you. But heaven will be full of bad people. &gt;&gt; Grateful because they were able to say, "Lord, I know I'm bad. I deserve hell, but only because of you can I get into heaven." &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; You're saved by grace and not of yourself, lest any man &gt;&gt; should boast. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Bless God. I'd never do that. I don't care. &gt;&gt; You're saved by grace &gt;&gt; and grace alone. &gt;&gt; Period. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the woman at the well and the woman caught in the act and Rahab and and David and David. Oh boy. and Samson and they'll all be there. &gt;&gt; Even Saul. Hebrews and we're winding her down. Hebrews 12:1. Therefore, seeing that we are compressed about by such great cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight of sin and sin that does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us. and 2 Corinthians 1:20 and 22. For all the promises of God in him are yay and in him amen. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not sure if God could do that again. &gt;&gt; Hello. unto the glory of God by us. &gt;&gt; Now, which he has established us with you in Christ and has anointed us in God. That that's a pretty powerful voice. Now that he has established you in Christ and has anointed you, that means you're not alive no more. anointed us is God who hath also sealed us and give us the earnest of our spirit in our hearts. Amen. What an amazing God. What an amazing God we serve. Amen. I tell you at church, we should be so careful. So so careful &gt;&gt; to to put God in a box. &gt;&gt; We can put him in his word &gt;&gt; cuz that's who he is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't believe. You just I mean it wouldn't even be edifying, but you just wouldn't believe the people that come by our path say, "Well, I don't believe this part, but I believe this part. by the hundreds and thousands. &gt;&gt; But in James, it says if you didn't believe in this, if you were guilty in one part, &gt;&gt; you're guilty of the whole law. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God did the greatest judgments on those. You know, with Saul, he said, "Obedience is better than sacrifice." &gt;&gt; God just said, "This is who I am. &gt;&gt; Will you love me?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's just really sad when people start, well, I well this, you know, this ain't for this day and this was for over there and God changed and he he can't heal. No. Oh my my I don't serve a God like that. &gt;&gt; My God didn't change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; God help us. You know, God's ability in his Bible is a paradox. I I want to I just felt this come to me and I and I wasn't going to say it and but I want to show you something. You know, you know the people that got to heaven, you know, I read a poem here a few months ago with that and it was about somebody getting to heaven. I'm just paraphrasing fast but paraphrasing. And they were they got to heaven and they were just stunned and shocked at people that they seen and they thought that there must have been I don't know what they were thinking but they they must have thought they were still on earth and possibility there might have been some mistakes at the pearly gates and this really makes you think it made me think and they cannot talk to somebody that had authority like Peter or Jesus or something. And they said, "Hey, I didn't think heaven would be like this. I didn't think brother Dale would ever make it." And the person they asked, they said, "Sh." Or, "Sorry, the person that was asking this person, he said, "Why is everybody so quiet?" He said, "Cuz they're stunned that you showed up." You see, we always think that everybody else is a sinner, &gt;&gt; but we're a saint. &gt;&gt; Like, that's Bible. &gt;&gt; Take the beam out of your own eye &gt;&gt; before you try to get the sliver. &gt;&gt; That's why people can't sit together in a church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because they're trying to take a sliver out of somebody else's eye &gt;&gt; and they got a beam in their own. &gt;&gt; I mean, that's just Bible. If that offends you, that's right. &gt;&gt; I'm not even sorry because it's Bible. &gt;&gt; I mean, I What am I supposed to preach if I can't What am I supposed to preach when somebody comes up and says, "Well, I only believe this part of the Bible but not the other part." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know what I told that person? Well, I believe it, so you're probably in the wrong church. &gt;&gt; I mean, that's not being mean. &gt;&gt; That's just being plain truthful. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Anybody that would take away or add to, I would just take them right out of my kingdom." &gt;&gt; Amen. God, help us. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you know, we have to we need a lot of understanding and grace because God wants us to be a family. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to give you a big shock. You don't know everything. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Father. Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And neither do I. &gt;&gt; That's right. Do you know and I I I I really am closing. Do you know when Saul was become king was because the people wanted that &gt;&gt; and Saul disobeyed God's direct order from a prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he brought the money and the valuables back, the animals and the king. &gt;&gt; And he said the people made them do it for worship. And the Bible says, not brother D, that God took his spirit from Saul. &gt;&gt; And somebody asked me this the other day. That's heavy. Now, now I'm going to show you God. I'm just going to show you God. And the Bible says that God, forgive me, God, gave him an evil spirit. But God's not evil. How did God do that? &gt;&gt; How did God give him an evil spirit? &gt;&gt; Because God's a holy God. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm showing you something. Obedience is really a big deal. &gt;&gt; But I I I want to jump ahead of this. And then Saul was afraid of a war that was coming up. And he went to the witch and she pulled up the spirit of the prophet. And the prophet told him, he said, 'Wh'd you bring me out of my You know all this scripture. You can pull it up. And then the prophet told Saul. Now wait a minute. Now, now wait a minute. Now watch this. Saul is now a sinner, right? Well, by my sin, like I mean, right? He ain't got the Holy Ghost no more because God took it. &gt;&gt; He's got to be a sinner. And the Bible says that the prophet said that today you and your son will be with me in heaven. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. He &gt;&gt; saw is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Can I explain that all? No. But I told you what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God's not evil. So my suggestion would be that God allowed an evil spirit to come on him because he was disobedient. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But how did God remove his spirit from Saul and then say you're in heaven? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That means you're going to fall off your chair when he said that means that Saul went to heaven without the Holy Spirit. I thought you had to have the Holy Spirit to get to heaven. &gt;&gt; I actually believe you do. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you get that figured out, let me know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, &gt;&gt; I just showed you something that God is the boss. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That's right. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad I ain't the boss? &gt;&gt; I'm mighty glad some other people aren't the boss. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; God is the boss. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; God's You look at all the names that God is. &gt;&gt; He's just the boss. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. God can do everything but fail. &gt;&gt; Everything but fail. &gt;&gt; That that's you know what I mean? So when you see people say, "Well, that's not the way I see it." That's not the way I see it either, but it's still in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Help us. &gt;&gt; Unbelievable. I think I better show you something. Just just will you forgive me? &gt;&gt; 1st Samuel 16:14 and and when I show you where this is found, I just got I don't want anybody going out and say Dale was a liar today. 1st Samuel 16. Now, now there's one disclaimer, though. If you don't believe the Old Testament, well then then well then then you're set free. &gt;&gt; Oh, hilarious. God must really have a chuckle in heaven sometimes. &gt;&gt; 1st Samuel 16:14, "But the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him." &gt;&gt; I I do not understand that. And it troubled him so badly that the next verse said, "And Saul's servant said unto him, Behold now an evil spirit from God trouble a thief." &gt;&gt; And let's just jump down to not have the next one in there. So, I always got to find it. &gt;&gt; Well, I got it on my phone that I didn't edit my iPad. But after this part, Saul, because of in an army, went to the witch. That'll be still in Samuel. It's just down a couple chapters. I I just didn't edit here. I actually got a message started for down the road. God's family. I had that in there. And Samuel, he Saul wanted to know, "Are we going to win the war or not?" And he said, "No, you will lose the war and God will scramble it, scatter Israel, but you and your son Jonathan will be in paradise in heaven with me." Saul's in heaven. That that shouldn't make us cadet. That should make you rejoice that even if you're sitting and you know I'm a loser and I'm a saw that I'll be in heaven with you, &gt;&gt; loser and winner. &gt;&gt; No, but you see, we have believers have no right to judge. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Wasn't it Christ that died? &gt;&gt; See, I never died. &gt;&gt; It was Christ that died. So why am I pointing fingers? &gt;&gt; So all be pointing at yourself. &gt;&gt; And you know if that ever happened in the family of God, we'll go home in a rapture cuz we'll be united. &gt;&gt; And like it'll be such a hoopla that we'll we'd have to have walls around the town because the whole town would be converted. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. because we would stop con you know what the and I wow the who is the accuser of the brethren &gt;&gt; Satan so why is it coming out of believer's mouths &gt;&gt; if it comes out of a so-called Christian you're either a make Christian or you're anointed of the devil Yeah. &gt;&gt; So I can't say so I this morning can't say well none of you are good enough cuz in Christ you're all good enough. &gt;&gt; That's the kind of God I want to serve. &gt;&gt; That's that's &gt;&gt; the kind of God I want to serve. I want to just give everything to him and just say you're the boss. I love you. However you run your kingdom, that's entirely up to you. But I love you and I'm going to be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, God's just amazing. Amazing. Amazing. All in the Bible. God, help us never to get to the point where we reject God or God's family because we think we got God figured out. &gt;&gt; Well, bless God, they don't come to my church. &gt;&gt; Or bless God, I don't believe the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. Amen. Amazing. Just amazing. The truth has that set me free. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. A Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Amen. All sword. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hey, Heat up here. Heat up here.
