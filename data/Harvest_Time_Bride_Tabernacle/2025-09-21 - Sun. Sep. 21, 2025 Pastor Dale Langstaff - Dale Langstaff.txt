And we thank you as we near to the end. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. &gt;&gt; We're going from an intellectual conception of who you are and who we are. &gt;&gt; Yes. and we're going into a revelated revelation of who you are &gt;&gt; and who we are. You're preparing us for the rapture, Lord. And you're bringing us into a that intimate relationship with you, Lord. You've given us a spirit of adoption where we can cry, "Aba, Father." &gt;&gt; And we welcome your presence in here this morning, Lord. For you said, "We're two or three are gathered together in your name. You'll be in the midst of us." We're claiming that. We're counting on it. You're a God.

Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, uh Patty's daughter, Lord, we she's uh served uh divorce papers, Lord, and we know according to your word, you hate divorce, Lord. I pray that your spirit will go forth in that situation and bring love, bring understanding, Lord Jesus, and bring revelation that it's you are the problem solver. It's your love, not our carnal love, Lord. We pray that you'll bring peace. I call for peace in that family in Jesus' name. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jesus. Hallelujah. And you see our dear sister Joanie, Lord, she's said before that she's had uh faith when she was younger and now it seems to have waned. Lord, I pray that you'll raise her faith up that her eyes can be healed. Lord Jesus, I pray God that she'll reach out and claim her healing and the scripture that says by his stripes we are healed. for those that are on the internet, Lord, whatever uh problem they might have or whatever uh situation they're in, whatever they have need of, Lord, I pray that they'll feel the presence of the Holy Ghost on the other side of the internet.

We want to welcome Mom, Sister Tombi. God bless you. It is a great honor to have you in our midst. Amen. You are you are greatly loved by Christ and us. And what a what a beautiful reflection of Christ. We have a a great privilege to have Sister Ruth's going to share a testimony and just tell you, you know, publicly. Um there's there's no problem with time, Sister Ruth. It's a it's a fantastic testimony how God and we we we love and adore your family very much. And you know, sometimes when people are going through something, we don't know the story. And and so Satan puts thoughts in our head. Well, and you know that's of the devil. It's just a root for any of those thoughts I had. I'm sorry. And even not praying as much as I should. Sometimes people are going through a mountain of a trial and we just are like and and it's just beautiful how God's So we ask Sister Ruth to come. God bless you all. &gt;&gt; I don't even know where to start. I'm literally trembling. &gt;&gt; Bless Jesus. All right. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Bless your heart. Thank you, Jesus. Blessed be your name, Lord Jesus. [Music] Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; So, um, four Sundays ago, that was August the 24th, um, Brother Dale wanted to sing the song, Till the Storm Passes Over. Those of you who were here, you will remember that um after the service, I texted Brother Dale and I told him that that song was for me and um I'm just going to actually read the text message. [Music] God bless you, brother Dale. I just wanted to say that that song till the storm passes over was specifically for me. I am in a health battle right now which I cannot say much about at this time because the Lord instructed me to hold my peace and not say anything. [Music] The Lord has been sending me a particular scripture about nine times since October of last year and he is taking me through this storm. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; And he is confirming his promise and therefore I am testifying of this to his glory. So that's that was my text message to brother Dale. And then I g I sent brother Dale a sample of the scriptures that the Lord had been sending to me which I had received about nine times up to that point. Um so brother Dale responded and he says, "Praise God for this wonderful testimony and the scriptures. [Music] God gave me that song last week. So that means he gave him that song the previous week. But that day, August 24th, he felt led to sing it. He said, "I'm very sorry for not praying more, but I will be praying for you and your miracle." Then I responded back to Brother Dale and I said, "That just shows how perfect God is. He knew we wouldn't be in service the Sunday that God gave him that song and he planned it for August 24th when I was here. And if you remember [Music] the devil tried to make it not happen cuz Vicki could not find the words for some time of that song. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And eventually Vicki found the words. &gt;&gt; So God's purpose can never fail. &gt;&gt; Um, so two centuries ago, I could not fit into this outfit I'm wearing today because I had a tumor. And that tumor was this big. Wow. &gt;&gt; On my left breast, the hand that I'm holding up right now. &gt;&gt; Wow. I was here last Sunday, but not a single person here knew that I went through surgery the Friday before &gt;&gt; to get that tumor out. Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; On August the 12th, my doctor called me and she told me I had breast cancer. [Music] Exactly a month after, which was last Friday, is when I had the surgery to take it out. And as I stand here before you, I am 100% healed. Praise you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; My mom is sitting here in this audience today, and this is the first time she's hearing of that diagnosis. Nobody except my husband knew. And because the Lord instructed me to keep still and hold my peace, I obeyed that. I didn't tell a single soul and he had a reason for that. [Music] &gt;&gt; So why did I have to go through that? What was the purpose of God allowing me to go through that experience? &gt;&gt; Because he loves me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And because he loves you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God told us &gt;&gt; we present our bodies as a living sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he chose my body. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To bear a cancer. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that through this testimony, somebody even if it's one person &gt;&gt; can be helped. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord, thank you Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. [Music] On Monday, this past Monday, I had to go to get the drain taken out of my chest. Um, so just to back up a bit, I had the surgery on the Friday, Monday morning, just to show you the grace of God Almighty, I went to work and I drove the bus and I picked up students and dropped them to school. No pain, no problems whatsoever. So, I usually go in the morning, I pick up the children, I take them to school, then I have a a break in between and I go back at 3:00 to pick them from school and take them home. So, during that break, I had an appointment at 1:00 to take the drain out. When I went to the clinic, the nurse tried to remove the the the tubing, but the pain was excruciating. It was the best way I can describe it was like putting a fish hook &gt;&gt; under your rib and pulling it with with every force possible. That was the most painful experience. [Music] [Music] So I didn't go back to work that afternoon. But when I came back, I could hardly drive home. The clinic is only 30 seconds away from my house. And by the grace of God, I made it home. And as I lay down in my bed, [Music] the Lord asked me, "How many stripes did the Lord receive on his back?" I said, "39. And they used a Roman whip which had several prongs or several strings and it had metal balls and bones and a hook at the end of each. And that's what they whipped him on his back 40 times or 39 times for our sake. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said that pain you experience is just a small snippet of what he went through. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; And he had no sin. He had no nothing that he did that he deserved &gt;&gt; to go through that. That's right. That's right. And the Lord allowed me to experience just a little bit of that pain to know what our Lord went through because he loves us. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Wow. So the main reason why he put me through this experience is because we have too much cancer in the body of Christ. [Music] God knows that I I dread every second of me standing here to say these words cuz I feel like I'm like I'm a preacher like brother Dale. I'm not preaching to you, but at the same time, I am. Brother Dale just says we are all ministers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We're all witnesses. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And our lives preach the gospel and our testimonies preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm here doing. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He says there's so much cancer in the body of Christ and he wants to cut it out. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; We have a church only 7 minutes away from here. &gt;&gt; We can't fellowship together. &gt;&gt; We can't sit down and have a meal together. Our children are deprived from playing together. [Music] &gt;&gt; 7 minutes away from here. And we have to live like that. &gt;&gt; And each one of us is claiming that we have the love of Christ in our hearts. [Music] We're all singing that when when we all go to heaven &gt;&gt; which heaven when we can't even sit together. &gt;&gt; Amen. here on earth. [Music] &gt;&gt; There's so much discord, so much indifference, &gt;&gt; so many cold hearts, &gt;&gt; so much fearless. [Music] &gt;&gt; There's people in this congregation that won't lift their little finger to go and say, "God bless you" to somebody. They'll turn your face away from you. They won't greet you. They won't hug you &gt;&gt; because Satan has put a cancer in their hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz somebody hurt them. &gt;&gt; And they've built a wall [Music] &gt;&gt; trying to protect themselves, &gt;&gt; but you're killing yourself instead. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And killing everybody else around. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; There are people who have left this church because of cancer. &gt;&gt; Spiritual cancer. &gt;&gt; There's people who are sitting at home right now not going to service &gt;&gt; because of spiritual cancer. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] and we're clinging to it [Music] and it's killing us and God is saying get drop it. [Music] Some people are so bitter. Some people are so unforgiving. Some people are so arrogant. [Music] God wants to take it out. Anytime [Music] you go for surgery, the surgeon cannot do a single thing unless you sign a consent form. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And today, God is asking us for our consent &gt;&gt; for him to do the surgery that we need &gt;&gt; to survive. If I didn't sign the consent, I might as well have just &gt;&gt; accepted the death sentence. [Music] &gt;&gt; Jesus name. [Music] Every song that was sung here today [Music] is a testimony. It is no secret what God can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Praise you, Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Nothing between my soul and the savior. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus &gt;&gt; in the cross be my glory ever. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just gave you a little snapshot of what my cross looks like. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to give the glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. He told us to pick up our cross and follow him because that's the only way he gets the glory. [Music] Just in case anyone has any doubts of what I just spoke about, here are the medical reports of what I just told you. The biopsy, the surgery report from the surgeon. Another biopsy report. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise you, Jesus. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Jesus has a trophy of his power. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I give him all the praise. &gt;&gt; The honor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I pray that after this testimony, somebody will give the Lord consent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To do surgery because that's what this is all about. &gt;&gt; Thank you and God bless you. [Applause] Amen. That would be a a great video to post the time on for other people to see the testimony of what God can do. Amen. You know, that was just beautiful. Perfect. God is alive and well and and he's right here in our midst, you know. It's just so He's everywhere. Like Sister Ruth said about the song and and just her healing just Let's sing one song before we minister. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. I can feel his mighty power and his grace. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Christ [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] might Oh, [Music] [Applause] I hear [Music] [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] res. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord Jesus. To think that we are so small and you are so amazing, so awesome, obnot. [Music] And you never left us for a moment. [Music] That in itself is amazing. Lord Jesus, wow. Thank you for Sister Ruth and her testimony. Forgive me, Jesus, for my sins. [Music] Thank you, Jesus. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Wow. We sure love you, Jesus. Amen. [Music] Amen. We're going to read a scripture. Thank you, honey. Romans 5 verse 8 just in case there was somebody present that didn't think God was still alive or real or he only gathered in big places. I'm gonna preach on love. And God gave that to me yesterday or Friday, sorry, f Friday evening late. And I put it in my notepad yesterday morning when the girls went shopping before John Garrett's. And God, but God commanded his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Lord Jesus, you are just amazing and we love you. And I pray somehow that you'll show me and show your people who you are. In your name we pray. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. We serve an amazing God. You know, Sister Ruth, I again thank you for the testimony. That was just very, very beautiful. You know, God is concerned. Not brother Dale. I'm not concerned. I mean, only because God is, but and and you know, I'm going to read some things that the prophet said, and I'm going to tell you ahead of time. They're directly connected to the message hub. They're Oh, I sorry. They're directly connected to the message hub, to the verse that we're reading. That's directly what the prophet said about the scripture. Now, there's another scripture. I'm going to read some to it. So, it's how the prophet broke down God. And you know, when we were away at brother John Garrett's, you know, we seen many people, many many people we didn't know. Many people I I didn't know. And that was wonderful. But God's concerned and and I don't I don't know how to explain. I mean, the prophet's going to uh minister today when we read his quotes, but God is love. &gt;&gt; God is love. And you can't make other people's decisions, but you can love them so much that they the Bible says that you will heat coals of fire on their head that they will lose their mind because they don't understand your love. cuz it's not flesh love. &gt;&gt; It's agape love. &gt;&gt; And God is a jealous God in the part that God commands all of our love &gt;&gt; and and uh you know it's just where did I put that? Sorry, I covered something up. But you know, and and and I I don't know how to preach. And I tell you what, Lanne asked me, she said, "Did you she asked me something about my message, and she said, "God, give me" and I told her, we were catching the elevator to go to Johnson. I said, "God, give me two." So when Sister Ruth texted me this morning, I said, "Oh, everything's good. God knows everything. You know, &gt;&gt; we're going to preach next Sunday in advance on love. But you know we I if it's not we then it's I I should be careful not to elevate anybody. Like God's no respector &gt;&gt; of person. So watch how my I I'm trying to make this personal. Watch how my speech is. See, we betray oursel in our speech. Now watch what I mean by that. You know, see, God is omnipotent. So he's everywhere. And the very definition of God is love. &gt;&gt; Not cheap love, genuine love. Love that it, Brother Brham said, it was not the nails that held them on the cross. It was not the Romans had very little to do with it. It was love. It was love. But I believe God sent the greatest Well, we know. I don't just believe it. I believe it. And I know that God sent the greatest message ever to hit the earth. That was himself in this day. God himself came down. But you got to remember God's a spirit. And and we're gonna if if we don't get it today, I promise we'll get it next Sunday. I'm going to show you. But I'm going to going to jump ahead what God's seen. This is what God's seeing. You know, we got there early to the party and and I and this is not this is somebody you don't know. Probably probably most of you've never seen him. somebody come up to me and they were telling me about their church and they said, "Well, somebody's coming from so and so area like 25 hours away and and I I I want you to see how God heard that." They were elevating. You see what I mean? They weren't saying they came to God. And we have to be careful that we don't elevate our pastor, &gt;&gt; the ministry, our church. Wyoming is nothing. It's a dot on the map. &gt;&gt; Ants could walk over top of it. Okay? But any place like, see, God uses every place and person. &gt;&gt; But because we're in a tabernacle of clay, we see. Now, this is scripture. I want you to watch this. In Revelations, John fell down to to worship the servant twice. &gt;&gt; Now, that scripture is not on my notes, but watch what the servant told John. He said, "I worship God. &gt;&gt; I am your fellow brother." &gt;&gt; The greatest mockery to the greatest truth in the world is worship of a prophet. &gt;&gt; The prophet never believed in that himself. It's love. God uses Sister Ruth was right this morning. Sister Potty ministered to her son-in-law. Everybody has Did I'm doing something wrong. Oh, everybody has a ministry. We have got so tied up and and and uh the prophet says this. Can I just say it ahead of time because brother &gt;&gt; D, &gt;&gt; God is love. And we got so tied up in law. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. and law like like though God didn't there's a purpose to law &gt;&gt; but God is not confined by law &gt;&gt; receives that &gt;&gt; there's a purpose to law I believe in holiness I believe there's things Christians should do but God is not confined &gt;&gt; to holiness God's not confi God is God &gt;&gt; Amen Amen. So, you see how I I'm I'm not I'm I'm I'm going to get off this subject, but I want to show you how God is a jealous God and he just wants our love. We should be witnessing about God, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Don't tell them. I mean, maybe I mean, you know, I believe in church. I I do believe in church, but it's not about the church. It's about God. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not about in my doctrine or your doctrine or even the it's about God. &gt;&gt; God did some, you know, we've been preaching on compassion. God did some peculiar things in the Bible. &gt;&gt; The Good Samaritan is out of the book of the Bible. &gt;&gt; That Good Samaritan was a pagan by religion. &gt;&gt; And God said he had eternal life. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's hard for brother Dale to comprehend, but God's working on me. You know, so God God came God so loved the world that he came he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life. That's John 3:16. We all know that scripture by heart. You know the prophet, and I'm going to probably get into that more next week, he commented on that hundreds of times, that verse. hundreds with an S. You know, somebody else that was these are all believers I'm telling you about. I'm not telling you this down because I'm guilty of this. You know, somebody else said they were we were talking about somebody that had ministered in Ontario and it was really good. It was it was for the young people and it was really good. And another believer was there and he said, "Well, you know who ordained him?" And I'm like, &gt;&gt; "Yeah." After I left that, I said, "Well, who cares who'd ordained them?" Amen. &gt;&gt; God ordained them before the foundation of the world. As if the organization made the person a great man &gt;&gt; and he delivered a great message 25 years later. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It had nothing to do with nothing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It had absolutely zero. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not who prays for you. &gt;&gt; If you want to get healed, have the youngest child in this church pray for you. have Girius pray for you. You'll be because they just have something that us old people &gt;&gt; have a hard time grabbing. It's just blind open faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They have very little fear. We have to teach them to be afraid. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Children are not born with the fear of walking in front of semis and cars and walking off the cliffs. It's fear. Yeah, &gt;&gt; but there's no love. There's no fear in love. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's amazing the God we serve. &gt;&gt; And that same place, this all happened within about one hour. Another believer or some of these were different, some of them were the same. Some come up and they said, you know, I seen something online like it was across the continent and they said, you know, you you really need to listen to it cuz the man died two weeks later. And I'm like, we preach the message. Does this does &gt;&gt; have to use the internet? &gt;&gt; You see what I mean? You see, &gt;&gt; church, I'm not God. &gt;&gt; I know you already know that cuz you know me too well. Most of you know me when I was young and non-converted, even if I said I was. &gt;&gt; But nobody else is God. And yet, we're all God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read Romans 5 1 to 8. I just read verse eight and I want to read some things just and and I want to finish and I'm going to preach next week, but I want one of these quotes to really sink in. And this is whole thing is love. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access by faith unto his grace, wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. And not only so, but we glory in tribulations. Now, Sister Ruth was testifying about that. God used our sister as an example. &gt;&gt; And if you don't think God's God, I was in Indiana at the Marriott Motel when he when I printed out these scriptures and loving these quotes. &gt;&gt; And what was sister Ruth talking about this morning? The testimony. You can't make this stuff up, church. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we glory in the tribulations also, knowing the tribulation workketh patience. &gt;&gt; And patience experience and experience hope. And hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. For when we were yet without strength, in due time, Christ died for the ungodly. You could just change that to brother Dale. When I was yet without brains or strength, God died for me. &gt;&gt; For sincerely for a righteous man, for scarcely, sorry, will a righteous man will one die. Yet pre- Avenger for a good man some would even dare to die. But God commanded that's a that's God dictating himself &gt;&gt; commanded his love towards us in that while we were yet sinners &gt;&gt; Christ died for us. Wow. You know, we have to be so careful in our walk. Satan is a liar. I mean, he is the biggest liar in the world. I mean, this I know you know that. But &gt;&gt; Sister Ruth, I want to share something with you. I want to show you life. We just had our camp just a few weeks ago and before camp meeting I asked Sister Ruth if she would be would she take care of taking the pictures and Sister Ruth said well I'll get back to you. I'm I'm not sure if I want to be I'm not sure like some it was a very nice answer but and you know Satan would tell me one thing you know what he told me and Sister Ruth's going through the biggest mountain of her life &gt;&gt; you know what Satan would tell me well sister Ruth don't want to be a part she don't want to help. She don't want this. Oh, you just on and on and on and on. &gt;&gt; You don't have to listen to that garbage. &gt;&gt; When he started telling me that, I should have just hung up the phone, connected to him. You see what I mean? Every one of you sitting here, if you're breathing, you've experienced that &gt;&gt; because you didn't know what God knew. &gt;&gt; Forgive me, Sister Ruth, for even Satan just allowing him to tell me that in my ear. &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying? What a And so because Satan would tell me that, then I would think, "Oh, Sister Roose pulling away or she's drawn." &gt;&gt; You know that's the truth. &gt;&gt; And you know that's happened to you too, &gt;&gt; 100%. Let's look at some things the prophet said. You could put these starting at this top one. Now these first few are connected to verse five, not verse eight. Verse five. But I tell you a very good thing to preach on is little children love one another. As I get older in the ministry, about my 21st year in the ministry, I think the time as I go along for this, the more that I think of the Lord Jesus, the more I begin to find out that it's love that covers the whole thing. The love of God is shed abroad in our heart by by the Holy Spirit. Not by the minister, not by your creeds or dogmas, not by the message, not by the seven seals, but by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Now, your prophet said these things. He said, "Look at a person's spirit." &gt;&gt; Yes. Look if he's trying to do what's right for God. God don't bring them. The message is the truth. I'm not I'm saying but look at the spirit. &gt;&gt; The message is God. But let God bring the people to God. &gt;&gt; Watch the next one connected to he said, "Brethren, we have withdraw little circles." Sister Ruth talked about this. Now, Sister Ruth, she texted me this morning at 6 something this morning. I got the text at 8:00. She don't know what I'm preaching. And and and not only that, I want I want to clarify because I want to give Satan a black eye. I didn't look for these quotes. I went to the message hub and they're related to verse six of Romans 8 or verse 5, sorry. So, I didn't even like cherrypick these. These are on the message hub. &gt;&gt; Directly to the scripture we read. We've drawn circles of laws and different things and we still never come to the real kernel. It's Jesus Christ. The love of God wants us to see. What a pity. Love is the greatest, most powerful weapon and this world has ever seen and known of. And it's dying for love. The church is perishing for love. Love. God, waters of grace are flowing one to another when confidence is restored and justice is restored between us. The love that God shed abroad in our hearts by the denomination. Something sounded wrong there, didn't it? It's the love of God shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; God is love to us. Still verse five connected to verse five the Hebrew series. Now the church cannot be perfect through organizations or the message any any kind of an organization even even in the message organization. The church cannot watch how because he deals with this &gt;&gt; in the next chapter. It gets further away from God all the time. Brother Brham said we read this last time in canones. He said, "If you believe that you got it and nobody else has got it that's on the outside, you're a denominational spirit &gt;&gt; cuz you build a wall around it. We've got the truth and they don't." &gt;&gt; That's what your prophet said. &gt;&gt; That's what your prophet said. Now, we know this is the truth, but don't say they don't have it. &gt;&gt; Cuz watch this. He said it gets away from God all the time or farther away from each other. We draw barriers and we separate oursel. This is talking about messaged people. Watch this. This this message is love that he's preaching. So if we were in the message church and say, "Well, we got to church and everybody else is going to hell." &gt;&gt; That that's not that's that's not what the prophet preached. &gt;&gt; We're the only ones that are going to be in heaven, the message believers. &gt;&gt; Everybody else is going to hell. That's not what the prophet preached. My daddy never came to this message church, but my daddy will be waiting for me at the pearly gates. &gt;&gt; I'll just tell you. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you don't think of that, I am in part next to the Lord Jesus is because of my daddy. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said we draw barriers and separate oursel seemingly not having the faith. Now we've done that with denominational but we've like sister brought up we've done it even inside the message &gt;&gt; seemingly not. But when we leave these principles of doctrines, what would most people separate in the message about the principle of doctrine? They say, "Well, bless God. The prophet said this is the doctrine of truth." When we leave these principles of doctrine and we move on into, wait a minute, he said when we move on into perfection, then these little things become not so much use. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's saying the principles of doctrines of the message that we would build separate camps when we get into love, when we get into the capstone love, &gt;&gt; they'll take a second seat. &gt;&gt; Cuz watch what he says in the next paragraph. For we go into a relationship and we find out that the only way that we can get to perfect perfect it is to be in Christ. And we find out that when by the teachings of the Bible and how we get into Christ, not by water baptism. Now wait a minute now. That's Bible. I believe in water baptism. &gt;&gt; I believe in but he says we don't come into the perfection of Christ by water baptism. Not on laying on of hands and watch this next one. And not by teaching the message. &gt;&gt; You do not come in perfection. You can memorize these messages. You can read books upside down 24 hours a day and memorize and know the quotes like um accordion book. &gt;&gt; That won't make you perfection. Is this okay? &gt;&gt; This this is our prophet. We believe he is the man of God. Not by teaching, but by one spirit are we all baptized into one body and become perfect through his suffering. And when we look at difference, we think different and we act different, we live different, not because it's our duty or we belong to a church, but because of love. God shed abroad the love into our hearts by the Holy Ghost and it makes us fellow citizens of the kingdom of God and there is no we have no problem with the denominational part but no barriers we have trouble with because we have barriers in the message &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; but when we get into love we have no barriers in that at all one great body. Now, if you're saying we're all one great body, then we you would never have the attitude that we got it right and they got it wrong. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Cuz the prophet's saying we both have it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Wow. Next quote here. the devil and sin sickness back in Abraham's race ran Abraham's race back into a corner and what and Jesus stepped out of heaven to go to earth God for he so loved the world and his love constrained him to do something and it projected a savior to come to earth and found through the found the the thickness of the spear which was death and plunged them into it and the day he descended up and sent back his holy ghost and said unto the church, take this and fight the best you can. You know what it was? There's the way the church has missed it today. The love of God that's shed abroad in the hearts of the Holy Ghost. Man's afraid to take that love. &gt;&gt; You'd rather take some manmade theology &gt;&gt; and try to fight with message quotes. You'll lose. Take what the leader Christ Jesus Jehovah God gave us. The love of God that constrained him. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Love. Who cares what your doctrine is? &gt;&gt; Love. This next one, I'm just going to paraphrase. He talks about he's on the mission field and his wife writes him a letter and he reads between the lines. He said, "You can't read this message like a newspaper. You can I can tell you right now, and you know this, I can get quotes on every side. You can get a quote one way. I can get three or four or half a dozen the other way. It's read between the lines." the the point the the point but he says here in this bottom one he said but fall in love with him get down to really get him in your heart the love of God that shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Ghost and no one else can read my this next paragraph no one else can read my wife's letter like that because I love her that way and that's the way she writes to me see that's the way God writes to you. It's between the lines. It's love. There is a purpose in the message law. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But God's talking to us between the lines. &gt;&gt; It's the spare. &gt;&gt; Don't lift the law above the minister. Don't lift the minister above God. The law above God. I mean, we've seen what they did to Stephen. &gt;&gt; Because Steven preached different than the law of Moses. They stoned a Holy Ghost-filled powerful believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. I got the these ones here are from verse eight, our texts. Watch how you know the prophet sends things. We're mis you know I I don't look for these. I'm just I mean God gave me the scripture and I want the message up. Watch how the prophet says to fight demons. And don't say get a big evangelist. Don't say even pray. He says buy a box of candy. He said when you come home buy her a box of candy and give it to her and come out at the door and put your arms around her and say that's the way you cast out devils. Love castes out fear, doesn't it? Love &gt;&gt; a box of candy. &gt;&gt; How in the world in a 61 quote &gt;&gt; could the me the prophet talk about love casting out demons? It's compassion. &gt;&gt; Remember the good Samaritan? &gt;&gt; Compassion was eternal life. love. He said, "Friends, the whole world is dying for love." That's one of the greatest things that we can leave out of the Pentecostal blessing too much is love mixes it all together. When the mortar that makes the gifts and all the things that God operated perfectly is love, one thing for another. &gt;&gt; This will all men know that you are my disciples by how they love &gt;&gt; love. This is going to be my last quote &gt;&gt; I believe and we're and it's a long one. It's directly connected to verse eight and it it just shares so much &gt;&gt; that we need to look at. And it was really what God laid on my heart is amazing how God just continued this good Samaritan compassion. &gt;&gt; We got to get this right because we're at the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I had another call and said a group said, "If you'll have another group sit on the platform with you, we'll not have nothing to do with your meetings." That's worse off than ever. What's the matter? They've gone off without Christ. The love of God in our hearts constrains us to preach to every denomination in every place. And when it gets to a spot that you can't have tender love for every human being, something has happened to you. &gt;&gt; I want to I want to share something. And this is not this is this is not about me. But you know Osman Bartley said something about he said camp meeting was different this year because I invited everybody. &gt;&gt; I told brother Garson and sister Linda I said every one of your kids are wide open invited. I don't even care if they come to the service. Just come and eat with me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; My neighbors across the road came to the service. brought me a great big thing of chocolate fudge. If I ate it all, it'd weigh a,000 lbs. My kids get into it and help me save my life. They eat my fudge. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Love. Don't even come and hear the message. Just come and feel love. &gt;&gt; Love. Don't they'll they'll come eventually. I believe in messages. &gt;&gt; Love. Sister was there from out of town. She hadn't sat in a service in 16 years &gt;&gt; where you used to attend the Chattam church with her. Love. &gt;&gt; Love. Just love. I don't even I don't want to know. Just love. &gt;&gt; We met yesterday, Ken and Rhonda, Lann's brother that was at camp and sang beautifully. &gt;&gt; I invited them to church. I said, "Come and sing worship with us." Yeah, &gt;&gt; we talked to the mayor yesterday and Rhonda mentioned again. She said, "Wow." She said, "I can come here and I don't feel no uh judge like no push back." &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Sister Patricia. Woo. &gt;&gt; Love. &gt;&gt; Love. You know, Osman Bartley is and now I'm doing what I told you not to do, but you know, we talked to them in our living room and she had a question about something that happened in the in the camp meeting and you know, we I watched Osman Bartley completely skirt the idea because it wasn't time. Love, see, love protects people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Don't kill people with the truth. &gt;&gt; Protect them. &gt;&gt; You don't tell your little kids, "We can't afford to pay the house rent this month and I don't know how I'm going to feed you." You hide that from them. &gt;&gt; Do you know the smartest man that ever lived that was sent home from school and he got a note from his teacher and he said, "Your kid is &gt;&gt; Don't ever send him to school again." And when the mother was reading the note, she was balling her face right off her head. And her son said, "Mommy, what is wrong with you?" And she said, "This note says that you are so brilliant that it would be frugalous for you to ever attend this classroom again because you are so far expelled in the classroom &gt;&gt; and he was a genius of the world." &gt;&gt; What was his name, honey? &gt;&gt; Thomas Edison. Sometimes, kids, plug your ears. Especially you, Silus. Sometimes, I'm going to tell you something off the If you're protecting somebody, sometimes it's okay to lie. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I said that. Do you know Abraham lied and taught his son Isaac to lie? And God sent the king to say, "If you don't get that liar to pray for you, I will kill you." Lie. Love. Love constrains. Say, "Daddy, what are we going to eat?" I don't know. If you don't, you know, I I can tell you another. You're looking at me like I just lost my mind. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, there was a story, this is a real story, &gt;&gt; where a daddy never had nothing to eat and he started a fire and he put a stone in the kettle and he's borrowing water with the stone and the kids sitting there thinking, "Daddy's cooking dinner." Church, that daddy was lying to his kids. They were sitting at the fire and we're waiting for the food to cook. And the end of that story is a man come by and gave him groceries and he could dump the stone out and put the food in. Protection is love. I want to share something with you. So this person that was at camp, it's going to shock you. She wasn't, she had no problem with the preaching of the word. But just a baby spiritually and she seen a husband I can't mean attack his wife and treat her less than a queen and because she had something in her it feathers and she said I don't like this parrot. You thought they would come in and not like the preaching of the word. That wasn't a problem. But she was watching our lives &gt;&gt; and she was watching how the brothers treated the sisters. And because she was coming from a sister world &gt;&gt; that's a dominating sister. when she seen a man and she asked Osman and he just went around the bush &gt;&gt; because it wasn't time &gt;&gt; because somebody gave a wrong spirit towards his wife &gt;&gt; and it was offending a baby and so he went around and skirted the issue. He didn't say, "Oh, bless God. We believe the h the head of the house and yeah, you know, the women come under the man." She would have just went, "I'll see you in about a hundred years." &gt;&gt; Love. Watch what our prophet says. When you get to the spot that you can't have tender love, that's the bottom line here. When you get to the spot that you can't have tender love to every human being, something's happened to you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it's not conversion. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm I'm closing on this quote. I just got go the next prayer. So God so loved us when you were yet sinners, an alien from God, the enemy, the commonwealth of God. He so loved you that he gave his life for you. Sure. And if you get the spirit in you, watch this. We're to have the nature of Christ. The Holy Spirit is God. It's a spirit. &gt;&gt; God's everywhere in the spirit form. &gt;&gt; He acts exactly the same. This this quote finishes something unbelievable. I I it's just just don't lose me. He beloved. He gave your life for sure. And if you get the spirit into you that you're better than someone else or you're worse than anybody then you're worse then you're worse than anybody else that I know of. Now you know I just if you get the spirit that you're better because you're sitting under the truth &gt;&gt; than somebody else then you're worse than anybody &gt;&gt; even though it's still the truth. &gt;&gt; Then you're worse than anybody else I know. I don't care if you if you're so correct in your message theology and your motives and objectives are wrong. I'd rather be wrong in my theology than wrong in my heart. That's right. The spirit of God dwells in our heart. I think I read this a week ago. In the Garden of Eden, let's watch this. In the Garden of Eden, God chose the heart and man chose the head. And he comes out with bitterness in his heart against his fellow citizens of the kingdom of God. That ain't God. See how we God is no respector of person. If somebody comes in and they look like different than us. I'm getting to this in this quote. I I got I got to just read this quote. Satan seen them go a far off here. He's talking about Satan when the disciples were in the boat and he he realized the disciples were away from Jesus and he said you get to the place when Oh, sorry. Maybe that's the next quote. &gt;&gt; Oh, sorry. No, that's that's right. Sorry. Satan, he's seen them go off without God. And so he said, "Let's get rid of them." This is a good old way to get rid of them. Oh, brother, when you get to the place that you can't reach across the fence. Now, what was Sister Ruth talking about in her testimony? When you can't reach across the fence and come across the street and associate or call a man, a man, even a man or a brother, and just because there might be some little hairs difference, By the way, I this was in my quote before Sister Ruth contacted me. There's a hair's different. How do you know that you're not a little different in God's sight? Some little something. And be a brother. Why certainly, brother, the altar is your place. That's exactly right. Get right with God. But we thought, well, we know we're right. I know the message is right. So anybody that don't know about the message that makes them the opposite. Don't go there. &gt;&gt; Just that's what he's tell us. Don't go there. He said I don't want that evil spirit on me. He said, "But oh brother, don't let even evil thing come on you men." No sir, brother, stick together like molasses in a con cold morning. Just really, really cling together as thick as can be. And you know, molasses, they it's really cold. He said, "Blessed be the ties that binds our heart and Christian love." Now, that was why I sang that song this morning. Blessed be the tithes that bind our heart in Christian love. Not in doctrine, in love. &gt;&gt; Amen. The fellowship of kindred hearts is like to that above. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're all right, Sister Dama. Don't worry about it. You ain't hurting anybody. That's the way we should be. Certainly not greedy, not selfish, not indifferent, and not ungodly. The fruits of the spirit are love, joy, longsuffering, meekness, gentleness, faith, patience, and that's all the fruit of the spirit. Now, watch. This is the one I want you to get to. You know, &gt;&gt; a tree if he's got is that sorghum? &gt;&gt; Sycamore. I'm sorry. I'm so If you got sycamore bark, now do you know what he's saying here? If you see a person as tight to a tree and if they look different than you think they should look I just that means if they don't have holiness &gt;&gt; and I believe in holiness now let me go to the other side. Let me go let's jump over on the other side of the fence. If you know holiness is right and you don't do it that's iniquity and you're sinning. &gt;&gt; That's the other side. But if somebody don't know about holiness and they come in and they're a sycamore tree and they look like an unholy person but they are now this how is this but and they are producing apples &gt;&gt; and the sycamore tree on the bark on it and apples are grown on it. What is it? It's an apple tree. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. No it ain't. It's an unholy Jezebel. No, it's an unholy sycamore tree. No, it ain't. What brother say? The spirit. Look at their spirit. &gt;&gt; They maybe haven't come to doctrine. &gt;&gt; And doctrine is right, but they maybe haven't got that far to doctrine, but they could have the spirit that produces apples and have an unholy body. Sycamore tree. Sycamore tree. Watch what he says. And the life of the tree produces apples. No matter what your theology is, right or wrong, if you're bearing the wrong kind of fruit, you're the wrong kind of tree, brother. Jesus said, "By your fruits you shall know them." It's not by how you look. &gt;&gt; And it's not by your doctrine. It's by your spirit. Now, now if you if you know the doctrine and you don't do it, then that's iniquity and you're sinning. So So I said, "I've been in the faith for years and years." But you see what I mean? If somebody walked in here and they don't know just whatever, you know where I'm going. They don't look like a holiness message believer. And we would immediately say, "Ah, you know who I bought my breakfast Friday morning? A Pentecostal." You know who helped Jared Combine Deans yesterday? A Pentecostal preacher. Do you know who's already already gave me the money to put through the church to buy his ticket to go to Jamaica and El Salvador? A Pentecostal preacher, Brother G. &gt;&gt; Maybe a sycamore tree, but he's producing apples. &gt;&gt; Don't get too caught up on this. You've heard me preach till you're so sick you'd quit coming here about badger skin. Don't get caught up too much with badger skin. &gt;&gt; Don't worship the skin. &gt;&gt; It will rot. &gt;&gt; Don't worship the bark. &gt;&gt; Worship the spirit. &gt;&gt; Worship the fruit. &gt;&gt; That's okay. Now, I just want to clarify something. Brother Dale's way too dumb to find that quote. I've never read it in my life. I've never heard it in my life. and it was connected to the eighth verse of the text we read Romans 8. That's how I found it. So I don't even try to preach this stuff and the Holy Spirit is smacking me on the back and now he saw them without Jesus the devil. this talking about they were in the boat and he began to blow poison and roll up a storm in the ship and whirl and all this and he said, "Wow, when you belong to my organization, you don't belong to anyone else." Anything. If you don't belong to my organization or you don't belong to anything, well, you're the one that's right and the rest are wrong. You've separated yourself. Wrong spirit. How come we have never heard this kind of message prophet? This is the third message I've preached on this thing and they're everywhere in the message. &gt;&gt; I go to message churches. If you're not a message believer, you're not going you're not going to be in heaven. You're not a part of the bar. You're not this. You're not that. You're not going in the rapture. You're not you don't got the spirit of Christ. You're you don't you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost because you got to have it under the true message of the thing. You you're not this. What prophet are they listening to? If you weren't birthed in a message church and you weren't baptized under the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is a correct baptism, by the way, and if you're not one of us, well, you're just lost. Watch what the next paragraph says. That's poison. Breath of Satan. &gt;&gt; Can you get any stronger than that? So, I've been listening to message preachers for 35 years, and they said, 'Well, if you weren't birthed in a message church, you won't go in the rapture. If you weren't birthed in a message church and you weren't baptized, Kirk Baptism, the thief on the cross, wasn't even baptized, by the way. He he completely missed. These things are right, but we've had the wrong spirit in a ministering them. You might as well just say, "Amen. Because brother Bram says if you if you think everybody else is you're right, everybody else is wrong, you separate that's a poison breath of Satan. That's what Sister Ruth was talking about in her testimony. It's a cancer. &gt;&gt; It's a cancer. And we need to learn love is God. Watch this. He said God will You know what, Chad? I loved what I shared with Chad Lamb. It was so amazing. It just blew my mind. He said, "If I'm wrong, trust God to correct my mind to get me where I'm supposed to be, but I'll have the right spirit." He said, "If you're separating, if your attitude is to separate because I'm right and everybody else is wrong, wrong spirit, thus sayith the prophet." And that's why I sent it out to everybody I could think of, which I left. I had never heard it so perfectly. Wrong spirit. Amen. It's a It's a spirit. It I I could be that wrong. I could be that wrong. You could be a They could all be right. But we don't have to separate. &gt;&gt; Trust God that eventually we'll get it right. &gt;&gt; I'm not intentionally wrong. I'm not even really even preaching this morning. &gt;&gt; I'm just showing you what the prophet preached. &gt;&gt; I could just point Yeah, &gt;&gt; but people don't there's people that don't want what the prophet preached. This is our third message preaching things that are very uncommon because we have a fleshly badger skin thing that I got it and you don't and I'm special and you're not and I'll be there and you won't. And he said, "That's the breath of Satan poison." I said this once before and it just comes to me again. In what world would a parent of the kids that you birth to have your blood want them to fail or not be in heaven? In what world? And God birthed you, but you don't want the other children to get in. That's none of your business. Love. Love. That's the breath of Satan. Don't have nothing to do with him. He don't believe like we do. There's only one message, faith. If you don't believe like I do, there's only one faith, and that's faith in God. That's right. Faith. Humble faith. Don't never get very far from it. But God's faith will make you love everybody. It'll make you love everybody. That's right. That's what God's faith does. See, it makes you have the same feeling that Jesus did. And we're closing on this one, so you can take a time out. It makes you have the same feeling that Jesus did because the spirit of Christ is in you. And God so loved the world. John 3:16 that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth. It didn't say look right. It didn't say act right. Didn't say live right. And I believe in all of those things. I really do. &gt;&gt; But our gospel in the Bible, he went to some very far out people in the word of God. &gt;&gt; And we're not going to reassess them. But you would have the same feeling as Jesus did because the spirit of Christ is in you. You know Christ never blocked out. He would that all &gt;&gt; would be saved. Now he's omnipotent and he knows the beginning from the end. And so he knew that some would reject him. But that same spirit went up and the mountain and weeped over Jerusalem and said, "I would have wooed you like a hen to put you under my wings, but you would not would not." Amen. We should rather than arguing and disagreeing and separating, why don't we weep? Why don't we weep for the separation in the message churches? Why don't we weep for the message separation of the gospel? Why don't we weep for the separation in the world? Weep. Because when the death angel went, he put a mark over them that had compassion inside and cried for the abominations committed on the earth. You know, if we weep for the people that don't see it like us, it would change everything. If we weep for the ones that haven't come to the revelation that God blessed you with, blessed are you saints, Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood did not reveal this unto you, but my father which was in heaven. If we would weep and say, Lord Jesus, would you please give them what you gave me? It'll first be love and then it'll be revelation that wow, you are an amazing God. Love. I'm not I'm not God's not talking about this filio garbage that you you know what I mean? &gt;&gt; We can't buy our friends. Brother Brown talked about that. We can't buy people to come to church and serve God. But you can be kind. Just kind the good Samaritan. What must I do to have eternal life? We need to ask that question more than what must I do to belong to a message church? What must I do to have eternal life? and a pagan by religion, Samaritan, a half breed, had eternal life. When the believers of the day, the priests and the Levites, let's say another way. Can I say it another way? Is that all right? I I'm going to shut up. &gt;&gt; The pastors and the evangelists &gt;&gt; never had it. They never had it because they couldn't. They went away. They went around. They just let him die. I know he left the church. Just let him die. Ain't got nothing to do with me. They didn't like my preaching. Just let him die. Let him lay there. &gt;&gt; Oh, love. I challenge you to look at this quote. It's on the message hub, the eth verse. And look at the sycamore tree producing apples. And the prophet said, "God will judge your spirit. You might not have everything right in life, but if you have the spirit of Christ, you'll be there. You will be. That will be number one. Number one. Let's stand. I believe that churches around the world have missed that by a million miles. That's just my own personal opinion. And a lot of it has to do with lifting up really good people. Really, they're good people. They're amazing people. But it's not about that. You know, I I pray if if I happen if God I pray I don't I pray the rapture happens or I I die before Lan. But if I happen to be an old man, I don't want you to post on the internet that Dale was a great person. Just say that God was a great God. You know what I mean? The Bible says that our holiness is as filthy rags. And there's none holy by God. So when we have a great big person die, we post all these great things. But it's taken away from a great God. It's a great God. Amen. [Music] Amen. [Music] Amen. [Music] Amen. It's just uh you just have to believe that that was God that gave that to me. It couldn't have lined up more perfect with Sister Ruth's testimony. That could not have been possible. [Music] Amen. [Music] What is that? Change my heart, oh God. Make it ever true. Change my heart again. May I [Music] [Applause] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Jesus. [Applause] [Music] Let's sing that song. He's got it all in control. You know, I want to just sing this song to me when we're here. You know, you can't make people want to be around you. You can't dictate what somebody else believes in their life. &gt;&gt; And if somebody chooses to separate, you can't dictate that. That's their choice. &gt;&gt; But you can do this. You can build an environment &gt;&gt; because you're a God. You can build an environment around you that is so magnetic that people will fly to be fighting because of love. &gt;&gt; People will stop cars and stop airplanes &gt;&gt; and create roadblocks because the love of Christ and kindness and compassion. I'm not saying this cheap stuff. I'm saying genuine love that it will change those people to say, "Hey, you know what? I don't see what, but there's something about them. I just like being around just a race. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. I just like I'm going by, you know, I I this come to me. I'm going to share this with you." You know, Brother Bram tells a story and he was sharing it to a brother, it's a minister that's died and he was telling them of a family in the church and all the things that were wrong with them in confidence in the vehicle and they were on a long drive. You know the amount of miles that Perry drove, it was actually Perry Green. He was sharing it to him and they came within like a huge an hour of their house or something. Brother Brown said, "You know what? We need to go by their house." And Perry just said, "Huh? Huh? What? You just spent you told me all these. And you know what? Brother Ram looked at him and he said, "Oh, I'm so disappointed in you. I thought you knew love." Brother Bram seen their faults, but he loved them so much that he would go, I a huge distance of he said, I just I thought you had been introduced to love. I thought you knew love because somebody don't love you. You can still take them flowers, ch you don't even have to deliver them. You can actually have people pay people to do it. It'll improve the economy. Love love. And he looked at him and he said, "Oh, I'm so disappointed. You didn't just because I told you they're ours. I'm still going to go buy their house. I'm not avoiding them. I love them." Amen. He's got it all in control. Oh, he's got it all in control. He put that reassurance way down in my soul. He's got it all in control. I put my life in his hands. I put my life in his hands. hand. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] for me. My father knows what I need. He's got it all in control. He's got it all in control way down in my soul. God bless you.
