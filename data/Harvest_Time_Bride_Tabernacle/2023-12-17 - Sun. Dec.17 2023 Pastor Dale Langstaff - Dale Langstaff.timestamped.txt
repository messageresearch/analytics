[28:08] the Bible says we'll be peculiar I said
[28:10] you know I had the thought in my mind I
[28:12] shared it with the church after I said
[28:13] you know I could have told them that we
[28:15] had Fellowship together before the
[28:16] foundation of the world that before God
[28:19] spoke us we were all fellowship and
[28:22] having a great time together how in the

[28:28] Earthly face but I remember their
[28:29] Heavenly
[28:31] face amen it's just amazing amen and
[28:34] that's just how the whole weekend was
[28:36] we're just going to show you I think
[28:38] there's about 10 pictures maybe this is
[28:41] a picture of every pastor we preach for
[28:45] except one one is not here one wasn't
[28:47] here the night we took these pictures
[28:49] the picture on uh the the the brother
[28:52] the pastor on the far right was my
[28:55] interpreter so he was from
[28:59] Nicaragua so we didn't preach in his
[29:01] church um and then the preacher in the
[29:04] dad Center in the white shirt was
[29:08] from Gualala and they were the two
[29:12] brothers that begged us to go there the
[29:15] next time or tremendously asked us to he
[29:18] actually got some of the pastors
[29:20] together before we left and said you
[29:22] must come next time to Guatemala from
[29:26] here amen but all the other ministers
[29:28] there we we pastor preached for we
[29:31] preached in four churches
[29:33] um and it was really beautiful you know
[29:37] almost all but one a little bit uh no
[29:40] matter which church we were in everybody
[29:42] come almost without fail other than one
[29:46] church was a little bit more reserved so
[29:48] this is the first pastor we preach for
[29:51] this is up in a volcano the whole
[29:53] country is mountains this is an old
[29:55] volcano where it blew the top out of the
[29:57] mountain mountain and now there is a
[29:58] sulfur
[29:59] Lake and we went there we preached there
[30:02] we got there late late Tuesday we got
[30:04] there 2 3:00 we got in our bedroom
[30:06] probably 4:30 in the morning and and uh
[30:11] we preached for him Wednesday night and
[30:13] you know something I just you can turn
[30:15] to the next picture Vicki when we got
[30:17] there late late in the morning the
[30:19] pastor had woke up to come and pick us
[30:20] up because Jose stayed with his family
[30:23] in another C or another town his brother
[30:26] had brought him and the pastor and his
[30:28] wife no we've never seen them before
[30:32] we've never spoken to them they gave us
[30:34] their master bedroom with an attached
[30:36] bed bathroom with air conditioner and
[30:39] they slept in a house that wasn't
[30:40] finished for one week that we were there
[30:44] when we left their little girl was
[30:46] talking to their dad in Spanish and he
[30:48] said why are these English people
[30:49] leaving he said Dad can't you just give
[30:51] them the
[30:52] house can't you just give them the house
[30:54] so oh we missed so just go back back to
[30:57] the other Church um sorry just back one
[31:00] so that was the first church we preached
[31:01] on a Wednesday night um most every
[31:05] service had probably between 150 and 250
[31:09] people like this so Wednesday night
[31:11] there was 150 people there amen so we
[31:14] could go to the next one and also
[31:17] another thing that happened after every
[31:20] service they fed everybody
[31:23] outside everybody so this is the pastor
[31:26] that uh is actually ping the church that
[31:29] Pastor Jose started in El Salvador um
[31:33] and this was where the the reunion was
[31:36] and the convention and that little girl
[31:37] was the one that asked her dad if he
[31:40] couldn't just give us the house we could
[31:42] just stay with them amen and this was a
[31:45] lookout mountain so we can go the next
[31:47] service so this is me coming up to
[31:49] preach in the front of his church he's
[31:52] just turning it over to us and we go to
[31:57] the next one
[31:59] there it's just a couple pictures of the
[32:02] Believers they would pack them in there
[32:05] you know it was 100
[32:06] degrees 100 degrees every day the
[32:08] hottest we' seen on the van thermostat
[32:10] was
[32:11] 102 102 it was just
[32:14] roasting and we actually almost lost our
[32:17] voice because matter of fact The
[32:18] Interpreter completely lost his voice
[32:21] because the air was so hot when we come
[32:22] out of the airport it hit you like a
[32:25] cement truck it looked like you'd
[32:26] stepped over front of a train it was
[32:27] just I mean literally it was just like
[32:30] they opened those double doors
[32:32] and was
[32:34] like
[32:35] bre it was very hot very very hot there
[32:40] this is uh this this still the second
[32:43] Church they actually catered the meal in

[33:06] Us on that same mountain in the lake we

[33:25] seven eight kids seven kids seven kidss
[33:28] five girls all my girls age they were
[33:31] just a blast and a couple of these
[33:34] people we had to almost carry out on
[33:36] this is a glass platform so their mother
[33:39] had never been on it their son actually
[33:41] went and
[33:43] physically um nicely brought her out
[33:47] with her eyes closed in
[33:49] fear uh but every road is kirked and
[33:53] every road is is like everywhere you
[33:56] look is just just mountains as far as
[33:57] the I can see because there's mountains
[34:00] higher than other mountains and so this
[34:02] was uh this is pretty much all one
[34:04] family except maybe the brother sitting
[34:06] in the middle there in front of
[34:08] me and uh we just it was just an amazing
[34:12] time like literally we went to this
[34:14] Lookout on Saturday and we left on
[34:16] Monday they had already made coffee cups
[34:18] with the picture on it is us as part of
[34:21] the family we are their family yeah so
[34:25] uh just a tremendous
[34:27] tremendous Love Actually the daughter
[34:29] there on the uh on my side the daughter
[34:32] was the daughter of the pastor that had
[34:34] just died former Pastor that had just
[34:38] died uh very uh previous like couple
[34:41] years during Co or something I don't
[34:44] think it was CO as much as I think he
[34:47] had had U I think he had lung issues he
[34:51] had always had lung issues that and that
[34:53] I tell you this this is encouragement
[34:55] every single one of the p pastor's
[34:57] family are still in that church they
[34:59] have a new pastor but the sons are the
[35:01] song leaders Wednesday and Sunday
[35:04] morning there's two sons they they
[35:05] rotate and the kids are there the mom's
[35:08] there everybody's there they didn't HIC
[35:10] up nothing amen that was beautiful this
[35:14] is their
[35:16] church and just an amazing time this
[35:19] brother here you see with the the not
[35:22] too much hair they took us out to a
[35:24] fancy fancy restaurant and and his son
[35:27] and actually I'm I'm wearing his son's
[35:32] tie his wife gave Lan a blow or dress or
[35:36] something
[35:37] and but the one day it wasn't even the
[35:41] last day we seen them the one day they
[35:44] came to say
[35:45] goodbye and it took like a half an hour
[35:49] he would say goodbye and give me a hug
[35:51] and we talk he give me another hug say
[35:53] goodbye and another hug say goodbye
[35:57] and that's just the way it was it's just
[36:00] the way even the pastor of the second
[36:01] church he came and took a family picture
[36:04] and he said Dale I'm not good on Gabby
[36:10] just like many of the People sisters
[36:13] included when they would say final
[36:15] goodbye they would be almost to
[36:18] tears when that
[36:22] true so we preached here on uh brother
[36:25] Jose preached here on Wednesday we
[36:26] preach on the following
[36:28] Friday and uh and I think there's
[36:31] another
[36:32] picture back is that it that's it okay
[36:35] amen amen let's stand and we'll just
[36:37] look in our scriptures and thank you
[36:40] girls and you know we'll we'll talk
[36:42] about our trip more but it was amazing
[36:44] and and they loved the word of God and
[36:46] and we're all part of the family and we
[36:49] all came from him we spoke on a lot of
[36:50] the Mysteries and and we had a really
[36:53] good time it was uh it was a challenge
[36:55] to uh you know know when you're
[36:57] ministering wonderful things it's easy
[36:59] to get excited but it's very hard for
[37:02] The Interpreter one time I ran down the
[37:05] alley way and you know we were talking
[37:06] about we're Christ and different The
[37:09] Interpreter he's
[37:10] just lost I mean amen I told the
[37:14] congregation I said man I sure wish I
[37:16] could preach in Spanish I could really
[37:18] Let Her Fly but uh
[37:22] amen let's turn to Revelations
[37:25] 10:7 and we'll just uh look into our
[37:28] thought
[37:31] here it is wonderful to be home and it
[37:35] was probably the biggest thing I missed
[37:37] I didn't miss the cold but I did miss a
[37:40] hot
[37:41] shower even though it's extremely hot
[37:44] there you shower the temperature it
[37:46] comes out of the
[37:48] tap and so it's not a long shower it's
[37:53] not
[37:54] enjoyable although it is refreshing
[37:59] so but in the days of the voice of the
[38:02] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[38:04] sound the mysteries of God shall be
[38:07] finished as he has declared it to his
[38:10] servants the prophets Lord Jesus you
[38:13] know what you've laid on my heart this
[38:15] morning and Lord we pray that you we can
[38:17] convey this thought you can convey this
[38:19] thought through your servant to your
[38:22] people Lord Jesus and Lord I pray that
[38:24] you'll change me to Perfection Lord
[38:27] Jesus and change us all into the image
[38:30] that you've seen Lord Jesus before the
[38:33] foundation of the world and we give you
[38:35] the glory and the praise for it we pray
[38:37] again to bless the people Lord Jesus
[38:40] it's good to be home and we just thank
[38:43] you for this great opportunity to
[38:45] minister your word your name we pray
[38:47] amen amen you may have your seats this
[38:49] morning we want to look in one of the
[38:52] Mysteries you know we believe that the
[38:54] Mysteries are unfolded and the Bible
[38:56] became a new book and and we could read
[38:58] between the letters you know our Prophet
[39:00] said that that uh you couldn't study
[39:03] Revelation although study is good and
[39:06] you couldn't even take uh I turned it on
[39:08] I thought I did uh or you couldn't even
[39:11] learn uh Revelation by going back to the
[39:14] uh Greek although that is good too and
[39:17] we do that too we do both but the
[39:20] greatest ability is when Christ reveals
[39:24] the the the scriptures and drops it down
[39:26] amen what he did in this day to
[39:28] ourselves I changed it either way so uh
[39:31] we just uh uh and that's what we have in
[39:35] our day the Bible's became a brand new
[39:38] book and the Bible every letter and
[39:40] every line the doveet tales and we know
[39:43] that every letter in the Bible is the
[39:44] seed of God and and literally before we
[39:47] get out of here we become his his wife
[39:49] and we will be impregnated with the word
[39:53] before we go to the to the the marriage
[39:55] supper amen and that's the state we have
[39:57] to be in you know the the prophet taught
[39:59] us this he talked about the three room
[40:01] Tabernacle and he saidou know the outer
[40:03] courts was for the unbeliever and the
[40:05] inner courts was the makeb believer and
[40:08] he said until you go into the holy of
[40:10] holies you're not even a Christian
[40:12] yet but when you go into the holy of
[40:15] holies and that Veil drops between
[40:16] behind you and it's you and Jehovah God
[40:20] and you have Fellowship together amen
[40:22] you'll never come out of that place to S
[40:24] amen you'll walk different you'll talk
[40:27] different you'll look
[40:29] different
[40:31] amen everything about you'll be
[40:33] different and we we want to look into
[40:35] Amazing Grace through forgiveness and we
[40:37] see this here in Genesis 4813 to or
[40:41] 13-19 and we see here that Joseph brings
[40:44] his his sons to be blessed before Jacob
[40:47] dies and we're gonna preach fast because
[40:50] I just want you to catch the thought and
[40:53] you know Joseph was a type of Jesus and
[40:57] and and he typed everything in the
[40:58] natural to Jesus a perfect type he was
[41:01] sold into slavery he was left for dead
[41:03] he was disowned by his own Brotherhood
[41:06] and all these types was here's Jesus In
[41:09] the Flesh and we'll see in the mysteries
[41:11] of the Bible that Christ always shows
[41:14] himself multiple times he'll show us
[41:17] here in Genesis here and all the way
[41:19] through the Bible and he shows us and
[41:21] when we get to the end in Revelations
[41:23] you're never going to have an excuse
[41:25] that I never seen you because he shows
[41:27] you in Genesis he shows you in numbers
[41:30] he shows you in Exodus and it's here and
[41:32] here and here and here and you can just
[41:34] go through the scriptures and it's Jesus
[41:37] Jesus Jesus Jesus hallelujah amen and we
[41:41] see here Joseph being a perfect type he
[41:45] was still a
[41:47] human and he had a concept of what God
[41:49] would work like and that's what gets in
[41:52] our way all the time is we have a
[41:55] perception of what this service will be
[41:58] or that I was telling brother Carson
[41:59] come over the other day and I said one
[42:01] of the most amazing things with the
[42:02] ministry is I don't have a clue what
[42:04] it'll be like when I start I don't have
[42:06] a clue what the service is going to be
[42:08] like cuz I ain't the service God is I
[42:11] don't know how God will be amen that's
[42:14] that's the greatest mystery amen but
[42:17] here Joseph he's bringing his sons and
[42:19] he bringing his Elder son and his
[42:20] youngest son and he had an
[42:22] agenda because he knew how God should
[42:25] work
[42:27] Hallelujah God helped me and God help
[42:30] you not to be like that the prophet said
[42:33] the greatest gift of all was surrender
[42:37] just just let God be God and you be his
[42:40] children amen amen you know a little
[42:43] child well maybe he does but you know a
[42:45] little child you know he just lets the
[42:47] parents be the parents and they're the
[42:49] children especially if they're very
[42:52] young amen and we see here that Joseph
[42:56] brought the older son that he would be
[42:59] on the side of Jacob's right hand and
[43:02] for the blessing that was the greatest
[43:04] blessing is these are all types the old
[43:06] testament's types types and shadows of
[43:08] Grace amen and he brought the younger
[43:11] son and he would be on Jacob's left hand
[43:14] and he would get a secondary blessing
[43:16] and our Prophet I'm going to look slow
[43:18] down and read some quotes but you know
[43:21] Jacob said Jacob when he prayed he
[43:23] crossed his hands and Joseph lost his
[43:28] mind when he's seen what God had done
[43:31] and he said father father no no you've
[43:34] made a
[43:35] mistake and Jacob answered Joseph and he
[43:38] said
[43:40] God there some of us needs to hear that
[43:42] this morning
[43:45] God made me do
[43:47] it there's some things that God will
[43:50] make you do you won't have no saying
[43:53] amen he'll just he'll just make you know
[43:56] the cross in the arms type Calvary and
[43:58] the prophet mentions that about it was a
[44:00] cross of the calvary was amazing grace
[44:03] to the Gentile
[44:04] bride and the Jew and it took the
[44:07] Gentiles from the law the curse of the
[44:09] law he gives the scriptures in Galatians
[44:12] forward he took the the the curse of the
[44:15] Gentiles and see that how that perfect
[44:17] type was Joseph came to his own and his
[44:20] brothers rejected him and Jesus came to
[44:23] his own and they and and the Jews
[44:26] rejected him and Jesus crossed his arms
[44:29] and he grafted Us in to be his his bride
[44:34] amazing grace Amazing Grace but we we
[44:38] want to we want we don't want to let go
[44:40] of how Joseph
[44:43] rejected that
[44:45] Grace he had a thought how it would be
[44:50] amen and he rejected that here here the
[44:53] prophet says in the revelation of Jesus
[44:55] Christ that Joseph
[44:56] by by type the the marriage of the
[44:59] Gentile
[45:02] bride
[45:08] amen just want to find the one I want
[45:14] here he changed the birth right to us
[45:17] the younger son because the younger son
[45:20] typed the Gentile bride you you see the
[45:22] types of Joseph all the way through see
[45:24] Jesus came to his own and they refused
[45:26] him and he took us a gentile wife Joseph
[45:30] came to his own and his Brethren refused
[45:32] him and he also took a gentile wife amen
[45:37] moved to sold in slavery went to another
[45:39] country took a gentile wife had two sons
[45:42] amen that God raised up and it was just
[45:45] beautiful how these things uh I just
[45:49] seeing what our Prophet said here he
[45:51] mentions this multiple
[45:54] times Christ redeemed us from the curse
[45:57] we want to look into this maybe we can
[45:58] pull this scripture up uh Galatians 3:13
[46:02] now 13- 14 and Christ redeemed us from
[46:04] the curse of the law being made a curse
[46:07] for us because we were Gentiles as for
[46:10] it is written cursed is every man that
[46:12] hangs on a tree but blessed that The
[46:15] Blessing of Abraham might come on the
[46:18] Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we
[46:21] might receive the promise of the spirit
[46:24] through faith and that was all based on
[46:26] Jacob Crossing his arms to the two sons
[46:29] amazing grace Amazing Grace and we want
[46:32] to look at all these examples of grace
[46:36] through forgiveness here we look at
[46:37] Exodus we're going to fast forward you
[46:39] maybe pull this up Amy Exodus 13 21 and
[46:42] 22 and we see here Israel coming out of
[46:45] Egypt another case of Amazing Grace and
[46:49] we see you know that that in the day of
[46:52] the seventh angel when when he has come
[46:54] down the m mysteries of God are finished
[46:58] and we're going to look at how he came
[47:00] down all the way through the scriptures
[47:03] and almost every multiple times he came
[47:05] different ways but multiple times when
[47:08] he came down he came in the
[47:11] cloud he came in the body of the cloud
[47:14] and that's what we're going to look at
[47:15] today in the body of the cloud and here
[47:18] Exodus 13 we know when the children of
[47:20] Israel come out he said the Lord went
[47:22] before them in the pillar of the cloud
[47:25] by day
[47:26] and here the prophet mentions this she
[47:28] said you know you want to see what the
[47:30] power of God was like in that cloud
[47:32] think of Israel he said every doctor
[47:35] that's alive today would like to look
[47:36] into Moses uh Hospital book Hospital
[47:39] book How The Children of Israel when
[47:41] that cloud was before them before day
[47:44] they could never need a pair of clothes
[47:47] there was no clothing stores the shoe
[47:49] stores all went broke because the Sho
[47:52] mans weren't needed it was the
[47:55] atmosphere around them you know our
[47:57] Prophet said that if you had one Speck
[47:59] of Jehovah that's not a whole lot if you
[48:03] have one spec of Jehovah you have enough
[48:05] power in you to speak a world and go
[48:08] live on
[48:09] it amen that's everyone here that's got
[48:13] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you
[48:15] say brother Dale that's a bit of a Str
[48:17] that's not a stretch at all you can
[48:18] build a world around you an environment
[48:21] amen you you look at you know we we are
[48:24] so
[48:31] we have to be so careful you know we
[48:34] think sometimes we're so hard done by
[48:37] you know I I and I I'm not lifting them
[48:39] up I'm just showing you where we're at
[48:42] Al Salvador where we were the average
[48:44] income was $112 a day that's was 410 a
[48:48] liter a gallon us when I preached on
[48:52] Friday night there was single sisters
[48:54] that came with her husbands that drove
[48:55] two hours one way Friday night guys is
[48:59] 410 a liter and she made 12 bucks that
[49:03] day you think you had a hard economy you
[49:07] need to look
[49:09] around and you I'm not just that they
[49:12] 80% of Al Salvador goes to the states to
[49:15] work and so if they buy if the young
[49:17] people in the house go to buy a house
[49:19] it's
[49:19] 100,000 US dollar making 12 bucks a day
[49:23] try to figure that out in the bank
[49:24] you're going to have to they have a
[49:25] mighty sharp
[49:28] pencil you know we never had a single
[49:30] person beg us for a dime when we were
[49:32] there and they all gave us gifts and
[49:34] Gifts of money and service and sent us
[49:37] presents home and fed
[49:41] us and we think oh the economy changed
[49:47] here uhhuh you know wherever your heart
[49:50] is your treasure will be amen wherever
[49:53] your heart is they they wouldn't think
[49:55] you know you know was something that was
[49:57] different there you know and and it took
[50:00] some getting used to I'll have to admit
[50:01] because it was extremely hot extremely
[50:04] hot none of the churches were air
[50:05] conditioned they sat the time of the
[50:07] church when you're supposed to come and
[50:08] pray and read your Bible so we came to
[50:11] church sat for 30 40 minutes before the
[50:13] song play even come up I
[50:17] had sweat running down every part of my
[50:20] body I thought the service should be
[50:22] closed and it hadn't even got warmed up
[50:24] yet
[50:31] amen see we we got blind we think oh oh
[50:35] god oh I going to make
[50:37] it
[50:42] God
[50:44] yeah but with the presence of God all
[50:47] things are possible here in Moses day
[50:50] when the cloud came down and led the
[50:53] children of Israel he he said I am am
[50:55] the Lord that Health thy diseases the
[50:59] our Prophet your Prophet said this he
[51:00] said can you imagine in two million
[51:02] people how many babies were
[51:04] born they didn't build a
[51:10] hospital and you think God can't heal
[51:13] you you think God can't give you a
[51:18] baby you think God can't give you new
[51:21] shoes you don't think God can give you a
[51:23] brother that'll give you a tie that it's
[51:27] making tell you it's a humbling
[51:29] experience when people come up with
[51:32] poverty and start giving you
[51:35] gifts you feel like
[51:38] hiding when you know what they're going
[51:40] through to give you
[51:42] that uhhuh uhuh God help us amen amen
[51:48] it's all about Christ
[51:51] amen amen you we know the story when the
[51:54] Israelite when they they went across the
[51:56] desert not one feeble among them that
[51:58] you know the had the oh no not all of
[52:00] them were Israel not all of them went in
[52:03] of course not you know there was make
[52:05] Believers in their group but it was the
[52:07] same Jehovah God that was in their
[52:09] presence he took care of everything they
[52:11] needed and he's taking care of the Bride
[52:13] around the world everything they need
[52:16] amen amazing time when the cloud came
[52:20] down and they never had no sick no baby
[52:25] problem

[52:28] problems no leadership problems no
[52:32] weather problems no grocery store
[52:34] problems nobody got heartburn on the
[52:36] Heavenly
[52:38] Mana amazing amazing and we have the
[52:42] same thing here today if we just
[52:44] surrender to it amen amen this exact
[52:47] same Cloud came down in our day amen we
[52:50] see in in Elijah's day when when uh he
[52:53] had cursed the rain and the do and and
[52:57] all these things in the the time of
[52:59] Jezebel and and the the wicked
[53:02] King amen and he had said he told the
[53:05] king he went to the king and he said now
[53:07] it's going to
[53:09] rain amen and then he went and asked God
[53:13] to Make It
[53:14] Rain I I you know I've preached this
[53:16] before you know when you come into
[53:19] Christ and you have the baptism of the
[53:21] Holy Ghost you are Christ
[53:24] today
[53:26] that's that's a direct quote from the
[53:28] prophet the exact same kind of Glory
[53:30] that came out of God he said today we
[53:33] call it our
[53:34] theophany our theophany and the logos
[53:37] are exactly the same exactly the same he
[53:41] said we call it AR theophany today but
[53:43] the Loos of God there's just some things
[53:45] you don't have to begag
[53:48] for
[53:50] amen God said to Moses why cry unto me
[53:54] just speak and go forward amen and so
[53:58] here here here Elijah had so much faith
[54:02] that he goes and tells the king well he
[54:04] tells them first it's not going to rain
[54:05] they won't even be due God feeds him in
[54:07] the the brook with the Ravens and then
[54:09] he goes back to the king and he said
[54:11] it's going to rain
[54:13] tomorrow he didn't know it was going to
[54:16] rain you say God show no no the Bible
[54:19] says that he went to pray and he said he
[54:21] prayed and he put his legs between his
[54:24] knees that's exactly the how the Bible
[54:27] says he said he put his head between his
[54:28] knees and he had a servant and I love
[54:30] this part how it dub tals he sent the
[54:33] servant out to see if God was send in
[54:35] the rain how many
[54:37] times seven one for every Church age he
[54:41] sent a out for every Church age to see
[54:43] if God was coming down in the
[54:45] cloud every time but then in the seventh
[54:49] day he seen a little tiny cloud of God
[54:52] coming down about the size of a half
[54:56] and you'll see every time in the
[54:57] scriptures when it talked about the arm
[54:59] when Christ SATs at the right arm of the
[55:01] father it was always Authority and power
[55:04] wasn't two people it was a
[55:08] position it was Authority and power and
[55:10] we see the right hand of Christ coming
[55:13] down and the cloud representing the Hand
[55:17] five-fold
[55:19] Ministry the five forward Ministry was
[55:22] Grace to the people on that word
[55:25] which was a cloud that brought physical
[55:27] rain which is the type of the baptism of
[55:29] the Holy
[55:30] Ghost amen ain't that amazing and Christ
[55:34] hid all this from the wise and prudent
[55:38] and revealed it onto his little wife the
[55:41] hidden secrets that you could read
[55:43] between the
[55:44] lines amen amazing amazing
[55:49] grace through forgiveness here we see
[55:53] Solomon after David died died and
[55:56] Solomon builds the
[55:58] temple amen and he's dedicating the
[56:02] temple and he comes down in First Kings
[56:05] 810 and 11 and what comes down in the
[56:08] Tabernacle when he's dedicating the
[56:10] Tabernacle and the thing and this is
[56:12] before the perfect sacrifice had come
[56:15] Christ hadn't been born yet amen this
[56:19] was the power was the sacrifice of lambs
[56:23] and goats
[56:26] a type of the perfect sacrifice that was
[56:29] coming and the Bible says that the cloud
[56:32] came in the
[56:34] Tabernacle and the presence and the
[56:36] power of the cloud was so powerful that
[56:40] the
[56:41] priest couldn't
[56:44] stand and
[56:46] Minister I would to God that happen
[56:48] every place I
[56:50] go that the presence and the power of
[56:53] God and the wow that it would just be a
[56:56] fog around I tell you what when you come
[56:58] into that holy holies you're not you
[57:00] don't know that anybody else exists but
[57:03] God
[57:05] Amen
[57:07] oh we we we have to get there we must
[57:12] get there to go in a
[57:14] Rapture our Prophet compared the
[57:16] Tabernacle to the three room house
[57:18] compared it 14 times to a three room
[57:20] house and he said when when you have
[57:23] your kitchen you're in your cour ship
[57:25] stage when you're of your living room
[57:28] you're in your fiance State engaged
[57:30] state but when you go into the bedroom
[57:33] that's where life happens he said until
[57:36] the bedroom you're not even
[57:39] converted because there's not a true
[57:42] relation there's no commitment there's
[57:43] no relation long term man the same as 14
[57:46] times he compared that three room house
[57:49] to the Tabernacle in the
[57:51] wilderness amazing amazing power all
[57:55] these times that the cloud came down was
[57:59] Grace and we want to look at how amazing
[58:02] grace through forgiveness you know it
[58:05] wasn't
[58:07] easy Christ came himself to pay the
[58:10] price you want to look at another
[58:12] example of Amazing Grace look at the New
[58:15] Testament Luke 22 and Mark 14 we'll look
[58:18] at 2241 and 44 and I'm going to read
[58:21] this here's
[58:23] Jesus Jehovah
[58:26] down to pay the price for my sins God
[58:29] himself come to die on the cross
[58:33] amen but in the flesh he didn't want to
[58:37] die we're not born to die I mean we're
[58:40] born to die but we're we're born that we
[58:42] don't want to die everything that's
[58:44] alive will fight to
[58:48] live everything that's breathing will
[58:51] fight to live and here Jesus comes
[58:58] and he prays in verse
[59:00] uh let's look L Luke 22:41 he says and
[59:04] he was withdraw from the disciples about
[59:07] a stonecast and he kneeled down and he
[59:09] prayed and he said father if thou were
[59:11] willing remove this cup from me but
[59:13] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[59:16] done you know what that
[59:18] was amazing
[59:20] grace that was amazing grace that was a
[59:23] choice
[59:25] that was a choice the Bible says that he
[59:28] could have called 10
[59:30] Legions of
[59:32] angels to
[59:34] destroy me and set him
[59:38] free it was a CH and God's gave every
[59:42] one of us a choice even though we came
[59:44] from him you still have to die out in
[59:47] this flesh amen and here in 43 it says
[59:51] and there appeared an angel unto him
[59:53] from heaven and strengthen him and 44
[59:56] and it being in agony him being in agony
[59:59] prayed more earnestly the second time
[1:00:02] and it was as sweat drops of blood
[1:00:05] falling to the
[1:00:07] ground
[1:00:10] amen Amazing Grace by a
[1:00:14] choice the Christ would have to pay the
[1:00:17] ultimate sacrifice because see this was
[1:00:19] God's law that because of sin in the
[1:00:23] garden death had to come it was only the
[1:00:26] blood that would pay the price amen we
[1:00:29] see we see this in
[1:00:31] Mark also Mark 14 and 39 and I want to
[1:00:35] read this also just to to uh show you
[1:00:38] how it it's said different and both
[1:00:40] places he he prayed twice and he and he
[1:00:43] went a little farther from the disciples
[1:00:45] and fell on the ground and prayed that
[1:00:47] if it were possible that the hour might
[1:00:50] pass from him that was the first time of
[1:00:54] Grace a decision Mark
[1:00:57] 14:35 amen this was a process that Jesus
[1:01:01] was working into that he was given his
[1:01:04] life he knew he was born for that but it
[1:01:07] was still a
[1:01:08] decision and 36 and he said Abba Father
[1:01:13] all things are possible unto thee take
[1:01:15] away this cup from
[1:01:18] me that's pretty
[1:01:21] plain but
[1:01:23] nevertheless
[1:01:24] not what I will but what thou Wilt
[1:01:28] that's the second time Jesus prayed
[1:01:31] Amazing Grace it was amazing grace for
[1:01:35] us man it was amazing grace for the
[1:01:37] whole world the sadly the world won't
[1:01:40] accept
[1:01:41] it most of the world won't accept
[1:01:45] it the disciples were sleeping in verse
[1:01:48] 37 and a
[1:01:51] 38 he said watch ye therefore and pray
[1:01:55] now this is Jesus commission to you and
[1:01:59] verse 38 say watch ye there and pray
[1:02:02] lest you enter
[1:02:04] into
[1:02:06] temptation for the spirit truly is
[1:02:10] ready but your flesh it's
[1:02:13] weak amen your flesh is
[1:02:17] weak God help us God help me God help me
[1:02:22] to have our flesh in control in Ezekiel
[1:02:27] 9:4 here the death angel went through
[1:02:30] the
[1:02:32] city and this and the Death Angel put a
[1:02:35] mark on them on their forehead that
[1:02:38] sighed and cried for the Abominations
[1:02:42] committed in the city amen the concern
[1:02:46] of the
[1:02:48] people around
[1:02:50] them
[1:02:52] amazing amazing
[1:02:56] love when we look into this
[1:03:00] deeper into switching some now from
[1:03:06] grace to forgiveness how is it possible
[1:03:09] to have Amazing Grace it's not without
[1:03:14] forgiveness even though that I was ugly
[1:03:17] in sin God loved us before he before we
[1:03:20] were
[1:03:21] beautiful amen we were running from God
[1:03:26] and he still loved
[1:03:27] us God help
[1:03:30] us here in Matthew 614 and 15 and this
[1:03:34] is right before God is teaching the
[1:03:38] disciples the Lord's
[1:03:40] Prayer and so you know the disciples
[1:03:42] that came to us and he came to them and
[1:03:44] said Lord teach us how to pray and then
[1:03:46] in Matthew 14 and I I might have this
[1:03:49] paraphrase some just for shorter he says
[1:03:51] for if ye forgive men your trespass
[1:03:54] passes your heavenly father will also
[1:03:56] forgive you but 15 but if ye forgive not
[1:04:00] men their trespasses neither will your
[1:04:03] heavenly father forgive you your
[1:04:06] trespasses and here's God showing us how
[1:04:09] he forgave us and redeemed us back to
[1:04:14] himself but will we do the same for the
[1:04:18] people that we are in contact with and
[1:04:21] fellowship with I'm going to tell you
[1:04:23] some amazing stories here we're going to
[1:04:25] look into Joseph first and but John 1
[1:04:28] says John 1: 14:20 says if any man say
[1:04:31] unto God say I love God and hateth his
[1:04:34] brother he's a liar for he that loveth
[1:04:37] his not his brother whom he has seen how
[1:04:40] can he love God whom he has not
[1:04:43] seen and this commandment have we from
[1:04:46] him that he who loveth God loveth also
[1:04:51] his brother now we're peculiar people
[1:04:55] and we're never going to be the same
[1:04:56] we're never going to see a car or a bus
[1:04:59] the same
[1:05:01] way but God still expects us to have
[1:05:05] Grace and
[1:05:06] forgiveness those things we see in the
[1:05:09] Bible here in Philippians 48 and I'm
[1:05:11] just going fast because I want to get to
[1:05:13] the Forgiveness part he said finally my
[1:05:14] brother whatsoever things are true
[1:05:17] whatsoever things are honest and
[1:05:18] whatsoever things are just and whosoever
[1:05:21] things are pure and whatsoever things
[1:05:23] are Lov whatsoever things are of good
[1:05:26] report if there be any virtue and if
[1:05:28] there be any praise think on these
[1:05:31] things you know it was it it it it it it
[1:05:35] affected us it affected me being
[1:05:39] God it
[1:05:41] did it affected me being gone knowing
[1:05:44] their
[1:05:45] situation and what they Liv through you
[1:05:48] know we don't know what another brother
[1:05:50] lives through unless you walk in their
[1:05:53] sand
[1:05:55] many of you see people and you take for
[1:05:57] granted that they got everything all
[1:05:58] packed together and you don't have a
[1:06:01] clue what they just went through we're
[1:06:03] all in different situations some of
[1:06:04] youve lost loved ones or sickness
[1:06:07] long-term sickness accidents with no
[1:06:09] fault of your own or different
[1:06:12] things and we need to be like Christ and
[1:06:15] have a compassion that touches that
[1:06:18] infirmity for healing from Jehovah you
[1:06:22] know I going tell you something what
[1:06:24] when we went to the El Salvador the
[1:06:26] first day we went to wear the head the
[1:06:29] Civil
[1:06:31] War and Pastor Jose told me stories that
[1:06:35] I'll guarantee you you don't
[1:06:39] know their country was in full-fledged
[1:06:43] War amazing enough when they were in war
[1:06:46] Canada and Russia were two of the
[1:06:48] biggest countries that supported the
[1:06:50] people that'll shock you they were on
[1:06:53] the same side
[1:06:56] and America supported the government and
[1:06:59] brother Jose said he said I was
[1:07:01] definitely on the people
[1:07:02] side he said five people owned the whole
[1:07:05] country of El Salvador and all the rest
[1:07:07] of us were slaves we got 50 cents a day
[1:07:10] whether we needed it or not and he said
[1:07:13] the people finally snapped and they took
[1:07:15] up arms and they started shooting
[1:07:16] everybody that moved that was
[1:07:19] government brother Jose told me himself
[1:07:23] he said Dale I remember remember jumping
[1:07:24] into the side road ditch concrete ditch
[1:07:28] and them shooting right over top of me
[1:07:31] and me laying there hearing the thud of
[1:07:34] the bullets hitting people like when we
[1:07:36] go bunny
[1:07:45] hunting
[1:07:48] wow you wonder how people carry
[1:07:52] something he lived through that he came
[1:07:56] to Canada from that pastors that we
[1:08:00] stayed with said I moved the house front
[1:08:02] right out to the line because the gangs
[1:08:05] would come and knock on the front door
[1:08:07] and beg for
[1:08:11] money but they still went to church and
[1:08:14] worship they went to church during Co
[1:08:17] when it was against the law to go to
[1:08:19] church you need to hear me church and
[1:08:22] they got stopped in traffic stops by the
[1:08:25] police with machine
[1:08:31] guns and the police said where are you
[1:08:33] going they said we're going to the house
[1:08:35] of God to worship and he said while
[1:08:37] you're there pray for
[1:08:42] us hello
[1:08:45] hello hello wherever your heart
[1:08:49] is that's where you'll
[1:08:52] be that's where you'll be
[1:08:54] wherever your heart
[1:08:56] is against the
[1:09:01] law amen now there was other pastors
[1:09:05] there was pastors that told us they were
[1:09:06] out in their street talk to the
[1:09:09] neighbors and they you know the police
[1:09:11] come by and they said if we see you out
[1:09:13] of your house we'll come take you to
[1:09:15] jail but you see you know when you look
[1:09:19] at what somebody else has went
[1:09:22] through maybe God give you a lot easier
[1:09:25] cup to
[1:09:26] carry amen we see Joseph here in the
[1:09:29] Bible we already mentioned to him he was
[1:09:33] rejected by his
[1:09:35] Brethren and all those terrible things
[1:09:38] happened to him
[1:09:43] why it was all about Amazing Grace and
[1:09:47] forgiveness because the Bible clearly
[1:09:50] shows that Joseph was hated by his flesh
[1:09:53] flesh Brothers for no
[1:09:56] reason of his own he was just born
[1:10:03] very and he could have never forgave his
[1:10:10] brothers until God sent him to
[1:10:13] prison and he was able to learn how to
[1:10:17] forgive God sent him to 13 years of
[1:10:20] prison a no fault of his own and Joseph
[1:10:24] walked
[1:10:26] out everything that was behind him was
[1:10:31] forgotten because you say how do I know
[1:10:34] that oh it's very clear because he would
[1:10:37] have killed his brothers when they got
[1:10:39] there if he had
[1:10:41] not and that's exactly what they thought
[1:10:44] he would
[1:10:45] do uhuh
[1:10:49] huh and God knew exactly the time it
[1:10:52] took
[1:10:54] to put him away that he would have the
[1:10:58] ability I pray to God we don't have to
[1:11:01] get that
[1:11:03] far what we just I don't care what
[1:11:05] anybody done to you ever period it ain't
[1:11:10] worth missing heaven for I don't care if
[1:11:12] they cut off your right arm killed your
[1:11:15] character destroyed you said you
[1:11:18] were really bad it makes no difference
[1:11:22] we're talking about eternal life
[1:11:24] or forgiveness
[1:11:28] period and you see the character that
[1:11:31] Joseph W when he went come out of prison
[1:11:35] not only did he forgive his brothers but
[1:11:38] when they
[1:11:39] came and got gra you know what he put in
[1:11:43] their
[1:11:44] bags
[1:11:49] predestination he placed all their money
[1:11:52] but then in his fa favorite brother's
[1:11:54] bag the youngest brother that was a
[1:11:57] direct brother to Joseph he placed in
[1:12:00] his King's
[1:12:05] Cup that's
[1:12:07] predestination he placed the seed in
[1:12:09] your heart that you would be able to see
[1:12:12] the mysteries of the Bible when the
[1:12:14] whole world is walking blindly in the
[1:12:17] ditch amen you know one of the messages
[1:12:20] I preached on and I I don't I don't tell
[1:12:22] you this God knows my hard and I don't
[1:12:24] even expect you to understand this but I
[1:12:27] had pastors come up you said Brother D
[1:12:29] never heard the message preach like you
[1:12:32] preached it wasn't me I had another
[1:12:35] Pastor come up and and Len was there
[1:12:37] probably every
[1:12:39] time nothing to do with Brother D I
[1:12:42] failed grade one and was in
[1:12:44] grade two you getting the
[1:12:47] picture I took speech therapy in grade
[1:12:50] two because I didn't know how to speak
[1:12:52] English
[1:12:56] that's the
[1:13:00] truth God has the way it's just it's
[1:13:03] just God Amen I had a brother we

[1:16:17] slaves not
[1:16:20] God and anything that I read if you can
[1:16:23] correct me after I'm free to for correct
[1:16:26] there anything I could see that Nelson
[1:16:28] manela did nothing to deserve prison
[1:16:30] except he wanted the right for everybody
[1:16:32] to vote and and like we're all brothers
[1:16:36] and sisters no matter what we look
[1:16:39] like
[1:16:41] amen he went to prison for 27
[1:16:45] years that's a long time they would have
[1:16:48] gave him off right till the day they
[1:16:50] caught him I I seen pictures from Google
[1:16:53] when they picked him up in the train car
[1:16:54] in the bar thing and he puts his hands
[1:16:56] out doubling up his fist said I will not
[1:16:58] he said I will die before I will give up
[1:17:01] that we are
[1:17:03] equal we're all made by God equal I'll
[1:17:06] die he would
[1:17:09] have
[1:17:10] and you
[1:17:12] know prison was terrible you can't even
[1:17:16] imagine 27 years I I I I would have
[1:17:20] rather died amen
[1:17:25] he was treated terrible in
[1:17:28] prison but when he come out now this is
[1:17:30] not on the paragraph that I have here
[1:17:32] but I asked a pastor to send this to me
[1:17:36] because I I knew it kind of from memory
[1:17:38] but I have the facts of his testimony
[1:17:41] but when he came out those prison
[1:17:45] Gates 27
[1:17:52] years
[1:18:17] could have you done
[1:18:18] it I'll tell you
[1:18:21] what I
[1:18:24] couldn't I could
[1:18:27] not you know that P was so powerful that
[1:18:32] years
[1:18:34] after the love of his life that
[1:18:51] Liv
[1:18:58] let me tell you some of the things that
[1:18:59] he
[1:19:09] got I can tell you by memory better than
[1:19:11] reading it I'd have to find
[1:19:14] it but you know they got one meal a
[1:19:17] day they had abusive
[1:19:21] labor and
[1:19:23] and all these like prison was terrible
[1:19:26] it wasn't Canadian prison there was no
[1:19:28] movie
[1:19:29] screens and he come out and he won the
[1:19:32] first election that the black people
[1:19:34] could
[1:19:35] vote in a
[1:19:38] landslide and now that he's president
[1:19:42] and the
[1:19:43] leader I had a pastor tell me this story
[1:19:46] by the way and it just hugely you know
[1:19:50] Jared said he said I don't know why I
[1:19:51] sang that song cuz God knew what was
[1:19:53] coming I never told Jared what I was
[1:19:56] preaching
[1:19:57] on
[1:20:00] man the one time he was President he
[1:20:03] asked his bodyguards he said I just want
[1:20:05] to go up town and stroll around up town
[1:20:08] and they were strolling around and
[1:20:09] there's restaurants everywhere and he
[1:20:11] went in a
[1:20:12] restaurant and there was one man in the
[1:20:16] restaurant and when he walked in that
[1:20:18] man began to tremble in the restroom and
[1:20:23] they sat down at their table they
[1:20:24] ordered their food now he's the
[1:20:27] president he has 100 bodyguards and all
[1:20:30] this stuff and you know in the process
[1:20:33] of them getting their food Nelson
[1:20:35] Mandela he he realizes that there's a
[1:20:37] man over there sitting alone the table
[1:20:40] he told his SC he said you go over and
[1:20:41] get that
[1:20:42] man and you bring him to my
[1:20:46] table to eat with
[1:20:49] me and so they
[1:20:51] did
[1:20:53] and the man when he came to their
[1:20:56] table was shaking so bad he needed help
[1:20:59] to
[1:21:00] walk to get to the
[1:21:03] table or just he was just out of control
[1:21:07] his bodily functions were out of
[1:21:10] control they had their
[1:21:13] meal they parted
[1:21:15] ways and a soldier asked him he said why
[1:21:18] did you scare that man so much or why
[1:21:20] was that man scared so much
[1:21:26] Nelsa Mandela said when I was in
[1:21:30] prison after they would beat me and we'd
[1:21:34] have a day of hard
[1:21:37] labor and I would ask for a glass of
[1:21:41] water he said that man would come over
[1:21:44] and urinate on my
[1:21:51] head
[1:22:05] no Mandela said these
[1:22:08] words he because I can't even read it
[1:22:11] but he said you don't build
[1:22:13] Nations by
[1:22:15] torment and cut people's heads
[1:22:19] off he said the weak
[1:22:25] can never
[1:22:28] forget Only the Strong have
[1:22:37] forgiveness when I heard that I heard
[1:22:39] that in no Salvador I was just
[1:22:42] like
[1:22:43] wow not one of us have lived through
[1:22:46] that you might have had some people do
[1:22:49] some bad things about you I know I I've
[1:22:52] had lots of people say lots of things
[1:22:54] we've all had people say things about us
[1:22:56] behind our back it makes no difference
[1:22:59] it Mak what's that a difference in the
[1:23:02] scheme of
[1:23:05] anything amen I've been guilty
[1:23:09] myself
[1:23:13] amen Amazing
[1:23:15] Grace through forgiveness the only way
[1:23:18] you can taste of Amazing
[1:23:21] Grace is if you have that kind of
[1:23:25] forgiveness let's
[1:23:30] stand
[1:23:32] hallelujah
[1:23:35] hallelujah that's
[1:23:38] Supernatural but our God had that kind
[1:23:40] of
[1:23:41] forgiveness he left the Splendor of
[1:23:43] Heaven knowing exactly what he would
[1:23:46] have to
[1:23:47] do amen God help us you know if we we
[1:23:52] say which we did if we say we came from
[1:23:55] God and if you come from God you must
[1:23:58] return to God because God won't be fully
[1:24:01] complete until you do return to God
[1:24:03] that's Genesis 1: 128 and if you came
[1:24:06] from God and you're returning to God
[1:24:08] you're going to have exactly God's
[1:24:13] characters and that was
[1:24:17] forgiveness there is nothing if you you
[1:24:20] know the Bible says he says fear not the
[1:24:22] people that can even kill
[1:24:27] you because they can't take your
[1:24:30] soul amen so today I know I know today
[1:24:34] we live in a in a in a free a safe you
[1:24:37] know that they don't kill you so they
[1:24:39] kill your character does that change who
[1:24:42] you
[1:24:43] are it don't change who you are they can
[1:24:47] butcher your
[1:24:48] character but they can never butcher
[1:24:51] your character with
[1:24:53] Christ they might in watch this every
[1:24:56] one of you here somebody might come to
[1:24:58] me and God help me I would never be a
[1:25:00] garbage can but they might influence
[1:25:03] anybody about somebody
[1:25:06] else but there's one
[1:25:08] person there's at least one person you
[1:25:11] can have complete confidence
[1:25:14] in and that's your
[1:25:20] daddy so does it really matter because
[1:25:24] see we're not going to Heaven by what
[1:25:25] people say about our character or if
[1:25:29] they kill us or anything
[1:25:31] else but what
[1:25:34] about you're going to let Satan build up
[1:25:37] a root of
[1:25:38] bitterness and you're going to hold a
[1:25:40] grudge and it's going to only hurt one
[1:25:43] person that's the person that you need
[1:25:45] to hold a mirror in front of it makes no
[1:25:47] difference I don't make no difference it
[1:25:49] don't matter if people say I had a
[1:25:51] hundred wives make makes no difference
[1:25:53] don't matter what they say about
[1:25:56] you don't matter if the bullets are all
[1:25:58] shooting over your
[1:26:02] back it don't even matter if the bullets
[1:26:04] hit
[1:26:06] you because when you get there were you
[1:26:09] able to forgive
[1:26:11] them and the only way you can receive
[1:26:14] Amazing Grace is by amazing
[1:26:18] forgiveness
[1:26:19] Hallelujah God help me
[1:26:23] God help me it's it's my
[1:26:29] goodness think that you would give up
[1:26:31] your family your heavenly family it's
[1:26:33] just not worth most all things that
[1:26:36] happen are just misunderstandings or or
[1:26:41] whatever it don't it just don't matter
[1:26:44] it just don't matter it's never been no
