[24:29] I believe they will have drove the
[24:32] farthest
[24:33] amen and just a couple of announcements
[24:36] we want to make we have a a new poster
[24:38] there for John Simon's uh uh uh meetings
[24:42] next weekend and it has on it who's
[24:44] preaching it's on the table and also I I
[24:48] had started to come this way with a
[24:49] poster and it got left in one of the
[24:52] vehicles but there's also young people
[24:54] meetings at John denas this weekend and
[24:57] I believe it's a husband and wife coming
[24:59] from I think New Zealand or somewhere
[25:02] I've never seen them but there's young
[25:04] people meetings there Friday and
[25:06] Saturday um so we just encourage you to
[25:10] be a part of anything that you can be
[25:12] amen and and uh I apologize for the
[25:15] poster not being up for John danz I
[25:17] actually thought it was or I would have
[25:19] printed it again and it got left in one
[25:21] of the vehicles but that was not on
[25:24] purpose amen amen and so we just uh
[25:29] uh we still are undecided we me and Lan
[25:33] ourselves possibly might not be here
[25:36] next
[25:37] Sunday but that's subject to the weather
[25:41] you just have to understand where we
[25:43] live we don't have our crops in
[25:46] yet and uh so uh we're invited to a
[25:51] lunch in for a retirement for John
[25:53] Simons and so
[25:55] uh you know if we're away brother Junior
[25:58] will be ministering amen but uh that
[26:01] that may or may not happen but it'll
[26:04] just be me and my wife so amen amen
[26:07] let's just look into God's word and you
[26:09] know that song was so beautiful we're
[26:11] going to read John 3:3 and then we're
[26:13] going to turn to Ezekiel 36 and 26 and
[26:17] you know brother Braham said in in the
[26:20] Lamb of and the dove he said the hardest
[26:22] thing we'll do is surrender to the
[26:24] leadership of the holy spirit amen the
[26:27] more that you can humble yourself and
[26:30] let God in and take control he said the
[26:33] people it's the hardest thing the people
[26:35] can do he said they can't let the Holy
[26:37] Spirit and their heads or their hearts
[26:41] they just they just are so used to you
[26:44] know
[26:45] leading that they can't let god god
[26:48] Jehovah the Holy Spirit lead them you
[26:51] know and you know he he said another one
[26:54] I have some of these on my phone I just
[26:56] printed just even God leading and things
[26:58] as we were driving to church he said you
[27:01] know the cause for
[27:03] misunderstanding is because you go by
[27:06] your
[27:07] experience rather than by the word of
[27:09] God that's in the suurus church Age
[27:12] series he said the reason that anybody
[27:14] would have a misunderstanding in the
[27:17] body of Christ is because you're judging
[27:20] by your past
[27:23] experience and not by God's word God
[27:26] help us as we look into his word and and
[27:29] we're going to look into many many
[27:31] things and this will be one of probably
[27:33] part two or three for
[27:35] sure and this is something that is
[27:39] just
[27:40] uh just come to me and and I can't I
[27:44] can't leave it away and some of this I I
[27:47] actually had four messages started in my
[27:50] iPad separately some of them were from
[27:53] over a month ago and just God dealing
[27:56] with us and you know we're going to go
[27:57] on a route rapure and we're going to go
[27:59] into Rapture very
[28:01] soon and he's only coming for a mature
[28:05] wife and so this other little Kitty
[28:07] stuff and the dolls and the coloring
[28:09] books we got to lay aside amen Jesus
[28:13] answered and said unto them verily
[28:15] verily I say unto thee except the man be
[28:18] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[28:22] God Amen these were people coming to see
[28:25] Jesus and let's turn over to Ezekiel 36
[28:28] and
[28:29] 26 and this was powerful and this
[28:32] explains the whole problem that's in the
[28:34] church today and and in the message for
[28:37] sure and and you know I I pray to God
[28:40] that he will re reveal himself to you
[28:43] individually and and help
[28:45] us in a special way this morning amen
[28:50] God help us T not you know Paul said in
[28:53] the New Testament he said I fear that by
[28:55] the subd of Satan that he'll come in in
[28:58] and you will preach a different Jesus
[29:01] and you know and I I preached some of
[29:03] those sermons long back and a year ago
[29:05] and that but this is the same kind of
[29:07] sedu that Satan will do and let's read
[29:11] this scripture a new heart also I'll
[29:13] give thee and a new spirit I'll put into
[29:17] you and I'll take away the Stony heart
[29:22] and I'll
[29:23] put I'll take away the Stony heart out
[29:26] of your flesh and I will give you
[29:28] a heart of Flesh Lord Jesus we pray that
[29:33] you'll bless your word and bless your
[29:34] people and Lord May everything be done
[29:37] and said according to your will your
[29:39] leading and Lord we we invite you to be
[29:43] the Unseen guest here we invite you to
[29:45] be the scene guest Lord God where you
[29:48] break the Word of Life to your people we
[29:51] pray in Jesus name
[29:55] amen amen you may have your SE this
[29:59] morning you know brother Brown mentioned
[30:02] this in the message up multiple times in
[30:04] the scripture in Ezekiel and you know he
[30:07] he mentioned it so much he said most
[30:09] people in the church today get a new
[30:12] spirit and they believe they have the
[30:14] Holy Spirit and they're deceived now he
[30:18] mentioned that mult dozens and dozens
[30:21] and dozens of times connected to this
[30:23] scripture and you can always tell
[30:26] somebody that has the the wrong Spirit
[30:28] or doesn't have the Holy Spirit because
[30:30] they'll have a problem with the word of
[30:32] God Amen they'll have a problem with the
[30:35] word of God and however it's delivered
[30:37] amen and so many people brother B said
[30:40] that he had to give you a new spirit to
[30:42] get along with yourself he said he had
[30:44] to give you a new spirit to get along
[30:46] with the Holy Spirit and he said people
[30:48] stop before they go all the way in the
[30:51] experience and they stop with the new
[30:53] experience because it made you a better
[30:56] person but it didn't make you have the
[30:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and we
[31:00] see that no man shall inherit the
[31:02] Kingdom of Heaven see the kingdom of God
[31:04] and people ask brother Braham who will
[31:06] be there and he said if you came from
[31:08] God and you know Junior mentioned last
[31:10] week Sunday you know the word of God was
[31:13] in Mary you know and but the same word
[31:15] of God is in each one of us brother brah
[31:17] said that when he created
[31:20] Christ his son that it was the logos
[31:24] that went out from God and he said today
[31:26] we call it the theop
[31:28] but he said when he created you it was
[31:31] the exact same identical logos you
[31:35] either are a part of him or you ain't
[31:37] nothing at all amen God help us to be a
[31:40] part of God but we know that if we're a
[31:42] part of him we will fit in with them and
[31:46] Dov tail amen and God cannot refuse his
[31:50] word God will not deny his word it it's
[31:54] impossible how could Christ deny Christ
[31:57] come on now anointed one that's not a
[31:59] possibility and I'm going to share many
[32:02] things I actually put I put uh if we get
[32:04] that far and if we don't it'll be next
[32:06] week but I actually put up 10 pictures
[32:09] that I'm going to show in the screen
[32:10] quotes because because they're just
[32:13] unbelievable quotes that that you're
[32:16] going to you're going to think that
[32:17] brother Dale's went uh cucko you know I
[32:20] heard a minister when we started the
[32:22] church about 10 years ago and I listened
[32:23] to a message on absolute and a minister
[32:26] was preaching a very popular minister
[32:28] the
[32:29] states and he was preaching on the
[32:32] absolute and I said to myself back then
[32:34] 10 years ago I said you know if I
[32:36] preached that in my church everybody
[32:37] would leave now back then it only would
[32:39] have been my family and two or three
[32:41] other
[32:42] people but because see they were gauged
[32:45] on worship of each other they would
[32:49] accept it from a minister that had been
[32:51] in the message for 30 years and had 300
[32:54] people in his
[32:56] church but the same holy H spirit in a
[32:58] new minister they wouldn't take
[33:01] it amen and brother Brown never taught
[33:04] it like that amen you either are he or
[33:08] you aren't he you are either are she or
[33:11] you aren't she you know and I love the
[33:14] gospel that don't put big eyes and
[33:16] little eyes and little yous and you know
[33:18] if we just all humble oursel and become
[33:20] you know the Bible says that if we
[33:21] become like children be like
[33:25] children you will see the kingdom of
[33:27] heaven sure and I'm just going to tell
[33:29] you something you're having a hard time
[33:30] being children and so am I because it's
[33:33] just not our makeup it's it's it's just
[33:37] not amen what God is talking about here
[33:41] about being children he's not talking
[33:42] about
[33:43] immaturity he's talking about just
[33:45] simply believe just simply take it you
[33:49] see a child has no experiences on their
[33:52] own so what they hear and what they see
[33:56] they believe amen
[33:58] that's why we're not supposed to light
[33:59] your Earth children that's why we don't
[34:01] talk about Santa Claus cuz he's a fake
[34:04] that's why don't talk about all these
[34:05] lies that the world accepts today
[34:08] because when they grow up and they say
[34:09] you lied to me when I was five you're
[34:10] still lying to me when I'm
[34:12] 15
[34:13] amen those are make that's that's
[34:17] nothing but Satan trying to take Glory
[34:19] that's meant for God turning Santa Claus
[34:21] into somebody that only Jesus would know
[34:24] Divine that he knows what you want for
[34:26] Christmas he knows whether whether
[34:27] you've been good or naughty that's
[34:30] ridiculous that's that's insanity and
[34:33] the world gobbles it
[34:36] up right God have mercy on
[34:40] us how far have we
[34:42] went amen God have mercy on
[34:45] us
[34:48] Amen Let me just lay mention a couple of
[34:52] these quotes just to lay a foundation
[34:54] because they're they're hard to believe
[34:57] amen
[34:58] he said the Bible said that he'd give
[34:59] you a new heart and he'd give you a new
[35:01] spirit and many people even the
[35:03] Pentecostal people and the Full Gospel
[35:04] people have been deceived in that many
[35:07] times God said I'll give you a new
[35:09] spirit and he said that isn't his
[35:11] Spirit that's right that's in the hidden
[35:14] Life of Christ he said you'll notice
[35:16] another par another quote he said and
[35:18] the god being the first thing you take
[35:20] away is the old Stony heart and you'll
[35:22] receive he said I'll give you a new
[35:23] spirit he said that ain't his holy
[35:25] spirit that's in impersonating of
[35:28] Christianity we got the greatest
[35:30] impersonating of Christianity going on
[35:32] in the ranks of this message that you've
[35:34] ever seen in your born
[35:36] life that's why we have different
[35:39] camps
[35:42] amen that's impersonation of
[35:44] Christianity if we all got the same God
[35:46] and we're all going to the same heaven
[35:48] and there ain't going to be categories
[35:49] and rooms and uh you know lounges and
[35:52] man you you we we we we think of Heaven
[35:54] as like the Titanic the poor people were
[35:57] in the B them they drown the first
[36:00] class that's disgusting what kind of a
[36:04] holywood are we
[36:05] worshiping amen God help us he said you
[36:07] know in John 141 John 1413 uh 16 to1 18
[36:12] sorry John 14 16- 18 and I pray the
[36:15] father that he'll give you another
[36:17] comforter and that he may abide with you
[36:19] forever and even the spirit of Truth
[36:22] whom the world cannot receive because he
[36:23] seeth him not neither knoweth him not
[36:25] but ye know him for he dwell in you
[36:29] there's the key part and shall be with
[36:32] you and he will not leave you
[36:34] comfortless for I will come unto you God
[36:39] help us in this time this last age you
[36:42] know this last age is right at the end
[36:45] where so many people will fall
[36:48] away and it's because they're looking on
[36:50] their experiences and they're
[36:52] understanding and they're going to be
[36:54] lost you know in the past month or so
[36:56] month and a half we had a lot of new
[36:58] people come through the church and
[36:59] ministers and even
[37:02] visitors and we all carry
[37:06] spirits and by God's grace you know part
[37:10] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[37:13] discernment amen and I can I mean by
[37:17] God's grace let me let me say it this
[37:19] way it's a better way to say God can
[37:21] pick up aony a mile
[37:24] away
[37:26] amen that's right and God can give that
[37:29] to each one of
[37:31] us
[37:34] amen here he said let's just still
[37:37] laying a foundation for our thought now
[37:39] he said what's happening to the church
[37:40] is is received the seventh seal book and
[37:44] the revelation of Jesus
[37:46] Christ and not one now this is a direct
[37:52] quote and he said not one tenth of you
[37:56] can receive it
[37:59] that's in paragraph
[38:01] 179 and 61 after the seals of
[38:03] Revelations of of chapter 5 part two he
[38:07] said and we've received the opening of
[38:09] the seventh seal book and it's a
[38:11] revelation of Jesus Christ and not one
[38:14] tenth of you can receive it so now this
[38:17] actually gives the picture of the entire
[38:19] Bible and the seals that that the Bible
[38:22] had hid from the eyes of the wi and
[38:24] proof and God Did It by his Holy Spirit
[38:26] open them up revealing them right
[38:28] through the Bible glory to God God help
[38:33] us that we're the one t that can receive
[38:37] the
[38:38] revelation of Jesus
[38:41] Christ God God help us you know in John
[38:44] 5 here here they were and maybe we'll
[38:48] read it John 536 and 39 it just still
[38:52] I'm I'm trying to lay a foundation here
[38:54] we want to talk about we want to talk
[38:56] about deity and we want to talk about
[38:58] worship and we want to talk about
[39:01] Christ the anointed one John 5:36 but I
[39:05] have a greater witness than John for the
[39:08] works that the father hasth given
[39:11] me to finish and the same works that I
[39:14] do bear witness of me that the father
[39:17] has sent me and 37 and the father
[39:19] himself which has sent me hath bore
[39:22] witness of
[39:23] me ye have neither heard his voice at
[39:27] any time neither seen his shape verse 38
[39:30] and ye have not his words abiding in you
[39:33] for whom he has sent him ye believe not
[39:38] he's talking about himself that's he's
[39:41] not talking about John he's talking
[39:43] about
[39:44] Christ the people had not receiv
[39:46] received the anointed one the Christ and
[39:48] he says verse 39 search the scriptures
[39:51] for in them you
[39:54] think you're a message believer
[39:57] eternal life and they are they which
[40:01] testify of me how can it how can you
[40:05] believe which receive honor watch
[40:09] this
[40:11] one of another and seek not the
[40:16] honor that
[40:18] Cometh From God you know every one of us
[40:23] have been guilty of you know it's just
[40:25] human nature that we want to be accepted
[40:27] we want to fit in we want to be I want
[40:29] friends myself I don't want to be a dead
[40:32] old grouchy man like brother Brown
[40:33] talked about it I don't want to have
[40:34] that Spirit when I become
[40:36] old but we need to have
[40:39] approval and honor from God H than honor
[40:44] from man and man's always seeking this
[40:47] honor from each other but what about
[40:50] God Amen God help
[40:54] us God help us
[41:04] here he's talking about the same Spirit
[41:06] and the new spirit and I'm just just to
[41:08] go faster I have a
[41:11] paragraph well here we we'll say in the
[41:13] do doors in a door he said he said you
[41:16] join a church he said I'm as good as you
[41:18] he said see I've accepted Christ he said
[41:20] maybe that's just what you've done now
[41:23] watch watch watch how he breaks this
[41:24] down he said you've accepted Christ
[41:26] we've accepted the message we've
[41:28] accepted the anointed word for our day
[41:31] he said you've ex accepted Christ and
[41:33] maybe that's just what you've done but
[41:35] did you make
[41:37] him your
[41:41] Lord that's a difference see and now the
[41:44] Lord can't sit down in the Book of Rules
[41:46] and say the word and then come around
[41:48] and deny it he said if you say that you
[41:50] got the Holy Ghost and the Bible says a
[41:52] certain thing to do and you say well I
[41:54] don't believe that he said just remember
[41:56] that the the spirit that's in you is not
[41:59] the holy spirit cuz it can't deny itself
[42:02] that's right he said he can't deny
[42:04] himself he wrote the word he watches
[42:06] over it and he'll perform it see so it's
[42:09] not the holy spirit that you got he said
[42:12] it's a spirit all right and it might be
[42:14] a spirit in the church and it might be
[42:17] the spirit of the pastor and it might be
[42:19] the spirit of the world and it it might
[42:22] be I don't know what it would be but
[42:24] it's not the Holy Spirit
[42:27] Hallelujah Matthew 13:10 And1 and the
[42:30] disciples came unto him saying saying
[42:32] unto him he said why speak ye in
[42:35] Parables and he answered and said unto
[42:37] them and I love this I could preach for
[42:40] eternity on this one because it is given
[42:42] unto you to
[42:45] know Hallelujah you should lose your
[42:48] mind on this scripture because it's
[42:50] given unto you to know the mysteries of
[42:52] the kingdom of heaven but to them
[42:59] it's not given Hallelujah here you know
[43:03] we see so I want to just show you some
[43:05] things that that we're blessed with in
[43:07] our day you know and and then we're
[43:09] going to go into our actual test text we
[43:12] we see in this day that we're blessed we
[43:15] understand deity and we understand that
[43:17] deity isn't in heaven alone but it's
[43:19] tabernacled in this building and it's
[43:21] Tabernacle in each one that has the
[43:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost and it wasn't
[43:25] just in the same deity that was in
[43:28] Christ is in each one of us with the
[43:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and he
[43:33] said you know they came to brother
[43:35] brandham and they asked him and they
[43:36] said what should we call you this this
[43:38] big shot came to brother brandham and he
[43:47] said sorry I'm ahead of myself
[43:51] there he said if we had the sa wh watch
[43:54] this I want to show you the deity
[43:56] forgive me I want to show you the deity
[43:58] how The Same Spirit he said and the
[44:00] spirit of the Holy Spirit would say let
[44:02] there be light and there was light and
[44:04] he said let there be trees and he and he
[44:06] did the whole creation let there be in
[44:08] the creation and he said that same mind
[44:10] that was in Christ is in use with the
[44:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said so
[44:15] how much more could you say Let there
[44:18] not be cancer let there not be blindness
[44:22] upon my eyes Let Let The Healing in my
[44:24] body be so that's the SP spoken word
[44:27] today in our midst you know when Jesus
[44:31] went to the garden and he was praying to
[44:34] Jehovah and they said well who he
[44:36] praying to he was praying to himself
[44:38] because Christ was Tabernacle Jehovah he
[44:41] wasn't praying to a far away God and
[44:44] this morning if God's tabernacled in our
[44:46] flesh we're not praying to a far away
[44:49] God we don't have to look up or look
[44:51] down or look sideways and we don't have
[44:53] to get a big shot amen anybody that's
[44:56] tab on deity you can speak the word just
[45:00] like Jehovah himself did let there be
[45:03] light Let There Be trees let there be a
[45:07] lion let that cancer in my wife be gone
[45:11] Hallelujah that's spoken word and it's
[45:14] right in our midst and you don't have to
[45:17] get a big shot evangelist you don't have
[45:20] to because it's Tabernacle in each one
[45:22] of us that's right amen and you watch
[45:25] this he said
[45:28] Hallelujah here Jesus talking about he
[45:31] said I do nothing but the father show me
[45:33] he's he's bringing it back to Christ the
[45:35] Holy Spirit the father and he and he
[45:37] said you shall have it he said it's not
[45:40] me he said you shall have it that power
[45:42] that was given to the bride it's the
[45:44] Holy Ghost filled in the church that's
[45:47] right Hallelujah but it comes by the
[45:50] revelation of
[45:51] Christ and understanding positionally
[45:54] who you are amen everything we believe
[45:57] and teach points to
[46:00] Christ
[46:02] deity Amen Let Let me just read some
[46:05] examples of the Prophet just quickly he
[46:07] said but there's only one thing that our
[46:11] being here is centered around and that's
[46:13] Jesus Christ so God let us lay aside
[46:17] everything secondary and hold on to him
[46:22] Hallelujah we see here because God
[46:25] blessed us with a prophet and our day
[46:27] and and and you revealed the Mysteries
[46:29] that was already in the Bible it wasn't
[46:32] a new Bible they were there all along
[46:35] but we didn't understand them and we
[46:37] were confused like everybody in the
[46:39] world and they would go to cemetery
[46:41] school for years and they would come out
[46:43] and be dumber than when they
[46:45] went because they just took a man's
[46:48] ideas and so we see in our day we
[46:51] understand the the the the perfectly the
[46:54] word of God we understand the four first
[46:57] writers in Revelations we understand
[46:59] that that was Satan's mask and when
[47:01] Satan comes in like a flood God will
[47:03] raise up a standard against him we
[47:05] understand that true baptism of the Holy
[47:07] Ghost it's a part of God brother Brown
[47:09] said that God literally ripped himself
[47:11] in the day of Pentecost ripped himself
[47:13] apart giving licks of fire upon each one
[47:16] of
[47:17] you Hallelujah we understand the true
[47:21] godhead amen we understand true baptism
[47:25] we understand true one God one Lord and
[47:27] one Christ we understand the baptism we
[47:31] understand Grace without it being to
[47:33] disgrace that if you came from God and
[47:36] we understand eternity that there was no
[47:38] eternal hell that if you were Eternal if
[47:40] you're Eternal this morning if you
[47:42] believe you got eternal life you always
[47:44] were Eternal because anything that's
[47:45] Eternal never had a beginning so we I
[47:48] was in the mind of God when he created
[47:50] the heavens Earth I was in the mind
[47:51] before he created the heavens and the
[47:52] Earth Hallelujah we understand this we
[47:56] understand the history Babylon the
[47:59] we understand all these amazing things
[48:01] and that don't take away that's because
[48:05] God brought it and he revealed himself
[48:08] listen you know when you're coming into
[48:10] a marriage and you're in engagement and
[48:13] and you know it's just a few weeks or
[48:15] few days before the wedding if you got
[48:18] any brains at all you're going to reveal
[48:19] everything to your wife or your husband
[48:23] if you want any kind of a marriage at
[48:24] all if she's your rib or your or he's
[48:27] your rib there will be nothing that you
[48:29] won't talk about the day before the
[48:31] wedding this is exactly what Christ did
[48:34] to us as bride his wife is he's
[48:36] revealing everything because he knows
[48:38] that we're at a moment of time a
[48:40] twinkling of an eye he's going to
[48:43] come and reveal himself totally we
[48:46] understand the mystery of Christ the
[48:47] same yesterday today and forever there's
[48:49] nothing that happened in the past that
[48:52] can't happen here this morning than amen
[48:56] we understand the history of the
[48:58] blindness of the Israelites so we could
[49:01] be grafted in the
[49:03] 144,000 Amazing Grace
[49:08] Hallelujah multiple multiple Mysteries
[49:11] that we understand we need to not take
[49:14] these for
[49:15] granted amen God help
[49:17] us God help us to understand that we're
[49:20] blessed blessed beyond measure but
[49:24] because of all these blessings you you
[49:26] know Satan hangs around where there's
[49:29] honey there's always a lot of flies
[49:31] where there's a smell and we got the
[49:34] honey this morning and so everything
[49:36] that's related to
[49:38] Satan we're Shing
[49:41] off amen we're shoing off remember the
[49:44] prophet was shoing off in the Bible
[49:45] Peter was going to Sho it off all the
[49:47] the the evil stuff that was coming
[49:52] in amen God help us
[49:57] as we sh off these imitators of Christ
[50:03] these Slickers you know our Prophet
[50:04] clearly taught us that Satan wasn't
[50:06] something that you could recognize come
[50:09] on on you can recognize it if you have
[50:12] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you
[50:13] know what I'm saying it wasn't like
[50:18] obvious
[50:23] uhhuh God help us
[50:27] you know as we go through this I want to
[50:31] show you multiple things that God used
[50:33] in the
[50:34] Bible and because the people were people
[50:39] God had to rip them down yeah
[50:45] amen
[50:49] hallelujah in the Bible in numbers 21
[50:53] 5-9 and we're not going to read it but
[50:55] God has a servant Moses put up a serpent
[50:58] a bronze serpent so the people were
[51:01] dying because they were getting bit and
[51:04] he said no matter where you are in the
[51:05] earth if you just you didn't have to see
[51:06] it if you just look towards it see you
[51:09] know Jonah and the whale never seen the
[51:14] serpent but he looked towards it he seen
[51:16] it by
[51:18] faith and was saved and so was the the
[51:21] city amen but we see that Moses raised
[51:24] up this this uh
[51:28] this uh
[51:31] Serpent and God sent another Prophet
[51:34] along to tear it
[51:36] down because the very thing that God was
[51:39] using the people went to worship the
[51:42] actual bronze
[51:44] Serpent and Spirits don't change you
[51:47] know let me give you an example you said
[51:49] you know every artist that's paintings
[51:51] are worth like 10
[51:53] million not one of them's alive
[51:59] you got to
[52:00] die before you're valuable it's kind of
[52:03] like a farmer when you die you're
[52:04] valuable but until then you're just flat
[52:07] broke amen but anything's valuable you
[52:10] know people will say all kinds of nice
[52:12] things before you die or when you die
[52:14] when they're walk oh you know he was the
[52:18] greatest amen our Prophet talked about
[52:20] he said why don't we give flowers when
[52:21] we're alive why don't you say hey
[52:23] they're the greatest today today
[52:27] but we're in a competition well he can
[52:29] be the grace if I'm the
[52:31] grace but when they die there's no
[52:33] competition no
[52:35] more
[52:38] amen
[52:40] hallelujah we also see in the the
[52:45] Bible where in numbers 20 where God
[52:50] Called Moses at the burning
[52:52] bush and when God Called Moses in the
[52:54] burning bush in verse seven or eight
[52:57] he commanded Moses to take his rod and
[53:00] when Moses went to Egypt everything he
[53:03] did was through the
[53:06] rod
[53:07] everything until he came to the wife
[53:10] stage oh hang with me here they were
[53:13] going to the promised land this ain't my
[53:15] home praise God I'm going to a Promised
[53:18] Land too and it's called heaven and so
[53:20] right before they were going into the
[53:22] promised land god changed his
[53:25] mask and he told Moses he said speak to
[53:28] the
[53:30] Rock and Moses worshiped the
[53:33] rod I'll say it for you
[53:35] amen you don't think you would worship
[53:38] thy rod Moses had seen that rod turned
[53:40] from serpent but in the but in the
[53:42] Tabernacle he had seen it hang over the
[53:44] water part the Red Sea he had seen it
[53:46] drop down and turn to a serpent then his
[53:48] Rod actually ate the other serpents I
[53:51] mean Moses was hello is anybody with me
[53:57] I mean that Rod had done some pretty
[53:58] Supernatural things I'll guarantee you
[54:00] brother B gave me a stick for a walking
[54:02] stick and it's amazing but if it did
[54:04] high for the rod that Mo brother Moses
[54:06] did I wouldn't keep it in the
[54:08] garage i' put it in the gun
[54:13] safe
[54:16] hello because Moses worshiped the rod th
[54:20] God himself told him to bring
[54:25] [Music]
[54:29] it cost them going into the promised
[54:32] land
[54:34] physically and so also in our day we can
[54:37] move ahead and I could give you
[54:39] scriptures for all that I'm just
[54:40] literally swiping by those
[54:42] scriptures amen the same thing happened
[54:45] in our day and this is so easy for us to
[54:47] see cuz we can just see this one some of
[54:50] the other ones you know sometimes it's
[54:52] easier to see all the flaws in everybody
[54:53] else's life but when we get a married
[54:55] you know it's the mirrors you know you
[54:58] know I I was just reading a thing you
[54:59] know the people moved in a new
[55:01] neighborhood and the wife was always
[55:02] complaining about the neighbors hanging
[55:03] out dirty laundry and the one morning
[55:05] they said wow they must got a new washer
[55:07] husband said no I got up early and wash
[55:09] the
[55:10] windows they were clean all along but
[55:13] when we look in the mirror and we see
[55:15] oursel we need some wind
[55:20] deex cuz we see that God used Mary in
[55:22] the Bible and she was highly favored
[55:25] among women
[55:26] oh
[55:28] yeah highly
[55:30] favored and the Catholic church has
[55:34] turned her into a
[55:36] god call her the actual Eternal mother
[55:39] of
[55:40] Jehovah amen now that's a very easy one
[55:43] for us to
[55:45] see but we have the same Spirit around
[55:48] us
[55:49] daily
[55:51] amen I know I'll say ouch for you ouch
[55:59] Hallelujah let me read some things that
[56:02] our Prophet said would that be all right
[56:04] I want to tell you something we had a
[56:05] minister here a month or so ago and I
[56:07] mentioned it on Wednesday night he
[56:08] quoted the prophet and when I went home
[56:10] I said I like that quote he looked two
[56:12] or three hours he couldn't find it I'll
[56:14] tell you something that won't happen
[56:15] this
[56:16] morning guarantee
[56:18] you I had these quotes you might not
[56:21] like them but I still have them amen
[56:27] and send at the door and knock he said
[56:30] then look to God and don't look at a man
[56:33] he said God don't want to show
[56:37] me that's the prophet he said he wants
[56:40] to show
[56:41] himself see we had a man come by
[56:44] here a month or so ago and I can tell
[56:47] you exactly he was a prophet
[56:50] worshipper cuz see if you follow the
[56:52] word you're obeying that's right you
[56:55] know what did what the did the prophet
[56:56] tell Saul he said obedience is better
[56:58] than sacrifice what did the prophet say
[57:01] you know I I know I you know I I I I
[57:04] know there's situations and I know but
[57:06] you know the prophet said he said if I
[57:08] was living some place and there wasn't a
[57:09] church that had all the
[57:11] truth I would go to a denominational
[57:14] church he he says it like this he says
[57:16] if they just believe that Jesus was God
[57:20] or the Lord if I had to spit all the
[57:22] other pets out I would still attend
[57:24] church so the outside world knew when
[57:26] sight I was on but message Believers
[57:28] don't believe that no absolutely not
[57:31] bless God the prophets my my pastor and
[57:35] you know he's going to marry and bury me
[57:37] and they're still doing that they're
[57:38] coming out with the tape family which is
[57:40] Straight From Hell the the very anointed
[57:43] Prophet said that God would not use no
[57:46] mechanical devices he could have used a
[57:47] donkey or you know any other animal he
[57:50] used a donkey to talk to a prophet one
[57:52] time but he chose he could have used the
[57:53] lights and the the Sun and all these
[57:55] other things but he chose
[57:57] man man we have multiple scriptures to
[58:02] show that God's the same yesterday today
[58:04] and forever but we'll see that where the
[58:07] honey
[58:09] is that's where all the things gather we
[58:14] we have to recognize that and we have to
[58:16] be able to separate the difference
[58:19] amen
[58:23] amen here he said in the seventh seal he
[58:25] said and we went to be a gem we want to
[58:28] be a gem in the crown of Jesus Christ
[58:31] and we don't want to never put
[58:33] man in
[58:35] it he said forget anything about me he
[58:39] said I'm your brother he said I'm a
[58:41] sinner saved by grace Amy if you put up
[58:43] that one that I said was hard to see is
[58:46] it hard to see it's about the ninth he
[58:49] said I'm a sinner saved by grace not fit
[58:52] to live that's exactly the truth I can't
[58:54] say that I'm not saying that to be
[58:57] humble that's the facts there's nothing
[58:59] in me not one sound thing at
[59:02] all Allelujah
[59:07] see now I showed you
[59:10] already that our Prophet was a
[59:12] Vindicated prophet and all the mysteries
[59:15] of the Bible have been revealed because
[59:18] of him through Christ using
[59:21] him but where the honey is there'll be a
[59:24] lot of other fuzzy
[59:28] plants this is the only one that's at
[59:30] small so I I apologize for that he said
[59:33] and the the the third from the top now
[59:35] I'm reading the third paragraph from the
[59:37] top he said now see I've always asked
[59:40] you to be careful who you're listening
[59:42] to he's talking about
[59:44] himself he said because there's so much
[59:46] of Just The Human Side but always if
[59:49] there's something that goes forth I'll
[59:51] say thus sayith the Lord do you know the
[59:54] Bible says that you know many people
[59:56] people are preaching that every single
[59:57] word the prophet preached is a Bible
[1:00:00] King James version if that was the case
[1:00:02] brother Brown said his name would be
[1:00:04] taken over the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:00:06] because you couldn't add to or take away
[1:00:08] from Brother Brown didn't add or change
[1:00:10] the Bible the Bible was all here
[1:00:12] perfectly he just by divine inspiration
[1:00:15] and anointing of God explained the
[1:00:17] Mysteries that we brother they had no
[1:00:19] clue the smartest doctor in the world
[1:00:22] never had a clue because this was God
[1:00:25] and it took God to show take the mask
[1:00:27] off and show who it was and he used the
[1:00:29] man brother Brown and we are the
[1:00:32] greatest age this age greatest age the
[1:00:35] great all the mysteries in this age all
[1:00:38] the Mysteries completely revealed don't
[1:00:41] misunderstand me you can't leave what
[1:00:43] you are this is everything I'm not
[1:00:46] talking about
[1:00:48] that but I have lots of scriptures where
[1:00:50] God says that I'm a jealous God and
[1:00:53] there's no other oh amen that's God help
[1:01:00] us amen he let's go to the next verse
[1:01:03] and I want to show you something you I
[1:01:05] mentioned about deity there's a thing
[1:01:07] here I want to show you in the second
[1:01:09] last verse there number eight he said
[1:01:12] like the woman that touched Jesus
[1:01:13] garment he said he didn't know who she
[1:01:17] was or what was wrong with her do you

[1:01:23] Jesus

[1:01:48] Hallelujah he said when now when Jesus
[1:01:51] spoke back to her it was thus says the
[1:01:53] Lord see Jesus recognized your facei
[1:01:56] what did a prophet say he said I'm
[1:01:57] operating it's your faith that operates

[1:02:57] thought and he spoke it out and it took

[1:03:43] first one

[1:03:49] you to see and that glorifies
[1:03:52] Christ he said it makes no difference a
[1:03:55] real true Mount Transfiguration
[1:03:58] experience only
[1:04:01] glorifies Jesus
[1:04:03] Christ listen I I want to just intersect
[1:04:06] something CU I feel something this
[1:04:07] morning brother Dale didn't choose to
[1:04:08] preach this this
[1:04:10] morning it took me six weeks I'm

[1:04:15] god this message is the truth but
[1:04:19] there's a lot of bugs hanging around
[1:04:21] this message that are a million miles
[1:04:23] from the truth
[1:04:25] there's a lot of people standing in
[1:04:27] pulpits that say they're quoting
[1:04:29] something and when you go to the after
[1:04:31] and ask for the quote they'll try to
[1:04:34] find it two hours
[1:04:40] later amen they're
[1:04:46] phony he said if it don't glorify he
[1:04:49] said it what he's talking about the
[1:04:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost still reading
[1:04:53] this this is the Easter seal this is
[1:04:55] right before he 65 he said it didn't
[1:04:57] glorify
[1:04:58] Moses it didn't glorify
[1:05:01] Elijah and it don't glorify themselves
[1:05:03] it didn't glorify nothing else but they
[1:05:06] seen the glorification of Jesus Christ
[1:05:09] and any True Believer that's in his
[1:05:12] heart that's all he's concerned about is
[1:05:15] glorifying Jesus Christ you can put the
[1:05:17] first one that's that's not it the one I
[1:05:19] just read this is the first one
[1:05:21] Amy

[1:05:26] but you know brother Brown said a pastor
[1:05:28] will carry the doctrine for the
[1:05:30] church and this is the truth this is the
[1:05:33] message of the

[1:05:37] hour has all the Cannons of Satan
[1:05:39] pointing on

[1:05:51] them watch here the down this the red in
[1:05:54] the second paragraph he said now I I
[1:05:55] have nothing against the voice of God
[1:05:59] healing but the trouble with the voice
[1:06:01] of God healing is it's got away from it
[1:06:04] is it
[1:06:08] glorifies brother Bram the man because
[1:06:11] they put his writings in
