[36:25] to a place that you can live above sin.
[36:30] That even the devil doesn't know who

[36:54] Romans 10.
[36:56] Hallelujah. We're going to look at one
[36:58] verse here.
[36:59] Hallelujah. All right. Before we look at
[37:02] one verse, let's look at verse 16.
[37:05] But they have not all obey the gospel.
[37:10] For Isaiah which mean Isaiah
[37:13] said Lord who at believe our report
[37:18] verse 17 so then faith cometh by
[37:23] hearing. What does faith cometh by?
[37:27] Thank you. Praise God. So there's no
[37:29] other way faith cometh by. Faith cometh
[37:32] by hearing.
[37:34] And not just hearing. You have to hear
[37:37] the right things. Right. Hallelujah. And
[37:41] hearing by the word of God. Hallelujah.
[37:48] Faith cometh by hearing the word of God.
[37:51] Amen. Do you know that this life You can
[37:55] be seated as as we ask the Lord to have
[37:56] his blessing to his word. Hallelujah.

[38:02] This life that that we are now living
[38:07] everything we have to have faith. Amen.
[38:11] Your walking has to have faith.
[38:15] Your conversation has to have faith.
[38:19] Your living has to have faith.
[38:22] Your healing has to have faith.
[38:26] Hallelujah.
[38:28] So your healing doesn't come by just the
[38:31] gifts that God placed in the church,
[38:34] right? But if you have hearing according
[38:37] to the word of God, then you are
[38:40] entitled to receive your healing. Amen.
[38:44] We got to back it up the scriptures.
[38:47] Hallelujah. Because the Bible said,
[38:50] hallelujah. And these signs shall follow
[38:55] them that believe. Yes, sir. What do you
[38:57] believe? Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[39:02] You got to believe the word. And when I
[39:06] say the word, I'm not speaking about the
[39:08] letter.
[39:10] There's a difference with the letter and
[39:13] the word. Hallelujah. Brother, what are
[39:16] you talking about? Jesus said,
[39:20] Hallelujah. He said, the flesh profitth
[39:23] nothing, right?
[39:25] But the spirit giveth life. He said,
[39:29] "The words that I speak unto you, they
[39:32] are spirit and life."
[39:35] Hallelujah.
[39:37] One time in John 5:39,
[39:40] Jesus said, "Go search the scriptures."
[39:44] Hallelujah. For in them you think you
[39:46] have eternal life, and they are there
[39:49] testify of me.
[39:52] Hallelujah. What the Jewish had, they
[39:55] had the letter,
[39:57] but they didn't have the spirit,
[40:00] but the letter didn't profit them
[40:02] nothing. Glory to God. The letter could
[40:06] not quicken them. It takes the spirit to
[40:10] quicken you. That is why Jesus said to
[40:14] the woman at the well, the father
[40:16] seeketh such to worship him. The true
[40:20] worshipper, they must worship the father
[40:23] in spirit and in truth.
[40:27] Hallelujah.
[40:29] Oh, glory to God. I'm going to preach
[40:32] this morning.
[40:34] Remember the topic. Hallelujah. The
[40:37] topic. The topic is hearing and
[40:40] receiving and manifesting.
[40:43] Hallelujah. It is important to hear the
[40:46] right sound. All right. Hallelujah.
[40:50] Everything carry a sound.
[40:53] We see here via the piano, it carry a
[40:56] different sound. The drum, it carry a
[40:59] different sound. Everything carry a
[41:02] sound. So is it with the spirit of God.
[41:06] That's why Jesus said, "Hallelujah." The
[41:09] spirit moves with a sound.
[41:13] Hallelujah.
[41:15] In Acts 2 when the Bible said, "And they
[41:17] heard a sound of a mighty rushing wind."
[41:22] What was that? Was the spirit.
[41:25] Hallelujah. It came down with a sound.
[41:28] But they describe it as a as a as a
[41:31] mighty rushing wind.
[41:34] Hallelujah.
[41:37] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[41:41] You know in the week the spirit said to
[41:45] me, hallelujah
[41:48] that there is a famine in the land and
[41:52] the famine is not for bread nor water
[41:56] but it's for hearing of the word of God.
[42:01] Hallelujah. When we look and see in the
[42:03] natural today and what is happening and
[42:06] see other countries, hallelujah, people
[42:09] are starving from the natural food.
[42:14] Everything that happens in the natural,
[42:16] it is happening in the spiritual. Yes,
[42:19] sir. Hallelujah. Glory to God. And the
[42:24] spirit said there's a famine in the
[42:26] land.
[42:28] Hallelujah. for hearing the word of God.
[42:33] I tell you, when there's a famine,
[42:35] there's a malnutrition.
[42:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Your body have a
[42:39] malnutrition.
[42:41] Glory to God. You Oh, there's a painful
[42:45] desire. Hallelujah. It's uncomfortable.
[42:49] Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. When
[42:52] you're hungry in the natural, you can't
[42:54] even sleep.
[42:56] You start to twist and turn and you're
[42:58] rubbing your belly. What about in the
[43:00] spiritual?
[43:02] Come on, saints. Come with me. What
[43:05] about in the spiritual? When you have a
[43:08] hallelujah, you're not supposed to
[43:10] sleep.
[43:12] Hallelujah.
[43:14] Homing can cause death in population.
[43:19] Jesus,
[43:20] it cause death in population. So is it
[43:23] in the spiritual when there's a famine
[43:26] for hear the word there is a death
[43:28] spiritual death people are dying. Amen.
[43:33] Hallelujah.
[43:35] People are dying.
[43:37] They have no joy. No peace. What is
[43:40] that? It's cost you famine. Come on. No
[43:44] joy. No peace.
[43:46] Hallelujah.
[43:48] Glory to God.
[43:50] And the word said, "Hallelujah." And the
[43:54] spirit said, "Hallelujah."
[43:56] After he tell me about the famine, he
[43:59] said, "Hallelujah. We're in the season
[44:02] of restoration."
[44:05] Even though there is a famine,
[44:07] hallelujah. God said, "I have created a
[44:11] season and the season is restoration."
[44:15] He said, "Heat in plenty.
[44:20] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Heat in
[44:23] plenty.
[44:25] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[44:30] Amen. Getting back to the word.
[44:35] Brother Paul here
[44:38] who was preaching to the Romans in
[44:40] Romans chapter 10. Right. We must
[44:43] understand, hallelujah, that brother
[44:46] Paul, he was not, hallelujah, among the
[44:50] 12 apostles, that was selected by Jesus
[44:54] Christ.
[44:56] He came he came in other than Caesar.
[45:00] He came off the word. Yes, sir.
[45:03] Hallelujah.
[45:05] And the Bible said while he was speaking
[45:08] to them, these people in Romans, they
[45:13] were considered hidden. They were
[45:16] considered idolattors.
[45:18] The Roman Empire, the Roman nation,
[45:21] there's many gods.
[45:23] Hallelujah.
[45:25] Oh, glory to God. But there were
[45:27] believers in Romans. Hallelujah. And
[45:31] brother Paul who was called by the will
[45:35] of God to be an apostle he said I
[45:39] magnify my office.
[45:42] Hallelujah.
[45:44] And God sent him to the Rome. And when
[45:47] he wrote the letter, Hallelujah.
[45:51] And he wrote the letter and he sent it
[45:52] to the believers there.
[45:55] Hallelujah. He said, "Faith covered by
[45:58] hearing. I know what you're going
[46:00] through. I know the persecution you are
[46:04] facing as a Christian because they were
[46:07] converted to Christian and they were
[46:11] suffering persecution.
[46:13] But the Paul said, "I know what you're
[46:14] going through. I know the battles you're
[46:17] facing." But he said, "Faith cometh by
[46:20] hearing and hearing the word of God."
[46:25] Hallelujah. And the word gives you
[46:28] victory. You can have victory over your
[46:31] sickness. You can have victory over your
[46:33] unbelief. You can have victory over your
[46:36] condition. You can have victory over
[46:39] your circumstances.
[46:42] Hallelujah.
[46:44] Because faith cometh by hearing and
[46:47] hearing the word of God. And if God said
[46:51] you shall not die, but you shall live
[46:54] and declare the works of the Lord.
[47:00] Hallelujah. If God say that and you hear
[47:03] it, you act upon what he said.
[47:07] Hallelujah. And when you hawk upon it,
[47:10] it means you receive it. And when you
[47:13] receive it, then another thing is to
[47:15] manifest it. Yes.
[47:19] Oh my god. You manifest what you
[47:23] receive.
[47:25] You cannot manifest something that you
[47:27] don't receive. You only can manifest
[47:29] what you receive. Jesus. Am I preaching
[47:33] this morning?
[47:36] Hallelujah.
[47:38] Glory to God.
[47:42] You know, let me just give you some
[47:45] things that brother Paul went through.
[47:49] As I said, he came after the apostles.
[47:52] But he al suffer many things.
[47:55] He suffered many things.
[47:58] Hallelujah.
[48:01] In the book of Romans 8 verse 18 he said
[48:04] for I for I brother Paul reckon
[48:09] that the suffering
[48:12] that of this present time is not worthy
[48:18] he's not worthy to be compared
[48:21] of the glory that shall be revealed in
[48:25] us hallelujah Jesus
[48:28] no other apostles
[48:30] have suffered more than well upon.
[48:35] You're talking about a man, he was
[48:38] lashed 40 times.
[48:42] 40 times.
[48:46] Hallelujah.
[48:48] That was the Jewish punishment. Wow. To
[48:51] lick to lash your 40 time,
[48:55] right?
[48:57] And Hallelujah. And he was five times.
[49:01] Five times he was lush 40 times. Wow.
[49:04] Jesus. My God.
[49:07] I wonder why he said I bear the mark of
[49:09] Christ in my body. Every time brother
[49:13] Paul looks see those mark. He said it is
[49:16] for Christ.
[49:20] It is for the Lord Christ. I bear the
[49:24] mark of Christ in my body.
[49:27] Jesus. None of us have ever experienced
[49:30] that. But somebody had to experience it
[49:33] so that you and me and you can be here
[49:37] today.
[49:41] Hallelujah.
[49:43] Jesus my God.
[49:45] He was beaten with rods three times.
[49:50] You ready?
[49:52] You ready? You want more? Amen.
[49:55] Hallelujah. He was stoned
[49:58] in so much that he almost died.
[50:03] Oh my God.
[50:06] Oh my lord.
[50:09] Hallelujah. But you know what? Purpose
[50:12] cannot be defeated. God had a purpose in
[50:16] Paul life. Can I say this? Though we are
[50:20] suffered in this time, God have a
[50:23] purpose in your life. And purpose cannot
[50:26] be defeated.
[50:31] Hallelujah.
[50:33] When he was stoned, he was left to
[50:36] death. Glory to God.
[50:40] They left him to death. Hallelujah.
[50:44] But he survived.
[50:46] He survived.
[50:49] Brother Paul, he had shipwrecks.
[50:53] He experienced three three shipwrecks.
[50:58] Oh my God.
[51:01] Hallelujah.
[51:03] One one of the shipwrecks involving a
[51:07] night and a day a drift at sea.
[51:11] Talking about your day in a sea. No
[51:13] land, nothing around you. All you see is
[51:17] water. Jesus.
[51:20] Hallelujah. These are the things that he
[51:22] he encountered.
[51:24] These are the things he suffered for the
[51:26] gospel.
[51:28] Remember what Jesus said to Annas. This
[51:32] man has many things to suffer
[51:34] because of my name's sake.
[51:38] Hallelujah.
[51:41] Can I say this? God measure your trials.
[51:46] God will not give you more than what you
[51:48] cannot bear.
[51:50] God knows exactly who you are. God knows
[51:54] how much you can handle. Hallelujah. And
[51:57] how much you cannot handle.
[52:00] Amen. He knows. He knows everything. If
[52:04] he did not know, he wouldn't be God.
[52:07] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You still love
[52:10] him?
[52:13] He was imprisonment.
[52:16] He was frequently in prison.
[52:20] one after the other.
[52:23] Oh God,
[52:26] he had hardship
[52:28] and deprivation.
[52:30] He endure hunger. He endure thirst, cold
[52:35] and sleep and sleepless. Hallelujah.
[52:40] Emotional.
[52:41] He has sleepless night.
[52:44] Hallelujah. He hunger. He felt cold.
[52:49] Jesus.
[52:52] But you know what he said? I have to
[52:55] manifest Christ.
[52:57] One of the time he said to the Galatian,
[53:00] he said, "Look here. I cannot leave you
[53:02] yet. I cannot leave you." He said,
[53:06] "Hallelujah." He said, "Not until I see
[53:08] Christ be formed in you." Jesus, my God.
[53:13] Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[53:15] He even though the flesh wanted to leave
[53:17] he said I cannot leave I must see Christ
[53:21] form in you when I see Christ form in
[53:24] you then I know that's when my purpose
[53:27] is been fulfilled
[53:32] so if if I have to suffer for 10 more
[53:34] years I will suffer for the gospel sake
[53:40] because I want to see Christ form in you
[53:44] sir
[53:45] Can can I say this? Sometimes many
[53:49] people have so they're so fix fixated
[53:53] with heaven on their mind. Yes, sir.
[53:56] Yes, sir. Hallelujah. With heaven on
[53:58] their mind, they don't even realize they
[54:00] have work here on the earth to do.
[54:07] Hallelujah.
[54:09] Let me say this without apology.
[54:13] We cannot leave until we accomplish our
[54:16] work.
[54:17] [Applause]
[54:20] Hallelujah.
[54:23] Hearing, receiving, and manifesting.
[54:27] Hallelujah.
[54:28] The body is Christ representative on the
[54:33] earth.
[54:34] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. The body of Christ
[54:38] is the light of God upon the hurt.
[54:42] The body is the way. The body is the
[54:45] truth and the life.
[54:51] Hallelujah.
[54:53] You want more.
[54:56] Hallelujah.
[54:58] When we understand all of these things,
[55:02] brother Paul, Hallelujah.
[55:04] He faced opposition from both Jews and
[55:09] Gentiles.
[55:12] Hallelujah.
[55:14] As well as false brethren within the
[55:17] church.
[55:19] You know that there were so many false
[55:20] brethren within the church. They want to
[55:23] bring back the Judaism. Brother Paul
[55:26] said no. Hallelujah. One time,
[55:30] hallelujah, brother Paul find a young
[55:32] man called Timotei and he fell in love
[55:36] with Timotei. But Timotei mother was a
[55:39] Jew and his father was a Greek.
[55:43] Hallelujah. And they said, "Oh no, you
[55:46] have to be circumcised in order for us
[55:48] to accept you in the faith."
[55:53] What faith?
[55:55] The faith, hallelujah, was not according
[55:57] to Romans 10 verse 17.
[56:01] Hallelujah. That faith was according to
[56:04] Romans 10 verse1 17. Right?
[56:07] That faith was about the Jewish
[56:10] religion.
[56:13] It was a religion.
[56:15] Hallelujah. Now, brother Paul talk about
[56:19] in times past, you know, I suffered
[56:22] under the Jewish religion.
[56:28] Hallelujah.
[56:31] Glory to God.
[56:33] And because of what brother Paul to
[56:36] Timothy and circumcised him because he
[56:41] knew that they would not accept him.
[56:45] Jesus my God. Hallelujah.
[56:51] Glory to God.
[56:55] Brother Paul,
[56:57] he carried the burden of responsibility
[57:01] for the well-being and spiritual growth
[57:05] of the churches he established.
[57:08] No other I no other apostle emphasize so
[57:12] much on growth as brother Paul.
[57:16] He emphasized so much on growth. Growth
[57:20] is important. Amen.
[57:23] Hallelujah.
[57:25] Glory to God.
[57:30] The word hearing
[57:34] it means glory to God to be endowed with
[57:39] the faculty of hearing.
[57:43] It means to attend to.
[57:47] It means to consider.
[57:50] It means hallelujah to understand
[57:56] Jesus.
[57:57] You know that was a big problem that
[58:00] Jesus had with them.
[58:04] Turn your Bibles to St. John 10. St.
[58:07] John's 8 should say. Oh God, we're going
[58:11] to preach this morning. Amen.
[58:14] Hallelujah. Don't get cold on me this
[58:16] morning. Hallelujah.
[58:20] Glory to God. God have a word for us.
[58:23] Yes, sir.
[58:25] Hallelujah. St. John 8,
[58:30] you know, when it comes to the word, I
[58:32] love the word. Amen.
[58:34] And remember St. John 8 verse 42. But
[58:40] but look at verse 31st
[58:43] so that you can have understanding
[58:46] of the people that Jesus was dealing
[58:50] with.
[58:52] St. John 8:30
[58:54] as he spake these words.
[58:57] Many believe on him.
[59:02] You see it? They believe. Did they
[59:05] receive him? No. No, they believe but
[59:09] they did not receive him.
[59:12] We're going to come to that. Remember
[59:13] the topic hearing, receiving, and
[59:17] manifesting.
[59:20] Let me say this. Let me just drop this
[59:22] in before I go even further. Even the
[59:24] devil believe on God. Yes, sir. He does.
[59:29] If you know the Bible, the Bible said
[59:31] the devil believe that there's one God
[59:33] and he trembles. Trembles. Amen.
[59:38] Oh my God.
[59:42] Yes sir. Verse 31. Then said Jesus to
[59:47] those Jews. Look at it. Jews.
[59:51] In this time there were two kingdoms.
[59:53] Yeah. You have the kingdom of Israel.
[59:56] Yeah. And the kingdom of Judah, right?
[1:00:01] The kingdom of of the kingdom of Judah
[1:00:04] consists of two and a half tribe.
[1:00:07] And the kingdom of Israel consists of
[1:00:09] nine and a half tribe.
[1:00:12] So so these person that were considered
[1:00:14] Jews, they were of Judah.
[1:00:19] And in order for Jesus to go to Israel,
[1:00:21] he had to pass over Jordan. Right.
[1:00:26] Jesus did most of his ministry in Jew in
[1:00:31] Jerusalem.
[1:00:33] But he wasn't brought up in Jerusalem.
[1:00:35] He was brought up in the kingdom of
[1:00:37] Israel.
[1:00:39] Because Bethlehem comes from Israel,
[1:00:42] right?
[1:00:43] Hallelujah.
[1:00:46] Glory to God.
[1:00:48] Talking about Galilee.
[1:00:51] Galilee. He was brought up in Galilee.
[1:00:53] Yes. Yes. And Galilee located in Israel
[1:00:58] kingdom in Israel providence.
[1:01:01] Hallelujah.
[1:01:05] And the Bible said
[1:01:08] he said to them that believe. Now
[1:01:11] remember the Bible said they believe on
[1:01:14] him.
[1:01:16] So because you believe
[1:01:18] Hallelujah. Look at this now. Because
[1:01:21] you believe.
[1:01:22] Hallelujah.
[1:01:24] You have to continue.
[1:01:28] If you continue in my word,
[1:01:33] sir, this this word is mean divine
[1:01:37] utterance.
[1:01:38] If you con, if you continue in my divine
[1:01:42] utterance, the word continue means to
[1:01:45] abide. It means to stay. It means to
[1:01:49] remain.
[1:01:51] Jesus my God. Hallelujah.
[1:01:56] He said then are you my disciples
[1:02:00] indeed. Jesus. Isn't that the Bible?
[1:02:04] Yeah. So if you don't continue, how can
[1:02:07] you be the disciples indeed? Yes sir.
[1:02:12] Now we understand where Mark 16 said,
[1:02:16] hallelujah. He that believeth and is
[1:02:19] baptized shall be Jesus Christ. You see
[1:02:24] that word shall be? It's a big big big
[1:02:27] statement.
[1:02:29] Hallelujah.
[1:02:31] Shall be. That word shall be mean going
[1:02:34] unto. That's right. Jesus
[1:02:38] shall be saved.
[1:02:43] Oh my God. He said verse 32. And you
[1:02:51] the disciples indeed know you know it
[1:02:54] takes the disciples indeed to know the
[1:02:56] truth.
[1:02:59] Hallelujah.
[1:03:01] Glory to God. Verse 32. And you shall
[1:03:05] know the truth
[1:03:08] and the truth make you free.
[1:03:13] That word know you have to recognize it.
[1:03:15] Right. Recognize the day and its message
[1:03:19] and its day.
[1:03:23] Recognize the day, the message and the
[1:03:26] messenger.
[1:03:27] Jesus was the messenger for their day.
[1:03:30] Right. Yes, sir. He was the angel of the
[1:03:34] covenant for their day. But they did not
[1:03:37] recognize him. That's why I said if you
[1:03:39] don't believe that I am he, you shall
[1:03:42] die in your sins. And that sins is
[1:03:45] speaking of unbelief.
[1:03:47] The sins was a fornication. It was
[1:03:50] adulterous. These are just attribute of
[1:03:53] sin. Sin is unbelief. Amen. The Bible
[1:03:57] said after his resurrection and he
[1:04:00] appeared before them in the room, he
[1:04:02] said the Bible said he obeed them
[1:04:04] because of their unbelief. Amen. Right.
[1:04:08] Yeah.
[1:04:10] Unbelief.
[1:04:12] Hallelujah.
[1:04:14] Many times we see people today, they're
[1:04:18] still trapped in the unbelief.
[1:04:21] And because they're still trapped in the
[1:04:23] unbelief, that's why they're still not
[1:04:26] yet free.
[1:04:27] Wow. Jesus. My God.
[1:04:31] Hallelujah.
[1:04:35] Look at verse 23.
[1:04:38] And they answered him. We be Abraham's
[1:04:41] seed. Oh,
[1:04:45] look at it now. He said, "You shall know
[1:04:47] the truth and the truth shall make you
[1:04:49] free." Right? Here what they said. Now
[1:04:52] look at these. You see typical religious
[1:04:54] people.
[1:04:56] Religious people. Look at this response.
[1:04:58] Shows you that this is a religious
[1:05:00] response.
[1:05:03] will be Abraham's seed and were never in
[1:05:07] bondage. God God to any manow
[1:05:14] sayest thou you shall be made free
[1:05:18] Jesus my God. Hallelujah. Look at that
[1:05:23] religious response to Jesus.
[1:05:26] All right. Amen. Jump down to verse 43.
[1:05:30] Hallelujah.
[1:05:32] Verse 43. Why do you not understand my
[1:05:36] speech? Jesus asks a question and he's
[1:05:40] going to answer them. Even because you
[1:05:43] cannot hear my word.
[1:05:46] They had this.
[1:05:48] Hallelujah. They had this but they
[1:05:51] cannot hear.
[1:05:54] They couldn't hear his word. His word
[1:05:57] was a divine utterance. Amen. It was a
[1:06:01] divine speech
[1:06:04] but they could not they could not hear
[1:06:06] it.
[1:06:08] Hallelujah.
[1:06:09] Because they didn't have the faculty.
[1:06:13] They didn't have the faculty to
[1:06:15] understand it.
[1:06:17] It takes a seed of God because the word
[1:06:21] of faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:06:25] the word of God
[1:06:27] and faith is a seed. say takes the seed
[1:06:31] to hear.
[1:06:33] Yes, sir.
[1:06:35] Hallelujah.
[1:06:38] Oh, glory to God.
[1:06:41] He said, you cannot hear my word.
[1:06:46] Verse 47,
[1:06:49] he that is of God heareth God's word.
[1:06:53] Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:06:55] He therefore hear them not because
[1:06:57] you're not of God.
[1:07:01] Hallelujah.
[1:07:03] You hear that?
[1:07:05] So no matter where, if you're in the pig
[1:07:08] pen and when God speak, if you are of
[1:07:11] God, you will hear.
[1:07:14] If you are under the sea and God speak,
[1:07:18] if you are of God, you will hear. Amen.
[1:07:22] No matter where you are, nothing can
[1:07:25] stop you from hearing God's word. Amen.
[1:07:29] Jesus, my Lord. Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:07:33] No barriers, no boundaries can stop it.
[1:07:36] Hallelujah.
[1:07:38] No boundary can stop you from hearing
[1:07:41] God's word.
[1:07:44] Hallelujah. Because there's something
[1:07:46] inside of you. There is something inside
[1:07:49] of you. And when you hear you responded,
[1:07:53] it bring out a responding to that
[1:07:55] hearing and you start to follow. My
[1:07:59] sheep hear my voice.
[1:08:04] Hallelujah.
[1:08:06] John 10:27.
[1:08:08] My sheep hear my voice and I know them
[1:08:13] Jesus.
[1:08:15] and a stranger voice they hear not and
[1:08:19] they follow me.
[1:08:24] Hallelujah. So whether you're suffering,
[1:08:27] whether you're being persecuted,
[1:08:30] nothing can stop you from following
[1:08:32] Christ.
[1:08:34] [Applause]
[1:08:35] As the word of God said, nothing can
[1:08:38] able to separate you from the love of
[1:08:40] God that is in Christ Jesus. No peril,
[1:08:44] no pestilence, no famine, no sword,
[1:08:48] nothing can separate you. Thank you,
[1:08:50] Lord.
[1:08:52] Hallelujah.
[1:08:54] Because there's something inside of you.
[1:08:57] Hallelujah. The songwriter said,
[1:08:59] "There's something inside of me telling
[1:09:02] me to go on, to go on. You're pressing
[1:09:06] on because God is pulling you."
[1:09:10] Hallelujah.
[1:09:13] Jesus, my Lord.
[1:09:15] So, you know, but I tell you, don't
[1:09:17] complain to God about the environment
[1:09:19] you're in.
[1:09:21] You know, you know, we like to complain
[1:09:24] a lot. If we are in a certain home and
[1:09:27] things are not going on good, we start
[1:09:29] to complain.
[1:09:31] If God put us in a certain job,
[1:09:33] Hallelujah. and we don't like it, we
[1:09:35] complain.
[1:09:37] If God pull us or give us a a type of
[1:09:39] vehicle and the vehicle is giving
[1:09:41] trouble, we start to complain. You know,
[1:09:44] we complain too much, it's time we stop
[1:09:47] complain and start to give God some
[1:09:49] worship.
[1:09:52] Hallelujah.
[1:09:54] Give God some worship. Hallelujah.
[1:09:58] Hallelujah. Oh, I'm tired of this home.
[1:10:02] Hallelujah. Everything is falling apart
[1:10:04] in this home.
[1:10:05] Hallelujah.
[1:10:08] If we just understand
[1:10:11] the power of praise,
[1:10:14] if we just understand the power of
[1:10:15] praise, do you know that your praise,
[1:10:19] Hallelujah, your praise, your
[1:10:21] revelation,
[1:10:23] your understanding of the word can speak
[1:10:27] things into existence.
[1:10:29] Yes sir.
[1:10:32] Jesus my the other day I was the Lord
[1:10:36] gave me a topic.
[1:10:39] The Lord give me a topic and the topic
[1:10:42] is five manifestation of the faith that
[1:10:47] was given unto the saints.
[1:10:49] Five manifestation of the faith.
[1:10:54] Man, when I when that when the Lord gave
[1:10:56] me that topic, I said my God.
[1:10:59] Hallelujah. I was so excited.
[1:11:03] Five manifestation.
[1:11:06] One of the one of the manifestation is
[1:11:08] salvation.
[1:11:10] Salvation is a twofold coming out of and
[1:11:13] going into
[1:11:15] Jesus my God. One of the other
[1:11:18] manifestation of the faith is
[1:11:20] resurrection. Right.
[1:11:24] resurrection. Jesus said, "I am the
[1:11:26] resurrection and the life." Jeez. Amen.
[1:11:31] I don't want to jump into that topic.
[1:11:33] Let me just get back to the topic.
[1:11:36] That is for another time.
[1:11:38] Hallelujah. You know, sometimes we get
[1:11:41] excited. We can get carried away. Glory
[1:11:44] to God. Hallelujah. You still love him.
[1:11:48] Hallelujah. So hear it.
[1:11:52] You have the difficulty to understand
[1:11:54] because there's a seed in you.
[1:12:00] Hallelujah. And you know that when when
[1:12:02] the seed of God in you, there's a
[1:12:04] frequency.
[1:12:06] There's a a communication between you
[1:12:09] and the spirit.
[1:12:11] Not even the person beside you can know
[1:12:14] it.
[1:12:15] No wonder why the father said,
[1:12:17] "Hallelujah. Glory to God. The spirit
[1:12:20] beth witness with your spirit that we
[1:12:24] are the sons of God. Thank you, Lord
[1:12:26] Jesus. Hallelujah. God, because there's
[1:12:30] a frequency Yes, sir. that even the
[1:12:32] person beside you can testify that you
[1:12:35] are sons of God. But the spirit bear
[1:12:38] witness with your spirit. Oh, thank you,
[1:12:41] Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:12:44] Glory to God. Receive
[1:12:49] The word receive, hallelujah,
[1:12:53] it comes from the Greek word the trauma
[1:12:56] which mean to take with the hand.
[1:13:00] Hallelujah.
[1:13:02] It means to take hold of.
[1:13:05] It means to take up.
[1:13:08] Hallelujah. It means to embrace.
[1:13:13] It means approve. See you look at that
[1:13:16] word approve.
[1:13:18] Approve.
[1:13:20] You know that when God approve you, when
[1:13:23] God approve you, nobody can stop you.
[1:13:29] Saints of God. I'm going to deal with
[1:13:32] some spirit here. Hallelujah. When you
[1:13:35] are being approved by God, nothing can
[1:13:39] stop you. Do you know that God approve
[1:13:42] you? Amen.
[1:13:44] God approve you
[1:13:47] the Bible said hallelujah. He said
[1:13:50] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:13:53] that is in the world. What is that
[1:13:56] greater? That's God approval of you.
[1:13:59] It's God approve you.
[1:14:02] Hallelujah. Greater than he that is in
[1:14:04] the world.
[1:14:06] What are the things that in the world
[1:14:07] that is coming to get rid of you that
[1:14:09] are your enemy? sickness, diseases,
[1:14:12] death, these things. And God say
[1:14:15] something greater inside of you.
[1:14:19] Hallelujah.
[1:14:24] You know in Jamaica,
[1:14:26] in Jamaica, when we want a letter from a
[1:14:28] JP or a pastor,
[1:14:31] they have to put their stamp, their seal
[1:14:33] on it, meaning I approved this document.
[1:14:37] I have verified it. I I approve that you
[1:14:41] can trust him.
[1:14:43] I approve that is what what he say he
[1:14:46] is. He's that person. When God send the
[1:14:50] Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. It's God
[1:14:53] approval that I approve you to be sons
[1:14:57] and daughters of God.
[1:15:01] Hallelujah.
[1:15:03] God approve you that you can speak to
[1:15:05] this mountain. be now removed. Thank
[1:15:09] you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:15:13] Glory to God. Praise the Lord. When God
[1:15:16] approve you, you know that evil heaven
[1:15:19] back you.
[1:15:21] Evil heaven back what you said. Amen.
[1:15:24] Elijah said no rain until I
[1:15:30] until I say so.
[1:15:32] Jesus.
[1:15:34] Hallelujah.
[1:15:35] This was a man but he knows what he
[1:15:39] possess. Yes sir. The king said who are
[1:15:42] you? How can how can you say no until
[1:15:45] you say so? Who you think you be? Is the
[1:15:47] same thing that they said to Jesus. Who
[1:15:49] give you this authority to forgive sin?
[1:15:53] He said even the son of power.
[1:15:56] Yes sir.
[1:15:58] Hallelujah.
[1:15:59] He said no rain until I say so because
[1:16:03] God approve him. That's right.
[1:16:06] Hallelujah.
[1:16:10] Another thing, when you're approved by
[1:16:12] God, you're not rejected.
[1:16:15] So when you feel like you're sick, don't
[1:16:18] listen to the enemy that feel like your
[1:16:20] prayer is being rejected. That's a lie.
[1:16:25] When you approve you're not rejected.
[1:16:27] Amen. Don't you pray. Brother Paul had
[1:16:30] to pray because he had a thorn in the
[1:16:32] flesh. Right. That was one of the
[1:16:33] suffering.
[1:16:36] Hallelujah. That was one of his
[1:16:38] suffering. But he said this suffering,
[1:16:40] Hallelujah. He is not worthy to compare
[1:16:45] of the glory that shall be revealed in
[1:16:48] me.
[1:16:49] Hallelujah.
[1:16:51] Glory to God. So many times many times
[1:16:56] we feel like our prayers been rejected
[1:16:59] but our prayers is not rejected because
[1:17:02] you approved by God. Yes. Hallelujah. We
[1:17:05] need to shift the moment. We need to
[1:17:08] shift the scene and start to worship
[1:17:11] God.
[1:17:12] We start to give some praise. We need to
[1:17:15] shift the atmosphere.
[1:17:17] We need to shift it. You know sometimes
[1:17:20] if you feel like your prayer is not
[1:17:22] going nowhere in the home, you need to
[1:17:25] take the you need to give the home a
[1:17:26] walk. You need to go outside, walk
[1:17:29] around the house, start to pray, and
[1:17:33] even if you have to go in your vehicle,
[1:17:35] just get in the vehicle. You just need
[1:17:37] to change
[1:17:39] the mood. God said to John, "John, come
[1:17:43] and take the book." God had to leave
[1:17:46] from where he was to go and take the
[1:17:49] book. So sometimes we just need a little
[1:17:51] changing. We need a change. We need to
[1:17:54] change the mood.
[1:17:59] Oh,
[1:18:01] sometimes God said you're laying down
[1:18:03] too much. Sometimes it's it's time it's
[1:18:06] time to rise up. It's time to walk. It's
[1:18:10] time to it's time to march.
[1:18:12] Sometime we're standing up praying and
[1:18:14] God said I don't want you to stand up. I
[1:18:17] want you to march.
[1:18:20] Hallelujah.
[1:18:22] Glory to God. I want you to march around
[1:18:25] Jericho seven times.
[1:18:29] Hallelujah.
[1:18:31] Marching time.
[1:18:33] Lord have mercy. Hallelujah.
[1:18:38] You are approved by God. That's right.
[1:18:41] Amen.
[1:18:43] What the script? Let's find what the
[1:18:44] scripture said about being of proof.
[1:18:48] John 1 verse 12.
[1:18:52] Hallelujah.
[1:18:56] Oh, praise God.
[1:18:59] Amen. John 1:12.
[1:19:01] But as many as receive him,
[1:19:06] as many that as take with the hand,
[1:19:12] as take a hold of.
[1:19:15] Hallelujah.
[1:19:17] As many that has give here to
[1:19:21] as many that as make one's home.
[1:19:25] Hallelujah.
[1:19:28] To them, to them gave he power. Jesus
[1:19:33] might. Amen. God.
[1:19:36] What is this power?
[1:19:38] The power is the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:44] The power of God is the Holy Ghost. In
[1:19:48] Acts chapter one, Jesus said, "Do not
[1:19:51] leave Jerusalem until you receive power
[1:19:54] from an eye." Amen.
[1:19:56] What did they receive? The Holy Ghost.
[1:20:00] The Holy Ghost they receive. So the
[1:20:03] power of God is the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:08] Hallelujah.
[1:20:10] No wonder why brother Paul said even
[1:20:13] faith is your victory.
[1:20:16] Hallelujah. And we have overcome the
[1:20:19] world. Why faith?
[1:20:21] Because faith is our victory.
[1:20:25] Hallelujah.
[1:20:29] To them gave him power to become the
[1:20:32] sons of God. Hallelujah. Thank God I can
[1:20:36] say I'm one of them. I am one of them.
[1:20:41] Hallelujah.
[1:20:43] Oh, praise God. You know, when you're
[1:20:45] one of them, you must be glad.
[1:20:49] You must be glad and you must rejoice in
[1:20:51] the Lord.
[1:20:53] Jesus, my God.
[1:20:56] You know, something just dropped in my
[1:20:58] spirit.
[1:21:00] You know,
[1:21:02] if we just learn to praise God and
[1:21:06] worship him, when you're going in spite
[1:21:10] of everything that you're going through,
[1:21:12] Yes, sir. When you start to, it will
[1:21:15] confuse the devil. That's right. Did you
[1:21:18] know? Did you know when God sent them to
[1:21:21] go fight against the enemy, hallelujah,
[1:21:24] there was just praising. All they all
[1:21:26] they bring as the the the weapon or the
[1:21:29] tool you would say was instrument of
[1:21:31] praise.
[1:21:34] Instrument of praise. It brought
[1:21:36] confusion in the camp of the enemy.
[1:21:38] There was wonder what is happening.
[1:21:42] Amen.
[1:21:44] Your praise. God will use your praise to
[1:21:47] defeat the enemy.
[1:21:50] God will use it to confound the enemy.
[1:21:56] Jesus. My God. Thank you, Lord. No
[1:21:59] wonder why the Bible say God he dwelt.
[1:22:01] He dwelt in the praise of his people. He
[1:22:04] dwelt in the praise of his people. And
[1:22:07] that's why I hear somebody say when the
[1:22:09] praises go up, the blessing comes down.
[1:22:13] Hallelujah. The blessing comes down.
[1:22:17] Two things. You can have the blessing
[1:22:20] comes down and you can go up there to
[1:22:22] meet the blessing.
[1:22:26] Hallelujah. You're talking about two
[1:22:29] dimension.
[1:22:30] Two dimension. The blessings come down
[1:22:34] and you have to go up there to get the
[1:22:36] blessings. Amen.
[1:22:39] The Bible said in Ephesians 1,
[1:22:41] hallelujah, he has blessed us with all
[1:22:44] spiritual blessings in heavenly places.
[1:22:47] Amen.
[1:22:49] In heavenly places.
[1:22:52] So there's two blessings, right?
[1:22:54] Hallelujah. Right here. And you can go
[1:22:57] in heavenly places. Oh God. Amen. Isn't
[1:23:02] that the word?
[1:23:05] Amen.
[1:23:07] Hallelujah.
[1:23:09] So now you receive the power.
[1:23:13] And when you receive the power, it's
[1:23:15] time to manifest.
[1:23:19] It's time to manifest.
[1:23:22] When what are you supposed to manifest?
[1:23:25] Manifest some faith.
[1:23:28] Manifest some patience.
[1:23:31] You know, sometimes, hallelujah, we have
[1:23:33] some sometimes we can have problems with
[1:23:35] with one another. And God said, I want
[1:23:37] you to manifest some patience. Be
[1:23:39] patient with your brother. Be patient
[1:23:41] with your sister. Be patient with your
[1:23:43] husband. Be patient with your wife. Be
[1:23:45] patient with your children. God said, I
[1:23:48] want to see some manifestation of
[1:23:51] patience.
[1:23:53] Hallelujah.
[1:23:55] He said, "I want to see some
[1:23:57] manifestation.
[1:23:59] Manifest some patience.
[1:24:01] Manifest patience with your church.
[1:24:04] Manifest patience with your brothers.
[1:24:07] Manifest patience with your sisters."
[1:24:09] Amen. Jesus. Hallelujah. He said, "I
[1:24:13] want to see some patience manifest."
[1:24:16] Amen. Glory to God.
[1:24:19] Hallelujah.
[1:24:21] Glory to Jesus.
[1:24:25] manifest.
[1:24:29] Oh God.
[1:24:32] Galation. Galatians 5.
[1:24:38] Oh, praise the Lord. I tell you, I won't
[1:24:41] just few more minutes. I won't finish
[1:24:43] this.
[1:24:46] Hallelujah.
[1:24:48] I won't finish this
[1:24:51] because I have to bring in I have to
[1:24:55] bring in Romans 8 into this. When the
[1:24:58] Bible said the world cre the world
[1:25:00] creation is groaning and waiting for the
[1:25:04] manifestation
[1:25:05] of the sons of God.
[1:25:09] The world is waiting.
[1:25:11] [Laughter]
[1:25:14] Hallelujah. I may not get the time to
[1:25:16] jump into that, but that is important.
[1:25:21] That's right. Hallelujah.
[1:25:23] Galatian 5.
[1:25:25] [Music]
[1:25:28] But the fruit hallelujah of the spirit
[1:25:32] because you receive power now. It's
[1:25:34] telling you
[1:25:37] the fruit of the spirit.
[1:25:40] Glory to God.
[1:25:42] Look at this now.
[1:25:45] is love. Did you know that love has to
[1:25:49] be manifest? You can't hide it. Love is
[1:25:53] something that you cannot hide. Jesus
[1:25:56] Christ.
[1:25:58] Hallelujah.
[1:25:59] Is there any husband in here? Is there
[1:26:02] any husband?
[1:26:04] Can you hide love from your wife? You
[1:26:07] don't You don't hide it. You manifest
[1:26:09] it. Wives is the same thing. You don't
[1:26:12] hide love, you manifest it. Jesus.
[1:26:19] Glory.
[1:26:21] Hallelujah.
[1:26:24] You manifest love.
[1:26:29] You have to manifest joy.
[1:26:33] Job, where were you?
[1:26:36] Job, where were you when the sons of God
[1:26:40] shouted for joy?
[1:26:43] Where are you, Job?
[1:26:45] When you have joy inside of you, you
[1:26:47] cannot sit quiet. You got to pray. You
[1:26:50] got to manifest it.
[1:26:52] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. G Jesus my Lord.

[1:27:13] And for the word.
[1:27:16] Hallelujah.
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:21] Peace.
[1:27:23] Peace is something you manifest.
[1:27:26] Blessed are the peacemakers,
[1:27:29] for they shall be called the children of
[1:27:32] God. Yeah.
[1:27:35] Oh, peace is something that you
[1:27:37] manifest.
[1:27:39] You hear, you receive and manifest.

[1:27:48] manifest all of these things?
[1:27:50] He did. He did. He manifest them.
[1:27:54] Hallelujah. And the Bible said the
[1:27:57] church,
[1:27:58] the church, Paul said, I show you a
[1:28:01] mystery concerning Christ and the
[1:28:04] church.
[1:28:07] He said the church is bone of his bone
[1:28:10] and flesh of his flesh. Jesus. Ephesians
[1:28:14] chapter 5. Hallelujah.
[1:28:17] So the same characteristics that is in
[1:28:20] Christ has to be in the church. Amen.

[1:28:27] did, we have to do the same work, sir.
[1:28:32] I don't believe less. I don't believe
[1:28:35] less. The same thing that he did, I
[1:28:38] believe that we must do it and even
[1:28:40] more. Even more.
[1:28:46] Hallelujah.
[1:28:48] Glory to God.
[1:28:52] Sometimes my brother, some people need
[1:28:54] some peace, right? Some home. All they
[1:28:58] see is just be fighting. Be fighting.
[1:29:02] But God say you have peace inside of
[1:29:04] you. Just walk over there and just give
[1:29:07] them.
[1:29:08] Give them for such as I have I give Ie.
[1:29:14] Hallelujah.
[1:29:16] Do you know that the Holy Ghost is not
[1:29:18] for you only? The Holy God never give
[1:29:21] you the Holy Ghost for yourself.
[1:29:24] He give you the Holy Ghost to give. Is
[1:29:27] to give.
[1:29:30] Jesus. My God. Thank you, Lord. No
[1:29:32] wonder why the Bible say breathe on
[1:29:34] them. Receive ye the Holy Ghost. Yes
[1:29:37] sir. Receive ye the Holy Ghost. It was
[1:29:40] to give. Hallelujah. It is to give.
[1:29:46] Oh God.
[1:29:49] Hallelujah. Just taking two more from
[1:29:52] this.
[1:29:54] Longsuffering.
[1:29:55] Oh my God. This is something that
[1:30:00] we fail. We fail. We fail to give each
[1:30:04] other longsuffering.
[1:30:07] Hallelujah.
[1:30:08] If something if we if we drop something
[1:30:11] out of the garbage bin, we kick we kick
[1:30:14] them aside. We don't want to long
[1:30:16] suffer.
[1:30:19] But God longsuffer with Israel for 40
[1:30:22] years.
[1:30:24] For 40 years. Hallelujah.
[1:30:29] We have to longsuffer.
[1:30:32] I have some friends, you know, I love
[1:30:34] them. I talk to them about the word.
[1:30:37] They don't want to come. But you know
[1:30:39] what? I have to long suffer with them.
[1:30:42] Have to long suffer. Hallelujah.
[1:30:46] You know, and sometimes I feel like I'm
[1:30:48] getting too impatient. I say, "God,
[1:30:51] remove that. Remove that. Let me be
[1:30:54] patient. Let me long suffer some more."
[1:30:58] Hallelujah. Because you know, everything
[1:31:01] has a time and and season. To
[1:31:04] everything. There's a time and season.
[1:31:08] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:31:12] longsuffer

[1:31:25] rude. Oh, mercy to God. We don't want to
[1:31:29] be gentle with them.

[1:31:49] Talking about manifest goodness, right?
[1:31:52] Hallelujah. When you manifest goodness
[1:31:54] to people. Hallelujah. Because the Bible
[1:31:57] said all that was in Christ,
[1:32:01] he poured into the church. You
[1:32:04] understand? What was in him? Goodness.
[1:32:06] All of these things were in him. Amen.

[1:32:11] us to manifest it. Manifest some
[1:32:14] goodness to your neighbor. Manifest some
[1:32:16] goodness to each other. Hallelujah.
[1:32:19] No wonder why the Bible said, brother
[1:32:21] David said, "Surely and surely goodness
[1:32:24] and mercy and mercy shall follow me."
[1:32:28] You know sometimes where the mercy
[1:32:30] coming from? It has to come from you.
[1:32:32] Yeah.
[1:32:34] Where the goodness is coming from, it
[1:32:36] has to come from you. When you express
[1:32:39] goodness to me, it is following me. When
[1:32:43] you express mercy, it is following me.
[1:32:46] Hallelujah.
[1:32:48] Glory. Surely goodness and mercy shall
[1:32:52] follow me all the days of my life. And I
[1:32:56] will dwell in the house of the Lord
[1:33:00] forever. Amen. because your goodness and
[1:33:02] mercy have follow me. It drives me to
[1:33:05] dwell in the house of the Lord.

[1:39:17] I'm young

[1:39:24] [Music]
[1:39:30] [Music]
[1:39:32] I

[1:40:04] hallelujah.
[1:40:06] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Praise the
[1:40:08] Lord. God is so good. Amen. You know, I
[1:40:11] was thinking when brother Junior was
[1:40:13] ministering
[1:40:15] and he was saying all the things that
[1:40:16] Paul had went through, you know, us as
[1:40:19] believers next Sunday, Lord willing, I'm
[1:40:21] going to preach on our choices. You
[1:40:24] know, Elijah said to the people there,
[1:40:27] he said, "Choose you this day
[1:40:30] between Balum and God." Amen. You know,
[1:40:34] Paul made a choice to go back for that
[1:40:36] second straps. He made a choice to take
[1:40:40] the third straps. He made a choice to be
[1:40:44] thrown into prison. He made a calculated
[1:40:48] choice
[1:40:49] that I'll serve my God. You know, in the
[1:40:52] Bible it says, "Choose you this day. Do
[1:40:55] you but for me and my house, I'll take
[1:40:57] the stripes. I'll take the stripes this
[1:41:00] time. I'll take them next time. I'll
[1:41:03] take the prison time." Yes, Lord. Amen.
[1:41:06] as long as we can see Christ manifested.
[1:41:09] Amen. That's just that's amazing. Amen.
[1:41:12] God is so good. It was just it was so
[1:41:14] good. You know, his brother Junior was
[1:41:16] closing there on praise. You know, Paul
[1:41:18] was through in prison, Paul and Silas.
[1:41:20] Yeah. And they were in stocks in the
[1:41:24] inner chamber. And because of praise, it
[1:41:28] shook the foundation of the jail.
[1:41:33] Now, they weren't in a situation where
[1:41:35] praise came easy. There was no
[1:41:37] musicians, no pianos, no tambourines, no
[1:41:41] drums, no orchestra, no choir,
[1:41:45] jail rats,
[1:41:47] they refuse not to praise God. That's
[1:41:49] just amazing. Our choices, our choices
[1:41:52] bring circumstances.
[1:41:54] It will shake our prison walls. It'll
[1:41:56] it'll shake your foundation, Lord. And
[1:41:59] God will just pour down the blessings.
[1:42:02] Unbelievable
[1:42:04] on your choices. He's waiting on who do
[1:42:06] you choose. He's He's just waiting to
[1:42:09] dump the blessings. But he's saying what
[1:42:12] what what did he say to Moses? What do
[1:42:14] you say? Amen. He said that to our
[1:42:17] prophet. What do you say? I'm waiting to
[1:42:19] say what do you say?
[1:42:21] To the ones that were were sinning in
[1:42:24] the front pew. So, I'm waiting to What
[1:42:26] do you say? Amen. Oh, it's beautiful.
[1:42:28] Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we just praise
[1:42:30] you for your word. And Lord, we pray
[1:42:33] praise you for all the attributes here.
[1:42:35] We see it at the end of the love and
[1:42:37] patience and peace and long suffering
[1:42:39] and and gentleness and all these things,
[1:42:42] Lord Jesus, that were in you that you
[1:42:44] put in us that will we we can't stop
[1:42:48] them from flowing out. Lord God, we just
[1:42:51] praise your name. And Lord, we ask you
[1:42:53] to bless Brother Junior, our friend and
[1:42:55] your servant. Lord Jesus, bring them
[1:42:57] strength and and bless them, Lord God.
[1:43:00] And and just the word that came forth
[1:43:02] was just such an encouragement. Lord
[1:43:04] God, bless your name, Lord Jesus. We
[1:43:07] love you, Lord. Be with our fellowship.
[1:43:09] Thank you for our visitors and Max and
[1:43:12] his family being with us today and and
[1:43:14] and all of us. Lord God, we pray you'll
[1:43:16] be with our fellowship. Bless the
[1:43:18] remainder of our day, Lord God. And
[1:43:20] thank you for safety. Thank you for
[1:43:23] amazing grace. Thank you for mercy on
[1:43:26] me, Lord God. Thank you for being
[1:43:28] longsuffering. Yes. Thank you, Lord God,
[1:43:31] for all your goodness. We love you
[1:43:34] abundantly. In your name we pray. Amen.
[1:43:36] God bless you all.
