God bless you this morning it's just awesome to be together and see each one of you I want to sing that course see I want what you want brother John's going to come and just share some pictures of of where he ministered in El Salvador and then he'll Minister and then we'll Fellowship together I believe they're coming to our house after and everybody or anybody is very very welcome to come and fellowship with the family or whatever amen amen let's just sing this as our brother John comes I want what you want for me dear Lord whatever wherever it may be and I know that you know what's best my Lord and I want what you want for me oh I want what you want for me I want what you are for me dear Lord whatever wherever it may be for I know that you [Applause] [Music] know I you for me I want what you for me Hallelujah life without fig can you hear as also get up and say a few words Laura she she went and traveled with us and she was instrumental in in the trip and you know there and I I took that from your pastor you know brother Dale told me a long time ago when he started going on trips how important it was to the sisters that that the husband comes with the wife so that they get some fellowship too and um you know seeing that firstand uh was was significant Laura actually she got a a lot of Fellowship developed a lot of friendships but she was also able to um minister in ways that that I can't and so sister Lan coming and and the girls I know it was it was beneficial to to all of them yeah was very significant thank you and I'm still waiting uh we got lot of time there we go we're getting there all right thank you Jesus okay if you go to the the next slide uh just a a geography lesson of where where uh El Salvador is they're in Central America surrounded by uh Honduras Nicaragua uh Guatemala um of course you know brother brother Dell and sister L traveled through Honduras to to minister in Nicaragua um next slide please uh we were in uh Samuel which is there in the eastern part of the the country uh kind of highlighted there with that that little yellow star um we flew into San Salvador and between San Salvador and Samuel was um about a three-hour drive so the roads weren't very good I think you know if we were driving in the here in Canada on an interstate it probably been maybe an hour and a half but uh I tell you uh i' I've every time I go to another country I'm always come back and I'm so grateful for our traffic laws it's like I get annoyed by speed limits here and I get annoyed by by having to wait for a red light when there's nobody around but when you travel to other countries and they don't have those those laws and um it makes you very appreciative of of the order that our laws bring uh next slide please so just a uh there I'm sorry yeah that's a picture of Lura and I as we got there um tell we're we're so happy to to be there excited uh next slide um the average monthly income in El Salvador is under $500 which is in incredible especially when you consider that everything there is priced in US Dollars and almost all of it is priced at us prices so they're paying the same same price per gallon for a for a a gasoline that that we are um and then only having that much income so you can see where it' be very difficult for people to uh survive uh they they do all their transactions in in dollars and Bitcoins um and I know that you're are aware of this but just to to mention it is that the country is is become very safe and that's because they have a president who went after all of the gangs and um the the problem causers unfortunately a lot of those people escaped to my country but um it's very severe if they get caught there it's a 50-year sentence just for being a gang member uh you can't appeal it you're you're once you're identified and you are convicted you're going to jail for pretty much the rest of your life um and I kind of wonder what's going to happen as uh our country is uh in the US has said that they're dedicated now to removing those criminal elements that have that have made it to America uh so I I'm for my sake and my country's sake I'm glad to see those people deported and I'm very happy happy to have criminals deported but also for our friends uh in El Salvador it does make me a little concerned you know that these people are going to be flown back into their country and what kind of impact they'll have before they're rounded up and and put into prison but the country was very safe we felt very welcome and at home uh you get the next slide please uh this was the major volcano we were around um it always seemed to have smoke coming out of the top of it there are 170 total volcanoes in El Salvador um and 23 active so it's not a uh it's not like here could be very dangerous uh just just uh from the the geography of the place they're part of that ring of fire right right there uh next slide please uh just a couple pictures to give I'm trying to give you a sense of the country uh this was a a picture of a typical residential street uh for the most part very clean but you can see where there's bars on all the windows everything's built out of concrete uh everything is enclosed so people don't have um like a grassy front yard like we do in North America or anything like that no everything is enclosed by concrete and you have Courtyards and um I think that that uh uh you know comes probably from the criminal element that they've always had to be protecting themselves from uh next slide please uh and so here's a typical view of the the city streets uh I wish I had taken pictures of like the two-way traffic but this is just a one way you can see it's pretty congested and and uh there's businesses and shops pretty much I noticed that uh if you were on a street that received any kind of traffic uh everybody had a business of some sort right out the front door of their of their place whether it was selling bags of bread or water or coconut water everybody was trying to make a living if there was any possible way of doing it um next slide please please here's a picture of a a couple of the the children that that really uh blessed me uh and my wife uh this they're just they were just real beautiful and and they were so open and so friendly this little girl here I was in the pastor study my first time at the church and uh she came in and uh just she knocked on the door I opened it up and she just walked in and she just kind of looked looked at me and she looked around and she's you know like felt like she was his knee high and she stuck her hand up and she was like God bless you and so I I had a conversation with her in Spanish and uh which was just about perfect because that's about the level of Spanish I speak so we we had a great time having a little conversation there in the pastor study but she was just a real sweetheart and then uh this young boy uh Mato my wife we'll we'll talk a little bit about him um next slide please the these are just a couple scenes of some of the fellowship and uh we had a wonderful time just talking with the Brethren and the and the sisters um is very humble not not like uh we have here uh you can see there in that middle middle photograph if you notice at the bottom they chickens walking around underneath the underneath the table as we were eating and uh um so it's very very rustic uh but you know it was happy amen it was happy it was it wasn't like like when I when I sat there and I'm fellowshipping with these people I didn't feel bad for them because of what what they didn't have compared to us they they were happy with what they had and I was I I was happy with them I felt I felt completely and totally at home and very comfortable uh just a real genuine Spirit of hospitality um next please just a couple pictures of the sisters preparing the foods and and they believe me they worked so hard to to feed us it seemed like every every time we got done eating and we we tried to push back from the table they would push us right back in and give us more food and I I ate more food in a day that I think that I do in a week at home uh and finally I just cuz like I you know I'm the type of person I'm on a missions trip I'm just going to eat eat what you provide and I'm going to eat it and be grateful for it and uh and they fed me so much eventually I just started to have to break my own Rule and say no I don't want any no thank you but uh next slide please uh so these are just a couple photos I took of the some of the Mills there you see they're very humble they're nothing you know extraordinarily fancy um very much based on corn and uh uh the the sisters put a lot of effort and time into these and these These are their traditional meals what they eat every every day um but they love going to McDonald's and Pizza Hut and every everywhere else but uh we when Laura and I were there we was like we don't really want to go to any of those places if if we can avoid them we know you like them but just we'll just eat simple stuff uh and so uh they took care of us very well uh next slide please uh these are the couple translators that we worked with um the the one on the top left brother Raphael he was very very dear to me he uh did a lot of personal translating for me amen and actually came came with me to uh other churches to to translate just my personal conversations um on the far right the gentleman there is brother loo and he he actually is lives in the United States he's he's from um oh I I forget the Trinidad Dominican Republic that's it yeah and he was just a very very special brother an excellent translator um a beautiful singer and worshipper he he just one of those people that just brings the presence of God and um uh he he it's not a show with him he he doesn't put on a show when he sings he he's very animated enthusiastic but he's not perform performing not he's not a performer now now i' I've been around singers who perform and and you know they're performing because they they have just certain movements they do and it's it's very choreographed and uh not brother brother loo he's he's just 100% uh totally invested uh into God and what God's given him and uh I just came away with just a tremendous amount of respect for this brother um a very deep love uh for for God's bride and what he's done we I want I wish that all of us could be as faithful to our gifts as brother Leno is to his um now the there on the bottom left this that's brother William he's a a very excellent translator and he actually I wanted to show him and also let you know that he was one of the the three or four Brethren that was working on the final translation project to put all of the messages into uh space Spanish and that only completed about 4 years ago and so these brothers worked and a couple sisters worked on doing the final translation for about 10 years and and it was only completed four years ago because Jeffersonville and the voice of God they'd only translated a limited number of of sermons into Spanish and Spanish has spoken over half the world as so um you know they they they divided up their resources for whatever reasons to to to get the what they call the seed Library into more places but brother William and these other brothers and sisters that he worked with they picked the the torch and They carried it to the finish line and did a wonderful job and he's just a very special very special young man and uh I I pray for him he uh he he is someone and I I not to say too much about him but he needs prayer he's very uh Melancholy person and he he goes highs and lows and it's not like he's bipolar or something like that but um like brother brandom when he was in the presence of God it's this extreme high like like he talked to us about Elijah when the presence of God left him he found himself in a cave you know um and so he's a lot like that and it my heart really was was burden for himed and I just would ask that you remember him in prayer he's done so much for the the work of the Lord um but he's terribly Afflicted in that way uh next slide please this is the first church that we preached at Pastor uh Gerardo uh Gerardo um and his family here we took a couple pictures just a really precious brother um older uh we had a wonderful time with this uh this service was very special um I took a actually I preached the same sermon that I preached here on the blood still speaking and and if you recall I played that that clip of brother brandom and he's he was praying for the the little Mexican boy that was with cancer and uh if you remember he was he said you know he was praying to God and he's he was saying you know God surely wouldn't do this he was like and God just told Brother random well I'm waiting to see what you're going to do and so I I preached that sermon here and we uh it really it really did Bless the people and uh we ended up having a prayer line and something kind of extraordinary happen in that uh and I don't I don't say this to to any any Glory of mine at all um but there was there were several heal healings that came from that prayer line but something else that was extraordinary that happened was they had given me a bottle of anointing oil uh uh as people would come up and I I would I started putting it down at my feet I was off the platform and I I put it down at my feet and I praying for people I just pied pick it up and um and use it and I place it back down again and I noticed as I was praying for for the for the people that um brother a couple of the brothers that were up there they became very concerned about that bottle of oil on the on the ground and uh eventually one of them picked it up and was just would hold it for me and uh I was talking to him afterwards about the spirit and things being genuine and and I reminded them brother that I don't know if you've ever heard the testimony I think it was brother bisc or maybe it was brother Perry green that was watching brother brandom preaching and brother brandom had a a microphone that had a cord and somehow during brother Brandon's preaching he's moving around and that cord became wrapped around his leg and uh whichever one of these brothers was telling I just can't remember off the top of my head said that he was he became very concerned about it he and all he could think about was brother Brandon's going to trip and he's going to make a fool of himself in the prayer line is going to be embarrassed and he said right before his eyes that that cord vanished and straightened out off of his leg and uh and I I reminded the brothers of this and and I said you know what was happening there in that prayer line was was sincere and genuine it was a real move of God and I said I never even thought I was moving around all over the place I never even thought once about that bottle of oil I didn't look down to see where if I was close to it or the only time I looked for that thing was when I was picking it up to use it for the next person and I said you so I was teaching them you know when when God is doing something and it is a real genuine move of God you're not going to do something that's going to embarrass yourself or embarrass him God's going to completely take care of you and I uh you know you you've all probably seen it when people impersonate the things of God and say the the spirit comes down and and uh people are swaying and they're falling down you know uh running around with their eyes closed and if that's a real move of God that person is never going to they could fall off the the edge of the Earth and and bounce you know 6et down on a concrete and they get right back up they're not even going to have a scratch on them um but then when you see somebody else that's uh under the under you know that is putting it on a little bit and In the Flesh they're swinging around they might whack somebody across the face you know because they're they're not really truly in the spirit um amen amen but if you're in the spirit you're never going to do that you're never going to hurt somebody else or or be hurt and so I was trying to teach te I I I was this is that lesson that this this was genuine and you you brothers were so concerned that I was going to knock over and spill that bottle of oil embarrass myself or embarrass embarrass you that you missed out on what God was doing there were people that were genuinely being healed in that prayer line and um uh so I it was a good lesson for them to learn uh amen next slide please amen uh the the next church we spoke at Pastor Nelson uh Savia uh the next day I beautiful beautiful church this wonderful people we had a a a a healing line there as well uh one of the testimonies that really uh stands out to me on this this particular uh service in that prayer line they brought they brought a little baby to be to be prayed for and the baby was just burning up with fever and um I I placed the parents were holding it and I put my hands around his his stomach and I could just feel the heat off of the the poor thing and uh we we prayed for it by the by the grace of God the parents told me after the service by the time that they walked back to their seat the fever was completely gone and that's that's just it it touches your heart you know and but that's what God has to do you know he's promised he's going to do it he backs up the word with signs and wonders and there's no reason to be Wishy aashi about it um when we in that call in that position uh we H we have the authority as the Bride of Jesus Christ to to to write the checks and and sign them uh he's going to he's he's there to uh meet every need thank you Lord uh and so that was that was that was just real Precious for for me to see that in action you know like a lot of times you pray for people you know in North America and they don't have the faith to believe it because they're they're afraid God's not going to honor his word they got more fear than Faith right and um uh I think you're and you know this that other countries they they operate just a little bit differently than than we do here in North America I wish we could be more like them amen uh next slide please uh we went then to the anniversary meetings uh at brother Edgar konas um for their 37th anniversary I I was able to to minister twice there it was a real blessing and I just uh took a couple of sermons that were very very simple and um people were I think were blessed by him one one thing that did come out of that that was unique was he told me that they I I opened up the services there on Wednesday which um he told me that they broadcast that uh on their on their YouTube p Channel and he said they had never ever had received the number of viewers that that they did as they did for that first sermon um and what was particular about it was like it the viewers was very small the viewership was very small and then as as the word started coming forth what must have happened was people started messaging people say hey this is this is being preached come and listen and so like you know after a little bit into the sermon the viewership just exploded um and so we've seen that that happen and they were brother Edgar was uh was just really excited about that um and I I was excited because you know that that meant that message was getting out to to more than just the local body and just pray that you know God does all things well and if if that word's going out then there's a reason for it and that people will be blessed uh the next next slide please um I wrapped up my my portion of the trip uh we left of course before brother Dell I spoke at brother javan's Church which was way out in the country and I I took a I think I even preached this sermon uh here on forgiveness and um very simple and in in this particular sermon I don't even I don't even mention brother brandom I don't say a quote it's all just based on scripture and uh I was preaching the sermon and it was such a heavy anointing it was just a real beautiful anointing when I first came out every you know it was just uh the crowd the the assembly it was just like let's go anything is possible and I I actually kind of had to settle settle things down because that this this this message isn't a that particular message isn't a like a a rah rah kind of a is it's one of those sermons that you really need to to sit and listen to and think about and I I not as the people calmed down something that I noticed was that uh people started getting out their cell phones and they started recording and um what what it reminded me of was is I I've always seen pictures of like the you know when people are at a concert and they hold up their lighters for whatever reason whatever reason they do but that's what it reminded me almost everybody had a cell phone up and started videotaping uh the service and um I I I think that was because they were being blessed by it was a it was a a very um a very good Service uh the message that went forth was was obviously needed and effective uh it was very well received and then I actually had other minister brother ask me for the notes on that because they wanted to preach it the same sermon at their home churches and so um I was I was very grateful for that we had a wonderful Fellowship there with the the church um next slide please uh so so I already told you about the the baby being healed um another another one was with there was a denominational Minister that had came and if I understood correctly uh brother Edgar was telling me that he had been friends with this denominational brother for many years as friend of his father but that based on those sermons he was accepting of the message and so uh you know when you have that then you a pastor who accepts it amen he's going to take that back to his church and there's going to be people in the church that accepts it and so I'm just really praying that the that God will move in that way and that many more souls will will be saved um uh next slide please sorry I kind of I think that was more my notes of a slide uh while we were there there was a there was a huge earthquake uh A 5.6 that happened just uh about 20 mi away from where we were at and uh it was interesting because it was the first earthquake that I've ever been been in has anybody else ever been in an earthquake a couple a couple people see we have earthquakes and we've had them where I live but I have never ever felt one and uh we were outside of church and fellowshipping and I felt this little bit of a a rumble in the ground and my first thought was that there was a a tractor trailer that was overloaded kind of going down the street street but then all of a sudden the ground started acting like uh I don't know if you ever been on a little boat in a in a one of the Lakes where the the waves were going up and down it started being like that and so then I was like oh wow this is an earthquake and I got excited like like John John has never experienced an earthquake and this is a bucket list thing and so uh you know and because I've never experienced one in a bad way you know like I've never been in a house I had to rush out of I've never been devastated I was excited and I was I was smiling ear to ear and I'm like wow this is crazy hey this an earthquake it and you know and then you start looking around and then all these people have their heads bowed and they're all praying desperately and I was like why are they all praying desperately but it was it was a pretty good one a lot of people ended up sleeping at sleeping outside that night because they were worried about aftershocks you know and and their houses collapsing uh but uh but for me I maybe next time I'll be more sensitive to but this time I definitely was not sensitive um uh next slide please uh this family in particular is one that really uh ha has a wonderful testimony the the mother uh there on the right that's that's the her three children and her husband actually had had left her and went to the states to work and for a while he supported her but then gradually they they stopped really being a husband and wife and he doesn't support her at all she's there on her own with these with the three kids now the boy's a little bit older I think he's 16 um but the youngest there uh this little guy is four and he's who I really want to talk about this little boy is is um is autistic and uh suffers from ADHD and they didn't know how to deal with that at all uh this mother was so overwhelmed by this little boy that he would he would run out of the out of their home into traffic he'd almost been killed several times uh they have great big concrete basins of water uh he had jumped in that and almost Dr several times he would be he would hit her kick her do all kinds of different things um and it didn't matter if she punished him you she could she could whip him as much as she wanted to and he would still persist in doing these things it was to the point that she she told me that uh she was going to give him to an orphanage it was that it was that bad and the CH her other two children they were in agreement that he needed to go to an orphanage because he was just unable to be controlled and uh was not changing for any in any way for the better um and then so uh because I I work with children with autism and I was telling I was telling uh the pastor about this he told her and that she was going to take the boy and drop him off at the orphanage the very the Wednesday that I preached there opened up the meetings but he had told her that I was going to be there and so she came to talk to me instead of taking the boy to the orphanage and I spent some time talking with her after the service and she it it was really it was it was heartbreaking because she was so ashamed of her inability to to make a difference in this and she had uh she was ashamed at how she had treated the boy that wasn't like a mother should um she had been uh just she she we we spank her children I I believe in spanking but there's also you can go too far amen and uh she had she had gone too far several times and um she was just at her Wit's End I just she couldn't even look me in the eyes as she was talking to me she was so Afflicted and asham but I prayed with her that night and talked for for quite a while and gave her some real practical instruction and how to deal with a child like this and um two days two days later she spoke to me again and uh this something something was different this time she could look me in the eyes and she began to tell me that the little boy was had slept he had slept like 12 hours two days in a row and this was that's so if you have ever had known people with a child with ADHD that's incredible because they have like Boundless Energy they always have to be moving they cannot sit still um and for him to sleep like that and then she noticed that his personality was was changing and um she she told me it was so dramatic that that she was actually somebody accused her of putting the boy on drugs to to flatten him out amen it was that that dramatic of a shift I noticed then that that I had her WhatsApp and then she actually changed her WhatsApp picture to a picture of the little boy and that in itself was a testimony to go from a mother who who I don't want to say she hated the little boy but to the point she was to the point she was she would have been okay if he died it was that that severe and to go to that point the the god changed her heart back back to a mother's love for the baby to actually put him as her picture and then uh I've been in contact with her ever since we've gotten back and just kind of helping to coach her and to support her and let her know hey you're not a failure that these children you know God made them a special way you have to deal with them in a special way and uh and she sent me a a video clip a couple video clips uh the other day of him in the supermarket with her now before in a supermarket he would be screaming crying just just a a terror and in in the video clips she he's he's got her shopping basket he's pulling it for her and he's he was just a perfect little gentleman and um I it was just a complete change it just a complete miraculous change that I told her said I said God may not have taken the the these things away from him may he may always have some issues with these things autism or or ADHD but the process of healing has started and I'm just really praying that that God continues to work and move uh for that is a very very touching testimony for me uh to see that it to see it in action to go from I don't I don't really mind if this child dies I'm going to give him away to I love him oh and not just her but the attitude of her other two children changed towards little boy too and that's an act of God Amen uh next slide please uh so next year uh I already I've already committed to going back we're going to go into uh Nicaragua uh this pastor here brother cardinus I know brother Dale spoke for him uh so they've invited me uh and so if the Lord the Lord provides and we he's willing we're going to go back we're going to hit El Salvador Honduras and Nicaragua am um and so just be in prayer for that that God would amen uh lead us and that you know we don't want to ever step out of his will and you you you're always is Will going on a missions trip but uh to go where he wants us to go um Laura you wanted to say a couple things too I you just you might need to my experiences as a series of testimonies is this there we go so um you know when John said we wanted he wanted to go to Elsa where he wanted me to come with him you know I was like okay that's you know I'd like to do that i' like to meet people um but as maybe a lot of you know like I've been having issues with my back this year and I have a herniated disc in my back and slippage of the vertebrae so it's been kind of rough for me to stand for too long or sit for too long a lot of nerve pain and stuff like that in my legs and I'm actually going for surgery on Tuesday so leading up to this I had tried uh getting a couple of shots things like that my back to make it easier to travel but they didn't help that much and so like the Monday we were leaving on Friday right after our Thanksgiving in the the Estates and that Monday I had gone to the grocery store done some errands and I got in the car afterwards and I my legs hurt so bad I was in so much pain and I just started crying called John I'm like I don't I don't think I can go on this what good am I going to be if I'm like hurting and in pain and can hardly move around and walk you know how am I going to be a blessing I mean I'm like I'm like at I'm like hitting bottom I'm like I just I just can't you know and he he was like you know you know I'm going to pray for you hun and just come home we'll take care of everything you know and after I got off the phone with him I called my parents I was waiting for my groceries to pick them up and uh called my parents and they just like immediately went to prayer and I could just feel the presence of God comeing and calm me down and so I was like well Lord I'm just going to give it to you you know and you you're going to have to help me because we had been crazy busy I mean just just to be honest going into this like crazy busy that entire fall and I was just kind of on empty and um emotionally physically Mally and I thought how am I going to go give me a blessing to people and I'm like I'm I'm just like ready to crash and physically I'm having problems so I just kind of pushed it out of my mind committed it to the Lord the next few days I I did had good days you know and we went ahead and went and we got over there and God just I know that he just gave me the strength and energy and um we went brother Nelson's house first um and their family was just so welcoming and inviting and the kids they have seven kids and I mean I Vanessa Ander probably talked to you guys and Lan and Dell you probably already know but they're just you know amazing people you feel right at home even with the language barrier you know and um so I just started enjoying myself and I'm like I'm here to talk to the women and so it was easy to talk to the young kids the young girls because well a couple of them spoke some English and of course Victoria spoke really good English and so you know we hit it right off and then I would use her to like help me translate with um their mother and you know like I told everyone uh they were really good for my self-esteem because they all thought I was like late 20s early 30s so I'm like yeah okay new best friends right there but so the young people I mean they just pulled me right in um I spent a lot of time with them but then I made sure I was spending time with the sister's more my age and you know I was just talking with everyone and we went over to P's house so there was a couple of young people that really stood out to me that just really impacted my life and one of them was this young man here his name is Angel and um he goes to brother ralo's church and um we went over to his house and he was there and I kind of started like talking to him a little bit and all a sudden I could realize he spoke English and I'm like you speak English and they're all like really shy about the English they speak you know and I just kept encouraging them like you're doing great I mean it's amazing how much you can communicate even with just knowing a little bit of someone's language and so I kept encouraging him he was like okay this is good practice because he never has anybody to practice on so he um talked to me for a while told me his testimony and um so then after a little bit I wanted to talk to brother R's wife and there was no one you know the men are busy talking they don't want to translate so I asked Angel to help translate so I could talk to her he patiently sat there for a half an hour translating back and forth for the both of us so we could talk and connect and he told me was able to hear her testimony and talk with her and I just so just really blessed me and um that they would he would even take the time to you know most young men 22 years old they don't want to sit and listen to two women talk you know but he was happy to do it and so it really blessed me so you can go to the next one and this is Victoria she became very close and um she speaks good English and the girls were really close to her and one night we were able to stay up and just kind of talk a little deeper you know sometimes you just have that you know surface talk of getting to know people which is great but sometimes it's really nice to get a little deeper and talk and just communicate with one another maybe things you're going through and be a help to one another and that was just a real blessing to be able to do that one night with s us we're just sitting there talking and um just great memories we'll always remember those and um we can go to the next one I had gotten sick oh this is yeah this is a picture of all of us we were this was Sunday after church and everybody came over to brother Nelson's house they fed everybody which I don't know how many people there were had to be at least 50 it was a lot of people I meant to go around to every like table and take pictures and I didn't I didn't get a chance to do that but we got this picture with a lot of the sisters and the ones that have check marks are um brother Nelson's daughters and then the wife right down there with the heart and then the other sisters a lot of them are related um the one girl right beside me in the green her name is Ruth and she was just a sweetheart she came right up to me started talking perfectly good English I'm like somebody who speaks English and we just like it was like we were best friends and you know it wasn't like we just met and it was just it was just wonderful and um so on on Tuesday night we we were having a party for one of their daughters had a birthday and just suddenly I was just super sick with a head cold and like a sinus stuff and I couldn't even wear my contacts I wear my glasses I just felt terrible I'm like oh great this is we still got a long ways to go before the end of the trip and I didn't want to be sick I knew we had the other Church to go to and um I started feeling like I just didn't even want to talk to anybody I was like crashing so brother Nelson and his wife and all them they gave me so much medication and then you can go and get antibiotics there just by going to the pharmacy you don't have to go to the doctor so John went and got me antibiotics in case it was a sinus infection and they were just pumping me full of all kinds of medication and within two days usually it takes me about two weeks to get over a sinus infection within two days I was better enough to go to the next chur church and the next family so I know that was lore because it usually takes me way longer than that and I was able to stay at brother Nelson's house and just sleep and they just pampered me and um yeah it was it was it was wonderful treatment and I was able to get over that really fast so you go to the next one they took us to the beach and so we had a lot of fun even though it was dark and we couldn't see but uh a lot of fun that was like one of the things um that we got to do other than just the sermons and stuff like that and um just get to know each other kind of build some memories it was it was a lot of fun and they wanted to show us places like they just wanted to take us places they wanted to show us their their country and the things that they do for fun and so I keep going so after I felt better John was already over at the other convention and they wanted to take me somewhere and and they're like I'm like okay you know yeah I can go maybe somewhere for I was thinking like an hour they took me way up on MAR FAA Margarita mountain all the way to the almost to the top and took me to a restaurant up there treated me you know like I was royalty and just bought me dinner and showed me around and um it was wonderful evening together so that was a lot of fun and then you can keep going uh so then we went over to brother Edgars and um the first service that I was there after I was sick and got better um you know all the sisters had we kind of you kind of come out everybody kind of lines up and shakes hands and you know the sisters come out but I didn't know anybody who spoke spoke English there and I did have the Google translate but you had to have a really good connection for that to work really well and not have like a delay and and so yeah you can use it and we did use it sometimes and that was helpful but you know you don't want to just come up to someone and kind of stick a phone in their face and be like talking to this so I was trying to figure out how to talk to the sisters and you know and the brothers you know we had brother rafhael there there but he was helping John you know with the brothers and so I just was kind of standing there trying to figure out how to break the ice how to go up and talk to these sisters well this little boy kept going past me and finally he comes up sticks out his hands like God bless you in like perfect little little English and I was like oh you speak English and he got this big grin on his face and so then he walks off and then um I finally went over to some people I didn't know from Brother Nelson's church I was kind of you know talking to them kind of brokenly but I sat down on a little bench and he kept going back and forth finally I just kind of patted my bench you know and told him to come over so he comes over so I Ed Google Translate asking him questions he kept trying to respond in English like the a little bit of English he knew and um so we just kind of struck up a little friendship right so then he runs off and I think okay he's just going to go play with his friends well instead he goes and grabs his mother and drags her over to me and you know wants us to talk he's like and so I thought it was so sweet like you know the little child will lead them you know and so I you know through the Google translate I think brother rafhael had come over at that point and so I was able to like meet his mother and meet his family and it just kind of broke the ice and after that anytime he saw me he came running you know and put his arms around me and um we bought him a little gift and uh the pastor had given it to him after we left and his mom contacted me on Facebook and I got a little recording where he says it in a little English you know thank you for the gift sister laa and now it's just precious so all right go on to next one amen and this is Martha I finally found someone who talked a little bit of English and it was um a 19-year-old girl and she kind of real shy came up to me asked me if she could get a picture with me and um I'm like well you speak English and she's like oh I'm not very good you know and I'm like you know well you're you know their pronunciation actually is pretty good whatever they do know you can actually understand them and so I'm like well you know you're doing pretty good so she started talking more to me and um in just the little bit that she knew we could Converse and then like what we didn't know we'd use the Google translate and she had told me that she wanted to go to the college to learn English and be an English teacher and so we just stuck a r up a really good friendship and she told me her testimony where um I think I B about a year or two ago she um got very sick they found a dormant virus in her blood from childhood and it came active and it almost killed her took her sight and then God had in the you know through the doctors had really helped her she had gained back um 80% of her sight and she just had a really amazing testimony and just an amazing sweet spirit and love for the Lord and so we've been in contact even you know since um we've left and she's just a really sweet girl so I was just able to connect with so many of them and it just was it just really blessed my heart I went to be a blessing came back obviously very blessed so um I think there's maybe a couple more so this is uh brother Raphael and his mom and dad and they just became very dear to to us also just super sweet people I mean you couldn't find sweeter people if you tried and um it was hard it was actually hard to leave it was like you know I was ready to go home and see my kids but yet I wanted to bring them all with me but they would have froze to death so but you can keep going it's it's it's so interesting how like you know just that that connection of you know loving the Lord and then being able to just connect in your spirits together you have a common a common foundation and you can just go off from there and um and within minutes just feel so close to each other so you can go on to the next one that was brother Nelson and sister Sonia and she just treated me like I was her little sister and it was just like John said they fed us and they fed us and then they fed us some more and um yeah the girls and I Vanessa and I were like okay enough we're going to pop and we had more papoa than we've ever had in our life I think we had it five times in the eight days we were there they definitely uh wanted us to like their national food but it was all very good like I was willing to try pretty much anything and so they were like okay they gave me all kinds of things to try and everything was pretty good there was only a few things that I didn't particularly care for this is the volcano um we were going to the beach one the brothers knew I wanted to get a picture of the volcano so he purposely stopped on a certain spot and let me get a really good picture of it and so let's see I think oh this sweet lady here her name is um well we would say Vilma but in their then their language would be Wilma so um she was just like one of those you just I told her I said I can tell you are a seasoned veteran of Christ you know just a seasoned woman and um she just was praising the Lord during the service and she this is another one I wanted to like bring home but um she thought she wanted to talk to me so bad and she was like so annoyed with like trying to use the translator so she just kept talking me in Spanish like I was going to suddenly know what she was saying but but you know it was just Kindred Spirits for sure so next one that was us getting ready to leave um we didn't want to part ways with brother Raphael and it was just hard but we will be back I think that's probably it yeah so yep had a wonderful time and God just really moved in the services I can testify that what John said is you know true on the testimonies and so didn't really say it because I think maybe she maybe it's just didn't think about how important it is maybe just a little bit embarrassed to say it but she actually was able to answer questions for a lot of those sisters that they asked you know like if I when I was speaking on something preaching and um you know they would they would talk about those topics too and um you know being able to give her perspective especially when I dealt with some topics like on marriage and things like that so I was very grateful for for her to come and it is 11:23 and brother Dell said I could he said I could preach as long as I want uh so if you would stand with me and I I promise that I'll try to go quick but let's just uh let's just kind of change the order of the service to look at the word and uh turn with me if you will to the to the Book of Joel and uh uh Joel chapter 2 just going to read a couple scriptures here if I was to title this uh this morning I'd like to title it unashamed of overcoming uh chapter 2 2 and verse 23- 27 be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten the cankerworm and and the caterpillar and the Palmer room my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that has dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed let's just bow our heads in prayer as we uh open the word Lord God thank you for this opportunity to to be here with your people father I just pray that you take the simple thought that that you've given me may it be expressed may your people be blessed in all things we give you praise in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen bless Jesus I'd like you to notice here that you we we are all very very familiar with this scripture but the the situation here is one of blessing and that uh when the prophet is is taking the words of God here and he's saying you are going to be in a state of of of of blessing you're going to have the the former rain you're going to have the latter rain you're going to eat in plenty you're going to be satisfied you're going to be praising the Lord your God you're not going to be ashamed of anything that he's given you right uh and and that everyone is going to know that he's your God and that he is with you and it it's particular and I I started wondering about this why why did he feel the need to say you're not going to be ashamed why why why would he put that in there and as I was meditating on the Lord started giving me some thoughts and there's a couple different ways that we could take it but I'd like to turn now to the uh to the book of second Timothy and uh I'm going to read 1: 8-2 as Paul uh is is giving some instruction here and he says be be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of the Lord nor of me his prisoner uh and I and I I was reading about that reading that and I thought you know how many people that are Christians are ashamed of the testimony of being a Christian and they want to be secret Christians and they want to hide it and how many people walk around in the message that are ashamed to say they follow the message of of a prophet named William brandom and it's almost like one of the last things that we'll tell somebody about ourselves is is oh yes we follow a message brought by a prophet in this last day and it's and I think a lot of it has to do with with a little bit of shame that that that it's not common it's not uh something that everybody says all the time it's unusual it's weird it's strange and we're we can be a little bit ashamed to to say it and we're not ashamed on the inside of of what we believe but a lot of times I think we become a little bit ashamed to tell people and just to offer it freely and willingly and like we just want to kind of hold that little piece back of our of ourselves and what we believe instead of just giving freely of that which we receive and Paul Paul's talking here he says but he said don't be ashamed of me as prisoner but be a partaker of the afflictions of the gospel because when you when you are not ashamed and you tell people you're going to be afflicted right uh not everybody's going to be be very receptive that you follow a prophet and he he goes on here and he says who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ who has abolished death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel wherefore I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher and all of us are appointed to a position all of us have been appointed to a placing as a when we become adopted Sons and Daughters of God God has placed us positionally within the bride within his church uh and so we we are the same as Paul in that regard and he said for for which cause I suffer things nevertheless I am not ashamed I'm not ashamed of of the things that I suffered why because I know whom I have believed in I know who he is I know him intimately uh Paul didn't have the testimony that he walked with Jesus Christ for three and a half years of ministry he didn't have the testimony of the Apostles but he knew Jesus Christ he knew the word for his day and he's persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him what did Paul commit to him his very life his his being his purpose for existence Paul could take it all and hand it and put it squarely in the hands of God and not have to worry about anything it's like it belongs to him anyway I I he's going to keep it as he's going to keep my Ministry going he's going to keep my life living as long as he wants to amen and I think a lot of times we we become we become just a little bit too ashamed of who we are in the in the in the aspect of wanting to tell people about it and we're we can get a little bit intimidated by the culture and we be we can become a little bit intimidated by by the the threats of of what this culture presents to where if we talk about there only being two genders 50% of the population looks at you like you're a you're most hateful despicable person in the world and so you don't want to have a conversation about those things and you avoid that and you avoid avoid professing your faith but when you've met God and you know who he is and you know who you are you won't be ashamed now joh brother John not saying you haven't met God I'm not saying that but what I am saying is that we need to be a little bit more bold as Christians to testify of what God has done for us we need to be a little bit less ashamed to be known as Believers in an end time message right and we we can stand strong in our convictions and a lot of times and I see this with with younger people especially they they get wishy-washy in their convictions and they they can be raised in a church and they get to a certain point where they get too involved with the culture that surrounds us and the next thing you know they're they're asking questions and they're questioning all the things that they thought that they believed and they thought that they knew and and when that happens the devil is right there he knows exactly what to whisper in their ear he knows exactly what what traps to lay before them he knows exactly what to seduce them with to pull them away from what they've believed and the next thing you know a young person finds themselves in places they never would have thought they would have gone to they never would have imagined that they they could fall into to these kinds of sins and traps and then they know it's a trap and they know that they're they're doing the wrong thing but then they're too ashamed to come back to what what they knew amen I I have a lot of quotes to read but I think I'll I'll I'll read these quickly and not try to make too many content uh uh comments on them brother brandom in in says when God made the promise of the baptism of the holy of the Holy Ghost and you receive it there is something that settles within you that there's nothing that can take its place and how many how many can testify that that when you receive the Holy Ghost something changed in your life I know that when I receive the Holy Ghost something changed in my life I wasn't the same person that I was before I didn't have the same uh appetite that I had before for the things of the world the things of the world didn't have a pole on me anymore I still had to fight my flesh yes and I still do today but the the pull of the world disappeared I no longer cared so much about all those things that I thought was important before John Garrett changed I was a new creation a new create uh I I was different he said when a man ever meets God not in some emotional workup some enthusiasm or some religious Dogma uh or religious Doctrine some catechism or Creed or Dogma that he's accepted and he says this he says what why does he accept it because it's comforting to them and I think a lot of times we have a lot of people who sit in a message church that that accept what's being said and they find those words comforting because who doesn't want to be told that they're they're part of the elect who doesn't want to be told that you're going to be in the Rapture you're not going to go through tribulation that you you've got it you're fine you're part of the Bride amen and people love that and they want to hear it and they accept it mentally in an emotional work up or with enthusiasm but they don't accept it in their heart of hearts brother brand says they take it as a comfort but when it really comes to the place like Moses did on the back side of the desert and you walk up face to face with almighty God and you see the voice speaking to you exactly with the word and the pro promise of the hour there is something it does to you and he says see you're not going to be ashamed of it it's done something to you and that's that's the testimony of the believer is that when we have heard something that had uh like Moses that caught our attention a a fire burning in a bush and the bush not burning it caught our attention and we came away we separated ourselves and we went to it and we spoke to it and it spoke to us and it changed us forever how can we be ashamed of what God's done this is this is what he's G he's given us this message in the our faith and it becomes a token to us this blood that we believe in the blood that we claim brother random says he expects us to display the token over our faith to display it to who though who who do we most most of the time we display the token to and I'm I'm ashamed to say it is most of the time we display the token to other believers and we we're not we're not ashamed that other believers know that we have the token on display and we we walk we way way too many of us have a church life and a church walk where we put on a a a lot of show when we come to church and we come in and we we're dressed the right way and we sit down and we mind our p's and q's and we say God bless you and amen and everything but when we're Out Among the world and too many times out on the job and we're dealing with other people we don't really display that token like we ought to we don't really we don't sometimes we laugh at jokes that we shouldn't laugh at and I tell you what you people people catch on to that and they it'll ruin your testimony it'll it'll absolutely ruin it because they'll they'll say oh well brother John says he's a Christian but but you know the other day we were joking and and you know we we laughed about some pretty you know unsavory stuff and and he laughed right along with it you know so he's not a real Christian amen we don't want to ruin our testimony brother random says uh uh uh this is he says that is the badge the token of identification because it's Christ's own life in you identifying the word and it doesn't need anything else and when you have that life in you you don't need anything else you don't need the acceptance of other people you don't need the to worry about whether somebody likes you or dislikes you or they love you or hate you because your focus is then on Jesus Christ and being accepted in him that God that same power that raised up Jesus from the G grave you are holding within yourself as a token the Holy Ghost in you is the token that brings you from the grave because the token is God the Holy Spirit which is eternal life and that's the only only thing that pays the price he goes on in another time he's talking about the token he says uh he says I want you to notice what the order of this is the order of the Passover and he talks it says he gives a little bit of a background that it has to be a male sheep that that it must be tested for 14 days and he says what a perfect type it is of Christ the antitype a male a lamb and he was tested for three and A2 years of his ministry through critics and everything the clergy of that day but was proved to hold fast to the father's word now we've been keeping up the lamb this message right for 60 70 years it's been being watched by by people longer than I've been alive and and some of you that are that are older than me you've been in this message for some some of you I don't want to call you old but you've been in it for quite a while and you've seen people come you've seen people go you've seen the Winds of Doctrine blow this way blow that way and you've but but the point that you've held on to is what has been revealed to me is true otherwise you wouldn't be here you would have just left when you seen seen the craziness that surrounds any type of religious movement and the in the fanaticism but something in this has proven itself to you and you've latched on to it and that's why you're still here amen and he goes on he says uh has withstood all that the critics and the clergy and and was proven even in the presence of Satan talking about Jesus he said it is written it is written and constantly he defeated the enemy on the word and he says it's a perfect example for us today always defeat the enemy with the word of God that's written for the day and I I just have to believe that there's a bride of Jesus Christ that there is a people a church church that is going to overcome every obstacle that the devil would lay down that every every every thing that the devil would place before you to try to pull you out of the way that the the influences that he would have that there that there is a people that is going to overcome those and we're going to have a battle and we're going to have a fight but there God is giving us an overcoming power that only is in this body that has the true life of Jesus Christ the true token now there's a lot of people who profess to be Believers there's a lot of people who profess to be Christians and they can be some good people moral high standards but they don't have this life they do not have it and they and they prove it in in a thousand ways and and then this the funny thing is is that that we we we who do have it and you know you have the Holy Ghost you've been changed and then when you fall short of what you what you would want to be then you start to wonder if you have it and if you're ever going to make it why do you think when I come here so when I preach I I always try to tell tell you in every sermon that that you are now the Sons and Daughters of God and it doesn't even appear what you're going to be it is impossible for you to sin it's impossible for you to be lost when you receive the Holy Ghost on your soul you are sealed until the day of your Redemption now that's not once saved always saved no no ST that's not that that's not that belief cuz you can have the Holy Ghost fall on your flesh realm and on your spirit realm but when it is in your soul and you have a changed nature you are sealed and you cannot be unsealed period no ifs ANS or buts no what ifs it's impossible for you at that point because you are a new creation in Christ Jesus thank you Lord why would we be ashamed about it brother random says he says you can't be a secret boy about it no you've got to have it and you've got to have it on display that was the purpose of putting it on the doors so that he could see it on the lentil and on the doorpost is something you're not ashamed of you want the whole world to know that you're that you are dead and your life is hid in God through Christ it has to be on display it can't be on display at church and then not at home where you where where a husband comes into the church and he's he's praying and worshiping God and he looks like a model Christian but then when he goes home he mistreats his wife and his children it can't it can't be you know the sister that comes to church and she she cooks or cleans and provides meals and does all the right things but then when she goes to the grocery store she's looking at all the dirty filthy magazines while she's waiting to check out it has to be on display for everyone to see the blood was a token and identification the blood ID ify that the worshipper had slain the lamb and had accepted the lamb and applied the token to himself that he was not ashamed and so so many times people want they want a slain lamb but they don't want to accept the lamb they only want just a little piece the feel-good pieces that you're the bride and you're you're you're you you're Overcomer and they want to be told all these wonderful blessings that God has in store but they don't want to accept the difficulty that is associated with this message and with the and not just with this message but with the cause of Jesus Christ that Paul said I'm going to suffer Affliction right you will suffer Affliction when you believe this and you have it on display people are going to mistreat you they are going to identify you as belonging to a cult they're going to identify you as being abnormal unusual that you're weird that you that there's something wrong with you that you're crazy and you have to be willing to accept that condemnation you have to be willing to be counted that way that's right so he didn't care who saw let me go back and reread this the blood identified that the worshipper had slain the lamb and accepted the lamb and applied the token to himself that he was not ashamed he didn't care who saw it he wanted everybody to see it and it was placed in such a position that everybody passing by could see the token and that's the way it has to be in our life that it has to be on dis way that everybody can see it we can't just show it to just one person or two person our family or this we got to show it on the job we've got to show it when we're in the grocery store when we're out shopping that the the people that we walk with and walk among can see that there's something unusual and different about you and that you're okay with it that you're happy that there's something different about you today my goodness why would we want to be like the people of the world who are so miserable that are that are so so so just completely abject wretched that they they go out and they they have to do their their minds are so gone that they go out and they do drugs so that they can have a happy time they go out to the bars and they get drunk so they can feel good and you know is they're so miserable they have nothing keeping them that that's just a you know how they're a happy person is so rare is so rare and like I could go into statistics and tell you how many how prevalent depression and anxiety is within in the population it ain't like 10% or 20% it's like 80% that deal with these things brother Brandon wasn't wrong when he said we live in a neurotic age why why would I want to walk around and act like them I I don't want nothing like that I'm happy that God's changed me I'm happy to be a Christian I God God pulled me out of the mess so that I could if anything I'm his mess now amen thank you Lord so they don't it was placed in uh such a position that everybody passing by can see the token see many people wants to be Christians and they and they like to do it secretly so nobody would know that they're Christians or the associates that they run around with some of them would think well look now I know he he want I want to be a Christian but I don't want so and so to know about it well see that's not Christianity and it certainly isn't the messag Christianity has to display its token see publicly in public life at the office on the street when trouble is around anything in church everywhere else the blood is the token and the token must be applied now listen into this real closely or see if it's not the Covenant is not in effect the Covenant isn't in effect you're not safe from anything it has to be applied who applies it you do we apply it God doesn't come and apply the blood for us over our our household and over our lives to identify us we have to take the the the Lamb's blood and apply it amen we have to we have to be Overcomers overcome ourselves uh brother Ram talking here he says uh this is a little bit more lengthy look at Samson see God can only use what you surrender to him Samson was a big strong man he had a lot of strength and Samson surrendered his strength to God but wouldn't give his heart he gave his heart to Delila see and that's the way with people today Oh They'll they'll reach down and they'll pay off some of the church debts or they'll contribute to the church and they'll they'll put an offering in and build a bigger building a bigger denomination and so forth but when it comes to giving their heart they won't do it right we see a lot of that that's we're not immune to that in message churches where people will come they'll sit on a Pew and then they'll they'll give a little bit but they don't give their lives and they don't they don't they the that that they don't interact with people you know they come to church sing the song hear the sermon walk right back out the door and go live their life Peter had a sword he pulled that sword and was going to and cut the high priest's ears off and he did that but when it came to real Christian Courage he didn't have it he backed down backed up and he denied him is that right he C he could cut off the priest's ear with a sword sure he knowed how to handle the sword but when it came to squeeze time to stand on the word of God he didn't have the courage and he even denied knowing Jesus and that's where it is today we've got courage to build buildings and put millions of dollars in them we've got courage to to put uh pipe organs and plush seats and everything and to go out and protite from place to P place oh my goodness is this is this a message Church wow is this the state of of so many message churches today we got we got the we got the funds we're going to build a bigger church it's going to be nice we're going to have the best sound equipment we're going to have the best broadcast system so we can pratite from church to church wow but when it comes to Christian Courage to accept the word the message of God and stand there on it brother Ram says this we are few we are few l so what good is your stones without a stonemason God's looking for character not membership character now I tell you even here today in this church and I and we're this is one of the most beautiful churches that I know of but if you come here today and you're just a member of this church you might as well just W walk out right back out the door and go live your life somewhere else you can't be just a member of the church no brother BR says I ain't looking for members I'm looking for the pure in heart people that'll believe the word amen thank you Lord people have so much difficulty overcoming because they because they don't fully commit to this and they hold too much back now you can be committed to the message and you can be committed to God and you and you go through a growth process now I don't not very many of us just just commit ourselves to God and we start changing and and and boom we become this mature Christian overnight I don't I don't believe that I believe God changes our heart instantly but we got a lot of things to sh sh out of ourselves especially when we've been in the world for so long we got a lot of bad habits that we got to lose and we got a lot of growing to do but if you don't commit fully you're never going to shake those things off brother brother Rand goes on he says and another sermon faith faith is our Victory he says but when it comes to Christ you're scared to take him at his word how is it faith is a victory you could submit your case to Jesus Christ tonight just as you and he's he's talking about healing here just as you submit your case to the doctor but he says you we're we're afraid to take him at his word and that's and that's what we do we're we're too many times the best Among Us here were afraid to take him at his word I'm afraid sometimes to take him at his word what if it doesn't happen what if I pray for somebody to be healed and I say I I say I proclaim the word the word says you're healed okay there's there's no two ways about it if I pray for for my wife and I prayed for her back that she's got a spinal fracture and I say and I pronounce God has healed you because according to the word she's been healed 100% thank you Lord and and then I we go to the doctor and the fracture still there and well did I not have enough Faith you know and so you start to question right and you start to wonder you know maybe maybe God's not going to keep his word you know maybe maybe he's going to keep it a different way or something you know but we become afraid that God's going to keep his word and if God can't keep his word for healing can he keep his word for salvation can God really keep that which I've committed against him till that day is he is he able to do it and we become afraid you know sometimes well it's real easy to accept that he's going to he's saved us and we have salvation but it's really hard to accept you know the other things that he tells us we ought to be to be peacemakers and to be to to to have love for one another and to be kind and and and we want to kick against those things in our lives and not kick kick the bad stuff out of our life he says but he says youve got you'll have faith that overcomes you'll never hunt another prayer line You'll never hunt nothing else you'll have it right there it'll be settled you'll never jump from church to church to see if this one has got it or that one has got it or they haven't got it what's important is you've got it you can't jump from place to place and and and think oh it's going to be better over here and it's going to be better over there when you don't have it and if you do have it why not stay in the place that needs your help but too many times we get we get just a little bit uncomfortable with something and and we leave be instead of instead of trying to become part of the solution to a problem brother Bram says in identification we're told in Scripture that when David when the enemy was coming in and they had assembled together David was trying to tell them about God and they're stood up one in their midst and actually this isn't David this is uh je King Jehoshaphat the the the this brother brandham says the wrong I just caught that brother brandham said the wrong wrong one here Jehoshaphat they was they was facing an army uh uh three different armies of Invaders had come and they were they were coming to to destroy Israel and Jehoshaphat the king gathered the people and they're all there in Jerusalem at the temple and they're praying and asking God what should we do what can we do what will we do and a man stands up a prophet and says that don't worry Don't Fear God's going to deliver the people this day the armies are going to be here he said he said you go out to the end of this this Creek this Brook and you're going to stand there and you'll watch the Lord deliver you and so Jehoshaphat gathered the people and he said they uh the scripture says that they marched out there singing and Triumph like they had already won the battle they got there they set their forces in Array and then God came and and this group started fighting this group started fighting this group and they all killed one another to the point where it says the the the Bible says that it took three days to gather the spoils 3 days to gather all the gold rings and earrings and all the jewelry and all the all the all of that stuff three days and and then the important other important thing is they came right back to Jerusalem rejoicing and praising God the same way that they went see they had a victory they had a victory and they weren't ashamed about it thank you Lord they didn't even have to do anything cuz God fought the battles you know but you know just to kind of believe I just have to skip too much too much to get through this quickly uh when you have a victory have you ever noticed that people treat you a little bit differently that that when you're happy yeah and you get around some of those people that aren't as happy as you they treat you a little odd they they have like a little bit different oh well you're just too spiritual oh you're just faking it and putting it on oh well that brother he's just you know you you you know we always have those little weirdos in the message uh you know oh god i' I've been called odd and strange and that that's just recently but you know I'm I'm grateful for what God's done for me there there was somebody in the Bible who got who saw somebody getting the Victory and was and and despised that person I don't know if you remember the story of of uh uh David's wife was a was a uh I I think I have it down here somewhere mik Micah Michael something like that I can't I can't remember just exactly but you remember I what I do remember is as as David was bringing the ark into the city the victory that they had and they're marching into the City and and singing the songs and Tamarin and the harps and the the trumpets and everything's going on and David is dressed in a says in a linen EOD and he's just dancing before the Lord he was so happy he had such a tremendous Victory and and she looked out of her window and said the scripture says she despised him in her heart despised him and there's then there's plenty of people that around that sit around in a message Pew that when they see you have the victory they despise you in their heart that they despise that you've overcome because they haven't done it eles and they see that you have something that they don't they can't get it they want it maybe they've given up on on ever getting it and they despise you am it happens I know it does brother brandom says it's a uh it's a terrible thing to a terrible devil to despise or dislike he says you mustn't do that he says you you can't ever cast a devil out by the wrong attitude it takes love to do that and love is the most powerful force that is here in the world a devil is always hate when people hate someone remember that's a terrible devil if if we if you ever look at somebody and and hate them in your heart that's that's what like police people call a clue that you've got something wrong right but we see that we see it in the message and maybe you've ran up against it brother brandom says how can men be so religiously blind become narrow-minded because of denominational barriers and hate their Brethren without a cause I'd say it like this how can how can messaged people become so religiously blinded and become so narrow-minded because of their particular Doctrine barrier oh we're perusia we're seven Thunders we're this we're that and hate their Brethren Without a Cause amen he says he says this he says it's so narrow and so little and they do it because of their Prestige because they want to be important wow and there's there's a lot of things out out there that that are in that are among star ranks as message Believers where people believe this and they draw their circle around it and they've got their top top Doctrine and the guy who came up with it and and everything else and you know what they you know a lot of them say well you just need a revelation to see this you just need a revelation and and I I'm of the opinion that if if I don't see it in the the word if I don't see it in scripture and if I don't see it in brother brandom in the message that he brought that that your Revelation is out of line some you somebody revealed something to you but it wasn't the Holy Ghost I'm not really interested in in in your your personal revelation amen God's not going to reveal reveal something that's the problem with legalism people people have they they'll they'll say well I uh you know God's revealed to me that that I have to I women have to wear their dress down to their their feet and then you got somebody else says well God revealed to me that that I could wear them to my knee well God's not going to reveal two different things to two different people I don't know what spirit's speaking to either one of you but it's not the same Spirit God doesn't give one group of his his elect one Revelation and then and then this group over here you know they got a different Revelation on the same subject that's not how God works either one of you is right and one of you is wrong so it has to go back to the word it has to line up to the word we we listen we'll we'll all be a lot better off if we just stick exactly with what the prophet said and what's in scripture and if God God convicts you a certain way and and and you don't feel like you feel like you need to dress this way and this is true Holiness don't you go and put that on some somebody else that's your that's your own conviction and it's good for you and maybe God gave it to you and you feel good dressing that way and you feel that that's Holiness and it looks right and it looks great and you're happy that's good but don't you go and put that on somebody else now the Bible doesn't have have I'm sorry brother Dell I probably shouldn't even talk Bible didn't ever put out some measuring stick and say your dress needs to be so many cubits long it didn't not that I know of it says dress dress humbly don't don't dress like a rich person and you know show off your wealth amongst poor people it says be dressed in humility don't don't you know man don't dress like a woman a woman don't dress like a man and that pretty much covers everything you know if your if your dress is showing off as a woman if it's showing off your curves on the front and on the back and it stands out and you notice that men are turning and looking at you and I don't know of any woman that that doesn't notice it then you're you're dressed inappropriately that's just that's just all there is to it but if you're dressed and and you your husband appreciates how you're dressed and you look and you feel pretty and and uh you don't notice guys turning their heads every time you walk down the grocery aisle or or down the aisle at church then then uh I'd say you're all right yeah thank you Lord good I shouldn't say things like that not not in my own pull pit oh my just trying to see what what all to to skip brother brandom says uh notice that the natural always tries to type the spiritual and he talks about Jacob and Esau and he said Esau was actually a better man than Jacob in the sight of man and he talks about him taking care of his daddy he said but but Jacob his whole soul was to get that birth right and that's what God recognized in him that was spiritual he says and it's always caused the natural to hate the spiritual he gives some some examples of Cain and Abel and and Kora Dam uh Moses and Judas and Jesus it causes a natural to hate the spiritual and he says they try to destroy the influence they try to destroy everything and it's nothing but jealousy and when you get around people and all they want to do is criticize and condemn someone else there's something wrong trying to undermine somebody else's influence if I get if I get around you know people I don't know and the first thing that they want to do is tell me how how this other person is bad and wrong and and look at what they're doing this thing and that thing there's something wrong with that person you know they there's jealousy going on there's something something that's happening but I can tell you one thing uh as for me when I get around people I don't especially if you've never known if I'm telling somebody about brother Dale I'm not going to tell tell people bad things about brother Dale there's not much bad there to tell anyway but you know if I knew if I knew something bad about brother Dell I wouldn't be like well yeah you can go on up there to brother brother Dell's church but you know he's a little bit like this and he's a little bit like that no I'm not I'm just going to be like yeah go on up there try it out if if you see something you don't like you'll you'll notice it I don't need to undercut somebody's influence what if somebody what if somebody came up here and had just the most amazing blessing you know I told I I I told him stay away from Brother Dell because he's he's he's not you know he's not on the word on this one particular thing him and he he and I disagree about this so you stay away and then they come and they get a real good blessing what's what do they think about me any what's wrong with you I went there and got blessed and you say it's bad I don't I we shouldn't seek to destroy anybody's influence he goes on he says uh in Joseph meeting his Brethren says we believe by faith we receive it uh but try to skip some of this he he talks about how Paul is preaching and the the the man fell out of the Loft killed himself and Paul raised him up and talks about Elijah raising up the baby the boy um and he says men even without the blessing of the Holy Ghost done Miracles and these F fellows are afraid to attack with the Holy Ghost my how pitiful and he says he goes on he he kind of jumps thoughts just a little bit and and he goes back to talking about he goes back to talking about those that that hate hate you and he says why it's because they're arrogant and they hate their Brethren Without a Cause just if Joseph was was hated Without a Cause amen is not because he was worthy to be hated since they did not believe him and he was living in a different realm and he says and I say this now as our time is getting short I say this with all tress of heart they hate the church today that has the supernatural it's jealousy and it's petty jealousy and it exists among human beings and you look at at a church that is moving and has a spirit of God moving in it and people are being saved people are coming in off the streets and it's growing and watch how many people want to become critical of it and they'll find something to pick it apart and say well well this Doctrine is a little bit off or this this is here is just a little bit wrong and this oh this brother you know 20 years ago he did something or recently as I heard well that that brother's father who used to be the pastor he did this 30 years ago and he's been dead for 10 but I'm still holding it against that church wow what is it brother Brion called it jealousy petty petty jealousy and we're not immune to it he said the disciples had it they were so ashamed of themselves 10 10 days before God gave them the power to heal the sick and to cast out devils and raise the dead and they had an epilepsy boy before them and failed to cast it out and Jesus came came came to the the mount and he healed the boy and they asked him why couldn't we do it and he said he didn't say I I took my power back he said I I gave you power I showed you where he give it but you can't show me where he took it back but brother BR talking about what we still have and what did Jesus rest his his words on he said because of your unbelief you couldn't do it yeah we're too afraid to to believe for the big things yeah oh well God will heal my headache yeah I can believe for a headache I it's it's going away one way or the other it's only going to be a couple hours so I can just Mo God healed my headache it took him two hours to heal it but he healed it but we don't want to say God can heal my cancer right yeah amen amen it's true a few days later they found a man that in that was was not in their ecclesiastical realm and they heard Jesus pronounce these things and he was casting out devils and Peter and John came and uh to tell him not to do it because he didn't belong to their their group and said oh well you're going to have to follow us and link up with with us we're the church and he let them and the man let them know to attend their own business he was getting along pretty pretty well without joining the apostles organization right they went back to Jesus and said we found him and he was casting out devils and they were jealous because he was doing what they couldn't do they got carnal so they came back and tattled on him and told Jesus and Jesus said let him alone he's doing a good work he's doing what I commanded you to do and you fail to do it see when we see people doing the supernatural when we see the supernatural at work and we don't have it in our own lives we start to get a little bit jealous we start to find find reasons to to put that person down and you wonder you wonder why when people walk away why they when when people walk away from this message and this is really truly what I'm getting at when people leave or have issues with the message is because it's not real in their own life right amen they see it happening in your life they seen it happen in their parents' life they've seen the things of God they seen people be healed but it never happened for them because they never fully committed to it in their heart they sat they sat on a church pew as a member of the of the church and they contributed they paid tithes they gave offerings they helped build a bigger church but they never committed to it in their heart and we just have to move past people like that we have to overcome and you know and we have to I'm in I'm in the position where two of my siblings my only two siblings both of them left the message and you know they'd say well we're we're free now to do you know what we want to do we're free to to dress this way and we're free to to you know buy every type of liquor we want to buy and we can we can uh just you know be what we want to be and we're we're still saved by God because God Saves us and I just have to feel sorry for him even even I have a SI a sibling who went as far as to attack the message and her and her husband made a website and I not going to say what that website is but like if you if you consider the top three websites that are against this message they're they're one of the top three and they've influenced a lot of people and I I I hate what they've done but I still love him I still love him and I have to realize that you know that uh that that's the devil and say that's that's not that wasn't my sister that wasn't her husband it's the devil and see that's that's overcoming that's that's how you overcome so overcome brother Bram says is to recognize the devil and every one of his tricks and to realize that that there's a devil and there's people who don't believe in the devil right which is a shame because the devil sure believes in them he's just he's just as real brother brand says you you must recognize he says you recognize him the devil you know that he's a devil and he's against you and then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is and that's the one in you that has already overcome him and by his grace you are more than a match for him amen that's real overcoming when you recognize and and and I I pray this Lord help me to recognize the enemy every one of his tricks and I have issues with people that sit in message church I have issues with men that preach behind message pull pits that have personal issues with me and and I have to I have to check myself because I can get an attitude and I've had and I have had an attitude and then had to like reel it back in and say no that is not my brother that is the devil and I'm sorry that the devil has that my I'm sorry that my brother has this weak area that the devil has been able to influence and use in this way and he hasn't overcome that and it hurts me and it and it is painful for me but that isn't my brother and I still love him I still pray for him and I still want good things for him and I just pray I just have to tell myself pray that that that God reveals to him that weak spot and until then what am I going to do I'm going to try to my best to cover it with prayer for him brother Bram says and why are we not a denomination he says now uh he says I charge you before Jesus Christ to stay right here with it and and don't don't let things get among you keep everything ironed right now and move right on he says you are Brethren and it's never your brother or sister that does anything wrong how number one how could they if they're a child of God they can't sin right they can't sin now the flesh can sin right amen and that's the devil acting brother Brandon says it's the spirit of the devil gets in there and he goes around he says just feel sorry for the brothers sister and know that is Satan getting in between and if you have some feeling about about it some negative feeling you get that right out of you right quick because it'll canker you so just stay away from it and and there's people that I talked to and i' i' I'm a a victim of this myself and maybe some of you to here today are as well that things have happened to you in your church life in your church experience that have hurt you that have caused you to go from I can't stay at this church and I've gone to this church and you happy there for a while and then more things happened and you got wounded there so you left and you gone from place to place or you've held something against somebody for years because of the hurt that they did to you and we need to forgive them and really truly realize that wasn't our brother that was or our sister that was just the devil it was the devil I'm going to pray for that person genuinely pray for him not not pray for him like God I hope you give them some fivefold Ministry just slap the devil right out of them no but genuinely be feel sorry for that person and pray for him that's the attitude that I want to have and I think that's the attitude that Christ wants us to have I don't want to be cankered up with bitterness and and and act that way brother Bram says it's a promise God made the promise let's stay with it God promised it no matter what you're going to have a battle if everything comes low and lazy why what are you overcoming what are you overcoming if you walk through this church life and you never had a battle I doubt you know what you know what the first thing that comes to my mind if I somebody tells me brother John I've been a Christian for 40 years I've never had a battle with anybody I've never had a struggle I come to church praise praise the Lord I pay my TI and and everything's just been gravy uh you know for 40 years you know what I thinking well the devil must not have to worry about you right he knows you ain't got it right see those one of two things either the devil ain't worried about you because he knows you ain't got it or you're living in such a high place that the devil don't want to come near you and touch you so one or the other and there's a whole lot more people that that think they think they got it they're in the [Music] other says you you uh you've got to overcome something and you got to have some obstacles you so you tell me you don't have no problems or no obstacles I I'm doubting your testimony I'll just tell you right now um maybe you don't have no obstacles right now but you've had them and you're going to have them uh people that's different and fuss with you and tell you you're holy rulers and things like that who's put put that's put before you it's a trial and if you haven't got that then you're not even in the battle I should just let brother brandham say it says what do you join the CH the church what what did you join the Army and get training for to lay around strut up and down the streets and show off say that's the way some Christians act and we want to be looked up to that's the way some message people act there everybody wants to be special everybody wants to be told that that that they're the elect and they're the called out and they're saved one of the kids we watched a cartoon with the kids a long time ago and I know exactly which which one it was but uh it was a silly show but in in the the show the bad guy uh it was like they were superheroes and the bad guy made gadgets that gave everybody the ability to do things that the superheroes did uh so you know like if there's a superhero that could fly you know well here's a jetpack now you can fly stuff like that but he made this comment he said when everybody's special no one is right if everybody's special no one is and everybody wants to be us the special even when they're not even when they don't put the work into it everybody wants to wants to come and they want to be sit on on church and be told you're sitting in the last day's message underneath a Vindicated prophet and you've got it but a lot of people don't want to commit their hearts to it they don't want to line up with what the word says let people don't want to line up with with what brother brandom said most a whole lot of Christians and a whole lot of messaged Believers don't want to line up with what the Bible says let alone the message why you worrying about what brother brandom said when you don't even want to line up with what the Bible says we've got to overcome we've got to we've got to fight and there's going to be a battle he says uh he he goes on he says that's the way some Christians act we want to be looked up to he says you a't going to be looked up to you're going to be looked down on for all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions pick up the sword cut everything free from you and keep going on that's powerful amen sanctify us Lord fill us a new with the Holy Spirit May the Holy Ghost just reign in our hearts supremely that we'll walk forgetting the things that are in the past the muck and the me that we once live I say not just that but Lord help us to walk that your Holy Ghost Reigns in our hearts supremely that we can walk the walk and forget the things that we we went through at the last church and we can forget the things that our brother did to us two years ago or 10 years ago and we can walk past out of that muck and that Meer and press towards the mark of the High Calling where the lights can shine in sweetness and humility till every passor by can say there's a Christian that lives there on that Hill that person that woman that man is a real consecrated flower of God they're so sweet and so kind always loving and sweet and understanding he's praying Grant it father let us be salty that the Earth might thirst Grant it father and over that we can overcome the things of this world and the cares of this life and that and that's the testimony that I want when people talk about brother John they don't they don't say that I always look angry and upset and that I I always look like a uh you know I look like a soldier or something like that I want them to say he's loving that he's sweet not only and that he's understanding you know if I tell him about my faults or my mistakes he's not going to judge me he's going to he's going to say something to encourage me he's going to say something that maybe will'll help me out in this battle and give me some good advice you know from the word and and I think that's the testimony that you all want to have as well he says in in adoption and and I'm closing now this is the last quote I'll read he says that's what's bothering me though 12 12:23 so I'm hurrying it up says that's what's bothering me though to preach to you people don't remain in the same condition you've been going in change now and that's the that's what your pastor here preaches every Sunday and every Wednesday when he's preaching is don't stay the same way you've been and it doesn't matter if you if you're a holy ghost filled or not there's always room to grow there's always more of God to learn about there's always room for improvement and until until we go home we're going to be growing don't stop growing and your pastor's understanding and if you come to him and you tell him you know I'm struggling with this and I'm struggling with that then your pastor with a pastor's heart is going to have compassion right amen going to pray with you he's going to seek the Lord for you and and don't I know brother Dell and you know like ministers we talk together a little bit and we don't tell every when we talk to Ley and and and somebody you know that's not a minister we don't we don't have the conversations that we have like we do with another Minister you know cuz Ministry we keep things in confidence and we don't talk we don't talk about um uh certain things with with with just with lay but between ministers that we experience the same types of battles and we have the same types of concerns we'll share some small things with one another we don't share everything but you know brother Dell tells me things and I know he's praying for you I know that you know like he'll tell me a little something about a situation and and and he shows me here I I've been searching through the scripture to find answers for this to to be able to explain it better to be you know so to give that person more confidence you're your pastor fights for you he gives us time and sacrifices to be in the word to be in prayer to search the scripture that that that he has the word to give you for your problem and your issues you know the funny thing is is like most of the time we don't even want to tell the pastor where we got something going on uh you know like we get a little bit embarrassed about it or something and we just well you know the Lord the holy spirit will move on him and he'll preach about some way and and we we think we got way too much courage to tell tell the pastor what's going on with somebody else we ought to have a little bit more courage to tell him what's going on with us he says don't remain in the same condition he says hear me as I say it thus saith the Lord I've never called myself this but you call me your Prophet or a prophet the world believes that the world around millions and millions of people and I've spoke directly and indirectly to 10 or 12 million people uh and I've seen tens of thousands of visions and signs and wonders and not one of them has ever failed and that's right he's foretold me things that's never failed to happen just exactly I'll bring any man to trial for that that that's right I don't claim to be a prophet but you listen to me thus sayeth the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place because for that's all that there was there no matter how much money no matter what money how much religious demonstrations how many Good Deeds you've done or whatever you've done that won't count nothing on that day it'll take perfect love so whatever you do lay aside everything else until you are just so filled with the love of God till you can love those who hate you amen I I'd say it like this it doesn't matter how much offerings that you put in the offering plate it doesn't matter uh how long you've sat on a message Pew it doesn't matter how many times you've helped people move houses or or or done you know good things for people it won't count for nothing it'll take perfect love and Lord help us when we have attitudes towards people that have that have hurt us and and we have awe in our heart against them and we won't let it go for years and years to hang on to things that's not the love of Jesus Christ that's not the love but I believe the bride will have that love and I believe that each and every one of us can get get there and and I I'm telling you this and saying this if you feel like I'm pointing a finger at you cuz I I know this this sermon has been very could be taken as like almost negative like I'm getting on to you or something now I brother brother Dale has never told me anything that would make me preach this sermon to say this to you but I tell you what it is is if you feel like I have one finger pointing at you believe me I've got the other three pointing right back at me because that's too easy for me to get attitude I my family are legendary Grudge holders and we can hold grudges and build walls not only build the wall we'll dig a moat we're going to fill that with water and then we're going to put oil on top of the water we're going to set the oil on fire so the water is burning and you aren't coming anywhere near my castle I say Lord help me God help me I want to have that type of love I want to have that type of attitude that the people that have hurt me because I've been hurt many times by many people people have said things about me that ought never to have been said lied about me said things that that oh thank you sweetie lied about me said things that uh weren't true in any way shape or form just to undercut my influence to undercut uh what people would accept from me and it it e it is real easy for me to continue to hold that stuff against them and every even now some of that that happened 10 years ago I have to go back and I have to remind myself John that wasn't your brother that wasn't your that wasn't your brother that was just the devil that got in there and yes it hurt the hurt was real the pain was real and it took you a while to get over it and and I tell you what even today even today I have a problem trusting people because of the things that I've experienced while while being in this message in the way the people has acted to trust I I have a very difficult time doing it and that's why when I make a friend I hold on to that friend when I find a good man I hold on to that good man and it's one of the reasons why I'm so proud to have brother Dale as my friend is he's he's a good man if we we don't agree on everything last night we were talking about a a small little thing that we disagree about in the word but you know what it don't matter don't matter one bit it's it's perfectly fine we we love one another we're shake shake hands and it's like it doesn't matter about it doesn't pertain to anything important salvation and brother Dell's my friend we've known each other now going on 10 10 years if at least ever since you had the the church over at the the house I think I was one of the first people to come and Minister for you and brother Dell has been a true friend to me and I have somebody like that I latch on to them because I don't have many good friends we have a lot of acquaintances a lot of people that you meet all on your journey and you might like them and enjoy them and you see them you know once and you're happy to see them again but there's very few uh people that I I call my friend uh that a true friend and so I'm I'm grateful I'm grateful for your pastor and I want you to be just as grateful for him as I am and uh have Grace for for him because he's still growing too maybe one day he'll actually agree with me on the thing we were talking about maybe maybe God will have me agree with him either way it don't matter it doesn't matter a bit uh I love you and I'm grateful for each one of you being here today and I hope I hope something was said that just kind of help encourage you along the way if not just to change your views that you that you've had for a while to to help you get past some hurt and pain just let some things go and I I know this has been a longer service so let's just stand and uh musicians you can come bless Jes Jesus you can just play something soft doesn't matter um let's let's bow our heads together uh let let me ask you this and and I'm I'm not looking but God God's looking how would you be honest enough to raise your hand and say say to the Lord I I've held on to things for a little bit too long things that I ought not to have held on to how many would be honest enough and recognize that the the past hurts that you've experienced to realize that wasn't your brother and not I'm not saying that they didn't hurt you I'm not saying that your hurt your pain isn't real but to really truly say in your heart God I know that wasn't my brother that wasn't my sister that was the devil would and would you take the step to release your bitterness and your pain and give it to the Lord and I believe God sees those hands that that were raised let's just pray Lord God I'm so grateful for your word it corrects us it teaches us so that we can be become more like you you're a good God you love your children and you you've you've brought us to your side and you you've you hover over us in our life and yet we still go through things that we don't understand we've had people hurt us we've been hurt some of us have held on to those things for years ear Lord you seen the hands tonight uh this morning that were raised that testify to you that they understand that that was the devil that it wasn't their brother and then they you seen the hands that were raised and said they willing to let that go thank you and Lord I pray I pray for them now you would bless them that your spirit would would come and and whenever you take something out of a person's life there's a there's a empty hole there thank you Jesus and people with bitterness and anger they think about that and they Fester over it for so long and it becomes almost like a comfort to them and they they don't let it go but they said they're going to let it go and now they're not going to think about those things no more they're not going to every day think about something that that that person did but I pray Lord that your spirit would Place something in their heart in his place that they think about the promises that you've made that that your word is Promised an overcoming power and that they just overcame something Lord that that you would bless them in every way bless this church Lord I pray bless each one that's under the sound of my voice Lord let them know how much you love them how wonderful and how truly special they are to be elected in this generation thank you despite all the things that they've gone through Lord you've been there with them each step of the way you'll never leave us nor forsake us we commit this word into your hands Lord For Your Glory we give you thanks and praise in Jesus Christ's name amen Pastor D It's Been Good to Be With You friends and I love you appreciate you and if there's anything that I can do for you just let me know you need somebody to pray with you or or talk with you and I'm I'm here for each one of you I do amen just appreciate the word this morning is beautiful and I just want to say one thing brother John was kind of closed on you know the the greatest Deliverance that I've received is the people that have done something to you if you can get to the point that you can genuinely pray for their benefit for their good sometimes I'll see a picture come out I said God you bless their family and their children abundantly and it will be unbelievable the Deliverance that'll come in your life because of it amen we just praise God for it just thank you and we love and appreciate you're welcome to Fellowship I know it's longer but I just want to do one one little thing just in a few minutes you can keep playing honey I just want to just enjoyed this service but I I wanted to share a couple quick testimonies and I know we're over limit but it's cold outside and and then I I want to pray for Sister Laura and and I want to I want some of the brothers or that that really believe you know sometimes we have a thought that God has to do it my way and you know Sister Laura is going to a hospital and they're going to witness to those people amen God could have healed sister Lord she made her body God made her body that's like a piece of cake but God's got an agenda for her to touch somebody else's life and her Affliction this ain't a mistake God didn't not heal the prayer he's actually going to heal somebody else's prayer and just changing your idea amen God didn't fail amen and so you know you know when we shared our our our our thing to nicar last week I'd actually forgot and and uh and God brought it back to my memory but when we were going to Nicaragua we were almost in an accident the van went to pull out a pass and semi and another car was coming up beside us to pass us and you know we Overlook those things I've been in accidents in other countries serious accidents and and actually the people thought we were dead in Uganda but you know God God's not making mistakes he's there all the time we come home we just driving and you think of brother Bart driving this weather went home and trucks and cars in the ditch on 8 Highway we just take for granted that we're not in the ditch but God has a purpose for everything and he's protecting us and even if you're in an accident it's for you're good in that and so our little grandson brother uh Oliver you know the doctors everything that has happened you say why was he born premature he he's he's contradicted everything the doctors ever said and so said this week they said we're going to eventually take the feed in tuo cuz he was eating so good and before they were PL days before they were pled on taking it up he ripped it out and they said well he's just eating good enough we don't need it but see God has a plan you see what I'm saying that it's a testimony to them it's a testimony to my son and and Riley amen it's so and it's the same with Sister Laura and so we're not we're not going to pray for sist the Lord and say God change your idea we're just going to say God just be there and witness to the doctors witness to the nurses witness to the people that you go up the elevator to and when when you just direct the healing of sister Lis doctors can't heal nobody they can just do what they they know science but then God will come in and take all the pain away and then who knows that there'll be somebody Sav because of it amen just like brother John was talking about this denominational pastor we
