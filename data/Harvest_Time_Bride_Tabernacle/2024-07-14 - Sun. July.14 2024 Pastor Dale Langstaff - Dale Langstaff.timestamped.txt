[29:22] whole Revelation amen and you know uh
[29:25] early in the week Revelations 181
[29:29] [Music]
[29:33] uh I had absolutely zero intention of
[29:37] preaching part
[29:39] two of this
[29:42] message and uh I would have said I was
[29:45] finished completely finished with it and
[29:48] so me and God were having a a
[29:51] fight and
[29:55] uh Pastor Bley sent me a
[30:01] video and that tipped the
[30:04] balance amen let's read our scripture
[30:07] here and Matthew 18:1 and at the same
[30:11] time came the disciples unto Jesus
[30:13] saying who is the greatest in the
[30:16] Kingdom of Heaven Lord Jesus we pray
[30:18] that you'll ask add your blessing to
[30:20] this word and Lord God you know you know
[30:23] before the foundation of the world what
[30:25] was on the screen and Lord we're just in
[30:28] obedience to your leadership this
[30:30] morning Lord God lord we in the flesh
[30:33] would have went a different way but Lord
[30:35] we surrender to what you have for your
[30:39] people may you bless them and help them
[30:42] in a special way Lord I pray that you'll
[30:45] be with the speaker this morning and I
[30:47] pray that you'll be with the hearer and
[30:49] help them to to know that this is not
[30:51] just a man's idea but it's from the
[30:54] Throne of God and we give you the glory
[30:57] for Lord Jesus for your name sake
[31:01] amen man you may have your seats and
[31:03] brother Matt is just amazing to see you
[31:06] and awesome and God bless you and the
[31:10] family
[31:14] amen
[31:18] hallelujah you know we read uh just to
[31:21] to to lay uh you know we preached on uh
[31:23] blessed are those that are not offended
[31:25] in me and uh and you know I want I want
[31:29] to maybe uh just uh lay a a quick
[31:32] foundation and then continue on with a
[31:35] thought of God here but here here in the
[31:38] a perfect uh in the power of
[31:40] transformation this is right before the
[31:41] prophet died he said see perfect
[31:44] Fellowship he said oh it's a deep
[31:46] mystery this was the last quote I read
[31:48] last Sunday he said it's a deep mystery
[31:50] of God and he said how wonderful that
[31:52] God could have fellowship with us it was
[31:56] it was a mystery that God planned on
[31:59] Heaven fellowship with us and you
[32:02] know you know uh we we know that the
[32:06] word is the greatest part but when you
[32:08] have the baptism of the Holy
[32:11] Ghost you are the
[32:13] word and so then what becomes the
[32:16] greatest part is not the
[32:18] word no I'm not leaving the word it's
[32:24] Fellowship but see cuz in John 1:1 it
[32:27] says in the beginning was the word and
[32:29] the Word was
[32:33] God and God was every bit of the
[32:36] word but he still desired his greatest
[32:40] desire wasn't the word wasn't
[32:44] himself God's greatest desire was not
[32:47] himself he would have never left heaven
[32:50] and died on a tree for
[32:51] me his greatest
[32:54] desire was
[32:56] Fellowship his great like you got to get
[32:59] that your greatest desire of
[33:02] Jehovah is
[33:05] fellowship because he was all of the
[33:08] word and he wanted
[33:12] fellowship and we in this message of the
[33:14] hour we have the revealed Mysteries
[33:16] revealed and the the Mysteries and we we
[33:18] understand the the the Bible and it's a
[33:20] new book but we run from fellowship our
[33:25] society runs from fellowship we are
[33:27] Facebook
[33:29] screen uh junkies and we text junkies
[33:33] and and you know what's up junkies we
[33:36] never talk to anybody we don't see the
[33:38] reaction we're afraid of people's
[33:40] reactions we're afraid of people we will
[33:43] text people things that we would never
[33:45] say in their presence they' punch Us in
[33:47] the
[33:49] nose amen and this is you know God has
[33:53] never changed and I I just want to just
[33:56] lay this Foundation here
[33:58] here here you
[33:59] know
[34:01] um wow there's just a lot to this you
[34:04] know why why are Christians so
[34:08] offended because other people are
[34:10] different do you know brother Bram said
[34:14] you may have a different Revelation a
[34:16] different Doctrine a different Customs
[34:19] but God was a god of
[34:21] variety still the word I'm not talking
[34:24] about leaving the word a god of right do
[34:26] you know brother Brown said 30 five
[34:28] times that God was a god of
[34:30] vary he said that God was go you know
[34:34] you just to to lighten it up here
[34:36] something you know and my wife have
[34:38] differences I know that'll shock you but
[34:41] as soon as a tree dies in our front yard
[34:43] she wants to get the chainsaw and cut it
[34:45] down and I said man I wouldn't want to
[34:47] be an old person in your
[34:49] presence I mean she's going to get just
[34:51] throw you oh man it's going to be the
[34:53] farthest old age home you can ever see I
[34:56] said you know God like short trees and
[34:58] he likes baked monstrous oak trees he
[35:01] likes fat chubby evergreen
[35:03] trees and this will shock you but he
[35:07] actually likes dead trees
[35:09] too hello did you ever go to the
[35:13] Wilderness or or canara park or anywhere
[35:15] else and see no dad
[35:19] trees you know certain animals live in
[35:22] those dead trees they make their homes
[35:24] in those dead trees those dead trees
[35:25] have a purpose but we don't like that
[35:29] trees but see we don't like
[35:31] variety because we got this warped
[35:34] opinion and it's warped warped opinion
[35:37] of some Hollywood Guru that's straight
[35:41] from hell of this
[35:44] perfectional movie star
[35:46] life with no dead
[35:49] trees that's not who God
[35:53] is
[35:54] amen I believe God is a god of righty
[35:57] and he proves that in his word and he
[35:58] likes big mountains and he likes little
[36:00] mountains and he's got Plains and he's
[36:02] got deserts and he's got different
[36:04] things because he's made different and
[36:06] he wanted it to be that
[36:09] way
[36:11] amen he wanted it to be that way and he
[36:14] made season Summers and Winters and
[36:16] springs and Autumns and he made seasons
[36:18] and it showed that he's God of variety
[36:20] and he made you and a variety and some
[36:23] men real boisterous in a big mouth and
[36:27] fat like me and then there's other real
[36:29] dignified and Tiny and petite and others
[36:33] are fine and others are of different
[36:35] kinds and you just find that all the
[36:38] different kinds of
[36:40] people this he preached literally 10
[36:44] days before he died all the different
[36:46] kinds of people are in God's
[36:50] kingdom well I don't like how they are
[36:55] cuz God help us
[36:58] God help us you know he said God never
[37:01] was you know he he talked about it his
[37:04] uh steer and robox Harmony House that he
[37:08] used to be able to buy in Sears and he
[37:09] said God never made us like identical
[37:12] PEDs in the
[37:15] Pod but you struggle with that and you
[37:18] might as well just say Amen cuz God told
[37:20] me you did and brother Dale struggles
[37:23] with it too cuz anytime somebody's
[37:26] outside of the mold of who we think is
[37:28] acceptable to
[37:31] God Amen we struggle with it let me just
[37:36] look for my new scripture
[37:37] [Music]
[37:40] here forgive
[37:45] me well here we
[37:53] go man we read a scripture last week
[37:56] I'll scroll back to the top of the
[37:59] message and John 1 1 and3 and and we we
[38:03] know the first two verses very well but
[38:06] in John 1:3 it says maybe we need to
[38:08] pull this up Amy so we can see it all
[38:11] things were made by him
[38:15] God and without
[38:17] God was not
[38:20] anything made that was
[38:24] made amen
[38:30] sorry got to find back where I was
[38:38] again we struggle with that and this is
[38:41] what Pastor Bartley sent me and after I
[38:44] tell you this video and this
[38:48] research I'm going to ask the kids come
[38:50] up and help me
[38:53] preach we struggle with
[38:56] uniqueness we we struggle with the
[38:58] variety in the Christian family and
[39:01] that's why we are destroying each
[39:05] other just say Amen cuz this church
[39:08] ain't over full that's why your kids
[39:10] left the faith because they can find
[39:13] more fellowship with the world the
[39:17] devil than they can in the house of God
[39:20] now that is
[39:22] insane and it's got to
[39:25] change insane now the only thing you got
[39:29] to recognize is when you leave and you
[39:31] go to the devil's house the devil is to
[39:34] kill devour eat and Destroy and he's
[39:38] also the father of all the lies so what
[39:42] seems to be pury will not be pry all
[39:45] your life but it is still a deception in
[39:49] the bride of Christ and the sooner we
[39:51] wake up and recognize it the sooner
[39:53] we're going to get out of here and I'm
[39:55] getting sick of living in this place
[39:57] amen and so we got to recognize that
[40:01] different a me we're like watch this in
[40:03] our church we're not trying to
[40:09] copy except
[40:13] God do you know you want to look at uh
[40:17] we're going to touch on Church order and
[40:18] doctrines and you know Jesus preached
[40:21] Church order and Doctrine in the
[40:23] Bible I'm going to get into some of that
[40:26] but here's a
[40:28] survey and it's done and and I have it
[40:31] on my phone I'm not going to it's it's a
[40:33] it's a legitimate survey and Pastor
[40:35] Bartley from Jamaica sent it to me and
[40:38] after he sent it to me I was just like
[40:42] whoa and he said
[40:44] uh-huh
[40:47] whoa this is the
[40:49] survey he said a lot of Christians are
[40:52] leaving their
[40:54] faith and especially the young
[40:58] people now you might as well just say
[41:00] Amen to that because it's the facts
[41:04] churches are empty and
[41:07] out you know you can buy churches for a
[41:09] dime a dozen make a house out of
[41:12] them and the Pew Research Center showed
[41:17] that in the last 10 years do you know
[41:21] just I'm just going to stop here cuz I
[41:22] felt something come back just in case
[41:24] you don't believe in this survey the
[41:25] Bible says this because it says unless
[41:27] he shorten the days there would be none
[41:30] of you here cuz we would all be offended
[41:33] with each
[41:34] other amen now now now we want to stop
[41:38] here for a second and say now listen you
[41:39] know I had a pastor in another country
[41:41] say you know you can't help that other
[41:45] people are offended with
[41:48] you now let me explain that there's
[41:51] people offended this morning that I'm
[41:54] preaching there's people offended this
[41:56] morning that this churches here and
[41:59] there's people offended that you have
[42:01] long
[42:03] hair and that you wear a
[42:05] dress now that you can't
[42:08] help but what you can help is are you
[42:12] offended are you yourself offended with
[42:17] God and I'll guarantee you in the past
[42:20] you have been the Bible says unless he
[42:22] shorten the days that there would be
[42:25] nobody saved
[42:27] and because of that reason he would
[42:29] shorten the
[42:31] days hello amen thank you watch this he
[42:36] said 28% in the last 10 years
[42:40] 28% 10 years that's not very long since
[42:43] ilot was born since since Silas was born
[42:47] 28% of Christians have stopped being
[42:50] Christians that's
[42:52] crazy Hey listen listen we're going to
[42:55] talk about Grace and greasy Grace don't
[42:57] over preach the
[42:59] predestination predestination ain't so
[43:02] you can sin predestination ain't there
[43:04] so you can be mean to me and just think
[43:07] you're going to get away with it
[43:08] predestination and election ain't so you
[43:10] can just say mean things to your
[43:12] brothers and sisters and don't think
[43:13] God's going to be
[43:15] upset cuz he said it would be better
[43:17] that a millstone were hung around your
[43:19] neck and you were drowned in the deeps
[43:21] of the sea and had never been born
[43:27] that's what God thinks of
[43:31] election 28% of less Christianity left
[43:35] the church and become atheists or
[43:37] Anonymous which is nothing and watch
[43:40] this he said CH they are the ones that
[43:42] have left they are not impressed anymore
[43:45] by the
[43:47] drama
[43:53] drama and The Message Church
[44:00] Hallelujah the
[44:02] drama and the facts that Jesus was
[44:05] crucified and died 2,000 years
[44:09] ago now now listen I just want to just
[44:12] lay let the say no we're not preaching
[44:14] about people can backside and you
[44:16] condoning it no I'm not saying that but
[44:20] the Bible has a verse for that it says
[44:23] let them work out their own salvation
[44:25] with fear and trembling the prophet said
[44:28] you know when his son was backl he said
[44:30] you made the bad you go ahead and lie on
[44:32] the was going oh come and pray for me
[44:35] I'm sick I think I'm going to die daddy
[44:38] and you know what do you know what
[44:39] brother Bram said he said you can go
[44:41] ahead and do your own praying cuz you
[44:43] did the sin
[44:45] in so when if you leave this word of God
[44:48] and you leave this umbrella of
[44:50] protection under the the message of the
[44:52] hour or under the home and you get in a
[44:55] rotten situation don't come come here
[44:57] crying on my
[44:58] shoulders we're going to pray for the
[45:00] Believers not for the ones that
[45:04] left well that's what the prophet did
[45:06] you're looking at me funny that's right
[45:08] that's what the prophet did with his own
[45:11] kids that's right so you need to
[45:14] consider your sin but if somebody wants
[45:17] to
[45:20] sin you fighting with them ain't going
[45:22] to fix
[45:23] nothing just leave it
[45:28] alone just don't go down that
[45:35] road but I thought I would but I doing
[45:38] God a service without doing it God's
[45:41] will it's God that draws people to him
[45:44] not you it's God no man comes to the
[45:47] father unless the father draws
[45:51] them amen God help
[45:55] us and there search has found
[46:00] that in in they're searching in the
[46:03] people that has left they're searching
[46:05] for something that's more meaningful
[46:08] than this message of the
[46:10] hour now that is the saddest news that
[46:12] any person could hear how in the world
[46:15] that that's
[46:17] Insanity that you have you have peace
[46:20] love joy longsuffering and all these
[46:23] things kindness Perfection a perfect
[46:26] home home perfect family perfect God and
[46:29] you're going to leave that for something
[46:30] more
[46:35] meaningful that's not
[46:38] happening but see remember that they're
[46:41] they're tired of the
[46:43] drama they're tired of I know they're
[46:46] not going to like that I wore this color
[46:47] shirt this morning or the tie or my
[46:50] trousers don't match my shirt but I'm
[46:52] more worried about matching God's
[46:54] shirt amen does that sound familiar
[46:58] here amen and the con and science
[47:01] they're they're looking for something
[47:03] that's consistent with science and
[47:05] consistent with the principles that we
[47:07] know today and Islam is the answer for
[47:10] them and Islam is jumping on the
[47:13] opportunity don't look at me
[47:15] shocked as all these churches come empty
[47:18] in Toronto and Kitchener guess who buys
[47:20] them all before they even put the real
[47:22] estate sign up
[47:25] Islam Islam by them and they're spending
[47:28] they're instead of spending larger money
[47:31] to build new buildings they can buy the
[47:33] ones that the Christians paid for that
[47:35] they almost give away because nobody
[47:37] wants the
[47:38] drama because nobody can please anybody
[47:41] so they just stop
[47:43] going amen and they're turning these
[47:46] churches into mosque and into schools
[47:50] for the
[47:51] Muslims and he said watch he said you
[47:54] know many years ago when the Revival the
[47:56] Revival Age come out and the wesling and
[47:58] all those people come out and the great
[48:00] Revival age he said they were affecting
[48:03] the Muslim following and there was a
[48:05] great burst of many many churches built
[48:08] and the you know when brother Brown was
[48:09] here at the end of his life the 50s 60s
[48:12] 7s and and they were a Revival and he
[48:15] said they converted all of our people
[48:19] but he said now we're getting them all
[48:22] back the
[48:24] Muslims he said because we served he
[48:28] said we need to buy these churches that
[48:30] the Christians are closing because
[48:33] they're turning to Islam and we'll serve
[48:36] the same Community full of people in the
[48:39] same building worshiping a false
[48:46] god wow and someday oslam
[48:52] Muslim will have all these people and
[48:55] they will teach the Christian the
[48:57] exchristian children in the Muslim
[49:01] schools and today we're bringing the
[49:03] favor
[49:05] back to their the communities to worship
[49:08] the
[49:09] Muslims and we're bringing the light of
[49:12] Islam which is completely false and a
[49:16] complete
[49:17] lie and people are turning to that
[49:20] because
[49:22] Christians are not
[49:24] Christians message believers
[49:27] are not message
[49:28] Believers according to what God Said
[49:31] watch this here and and and and this is
[49:33] I know this is very hard for me too he
[49:36] says God has no amputation in the body
[49:40] he said before the foundation of the
[49:42] world looked down through the stream of
[49:43] time and saw that everything would be
[49:45] and therefore he could call the elect
[49:47] those who he knew that would would uh
[49:50] would be put into this building to this
[49:52] building that's right and if you've been
[49:54] called tonight by the Holy Ghost and
[49:56] given a chance into the kingdom of God
[49:58] you ought to be so happy amen and if
[50:00] you're in the kingdom of God you're a
[50:02] part of the body of Christ and thanks to
[50:06] God you live your life for God and you
[50:09] do the things that's right and remember
[50:11] now watch this this might sink in a
[50:14] little bit rough when it goes down here
[50:18] and it might let it let it die just for
[50:21] a bit but if you're in the body of
[50:23] Christ he doesn't have any
[50:31] amputations his
[50:33] body is perfect and it don't need any
[50:39] amputations that's the truth he said you
[50:41] know the other night I was preaching up
[50:43] the ladder and he said they don't take
[50:45] off an arm or a leg and he said when
[50:47] you're placed there he said it's placed
[50:50] there and it's the right
[50:52] material for sure watch this in in
[50:55] Colossians 3 3 4 and 2 just still laying
[50:58] a foundation set your affection on
[51:00] things above and not on things of the
[51:02] Earth for ye are dead and your life is
[51:04] hidden Christ and God and when Christ
[51:07] who is our life shall appear we shall we
[51:11] shall also appear with him in glory you
[51:15] know God never came to attack his family
[51:18] now we preached last Sunday and I hate
[51:20] reruns but you know when God was spoke
[51:24] the Elohim out from him he left being
[51:27] the self-existent one and he became a
[51:29] family man and and the Bible says that
[51:32] he was he he made something off of
[51:36] himself the little ones came off of
[51:39] himself amen and and so here we see that
[51:43] that God made all this variety off of
[51:46] ourselves but we we are going around as
[51:49] Believers cutting down the old
[51:52] trees and cutting down the little trees
[51:55] you know the neighbor was tell on us a
[51:57] few weeks back you know the town they
[51:59] last year they put the new Street in and
[52:01] the town gave and come and give them
[52:03] some little trees and they were hugely
[52:05] offended because the trees were so small
[52:07] they wouldn't even plant them in their
[52:08] front yard they planted them in the side
[52:10] yard out of the view because see we got
[52:12] this mentality that everything's got to
[52:14] be perfect from day
[52:16] one day one we're not planting a tree in
[52:18] our front yard unless it's between 6 to
[52:21] 10t tall
[52:23] period or it don't get the front yard
[52:25] cuz it's not special enough
[52:28] and that's how we run the Church of God
[52:31] if you're not 6 to 10 feet tall you're
[52:33] not special enough so you can't be in
[52:39] the and multiple multiple times I wish I
[52:42] could read all the things that God said
[52:44] on the variety if you want to look that
[52:46] up the God of variety you will be
[52:49] stunned at what he said you know he said
[52:53] he has look at the variety of
[52:54] nationalities and people and voices and
[52:57] and and singing and just you name it
[53:00] size and character and
[53:03] customs and all these
[53:06] things he here the prophet said this and
[53:09] and I'm going to in a minute I I I want
[53:11] the kids to come up and help me for a
[53:13] second because I want to go into Jesus
[53:15] preaching his church order and Doctrine
[53:17] for a minute he said the church has
[53:21] failed yep they failed but watch what
[53:24] they failed in instead of bringing
[53:26] people together in the
[53:29] body they've separated them right
[53:33] they've separated
[53:37] them if somebody walks in here and
[53:39] they're a sinter thoughts don't have no
[53:41] effect on me it's not like a reflection
[53:45] if anything it's a good reflection on us
[53:48] it it's not a negative reflection on us
[53:50] because somebody comes in that don't
[53:51] look like us the church is a hospital
[53:54] for crying out loud the only place they
[53:56] can get fixes in the Church of the house
[53:58] of God under the preaching of the word
[54:00] and it's not up to me how fast they get
[54:03] fixed it's not up to me to give them
[54:05] mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and say you
[54:08] know don't it's up to God called the
[54:11] anointing of the Holy
[54:14] Spirit but we don't trust God so we
[54:17] become to help God and we become doing
[54:19] God a service when it ain't even God's
[54:22] will because you know like the song
[54:25] writes nobody knows how God can can woo
[54:28] a sinner's heart to
[54:30] himself that's God's
[54:35] job amen and now you're a bornn again
[54:38] Christian and you will forget watch this
[54:40] you'll forget your differences and come
[54:42] together as a Christian ought to can we
[54:45] do something our King will come for us
[54:49] when we
[54:50] do amen but you know if you're a daddy
[54:54] in a family you you'll have people come
[54:57] to you or if you're a pastor in a church
[54:59] or that they'll say well Nobody Does it
[55:01] like that I say well praise the Lord
[55:02] we're the
[55:05] first well nobody but I don't feel well
[55:08] praise the Lord get
[55:11] comfortable cuz God's a god of
[55:15] vary
[55:17] uhhuh he said then will come the day
[55:20] when all will stand together as seen in
[55:23] Daniel in the Book of Daniel the king
[55:25] will be there with his bride and in
[55:27] front of them will be the multitudes of
[55:29] the world who will
[55:31] judge what I wanted to see was we' all
[55:34] be standing
[55:36] together can you imagine when God runs
[55:38] the white Throne judgment and the bride
[55:40] of Christ is there with us and we're
[55:42] judg in the world now just think about
[55:43] this this in just a little bit of a
[55:45] humorous way can you imagine the
[55:47] different varieties of
[55:51] opinions
[55:53] wow I wouldn't want to be the person
[55:55] like that keeps
[56:01] order wow well it'll take a an eternity
[56:05] to get through the first
[56:08] Soul cuz you'll have five trillion
[56:11] people have a different opinion and
[56:13] everyone will want to be
[56:18] heard the last message brother Brown
[56:20] preached would that be a good
[56:22] example communion he said it's a reubel
[56:26] that you're that I'm a part of him and
[56:29] I'm a part of you no no no no no no I'm
[56:33] not a part of you I'm just a part of God
[56:35] but I'm not a part of you guys that's
[56:38] not what he said that was the last
[56:40] message it's a revelation that I'm a
[56:43] part of God and I'm a part of you and I
[56:46] love you and I love
[56:50] God and we're T taking this together
[56:56] that means we're
[56:58] together as a symbol of our love to God
[57:03] and our love and oh here's this good
[57:05] word I wish we could pull up all these
[57:06] quotes
[57:08] quick and our
[57:12] fellowship
[57:14] separate no no sorry our fellowship to
[57:19] one
[57:21] another to one another you know if you
[57:25] don't like your brother and sisters
[57:26] Fellowship regardless of how unique and
[57:29] the variety they are you're going to
[57:31] hate
[57:32] God you're going you're going to flat
[57:33] out hate God like we we need to
[57:36] recognize this before we get there cuz
[57:38] you know it'd be terrible if you got to
[57:39] heaven and you were
[57:46] disappointed in Hebrews 10:24 and 25 you
[57:49] can pull this up
[57:52] Amy let us consider one another and to
[57:56] provoke unto love and good works
[58:01] consider consider your brother and
[58:04] sister consider the variety of the
[58:06] brother and
[58:08] sister and Hebrews 10:
[58:11] 2425 yes amen and watch this and 25 and
[58:15] not
[58:17] forsaking oh I know this one we have
[58:20] memorized of your not forsaking the
[58:24] assembly which is fellowship
[58:26] shipping of
[58:28] ourselves together now the Bible knows
[58:31] this is going to
[58:33] happen it's amazing how God had this
[58:35] Revelation as in the matter that some
[58:39] have already done it I would say
[58:46] most but exhorting one another and so
[58:50] much the more as you see the day
[58:52] approaching you know what it's not our
[58:55] job to conver convert you to my Doctrine
[58:58] it's not my job to convert you to my
[59:01] Revelation it's not my job to convert to
[59:04] save you brother Braham said I'm not the
[59:07] Savior I'm not your healer I'm pointing
[59:10] to you one it is and how you see the
[59:13] picture you know that you I know this is
[59:15] simple but like the dad That Sent His
[59:17] Four Sons to go see a tree and four
[59:20] different seasons and they all would
[59:22] have fought what the tree looked like
[59:24] because they went there in four
[59:25] different season seasons one season it
[59:27] was dead one season it was all white
[59:29] with blooms one season it was green and
[59:31] one season it was completely
[59:33] red with
[59:36] apples that's how immature we look to
[59:40] God blessed are those that are not
[59:43] offended in me because you are him and
[59:49] when you're offended with your brother
[59:50] and sister just because their tree's
[59:52] apple is red and yours is white with
[59:55] blooms and they were just pling it a few
[59:57] weeks
[1:00:00] later you're actually offended with God
[1:00:03] not your brother and sisters and that's
[1:00:06] why the young people are fleeing this
[1:00:09] place because of the
[1:00:15] drama drama is making me
[1:00:21] vomit and it's made our kids
[1:00:24] vomit the they've run for their life to
[1:00:31] survive and God will judge
[1:00:34] us for
[1:00:37] this God help
[1:00:39] us when we were yet sinners and
[1:00:43] unlovely and
[1:00:47] unlovable no man came to the father but
[1:00:51] he still put out his love to you
[1:00:57] amen how in the world you know I've seen
[1:01:01] I've seen message
[1:01:03] people have backyard parties at their
[1:01:07] house and they told me directly I'm not
[1:01:10] inviting anybody from the
[1:01:14] church you look shocked I didn't just
[1:01:17] hear that from one person I've heard
[1:01:19] that most of my message
[1:01:22] life I don't want to get in your
[1:01:25] backyard party and have a competition on
[1:01:28] quotes it's not about a competition on
[1:01:31] quotes it's not about a competition on
[1:01:33] your Revelation I just wanted you know
[1:01:36] people asking questions and answerers
[1:01:38] why do you go hunting why don't you just
[1:01:40] stay under the anointing and the the
[1:01:42] Revelation and the V he said I would
[1:01:44] blow
[1:01:45] up he said One Vision is hard harder on
[1:01:49] me than preaching for
[1:01:51] months blow
[1:01:54] up blow up
[1:01:57] and yet every time the message people
[1:01:59] get together oh did you read this I read
[1:02:01] this today and And yet when our Prophet
[1:02:05] went hunting I got this first hand from
[1:02:07] from uh his oldest son he got he came
[1:02:10] right under the anointing where where
[1:02:12] literally arms were grown up like
[1:02:14] unbelievable anointing in the service
[1:02:19] unbelievable and he got in the car and
[1:02:21] he was going to western Canada and the
[1:02:24] first thing he said in the car to the
[1:02:27] driver she got to any good jokes he came
[1:02:31] from The Presence of
[1:02:38] Jehovah now I know I've lost about 99%
[1:02:41] of you so far but I'm going to regain
[1:02:44] some of you right now do you know when
[1:02:48] the prophet went hunting how many people
[1:02:50] did he have friends in his church
[1:02:54] connections

[1:03:01] you can put your hands up that one tens
[1:03:02] of
[1:03:03] thousands word wi and he went hunting
[1:03:07] and he preached the message brother

[1:07:38] order Jesus preached Church
[1:07:41] order but before we get to that let's
[1:07:44] read a quote he said God don't destroy
[1:07:46] his children he said he's trying his
[1:07:48] best to get them
[1:07:51] in in but it's the devil that's turned
[1:07:56] them loose that will destroy the
[1:07:59] children so God permits Satan to do his
[1:08:03] work that's in questions and answers God
[1:08:07] don't destroy what he
[1:08:10] created God don't destroy that no this
[1:08:13] is a quote this is paragraph 184 in
[1:08:15] questions and answers God don't destroy
[1:08:17] his question he's just trying to do his
[1:08:19] best to get them
[1:08:22] in okay so watch this
[1:08:26] so let me go back to our first
[1:08:31] scripture we're going to go to Matthew
[1:08:44] Amy and I read Matthew 18 1-7 and at the
[1:08:48] same time the disciples came to Jesus
[1:08:50] saying who is the greatest in the
[1:08:52] Kingdom of Heaven verse two and Jesus
[1:08:54] called onto the little children Jesus
[1:08:56] did what we just did I don't think there
[1:08:59] was as many
[1:09:01] sleeping and set them in his
[1:09:05] midst oh bless God I've never seen a
[1:09:07] church do that before well praise the
[1:09:10] Lord we're getting
[1:09:12] converted s him in his midst and said
[1:09:15] verily verily I say unto you except ye
[1:09:18] be
[1:09:19] converted oh now we're getting somewhere
[1:09:23] we're getting converted praise the Lord
[1:09:26] and become as a little
[1:09:29] children ye shall not even enter into
[1:09:32] the kingdom of heaven and whosoever
[1:09:35] therefore shall humble
[1:09:37] himself to the variety of God
[1:09:44] as as a little children which is the
[1:09:46] variety of God did we say we have
[1:09:48] variety up here it's little children the
[1:09:51] same is the
[1:09:53] greatest now we've been missing that for
[1:09:55] a long time remember we said a great
[1:09:58] Revelation how God love
[1:10:00] Fellowship is the greatest kingdom of
[1:10:03] God and whosoever would receiveth such
[1:10:07] as a little child in my name receiveth
[1:10:12] God oh bless God we don't have time for
[1:10:14] the kids oh shut up stay home get out of
[1:10:17] my way you know you don't you don't have
[1:10:19] a quotebook yet you
[1:10:23] don't that's disgusting
[1:10:26] justing receiveth me and verse 6 and
[1:10:30] whosoever shall be
[1:10:32] offended because I asked one of the
[1:10:34] little kids to come up front and help me
[1:10:37] preach with these little ones which I
[1:10:41] believe in
[1:10:42] me it would be better for
[1:10:45] him that a millstone would be hung
[1:10:47] around his
[1:10:48] neck and that he would be drowned in the
[1:10:51] depths of the
[1:10:53] sea for w into a world because
[1:11:02] of well they're different me bless God
[1:11:05] you know I wasn't raised in yand and you
[1:11:09] know I don't understand them I don't
[1:11:19] understand woe unto a world because of
[1:11:21] offenses I'm going to say like this
[1:11:23] would it be okay if I say like this w on
[1:11:25] to the message
[1:11:28] churches because of
[1:11:32] offenses you know every most message
[1:11:35] churches have had dozens of young people
[1:11:38] walk out of this
[1:11:40] place and it was because people with big
[1:11:43] mouths meddling in places that they
[1:11:46] didn't need to meddle matter of fact was
[1:11:49] sinful for them to medle there
[1:11:55] thank you
[1:11:59] Hallelujah you know you know we're not
[1:12:02] the church don't have to be perfect you
[1:12:04] know what I mean like God ain't less of
[1:12:06] God because 10 Bond Believers come in
[1:12:09] this
[1:12:10] place the Bible's still the Bible the
[1:12:13] message is still the truth and
[1:12:16] and
[1:12:19] Hallelujah you know you know the prophet
[1:12:21] in the prophet's meetings he had a
[1:12:23] sister sit there I think it was 23 or 26
[1:12:26] years or 16 or it was years cutting her
[1:12:30] hair on a regular basis going to the
[1:12:31] putter salon now can you imagine anybody
[1:12:34] listen to The Prophet's message the
[1:12:35] mount that he preached against hair how
[1:12:37] in the world could it somebody like I
[1:12:40] mean all the others were offended and
[1:12:42] laughed and just all of a sudden after
[1:12:45] like 16 or 20 years sitting in the
[1:12:48] prophet's church it was just
[1:12:51] like oh I'm not almost got my hair wow
[1:12:55] I wish I would have heard that
[1:12:57] somebody's
[1:12:59] like you got to be kidding
[1:13:06] me do you know it takes sometimes long
[1:13:09] some of your kids it'll take longer for
[1:13:11] them to like squash some of my kids like
[1:13:14] it so I still pray for them amen or like
[1:13:19] some of our kids they hated peas and you
[1:13:22] know Sister Ruth I would put two peas on
[1:13:24] their plate and they would tidy around
[1:13:27] those pees and and build them up like
[1:13:29] soldiers and then they get all done and
[1:13:30] say Dad I'm all done
[1:13:33] but I'm looking I'm looking at these two

[1:15:44] important they didn't come from God you
[1:15:46] know they don't come from God until
[1:15:48] they're about 18 and then they're
[1:15:50] immediately from God you know
[1:15:57] th this was
[1:16:00] Jesus I I want to rephrase this this is
[1:16:04] this was Jesus church order and Doctrine
[1:16:08] for
[1:16:10] children
[1:16:20] Amen in Philippians 2:12 wherefore my
[1:16:25] beloved as ye have always obeyed not as
[1:16:28] in my presence only but now much more in
[1:16:33] my absence work out your own
[1:16:35] salvation with fear and trembling now
[1:16:38] that's verse 12 now if if you would
[1:16:42] allow me I'm just going to jump two
[1:16:43] verses but it's kind of like in the same
[1:16:47] context would we agree on that from 12
[1:16:50] to 14 there's just like one verse in
[1:16:52] between
[1:16:53] there do all
[1:16:56] things we need this one up
[1:16:59] there we do all things without trying to
[1:17:02] help
[1:17:03] god without fixing all the problems that
[1:17:06] we think God don't know about man we
[1:17:08] don't believe God's you like omnipotent
[1:17:11] because like we know more than God knows
[1:17:13] God have you seen the mail did you get
[1:17:15] that text
[1:17:19] god without mummering or disputing
[1:17:23] that's not our business
[1:17:25] absolutely totally not our
[1:17:30] business wow your own
[1:17:34] salvation and then let the person just
[1:17:37] take care of
[1:17:39] it you know not everybody that's in
[1:17:42] heaven is going to be in the
[1:17:46] bride there'll be people that are just
[1:17:48] nice to the bride that's going to be a
[1:17:50] really small group cuz I mean the bride
[1:17:53] can't even be nice to each other so I
[1:17:54] mean the people that are nice to the
[1:17:55] bride that's just like that's like
[1:17:57] really Supernatural we might even have
[1:17:59] to change bedrooms or
[1:18:01] something Matthew 7
[1:18:05] 1:5 Matthew 7 1:5 it's really important
[1:18:08] and now now I want to show you something
[1:18:10] I'm reading a lot of quotes and a lot of
[1:18:15] Bible are we okay with the Bible okay
[1:18:19] judge not that you be not judged for in
[1:18:23] what judgment you judge the little iety
[1:18:25] of the children or the old dad trees in
[1:18:27] the front yard and the chainsaw and
[1:18:28] remember all these things people that we
[1:18:30] throw in the home and people that don't
[1:18:32] have a good voice and people that are
[1:18:34] terrible preachers like myself and and
[1:18:36] all these things
[1:18:38] this that
[1:18:40] you for with judgment you judge ye shall
[1:18:44] be judged and with what Merit measure
[1:18:46] you Merit it shall be measured unto you
[1:18:49] again I wonder if you've ever done seen
[1:18:51] something just disgusting done to the
[1:18:53] kids you think if that person realized
[1:18:56] that what they just did to a little
[1:18:57] child of God is going to come right back
[1:19:00] and feed them right in their
[1:19:02] face you know you know from from the
[1:19:05] youngest memories as I could be I hated
[1:19:09] people being picked on I can remember in
[1:19:12] grade two when Brent mckinin moved into
[1:19:14] the school and everybody wanted to beat
[1:19:16] him up and I'd stand reide I I'd take a
[1:19:18] whole class on you're going to lick both
[1:19:20] of us at the same time I never seen the
[1:19:22] kid
[1:19:23] before to me was just
[1:19:27] disgusting oh I don't know him I don't
[1:19:30] know how long he served God I don't know
[1:19:33] his personal
[1:19:37] Doctrine you know you know this is fresh
[1:19:41] I mean this is this is really fresh you
[1:19:43] know one time we had a lady from from uh
[1:19:46] Sam Sam Johnson's Church in Michigan was
[1:19:48] that am I saying that right Sam John
[1:19:50] Church she wanted to give some money to
[1:19:51] a pastor in the Philippines and and and
[1:19:54] I had preached for him I had preached
[1:19:56] for him and she had asked another bait
[1:19:58] name Pastor in the Philippines which I
[1:20:00] had also preached for him too and and I
[1:20:02] know these people if you want me to show
[1:20:04] but it's not important and she was going
[1:20:06] to send the money to the one preacher
[1:20:07] and asked him will you send it over to
[1:20:08] this one and he said no he said CU I
[1:20:11] don't know if he's really a Believer now
[1:20:14] I don't know if he teaches the same
[1:20:18] doctrine that I promote in my little
[1:20:21] cabin
[1:20:24] hello hello help me out
[1:20:29] hello and she called me out and she said
[1:20:31] brother Dale do you know Pastor S I said
[1:20:34] yep she told me the story and she said
[1:20:36] will you send the money to I said it's
[1:20:37] not my money of course I
[1:20:41] will
[1:20:44] see what right do you have if somebody
[1:20:47] comes up and gives you money and say
[1:20:49] will you give this to brother Bernard
[1:20:50] and said no no I want to give it to
[1:20:51] Sister Ruth it's not your money I mean
[1:20:54] now they're one so it wouldn't matter
[1:20:56] probably brother Bernard hands it sister
[1:20:58] but you what I'm you know what I'm
[1:21:00] saying but like like why not just what's
[1:21:03] wrong with just doing what the you don't
[1:21:05] have to ask any question well why are
[1:21:06] you sending it to him bless
[1:21:09] God it wasn't your money maybe the
[1:21:12] person prayed through about it I don't
[1:21:14] care it it's not my skin it's not my
[1:21:16] skin it's not my
[1:21:20] salvation but we have an opinion oh I've
[1:21:23] had oh
[1:21:25] man alive I had to get converted
[1:21:28] too when I was young oh
[1:21:31] please
[1:21:36] uhhuh Matthew 7 we're still
[1:21:39] here verse three and why beholdest thou
[1:21:42] the mol in thy brother's eye but
[1:21:44] considerest not the beam that's in thine
[1:21:45] own eye or why wilt thou say to thy
[1:21:47] brother let let me pull the Mt out of
[1:21:50] thine eye and behold the beam that's in
[1:21:52] thine own eye thou hypocrite First cast
[1:21:55] out the beam out of thine own eye and
[1:21:56] then Thou shalt See Clearly to cast out
[1:21:58] the mold in thy brother's eye now you
[1:22:00] know unbeliev is unbeknownst to most of
[1:22:03] us that are here in the flesh we haven't
[1:22:04] actually went in the Rapture yet like
[1:22:07] you know I mean even around the world
[1:22:08] like we actually haven't got a new body
[1:22:10] yet like the body change like our
[1:22:12] theophany body I mean it's hanging
[1:22:14] around us but it can't connect yet
[1:22:16] because we aren't converted
[1:22:19] yet well well that's what the Bible
[1:22:22] said it said when we get converted
[1:22:25] strengthen the
[1:22:29] Brethren oh my in Genesis 1:26 28 I just
[1:22:33] want to paraphrase this quickly one
[1:22:36] Genesis 1:26 and God said let us make
[1:22:38] man and our emages after our
[1:22:41] likess that means God has fat people and
[1:22:44] he has little people and he has squirmy
[1:22:46] people and he has male and female and so
[1:22:49] God created man man in His image and in
[1:22:52] the image of God now this will surprise
[1:22:54] some of you created he male and female
[1:23:00] now that's amazing why did God do that
[1:23:02] now there's no human alive can
[1:23:04] understand the female
[1:23:06] species but God actually created
[1:23:09] them but I don't understand that why
[1:23:12] would God make that big
[1:23:15] mistake well no but do you see what I'm
[1:23:17] that's I'm trying to get you to right
[1:23:20] but we preach we listen my own wife has
[1:23:22] said I felt like a dorat in message
[1:23:24] churches before now God don't have any
[1:23:27] doormats he don't have any people that's
[1:23:30] amputated and I can tell you what when
[1:23:32] my wife comes to me in private and says
[1:23:34] I was treated like a doormat when that
[1:23:36] person was preaching over the pulpit
[1:23:37] he's not
[1:23:39] [Applause]
[1:23:41] converted I don't care how many years
[1:23:43] he's preached this
[1:23:48] message amen now this is still Bible now
[1:23:50] let's go he created them male and female
[1:23:53] created he them he created them them now
[1:23:58] now this will really shock you in verse
[1:24:00] 28 now I only took part of these verses
[1:24:02] when I print them down and God actually
[1:24:06] blessed
[1:24:09] them
[1:24:11] wow I thought God just blessed the
[1:24:17] men he actually blessed them
[1:24:20] both well
[1:24:22] that wow and God said unto
[1:24:26] them and we just stopped there
[1:24:36] amen
[1:24:38] amen God help us in John 1:3 and all
[1:24:42] things were made by him and without him
[1:24:46] wasn't anything made God didn't make any
[1:24:49] mistakes but we live our life like he
[1:24:53] did
[1:24:55] we
[1:24:57] do and we feel like the way we live our
[1:25:00] Christian Life Is God we know you
[1:25:03] overlooked and had an oversight on this
[1:25:05] part so now we're going to help you with
[1:25:07] our baked
[1:25:13] mouth and if you as a
[1:25:16] human have that much
[1:25:19] love think of what your heavenly father
[1:25:24] would do for his
[1:25:26] children you know the Bible says that if
[1:25:29] you be in evil and how to give good
[1:25:30] gifts to your children and you were born
[1:25:32] in sin shaped and iniquity come to the
[1:25:34] world speaking
[1:25:35] lies how much more does
[1:25:37] God who made all things and by him was
[1:25:40] nothing else made his
[1:25:43] children amen questions and answers oh
[1:25:47] I've already read that story Matthew
[1:25:51] 19 we got it we'll speed up a little bit
[1:25:53] forgive me Matthew
[1:25:56] 1913-15 and he actually tell me what I
[1:25:59] want to go to Mark 4 Mark 10 sorry let's
[1:26:02] go to Mark 10 I like this one better I
[1:26:05] get to pick but we'll go back to Matthew
[1:26:08] but I like this one better now you would
[1:26:10] think that maybe we backslid or we never
[1:26:12] did something Mark Mark 10:13 and 16 now
[1:26:15] we need this up here so we can see it
[1:26:17] and the people brought the young
[1:26:18] children to
[1:26:20] Jesus at that he should t
[1:26:27] them their hands he touched the children
[1:26:31] now that's weird he actually touched the
[1:26:38] children and his
[1:26:41] deacons Glory Hallelujah they were
[1:26:44] message
[1:26:46] thought and his deacons rebuke
[1:26:51] God or the people that brought him and
[1:26:54] his disciples rebuke those that brought
[1:26:56] the
[1:26:57] children now let's just see how God
[1:27:01] wrote his church order and
[1:27:06] Doctrine would that be
[1:27:12] okay
[1:27:13] 14 but when Jesus saw it he was
[1:27:22] much this
[1:27:24] please and he said unto
[1:27:27] his
[1:27:30] deacons suffer the little children to
[1:27:32] come unto me and forbid
[1:27:36] them
[1:27:40] not for
[1:27:42] such now you know when the children were
[1:27:45] coming to Jesus now listen let's just
[1:27:47] make a little drama here they weren't
[1:27:52] Angels it didn't say they were
[1:27:55] like cryless
[1:27:57] noisess sit they could sit for three
[1:27:59] hours they were children they
[1:28:04] [Laughter]
[1:28:08] were and the disciples said they're
[1:28:11] being a big
[1:28:13] disturbance let's get these kids out of
[1:28:15] this way for the Holy Spirit to
[1:28:18] move messing up my concentration
[1:28:24] and Jesus said to
[1:28:26] them when he was much
[1:28:30] displeased suffer little children come
[1:28:32] unto me and forbid them not for such is
[1:28:35] the kingdom of God and verily I say unto
[1:28:37] you that whosoever will not
[1:28:40] receive the kingdom of God as a little
[1:28:43] child into his
[1:28:45] church with all the
[1:28:48] distractions that a little child cannot
[1:28:50] do to me when I'm
[1:28:52] preaching he shall not enter into
[1:28:58] heaven and he took the children up
[1:29:01] during church now we're in the church
[1:29:03] service praise
[1:29:06] God wow I've never seen that done
[1:29:11] before and he took them up in his arms
[1:29:14] and he put his arms upon
[1:29:18] them and he said don't come to church no
[1:29:20] more
[1:29:26] and he blessed
[1:29:27] them that's Jesus church order and
[1:29:29] Doctrine let's go to Matthew 19:13 I'm
[1:29:31] going to speed up and Matthew 19:13 and
[1:29:34] when they were brought into him the
[1:29:36] little children that they should put
[1:29:38] their hands that he should put their
[1:29:39] hands on them and pray the disciples
[1:29:41] rebuke them now those were good deacons
[1:29:45] for any message church around the
[1:29:49] world they would get an amonous votes
[1:29:54] but Jesus said suffer the little
[1:29:56] children and forbid them not to come
[1:29:58] unto me for such is the kingdom of
[1:29:59] heaven and he laid his hands on them and
[1:30:02] departed hence you know I I tell you
[1:30:05] something brother Dale was young and
[1:30:07] stupid at one time and I'm still old and
[1:30:10] stupid but you know when I traveled you
[1:30:14] know God's a god of variety I'll never
[1:30:16] forget the first time I went
[1:30:19] overseas and if I would have had a
[1:30:21] message Doctrine of
[1:30:26] most make
[1:30:27] Believers I would have never went back
[1:30:29] overseas again cuz there ain't one thing
[1:30:32] that Africa does that's the same as us
[1:30:35] I've seen them when they I don't know
[1:30:37] what this song was it was another
[1:30:39] language brother Bernard I just seen the
[1:30:41] pews just empty out to the middle and it
[1:30:43] was wall to wall and they come up here
[1:30:46] and like they were just
[1:30:49] like and the walls started moving
[1:30:54] you know the first thing came to my mind
[1:30:56] we don't do that in
[1:30:58] Wyoming I never seen that done in Canada
[1:31:01] before well they don't have the same God
[1:31:04] as me because we don't do it that way we
[1:31:05] don't serve God that I'm offended I'm
[1:31:09] well they're being disorderly how can
[1:31:10] the song leader pay attention when
[1:31:12] there's people
[1:31:15] oh it's like the person that came to
[1:31:17] brother Brown said if they if she wasn't
[1:31:19] shouting amen hallelujah I couldn't even
[1:31:21] preach and the other person was
[1:31:23] completely
[1:31:25] distracted now that
[1:31:27] same action created two different
[1:31:31] reactions one person couldn't focus
[1:31:33] because there was kids in the church and
[1:31:35] the other person said he couldn't even
[1:31:36] preach unless the kids were
[1:31:39] there and that person was
[1:31:42] Jesus I think I like his
[1:31:46] example you know the one time we were in
[1:31:49] a service and The Neighbor Next Door
[1:31:51] there was just a bamboo and was no walls
[1:31:54] at all no walls at all at all and you
[1:31:57] can hear every car go
[1:32:03] by and then the neighbor had a hurt of
[1:32:05] cows and he'd run them by and the goats
[1:32:07] and that they would get out and they'd
[1:32:09] come over they oh and like the preacher
[1:32:11] up here and I'm
[1:32:18] like and the preacher go brother D I'm
[1:32:21] over
[1:32:21] here cuz I'm distracted
[1:32:30] I wonder who needed to
[1:32:32] get
[1:32:35] converted the cows or
[1:32:40] me I remember the one time we were in a
[1:32:42] different place and there was lizards in
[1:32:44] the church and the cat came to church it
[1:32:47] fell asleep and there was a lizard going
[1:32:49] up the pole and my daughter was really
[1:32:51] concerned about the lizard and she was
[1:32:54] moving around and the young people were
[1:32:56] jumping because she was distracted by
[1:32:58] the L cuz see they weren't
[1:33:00] distracted see they were in the mode
[1:33:03] they were like a like the minite hsees
[1:33:05] going down the road on 401 and they had
[1:33:07] blinders they didn't see no kids they
[1:33:10] didn't see no cows they didn't see no
[1:33:12] lizards they didn't see nothing but
[1:33:14] Christ
[1:33:24] mhm yeah now would it be okay if I
[1:33:28] continue continue and show you God's
[1:33:30] Church order and Doctrine this may
[1:33:32] surprise you so just Matthew 21 12-6 now
[1:33:38] I I don't think I can go very far wrong
[1:33:40] if we're reading the
[1:33:41] scriptures Matthew 21 and Jesus went
[1:33:44] into the temple of God and cast them out
[1:33:47] that were
[1:33:50] children oh I I knew I was in Reading
[1:33:55] they that sold and bought in the temple
[1:33:58] and he overthrew their tabers and the
[1:34:00] money Chambers and the seats and them
[1:34:02] that sold doves and he said unto them it
[1:34:04] is written my house should be called The
[1:34:06] House of Prayer but ye have made it a
[1:34:08] den of Thieves and the Blind and the
[1:34:11] lame came unto him in the temple now
[1:34:14] these are the people that are really a
[1:34:15] distraction like we don't want no blind
[1:34:17] people walking in here cuz they might
[1:34:18] walk into somebody like you just don't
[1:34:22] know that would would really distract me
[1:34:25] if I seen somebody walking like
[1:34:29] procurious and the BL and the lame
[1:34:31] people see if if there was and I'm not
[1:34:33] making fun if there was somebody walking
[1:34:35] like this you know when you go to high
[1:34:37] school and somebody like has no arm or
[1:34:39] something hand and like everybody in the
[1:34:41] whole school
[1:34:48] goes it's cuz they're not converted
[1:34:51] yet but Jesus was converted
[1:34:54] and so the Blind and the lame they came
[1:34:56] onto him after he got rid of the edos in
[1:35:01] church mostly the
[1:35:05] men the ones that were concerned about
[1:35:08] how much they were paying for the mixer
[1:35:10] or something I don't
[1:35:12] know and he healed them and when the
[1:35:15] chief priest and the scribes saw the
[1:35:17] wonderful things that he did now watch
[1:35:19] this now this is you got this up
[1:35:22] here next
[1:35:24] verse the wonderful things he
[1:35:27] did and the children were
[1:35:32] crying in the
[1:35:34] temple now any good Deacon would come up
[1:35:37] and tap the mother on the shoulder and
[1:35:38] say get that kid out of here cuz all the
[1:35:41] people are
[1:35:43] distracted you know we can't even
[1:35:45] concentrate because a baby would cry
[1:35:54] and the children were crying is that
[1:35:56] what it
[1:35:57] says okay Ju Just I wasn't sure in the
[1:36:00] temple saying hosana to the son of
[1:36:04] David and they were sore displeased
[1:36:07] that's the message
[1:36:11] Believers cuz see it didn't go Jesus
[1:36:15] wasn't the god that they were
[1:36:17] worshiping he wasn't the god of variety
[1:36:20] they didn't want that variety so they
[1:36:22] just said we want won't accept that they
[1:36:25] were sort dis pleased and they said unto
[1:36:27] him hear us thou these that are
[1:36:29] crying and Jesus said unto them yay have
[1:36:33] ye never read that out of the
[1:36:36] mouth of
[1:36:39] babes and
[1:36:41] sucklings has
[1:36:44] he
[1:36:47] perfected
[1:36:51] praise I wish I was invited to ministers
[1:36:54] meeting I would roast their
[1:37:06] height how is God going to perfect out
[1:37:10] of the mouth of babes and
[1:37:13] sucklings perfect praise if they're not
[1:37:15] allowed in the
[1:37:18] church to cry
[1:37:31] amen H Joshua
[1:37:35] 24:15 and it seem evil unto
[1:37:39] you to serve the Lord choose you this
[1:37:42] day whom you will serve whether the gods
[1:37:44] of your father the past gods of the way
[1:37:47] we've always done it this way we've
[1:37:49] always kept the message Church really
[1:37:51] dignified and perfect
[1:37:55] are on the other side of the flood the
[1:37:57] gods of the
[1:37:58] amorites in whose land ye now dwell but
[1:38:02] as for this is a prophet saying but as
[1:38:05] for me and my
[1:38:06] house we're going to take what God
[1:38:09] says we're going to take his
[1:38:13] Doctrine here and and I'm I'm I'm trying
[1:38:16] to wind down
[1:38:18] here he's brother Brown's talking about
[1:38:20] a minister and us as
[1:38:24] people this is where we've missed it in
[1:38:27] the church he said you are just to throw
[1:38:30] out the
[1:38:31] net with the Brethren and now you know
[1:38:34] each one of us now he included you are
[1:38:37] fishermen and you know God and now the
[1:38:41] Lord told a fisherman one time he said
[1:38:43] as he followed him he said come and be
[1:38:46] Fishers of Men and we stand at the
[1:38:47] corner here by the church in the
[1:38:49] neighborhood and we gather and we throw
[1:38:52] out the net
[1:38:54] and it's not up to us what the net
[1:38:58] catches but we don't do
[1:39:03] that we gather all that we can bring in
[1:39:08] and the Sinners no matter watch this and
[1:39:10] he said we're bringing in every sinner
[1:39:12] no matter what position he's in and
[1:39:14] we're trying to bring him to Christ and
[1:39:17] there comes a time when we reach out
[1:39:19] away and we put out all our Nets
[1:39:22] together all the message people together
[1:39:24] so we can go way out and get a big rack
[1:39:27] of of whatever would be caught in the
[1:39:29] net and that's what we are here tonight
[1:39:31] is just to knit our fellowship oh there
[1:39:34] you go again I don't like that word I
[1:39:37] don't want nobody to come to my house
[1:39:39] not if we got to argue over
[1:39:43] quotes we knit all our Nets together in
[1:39:46] Fellowship of love not around quotes
[1:39:50] around my brethren and their Nets and
[1:39:52] see many Souls we can get to Christ and
[1:39:55] we know that and he used the word that I
[1:39:57] had to go to Google for it s e i n iing
[1:40:02] and even my wife that's brilliant didn't
[1:40:04] know what it was and it's a special kind
[1:40:07] of net that floats on top of the ground
[1:40:09] and it goes down like 20 feet in the net
[1:40:11] and it's like a round and fishes can
[1:40:13] come in a door of the net or come up
[1:40:15] from the bottom come in it and when they
[1:40:16] get inside it's like an upside down
[1:40:20] cone and it's this word however you say
[1:40:23] it
[1:40:25] and he said it's a large netting around
[1:40:28] the entire area of fish and he said so
[1:40:30] you know we're setting our Nets around
[1:40:32] all the community people trying to catch
[1:40:35] get everything coming in but there's
[1:40:38] something that's going to be but there's
[1:40:41] only going to be some of them that are
[1:40:43] going to be fish that we catch in the
[1:40:45] net but that's not our
[1:40:48] business amen another quote here and
[1:40:51] looking to Jesus he said I wouldn't
[1:40:53] argue with no one here's the man that
[1:40:56] wanted to to toh debate with Brother
[1:40:58] brandom on Divine Healing he said I
[1:41:00] wouldn't argue with nobody he Saidi
[1:41:01] don't believe in it he said I wouldn't
[1:41:03] Mar now oh man remember we said about
[1:41:07] the Bible said converted our Prophet
[1:41:09] says Mar okay watch this this is for all
[1:41:13] message people around the world all
[1:41:15] they're watching online listen to this
[1:41:16] he said I wouldn't Mar my
[1:41:20] experience and my feeling for the Lord
[1:41:22] Jesus Christ and that love to argue with
[1:41:25] one
[1:41:27] another now the Bible says you need to
[1:41:29] get converted and the prophet said I
[1:41:31] wouldn't Mar
[1:41:33] it I could care less if they agree it
[1:41:36] makes no difference to
[1:41:38] me and I'll preach the gospel and if
[1:41:41] you'll believe it all right and if you
[1:41:43] don't that's up between you and God now
[1:41:45] how can we believe what the prophet said
[1:41:47] it's between them and God but we don't
[1:41:50] believe that that's why we divide and we
[1:41:53] don't expect accept varieties and that's
[1:41:56] why we got to do it exactly like all the
[1:41:58] other people do it and if we break the
[1:42:00] mold it's going to be like terrible says
[1:42:04] who you know I love sister Ruth was
[1:42:06] doing the Caya throughout our place and
[1:42:09] and we talked and oh it was amazing what
[1:42:12] she said I was just she had to be
[1:42:15] converted she said we're not here to
[1:42:17] please everybody there will be people
[1:42:19] that won't like church in the
[1:42:21] country there will be people that don't
[1:42:24] like T
[1:42:25] and and praise the Lord for them but
[1:42:28] don't come to our house cuz this one
[1:42:31] Sunday once in a year on three weeks
[1:42:35] from this Sunday we're going to break
[1:42:38] the
[1:42:40] mold we're going to be a little bit more
[1:42:42] like Jesus when he preached on the hill
[1:42:44] on the grass
[1:42:45] site around the campfire oh wow you've
[1:42:50] really backslid now
[1:42:53] really I never knew Jesus Built Church
[1:42:56] buildings in
[1:42:59] pews
[1:43:02] see and even when we have the food
[1:43:04] sister Ruth and Lan were talking about
[1:43:06] the food and we said what we're going to
[1:43:08] have and it's going to be five or six
[1:43:10] different options and we said well of
[1:43:12] course I'm always the person out I
[1:43:15] believe it was me I said well what if
[1:43:16] somebody don't like that and sister Ruth
[1:43:18] very converted spoke up she said we
[1:43:21] can't please everybody with the food
[1:43:24] food amazingly enough if you have five
[1:43:28] options for you go to a
[1:43:33] restaurant we won't be we'll eat what's
[1:43:36] left over after
[1:43:42] camp but we want everybody just in that
[1:43:45] little
[1:43:55] amen here the prophet saying I'm not
[1:43:57] responsible for nothing but preaching
[1:43:59] the word and it's him that pulls them
[1:44:02] in just I'm finishing here just two
[1:44:05] quotes God help us amen and all these
[1:44:08] people I love them with all my heart and
[1:44:09] I don't know which one of them which is
[1:44:12] I can't tell you but I just hear to
[1:44:14] preach the word and I cast the net and
[1:44:16] Pull It in and if there's frogs in the
[1:44:19] net there's water spiders and there's
[1:44:22] snakes there's some fish too and that's
[1:44:26] up to God to decide
[1:44:29] that why can't we just accept
[1:44:35] that I just pull the net in I just
[1:44:38] preach the word and Pull It in and say
[1:44:41] well here they come Lord All Around The
[1:44:43] Altar and you know who's yours and
[1:44:46] you've known them since a foundation of
[1:44:47] the world and I don't know which one's
[1:44:49] who but you do so it's up to you Lord
[1:44:53] and that's the best I can do and I'll go
[1:44:55] somewhere else and throw the net out to
[1:44:57] another group and that's all I can
[1:45:03] do but we've got a
[1:45:07] spirit of the devil that if they ain't
[1:45:10] like us and they don't do everything
[1:45:11] exactly like us and if I'm disturbed or
[1:45:14] distracted or something they can't be
[1:45:17] God God help us God's a variety
[1:45:23] and now this is my last quote and now
[1:45:25] that uh what caused a disgrace in the
[1:45:29] church upon the church is because the
[1:45:31] people get around their oh oh this is so
[1:45:36] good
[1:45:38] fleshly
[1:45:40] ideas my God is white fat and a man
[1:45:55] and get to running away with things and
[1:45:58] that causes those different groups and
[1:46:01] things and well I belong to this one and
[1:46:04] they don't belong they don't get along
[1:46:07] with that group so I won't either that's
[1:46:11] our
[1:46:13] profit that's in works that I do and
[1:46:15] bear witness of
[1:46:18] me and I don't have the paragraph right
[1:46:20] in front of me but I can sure get it for
[1:46:22] you
[1:46:23] that's our message right in a nutshell
[1:46:26] do you know I had a a minister in a far
[1:46:29] away country you don't know and by the
[1:46:31] way we pray that you'll pray for us
[1:46:33] we're we're looking for plane tickets to
[1:46:35] go to El
[1:46:37] Salvador the last couple days of
[1:46:40] November and the 1 of December and we'd
[1:46:43] like to take everyone here with us and
[1:46:47] in a close area it don't take money it
[1:46:51] just takes your your willingness to have
[1:46:54] a god of variety that's all it takes do
[1:46:58] you know we went to four churches when
[1:46:59] we were there and honey would you say
[1:47:01] that all four were vastly
[1:47:04] different and vastly
[1:47:08] beautiful some had completely different
[1:47:11] music than others do you know they were
[1:47:13] actually preaching the same word of God
[1:47:15] that we're preaching surprisingly enough
[1:47:18] do you know actually we walk through
[1:47:20] little towns that were probably as small
[1:47:21] as brigon and there was Believers from
[1:47:24] three different churches lived in the
[1:47:25] same town and we stopped in every one of
[1:47:28] their houses and we didn't actually
[1:47:31] fight and I didn't actually have to get
[1:47:34] my phone and pull up quotes and bicker
[1:47:37] and argue Chase all the young people out
[1:47:41] no it never happened you know people
[1:47:43] from other churches actually made a
[1:47:45] smoothies other people actually fed us
[1:47:47] meals from a I know that like that's
[1:47:49] actually amazing
[1:48:00] but we have this stupid idea that came
[1:48:03] from Satan that if we don't fit in our
[1:48:07] mold we have respects the persons based
[1:48:10] on their size and their ability the
[1:48:15] quality do you know most of Jesus
[1:48:17] disciples were
[1:48:18] non-educated other than Paul most of
[1:48:21] them couldn't write their own name the
[1:48:24] very person that Jesus gave the keys to
[1:48:26] he couldn't write his name I I think you
[1:48:29] call that pretty much
[1:48:31] illiterate do you know that your Prophet
[1:48:33] I want to say that again that your
[1:48:36] Prophet oh bless God that your Prophet
[1:48:39] when he started preaching was such a
[1:48:41] poor reader that he had his wife come
[1:48:44] behind the desk the holy D can you
[1:48:47] believe it a woman do you know I had to
[1:48:51] block and onri people cuz we had sisters
[1:48:54] come behind the holy desk and sing
[1:48:56] specials and I had no problem slapping
[1:48:59] them off my
[1:49:02] connectionless when a woman started
[1:49:04] telling me how I was going to run the
[1:49:05] church on the other side of the
[1:49:07] world that is the most disgusting vial
[1:49:10] from hell you ever to see you know a
[1:49:13] woman a sister can do
[1:49:17] everything that handle the word her
[1:49:19] brother and she could even handle the
[1:49:21] word over her family
[1:49:23] family and the Bible says for the old
[1:49:25] sisters to teach the younger sisters and
[1:49:27] you're failing in that area sisters cuz
[1:49:29] I got three daughters and they need a
[1:49:30] lot of I'm just I that's a joke but amen
[1:49:36] you I'm seriously you sisters that have
[1:49:39] wisdom tell my girls for crying out loud
[1:49:43] they won't listen to me I'm a
[1:49:45] man I'm that's is that Bible that the
[1:49:49] older sisters would tell the younger
[1:49:50] sisters you know I was young once and
[1:49:53] you know I I I I be
[1:49:58] careful uh-huh you have all the
[1:50:01] permission you need from the word of God
[1:50:04] to fulfill your role you see what I
[1:50:06] mean brother brandham had his wife come
[1:50:09] behind the pulpit and read the Bible
[1:50:12] because he could not
[1:50:15] read now let me ask you let's do a
[1:50:17] survey here have you went to one single
[1:50:20] Church in your life where you seen that
[1:50:23] happen put your hand up if you
[1:50:27] have that's un
[1:50:29] amous and let me let's just just
[1:50:32] continue on this I I believe we're on
[1:50:34] something good so and if you had seen it
[1:50:36] happen do you think it would have
[1:50:37] emptied out the whole church put your
[1:50:38] hand
[1:50:44] up a woman came to the
[1:50:48] front oh
[1:50:58] your Prophet did that let me okay let me
[1:51:02] let me ask my last question was he
[1:51:07] wrong see how you don't like change and
[1:51:13] variety that hurts
[1:51:15] you it hurts you you don't like
[1:51:21] it and now the cause of disgrace upon
[1:51:24] the church is cuz people just get their
[1:51:27] fleshly ideas you know when brother Dale
[1:51:31] went to the
[1:51:33] Philippines Africa and El Salvador and
[1:51:37] even before we went to monzerat I knew
[1:51:41] exactly how God was supposed to
[1:51:43] be God had told me how he should be
[1:51:46] right in Ontario Canada brother Bernard
[1:51:48] it was exactly how we are right now h
[1:51:58] H are you
[1:52:01] kidding careful Church you're so
[1:52:04] familiar with the god you think is God
[1:52:08] that you don't realize that there's
[1:52:09] actually Believers that do things
[1:52:11] different than you do and they're going
[1:52:13] to be in heaven
[1:52:15] too and they actually preach the same
[1:52:18] message we believe and they actually
[1:52:21] surprisingly enough have the baptis of
[1:52:23] the Holy
[1:52:26] Ghost fleshly ideas and you get you get
[1:52:30] to run away with these things that's the
[1:52:32] fleshly ideas and you cause these
[1:52:35] different groups and things and while I
[1:52:38] belong to this one and they don't get
[1:52:40] along with this group so neither will
[1:52:46] I neither
[1:52:48] why well let me just tell you
[1:52:51] something you don't have to ask me to go
[1:52:57] anywhere that might shock you I hope it
[1:53:00] don't but you are your own self you have
[1:53:04] the same holy ghost that I
[1:53:06] have Hello you were elected and
[1:53:09] predestinated I was I in a hierarch some
[1:53:14] dictatorship like Hitler and the church
[1:53:18] or the pope let me close with this I had
[1:53:21] a minister this week in another country
[1:53:23] tell me that since we have
[1:53:30] been many many moons ago that not one
[1:53:34] single local church would come by his
[1:53:37] church cuz he's
[1:53:43] different that's exactly how most of us
[1:53:47] live when's the last time you came to a
[1:53:49] house that you don't feel comfortable
[1:53:50] with
[1:53:52] if you get out of your comfort zone you
[1:53:54] feel
[1:53:56] awkward well I'm not comfortable around
[1:53:59] those people maybe you need to
[1:54:01] get
[1:54:04] converted
[1:54:12] maybe
[1:54:13] amen I love going to
[1:54:17] places where nobody else will
[1:54:19] go I I think God literally give me that
[1:54:23] Ministry that where all the I don't want
[1:54:25] to be where all the politics are I it
[1:54:28] makes me
[1:54:30] vomit it gives me
[1:54:33] a I want to tell you something it makes
[1:54:36] God vomit
[1:54:37] too and I believe we're going to close
[1:54:40] with it we matter of fact we can stand
[1:54:41] the musicians can come the God we serve
[1:54:45] is a lot different than the god that
[1:54:48] sometimes in our mind in our mind and
[1:54:51] we've portrayed by
[1:54:52] accident
[1:54:54] sometimes because he's a god of
[1:54:57] variety and I I would challenge you to
[1:55:00] look up that a god of variety brother
[1:55:03] Brown quoted it 35 times and he used
[1:55:05] multiple things like garden flowers
[1:55:08] nationalities colors people cultures
[1:55:12] towns Trees Animals everything culture a
[1:55:15] god of variety God love variety and God
[1:55:20] love fellowship and because something
[1:55:22] was
[1:55:23] different I let you know this because
[1:55:27] something died God don't have any
[1:55:30] chainsaws as soon as it dies he don't
[1:55:32] cut the tree down because we want a
[1:55:34] perfect front yard I want a front yard
[1:55:36] with a dead tree in it just so if a
[1:55:38] squirrel wants to live in a hollow apart
[1:55:40] or a bird wants to fly and that I just
[1:55:43] just just it's all right it's got that
[1:55:45] natural you know the bar all falls off
[1:55:47] it and the wood becomes really smooth
[1:55:49] and shiny and it makes me feel comfor
[1:55:57] able
[1:56:01] uh-huh amen see God's family are not a
[1:56:06] distraction to the Father the heavenly
[1:56:10] father and if you came from the Heavenly
[1:56:13] Father which I believe you did then your
[1:56:15] brothers and sisters will not be a
[1:56:17] distraction to you whether they're old
[1:56:22] or
[1:56:23] young now I showed you enough scriptures
[1:56:26] and I showed you the only person that
[1:56:28] God that Jesus God through out of the
[1:56:31] church was the people that were doing
[1:56:33] business in the
[1:56:34] church and I would wager to Guess that
[1:56:37] they were
[1:56:43] men and there's dozens of scriptures
[1:56:48] like that
[1:56:49] one where the whole Focus
[1:56:52] was on the young
[1:56:54] ones that cried in the
[1:56:57] church praise God we have a church with
[1:56:59] No Cry room just crying here that's the
[1:57:02] most noise I can get other people of the
[1:57:04] baby cries the only thing that'll cheer
[1:57:07] me on is somebody
[1:57:10] crying I wonder if that's what God
[1:57:13] likes he said out of the mouth of
[1:57:16] babes has God
[1:57:20] perfected praise
[1:57:24] amen God a variety amen God help us not
[1:57:27] now and and and I close with this I
[1:57:29] don't mean that to be
[1:57:32] unrespectful and
[1:57:34] disorderly that's different if you have
[1:57:37] a kid that's 10 years old or 12 years
[1:57:39] old and he's acting like a bride he
[1:57:42] needs the rod of Correction and I would
[1:57:44] be happy to administer it but I would
[1:57:46] tell you you're way too
[1:57:48] late way too late youve done made your
[1:57:52] bad you're going to have to lie on it
[1:57:53] cuz you done can't teach Old Dogs new
[1:57:56] tricks you could beat that kid to death
[1:57:59] and you lost 10 years of
[1:58:02] training you train a child when he's
[1:58:05] little that when he's old he don't when
[1:58:07] he gets 10 he don't depart from
[1:58:09] it that means when he's little you just
[1:58:14] go amen God help us God help us not to
[1:58:19] you you know God God wants you to hear
[1:58:21] this this morning cuz because God's been

[1:58:27] this age was God on the
[1:58:30] outside see I wish I could get in
[1:58:33] there and we and and and this is thus
[1:58:36] sayith the Lord and we have the spirit
[1:58:39] of we're looking for Perfection and we
[1:58:41] don't want no old people we don't want
[1:58:43] no young people we don't want no crying
[1:58:46] we don't want anybody to
[1:58:48] move we don't nobody that's got to go
