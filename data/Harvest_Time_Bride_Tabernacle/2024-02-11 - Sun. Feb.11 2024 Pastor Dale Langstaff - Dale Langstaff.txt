love you dearly we we we don't deserve you driving here I I sure don't that's that's amazing just uh sister Ruth your song was beautiful man you know you can think of all the things God give you but when he gave you his love I was better than a roof over my head I was better than a whole bunch of betters can you imagine that there's people in the world they can't say that amen amen thank you amen and you know just along that same line you know I just I just love when you know when I hear tambourines or specials or I mean and any one of you that can play or bang anything it's not required on it's required on the spirit of worship man you got a piano or a guitar or a tambourine or a or a rod or anything that makes nice noise spoons brother BK anything oh man just worship God he's he's wow if that requires you bringing up your little child beside you to help you play that guitar you just go right ahead and do it it won't offend brother Dale and it definitely won't offend God I'll guarantee you that hallelujah amen we just uh have a few announcements and uh and uh and testimonies and worship before we get into the word and man uh next Sunday brother Nathan Ericson will be with us um and so we're looking forward to that in a special way um and so uh um I believe leave if it works out I'm going to message him this week but if it works out that he comes early enough on Saturday we're going to take him somewhere for supper and everybody's invited wherever that is it we just have to check his time but everybody is um welcome also Friday Friday uh this is um this is uh Friday me and Len are going to be in Kitchener and for different reasons and and uh and we're going to spend Friday evening at the Mandarin and Kitchener and if anybody's flying by and want to make a detour uh we'd be happy to have every one of you there but there's people in the congregation that that's their backyard amen we have to we're going to have breakfast with Pastor Jose and take some meat there for different Believers in his church and himself and we're going to spend the day at the antique store and get good and hungry for the Mandarin and fellowship amen we also want to praise God for our our new addition to the piano and a wonderful brother here helped us out and I'd love to share just it just it just all these things just show family and love and care and unity together and it's just it's you know it's just amazing amen but I I uh we we had an amazing Wednesday night I was almost uh losing my mind uh just happy and and just felt thrilled amen but uh so we had the man come and T tune in on Wednesday and I also want to thank you know and anybody that wasn't here on Wednesday the ones that helped carry that and uh anybody that needs a choir practor bill just send it to the church uh we'll take care of it other the ties uh I wouldn't be surprised you need half a dozen because wow uh it was I I mean it was extreme extremely heavy and if you don't think so just come to the corner and just try to pick it up just just just a corner of it you you will understand perfectly when they come up those stairs and the three boys and Esther was on this side that piano tipped whoa I almost seen Stars I thought it was really really heavy but we had the tuner come an older gentleman and uh that we we know he's from betro and and I want to just show you how God's working am man he he just walked then the piano was closed up or well I think it was closed up or something he just literally walked up went around the piano and he said this piano's worth about 3 to 4,000 by the by the look of it you know the the quality of it the look of it and the first thing he did is he pulled out the song book part that that board pulls out it's on brass on either side he just pulled that out and he looked in right where he would work and that's where the pins the head bins the head pins of the piano are and the strings he said you have brand new pins and brand new strings he said that would cost you $4,000 an additional dollars but the the best part it continues to get better and better so he tuned it and I was in my office and he come to leave and and uh actually he he liked our tuning instruments that came with the piano so well he wanted to take them with him and I said you might take a trip someday and we might have to get a different tuner and thank you very much but we'll keep the tuning instruments here amen and so it was all positive and and so he was saying he said you know I'll come back and fine tune it but he said the piano is so tight and so stiff and so good that I can't find tune it until you play it and worship that sounded that was going that was going the right way I said well you don't have to worry brother I said my grandson will be beaten on that piano tonight and he said well does your wife play and I said oh yeah multiple people in the church and he said well that's what I've heard around town he said I I've heard that you have really loud worship around town and he lives in betro and I've never seen his face and he was probably a 65 year old man he man I I I went up there I said oh praise God the town knows we at least know how to make a Joyful Noise amen amen so we just praise God for that and all that was a part of it and you know I was saying Wednesday night said God will be so good to you he will give you things that you're not even looking for I would have said we didn't need a piano wow he don't even know the goodness that he'll bring to you and he'll just bring it anyway amen you can never outdo God all amen anyway so just moving forward also we we're planning on having our our our our church meeting the 25th and that's still somewhat connected but I I found out by just uh reason of memory that uh actually three of my kids are going to be gone and so uh and I I talked to different ones I talked to sister ptty and brother Bart both to see if it works but we we we might if if we if you can give me forgiveness but we're going to have it either the 25th or March 3rd one or the other just you know if if there's a half a dozen people we're going to try to be as as we want you all here we don't want anybody gone we want brother Bart here we want everybody here and so uh if if is is that okay I mean well I'm not trying to postpone it or nothing Nathan is here the next Sunday I mean we're ready for it now but but we just uh praise God and all these things and just lastly our last announcement would be we went to Brother John and Sister Laura Garrett's placees uh after Wednesday night we drove down to Fort Wayne right after service and went to their house Thursday and Friday and we had a wonderful time we had and and they are like you they really know how to make you feel at home you know there's not one home that I would go to of you not one single home that I've went to in your house that I didn't feel completely at home in your house and I mean they gave us the just amazing hospitality and they would love for every single one of you I mean every single one of you there's no ex ex to come and visit them they love Fellowship they're dying from fellowship they're too hours from the church they go to there there's not a message Church in Fort Wayne it's bigger than London so there's not a Believer around the corner you know and we all have busy lives and you know and and different things and and that but you know we they we had a brand new queen mattress and it was two steps from the the main bathroom which is nicer than ours and I mean it was Sister Laura like you guys I mean there was uh we never ate the same thing twice twice I think when we ate she threw it out and redone like it was just and you know and they told us that they said you know tell there's not one family here that couldn't get you know about 3 hours and uh 50 minutes from our house so about 3 hours and a half from this church will'll put you at third driveway and you know it's just amazing just we just had a wonderful time as Dad came up and mom from from mun Indiana that's actually where me and Len met and we just had a wonderful time you know you know just just a wonderful time you know it's amazing that you know in their travels and that weekend and this was not brother John but uh people we fellowshipped with and I this broke my heart I I told sister ruus we stopped there to see the kids and I you know we were fellowshipping with different Believers and one of the people said they said I I can't remember or I don't know how long it's been since I was in service and felt God's presence I just thought wow I said I just felt it on Sunday I can remember a long time I I wouldn't want to think that it's been 20 years or 10 years or Believers amen so we're blessed we're very blessed amen if give if God touch your heart you you should just lose your mind because you're blessed amen I don't ever want the testimony I can't remember the last time God touched me I mean I'm not serving him on feeling but I sure like feeling it amen amen amen just before we we uh sing the word and and and sister rusong the course went right along I I want to I want to preach something unique and so I I asked Julia to sing her song again and it's the same thing but I want to preach on understanding the mystery of omnipotent God in predestination and I'm going to repeat that title a lot and I going tell you something it don't have nothing to do with law or religion understanding the mystery of a omnipotent God omnipotent means complete and ultimate Authority and Power he is the boss period like I and brother Dale don't brother Dale is still trying to understand this in predestination that's why he gave you his love he chose to give you his love that's predestination you can come Julie and OT and sing your song and we'll we preach amen hallelujah now nothing that I did and it's nothing but predestination yeah [Music] sorry I keep fighting voices in my mind that says I'm not enough every single lie that tells me I will never meure up [Music] am I more than just the sum of every high and every low remind me once again just who I am because I need to know you say I am love when I can feel a thing you say I am strong when I think I am weak and you say I am hell when I am falling short and when I don't belong oh you say I am yours and I believe oh I believe why you say of me I believe the only thing that matters now is everything you think of me in you I find my way worth in you I find my [Music] identity you say I am love when I can feel a thing you say I am strong when I think I am weak and you say I am held when I am falling short and when I don't belong oh you say I am yours and I believe oh I believe what you save me I believe taking all I have and now I'm laying it and your [Music] feet you have every failure God you have every [Music] Victory oh you say I am love when I can feel a thing you say I am strong when I think I am weak and you say I am hell when I am falling short and when I don't belong oh you say I am yours and I believe oh I believe why you save of me I believe I believe oh I believe what you say of me I [Music] believe hallelujah hallelujah I believe I don't understand but I still believe what he said about me what he said about you Hallelujah amazing you know you know our message you know uh if we get a revelation of this message in the next two or three times I I will this will definitely be at to part two or three at least definitely but if we get a revelation of this we will never separate for anything other than Disobedience to the word you know Moses wrote the law and Paul wrote Grace and I I I'm and so you know and and I I I want to say this as a disclaimer if you honestly have a question I'm going to say some stuff that are right on the line to to jar us and and if so if you have a question about the line don't don't hide just ask me and I I'll and I'll bring it right show you but you know if we're preaching a denominational message we could go to that church a denominational message is not election it's not election and so I'm going to drop a bomb it don't matter what you do or have done in your life it don't matter what we do in this church or have done in this church if it's election it'll be there if it's elected it'll be there and I'm going to show you 20 examples where the Bible disobeyed the Bible don't be all no no there see there's law and there's Grace I'm going to show you multiple examples where the Bible I know the Bible don't contradict itself it's a mystery it's the Bible like I didn't say it contradicted itself it's a mystery of a omnipotent God you know just to to just to drop just to get you on my side you know God told people in the Bible to kill people so what are you going to do if Thou shalt not kill he told people multiple people in the Bible to take all their clothes off what are you going to do with modesty they're both in the same Bible and your Prophet said that God told them to do that see it's a mster God is Ultimate Authority and ultimate power I'm going somewhere with this just hang on when you recognize the revelation of an I'm not talking about I'm not condoning sin I believe in Holiness and I believe you have to have Holiness to see God and I was raised Holiness and if we followed the Holiness I was raised that would brush a lot of us off the screen amen so I'm not forgetting that but when you recognize the omnipotent of a PRI predestination election it changes all your religion and you could never look at a brother or sister in the church and say I wouldn't do that I wouldn't do that I couldn't do that and how do you know you know you know there was one Minister that when we made the step now this is POS I'm I'm trying to show you something and and this is long we're going to read a scripture in a moment there was one Minister when I called him and told him that we were going to start a home church he he drove hours to see us and he actually believed we were leaving the message and I'm like no no like how can I leave who I am no no that was not even the he it was completely misunderstood and you know what he told me he said you know what God told you and you can't even tell me what God told you and so I I support you because God told you that and see re Christianity is divided on opinions I'm trying to make us a family is what I'm trying to do God's trying trying to make you a family you know God's actually going to take us home someday hello and and see I'm brother Dale and you're not brother Dale so that means we're two identities but we're not two identities and that's where the struggle is and there's times where you I'm going to show and and and listen so i' not condone sin it's going to seem like this whole two or three messages brother Dale says brother Bram said If You Preach predestination to disgrace a Grace to a disgrace no no I'm not talking about that and if you know me that much you'll know that but things happen and we're not supposed to throw each other out with the wash the bad water no matter what happens and God knows that he had to spank brother Dale with the rod many times and it took a good 30 years for the rod to reach the brain he should have started beating from the head down I think and things would happen in the church and you would just like that's wrong bless God and a time that people needed Grace understanding and love they got rejection judgmental Bible oh there you go well bless God I I seen that in the Bible amen understanding the mystery of a sovereign God you know what the Mysteries are revealed brother Bram said in the seventh seal that he Christ opened the seventh seal he opened it and his very next words was but it's a mystery it's open but it's a and it's a mystery and you got to become in him and and I'm going to if you allow me you know I'm going to try and I want you to really understand the scriptures what the prophet says and if if if I lose control then I'll come back and slow down because it makes me really happy because see if Christ hadn't given me his love I wouldn't have been here I'm not worthy you understand I deserve hell but he chose election Lo loaded with mistakes you're not coming here because you think I'm if cuz if you do you'll be you'll probably be gone by next month cuz you know you loaded with mistakes loaded with mistakes but election let's stand Hallelujah let's turn to uh Isaiah 558 to11 and then we're going to read in Revelations and and and I I just tell you God bless you again we love you and we want you to do whatever you can do to worship God and bless yourself and one another and and you know I just uh we we want to be on the word and and we want to be obedient but we want to go in a rapture we want all of the good things of God Amen Isaiah 558 to1 for my thoughts are not your thoughts uhoh and neither are your ways my ways but I have some pretty good ways I was raised in the message well almost the message saith the Lord for as the heavens is higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain comes down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and maketh it to bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the swer and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth and it shall not return onto me void so it it's not it's not possible you remember if you do something for God you're going to get a grand piano you're going you know what I mean it's just that you're not even looking for it can't come back empty but it shall accomplish uhoh that's a big word that which I God pleased it's accomplishing God's will not brother Dale's will and it shall prosper in the thing where soever I send you now that let me rephrase that just a few and you shall prosper and you and and all of you not just the fight and all of you shall prosper in the thing wheresoever Christ the anointed one sendeth you that's election Romans 8:29 and 30 and I want to emphasize on the last phrase of this thing and this is the most common scripture in everything to do with the message um I understand that perfectly and for whom I did for no he also did predestinate now that person is going to make some big mistakes to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren now I want to show you something there's not a time limit you either are or you aren't period I know I know there's you know the seeds there and the Sun hits it and it brings forth life moreover whom he did predestinate see this predestination part is what I'm telling you is you're predestinated whether the sun's hit the seed or hasn't hit the seed you're still predestinated okay pred them he also called them whether they show it or not whether they go to the Mandarin too much or not and to whom he called them he also did justify now that ain't based on you that's based on him and that ain't based on a Brother justifying you see you know a brother don't have to have another brother's approval we don't we're not Catholic whom he justified them now this the part them them people them people that so that's not just fivefold Ministry he didn't say just just the you know the the the the ministry or just the the es or just the prophets but them Christ God is already past tense in your sin yes in your sin and in your mistakes he's already glorified you Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord Jesus I pray that what you showed me and that that that this bride here will will grab on to to and and and and God it's going to take us some time to digest your mystery you you're just you know God we we just have a small brain and it's you're omnipotent and God we'll we'll just fill up everything we can with you and then the rest we just nod help me Jesus hallelujah amen amen God bless you I want to let read some quotes and so I I mean we're all doing good I want you to understand now everybody here in brother Dale this is not a message condoning free love and free worldliness everybody understand that's important I apologize in advance for our screen it needs a hammer or something that's how I fix things if something's broke on the farm I get a ballpen hammer it it's broke amen but we'll do our best to repair it amen and so the denomination and my upbringing was Israel's upbringing in the Old Testament you know we we preach from the Old Testament and it's good but it's a shadow see if they did good and were good boys and girls they got candy but if they didn't do it they didn't get candy and everything we think about like if we work hard we get a bigger paycheck we work overtime we get you know but this here is different and you're going to struggle with it and brother Dale is too we're thinking that like we get something that we didn't have nothing to do with you know you know how you know we know the truth and and you know the truth but you know you had nothing to do with coming to God even though you know that and you believe that you're still struggling strugling with it is anybody breathing here this morning you're still struggling with it then because in your flesh you think ah I was pretty good I made a good decision come on you're breathing that's called self-esteem but this don't apply here it don't apply here in the Supernatural brother Brown said he said he's got a book in heaven called The Book of Life and if your names not in the book of life you're lost and will go to hell period period don't matter if you're a message preacher that's just period oh bless God I was a deacon for 400 years it don't matter it's period he said and PR he said it don't matter if you got a letter from every Church in the world you're going to hell that's against everything you have ever heard in your whole entire life for sure you're upbringing if you're good you know we take mom and dad takes to church that's the right thing to do and we get an evangelist in and you'll go to the Altar and you made all those decisions no no you didn't make any of them wow and so there's people that aren't here yet that are one of us and many of them are connected in our our extended families and we've made some huge mistakes because wait a minute wait a brother Dale has made some huge mistakes it's called judge you know there's something that is a applies to all of us and that was respects to persons and if you have that in any form shape or matter then you're guilty of the entire Bible that doesn't apply in the Old Testament so you know I'm just I there's some things I'm almost saying but I can't you see in election sin can happen and it wasn't that God agreed with it but he will turn it around to his will and he'll get more glory and brother Dale will not understand it I will not understand it I'm still not understanding it here in another one he said the Beast will deceive all on the earth who whose names are not written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world he said that's right he said that's the reason people today that that when you're not called how can you come amen it amen and and see I want I want to just put a disclaimer in here for even the video this does not mean that God's up there with a big stick that's not the God I'm serving it just means that God is so amazing and Brilliant and omnipotent is the word I want that he knew the beginning from the end I am the Alpha and the mego the beginning and the end that he knew which flea was going to land on which you know my dad used to sing a song and I'm just going slow because we need to get this because there's if anybody's read the news lately there might be a Rapture happened in our lifetime okay my dad used to sing a song about you know there's a log in the bottom of the sea and then there's there's a bump on the log in the bottom sea and then there's a frog on the bump on the log in the bottom sea and then there's a ward on the Frog on the bump in the l sea and then there's a fly on the wart on the bump on the log in the bottom of the sea and then there's a flea on the on the ward on the frog and the bump on the log in the bottom of the sea and it goes on and on and on on on forever until your grandkids fall asleep and that's like God he knew that there was a flee on the flea of the ward of the Frog and because he's omnipotent amen what does it mean he people ask him he said who will be there I I'm trying to make my quotes really short it's not to bring them out of context I'll show you the whole book message or page but it's so we can Minister and Rhythm he said what does this mean he said if your names that are written on the Lamb's Book a knife tonight to tonight names that are written on the Lamb's Book of Life Life what does it mean he said their sins are forgiven them period like period even though brother Dale's eyes can still see sin I struggle with that CU like I think you know you should be a pretty good boy to Mar your testimony and I believe those things but we're going a different avenue to to to stretch our understanding of omnipotent God he said he said go on he said if your name's not this another quote believe th this if your name's not in heaven you will go to hell that's right only those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life by being redeemed born again will be there he said except the man be born again he shall not enter the Kingdom of Heaven amen see you in the election you were born again before you were born again I know that's stretching your thought it believe me it stretched mine too I've had this on the burner for a long time I've mentioned little precepts of this because it would pop out I mentioned about David and different things you know what I just said your sins are forgiving you even though it don't show because he said all that were in my hand won't be lost there's ones this morning because brother Dale is still here and you're still here that are in his hand that are not here this morning and they're not in any church and they maybe are in the bar we're sleeping with you know they're sinning and to God they're committing adultery they're already glorified they're already there but you can't see none of it because you're trapped in a body of clay now I'm not promoting I'm not going to have one of those people come in and like lead songs or like play the piano and lead us in worship but in God's mind they're already doing that amen now I mean this should make us rejoice before we get to the end of it this is not a downer this should make you lose your mind because see if you're God's even in your failures you're going to be there and so see we got we we need to be really careful that and I'm not talking about a charismatic church I I God knows I I'm not interested but but but we can't judge others the Bi Bible says that he says judge not or you'll be judged according to the measure and that's at the end of my notes and if I scroll there my iPad might do something funny but that's Bible you know now I know the word judges but this is the word I'm preaching this morning because I'm going to start bringing up some some some words amen let's go to uh Malachi 1 1:3 and read this here um Malachi 1 1 to3 and I'm I'm just going to go on and I I pray you'll get us and forgive me if I say a word wrong uh no that's I want something different than that I'm saying it wrong um m a l a c h i Malachi sorry 1 1 to3 I'm sorry I'm I'm sorry your pastor is but um it's still the same word and we're reading 1 to three and the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you sayith the Lord Lord yay ye say wherein hast thou loved us that was judah's song God's saying I love you period and you're saying I don't see it that's us right now that's our me even say can we make it personal and say this is a Wyoming church God loves us but I said well I don't I don't really see the love for that watch this and he and he says cuz he's now now now now the prophet is challeng ing God he's really Brave he said was not Esau Jacob's brother uhoh let me ask you something what kind of a little peabrain person has the right to challenge Jehovah the prophet's doing it he said was not Esau Jacob's brother sayith the Lord yay you have loved Jacob and hated Esau and let his and lay his mountains and his Heritage to West to waste for the dragons of the Wilderness now here I want to just lay a bit of a foundation there Jacob was a liar and a deceiver and a bride and if he would have come here to church we would have threw him out yep and Esau was a good brother ouch ouch and they weren't even born and God had already made his opinion that's how much they had to do with it ouch and they actually had the same mama and papa ouch ouch is that a mystery now if we would have been judging this in Wyoming church we were said now Esau you can be a deacon Jacob you can be the janitor you can't even be the janitor listen what our Prophet said about that he said you see they cannot he's talk this this is for you you cannot figure out God's love it don't make sense it don't make no sense he says you see they could not figure out God's love their thoughts of that love meant no suffering their thoughts of that love meant a baby in a a parental care but God said that his love was election elective love elective love and the proof that his love is love is election it's don't that's no matter what happens this is this is this is your Prophet saying that oh you thought I was going out in a limb I had a backup plan he said no matter what happens his love is proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God has chosen you unto salvation by his spirit and the belief of Truth period but it didn't show is that amazing how you say God loves us but we can't understand our God and God wants you to understand him and we need to understand him and trust him you know there's a reason God said unless you become as a little child there there's got to be I mean I love these little my grandkids and brother Bernard's kids I mean oh wow you know there's just it's just nothing but just love there's no there's no conditions they're not concerned about what they're eating for lunch they're not concerned about where they're sleeping no those SS is they're not they're not trying to figure out nothing it's just they're not trying to figure out God it's just I love God period but but but God I I don't I they don't even very seldom when they're small they don't even say I don't understand Isaiah or little Curtis there they don't say I don't understand you brother Dale they don't come to me and say they don't even say why yet they haven't went to the wise yet we never left the wise but why but why but why but why why why why why why why why huh let's go to John 6 53 and here's Jesus talking he said now and and we're going to go into a a long thing and I I want to we're going to this this is an amazing thing here and Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in me now that is that's that's going right on the edge you know just kind I'm choosing a church I don't think it'll be Jesus church whosoever eth My Flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is is drink indeed and he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him and as the father liveth as the father live living in me hasth sent me and I live by the father so has he so he that eateth me even shall he live by me and I'm going to read a huge quote now that is just I mean we understand that scripture what Jesus meant but I want to shock you with something our Prophet said Jesus never explained it not even a little bit he also said he said that he had too many followers that he knew weren't real Believers and so he was trying trying to get rid of them by preaching the word so he was saying things ridiculous yeah ridiculous it's okay to say that to get rid of all the other and I'm going to show you some more stuff it's what our Prophet said You Know It's Just Amazing Just it it blows my mind our Prophet said he never went after them tried to counsel them chase them he he more or less said don't let the door bang you when you go now now I'm Not Jesus so he he knew who was his and who wasn't but can we read a quote about that would that be okay now um now now now this is probably my longest quote so we're just at the beginning and so if you'll bear with me and put up with my poor reading but I want you to catch the the theme of Christ himself our example our example and maybe before I read this I want to show you that you know Jesus family I mean this really from Abraham to Jesus was 42 Generations he come through two prostitutes a bunch of liars wow he couldn't do better than that bless God I wouldn't let my kids marry that family they put out the red ribbon and Jesus with the crowds of thousands follow me said that's too many look look sometimes strange things here and there's a few called yay many are called but few are chosen and we're going to deal with that that scripture later on probably in two weeks or something so then he said this great so then he seen this great congregation he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink my blood you have no life in me he never explained it he never explained it I wonder if he would say that in Wyoming I changed the Wyoming he put the name of the city where he put that in today no matter how popular he was and what do you think the doctor's thought and the fine culture people and the scientists would have said bless God we want to send our kids to University to get farther from God you don't think they're teaching that in America you better go to university then although I wish I could read better amen watch this he said said the man is a vampire well he wants you to drink his blood well what kind of what kind of going off on some tagin is this he's talking about Jesus by the way he's not talking about a minister that you're just not sure about he said Jesus never explained it and he wanted to shake those parasites off him that's right and they all got up and left and when he looked around those Apostles which were and those Apostles that which were was not ordained to life but he had chosen them and he was they wasn't ordained he said what will you do you say when you see the son of man ascending up into heaven from hence he come oh that was a choker he said and then those ministers said ascended up into heaven this man was born born right here in Galilee why I know he had an affair before his parents were married bless God I remember uhoh he was born in Galilee of Nazareth and he said I know his mother and all of his brothers and know the cradle that he was rocked in and seen his baby clothes and we speak to his mother and then he say and then say this man I come back from where he came from he said he come from Nazareth what does he say heaven he said Jesus never explained it he never defended himself too many parasites yet and they got up and they walked out on them no more and that's what the Bible said and then he turned and said now you also want to go to the 12 and remember watch this now I want I want you and I want you to catch this now this is in influence 64 this is after the seals he said now remember the disciples couldn't explain it either they could not even explain why they said we'll stay wow they didn't know what was going on he said couldn't explain it and they didn't know it but they known he was he was just Supernatural it was a mystery you know you just can't put my I just can't get my finger down on this amen now now I I I want you I need to say this again I'm not promoting sin the prophet said this he said if if if you're if you're pastor stops preaching the word leave amen you leave but that that's in the Bible amen see it it's a mystery man and so so you know we don't we don't want uh okay watch this is our message different the Bible says we're A peculiar people not understood peculiar means not understood I don't know I don't know about them see if our message was the same why did we buy the church we could have chose a really nice one but see what it's it's election it's an it's an election I I it's just they didn't understand God's love because of election that that that scripture in Romans 30 8:30 is powerful in God's mind there's people in this community or in the connection of people sitting here that are living in flat out sin this should give you hope if you're a parent this morning amen your brothers and sisters and sons and daughters are living flat out out there and if they're elected and their names on the Lamb's Book of Life and you may not with your flesh eyes that are going to decay in the grave that are 98% water be able to see anything that's spiritual but if they're in there they'll be there amen it's just it's just a an omnipotent God and you know and so that'll just it just you say well I don't understand why this you know Rahab the story of Rahab is in Joshua 2 1-4 we're not you don't have to go there but I'm just giving you some scriptures now she was a flat out prostitute and she married she was the the third the fourth great grandma to David a man after God's Own Heart how none of us sitting here in the flesh would go along with that I wouldn't that's why I made mistake mistakes when people made a mistake in their life I judged them and killed them big mistakes I did it you see somebody I I'm not condoning it but we're humans you know like if you live in a glass house don't throw stones and people that are throwing stones at you are throwing stones at you because you have fruit on the tree and they want to eat it don't feel bad that you get Stones thrown at you but you know if if people went out and their families did something there strong judgment comes down because bless God we're holy what about God where was God I'll show you this his judgment wasn't there his judgment his judgment was this I would that the world would be saved brother Brown said this he said his blood on Calvary paid the sins of the world and watch this he said he would have that all would have been there this this is a quote I'm by my memory and he said if you go to hell this morning you're going to go buy all Road close signs that you can think of you're going to fight hard to get there so but we shouldn't be a part of that you know what I'm saying so in my younger years when I was I don't like remembering and something would come up in a church in a family and whoa everybody just pounch on like panthers that's wrong now I I'm I'm I'm I'm literally holding back from saying stuff because I I don't want it to sound like you can go out and do that and God will still have Grace on you you see what I mean but you you know what I'm saying some of those things I could share in private watch this Rahab a dirty woman and a liar too I tell you what I I [Music] struggle she married Solomon of the tribe of Judah and they had Boaz and he married another [Laughter] non-believer that's crazy good named Ruth how in the God needs counseling and I believe I could help him it's hilarious did I say this is a mystery a prostitute had Boaz and he was the Kinsman how how could he be a kinsman redeemer his mother was a [Applause] wow he married Ruth and they had obey and he it was three generations from there and David was born maybe we can turn to Matthew 1 I know you're struggling with this so I just wanted to give you some every time I feel like you're struggling I bring up the Bible W I know it's hard for me to believe too it took me two months to get over it and the Book of the generations of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham and Abraham begot Isaac and Isaac begat Jacob J Jacob was a deceiver and a liar and Jacob beg got Judah and and his brotherr and Judah beg got whoever that was and we go down and jump down and we got a bunch of begot there and let's go to verse five and solom begat Boaz of Rahab and Boaz beg got OED of Ruth and OED beg got Jesse and Jesse beg got David the king and he begat Solomon and she had and she there's another stumbler for me I just struggling with that one How could a David premeditate first-degree murder and commit adultery I I need some help here I'm struggling but we are in the Bible and God chooses the king of a murderer and adultery now listen I want to show you something here I am uas M and dead David come on help me out Matt you know I'm r as M and dead I'm leaving the church I mean like that's a no-brainer let's just think this through I I don't need a lot of degrees you just messed up my whole family I mean for good here here just to tell you how bad it was this this dude that David killed uas he wasn't even Jew by nature and he loved David better than his Jews and see the David when he was anointed king when he was anointed king and so was the King David's inner tight Circle men they seen the power of God on David and they weren't even Jews the Jew were still worshiping sa bless God H he's the one with the annoying know s he's tall bless God David was running for his life you know the people that went down to the well to get David the water of The Well of Bethlehem they weren't Jews those people didn't believe in them no no bless God I wouldn't go to that camp meeting bless God because we're just going to the camp meeting of sa and that man gave his life yes because he loved David and David kicked him in the teeth you don't think he kicked him in the tee try taking somebody's wife the Bible says that if you were to take a brother's wife that you would never be forgiven from the brother so what chance does theise his family have they got Bible backing them up bless God I don't have to forgive David you won't hear this in the Baptist Church that okay so so you know what I I God must be showing you this because you're probably going to see something in brother Dale and you're going to go oh you're oh he just preach to us on Sunday I seen them I seen him almost run over an old lady that's not my pastor just think of David I want to ask you like if you were aras's sister or brothers or his mom and dad what would you do I already know what I would do and I'm looking at it I'm like I oh I need more help I I need counseling oh w and then God let the this adultery now David had a few wives like just 500 and I'm sure 50% of them at least were probably virgins like some of them the men died like god let's talk couldn't have you used David's first wife wife hello she was a little girl when Saul gave her to David God's shown you this this morning because you're going to see imperfections in me and I'm going to see imperfections in you and what are we going to do about it and see there's people this morning not in a message Church because of brother Dale and maybe if you were honest because of you maybe something happened in high school maybe I I've known stories of of young men where they you know I mean you do crazy things in high school and like they have a white pencil in their house and somebody from the church goes by and I seen brother Dale smoking I've never ever I'm just using that for example I I don't like turning green coffin and it was a white pencil you know I there's a picture taken and I'm not trying to promote but a a world-renowned person and they show the picture as if he's giving you the finger and then they turn the had his three fingers up but when they take the picture the one way it's like he's saying and because you thought you seen a cigarette and because you thought you were holy and because you thought you had a need to cure the church from leprosy you killed them with the murder oh God forgive me I've got that t-shirt it's buried in my closet I mean examples like that you know whatever it would be but what about God I mean you know watch this watch this I want to show I've heard multiple parents saying I believed my daughter could have did better than that and I look at God and I say God I mean you're God I mean you're you're like you're like God I don't understand God like I just want to say yeah and you know what so do we so do we we say well well we can do better we could have we you know what now I I you know I believe that you know that's not taken away from the things that we should do you know know what I'm saying are you getting the picture you know I believe in Holiness I believe in being modest can can I make you fall off your Pew can I make you fall off is that right I won't leave the Bible what if I came to church nude you're worried about a sister coming in a bikini what if brother Dale did H H hobas help me out hoba the the one Prophet J God our Prophet said that God had him walk completely nude for three and a half years Jose and brother brandham said that God told him to do it you're not going to be my pastor bless God I ain't going there no bless God I'm not going to that church I'm just going to keep on driving right on down the road bless God Solomon Saul sorry Saul when he he was a murderer huh he threw the spear not just at David he threw a spear at Jonathan his son hello and he told the Army to kill on site I think they call that first degree and he sent prophets down sorry he sent soldiers down to kill to get David because David had went down by the prophet and every time they went God M into into prophecy okay I'm I'm leaving my notes now I'm shooting from the hip and he did it twice or three times now that's just for memory and every time they showed up these soldiers that went to kill David murder you getting the picture yeah murder like they left with orders to to dictate them and God turned them to Prophet to prophesy and Saul said I can't even trust my Army anymore bless God I'm going myself he had a sword I'll go kill G myself because I'm not worried about prophesying cuz I got murder on my mind I'm I Ain got go Sunday morning on my mind I got Murder on My Mind because I'm afraid of jealousy and he's going to take over my church and and you know three or four of these brothers might start preaching and they'll be twice as good as their Pastor bless God I pray for that day amen and and uh I haven't left the Bible yet and David started prophesying and the people that were around said or sorry Saul started prophesying s and they said is Saul among the prophets would you like to know what he did he took all his clothes off and God never told him to do it I couldn't find that quote I searched for it I could not find where brother Brown told Saul to take all his clothes off and he laid with the prophets completely bar naked for a day and a half he still had some other problems too he didn't even believe in the prophets and he went to a witch and they brought up the prophet after he died and that Prophet said today yeah I know you're going to today this nudest will be with me in Paradise this murderer this nudest I don't understand I don't I'm I don't understand you could read all of and it came down to you know if you drop down the scriptures in Matthew 1 to to verse about uh verse 16 says Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary whom born Jesus called the Christ I believe there was at least two prostitutes and Jesus lineage why why it was because God was trying to show us in our day that we're going to go to church and fellowship with elected predestinated Believers that we're not going to understand that maybe they'll have a child outside marriage maybe they'll be a prostitute maybe am I condoning that maybe maybe how in the world did God take David in an adulterous situation and make Solomon the king what was his family supposed to do with that amen wow here David had committed adultery with BBA kill Uriah and uriah's family still had to live there you thought you had a battle try having somebody kill your daughter or your son and rape his wife is God omnipotent no wonder my brain's only three PBS if it was 300 lb I couldn't figure out God if it was as big as Canada you couldn't figure out cuz he's omnipotent amen now see everybody see you know the the the church world is preaching fear if you're a Catholic and you leave the Catholic religion well if you were born there you probably wouldn't cuz they it's just ingrained in you know you'll see Catholic girls or boys that aren't even like Catholic they're just they're just born there they went three times they went 10 times in their whole 20-year life and I'll bet you you can't name one that when they get married they say their kids are going to be Catholic don't matter if they marry a Baptist Pentecostal Nazarene independent up dependent it is so tude on their brain that they could have less Catholic than that in them and they could marry a Pentecostal Holy Roller and they'll still say at that wedding our kids are going to be Catholic bless God the priest is going to sprinkle them they believe in more election than we do but all those churches are preaching w bless God if you leave my religion you're going to hell well we're the only ones that got it bless God we're the Baptists and we believe in eternal security so you're going to and the Pentecostals believe well you know we got all the gifts of the spirits and you know if you ain't got them then you ain't got the sign so if you leave us you're L and the Ang well they're just the side brim of the Catholic and and so like I'll tell you one thing that won't happen here there's some things I can't tell you but there's one thing that will happen that's probably happened to most all of you in here if it hasn't happened to you it's happened to me if you happen to leave this church for any reason at all even backslide I will not say you're lost those if I do I would want everybody to Stone me oh bless God he left the shirt so he couldn't come under the authority and he went out because he wasn't one of us so he couldn't really take the word and and and we're better than him that's the new IV version we're better than him and we got it they don't got it and so bless God wow had some Believers tell me that this week every time they said anytime we go to Fellowship well if you don't see it like I well I got it because God give it to me and you don't and so you're not you don't have the Holy Ghost and every time we Tred to go to a better church that did have the Holy Ghost well then you're lost because you couldn't you weren't one of of us so you're not elected you make yourself judges and Priests and you're guilty of everything that's I think in James God help us God help me my goodness just just huh yeah wow that scripture about sa and Being Ned is in 1st Samuel 1923 and 24 anybody would like to know and he stripped off his clothes also and prophet prophesied before Samuel in the matter and laid down naked all day and all night and before them and they said Saul is amongst the prophets are we promot nerdity of course not but we're we're we're promoting election did Saul make mistakes yeah God the Bible said he actually took his Spirit off of him and we know we gave them up to torments of demons how could the prophet say but today you'll be with me in Paradise brother Brown said Saul's in heaven wow man God God see see God is God and you you're thinking you're going to put God in this box even this is our absolute it's our absolute if this was brother Brown's absolute brother Brown said at least 30 sometimes if not in the 40s he says he he would get ready to pray and he said now we're going to open the word of God and he said now his words will never fail and my words will fail or or my words could fail or they will fail or might fail but this word will not fail but what do we and and I'm not in a stail but see we have to look into this in a mystery God wrote it that the wise and the prudent wouldn't understand it and he revealed it onto such as babes that would be such as to learn you remember when we talked about and we were mentioning this to John and L when we witnessed the people that have been in the church their dad was a preacher preaching what three different churches I think honey M he his life was a preacher and they had never in their life ever heard of predestination ever their dad had preached 50 years in the church died preaching and they're 60 years old now themselves that's a fair bit of time that's a 100 years they didn't understand election they had actually never even heard tell of it before you should read Ephesians 1 be impossible for it to be lost I mean it's everywhere what did these people preach fear fear fear fear you know fear and and and now we we need respect like we should you know but over top of everything else is election if it's elected that God's going to come and bless us this morning you watch this I and I believe in in in dignity and respects and Holiness and and church order and all these things but if it's election that God's going to come and knock the walls out and you are going to start screaming and the town of Wyoming will report that we're norship worshippers it won't matter if a hundred kids run through this place and scream because it's election it's election it's election it's election we do the mechanics and that's all we can do but the election is the Dynamics the Dynamics and we I believe in having the mechanics right but that's all we can do but we're just fail brother Dale sorry brother Dale is just a failure and I you know I'm just so I might mess up on my mechanics that don't affect God one ioda I want ioda Hallelujah Isaiah 20 are we oh my good is it 12:00 woo whoa my goodness well I I didn't realize it was that LE wow I'm sorry I I I'll try to close on this one Isaiah now Isaiah the book of Isaiah in the Bible types the whole Bible there 66 book chapters in Isaiah 66 books in the Bible and if you read Isaiah it's like the beginning from Genesis to Revelation man that's that's a good backbone profet Hallelujah let's read Isaiah 20 1:4 idolatry in the year that Tamar came unto oh man why do they put bake words in the Bible second verse you just can read the first one the same year at the same time time spake the Lord unto Isaiah the son of EMS saying go ye and loose loose the sth clock from off thy loins and put off thy shoes from thy feet and he did so and he walked naked and Barefoot and the Lord said like as I servant Isaiah has walked naked and Barefoot three years three years that's half the time we've been in this church three years for the sight and wonder upon Egypt and upon the uh Ethiopian so shall the king of Assyria be led away and the Egyptians prisoners and the Ethiopians captives and The Young and the old naged and Barefoot even with their buttocks uncovered for the shame of of Egypt now I want to see see would it be okay if we see what a prophet said about this he said well then I've been a crazy man all my life that's not true brother Brown wasn't a crazy man this is in looking away to Jesus 63 the very end of 63 he said well then I've been a crazy man all my life then see cuz I wear overhauls oh bless God we got another sin and everything you see I'm reading this believe me this is on my iPad it won't go away it's even on my computer at home if I drop my iPad so you can still see this quote this is paragraph number 202 so fitting to my position that I must dress like a clergy men in other words to be a clergy don't I look good this morning what's that got to do with anything bless God you better not preach you know we're going to the sacred des and you know you should you know you're going to see a king wouldn't you dress up see a king yep blue jeans and bibs that's what my three girls that aren't married would like to get married with straw for the pews cowboy boots cowboy Heights and blue jeans and denim the prophet saying I must be a crazy man that's what he said about himself it's not what I said next paragraph 202 he said I don't think Jesus Oh I like I like brother Brandon he said I don't think Jesus dressed like a clergyman bless God he dressed like an ordinary man and he went in or among men and he wasn't nothing and it wasn't nothing dressy dressing me next paragraph but that's just see that's just the ideas of m n ouch oh that hurt me I spent all that money on those nice clothes honey that really hurt me $2 $3,000 I could have this is in 63 1229 in the evening message looking away to Jesus after this seals overhauls in Africa behind behind the pulpit 600 people there I don't think so he said it's just the idea a men and it doesn't How about if this man or I wonder what a doctor would think of this and when a prophet in the Bible was commanded commanded obedience is better than sacrifice what are we going to do with the scripture where it says have modest apparel well that kind of messes that one up oh I believe in it I I believe you're lost if you don't have it but what are we going to do with that one how are we going to how are we going to work this out Saul's in heaven and he laid nude with the ministers the prophets and God didn't tell him to do it I couldn't find that quote believe me I turned them search upside down but here we seeing Isaiah brother bam says he was command now this is like this is full Revelation in his ministry this ain't in 45 this is in 65 commanded to strip off all his clothes and walk naked before the people and he really would have been crazy wouldn't have he now but look God God told him to do it you know I'm going to stop there help us Jesus God told him to do it I'm going to shock you maybe maybe it won't shock you I don't understand all of that that I just preached I don't understand it all I hope that don't scare you but I know it's Bible and I know our Prophet talked about it and I know our Prophet wasn't a crazy man and I know in a lot of what we believe was just man's ideas was just man's ideas was just brother Dale's ideas and that's all the value they have to them is just my ideas if you'll allow me I'd just like to give you one more quote you see God is God and and and with your baptism of the Holy Ghost oil and water don't mix and you will know I I I don't I can't explain it it's like the seventh seal you will know if it's God this morning this and and and I love you but you God will reveal to you is my pastor cuckoo am I trying to lead you down a path false or is it a mystery I know in my young years I hurt people what appeared to be mistakes and maybe those mistakes turned out to be blessings but those people aren't around in anymore because they weren't welcome at all and I have to live with that you can say sorry all you want but if you kill somebody's character and you can come back to me and the family and and and or I could come to your family and I could come back to your family there's things brother M I can't repair it's like going down the road with feathers in a p and they're all over the place and I can go back and I can bring you the pillowcase brother Matt I can tell you I was a real bad boy but I can't find all those feathers it's not possible I can't find all the feathers who's going to be over there and say look at you when we get to the throne so I got scars deep scars prophet said I'm all CAU up I'm wounded they all came from believers they all came from Believers and at my at least half of my life I was the one doing it I had no inent sharing this but yesterday I put in my thing and I it's I should be doing this three weeks from now and if God tells me to do it again I'll do it again but that's like the prophet when he had preached and he preached for I think it was brother Baxter and he hadn't ate much and he'd been going to a minight restaurant or kind of a says something like that and they were closed on Sunday and so he had to go the one across the road and it was a booly boogly Wiggly one I know you've all heard the story slots you need to go back and reread that he said I walked in there said there was a 65y old woman that it used to have been a Sunday school teacher he found up later the old policeman had put his arms around her it's all right we love you Joseph brother love you with all of our hearts sister Myra see you Friday night all night party man and he seen young girls 18 wanted love needed a daddy's love and the boys he says it like this he says they were doing things that were improper they were only humans that's why the prophet said that you should always pray that your girls would marry young so they'd be kept pure for their husband and they wouldn't just hurt thems in unique situations like this I know you don't agree with me but that's what our Prophet said you know when the prophet I'm saying things to to jar us to wonder where we're at are are we Hypocrites you know the Prophet when he married the young couple with the gold doorknobs and he went back to see the people that went in the Box Car he said I'd rather be in the Box Car do you know I was sharing this with people I said you know people say well you know you can't marry my daughter until you're able to provide for her now one time did the prophet ask him if he had any provision at one time never had one penny I wouldn't give you my daughter then you don't believe the message you know what the prophet asked those young couple he asked the the man he said will you work to provide for her doing anything he said I'll work my fingers to the Bone but he had nothing he he did ask you have a place to take her he had a box car then he looked at the girl and he said if it becomes really hard will you leave him and go back to Mama that was the extension of the questions and he said I would go in that marriage before the gold door knobs and he had those feelings of this setting and brother Brandon coming right from up from underneath anointing and you know the anointing was something we've you know powerful is what I'm saying and and it was just so different than him being behind the pulpit and seeing God move like he did and it was just it just was like it wasn't even it was just and he said God why don't you just blow this place up I just don't don't lose me just just hang with me that's what they deserved by looking at it with brother Dale's religious eyes and he said a vision broke and he said I stepped back in the dark corner and nobody was paying attention to me because they were all consumed with the women and he said God showed them the blood around the earth and that was one part and then he said he showed them the thorns in his head and all these you know and the crucifixion and then he seen them jerking he said what that God he said that's you brother Dale he said that's when you had those thoughts about those those thoughts they weren't even sin said when you had those thoughts about those girls doing sin were brother braham's thoughts wrong nope and I promise I'll close with this and he said I forgive them and you don't let's stand hallelujah it's hard to understand a omnipotent God in predestination it's just really hard really really hard we're just made that if we see black we see black if we see white we see white if we see wrong or we see Injustice or we just we're just we're it's all right I'm Still Human our Prophet we're just built like that but God's not built like that God's not built like that wow wow wow amen he gave that that's why I I sister Ruth broke saying that song I broke and all of that he gave he chose to give you his love but what are you going to do with it are you going to pass it on or are we going to do bad things with it are we going to do bad things with it and no way I I I clarify it again in no way am I promoting sin in no way am I promoting these things that happen I you know you know that I I don't but how do we answer those amen I I believe and just a little tiny Speck of understanding I got I'm going to try and let God be God and I'll just say Brother D amen amen he became me so [Music] that
