and sister Sharon are are just gone up north on a little holiday for the weekend amen and so just uh looking forward to going to the park this morning after church beautiful weather and and uh just covet your prayers this morning we've been going to sleep with all the fans open and all the windows open and I woke up in the night and I felt like I had a snowstorm in my head I if didn't know if the snow we'd have to shovel out of the house but it had really cool coed down and amen but God is good amen it's just very good just thank God for last weekend just uh good to fellowship with friends and around God's word and it was wonderful time and uh if you ever go to the Philippines Ron M AEL will it's a beautiful place to go I mean there's a lot of beautiful places there but certainly have a nice place and a nice church and and they're sure Hospital hospitable you know we we would travel around the Philippines to other ministers other Islands even and then we would come back and anchor at brother Ron and so they would have to let us in no matter what time we got there so if it was 1:00 and we got there sometimes at 2 or 3:00 2:30 and every time they open the door they would ask you do you want something to eat it's 2:30 in the morning I've been sleeping in the car amen God's very good so they're wonderful Believers also just remember our our trip going Salvador we have our tickets bought um for us and we're looking forward to that believe we're in God's will to go and and just uh feel his leading we're actually going to two different countries we'll be in probably four different churches at least or five but there'll be multiple other churches coming in from the we're going to uh Nicaragua I think there's going to be three or four churches come there yeah thanks I have one but yeah anyway let's look into the word we're going to continue on our our uh topic that we did before brother Ron let's go to Romans 8:35 and 39 just Romans 8:35 and 39 living in the joy of the Lord you know the joy of the Lord you know we went through that last week it don't The Joy don't change regarding your circumstances don't change you know the Bible says that Jesus when he was going to the cross and he was going to be crucified for you and me he said for the joy that was set before him now there was no joy in that crucifixion but for the joy so our our little tiny little baby trials are like nothing to going to the Cross but in our own way we have to take up our own life cross and when we do that we should have joy amen hallelujah Romans 8:35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ so tribulation distress persecution or famine nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long and we are counted as sheep for the slaughter nay and all these things we are more than conqueror through him who loved us and I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come now that just about covers everything nor Heights nor depth nor any other person creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus let's turn over to Isaiah 6 and read verse three and this is just a beautiful scripture talking about joy and Isaiah we know that Isaiah was a type of the whole Bible Isaiah is wrote in all the books of the Bible Isaiah 6 and3 do an appoint unto them at Mount in Mount mour oh to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion sorry to give unto them the Beauty for Ashes oil for joy oil of joy for mourning and the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they may be called Trees of Righteousness planted of the Lord that he might be glorified let's pray Lord Jesus we just pray that you'll come and Minister your thoughts that you've shared with me Lord Jesus and may you bless your bride in just a supernatural way and Lord we pray that the many needs will be represent presented here on spoken needs and prayer requests Lord we pray that you would meet every need and with your your bomb of Gilead your sweet Holy Spirit would go and fix the problems that's in the body of Christ this morning and we'll give you the glory for all of eternity for it in your name we pray amen you may have your seats I just want to read that scripture again 63 since I butchered it so badly to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them Beauty for Ashes and the oil of joy for mourning here here's God giving us joy in in our situation the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness that they may be called Trees of Righteousness planted righteousness the planning of the Lord that he might be glorified Hallelujah that's what we desire to be today and you know we'll be that way when we're in Christ you know whatever our nature is that's what we'll bring forth the nature of life always brings forth seed of its kind and we see that you know just in laying a foundation I mentioned this Wednesday you know brother Braham had a vision on the on the orange tree and and he had went to an orchard and he was with the man and and and uh the orange tree was bringing forth like six other kinds of fruits and they had grafted branches in and brother brandham was amazed by that and he was talking about the life the life that tree is giving life to the whole world and he gave that example and the Bible talks about when the when the wheat and the tears were and there was a drought and God sent rain now who can send rain God can send rain and God sent rain and the wheat and the tears both rejoiced and they both Rejoice watch this those what I proph said he said they both rejoice in Holy Spirit blessing one was completely of the devil and one was completely of God but they both said Hallelujah rain and it was a h Holy Spirit blessing and he compared that to this orange tree and he and he asked the person he said well next year when this tree dies in the winter time and all these other branches are grafted in he said now this will all be orange trees again he said no no no no he said every Branch will bring forth its nature and so a branch that something else citrus fruits or different things it will all bring them but he said where will the oranges be where will the Holy Ghost be and he said when the Holy Ghost puts forth a branch from the original tree and amen from the original vine he is the vine and we are the branches he said when he puts through another Branch he said it'll be oranges Hallelujah but it's amazing how we all feed off the Holy Ghost this world is living by the Holy Ghost you are the grace this morning to the world that's right hallelujah hallelujah you know in the Psalms David roping said weeping may endure for the night but joy cometh in the morning and here David was David had went through a trial because he had fell down and and but God loved David because he could repent and here David was that that even though his his trial was for a short time he said I always have the Lord before me he said I put him on my doorpost and on my bad post and everywhere I go and every decision I go I make a calculated decision the god is before me that's the joy of the Lord you know we you there'll be many of you that are going through different trials and and I know some of them by by being friends amen and and they're not joyful you have there's people sitting in here with thoughts in their mind because they're dealing with things in the past week but God in our great hope and great joy we can come through those trials and falls down around us God's doing it for your good there's a reason behind your trial it's for his good amen watch this you know and I I want to get into this I mentioned last week I started telling you a story about uh uh George Hawthorne was a preacher in our day and and and he uh and I was telling you some about he said when when he was serving the devil he was Radical and when he got converted later in life he was also radical he served God the same way he served the devil radical with his whole being everything he was just one God you know brother Brown said people sometimes God makes just one just one it's just one brother Dale there ain't no other two brother dalees he broke the mold when he he he made brother Dale he said that I was reading quotes this morning right in my office he was reading it about different things amen but here this George he was a a pastor in a small church and he was ministering just like this and I I want you to think about what would you do and the town drunk came in stoned and sat right on the front Pew now I told you I personally know him Lan personally knew him Len knew him before we even met and I knew him and i' I've I personally sat in his services and a stone drunk come in and the service went on just completely like normal but the longer the service went the drunk started sliding down his Pew because he started coming back to himself and he started realizing how did I get in here and he was totally humiliated and totally embarrassed and he was sliding down the front front Pew and so he left him at home and you say well they'll never see him again and he come back the Sunday night amazingly they had a Sunday night service and he brought his whole family and sat in the same front row and they all give their heart to the Lord now it's a beautiful testimony but by your fruits you'll know them and that was back in the day when you used to crank to start the Model T Ford and the other people in town wanted to see if this God was real on cold Frosty mornings and how do you know that because they came back and testified and apologized to the pastor George Hawthorne because they had seen this town drunk tea and it would backfire and the handle would come around and catch his hand on the front bumper and he would pull that crankshaft up he would beat PPS on the hood of that model te car beating it to a liver bliing because he had smashed his hand and so when the people knew that you know this you can't keep news like that quiet when the town drunk comes and sits on the front viw you can see how few are sitting on the front viw this morning we need more drunks and you can't keep news like that quite so on a nice cold Frosty morning you know in the beginning of winter everybody in town just cracked mirrors through the curtains they said we want to see how this God works on nice cold mornings I want to tell you something nothing's changed everybody in this town is cracking their curtains watching how your God works on a cold Frosty morning they're watching how you are when you shovel your sidewalk and you fall down they're watching how you are in the grocery store they're not telling nobody they're not telling nobody unless they're so convicted that they'll come back to the pastor and apologize like they did in this case but you know God because you become a Christian he never changed your circumstances this drunk became a Christian he never changed his circumstances he still had that Model T Ford and it still backfired on cold mornings and he still had to start it with the crank and many many people in the town cracked their curtains to watch them after the Sunday night service start his car and they said just as expected and just like they thought it backfired and that crank spun around and his hand was between it and the bumper of the car and they said that car is going to get a good beating this morning and that town drunk looked at his hand and he said pray I think I better go in the house and get a bandaged up and they had a flood of people come and apologize to the pastor and come to the church because they wanted to see what this God was all about see God don't change your circumstances cuz your life amen you have a job you still have things at the job you you're a businessman you still have a business but do you have the the Lord that has the joy when things don't go your way do you have the Lord when the when you know your situations are all different than mine and God tries us like for me I just I mean you know it we rained too much this spring we all complain now we have bumper crops are we going to complain now uh huh see we all have to wear these suits it's called Christ and we all go through these trials and when we fail these trials God gives them to us again I hope he don't give us another wet spring I just repented amen you see that but see what's on the inside what the nature that's inside you cannot if they take your life says don't feel them to take your life feel them that can take your soul because it's your it makes no difference if I'm not here tomorrow I'll be in The Presence of Jehovah but we get in a section you know watch this people in this town are watching you your families are watching you but youed with kids your kids are watching you they're seeing how good your God is in difficult situations when you smash your hand between the bumper and the crank on a frost Day morning God help us amen you see world all to for one of two people our Bible clearly tells us that say Our God can do nothing nothing this morning unless he has a vessel to work through and I want to show you a couple examples you know every day you're a tool for either Satan or God to work through and if you're born again and converted your life will prove it by the fruits of the Holy Spirit and so when you're in a tough situation you won't lose your cool if you're losing your temper you're losing your you're losing your ability to control yourself you ain't got nothing worth getting God help us and if you are always losing it fting and disrespectful it just shows you who's using your life because it has nothing to do with the fruits of the spirit I want to show you four examples quickly in the Bible and get back in into our topic of Joy examples that were two people first I want to use that were tools for Satan and both of them were message Believers Holy Ghost filled and were believing they were helping God out 100% you're smiling that's the Gospel of Truth Peter was one what did Jesus say to Peter he said get the behind me Satan for he was stopping the plan of God and so much so that he whipped out the sword and would have cut the head off of the high priest servant let me ask you a question was Peter helping Jesus you know the answer to that he 100% believed he was and Jesus called him Satan he said get behind me Satan you're hindering the plan of God now who was Peter a tool for that day and did he love Jesus did Jesus give him the keys to death and Hell another example is Saul before he was named to Paul he was worshiping God killing these radical message Believers that were following a man named Jesus and he had the government's permission to go and kill them now he was 100% a Believer he thought he was a radical believer because he was going out of it he was going out of his way he was one of these radical believer that that washes the windows in the church sides the floor cleans it and cooks dinner and I don't know what else wases my car I mean he was radically going out of his way he was going to clear all these people out that were interesting the church preaching this false Doctrine that's what he was all he said I'll bring them in a swap them in jail and Jesus stopped them on the road and said why are you persecuting he never said them no no Jesus had wasn't on Earth and Saul 100% 100% believes he was on God's side convinced and he was 100% working for s Satan nothing's changed nothing's changed the most friction that you will get in a message in the Christian Believers will be in the Believers it won't be the friends around here are my neighbors let me show you two tools that were working for God and they didn't even know it they ran from the ministry they were asked to preach and they said no way I've never do that PR God David you know David dad said he said now take to the Brethren uh you know some perched corn and some 10 and run them up to the camp to my brethren that are fighting in the war David had no plan of doing anything other than obeying his daddy taking some perch card he wasn't working for God David was just a child he was working for his daddy and he get up and he seen something that was on scripture he seen some great baked fat giant that was defying the armies of the Living God and he said excuse me a little tiny boy could tell the difference who was of God and who was not of God what now my question to you is I showed you two examples that believed they were working for God and they were 100% working for Satan 100% 100% working for Satan and here David he wasn't working for God at all but he was unbeknown to him he was that's peculiar another example here was Pharaoh Pharaoh wasn't serving God do you know Pharaoh was on God's side did you ever think of it that way do you know that's exactly what God told Moses that I have raised to bring all the glory to me so here's pharaoh and he thought he was running a big Kingdom and God had only gave him all those riches and all that power to turn it all to god wow ain't that amazing so see the world sees what we're packing the world sees what we're packing and sometimes we're not packing what we think we're packing God help us but you can always tell by the fruits you can always tell by the fruits here in Romans 6 s 7 and 11 if you want to pull that up verse 7 it says and I'm going to get back to my joy thing here but I'm just saying see for the fruits of the spirit to come out that are gods you have to be dead you have to be dead to yourself and it's very clear to see if you're dead but here in Romans 6:7 says for he that is dead is free from sin and verse 11 he said likewise I reckon ye also to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ and here here a prophet he said see if you're dead to yourself Christ and you're sealed by the Holy Ghost and there's no way in the world it's a physical impossibility could not only he couldn't get to you but he could never ever use you because he explains it like this matter of fact the prophet said in one quote I actually erased off my iPad he said we're burying too many life Christians you haven't died yet you got a false testimony he said did you ever walk up to a casket and you know we had a friend die recently a lot of friends have dying and the numbers are getting awful close my number and their number we went to a neighbor lady and she was 68 we went to a friend we just run EO for him died suddenly Monday 71 you know 71 and in the 60s I mean you can minus it off and yeah and he looked terrible I think I just saying he looked terrible brother Brown said you walk up to a casket you could say anything you wanted to him Perry was his name you could say Barry you look terrible in this casket and he did he looked very terrible and he's dead you could say you're too fat you're too tall ugly I don't like you you can say anything you want you can say the meatest thing in the world you want to him and he's dead a lot of Christians aren't dead yet but but but said if you're sealed in Christ you're dead the reason Satan can't use you is because you're dead so it takes a vessel away from Satan cuz he you're sealed in Christ and he can't get to you he can not only get to you but he can't never use you God help us God help us in this time amen hallelujah I'm just fast forwarding here 1 Peter 17 and 8 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold than gold that perishes through though it be tried with fire it might be on to praise honor and a glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye Rejoice with joy joy unspeakable going through all these trials you can't see Christ anywhere and your life is misery in his appearing and you're rejoicing with joy watch how the Bible says this this in verse 8 are you got this up I got mine blocked here it says it wasn't just Joy was joy unspeakable and full of Glory you know those are the kind of Christians I want to be around I want to be around the people that are so beside thems uh-huh here here he says the joy unspeakable to the believer is unlimited power he's got healing salvation glory and goodness and he's got Mercy but if he has respects and refuses to receive the remedy for sin if he refuses to die then he'll get rid of all of that Joy and change it for hatred and Malice and all these other things God help us God help us hallelujah I'm going to read a scripture here and I'm I'm going to actually go into this Wednesday night and I'm going to drop my message but Romans 1417 and brother Brown says the message up and you write this down he's got says some amazing things in there about this but I'm going to skip because I'm going to go into that on Wednesday Romans 14:17 he said for the kingdom of God is Not meat nor drink but righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost now I I want to tell you some of the stuff he said this kingdom of God has nothing to do with the way you look it'll actually surprise you what our Prophet said but I'm going to skip it and go to Galatians 5 22 and 23 sometimes we think that you know religious people they put on a a $1,000 suit or or you know the the the five-fold ministry people I was sharing this Wednesday night you know like we we we're we're going to maturity and we're ready to go in a Rapture and we have to get we have to show it now we don't have to do nothing because see a sheep don't have to struggle to grow wool a sheep don't wake up in the morning say oh I think I'm going to produce wool so I can cut it off and sell it no no no he just produces wool so all you got to do to get ready is look at your nature and everything else will be taken care of if your Nature's right and you're dad everything else you'll grow wool because you'll be sheep of God you know God help us in these things amen I was saying we we had a I had a minister tell me you know and you you see these kind of things where where people are are just on Wednesday night you either are a or you're not so if you hear a minister come off the word you should never hear him preach again you should get up and leave never listen to him again because he ain't both you know the Bible says that the bitter water and good water can't mix and a Thorn Tree can't bring forth figs and so you're not like a pretty good Christian but a make believer you're like a a devil or a Christian period so if I quoted one thing off the word just you just and don't ever come back because I'm not converted I did it's not that I didn't make a mistake you can't leave God's word and then come back most of the time you know Eve only took one word should not surely die and it caused all the sin and death in the the world so there's millions of preachers that are off one word you know what the Bible talks about respects and and and all these things I mean respects like treating people differently and and nickel Adian Spirit the Bible says that God hated a nickel Adian Spirit you know what it was it was the Ministry pressuring the people that's disgusting because the minister is only a people himself soon as I walk down one any one of you Brothers could come up here and preach amen what what gives the ministers some kind of a baked head and I I had the brothers were at a convention and there was four people preaching I know this happens lots of time brother Osman Bartley told me this he he he named people around the world that are like this he said you can never talk you know if you went to half the churches in the world you you'd never talk to me I'd be sheltered I'd go out that door go home and S I'd be treated like I I don't know I guess pilot or something you'd have to set up an appointment 15 days ahead of time and or 50 days or that's disgusting that's disgusting he was saying one of my friend ministers was there I've been there multiple times and he said all four of the ministers were kept from the people and he said there wasn't One Pastor in the congregation that was even able to shake their hand because they were special but you're all special that's disgusting but see so those people aren't converted cuz the Bible clear I that that's strong medicine but that's actually the truth because it's on scripture on two part it's a nicolan spirit and it's shown respects to to a person that looks better than the poor person and you give him a better seat and so the Bible says in that that you're guilty of the whole law and you know at some part when we become mature Christians we got to take good strong meat and be able to eat it and if not we're not even converted I'm going to go through a pastor in El Salvador and he said we almost have no one one of the churches he said we almost have nobody associate with us in the last 25 years and I'll make him my precept the main thing and you know everything started from were that's disgusting amen God help us we we got to be mature and recognize that you got to you got to recognize sin and call it for what it is it's it's not you judging it it's just off the word of God you have a nickolus spirit that's obvious you're attacking you I mean whatever it is I mean if you're a sheep you grow wool it's very clear I mean if you're an orange tree you produce orange jues and if it's orange tree then it's not see you can recognize the nature amen it's the nature just all you got to do you don't have to judge just look at the nature a cow is always a cow a lamb will always have baby lambs and Christ will always produce Christ and if it ain't Christ run for your life how can two walk together unless they agree simple Galatians 5:22 and 23 it says but the fruit of the spirit love Joy we're preaching on joy joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance and against such we should have it all the time let me show you some of the things that the prophet said he said everything you have and show us the father he said everything you have need of was put in you put in your when you baptism of the Holy Ghost everything it's just the nature you either came from go if you believe you got eternal life this morning you had to come from God cuz God's the only thing that's ET and eternal had no beginning or no end and so if you think that you're going to heaven and you don't think you came from God deceived and if you came from God you don't M even in a backsliding state even in a backsliding state you'll still have the nature of Christ even in a backsliding you'll still have the nature of Christ you can't change I mean blood and water don't mix Hallelujah he said everything when you receive the Holy Ghost is put in for your life's journey healing salvation and for your joy and happiness so brother bam saying right here and show us the father he said if you say you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're happy under your circumstances of the bailor broke or the break broke or it rained too much or whatever it is then you ain't really got it amen God hi manifested himself he said the hope of everlasting life he said he promised us joy and happiness with contentment here he said sheep symbolize there are not am animal and I mentioned the Sheep saw me said and they don't have to think about producing wool if you have to check your life to produce in your Nature's wrong I mean you can't you can't have come from God and have eternal life and have a different nature than Christ so we just come with me on this journey so we all came from God does say and and he spoke us out in Genesis 1:27 and he created US male and female and we're all a part of God are are some of the parts bigger than others thank you sister D of course not so how in the world could we be in a setting like this and we all came from God we we're all right we all came from Genesis 1 we're all part of God but you can't touch me cuz I'm wearing a tie and you're not cuz I Minister and you don't yet that's disgusting that is what are we building yeah yeah yeah now watch I can no I'm this ain't meant we have unique situations in this church but I'm going to give you an example you can tell if that spirit's Alive by if more people came to hear Osman Bartley on a Wednesday night than come to hear me last Wednesday that's right I'll say it for ouch and hband Bartley would invite me to come down and preach in his church but you would come and hear him preach on a Wednesday night but you wouldn't come and hear me cuz just brother Dale just be the same old just be the same old word of God we'll just pray to the same old same old far away God and you know and we'll just do the same old stuff and I love you God loves you that's why he's got somebody that'll tell you the truth amen we live different because of our situations and to God it's disgusting it would be like what would you think of a parent that had it wouldn't matter how many kids as long as you had more than one you have two kids like sister Ruth you got two kids you're going to love one more than the other you're going to treat one with favoritism more than the other that is like that's disgust and you don't but that's disgusting and everybody looking on they're like what kind of us I'm glad she's not my mom glad she's not huh well how do you think God looks at it God saying I gave you all the same thing he said I gave you a piece of me which is my happiness and and to to to all all he said I know the thoughts that I have towards you that you'll prosper and have good he said God being out each other's throat he put us in a family there's a reason we have a family a family has a back on it's a structure we're one if we had five preachers in this church we go to the park we're just all mixed in with everybody if we need to carry chairs the preachers can carry chairs too that's amazing you know I want to tell you something that'll make you almost fall over that's not the truth everywhere brother Ron almost had a heart attack when he was here Ron Mayo because we came early to church and and he asked me something very respectfully CU I took off my flip-flops and I was putting on another pair of shoes and he took off his shoes before he came in here you can wear your shoes in the church I said we mainly have that for snow and cold weather but I said I normally clean the church and he passed out do you know I had ministers from yuganda message me when I mentioned that at Uganda after I came home cuz oh I'm above that I can't run a vacuum bless God my wife has five kids but I can't do the dishes cuz I'm a man I'm above doing dishes no you're an idiot you're not converted you're you're elevating you hey that's elev that's disgusting God don't like elevation amen we're all brothers and we either all from God or we're not from God Amen you know how could God how could Jesus when he was on Words say ye are of the Father the devil you know how you can tell by their nature it was their nature that give it away amen God help us he said Christ is the vine and and uh and is that person it'll be like Jesus it'll bear the fruits of him it's his Spirit it can't do nothing else but do that it it can't produce it can't produce nothing Life of Christ if it's Christ life in him he said you just produce anything else and you try to act like him and you try to talk like him and try to walk like him and try to heal like him and you'll see that it's false it's a p put on God help us in this day not to be put on he said you're just like a shell a man is just like a water pipe he said he don't have no water he's just the pipe and take the water out of him and he'll rust and that's exactly what's the matter today is we got too many of us rusting we don't have any holy ghost in us there's no water in us God help us amen God help us hallelujah amen the nature actually I want to go back and finish this quote we were talking about the Sheep the she he says the Sheep he's a sheep he'll bear wool because here here are the prophets and this is the lamb and the dove the 60 quote he said it's because it's a sheep's nature to Bear wool God help us God help us if you're a Believer this morning you're going to be joyful even in your trial I know some of you were were sick this past week or or come back from holidays and things happen and that and they weren't nice things things happen in our life if you have a flat tire or you know lose a whatever a vehicle job or anything but you can you can be founded and grounded on your on your testimony of Christ that even in this trial look look at the the very best example we have is Jesus says he endured the cross R the shame amen going to the cross it was for the joy that was set before him the joy the joy you know what if we're not joyful in this world under the the circumstances and influence of this world nobody's going to want to be what you are amen because there's a lot of problems around the world and people are looking for Solutions and it's not an election it's not an election it's Christ it's Christ and if you want a better solution than Christ it's a Rapture it's it's a it's Christ and Christ will give it look at what look at what Jesus Bible he says I pray thee that you won't take them out of the world but you'll leave them in the world but the world won't influence them you'll have testimony so you can be in the world and have a testimony amen God help us God help us in this thing you know it's like brother Brown said in this scripture it's not what we put on it's not what we say so much and it's not how long our hair is or how short our hair is or what we wear as much as what the fruit is is coming on the outside amen God help us God help us let's stand you can never hide your nature amen God help us God don't want us to be deceived in this time and you know if you live different on Monday than you do on Sunday or you know I was reading a post where you know and it was wrote more of a husband and wife and how the husband would go to work and treat his cogs really nice and then the that he calls his wife he would treat her miserable and he would talk nice to the secretary at work but he would talk disgusting to his wife and that you know that's that's that's false that's not the spirit of CHR man that's a double standard we call that a phone voice if you got a phone voice then you're not converted amen and when we have the joy of God you you don't know maybe like the now this morning I told you but you can have things going on in your life and you can still have the joy of the Lord coming out you might not feel good this morning but you're covering it up you may be worked all night and you're covering it up I may be sick and I'm ministering to you but I'm covering it up because we have an anchor that's a lot more than the the working night or the sickness or because it's our our hope is in the Lord our joy is in the Lord amen and even if it rains too much you have a flat tire your house burns down we're going to deal with things like that and the squeeze amen God help us to be what we say we are God help us when the neighbors crack the curtains and you get your hand smashed that you don't beat everybody up that's all around you amen if you do you might as well just forget all that put on your doing you are just kidding one person your kids will know your your F friends the family will know your neighbors will know amen it'll be like the story it won't the end of the story where the people of the Town came to George Hawthorne and apologized to him and said the god that you're preaching here we can see he's actually real because we seen him through the curtains on a cold morning God help us God help us to have the joy of the Lord is our strength Hallelujah God help us amen
