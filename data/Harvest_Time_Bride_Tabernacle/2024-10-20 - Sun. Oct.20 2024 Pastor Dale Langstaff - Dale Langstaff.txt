and the great jagon was cast out this wasn't the name of the adversary this was just a title Hallelujah just like the god Christ has many titles the devil also has many titles the Jon was not his name the devil was not his name Satan was not his name Hallelujah huj these are just titles right yes oh praise God but the devil knew that Jesus Christ was given the name Hallelujah the prophet said he was a capat and because there was a name given to Jesus he desire a name hallelujah hallelujah but there was no name given to him Hallelujah because he was not worthy right right oh of Jesus Christ that was worthy that's why the name was given to him and the Bible say at the name of Jesus Christ every thongue shall confess and every knee shall bow that Jes Jesus Christ is Lord amen hallelujah and that's the name we come in today thank you Lord that's the name that is given to us hallelujah J glory to God so when I look at God's people I see Mrs Jesus sir amen and that great Dron was cast

the anointed one you are Christ the anointed one hallelujah hallelujah when the devil come in like a flood God lift up a standard against the enemy amen Glory Hallelujah that's why you're here today is to fight glory to because you are a standard that God has raised up right Hallelujah glory to God for the accuser of our Bren is cast down which accuse them before our God day and night verse 11 is the key verse and they overcome him they who the prj Hallelujah by the blood of the Lamb Amen Let I just drop this in this blood is not the red substance right so just take that out of your mind it wasn't speaking of the red substance you know what that red sub that red substance was bleed out long time ago right right hallelujah we're going to get to that Hallelujah and by the word of their

at times you feel like that you know your brothers or your sister doesn't know what you're going through right but let me tell you this when you have been connected to God hallelujah you know that your brother is going through a situation sometimes you may not take up your phone and call Brother Dale and say brother Dale I know what you're going through but you know another times you say look here you get down on your knees and you start her to pray Hallelujah and we're living in a season whereby we have to constantly pray right amen pray without season for one another right Hallelujah the enemy will not allow you to have it easy right no way he never he never allowed Jesus to have it easy and Jesus was God In the Flesh right Hallelujah all the prophets throughout each ages sir they never had it easy Ezekiel had to lay down on his side you know how much days he has lay down on his side that was easy that was hard it was difficult but you know what it was the purpose of God hallelujah Isaiah Oh Glory to God he never had it easy Hallelujah when God sent him to preach the people when God touched his mouth and he was cleansed and he said Hallelujah when the question was asked to who shall go he said Lord send me Hallelujah you know sometimes if flesh may say that is the biggest mistake you made when you answer that call and said Lord say me Hallelujah well you know what we have no confidence in the flesh Jeremiah never had it easy Hallelujah God said Jeremiah before you were even born yeah Glory I I have formed thee yes Hallelujah and I have ordained you from in the womb of your mother yes sir Jesus Hallelujah H I have ordained you as a prophet and I have sent you to this nation amen hallelujah can I say this your trials is measured by God yes God knows what you can handle he knows what you can manage Hallelujah God never Hallelujah just call you Hallelujah and anoint you and send you forth and said you know what I'm going to send some lion before you and the lion shall devour you Hall glory to God God anointed you that you can do that you can conquer the lions in your way sir glory to God hallelujah we see here in the Book of Revelation to understand something here you know some people let me say this every minister is cannot be the same no we cannot be the same brother day we're different yeah many persons want to be like brother Bram well you can't be like brother Bram he's different we all different the Bible said Hallelujah we have different Administration in the body of Christ we all canot be the same we got to take it back to the word hallelujah glory to God we see that before Christ came on the scene the Romans Hallelujah was in power right Hallelujah sir it was the Romans that was ruling when Jesus Christ came and the SE and can I say this Hallelujah the Romans are still ruling today amen hallelujah amen glory to God yes sir and because they still ruling today there always going to be opposing Spirit yes sir there always going to be pressure being applied but every time when the pressure being applied Hallelujah God sent up to desperation and you know what God Said for this purpose have I raised up a pharaoh that knew not CH Hallelujah everybody has a calling on your life yes sir whether it is to put brother the D Under Pressure it is a calling amen hallelujah thank you Lord when it is to to administrate to ministrate some peace it is a calling right whether to use the Hallelujah whether to use the vacuum and vacuum the carpet it is a calling right amen hallelujah some people does understand there's a difference between preaching and ministering yeah Hallelujah glory to God Amen it's good and here I love ministry glory to God Hallelujah Jesus Christ he teaches us how Ministry should be about amen hallelujah the the Bible said here you know just to clear up something Hallelujah many person believe that this woman in Revelation 12 represents the wife of Christ but according to the Book of Revelation here look at the description he said there was 12 star up on her head right Hallelujah 12 star where which represents the tribe of Israel right yeah the church has always been called a woman type of woman but this woman here does not represent the bride of Christ right it will represent Israel as a nation amen yes sir before before Christ came on the scene Israel was split into two Kingdom right y Hallelujah the kingdom of the North and the kingdom of the South Israel was the kingdom of the north and Judah was a kingdom of the South yes sir and there were two tribes that dwell in the Kingdom of the South Hallelujah and there were 10 tribes there in the Kingdom of of the north right there was a division but according to the Book of Jeremiah God said I'm going to bring them back together and according to the book of Ezekiel when the Bible said and the spirit of God was upon me and he carried me in the valley of the dry bones what did the prophet what did the man of God see he saw Israel was ruin God was showing him the ruin of the nation Israel and the resurrection of the nation is coming back together as one beautiful Hallelujah the bones that were scattered it was showing them that they were scattered right hallelujah thank you Lord many persons are looking at the war that is taking place in Israel right Hallelujah they're looking at the war Hal and they're bringing him back to the scripture and according to prophecy Hallelujah and according to prophecy God said I will bring them back together as one amen One Nation not two yeah hallelujah amen so the human here represents the nation Israel right and right throughout the ages Hallelujah the devil is always Hallelujah attacking God's people right glory to God Amen right throughout the ages but here we see a key o I we see a key here in Revelation 12 in order to conquer the enemy hallelujah amen and the key is not the amount of books that you read no not amount of knowledge that you accumulate through reading the prophet messages right that is good but it's not good enough no no it's not the amount of knowledge that you know of this word right no Hallelujah the Pharisees they knew the word amen because they were caught in the word back to the word right and Jesus was the word that was manifest before their eyes but they could not recognize it amen what it require is revelation right because he said the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life Hallelujah and the the Bible said you overcome him by the blood of the Lamb this blood is not the red substance that was in the body that was called Jesus right Hallelujah it was not this blood that he was speaking of in The Book of Leviticus 17: 11 he said the life is in the blood of the flesh there you go so the the blood of God is the spirit of God hallelujah can I say this in the message Hallelujah in the message show us the father and it will suff sth US yes the prophet said he that is Born Again is the blood of God yes he said you become the blood of God how can you become the blood of God right if it was a red substance yeah right yes he's speaking of the spirit yes he said he that has Born Again has become the blood of God thank you Lord can I say this you are the blood of God today hallah you know what each time when the devil see that the blood of God is still here yes amen he's trouble right he's trouble right you know what the blood of God hallelujah according to the Bible it save us it redeem us hallelujah according to the Bible here he said the blood of the Lamb it redeems the people yeah yes sir redeem means to bring back to buy back amen hallelujah amen glory to God because we were under sin right and God shed that blood so that we can come from under sin under the power of sin and coming to his kingdom yes sir hallelujah praise God thank you Lorden oh my God setting them free from slavery and the control of Satan that's why we sing the song I Am free free yes I'm no longer bound no more Stones holding me back Hallelujah no more chains holding me my soul is resting it is a blessing amen thank you Lord hallelujah J it is a blessing today to be free oh Hallelujah Jesus was saying to them in the book of St John eight he said Hallelujah who the son set free is free indeed yeah yes they could not understand it by the day amen hallelujah they could not understand it yeah Hallelujah they said how can we be free how can we how can you say that we're not free right how can you say that we're in bond we're still in bondage and we are the Seed of Abraham amen right Hallelujah Jesus was showing them Hallelujah it takes the spirit of God to make you free right it takes the spirit of God to show you the truth hallelujah and if you don't receive the spirit of Truth you are not free you're still in bandage yes amen hallelujah in in the book of First Peter 18-9 Peter explains that God paid a ransom to save from our own empty way of life right Hallelujah and it was not paid with gold right no Hallelujah it was paid with his blood his life because his blood is his life and that is more precious than gold right yes sir hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah it was the precious blood of Christ the sinless spotless Lamb of God that's why when Christ look at his people he's seeing his blood he's seeing his life on them Hallelujah that's why each time when the accuser come to accuse the brid Hallelujah you know what God is saying who can lay any charge against God's elect remove yourself Satan who can lay in his heart Hallelujah right yes sir you come to me and tell God and tell God oh I have seen you do something yesterday Glory Hallelujah you can tell God that because God said who's going to lay in a charge against God in it there you go you think you think AB could have tell God that oh Abraham Li and Abraham told me that Sarah was my was his sister who can lay in a charge against God you think they could have tell God oh that we don't want Moses because he's a murderer who can lay the charge against God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's the tactics of the devil oh this brother do something yesterday this sister do something yesterday but God doesn't want to hear that God don't look at that there when God look back at his blood yes sir he look what he did up on Calvary Hallelujah glory to God he look back at the blood and Calvary Hallelujah when he sees people he's seen as spotless people he seen Perfect People Glory Jesus but the devil now who Bears a title of serpent he comes to deceive you oh Hallelujah God will not answer your prayer because you do something wrong because you said something that you're not supposed to say [Music] hallelujah that's the tactics of the enemy hallelujah amen in here the Bible said glory to God amen

Hallelujah verse six when Jes when Moses said to them Hallelujah out of the mouth of two or three witness legal yes it is true yes Hallelujah that was legal right Hallelujah but when Jesus but when Jesus said to them I am the truth the way and the life yes am amen Hallelujah I am the TR the way and the light they could not understand it you know what probably they were looking for his Breen to come forth and said yes he is the thr the way and the life right right his own faster Brothers they didn't even believe in him but God himself testified that he is true right Hallelujah that's right even today Hallelujah Our Testimony is not just in word no you know what if it is in word the the kingdom of hell wouldn't be shaken right yes even if our testimony was just only in word right the kingdom of hell would not be afraid right you know telling people about that God is good and God heal me right not no trouble the devil yeah you don't mind that at all brother even though it is a
