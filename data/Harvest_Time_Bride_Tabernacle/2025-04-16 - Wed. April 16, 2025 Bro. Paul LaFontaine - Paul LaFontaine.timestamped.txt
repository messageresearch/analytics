[24:49] you tonight. It's a wonderful privilege
[24:51] to join together in the house of the
[24:53] Lord with you. to be able to enjoy the
[24:56] presence of the Lord, the word of the
[24:57] Lord, all these things that he's blessed
[24:59] us with. And uh it doesn't matter the
[25:02] numbers. It's it's uh it's the quality
[25:04] of our worship and the quality of our
[25:06] heart that brings the presence of God.
[25:09] And uh so we know that you love the Lord
[25:11] tonight, coming out to the house of the
[25:13] Lord. We want to say thank you for the
[25:15] invitation from brother Dale and to be
[25:17] able to enjoy this evening with you. And
[25:19] thank you also, brother Dale, for
[25:20] supper. Uh it's that always helps to
[25:23] feed to feed the preacher. It always
[25:25] makes it better to feed the preacher.
[25:27] But I just wanted to say uh this area
[25:29] has a lot of special may be seated just
[25:31] a minute if you don't mind. I'll take my
[25:33] time a little bit. There's a lot of
[25:35] special friends here tonight and also
[25:37] just a special area for me as I drove
[25:39] through the different country roads. I
[25:41] drove these roads a lot when I was about
[25:43] 18 or 19 years old. And I just had a one
[25:47] of my first uh legitimate jobs just down
[25:50] the road here at a siding company. And
[25:53] um we worked there for um Pete Snow and
[25:56] his brother Ron Snow at the siding
[25:58] company. And so uh these roads we I was
[26:01] going back and forth looking at all the
[26:02] homes. My mom and dad, we had four or
[26:04] five homes in this area and I was trying
[26:06] to find them all and take pictures. And
[26:08] uh so we had a lot of fond memories
[26:10] mostly of being in church and uh just
[26:13] being able to enjoy the presence of the
[26:15] Lord down in Wallisburg. And then we
[26:17] were here for a while living. And uh so
[26:19] many many good things and formative
[26:22] years for me to form and to increase my
[26:25] hunger for the word of God. And uh I was
[26:28] I moved out from mom and dad's house and
[26:30] moved into a little apartment. Took a
[26:32] picture of that today right downtown
[26:34] Petroleia. And I was in that apartment
[26:36] with brother Mark Stany. He moved from
[26:38] Cloverdale and we were young and didn't
[26:40] have any money but we got enough to get
[26:42] an apartment and we were in that and I
[26:45] can remember there was such formative
[26:46] years cuz two things brother Mark when
[26:49] he came back uh moved back with me he
[26:52] was in brother Bisco's church and he
[26:53] brought tons and tons of cassettes and
[26:56] of brother Bisco and then every service
[26:59] when I was going to church uh down in
[27:03] Wallisburg I was checking out just
[27:05] stacks and stacks of tapes of Brother
[27:07] Brandham cassette tapes. Some of the
[27:09] younger people don't know what a
[27:10] cassette tape is, but it's it was
[27:13] something legitimate back then. And and
[27:16] that's how we listened to the prophet.
[27:18] And very very formative years, I just
[27:21] basically went home most evenings after
[27:23] work and just fed on the tapes. And uh
[27:27] maybe the Lord was preparing me for
[27:29] ministry. I don't know. At that time, I
[27:30] didn't know what the Lord was preparing
[27:32] me for, but I just had such such an
[27:35] incredible hunger for the word and just
[27:37] to get it in me. I felt like as a young
[27:39] man, I felt like that if God was uh
[27:42] gracious enough to send us a prophet in
[27:45] my generation,
[27:47] my generation, that I then I ought to
[27:50] take the time to find out what he said.
[27:52] And that's just how I felt about it. You
[27:54] know, we had a few youth meetings and
[27:56] different events, but most of mostly for
[27:58] about 3 or 4 years, I came home and
[28:00] listened and those tapes of Brother
[28:02] Biscos were very formative as well. And
[28:04] uh so, you know, then Brother Mark got
[28:07] married and
[28:09] uh ran away from ran away. And so then
[28:12] then I went down to Toledo and took a
[28:14] job and uh with a brother there that had
[28:18] a business and I took a job as a
[28:19] manager. didn't know what the Lord had
[28:21] for me, but I knew I just needed to
[28:22] move. My dad didn't want me to move. And
[28:26] uh you know how daddies can be. He said,
[28:28] "No." He said, "I don't want you to go."
[28:30] He said, "I don't think that's the will
[28:31] of God." Well, turned out I've been
[28:34] there 36 years and uh the congregation
[28:37] has grown and uh turns out it was the
[28:39] will of God. Uh and that was just daddy
[28:42] speaking. He didn't want me to go. But
[28:44] uh these are very formative years.
[28:46] Brother Jim had supper with us. And you
[28:49] know, brother Jim leading songs there in
[28:51] Wallisburg for so many years. And uh I
[28:54] played the piano for him while he led
[28:57] songs for many many years there. And uh
[28:59] you know my dad was the kind of person
[29:02] uh that you know if you didn't know how
[29:03] to play then you just he just threw you
[29:06] on the instrument and you learned how to
[29:08] play while you were in church. Kind of
[29:10] like some of these here tonight. And
[29:12] brother Jim he said do you lead songs?
[29:14] And the only background brother Jim had
[29:16] was rock and roll. And uh so he once
[29:19] that was purged from his whole life then
[29:20] he could lead songs purely and then I
[29:23] played the piano. We didn't didn't know
[29:24] what we were doing but you know what God
[29:26] got the glory and uh I got a little bit
[29:29] better on the piano a little bit and uh
[29:32] so but uh we appreciate the I can go go
[29:35] on and on about the memories here and to
[29:38] see this t church established right here
[29:40] in the backyard of where I had some
[29:43] formative years. It's a real blessing
[29:45] for me to be back here in the area and
[29:47] to enjoy the fellowship tonight. Young
[29:49] men and young women. Uh God knows and
[29:52] watches over their life and uh you know
[29:54] guides them the way that they should go.
[29:56] So you know uh just started to be a
[29:59] little bit with brother Dale and his
[30:01] wife a couple years ago started to make
[30:04] some connections. They were at a
[30:06] pastor's getaway rest that they came to
[30:08] and my wife and I host it. Brother Sam
[30:11] Browning, my wife and I host a like a
[30:13] pastor's rest and getaway. And uh
[30:15] through that and a few other places, I
[30:18] found in Brother Dale an excellent
[30:21] spirit. And uh I don't judge preachers
[30:24] just how good they preach. I judge them
[30:26] by their spirit. Amen. And uh when I see
[30:29] that thing and I' I've seen something in
[30:31] him that I felt the confidence, you
[30:34] know, to get closer to him and to come
[30:36] and uh I want to thank you for the
[30:38] invitation, brother Dale. It's a real
[30:40] privilege to be able to share the word
[30:41] tonight and give my small contribution
[30:44] to the bride of Christ here and just to
[30:46] be uh a part of your assembly. I know
[30:49] Wednesday nights you're missing a lot of
[30:51] people a lot of times and we have a
[30:52] couple families from our church. Brother
[30:54] Blae and his family from Windsor and
[30:56] Brother Francis and his family from
[30:58] Windsor and uh so thanks for coming out
[31:01] guys. You hear me preach all the time so
[31:03] you know you just have to say amen. Even
[31:06] if you've heard it before, say amen
[31:08] anyway.
[31:09] U but it's nice to have you out tonight
[31:12] and I know Wednesday nights I don't like
[31:13] to have ministers in Wednesday nights
[31:15] from a long ways away because the
[31:17] smallest crowd is usually Wednesday
[31:18] people can't drive so far and such and
[31:20] so you always like to have somebody a
[31:22] Sunday and it's difficult for me to be
[31:25] uh come on a Sunday but u I it didn't
[31:27] matter to me as long as the Lord is here
[31:30] as long as we're together and the and
[31:33] and the Lord is here something
[31:35] supernatural can take place don't don't
[31:37] underestimate what God can do on a
[31:39] Wednesday night. And I feel his presence
[31:42] already here tonight. And such a
[31:44] beautiful building the Lord has given
[31:45] you. And I want to sing if I can sing a
[31:47] couple songs because when you have a a
[31:50] building with these acoustics, I always
[31:51] have to sing because you don't hardly
[31:54] need microphones cuz it resonates so
[31:56] well. So if you don't mind, I'll try a
[31:58] couple songs here and see play this uh
[32:02] beautiful piano as well.
[32:05] Amen. So I'll use this one, right,
[32:07] brothers? Okay. This is the one you want
[32:09] me to use. All right.
[32:11] Thank you,
[32:16] [Music]
[32:18] Jesus. All
[32:20] [Music]
[32:26] right. Jesus said that in the midnight
[32:30] hour there'll be virgins who hear the
[32:33] great cry.
[32:36] Behold he come and rise and trim your
[32:39] lamps. Go and meet him. The bridegroom
[32:43] is
[32:45] now. But some discovered they were
[32:48] lacking the oil. They were empty with no
[32:52] light
[32:53] within. So I asked you dear Lord come
[32:57] and fill me with your spirit. Keep me
[33:00] burning for you is my plea. I want to
[33:04] keep
[33:06] burning burning the
[33:12] midnight with my lamp all trimmed and
[33:16] glowing. A vessel full of the Holy
[33:21] Ghost. I will shine the light through
[33:26] the night to the world I must be Lord.
[33:34] There is a virgin
[33:36] bride burn in the midnight.
[33:43] Oh, sometimes I really get to wondering
[33:47] why it's a struggle to get down and
[33:53] pray. I feel the spirit of
[33:57] complacency. We're surrounded by the
[34:00] darkest day.
[34:03] But I am running with a burning desire.
[34:07] I'll keep holding up this light of
[34:11] mine. Working day and night with the
[34:15] ones who hold the promise. It is time
[34:18] for us to rise and
[34:22] shine. I want to be burning.
[34:27] the
[34:32] midnight with my lamp all trimmed and
[34:36] glowing. A vessel full of the Holy
[34:41] Ghost I will shine the light through the
[34:46] night to the world I must belong.
[34:54] There is a virgin
[34:56] bride burning the midnight.
[35:02] Oh, we'll
[35:05] work till Jesus comes. We'll
[35:10] work till Jesus comes. We'll
[35:14] work till Jesus comes. But in the
[35:20] midnight all sing it with me. We
[35:24] work till Jesus comes.
[35:29] We till Jesus come. We
[35:33] work till Jesus come. Burn the midnight.
[35:40] Oh, I want to be
[35:43] burned. Burn them
[35:50] in with my lamp trimmed and
[35:54] glowing. A vessel full of the Holy
[35:59] Ghost. I will shine the light through
[36:04] the night to the world. I must be
[36:10] alone. There is a virgin
[36:14] bride burning the midnight.
[36:19] Oh, there is a virgin
[36:23] bride burning the midnight.
[36:28] Oh, burn in the midnight. Oh,
[36:36] praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[36:39] Hallelujah.
[36:41] Praise the Lord. Feel the
[36:46] poor. Sing it with me. Oh, I he the
[36:56] call and I know his spirit. It's
[37:02] moving me to give my all. Oh, let's
[37:08] worship the Lord now.
[37:11] He speaks to
[37:17] me and
[37:20] I
[37:24] agree.
[37:26] Oh, please come and take control.
[37:33] I
[37:34] fear the
[37:39] poor. I went to hear the
[37:45] word and with each
[37:48] light and pray.
[37:54] [Music]
[37:56] was drawing
[37:59] me to
[38:01] give. I have your
[38:08] praise. There's a
[38:12] deep call to the
[38:16] deep like a great
[38:21] man. Oh, hallelujah. Yes, Lord. I know
[38:26] for
[38:27] sure that I'll reach the
[38:30] goal cuz I
[38:34] feel Hallelujah.
[38:38] I feel
[38:45] the I hear you
[38:52] go and I know his
[38:56] speed is
[38:59] moving me to give
[39:10] to
[39:13] [Music]
[39:21] me. Lord, please
[39:25] come and
[39:27] take control.
[39:30] I
[39:31] fear the
[39:35] poor. Last line. Lord, please
[39:40] come and
[39:42] take
[39:44] control. I
[39:46] feel
[39:51] the Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank
[39:54] you, Lord. Praise the Lord.
[39:58] Hallelujah.
[39:59] Hallelujah.
[40:03] Hallelujah. I feel his presence here
[40:05] tonight. Thank you, Lord. Can I sing one
[40:09] more?
[40:10] There's a
[40:12] place I love to
[40:15] be. I live there all the
[40:19] time till it's
[40:22] become a part of me. body, soul, and
[40:29] mind. And I know that it's many sights.
[40:36] So if my heart is
[40:39] stirred, it's just because I'm living in
[40:45] the pages of his word.
[40:50] There's peace within those pages through
[40:55] the sh of life that
[40:59] rages and I find that rock of angels
[41:04] still
[41:09] secure in
[41:10] my lion
[41:13] hiding in its
[41:17] proise abiding.
[41:19] will
[41:22] assure that I can make it cuz I'm living
[41:29] in his
[41:34] word. Heaven is my final place. I'll
[41:40] live there by and by.
[41:44] But until I behold his face, my eyes may
[41:51] never
[41:52] dry. But there's only one way to get
[41:58] through. And those pages make it
[42:02] known to him. To me, this book may be my
[42:08] home away from home.
[42:15] Where there's peace within those pages
[42:19] through the
[42:23] stores where I find that rock of angels
[42:29] still
[42:33] secure in my body. I am
[42:37] hiding in its promise.
[42:41] I'm abiding
[42:45] reassured.
[42:46] Oh, that I can make it cuz I'm living in
[42:53] his
[42:56] word. Now I can make it cuz I'm living
[43:02] in his word.
[43:11] Praise the Lord.
[43:15] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Amen.
[43:18] Let's stand and read the scripture
[43:19] tonight. Praise the Lord.
[43:22] Thank you for letting me sing a little
[43:23] bit. This acoustics makes me sound
[43:26] better. That's must be it, I guess.
[43:28] Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's read from
[43:30] Lukeap 11 tonight in the blessed word
[43:33] together. Lukeap 11. Pray for the
[43:36] service at home. Brother Boaz, one of my
[43:39] assistants here, speaking at home for us
[43:41] now. And pray that the blood bless the
[43:43] Lord just be with the service at home as
[43:45] well. Praise the Lord. God bless you.
[43:48] Let's read Luke 11 and verse one. Sister
[43:51] Joan, it's good to see you as well
[43:53] tonight and all the friends from the the
[43:55] past. We just appreciate you still
[43:57] serving the Lord. You know, we we've
[44:00] seen Sister uh Smids today. We wanted to
[44:03] stop by and see her. And you know, I
[44:05] told her, I said, "It's it's an honor to
[44:08] be able to see these lives this long,
[44:11] faithful to the message of the hour,
[44:14] faithful to Christ." You know, people
[44:16] come and go and up and down, but when
[44:18] you have those years of fa faithfulness,
[44:20] it needs to be honored. Praise the Lord.
[44:22] Through thick and thin. You talk to a
[44:24] 90s something year old sister like that,
[44:26] uh, I tell you, she's seen about
[44:28] everything. And she's seen people come
[44:30] and go, but she's been consistent all
[44:32] those years. and we appreciate her so
[44:35] much. And it came to pass that as he was
[44:37] praying in a certain place, when he
[44:40] ceased, one of his disciples said unto
[44:43] him, "Lord, teach us to pray as John
[44:46] also taught his disciples." So, we have
[44:50] uh uh uh the sons of God here. The sons
[44:54] of God asking the Lord to teach them how
[44:56] to pray. It's not the Pharisees asking
[45:00] the Lord to do that. It's not the
[45:02] unbeliever. It's not the makeeliever.
[45:04] But sons of God want to know from the
[45:07] Lord, how can I pray? And how can I pray
[45:10] like you pray?
[45:13] How can I pray the prayer of faith? He
[45:16] said unto them, when you pray, say, Our
[45:17] Father, which is in heaven, hallowed be
[45:19] thy name. Thy kingdom come, excuse me,
[45:22] thy will be done as in heaven so in
[45:25] earth. Give us this day our daily bread,
[45:28] and forgive us our sins, for we also
[45:30] forgive everyone that is indebted to us,
[45:32] and lead us not into temptation, and but
[45:35] deliver us from evil. And he said unto
[45:37] them, which of you shall have a friend,
[45:39] and shall go unto him at midnight, and
[45:41] say to him, friend, lend me three
[45:43] loaves, for a friend of mine in his
[45:45] journey has come to me, and I have
[45:46] nothing to set before him. And he from
[45:49] within shall answer and say, Trouble me
[45:50] not. The door is now shut, and my
[45:53] children are with me in bed. I cannot
[45:54] rise and give thee. I say unto you,
[45:57] though he will not rise and give him
[45:59] because he is a friend, yet because of
[46:02] his importunity, which is his uh
[46:05] persistence,
[46:07] because of his pers notice now, it's not
[46:10] because he's just a friend. It's because
[46:12] of his persistence, his faith to keep
[46:15] coming. Amen. Can you say amen? This
[46:18] this relationship with the Lord is and
[46:20] the father is not just a friendship
[46:23] because there's a lot of people in the
[46:24] world want to pray and go to him and
[46:26] say, "Oh, come friend, oh God, and be a
[46:29] friend." No, it's sons and daughters of
[46:31] God that come in faith. And notice how
[46:34] yet because of his importunity, he shall
[46:36] rise and give him a many as many as
[46:38] needed. I say unto you, ask and it shall
[46:41] be given you. Seek, you shall find.
[46:44] Knock and it shall be open in you. For
[46:47] everyone that askketh receiveth, and he
[46:49] that seeketh findeth, and to him that
[46:52] knockketh it shall be open. If a son,
[46:55] notice the subject now. It's not a
[46:57] friend. It's not No, it's the sons
[47:01] that he's bringing this prayer. It's
[47:03] talking about sons and daughters of God.
[47:05] If a son shall ask bread of any of you
[47:08] that is a father, will he give him a
[47:10] stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give
[47:13] a fish, give him a serpent? or if he
[47:15] shall ask an egg, will he offer him a
[47:17] scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know
[47:21] how to give good gifts unto your
[47:22] children, how much more shall your
[47:25] heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to
[47:29] them that ask him.
[47:33] May God add his blessings to the word.
[47:35] Heavenly Father, uh just enable me by
[47:37] your Holy Spirit tonight to encourage
[47:40] and strengthen the congregation. and we
[47:42] commit this service to you in Jesus
[47:44] name. Amen. God bless you. You may be
[47:46] seated. Thank you.
[47:55] We were we at home. We were talking a
[47:58] few weeks about uh the many scriptures
[48:01] in the Bible that refer to a phrase
[48:04] called the time of trouble. And it's
[48:07] mentioned several places. the time of
[48:10] trouble or the times of trouble. And in
[48:13] each place that we look at um it's a
[48:15] specific window of time that actually
[48:18] refers in prophecy to the times we live
[48:22] in. We know there's been in troubles in
[48:24] every age. There's been lots of
[48:25] different troubles. In fact, in fact, in
[48:27] some days, the troubles were different
[48:29] than our troubles we have today. You
[48:31] know, people I was talking to a pastor
[48:32] the other day and he has some throat uh
[48:35] some esophagus cancer. is brother Bill
[48:37] Bailey and he says you know you know I
[48:39] trust in the Lord for my healing but he
[48:41] says this isn't like back in the day
[48:43] where you would lose your head and have
[48:44] it cut off for being a Christian I'm not
[48:47] sure I'd want to live in that day I
[48:48] think I'd rather live now and yet we
[48:51] find different troubles so so every age
[48:53] had troubles but the time of trouble
[48:55] that it refers to in the Bible many
[48:57] places is actually talking about our day
[49:00] this is actually you're actually living
[49:02] in the real time of trouble and uh it's
[49:06] referred referred to in uh Psalms, David
[49:08] speaks of it uh and and then uh in
[49:12] Daniel in Psalms 27, which is what
[49:15] brother Lamb referred to as a he he
[49:17] preached the rapture out of Psalms 27.
[49:20] And it is in there where he says, "In
[49:22] the time of trouble, so it's rapture
[49:25] time. That's the time of trouble." But
[49:28] in the time of trouble, he shall hide me
[49:31] in his pavilion. So God's made a
[49:33] provision. Yeah, God in this great time
[49:36] of trouble, he's made a place for us to
[49:38] run into and and and and and the the
[49:41] righteous can have a place to run into
[49:44] and are safe. It's a place of
[49:45] protection. So, it's many places that
[49:48] refers to it in Daniel. It actually
[49:51] says, and I want to read this one, at
[49:52] that time shall Michael stand up, the
[49:55] great prince, which standeth for the
[49:56] children of the of thy people, and there
[49:59] shall be a time of trouble. prophecy.
[50:01] Now, there shall be a time of trouble
[50:03] such as never was since there was a
[50:06] nation even to that same. That's quite a
[50:08] statement that this this hour is a time
[50:11] of trouble like no nation like no age
[50:14] before has ever seen.
[50:17] And you live in that time. And I'll just
[50:19] finish the rest of that scripture. It
[50:21] says, "And at that time thy people shall
[50:24] be delivered."
[50:26] Everyone that shall be found written in
[50:28] the book. So don't don't lose hope
[50:30] tonight because we're going to live in
[50:32] that time of trouble, but there's a
[50:33] great deliverance coming. Blessed be his
[50:36] name. So So then now as you are a Bible
[50:40] reader, you refer to some other
[50:41] scriptures that talk about the end
[50:42] times. Luke 21 is one. And I'll just
[50:44] move quickly through these so we can
[50:46] just catch what it says about the end
[50:48] time and the time of trouble. And there
[50:50] shall be signs in the sun and in the
[50:52] moon and then stars. Luke 21. And upon
[50:54] the earth distress of nations. There's a
[50:57] word for the end time. Distress with
[51:00] perplexity. There's another word that
[51:02] describes our God. Perplexity. The sea
[51:04] and the waves roaring. Men's hearts
[51:07] failing them for fear. Heart attacks and
[51:10] just the weighing of the heart. Men's
[51:12] hearts failing for what? For fear. For
[51:14] looking after those things which are
[51:16] coming on the earth. For the powers of
[51:17] heaven shall be shaken.
[51:20] And so you, if you know your Bible, then
[51:22] you find other traits of the end time in
[51:24] Luke 17. in Luke 21 and in Matthew. Um,
[51:29] and I'll just mention a few other things
[51:31] that are pressures unique to the end
[51:33] time that Jesus said. He said in in in
[51:36] these other scriptures, he said, "And
[51:37] many shall betray one another." Uh, it's
[51:41] a day of betrayal.
[51:44] And
[51:45] betrayal that actually is a pressure
[51:47] within itself. You can have friends for
[51:50] years and they're betrayed. Many shall
[51:52] betray one another. Uh, many shall hate
[51:55] one another. Hatred is on the rise. Uh,
[51:58] and the love of many shall grow
[52:01] cold. Uh, and don't think that's just
[52:04] out there in the world. That's the
[52:06] spirit of this age. And it can creep
[52:08] into our own local churches where the
[52:11] love of many, there's no affection,
[52:12] there's no love anymore. I tell you, I
[52:14] want to see the love of God in our
[52:16] hearts, the genuine love of God. But
[52:18] that creeps in where the love of many
[52:20] people for one another grows cold. uh
[52:22] you you have this betrayal of one
[52:24] another and hatred for one another
[52:27] sometimes. It says further in verse 31
[52:29] in Luke 21. So likewise, and these are
[52:32] the ones I want characteristics I'd like
[52:34] you to uh catch tonight, when you see
[52:37] these things come to pass, know that the
[52:40] kingdom of God is nigh at hand. Verily,
[52:42] I say unto you, this generation shall
[52:44] not pass till all be fulfilled. Heaven
[52:48] and earth shall pass away, but my words
[52:51] shall not pass away. We are the
[52:53] generation that watches every kingdom of
[52:56] this world and every kingdom be shaken.
[52:59] Can you say amen? Every kingdom will be
[53:02] shaken. And uh he said heaven and earth,
[53:06] this is the generation will watch heaven
[53:08] and earth pass away. And guess what?
[53:11] There's only one thing left standing. My
[53:13] words shall never pass away. We're going
[53:16] to live in an hour. We're going to
[53:18] experience and we're going to see it. We
[53:20] can't put our trust in anything except
[53:23] the word of God cuz it's the only thing
[53:25] that'll last and stand forever. Don't
[53:27] depend on your money. Don't depend on
[53:29] the the future. Don't depend on your
[53:32] government. Don't depend on our
[53:34] government. Can you say amen? He said
[53:37] the only thing left standing will be my
[53:40] word and it'll last forever. Build your
[53:44] life upon that. Notice some other uh
[53:46] descriptions though of the time of
[53:48] trouble. And take heed to yourselves
[53:51] lest at any time your hearts be
[53:54] overcharged. Notice how specific. So you
[53:57] know when I say there's earthquakes and
[53:59] diverous places and distress of nations,
[54:02] we can all say amen. But now see if you
[54:04] can say amen to this. Take heed to
[54:07] yourselves.
[54:09] It gets personal that your hearts don't
[54:11] become
[54:13] overburdened, overcharged with surfing.
[54:16] In other words, abundance with
[54:18] drunkenness. And that's not drunkenness
[54:21] as far as drinking uh alcohol, but it's
[54:24] just the the overabundance of things
[54:27] till you become like you're drunk and
[54:29] the cares of this life, which is
[54:31] worries,
[54:33] worries and fears. So he is describing
[54:37] our time of trouble that worry and fear
[54:40] and overabundance of things can cause
[54:43] your heart to be overburdened. That's
[54:46] our day. Amen. That wasn't in Luther's
[54:49] day. It wasn't in Wesley's day. This is
[54:51] our time. Goes on to say uh that you're
[54:55] bound you're overcharged by the cares of
[54:57] life and worries of life. So that day
[54:59] come upon you unaware. For as a snare
[55:02] shall it come on all them that dwell on
[55:03] the face of the o whole earth. Watch ye
[55:06] therefore and pray always. I'll pick up
[55:09] Philippians 4:6 where it says, "Be
[55:10] careful for nothing. Don't be worried
[55:13] about anything, but in everything by
[55:15] prayer and supplication with
[55:17] thanksgiving, let your requests be made
[55:19] known unto God." Here's the promise. And
[55:22] the peace of God which passes all
[55:25] understanding shall keep, guard, protect
[55:31] your hearts and minds through Christ
[55:34] Jesus. Amen. So now we have a we have a
[55:37] base here that's trying to uh uh te uh
[55:41] tell us and I find in these scriptures
[55:44] the biggest emphasis above all
[55:46] challenges of our time is the attack
[55:49] from the enemy on our minds and upon our
[55:53] hearts. Amen. And that means the attack
[55:55] on our thoughts thought life, our
[55:58] thoughts and on on our emotions
[56:03] because your hearts is just the seed of
[56:04] your emotions. Your heart is your seed
[56:07] of emotions. Your mind is where your
[56:09] thoughts are. So in these scriptures,
[56:12] it's it's an attack mostly on our hearts
[56:16] and minds.
[56:18] Um, for a believer, you don't have to
[56:21] worry about your soul when you have the
[56:23] Holy Ghost because it's settled. It's
[56:26] sealed.
[56:28] It seals the devil out. It seals God in.
[56:33] Grieve not the Holy Spirit where you are
[56:36] sealed into the day of redemption. So,
[56:39] the devil can't attack that. The devil
[56:41] can't get to that. So, what he's left
[56:43] with is our thoughts and our emotions.
[56:47] That's right. The greatest attack today,
[56:49] trust me, I've been a pastor for 36
[56:51] years and also I've been a father and
[56:54] I've watched my family. The greatest
[56:56] attack from the enemy is on our thoughts
[56:59] and our emotions. Yes, sir.
[57:03] So, you know, we we got to be aware of
[57:05] this because we can't be a we've got to
[57:07] know where the enemy is fighting us.
[57:09] Amen. Amen. My my fight with the enemy
[57:11] is and I know he tries to get us to
[57:14] disbelieve, but he's never going to get
[57:16] me to disbelieve this message. And he
[57:18] should have learned that by now. Yes,
[57:20] sir. He should have learned that. But
[57:23] you know, Satan, he's real dumb. And he
[57:25] don't pick up on things very quickly.
[57:28] And for 6,000 years, he's been fighting
[57:30] believers, trying to get them to
[57:32] disbelieve. And he still has never won.
[57:34] He's never won. Can you say amen?
[57:37] Because once that believer, it's just
[57:39] like uh I think of God telling uh uh uh
[57:43] Satan, have you considered my servant
[57:46] Job?
[57:47] And he's actually suggesting, go do what
[57:49] you want to him. You'll never get him to
[57:52] curse God. You'll never get him to deny.
[57:55] And that was before the Holy Ghost. Wow.
[57:58] But he had such confidence in what he
[58:00] had placed within him that he said,
[58:02] "You'll never get him to deny me. Take
[58:05] him through. Take his family. Right. So,
[58:07] so you see now the soul gets sealed in
[58:11] and so Satan attacks the emotions
[58:15] and the thought life.
[58:18] So that's the biggest challenge. Our
[58:19] thoughts and our emotions are under
[58:21] attack. They're being manipulated.
[58:24] They're being clouded. They're being
[58:26] perverted. In some cases, he'd like to
[58:28] pervert our minds. Distressed and
[58:31] surrounded and filled with fear. Not our
[58:34] souls but our thoughts and our emotions
[58:36] are under attack surrounded and trying
[58:40] to fill us with fear. It tries to attack
[58:43] the family. Even in my own family the
[58:46] last two or three years the enemy
[58:49] attacking my family. My daughter, she
[58:51] went through a real uh mentally
[58:53] depressing time and it was a scary thing
[58:56] to go through. Very scary. And I know my
[58:59] daughter loves the Lord and has the Holy
[59:01] Ghost. But the devil attacked her mind
[59:05] and we were worried for a while, but we
[59:07] just brought it to the Lord. I I want to
[59:08] say thank the Lord that she's all well
[59:11] now by the grace of God. And we and
[59:14] recently uh we had a brother-in-law in
[59:16] our family, my wife's brother, my wife's
[59:19] brother-in-law and my brother-in-law,
[59:21] and he committed suicide. And it was a
[59:24] very very hard difficult time. I'm glad
[59:26] I didn't have to do the funeral cuz it's
[59:29] hard to describe someone who's attending
[59:31] church every Sunday at a message church.
[59:35] And yet he's going through something
[59:36] that nobody knows about. The devil's
[59:39] attacking him in his emotions, in his
[59:42] mind, in his past challenges and
[59:45] struggles and nobody knew. He more, you
[59:48] know, if I was still able to talk to
[59:50] him, say, "You've got to open your
[59:51] heart. You've got to get help and get
[59:53] counsel and get, you know, turn to the
[59:55] Lord. Don't hide that in your heart. But
[59:57] I It makes you wonder now. I talked to
[59:59] some of the preachers who did the
[1:00:00] funeral and it's like it makes us ever
[1:00:03] so sober to the fact don't think just
[1:00:06] because people are attending a message
[1:00:08] church that everything is okay.
[1:00:13] He was attending faithfully every
[1:00:14] Sunday, but the devil was attacking him
[1:00:16] in his emotions. We've got to bring
[1:00:19] everything to the throne of God. We've
[1:00:22] got to bring our hearts, everything to
[1:00:24] the throne of God because secretly
[1:00:26] Satan, it was a I don't want to say more
[1:00:28] about it, but it was a tragic thing. Uh,
[1:00:31] you know, turning right in in front of
[1:00:33] his family and shooting himself. It was
[1:00:36] a it's the children are still uh trying
[1:00:39] to get over it. It's it's a terrible
[1:00:41] thing. But Satan messes with the
[1:00:44] stability in our minds. Satan is
[1:00:47] fighting that. And this may not be a
[1:00:50] highly revelated subject here tonight,
[1:00:52] but I tell you, I I I feel like I like
[1:00:54] to hit the devil where he's fighting.
[1:00:57] Can I get an amen? I like to expose the
[1:00:59] devil where he's really fighting. You
[1:01:02] know, I could talk about the seventh
[1:01:03] seal tonight, but you know what? When
[1:01:05] God gives you a revelation of that
[1:01:07] seventh seal and God has revealed Christ
[1:01:09] personally to you, that's the full
[1:01:11] manifestation of the seven seal of the
[1:01:13] coming of the Lord. You find your place
[1:01:15] in Christ and you have an upper edge on
[1:01:18] the enemy.
[1:01:20] And and so this is what it's all about.
[1:01:22] The prophet is clear of how strange
[1:01:24] these times we live in. This is over 60
[1:01:26] years ago. He says about this age, how
[1:01:29] strange in this age of plenty, this is
[1:01:32] in the seven church age book. In this
[1:01:34] age of plenty, in this age of progress,
[1:01:36] in this age of abundance, how can there
[1:01:38] be trials? Well, now it is strange. But
[1:01:41] in this age of plenty and opportunity,
[1:01:43] when everyone has so much and there's so
[1:01:46] much more to be had, what with all the
[1:01:48] inventions to do our work and so many
[1:01:50] things give to give us pleasure,
[1:01:52] suddenly we find mental illness
[1:01:57] taking such a toll as to alarm the
[1:01:59] nation. when everybody ought to be happy
[1:02:02] with really nothing to be unhappy about.
[1:02:05] Millions are taking sedatives at night,
[1:02:08] pet pills in the morning, rushing to
[1:02:10] doctors, and I'm not against doctors,
[1:02:12] but rushing to doctors, entering
[1:02:14] institutions, and trying to drown out
[1:02:16] unknown fears by alcohol. Yes, this age
[1:02:20] boast of its tremendous stores of
[1:02:22] worldly goods, but the people are less
[1:02:24] happy than ever. This age boasts of its
[1:02:26] spiritual attainments, but the people
[1:02:28] are less sure of themselves than ever.
[1:02:31] This age boasts of better moral values
[1:02:33] and it is more corrupt than any age
[1:02:35] since the flood. This brother Brandham
[1:02:38] talking now.
[1:02:40] Uh it talks about its knowledge and its
[1:02:42] science but it is fighting a losing
[1:02:43] battle in all fields for the human mind
[1:02:46] and the soul and the spirit cannot
[1:02:48] comprehend or keep a breast with all the
[1:02:50] changes that have come upon the earth.
[1:02:52] In one generation, we have gone all the
[1:02:54] way from the horse and buggy age to the
[1:02:56] space age. And we are proud and we are
[1:02:59] boastful about it. But inside is a dark
[1:03:02] void cavern that is crying out in
[1:03:05] torment.
[1:03:07] And without any known reason, men's
[1:03:09] hearts are failing for fear. And the
[1:03:11] world is so darkened that this age could
[1:03:13] well be called the age of neurotics. It
[1:03:16] boasts, but it cannot back it up. It
[1:03:18] cries peace and there is no peace. It
[1:03:21] cries that it has a great uh amplit uh
[1:03:24] amplitude of all things, but it keeps
[1:03:27] burning with desire like an unsatisfied
[1:03:31] fire. Amen. That's your prophet's words.
[1:03:36] Like an unsatis never at peace, never
[1:03:40] satisfied. Got all this world goods but
[1:03:44] not satisfied. That's the age we live
[1:03:46] in. Unsatisfied fire. I got to preach a
[1:03:49] sermon on that sometime.
[1:03:51] Unsatis I'll tell you there's only
[1:03:53] satisfaction in the Holy Ghost and in
[1:03:55] the Lord and in his word. Can you say
[1:03:58] amen? Amen. He brings true satisfaction.
[1:04:01] Yes. Amen. Amen. But I believe the Lord
[1:04:04] today has
[1:04:05] provided a place for us to run to.
[1:04:09] Amen. I believe the Lord has provided a
[1:04:12] place for us to hide. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:04:15] A place of peace. Amen. And one of the
[1:04:18] main things he points to in many of
[1:04:20] these references, he points to our
[1:04:23] prayer. So this is my subject tonight as
[1:04:25] as the disciples asked Jesus, teach us
[1:04:28] to pray in all of this pressure I talked
[1:04:30] about in all this time of trouble. He he
[1:04:34] actually points us in the last thing he
[1:04:36] says there in Luke, he says, "Watch
[1:04:39] therefore and pray always." In the
[1:04:42] scripture I read in in I just go back to
[1:04:44] it again, refer to it. Philippians 4,
[1:04:47] don't be worried about anything, but
[1:04:48] take everything to prayer and
[1:04:50] supplication, thanksgiving. Let your
[1:04:52] requests be made known to God, and the
[1:04:54] peace of God which passes understanding
[1:04:56] shall keep your hearts and minds through
[1:04:58] Christ Jesus. So, there's the answer.
[1:05:01] And so, he points us to prayer more than
[1:05:04] anything else. He points us to prayer.
[1:05:06] One of the main responses and resources
[1:05:09] we pull from in the hour we live in is
[1:05:12] prayer. Our
[1:05:15] words reaching the heart of God is more
[1:05:19] important than it's ever been before.
[1:05:23] Our heart breaking through and reaching
[1:05:26] the heart of God is more important in
[1:05:29] this hour than anything.
[1:05:31] When he says pray always, when he says
[1:05:33] turn to prayer, when he says bring your
[1:05:35] petitions, when he's emphasizing prayer,
[1:05:38] you would think in this age there would
[1:05:39] be something different. There'll be give
[1:05:41] us something, give us a greater
[1:05:42] revelation or give us something uh to
[1:05:45] deal with this. Give us something else.
[1:05:47] But you know what? He points to our
[1:05:48] prayer.
[1:05:51] Our prayer. And uh uh we think under
[1:05:55] these times of trouble, he would
[1:05:57] emphasize something else, but he didn't.
[1:05:59] It was prayer. Prayer. Don't we need
[1:06:01] something more than prayer? Don't we
[1:06:03] need something else? No. The answer,
[1:06:06] excuse me, the
[1:06:07] answer will be within you. Amen. Amen.
[1:06:11] Amen.
[1:06:12] Amen. This culture looks us for the
[1:06:15] answer everywhere else. It does. But we
[1:06:19] have enough scriptures and the message
[1:06:20] to point us and even the message uh
[1:06:24] brother Brandon preach he that is in you
[1:06:27] is such a significant you know these
[1:06:29] these things of brother Brandham these
[1:06:31] messages they're not sermons
[1:06:34] they're announcements. Yes. They're
[1:06:37] proclamations from God.
[1:06:40] It's leading sons and daughters of God
[1:06:43] into their adoption.
[1:06:46] Yes, sir. A lot of different sermons.
[1:06:47] Some are faithb building. Some are
[1:06:49] doctrinal. Some are revealing the seals,
[1:06:51] but not all of them are doctrinal
[1:06:53] messages. And when you have a message
[1:06:55] like he cares, do you care? That's not a
[1:06:58] doctrinal message. That's actually
[1:07:00] teaching sons how to approach God. cuz
[1:07:03] this is the hour we're going to have to
[1:07:05] know how to get through. We're going to
[1:07:06] have to have the prayer of faith. We're
[1:07:08] going to have to be able to bombard
[1:07:09] heaven. Can you say amen? We need a a a
[1:07:12] prayer that's a prayer of faith with
[1:07:14] perfect faith because we can't turn to
[1:07:17] any other answers. The world won't have
[1:07:19] the answers. And here's the answer. The
[1:07:21] answer will be within you. He that is in
[1:07:24] you. I would say that that would be a
[1:07:25] theme of this entire message. The
[1:07:27] healing came forth the discernment. But
[1:07:29] when we come to the third pole, it's he
[1:07:31] that is in you, not he that is in
[1:07:34] brother Brandham, he that is in you
[1:07:37] pouring out of you what he's already
[1:07:40] deposited in there and getting it out. I
[1:07:43] I was just a few weeks ago on Hadtie
[1:07:45] Wright and I was so blessed to see I
[1:07:47] know we've heard that we never get tired
[1:07:49] of that story but you know in that
[1:07:51] incident of the third pole he comes down
[1:07:53] in that little house and and so now
[1:07:56] here's the third pole. It's the greater
[1:07:58] works. It's thus sayith the Lord. It's
[1:08:00] you speaking the word. Right? So he
[1:08:02] comes in and he says it to this little
[1:08:03] poor woman and he says he was testifying
[1:08:06] and she said, "Brother Brandon, that
[1:08:08] ain't nothing but the truth." Something
[1:08:09] came in that room that actually was a
[1:08:12] greater glory, Brother Bam said, than
[1:08:13] he's ever seen in any other place. In
[1:08:15] that little house was a greater glory
[1:08:17] than he's ever felt in all the meetings
[1:08:20] he was in. It's showing where this third
[1:08:23] pole is going. It doesn't have to be
[1:08:25] just in church. Amen. The five
[1:08:28] manifestations of the third pole, none
[1:08:30] of them were in church. One was on the
[1:08:33] phone.
[1:08:36] And it's showing God has doesn't have to
[1:08:38] do it in church, but he wants us to be
[1:08:40] available and ready at any time for his
[1:08:43] power to work in us. Can you say amen?
[1:08:46] Wherever it is. Because it's not about
[1:08:48] being around brother Brandham or being
[1:08:49] around the pastor. It's he that is in
[1:08:51] you. That's the revelation.
[1:08:54] And so we find that he said, "I got to
[1:08:56] finish the story, but he said he said
[1:08:58] now sister because you said that he said
[1:09:00] to tell to tell you whatever you say,
[1:09:02] whatever it is, whatever your desire
[1:09:04] is." And he she goes, "Brother Bram,"
[1:09:07] she said, "I wouldn't know. I don't what
[1:09:08] do you think I should ask? I don't
[1:09:10] know." He said, "Whatever it is, ask for
[1:09:12] it right now." And brother Ben made some
[1:09:13] suggestions. You don't have any money.
[1:09:15] You don't have a dime to your name. What
[1:09:17] about some money? Your sister's a
[1:09:18] over here. Ask for her healing.
[1:09:21] And you know and and he mentioned two or
[1:09:23] three things and then he says but what
[1:09:25] is your greatest desire?
[1:09:30] You know what God is doing? He's
[1:09:33] reaching down into something beyond
[1:09:36] temporal that's within her that's
[1:09:38] eternal.
[1:09:39] [Music]
[1:09:41] And she's not even going to ask for
[1:09:43] something temporal. Even though if she
[1:09:45] asked it, God would give it. We are
[1:09:48] right.
[1:09:49] I believe friends that God is doing
[1:09:51] something in us that it's reaching to
[1:09:53] the very heart of God to bring the
[1:09:56] spoken word to his people. But then he's
[1:09:59] reaching into the depths of us. And he
[1:10:02] says that's what you do. Ask for your
[1:10:05] greatest desire.
[1:10:08] And it was eternal.
[1:10:10] She looked over those boys snick
[1:10:12] snickering and making fun. I want the
[1:10:15] salvation of my two sons. That was
[1:10:17] eternal.
[1:10:20] You take the power of that spoken word
[1:10:21] there and you take the desire of that
[1:10:24] simple woman and you put that together,
[1:10:27] something supernatural is going to
[1:10:28] happen. Hallelujah. Somebody say,
[1:10:31] "Praise the Lord." It's he that is in
[1:10:34] you, not he that's in the prophet. That
[1:10:37] that's the first and second Paul. He
[1:10:39] that is in you is what we're coming to.
[1:10:42] What is it in you? what's in there? He
[1:10:44] said, "Well, brother Paul, it's so
[1:10:45] clouded over with all my past and all my
[1:10:48] and my worries of finances and all
[1:10:50] that." Listen, let God get beyond all
[1:10:52] those pressures. Get beyond those
[1:10:55] worries. God's going to take care of
[1:10:57] you. Can you say that? I've never seen
[1:10:59] the righteous forsaken or receive
[1:11:01] begging for bread. Don't worry about
[1:11:04] those things. Put them in the hands of
[1:11:05] God. What is it in you that God's trying
[1:11:08] to bring out of you?
[1:11:11] Blessed be his name.
[1:11:13] I tell you, I can shout in here tonight
[1:11:16] right here in Wyoming, Canada. Glory be
[1:11:19] to God. It don't take a lot of people.
[1:11:22] Can you say amen? It takes the word and
[1:11:24] the Lord bringing his word to us. Praise
[1:11:27] the Lord. So listen now. The words
[1:11:30] coming from a believer will be very
[1:11:32] important in this hour. Our prayers
[1:11:35] can't be surface prayers.
[1:11:38] Not in this hour. We can't just say
[1:11:41] prayers like the Catholics.
[1:11:43] We can't just skim through and say,
[1:11:45] "Lord, and we can't go to God just when
[1:11:47] there's an emergency either."
[1:11:50] That's what the world does. They only
[1:11:51] want God in an emergency. Has to be a
[1:11:54] relationship with him. Continually
[1:11:56] talking to him. So, our prayers can't be
[1:11:59] surfaced. The difference is there's a
[1:12:01] difference in saying prayers and praying
[1:12:04] from the depths of our heart.
[1:12:06] Reach into the very depths of ourselves
[1:12:08] and pull it out. So our words come forth
[1:12:10] before God to see an effect, looking for
[1:12:13] an effect, looking for a mighty God to
[1:12:16] step in. Can you say amen? Thank you,
[1:12:18] Lord. There are truly some places we
[1:12:19] come uh
[1:12:21] upon in our lives, and I've been there.
[1:12:26] And we're I think we're going to have
[1:12:27] more places that we get to in our lives
[1:12:30] that we're left with nothing else except
[1:12:34] our prayer.
[1:12:35] right now.
[1:12:37] I'm a pastor that there are troubles
[1:12:40] that come sometimes in people's lives
[1:12:42] that are so complex.
[1:12:45] I'm I'm being honest. I don't have the
[1:12:47] answer to it.
[1:12:49] Because Satan has made things so
[1:12:50] complex.
[1:12:52] If I can find an answer in the word, I
[1:12:54] I'll find it. I'll do everything in my
[1:12:56] power. But there are some things Satan
[1:12:57] has made so complex. So the only thing
[1:12:59] I'm left with is to call on a
[1:13:01] supernatural God and pray together with
[1:13:04] that person. Say, "God knows what this
[1:13:07] is. God will bring you through this."
[1:13:12] So we want our prayers to be effective
[1:13:14] when we go to him, not hindered. We need
[1:13:16] the kind of prayer that moves. Is this
[1:13:18] okay with everybody tonight?
[1:13:20] We need the kind of prayer that moves
[1:13:22] God and goes deeper than words. Can you
[1:13:25] say amen? Amen. We need them to reach
[1:13:28] the heart of God. James refers to the
[1:13:31] prayer of faith shall save the sick. Not
[1:13:33] just a prayer, but a prayer of faith,
[1:13:36] but a confidence when we pray. Confess
[1:13:38] your faults one another if you they
[1:13:40] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:13:42] shall recover. He said uh uh Elijah was
[1:13:44] a man subject to life's passions as we
[1:13:47] are. Yes. Yes. And he prayed and God
[1:13:49] shut up the heavens. And brother Abraham
[1:13:51] says, "Now a righteous man is not a
[1:13:53] perfect man." There you go. When he said
[1:13:56] Elijah was a man subject like per
[1:13:58] passions, he wasn't a perfect man. He
[1:14:00] made flaws. He made mistakes.
[1:14:04] We might as well include that to the
[1:14:05] Elijah of today. He was a human being.
[1:14:08] He made mistakes. Anybody who preaches a
[1:14:10] deity that he was perfect is preaching
[1:14:13] you false doctrine. He was like the
[1:14:15] Elijah of the Bible. He had mistakes. He
[1:14:17] had flaws. And yet God heard his prayer.
[1:14:21] So Burban says a righteous man is not a
[1:14:23] perfect man but a righteous man has put
[1:14:25] his trust in the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:14:28] He put his trust in Calvary and when
[1:14:31] he's putting his full trust in that then
[1:14:33] he can bring boldly the prayer of faith
[1:14:37] and the prayer of faith the
[1:14:39] effectual fervent
[1:14:42] prayer of a righteous man avaleth much.
[1:14:48] Glory be to God.
[1:14:52] Yes sir. My brother and sister, that's
[1:14:54] the kind of prayer that we want before
[1:14:56] God.
[1:14:58] We have to have confidence in our
[1:15:00] prayer.
[1:15:02] But you know, sometimes you need to
[1:15:04] remove hindrances to your prayer so the
[1:15:06] channel is free and clear.
[1:15:09] It's one thing to have trouble come in
[1:15:12] your life. It's worse to have trouble
[1:15:13] with your prayer in the midst of
[1:15:15] trouble. Yeah, cuz you feel
[1:15:18] condemnation. You feel guilty. How
[1:15:20] many's ever felt, well, don't raise your
[1:15:21] hand, but how many's ever felt, I've
[1:15:23] been in time, I didn't feel worthy to
[1:15:25] pray.
[1:15:27] At the time I needed to pray, I didn't
[1:15:28] feel worthy to go to God. And that's the
[1:15:31] enemy's work. Amen. We got all these
[1:15:34] hindrances to our prayer. We got to make
[1:15:36] sure to remove all these
[1:15:37] hindrances, unworthiness, whatever it
[1:15:39] is. We got to we we've got to remove the
[1:15:42] hindrances cuz at the moment that we
[1:15:44] need it, we're going to need to know go
[1:15:45] to God and everything's under the blood.
[1:15:47] Uh can you say amen? And and so you know
[1:15:50] we we have to you know Satan tries to
[1:15:52] steal and question uh whether we have a
[1:15:56] right to pray and weigh them with your
[1:15:58] worthiness. Uh what did you do this
[1:16:01] week? What did you do last month? Satan
[1:16:03] reminding you so that why? So you don't
[1:16:05] have you don't feel worthy to pray. You
[1:16:07] don't feel worthy to talk to God. You
[1:16:11] and and Satan likes to trap you into
[1:16:13] that.
[1:16:16] And the obvious thing, of course, is if
[1:16:18] you have unconfessed sin in your life,
[1:16:20] that's the great that's a great
[1:16:21] hindrance. And you must bring those
[1:16:23] things under the blood. Amen. Because
[1:16:25] you can't have confidence when you have
[1:16:26] unconfessed sin. But Satan is clever to
[1:16:30] bring you under uh uh like a penance.
[1:16:35] Yes.
[1:16:37] uh for your sins. You can ask God for
[1:16:40] forgiveness, but then he he wants to
[1:16:43] teach penance because his church does
[1:16:44] that. You know,
[1:16:46] Satan's church teaches penance that you
[1:16:50] can't just ask for him to forgive you.
[1:16:52] You're going to have to have a payback
[1:16:54] plan.
[1:16:58] There's a certain paying back. That's
[1:17:00] not the truth. That's a Catholic
[1:17:02] religion. Right. Luther was troubled by
[1:17:04] his sins and and Luther was a
[1:17:06] professional at doing penance all those
[1:17:09] years just doing trying to work his way
[1:17:11] to get some peace and place of
[1:17:13] acceptance with God and finally found
[1:17:15] out the just shall live by faith. This
[1:17:18] is his righteousness. This is not my
[1:17:19] righteousness. And he come to that
[1:17:21] revelation. It's the devil's religion to
[1:17:24] make you do penance for what you've done
[1:17:26] wrong.
[1:17:27] What is it? To keep you from the
[1:17:29] powerful prayer. to keep you from being
[1:17:32] one that sees you with the rights of
[1:17:35] Calvary.
[1:17:37] To bring your petition before the Lord
[1:17:40] and to have him hear it. And to have him
[1:17:43] answer.
[1:17:45] Is this okay with everybody tonight?
[1:17:49] You know, debts work different with God.
[1:17:53] Satan
[1:17:55] Satan twists God's forgiveness and
[1:17:58] twists justification and mixes it all
[1:18:01] with a repayment plan for debt with
[1:18:05] interest.
[1:18:07] It's the world's way to have debt and
[1:18:09] have interest on the debt. That's the
[1:18:10] world's way. And that's Satan's
[1:18:12] religion, too. I can put you on a
[1:18:14] repayment plan. We can get you set up. I
[1:18:16] know you can't afford any of this to pay
[1:18:19] back your sin, but we can set you up.
[1:18:21] It'll be with interest. you'll probably
[1:18:23] be paying the rest of your
[1:18:25] life. Sister Joanie, my dad used to talk
[1:18:28] about I said, you know, how did they buy
[1:18:31] that? He said it was a layaway plan. You
[1:18:34] pay for it till they lay you away.
[1:18:38] That's Satan's plan. That's Satan's
[1:18:41] plan. You do penance. Listen, this this
[1:18:44] gospel religion is not doing penance.
[1:18:47] It's not paying back. He paid for my
[1:18:50] sins.
[1:18:51] He paid for my mistakes. Can you say
[1:18:53] amen? Debt and interest is slavery
[1:18:56] according to the Bible. It lingers for
[1:18:58] years. Satan don't want you to feel you
[1:19:00] have the rights. The right to pray, the
[1:19:02] right to be happy. God don't offer a
[1:19:04] penance plan to set up you a pay plan
[1:19:06] for years. He pays it all. He pays it in
[1:19:09] full. Can you say amen? When you when a
[1:19:11] heart ask in sincerity, it's forgiven
[1:19:14] instantly. It's paid in full. Can you
[1:19:16] say amen? I remember that time when my
[1:19:18] wife my wife got sick and my daughter
[1:19:21] she was only two weeks old my first my
[1:19:23] first child and my wife got salmonillaa
[1:19:25] from a Mexican restaurant and then she
[1:19:28] passed it to my daughter I was standing
[1:19:29] in the hospital in Sylvania Ohio there
[1:19:32] and I was upstairs I was crying and
[1:19:34] praying in the bathroom cuz I realized
[1:19:36] my daughter was down in emergency about
[1:19:38] ready to die my wife was up in a room
[1:19:40] about ready to die I said I feel like
[1:19:42] your prophet he lost his daughter and
[1:19:44] his wife I said Lord if you take him I I
[1:19:46] don't know But oh God, intervene for
[1:19:48] him. My mother-in-law was down in the
[1:19:50] emergency room and she seen the the the
[1:19:53] level there go straight where my
[1:19:54] daughter quit breathing. And my mother
[1:19:56] being my mother-in-law being a woman of
[1:19:58] faith, she said, "I rebuke you, Satan,
[1:20:00] in the name of Jesus Christ." And that
[1:20:02] level went up. She started breathing
[1:20:03] again. She's still alive today. She'd be
[1:20:05] 30 years old. And then we went up. We
[1:20:07] prayed and my wife come out of it as
[1:20:09] well. When we were all finished with
[1:20:11] that, the restaurant come back in the
[1:20:14] entrance. They proved that seminar came
[1:20:15] from the restaurant. So, they come to
[1:20:17] help pay for our medical bills. They
[1:20:19] came to our house, $30,000 in medical
[1:20:21] bills. We didn't have any money like
[1:20:22] that then. Uh I don't think we have it
[1:20:25] now, but anyway, we didn't have any any
[1:20:27] money. And and so, you know, uh 30,000.
[1:20:32] And so, he said, "We're taking care of
[1:20:33] all the medical bills. We're we're
[1:20:35] taking care, but what do you want is a
[1:20:37] settlement. We want to write you a check
[1:20:39] for a settlement." You know, in these
[1:20:40] days, people sue for millions of dollars
[1:20:42] or something like this. I could have
[1:20:44] lost my wife's life and they you know
[1:20:47] and you know we were young and naive and
[1:20:48] I just said well you don't have to give
[1:20:50] us nothing sir you know we're we're fine
[1:20:52] if you took care of the medical bills
[1:20:53] we're fine with it you know no we we
[1:20:55] want to give you something and he kept
[1:20:57] asking us I said I don't know what to
[1:20:59] ask for you know and uh he said well all
[1:21:02] right uh how does $18,000 sound and I
[1:21:05] said yeah sure and so and then while
[1:21:08] he's writing the check my wife she's
[1:21:10] kind of nodding to me looking at
[1:21:13] And then later we talked about it. We
[1:21:15] had some debt when we come into the
[1:21:17] marriage. And that amount that that
[1:21:19] check was written for was the exact
[1:21:22] amount to the penny of all of our debt.
[1:21:28] Paid paid in full. Paid in full.
[1:21:32] And that's how our Lord does it,
[1:21:34] friends. It's not a payment plan for
[1:21:36] your sins. It's paid in full. At
[1:21:40] Calvary, it was paid in full.
[1:21:43] Hallelujah.
[1:21:46] Blessed be his name.
[1:21:48] [Applause]
[1:21:50] Look at what brother Brandham said here
[1:21:52] about our rights. He's always trying to
[1:21:53] take the devil's always trying to take
[1:21:54] us and we don't have a right to pray. We
[1:21:56] don't have a right to these things.
[1:21:58] Brother Brandham said in 1962, "I'm an
[1:22:00] heir of divine healing. I'm an heir of
[1:22:02] joy. I've got a right to be happy." So
[1:22:05] what makes you so happy? I've got a
[1:22:07] right to be. What a way to say it.
[1:22:10] What makes you so happy? Well, you can
[1:22:12] say, "Well, because of this. Because of
[1:22:14] No, I've got a right to be happy. I
[1:22:17] don't need a reason to be happy. I've
[1:22:19] got a right to be." How do you know?
[1:22:22] Because I'm an heir to an
[1:22:24] Amen. But I say now I feel religious.
[1:22:28] Yes. I'm an heir to happiness. I'm an
[1:22:30] heir to joy. I'm an air to peace. I'm an
[1:22:33] heir to eternal life. I'm an heir to the
[1:22:36] Holy Spirit. I'm an heir to every
[1:22:38] evidence that it's God. Amen. I'm an
[1:22:40] heir to the authority of God. Who made
[1:22:43] you that? Not me. He did. Every one of
[1:22:46] you is an heir to the same thing. You're
[1:22:49] an heir to the throne. He that
[1:22:51] overcomemeth shall sit with me on my
[1:22:52] throne as I have overcome and sit on my
[1:22:55] father in his throne. Amen. An heir of
[1:22:57] all things. I'm a sinner. I'm a sinner,
[1:23:00] brother Brandham. Well, uh, you don't
[1:23:02] have to be. You're a sinner because you
[1:23:04] desire to be. You don't have to be. The
[1:23:06] debt's already paid. Brother Rome, I
[1:23:08] wish I had joy. You can have it. You're
[1:23:11] just letting Satan rob you from the
[1:23:15] privileges that Christ died for. I'm an
[1:23:18] heir to it. It's all mine. Everything he
[1:23:21] died for belongs to me. Can you say that
[1:23:23] with me tonight? Everything he died for
[1:23:26] belongs to me.
[1:23:28] [Music]
[1:23:31] Don't like to hear this. I want you to
[1:23:32] say everything he died for. Everything
[1:23:34] he died for belongs to me.
[1:23:38] So, no, that's just for some of that's
[1:23:40] just for the important preachers in the
[1:23:42] message.
[1:23:44] Some of that's just for the really holy
[1:23:46] ones in the congregation. And no, no,
[1:23:48] no, no, no, no. This isn't an outward
[1:23:50] holiness. No way. Praise the Lord.
[1:23:54] Everything he died for belongs to me.
[1:23:57] I'm an heir of it. Were his children
[1:24:00] were heirs of it. Everything that he
[1:24:03] died for belongs to me. Thank you,
[1:24:06] Jesus. Brothers and sisters, you have a
[1:24:09] right to pray tonight.
[1:24:12] You have authority to pray with.
[1:24:16] Thank you, Jesus. Brothers and sisters,
[1:24:18] you have a direct line to God.
[1:24:21] No matter what the devil has told you,
[1:24:25] a believer has access to the father.
[1:24:27] Sons have access to the father just like
[1:24:29] Jesus did. Yeah. And here in our my
[1:24:32] text, it's sons of God that's saying to
[1:24:35] after Jesus prayed, they said, "Lord,
[1:24:39] teach us to pray." That's my subject
[1:24:41] tonight. I'm going try to find a place
[1:24:43] down here to close.
[1:24:45] Lord, sons of God are asking, not the
[1:24:48] Pharisees. Yes. Lord, teach us to pray.
[1:24:53] They could have asked a lot of things
[1:24:55] from the Lord. Lord, teach us how to do
[1:24:57] miracles.
[1:24:58] Right. Amen. Yeah. Lord, teach us how to
[1:25:02] have some signs in our lives.
[1:25:06] We want to do some of those other things
[1:25:08] you're doing, Jesus. But that's the only
[1:25:10] place in scripture we what they're
[1:25:12] asking. They want to do it like him.
[1:25:15] Teach us to pray. And I would add it to
[1:25:17] this that Lord, teach us to pray like
[1:25:20] you pray.
[1:25:22] Why are they asking that? because his
[1:25:25] prayers were getting through
[1:25:28] and they watched it for three and a half
[1:25:30] years that what he said to the father
[1:25:33] made it through.
[1:25:36] And the thing about sons and daughters
[1:25:37] of God, friends, is sons and daughters
[1:25:40] of God, they know that whatever Christ
[1:25:44] came to,
[1:25:46] he said that where I am, ye may be also.
[1:25:50] Amen.
[1:25:51] He said things that like
[1:25:55] uh the works that I do shall you do
[1:25:59] also, but greater works shall you do.
[1:26:02] He keeps, you know, it's like brother
[1:26:04] Brandon early on when he talked about
[1:26:06] the new ministry, the third pole, he
[1:26:08] says it's handing it back to the people
[1:26:10] again. It's not sitting and watching a
[1:26:12] prophet. It's not sitting and watching
[1:26:15] Jesus. He says it hands it back into the
[1:26:17] hands of the people again. And sons know
[1:26:20] that they're coming to the same thing
[1:26:22] that Christ came to. So no wonder
[1:26:25] they're saying, "Lord, teach us to pray
[1:26:27] like that.
[1:26:30] Whatever faith that you have, I can come
[1:26:32] into as well. Perfect faith. Thank you,
[1:26:36] Lord. Teach me how to pray like that."
[1:26:39] And I just tell you friends, I'm I'm not
[1:26:42] all there tonight. I'm not all where
[1:26:45] where I'd like to be. I need Jesus. I
[1:26:49] rejoice that uh you know there was a
[1:26:53] family a few weeks ago
[1:26:56] uh and this happens uh
[1:26:58] um I give glory to God. Amen. But you
[1:27:02] just pray you lay hands on somebody some
[1:27:04] dire
[1:27:05] needs and in my office prayed for a
[1:27:08] brother and and committed something and
[1:27:11] that at that moment it was done. That
[1:27:13] was it. Thank you. I give glory to God.
[1:27:16] Amen. But I'm still I'm still desiring
[1:27:20] to move in a place. I don't I'm not
[1:27:23] trying to be super spiritual. I'm trying
[1:27:26] to be supernatural.
[1:27:29] There's a big difference.
[1:27:31] This isn't super spiritual. This is
[1:27:32] supernatural. And this is supernatural.
[1:27:34] God working through us. I I long to see
[1:27:38] that prayer. Can you say amen? And sons
[1:27:40] that's asking the crowd was the crowd.
[1:27:43] You know, one time the crowd asked
[1:27:45] Jesus, "What can we do to do the works
[1:27:47] of God?" They're asking to do the works.
[1:27:50] They're asking to do whatever. Sign
[1:27:52] seekers, Pharisees, sign seekers. But
[1:27:55] this is teaching us to pray, not to
[1:27:57] reprieve a prayer, but we're sons. We
[1:27:59] want to be positioned like you, Jesus.
[1:28:01] We want to be in that place. We we we we
[1:28:05] when we're asking then God, it moves the
[1:28:07] heart of God. One reason they knew his
[1:28:10] prayers, they one reason they're asking
[1:28:12] to teach us to pray is that his prayers
[1:28:14] were moving God on the
[1:28:16] scene. They they they you know the thing
[1:28:20] is is that these were Jews. These were
[1:28:23] uh men of God here. These Jews and the
[1:28:25] Pharisees and different they were Jews.
[1:28:27] So when they said Lord teach us to pray,
[1:28:29] do you think these disciples weren't
[1:28:30] pray didn't pray? Jews pray. Yes. So why
[1:28:35] are they asking Jesus teach us to pray?
[1:28:38] because they wanted to pray like that.
[1:28:42] Jews pray. They pray, you know, and
[1:28:44] Sabbath day comes and and and Sabbat
[1:28:47] comes and they're there Friday and
[1:28:48] they're on their knees. They're praying.
[1:28:50] So these disciples did that. But they're
[1:28:52] not just discip They're not just Jews.
[1:28:55] They're sons of God. And they're saying,
[1:28:57] "I already pray, but I don't have that
[1:29:00] kind of prayer."
[1:29:03] Jesus. Amen. Teach us. You know, sons of
[1:29:07] God are teachable.
[1:29:09] Yes, that's true. Sons of God are
[1:29:12] correctable. That's true. Amen. Yes.
[1:29:15] Sons that are moving to adoption are
[1:29:17] teachable and correctable. Sons that are
[1:29:19] not are not teachable. They stay
[1:29:22] immature. That's right. But sons moving
[1:29:25] to adoption, they have to be corrected.
[1:29:28] Where Abraham says he comes back and
[1:29:30] reports to the father. Oh, your son,
[1:29:32] he's being rebellious. He won't listen.
[1:29:34] He wants to stay as a child. But the
[1:29:35] ones that's going to get the adoption is
[1:29:37] is dad is he says the father said, "I'm
[1:29:40] proud of your boy. He's obeying. I'm
[1:29:43] proud of that daughter cuz she's lining
[1:29:44] right up with the word."
[1:29:47] Adoption is based upon behavior. It's
[1:29:50] not based upon uh trying to uh make
[1:29:53] ourselves something. It's based upon
[1:29:54] behavior and growing into maturity.
[1:29:57] That's a whole another message. But
[1:29:58] adoption is is related to maturity.
[1:30:01] Mature sons are the ones that are moving
[1:30:03] to adoption. And because they they are
[1:30:06] because they're teachable, they're
[1:30:08] correctable. Others other followers stay
[1:30:11] babies. Pentecostal babies. And brother
[1:30:14] Bam says you can't
[1:30:17] teach Pentecostal babies supernatural
[1:30:20] things.
[1:30:23] Right. It says it all. What are they?
[1:30:27] They're they're they're Christians, but
[1:30:28] they're babies. Yeah. And you can't
[1:30:31] teach babies supernatural things. Amen.
[1:30:35] Yes, sir.
[1:30:37] The disciples could see that he was the
[1:30:38] son of
[1:30:40] God. Praise the Lord. Oh, there's just
[1:30:42] so much here. I have to let me just move
[1:30:45] on to find a place here. They seen
[1:30:47] authority in his
[1:30:49] prayer. And so that's why they said,
[1:30:51] "Lord, teach us to pray." I trust you
[1:30:52] leave here saying that tonight.
[1:30:55] We've seen it in the prophet. We see it
[1:30:57] in other brothers, other sisters. But
[1:31:00] it's he that it's in you. Lord, teach me
[1:31:02] to pray. Amen. Give me perfect faith to
[1:31:04] pray cuz I'm going to hit some spots in
[1:31:07] my life. What? I don't have any other
[1:31:08] answers. I can't depend on the
[1:31:10] government. I can't depend on any. I'm
[1:31:12] going to have to have my prayer getting
[1:31:14] through to God. When I speak in front of
[1:31:16] my children, when I speak in front of my
[1:31:18] family, when I speak in front of my
[1:31:20] church, I'm going to have to know that
[1:31:22] there's no hindrances. There's nothing
[1:31:24] in the way. There's nothing the devil's
[1:31:27] beating over my head. There's not guilt.
[1:31:29] You feel unworthy. I'm going to have to
[1:31:31] get over that thing of feeling unworthy
[1:31:32] to pray. We're going to need to feel No.
[1:31:34] No. I've got a right to pray. Glory.
[1:31:37] I've got a right to pray. I've got the
[1:31:38] authority to pray. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:31:43] Thank you, Jesus Christ. I'm going to
[1:31:46] I'm going to end tonight on a a man in
[1:31:48] the Bible that I love to talk about. And
[1:31:51] I don't know why I do, but I I just the
[1:31:54] more I look at his life, which is a very
[1:31:56] short section in the Bible in uh the
[1:32:00] book of Jonah. Jonah is a strange
[1:32:04] bird. His life actually ends very
[1:32:08] strange and uh it's always a mystery to
[1:32:11] me. And yet he's a son of God. Uh he got
[1:32:15] a whole b book in the Bible wrote about
[1:32:17] him and his life, his biography. But
[1:32:20] it's strange. It's different. And
[1:32:22] brother Brandon elaborated on running
[1:32:24] from the presence of the Lord. And uh
[1:32:26] I've been pretty hard when I preached
[1:32:27] through the last few years on Jonah.
[1:32:29] I've been pretty pretty hard on him. Uh
[1:32:32] pretty critical of him. But at the same
[1:32:35] time, and I might have to apologize
[1:32:36] someday to
[1:32:37] him, but you know, even called and
[1:32:39] backsliding. And then you read where
[1:32:41] Abraham says, "No, don't call him
[1:32:42] backsliding. No, he was just running
[1:32:44] from the presence of the Lord.
[1:32:47] He's a he wasn't a backsliden prophet."
[1:32:49] Abraham said that early on, but later he
[1:32:51] corrected. He says, "No, he wasn't." And
[1:32:53] uh but he was and even rebellion is a
[1:32:56] strong word because he's just running
[1:32:58] from his commission. He's running from
[1:33:00] what God called him to do. And so we
[1:33:02] must realize first, Brother Bram says,
[1:33:04] "Can I have about 10 more minutes here?"
[1:33:07] There's there's no clock in this old
[1:33:08] church.
[1:33:10] That's a bad thing tonight. No clock.
[1:33:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:17] So, you know, the first thing Brother
[1:33:19] says is that no, no, he wasn't
[1:33:20] backsliding. And then, Brother Bam says,
[1:33:23] Jonah is an example of us all. So,
[1:33:26] there's no sense in being critical of
[1:33:28] him cuz he's an example of all of you
[1:33:31] and me.
[1:33:33] So, boy, it gets pretty powerful when
[1:33:35] you go to read because you realize, wow,
[1:33:36] yeah, you pull out the characteristics.
[1:33:38] And so I'd like you to turn to Jonah.
[1:33:40] We're just going to read the second
[1:33:41] chapter because we find the first
[1:33:43] chapter is what gets preached on a lot.
[1:33:45] And we uh we realize that that's where
[1:33:48] he got a commission. He he's supposed to
[1:33:51] go to Nineveh and preach and then he got
[1:33:54] on another ship to Tarsus. And then we
[1:33:56] find that, you know, uh he he uh God
[1:34:00] swallowed. He got kicked off the he told
[1:34:02] him, "Kick me off the I'm the problem.
[1:34:05] Kick me off the ship." and they kicked
[1:34:07] him off the boat. And so then uh a great
[1:34:12] fish swallowed him up. That's all in
[1:34:14] chapter one. That's the first chapter of
[1:34:16] the biography is life. It's not too
[1:34:18] good. He's running from the Lord and
[1:34:19] he's swallowed up by a big fish and he's
[1:34:22] in this fish. Jonah was in the belly of
[1:34:25] the fish three days and three nights.
[1:34:26] You know, it's amazing. We can be
[1:34:28] critical of Jonah and his life, but his
[1:34:30] biography
[1:34:32] actually speaks of the resurrection of
[1:34:35] Christ, right? Amen. What What is this?
[1:34:38] Wednesday after Palm Sunday and Jonah's
[1:34:41] life speaks of him going in the ground,
[1:34:43] Jesus Christ, and raising the third day.
[1:34:45] So he's his whole life is going to
[1:34:47] testify of Christ. Praise the Lord.
[1:34:50] Amen.
[1:34:51] So then verse 17 and verse chapter 1,
[1:34:54] the Lord prepared a great fish to
[1:34:57] swallow up Jonah and Jonah was in the
[1:34:58] belly of the fish three days. Chapter 2,
[1:35:01] then Jonah
[1:35:02] prayed unto the Lord his God. Out of the
[1:35:06] fish's belly, and said, I cried by
[1:35:08] reason of my affliction unto the Lord,
[1:35:11] and he heard me. Out of the belly of
[1:35:13] hell cried I, and thou heardest my
[1:35:16] voice. So now we could safely say at the
[1:35:21] beginning of this that he if we're
[1:35:23] looking through the devil's eyes, he
[1:35:24] didn't deserve to pray.
[1:35:28] He ran from his commission.
[1:35:32] And yet something rose in Jonah. And and
[1:35:34] trust me, he didn't really have any
[1:35:37] other option.
[1:35:40] There were no options. Can you say amen?
[1:35:43] And so what did he do? He prayed. and he
[1:35:46] didn't feel worthy to pray because he
[1:35:47] knew he just ran from the commission.
[1:35:49] Almost caused a shipwreck all messed up
[1:35:52] and just running from God. And yet yet
[1:35:55] he finds it within his life. He prayed
[1:35:57] unto the Lord and said, "I cried by
[1:35:59] reason of my afflictions of the Lord and
[1:36:01] he heard me. Out of the belly of the
[1:36:03] hell cried I, and thou heardest my
[1:36:05] voice, for thou hast cast me into the
[1:36:08] deep, into the midst of the seas, and
[1:36:10] the floods compass me about. All thy
[1:36:12] bills, and thy waves pass over me." Then
[1:36:14] I said, "I am cast out of thy sight, yet
[1:36:17] I will look again toward thy holy
[1:36:21] temple." With all of his guilt, with all
[1:36:23] of his condemnation, with all of his
[1:36:26] unworthiness that he felt, he got a hold
[1:36:29] of a promise from Solomon. Can you say
[1:36:31] amen? Solomon says, "If your people are
[1:36:34] in trouble, if they're in another land,
[1:36:37] if they're in famine, if they're
[1:36:39] backslid, God, if they turn to you and
[1:36:42] turn to your temple, will you hear their
[1:36:44] prayer?" And God says, "I'll hear their
[1:36:47] prayer, no matter where they're at, no
[1:36:49] matter how low they are,
[1:36:53] if they turn towards my temple,
[1:36:57] I'll hear my children's cry even though
[1:37:00] they don't deserve it. Jesus
[1:37:03] latched on to that promise and said that
[1:37:06] promise is for me even though I'm away
[1:37:09] from God promise for me cuz I'm a son of
[1:37:11] God.
[1:37:13] Friends, I'll tell you we need to tell
[1:37:15] the devil
[1:37:17] to to get out sometimes
[1:37:20] and just say, "I know I've made my
[1:37:22] mistakes,
[1:37:24] but you're not going to let me badger.
[1:37:26] You're not going to badger me about it.
[1:37:28] I've got a right to pray. I've got a
[1:37:30] right to come on. Hallelujah. I think of
[1:37:33] I think of Esther, a scared little girl,
[1:37:37] but what happened? She was positioned
[1:37:41] to request something before the king.
[1:37:44] Scared to death. 15, 16 year old girl. I
[1:37:46] don't know how old she was, but now she
[1:37:48] they pray. They fast. And she gets the
[1:37:50] courage within her to go against the
[1:37:52] law. It says nobody approaches without
[1:37:55] being asked.
[1:37:56] Something in her says, "But I'm the
[1:37:58] queen. Thank you, Jesus. I'm a daughter
[1:38:00] of God.
[1:38:03] She just she just steps out into that
[1:38:06] little did the courtyard and the king
[1:38:08] recognizes she just just kind of sitting
[1:38:11] there and the king he holds out his
[1:38:13] scepter which is a powerful thing. She
[1:38:17] steps up into there and he holds out his
[1:38:19] scepter. And when a king holds his
[1:38:21] scepter, that represents all the power
[1:38:23] of the king. If he holds it out to you
[1:38:25] and you touch it, you have all the power
[1:38:26] of the king.
[1:38:28] [Music]
[1:38:30] What does my queen want you?
[1:38:35] There has to be some courage in us
[1:38:38] to rise above our mistakes and rise
[1:38:40] above our past and rise above our fears
[1:38:43] and rise above our thoughts and rise
[1:38:46] above our emotions being up and down and
[1:38:48] say all that's laid aside. I'm a son and
[1:38:51] daughter of God. I bring everything
[1:38:53] under the blood and I'm bringing this
[1:38:55] petition before you. Amen. What does my
[1:38:58] queen want? Oh, I I'm asking you and
[1:39:02] Hmon to come to dinner. Yeah. And the
[1:39:05] king says, "That's it. That's it.
[1:39:10] Okay. Hmon, can you go to Okay, we're
[1:39:13] going to go to dinner. They come to
[1:39:14] dinner. She's still The Bible show The
[1:39:17] Bible's so real cuz it shows she didn't
[1:39:19] tell him the first dinner cuz she was
[1:39:21] just still She's got the human side.
[1:39:24] She's intimidated by Hmon, her enemy,
[1:39:27] like we are sometimes.
[1:39:31] King says, "What do you want up to the
[1:39:33] half of my kingdom? Please tell me what
[1:39:36] do you want, my queen?" She said, "Uh
[1:39:40] uh, it's like right a little bit.
[1:39:44] What do I,
[1:39:46] what do you want after the uh uh I was
[1:39:49] just wondering if you could come to
[1:39:51] dinner tomorrow night.
[1:39:56] [Applause]
[1:39:57] It shows that Hmon was intimidating her.
[1:40:00] It took her a while to get some courage.
[1:40:03] It took her a couple nights to get more
[1:40:05] courage to ask the king. She had a right
[1:40:09] to, but she had to get the courage to.
[1:40:11] Anybody listening to me tonight? You
[1:40:14] have a right to, but you got to get the
[1:40:15] courage to.
[1:40:19] Next night, you know what she did? She
[1:40:21] got the courage and she
[1:40:26] exposed her enemy in the presence of the
[1:40:30] king.
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:32] Hallelujah.
[1:40:36] You don't let the enemy hide. You take
[1:40:37] it right here. He is. I'm exposing him.
[1:40:40] I'm telling what he is in the presence
[1:40:42] of my king. And guess what? She didn't
[1:40:44] have to take care of him. Her king took
[1:40:47] care of him.
[1:40:49] Glory.
[1:40:51] [Applause]
[1:40:54] Oh boy. Okay. I I have I have a clock
[1:40:58] here on my iPad. Thank you, Jesus. It's
[1:41:01] not working. Okay.
[1:41:04] It's not working.
[1:41:06] Jesus, for thou verse three, thou has c.
[1:41:09] Okay. No more. Verse four. Then I said,
[1:41:11] I cast out by sight, yet I will look
[1:41:14] again toward that holy temple. This is
[1:41:16] what brother said in perfect faith. You
[1:41:18] have to be in a position for perfect
[1:41:20] faith.
[1:41:21] The reason Jesus had perfect faith
[1:41:23] because he knew his position in the
[1:41:25] word. And what did Jonah do? He
[1:41:27] positioned himself towards the temple.
[1:41:30] Now, how did he do that in a in a fish?
[1:41:33] I really don't know.
[1:41:35] But I believe it was a supernatural GPS.
[1:41:39] It was a supernatural GPS.
[1:41:42] God's GPS was there before we go in our
[1:41:45] car. It was a somehow by revelation he
[1:41:49] found the direction towards the temple
[1:41:52] and he bowed down in the he said he had
[1:41:55] things all around his face and
[1:41:57] everything and he bowed before the
[1:41:59] temple and he asked God to deliver him.
[1:42:09] The waters verse 5 can pass me about
[1:42:11] even to the soul. The depth closed me
[1:42:13] around about. The weeds were wrapped
[1:42:15] around my
[1:42:16] head. I went down to the bottoms of the
[1:42:19] mountains. The earth with her bars was
[1:42:21] about me forever. Yet hast thou brought
[1:42:23] me up from life, from corruption. Oh my
[1:42:25] Lord, when my soul faded within me, I
[1:42:27] remember the Lord and my prayer came
[1:42:30] into unto thee into thy holy temple. Did
[1:42:32] you hear what he just said? His prayer
[1:42:36] somehow he couldn't get out, but his
[1:42:38] prayer made it out of that fish into the
[1:42:43] presence of God.
[1:42:45] Brothers and sisters, when you can't get
[1:42:48] out of something, your prayer can.
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:55] I don't know how I'm going to get out of
[1:42:56] this, but I trust God my prayer is going
[1:42:58] to get me out. Prayer got out before he
[1:43:01] got out.
[1:43:03] Yeah. Glory be to God. I'm going to put
[1:43:05] that one on my refrigerator. That's a
[1:43:08] refrigerator quote.
[1:43:11] Thank you, Jesus. Jonah's prayer got out
[1:43:13] before he got out.
[1:43:16] That's a powerful prayer.
[1:43:19] How many remember Daniel praying for 21
[1:43:21] days? Yes, sir. He said, "Lord, why is
[1:43:25] he answered? I'm fasting. I'm praying
[1:43:27] all this time." Finally, the angel makes
[1:43:29] it to him after 21 days. He said,
[1:43:32] "Daniel, I heard you the first day. It
[1:43:35] made it through to my presence, but I've
[1:43:37] been fighting through demons to get to
[1:43:39] answer to you." You don't think that can
[1:43:42] happen again?
[1:43:43] The prince of Persia was fighting me the
[1:43:46] whole time, but I heard you the first
[1:43:49] time you prayed.
[1:43:51] [Music]
[1:43:54] Y'all are making me feel too comfortable
[1:43:56] here tonight. I can tell you that. We
[1:43:58] got to finish this prayer and then I'm
[1:44:00] closing. when he when my soul notice now
[1:44:04] uh my prayer came into thy holy temple
[1:44:06] verse 8 and they that observe lying
[1:44:08] vanities forsake their own mercy he
[1:44:10] called all that seaweed and everything
[1:44:12] lying vanities and anybody who looks at
[1:44:14] the symptoms there's only one way to
[1:44:17] look at them lying vanities
[1:44:20] when you do it you forsake his mercy
[1:44:22] because his mercy is greater than your
[1:44:24] symptoms
[1:44:26] his mercy is greater than your problems
[1:44:30] Lord His mercy is greater. Oh my
[1:44:33] friends, his mercy is greater than your
[1:44:35] rebellion.
[1:44:38] His mercy is greater than your mistakes.
[1:44:41] His covenant is stronger than your past
[1:44:44] mistakes.
[1:44:47] But I will sacrifice unto thee the voice
[1:44:49] of thanksgiving. I will pay that I have
[1:44:51] vowed. Salvation is of the Lord. And the
[1:44:54] Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited
[1:44:57] out Jonah upon the dry land. I encourage
[1:45:00] you to read the rest. He goes to
[1:45:02] Nineveh, but then the chapter 4 is the
[1:45:04] most mysterious part of Jonah. He he
[1:45:07] gets he he gets angry. He gets suicidal.
[1:45:11] He's a
[1:45:13] mess. He's mentally messed up.
[1:45:17] He is. Read it.
[1:45:19] God's trying to teach this son
[1:45:21] something. And and and to me, if I was
[1:45:25] running the show, I would have fired
[1:45:27] this guy
[1:45:29] and got someone else like
[1:45:31] ziprecruiter.com,
[1:45:34] hire.com. I would have this guy's
[1:45:37] finished. Like the disciples sometimes
[1:45:39] after the resurrection,
[1:45:41] you're finished. We'll get some other
[1:45:43] disciples. But he couldn't he couldn't
[1:45:46] fire Jonah.
[1:45:49] because his name's on the book.
[1:45:54] His name is on the book. It's Jonah.
[1:45:57] It's not Bob. It's not Suzy. It's Jonah.
[1:46:01] So, if your name is on the book, God is
[1:46:04] going to keep dealing with your heart.
[1:46:07] God is going to keep forgiving you of
[1:46:09] your sins. God is going to hear your
[1:46:12] prayer.
[1:46:13] Because your name, not because you
[1:46:16] deserve it, but your name is on the
[1:46:18] book.
[1:46:21] Blessed be the name of the Lord. His
[1:46:25] prayer got through before he got
[1:46:28] through. And he didn't deserve to pray,
[1:46:31] but he positioned himself right. And
[1:46:34] when he positioned
[1:46:36] himself,
[1:46:38] God came on the scene and spoke to a
[1:46:42] fish.
[1:46:45] Great. Hallelujah.
[1:46:47] Directing a fish, directing squirrels.
[1:46:51] Directing the storm.
[1:46:53] Amen. Amen. The power of the spoken
[1:46:56] word. God will move the whole world if
[1:46:58] he has to. Yes, sir. For a son and
[1:47:00] daughter of God.
[1:47:03] Yes. Amen. When Adam and Eve
[1:47:08] fell, you
[1:47:11] know, before Adam and Eve were around,
[1:47:14] Lucifer influenced a third of the
[1:47:17] angels.
[1:47:19] And there's no word that God did
[1:47:20] anything about it. No. No.
[1:47:24] But one
[1:47:25] son fell and he's running to the garden
[1:47:30] and saying, "Adam, where are you?
[1:47:36] never did it for the angels, but a son,
[1:47:39] a daughter,
[1:47:40] he's running. He Adam was hiding. God
[1:47:43] went and found him where he was hiding.
[1:47:45] How many times in your life you're
[1:47:47] hiding from God because of your guilt
[1:47:49] and condemnation. And it's God that
[1:47:51] comes to you.
[1:47:54] Where, Adam, where are you? Amen.
[1:47:58] We're over here. And we're we're naked.
[1:48:02] Who told you you were naked? Who's lied
[1:48:04] to you? God knew all this, but he was
[1:48:06] asking.
[1:48:09] What do you do in hiding? You're my son.
[1:48:12] And right there in redemption, he's
[1:48:14] pulling them out of their hiding. He
[1:48:16] didn't have to do that. I tell you, it's
[1:48:18] God rich in mercy.
[1:48:22] God rich in mercy.
[1:48:25] Said, "Come out here and stand before me
[1:48:27] and take these skins and throw those
[1:48:29] over your nakedness. You don't need
[1:48:31] those fig leaves. Religion. Here's my
[1:48:34] skins. Blood. Can you say amen? Throw
[1:48:37] these clothes on you. Come out here and
[1:48:39] talk to me. I want fellowship with you.
[1:48:43] God, look what we've done. We just feel
[1:48:45] shame. We don't feel a right to even
[1:48:47] speak to you. We used to talk with you
[1:48:48] in the cool of the evening. We loved it.
[1:48:51] But we have sinned. We don't even feel
[1:48:53] worthy to come. Come out here. I want to
[1:48:55] establish fellowship again with you.
[1:48:58] I want to talk to you. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:49:04] I feel his pray. I want you to just lift
[1:49:06] your hands here tonight.
[1:49:08] Thank you, Jesus. My God, do you love me
[1:49:11] that much?
[1:49:14] Do you love me that much, Lord, that you
[1:49:17] come and find? How many raise your hand
[1:49:19] and say, "He come and found me when I
[1:49:20] was hiding." You might be hiding
[1:49:22] tonight. He's going to come and find
[1:49:24] you. A third of the angels fell and God
[1:49:27] never went to get him. But one son falls
[1:49:29] and he's running and saying, "Where are
[1:49:32] you? I want you to come back to me. I
[1:49:36] want to fellowship with you."
[1:49:38] Hallelujah. Our heavenly father, we
[1:49:40] raise our hands tonight. Because we feel
[1:49:43] your grace is just overwhelming to us,
[1:49:46] Lord. It's a God rich in mercy. Not just
[1:49:49] mercy, but rich in mercy. And we needed
[1:49:52] a God like that. We need it today.
[1:49:55] This is the time of trouble when hearts
[1:49:58] and emotions and minds and thoughts are
[1:50:01] up and down and so messed up by the
[1:50:04] enemy. We need your grace. We need a God
[1:50:08] rich in mercy. Lord, we call on you
[1:50:11] tonight to help us, strengthen us, and
[1:50:14] most of all, Lord, teach us how to pray.
[1:50:17] Teach us to pray the prayer of faith.
[1:50:19] Lord, teach us to stand as sons and
[1:50:22] daughters of God in our position in the
[1:50:24] place that you've called us. Lord, help
[1:50:26] us not to knuckle down to the enemy's
[1:50:28] threats and unworthiness and
[1:50:31] condemnation. Lord, we bring everything
[1:50:33] under the blood. May we stand boldly
[1:50:35] before your throne with the authority of
[1:50:37] God and ask what we will. Would a father
[1:50:41] turn away a son who's asking for bread?
[1:50:44] No. And the heavenly father, will he
[1:50:46] turn anybody away? Any son that's asking
[1:50:50] for the Holy Spirit. He will not turn
[1:50:53] them away. Ask and it shall begin. Seek
[1:50:57] and you shall find. Knock and the door
[1:51:00] shall be open unto you. Thank you,
[1:51:03] Father. We love you, Lord. Bless the
[1:51:06] people. Bless the congregation, Lord.
[1:51:10] Bless the pastor, Lord. And may you fill
[1:51:14] these lives with a refreshing in the
[1:51:17] Holy Ghost. I pray Lord may this times
[1:51:20] of refreshing come. We commit it to you
[1:51:24] in Jesus name. Amen. Sister could you
[1:51:27] play Mercy rewrote my life. I should
[1:51:30] have fallen. My soul cast down. Can we
[1:51:33] lift our hands and stand and sing it
[1:51:35] tonight? Mercy rewrote my life. I should
[1:51:38] have fallen. Thank you Jesus. My soul
[1:51:43] cast
[1:51:44] down but mercy rewoke my life. I tell
[1:51:49] you friends, it's a time to rejoice.
[1:51:51] It's the time to thanks. Have
