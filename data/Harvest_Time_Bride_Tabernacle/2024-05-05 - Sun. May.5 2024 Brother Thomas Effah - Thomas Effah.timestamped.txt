[19:54] missionary from Ghana
[19:57] Africa and uh some of the summer times
[19:59] he'll travel to different churches and
[20:02] it was just uh really really wonderful
[20:05] also I I don't I don't think I mention
[20:06] it but there's many many fellowships up
[20:09] that are on the board and uh and that's
[20:12] one of the greatest Thrills we get being
[20:14] in the presence of God but being in the
[20:16] presence of God that's tabernacled in
[20:18] each other amen that's why it's in God's
[20:22] will for you to visit other places amen
[20:25] we're not an island to ourselves we're

[20:29] heaven it's not going to have Wyoming in
[20:30] heaven it's going to be Christ Mrs Jesus
[20:34] and and many many and and probably not

[20:40] be a part of the family of God and uh
[20:42] wonderful brothers and and Sisters in
[20:44] Christ amen and so we want to show you
[20:48] uh uh something just before we look at
[20:51] the word um that's very dear to me and I
[20:54] I I pray that you'll make it dear to you
[20:57] I I pray you'll just catch a little a
[20:59] little hair of the vision
[21:04] um um Pastor Jose is my
[21:08] friend and he is no no I want the
[21:11] building first sorry um well I mean we
[21:15] can show this actually you got it up
[21:16] there we'll just show this we'll show
[21:18] you how Satan works you know we
[21:19] recognize Satan very very clearly you
[21:21] know when you got the baptism of the
[21:23] Holy Ghost you can just recognize Satan
[21:25] everywhere you know that that God put or
[21:27] the sorry Satan postponed the plane uh
[21:30] brother Thomas walked in and ministered
[21:32] a powerful message right off the plane
[21:34] no food no no nothing and then uh
[21:38] somehow those two wonderful brothers
[21:40] decided to switch their bags last night
[21:44] and so about midnight when we were just
[21:47] about the last corner to turn into my
[21:49] house brother Jose said and he said I
[21:50] got your bag brother
[21:52] Thomas and brother Thomas when we got
[21:55] home we looked and he had brother Jose's
[21:57] bag and some reason those Brothers
[21:59] didn't think they wanted to share their
[22:01] notes for some reason so I got to bed
[22:04] about 1:00 last night and woke up about
[22:07] 5:30 this morning and we drove halfway
[22:09] back down to Kitchener to switch bags
[22:12] and I was telling brother Thomas I said
[22:13] you know you can just preach from the
[22:15] hip you don't need your Bible you don't
[22:16] need your notes just I mean it we have
[22:18] to Tabernacle site it it's all in here
[22:20] we just amen but he uh he thought it
[22:23] might be better if he had had a few
[22:26] things in front of him amen so we're
[22:29] just thrilled to to uh those are things
[22:32] that happen behind the scenes that you
[22:33] don't recognize but we look at the
[22:36] picture so brother Jose uh shared with
[22:38] us last night they had a a church
[22:40] building come up
[22:46] uh that's for sale and this one is
[22:51] unique because they put right oh I want
[22:54] to see the building first they put right
[22:57] in the real estate agent that we will
[23:01] and must sell to another flock of
[23:05] God that's that's super
[23:09] unique and uh you know brother Jose has
[23:13] pastored in Ontario for over 30
[23:16] years you know our Prophet said that he
[23:19] liked preaching in a place that was
[23:21] dedicated to God better than
[23:26] renting because the spirits of the
[23:28] renting place he had to deal with every
[23:32] time man now it's not that don't mean if
[23:34] you rent you're over the will of God
[23:36] like this building's going to burn when
[23:37] we go away but it's set aside for the
[23:43] bride and let's just keep that in our
[23:46] prayers and and I desire to to to Really
[23:51] they you know they they're in a place
[23:52] now and it and it works but they set up
[23:54] every service they they go there
[23:55] Saturday night they bring out everything
[23:58] they put it away in a room they come
[24:00] Sunday morning they that means they set
[24:02] up every chair every every every speaker
[24:05] every
[24:06] Pulpit we're very very blessed very very
[24:09] blessed
[24:10] now uh so let's just pray you know
[24:14] prices
[24:15] there are
[24:18] unbelievable but we know a God that owns
[24:21] everything he owns everything you know
[24:24] he he literally owns everything God can
[24:27] do everything
[24:29] you know you know you know uh yeah yeah
[24:33] God can do everything it's just a number
[24:36] it's not really money the money that we
[24:38] handle it's not worth nothing it's just
[24:40] paper just paper with ink on it God can
[24:44] do something let's just uh just pray for
[24:47] that that God will bless the little
[24:49] group there with a beautiful building

[34:05] Landmark this has been the strategy of
[34:09] the
[34:10] enemy anytime God set his Landmark his
[34:14] purpose is to remove
[34:17] it and if he's able to remove the lambar
[34:21] then he places man in an awkward
[34:24] position
[34:25] right that is his he he has never left
[34:29] that game he's always because it has
[34:32] paid off for
[34:33] him and he has settled with that
[34:38] strategy now in
[34:40] Ecclesiastes
[34:42] 10:8 he said he that dig a pit shall
[34:46] fall into it right and whosoever break a
[34:50] hedge a serpent shall bite
[34:56] him when you make a hedge when there is
[34:59] a line that is a fence that is
[35:02] protecting the church protecting God's
[35:04] children and you break that
[35:07] fence you are inviting in snakes you are
[35:11] inviting in

[1:11:10] First Corinthians chapter 1: 10 1
[1:11:13] Corinthians CH 1: 10 now I Beech you
[1:11:16] Brethren by the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:11:19] Christ that we all speak the same
[1:11:22] thing let us speak the same thing

[1:11:35] same
[1:11:37] judgment we may speak the same thing you

[1:12:32] Welling 12
[1:12:34] Stars said the 12 stars were Apostles
[1:12:37] the doctr of the
[1:12:42] Apostles so now what do we
[1:12:45] see the Bible

[1:12:53] bone and Flesh of My flesh she shall be
[1:12:56] called woman because she was taken out
[1:12:59] of man therefore shall a man leave his
[1:13:02] father and his mother and shall clave
[1:13:04] unto his wife and they shall be one
[1:13:08] flesh this is what God Said but today
[1:13:11] woman with woman man with man is that
[1:13:13] what the scripture
[1:13:15] said is that what the Bible
[1:13:19] said it is removing Lark the enemy is
[1:13:24] he's the his last Onslaught is to

[1:13:34] woman try to I want to be a
[1:13:39] man that is the last onslaught of the
[1:13:42] enemy we don't have time again on Earth
[1:13:45] how can you destroy the
[1:13:48] Lark how can you destroy God's purpose
[1:13:51] God's work the work his handw work what
[1:13:54] God has done what business have you got
[1:13:57] to destroy God's
[1:13:58] work yes sir that's right no
[1:14:03] true
[1:14:04] friends we are in a terrible
[1:14:09] time may God have
[1:14:13] mercy
[1:14:15] Jehovah
[1:14:18] 55222 550 0222 paragraph 9 the Holy
[1:14:23] Spirit overshadow Mary and she conceived
[1:14:26] and brought forth Jesus Christ the son
[1:14:28] of God the blood coming from the
[1:14:32] M was God's own blood and we and we are
[1:14:38] and and we are neither Jewish blood nor
[1:14:41] Gentile blood it was the blood from
[1:14:44] Emmanuel's veins so we are so thankful
[1:14:47] for that breaking down all the middle
[1:14:50] walls of ptis and bringing us into one
[1:14:53] lovely Fellowship
[1:14:56] amen Jesus Christ blood could do that
[1:14:59] that's the only blood sinless
[1:15:02] blood that could do that friends
[1:15:05] amen and that is why we have that
[1:15:08] assurance that absolute hope that we are
[1:15:12] being reconciled because this is the
[1:15:15] Lamb of God that takeen Away The Sins Of
[1:15:17] The World amen he
[1:15:20] is and if you have your name in the
[1:15:23] Lamb's Book of Life you recognize this
[1:15:28] Hallelujah that is why John stopped
[1:15:30] weeping right he stopped weeping when he
[1:15:33] saw his name yes redeemed he saw that my
[1:15:37] name is redeemed the price has been paid
[1:15:41] off he stopped weeping why weep my
[1:15:44] friend because you never saw your name
[1:15:48] but this morning I want to encourage you
[1:15:50] stretch your head and look into the L's
[1:15:52] Book of Life you will find your name and
[1:15:55] your name has already been
[1:15:57] redeemed
[1:16:02] hallu and then you stop you stop
[1:16:05] weeping when you see your name that your
[1:16:08] sickness you will not complain again
[1:16:10] when you find your name there right you
[1:16:13] know that all the Privileges of Calvary
[1:16:16] belongs to you yes amen is for
[1:16:22] you why are you drawing boundaries
[1:16:25] why is it that people are always
[1:16:27] interested to draw
[1:16:30] lines God made us one a
[1:16:35] family we are not to divide
[1:16:40] ourself that's why the problem said God
[1:16:43] divided himself sever so that we might
[1:16:46] be
[1:16:48] one God did not divide himself for us to
[1:16:50] be divided but he divided himself so
[1:16:53] that we might be one because this same
[1:16:56] tongue of fire that set on Peter is set
[1:16:58] on Thomas it set
[1:17:01] onomy and when they come together the FK
[1:17:04] of tongs comes together it makes the
[1:17:06] same Pillar of
[1:17:10] Fire why are we
[1:17:12] separated what is the problem with the
[1:17:15] church why are you becoming self
[1:17:23] self-centered in a in a deceived Church
[1:17:26] by the world this is 59 tape number 0628
[1:17:30] if you can put it paragraph
[1:17:32] 12 59 tape number 06 to8 parag 12 and
[1:17:37] that is the way it is with the church
[1:17:39] when the church followed rently and
[1:17:42] daily after the leading of the Holy
[1:17:44] Spirit God blessed
[1:17:46] them and miracles and signs and wonders
[1:17:49] follow the church but when it begin to
[1:17:52] keep Bad Company with the word
[1:17:56] one of the worst things is done and the
[1:17:58] first thing is done it begin to organize
[1:18:02] and breaking a fellowship among other
[1:18:04] believers because they found out that
[1:18:07] nations were organized but this great
[1:18:11] gospel is not dedicated to One Nation or
[1:18:15] one people it is dedicated to whosoever
[1:18:20] will let him come all Nation Kindred
[1:18:23] towns and people God never did intend to
[1:18:26] as to draw boundary lines yes right that
[1:18:31] is not what he
[1:18:32] intended that was not what he purpose
[1:18:36] for you to draw lines if you know how to
[1:18:38] draw a line then you must be get out of
[1:18:40] the
[1:18:41] picture we are not here to draw
[1:18:44] lines but brah said when it come to that
[1:18:48] is building the walls straight wall
[1:18:50] everybody can build but when it come to
[1:18:52] turning the corner amen it needs a
[1:18:56] amazing we need a qualified person to
[1:18:58] turn the
[1:19:00] corner turn the corner for your brother
[1:19:02] and enclose him enclose him inside don't
[1:19:06] draw line and then get him
[1:19:10] out you
[1:19:12] understand in the M ever present water
[1:19:15] from the Rock and when we get out of
[1:19:18] fellowship with one another in the
[1:19:19] church and out of fellowship with the
[1:19:21] Holy Spirit it bring us to a dry place a
[1:19:25] desert nothing alive everything got
[1:19:29] stickers on it you see we have come to a
[1:19:32] desert a little piece of a h cactus
[1:19:37] cactus with that sticker on it did you
[1:19:40] know what it is that is a precious
[1:19:43] little Tender Leaf that hasn't had no
[1:19:47] water water it is just wound itself up
[1:19:54] so tight till it is a
[1:19:57] sticker and when you see somebody like
[1:20:00] that maybe it is a precious so that
[1:20:03] could have been watered
[1:20:06] right will have been a tend little leaf
[1:20:10] or something but instead of that it w up
[1:20:14] till it become a
[1:20:16] sticker just punching at everything you
[1:20:19] know always finding
[1:20:21] fault only thing it needs is just
[1:20:25] water that is all it just needs a
[1:20:29] Revival a breaking up a reflection from
[1:20:32] the Lord it will unfold it itself s if
[1:20:37] you will just put it to the
[1:20:41] water
[1:20:45] stickers we have come to a dry
[1:20:48] land that is why all this confusion but
[1:20:51] we need
[1:20:53] Revival let us go go back to where some
[1:20:56] one said blessed is the man that is
[1:20:59] planted By the Waters of many rivers of
[1:21:01] many
[1:21:02] Waters that's where you supposed to be
[1:21:04] that's a rightful place you are not
[1:21:07] supposed to grow on the desert you
[1:21:09] become a sticker you become you become
[1:21:11] you you be fighting when the church got
[1:21:14] on the desert when joram took them to
[1:21:18] the desert and there was no water there
[1:21:19] was
[1:21:21] fighting fighting
[1:21:24] that is why there is confusion in the
[1:21:26] camp we have come to Desert we need to
[1:21:30] go back to the
[1:21:32] waters that's what said in the message

[1:23:21] God is bringing the church he is
[1:23:22] bringing it back to Restoration
[1:23:26] amen that is why we have come back to
[1:23:28] this ancient
[1:23:30] path where did the Believers walk he
[1:23:34] said content for the faith that was once
[1:23:37] given delivered to the
[1:23:40] Saints not you contending for your faith
[1:23:43] but faith that God has already delivered
[1:23:48] amen get back to the ancient
[1:23:52] path removing lark
[1:23:55] it would never be well with
[1:23:59] you it will never be well with those
[1:24:01] guys trying to remove the
[1:24:04] landmark
[1:24:08] violently you
[1:24:14] understand now Paul was saying here let
[1:24:17] pre the message if a trumpet give an
[1:24:20] uncertain
[1:24:21] sound in the First Corinthians CH 4 ver
[1:24:24] 7 and even these things and even things
[1:24:30] without life giv sound whether pipe or H
[1:24:36] except they give a
[1:24:39] distinction in the
[1:24:41] sound how shall it be known what is po
[1:24:47] or
[1:24:48] H for if the trumpet give an uncertain
[1:24:51] sound who shall prepare himself to
[1:24:53] battle
[1:24:56] you
[1:24:57] understand that is why we have a unique
[1:25:01] voice right speaking to the
[1:25:04] bride God speaking to his in the
[1:25:08] language to the bride the
[1:25:11] predestinated what you can hear the
[1:25:14] denomination cannot hear
[1:25:17] why it is right in the
[1:25:20] Bible repent and be baptized in the name
[1:25:23] of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ you shall
[1:25:25] receive remission of your sins and they
[1:25:28] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:29] you show it to the P say
[1:25:32] no you don't believe that what do you
[1:25:36] believe you must baptize in the name of
[1:25:38] Father Son and Holy Ghost oh my
[1:25:41] friend I tell people I was really Ghana
[1:25:44] was preaching through my horns as I
[1:25:46] couldn't I couldn't show the there's
[1:25:48] horns on my church every morning maybe
[1:25:51] evening I broadcast to the community it
[1:25:53] goes over half M so a lot of people hear
[1:25:55] me
[1:25:58] right and Pentecost will always call ah
[1:26:02] brother that is what Jesus said we will
[1:26:04] never listen to Peter we always listen
[1:26:07] to Jesus and said that that is where you
[1:26:09] make your
[1:26:11] error you listen to Jesus you not listen
[1:26:14] to Peter and you are still holding the
[1:26:17] Bible and Peter wrote the Bible Paul
[1:26:19] wrote the Bible and you not listening to
[1:26:22] them and you are still holding the Bible
[1:26:29] I say it is Blindness you don't
[1:26:32] understand what
[1:26:33] Jesus meew wrote there but why are they
[1:26:36] always stick to methew when you go to
[1:26:39] look he said You shall preach repentance
[1:26:42] in my name in Christ name it is right
[1:26:45] there in
[1:26:45] Luke they will not read that one the
[1:26:49] only love met you I said my friend that
[1:26:51] was commission that was not the ACT
[1:26:55] it was a commission let us go to pente
[1:26:58] and see the act of the Holy Ghost that
[1:27:00] is where they started the job that is
[1:27:02] where they started the commission where
[1:27:04] don't you go where the commission was
[1:27:07] started but you are always staying with
[1:27:09] where the commission was G given out is
[1:27:13] that
[1:27:15] correct go to where they started doing
[1:27:18] the job he said wait in Jerusalem don't
[1:27:22] go and do any other go wait until you
[1:27:25] are endu from from power from on high
[1:27:29] and they waited for that power and God
[1:27:32] said now step out you are my
[1:27:35] witness thank you Jesus yes sir that's
[1:27:40] right so that is why we are funded on
[1:27:44] the apostles Doctrine Ephesians 2:13 now
[1:27:47] therefore we are no more strangers and
[1:27:48] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[1:27:51] sins and of the household of God and and
[1:27:54] are built upon the foundation of the
[1:27:56] Apostles and Prophet Jesus Christ being
[1:27:58] the Chief
[1:27:59] Cornerstone that is what we are built
[1:28:03] upon the foundation of the Apostles no
[1:28:06] church doctrines no people's
[1:28:08] interpretation no people's theology we
[1:28:11] are built on the apostles foundation and
[1:28:14] that Foundation is Christ the
[1:28:19] word so the trumpet during the time of
[1:28:23] neemah
[1:28:24] where did the trumpeter stay neem asked
[1:28:27] the people to build but the trumpeter
[1:28:30] say stay right with me stay right with
[1:28:33] me because you cannot blow the trumpet
[1:28:36] on your own
[1:28:37] accord stay with me I will direct you
[1:28:40] what
[1:28:40] to let us look at neemah the book of
[1:28:45] nehemah Nehemiah 4:1 17
[1:28:49] nemah 4:1
[1:28:52] 17 they that bued on the wall and they
[1:28:56] that bear
[1:28:58] burdens with those that L
[1:29:01] LED everyone with one of his hand wrote
[1:29:05] in the work and with the other hand he
[1:29:08] held a
[1:29:09] weapon for the
[1:29:12] builders everyone had his sword guarded
[1:29:16] by his side and so they builded and he
[1:29:19] that sounded the trumpet was by me
[1:29:26] right the one that sented the trumpet
[1:29:29] was by
[1:29:31] neemah he is the prophet he wouldn't
[1:29:35] like you to blow any uncertain
[1:29:38] sound he wouldn't want you to confuse
[1:29:40] the camp he wouldn't want to bring any
[1:29:43] confusion in the camp so he asked the
[1:29:46] trumpeter to stay by him I will direct
[1:29:49] you how to blow the
[1:29:51] trumpet you understand that is why today
[1:29:55] said say what is on the
[1:29:57] table say he did not say play what he
[1:30:00] say say what is on the
[1:30:04] table the Commandment will not say play
[1:30:07] what is on the table say say what is on
[1:30:09] the
[1:30:12] table you understand why because we are
[1:30:17] trumpeters this man is a
[1:30:20] Trumpeter you have trumpeters the
[1:30:22] ministers are trumpeters but you
[1:30:24] supposed to stay with the
[1:30:26] prophet stay with
[1:30:29] meia so that the builders can be
[1:30:33] instructed so that they don't do any
[1:30:36] work they mess up and if there is danger
[1:30:39] the trumpeter will blow the
[1:30:42] trumpet because already they have their
[1:30:47] weapons friends that is why we must stay
[1:30:50] with the seventh angel but said in even
[1:30:53] messenger he said it is one man that
[1:30:55] receed the message and faithful men will
[1:30:58] take the message and give it to the
[1:30:59] bride

[1:31:13] they are not going to destroy the staff
[1:31:15] they will give the they give the Bri
[1:31:19] original what they receive from the
[1:31:21] prophet then they let it out give it it
[1:31:24] out to the
[1:31:26] bride yes sir that is why neem asked the
[1:31:30] trumpet stay by
[1:31:38] me so the prophet
[1:31:41] said God had in his Simplicity listen
[1:31:45] this paragraph 386 God hading in
[1:31:48] Simplicity then revealing himself in the
[1:31:51] same said listen may I say this quick
[1:31:55] now even the visions that God give here
[1:31:58] at the at the place it is
[1:32:03] misunderstood that is the reason you

[1:32:09] tape

[1:32:15] are wide awake you will see something
[1:32:18] see I hope I don't have to hold it in my
[1:32:23] hand and show you you see it is

[1:32:43] revealed in such
[1:32:45] Simplicity till it just cover over the
[1:32:49] top of the the people's head
[1:32:54] don't put your knowledge on it it's
[1:32:57] explaining
[1:32:59] Simplicity God revealing himself to the
[1:33:02] bride like I was talking to Pastor elzar
[1:33:05] has finished his job when he he took
[1:33:08] Rebecca to the field and he saw a man he
[1:33:11] said who is that one there that is Isaac
[1:33:14] your
[1:33:15] husband Rebecca jumped from the
[1:33:18] Beast run with arm open and then Embrace
[1:33:23] his husband Isaac Ela was only there
[1:33:26] watching the event yes sir yes sir
[1:33:29] that's right he has finished his
[1:33:33] work when is took Rebecca to the chamber
[1:33:36] Eliza has got no business to knock at
[1:33:38] that door he cannot go
[1:33:42] there that is what God is doing to us we
[1:33:45] are in the chamber with Jesus Christ
[1:33:49] intimacy falling in love with our
[1:33:51] husband nobody can come in it is you and
[1:33:58] Christ no man can come in
[1:34:01] between it is you and
[1:34:06] Christ so now we have to go back to the
[1:34:09] ancient
[1:34:11] lar in the message the results of

[1:39:51] and error we know what we are talking
[1:39:54] about let us go back to the
[1:39:56] ancient
[1:39:58] ways let's set the mark right let nobody
[1:40:02] remove the The
[1:40:05] Landmark when you see any man preaching
[1:40:07] contrary to this message he trying to
[1:40:09] remove the Lark when you see somebody
[1:40:12] telling that don't go to church he's
[1:40:14] removing the
[1:40:15] Lark because said don't forsake the
[1:40:17] assembling of yourself you understand
[1:40:21] what is sitting in you is not for you
[1:40:22] it's for the the church amen everyone
[1:40:25] has been CAU differently and you have a

[1:40:30] church and you don't know your gift get
[1:40:33] back to the
[1:40:35] altar you have something for the church
[1:40:37] it's not for you to edify the body of
[1:40:40] Christ yes sir that's right amen and you
[1:40:42] want to tell me that you want to stay at
[1:40:44] home you want to stay at home whereas I
[1:40:47] need your gift for edification you stay

[1:41:00] sickness because healing is sitting in
[1:41:03] you God plac that gift in you that's
[1:41:06] right that's why we need one another and
[1:41:09] then you want to tell me that let people
[1:41:11] stay at home and then they don't come to
[1:41:14] church it is contrary to The
[1:41:17] Landmark am it's never God lar let us
[1:41:21] not buy into those things
[1:41:23] let us be honest to ourselves it is not
[1:41:25] because that Bishop said it this big man
[1:41:28] said it it is not that big man we are
[1:41:31] talking of the
[1:41:35] Lark that is what we are dealing with so
[1:41:39] before we close let me give me some few
[1:41:41] minutes to say these
[1:41:42] things
[1:41:45] Brethren he said the angels that did not
[1:41:48] keep their first estate what happened to
[1:41:49] them in the book of Jude Jude 1:6 Jude
[1:41:52] CH 1:6 says and the angels which kept
[1:41:55] not their first estate but left their
[1:41:58] own habitation he have reserved in
[1:42:01] Everlasting chains under Darkness unto
[1:42:04] the Judgment of the great day right they
[1:42:08] did not keep their first estate right
[1:42:11] they remov the Lark right that is what
[1:42:14] has happened in the
[1:42:16] message Christ is the Myster of God
[1:42:18] revealed but man said now listen close
[1:42:21] paragraph 550 listen close calling
[1:42:24] Angels what kind of angels Luther Wesley
[1:42:28] cic Pentecostal who kept not their first
[1:42:32] estate like the Angels did and has fell
[1:42:36] into organization like Lucifer main hold
[1:42:40] at nessia and what have they done
[1:42:45] organized and they got a great eunic
[1:42:48] Association of ministers to make an
[1:42:51] image onto the Beast as the Bible said
[1:42:54] and the building a Christian economy
[1:42:57] that will close the doors of this church
[1:43:00] and others like this that is what they
[1:43:03] doing removing the
[1:43:06] landmark like the angels that did not
[1:43:08] kept their first estate what happened to
[1:43:10] them they lost their place that is what
[1:43:14] has happened to the churches they could
[1:43:16] not keep their first estate amen they
[1:43:20] didn't keep
[1:43:21] it they left their l L
[1:43:24] Mark is that right the Lark
[1:43:29] now so it is time for us to realize
[1:43:33] where we are standing yes sir go to the
[1:43:36] front line said go to the front line and
[1:43:41] look at the face of the enemy and tell
[1:43:43] him my friend you cannot deceive me

[1:44:08] how advice the people are how they are
[1:44:11] ready to take the sword and walk out in
[1:44:14] the front line and say I challenge you
[1:44:18] Satan you see I challenge you you can't
[1:44:22] make me dis
[1:44:24] anymore what are these things done for
[1:44:27] so that people will believe it is the
[1:44:30] word it is where that shows that I am
[1:44:33] preaching what I'm preaching is the
[1:44:35] truth the word the word made flesh made
[1:44:39] flesh in you made flesh made flesh in
[1:44:42] you made flesh in
[1:44:44] me the
[1:44:46] word that is why you can go to the front
[1:44:50] line David could go to the front line
[1:44:53] why because he was
[1:44:55] anointed and you look in the face of
[1:44:58] that giant go my friend you cannot scare
[1:45:01] me with your size right you can't scare
[1:45:04] me with your size right there is
[1:45:07] something in
[1:45:09] me that is greater than that size you
[1:45:11] are posing up
[1:45:13] there there's something in you Fearless
[1:45:17] when you see the devil you look into his
[1:45:19] say my friend I am here to conquer like
[1:45:23] David said I am here to conquer I'm not
[1:45:24] here to see battle I am here to
[1:45:28] conquer I've not come to see battle but
[1:45:31] his brothers thought he has come to see
[1:45:33] battle you are not here to see battle
[1:45:36] you are here to
[1:45:38] win that's why we are here so Bren it is
[1:45:42] time for us to really bring the lamb
[1:45:47] back back to where it was
[1:45:50] set bring it back when you see anyone
[1:45:53] bringing restoration that is why Malachi
[1:45:57] 4 is bringing the L Mark where it's
[1:45:59] supposed to be that's why we have this
[1:46:03] message all the churches has removed the
[1:46:05] Lark but he said I shall restore say the
[1:46:09] Lord all the he said weep because the
[1:46:15] can the has eaten weep it was a time of
[1:46:19] weeping but later je said
[1:46:24] do not weep again Rejoice because all
[1:46:27] what was destroyed has been
[1:46:31] restored that is why John also stopped
[1:46:34] weeping when the The Voice asked for a
[1:46:37] Kinsman who is worthy there was silent
[1:46:40] there was mute and everybody kept
[1:46:43] quiet yes but when the voice came with

[1:46:56] manifestation of sons of God the Bible
[1:46:59] says all creation is reaping all
[1:47:01] creation is groaning it was time of
[1:47:04] reaping because the master lost his
[1:47:07] estate the master lost his position amen
[1:47:11] and braam

[1:47:16] when the master is restored all creation
[1:47:19] will be
[1:47:20] restored am amen

[1:48:39] of time but some along the line sometime

[1:49:33] to the church you understand don't pull
[1:49:37] away like people are saying I
[1:49:40] told Brother what did Brother Bram speak
[1:49:43] about our friend Brother Joseph he said
[1:49:45] I want Joseph to preach he must come to
[1:49:48] the pit and preach as I'm
[1:49:51] preaching he supposed to be a
[1:49:53] preacher that's what the prophet let you
[1:49:55] read that for his wonders to perform I
[1:49:58] love good
[1:50:00] singing his wonders to perform this 58
[1:50:03] tape number 0112 paragraph 6 he said I
[1:50:06] love good singing and I love music the
[1:50:10] trumpet is one of my favorite instrument
[1:50:13] as the young man just got through PR
[1:50:16] playing and I want even my guest to take
[1:50:19] up the trumpet one of them
[1:50:23] to taking the piano and Joseph I don't
[1:50:26] know I want him to be a
[1:50:30] preacher I want him to be a preacher and
[1:50:33] I call him while
[1:50:35] ago that he was taking a little nap the
[1:50:39] afternoon and for getting ready for the
[1:50:42] service tonight he said I want him to be
[1:50:45] a
[1:50:46] preacher now ministers come and let us
[1:50:50] reason today said Minister come can help
[1:50:53] because they are ministers if they are
[1:50:56] really call of God Paul said who unto me
[1:51:00] if I preach not the
[1:51:03] gospel it is it is incubate it is a
[1:51:06] force on you to preach if you are called
[1:51:08] to preach
[1:51:12] bradel if I don't preach the
[1:51:14] gospel you understand they they are
[1:51:19] ministers maybe not by desire
[1:51:23] but because the Holy Ghost has called
[1:51:26] them to be
[1:51:28] ministers you understand I wouldn't
[1:51:31] desire My Boy either of them to be
[1:51:34] ministers if they just had to go away
[1:51:38] and get a
[1:51:40] little
[1:51:42] physiology or something like that and go
[1:51:46] out to make an act before people I want
[1:51:50] them to go to the pit and mountain of
[1:51:53] the Holy Ghost and preach
[1:51:56] because that they love the Lord Jesus
[1:51:59] not a meal ticket just because they love
[1:52:03] the Lord and do it for what good it can
[1:52:07] be done for the kingdom of God outside
[1:52:10] of that I wouldn't want him to even be a
[1:52:14] bishop whatever he might be I wouldn't
[1:52:17] desire
[1:52:19] it I will desire my son to preach the
[1:52:22] word under the
[1:52:24] anointing when you have the Holy Ghost
[1:52:27] the anointed word revealed to you

[2:09:51] at your
[2:09:53] feet they
[2:09:56] Spirit sweep
[2:09:59] over my
[2:10:03] soul lord Jesus we just love you this
[2:10:07] morning Lord God and Lord we know that
[2:10:11] your word will never
[2:10:12] fail and your Bible says it will never
[2:10:15] pass away that heaven and earth will
[2:10:17] pass away but your word will always be
[2:10:20] thus in
[2:10:22] amen and Lord we realize that if any
[2:10:26] time that the landmark would be
[2:10:28] moved it's because the hearts aren't
[2:10:31] right with
[2:10:33] you
[2:10:35] God we know in the age that we live
[2:10:40] in there's many hearts aren't right but
[2:10:45] Lord we go with this great
[2:10:48] promise that you promis that you'd never
[2:10:50] leave us forsake us and you promised
[2:10:53] that there would be a a bride in this
[2:10:56] age and your word says that this second
[2:11:00] Eve she'll never
[2:11:02] fall yes God we help us to take the
[2:11:05] scales off our
[2:11:08] eyes take the scales offer Eyes Lord
[2:11:12] Jesus and recognize the difference
[2:11:15] between
[2:11:17] religion and you
[2:11:21] yes God help
[2:11:23] us help us to recognize the difference
[2:11:26] Lord God we
[2:11:28] pray your beautiful name we
[2:11:32] pray
[2:11:34] hallelujah hallelujah God bless you we
[2:11:36] just look forward to fellowship and amen
[2:11:41] God
[2:11:42] knows our hearts
[2:11:44] amen amen I I wouldn't mind reading one
[2:11:47] scripture just one verse in Jeremiah 3 I
[2:11:50] was watching to see if our brother would
[2:11:52] read it just one scripture to leave you
[2:11:55] with a promise when we go you know when
[2:11:57] The Whole World's Fallen apart God's
[2:12:00] completely in control that's when it
[2:12:03] seems like the landmark has
[2:12:06] moved it hasn't moved in God's
[2:12:09] mind and we see in Jeremiah that God was
[2:12:12] judging the children of Israel and there
[2:12:15] was many false
[2:12:17] pastors there was many false ministers
[2:12:21] and God said he'd take care of those
[2:12:24] people but in Jeremiah 3
[2:12:28] and15 God said he would give something
[2:12:31] to fix the
[2:12:36] problem and all you have to decide
[2:12:40] is is if the servants around you have
[2:12:44] the heart of
[2:12:48] God that's all you have to decide
[2:12:51] I will give you you read
[2:12:53] Jeremiah God was judging them he had no
[2:12:57] mercy on
[2:12:59] them the man of God had failed
[2:13:03] God but he said I will give you
[2:13:06] pastors according to my own
[2:13:10] heart and they shall feed
[2:13:13] you knowledge and understanding a man of
[2:13:18] God with God's heart Will Never Move the
[2:13:23] landmark it'll only be a false prophet
[2:13:27] and a wolf and sheep's
[2:13:28] clothing amen somebody with an agenda or
[2:13:33] a kingdom to build that'll move the
[2:13:35] landmark God help us amen God bless you
[2:13:38] look forward to fellowship and this week
[2:13:39] and remember next week Wednesday night
[2:13:42] our brother will be with us on Wednesday
[2:13:44] night and then uh Saturday at 4 brother
