[22:51] just read our scripture we're going to
[22:53] turn to Isaiah 7 and 14 and
[22:57] I was reading
[22:59] wearing my
[23:01] my dad should go this morning
[23:07] I woke up this morning
[23:10] thinking of Dad
[23:21] amen
[23:23] if you had a Godly
[23:25] dad
[23:27] man which many of us did or have
[23:31] like I had
[23:33] you're very blessed this morning
[23:38] man just many things in our life Satan
[23:42] tries to slip away on us
[23:44] you know I remember my dad
[23:47] I never
[23:50] I never remember my dad
[23:53] without family altar
[23:56] ever
[23:59] breakfast
[24:00] was family author after breakfast
[24:03] the day never started
[24:05] without spinning around
[24:07] and praying at your chair
[24:10] how many of us you know
[24:15] God forgive me help me
[24:17] it didn't matter if he was combined in a
[24:19] hundred thousand dollars worth of crop
[24:21] that day
[24:23] after breakfast
[24:25] he had family altar
[24:29] period
[24:31] and it was known at our house when you
[24:33] come in
[24:35] if you heard people praying you waited
[24:37] at the stairs before the door was opened
[24:40] we didn't stop Finley altar
[24:43] for anybody
[24:46] those were Godly men
[24:49] but were Godly men
[24:51] God help us amen
[24:53] amen
[24:55] amen
[24:57] I want to God wants to preach this
[24:59] morning on
[25:00] his plan and this was just beautiful you
[25:03] know when the prophet when I seen the
[25:05] quote on the prophet he said when he
[25:07] caught the revelation of this
[25:09] well I'll read it to you but he just
[25:11] lost his mind worshiping God it was just
[25:15] beautiful amen
[25:17] and therefore the Lord himself shall
[25:20] give you a sign and behold a virgin
[25:22] shall conceive and bear a son and shall
[25:25] call his name
[25:27] Emmanuel let's turn to Matthew 1
[25:30] Matthew 1 and 19. now this was given in
[25:34] Prophecy approach 800 and some years
[25:36] before Christ
[25:38] gained
[25:40] Matthew 1 19 then Joseph her husband
[25:44] being a just man and not willing to make
[25:46] her a public example was minded to put
[25:49] her away privately but while he thought
[25:51] on these things behold the angel of the
[25:53] Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying
[25:55] Joseph thou son of David fear not to
[25:58] take thy unto thee Mary thy wife for
[26:01] thou which is conceived in her
[26:04] is of the Holy Ghost
[26:06] the Holy Ghost is a key part here and
[26:09] she shall bear forth a son and thou
[26:11] shall call his name Jesus for he shall
[26:14] save his people
[26:16] from their sins and now all this was
[26:19] done that it might be fulfilled which
[26:21] was spoken of the Lord by the prophets
[26:23] what we just read earlier
[26:26] and behold a virgin shall conceive it
[26:29] shall bring forth the son and they shall
[26:31] call his name Emmanuel being interpreted
[26:36] God
[26:38] with us
[26:40] Lord Jesus we ask that you just said the
[26:42] blessing
[26:43] to your word this morning and your
[26:45] beautiful name we pray amen amen you may
[26:49] have your seats this morning
[26:52] I just find it hard to work
[26:54] all chained up
[26:57] amen
[26:59] amen you know we want to look in the
[27:01] scriptures this morning and we want to
[27:03] look into and and my uh where did I put
[27:06] my
[27:07] my title was
[27:10] living in the thoughts or the mind of
[27:14] God
[27:15] living or being
[27:17] in the thoughts in mind
[27:20] of God and we know it in the scriptures
[27:22] in the Old Testament that you know when
[27:25] the uh the ark of the covenant was
[27:27] around they God had put guards around
[27:30] the ark and we know that in Revelations
[27:33] that John said what those guards were
[27:34] and Revelations 4 7-10 he talks about
[27:38] what these guards were and they were the
[27:41] the four beasts amen there were the lion
[27:43] the calf
[27:45] the man and the flying eagle and they
[27:48] were on all the four sides of the
[27:51] Tabernacle to protect the holies of
[27:54] holies
[27:55] amen but now in the New Testament God
[27:59] has that she's going to help me this
[28:00] morning God has a God has a new
[28:03] testament and Covenant and it is still
[28:07] guarded this morning and you know I want
[28:10] it before we maybe go into that and just
[28:12] explain that I want to show you that
[28:15] most people misinterpret the guardian
[28:18] there's people that have come to this
[28:20] church and have walked out of this
[28:21] church are not here this morning because
[28:23] they've misinterpreted the guardian
[28:27] now if you know the Bible says and we'll
[28:29] have that scripture and we'll read it
[28:30] later if you know to do right
[28:34] and don't do it it's iniquity
[28:37] I'm bad
[28:39] but the guardian of the temple and the
[28:42] whole plan that Christ came in a in a
[28:45] little babe
[28:49] was to us in the mind of God the Plan of
[28:52] Redemption it was Grace to us it was
[28:57] Grace to the world I said let me
[28:59] rephrase it like this it was Grace to
[29:02] those that would accept it
[29:05] there that's more true
[29:08] and so God put guards around this and
[29:12] you know men have brought this and you
[29:14] know the word of God himself is is Grace
[29:19] you can look at all the different spots
[29:21] of the guards see God knows what you
[29:24] need to do to go through
[29:27] and so he put it in his word and that
[29:29] was Grace
[29:31] and people walk away from it on a daily
[29:34] basis
[29:35] others and this goes straight to
[29:37] damnation
[29:39] amen
[29:41] straight to damnation
[29:43] every example in the Bible that that you
[29:46] know you whether you're comfortable with
[29:48] or not comfortable with God put it there
[29:50] and it was Grace
[29:54] it was for your own good
[29:55] God knew what it would take you to go
[29:57] through and Satan is a liar and Sly this
[30:01] morning I want to tell you there's
[30:03] something I I just recently seen
[30:06] something actually it was this morning
[30:10] God knows what he's doing God knew what
[30:13] I was going to minister and I want to
[30:15] tell you how Sly The Devil is
[30:18] this morning
[30:22] you know when our co-works
[30:24] they re-identified the definition
[30:28] of a woman
[30:32] now
[30:34] that's not a surprise to you maybe
[30:36] but the at the end when they were doing
[30:39] it the judge refused to identify a woman
[30:44] yeah
[30:46] she gave a reason but we'll save the
[30:48] reason
[30:51] I want to show you the spirit behind us
[30:54] you know me and my wife and many of you
[30:56] here know people that walked away from
[30:59] Grace the word of God
[31:03] and one generation they were right where
[31:05] the courts are today
[31:09] do you know I have relatives through
[31:11] marriage
[31:13] and relative blood relatives
[31:16] that have kids that are gay and lesbians
[31:20] and it was only their parents
[31:24] that the women started wearing pants
[31:27] if I came here this morning and I had a
[31:29] dress on and I was wearing my wife's
[31:31] glasses you would know that there was
[31:33] something mentally
[31:34] wrong up here
[31:39] mentally wrong
[31:42] and yet you know in the Free Methodist
[31:44] Church when I was born my birth was when
[31:48] they voted for women to wear pants
[31:53] my dad helped build the Holiness Church
[31:56] was when when the Free Methodist people
[31:58] voted to wear wedding bands cut their
[32:01] hair and wear pants
[32:02] and those people's children are gay and
[32:06] lesbians this morning
[32:10] I'll read you the quote
[32:12] where the Prophet said that God made man
[32:15] a man and he gave Matt a dress in the
[32:18] Bible
[32:19] and if you're a woman this morning and
[32:21] you're wearing pants whatever your
[32:22] excuses your kids will be gay and
[32:25] lesbians
[32:26] amen it's Grace
[32:30] you call it freedom World calls it
[32:32] Freedom it's Grace the very people that
[32:35] voted for the women to wear pants their
[32:39] kids are gay and lesbians I could name
[32:41] the names
[32:43] every one of my kids would know who they
[32:45] are
[32:46] you come to me after off the line I'll
[32:48] tell you definitely who they are there's
[32:50] Christmas parties that are not happening
[32:52] to this this year
[32:55] because the parents are my age
[32:58] and their kids
[33:01] are getting lesbians
[33:03] amen
[33:05] don't think the devil don't know what
[33:08] he's doing let me read the quote for you
[33:10] just and I ain't proud I don't know
[33:12] where this came from but I'm not
[33:15] preaching on this the prophet warned us
[33:17] of this watch us and Satan's eating and
[33:19] the prophet said notice this and this
[33:21] perverse generation it was man it became
[33:25] from man to woman and from woman to man
[33:28] and don't know it the very product of
[33:31] Satan's Eden and if you'll watch it in
[33:33] the streets today
[33:34] that's our modern people
[33:38] okay now watch I'm going to finish this
[33:39] quote same one drops down another
[33:41] paragraph said God made man a man and he
[33:44] made woman a woman and God gave them
[33:48] different dress
[33:50] hello
[33:52] do you know what every country of the
[33:54] world I might not go and understand
[33:56] their language but when I get off the
[33:58] airport and I landed The Layover
[34:02] they have a dress for a woman and a path
[34:05] for a man and they're speaking every
[34:08] language in the world
[34:12] it's called that International Airport
[34:15] and watch what he finishes here
[34:17] and he said God dressed some different
[34:19] and he meant for them to stay that way
[34:22] and act that way what is the feminist
[34:25] Spirit and the other is masculine
[34:28] and he separated Adam in the garden
[34:32] and he did this and separated them
[34:36] since Satan's eat them
[34:38] and you know when you look at Grace
[34:41] Jesus coming in flesh was Grace
[34:45] Jesus coming being born of a Virgin Mary
[34:49] was Grace but Jesus given us his word
[34:52] was Grace
[34:54] it was Grace now for all those
[34:57] ridiculous people that say
[35:00] they say you can't wear a dress over
[35:03] pants
[35:05] amen
[35:08] you're ridiculous
[35:10] because if you're wearing underwear this
[35:11] morning it's pads
[35:13] the our Prophet called Grandma's
[35:16] underwear shorts but if you're a lady
[35:18] you have a dress over your sharks
[35:22] amen
[35:24] so we're balanced
[35:26] if it's minus 40 degrees and you're
[35:28] going to freeze to death and you're
[35:30] going horseback riding or you have to
[35:32] work for a living outside women are
[35:34] going to wear pants but you'll put a
[35:35] dress over it
[35:37] your outerwear will be addressed
[35:40] or your kids
[35:42] will be gay and lesbians
[35:45] you come to me after I'll give you two
[35:46] examples everyone you know very well
[35:48] within 45 minutes Drive of this church
[35:53] amen
[35:54] you see all these things the fivefold
[35:57] ministry was Grace for us all these
[35:59] things I'm going to give you an example
[36:01] next week of a of uh
[36:05] of an example in the Bible you know of
[36:08] an example where the man had sinned and
[36:11] he tried to hide it
[36:13] and God brought him Grace
[36:15] and he refused to Grace
[36:18] and nothing but the grace of God he
[36:20] changed his mind and accepted to Grace
[36:22] and was saved
[36:24] I don't think we'll get there today
[36:26] but all these things are Grace
[36:28] Deuteronomy 22 5 what we wear is Grace
[36:32] amen Hebrews 12 14 without Holiness is
[36:36] Grace
[36:38] amen Malachi 4 5 is Grace
[36:42] I'll send you Elijah the prophet's Grace
[36:44] to us
[36:46] amen
[36:48] and we see
[36:49] that in our day
[36:51] we're not in the Old Testament age and
[36:54] The Mercy Seat is not guarded by the
[36:56] four beasts this morning but I want to
[36:58] show you what's guarded by and I I get
[37:00] off on that side lane but I want to I
[37:03] want to nail down what Grace is
[37:05] Grace is not getting your own way
[37:08] Grace is the word of God
[37:11] amen your people say well I I say well
[37:14] what about this part of the Bible and
[37:15] they say well I don't you know God don't
[37:17] see that in me
[37:20] that's that refuse Grace
[37:23] amen
[37:27] I still refuse Grace
[37:29] and that's what the world's done and
[37:31] that's why they're in the state that
[37:32] they're in and he said you know
[37:36] here
[37:37] The Mercy Seat was guarded in the Old
[37:39] Testament by the Beast
[37:41] but today
[37:43] it's guarded differently
[37:45] oh it's beautiful this is where the
[37:48] problem let me read what the prophet
[37:49] said he said I was sitting the other day
[37:51] and I saw this and he said I jumped up
[37:53] and ran around and around and around my
[37:56] chair and I was saying Glory Glory Glory
[38:00] Glory Glory to God
[38:02] going around
[38:03] and around my chair
[38:07] it was God's grace to us
[38:10] that we've seen in the word where it
[38:12] says
[38:14] to get to heaven you must be
[38:16] to be a child of God you must do
[38:20] Man Without Holiness no man will see God
[38:23] it's Abomination for women to whatever
[38:25] those pertaining to a man and a man to
[38:27] wear with a woman
[38:30] Grace
[38:32] you know I heard a minister just
[38:34] recently you know what when the when the
[38:36] when the feminist Spirit cut their hair
[38:39] off it was immediately after that God
[38:41] took their husbands and their sons to
[38:44] kill them in World War one and two
[38:47] Grace
[38:49] Grace
[38:51] how could the world Miss Grace you know
[38:55] our Prophet said that everything that
[38:57] god Jehovah could have done to save the
[39:01] world
[39:02] he did
[39:05] and he came
[39:07] and his own received them not
[39:09] I want to read you this
[39:11] quote in Revelations
[39:16] 61 where the Prophet preached on
[39:18] Revelations and he said now we're living
[39:20] in another age Glory I love the seeds
[39:23] don't you
[39:25] now God has a mercy seat today
[39:28] see he had a mercy seat in the Old
[39:30] Testament
[39:32] and the priest would go in once a year
[39:34] and take this the sins of the people and
[39:38] get forgiveness
[39:39] and the holy of holies
[39:42] okay but today we're living in a new age
[39:46] don't you love this age now God has the
[39:48] same Mercy Seat
[39:50] two and it's guarded today do you
[39:54] believe that
[39:56] where is The Mercy Seat found today now
[40:00] this is what the prophet jumped up and
[40:02] ran around his chair singing Glory
[40:06] Glory Glory
[40:08] losing his mind where's The Mercy Seat
[40:10] found today
[40:11] The Mercy Seat
[40:13] is found
[40:15] in your heart
[40:17] and in my heart
[40:24] where did it come to
[40:26] but in the heart of men see it was when
[40:31] the Holy Ghost was given
[40:33] it was God
[40:35] and what did it do
[40:38] the Holy Ghost it came into the heart of
[40:41] men this is paragraph 323.
[40:45] if you want this after in Revelations is
[40:48] I right he said now let's mark it down
[40:50] here he said get ready to draw it out he
[40:52] said The Mercy Seat is the Holy Ghost
[40:56] Grace
[40:57] put in your heart
[40:59] and mind
[41:01] there's Grace here as long as there's
[41:04] the bride of Christ Holy Ghost filled
[41:07] Believers on Earth it's Grace you say
[41:10] well it's it's here because you're
[41:13] packing it
[41:15] okay
[41:17] do you know our Prophet said that on
[41:20] road rage that how you would respond or
[41:24] to something like that could affect that
[41:26] person's eternal
[41:28] destination
[41:32] that's your grace to the world
[41:35] amen but so many times when people have
[41:38] been given Grace and showed Grace in the
[41:40] word of God they've just turned it down
[41:42] just turned it down God help them amen
[41:48] see so all right guarding The Mercy Seat
[41:51] today now God has
[41:53] he hasn't got the same guards as The
[41:55] Mercy Seat today but it's in the hearts
[41:58] of men
[41:59] oh man with the Holy Ghost and then he
[42:03] goes into that paragraph where he's seen
[42:04] it
[42:06] and he got blessed amen now you see in
[42:09] the in the in the Bible God the prophet
[42:12] used another example for guarding the
[42:14] The Mercy Seat he said The Mercy Seat
[42:16] was the four Gospels
[42:19] and the four gospels were guarding
[42:21] knacks
[42:22] which was where the Holy Ghost came
[42:24] through
[42:26] in the Bible
[42:27] ain't that beautiful this morning so you
[42:29] see three types in the Bible we see the
[42:32] old Tabernacle where the holy holies was
[42:34] and God had the four beasts around the
[42:36] Tabernacle guarding it
[42:39] and then when Jehovah himself came and
[42:42] this day
[42:43] the perfect sacrifice where it wasn't
[42:46] just a covering of sin but it actually
[42:48] took the sin away
[42:50] he wrote all about it in the gospels in
[42:52] the New Testament Matthew Mark Luke and
[42:54] John and then acts came and he and the
[42:58] day of Pentecost which is the baptism of
[43:00] the Holy Ghost and Grace was planted
[43:03] in the heart of the Bride
[43:06] oh it's beautiful this morning you are
[43:09] walking Grace when you go in the grocery
[43:11] store and somebody looks at you this
[43:14] morning
[43:15] they're looking at Grace
[43:18] oh man if you could just comprehend this
[43:21] and
[43:21] [Music]
[43:23] concerns when you see
[43:26] g64 this is well after the seals here in
[43:29] God's life it's eternal life the hearing
[43:32] in paragraph the 12v cycle of God is
[43:35] life eternal life in the beginning now
[43:37] we know we know that if you got the Holy
[43:39] Ghost and you're going to heaven if
[43:40] you've got eternal life you always were
[43:42] Eternal amen and see why you can Pike
[43:46] Grace this morning is God was Grace
[43:49] God came in grace to the world and if
[43:53] you are part of God and you were in
[43:55] God's loins you have the same character
[43:57] as God because you're the same genus God
[44:00] and so you are little you you are like
[44:03] your daddy God grace
[44:06] he said God you know we we know this and
[44:09] we've been taught this but we'll go into
[44:10] this a bit you know before God was God
[44:12] he was despaired he was an Elohim it was
[44:15] the logos
[44:18] and he had many attributes now I want to
[44:22] read this he said you know God is life
[44:25] eternal life in the beginning was God
[44:27] and he said no just I'm reading from the
[44:29] prophet he said he wasn't God at that
[44:32] time
[44:33] because God in the English means an
[44:35] object of worship so there was nothing
[44:38] but him
[44:41] that's a paradox it's beautiful when you
[44:43] get it
[44:45] he wasn't God
[44:46] but he was God
[44:48] he wasn't nothing but he was something
[44:53] oh it's beautiful see God always was
[45:00] and there wasn't nothing but him and he
[45:01] was eternal just Eternal one
[45:04] and there was no moon and there was no
[45:06] stars there was no Angels there was no
[45:09] nothing
[45:10] but at in this beginning we called him
[45:13] God the Father
[45:14] and he had all these attributes in him
[45:17] let me go into this and he mentions all
[45:19] these attributes but see these
[45:21] attributes
[45:22] if you're eternal if you're going to
[45:25] heaven you know in John 13 it says no
[45:28] man goes send up to heaven but first he
[45:30] came down from heaven first
[45:32] you're not going to be Eternal unless
[45:34] you always were eternal
[45:35] and the only one that was eternal was
[45:37] the logos of God the spirit of God
[45:42] said in them had all these attributes
[45:44] but there was nothing but him
[45:47] and me and you
[45:50] Say Amen
[45:52] because I was there
[45:55] see what he was having these thoughts I
[45:57] was that
[45:58] what do you have on the cross I was
[46:01] there when he came as a baby in the
[46:03] manger I was there
[46:04] oh that's beautiful
[46:07] when they spit on him I was there
[46:10] you know the Bible says these things say
[46:12] blessed are you if you're persecuted for
[46:14] my name's sake for they stoned the
[46:16] prophets and killed me
[46:19] praise God I had somebody at a Christmas
[46:21] party said I heard a lot of negative
[46:23] think about you praise God I said I'm in
[46:24] good company wow
[46:29] I'm in good company
[46:31] if somebody comes up and says I heard a
[46:33] lot of negative about you say I'm good
[46:35] good company
[46:36] they stoned the prophets and they killed
[46:39] Jesus
[46:41] they sown the prophets and they killed
[46:43] Jesus they called him about
[46:46] the devil chief of the devils
[46:49] that the devil was casting out the
[46:50] Devils they thought he was born before
[46:52] marriage
[46:54] he said you heard a lot of bad things
[46:56] about me oh praise God they said the
[46:59] same thing about Christ
[47:04] oh my recognize the spirit
[47:08] who persecutes the bride
[47:14] Lucifer
[47:15] amen he had all these attributes he had
[47:18] a night no remember he was just him
[47:21] but he wasn't nothing but I was there
[47:24] it was him and me and him and you but we
[47:27] ran him but we weren't recognized
[47:29] but we were in his loins
[47:33] oh my you're you're far too quiet this
[47:35] morning and it is these attributes to be
[47:38] a father and in him was the attribute to
[47:39] be God
[47:41] wow he wanted to be more he don't want
[47:43] quiet worship enema is the attribute to
[47:46] be a son he wanted to be Christ he
[47:47] wanted to be Jesus
[47:49] in him was the attribute to be our
[47:51] savior oh thank you Lord and it was the
[47:54] attribute to be my healer oh hallelujah
[47:57] thank you Lord and then it was all these
[47:59] things that we see now just displaying
[48:03] his attributes let me just tell you
[48:06] something
[48:07] now if you were in him
[48:10] you'll display those exact same
[48:11] attributes
[48:14] amen and those are those exact same
[48:17] attributes will be displayed until
[48:20] Christ comes
[48:22] and takes us home the bride the Holy
[48:24] Ghost filled people and the rapture
[48:29] oh my now if you ever think in the
[48:32] beginning that if you had eternal life
[48:34] there's only one form of eternal life
[48:35] and eternal life had no beginning
[48:37] and it has no any and so if you have
[48:39] eternal life you were always you were an
[48:42] attribute of God thinking
[48:45] before there was anything
[48:48] but him
[48:49] oh I love the prophet man he's a he's a
[48:52] good
[48:53] man it's just good food
[48:55] your form your shape and what you are
[48:57] now it is just a negative
[49:01] of the positive
[49:04] Hallelujah this ain't the real me I have
[49:07] a theophany waiting for me
[49:10] and when you come up around 20 22 years
[49:12] eggs you're just a negative then death
[49:15] develops in the picture
[49:18] and death develops a picture to the
[49:21] positive when you're in your Prime he's
[49:23] talking about being 20 and 22. but then
[49:26] when this Earthly Tabernacle be
[49:28] dissolved we have one already waiting
[49:31] for us and this just displays and now
[49:33] shows what God done
[49:35] let God be in God and he created the
[49:38] angels and the sons in Christ Jesus and
[49:41] he became a savior
[49:45] when Jesus died
[49:47] I want to tell you something this
[49:49] morning this is I don't mean that I'm
[49:51] going to finish this quote but what's
[49:54] you know
[49:57] God God help me
[49:59] God help me and God help us
[50:03] you cannot change the world
[50:07] but you can change the world
[50:10] you can change the world
[50:13] from yourself
[50:16] you can say like they said in the Bible
[50:18] for me and my house
[50:20] I'll serve the Lord for me and my house
[50:23] I won't do that
[50:24] you know I was out in the restaurant the
[50:26] one time and and somebody was talking I
[50:28] said I won't I'm not going there I won't
[50:30] go there with you
[50:32] well he was discussing something that
[50:34] was undiscussable
[50:36] because see the Bible warns us
[50:40] it's Grace
[50:41] that's not my anointed that's Holy Ghost
[50:43] filled people that's not ministers I do
[50:46] my prophets no harm
[50:48] no that's Ministry
[50:50] that's Grace
[50:52] you know the prophet talks about people
[50:54] that came against this ministry
[50:58] they didn't end well for them
[51:01] because see they didn't listen
[51:03] to Grace
[51:04] anybody that won't listen to this grace
[51:09] that's why the wrath of God when it
[51:11] comes
[51:13] will be so fierce
[51:14] because he showed it and you refused to
[51:17] amen
[51:19] wow so we will portray these same
[51:23] attributes
[51:24] I I started to say he said what spirit
[51:26] is it
[51:28] that somebody's trying to do something
[51:30] for God
[51:32] and somebody will beat them down
[51:35] what spirit is that
[51:38] I don't care what any one of yous do
[51:42] if it's for the kingdom of God
[51:45] do and better and further the kingdom of
[51:48] God
[51:49] if it's a sister being a Sunday school
[51:51] teacher or singing a special or playing
[51:52] the piano or cooking me a pie or
[51:55] something on this oh well that's it
[51:57] they're doing that
[51:58] another system can do that a lot better
[52:03] huh amen
[52:10] that never came from Christ
[52:12] see when the disciples came to Christ
[52:14] and they said we've seen some people
[52:16] casting out devils and demons but we
[52:19] didn't recognize them and they didn't go
[52:20] to our church and they definitely didn't
[52:21] go to our cemetery and so we stopped
[52:24] them we didn't think they were qualified
[52:30] whoa
[52:32] and Grace said what
[52:37] if they're on our side
[52:39] you did what
[52:45] you know I read quotes the other day and
[52:47] studying and preaching you know it our
[52:49] prophet
[52:51] was amazing
[52:53] he asked some questions and answers they
[52:55] said should we ever attend a church that
[52:58] don't teach the message that you teach
[53:02] I'd like to read you that quote but I
[53:04] don't have it in front of me it's on my
[53:05] iPad
[53:07] it'll shocked you what he said
[53:12] I'll just paraphrase it
[53:15] said questions and answers in 64. it's
[53:17] the first message of questions and
[53:18] answers and it's right before he talks
[53:21] about the uh the the gifts and going to
[53:24] the two prophets and 144 000 right
[53:27] before Pentecost before we leave the
[53:28] service it's way down it's about
[53:30] 350 paragraph or something I haven't
[53:33] memorized
[53:34] he says 100 should you ever go to a
[53:37] church that don't teach the message
[53:39] that the prophets
[53:41] 100 percent
[53:47] he said most definitely
[53:49] he said go and get all you can
[53:52] he said if they just believe that Jesus
[53:55] was the Christ then take that
[53:57] and leave the rest
[53:59] see by you go and you can be a really
[54:02] bright light you could be a really
[54:04] bright light
[54:10] and maybe they didn't read this today
[54:14] but they'll see this
[54:20] and you they might be in sin in many
[54:24] areas
[54:28] I can give that quote to you to my I
[54:30] won't have to search for it I've already
[54:32] got a picture of it
[54:34] yeah
[54:37] I said take what the truth is
[54:40] and just he said no he did say don't
[54:43] join me
[54:45] man
[54:48] the attributes of Christ see
[54:51] not all Israel's Israel
[54:54] and not all this Brides bride
[54:57] and the brideless bride will not be
[54:59] fighting the bride
[55:01] and that also the bride this Pride they
[55:03] won't be worried about the ones that
[55:05] didn't get Grace
[55:07] they'll be trying to show Grace to them
[55:09] but they won't be trying to cram it down
[55:11] their throat
[55:16] you know why
[55:18] there's a very simple reason because
[55:20] Christ never crammed it down your throat
[55:24] he gave you free choice
[55:26] he showed it to you and he showed it to
[55:29] you and he brought brother Matt by your
[55:31] way and brother Jared and brother Evans
[55:33] and brother uh Bernard and Vanessa and
[55:36] sister they brought all these people out
[55:38] he showed it he said oh this is so
[55:40] pretty look at their dress
[55:43] but he didn't force him
[55:48] he made you a free moral agent
[55:50] that if you really didn't want Grace
[55:55] how do you explain that
[56:00] the U.S government had to explain that
[56:03] when the man that they were offered part
[56:04] into and the president parted them and
[56:07] the guy brought it back and it wasn't on
[56:08] a stamp you know letterhead from the
[56:11] government and he brought it back and he
[56:12] said you're mocking me
[56:15] for I'm going to give my life for
[56:16] running in the army
[56:18] from the soldiers
[56:19] and they went ahead and killed them and
[56:22] he had a pardon from the president they
[56:24] come up and they had to make a ruling
[56:26] they said apart is only a parted
[56:38] if you'll accept it
[56:41] see Deuteronomy 22 5 where it talks
[56:44] about dress it won't do you one bit of
[56:45] good
[56:46] if you don't accept it
[56:48] you know Hebrews 12 14 without Holiness
[56:53] no matter we'll do you one bit of good
[56:56] if you don't want holiness
[56:57] Malachi four five six and five five and
[57:00] six God will send Elijah to the prophet
[57:02] to reveal all the secrets
[57:09] wow still laying stuff right there
[57:14] wow Matt Lacroix wow
[57:17] that guy must have knew him
[57:21] sister Patty
[57:25] oh
[57:28] before the foundation of the world
[57:33] unbelievable won't do you one bit ago
[57:39] if you come with that and they said what
[57:41] are you trying to mock me for
[57:43] what are you trying to mind
[57:48] wow
[57:49] here let's finish this quotes and all
[57:51] these things and attributes that God had
[57:54] was just so that in the end the Bible
[57:56] would say Jesus said now you will know

[1:00:11] no
[1:00:14] wow
[1:00:18] you see the scripture here let's go to
[1:00:20] Acts 2.
[1:00:23] Acts 2 36 and we'll just see it here
[1:00:26] here it was Grace to the world and we
[1:00:28] know these great scriptures
[1:00:34] let's go to 36 therefore let the house
[1:00:36] of Israel know us surely that that God
[1:00:39] with that has made Jesus whom ye have
[1:00:41] crucified both lowered
[1:00:43] and Christ
[1:00:45] and drop down to 38 and Peter said these
[1:00:47] great words well we go 37 and now they
[1:00:50] heard this and they were pricked in
[1:00:52] their heart and they said unto Peter and
[1:00:54] the rest of the Apostles men and
[1:00:55] brethren
[1:00:57] what shall we do and Peter said those
[1:00:59] words he said unto them repent and be
[1:01:02] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:01:05] the remission of your sins
[1:01:07] and you shall receive the gift
[1:01:10] of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:12] you know this gift all started
[1:01:17] when Christ came in a major
[1:01:22] it all started well I mean it started
[1:01:24] before in the mind of God but it was in
[1:01:26] process when Jesus came
[1:01:32] the gift of the Holy Ghost and This
[1:01:34] Promise is unto you
[1:01:36] and to your children and to all that is
[1:01:39] afar off even in Wyoming to as many as
[1:01:42] the Lord thy God called and many other
[1:01:45] words today testify and exhort saying
[1:01:47] save yourself from this toward
[1:01:50] untoward generation and gladly they
[1:01:54] received the word and gladly
[1:01:57] and gladly they weren't force-fed and
[1:01:59] gladly they received the word of God and
[1:02:01] were baptized and the same day was added
[1:02:03] to the church about them three thousand
[1:02:06] wow
[1:02:07] mad Grace
[1:02:09] you see here
[1:02:12] here John explaining how Grace was
[1:02:16] portrayed let's go to John 16 and just
[1:02:19] laying more laying more down for us see
[1:02:22] Christ couldn't stay here
[1:02:24] In the Flesh you know brother Ben NORAD
[1:02:26] typed it so beautiful like yes Jesus
[1:02:29] came and and he and the great thing was
[1:02:32] he came to die on a cross and pay the
[1:02:34] sins for me but there was something
[1:02:36] really great that happened even before
[1:02:38] that
[1:02:40] just actually
[1:02:43] very great
[1:02:45] he became me he became flesh
[1:02:49] see God became a man
[1:02:52] and so he could understand you
[1:02:55] before he even paid the price for you he
[1:02:57] had to know you
[1:03:01] oh it's beautiful John 16 6 and even
[1:03:05] five he said but now I go my way
[1:03:10] five he said but now I go my way to him
[1:03:14] that sent me and none of you asked me
[1:03:18] whether I go with C watch this as long
[1:03:22] as Christ was here as long as Jesus was
[1:03:25] here and obeyed and grew up in a
[1:03:27] teenager and a boy
[1:03:30] he was only
[1:03:32] in that form
[1:03:35] in that form
[1:03:37] he was only
[1:03:39] wherever he was
[1:03:42] so good things happen
[1:03:45] where he was in that form
[1:03:49] but where he wasn't
[1:03:52] he wasn't
[1:03:54] in that form
[1:03:57] now we know you couldn't put all of God
[1:03:59] in that body
[1:04:00] that's not possible
[1:04:02] so God was other places
[1:04:04] but in the form of Christ
[1:04:06] in flesh
[1:04:09] he could only be one place
[1:04:12] it was wherever he walked
[1:04:15] good things happen
[1:04:17] and then Jesus explains this to the
[1:04:19] disciples
[1:04:20] he said and six
[1:04:24] section six but but because I have said
[1:04:27] these things unto you
[1:04:29] sorrow has filled your heart
[1:04:31] nevertheless I tell you the truth that
[1:04:33] it is expedient
[1:04:36] for you
[1:04:37] that I go away they're like no
[1:04:48] it is expedient that I go away
[1:04:50] for if I go not away
[1:04:53] then you
[1:04:58] the comforter will not come
[1:05:02] but now that I'm going away
[1:05:06] then watch this oh watch this now you
[1:05:10] are the comforter and you are the
[1:05:11] comforter and you are the comforter and
[1:05:13] you are the governor you and you and you
[1:05:15] you you you
[1:05:17] and so you're a whole bunch of places
[1:05:19] now
[1:05:24] but before that he wasn't there
[1:05:28] oh my you see that John 16.
[1:05:33] John 16 7. nevertheless I tell you it's
[1:05:36] expedient I must go quickly
[1:05:42] for you that if I go away
[1:05:45] for if I go not away the comforter it
[1:05:48] won't come
[1:05:50] but if I depart
[1:05:53] you got that up there I will send him
[1:05:59] to you to you and those that are all
[1:06:02] afar off
[1:06:03] and as many as the Lord thy God
[1:06:07] it's called
[1:06:08] and put in my head
[1:06:11] oh my
[1:06:13] Hallelujah
[1:06:16] Hallelujah
[1:06:18] I will send them on to you and then he
[1:06:21] will come
[1:06:22] and he will
[1:06:24] reprove the world
[1:06:27] of sin
[1:06:30] are you Grace this morning
[1:06:35] did you catch that
[1:06:37] but Jesus said it was expedient that I
[1:06:39] go away because if I don't go away you
[1:06:42] can't become like me that's the baptism
[1:06:44] of the Holy Ghost that's called the
[1:06:46] anointed one Christ is called the
[1:06:49] anointed one the Holy Ghost is the
[1:06:51] anointed one
[1:06:52] amen so that's the Holy Ghost so if I
[1:06:55] don't go away then you're not going to
[1:06:56] get the Holy Ghost and so you won't be
[1:06:58] anointed like I am
[1:07:00] en now he I know he was the fullness I
[1:07:03] can't clarify he was the fullness we're
[1:07:05] not the fullness but it's still the
[1:07:07] anointed one
[1:07:10] all right
[1:07:12] and he said but then when he comes hey
[1:07:16] and when he comes who when who comes
[1:07:19] it's not Christ because he's gone what
[1:07:21] is Christ it's not Jesus because he went
[1:07:23] away
[1:07:24] but Christ is the anointed one
[1:07:27] so in the beginning of eight and when he
[1:07:30] comes the Holy Ghost he will reprove the
[1:07:33] world
[1:07:34] of
[1:07:35] sin
[1:07:37] where's the Holy Ghost
[1:07:38] today
[1:07:41] it's not just out there
[1:07:46] no no it's not just out there
[1:07:49] it's guarded
[1:07:52] it's guarded in your heart
[1:07:56] it's guarded in your heart
[1:08:00] you get that
[1:08:02] you see how the the Tabernacle in the
[1:08:04] wilderness it was guarded by the beast
[1:08:07] when Jesus came and they wrote the New
[1:08:10] Testament about Jesus life and history
[1:08:12] it was guarded by the the the the
[1:08:14] Gospels
[1:08:16] the gospel American Luke and John
[1:08:18] guarded acts when acts was going to come
[1:08:21] what's acts the Holy Ghost
[1:08:26] he will reprove the word of sin and
[1:08:29] righteousness
[1:08:31] and of judgment
[1:08:33] listen that's why the Bible says why in
[1:08:37] the world do message people got to fight
[1:08:40] and call up the judge and at the at the
[1:08:43] government courts when you're going to
[1:08:45] judge the world you're already judging
[1:08:47] the world
[1:08:50] did you see it you see it I'm not making
[1:08:52] this up
[1:08:56] the other day there was an example many
[1:08:59] years ago
[1:09:00] excuse me and and there have been
[1:09:04] somebody connected to a church and and
[1:09:06] and the the people connected around that
[1:09:11] had many
[1:09:13] Spirits or issues it wasn't in this
[1:09:16] country was a long ways away and I'm not
[1:09:18] connected or nothing and I'm just trying
[1:09:20] to show you and it was it was around a
[1:09:23] message church and somebody from many
[1:09:25] miles away told me he said the Pastor
[1:09:28] turned up to the authorities and the
[1:09:31] cops
[1:09:40] the Bible tells us
[1:09:46] the Bible says to have Matt's little
[1:09:48] kids
[1:09:49] and Leah and Curtis
[1:09:51] judge the situation
[1:09:54] it says that the little ones the least
[1:09:56] and the littlest among you
[1:09:58] could judge us better than the Earthly
[1:10:01] judges
[1:10:02] and our Lord
[1:10:10] it's because of this verse right here
[1:10:12] John 16 8.
[1:10:15] and righteousness and judgment
[1:10:17] will come from
[1:10:22] you and I will and he will come
[1:10:25] the anointed one Christ
[1:10:28] it'll be Dale Christ it'll be Evans
[1:10:31] Christ it'll be Matt Christ it'll be
[1:10:34] Jared the Holy Ghost the holy spirit
[1:10:37] it's the anointed one are you getting it
[1:10:40] and you will reprove the world of sin
[1:10:43] the world the people in your circle will
[1:10:47] have as much grace
[1:10:49] as you have
[1:10:55] if you go to the Christmas party tonight
[1:10:57] at the Holiness Church and you go there
[1:10:59] with the judgmental and and dynamic
[1:11:02] Spirit that's what will be portrayed out
[1:11:04] to those people
[1:11:07] but if you go with love and kindness let
[1:11:11] me see the attributes long-suffering
[1:11:14] kindness Mercy gentleness
[1:11:20] patience
[1:11:24] by all these things we'll know
[1:11:27] that before the foundation of the world
[1:11:31] before God was God
[1:11:34] and before there was angels
[1:11:37] that you were in his loins
[1:11:41] oh my
[1:11:43] God that's just crazy good
[1:11:47] like that
[1:11:48] but
[1:11:50] now the balance is
[1:11:53] we can only give them
[1:11:56] what Christ give us
[1:12:01] the prophet said in church order and
[1:12:02] Doctrine multiple times
[1:12:05] he said take everything back to the word
[1:12:07] of God
[1:12:08] and run it through
[1:12:10] and this was his absolute Church
[1:12:11] ordering doctor I'd give you the quotes
[1:12:13] for her multiple times dozens of times
[1:12:16] see see the prophet didn't come to write
[1:12:18] a new Bible
[1:12:20] the Bible is already given
[1:12:23] the prophet came
[1:12:24] to reveal the Mysteries what was that
[1:12:26] about the white horse rider
[1:12:28] oh that saved and disguised
[1:12:32] what was that about marriage and divorce
[1:12:34] oh
[1:12:38] what was that about predestination I
[1:12:40] never ever seen my name in the Bible
[1:12:42] before the prophet showed me
[1:12:46] the revealed word
[1:12:48] I I never knew that I always was before
[1:12:50] I came to the rub to to a message that
[1:12:53] God had sent a prophet that was divinely
[1:12:56] inspired of God
[1:12:58] and revealed that I always were
[1:13:04] so see if I show here that your body is
[1:13:08] a temple of the Lord and you don't you
[1:13:11] don't cut holes in it and you don't put
[1:13:14] glue on it and you don't paint it like a
[1:13:16] barn
[1:13:18] and all these things and you say well
[1:13:21] but I do that but you know God don't see
[1:13:23] it because because he sees my heart
[1:13:27] oh
[1:13:29] I'm like
[1:13:31] that she's my heart
[1:13:33] I don't see that
[1:13:38] so then so then
[1:13:41] immediately
[1:13:43] immediately
[1:13:44] I'm not Grace to them
[1:13:48] because because I can't find it in here
[1:13:51] I can't find it in here you know the
[1:13:53] prophet was preaching but I I just love
[1:13:56] our I tell you what
[1:13:59] if you you want to bless your heart get
[1:14:02] an iPad
[1:14:03] or laptop go to questions and answers
[1:14:07] don't listen to it only
[1:14:09] and sit in front of that screen
[1:14:11] and listen to it and watch the words go
[1:14:13] and watch them answer questions
[1:14:16] about this right here
[1:14:24] he's so perfect
[1:14:29] you see it was Christ
[1:14:31] see see watches
[1:14:34] he would say things
[1:14:37] that I
[1:14:38] would disagree
[1:14:41] no I don't
[1:14:42] she almost
[1:14:44] grab onto something
[1:14:47] they asked him can you cut girls hair
[1:14:51] you asked brother Dale so you know
[1:14:57] you thought it was something that was
[1:14:59] good
[1:15:01] they asked him to think and he said
[1:15:03] Grace Grace I'm looking for Grace
[1:15:06] can you cut girl's hair
[1:15:08] can't a woman don't cut your hair woman
[1:15:09] don't cut your hair Gloria's hair is so
[1:15:11] long for a woman
[1:15:14] girl girl child
[1:15:18] he said
[1:15:22] can't find it in here
[1:15:25] he says
[1:15:29] I guess
[1:15:30] if you you know if it's getting in their
[1:15:33] eyes
[1:15:36] and he cut their bangs
[1:15:39] they're just a girl girl
[1:15:48] I guess it would be all right
[1:15:51] I'm like
[1:15:55] a woman cut their hair
[1:15:57] absolutely not I'm not cutting my girl's
[1:15:59] hair I never ever one time cut my girls
[1:16:01] in who's hide the scissors
[1:16:04] okay
[1:16:05] but see the prophet
[1:16:08] our prophet
[1:16:10] is it in here
[1:16:12] can girls cut their hair
[1:16:15] says well woman not to cut their hand
[1:16:18] you see let me give you another example
[1:16:20] you thought I was thinking of something
[1:16:22] else they said I own a Sloan
[1:16:26] and I know it's wrong for women to cut
[1:16:27] their hair can you imagine if I owned a
[1:16:30] slow how many years would come here to
[1:16:32] check
[1:16:34] I know none of these would I wouldn't
[1:16:36] either
[1:16:38] somebody asked brother Brandon my
[1:16:39] questions today it's N64 after the seals
[1:16:41] so he he had all his revelation
[1:16:44] they said I own a saloon and I cut hair
[1:16:47] and I know the message that you teach
[1:16:49] and the Bible says for women not to cut
[1:16:51] their hair
[1:16:54] and I don't believe in cutting hair
[1:16:57] but I cut other people's hair
[1:16:59] they come to me
[1:17:03] I'd say you look for a new job
[1:17:06] you know the prophet never said that
[1:17:09] oh he did it now I'm going to be blind
[1:17:12] honest with you he never actually
[1:17:13] answered that question
[1:17:15] but she said and I
[1:17:18] Merit and they like but she colored hair
[1:17:20] she called it something else
[1:17:22] she called it what do they call it what
[1:17:24] do you call it died okay
[1:17:30] and what do you and he the prophets suck
[1:17:32] well I can show you he never actually
[1:17:35] answered her cutting people's hair that
[1:17:37] came to her but I'm telling you right up
[1:17:40] it's wrong
[1:17:42] but he never answered it
[1:17:45] you see those people came to her for
[1:17:47] that service
[1:17:49] he didn't justify he just didn't touch
[1:17:51] him I'm just telling you what he said
[1:17:55] but regarding color
[1:17:57] you know what he said
[1:18:00] I'll tell you what
[1:18:03] brother Dale's gonna drop the Mets even
[1:18:05] if I don't have Nets the day I come home
[1:18:08] and I see my wife's got blonde hair
[1:18:11] she'll had the first black guy when we
[1:18:13] come to church that you've ever seen
[1:18:16] you know what our Prophet said
[1:18:24] I don't see it in the Bible
[1:18:26] I guess it would be okay to color your
[1:18:27] hat
[1:18:31] I tell you what I'll tell you my
[1:18:32] daughters if you start coloring your
[1:18:34] hair because of that question I think
[1:18:36] you'll be brain dead
[1:18:38] that's what I think be brain cancer
[1:18:41] but they sell the profit finish stock
[1:18:43] it's natural
[1:18:45] for a woman
[1:18:46] the one of them
[1:18:51] you see how perfect
[1:18:54] see so when somebody comes and says
[1:18:57] I can only give you
[1:19:00] what I've been giving
[1:19:03] and that's what's in here
[1:19:09] ain't that amazing
[1:19:10] amazing brother Mike you want your wife
[1:19:12] to start coloring your hair you want her
[1:19:14] to have blue hair
[1:19:15] the prophet said it'll be okay
[1:19:18] I'm like
[1:19:22] really
[1:19:27] that's perfect
[1:19:29] because he had a perfect message
[1:19:31] and it's because it wasn't him
[1:19:33] it came from God
[1:19:36] it came from God
[1:19:38] amen oh I'm sorry
[1:19:41] Grace
[1:19:43] see when Christ came in a Manger
[1:19:46] it was Grace
[1:19:48] because he was the perfect sacrifice
[1:19:52] and when he went away
[1:19:55] he gave that
[1:19:57] job
[1:19:58] to you
[1:20:06] that's that
[1:20:13] we're going to finish this next week
[1:20:15] I'm going to show you the example
[1:20:18] or more than one but one for sure
[1:20:21] somebody in the Bible
[1:20:24] that had sin
[1:20:27] tried to hide it
[1:20:29] it was revealed
[1:20:31] a prophet came and gave him Grace
[1:20:34] he denied the grace
[1:20:36] and on second reconsideration
[1:20:39] he finally accepted it
[1:20:41] and was made pures of living
[1:20:45] amen
[1:20:47] see if the people in your life
[1:20:50] will accept Grace
[1:20:53] that's why your life is so important
[1:20:55] because most people in our day and age
[1:20:58] are on a screen
[1:21:01] you can't hardly buy paper anymore
[1:21:03] voice of God don't even sell paper
[1:21:05] anymore
[1:21:07] they're definitely not reading this
[1:21:08] paper
[1:21:10] the world
[1:21:14] but they're reading you
[1:21:17] and if you got smut on your life
[1:21:21] they have a hard time clarifying whether
[1:21:24] that's Grace
[1:21:26] or bondage
[1:21:30] the world calls it freedom but it's
[1:21:33] bondage
[1:21:39] God help brother Dale
[1:21:42] you know we don't have to judge the
[1:21:44] world
[1:21:46] well if if you're going to judge it like
[1:21:49] Christ would
[1:21:50] the Bible says judge not lest ye be
[1:21:52] judged
[1:21:54] but this
[1:21:56] will do it for you
[1:21:58] like if you walk out of the church
[1:22:00] because
[1:22:01] you don't believe this
[1:22:04] I mean
[1:22:08] well I'm not even I don't even know how
[1:22:11] to answer that
[1:22:12] I I almost said sorry but I'm not sorry
[1:22:16] because see this is this is it
[1:22:19] amen
[1:22:22] amen God help us amen
[1:22:24] the world is walking away
[1:22:27] from it
[1:22:28] you don't think so just go to another
[1:22:30] church and look at pants
[1:22:34] I want any one of you I'm I challenge
[1:22:36] you to come and ask me after who one
[1:22:39] generation
[1:22:40] their grandma wore a dress
[1:22:43] the daughter wore pants the
[1:22:44] granddaughter's gay
[1:22:46] she's sleeping with a woman or a guy
[1:22:50] that's that's saith the word of God
[1:22:56] you know what it is
[1:22:58] our Prophet said
[1:23:01] I tell you I can hardly stop
[1:23:04] it's a perverted spirit
[1:23:09] if it ain't in here more than that it's
[1:23:11] perverted
[1:23:12] if you try to take Grace away from me
[1:23:14] it's perverted because Christ gave it to
[1:23:18] me if you try to wear pants and God
[1:23:20] wanted you to wear a dress it's
[1:23:22] perverted
[1:23:23] it's perverted
[1:23:29] that's the state that our worlds is
[1:23:31] one generation
[1:23:33] perverty
[1:23:38] God help the so-called
[1:23:42] believer
[1:23:48] why don't we recognize this brothers and
[1:23:51] sisters
[1:23:52] brother Matt I don't want to know what
[1:23:54] and I haven't heard nothing I don't want
[1:23:57] to know what they said about you sister
[1:23:58] Patty
[1:23:59] brother I don't it's none of my business
[1:24:03] what God said about you
[1:24:05] you see what I mean
[1:24:07] and Christians are burning up the
[1:24:09] airlines
[1:24:11] did you know did you know
[1:24:15] should we pull up that scripture
[1:24:18] blessed are you
[1:24:20] when the people come to your church for
[1:24:22] a Christmas party and say I heard a lot
[1:24:24] of negative thing about you brother Dale
[1:24:26] and all these accusations and all that
[1:24:30] and Christ says oh praise God he says be
[1:24:34] exceedingly happy
[1:24:36] praise God
[1:24:40] see if I had a clean slate I would have
[1:24:42] had the same character as Christ
[1:24:48] because they stoned the prophets
[1:24:52] called Jesus Baba's about father of the
[1:24:54] devils
[1:24:55] born out of wedlock
[1:24:59] for Verity
[1:25:00] that's what they were calling them
[1:25:04] I feel like I'm in really good company
[1:25:07] really really good company but believers
[1:25:11] watches
[1:25:13] but make Believers I am gonna I am gonna
[1:25:16] try to close
[1:25:17] but make believers
[1:25:20] with itchy years
[1:25:23] that don't want to hear the truth
[1:25:26] and
[1:25:28] and Christ has given them over to a
[1:25:30] strong delusion
[1:25:31] you got a year for all the garbage
[1:25:36] tell me that's juicy tell me that again
[1:25:50] and they'll be lost
[1:25:55] because of them accepting Grace
[1:25:58] they've denied it
[1:26:01] they've denied the very Giver of it
[1:26:03] oh my I I hope
[1:26:07] I tell you what God loves you
[1:26:10] God has God has and has had
[1:26:14] huge plans
[1:26:16] for every living soul in this building
[1:26:19] huge plants
[1:26:21] and he has literally literally operating
[1:26:24] his kingdom
[1:26:26] literally
[1:26:28] through you
[1:26:30] through you sister Patty to where you go
[1:26:33] not building Sarnia and when you go to
[1:26:35] through you he's operating his kingdom
[1:26:41] I thought through you owe you when you
[1:26:43] go to your piano teacher through you
[1:26:46] he's moving you through your piano
[1:26:48] teacher slips
[1:26:49] and God's operating his kingdom
