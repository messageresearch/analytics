[26:55] you know before we go into the word I
[26:57] believe with everything within me with
[27:00] my whole heart and my whole being that
[27:03] many many Believers are missing God
[27:07] missing God a million miles missing God
[27:11] amen a day that the world
[27:14] celebrates Christmas
[27:17] we know we celebrate Jesus birthday
[27:19] today
[27:21] knowing that today's not the day
[27:24] amen knowing today's actually the sun
[27:27] God's birthday
[27:28] or the season of the sun God's birthday
[27:31] amen
[27:33] and we understand all that you don't
[27:34] have to believe that from your church
[27:36] standpoint
[27:37] you can think that brother Dale's crazy
[27:40] you can find that on Google
[27:44] I listen to movies yesterday videos
[27:46] yesterday on Google
[27:48] showed the church ages and how I believe
[27:51] it was Nimrod and and
[27:54] filter traded paganism
[27:56] and the sun god
[27:58] with Christianity to the extreme you can
[28:01] go right and Google the Tabernacle of
[28:03] the temples and a lot of those things
[28:05] are still standing today in ancient
[28:08] cities where the sun god the sun god's
[28:12] picture is at the front and and the Halo
[28:16] is is slights of stone where the stun
[28:20] would shine through the wall of the
[28:22] church and put out a ray of sun
[28:26] thing
[28:28] everything Satan does is to copy the
[28:31] Halo of Christ and and everything amen
[28:33] we know we know Jesus did come
[28:36] and we know it's real and we know it was
[28:39] the greatest plan of God that he came to
[28:42] save the world
[28:43] but we also realize that the world's
[28:45] made it
[28:47] commercialized
[28:48] blended it with paganism
[28:51] and most Christians majority of
[28:54] Christians 99 percent of Christians are
[28:57] falling for it for flying
[28:59] Sinker you know I watch videos
[29:01] everywhere but in the U.S or in North
[29:05] America U.S Canada and Europe
[29:08] they have full-fledged knockout camp
[29:11] meetings I've seen altar calls where
[29:12] there was if there was one person at the
[29:15] altar there was a hundred
[29:17] knockout prayer means not from December
[29:20] 22nd till January 2nd but in North
[29:24] America where it's rich and increased
[29:26] with Goods
[29:27] that they don't need God we don't need
[29:30] God we don't think we need God
[29:32] amen the prophet said to every country
[29:34] the Richer they get the farther they
[29:37] move from God the more educated they get
[29:39] the farther they move from God
[29:41] amen God help us
[29:43] amen
[29:45] but we know in all of that that it's the
[29:47] greatest time to live the greatest times
[29:50] let's turn to Matthew we're just uh
[29:53] speak a few minutes on our message from
[29:55] last Sunday and they're looking forward
[29:57] to next Sunday and we're just gonna kind
[30:00] of a HomeTown uh let your hair down type
[30:04] of a service and share your heart next
[30:06] Sunday and different things and
[30:09] Matthew 1 and verse 22 and 23.
[30:14] this is talking about we talked about
[30:16] living
[30:17] in the thoughts or the mind of God
[30:20] being in the thoughts and mind of God
[30:22] and this is what today represents is God
[30:26] had a plan to save Mankind and bring him
[30:29] back to himself
[30:31] and he came himself in the form of a son
[30:34] to redeem mankind
[30:37] amen the perfect sacrifice
[30:39] amen now all this was done that it might
[30:43] be fulfilled which was spoken of the
[30:45] Lord by the prophets saying Behold a
[30:49] virgin shall be with child and shall
[30:53] bring forth a son and they shall call
[30:56] his name Emmanuel
[30:59] being interpreted
[31:01] God
[31:03] with us
[31:04] we we mentioned last Sunday and and
[31:07] great detail and we've showed that that
[31:10] everything God has done was in his
[31:12] thoughts and his mind before the
[31:14] foundation of the world and and much or
[31:16] all of it is recorded in the Bible and
[31:19] much of it was wrote In Secret form and
[31:22] and God sent his Secrets or identified
[31:26] you may have your seats and God
[31:28] identified his Secrets through His
[31:30] prophets so we could reveal the exact
[31:33] same Bible which God had anointed from
[31:36] the beginning
[31:37] but we would understand it more clearly
[31:40] and we showed that in the prophecy of
[31:42] the Bible it was all grace everything
[31:45] was Grace everything God said that you
[31:48] should do or shouldn't do was Grace it
[31:52] was what you needed to do or not do to
[31:55] have eternal life everything was Grace
[31:57] and we mentioned many many many things
[32:00] and the Bible was Grace and we want to
[32:02] look at one person in the Bible that
[32:05] almost refused Grace
[32:08] and we want to look at another person
[32:10] that did refuse Grace and we want to
[32:14] show it now we want to see you know most
[32:16] of the world is looking at something
[32:19] besides the word of God they're looking
[32:21] either at a man or a church Creed or or
[32:24] what a good man said or or or following
[32:27] it more than what they're following the
[32:28] word of God but we want to follow the
[32:31] complete word of God in in canoe like so
[32:34] with dovetails from the Genesis to
[32:36] Revelation and we know that the Old
[32:39] Testament of the Bible was wrote in
[32:41] types and shadows and not the Old
[32:44] Testament much of it is not directly for
[32:47] us today because it was only a shadow or
[32:50] a poor image of what was actually going
[32:52] to come in perfection in the New
[32:54] Testament the perfect example of that is
[32:57] the sacrifice in the Old Testament they
[32:59] sacrifice lambs and goats which is a
[33:01] very poor quality of the Lamb of God
[33:04] Amen but when the Lamb of God came all
[33:06] the Old Testament sacrifice of lamb and
[33:09] goats was done away with so there's much
[33:12] of the Old Testament much not all but
[33:15] much of the Old Testament was just a
[33:17] type of the perfect that was coming
[33:22] but now that we have the perfect
[33:24] they met so many people are looking at
[33:26] other things
[33:29] for their peace and for their Grace and
[33:32] will be lost in the process amen and we
[33:35] want to look look at his story and it
[33:37] starts in Second Kings 5.
[33:41] amen it talks about a great man here
[33:43] that was the captain of the king of
[33:47] Assyria a man not a Godly Man at all but
[33:51] a great man in his time a great warrior
[33:54] and he had came and had taken over the
[33:57] children of God and taking captives and
[34:00] that man had a type of sin in his life
[34:02] now of course he wasn't a godly man or a
[34:05] Christian man but even non-godly and
[34:08] non-Christian men can receive Grace
[34:11] Even in our day
[34:13] amen and here this this uh
[34:16] non-godly man had captured a Believer a
[34:21] little girl a little mistress and taking
[34:23] it back it's a slave captive and I'm
[34:25] sure if any of us were considered slaves
[34:28] or captives we wouldn't be helping our
[34:31] uh Master slave master uh to uh show
[34:35] Grace or save his life but she showed
[34:38] the true characteristics of Christ
[34:40] like God leaving heaven
[34:43] to come and save you and me
[34:45] an example of today
[34:47] and here in in Second Kings 5 maybe we
[34:51] would read uh verse three and she she
[34:54] was a she said to her mistress she said
[34:56] I would to God that my Lord the with
[34:59] we're with the prophet
[35:01] that was in Syria Samaria Samaria
[35:05] and that he would recover
[35:07] of his sin
[35:09] it was actually leprosy that the nahem
[35:11] had and leprosy was a type of unbelief
[35:15] or sin in the spiritual realm and here
[35:18] in ahem being a great warrior of of uh
[35:22] the the country and of the king he could
[35:25] not relay his sin to the people and if
[35:29] you take that physical to spiritual see
[35:31] in the natural if the if his soldiers
[35:34] knew he had leprosy they would put him
[35:36] in the leprosy Colony if he would have
[35:39] got completely lost his job if any of
[35:41] the people in the town or the press or
[35:43] the government or even the king himself
[35:46] would have knew he had leprosy
[35:48] he would have been completely denounced
[35:50] to nothing
[35:52] and like they have most of us today if
[35:55] we have sin in our life we try to hide
[35:57] it
[35:58] so we don't get denounced and he hid and
[36:01] covered up his sin but a girl this
[36:03] mistress that lived right in the
[36:05] household
[36:06] seen him
[36:08] when his shirt was off
[36:10] see he would wear long sleeves and high
[36:12] snacks and that and he would cover up
[36:14] his leprosy
[36:16] so the world couldn't see his skin
[36:18] because his sin was polluted
[36:21] with sin
[36:24] and here
[36:26] this man found they they rehearsed the
[36:30] words of the maid can you imagine the
[36:32] maid just picture this can you imagine
[36:35] the maid a Slave
[36:37] probably raped molested beat dragged
[36:42] tied up handcuffed
[36:45] rode in the army camp you can only
[36:47] imagine what happened to her
[36:50] sold for the highest price to this great
[36:52] man he had lots of money probably she
[36:55] was beautiful because he was with the
[36:58] captain
[37:00] of the host of the army
[37:06] can you imagine through all that
[37:09] she showed Mercy
[37:12] to a man that probably
[37:15] had raped her
[37:17] probably had handcuffed her
[37:19] probably had beat her
[37:22] and had bought her like property
[37:24] like a dog or a cow
[37:28] that's amazing
[37:30] and that's a perfect type
[37:33] of what Christ did
[37:35] for us
[37:37] Christ left the Splendor of Heaven
[37:42] to get spit on
[37:45] to have his beard pulled
[37:47] to get whipped and beat
[37:50] for you
[37:52] and for me even when he left the
[37:55] Splendor of Heaven can you imagine the
[37:58] ground the downgrade it would have been
[38:01] coming to A Manger
[38:03] and a stable
[38:04] in a barn
[38:07] not even no room for him and a common
[38:10] decent home
[38:12] where birth
[38:13] would been performed
[38:15] and this is a perfect type and they've
[38:18] heard the words of this maid and so they
[38:21] went and told it to the king of Syria
[38:24] the captain of the host's boss
[38:28] and they portrayed it and so the king of
[38:30] Syria being that he could buy his way
[38:33] into heaven
[38:35] and by his way to Salvation a lot of
[38:37] Believers believe that too
[38:40] that's why they closed their churches on
[38:42] days like today the rich people but the
[38:45] poor people are there by the thousands
[38:48] in open churches the king is Syria said
[38:51] go to the king of Israel
[38:53] now remember they had
[38:55] beat the king of Israel in war and
[38:58] brought their people back its slaves
[39:01] so they're going to the very country
[39:02] that they had invaded
[39:04] and brought slaves back said go to the
[39:07] king of Syria and he took ten talents of
[39:10] silver 6
[39:11] 000 pieces of gold that would have been
[39:13] worth a fair bit of coin today and 10
[39:16] changes of ramens
[39:18] see he was trying to buy his salvation
[39:23] for nahab his Top Dog King
[39:28] man in the army
[39:32] and the king of Israel
[39:36] being
[39:37] a human being being an honest man God
[39:40] bless you brother Fred and Merry
[39:42] Christmas being an honest man and a a
[39:45] human man when he when he realized that
[39:48] the king of Syria had sent him this
[39:52] these gifts and asked for such a
[39:54] ridiculous thing that no way in the
[39:57] world could anybody heal leprosy no one
[40:01] in the world could ever take away sin
[40:03] until Christ Jesus came in a Manger amen
[40:07] no one could do this he says what does
[40:10] he think I am does he think I'm a God
[40:14] that I could heal leprosy but there was
[40:18] a prophet in the land of Israel
[40:20] amen God had Kings but God had a prophet
[40:23] and his first and perfect way was
[40:25] prophets God never desired for Israel to
[40:27] have a king but God had a prophet called
[40:30] Elisha and he heard what the king had
[40:33] done in Israel actually the King when he
[40:36] heard that Syria had sent this money and
[40:38] was trying to buy their way into heaven
[40:41] trying to buy their way out of sin and
[40:43] tried to buy their way that's what the
[40:45] world's doing
[40:46] what do you think they're doing sending
[40:48] billions billions with the B hundreds of
[40:51] billions to fight armies and buy other
[40:53] people off around the world our Prophet
[40:56] said you can't buy your friends
[40:58] the states don't realize that yet or
[41:01] most governments they send countries
[41:03] that are depressed and and and and and
[41:06] they take advantage of and they'll send
[41:08] them gifts to pacify them
[41:11] amen they're leaders it'll never work
[41:15] and here the king of Israel when he
[41:17] realized that he had these gifts and he
[41:20] knew that in his own power he could
[41:22] never save mankind he could never save
[41:24] nahem of leprosy he rent his clothes and
[41:28] went into mourning but the prophet of
[41:30] God heard about this and he wasn't
[41:33] operating under the flesh he wasn't
[41:35] operating under fear he wasn't operating
[41:38] under the trend of the day and he wasn't
[41:40] operating under the trend where hundreds
[41:43] of message churches would be closed on
[41:45] Christmas he was operating under the
[41:48] anointing and power of God and here the
[41:50] Prophet Elijah heard what the king of
[41:52] Israel had run his clothes and he said
[41:55] to the king he said send that man
[41:59] to me
[42:01] send him to me that was no fear involved
[42:04] in that that that command there was no
[42:07] fear at all and so nahem came with his
[42:10] horses and his riches and all of his
[42:13] gold and silver and he came with his
[42:16] best Cadillac Chariot can you imagine it
[42:18] had it had ceramic gold knobs and roll
[42:21] up Windows and
[42:24] all these things
[42:27] and he stood outside the door
[42:30] of the house of God
[42:32] you know never before in the history of
[42:35] the world has Christ been on the outside
[42:38] of Ben's hearts and but on the outside
[42:41] of the church knocking never once in the
[42:43] church ages but in today's day was
[42:46] Christ on the outside of the church
[42:48] knocking trying to get in the very
[42:49] building he owned
[42:51] but the people didn't want no part to do
[42:53] with them because they loved the Pagan
[42:56] worship better
[42:58] then they loved the Christian worship
[43:00] that'll never be more relevant than it
[43:02] is rake today
[43:05] if this church was in any country but
[43:08] North America or the UK
[43:10] that well it
[43:13] there'd be people on the walls
[43:18] because they're not caught up in Pagan
[43:20] worship
[43:21] and they're not rich and increased with
[43:23] goods and here here the prophet
[43:27] knew he was on the outside
[43:33] but he didn't treat him
[43:36] with the modern day politics
[43:38] that's in most churches and governments
[43:41] today
[43:42] he didn't treat him any different see
[43:44] the Bible says that if you treat
[43:46] somebody different that's got a gold
[43:48] ring that somebody in gay clothing than
[43:50] somebody that don't that it's a sin
[43:53] and you're guilty of the whole law which
[43:55] is the word of God
[43:57] amen
[43:59] so here Elijah
[44:01] never the prophet he never even went out
[44:04] to greet him
[44:05] you might say that he never had the gift
[44:08] of hospitality
[44:12] can you imagine can you imagine if the
[44:15] president or the the leader well it
[44:17] wouldn't be nothing to have the leader
[44:18] of our country but the leader of most
[44:20] countries come to your house and you
[44:22] just have the kids answer the door
[44:25] amen
[44:27] this was also a country that had beat up
[44:30] on them
[44:31] and probably could have did it
[44:34] again
[44:38] and the prophet says in verse 9 it said
[44:41] that the prophet sent a messenger onto
[44:43] him and said go down to the river
[44:48] and dip seven times
[44:51] see seven times is perfection
[44:54] seven you look in the Bible everything
[44:56] to do with seven was God in Perfection
[44:58] and the fullness he said dip seven times
[45:01] in your flesh will become clean I want
[45:04] to show you something this morning just
[45:05] like the prophecy we read earlier in
[45:09] Matthew where it says now all this was
[45:11] done that it might be fulfilled which
[45:13] was spoken of the lord of the Lord
[45:17] by the prophets
[45:19] but all this was done including this
[45:22] which was just spoke by Elisha to nahab
[45:27] behold that Nahum could be clean
[45:31] if he would just follow the word of the
[45:34] Lord
[45:35] spoken
[45:36] by a prophet most people
[45:39] don't want nothing to do with that
[45:43] amen and I'm not just talking about a
[45:45] major prophet but even a man of God
[45:47] people today in North America and most
[45:50] of the world are unteachable where God's
[45:53] concerned there's I seen a post the
[45:56] other day and see most people and I
[45:58] might share more of that next week but
[46:01] most people have a damage of God in
[46:03] their mind
[46:04] and they're unteachable to be changed
[46:07] past that
[46:09] and here Elijah
[46:11] said you just this was prophecy
[46:14] he said you go down to the river Jordan
[46:16] it was a dirty muddy river probably had
[46:19] crocodiles and catfish in the bottom and
[46:22] there was nothing clean there was no
[46:23] sand or stone around there
[46:25] no see in the bottom
[46:29] but the prophecy was
[46:33] you dip seven times
[46:35] and when you come up the seventh time
[46:37] you'll be cleaned
[46:39] and naham this he answered this like
[46:42] most Believers today when you try to
[46:44] show them the word of God and try to
[46:45] show them the balance of what God
[46:47] Vindicated through a Vindicated prophet
[46:50] and show them the secrets of the word
[46:51] Nam was Wrath and went away and said
[46:54] behold I thought surely he had come out
[46:57] and put on a Big Show and stand before
[46:59] me this is verse 11 and call on the name
[47:02] of the Lord and strike his hand over the
[47:05] place
[47:06] and I would recover in a miraculous
[47:09] Miracle that's what most people are
[47:10] looking for that's called Hollywood
[47:13] and it's not real
[47:16] amen God wants you to humble yourself
[47:18] and come to prayer meeting and and
[47:20] anything that anybody got from God they
[47:23] had to strive and and labor for
[47:26] amen anything that anybody got from God
[47:29] and behold the the the naham's servant
[47:33] said now listen
[47:35] you got leprosy
[47:37] and you're going to hell
[47:42] all you got to do is accept Christ Jesus
[47:45] as your savior
[47:46] and you'll go to heaven
[47:51] sounds pretty simple to me
[47:54] but the Bible says that the way to
[47:56] destruction to hell is Broad
[47:59] that means like me wide
[48:02] and the way through eternal life
[48:05] is very narrow
[48:08] God help us he said see all you got to
[48:11] do now is just go down to that River
[48:14] and you will be saved for life
[48:17] you'll keep your job you'll keep your
[48:20] prestige you'll keep your bank pension
[48:22] you'll keep your bank paycheck the king
[48:25] will probably promote you you'll be the
[48:27] right-hand man of the leader
[48:31] but because you're too fat-headed
[48:34] and couldn't listen to a prophet
[48:37] which is the New Testament a prophets a
[48:39] minister
[48:40] because you couldn't listen to somebody
[48:42] tell you the truth
[48:44] and you got a picture of God in your
[48:46] mind and you got a picture of how you
[48:48] were going to be popular and he was
[48:50] going to come out and do a Big Show and
[48:52] wave his stick and call on the name of
[48:54] the Lord see because God didn't do it
[48:57] like you thought God should do it you're
[48:59] just not going to believe him at all
[49:04] and he turned to go home
[49:06] but his servants bidded and begged with
[49:09] them
[49:10] amen and at the last moment
[49:15] because because only
[49:18] of his servants
[49:20] and it's let me read that in 13 He said
[49:22] and his servants came near to him and
[49:24] spank unto him and said my father
[49:26] if the prophet had bid you to do a great
[49:28] thing thus would have done it but how
[49:31] much rather than when he saith unto thee
[49:33] they just go and watch and be clean
[49:36] you know if the many of the rich people
[49:38] and the great people of our day in the
[49:39] in the country and the history and all
[49:41] that if God would ask them to do
[49:43] something great where they would have
[49:44] been on TV and been really popular and
[49:47] there would have been a big show
[49:49] they would have converted to
[49:50] Christianity
[49:55] but because it was just a humble little
[49:57] bride
[49:58] in many of the ages just two or eight
[50:02] or just a handful
[50:06] and it wasn't popular like Hollywood
[50:09] even though it was simple
[50:12] they've refused to do it but because of
[50:14] his servant he went down and he did dip
[50:17] seven times
[50:19] and he followed the prophecy of the
[50:22] Bible like all prophecies that were
[50:24] supposed to follow that are for our our
[50:26] Grace for our life
[50:29] and he followed that
[50:32] as God had said
[50:34] see the Bible says as the lord gave to
[50:38] the prophets to say
[50:40] see when a minister or a prophet
[50:42] speaking it's if it's a if it's a man of
[50:44] God it's not that man speaking
[50:47] it's the lord gave him to speak
[50:50] that's what the Bible said
[50:53] and he went down and he washed and his
[50:56] flesh was clean
[50:58] as is a child
[51:01] and he was made completely
[51:03] whole
[51:05] just
[51:06] by hairs he would have refused Grace
[51:11] but because of his servants bagging and
[51:14] pleading with him
[51:16] said it's so simple
[51:18] and this world will go to hell in a
[51:21] handbasket
[51:22] because Christ made it simple to go to
[51:25] heaven
[51:29] literally
[51:31] just as simple as humbling yourself
[51:34] and saying saved me I was wrong I can't
[51:36] do it on my own
[51:39] it would go to world I want to look at
[51:40] another one and we're going to close
[51:42] here just very soon just another closing
[51:45] another one and the and the ending is
[51:46] not near as happy
[51:49] is the last one and that's a rich young
[51:51] ruler and if you would turn to mark this
[51:53] is recorded in four or five places in
[51:55] the Bible
[51:57] but I like Mark the best because of one
[52:00] part but it said that this certain man
[52:02] came running onto Jesus this was right
[52:04] after the disciples had tried to move
[52:07] the children away from Jesus and Jesus
[52:09] had said unless you become his children
[52:11] you won't inherit the kingdom of heaven
[52:13] and a certain man it was a Rich Young
[52:15] Ruler it came out to him to Jesus and
[52:17] said Master good Master how so I inherit
[52:20] eternal life and Jesus said unto them in
[52:23] Mark 10 18 He said why call us out be
[52:26] good for there's none good but God
[52:29] he was questioning him to see if he
[52:31] would recognize him as God and he said
[52:34] thou knows the Commandments do not
[52:36] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[52:38] do not bear false witness nor to defraud
[52:41] your neighbor
[52:42] and honor your father and mother and the
[52:45] Rich Young Ruler said he said he
[52:47] answered and said master I have observed
[52:49] these all
[52:51] from my youth now this is the reason I
[52:53] picked Mark over the other gospels that
[52:55] had recorded this and in Mark 10 21 it
[52:59] says and Jesus beholding him
[53:04] loved him
[53:07] Jesus loved the world enough
[53:11] to come
[53:12] to a Manger
[53:15] and be born as a babe
[53:17] be raised by parents that were accused
[53:19] of
[53:20] having him before marriage
[53:24] be called the belzeba and the father of
[53:26] devils
[53:29] be spit and beat and brute upon
[53:34] the Bible says he came unto his own and
[53:37] his very own refused and his own
[53:39] received them not
[53:41] it was his very own family it was his
[53:44] very own people you might say it was his
[53:46] very own town that hung him on the cross
[53:49] and killed them
[53:51] and hear the the the Jesus seeing this
[53:55] Rich Young Ruler
[53:58] loved them you see he would have been a
[54:01] perfect clean Christian
[54:04] you say how can you say that well he
[54:06] said that he had done all the
[54:07] Commandments from his youth
[54:10] amen
[54:11] but he would have been the type of like
[54:13] the five foolish virgins that were
[54:15] perfectly clean but never had the Holy
[54:18] Ghost
[54:21] and Jesus said unto him he said one
[54:23] thing thou lack us
[54:26] you still love the world
[54:30] now it's very permanent this morning
[54:32] when you see how few
[54:35] it just is
[54:37] don't believe I you know my brother June
[54:39] from the Philippines was just here and
[54:40] Leo's preaching in the capital of Uganda
[54:43] is around the world thousands of people
[54:45] thousands hundreds I said something to
[54:49] brother June I said you know
[54:52] people here normally close their church
[54:54] for Christmas
[54:56] brother June told me he said this was
[54:59] his one sentence he said
[55:01] we don't do Christmas here
[55:09] I have one question for you on that
[55:11] answer
[55:12] how are those people going to the same
[55:14] Heaven that the ones here
[55:16] close their Church
[55:18] I can answer that for you
[55:21] they're not
[55:24] they're not
[55:26] the ones here that say they're message
[55:28] Believers and they close their Church
[55:30] and the other message Believers that are
[55:32] actually following God and they don't
[55:33] even do the Pagan worship
[55:36] and they have camp meeting they're not
[55:38] going to the same happen
[55:40] no
[55:41] they're not going
[55:43] you see that just saith the word of God
[55:45] because the Bible says there will be
[55:47] many
[55:48] surprises
[55:49] and many will come to me in my day and
[55:51] say Lord Lord didn't I do this and this
[55:54] and this and this not only goes to
[55:56] church a few times
[56:00] the Bible says forsake not the summoning
[56:02] of yourself together all the more as you
[56:04] see the world like today
[56:08] he said well I did everything but that
[56:10] one verse
[56:13] and he'll say well if you see if you
[56:15] defraud in this one part
[56:18] then you're guilty of the whole law
[56:21] if you defraud in one prophecy then
[56:24] you're guilty of the whole law
[56:26] and here Jesus answered he said thou
[56:28] lack us in one way he said sell whatever
[56:31] thou Hast
[56:33] and give it to the poor
[56:35] and then you come
[56:37] and you shall have Treasures in Heaven
[56:40] and follow me
[56:43] and he said
[56:45] he was sad at the same
[56:49] see he would have his riches for
[56:53] possibly a hundred years
[56:55] but eternal life would have no end
[56:59] so he factors he sacrificed a few years
[57:03] to
[57:04] Millions
[57:06] and millions
[57:08] and billions
[57:10] and then billions of billions of
[57:12] billions of years
[57:18] he said he was sad at the saying and
[57:20] went away grieved for he had great
[57:25] possessions and Jesus looked around
[57:27] about and saith unto your disciples it
[57:30] is harder it is hardly
[57:32] how hardly
[57:34] so they that have riches
[57:36] enter
[57:38] the kingdom of God
[57:40] now that that's that's read in the Bible
[57:44] how hardly shall those that have riches
[57:46] enter the kingdom of God
[57:50] see that's eminent
[57:55] right now
[58:00] man those that have eyes can see
[58:04] that God's given ice and those that have
[58:06] God's ears can hear let's stand
[58:10] thank you Lord all the prophecies in the
[58:13] word of God
[58:15] we're given by the Lord
[58:17] given by the Lord
[58:19] spoken by a man
[58:22] for our Grace
[58:25] given by the Lord
[58:27] spoken by a man
[58:29] given for our Grace oh that's amazing
[58:33] for he alone is Worthy
[58:38] we'll sing the courses of that
[58:43] foreign

[1:00:55] Name
[1:00:56] thank you Lord Jesus I want to tell you
[1:00:58] something this morning church
[1:01:01] everything you see with your natural eye
[1:01:05] is false
[1:01:07] and everything you see with your
[1:01:09] spiritual eye
[1:01:11] is thousands and thousands and thousands
[1:01:16] of times
[1:01:17] more true
[1:01:19] than you can see
[1:01:24] thousands
[1:01:26] God help us to keep our priorities
[1:01:28] straight the Bible says to lay up for
[1:01:31] Treasures where moth and rust will not
[1:01:33] corrupt thieves will not break through
[1:01:35] and steal
[1:01:37] amen I'll tell you everything you could
[1:01:40] see you know
[1:01:42] on a new show and a thing I have the
[1:01:44] thing I might read more last week
[1:01:46] but they're still refusing to let out
[1:01:48] the files
[1:01:50] of
[1:01:52] Kennedy's assassination
[1:01:54] and now they have had people that have
[1:01:57] read the files
[1:01:58] come forth and say it was the government
[1:02:01] that assassinated the president
[1:02:05] and that person that read the files said
[1:02:09] he said now listen to me
[1:02:12] he said everything you believe
[1:02:15] is false
[1:02:17] everything
[1:02:19] you believe is false
[1:02:25] this world is garbage
[1:02:28] everything in this world is completely
[1:02:30] you have to live here
[1:02:32] but don't put your roots down too far
[1:02:36] because everything
[1:02:39] is false
[1:02:41] I have a video on my phone where it says
[1:02:43] the whole world is operated by six
[1:02:47] Jesuit priests
[1:02:49] and everything is controlled
[1:02:53] by them
[1:02:56] and their head
[1:02:57] is Lucifer
[1:03:00] amen
[1:03:02] amen unbelievable
[1:03:04] we we think we get a new leader and
[1:03:06] everything will be fixed or we get a new
[1:03:08] this no no they're all puppets it's all
[1:03:11] false everything is false
[1:03:14] it's controlled by Satan
[1:03:17] but everything you see with your
[1:03:19] spiritual eye
[1:03:20] you know I knew a brother that was going
[1:03:22] blind actually went to the Workman man
[1:03:25] and he was going blind he was an old man
[1:03:28] 80 mid 80s and I remember we had just
[1:03:31] got married you none of you know me died
[1:03:33] before any of these were born
[1:03:35] and he was going storm blind and we were
[1:03:37] going there and Luanne said something to
[1:03:40] him about his eyesight and he said my
[1:03:42] physical eyesight
[1:03:44] is gone or very dim
[1:03:47] but he said my spiritual eyesight is
[1:03:50] better than it's ever been before
[1:03:53] God help me
