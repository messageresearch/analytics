[32:43] &gt;&gt; And I'm not one that travel from country
[32:45] to country to preach. If the Lord didn't
[32:48] send me, I'm not going.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Right. But he has a special purpose here
[32:53] this morning.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; We shall see the move of God.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[33:01] bow my head to pray a sharp headache
[33:04] just bam.

[33:10] and immediately I know it is an attack
[33:12] of the devil. Yes.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; And I say, Satan, in the name of Jesus,
[33:18] &gt;&gt; take your filthy hands off my head.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; And I must report immediately.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; It disappeared.
[33:28] [Applause]
[33:35] &gt;&gt; Disappeared immediately. But we're going
[33:36] to have a special service today.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; I mean, special Thank you.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; The Lord showed me few persons there
[33:46] that we're going to pray with
[33:48] &gt;&gt; and their requests will be answered by
[33:50] God.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Can Barbara want to sing before I give
[33:54] you a testimony?
[33:56] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[42:19] &gt;&gt; have a wonderful
[42:20] &gt;&gt; camp meeting this season. Wonderful.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; I appreciate every one of us that yield
[42:27] ourselves to the
[42:28] &gt;&gt; purpose of God.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; You know, it was more than a gathering,
[42:33] but it was purpose being fulfilled.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:38] And I I said often times I don't believe
[42:41] in coincidence.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; It wasn't a coincidence when I met
[42:47] Brother Steve and sister
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Judy.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Judy.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Is it Judy or Trudy?
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Trudy.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Judy. It wasn't a coincidence.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; It was predestinated by
[43:01] [Applause]
[43:03] &gt;&gt; I met other persons here.
[43:05] Is that brother Steve there and it was
[43:08] wasn't a coincidence
[43:10] &gt;&gt; and I met Ken and Ronda.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Wasn't a coincidence.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; You talk about people with sweet spirit.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Come again to meet you and be a part of
[43:22] you and
[43:23] &gt;&gt; things are happening.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; God has been speaking to us.
[43:29] God is being when you talk about the
[43:32] blessing of the Lord, just don't talk
[43:33] about he touch you on the shoulder or he
[43:36] give you a fresh anointing.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; He meets you. He deals with the
[43:41] situations
[43:43] &gt;&gt; that we have around us.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; Often times you may go want to go in the
[43:48] presence of the Lord and you know just
[43:51] just your past trying to surface
[43:54] &gt;&gt; its ugly head,
[43:56] &gt;&gt; right? Yeah. You know, and the Holy
[43:58] Spirit is just reminding you just
[44:01] believe.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; Just believe.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; No better place I could have been but
[44:10] where the body of Christ is.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; This is the body of Christ.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; And I must say, thank you, brother Dale.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; You're being a fine pastor.
[44:24] Honestly, we're being a fine pasture and
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Sister Luan just great that you know
[44:31] you're being there. You fed us
[44:34] &gt;&gt; well.
[44:36] And brother Dale, he he loves people and
[44:40] I picked out of his spirit.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; He has a love for the people.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; I preached one time and it says not
[44:49] because you can work on the farm doesn't
[44:52] mean that you can manage it. That's
[44:53] right.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Not because you can preach doesn't mean
[44:57] that you can pastor.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the pastor may not be the
[45:03] brightest person in the group.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; But that's who God chose.
[45:08] [Applause]
[45:10] &gt;&gt; When you understand predestination, then
[45:12] sometimes we think different because
[45:15] &gt;&gt; here you are and it's God's
[45:18] &gt;&gt; it's God's will.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah,
[45:21] &gt;&gt; that brother Daily should be here,
[45:23] pastor.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; And it's it was God's purpose.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Elijah be at Brook Sherid. I've got some
[45:31] birds to feed you.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; There were not the cleanest birds, the
[45:35] best birds,
[45:36] &gt;&gt; but it's God's work.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; And so your pastor may preach two hours
[45:42] and you just get five minutes out of it.
[45:44] Praise the Lord.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. He may read a whole book
[45:49] and you just get a verse.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; That's what God want for you today.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; God never sent Elijah to fall in love
[45:58] with those ravens.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; No.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; God said, "Open your mouth and take the
[46:02] food."
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; I'm saying something to us this morning.
[46:10] When God sent Elijah some probably 84
[46:13] miles north to uh to to
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Zeraphat,
[46:18] &gt;&gt; I've commanded a widow woman to sustain
[46:21] you.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; God never said, "I'm sending you to
[46:24] convert the widow woman."
[46:27] &gt;&gt; You just go and and get my sustenance.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; You know, God converted me. And you know
[46:34] why?
[46:36] He told he I realized that I God never
[46:39] sent me to be the potter.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; I'm just a clay like anybody else.
[46:45] [Applause]
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Pastor, you're not the potter.
[46:49] &gt;&gt; You just yield yourself for God to use
[46:51] you.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; God taught me that I'm not the Holy
[46:54] Ghost.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; I need the Holy Ghost.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[47:01] And so, you know, just just don't rush
[47:04] me because you don't even know if you're
[47:06] going to see me again.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; No.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; But God sent me here today for
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Hy,
[47:12] [Applause]
[47:12] [Music]
[47:15] &gt;&gt; God told me, "Call your name to me, Hy."
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Where is Jeff?
[47:20] &gt;&gt; God sent me here for Jeff, too.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Sister Patty, is that you?
[47:25] &gt;&gt; God gave me a word for you. I got to do
[47:27] what God
[47:28] &gt;&gt; is good.
[47:30] There was a let me give you a testimony.
[47:33] You know there is a group of people that
[47:36] would meet some two hours away from our
[47:38] place close to the ocean. They meet like
[47:41] at a public library on a bench and they
[47:43] would read their Bibles.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Oh wow.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; And they have no building.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; But there's a body there.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; And I baptized some there. I went in the
[47:53] area where witnessing and it's like you
[47:56] walk through a riverbed to go up there.
[47:58] And
[47:59] &gt;&gt; if if rain falls,
[48:02] &gt;&gt; you walk in mud as thick as a foot.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; But you still got to go. And
[48:07] &gt;&gt; you talk about a bad place that most
[48:09] people wouldn't go. But guys up there
[48:11] smoking and helping me setting up the
[48:13] things for service.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; And they were like, "Pastor, this don't
[48:18] bother you." I said, "Do you think
[48:20] &gt;&gt; I'm here to preach the word?"
[48:22] &gt;&gt; They're burning their thing. And you
[48:25] know if you if you pay attention to
[48:27] their clothes they're shot me here
[48:30] &gt;&gt; their firearm and I don't see that and
[48:33] I'm preaching there and they would sit
[48:35] on stones there for the old service
[48:41] &gt;&gt; wow
[48:42] &gt;&gt; and I don't go up there and talk and try
[48:45] to clean them.
[48:47] Christ said you are clean through the
[48:48] word
[48:50] &gt;&gt; and I baptized a few there and you talk
[48:54] about people with free spirit. I mean
[48:56] I've seen the power of God move. A man
[48:58] was diagnosed with cancer and he was in
[49:01] the house
[49:02] &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit just spoke his
[49:05] condition and he was in the house and we
[49:08] didn't see
[49:09] &gt;&gt; and you know all of that. So these group
[49:11] of people they would meet in the public
[49:14] park and they would read their Bibles
[49:15] and this particular day one Saturday
[49:18] they were there you know reading and
[49:21] that's how I get to baptize people just
[49:24] go to them and say what are you reading
[49:26] and this particular day they were
[49:28] reading Acts chapter 2 together no
[49:31] preachers are there but they're just sat
[49:33] in the sweet presence of God just moving
[49:37] &gt;&gt; and there is a young man about 28 29
[49:39] walk up to them and says, you know, he
[49:42] was there admiring the people. They they
[49:45] don't know where he came from.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; And he walked up to them and he says,
[49:50] "Please, um, you know,
[49:54] I got a dream sometimes ago, probably 4
[49:56] days before." He said, "I dream seeing a
[49:59] short man." And he described the man in
[50:02] the vision in the dream vision. And the
[50:05] the lady, hello, the lady says, "I know
[50:08] exactly who you're dreaming." See,
[50:11] &gt;&gt; and she said, "I'm going to call him
[50:13] right now."
[50:14] &gt;&gt; And she called my number and she said,
[50:16] "Brother Bartley, there's a man here
[50:18] says the Lord send him to you."
[50:21] &gt;&gt; I said, "I'm 2 hours away that
[50:24] Saturday." So the Sunday morning, I got
[50:26] up and I said, "Barbara, I'm going."
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; And I drove two hours. I took brother
[50:31] Baker with me
[50:32] &gt;&gt; and I drove 2 hours and when the man saw
[50:35] me he said he's not a Christian
[50:39] &gt;&gt; but he said God showed me in the vision
[50:42] &gt;&gt; and he said this is who God showed me.
[50:44] He said God tell me in the dream that
[50:47] you must baptize me in the name of Jesus
[50:50] Christ.
[50:54] And I drove over to the ocean and you
[50:57] know and I I I I took him into the water
[51:01] and I don't know his name. I don't know
[51:04] where he came from.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; I just yield myself to what God said.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; This is not about me. I'm talking about
[51:13] predestination.
[51:15] And uh when I took him to the water and
[51:18] the you know when I baptized him in the
[51:20] name of Jesus, he rose up screaming,
[51:23] "I'm free. I'm free. I'm free."
[51:29] &gt;&gt; He says, he says, "I know there was
[51:32] something that I needed."
[51:35] &gt;&gt; And after he he works on a ship.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; He just came to Jamaica on the ship. And
[51:40] while he was coming on the ship, God
[51:43] gave him the vision.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; And oh, hallelujah.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; And when I baptized him and amen, I
[51:50] hugged him and I put my hands on him
[51:53] because the Bible says uh Paul the
[51:56] Apostle laid his hands on them in
[51:58] Ephesus. That's right.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; And they received the Holy Spirit.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; And I laid my hands on him and I said,
[52:04] "Receive the Holy Ghost."
[52:07] And I when I departed, I never see him
[52:09] again.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; I don't need to see him again.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; I never sent him to a church.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; I have no church to send him to.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; I send this soul to glory.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; That's how God works.
[52:31] And he's still working the same today
[52:35] &gt;&gt; as he was yesterday.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Not because you're Abram seed doesn't
[52:41] mean that you are the children.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Not because you believe the message
[52:45] doesn't mean that you are the wife of
[52:47] Christ.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Whoa. That's strong, isn't it?
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Not all believers are the
[52:54] wife of Christ. All right.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; When God sent his message to put us,
[52:59] Glory to God, putting us to become the
[53:02] word in flesh,
[53:04] &gt;&gt; now the word is in flesh.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; And people rejecting the son of man
[53:09] again.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; He was a son of man.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Introducing
[53:15] or declaring the son of man.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Christ and his wife become one.
[53:21] vision of man
[53:24] &gt;&gt; manifesting the sons of God
[53:27] &gt;&gt; who creation has been waiting for
[53:30] &gt;&gt; creation hasn't been waiting for
[53:32] preachers
[53:33] &gt;&gt; creation has been waiting for the son of
[53:36] god
[53:38] &gt;&gt; to bring back the power and the
[53:40] authority of almighty god
[53:43] &gt;&gt; glory to god
[53:45] &gt;&gt; not all who believed in Jesus were
[53:47] disciples
[53:49] &gt;&gt; not all who lived in Israel were Jews.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Not all who were children of Abram and
[53:58] the flesh there were seed.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; No.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; You talk about a group of men that would
[54:04] radical Jesus teaching.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; But it takes a woman married five
[54:09] married and divorced five times
[54:12] &gt;&gt; and living with a man that wasn't him or
[54:14] hers. And when the presence of God met
[54:18] her,
[54:19] &gt;&gt; she said, "Sir, I perceive you're a
[54:21] prophet."
[54:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I perceive you're a prophet.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Religions turn him away.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; But the true seed of Abraham,
[54:32] &gt;&gt; you cannot turn away the truth
[54:35] &gt;&gt; because that's what made us free.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Who the son set free is freed thee.
[54:43] Oh God, I'm excited.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; I'm a part of the family of God.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; I saw this weekend in the camp when
[54:53] labors of church were destroyed.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; God took the labors off the churches
[55:00] &gt;&gt; and people came together in one spirit
[55:04] realizing glory to God that he's the
[55:08] same yesterday, today, and forever. I've
[55:12] seen it this weekend.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Can I start preaching?
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Let us stand together.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; We're going to read Colossians chapter
[55:25] 3.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Jim.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Appreciate it. I appreciate you all. But
[55:38] there's something that God is just
[55:40] giving us in this end time. And
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; You know, the board is placed for a
[55:46] rightander,
[55:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:48] &gt;&gt; But luckily, I am a left-hander.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; So, I got to put it where I still that
[55:54] side and
[55:55] &gt;&gt; use use this. Yeah. This But must be
[55:58] able to persons must be able to see. Or
[56:00] you could put it I could go a little
[56:02] lower, right? the name, but there's some
[56:05] there that, you know, just want to I
[56:07] like I like teaching indeed, brothers.
[56:11] Yeah, that's good. Perfect.
[56:14] Amen. And
[56:18] yeah, let me see if I could stand here
[56:20] and not too close there. Can you see?
[56:24] Put it right here.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Just
[56:28] go. That's right. I could stand here and
[56:30] do that. This perfect
[56:34] Then I move and then I can show you.
[56:37] That's right. Because I'm left-handed,
[56:39] so I got to put it on the other side,
[56:41] you know.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; It was okay.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you. That's right.
[56:56] Thank you. So you not just adjust the
[56:59] size, but you adjust the height.
[57:04] You realize the height is important.
[57:07] What a vision.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; What a revelation.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. Thank you. Good.
[57:14] Colossians chapter um three and may the
[57:17] Lord just bless us. And as I said,
[57:19] everything is just in order as how God
[57:21] wanted. And um
[57:25] can I'm just going to read from verse
[57:26] one through to verse four.
[57:31] If you then be risen with Christ and
[57:33] look at the word if you know
[57:36] um
[57:38] brother Paul wrote this and you know for
[57:41] those who study
[57:43] a lot you realize Paul was ne I don't
[57:45] Paul never even put his feet in Colos
[57:49] &gt;&gt; never mostly docked in Ephesus because
[57:52] Ephesus was the main area he he has
[57:54] never even been in lysia and all these
[57:56] areas
[57:56] &gt;&gt; so he just dock there and send the
[57:58] letters to these believers. Right? He
[58:01] just learned of their conditions and the
[58:03] progress that were making. They were
[58:05] these were like small groups, but
[58:06] Ephesus was the main port that he
[58:08] traveled probably three times. However,
[58:10] he said, "If you then be risen with
[58:12] Christ, seek those things which are
[58:14] above where Christ sitting." Can I say
[58:18] sit at sitting? On the right hand of
[58:21] God,
[58:22] &gt;&gt; right? And he said, "Set your affection
[58:24] on things above, not on things on the
[58:28] earth. For you are dead.
[58:32] Normally you would says you would put
[58:35] dead before resurrection. Isn't that
[58:36] right?
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Because for you to have for you to
[58:39] experience resurrection you have to die.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; But Paul turn it around.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; He turned it around. He says you are
[58:48] risen with Christ. That mean you
[58:49] experience a resurrection.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Then he said actually you are dead.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; You are dead. Yeah.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; So it takes a resurrection to bring you
[59:00] into this death
[59:02] &gt;&gt; and your life is now hid
[59:06] &gt;&gt; with Christ in God.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore when Christ who is your
[59:14] life
[59:15] &gt;&gt; is our life. So you are not just you are
[59:18] not just Jared. You're supposed to be
[59:21] Christ.
[59:24] So God is not just looking for a Jared
[59:27] or a Osman or a Ruth
[59:29] &gt;&gt; when the Holy Spirit
[59:32] &gt;&gt; is
[59:34] &gt;&gt; is what? Fellowshipping with Christ.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Lord
[59:39] &gt;&gt; outside that we're just projecting
[59:41] ourselves.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; So self has to die.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So when Christ who is our
[59:52] life shall appear, not come but appear.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Then shall we or you or ye also
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; appear with him in glory. Not ever
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; glory.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Now remember we are being changed from
[1:00:10] what? Glory to glory. So our our
[1:00:14] transformation is in stages.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. And stages are phoned in
[1:00:19] seasons.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may God bless us to our heart.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Bless the word to us father in Jesus
[1:00:25] name. Amen. You be seated.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; And so you know when you look at so we
[1:00:31] are dead
[1:00:34] verse three. So you are dead. And I'm
[1:00:37] going to say let's okay let's put a
[1:00:39] little thought to this. A title entering
[1:00:42] in our new life.
[1:00:46] entering into our new life.
[1:00:50] So we are dead means the word dead there
[1:00:53] means amen separated from this world
[1:00:59] because now remember the word of God
[1:01:01] when it speaks of the world
[1:01:04] it speaks of according depending on the
[1:01:07] context in which is used physical plant
[1:01:11] or planet earth or the entire human
[1:01:14] population but God loved this world God
[1:01:17] love his people you know that All right.
[1:01:19] Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Hell was not made for man.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; it was made for the angels, Satan and
[1:01:26] the angels. That's what the word of God
[1:01:28] says.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; And so the word also refer to the
[1:01:33] secular system that opposes God.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Or the temporal nature of hurt's life.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:45] So when he speaks of debt, it's
[1:01:47] referring to a separation from the
[1:01:51] secular
[1:01:52] system that opposes that which is of
[1:01:55] God.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Or the temporary things of this earth
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; that we have no desire for.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; He's a child of God. All right.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; So here you remember when Jesus was
[1:02:08] praying for his disciples there in John
[1:02:10] chapter 17 verse 14 and the uh when
[1:02:15] Jesus said father I'm not praying that
[1:02:18] you take them from out of this world
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; which is planet earth
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; but I want you to keep them from
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; evil
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; the evil of this world which is the
[1:02:29] secular systems
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; that opposes God
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; which can also be a religious spirit.
[1:02:36] right sir
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; because the strongest demon you can ever
[1:02:40] find
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; is a religious demon
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; having a form of godliness and there is
[1:02:47] absolutely no power for transformation
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; glory to god
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; so not notice when we speaks of that
[1:02:55] disparation
[1:02:57] but the apostle Paul says now if you are
[1:03:01] risen with Christ so there is A
[1:03:05] resurrection takes place in our lives.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; That actually brought us into this
[1:03:12] separation.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Which is our new life.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; Now, what brought forth this death?
[1:03:20] Glory to God. Is that we enter into a
[1:03:26] new life that is separated
[1:03:29] [Applause]
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; from everything else outside of God.
[1:03:34] So this resurrection, glory to God,
[1:03:37] represents,
[1:03:39] Amen, a adoption.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand, we talk
[1:03:47] about seasons uh Wednesday night and we
[1:03:50] says it there had to be a Jordan.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; For for them to cross
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; in order to enter the promised land.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; That's right. The promised son
[1:04:03] represents their adoption. Yes, sir.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; Now remember, oh, glory to God. Adoption
[1:04:09] is, Amen. was the rightful promised
[1:04:12] land.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; They were there before.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; You remember they were there before.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; And because of the famine,
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jacob brought them over into
[1:04:25] Egypt.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; So, they were being restored.
[1:04:29] So adaption is actually restoration.
[1:04:33] [Applause]
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; And so what it takes Jordan represents
[1:04:41] glory to God death, burial, and
[1:04:44] resurrection.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; While the Red Sea represents baptism.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So they were baptized in
[1:04:54] the Red Sea
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; under Moses administration.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; But coming Joshua,
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; glory to God. Who represents our end
[1:05:06] time leader. The prophet said that
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; he said Caleb, amen, types, a true
[1:05:12] believer
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; who stayed with Joshua
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; and enter the promise.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; He said our end time leader. Oh, glory
[1:05:22] to God. Uh, it's our Joshua,
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; that bringing us into our adoption.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Our adoption is actually our
[1:05:35] restoration.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Now, think about this.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; It's the resurrection.
[1:05:48] Amen. that brought us into a new life.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Into this new life.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, can I quote what the prophet says
[1:05:59] when he preached the message is the
[1:06:01] rising of the sun. He preached at the in
[1:06:05] April 1965
[1:06:08] when he said when Christ Jesus was
[1:06:10] saying, Amen. Quote in John chapter 4.
[1:06:14] Glory to God. John chapter 14 when he
[1:06:16] says because I live you shall live also.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; He was speaking to his wife.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; The prophet echoed.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; He said what a resurrection that was.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; He said what a resurrection this is.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; To be resurrected in the new life of
[1:06:38] Jesus Christ.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; What brought this new life? It was the
[1:06:43] resurrection.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; They walked with Jesus for about 3 and
[1:06:48] 1/2 years
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; and they never knew his fullness.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; But on that day when they saw him,
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thomas says, "My Lord and my God."
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; They saw his fullness.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; How did it happen?
[1:07:07] They saw him in the resurrected uh
[1:07:10] dimension
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; and that brought them into their new
[1:07:14] life.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; What a resurrection this is.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Bride of Christ.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; The Bible says your life
[1:07:27] is hid with Christ in God.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Your life is hid with Christ.
[1:07:35] I have a marker here.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; You see it. It's not a mystery.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; It's not being hid.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; You can see it visually.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; And by seeing it, you're understanding
[1:07:47] the purpose.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; But if I conceal it
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; under this material,
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; glory to God, now it's being hid.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Once it's hid, now it becomes a mystery.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right, saints? Amen.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; It now become a mystery.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Can I say this from a true heart?
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, hallelujah.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; You're hid with Christ.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. In God. God is your spirit.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; And Christ is the anointed that come
[1:08:22] from the eternal spirit.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Now you are being hid. Now you this is
[1:08:27] when you become a mystery.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. Glory.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hello saints.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; You are now a mystery.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; The world don't know who you are.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan knows who you are.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Woo. Hallelujah.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Because he was already familiar with
[1:08:48] mysteries.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why when he saw Jesus, he
[1:08:54] came with the word, if thou be the son
[1:08:57] of God,
[1:08:59] man these stones to be made bread.
[1:09:02] Because God hide himself in that flesh.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:11] God hid himself in that flesh.
[1:09:15] Amen. But when Jesus was walking among
[1:09:19] the tombs, the demons never said, "If
[1:09:22] you are the son of God," they said, "You
[1:09:26] are the son of God, you come to torment
[1:09:30] us before the time.
[1:09:32] Satan is not asking you today, the body
[1:09:36] of Christ. If you are the son of God, he
[1:09:40] knows who you are. He knows who you are.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Your neighbor may not know because their
[1:09:47] minds are limited.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Their visions are finite, but Satan
[1:09:53] knows.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; That is why he pressures you.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Satan is on a raging war. He knows his
[1:10:02] time is near.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; You are his greatest enemy.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; You are his worst nightmare.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Your neighbors are God bless you,
[1:10:22] brother Junior.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; If he just knows
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; what is he saying now, who is he saying
[1:10:28] that to?
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Amen.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; Because you're hid.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; In God.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; You are the anointed
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; that's being hid.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Woo. Hallelujah.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; You are the anointing.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; That is hid.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; That's why. So when Christ
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; when that anointing follow me closely.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sister, the sister will pull the
[1:10:55] scriptures up
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; you are familiar with already. But when
[1:10:59] Christ
[1:11:01] who is
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; our life
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; now this is when you don't put Jesus
[1:11:07] over here and you here
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; I tell person says I never go to church
[1:11:13] and ask Jesus to come.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; I can't do that.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; My understanding is that Christ is in
[1:11:18] me.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; When I go to the food store is there.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; When I come to church he's there. Hey.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; When I go to work, he's there.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; So when I'm in church, I ask the Lord,
[1:11:33] give us a fresh anointing today.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; May your purpose,
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; come forth.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; We are here just to manifest his will.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; I don't say God come now.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; It's as if I don't know where he is.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; But because I know where he is.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; I bring worship with me.
[1:11:56] I'm worship in the field. I worship in
[1:11:59] the kitchen. I worship at my workplace.
[1:12:04] I don't have to raise hand to worship.
[1:12:06] My soul is an indictment in a good
[1:12:10] matter. My soul has to be constantly in
[1:12:14] communication with him. Why? Because I
[1:12:17] have been entered into that new life
[1:12:21] with Christ.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; In God.
[1:12:25] Amen.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; When you walk through those doors,
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; God is not going to say, "Okay, Osman,
[1:12:35] see you next week."
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; No way.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Come on. Bring it on.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Preach.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; He's there.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Woo. Hallelujah.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; He's always there.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Sometime I fall.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. But he's still there.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; He's there.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; I make mistakes.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; He's still there.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; So, there is a positive.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Always tugging on the negative.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; You are more than an overcomer.
[1:13:23] tugging on me.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; there's a positive there.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Now,
[1:13:32] when Christ who is your life shall
[1:13:35] appear,
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; in every age, dispensations are in ages.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; So, you got age, you have dispensations.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; You have seasons.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we are
[1:13:50] Oh, praise God.
[1:13:52] Okay, let me just jump into this a bit a
[1:13:54] bit. Okay. Okay. Let me just jump in
[1:13:57] here. Can you see it from there? And
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; thank you. Come on, engine. Yeah. Just
[1:14:01] move it a little backward.
[1:14:05] Good.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Everybody can see.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Good. Good.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Good. Now, so this is a perfect example.
[1:14:16] Moses,
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; is that right?
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Moses. Now God never stopped the hedge
[1:14:24] from Moses. He started it long time.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; And then from Moses to the promised
[1:14:32] land.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; All right. So we have Egypt.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; And when God sent his messenger,
[1:14:41] vindicated messenger with Mo Moses to
[1:14:44] lead the people out. When the people
[1:14:46] exit Egypt, that was when the ages
[1:14:48] start. So the age is not based upon
[1:14:51] Moses. It's based upon purpose.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Purpose.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; So there was a time. So within this
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Within this uh let's
[1:15:02] say h glory to God. There's a time when
[1:15:04] they had no law.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; They were just going alone,
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in here you had they had to
[1:15:11] cross a red sea.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; So this the Red Sea after the Red Sea
[1:15:17] came over. Glory to God. What happened?
[1:15:19] Oh, there was a great revival.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Powerful revival. Miriam and the sisters
[1:15:25] took Timl and they were having church in
[1:15:27] the wilderness.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; And so they were having church in the
[1:15:33] wilderness. Oh, it was so powerful.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; It was so anointing. But then there came
[1:15:38] a time, Amen, when God said, "Okay, Mo,
[1:15:40] the people, Amen, God said, Moses, you
[1:15:43] need to start a religion." Yes.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Am I Am I on truck preachers?
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; So here it was the law.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Ordinances and statutes. You know what
[1:15:57] that happened? You know what that was?
[1:15:59] That was another dispensation within the
[1:16:03] same age.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Dispensation.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; See it was no more under what God says
[1:16:08] Moses and come up here. Let me show you
[1:16:11] things and tell the people. It was now
[1:16:13] read the law to the people.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Then God Oh, there were Oh, can you
[1:16:21] imagine under such anointing miracle and
[1:16:25] all that the people backslid?
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; They forget God. They forget the
[1:16:31] miracles of God. Show them. Oh, there
[1:16:34] was a time when God said, "Come here,
[1:16:35] Moses. Amen. My servant, come here,
[1:16:38] Joshua. My servant Moses is dead."
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:43] dispensation.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; No, Joshua.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Same age.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; It's not finished yet.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; So don't you pack up and say, "God, I'm
[1:16:53] here." No, you're not there.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; You're just under a different
[1:16:56] dispensation.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, church is over. I'm I'm in heaven.
[1:17:01] You got a problem.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; You're misunderstanding.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Right. That's true.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Dispensation.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; We cannot We cannot change H.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; No. Right.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; And show what we find many times. Oh,
[1:17:16] Joshua is here as our leader. There's a
[1:17:18] Jordan to cross.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Hey. Amen.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; There's a Jordan to cross. Now, the big
[1:17:24] difference. Amen. You know why? Because
[1:17:26] we are trying to see if we can bring
[1:17:28] back a rod.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Stretch forth a rod across here.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, Joshua, we got a problem. Now,
[1:17:36] what's the problem? You don't have a
[1:17:37] rod,
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:41] [Applause]
[1:17:43] This is what we used to.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; We used to this Moses. One time we were
[1:17:49] thirsty. Oh, you know what? Prophet
[1:17:52] Moses did. He struck the rock.
[1:17:54] Hallelujah.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; What a revival it was.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; God said, "Moses,
[1:18:06] I'm going to change the dispensation.
[1:18:09] Yeah.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; You're going to speak to the rock next
[1:18:12] time.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Moses failed.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah, he did.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; To make the transition.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; He did.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; He failed.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Prophet Moses failed to make the
[1:18:27] transition. Oh yes, he did.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; So God of Joshua on the scene. Now
[1:18:32] Joshua never had a rod, but you know how
[1:18:35] the thing is it was different.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. different anointing.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; God said, Joshua, you're going to speak
[1:18:41] to the people, give them instructions.
[1:18:43] That's right.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Now, the beauty about this is that all
[1:18:45] these persons that left out under the
[1:18:48] anointing of Moses and rejoice him, God
[1:18:51] say, "Okay, I'm going to take you home."
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; You can't. You're not going over.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying they were lost.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; No. I'm just saying then they will make
[1:19:01] the transition.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Then they were translated. Right. That's
[1:19:05] right.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; So here it was saying under Joshua, do
[1:19:10] you know that there was another a a
[1:19:14] different generation? The cross.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; A new generation.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; The cross under the anointing of the end
[1:19:24] time leader.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Do you know the prophet says Moses
[1:19:28] commission was great?
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Badisha Joshua was greater.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. Because he had
[1:19:36] to put them. Oh, this represents death.
[1:19:40] Oh, glory to God. Is that right? Death,
[1:19:43] burial, and resurrection.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Yep. Right.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; To enter their adoption.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. When they were under
[1:19:58] here, Amen. They never had to fend for
[1:20:01] themselves. They had all they had to do
[1:20:04] was cry tomorrow and God send down mana.
[1:20:08] God send them quail. We were so
[1:20:12] beautiful on the Moses. But under Joshua
[1:20:15] when they crossed Jordan, the Bible said
[1:20:18] the manor stopped falling.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Manners stop falling.
[1:20:25] Uh, amen. You got to start eating uh,
[1:20:28] Amen. the corn of the property. You
[1:20:31] start had to fend now for yourself. It's
[1:20:35] already in you. God is just bringing out
[1:20:39] what he already placing you
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; under the anointing of a adoption
[1:20:45] series. Uh it's not God punishing you.
[1:20:49] It's not God pressuring you. He's just
[1:20:52] bringing out his attributes.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:21:00] You are exactly where God want you.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Woo. Somebody didn't hear that, did you?
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; You are exactly where God want you.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; I should get more. Amen. In this church.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; You should. You are exactly where God
[1:21:24] want you.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:27] Yes.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Season.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Right. I'm I'm I'm showing you something
[1:21:32] here. We talk about glory. The glory
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; under Moses was one glory.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Under Joshua was another glory.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; When they enter the promise was a
[1:21:41] greater glory.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Greater glory.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; So when we talk about God is changing us
[1:21:46] from glory to glory. Oh, we we think
[1:21:49] it's just
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; it's just manmade system. Right.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; I'm standing up here in a tie and a and
[1:21:57] a shirt and
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; that has nothing to do with
[1:21:59] righteousness.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; it has nothing to do with my soul.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; So notice you're saying
[1:22:14] so we
[1:22:16] can be distracted
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; over here trying to worship God
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; right now. over here.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; He's a Oh, he's a same God.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; He's a Christ.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; If I'm here trying to now trying to
[1:22:35] worship the Lord that met Abraham
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; in the valley of memory.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, I need God to come in flesh and do
[1:22:43] the same thing he did with Abraham.
[1:22:45] Probably he's doing greater,
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; right? Yes.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; But I'm not seeing it.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Because I'm trying to see if I can
[1:22:53] worship the God that was talking to
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Abraham.
[1:22:57] Yes, sir.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; He's the same God.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; But when he appears, how he appears.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Can you identify the Christ?
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Have he appears?
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory to God. You heard that? Can
[1:23:18] you identify the God,
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; the same universal God as he appears?
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:26] When how when Christ who is our life
[1:23:30] shall appear when you see him
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; when you see him which not with his
[1:23:38] eyeballs
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; but when you understand his appearing
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; your worship change
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; your attitude changes
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; thank you Lord
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; your approach changes
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; that's why Jesus Jesus said to my sister
[1:23:56] at the well, he said, "If you just knew
[1:23:59] who I was,
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; your approach would be different."
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; If you knew who I was, you wouldn't
[1:24:08] approach me with racism.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Right. There you go.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Your approach would be different.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; When we enter this new, you know, the
[1:24:18] beauty about the new life is that there
[1:24:20] is absolutely no color.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; It's just the blood of Jesus.
[1:24:32] The beauty about the new life, God don't
[1:24:34] see pastors
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; and church members.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; God is looking at Christ.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; God is not looking at me big and you
[1:24:48] small.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; God is talking to sons and daughters.
[1:24:53] Thank you, Lord.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; You see, in this new life that we're
[1:24:59] entering, we're like children
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; except you
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; see the kingdom as a little child.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; You're not even entering.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; You never say heaven now.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; There is nowhere in the Bible God say
[1:25:12] you must work to go to heaven.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Stop it.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Nowhere in the Bible God say you need to
[1:25:18] work yourself to go to heaven.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; If you came from there, that's where
[1:25:22] you're going back.
[1:25:23] Amen. Amen.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; God never even tell how many in the
[1:25:32] church believe in the rapture.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; God never tell us to have sleepless
[1:25:38] nights about going in the rapture.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; You can hardly eat because you want to
[1:25:44] go to rapture. You want to make the
[1:25:45] rapture. Lord, I cannot hardly sleep. I
[1:25:48] want to go in the rapture. You need to
[1:25:49] stop that thing.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. God never tell
[1:25:52] you to do that.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; So the season that we're in,
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; we cannot deny it. A war.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; War. Everywhere is war.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; You can hardly look at a news now and
[1:26:12] there's no war.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; War. But we're not supposed to be
[1:26:17] frightened.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; We're supposed to look up.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. and lift our heads up. Two things
[1:26:22] God tell us to do.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Look up. Lift up your heads. Two things.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Why? Because your redemption is near.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; We looked at that Wednesday night. But
[1:26:31] then he says, "And they during that
[1:26:34] season, they shall see the son of man
[1:26:38] coming in a cloud.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Not on the cloud, but come in a cloud."
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; He will be clothed in a cloud.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery. But when he come, not
[1:26:51] because he's a mystery. Yes.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; He's coming in the cloud. He's wrapped
[1:26:54] in the cloud.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; He has to be unfold for you to know who
[1:26:57] he is.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand when we
[1:27:01] see Christ Jesus in Revelation chapter
[1:27:03] 19 verse 11, the Bible say he had many
[1:27:05] crowns.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Because he appeared in different
[1:27:10] seasons,
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; different dispensations.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. One time he was a mighty
[1:27:15] angel
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; wrestling with Jacob. Another time he
[1:27:18] was Adonai who met the parents of
[1:27:21] Samson. Another time he was this angel.
[1:27:24] Oh God is God.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; God don't need to ask us how to come.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; We just need to find him when he come.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Bible says in Luke 21:27,
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; they shall see him, they who a
[1:27:49] generation that know during this season
[1:27:52] of spring,
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; They will see him coming in a cloud.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; They will understand this coming.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. will understand his coming.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Who is he?
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Who is this man? Remember
[1:28:19] one time some guy some some Greeks came
[1:28:21] to see Jesus
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; sir
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; send a message sir we want to say Jesus
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't come out and say okay nice
[1:28:29] to meet you and
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; no he he sent a parable to them
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; he sent a parable to them
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; except the sheep fall to the ground and
[1:28:38] die
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; it abide alone
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; what's that mystery That's right.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Are we still there?
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Now, what the Bible says in Luke, you
[1:28:50] put it up.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; What the Bible says in Luke chapter 21,
[1:28:54] look at this now. Oh, glory to God. This
[1:28:56] is interesting.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Luke 21:27.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; And they shall see
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; the son of man.
[1:29:13] coming in a cloud.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Never before was this scripture make
[1:29:17] mention.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; The apostle Paul speaks of the coming of
[1:29:21] the Lord in three seasons. The shout the
[1:29:24] Lord descend him will descend. Season of
[1:29:27] a shout. The next season is a voice.
[1:29:29] Then the next season is a trumpet.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Three seasons, you know.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The Lord already descend.
[1:29:36] There is nowhere in the word of God that
[1:29:38] says Christ is going to come down on
[1:29:39] earth to take you in the rapture.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; No. No,
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; never say that.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; No, that's right.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you preachers. You I mean you guys
[1:29:46] are with me
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; like that.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; And they shall see the son of man coming
[1:29:51] in a cloud with what?
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Power and
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; the first time you see Christ coming
[1:29:57] back with such power is for war.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 19 from verse 11.
[1:30:03] War.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; No, that's not marriage supper.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:30:10] Come on now.
[1:30:12] That's it.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Each attire represents Asia.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Am I making sense?
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; How he dressed, how he approached, how
[1:30:25] he appear represents the occasion.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; And the purpose
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; here. He was coming through Jerusalem on
[1:30:32] a little young donkey.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It wasn't for war.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; I'm coming in peace.
[1:30:39] Is that right, sir?
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; But the next time you see him on a
[1:30:42] horse,
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; war,
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; war,
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; the anointing of a war horse
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; represents power.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; But then when you see him in the cloud,
[1:30:55] he's riding a horse. He's in the cloud.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Because if he's coming on a horse and
[1:31:02] that's the time you see him, you miss
[1:31:04] the rapture.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:11] You're supposed to see him in this power
[1:31:14] and this glory.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Woo. Hallelujah.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; I feel like I'm in church.
[1:31:26] [Applause]
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Can I do a small graph here?
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; So here is this little girl. She's
[1:31:35] single.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:31:37] Mhm.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; And then when she was engaged as spouse,
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; same thing.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Right. That's when she become bride.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Because the promise of marriage is now
[1:31:49] to her
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; and then the big day

[1:32:11] walking around your here and um
[1:32:14] advertising that she's going to get
[1:32:15] married?

[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; you cannot give out invitation

[1:34:24] your name is not good on the checker's
[1:34:26] mind.

[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Cuz you're you're in line.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; when you see him, when Christ
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; who is our life
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; shall appear,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; one place in the word that mention he
[1:36:20] comes in glory.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Revelation chapter 10:1.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; we saw him in Revelation. Now, one need
[1:36:30] put it there cuz I'm going to show you
[1:36:32] something.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; When he comes as a bridegroom,
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; in the power of a lion,
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; but in the glory of a husband.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; That can never be to Israel.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; No. Because when you saw in Revelation
[1:36:52] 14 there on Mount Zion,
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; you saw the 144,000
[1:36:59] with the lamb.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Lamb don't
[1:37:03] roar like lion.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; A lamb is a lamb and a lion is a lion.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Different levels,
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; different dimensions.
[1:37:17] Israel rejected him as a lamb
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; because they were expecting lions.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Are you still there with me?
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. And so when you saw
[1:37:32] him, he was what? Clothed with a cloud.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Revelation 14. After the 144,000
[1:37:42] of Israel make mentioned in Revelation
[1:37:45] 7, they have to be sealed.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; When they are sealed, the Bible said the
[1:37:51] gospel change.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; That's when the gospel change.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; When the son of man coming on a cloud
[1:37:59] with a sharp sickle
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; to do the separation and the harvesting
[1:38:03] on earth.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. But now you
[1:38:08] see him coming in a cloud,
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; wrapped in a cloud. Why?
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he is the high priest.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Is that right, saints?
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; He has to come in that same order.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; But notice in Exodus chapter 28
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; from verse 5 when the Bible show when
[1:38:29] God shut down, Amen. the specs
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; for the garments of Amen. of those
[1:38:35] priests.
[1:38:37] Glory to God. And you saw the material
[1:38:40] blue and purple and gold.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And scarlet
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; and fine linen.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; These are materials. Glory to God.
[1:38:50] Hallelujah.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Representing a diety from glory.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Is that right?
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, the blue. Amen. Represent heavenly.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Purple represents your
[1:39:05] royalty.
[1:39:07] Oh, fine linen represents righteousness.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. Scarlet represents
[1:39:14] redemption.
[1:39:15] Woo! Glory. All of it. Never was there a
[1:39:19] cloud.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Never was there a cloud. Is that right?
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; But God was saving that attribute for
[1:39:27] his wedding.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God was saving that
[1:39:33] attribute
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; for his darling.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; He was saving the cloud garment for his
[1:39:39] sweetheart.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 10.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Bring it back there.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Whoa. Hallelujah.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; My my my
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, we saw him
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; coming. Look at this countenance.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. Where did you
[1:40:01] see rainbow? Scroll it down because
[1:40:04] we're going to do a few verses.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Go on with it. Oh, and he
[1:40:09] had in his hand a little book and glory
[1:40:12] to God. And you can read it for yourself
[1:40:15] on his feet on the hurt. Next verse.
[1:40:20] Glory to God. And he cried with a loud
[1:40:22] voice.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; As a lion roar,
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; thunders.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Is that right, saints?
[1:40:27] Seven thunders
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; uttered their voices.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Keep going. And John says,
[1:40:35] "And when the seven thunders uttered
[1:40:37] their voices at the appearing of Christ,
[1:40:40] he appears there." Follow me.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. And I heard a voice
[1:40:45] from heaven saying unto me, John,
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; shield up those things
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; where the seven thunders uttered. Don't
[1:40:54] write them. Remember
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; when John was being given the
[1:40:59] instructions
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; in Revelation chapter 2 to3
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; the voice said John write these things.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; The next Revelation chapter 4:1
[1:41:10] after these things John says
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; glory to God a voice summon me come up
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; hither.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Revelation 4. Is that right? He said,
[1:41:21] "I'm going to show you not to write,
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; but I'm going to show you the season
[1:41:27] changes.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; The age is the same. The bride age is
[1:41:34] the same, but the dispensation changes.
[1:41:38] It's no more writing, but pay
[1:41:41] attention."
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah. John said,
[1:41:46] "Immediately I was in the spirit and I
[1:41:49] looked and I saw one sitting on the
[1:41:52] throne. I saw a rainbow around the
[1:41:55] throne." Hallelujah. Which was the
[1:41:58] covenant of life
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; between God and her.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Anywhere you see the
[1:42:06] rainbow, it represents life.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Woo.

[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Heaven scenery shift.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; It's time to show you redemption plan.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; The book, not a literal book because God
[1:42:35] don't need this.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; God is not a God that need a book to be
[1:42:39] jotting down and taking notes of your
[1:42:42] action. He's God.
[1:42:44] He knows the beginning from the ending.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And John said, "I saw one
[1:42:50] sitting on the throne and a book in his
[1:42:52] hand. The proclamation went forth. No
[1:42:56] man was worthy. Not able to look upon
[1:42:59] the book,
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; which means to manifest this attribute
[1:43:03] of God upon the earth." No man was
[1:43:06] worthy
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; because we were all born in sin
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; and shaped iniquity. But out of God came
[1:43:14] the lamb.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Man, lamb man
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; which was the same God himself
[1:43:23] put on flesh and come because God cannot
[1:43:27] die.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; God cannot die
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; but he needed a body
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; and show that body step from the throne
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; and call the lamb of God.
[1:43:42] Hallelujah.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And when that lamb came
[1:43:47] and the revelation chapter 6
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; to verse Revelation
[1:43:52] 8 show you when the lamb unfold all the
[1:43:56] seals.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But Revelation
[1:44:01] 8 verse 1, when he had opened the
[1:44:04] seventh seal,
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; there was silence in heaven
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; about the space of half an hour.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Never before
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; was silence in heaven.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Revelation 4 tells you verse 11, they
[1:44:19] were worshiping.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; They were worshiping.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Worship cannot stop.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; As long as Christ was up the throne,
[1:44:28] Worship has to continue.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; But God has to keep his word.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; For this cause, a man has to leave his
[1:44:42] father
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; and his mother
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; and cleave to his wife
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; for them to become one.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Christ had to step from that dimension.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Because while he was on the throne, he
[1:44:55] was the eternal father. Right.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; But when he stepped from the throne.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; He became in time.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; While he's on the throne, he's out of
[1:45:06] time.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; W God almighty. Help us.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Help us
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; under the anointing of the shout.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. The whole heart heard it.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; The whole age heard it.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But when this the voice
[1:45:26] echoed,
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; when the voice was clear,
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Matthew 25:10
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; from verse 6 to 10,
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; behold the bridegroom come.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, beautiful.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Go out to meet him.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; She heard the voice.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Her mind changed,
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; her planning changed,
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; her perspective changed,
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; her desire changed.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Hallelujah.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Go out to meet him. Her walk changed.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Her direction changed.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Who are you going to meet? My
[1:46:01] bridegroom.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah,
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm glad I'm preaching the Bible.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; And they went in with him where? In the
[1:46:23] marriage
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; in where?
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; In the marriage.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; Marriage is a union.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Not a place.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Marriage is not a place.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; It's a union.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; You remember November 1965 when this
[1:46:37] message was preached.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; The invisible union.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. The 25th of November
[1:46:42] to be exact.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; The invisible union.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; God's prophecy said, "I could turn this
[1:46:46] into a marriage and divorce,
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; but it's a prophecy
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; to the end time church. There's going to
[1:46:52] be an invisible union.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; This is not a place.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; It's an invisible union.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; And the door was shut.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Why the door shut? There's something
[1:47:06] going on behind that door
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; that you can't understand.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; And you will never understand.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; A higher revelation.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Oh God, why are you so excited? I'm in
[1:47:18] the door. I'm on the inside.
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Are you all following me? Is it okay?
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Is this okay?
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; So, Revelation when you open the 17,
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; there was silence in heaven. Why?
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Why
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; he had to leave?
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; He had to peer for a marriage.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; But then hurt didn't even you know when
[1:47:48] Yes.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; One of them. Amen. There were 10
[1:47:51] virgins.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; 10 virgins
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; with the same mind, same everything.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; But the preparation was different.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; So don't you ever tell me that I am
[1:48:03] potential bride. No. I know who I
[1:48:04] married to.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; There's no potentiality into this.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; It's reality.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Don't bring me back to Ha. No.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; When all them virgins line up and
[1:48:17] everybody, you're going to be Oh yes,
[1:48:18] you're going to be Oh yes, you're going
[1:48:20] to be the next queen. Oh yes, you sure

[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; But while the preparation was going on,
[1:48:31] when all the virgins from Sushan Palish
[1:48:34] were being gathered and taken care of,
[1:48:35] everybody being prepared,
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; what happened? Everybody was bread
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; until the selection was made. Yes.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; When the selection was made, the glory
[1:48:50] changed.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; The glory changed.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; And everybody went over into the
[1:48:56] concubine house.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; And one was in the palace being prepared
[1:49:00] for the wedding.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; And if you ask her, how why are you
[1:49:03] being prepared? Oh, are you sick? I'm

[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That's the truth.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; And when she was married,
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; when she received the royal crown and
[1:49:20] the royal robe, she was now queen.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; The ne she don't mean the next time you
[1:49:26] saw her get dressed, who got her dress?
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; She herself.

[1:49:41] Thank you, Jesus.

[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Because she's now married.

[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; The church is his wife.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. Wife.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; So, you're looking at a statue of a
[1:50:07] perfect man. Complete man. The word the
[1:50:09] word perfect there means complete.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; A complete man. Christ.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; I keep telling people it doesn't make
[1:50:17] sense. You come to church, raise your
[1:50:19] hand. Praise the Lord. I love God. I've
[1:50:20] got Holy Ghost. And you don't love your
[1:50:22] brother.
[1:50:24] [Applause]
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; If you don't love your brother, you
[1:50:29] don't love Christ.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; It's either two your ignorance.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Ignorance. You don't even know who you
[1:50:34] love. You don't even know who God is.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; If you know God, you got to love me.
[1:50:37] Hey. Hey.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; If God was your father, you would have
[1:50:41] known me.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; And when you know me, you must love me.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; That's the word.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. If God was your father,
[1:50:53] you wouldn't want Jesus say you wouldn't
[1:50:54] seek to kill me if if Abraham was your
[1:50:56] father.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Can you go further?
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus said.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Jesus said that.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; And so clothe in the cloud. He roar as a
[1:51:09] lion.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; That's what we see. The power
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; of a lion. But the glory
[1:51:17] of a husband.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; The first time John saw him. Is it
[1:51:24] Revelation 1 verse 17 or 19 somewhere
[1:51:26] about? John
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; fell down as if he was dead.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Dead.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; Dead. Lifeless. And he came and touched
[1:51:36] me with his right hand.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; Rise up.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; The next time John, he he appeared to
[1:51:41] John.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. John was bold.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; John was bold.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Come on, saints.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; That's why the voice said, Revelation
[1:51:53] 10:8, John, go and take the book.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; He was no mature.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; He was no mature.
[1:52:08] He has been changed.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; First time he felt as if he was dead,
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; but now he was not. He was now mature
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Spirit brought him
[1:52:16] through the process.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; He showed him heaven. He showed him the
[1:52:19] occupants around heaven. He showed him
[1:52:21] the four beasts. He showed him, oh God,
[1:52:23] the the the ceiling of the 144. He
[1:52:26] showed him the mysteries. But now, glory
[1:52:28] to God, there was a messenger on earth.
[1:52:30] Glory to God. When he wrapped in the
[1:52:32] club, nobody knew who he was.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Nobody. It was not for everybody.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Oh, glory. But when he
[1:52:40] rode in town, she start having
[1:52:42] butterflies
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; because he was coming for her.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; He was coming for her.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. But when the declaration
[1:52:52] by the seventh messenger says, "Behold
[1:52:54] the bridegroom come." That's him.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; She know who he was. That's right.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; And when you know who he was under this
[1:53:04] glory, you don't need to ask what's the
[1:53:06] purpose.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; The purpose is marriage.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; You don't need to ask why is he here? I
[1:53:14] know why he's here.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; I'm entering my new life.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; New life.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; I'm entering to a new life.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; John, go take the book.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; John boldly
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; said, go take the book.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. confidence,
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; boldness,
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Took the book.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, John, when you take it,
[1:53:36] you need to heat it
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; because you become what you eat.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; And when you It's the first time John is
[1:53:42] getting a ministry.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; You're going to prophesy.
[1:53:46] [Applause]
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; You're going to prophesy.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Hallelujah.

[1:54:01] marriage.

[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; Stop behaving like you're single.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; I've come to some young people married
[1:54:37] and all that. Some are being married for
[1:54:39] 10 years and they're still single.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; One man married how many years and he
[1:54:47] has a bank account and his wife have
[1:54:49] one.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; glory to God. And everything is his.
[1:54:56] It's mine.
[1:54:57] &gt;&gt; You stay over there.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; I'm over here. That's two single people
[1:55:02] if you ask me.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; The system is structuring so much that
[1:55:12] you don't need to change your name.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Keep your name.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; System.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; The system.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Keep your name. I'm sorry,
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; honey. The Bible says, "And God called
[1:55:25] their name." Is that Genesis 5?
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; And God called their name.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, so there is no Heer.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; There is no Hea.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Who are you? Had them. You go down
[1:55:39] there, you see another being. Who are
[1:55:40] you? Hadam.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Oh God. Hallelujah.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Glor.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; You need to remind the system. I'm bone
[1:55:50] of his bone and flesh of his flesh.
[1:55:52] Yeah.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; So my name don't keep me and I'm not
[1:55:54] William Jenna Moore. I'm
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Bartley.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; So when my wife's shining,
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; she said Bartley.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; Anytime she start to go back to
[1:56:08] Williams,
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; separation starts.

[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Can I say something closely?
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks about the in second
[2:02:08] Peter chapter, is it second Peter
[2:02:10] chapter 1, which speaks about the
[2:02:12] virtues.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Faith, virtue,
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; for virtue, virtue, the brother, the
[2:02:17] kindness.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; What fruit bear? What tree bear fruit
[2:02:21] for itself?
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; No. All those is not for you.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[2:02:29] godliness, patience, brotherly kindness.
[2:02:31] That's not for you.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; No. When the Bible say God ordain you
[2:02:34] that you bear fruit. John 15.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Them fruits are not for you. You
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; No, it's not for you.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; No. No. God don't need your patience in
[2:02:41] glory.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; God don't need your faith in glory.
[2:02:44] Wait,
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; here. All your virtues needed here.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Right. Right here.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Here. This side.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; So, I'm sorry for those who waiting to
[2:02:58] go to glory to show love. God don't need
[2:03:00] it up there.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; God don't need it up there.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Bartley. I can't wait to go
[2:03:10] to glory so that my faith will be felt.
[2:03:13] God don't need your faith up there.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; It's needed him. It's needed.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Remember, you're married.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; The Bible said Revelation chapter 19
[2:03:26] verse 9,
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; "Blessed are those who are called to the
[2:03:28] marriage supper of the Lamb."
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Now, you're being trained now.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; As an army.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; You're training now. The trials, the
[2:03:36] test you go through, God is training you
[2:03:38] as an army.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Because the next time I'm seeing you
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; is when you come back with him
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; for the Armageddon.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 19. And the armies
[2:03:46] which were in heaven came back with him
[2:03:48] on white horses
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; for the war.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; So God ain't bringing you to the
[2:03:54] marriage supper to train you.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Who goes to a wedding to train to fight
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; sir.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; I love God.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; I'm closing this.

[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; Praise you.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know God brought a
[2:17:21] message this morning.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; And God shows himself multiple times in
[2:17:27] his word. Lord,
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; you know, we'll never get to the
[2:17:30] judgment and say, "God never showed me."
[2:17:33] cuz he'll show you and show you and show
[2:17:38] you again.
[2:17:39] &gt;&gt; You know what the pastor preached this
[2:17:41] morning? He preached the story of father
[2:17:44] Abraham, God.
[2:17:46] He called his greatest servant, Eleazar,
[2:17:49] the prophet,
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; to go get a bride, Rebecca,
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; for Jesus, Isaac. And they came together
[2:17:56] across the whole world. And Rebecca seen
[2:17:59] Isaac. He asked the prophet, he said,
[2:18:02] "Who's that?"
[2:18:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's my Lord. That's my Lord
[2:18:07] Jesus."
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; And he took him into the mother's tent.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; And they became his wife.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Rebecca
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; and Isaac,
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; Christ and his church,
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Christ in his church,
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; Eleazar was just getting the bride.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; Isaac,
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Eleazar was just a servant. He was just
[2:18:31] a servant.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; Was just a sermon getting Rebecca to
[2:18:36] Isaac.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; You know, one of the greatest parts of
[2:18:40] that story is how could Rebecca say, "I
[2:18:44] will go
[2:18:45] &gt;&gt; to a man that she's never seen because
[2:18:49] Isaac was her first cousin." They were
[2:18:51] blood relatives. I'm a blood blood
[2:18:55] relative of Jehovah God.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Genesis 1:26, "Let us make
[2:19:02] man in my own image." Blood.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Blood. We're blood this morning.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; Blood.
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; Jehovah's blood pumping in his bride.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's amazing.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; And he takes us as his wife.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's just beautiful.
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's sing the family of God
[2:19:26] with Rita Smith. Amen. That's more than
[2:19:29] it's more than your earthly family.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; This family was arranged before the
[2:19:35] foundation of the world.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. We knew each other. We met before
[2:19:40] the foundation of the world.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; You know, when I was in when I was in O
[2:19:43] Salvador, I think I preached when I come
[2:19:45] back. I said, you know, God came to Job
[2:19:47] and he said, "Where were you when I laid
[2:19:49] the foundation of the earth?" I was
[2:19:50] right there.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; I helped God laid the foundations.
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Think of it that way. You were there.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; You weren't just got this just in by
[2:20:00] accident. You were there. You were part
[2:20:03] of Jehovah.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; You know the pastor, I don't know if
[2:20:08] everybody got it. He said, "You're going
[2:20:10] to heaven if you came from heaven.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; I came from God. I'm going back to God.
[2:20:14] There'll be no mistakes."
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; Oh wow.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'll sing this song and be
[2:20:19] dismissed. God bless you with lots of
[2:20:22] food, lots of fellowship, and
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; just whatever God has for us. We're
[2:20:27] walking.
[2:20:28] You will notice we say brother
[2:20:33] and sister around here. It's because
[2:20:39] we're a family and these folks are so
[2:20:43] dear.
[2:20:45] And why has a heartache we all shed a
[2:20:51] tear and rejoice
[2:20:54] in his family and this family so near.
[2:21:00] Well, I'm so glad I'm a part of the
[2:21:05] family of God. I've been washing
[2:21:11] the fountain
[2:21:13] cleansed by his blood.

[2:21:24] for I'm part of the family,
[2:21:29] the family of God. From the door of a
[2:21:35] northeast to the house of a king. No
[2:21:41] longer
[2:21:43] I now cast a new song I sing. From rags
[2:21:50] onto riches.
[2:21:53] Oh, think about these words.
[2:22:00] But praise God, I belong. Oh, I'm so
[2:22:05] glad I'm a part of the family of God.
[2:22:12] I'm the wash in the fountain
[2:22:16] cleans by his blood.

[2:23:04] ministering. Lord God, bless the bride
[2:23:06] of Christ this morning.
[2:23:09] As we come into the marriage here on
[2:23:12] earth, Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[2:23:16] Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, may we walk and
[2:23:19] may our light so shine and may our may
[2:23:23] our atmosphere be so dynamic that when
[2:23:26] we walk in the shadows of the worldly
[2:23:28] people that the salt on us will make
[2:23:31] them thirsty,
[2:23:33] they'll say, "There goes a believer.
[2:23:36] There goes a child of God. There goes
[2:23:39] Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[2:23:42] Glory. Bless your bride this
