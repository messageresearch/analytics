[16:53] Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah Lord. Praise
[16:56] &gt;&gt; Lord God. We glorify your name. We
[16:59] worship and we adore you this morning.
[17:03] Thank you for your amazing love to each
[17:06] one of us, Lord God. Thank you that we
[17:09] were on your mind before the foundation
[17:13] of the world. Bless these beautiful
[17:17] bride of Christ here represented,
[17:19] purchased by your very own sacrifice.
[17:22] Lord God, may you bless them abundantly
[17:25] for their love and kindness, adoration
[17:28] to you and the bride around the world.
[17:31] Lord God, be with our the preaching of
[17:34] the word, Lord God. May you be pleased
[17:36] with everything that's said and done.
[17:38] And may nothing be stop me, Lord God. If
[17:41] I were to say something off or wrong,
[17:44] Lord God, that's never our desire or
[17:48] intent, Lord God.
[17:51] But may everything be done to glorify
[17:53] you. In your name we pray.
[17:56] Amen.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you this morning. God
[18:01] bless you. Maybe you can have your seats
[18:02] for a few moments. Thank you musicians
[18:05] and thank you Jared and
[18:08] Amen. God is good. Just remember brother
[18:11] Jeff and sister Dom just the kids she
[18:14] had messaged me many times uh through
[18:17] the week and the kids were very very
[18:18] sick and many of them and different
[18:22] ones. Sister Ruth and brother Bernard's
[18:25] family was very very sick last Sunday.
[18:27] So we just pray that they're doing good
[18:31] now. We just welcome you all. So, so
[18:34] many are out for different reasons.
[18:37] Amen. But God, God knows everything.
[18:40] Amen. Amen.
[18:42] Amen. Just good to be in, you know,
[18:45] Brother Bram talked about a service he
[18:47] had in Saskatchewan and he said it was
[18:50] terribly, terribly cold and it was in a
[18:53] house meeting and he said it was one of
[18:56] the very best meetings he ever had.
[18:59] And then he clarifies why it was so
[19:01] good.
[19:03] He said there was 13 people there and he
[19:06] said it was one of our greatest meetings
[19:08] because I said I had less spirits to
[19:10] fight through while ministering the
[19:12] word.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; So you know you can look around you and
[19:16] you can be disappointed that the church
[19:18] ain't full or you can look around and
[19:20] say I'm glad that God will be able to
[19:23] minister more easily
[19:25] because there'll be less devils. Brother
[19:27] Bram said that. Brother Brham said the
[19:29] devil comes every service,
[19:31] &gt;&gt; but there will be less spirits that God
[19:35] would have to get out of the way to
[19:36] actually get to the real heart of the
[19:38] issue.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, in everything is a blessing.
[19:42] Amen.
[19:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I want to read a poem that
[19:49] kind of goes along
[19:52] with what we're ministering on and and
[19:54] maybe this morning it'll be a little
[19:55] different, you know.
[19:58] Uh, I kind of want to today if God will
[20:02] let me, I'm I'm going to show some
[20:04] scriptures, but I'm going to show just
[20:06] some quotes and just kind of see, you
[20:09] know,
[20:11] you can read into anything whatever you
[20:14] want to. You know, the world's reading
[20:16] into different interpretations of the
[20:18] Bible,
[20:20] &gt;&gt; and you can do that with everything. And
[20:23] so sometimes people look at the exact
[20:25] same book and they said it says this.
[20:28] Some people say look at the Bible and
[20:29] say it's a hate which hate speech.
[20:31] Anybody here think the Bible's hate
[20:33] speech?
[20:36] &gt;&gt; But you know a huge majority of the
[20:38] world think it is.
[20:45] So, you know, sometimes when I read the
[20:47] message and study the message and God
[20:50] leads me in ways
[20:54] you could, a man could never put it
[20:56] together. I I actually was reading my
[20:57] devotions this morning and it was
[21:00] confirmation what we preached last
[21:01] Sunday.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Reading my like the devotions come from
[21:05] from uh Pastor Myra in Uganda. I mean,
[21:09] he has no clue what we're doing here.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. But, you know, sometimes we just
[21:15] if we just see what the word of God says
[21:18] &gt;&gt; and see what the message says and maybe
[21:20] we're interpreting it as hate speech
[21:24] when it isn't hate speech.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're interpreting something
[21:28] different. The title of this poem is the
[21:33] reaction of most people
[21:36] when they get to heaven.
[21:40] the reaction
[21:42] of most people
[21:45] when they walk in heaven. I was shocked,
[21:50] confused,
[21:52] bewildered as I entered heaven's door.
[21:56] Not of the beauty of it all,
[21:59] nor of the lights or of the decor.
[22:03] But it was the folks in heaven who made
[22:07] me sputter
[22:09] and gasp.
[22:11] The thieves,
[22:13] the liars,
[22:15] the sinners, the alcoholics,
[22:18] and all the trash.
[22:21] There stood the kid from seventh grade
[22:25] who stole my lunch money many times.
[22:29] And next to him, my old neighbor who
[22:32] never said nothing nice.
[22:36] Bob, who I was sure was rotting in hell,
[22:41] was sitting pretty on cloud nine,
[22:44] looking incredibly
[22:46] well.
[22:48] I nudged Jesus and said, "What's the
[22:51] deal?" I'd love to hear your take
[22:55] on all this stuff that's here.
[23:00] How did all these sinners
[23:03] get up here?
[23:06] You must have made a mistake.
[23:10] And why is everyone so quiet,
[23:14] so sober?
[23:17] Please, Jesus,
[23:19] give me a clue."
[23:22] Jesus answered me and said, "Hush,
[23:24] child.
[23:26] They're all in shock.
[23:29] Not one of them thought they'd ever be
[23:32] seeing you.
[23:40] Sometimes
[23:43] &gt;&gt; we think different than God.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; You know, Paul was a murderer.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; David had an affair.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; Jacob was a cheater. Peter had a temper.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; And we judge our brothers and sisters.
[24:06] Be careful you're not judging somebody
[24:08] that God put the kingdom of heaven
[24:10] &gt;&gt; in the Bible in charge of.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[24:25] You know it at the end of that poem it
[24:27] said
[24:31] every saint has a past
[24:34] but every sinner has a future.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; Be careful how we judge.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; Be careful how we judge. Let's read
[24:43] Matthew 20. Maybe you can stand if you
[24:45] don't mind. Matthew 23:12
[24:50] and then we'll turn to John. Going to
[24:52] read another scripture. Matthew 23 and
[24:55] 12. And I'm just going to wait till
[24:57] Vicki pulls it up.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; And whosoever shall exalt himself
[25:08] shall be abased, and he that shall
[25:11] humble himself
[25:13] shall be exalted.
[25:16] If we turn to 1 John 3 and9,
[25:21] 1 John 3
[25:24] and 9, whosoever is born of God does not
[25:27] commit sin,
[25:29] for his seed remainth in him, and he
[25:33] cannot sin
[25:35] because he's born of God. Lord Jesus, we
[25:39] pray that you would bless your people,
[25:41] Lord God, and may you bless your word
[25:43] incredibly, Lord God. And Lord, I pray
[25:45] that you'll reveal yourself onto all of
[25:48] us. And Lord, take the scales off my
[25:50] eyes and by revelation reveal the deity
[25:54] of yourself and who you are. And we give
[25:57] you the glory and honor for it in your
[25:58] name. Amen.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may have your seats.
[26:05] Amen.
[26:12] I was listening to my message last week
[26:14] and and uh
[26:17] I was thinking, "Wow, maybe I came
[26:20] across hard or but you know, God, you
[26:23] know, when the anointing comes, it's
[26:25] just you're not really in well, you're
[26:27] not at all in charge of how you are."
[26:29] But I want to look at my first quote
[26:31] here. You know, last week we said
[26:32] something about uh somebody had
[26:35] mentioned
[26:37] uh a visiting minister had mentioned in
[26:39] another church, not here, had visited a
[26:41] couple churches in Ontario. And he
[26:43] mentioned that some were eternal life
[26:47] and some would get eternal life.
[26:51] And that's on scripture and it's also on
[26:53] message.
[26:55] And so I just going to let the prophet
[26:57] answer that for you. I I I explained
[27:00] some of that light yesterday, but I this
[27:02] was my quote that came up when I was
[27:06] doing my devotions this morning. The
[27:09] very first one right under my title,
[27:10] Vicki,
[27:12] Brother Bam says, "Put me on record of
[27:15] that there's only one form of eternal
[27:18] life
[27:20] and God alone
[27:22] has eternal life."
[27:25] So to have eternal life, you had to come
[27:27] from God. You had to be in Genesis
[27:29] 1:26-27.
[27:31] Let us make man
[27:34] in our image.
[27:36] And here, Brother Bam says there's not
[27:38] there's no two types
[27:42] of eternal life.
[27:45] There's no new two types of eternal
[27:47] life. So, you know, when somebody comes,
[27:50] you know, it it was just God. I I knew
[27:53] it didn't sound right when the man was
[27:56] ministering,
[27:58] but here's what the prophet says.
[28:00] There's no two types of eternal life.
[28:03] One, eternal life, and that's all that
[28:06] lives. Remember that it's put on your
[28:09] note, too. Everything that's being made
[28:14] that had a beginning has an end. That's
[28:16] our flesh.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Our flesh had a beginning. Our flesh
[28:20] will have an end. But the real you, the
[28:22] theophony inside you, never had a
[28:25] beginning
[28:26] &gt;&gt; if you came from God.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; And everything that had a beginning has
[28:29] an end. But only and only that that made
[28:33] no beginning has no end. And there's
[28:36] only one thing that never had a
[28:38] beginning, and that was God.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; So if somebody came from God,
[28:45] &gt;&gt; you're eternal.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; Somebody asked Brother Bramman questions
[28:49] and answers. two will be there. You'll
[28:51] be there if you came from God and your
[28:53] name was wrote in the Lamb's book of
[28:54] life. If you were in the thought of God.
[28:57] Amen.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; And that's the only way that you can
[29:03] raise in the resurrection is to have
[29:06] eternal life within you. See, the only
[29:08] way you'll ever come back is something
[29:10] that had no beginning. Then you got
[29:13] eternal life, sons and daughters of God.
[29:16] And you can no more die
[29:19] than God can die because you are a part
[29:24] of God. And you know what God's trying
[29:27] to show us in these messages? And I I I
[29:30] pray that next Sunday it's going to be
[29:32] the last and then we're going to go on
[29:33] to something nice in December, something
[29:36] uh butterfly. But uh what in the past
[29:40] history always repeats itself.
[29:44] spirits never die. That's right.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to show you in the New
[29:47] Testament, well, matter of fact, in in
[29:49] quotes, Brother Bam said, everybody that
[29:52] was serving God always tried to divide
[29:55] God's people. The disciples tried to do
[29:58] that. We showed you last week and and
[30:00] and you're we're going to look at new
[30:02] brand new scriptures where everybody's
[30:04] trying to I got it and they don't.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; And that's not of God.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; It's not of God. And I'm I'm well, no, I
[30:14] I almost said I'm sorry to harp on this,
[30:16] but I'm actually not sorry because I'm
[30:17] just obeying what God's genuinely laid
[30:21] on my heart. And the prophet said a huge
[30:25] amount about it.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; And and God don't want nobody to be
[30:29] deceived into thinking
[30:32] that we're right when we're actually
[30:35] wrong.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Watch how we carry on in this scripture
[30:39] of Matthew 23 and 13. But woe unto you
[30:42] scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites,
[30:45] for you shut up the kingdom of God
[30:47] against men.
[30:50] Here's Jesus telling the scribes and
[30:52] Pharisees, don't take people out of the
[30:54] kingdom of heaven.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; I'm Jeho, you know, pret I'm Jehovah.
[31:02] I'll decide who gets in the kingdom of
[31:04] heaven.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; He's calling them hypocrites.
[31:11] Hey, now the Pharisees and scribes were
[31:13] the Christians of that day.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; We We need We just need to leave it
[31:23] alone. Don't Don't interfere with what
[31:26] God's doing.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. For ye never watch this. Let's
[31:33] carrying on on verse 13. For ye neither
[31:36] go in yourself, neither suffer ye them
[31:39] that are entering in to go in.
[31:43] It's talking about going into heaven.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; See how they were trying to say, "We're
[31:49] going into heaven, but you're not."
[31:52] &gt;&gt; And God calls them hypocrites.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:58] Now, one thing we clarified, and I want
[32:00] to clarify it this week, you cannot come
[32:03] to truth
[32:05] and turn it down.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; That's iniquity.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about that.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; But there will be ones in the world that
[32:12] have not received as much blessing of
[32:14] truth as you.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; And you have no right to judge them.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I mean? I'm not talking
[32:22] about iniquity. You can't come to this
[32:24] message. That is the gospel truth, the
[32:27] Bible revealed. And turn it down. It's
[32:29] not possible.
[32:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz it is the Bible unveiled.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; But there will be those that have not
[32:35] come to this message.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; That if you judge them, Christ will call
[32:39] you a hypocrite.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible says we are judged onto a
[32:46] mount that we have received.
[32:49] Upon the revelation that you have
[32:51] received, you will be judged. If you
[32:54] turn down the revelation of this message
[32:56] that God give you, you'll be judged.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; But don't you go judging somebody else
[33:01] that ain't received that revelation.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Verse 14.
[33:13] Woe unto you scribes and Pharisees,
[33:15] hypocrites,
[33:17] for ye devour widows houses,
[33:20] and for pretense make long prayers.
[33:24] Therefore, you shall receive a greater
[33:29] damnation.
[33:31] Wait a minute. They thought they were
[33:33] going to receive a greater heaven.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:38] They thought because they were the
[33:40] message of the hour following Moses law
[33:43] that they were going to have a bigger
[33:45] portion of heaven.
[33:47] And Jesus said, "You will have a bigger
[33:49] damnation."
[33:55] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, God wants to show you
[33:57] something.
[34:02] Woe onto you scribes and Pharisees,
[34:04] hypocrites,
[34:06] for you compress the sea and land, and
[34:08] make one
[34:11] &gt;&gt; procelite.
[34:13] And when he is made, ye make him twofold
[34:16] more children of hell than ye
[34:19] yourselves.
[34:22] Yeah.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; Let's look into some things that the
[34:26] prophet said,
[34:29] which is so true. I mentioned this last
[34:31] week, but you know, it's good to hear it
[34:34] from our prophet.
[34:37] You know, I told you last week that
[34:39] there's 52 countries that the Bible is
[34:41] it's illegal to have a Bible.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Let's see what Brother Brown said about
[34:45] it.
[34:48] Because he did. He said, "But I'll tell
[34:50] you one thing, friends. It's not fair.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; All these preachers, you know, you know,
[34:57] sometimes pastors need to travel."
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam talked about that.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; I I'm just going to jump ahead and read
[35:07] it because you've heard the message
[35:10] preached and preached and preached and
[35:14] preached and preached.
[35:18] My next quote says that
[35:24] &gt;&gt; and you decide if you value it. But I'll
[35:27] tell you what, when I go to a country
[35:29] that people haven't heard it preached,
[35:31] they come days early. They come in the
[35:34] hundreds. They drive five hours on a
[35:36] Wednesday night and come back on a
[35:39] Thursday night. 5 hours drive
[35:43] because they can't help themsel.
[35:47] But because you've seen the ocean so
[35:49] much, you'll never draw a picture of the
[35:51] ocean because it's become common to you.
[35:56] The prophet said that all you pictures
[35:58] preachers stay in America here and
[36:01] preach the gospel over and over and over
[36:05] to the people when there's half the
[36:08] world
[36:14] or nearly twothirds of them that have
[36:16] never heard the name of Jesus Christ.
[36:19] Now, we had somebody here and said, "You
[36:21] can't go to heaven, can't go in the
[36:22] rapture unless you know brother Bram's
[36:24] name." Here, brother Bram saying that
[36:26] half the world hasn't even heard Jesus
[36:28] name.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you, I was looking
[36:32] through these quotes, there was about
[36:34] 428
[36:36] or 38, I forget it, and there was spots
[36:39] in there. He said, "He will hold us
[36:41] accountable."
[36:43] You know why? Because he says to go into
[36:46] all the world and preach the gospel.
[36:48] That's your only commission.
[36:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; You should tell everybody you get I
[36:58] don't mean I don't mean throw your
[37:00] pearls before the swine, but there's
[37:02] some people that are just gifted that
[37:05] every time they get a chance, they say,
[37:07] "Do you know Jesus Christ?"
[37:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Are you a Christian?
[37:12] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Bam told the story
[37:14] about being in the hospital and he asked
[37:15] he was going to pray for his person. You
[37:17] remember the story? And he was going to
[37:18] pull, he wanted to know if he pulled the
[37:20] curtain. He said, "Are you a Christian,
[37:22] ma'am? I'm going to pray for this sick
[37:23] person over. I'll let you know I'm a
[37:25] Baptist and I burn a candle every He" He
[37:27] said, "I never asked you that." You know
[37:29] what we would say? I'll let you know I'm
[37:31] a message believer and I go to so and
[37:33] so's church.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; I never asked you that.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Because the devil go all those message
[37:41] churches every Sunday
[37:43] &gt;&gt; and he don't never miss.
[37:45] Yeah. Yeah. That's right.
[37:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said he's in every
[37:50] gathering.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; And here the prophet says, "And there's
[38:00] half the people in the world, they
[38:01] nearly twothirds have never heard the
[38:03] name of Jesus." And us fat message
[38:06] preachers can stand here and say, "You
[38:09] don't have the opportunity to go in the
[38:10] rapture unless you know brother Brandham
[38:12] personally."
[38:14] when we haven't had enough gall and get
[38:16] up to go and preach the gospel to the
[38:19] whole world and that was our only
[38:20] commission. Brother Bram said we built
[38:23] hospitals, we built churches, we built
[38:25] nice houses. He said he brother Bram
[38:29] said this. He said it's a sin to build a
[38:32] fancy two or three or four million
[38:34] dollar church here and the people over
[38:36] there preaching haven't eaten three
[38:39] meals a week.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; A week. Yeah,
[38:47] &gt;&gt; a weak
[38:52] &gt;&gt; brotherham said that. Anybody wants
[38:55] quotes? I can give them to you. A sin.
[38:58] We live so high in the hog and we think
[39:01] we got all the answers to decide who's
[39:03] going to go in the rapture.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; That's unbelievable.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; He said, watch this. He said, "You just
[39:12] stayed in a humble here and preached the
[39:16] gospel
[39:18] and you're and you you and the and
[39:21] preached it till your gospel harden."
[39:27] That's exactly what's happened in
[39:30] message churches in rich countries.
[39:34] &gt;&gt; Because when you get hardened, you get
[39:36] bitter and arrogant
[39:39] &gt;&gt; and puffed up.
[39:42] I can tell you what the prophet said
[39:43] that God, the Holy Spirit does when you
[39:45] get arrogant.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; He just flies away
[39:51] &gt;&gt; and then those heathens over yonder are
[39:54] dying and we say, "Well, you can't
[39:55] come."
[39:59] That's my vision. I go to them. Brother
[40:01] man said, "I go to them." And there's
[40:03] where God has blessed
[40:06] because they're hungering and they're
[40:10] thirsting and they want to hear
[40:12] something.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; You know,
[40:20] I'm just showing you what our prophet
[40:22] said.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; You know, like I would just say it like
[40:26] this. What are we going to do with these
[40:28] quotes?
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[40:30] What are we going to do with these
[40:32] scriptures?
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Our next one here.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Now you wonder why it's hard to preach
[40:42] in America.
[40:46] Then he goes the next paragraph. He says
[40:48] in India, he said it was estimated that
[40:50] there was a half a million people there.
[40:53] He preached to
[40:55] try to get half a million people
[40:56] together in Canada and America.
[40:59] You know why there was half a million?
[41:01] It wasn't just because they had a lot of
[41:02] people because they'll do anything to
[41:05] get there.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; Let's go to our next the next paragraph.
[41:10] He said, "Do you not believe that we
[41:14] ought to be building?" He said, "I do
[41:16] not believe, sorry, I do not believe
[41:18] that we ought to be building three and
[41:20] four million dollar churches and
[41:22] preaching Jesus is coming when men on
[41:26] the mission field are preaching the
[41:27] gospel with no shoes."
[41:31] That's not right.
[41:44] here. He said, next paragraph said, "The
[41:46] other day under investigation, a fellow
[41:49] come up to Brother Bram. He said, "You
[41:51] buy souls, you buy your suits, sorry,
[41:55] from pennies in the States. They're $17.
[41:58] I can tell they're cheap suits."
[42:01] Brother Bam said, "Yes, that's right.
[42:03] They're cheap suits." He said, 'Well,
[42:07] you can afford a better suit than that.
[42:12] And this is what Brother Bam said,
[42:15] paragraph 25. He said, "Not when my
[42:19] brothers and sisters are eating two
[42:20] meals a week, no shoes on their feet,
[42:24] preaching the gospel, and I'm stand and
[42:26] I'm gospel that I'm standing for. And I
[42:29] can't afford better than that."
[42:34] You see,
[42:36] &gt;&gt; see how it's so all I'm showing you is
[42:39] see how it's so easy for us here to
[42:41] become arrogant.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; If you ever travel to the majority of
[42:48] the world, you'll never come home
[42:50] arrogant.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[42:53] &gt;&gt; that's exactly right.
[42:55] Now, this is still our prophet talking.
[42:57] Verse 26,
[43:00] he said, "We have no right, no sir.
[43:04] No, we have no rights to blow millions
[43:08] for baked buildings."
[43:11] That's almost
[43:15] any more than millions are dying that
[43:17] don't even know the name of Jesus Christ
[43:21] as savior and are crying and begging
[43:26] to receive this message.
[43:32] and we put a big church up on the corner
[43:35] and prost like this one and the other on
[43:37] the corner over here and have fun of
[43:39] them and make fun of them and tell them
[43:41] that they're all wrong. Millions of such
[43:44] a thing are going on. Millions are dying
[43:47] nearly yearly and never heard the name
[43:51] of Jesus
[43:53] one time. Now watch how he finishes
[43:56] this. While we're fussing, they're dying
[43:59] over there without knowing Christ.
[44:03] God, can everybody see the bottom of
[44:06] that?
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Is any brother? You don't have to get
[44:15] God is going to hold you responsible
[44:18] on that day.
[44:26] I'm just I just am naive enough to
[44:28] believe that.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Watch how the prophet ends this. He
[44:35] said, "Now, that wasn't in my sermon
[44:37] notes. That wasn't in my text, but I
[44:40] can't help myself from saying those
[44:42] things."
[44:49] I just say, "Wow."
[44:52] I just say, "I wonder if we're really,"
[44:55] you know what I mean? We We should,
[44:57] Brother Bam said, and and we're going to
[44:59] get to some other quotes, but he said,
[45:01] "If you've received what you've
[45:03] received, you should be so humble.
[45:07] You should be so gratitude.
[45:10] should just be oh Jesus
[45:13] I don't deserve salvation
[45:19] &gt;&gt; but in many cases sadly
[45:22] it brings a religious spirit of
[45:25] arrogance but you know why you know why
[45:27] brother Bram said that Paul had the
[45:29] infirmity that he had when Paul went
[45:32] back to Jesus three times he said my
[45:34] grace is sufficient for you is because
[45:38] of the enormous revelation of this
[45:41] message.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; This message, Brother Brham said, I
[45:46] preached what Paul preached.
[45:48] And he said, "If I hadn't have plagued
[45:50] your body with an infirmity, you would
[45:52] have got lifted up."
[45:57] And so all of us that don't have an
[45:59] infirmity.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wow.
[46:12] I don't mean that you can change the
[46:14] world. I don't mean that you can go
[46:15] preach to every soul in the world, but
[46:17] you can sure not be arrogant.
[46:22] I don't mean that you can feed
[46:23] everybody. And I'm not asking you for
[46:25] your money, but you can sure be humble.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Say, "God, you have really blessed me
[46:31] and my family abundantly above what I
[46:36] could even imagine or comprehend."
[46:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[46:48] Let's go to our next uh scripture. Those
[46:51] that are born of God, do not commit sin.
[46:55] For the seed, here's the prophet
[46:57] talking. I just seeing this is questions
[46:59] and answers. He says, "The seed of God,
[47:02] the promise of Abraham,"
[47:05] he's just talking about the
[47:06] resurrection. This is kind of off our
[47:08] topic here. He said, "But the seat, the
[47:10] uh 171, sorry Vicki, paragraph 171, the
[47:14] seed of God remainth in him. The Holy
[47:16] Ghost
[47:19] comes and abideth not from the be
[47:22] meeting to meeting but eternal.
[47:26] Now if you want to put the scripture
[47:28] down Ephesians 6 or Ephesians 4:30,
[47:31] grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby
[47:33] you've been sealed until the day of your
[47:35] redemption. See, the seed of God remains
[47:38] in you. If you came from God, Genesis
[47:41] 1:26,
[47:43] what I'm trying to show you is is there
[47:45] will be people that aren't manifesting
[47:47] that yet.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; But they still are that.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; And so you can be judging somebody
[47:55] that's living worldly, manifesting like
[47:57] Paul was a murderer, but he was chosen
[48:00] of God before the foundation of the
[48:01] world. And so when you judge that
[48:04] person, you're actually judging God. And
[48:06] you saying, "But he didn't look like
[48:07] God." God says, "So
[48:14] that's where we get in trouble." Next
[48:16] paragraph. And now then you see a man
[48:19] disagreeing with God's word and saying,
[48:22] "Oh, that there was for another age."
[48:28] Watch what he says here.
[48:30] When the promise was to whosoever will,
[48:33] let him come.
[48:37] See, we just have to be really careful
[48:40] that we don't put somebody out that
[48:42] God's put in.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; See, because God said it was for
[48:46] whosoever will.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Just remember,
[48:56] he is an unbeliever
[48:59] and he's not of God. Here, Brother Bram
[49:03] saying, if you're putting somebody out
[49:06] because of your judgment
[49:08] when God said it was for whosoever will,
[49:10] and they could be they could have
[49:12] literally came from the side of God. No,
[49:15] they're not manifesting it yet. The
[49:18] woman at the well that Jesus had an
[49:19] appointment with wasn't manifesting a
[49:22] daughter of God, but she was a daughter
[49:24] of God
[49:26] when Jesus met her.
[49:31] He said, 'The people that do that,
[49:33] remember, they're not even a believer.
[49:36] They're not of God.
[49:40] Wow.
[49:43] That that's that's heavy.
[49:52] Amen.
[49:54] Let's go to another quote here. The
[49:56] father promised that you would
[50:01] and I believe that you are risen from
[50:03] the dead 2,000 years ago and are alive
[50:06] tonight calling simple people just as
[50:09] you always did. One here and one there.
[50:12] Now watch. Now this this is where you
[50:14] can't lock it in your message.
[50:18] Now this is what the prophet said and he
[50:20] brought the message.
[50:28] Simple people that you just always did.
[50:31] One here and one there. No groups, no
[50:34] organizations and no great mannerisms of
[50:37] what a man had done.
[50:43] Wow.
[50:46] That's what he preached in ' 64 after
[50:48] the seals. It don't sound to me like
[50:50] brother Bram was preaching that you have
[50:52] to know him to go in the rapture.
[50:55] This is 64. This is after the greatest
[50:58] unveiling of revelation ever happened.
[51:05] Romans 4.
[51:08] But I'm I'm going to I I don't want to
[51:12] but this message is the greatest
[51:13] privilege to know that it ever was.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; But it see how it should just you just
[51:20] said, "Oh, God." Like I was a sinner and
[51:23] you showed me all of this. Wow.
[51:29] Romans 4 3-12. And I I want to read this
[51:31] and just show you how how
[51:36] people have always tried to block people
[51:38] from God.
[51:41] Christians have always blocked people
[51:43] from God. You know the Bible says this,
[51:45] who is the accuser of the brethren? The
[51:48] Bible says Satan is the accuser of the
[51:50] brethren. But you know who he works
[51:52] through? Make believers.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; You have somebody come up and says, "I
[51:57] don't think you got the baptism of the
[51:58] Holy Ghost." You know who just spoke out
[51:59] of them? Satan.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Satan just needed a vessel
[52:05] &gt;&gt; to speak out of. Watch Romans 4 here. I,
[52:08] you know, I don't know if we've ever
[52:09] I've I've never quite read it this way
[52:12] that God revealed. For what saith the
[52:15] scriptures? Is that okay if we read the
[52:17] scriptures?
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Abraham believed God and it was counted
[52:23] to him for righteousness.
[52:26] We believe that.
[52:29] Now to him that workketh is the reward
[52:33] not reckoned of grace,
[52:35] but of debt.
[52:38] Watch what he means here. Now to him
[52:41] that workketh is the reward not reckoned
[52:45] of grace. You see, if you think you can
[52:47] get to heaven, what he's saying here, if
[52:49] you think you can get to heaven by your
[52:51] good works, then Jesus died in vain.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; He didn't even have to die on the cross
[52:55] if you could have got there by doing a
[52:57] lot of work.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:59] But verse five, but to him that workketh
[53:02] not, uhoh.
[53:06] To him that workketh not, but believeth
[53:08] on him that justified the the message
[53:11] believers.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[53:18] God actually justifies ungodly people.
[53:22] His faith is counted for righteousness.
[53:29] That's an amazing verse.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; I don't have to work to get into heaven.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; It was amazing grace. I believe you will
[53:41] do works because you love him of I'm not
[53:43] I'm you know I'm preaching this morning
[53:45] because of that. But him that workketh
[53:48] not,
[53:50] &gt;&gt; but believeth on him that justifyth only
[53:53] message believers,
[53:59] the ungodly,
[54:01] his faith will be counted for
[54:04] righteousness. Next verse, Vicki.
[54:09] Even as David also
[54:13] described the blessedness
[54:17] of a man unto whom God imputth
[54:21] righteousness
[54:23] without works.
[54:27] See, God ain't counting on where you
[54:29] were born, where you were where you went
[54:32] to church, where which we believe in
[54:34] that. But see, if you were, what I'm
[54:37] trying to say is if you were born in the
[54:40] one-third or half the world that's never
[54:43] heard of Jesus and God reveals himself
[54:46] to you by revelation and you believe in
[54:49] God, however that God reveals that to
[54:52] you,
[54:55] you won't have the revelation that you
[54:56] and me have.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; But you'll be there just like us.
[55:02] Those that are first shall be last, and
[55:04] those that are last think they'll be
[55:07] first,
[55:09] &gt;&gt; the last will be first.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Saying, blessed are those, next verse,
[55:17] who iniquity iniquities are forgiven and
[55:20] whose sins are covered.
[55:23] We serve an amazing God
[55:26] because see the amazing God that we
[55:28] serve is no respectors of person. Yeah,
[55:34] &gt;&gt; iniquities are forgiven. That's my sins
[55:39] &gt;&gt; and those sins are covered. Blessed is
[55:41] the man whom the Lord will not impute
[55:44] sin. But we as believers will call out
[55:50] and we're allowing Satan to work through
[55:53] us.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; I don't think they got it. I could never
[55:57] go there.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Careful. Amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Verse nine, cometh this blessedness
[56:09] then upon the circumcision
[56:12] only. You know what this means? That
[56:16] means that they were following the
[56:18] message truth of the day. Moses,
[56:26] watch this. I'm not pulling this out of
[56:28] context.
[56:30] This is Paul's teaching. Brother Bram
[56:32] said, "I preach what Paul preached."
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Paul laid the foundation. He said, "If
[56:37] any man from any an angel come and try
[56:41] to change my teaching, let him be a
[56:44] curse."
[56:47] &gt;&gt; And there's message ministers that are
[56:49] preaching that only the circumcised are
[56:50] going in the rapture.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Not what Paul said. Verse
[57:02] nine,
[57:04] I have to read it off my iPad because I
[57:06] got it highlighted. Cometh this
[57:08] blessedness upon the circumcision only
[57:13] or upon the uncircumcision
[57:16] also.
[57:17] Paul's asking us a question.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; For I say that faith was reckoned unto
[57:24] Abraham for righteousness.
[57:27] How was it then reckoned? Then he was
[57:29] circumcised or in uncircumcision.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; See, Paul is literally playing with your
[57:39] belief.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; Not in circumcision, but in
[57:45] uncircumcision.
[57:47] He received the sign of circumcision.
[57:50] The seal of righteousness is faith which
[57:53] is mean you must be born again.
[58:00] the seal of righteousness of faith that
[58:02] he had yet being uncircumcised.
[58:06] So he had not yet come into the message
[58:09] church of the day yet being
[58:11] uncircumcised that he might be the
[58:13] father father of all them that believe
[58:18] though they being not circumcised
[58:21] that the righteousness might impute unto
[58:25] them. Watch this I wish you could have
[58:28] put that up that last word unto them
[58:32] also.
[58:35] That don't sound like God's dividing the
[58:37] group of believers.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; That don't sound like he's saying,
[58:42] "Well, this church is going and this one
[58:44] isn't, and you got to have this pastor
[58:46] to go in the rapture, this." No, you
[58:48] must be born again.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; You must have the Holy Spirit
[58:52] tabernacled inside you.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Unto them also. No, no, no, no. They
[58:59] can't go because they don't believe.
[59:01] Remember, they stoned Stephen because he
[59:04] disobeyed Moses law
[59:09] &gt;&gt; today. They can't stone people, but they
[59:11] can kill your influence.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; They ain't saying that guy ain't
[59:14] preaching the message. Don't go to that
[59:17] church. You're going to have big
[59:19] troubles.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Just reading Paul's letter.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[59:33] Where are we? Did we read 11? Yes. So
[59:35] verse 12. And the father of the
[59:38] circumcision to them who are not of the
[59:42] circumcision only, but who also walk in
[59:48] the steps of faith of our father
[59:51] Abraham, which he being yet
[59:54] uncircumcised. Now there was God opening
[59:57] his arms
[59:59] and including all the believers
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; that believed on him.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; That's the spirit of Christ.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Now is this Bible? Is this the me the
[1:00:11] the greatest messenger to the New
[1:00:13] Testament age?
[1:00:15] And brother Brown preached what Paul
[1:00:16] preached
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; and he didn't divide it. He didn't
[1:00:20] divide the people. He said them also.
[1:00:25] and Abraham that the the the
[1:00:27] uncircumcised would follow in the faith
[1:00:29] of Abraham
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; even though they hadn't yet come into
[1:00:33] the fullness of the message law.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:00:41] That's that's just amazing to me. Amen.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; It's just amazing how much God has
[1:00:47] blessed us
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; with what we have. Let's let's read some
[1:00:50] quotes of our prophet and we we won't be
[1:00:53] too long this morning, but I I just want
[1:00:54] to lay some things down here that may
[1:00:57] shock you. Now you got
[1:01:01] Now you got Now God doesn't limit
[1:01:03] himself. Oh, I got to wait for this one.
[1:01:08] Oh,
[1:01:14] I think we should have a ministers
[1:01:15] meeting
[1:01:18] now. God don't limit himself to any
[1:01:20] church. No, he doesn't. Remember when
[1:01:23] the disciples got to thinking one time
[1:01:25] that they were the only ones that would
[1:01:27] go, the only ones, Jesus said, verily
[1:01:30] next day, he sent out 70 others.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; By the way, this is brother Brandham.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; For anybody that says, "I'm not a
[1:01:42] message believer preacher."
[1:01:45] Yeah.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Uh
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; what are they preaching?
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; What are 90% of message preachers
[1:01:52] preaching that we're the only ones? When
[1:01:55] Jesus said to the scene that the
[1:01:57] disciples refused everybody else,
[1:01:59] Brother Bram said the very next day he
[1:02:01] sent out 70 different people.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; You know what I said? Wow. Oh, you want
[1:02:09] to believe it?
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Watch this next paragraph. God never
[1:02:15] wants anyone to build anything around
[1:02:18] themselves.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; All the glory goes to Jesus Christ,
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; the son of God. See, we mustn't try to
[1:02:28] think of ourselves
[1:02:30] or our church or we must spread our arms
[1:02:35] out and look for God. That's right.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; But what we do is we go
[1:02:44] They don't see the quotes I see. Bless
[1:02:47] God.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Oh, this is actually the
[1:02:53] prophet preaching.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, well.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:03:01] Next one.
[1:03:03] They get better.
[1:03:05] Remember last Sunday I told you I had
[1:03:07] some unbelievable stuff?
[1:03:10] Amen.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Look at the top line.
[1:03:14] Many
[1:03:15] persons have been
[1:03:18] what's that word? That's a big word.
[1:03:20] Deceived. Oh
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; wow.
[1:03:30] And receiving the Holy Ghost.
[1:03:34] As I said, they got doctrines today. Oh,
[1:03:39] and by the way, this is God's messenger.
[1:03:43] They got messages, doctrines of this
[1:03:46] message that says like Elijah's garments
[1:03:52] and all those other things,
[1:03:55] manifestations
[1:03:57] of sons of God
[1:04:00] and all these different
[1:04:03] isms
[1:04:06] and so forth
[1:04:08] in the message today.
[1:04:12] People fall blindly on there and go to
[1:04:17] some kind of separation
[1:04:20] and rise back up with a uhoh, what's
[1:04:24] that big word again?
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Arrogant spirit,
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; indifferent,
[1:04:33] fussing,
[1:04:35] and hightempered.
[1:04:38] Wait a minute. Wait a minute. One more
[1:04:40] line.
[1:04:42] That's not brother Dale preaching and
[1:04:45] that's not the spirit
[1:04:48] of God.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute.
[1:04:55] Wait a minute.
[1:04:58] Never seen that quote before.
[1:05:02] Do you know what the doctrines? He's
[1:05:04] talking about Elijah's message.
[1:05:10] You can doctrinate this message right
[1:05:14] into hell.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Right into hell. Yeah,
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; you got to have Elijah's garments and
[1:05:26] all these other things,
[1:05:29] manifestations of sons of God and all
[1:05:33] these other different
[1:05:36] isms.
[1:05:38] You know, we have a very small church
[1:05:39] here, but I have different people say,
[1:05:40] "Well, I've never seen it done like you
[1:05:41] do it there." I said, "So,
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; and all these other different
[1:05:48] isms
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; doctrines."
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Do you know the word at the top line was
[1:05:56] they're deceived?
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; And they're deceived because in
[1:06:01] receiving the Holy Ghost, they thought
[1:06:03] they had the Holy Ghost because they
[1:06:05] followed the doctrines of Elijah.
[1:06:10] And brother Bram said, "That's not
[1:06:13] the spirit
[1:06:15] of God." Thank you very much. Nobody
[1:06:19] would believe this if Vicki didn't put
[1:06:20] that up on the screen. I could hardly
[1:06:22] believe it myself when it came on my
[1:06:24] screen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Let's go to some other ones that show
[1:06:30] you who we're serving.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Then look at God and don't look at a
[1:06:37] man. God don't want to show me. He wants
[1:06:41] to show himself. It's he.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; See, you have to know Jesus Christ to
[1:06:50] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Here's another one. Next paragraph.
[1:06:57] May you always bear in mind to be a gem
[1:07:00] in the crown of Jesus Christ. Paul said
[1:07:03] to the church that you are jewels or
[1:07:06] gems in his crown. And we want to be
[1:07:10] gems in Jesus Christ's crown. So, how
[1:07:12] would we go about that? Oh, you got them
[1:07:14] both up there. We don't want to never
[1:07:17] put man in it.
[1:07:20] You forget anything about me.
[1:07:23] I am your brother, a sinner, saved by
[1:07:25] grace and not even fit to live.
[1:07:29] That's exactly the truth.
[1:07:32] And I ain't saying that to be humble.
[1:07:34] That's facts.
[1:07:37] There's nothing in me.
[1:07:41] Not one sound thing at all.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Now, if you would trust me to interpret
[1:07:47] that, Brother Bram's saying, "You don't
[1:07:49] have to know my name to go in the
[1:07:51] rapture."
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; If you don't, and oh, by the way, that's
[1:07:58] the seventh seal.
[1:08:03] And brother Bram said, "If he ever
[1:08:04] preached anything anointed,
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; it was in the seals."
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; And if he ever preached anything great
[1:08:10] to the bride of Christ, it was the
[1:08:12] seventh seal because he came down and
[1:08:15] tabernacled inside of his bride.
[1:08:19] Oh wow. We are so blessed.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; But God hates an arrogant spirit. How
[1:08:27] many wants to go to the restaurant and
[1:08:29] see somebody else's kid
[1:08:32] act like you know you know what I mean?
[1:08:38] Arrogant, disrespectful, fussing,
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; you know, like a bad dog. Everybody
[1:08:43] likes a dog that obeys,
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; you know.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; God don't like to see kids that way
[1:08:54] either.
[1:08:57] I mean, arrogant is the very worst.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; Forget I'm not talking about Miss Just
[1:09:02] that's not what I want to eat, mother.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; You know, when we used to go to the
[1:09:08] restaurant, our kids were small. Lan
[1:09:10] actually ordered for the kids. She never
[1:09:13] asked the kids what she wanted. They
[1:09:15] want shrimp, lobster, banana cream pie.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; No, this is what you're getting.
[1:09:26] See, that's arrogant.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Next quote.
[1:09:33] Not me. I ain't the word.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; He's the word.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; See, if I was the word, there's only one
[1:09:44] person that can be the word.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; That was Jesus. He was God's spoken word
[1:09:53] by a virgin birth. But the word is of
[1:09:57] the Lord.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Watch this. People have tried. The
[1:10:01] prophets
[1:10:03] wasn't
[1:10:05] the word.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; I've heard that the prophet and the word
[1:10:12] are the same thing.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:10:19] Thank I'm sure glad we I got a few
[1:10:21] friends, man. Cuz like like I am
[1:10:25] actually reading.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Like I mean if if you believe the other,
[1:10:29] what are we gonna do with this one?
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Like when I go to a minister's meeting
[1:10:33] and they bring up something else, they
[1:10:34] said, "But what are we going to do with
[1:10:35] these dozen over here?"
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Cuz he said they had to go like this.
[1:10:43] The prophets wasn't the word, but the
[1:10:46] word of the Lord came to the prophets.
[1:10:49] Not that they wasn't the word. The word
[1:10:52] came to them.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let's let's we're I I know
[1:11:04] I'm reading a lot of but this is we're
[1:11:06] really preaching doctrine this morning
[1:11:07] and it's good for you to see it and the
[1:11:10] scripture and our prophet.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Next next quote Vicki and you're doing
[1:11:16] amazing. The Lord God I do not see why
[1:11:20] every person should be not healed.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; The Lord Oh Lord, we believe we believe
[1:11:26] the the messenger the messenger
[1:11:33] Wait a minute.
[1:11:36] Wait a minute.
[1:11:39] The messenger.
[1:11:44] The messenger is the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:52] Our decision is made right now and we
[1:11:56] believe it. Wait a minute. I thought
[1:11:58] Brother Brham was the messenger.
[1:12:01] What are we going to do with this quote?
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; I don't have no problem with brother
[1:12:05] Bram being the messenger, but brother
[1:12:07] Bram said that the messenger is the Holy
[1:12:09] Ghost.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; So like I just need to know what to do
[1:12:15] with this one.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Okay, but maybe just hang on because
[1:12:19] you're going to have to tell me what to
[1:12:20] do with the next one, too. And the the
[1:12:23] next quote there, Vicki, I'm I'll go
[1:12:25] slow because we got to see this. is
[1:12:27] seeing is believing.
[1:12:29] And those that raise their hands, may
[1:12:32] they be partakers
[1:12:34] of this great Holy Spirit, the messenger
[1:12:38] of the last day.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Whoa. What am I Whoa, wait a minute.
[1:12:43] Wait, wait, wait. What am I going to do
[1:12:45] with this one also?
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; But wait, before you tell me what to do
[1:12:50] with this one, maybe we go to the next
[1:12:52] one, too.
[1:13:02] Oh, you already got it. I'm sorry,
[1:13:03] Vicki. Man, you're faster than me. The
[1:13:05] messenger of the Holy Spirit.
[1:13:09] And the messenger of the Holy Spirit is
[1:13:11] with the church elected.
[1:13:14] That's us doing the same things which
[1:13:17] makes him Christ the same yesterday,
[1:13:20] today, and forever. Who is the messenger
[1:13:23] of this hour? Oh, wait a minute.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; There's a whole bunch of preachers that
[1:13:31] should read this quote.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; No, man.
[1:13:36] The Holy Ghost is the messenger of this
[1:13:42] hour.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; This is actually a 60 almost the end of
[1:13:48] 62 quote too.
[1:13:53] I know what you're thinking. Brother
[1:13:54] Brandham was wrong on that one. I
[1:13:56] understand. The next quote's a 64 quote.
[1:14:00] That's after the seals.
[1:14:03] Okay. I like I I I'll agree with anybody
[1:14:06] that's like functionable at all.
[1:14:09] And the same thing he's done today what
[1:14:12] he did do. He sent us the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:15] The Holy Ghost is the messenger
[1:14:19] and the scriptures identify
[1:14:21] identification
[1:14:23] of himself identifies him among us the
[1:14:27] same yesterday, today and forever. And
[1:14:29] the token is the assurance that we are.
[1:14:37] Help me out. Second last word.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; What are we scared about?
[1:14:43] Now, this is after the seals.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know what you're thinking. That
[1:14:53] was like that was a different message.
[1:14:55] So, let's go to the next one. Like, I
[1:14:57] got a few of them that you're going to
[1:14:58] have to clarify with us cuz I don't hear
[1:15:02] the same message from ministers when I
[1:15:04] travel.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; What I hear is worship of a prophet.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; That's what I hear.
[1:15:12] Like it's okay if you want to worship
[1:15:13] the prophet, but just identify it as
[1:15:15] worshiping the prophet. That would be
[1:15:17] the same as you worshiping a good
[1:15:19] pastor.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; I know many people wouldn't worship me,
[1:15:23] but if you went to like a really popular
[1:15:25] big church where there's 500, 700
[1:15:27] people.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; This is the feast of the trumpets. This
[1:15:32] is also 64. It's actually four months
[1:15:34] later. I wonder if God changed the
[1:15:36] anointing on his revelation.
[1:15:40] You know, this is only about a year
[1:15:41] before he died.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Grant, Lord, that the great messenger
[1:15:48] among us now,
[1:15:51] the great Christ, the Holy Spirit.
[1:15:55] Wow.
[1:16:02] Wow.
[1:16:05] You know what it is, brothers and
[1:16:07] sisters?
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; There's people deceived.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; They're flat out deceived.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; They're flat out deceived. I'm not
[1:16:18] embarrassed to brother Bram. I love
[1:16:20] Brother Bram, but God, nobody
[1:16:22] surrendered his life more maybe ever in
[1:16:26] history other than Jesus Christ
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; to the leadership of God.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Than Brother Brown. Yeah.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; But he was a vessel of clay used just
[1:16:36] like the man talking to you today.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; No, no. He surrendered his life more
[1:16:41] than I did. Oh, for sure he did.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; But he didn't die for your sins.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; No. No.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; It wasn't his message.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; This message I'm preaching to you ain't
[1:16:53] my message.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; If it is, you're we're all going to
[1:16:56] hell.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; You see?
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Am I crazy? No.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; See how in every history pass and in
[1:17:07] every church age and in every following,
[1:17:10] it said, "If you're not in my group,
[1:17:12] you're out."
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; And if you don't go to my pastor, you're
[1:17:16] out. If you don't sit under my prophet,
[1:17:18] you're out.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; And God, Jesus himself called the
[1:17:24] Sadducees and Pharisees hypocrites. And
[1:17:26] they were teaching Moses message.
[1:17:31] Yeah.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Listen, let's just clarify something.
[1:17:38] This message that Brother Brown brought
[1:17:40] is the truth.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm showing you.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. 100% the truth.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; And I'm showing it to you. But it's a
[1:17:52] different message that I hear when I go
[1:17:54] out and hear these bigname
[1:17:59] Yeah.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Like there's two kinds of eternal life.
[1:18:04] Some have it, some will get it. And
[1:18:06] brother Bram says flat out there is not.
[1:18:09] Now, I just I just need to know which
[1:18:12] one would I believe.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Which which quotes do we want to throw
[1:18:18] away?
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram, the Holy Spirit said, "If
[1:18:23] you add to or take away, you'll take
[1:18:25] your name out of the Lamb's Book of
[1:18:26] Life." So, I just really don't feel very
[1:18:29] comfortable taking any of these away.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; But I'll tell you something else. I
[1:18:34] don't feel very comfortable having those
[1:18:36] people come and minister behind this
[1:18:37] pulpit.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Cuz when I'm sitting there hearing lies
[1:18:40] in my pulpit, I get really nervous.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; I get to he geebies.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; I'm going, you don't have to worry,
[1:18:50] brother. You'll never be called back
[1:18:53] here again. Yeah,
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; that's right. Amen.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Somewhere we got to end this.
[1:19:05] Wow.
[1:19:10] Wow.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; I showed you multiple I I've read three
[1:19:16] scriptures
[1:19:18] and showed you multiple quotes and I
[1:19:20] mean very long. I I do believe that our
[1:19:23] revelation is progressive revelation.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; And I believe Brother Bram's message,
[1:19:28] God showed him more and more and it
[1:19:30] progressively got more.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; But when you're at the end of his life,
[1:19:34] it didn't get progressively more then.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Like when you're after the seals in 64,
[1:19:40] that was the message.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:55] Oh, I tell you what, I'm almost there. I
[1:19:57] see part three. We we we got we got
[1:20:01] hope. Just a real short quote here. The
[1:20:04] New Testament in Ephesians 4:30, that
[1:20:08] the Holy Ghost is the seal of God and
[1:20:11] the people in the last day
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; onto your eternal destination.
[1:20:20] this uh I literally have two quotes and
[1:20:23] just like that we're going to close.
[1:20:26] Amen.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:33] You can maybe pull up the next one
[1:20:35] there, Vicki. But out on the
[1:20:37] battlefield, he's talking about
[1:20:39] ministering where I've just returned
[1:20:42] from over in the heathen lands over
[1:20:45] here. And I received
[1:20:48] entertainment of 17 different religions
[1:20:51] in one afternoon. 17 different religions
[1:20:54] that denied that there was a Jesus
[1:20:57] Christ.
[1:20:59] And when we have twothirds of the world
[1:21:02] that's never heard of Jesus Christ and
[1:21:07] what we will do,
[1:21:09] what are we going to do to sit here and
[1:21:12] fuss whether we're Pentecostal,
[1:21:15] Nazarene, Pilgrim Holiness, go to this
[1:21:19] church, that church, Louisiana church,
[1:21:23] Texas church, Ohio church, Michigan
[1:21:25] church, Toronto church, or Wyoming
[1:21:28] church.
[1:21:31] Watch what he says. It's sinful to do so
[1:21:35] such, friend.
[1:21:38] It's sinful to do such, friend. It is.
[1:21:41] And I think twothirds of the world that
[1:21:43] has never heard the name of Jesus
[1:21:45] Christ. And out there on the field, and
[1:21:48] you will never notice whether
[1:21:50] you'll never notice whether you're a
[1:21:52] Baptist or Pentecostal or Presbyterian.
[1:21:55] The one thing that you get them get them
[1:21:59] from is heathenism to believe in the
[1:22:03] Lord.
[1:22:04] See, brother Bram said, he said multiple
[1:22:07] times, and this ain't in this quote, but
[1:22:09] he said, "I in no way, shape, or form am
[1:22:12] trying to form an organization to follow
[1:22:14] my name,
[1:22:16] follow me."
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm trying to point souls to
[1:22:20] Christ."
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; That's the man of God.
[1:22:24] Next paragraph. And here at home then,
[1:22:28] of course, we ain't got no more to do
[1:22:31] than just be content to fuss and carry
[1:22:34] on among us believers.
[1:22:38] But someday we will stop that when the
[1:22:40] communist gets in and sweeps in here.
[1:22:44] And we'll be glad to meet our brothers
[1:22:46] and sisters, regardless whether they're
[1:22:48] a regardless. Wait a minute. Whoa, wait
[1:22:51] a minute. They can't be brothers.
[1:22:53] If they're different, they can't be
[1:22:55] brothers.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; And you'll be glad to meet your brother.
[1:22:58] No, no, no. You can't be brothers if
[1:23:00] they're outside the
[1:23:02] message. That's not possible.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. And you'll be glad to
[1:23:06] meet your
[1:23:09] whether they're Methodist, Baptist, or
[1:23:11] whatever he is. See, you'll be glad to
[1:23:13] meet him. That's right. It's a shame God
[1:23:16] has to do that in that way. But I guess
[1:23:19] if we won't show it's his way and then
[1:23:23] he has to force us to do it.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; See we can come the easy way and just
[1:23:31] accept the truth or God will force us.
[1:23:38] Last quote
[1:23:40] as the people here today are trying to
[1:23:43] say.
[1:23:48] You know, we have people that struggled
[1:23:51] if you didn't have communion when it was
[1:23:53] dark outside. But you know, when it's
[1:23:55] dark outside here, it's light in the
[1:23:57] Philippines.
[1:23:59] And when when it's Sunday here, it's
[1:24:01] already Monday in the Philippines.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; You see, like in the world, it's
[1:24:07] different time zones.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; But how's God deal with that? Is God on
[1:24:12] one time zone around the world, or is he
[1:24:15] on separate time zones?
[1:24:17] Let's see what Brother Bram said. as
[1:24:20] people today trying to say we should
[1:24:23] wash feet once a year or on Thursday or
[1:24:26] Friday or take communion or all these
[1:24:28] different doctrines.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; There's some things God don't care.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Does it matter to God if it's dark when
[1:24:38] you take communion or sunlight when it
[1:24:39] takes communion?
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:24:42] all these different doctrines of and
[1:24:44] they argue about whether it should be
[1:24:46] this day or that day or whether it
[1:24:48] should be on the Sabbath day or the
[1:24:50] first day of the week and all these
[1:24:52] things.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; I hope you get that. I really hope I
[1:24:57] wish. How come it's not underlined
[1:24:58] Vicki? Oh, next paragraph.
[1:25:01] Where did my Vicki go? Oh, sorry. I'm
[1:25:04] sorry. Sorry.
[1:25:08] Are merely tradition and Oh, sorry. It's
[1:25:11] there. Sorry, Becky. Right in the bottom
[1:25:13] half. And all these things are merely
[1:25:14] tradition.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; And there's lots of message people that
[1:25:19] will drop the gloves and fight and leave
[1:25:22] the church.
[1:25:26] And the prophet said
[1:25:31] merely tradition.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Sorry, Vicki.
[1:25:38] What good would any of it do you whether
[1:25:41] you had lint or not lint if there was no
[1:25:46] life in you?
[1:25:48] It's only a memorial
[1:25:51] which there's nothing against it but
[1:25:54] they have to certainly carry out their
[1:25:56] traditions
[1:25:58] but left off
[1:26:00] the main thing.
[1:26:05] Next paragraph. Thanks Vicki. Amazing.
[1:26:08] Satan doesn't care
[1:26:12] how religious you are
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; about your traditions
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; or how right you are. Oh,
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close my iPad on that one.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; God's trying to talk to his real bride.
[1:26:38] And we're splitting hairs over nothing.
[1:26:41] And God ain't liking it.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; We're arrogant.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; And puffed up. And God's throwing up.
[1:26:48] He's literally got the flu puking
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; at the way his bride is operating.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Literally. Satan don't care if you're
[1:26:57] religious or how right you are in your
[1:27:00] message doctrine.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; I added the message, but he said
[1:27:05] doctrine.
[1:27:07] If you miss the life,
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; you won't come up,
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; church. That's important stuff.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; I just tell you something, church.
[1:27:23] That's important stuff. Brother Bram
[1:27:26] said about a half a dozen times, he
[1:27:27] said, "I'd rather have the wrong
[1:27:28] doctrine and the right spirit." Now, I
[1:27:30] actually believe with all of my heart,
[1:27:32] with every speck of my body, that you
[1:27:35] can have both.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; But I also believe that most have the
[1:27:40] wrong spirit.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Most
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; and you can tell how they preach because
[1:27:46] they put people out and put people in.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; And that's the wrong spirit. He called
[1:27:53] them
[1:27:54] in the scripture.
[1:27:59] If you don't, if you miss that life, you
[1:28:02] won't come up anyhow. No matter how
[1:28:04] religious, how good, and how many
[1:28:06] churches you belong to or will belong
[1:28:09] to, it doesn't matter one thing unless
[1:28:12] you've been
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; born again.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, I I just seen this. This is a
[1:28:25] disclaimer. This is a 65 quote.
[1:28:31] You You couldn't read this quote and
[1:28:33] say, "Brother Brand was going to get
[1:28:34] more progressive revelation
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; than this one right here."
[1:28:43] Satan don't care that you believe the
[1:28:45] message.
[1:28:46] If he can just keep you fighting over
[1:28:49] when we have communion,
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; he's got you.
[1:28:55] Bless God. Communion is supper time.
[1:28:59] If you have a different than that, I'm
[1:29:01] not taking it.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Maybe you missed the life.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know when you take communion,
[1:29:11] it's not the body of Christ. It's just a
[1:29:14] type
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; of remembrance.
[1:29:19] You know,
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; we're coming right up to the capstone,
[1:29:24] perfect love, and all this other chaft
[1:29:26] is got to blow away.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Me, too.
[1:29:31] And I'm seeing stuff that I showed you
[1:29:33] this morning.
[1:29:35] And I'm like,
[1:29:38] wow.
[1:29:42] God gave us
[1:29:44] through our prophet the greatest
[1:29:47] revelation. Well, the revelation came
[1:29:49] from God, but gave us the greatest
[1:29:51] insight of taking the seals off the
[1:29:54] mysteries and showing us the Bible in
[1:29:58] plain view.
[1:30:00] And he didn't do that for us to get
[1:30:03] arrogant. Let's stand.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:30:21] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:30:24] Learning to lean
[1:30:28] the joy I can't explain.
[1:30:33] F
[1:30:34] my soul
[1:30:37] since the day.
[1:30:42] Holy
[1:30:47] Spirit
[1:30:49] is leading
[1:30:51] my way
[1:30:55] and I'm worthy
[1:30:58] to leave.
[1:31:02] Burning
[1:31:04] to
[1:31:06] burn
[1:31:08] to
[1:31:15] Jesus.
[1:31:19] I need more power
[1:31:23] than I ever
[1:31:26] dream.
[1:31:27] I'm learning to live
[1:31:32] on Jesus.
[1:31:46] Heat. Heat.
[1:31:56] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:32:06] Heat.
[1:32:09] Heat.
[1:32:19] Yeah.
[1:32:23] Heat.
[1:32:36] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:32:46] Heat. Heat.
[1:32:56] Heat. Heat.
[1:33:06] Yeah.
[1:33:08] Heat.
[1:33:18] Heat. Heat.
[1:33:31] Jesus.
[1:33:34] I
[1:33:39] am
[1:33:52] Heat. Heat.
[1:34:02] Heat.
[1:34:06] Heat.
[1:34:17] Yeah.
[1:34:23] Heat.
[1:34:33] Heat. Heat.
[1:34:45] Heat. Heat.
[1:34:55] Oh,
[1:35:06] heat.
