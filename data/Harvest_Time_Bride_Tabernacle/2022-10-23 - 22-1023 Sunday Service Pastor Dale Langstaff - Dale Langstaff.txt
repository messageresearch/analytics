Lord Jesus and assume going home we give you the glory and we give you the honor for it and your beautiful name we pray amen amen I just have a few announcements if you want to take your seats for a minute thank you brother Matt very much for a beautiful song service the man just a very wonderful songs and and that's just awesome to be here just apologize again for my voice last Sunday was huh parts of it was terrible for my voice and I'm doing I feel perfectly fine but my voice is deceiving amen just for the girls maybe don't shut the mic off because last Sunday when we shut the mic off the video squealed for the people listening online it kind of messed up the video and so uh I'll either try and shut mine off or do whatever we do amen just good to be here just to announce our special meetings uh the second weekend of November we put a poster up there and just thank Abigail for doing the nice poster and and there's extra there if you want to take some home with you or put them up somewhere at your place to work or anything like that we have in there the second speaker is to be announced because we we're planning on uh junior brother Henry preaching but he couldn't come on his work visa and so he has reapplied him and his wife both for a just a regular Visa now his pastor also had applied and was supposed to be here in August for a Visa so it's kind of a race of whose Visa comes through first it could be could be Henry preaching it could be Henry's pastor preaching and if those two don't work out we're going to have somebody locally preaching for Friday night and then brother Ben will be here I believe Samantha is coming with them so brother Ben and Samantha will both be here Saturday and Sunday amen also I asked you just to pray with me and even Luanne were just uh myself for sure considering our trip to Uganda for February of course they're very anxious for me to give them dates and I've kind of been dragging my feet because I've been waiting for the world to come back to normal and uh we don't know if that'll ever happen completely but uh it's it's a I just uh looking for clearance from God and I just just have a it's it's perfectly like we're able to go non-vaccinated you just have to have a test before you go to the airport you have to have a test when you leave the airport but those things kind of weigh on your mind because when I get ready to come home if I get a test and it's positive I miss my Airlines and so those things are kind of they're kind of like unknown headaches amen and maybe I just need more faith or maybe I need a and also there's many brother Jim is planning on going and and uh because of the uh uh um and how to say it because of the excitement around the trip brother Jose Pastor Jose from Kitchener and Pastor John dankwell have both said they would go with me um to Uganda so I'm not sure I would like to take my wife with me so we would need a real miracle for God to lay that on her heart and then we would know God was here if she agreed to go amen but that would be just the real blessing so just I don't know what I'm saying there but I haven't just I haven't bought my ticket yet and uh of course when you go there they want you to say a long time there's just a but I when I'm gone I think of the church here and and you see her and so the longer I'm gone I feel like I've left you and I really haven't but I haven't and so just just praying for God's leadership and and all these things maybe we'll stand and just read the word and just pray this that this will be a blessing to us this morning Amanda just remember my throat if it goes wrong we'll just press over here Hebrews 11 we're going to start at six Hebrews 11 we're going to start at 6 and then we're going to drop to 13 and read a few scriptures there and I want to preach this morning on your or our confession your or our confession and I want to show you this morning and maybe that's why God hasn't been able to do as much as what we thought he would is because without your confession or our confession a proper confession God can do nothing at all the Bible said that Jesus could do very few Miracles because of their unbelief but I'm going to show you in the word of God where it was your confession of who he is is when he can operate like he is supposed to amen but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he's the rewarder of those that diligently and that word diligently seek Him is confess him that means those that confess that he is let's go to 13. verse 13. for all those all died in the faith not having received the promise but having seen afar off and we're persuaded of them and embrace them and there you go and confessed they were saved by their confession they never even had the Holy Ghost said but it was their confession and their confession that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declared plainly that they seek the country and truly if they had been mindful of the country from hence they came they might have had opportunity to return and now not first there when you look that up in the message the prophet talked about Enoch and Enoch was raptured because he was seeking a country amen we know Abraham said he was seeking a country whose Builder and maker was God in 16 but now they desired a better country that is a heavenly where of God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared a city for them Lord Jesus we decide you to bless your word as it goes forth and bless us this morning in your name we pray amen Let's uh you can have your seats we're going to turn to Romans 8 34. amen and just uh just looking forward to what God has for us amen and just Romans 8 34. who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is raised again and who even is at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us and there in this verse and the message and the message Hub the prophet mentioned this verse hundreds of times and I read hundreds of quotes in this verse and they always came back to he made intercession it wasn't openly they made intercession for those that confessed him it was because of your confession that he made intercession now let's turn one more scripture to lay our foundation we'll build it up here Hebrews 3 1. Hebrews 3 1 is he is therefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the apostles and the high priests of your profession of Jesus Christ and that word profession and we're going to read it in quotes that we're going to post up later is confessions if you come if you switch that to the dictionary the prophet said the prophet translation for that word profession of Jesus Christ this confession of Jesus Christ and this morning I want to tell you that there's only one word One Reason why we don't make a confession one main reason and we'll find that main reason over in Mark eight 38. God help us God help me I could give you life examples you know just I can remember even in business and and not that we're in church but total complete strangers and they would talk about you know when my business that I was young and different things and I would tell them I said it's because of God it's God's blessing on the business I didn't for years and years there was no advertisements never ever lost money just never signed a contract but never lost money for years and years maybe one time lost a small amount but it was God it was confession but God wants you to confess it in your highways and byways and in your life and in your kingdom and where you work and in your household it's your confession but why don't we do it and this verse explains it here and it's also in Luke 9 26 and we're I just like the wording here he said whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me that's why you don't confess and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation now that is definitely today of him also the son of man be ashamed oh when he cometh in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels you know too many times and God help us God I'm not I'm not even preaching to you here but just in general too many times and and I know I like I said this ain't there's nobody here I'm preaching to myself but too many times we almost run a dual lifestyle you know you go to work and you're just in your work mode and that's fine and then you come to church and you're a Holy Roller yeah and and I'm I'm not saying you should but we should be the same no matter where we went amen uh our confession should be the same you know we went to Kitchener this week with my brother and we were in Elmira and we went to uh shop there grocery store and Luanne actually it must have been Monday because she wasn't with us and and it was a beautiful atmosphere there's people that don't have the Revelation that you don't have they don't have the Mysteries revealed on the word of God the Bible has not become a new book it's completely an old letter of laws and do's and don'ts and I'm telling you it's your pastor I felt as much of the Holy Ghost there as I do in many message churches and a lot of it are all of it is their confession no they don't have what you have and they may not be a part of the bride of Christ but their confession is Jesus Christ it's the Jesus Christ of all they know it might be of the Jesus Christ of all the Old Testament but it's still Jesus Christ uh-huh and they're on Main Street and they're not afraid to clearly confess their confession we the same as the story in in uh I mentioned this before we went to uh where we were yesterday uh Kent Bridge and me and Jared stopped there to get a sub and beautiful Christian people and we walked out she said God bless you bless your day see it's just a way of life see if if God's on your mind you know the Bible talks about when you raise up when you go to sleep with your kids you know talk about them when you wake up talk about them when you walk all along the way talk about them when you're ready to lay down and see if Jesus Christ is on your mind he'll just roll right off your tongue you're just huh and the Bible says that he's in Heaven Beside the father make an intercession a prophet said for the ones that are confessing to testimony and I want to show you a perfect example of this in the Bible and we would think that she's a fantastic great person which she is but it was the most unpeculiar person that you would ever believe matter of fact our Prophet said that this person came from the linings of incest from lot and his two daughters wow but because of the power of confession God completely changed her life for eternity amen confession Ruth you look at her in-laws family they when you know Jews when they left the Homeland the country they were God always deals with them in their Homeland and God deals with them as a nation it's not like that for us Gentiles you work out your own salvation with fear and trembling but they left their land and so many times us Gentiles do this for money they left their land for a Better Living because the family came in the Jewish land and they were more concerned about growing corn than they were about growing God the Bible says that there was no thorn in their land and you watch how God dealt with that and God help us brothers because God killed the heads of every one of those families I'll tell you this morning God's in control whether you think he is or not God will take people out of the way God's kingdom will not be hindered our Prophet said Satan will not hinder God's Kingdom and you can think there's somebody trying to block God's kingdom they're either working for God or God will remove them period oh that's a great hope bless praise God and even for you sisters of God forbid that you would marry a loser non-believer amen but if your confession is right in this case God took their unbelieving husbands right out of the way but those two sons because they were in the country of Moab the prophet and we're going to put up quotes here after maybe you can put the first one up Vicky and just leave it up he said that that country was made those people were from the incest of lot and his two daughters amen and so those Sons married girls from that country and you know the story how you know uh Naomi's husband died and and her two sons died and so she was coming back to the country it was barley season and she was going to come back to Jerusalem and she came to her daughters and she said now listen you now we got a quote up here so I'll just read it but in Ruth one and eight Naomi went to her daughter-in-law since she said return each of you to your mother's house and may the Lord deal kindly with you as you have dealt kindly with the Dead and with me now I want to bring you to your attention sometimes us as Christian Believers we have a hard time and we should God help us and God forgive us making our confession the Bible says to make your calling an election sure don't be ashamed of telling you people telling the world whose side you're on if they can't see it then let them know verbally amen here most of the time when we make our con we don't make our confession for Christ it's all because we're ashamed but I want to show you here with Ruth she was she was almost forced or pressured pressured at the very least pressured by the closest person on Earth to her two backslide two returns the closest person on her because she was living in the household of her in-laws and with their son and they're just going through fairness and three times her son mother-in-law comes to her says don't come with me uh-huh three times you know we need to make a stand for Christ and we need to make a clear-cut stand and Christ if you do that will make a stand for you you God ain't safe you know we're living in the the I know we're in the bright age us but the spirit that we're in is a lukewarm age the Bible says that he will that's disgusting to him he'll spew you out of his mouth and what that means is where wishy-washy and there ain't no Believers with the backbone they're politicians whoever they're talking to that's how they talk amen now I don't mean that we as believers need to work out the salvation of somebody else if somebody else disagrees with you on the word of God or on the you know on your personal belief we can still have Fellowship you still go to the grocery store that people that are heathens and you know you can sew a fellowship but for you yourself your confession you don't need to be ashamed of it I'm a Believer and I'm proud of it I don't mean in a wrong way amen but because we're in a generation where we're wishy-washy and we go to work and we look like the world we come to church and we the prophet talked about people like that they sang in the bar on Saturday night and then came and sang in the choir on Sunday morning God don't have a confession for you amen God help us to make our confession stronger than that amen he said let's let's look at the quote here he said he's a high priest he's making he's a high priest and he's sitting there making intercession upon your confession he's not just openly making intercession it's because you're confessing that he's my Lord he's my savior he's my everything and we have to confess it before he can be our high priest so if you wonder why God's not doing what you think in your life maybe you better get a mirror and look and see how much you're confessing amen because he can only intercede look at there the top red line he can only intercede to your confession only to your confession now if you want to be healed this morning or you want your children saved or you want Deliverance or you how much are you confessing God's already done it for you amen Hallelujah see he only intercedes Upon Our confession that's in the blue up there what we confess that he is and he's already has done it for us not that he will do it but that he's already done it we have to confess it that he's done it see we literally put handcuffs on God because it's not because you're being played it's because you're ashamed or you don't believe I can tell you every one of you no matter how polite your plate or shy or backward you are if you really believe in something you'll tell people about it uh-huh but if you're kind of not sure yet or you're ashamed see when you believe in something you don't you're not ashamed number one but you don't care if you're like that amen and that's what God's looking at the world is life that Christ and everything to do with Christians and believers but God's coming back for somebody that's not a shame to call him Lord Hallelujah and here we go back to our scriptures in verse 9 he said the Lord grant that you may rest each in the house of your husbands and she kissed them and they lifted up their voices and they wept and they and they said unto her surely we will return uh with the unto thy people but Naomi's said turn again my daughters see Naomi is pressured him you're not welcome to come with me I know you're not going to be happy with me and she tells them why she says I don't have no more husbands in my room for you and even if I did would you wait for them don't come with me amen pressured by a world of laod sin a world that wants our sisters to look you know if you can't tell which side you're on you need to recalculate your confession if your hairstyle is so much that you could be a Satan worshiper or Jesus worshiper you need to re-change your hairstyle I'm serious I could spell it out planer come on if everything we do you could be in the bar or a concert or you could be in church there's something wrong because the Bible says you're peculiar and that ain't just on what you wear and what you look even your character and the way you carry yourself you won't flaunt yourself no matter how modest you are you're dignified and amen those people that do that have low self-esteem they don't even know who they are amen they're 11 year old or 12 year old and they're trying to find themselves but we found ourselves in Christ amen we don't need to oh come on you know those places I said where we went Beautiful People Mennonite people they haven't got what you got not what the Revelation in the word but I tell you what what they got they sure confess it amen if I was a young single brother and I say this with all due respects I'll tell you what there's hundreds of Mennonite girls that would be more message daughters than daughters in message churches playing with Hollywood and flirting with the world and dressing borderline Believers and I don't want to see your body I don't want to see your that's garbage that's that that's like kindergarten you don't know who you are yet get over it amen and here here Naomi's telling the daughters don't come with me she's she's right on the edge of saying you're not welcome Matt just my daughters will you not go with me he said there's yet no more sons in my wombs and if they would be your husbands would you wait I want to tell you here if you jump down to verse 14 after they uh had Naomi had discouraged them to come and even said don't come this is unbelievable but Naomi is supposed to be a believer and she's telling them there's nothing with me to come after she needed conversion but God's putting this here to show you her confession Ruth's confession straight Heathen straight pagan not a believer straight from the world even a dirty world okay not even close and I want to show you her sister Opie when they lifted up their voices and wept again and Opie kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth played to her mother-in-law do you want me to tell you something this is well be for those people that are have no confession is Opie stayed with Satan and the world and her name is never mentioned again God forgive me for saying this but there's people that are cannon fodder and the kingdom of God that they're they're not in they're not a part of the gene of God man that never can be but here's somebody that that that you would say is not a part of the gene of God that's where it's so beautiful to see that even in their even in their Earthly lineage and they're dirty pass God's blood paid the price for All sin hey man Hallelujah you you didn't ask to come to this world if you came to this world and and I don't believe anybody did here but if you came to this world from rape incest any evil sin I want to show you a new doctrine you know in the Old Testament you couldn't come into the Tabernacle for I believe it was 40 Generations it was it was like indefinite I think it was 40 Generations but that is under the law we are not under the law to say that a person couldn't be saved under well number one you you'd have to take Ruth out number one and number two it's to say well Jesus Christ's blood paid the price for all the sin except the people born in adultery or he paid the price for all the sin except and I'm not justifying it my goodness but Jesus Christ's blood was perfect enough and powerful enough to save everybody except those born in incest no his blood covered all sin it wasn't those kids faults amen they could be a part of the Bride the same as that amen let's go to what the word of God says we're not saved on our merits we're saved on Amazing Grace oh Hallelujah so Opie left her mother kissed her mother-in-law and said I am happy living in laodicea I agree that there's nothing that you can give me and I'll go back to my family and I'll keep dressing the way I dress and I'll keep there was nothing there for Opie to come forward but we see in verse 14 at the end of that the Ruth clave to her and she said behold thy so here's Naomi she says Behold thy sister-in-law is gone unto her people and on to her Gods small G return now after thy sister-in-law now there's the second time at least that Naomi's pressured strongly pressured Ruth don't come with me and here's a powerful confession Ruth made we as Believers need to broaden our shoulders now I don't mean in an arrogant way not at all God God's coming for humble believers but this is what Ruth said she said Retreat me not don't even talk to me about this my decision is final she said in verse 16 Ruth said retrieve me not to leave thee nor return to follow after thee for whether thou goest I'm going we don't need to talk about this no more and where thou lodges I'm lodging and where thy people shall be I shall be I was a clear-cut decision and thy God here's a illegitimate sinner but she saved on her confession and she said undy God will be my God and don't talk to me no more about it amen you know too many of us Believers especially if you haven't got the Holy Ghost you you can have two husbands you cannot be flirting with the world you can't be married engaged to one in court in another it won't it won't fly and the only person will be unhappy is you amen Ruth continued to go on not she didn't stop at where thou goest and where thou lodges and where thy people are you know I believe with all my heart that Naomi thought watch this and to some degree they did Naomi thought that they would reject Ruth because of she wasn't Jew and it says when they come back to the country they all circled around and wanted to know all about them and and you know we know that BOA is redeemed Ruth but you know the kinsman redeemer he refused to redeem her uh-huh oh it's beautiful amen but Ruth continues in verse 17 she says where thou dias I'm gonna die and there will I will be buried and the Lord do so unto me and even more if at Death part thee in me here's Ruth saying she said God if I change my confession if I change my confession and my confession changes before I die God you're free to take whoa you know all those people that left the trace they never had this confession because they were in message churches for some 10 some 20 some 30 some 40 years and they just walked right out because of confession was not sound amen God help us and when Naomi's seen that Ruth was steadfastly minded to go with her this is 18. when she finally realizes that nothing she could say would make her backslife you know the world would be the same way even the people that will not be converted when they realize that you're confession you don't think so I went to high school with with Holiness girls that they had long hair and they put their hair up in a bun and the whole high school called them the bun heads there were a beautiful full dress and had the bun head they were known by the Bunheads that wasn't a slam at all it's because they're confession was solid you can teach me all you want I'm wearing a dress and I have abundant hair and I don't have a problem with you call me a bunhead because it ain't going to change my confession amen that's where you need to be with Christ Christ ain't marrying some wishy-washy amen this this marriage is For Better or Worse but with Christ it's always better but it's in there to see what your decision will be what's your confession if you have a hard time are you going to flee The Coop and go where the corn is better are you going to be like lot and you're going to pick where you're just concerned you're only concerned about your bank account I'm going to pick the best planes you know you know the one Minister mentioned this in the convention but said you know a lot never ever planned on going this Auto was never ever Lots planned and every make-believer that walks out of this truth the message they never planned on doing that never not not for one minute you watch how slow lot's progress was to sin what he just picked the grassier plane now that's not sin and he just lived in a tent that you could see Sodom well he wasn't in it but then he realized that he could get a nicer house inside and the tent floor was damped well well that's not sin but then he realized when he had a nice house he was popular so he could become the mayor oh and now you're huh and then but becomes when you're the mayor and then God said hey you got to leave this place because I'm going to destroy but he said but God I can't leave the place because I'm the mayor uh-huh it's a lot never ever planned on getting to that situation it was a very slow and that's what's happened in a lot of the young people in our church and our confession that's why you'll see things that you do your grandparents would never have done it's because you didn't plan on going to Sodom but you just picked the green grass and then it went from the tent to the house and then I went from the house to the politics and then when God came to save you it's like man I don't think yeah does it work the Bible says that the angels physically restrained his arm to remove now now I would say lot didn't have a very strong confession um and his wife's still in a pillar assault amen God help us amen here Naomi said he said when I seeing that ruse was steadfastly minded and she was going with her then she said then and only then die Naomi let off and left her speaking God help us God help us to have a confession that God's proud of let's go to our second picture Amy here's here's our or one scripture we read here we have to confess he was wounded for our transgressions by his stripes we're yield he said Jesus of Hebrews 3 1 is he's the high priest of our confession so if you don't have a confession then he's not even your high priest amen and now any of you Scholars will know that the Bible says profession and here's the prophet breaking this down so you can understand he said any of you Scholars know the profession is translated the same as confession so God is the high priest of our confession you have not because you asked not amen all you have to do if you're sick amen let's just say hey God I know you've already healed me take care of it like the brother said it was so beautiful like it was actually brother Andre said when he was over there doing the print press and the people came and got him a bill and brother Andre he wasn't it was it was just beautiful blessed my heart he said he just prayed and said God you have a problem you have a bill to pay it wasn't brother Andre's problem brother Andre didn't need to print stuff amen if God didn't want to print it then he wouldn't pay the bill amen see if you get in that that vein so much God will take care of everything amen you're not you're not living for yourself you're living for Christ the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord all your confessions amen you notice just the Highlight at the bottom you dropped there he said now notice he's the high priest of your confession and he says you get it you get what I mean he said what you confess you are that's what you are any man will never live any farther or any higher than he believes God help us let's go to the second uh one here he said if you go in there paragraph 35 he said when the inspiration of the holy spirit will inspire you he said remember God will make your body come to your confession God I'm Healed God I'm saved God my kids are saved bury it you said my kids are my heritage if you have faith for yourself and your household confess that it'll be taken care of amen he said if you say that you're a drunker and you want to drink he said don't worry he said you soon will be drinking if you confess that you want a new vehicle and you go looking at new vehicles don't worry you'll soon only right but that's the same spiritually if you confess it say I'm going to be in church on Sunday period don't worry you'll be there believe you say all in your confession God help us you drop to the bottom highlight there he said confess it and God will make your body obey your confession that's powerful it's powerful say God my bills are taken care of now he'll know if you're in his will there's a few other things you have to do amen it's so simple but we don't confess it because we're not sure he's God well like this I think you know how big is your god God help us for he's a high priest of your confession sitting at the right hand of the father now in his own blood make an intercession for any confession upon anything that he died for oh Hallelujah let's go to the last quote here is this is is that beautiful God Amen I'm just just like spiritually I'm married Christ is my husband he's taking care of all my needs you know in the family of God you don't have to have a double income he just takes care of everything serious I'm not I'm saying I'm not saying double income is wrong I'm just saying just picture it spiritually you don't have to worry ain't for believers amen I'm preaching to myself that'll be the case with going to Uganda you know the prophet said he said anytime you go to do a work for God or go to the mission field I don't really consider you've gone to the mission field it could be Ontario be the mission field he said you're always in the will of God I had a non-believer tell me he said just watch how you can fetch this he says what if you get to Uganda the world goes to war and you can't come home look would that be a problem it'd be a problem for youth here but you see you see how doubt comes in amen if you're in the will of God does it matter if you're in Uganda when the bomb's hit or in Ontario when the Bob said you'd probably be safer there but he said oh oh well maybe I better do something myself well the Bible didn't say you had to do nothing of yourself except confess them amen remember here look at right at the top here he said remember he can never do nothing for you now that's pretty straightforward until first you say he's already done it you say some people would come in they say well I unfriend those people I've seen it something connected in the message they said well all the message churches are dead and there's no power of the Holy Spirit now I just blocked them number one it's on true number two it's negative amen start confession believe in him and accept it and testify of it amen he's a high priest of our what our confession Hebrews 3 1. he's sitting at the right hand of the father make an intercession for our confession Jesus said whatsoever things ye desire you just oh my could you think of anything that you would desire I can think of a few even spiritually When you pray believe you receive them and it shall be given to you is that right oh wow but believing that those things that you say shall come to pass and you'll have it oh that's beautiful that's where Ruth you know back to Ruth we'll see and we're going to close here in a moment Ruth had three parks to her serving God and I like the first one most of all was your decision we're living in a world with no commitment no no no I might work here maybe I won't work here I don't think I will and or you know maybe I'll get married well maybe I don't think I will that's why people just shack up the only difference between sacked up and married besides sin is commitment it's commitment there's no different other than it's sin but it's a commitment there's a world is spineless you know well maybe I'll be a Christian today but well I don't think we're going to get bombed so I don't think I'll serve God because I got more time so you're no commitment no commitment amen first part of Roost this uh stage here the prophet said in Revelations the message Revelations he said she had three stages what's Ruth was deciding serving and resting and we're to the stage right now where we should be resting on what God's doing for us amen once you decide once you're married to Christ and you've done served and you're in the the you're the queen of the house it it's what's left is up to Christ amen we're done with the quotes Amy amen we're in a wrestling party you don't have to be you don't have to be stirred up here the prophet said just just some information here he said you know Naomi type the Orthodox Church and Opie take the lukewarm Gentile Church but Ruth taped the bright Church amen and all those other churches are going to try to get you to make a decision Naomi and Opie both tried to get Ruth to make a different decision you mean you're not going to come with me your sister-in-law I thought we were friends our husbands were brothers amen we've all heard families say stuff like that you mean you're going to miss turkey dinner don't you know that you could miss church just this one time for amen God help us remember she was excommunicated never mentioned again because of her decision amen help us Jesus you know the prophet says here he says I like Ruth's decision of how she said and she said you know every one of you are going to be affected by the decision you make this morning when you hear this message you will not leave the same you will leave better or worse you will leave a changed person one way or the other you will be closer to God or you will be farther from God even though you think you make a decision that is not committed amen your decision of non-commitment is to move away from God he said well I'm right in the fence there's no such thing as riding the fence if you're right in the fence you're already on the other side amen nobody rides a fence and falls on the side of Christ man if you're riding the fence it was in the message what has the Holy Ghost given for that the prophet said that the moabites came from the daughters and lot unbelievers in incest but God could still bring out bride God help us let's read that last scripture that we had uh oh maybe it is up there Mark 38 or yep that's it 8 38. I love this scripture this is so much your confession if you're going to make a confession out in the world you will be pushed you will it will be just like Ruth you'll be pushed until they realize they can't push you off and you'll be left alone you know I remember when my this is years back when I was 10 or 12 just a young teenager and my brother's older brothers and you know of course we know that that the Sabbath is our Holy Ghost I know we know that our Prophet told us that it's not a day we know that our Prophet did tell us though to respect the day of Resurrection amen it's not law but he said he said to miss church to go fishing or go driving in the country was a sin now if you come to church and then you go fishing after it's not a sin he said show respects to the resurrection thing but you know I'm talking about how far people will push and you see how far Naomi pushed I remember in the when uh Trudeau's dad was in the country and inflation come in just like it did then there's nothing new Under the heavens what's happening right now to the world it happened before when I was 10. it was just Trudeau's dad interest went to 24 22 percent inflation was at 10 or 12 percent and people never had enough money to go around and my brother's got a job working shift work in Wallaceburg in the factory and you think this is a little thing but it showed how God will stand behind your confession and so you're not you're not in the union or you're not locked in until you have your three months of probation and for them to go to work on the midnight shift they had to go in at 11 30 on Sunday night but they didn't believe on working on Sunday is that was their confession I understand that confession was under the law and we're not under the law but that's what they knew see if you know to do right it's iniquity there's no forgiveness for that so message Believers you know the truth you know what the Revelation is you know what the Mysteries are revealed and to to not do that there's no forgiveness for it because you know to do right and you're intentionally premeditated first degree murder to Christ and they told their boss no what I I told you that story because they desperately needed the job they're paying like 22 percent interest on their farms and I mean they were people left and right lost their farms in that time houses whatever I mean you weren't born yet or you were awful Young sister Patty will remember I I just Patricia I certainly remember I remember stories that happened to my dad wow and they went to their boss they told them we don't believe unworking on the Sabbath we desperately want the job we'll be into work at 12 o'clock and he would ask them after that if they would work the midnight shift and my brothers would always say no and he said don't worry about it he said I know why you're saying no you're saying no because you don't want to come in a half an hour late he said I got you covered don't worry about it you see it was your confession the world's dying for a people that'll have a belief and stick to it regardless no greater love than any man then he'll lay down his life for his confession his brother his confession the world's got lots of cheap imitation wishy-washy you can get them anywhere they're called harlots or prostitutes if you want somebody with character says I won't go that far because I have a confession in Jesus Christ the world will never push you off they'll go wow now there's a real daughter or a man even if they're wrong even though we know that we're not under the law of the Sabbath day to them it was wrong and their confession was I won't go that far even if I lose my job but you'll mean I lose my house or am I fine and God see God will change the heart of a king and he'll stand because he's he's already making intercession for what he knows your confession will be bless them whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and shall be ashamed of my words you know John 1 was he is the word and this adulterous and sinful generation you know the that that's today of him also the son of man shall be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels God help God help brother Dale God help me to not be in those States amen amen God help us to be confession now I just want to close with this I don't mean your confession in an arrogant you know disturbing way you know what I mean you can still be respectful your confession ain't going to change the world but for me and my house we'll serve the Lord yeah what if if you you can do that okay no problem but for this house and this and this house and in this house we're serving God we're going down serving God amen thank you Lord oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah it'll be worth it all let's sing that song it will be worth it all when we see Christ I'm gonna need the words for the verse hallelujah thank you Lord of times the day seems long hard trials [Music] we're tempted to complain ing murmurray and despair by Christ will soon to catch his breath away all these forever over in God foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign that scripture means that our confession can't change from what your Bible says because of our confession changes and you never changed our confession is none and void like our Prophet said Lord Jesus and many times if you had a confession and denominational Creeds or or false things science that confession was worthless but because you're the same yesterday today and forever our confession will be the same as when you were here on Earth our confession will be the same when our Prophet was here there will be no wavering and no lessening of our confession because of the age when Satan has come in so strongly because of the age the only age from Christ where you were on the outside of your church and you were asking to come back in but nobody was answering the door oh God for that reason alone I'm happy I'm in the bright age I praise your beautiful name and give you the glory for all of eternity that it wasn't me a part of the laodicean age that put you out of the church God help your bride to have a confession of Who You Are and we'll praise you for all of eternity Lord Jesus thank you for our beautiful Gathering be with Jared and Julie as they're traveling seeing their Grandma probably for the last time on this Earth bless them Lord Jesus be with your grandma and of course the ones that are Out Sister Kim and brother Jim and sister Linda may you be with them and bless them Lord Jesus your beautiful name we pray amen God bless you
