[36:22] going to go into it and maybe before I
[36:24] do I want to tell a little story just to

[36:32] wish Jared was here to see it here so
[36:34] you're gonna have to tell them Julie or
[36:35] or tell him to listen to the first uh
[36:37] two minutes or something but uh uh
[36:42] you know the brother that preached the
[36:43] funeral the brother that died was 91.
[36:47] he taught public school for 50 years
[36:50] at Jay County 50 years full-time teacher
[36:53] when he retired he continued to teach as
[36:57] a full-time substitute
[36:59] after 50 years
[37:03] and then he finished by teaching the
[37:04] special needs
[37:06] amen and he'd give his heart he'd serve
[37:08] the Lord for I think 71 years he got
[37:10] saved right about the time he got
[37:12] married and just you know when you live
[37:14] a long life and so the man preached in
[37:16] the funeral
[37:18] was an old man
[37:21] he didn't have a lot of hair on his head
[37:24] but he was a young boy
[37:28] when this man was married
[37:31] so here he told the story he said we
[37:33] come over to Evelyn's what was this
[37:36] thing Eugene and Evelyn's house and he
[37:38] said now Gene and Evelyn are married
[37:42] and this boy that's preaching the
[37:43] funeral he's in his 70s but he was just
[37:45] a wee little work
[37:49] he said they come over and he said Gina
[37:52] Dublin's boys and they went out and they
[37:54] were playing and all the ladies were in
[37:55] the house
[37:56] uh
[37:58] I said I wasn't going to preach on kids
[38:00] anymore but
[38:01] I am going to get off it
[38:04] and
[38:07] the kids were outside and all the ladies
[38:09] were in the house and they said after a
[38:10] minute the lady saw it you know
[38:12] we maybe should check on those three
[38:14] boys
[38:15] and so they stuck to one of the sisters
[38:17] stuck their head out the door and they
[38:18] said uh you know hollered Adam they
[38:20] heard some noise in rockets and they say
[38:22] hey what are you doing well you know
[38:23] maybe you better come in the house so
[38:25] the kids come in the house and they had
[38:26] a wonderful day
[38:28] and the other people went home
[38:30] this man he's like 75 telling the story
[38:33] but he was like
[38:35] five
[38:37] and so after they got home his mom
[38:39] called back to to uh uh Evelyn and he
[38:43] said Evelyn he said you know do you and
[38:45] Gene have any Windows broken in your
[38:47] chicken coop and Evelyn said she said oh
[38:49] no she said Gene just fixed all those
[38:52] windows because we're getting chickens
[38:53] in a couple days
[38:56] know where I'm going
[38:59] I said oh no no no Gene just fixed those
[39:01] windows we're getting chickens in a
[39:03] couple days and he needed all the
[39:04] windows fixed
[39:05] and this this woman or this man
[39:07] preaching that's in his 70s style it was
[39:09] just a little kid he said
[39:10] you maybe better go take a walk to your
[39:12] chicken coop
[39:15] and she said okay yeah I'll go take a
[39:17] walk to the chicken coop and as The
[39:19] Story Goes that these three boys were
[39:21] outside and they were playing uh Cowboys
[39:25] and Indians and the Indians were coming
[39:27] in off the fields and out of the bushes
[39:29] and the boys didn't want the Indians to
[39:31] get in the chicken coop
[39:32] so they broke 21 Windows sticking their
[39:34] bone arrows and guns out so they could
[39:37] shoot the Indians through the window
[39:42] the windows that Eugene had just made
[39:44] sure he'd put them all in just a day or
[39:46] two ago because they had chickens coming
[39:49] in two days
[39:50] and you know that brother never said
[39:54] they got the rod
[39:58] because see those boys were doing what
[39:59] boys do
[40:02] boys play
[40:03] and boys were doing exactly what they
[40:05] were born to do
[40:06] was play
[40:08] Cowboys and Indians
[40:11] and the man said to himself in the story
[40:12] he said you know I think my dad bought
[40:14] the windows for Eugene
[40:17] and he had to put them in the second
[40:19] time
[40:20] and this is how he finished this thing
[40:23] he said Eugene invested
[40:27] in me
[40:30] God invested in you
[40:34] God left the splendors of Heaven
[40:39] to come to a pig pen called Earth
[40:42] to invest
[40:44] in brother Dale
[40:46] to invest in a bride
[40:48] and as much as you invest in somebody
[40:52] will be what your reward is
[40:54] and this man ministering said I am today
[40:57] what the investment was put in
[40:59] on me
[41:01] as a little boy
[41:05] and it wasn't by a beating
[41:12] wow
[41:15] God help me
[41:17] you know and I said last Sunday you know
[41:19] we tried to visit people and new people
[41:21] and we've been out it was out this week
[41:23] and and different things and the land
[41:25] got to see people and you know Luann's
[41:27] seeing people that
[41:28] oh she went to Youth Camp the Youth Camp
[41:32] that she went to as a wee girl before
[41:34] she was even a youth no it was I was a
[41:37] couple days ago
[41:38] it's still going on you know
[41:42] and I stood back
[41:44] and watch those sisters
[41:46] of the second generation
[41:49] and line up my wife
[41:51] and hug her
[41:53] I said honey
[41:55] we need to meet them for supper someday
[41:59] and just let them know if something
[42:01] comes up
[42:03] what God's revealed about it
[42:09] it won't be in a church service
[42:11] but you know
[42:13] things have a way of coming out
[42:16] in that
[42:17] amen God help us to let our light help
[42:20] us to invest in people help us not to be
[42:23] so busy building our bank account so we
[42:25] never visit people
[42:27] man we just we got to different people
[42:30] even before we left you know and
[42:31] remember the new man that's been coming
[42:33] on Wednesday night last Wednesday was
[42:35] the first time in like five weeks he
[42:37] missed
[42:39] amen and just you know it's it's not
[42:41] it's just God I mean it's not us don't
[42:43] have nothing man we're just remember
[42:45] Lauren and Sheila we had a wonderful
[42:47] time with them went out for dinner
[42:48] breakfast and and they've kind of been
[42:51] dealing with health you know it's too
[42:53] bad you know and he had an ear infection
[42:55] and believe me I know what that felt
[42:57] like and just but just remember them
[42:59] amen it's just it it's called compassion
[43:04] and God had a lot of that
[43:07] bro you want to believe for brother Dale
[43:09] why I was in the pig pen on beautiful oh
[43:14] he said I still call you mine
[43:17] amen I still love you and that God help
[43:19] me God help me amen God really amen this
[43:23] this is uh this is this this is not this
[43:26] ain't about church and this ain't about
[43:27] an individual this is about a character
[43:30] we're only taking that with us
[43:33] character God give me your character
[43:36] to be christ-like that even when people
[43:39] will notice my wife but they'll notice
[43:41] the atmosphere you know the Bible talks
[43:43] about how wives are supposed to love and
[43:46] submit and obey their husbands
[43:49] but God told me something on that
[43:51] scripture and just studying amen
[43:54] they're doing that they're doing a fine
[43:56] job even the ways that aren't
[44:02] because they're just following the lead
[44:04] of the husbands that aren't obeying and
[44:06] following God
[44:08] any husband that's obeying and following
[44:10] God like they're supposed to and like
[44:12] the scripture say your wife will have no
[44:14] problem
[44:15] doing likewise
[44:17] but there's a lot of fat men
[44:22] uh-huh
[44:24] that don't deserve
[44:27] huh
[44:29] see and she's the weaker vessel and you
[44:32] expect her to do something that you
[44:34] don't do either
[44:38] you think whoa I'm God
[44:42] oh God
[44:46] you're a long ways from God
[44:49] amen
[44:50] as you surrender and submit to Jehovah
[44:54] she'll have a perfect example
[44:57] how to surrender to you it won't even be
[44:59] you because it's not you see you died
[45:05] we can preach on forget the wives let's
[45:08] preach on the husbands if we get the
[45:09] husbands right the wives will be perfect
[45:12] see that's why Christ's bride can be
[45:15] perfect because the husband here in this
[45:18] case is perfect
[45:21] amen I had nobody had problem following
[45:23] Christ because he's perfect
[45:27] whoa
[45:28] Wow Let's go to first Peter three and
[45:32] one to six and and you know I I just I'm
[45:35] really scattered I I'm sorry I just I I
[45:38] get stuff and I just I hardly know how
[45:40] to put it or where to put it I just pray
[45:42] God just makes sense of of what he gives
[45:45] us amen but I believe God's gonna give
[45:47] us peace in this world
[45:49] that's that's that's incredible and I
[45:52] encourage you to fellowship with
[45:55] non-believers
[45:56] or weak Believers or remember Stephen
[45:59] Cassie I need to go we got to go see
[46:01] John Blackman amen oh my goodness I
[46:04] think I could be gone almost almost
[46:06] every day of the week
[46:08] my like I you know I miss somebody and I
[46:10] feel like
[46:12] but it's uh and but but see you're
[46:15] investing it's not it's not it's about
[46:18] price you're showing them and see like
[46:21] we we're expect we expect people like
[46:24] you know I don't want to name names but
[46:26] we expect like Steve and Cassie to be
[46:28] like McDonald's drive-through
[46:30] the hamburger is already warm
[46:32] they're already saved filled with the
[46:34] Holy Ghost praise God handed out the
[46:36] window and everything no no no no no
[46:37] this is a journey
[46:40] it took me 55 years just to become
[46:43] semi-normal
[46:45] no because when I was a baby believe me
[46:47] I stayed a baby a long time spiritually
[46:49] I was drinking milk forever
[46:54] you getting what I'm saying
[46:57] but so but why do we expect other people
[47:00] to be
[47:02] just just love them and guide them and
[47:05] show them and and admonish them and and
[47:08] teach them and be right there beside
[47:10] them and when they stumble them
[47:13] fall
[47:14] you know Luanne was doing that this week
[47:17] you know one of her brothers and his
[47:19] wife was saying that they'd been going
[47:20] to a lot of the churches around the
[47:22] meant you know the atmosphere is against
[47:25] God you know I don't know if you know
[47:26] that in North America it's not in Africa
[47:28] but it isn't and she said multiple
[47:31] churches in the area whole towns like no
[47:33] church had pastors
[47:35] look there's no one Glenn was telling me
[47:37] about churches she went to as her mom I
[47:39] know I I that's what I said brother man
[47:41] I said wow the way I said me and my mom
[47:43] went to church he said there was a
[47:44] pastor's wife my mom and me
[47:47] and I went
[47:48] wow
[47:51] what would be if you and your mom didn't
[47:53] show up who was there
[47:56] whoa
[48:00] huh God help us Amen to admonish you
[48:04] know God didn't give us this good
[48:05] present to keep to ourselves
[48:07] I mean it's for us but we're teaching
[48:09] meant not you know what I mean amen God
[48:11] help us
[48:13] God help us we can have peace and and uh
[48:16] surrender and and it's just beautiful I
[48:19] mean this gospel is beautiful but oh
[48:21] anyway back to the wind you know her
[48:22] brother said you know something that was
[48:25] you know it was good and bad at the same
[48:27] time you know what I'm saying
[48:29] and Lil Wayne said well you know and she
[48:31] just quoted the scripture to him
[48:33] she said me and my wife are going to
[48:35] these churches and me and my wife
[48:36] Minister and she said what's wrong with
[48:37] you you can preach
[48:41] see
[48:42] that's aligning up the word
[48:45] that's your brother
[48:47] you know we didn't go into oh you know
[48:49] to see
[48:51] if you offend somebody
[48:54] you could have went in oh the Bible said
[48:55] don't you know the what no of course not
[48:58] we know that but they don't
[49:01] so see there's little ways that you can
[49:05] amen
[49:07] help us Jesus amen
[49:10] first Peter 3
[49:12] and I'm going to read one to six
[49:14] and here we already got into this amen
[49:16] and just how we're talking and I'm going
[49:19] to read some it uh scriptures on peace
[49:22] and just see where God takes us this
[49:24] morning but likewise wives be subjective
[49:27] to your own husbands now see we already
[49:30] said that but if the husbands would get
[49:32] subjective to God
[49:34] it'd be a piece of cake
[49:37] that's called reverse Mass
[49:40] man we're not preaching our lives this
[49:43] morning
[49:44] many miles from it
[49:46] yeah the day May that if any obey not
[49:50] the word that they may be without the
[49:52] word be won by the conversation of the
[49:55] wife I wonder if that would apply with
[49:57] the husband too
[49:58] of course it was
[50:00] uh-huh
[50:01] husbands have no
[50:04] scriptures to be rude and they have a
[50:08] whole lot to submit Die daily
[50:11] humble
[50:13] patient
[50:15] kind
[50:17] wow
[50:19] hey man
[50:22] you know the Bible says that uh how does
[50:25] that say it I'm just this is fresh this
[50:27] the Bible says that a a word in Grace or
[50:30] a word in kindness sends turns away
[50:32] Wrath
[50:35] that's good for men too
[50:37] oh honey bless God
[50:43] uh-huh
[50:44] wow be careful who we've seen John and
[50:47] Laura Garrett too yesterday coming back
[50:49] and they send you their greetings amen
[50:53] Hallelujah may God help us amen and why
[50:56] we Behold our chaste conversation
[50:59] coupled with fear
[51:03] this is good for ministers too
[51:08] thank you Vanessa amen that's the truth
[51:10] amen you know when you know when you
[51:12] read first Peter three the other
[51:15] well I'd hugely encourage you to read
[51:18] first Peter 3 chapter there's there's a
[51:21] lot of good you just need to read a
[51:22] burst an hour
[51:24] kind of let it soak in amen those who
[51:27] are doing you see we're talking about
[51:28] the beauty of Christ and and see this is
[51:30] a mystery amen and what we're looking
[51:32] into and what I got up here my iPad was
[51:35] it was proverbs 31 is who can find a
[51:37] virtuous woman
[51:40] but we're not just talking about in the
[51:42] flesh I mean the flesh is fine but
[51:43] that's the only type of the spirit who
[51:45] are we a virtuous woman
[51:48] there's a lot of stuff that goes with
[51:49] that
[51:51] amen God help me
[51:54] who's adorning let it not be of the
[51:57] outward adorning and painted embroidered
[51:59] a hair and a wearing of gold and putting
[52:01] on of apparel
[52:03] and people would take this right out of
[52:06] contacts and stop there but watch this
[52:09] here this is this is a mystery but let
[52:11] it be
[52:14] the hidden man
[52:17] notice it never said woman
[52:22] but let it be the hidden man of the
[52:24] heart
[52:26] and in that which is
[52:28] not corruptable
[52:30] but even the ornaments of a mink and a
[52:35] quiet spear which is in the sight of God
[52:40] a great price now I want to just go slow
[52:44] here this is I hope this is all right
[52:46] I'm this is just this ain't Revival this
[52:48] is just teaching
[52:49] this scripture said men
[52:53] you know men don't normally Adorn
[52:55] themselves with gold
[52:59] normally the scriptures preached about
[53:02] women
[53:03] but the Bible said
[53:05] men
[53:07] see when I go to the restaurant the
[53:09] women are the people in the restaurant
[53:10] they don't see my long hair and they
[53:13] don't see my dress so I look like a man
[53:16] like they would recognize my wife but
[53:19] they can pick up your quiet and meat
[53:22] spirit
[53:26] oh I tell you what you say well maybe
[53:28] not if you don't the waitress sure can
[53:35] the people you're with sure Ken
[53:39] amen
[53:41] for after this matter in Old Times the
[53:44] holy women also who trusted in God Adorn
[53:47] themselves being subject to their own
[53:50] husbands that's also us being subject
[53:53] to Christ
[53:55] men
[53:56] being subject the five-fold ministry
[53:59] being subject to Christ
[54:02] amen
[54:03] the fivefold ministry have nothing to
[54:05] offer but Christ
[54:08] amen God help us and even Sarah when she
[54:11] obeyed Abraham
[54:14] calling him Lord
[54:17] whose daughters ye are as long as you do
[54:20] well
[54:21] and are not afraid with any
[54:25] amazing
[54:27] man that's not talking just for the
[54:29] Sisters

[54:36] daughters of a we're the children of
[54:38] Abraham father Abraham amen this ain't
[54:41] just talking women here
[54:44] spiritually speaking
[54:47] amen and God wants us to have this inner
[54:49] beauty that you just
[54:53] no I never and my preaching about myself
[54:56] this morning please don't get that I'm
[54:58] actually preaching about this this
[55:00] hidden piece and this hidden Beauty you
[55:02] know I never before in my life went
[55:04] someplace
[55:05] where the the owner of the funeral home
[55:07] made such a big deal about the best that
[55:10] I wear that Luanne makes
[55:13] he wanted Luanne to move to Indiana
[55:15] and have all his clothes and make vests
[55:17] so he could do funerals
[55:20] every time we went in the funeral home
[55:22] he spoke to me
[55:26] Adorn yourself
[55:29] in a way
[55:32] it's an atmosphere of Christ
[55:38] God help us
[55:41] God help us let's turn to proverbs
[55:44] 31.
[55:45] and we're going to read that scripture
[55:47] amen and just uh fine see let me read a
[55:51] quote while you're pulling that up he
[55:52] said here why are people so tossed about
[55:54] he said now you know that that we're a
[55:57] resting price that a Christian is a a
[55:59] true born-again Christian can rest his
[56:02] faith
[56:03] his or hers upon the unmovable unmovable
[56:07] unmovable by foreign minister no no no I
[56:11] didn't say that
[56:12] the unmovable word of God
[56:15] the all scriptures given for recruitment
[56:17] you know in many of these scriptures
[56:19] when I was printing out quotes I said
[56:20] this don't have no bearing on our church
[56:23] because because you're already converted
[56:27] man you know the prophet he said many
[56:29] when he was preaching many times he said
[56:31] now this ain't for you here church this
[56:33] is just going on the tape
[56:35] you know he said I'm not preaching to
[56:37] you sisters this is worldly
[56:39] spirits
[56:41] amen
[56:42] and I was praying quotes off and I'm
[56:43] like
[56:44] our sisters
[56:48] it's not the but maybe somebody or
[56:50] something that would bring it to
[56:51] remembrance and you share it with
[56:53] somebody else said
[56:56] amen
[56:57] amen God help us amen here he said on
[56:59] the movable face he said by the True
[57:01] Believer his faith rests solidly on the
[57:04] onshifting
[57:05] as he approaches the word of God he said
[57:08] and I Christian the faith is based
[57:10] solidly upon rest in this day and age
[57:13] that's a huge huge thing man we traveled
[57:17] in the states and just you know we're
[57:20] not going to get into it but amen it's
[57:21] rest and peace in this day
[57:23] is not the norm
[57:27] hello
[57:28] Hallelujah
[57:31] he said uh Christians
[57:34] Christians now watch this this is
[57:36] powerful
[57:37] Christians we got Christians here this

[58:25] holiday you know I I my our best
[58:27] holidays were the holidays never you

[58:30] me never book a holiday in advance
[58:33] like where today you're at this cabin
[58:35] and the next day you're at the next
[58:36] cabinet and the next day what are you
[58:37] gonna do if the plane crashes
[58:39] you've already paid for that cabinet our
[58:42] best holidays where you just take off
[58:43] and you drive till you get tired and
[58:46] when you see a cabin looks good you just
[58:47] whip in and buy room
[58:49] if you don't like it you just keep on
[58:51] going
[58:52] see the footsteps so
[58:54] I'm just making a comparison but see we
[58:57] got our life so planned that if God
[58:59] changes our plan we're like ah
[59:05] amen
[59:06] Christians are not
[59:08] Christian doesn't run from twice to
[59:10] place
[59:12] oh
[59:14] ouch a Christian doesn't
[59:19] Christian
[59:21] you know you know I I printed a bunch of
[59:23] quotes you know I mentioned yes last
[59:24] Sunday about the real dollar and the
[59:27] phony dollar and just show me Christ
[59:30] I studied on that this week
[59:34] [Music]
[59:37] there's a lot of impersonations
[59:40] [Music]
[59:42] a lot of impersonations
[59:45] Christianity
[59:47] but the prophet said it like this he
[59:48] said you can't be you can't you can't be
[59:50] you can't be become a member of a church
[59:53] you're born into it and see if you're
[59:56] born into a family
[59:57] brother Matt your daughters cannot
[59:59] impersonate you it just is just born it
[1:00:02] just it just happens
[1:00:04] they can't even cover it up
[1:00:06] amen you getting what I'm saying but
[1:00:09] that's the same price see we got a lot
[1:00:11] of people pretending to be in the family
[1:00:15] but you can adopt kids but they're going
[1:00:16] to look different to me
[1:00:18] or they're going to act different you
[1:00:20] you may love them to death but they're
[1:00:22] still not
[1:00:23] born
[1:00:25] amen
[1:00:27] Christians don't Foster fume or worry
[1:00:30] about anything or things
[1:00:35] before
[1:00:38] so we would change our prayer meeting
[1:00:40] instead of saying God give us rain or
[1:00:42] God give us a job we just say God you
[1:00:45] know arnique
[1:00:48] wow
[1:00:54] he said a Christian rest it's all over
[1:00:57] it's all finished just like the
[1:00:58] scripture says you're already in God's
[1:01:02] eyes I know you don't believe this but
[1:01:04] I'm just going to tell you what the
[1:01:05] Bible says and God's actually you're
[1:01:07] already glorified
[1:01:09] because he he knows the end of the story
[1:01:12] yeah it's already finished so watch what
[1:01:14] he says here he says a Christian rest
[1:01:16] it's already over it's all finished for
[1:01:20] the believer at Calvary that's right he
[1:01:23] said oh the sickness may come and the
[1:01:25] disappointment may come and you could
[1:01:27] put in anything in there you may have a
[1:01:29] flat tire lose your job you know kick
[1:01:31] the dog or don't kick the dog but I mean
[1:01:33] the dog might bite you or something amen
[1:01:37] but a Christian just says oh
[1:01:40] it's all right
[1:01:47] but a Christian rest knowing this that
[1:01:50] God is able to keep that which he has
[1:01:55] committed
[1:01:56] till that day amen there oh man it's
[1:01:59] beautiful he said knowing that the thing
[1:02:01] look at like how the prophet said he
[1:02:04] said when when God sealed the train car
[1:02:06] it was sealed
[1:02:09] to the arrival of the
[1:02:12] nobody has authority to break that seal
[1:02:17] amen you may come off the tracks but
[1:02:19] it's still sealed
[1:02:22] he said
[1:02:23] you know the Bible says you know what
[1:02:25] will separate us from the love of Christ
[1:02:27] famine and it goes under all these
[1:02:28] things and this is what he's talking
[1:02:29] about he said neither the matter it
[1:02:31] looks like whether it's sickness or
[1:02:32] sorrow or death
[1:02:34] there's neither starvation or anything
[1:02:36] can separate us from the love of God
[1:02:38] that's in Christ Jesus because you're
[1:02:42] at rest
[1:02:43] brother Dale's still working on that
[1:02:45] part
[1:02:47] he said that old ship the toss but the
[1:02:50] anchor holds
[1:02:54] amen I mentioned that last Sunday
[1:02:57] I'd read that quote I knew it from
[1:02:59] memory man God help us God help us to
[1:03:03] get to this point
[1:03:04] amen and here when the Bible in Proverbs
[1:03:07] is talking about a virtuous woman here
[1:03:10] here we're looking at the worlds looking
[1:03:12] at even spiritually
[1:03:15] man
[1:03:16] that's why Christ will never leave you
[1:03:19] here to be persecuted
[1:03:22] because
[1:03:23] he sees the value of you he's he's he
[1:03:27] sees the character
[1:03:30] the character you know the prophet
[1:03:32] talked about the in the beauty the
[1:03:33] outward beauty is vain Beauty was of the
[1:03:37] devil the devil was the beautiful angel
[1:03:40] amen all natural beauty
[1:03:44] the character
[1:03:46] his bride who can find a virtuous woman
[1:03:49] for his price is far above rubies the
[1:03:53] heart of her husband does safely trust
[1:03:55] in her see now you can just compare that
[1:03:58] to Christ
[1:04:02] so that she
[1:04:04] shall have no need of spoil she will do
[1:04:06] him good and not evil all the days of
[1:04:09] her life and she will seek seeketh she
[1:04:13] seeketh wool and flax and worketh
[1:04:15] willingly with her hands man just put
[1:04:18] spiritual onto this working for the
[1:04:20] kingdom of God
[1:04:22] and God trusted in you just put
[1:04:24] spiritual thinking caps on this amen I
[1:04:27] mean it's got to type both ways amen and

[1:04:40] household in her portion to her maiden

[1:05:14] not out at night She lays her hand to
[1:05:16] the spindle in her hands

[1:05:22] her hand to the poor yay she reaches
[1:05:25] forth her hands to the needy she is not

[1:06:06] wife was concerned that the pastor has
[1:06:08] told us her silver spoon
[1:06:10] he said no I just put it in your Bible

[1:07:20] daughters have done virtuous but ye thou

[1:07:31] she shall be praised give the fruit of
[1:07:34] our hands and her own works praise her
[1:07:38] in the gates now what are you going to
[1:07:40] have in your crown when you get to
[1:07:42] heaven
[1:07:43] would the prophet say the greatest
[1:07:45] desire you should have
[1:07:48] sea Souls
[1:07:51] what have you done for Christ what did
[1:07:53] our Prophet say when he was nearing 55
[1:07:56] he said I haven't done near enough
[1:07:59] what I should have done I need another
[1:08:02] amen and you think of his life
[1:08:06] amen God help us
[1:08:08] God help us
[1:08:13] amen
[1:08:15] amen if we look at some scriptures
[1:08:17] talking about these these verses see see
[1:08:21] you know that we learned this and we
[1:08:24] mentioned this about the the the the
[1:08:27] the phony dollar and the money and
[1:08:29] and not dwelling on the phony but
[1:08:31] everything's safe and Satan can't create
[1:08:34] nothing God created everything and
[1:08:37] Satan's trying to imitate everything
[1:08:40] you know you you just you just think on
[1:08:42] that for a second and I got I I pulled
[1:08:44] up some quotes for that and we might go
[1:08:46] into that but everything God did Satan's
[1:08:49] come
[1:08:51] the prophet said that
[1:08:53] God came out with news worship
[1:08:56] and dance
[1:08:58] Satan come out with rock and roll
[1:09:01] and perversion
[1:09:03] thanks
[1:09:05] he didn't create it he didn't even have
[1:09:07] the idea
[1:09:08] he got it from God
[1:09:11] amen
[1:09:13] you know I I just recently you know this
[1:09:16] is just beauty high Fallout God will
[1:09:18] will minister to you just recently
[1:09:20] brother Matt I was watching a video and
[1:09:22] and the government or the police or the
[1:09:24] army or whatever they come out with the
[1:09:25] new light
[1:09:28] and it's supposed to be a really special
[1:09:29] life
[1:09:30] think of perversion
[1:09:33] Satan can't create nothing
[1:09:35] this thing of the pillar of fire when
[1:09:36] Paul Saul was going down the road and
[1:09:39] the pillar of Fire come out and he fell
[1:09:41] down and was crippled blindly
[1:09:43] okay think of the pillar of fire when
[1:09:46] God called the children of Israelites
[1:09:48] out of Egypt
[1:09:51] are you with me
[1:09:52] and at night time God put something
[1:09:54] between them
[1:09:56] and Satan's just catching on
[1:09:58] and he's coming out with that fire
[1:10:00] you know what they call it brother man
[1:10:01] they call it the puke light
[1:10:05] so if you're resisting arrest if you're
[1:10:08] resisting giving your heart to God the
[1:10:10] pillar of Fire
[1:10:13] fill their fire since the beginning of
[1:10:15] time
[1:10:16] what about the pillar of fire when Moses
[1:10:18] refused to go to Egypt deliver the
[1:10:21] children of Israel
[1:10:22] remember the burning bush
[1:10:25] remember the bush didn't burn
[1:10:27] huh remember the pillar of fire over our
[1:10:29] prophet the god allowed to be
[1:10:32] photographed
[1:10:33] so God don't change
[1:10:35] you know the same pillar fired
[1:10:38] it ain't gone away
[1:10:40] but Satan's trying to come out with its
[1:10:42] own pillar fight
[1:10:44] and they call it the puke light because
[1:10:46] if you're risking arrest when they Shine
[1:10:48] the Light on you it'll it'll do exactly
[1:10:50] what God did with Paul Saul on the road
[1:10:53] it'll bring your rate to your knees and
[1:10:55] you
[1:10:57] because
[1:10:59] when I read that I decided you old devil
[1:11:04] the old devil
[1:11:05] God said that under the power of
[1:11:07] conviction for thousands of years
[1:11:12] tonight
[1:11:13] but you've got to recognize all these
[1:11:15] things that
[1:11:17] you know there was multiple things that
[1:11:19] here that I can't even remember all that
[1:11:22] that Satan you know multiple things
[1:11:28] anything that God did
[1:11:30] Satan tried to talk
[1:11:33] you know they said
[1:11:37] Hollywood shines
[1:11:40] but the bride gloves
[1:11:44] it's a big difference
[1:11:46] big big difference
[1:11:48] you know in Colossians 3 15.
[1:11:51] just reading a couple scriptures on
[1:11:53] peace he said let the peace of God rule
[1:11:56] your hearts
[1:11:58] you'll have no trouble following the
[1:12:01] scriptures
[1:12:03] surrendering to the pillar of Fire
[1:12:05] if this peace of God rules your heart
[1:12:07] which also you are called into one body
[1:12:10] and be ye thankful
[1:12:13] wow see we're living in a world that
[1:12:16] don't want to surrender or have anything
[1:12:18] over them amen no no
[1:12:22] control
[1:12:24] and that's perversion
[1:12:27] they're not they won't surrender to God
[1:12:29] but they'll surrender to Satan
[1:12:31] and they think they're free
[1:12:33] you're kidding me
[1:12:36] they won't pay they won't support God's
[1:12:38] kingdom but they'll go out and support
[1:12:40] the drug trade
[1:12:44] don't think that way is easier
[1:12:47] because that way Satan eats his own
[1:12:50] Amen Let the Peace of God rule rule your
[1:12:55] hearts
[1:12:56] oh that's beautiful and now here in
[1:12:58] Romans 15 13 He said now the god of Hope
[1:13:03] fill your filled with all the joy
[1:13:06] at peace
[1:13:08] in believing
[1:13:12] so you have to believe it and that in
[1:13:14] believing that ye are
[1:13:15] about abound in Hope and through the
[1:13:18] power of the Holy Ghost the let the god
[1:13:21] of Hope fill you with peace in believing
[1:13:26] God gives you a chance
[1:13:28] Amen to believe him and one more
[1:13:30] scripture on peace just just finishing
[1:13:32] that just to go along with our thing in
[1:13:35] Psalms 4 8 talks about I will both lay
[1:13:38] me down in peace
[1:13:42] and then rest
[1:13:44] for thou Lord only make us to dwell
[1:13:49] in deceit
[1:13:51] Amen in a world that's gone completely
[1:13:55] insane
[1:13:57] he can be at rest
[1:13:59] because God is still on the throne and
[1:14:02] man God God's completely in control amen
[1:14:06] that Satan all these governments are
[1:14:08] just a tool in his hand

[1:18:09] they're out of the will of God and and
[1:18:11] to be obedient you know he talked about
[1:18:13] the Bible traits
[1:18:16] amen you know for the marriage vows was
[1:18:19] to obey their husbands now we already
[1:18:21] went into that first the husbands have
[1:18:24] to obey God
[1:18:25] I mean that's why the Bible says so
[1:18:27] clearly never never never don't dare you
[1:18:31] be unequally yoked together
[1:18:33] it'll be hell on Earth that you never
[1:18:36] marry an unbeliever
[1:18:38] never
[1:18:39] amen because see that man has to be
[1:18:42] subject to God
[1:18:44] and then you'll have no trouble being
[1:18:46] subject under him
[1:18:48] amen Christ
[1:18:49] and he says some strong things here
[1:18:53] strong strong things and here he says he
[1:18:56] said you know he said I know this
[1:18:57] Scourge but he said it's a gospel pill
[1:19:00] that will open your spiritual digestive
[1:19:03] tract and if you'll let the Holy Ghost
[1:19:06] sweep through it'll make you a different
[1:19:09] person if you will only
[1:19:13] believe it
[1:19:15] whoa
[1:19:18] he said that's what the Bible says and
[1:19:20] you can never here he goes on he says
[1:19:22] that's what the Bible says now can you
[1:19:24] hear this
[1:19:26] he he's saying this is the question or
[1:19:28] he says is your ear already
[1:19:31] closed up
[1:19:33] amen God help us not to have our ears
[1:19:36] closed up to the spirit of God Amen
[1:19:41] and really all he's saying is that here
[1:19:44] that you know when the Modern Woman came
[1:19:46] out during the after the war and become
[1:19:49] out from underneath headship and had her
[1:19:51] own bank account and went to work and
[1:19:53] became the head of the house
[1:19:56] put on slacks
[1:19:59] amen
[1:20:00] God help us
[1:20:02] he's here he says in Genesis 16 and just
[1:20:05] carrying on the same quote in the same
[1:20:06] these are all tied to this here he says
[1:20:10] God told Eve he said because you listen
[1:20:12] to the serpent instead of your husband
[1:20:14] he will rule you all the days of your
[1:20:17] life he said let her be an obedience
[1:20:21] obedience but we all have to be in
[1:20:24] obedience
[1:20:25] to the word
[1:20:27] okay that's why you don't never want a
[1:20:31] husband
[1:20:32] that ain't you want to know upside down
[1:20:34] he's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:37] amen here when we go into Titus 2 3-5 he
[1:20:41] said here he's talking and this was our
[1:20:44] whole thought was see God uses humans
[1:20:47] to fulfill his will
[1:20:50] and this is really don't apply to our
[1:20:52] church but we're just going through the
[1:20:54] the you know the the word of God Amen
[1:20:57] and it's all for our good even though
[1:20:59] there's not an issue here at all but
[1:21:02] here watch how God uses sisters
[1:21:07] he said the age women likewise that they
[1:21:10] would behave as becometh holiness
[1:21:13] and not false accusers not given too
[1:21:15] much wine teachers
[1:21:17] of good things and that they may teach
[1:21:22] oh
[1:21:23] I didn't think women could teach
[1:21:27] the women could teach
[1:21:30] that they may teach the young women
[1:21:35] to be sober
[1:21:38] to love their husbands
[1:21:39] as their husband loves God
[1:21:44] and to love their children
[1:21:47] you mean the older sisters are told
[1:21:50] younger sisters love each other you
[1:21:52] definitely don't apply it here but you
[1:21:54] see this is in the Bible and that's why
[1:21:57] you see in some message churches Things
[1:22:00] Fall Apart because
[1:22:02] things are never taught or it's not
[1:22:05] encouraged
[1:22:07] or it's just plain not old baby
[1:22:11] they'll love their children and to be
[1:22:13] discreet and Chase and keepers of home
[1:22:15] and good oh that's actually in the Bible
[1:22:18] the prophet was dealing when he said
[1:22:20] that
[1:22:22] he said if a sister got out of her
[1:22:24] kitchen she was out of the will of God
[1:22:27] beekeepers of the home good and obedient
[1:22:29] to her own husbands
[1:22:31] that the word of God
[1:22:34] may not be blasphemed
[1:22:37] Hallelujah God help us and young men
[1:22:41] also young men likewise exhort
[1:22:45] to be sober minded
[1:22:47] and in all things
[1:22:53] choosing thyself a pattern of good works
[1:22:56] and in doctrines showing uncorruptness
[1:22:59] gravity
[1:23:01] sincerity
[1:23:02] eight and a sound speech that cannot be
[1:23:07] condemned man if our men were this
[1:23:09] perfect there'd be no problem
[1:23:12] God help me
[1:23:13] that
[1:23:15] that he that is of the contrite part may
[1:23:19] be
[1:23:21] see that a shame part has become
[1:23:25] normal
[1:23:27] see it all goes beautiful together you
[1:23:30] know you know and I miss the scripture
[1:23:32] but somewhere in here it and I and I
[1:23:34] read it this morning I said you know
[1:23:36] this ain't just about
[1:23:39] wives being submissive to their husbands
[1:23:41] and kids being submissive to both
[1:23:44] the Bible says we all be submissive to
[1:23:46] one another
[1:23:47] oh
[1:23:49] see we're all going to be submissive to
[1:23:51] one another as unto Christ
[1:23:55] amen see this has come together
[1:23:56] beautifully
[1:23:58] in the word of God Amen
[1:24:01] I don't think we've got there yet that's
[1:24:02] in Ephesians 5.
[1:24:04] God help us
[1:24:07] where was I
[1:24:15] having no evil thing
[1:24:17] to say of you you know when the prophet
[1:24:20] picked deacons in this church
[1:24:23] they went out to the town to see if the
[1:24:25] problem
[1:24:28] foreign
[1:24:33] Bible
[1:24:35] verse 10. not
[1:24:38] help me out here honey
[1:24:40] prolong me but during all good
[1:24:45] that they may Adorn the doctrine of God
[1:24:48] our savior in all things
[1:24:51] see teaching us that denying ungodliness
[1:24:55] and worldly lust we shall live soberly
[1:24:57] and righteous
[1:24:59] and godly in this present world that's
[1:25:02] an amazing thing you know one thing when
[1:25:04] we went to this funeral and we were in
[1:25:06] the states and that one thing my wife
[1:25:08] said she said
[1:25:09] he said I cannot believe
[1:25:15] how people changed
[1:25:19] you know what I mean
[1:25:21] amen it's because they never stayed
[1:25:26] with their rest
[1:25:28] the Holy Ghost
[1:25:30] they never stayed with the rest of the
[1:25:31] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost never changed
[1:25:36] so you know what happened they left
[1:25:39] God help us
[1:25:42] God God help us amen let's turn to
[1:25:44] Ephesians 5.
[1:25:46] and we'll read some scriptures Aaron and
[1:25:48] maybe we'll we'll close with there to
[1:25:51] just see what God leads us I just many
[1:25:54] quotes and almost more quotes than you
[1:25:57] could could read amen just uh
[1:26:00] God help us
[1:26:03] I believe it's good sometimes to look in
[1:26:05] these scriptures that you don't normally
[1:26:07] hear in a Revival or at a camp meeting
[1:26:09] this isn't something that you would
[1:26:10] preach in a camp meeting setting or
[1:26:12] different things but you know uh
[1:26:16] all things can be done in love and
[1:26:18] kindness and doctrine of the Bible amen
[1:26:20] and and and God has a purpose for
[1:26:23] everybody no one you say well what does
[1:26:26] God no God has you placed in the body
[1:26:30] you got sisters that have lived their
[1:26:32] life and their their they have a lot of
[1:26:34] wisdom and they can go to a younger
[1:26:37] family and say you know I did this it
[1:26:39] might work for you
[1:26:42] amen
[1:26:45] amen
[1:26:47] God help us Ephesians 5 Amy let me pull
[1:26:51] it up myself
[1:26:59] Hallelujah
[1:27:04] God help us
[1:27:08] here we see more teaching and this Paul
[1:27:11] teaching us how we're supposed to live
[1:27:14] in this world Amen we got to be peculiar
[1:27:16] to be a witness people aren't going to
[1:27:19] listen to what is the the the the people
[1:27:21] in laodicea and the people that you rub
[1:27:23] shoulders with are used to everybody
[1:27:25] looking them straight in the eye and
[1:27:27] lying
[1:27:29] okay so they're not even you can look at
[1:27:31] them brother Mike and say well Jesus
[1:27:33] Loves You Jesus Paid well well they just
[1:27:35] listen to the politician that said that
[1:27:36] he was going to lower their taxes and he
[1:27:39] never did it
[1:27:41] and you know and all these things see
[1:27:44] man and so they they're they're they're
[1:27:46] living in a world of of
[1:27:49] accepting lies and they believe a lie
[1:27:52] and even if people came here this
[1:27:53] morning I would say something they would
[1:27:54] say well he's probably lying
[1:27:56] but when you live on my life
[1:27:59] and they see with their own two eyeballs
[1:28:01] that you're a peculiar and you're
[1:28:03] different and your atmosphere and you're
[1:28:09] that you can't lie that
[1:28:12] amen neither can you live it without him
[1:28:15] living in you amen watch how Ephesians 5
[1:28:19] 1 goes he said that ye may be followers
[1:28:21] of God as dear children
[1:28:23] but wait a minute I thought we were
[1:28:25] growing men
[1:28:32] amen
[1:28:33] God's looking at us to follow him as you
[1:28:36] expect your children you know you wonder
[1:28:39] why your children don't obey
[1:28:41] maybe they watch how you are at home
[1:28:45] for me
[1:28:46] for any of us
[1:28:49] Matt
[1:28:50] do they see you obey God when it hurts
[1:28:54] because see when you want your kids to
[1:28:56] obey and they don't obey that's because
[1:28:57] it hurts them
[1:29:00] but when it hurts me do they see me
[1:29:03] surrender for that
[1:29:06] followers of God as dear children
[1:29:10] that's for brother Dale
[1:29:13] and walk in love as Christ has also
[1:29:16] loved us and has given himself for us in
[1:29:19] an offering
[1:29:20] and a sacrifice to God
[1:29:23] as sweet smelling sweet savor
[1:29:27] sweet smelling saver
[1:29:30] that's like when your kids are
[1:29:34] just doing what kids do
[1:29:37] you know
[1:29:40] when kids are defending themselves from
[1:29:42] the Indians coming you don't have to get
[1:29:44] to The Rock
[1:29:46] because if they didn't do that
[1:29:49] they want to be kids
[1:29:52] see like what I'm trying to say is we
[1:29:54] need to have we need to have wisdom and
[1:29:55] character not just how you treat your
[1:29:57] families but how we treat each other and
[1:29:59] then how we treat our neighbors in in
[1:30:02] trying to witness to them to Christ
[1:30:04] don't throw your pearls don't you know
[1:30:07] if you're going to a neighbor that
[1:30:08] hasn't been to church in their life you
[1:30:10] know I mean yes we God sent a prophet
[1:30:13] yes the prophet through God through a
[1:30:16] prophet revealed the secrets of the
[1:30:17] scripture but don't tell them that
[1:30:20] just start out with with milk in a spoon
[1:30:27] at least let that be your second say you
[1:30:29] know Jesus came and died on the cross
[1:30:31] and Senator profit to reveal the secrets
[1:30:34] of what this all means
[1:30:37] you know because if you throw a kid's
[1:30:39] steak you know I'll have the most tender
[1:30:41] steak but if we try to feed a baby steak
[1:30:44] he's gonna choke head that
[1:30:52] amen
[1:30:53] but at the same time we don't also want
[1:30:55] to stay
[1:30:56] there's Babies
[1:30:59] we have to mature let's go up to verse
[1:31:01] 11 Amy
[1:31:03] these are also an amazing chapter as I'm
[1:31:06] studying just I put different ones down
[1:31:09] and just as a highlight and have no
[1:31:12] fellowship with the unfruitful work of
[1:31:15] Darkness
[1:31:16] but rather reprove them be careful who
[1:31:19] you fellowship with
[1:31:21] man you can go and be a witness
[1:31:24] but if it's your every Friday night
[1:31:26] occurrence
[1:31:29] you know if you're out with the boys
[1:31:33] or you're going out with the girls
[1:31:37] and they don't have a relationship with
[1:31:39] Christ
[1:31:42] you know
[1:31:44] be careful
[1:31:47] you can't be unequally yoked with
[1:31:49] unbelief
[1:31:50] be careful yes I'm not you know it's a
[1:31:54] paradox I'm saying don't hide it under a
[1:31:56] bushel
[1:31:59] but don't move in
[1:32:05] amen
[1:32:06] for it is a shame even to speak these
[1:32:10] things which are done
[1:32:13] and them in secret
[1:32:15] whoa that would say never listen to
[1:32:18] anything public
[1:32:22] that spoke volumes to me
[1:32:26] for it's a shame to dwell on the sights
[1:32:29] of the evil
[1:32:31] it's a shame it's what the scripture
[1:32:34] says for it's a shame to speak of these
[1:32:36] things which are done
[1:32:40] of them even in secret
[1:32:43] amen that's why I said you know show me
[1:32:46] cracks you know I I pray I pray to God
[1:32:48] with God's help that that we'll we'll be
[1:32:52] so focused on Christ that we'll forget
[1:32:54] about who's preaching and we won't need
[1:32:56] to know the name of the preacher as long
[1:32:58] as it's Christ and we'll forget about
[1:33:01] everything we'll forget about where
[1:33:03] we're sitting or what church we're in or
[1:33:05] what peel but it's just Christ it's
[1:33:07] Christ
[1:33:10] everything's Christ
[1:33:12] amen that's why I it you know I I know I
[1:33:16] know maybe we we might need to or you
[1:33:19] know
[1:33:20] know what's going on in the world
[1:33:23] but I don't need to know everybody
[1:33:25] that's came against this message or
[1:33:27] don't believe the prophet because
[1:33:30] because it it's not food for me
[1:33:34] if there's 10 million people that don't
[1:33:36] believe the prophet's message it don't
[1:33:38] affect me
[1:33:39] because I do
[1:33:42] and so
[1:33:43] okay like
[1:33:47] you know what I mean
[1:33:49] just just show me the truth and Christ
[1:33:51] in me will recognize the truth and I
[1:33:54] don't really care about bogus dollars
[1:33:57] amen I don't really care that Satan's
[1:34:00] sitting next to me in the Pew and he's
[1:34:02] impersonating Christ because I'm trying
[1:34:05] to be Christ
[1:34:07] and if Christ is impersonated right
[1:34:09] beside me and I'm just focused on Christ
[1:34:13] and crisis and I've died and he's living
[1:34:15] in me the impersonation won't affect me
[1:34:20] because I got blinders on it you know
[1:34:23] when we were in Indiana we'd pass some
[1:34:24] horses and Luanne would drive like a
[1:34:26] maniac and she'd pass those horses with
[1:34:28] the blinders they're just and those
[1:34:30] horses wouldn't even flinch
[1:34:33] because they're not focused on
[1:34:36] the car going by them
[1:34:38] you know what I mean
[1:34:43] wow God help us
[1:34:45] man let's go ahead here to 15 and 17.
[1:34:48] and see then that you watch
[1:34:50] circumspectly
[1:34:52] not as fools but as wise
[1:34:55] see God cares how we live
[1:34:58] God cares
[1:35:00] this gospel that says well it don't
[1:35:03] matter what I do because God sees my
[1:35:05] heart
[1:35:06] that's that's from hell
[1:35:08] that's from hell yeah actually God does
[1:35:11] care what you do and everything in the
[1:35:12] Bible talks about that
[1:35:15] amen and every Walk of Life child wife
[1:35:19] husband
[1:35:21] relationships and everything
[1:35:24] he cares how you act
[1:35:26] amen see that your white circle but
[1:35:29] speculate not as fools but it's wise
[1:35:31] Redeeming the time because the days
[1:35:34] who are for sure evil God knows that
[1:35:38] therefore be not unwise but
[1:35:41] understanding the will
[1:35:43] what the Lord is that's why God said
[1:35:46] these scriptures are all for our benefit
[1:35:50] amen and many many times we don't dig
[1:35:53] into these off the road scriptures
[1:35:56] because
[1:36:00] many times they don't even apply
[1:36:06] it was like when I was talking about a
[1:36:08] virtuous woman or woman with the I said
[1:36:10] that I I'm printing out these quotes in
[1:36:12] the and the prophet's talking about the
[1:36:14] women and then he stops and he says well
[1:36:16] I'm not talking to your sisters
[1:36:18] I'm like this is there's not this in the
[1:36:21] church why am I printing this quote out
[1:36:25] but it's still God's word amen
[1:36:28] it's through God's word and you'll you
[1:36:30] if you hear it you'll say hey I'm not
[1:36:32] like that I'm
[1:36:33] Christ fed amen amen let's just jump
[1:36:36] ahead to 19.
[1:36:39] the 18 is just talking about drunkard
[1:36:41] that's definitely not a concern here
[1:36:43] speaking of yourself speaking to
[1:36:46] yourself in Psalms and hymns and
[1:36:49] spiritual songs and singing and Melodies
[1:36:51] In Your Heart unto the Lord
[1:36:57] now here's God trying to show you what
[1:37:00] you should be dwelling on
[1:37:02] it doesn't say listen to the news Fox
[1:37:12] it doesn't say either
[1:37:14] that
[1:37:16] it doesn't say either that you know the
[1:37:19] preaching of the word is the most
[1:37:20] important part so I just come to church
[1:37:22] I don't need to be in the worship
[1:37:24] service because I'm beyond that
[1:37:28] you're not even converted yet
[1:37:31] if you don't if you're so converted that
[1:37:33] you don't think you need to worship your
[1:37:35] lord and savior
[1:37:39] oh I've heard that one
[1:37:41] well you know
[1:37:43] the worship service it's just always
[1:37:45] dull
[1:37:46] there's a terrible
[1:37:48] person that sings opportunities brother
[1:37:50] day or
[1:37:51] I mean they think of something
[1:37:53] oh the woman she didn't know the you
[1:37:55] know the sister Luanne she didn't know
[1:37:56] that one song messed up my whole
[1:37:58] concentration
[1:38:03] wow
[1:38:04] feel sorry for you but here's here's the
[1:38:07] Bible we'll have no excuse but speaking
[1:38:10] to yourself in Psalms and hymns
[1:38:12] spiritual songs and singing Melodies in
[1:38:14] your heart to the Lord
[1:38:16] see this is saying what you are what you
[1:38:18] eat
[1:38:19] you are what you eat if you listen to
[1:38:21] Fox News three times a day do you pray
[1:38:24] pray and read your Bible three times a
[1:38:26] day
[1:38:28] be careful with all this this internet
[1:38:30] stuff because you'll never shut it off
[1:38:33] you know watch this you know when we're
[1:38:36] reading our Bible say uh that's enough
[1:38:38] I'm done
[1:38:40] well when you go on Facebook oh oh no
[1:38:43] there's never enough
[1:38:47] uh-huh
[1:38:51] you're never on Facebook you say oh I
[1:38:53] think I've been on here long enough no
[1:38:55] nothing
[1:38:57] that's a trap of the devil
[1:39:00] and you become what you eat and then
[1:39:03] when you go to a funeral that you
[1:39:05] haven't seen somebody for 30 years they
[1:39:06] say wow I can't believe how
[1:39:09] they've changed
[1:39:15] and it was just
[1:39:16] hair per day
[1:39:19] and when you see him and you say wow are
[1:39:23] you still going to church anymore
[1:39:31] wow
[1:39:33] let's drop to 22 and and I promise we'll
[1:39:36] close when we get to the end of the
[1:39:37] chapter
[1:39:38] amen hear wives submit yourself unto
[1:39:41] your husbands as on to the Lord now see
[1:39:43] the husbands have to be already
[1:39:45] submitted unto the Lord this is I'm not
[1:39:47] preaching to wives here believe me he
[1:39:50] said but for husbands it's the head of
[1:39:53] the wife even as Christ is the head of
[1:39:55] the church and the savior of the body
[1:39:59] so you don't definitely want to be a
[1:40:02] wife if that husband ain't got a savior
[1:40:05] good definitely don't want to be that
[1:40:08] no no no if you want to go to a
[1:40:10] concentration camp just go direct don't
[1:40:12] go through a man
[1:40:16] wow God help us
[1:40:19] amen therefore as the church
[1:40:22] is subject unto Christ
[1:40:25] there you go
[1:40:27] you know what I'm trying to say
[1:40:29] it's really easy for the fivefold
[1:40:31] ministry to preach on the women
[1:40:33] but they're only revealing what's
[1:40:36] already been preached from the fightful
[1:40:37] ministry in the men
[1:40:40] because our very Prophet said
[1:40:44] that the wife is the reflection of the
[1:40:47] man and the wife he picks reveals who he
[1:40:51] really is
[1:40:56] you want to know who a man is just take
[1:40:57] a look at his wife and look at her
[1:40:59] character
[1:41:01] and you'll say wow that man my brother's
[1:41:03] got a lot of character
[1:41:06] right man God help us
[1:41:09] therefore the church is subject to
[1:41:11] Christ so let the wives be to their own
[1:41:13] husbands and everything
[1:41:15] so let the church and the five-fold
[1:41:18] ministry be subject to Christ
[1:41:22] in everything
[1:41:24] amen
[1:41:26] amen this is combat our Prophet said all
[1:41:29] scripture had compound meaning
[1:41:32] amen husbands love your wife even as
[1:41:34] Christ loved the church and gave himself
[1:41:36] for it amen
[1:41:40] that he might
[1:41:41] sacrifice
[1:41:44] sanctify it and cleanse it with the
[1:41:46] washing of the water
[1:41:48] by the word amen God is changing thee by
[1:41:52] glory to glory he's changing me amen I'm
[1:41:55] still here he's still working on me
[1:41:59] there's still hope
[1:42:01] because Christ is still on the throne
[1:42:03] amen hallelujah
[1:42:06] thank you Lord Jesus that he might
[1:42:08] present to himself
[1:42:12] not a glorious wife a glorious church
[1:42:15] that's that's brothers and sisters amen
[1:42:18] spiritually speaking that Christ see we
[1:42:21] have to get the character of Christ amen
[1:42:24] it's not we're not pointing our fingers
[1:42:26] Point them at me
[1:42:28] amen
[1:42:29] it's all of us we all need to be in an
[1:42:33] atmosphere and a character and the the
[1:42:35] discipline of Christ
[1:42:37] men there's no big Jesus God ain't
[1:42:40] respecters a person he give just as much
[1:42:43] blood for the sisters and the children
[1:42:45] as he did the brothers and the fivefold
[1:42:47] ministry
[1:42:48] amen you see but when it's all in
[1:42:52] perfect tune
[1:42:54] beautiful
[1:42:56] most beautiful thing you ever see
[1:42:58] Brothers submissive and and to to each
[1:43:02] other and brotherly love and respect and
[1:43:04] honor and and as as as if they were
[1:43:08] talking to Jesus Christ in the flesh
[1:43:10] wow
[1:43:13] that's a powerful Church
[1:43:16] did anybody present himself a glorious
[1:43:18] Church having that spot or wrinkle or
[1:43:21] any such thing but that is that should
[1:43:23] be holy
[1:43:24] and Without Blame You See God gave us
[1:43:27] all these scriptures what what did he
[1:43:29] what did he say in the first quote we
[1:43:31] read that your resting place
[1:43:33] would be in uh
[1:43:35] word of God
[1:43:38] and so he taught us how to become this
[1:43:42] this this amazing church amen
[1:43:47] Hallelujah so what man to love their
[1:43:50] wives as their own body that he loveth
[1:43:53] his wife loves himself here because
[1:43:55] Christ did that he he left the Splendor
[1:43:58] of Heaven to die for me
[1:44:00] we can't comprehend that
[1:44:03] we can try but we can't comprehend that
[1:44:07] amen
[1:44:11] for no man hate us its own flesh but
[1:44:14] nourish it and cherish it even as the
[1:44:16] Lord does nourish and cherish the church
[1:44:18] so why we to be members of his
[1:44:22] of his body and his flesh and his bone
[1:44:26] talking about Christ
[1:44:28] Jesus for this cause a man to leave his
[1:44:31] mother and father Leave the World Behind
[1:44:34] and so join unto his wife and the two
[1:44:38] shall be one flesh and this is a great
[1:44:42] mystery now that's why I was trying to
[1:44:43] bring you to spiritual all the way
[1:44:45] through
[1:44:48] amen that you would be bone of his bone
[1:44:50] and flesh of his flesh Jehovah God
[1:44:54] and you'd be so much like God the people
[1:44:57] are just like
[1:45:07] this is a great mystery and I speak
[1:45:09] concerning Christ and its Church
[1:45:13] nevertheless let everyone in particular
[1:45:17] so love his wife even as himself and his
[1:45:21] wife reverence
[1:45:23] from her husband
[1:45:25] may God help us amen I wish I could find
[1:45:28] that scripture I read this morning
[1:45:30] talked about us being in subjection and
[1:45:34] surrendered to each other
[1:45:37] amen as we surrender to each other with
[1:45:40] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're
[1:45:42] surrendering to Christ
[1:45:44] see everything in the Christian family
[1:45:46] was about surrendering
[1:45:49] and everything in the world we're living
[1:45:51] in is about fighting
[1:45:56] and
[1:45:58] as much as your believers
[1:46:01] you're still living in this world
[1:46:03] and and if those Spirits you know you
[1:46:06] know you something happens and you and
[1:46:09] okay you have to have lengths off blood
[1:46:11] but something happens and you just go
[1:46:12] woohoo
[1:46:14] I'll tell you
[1:46:16] and and then there's something in there
[1:46:18] goes uh
[1:46:23] you know I read scriptures this week and
[1:46:25] even in studying you know how Christ
[1:46:27] you'll read that in First Peter 3 the
[1:46:30] chapter how how Christ surrendered
[1:46:33] completely
[1:46:34] persecution itself
[1:46:37] no much less will his wife
[1:46:39] even the Bible says how the the wife
[1:46:42] would say the wife would say the husband
[1:46:45] in her
[1:46:47] character and Chase spoken words
[1:46:50] now if you put spiritual eyes in that
[1:46:52] you know for the matter if we could just
[1:46:54] speak in a situate that brother Dale and
[1:46:57] brother Matt and brother Bernard we
[1:46:59] brother Tim that we would save our
[1:47:02] neighbor
[1:47:03] soul
[1:47:04] just by our Chase character and our
[1:47:07] spoken word
[1:47:13] you know the prophet said things about
[1:47:14] that that people's internal destination
[1:47:16] was the thing by how we reacted to an
[1:47:20] action of road rage
[1:47:24] oh show them plus God
[1:47:30] that man's got
[1:47:33] ta that help us amen God
[1:47:35] help me amen
[1:47:38] Hallelujah
[1:47:40] to help us
[1:47:43] see God I'm going to close with that
[1:47:46] forgive me this we've got just a little
[1:47:47] bit of time first Samuel 15. I've just
[1:47:50] moved to here and then I'll close I said
[1:47:53] forgive me
[1:47:54] I shouldn't say I was closing
[1:47:56] but here the Bible is teaching us that
[1:47:59] obedience
[1:48:01] is better than sacrifice
[1:48:03] and God is ex this I just felt to say
[1:48:06] this because see God wants us to be in
[1:48:08] obedience to his word and to him
[1:48:13] better than our confession of this light
[1:48:15] talk
[1:48:16] huh
[1:48:20] because see you you watch us as you
[1:48:24] mature in Christ you'll see that people
[1:48:26] that got this light top
[1:48:28] watch be careful just just watch they
[1:48:32] might be an impersonator
[1:48:36] huh you know just like if if if if if
[1:48:40] you're a sister and you're going to
[1:48:43] marry a man watch how that man treats
[1:48:45] his mother
[1:48:47] or the sisters in the church
[1:48:51] and you'll know exactly how he'll treat
[1:48:53] you in private
[1:48:56] actually actually went back it'll be
[1:48:58] worse in private
[1:49:01] so if you see him just remotely snub a
[1:49:04] sister or just even a hint just even
[1:49:08] that much snub his mum
[1:49:11] in public
[1:49:12] for run through your life
[1:49:15] because when you're in private
[1:49:18] oh yeah oh yeah see God give us wisdom
[1:49:22] and it's called the Holy Ghost
[1:49:26] because see the the Devil is a smooth
[1:49:31] but he don't have the life
[1:49:33] you don't have the life
[1:49:34] here here first Samuel 15 22 he said
[1:49:37] Samuel said hath the Lord give great
[1:49:39] delight and bird offerings and sacrifice
[1:49:41] as in obedience to the voice of the Lord
[1:49:45] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:49:49] and to hearken than to Fat ramps fat and
[1:49:53] a fat of rams for now watch this is
[1:49:56] powerful and I I am going to close for
[1:49:59] Rebellion as of sin of Witchcraft that's
[1:50:03] Rebellion to the word of God
[1:50:06] when you just see it laid right out
[1:50:07] there no matter how dry it's preached
[1:50:09] and
[1:50:10] in this type of a morning teaching
[1:50:12] fashion and you just see it and say well
[1:50:15] I you know the prophet talked about with
[1:50:16] when he would go to sisters and they
[1:50:18] said well it says so obey your husband
[1:50:19] said I'll show him I'm an American
[1:50:24] yeah no different than on to obey Christ
[1:50:29] man well I'll show him I I have this
[1:50:32] doctrine that
[1:50:33] uh-huh
[1:50:37] for Rebellion as of witchcraft
[1:50:41] just think of that spiritually and the
[1:50:43] spiritual world
[1:50:45] on the word of God
[1:50:49] impersonation
[1:50:51] huge
[1:50:53] and stubbornness
[1:50:56] is as the sin of Witchcraft stubbornness
[1:50:58] as is as iniquity knowing to do right
[1:51:03] and not doing it
[1:51:04] and idolatry
[1:51:07] because thou has rejected the word of
[1:51:10] the Lord
[1:51:11] and he hath also rejected thee
[1:51:14] as being part of his bride it says as
[1:51:17] being King
[1:51:19] but see all scriptures start compound me
[1:51:22] so just picture that spiritually
[1:51:24] speaking
[1:51:26] and go wow
[1:51:29] God help brother Dale
[1:51:32] all scripture
[1:51:34] they sing brother
[1:51:36] all scripture
[1:51:39] is given for our good
[1:51:42] Matt
[1:51:43] it's given for brother Dale's gift
[1:51:45] amen it's good for reproof
[1:51:48] correction
[1:51:49] and now let's stand
[1:51:53] when you see things come forth
[1:51:56] amen right out of the word of God and
[1:51:59] it's just you're and well it's
[1:52:01] impossible for your human flesh to come
[1:52:03] up because see you don't have human
[1:52:04] flesh no more you see it dying
[1:52:09] and see Christ is living it's no longer
[1:52:11] me that liveth but Christ to liveth in
[1:52:12] me
[1:52:14] and then see you can just you can just
[1:52:15] hear you so a minister can preach
[1:52:18] exciting or dull or quieter that but he
[1:52:21] was reading the script you just say
[1:52:24] amen ouch you might say ouch once in a
[1:52:27] while
[1:52:28] amen
[1:52:29] God help us amen
[1:52:31] to watch what we watch what we eat
[1:52:34] watch what we eat because that's what
[1:52:36] we'll be and and and this is what's
[1:52:39] deceptive
[1:52:41] it's a slow change
[1:52:51] when you when people start to backslide
[1:52:56] slow change
[1:52:59] when you start to get closer to God
[1:53:05] but you just watch
[1:53:08] and God will give you a trained eye
[1:53:13] they've really grown in Christ
[1:53:19] that's my friend that's my prayer and my
[1:53:21] desire God help me
[1:53:23] as we grow in all these scriptures that
[1:53:26] you know and how how brother Dale not
[1:53:28] not that I point fingers but I point
[1:53:30] them at me
[1:53:31] you can see everything has a if
[1:53:34] everything's lined up in the family it's
[1:53:37] beautiful
[1:53:40] if Christ Christ is a much needed
[1:53:43] third person
[1:53:45] of every home
[1:53:48] and he's for sure the most needed part
[1:53:53] if Christ is here
[1:53:55] it's worth coming
[1:53:57] amen it don't matter who's preaching
[1:54:02] and that that's usually
[1:54:05] oh more than anything
[1:54:08] amen thank you Lord Jesus amen I I pray
[1:54:11] that God will take this scattered and
[1:54:15] it's hard for me to teach sometimes
[1:54:17] because you read and slow down and pick
[1:54:20] things out and I was scattered and I
[1:54:22] apologize for that
[1:54:23] but uh
[1:54:25] but the word of God's still the word of
[1:54:27] God
[1:54:28] I'm not just reading if even if I read
[1:54:30] it wrong and it's up there you can see
[1:54:33] it
[1:54:34] if I say a word wrong not not be not
[1:54:36] intentionally out of my ignorance
[1:54:39] I want to become
[1:54:42] the word of God
[1:54:44] and I don't just always want to be the
[1:54:46] person say well oh bless God the sisters
[1:54:51] bless God your brothers first
[1:54:54] huh let's start at the top work down
[1:54:57] we get the brothers right the kids will
[1:54:59] line up
[1:55:04] to see the brothers will realize that
[1:55:06] they play Cowboys and Indians when they
[1:55:08] were kids too
[1:55:11] see what I mean I'm trying to get into
[1:55:13] his with
[1:55:14] me you don't just got to pull out a rod
[1:55:16] and beat everything
[1:55:21] because it's a life
[1:55:23] growth
[1:55:24] we're growing into Christ yes we're
[1:55:27] birth
[1:55:30] but it's still good
[1:55:32] God help me in that
[1:55:34] girl then

[1:56:00] praise
[1:56:02] [Music]
[1:56:08] everything God

[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:47] pray help me God
[1:56:50] let everything
[1:57:04] I just want to share this just why
[1:57:06] Lorraine plays that and we'll sing him
[1:57:07] one more time
[1:57:09] I really want to share this you know in
[1:57:12] the natural types of spiritual
[1:57:15] and when somebody's ready to do
[1:57:17] something terrible in the flesh
[1:57:19] they normally always
[1:57:22] 100 percent
[1:57:24] reach out to somebody
[1:57:28] likewise in the spirit
[1:57:31] when somebody is spiritually right for
[1:57:35] picking
[1:57:36] they normally in a very
[1:57:39] very
[1:57:47] I don't know how to say that but in a
[1:57:50] very Sly way we'll reach out for an
[1:57:52] answer
[1:57:54] I pray to God
[1:57:56] that I'll hear that reach out
[1:57:59] I pray to God that you'll hear that
[1:58:00] reach out because we got to be lights
[1:58:03] and we got to be salty and our Prophet
[1:58:07] said this he said if we get there and we
[1:58:09] weren't we'll be judged for not showing
[1:58:12] this truth
[1:58:14] and I pray you know in being around
[1:58:16] people that maybe I've never seen before
[1:58:19] this week but or not for a long time
[1:58:22] that if they just would just give if
[1:58:24] they just would just say some little
[1:58:26] thing you could just grab it
[1:58:28] and give them a food
[1:58:30] that would change your life for history
[1:58:35] amen
[1:58:36] the world's looking for love they're
[1:58:39] looking for Christ
[1:58:40] they're looking they're looking for
[1:58:42] Christ but they don't know how to get it
[1:58:44] and I want to be available
[1:58:46] that when somebody reaches out I I don't
[1:58:50] need to know I just need to know that I
[1:58:52] know Christ and I can share them with
[1:58:54] you
[1:58:56] and as far as you want to go with Christ
[1:58:58] Christ will take you amen God help God
[1:59:02] help each every one of us it's not
[1:59:04] that's just not for ministers that's for
[1:59:06] and your own workplaces people will be
[1:59:09] hurting and domestics and and
[1:59:12] relationships and all this and they'll
[1:59:13] reach out for an answer
[1:59:15] and you need to have Jesus on your
[1:59:18] tongue that you can give them the word
[1:59:20] of God truth that'll turn them around
