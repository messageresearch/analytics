And we put Satan under our feet this morning in Jesus Christ's name. We love you and adore you. And may you speak through your word, Lord God, and through the minister to to to bless your people in this time in this day. We pray. Hallelujah. We pray you'll hear our humble cry. Your word says you'll never leave us nor forsake us. We love you, Lord Jesus. Thank you. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He's wonderful. Our Lord and Savior is wonderful this morning. Amen. God bless you. God bless you all and just God bless our visitors and you're very very very welcome and just look forward to fellowship after service. Let's turn to our scriptures to second Peter 3:9. We're going to carry on our topic from last week completely. I very very seldom preach uh more than one message in the same topic a series but but God uh has his perfect will and way. Second Peter 3 and9. I believe with these messages that the Holy Spirit is trying to get us to pick up on something that we've maybe made the message something that the Holy Spirit didn't. And we maybe made the message, what we say is the message and it's the truth and it's the revealed word of God, but we maybe made it something that our prophet never. I will guarantee you before we leave tonight, I'm going to read quotes that will shock you of what our prophet said. And I I'll also guarantee you that there's probably zero churches in the message that are preaching what the prophet said in those quotes. We might have a different idea of grace than what the Holy Spirit did. And the Lord was not slack concerning his promises, as some men count slackness, but longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. Lord Jesus, I pray that you will reveal your thoughts and your heart to the people like you did to me, Lord Jesus. And we'll give you the glory and honor for it. In your beautiful name we pray. Amen. You may have your seats. Amen. God was not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. Now you'll see that scripture that he does not slack concerning his promises. You know we have many many promises in the Bible especially as parents that we can claim our children and put the token over them and our our lost loved ones and different ones like this. And we want to just jump to Revelation 7. And I want to read some things here and show you some things that the prophet said about the tribulation and about the uh the multitude with the white robes. And it it I I would believe in many cases, you know, it will surprise us. And and I believe if we're going to er on the side of mercy, we should heir on the side of grace. If you're going to make a mistake this morning, give too much mercy. If you're going to make a mistake this morning, offer too much grace than what the Holy Spirit wanted. Amen. And he will see your heart and judge you accordingly. But if you get lifted up in yourself and you have a judgmental spirit, God will show you like he did our prophet your sins when he saved you. Amen. Remember when the prophet went to the restaurant and he was condemning the woman with the policeman and God had to give him a vision and move him behind the door and showed him his vision, the vision of what he looked like. Sometimes Christians have a really bad memory. You were born in sin shaped in iniquity and you come to the world telling lies. [Music] Come on. And you don't give grace to somebody else that's still in that state. God have mercy on me. And God have mercy on you. That's right. You just came to the greater revelation quicker than your other brother and sister. We're all at a different spot of revelation. We got We're blessed beyond measure. Not all are though. Yet. Amen. Revelation 7:9. And after this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues. And they stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed in white robes. And the psalm the palms were in their hands. And they cried with a loud voice saying, "Savior to our God which siteth upon the throne and unto the lamb." Excuse me. Verse 13. And one of the elders answered me, saying, He said, "What are these which are way a raid? and white robes. We're going to look into this. You know, John didn't know who they were. John wrote Revelations. You see, John was a Jew and he recognized the Christian Jews. He recognized the 12 tribes of Jacob. He would have recognized his own people, but he didn't recognize these people. But they were given the olive branch of grace. Said, "Who are these?" Yeah. Who are these that came through the great tribulation? Uh-oh. We always believed in many places. It's been taught that it was a foolish version. And our prophet said that some places, but he said other things, too. And what are we going to do with them? And on to the lamb. And hence cometh they in verse 14. And I said unto him, sir, knowest thou not? And he said unto me, These are they which came through the great tribulation, which have had their robes washed, and made them white by the blood of the lamb. For the lamb was in the midst of the throne, and shall feed them and shall lead them. Verse 17, and onto the fountains of water. and God shall wipe away their tears from their eyes. Now, you know, many places in the message, and I'm not trying to change anything. I'm just going to read what the prophet Vicky will put the quote up here below. But this quote here is from Revelation 7:9. And these are things that the prophet said about these scriptures. See, John being a Jew didn't recognize every one of them. He had seen the 12 tribes of Israel, the 12,000 out of every tribe. Amen. And they were not the church. They were sorry. John recognized the 144,000. Yes. But these were not the the Jews. The Bible said these were Israel. But watch here. We jump down to another paragraph. He said, "After this, here comes the bride. Wait a minute. The bride came through the tribulation. Prophet said some did here and after this now comes the bride. After this I held up the great multitude that no man can number. And he said watch here at the end of this paragraph this quote. He said there's your temple unics. See the Jews were always servants in heaven. You are considered the bride of Christ. You're the queen in heaven. So you're not the one that's vacuuming the floor of the pearly gates. He said, "There's the Unix. They were the 144,000, just a little temple guard, the Jews, but they're going to be with the bride. They're going to be her escort." And the 144,000 is the escort to the bride, the temple Unix. Look, I want to just go to the next quote there, questions and answers. And watch what he said. He said there, watch here for us. He said, we come over back in verse 14. Verse 14's talking about the tribulation. And it says, why with the bride wherever they are? Absolutely. He said, the unics travel with the queen. I'm going to drop to the next paragraph. He said, "Notice, and after this, a great multitude that no man could number and no people or no tongue." He said, "There's your gentile bride coming up right there." You see, you thought you had to go in the rapture to be a part of the bride. But your prophet never said that. That was your own idea. Yeah, I believe many of the bride will go in the rapture, but our prophet said the rapture would be so small that it wouldn't even be missed. And so you think the people that miss the rapture are outside of grace? It's not at all what he taught. He said, "There's the gentile bride coming up, all right, and they stood before their lamb, and there's their savior, the lamb." He said, "That's not law. That's the lamb grace. God help us. One more script uh quote in the Christ the mystery of God revealed here. He said the great ransom body came all through the ages comes up and it's going to be the the great throne there. Revelation 7, it expresses this and this great number that no man could number through the ages that comes up there that walk in the light of the Bible as far as it is revealed to them. And he finishes that quote and he said, "Now Christ and the church are being made known and the whole thing is a revelation of God that God's taken Eve back to her rightful position and again with her husband." Notice and God and her husband with the church. It's the church, his bride. Wow. You know, the Bible says, "Let everything be established by two or three witnesses." And see, you know, we have to be careful that we if we see somebody in a different revelation than what we're at, a different level spiritually than what we are, we just put sinner tag on them. Come on. But our prophet never did that. No. I just showed you three quotes where the prophet said that there will be some of the bride come through the tribulation. But he totally thought that the bride would go in the rapture. Amen. He said, "Watch watch how Yeah. I I I believe sometimes that we've come so far in revelation that we forgot the most important thing. He said, "Let's take the simplicity of God that has placed us here, us here, and use it to win souls for Christ." What's the very most important thing you can do? I I'm going to shock you. I'm going to make you fall down. It's not witness the message to anybody. I'm going to prove that the last quote where brother well maybe even here brother Brown says it well right close we're going to get to it he says it wouldn't matter a a bet your baptism that's not what brother Dale said that's what the prophet said now we of course he taught that you should be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what let's let's just jump into this he said we need the fire of God the love in our hearts that we can get warned by some historical doctrine. You know, many churches, it's all they're preaching is the doctrine. Just give them the doctrine. The doctrine won't save anybody. There'll be lots of people in hell with doctrine, message doctrine. We'll be in hell. Come on now. But we've got to have the Holy Ghost now. And they went for only with one objective. That's right. One objective. That was their only objective. to win souls for Christ. That's right. One motive. Love. Love. That's all. That's right. Their motive wasn't to get them to a message church. It was to win souls for Christ. And one motive, love. One love. That's right. He said, "How we see a group of people here that's just anointed by the Holy Spirit and you go in there and there's just something happens to you. Just something that would take us all there with me, my friend, and us together. Go out there. Go out of here under the influence of the Holy Spirit and win souls for Christ." Amen. Listen. Listen, my friend. By the grace of God, with all I can do, I promise God I will pull every soul if I have to make it and compel it and everything else to come to Jesus Christ. God help me forever to win souls to Christ is my prayer. Wow. Acts 4, Lord. Acts 4 and 8 to 12. And Peter being filled with the Holy Ghost said unto them, "Ye rulers and people and elders of Israel, if ye this day have examined the good deeds done to this impruded man, by what?" This was a diseased man. by what means he's been made whole. Be it known unto you, children of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, God has raised up from the dead, and by him this man stand here before you whole. And this is the stone which was set at not of ye builders, which has become the head cornerstone, Christ. That's right. There's one way that you're going to get to heaven and it's by Jesus Christ. And neither is there salvation by any other for there is none other under heaven given to given among men whereby you must be saved. That's right. Watch here to quote this exact parallel to verse 12, that last verse we read. And God's provided way. He said, "But there's a place that God has chosen to put his name." And now there's no other place in the Bible given where God will ever put his name, but only in Jesus Christ. For he's the son of God, taking the name of God, God's human name. And there's no other name given under heaven whereby you must be saved. That's right. He said, "I don't care what your doctrine is. Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, or whatever you want to do. Only through the name of Jesus. Will every knee bow and every tongue shall confess that he is Lord God." Amen. God help us to recognize the importance our we were blessed here to be Christ in flesh to win souls not necessarily to win them to our church not necessarily to win them to our doctrine because there's different levels of revelation there no new soul is ever going to come in to your revelation when you've been in the the word for years never going to happen if you give a baby steak it'll kill Yeah. There's nothing wrong with milk. That's right. Bless the Lord. You know, I eat steak often. Bless the Lord. But I eat it with milk. It helps it slide down the ticker. That's right. Amen. Some of the greatest revelations that God give us, our prophet gave us will slide down better with milk. That's right. In Acts 20 and 28, the end of it, it says, "Which he has purchased by his own blood." Says, "Feed the flock of God which he's purchased by his own blood. unconditional covenant God made with his people. I want to just read another quote here from our prophet. He said, "Now, you never Jesus never said, "No man come to me except the father draws him." That's what Jesus taught us. That's what the Bible says. You see, you don't seek God. God seeks you. I I just want to stop there for a minute. That's grace. Yeah, that's crazy. I want I want to throw something else in here. You know, God wants to show you something. If there's ever a Gentile in the world that feels a tug of God on your heart, just one in the whole world of nine nine billion or whatever it is, but billion, not trillion, billion. If there's one gentile person that feels the tug of God in their heart, one grace ain't over, Sister Patty. Yeah. Just one. If there's one person that's a Gentile that supernaturally feels a tug on their heart, grace ain't over. Because it's not until God leaves the Gentile people and looks at the Jewish nation that grace is over for the Gentiles. But I tell you this morning, that ain't happened yet. Cuz brother Dale's still here and I still feel the tug on my heart. Amen. And it offends me for anybody that would insinuate or say that grace is over. That is the most disgusting thing that could ever happen or come out of anybody's mouth. Yeah. Praise God. It's a self-righteous spirit that I'm in and you're out. Oh, help him, Jesus. Watch that. It's me and you. It's Oh, it's me. It's us three. But you can't come. No. No. No. No. It's for whosoever. God is not slack concerning his promises like some messagemen concern slackness. But he would that none would perish. It it I want to show you something in that that none would perish. That does not mean that all are going to come to the statue of the perfect man in fullness, but they still be saved. You know, I want to go back to Revelations chapter 7 and and that verse there, I forget. I think it was 14. You know, when it said about the multitude that no man could number, I want that. I'm I'm driving this home. Is that Bible? Okay, that's Bible. We're okay with that. And they had white robes. That means they were saved. Brother Bam said, "You're saved when you get the Holy Ghost." Okay, that means they had the Holy Ghost. And yet our prophet said that the rapture, the bride would be very tiny. Just a few. All the examples in the Bible was in Noah's day there was only eight went into the ark. You know, uh in in Israel's day, there's only two that went into the promised land of the original 2 million. The bride was always small. But you see, but this is bride also in a different spot. Amen. My God. Back to our quote here said, "God is he said, I'm just reading down a couple lines. God is seeking the lost, not the lost is seeking God. And you can't do nothing with it. You're not saved tonight by your own merits of your own or anything. You're saved because of God's sovereign grace called you to Jesus." And that's the only way. It ain't whether you keep the Sabbath or you keep a new moon or whether you eat meat or whether you eat this or that or whether you go to a message church or not. You're saved by grace and grace alone. Amen. Now, a message church is the the complete statue of the perfect man in Revelation. But not all will come to that. Amen. Don't Don't run away yet. I'm got I got some really Watch this. Brother Bam said, "Now before the creation, there was a creator that created the creation." And what do you I mean he said as long as you're wanting and hungering I just said this as long as you're wanting and hungering to get more of God. There's more of God somewhere calling you to him. You see or you wouldn't be hungering for something that ain't there. There's the creator. And now there's a place that you can cross to get back. I just want to jump. I I want He's talking about if you backslide there's but when you're down when you backslide you're not lost. That's right. That's right. He said backsliding is not lost. I want someone to tell me where backsliding is lost and prove it in the Bible. Backsliders were never lost. They were only out of fellowship. Yes. Yeah. That means there's a lot of backsliders today. Cuz there's a lot of people don't attend church. So, they're out of fellowship. But it don't mean they're lost. They're out of fellowship. Watch what he says here. Israel backslide, but they never lost their covenant. Their their their covenant. They lost their praise and joy, but they never lost their covenant. David lost the joy of his salvation when he took Basheba uh uh Uriah's wife, but he never lost his salvation. He never said, "God, save me." He said, "God, give me my joy back." But he was a sinner. But he wasn't lost. So you got to be careful how you judge sinners. If there was a man took another man's wife and murdered the man, we would judge him. No, it every honest person put their hand up. If there was a man sitting in this church and he killed another man's wife and killed the man, you would mark that man. Is that not the truth? But your prophet said he wasn't lost. He never asked for forgiven. He said, "Give me the joy. back. Not my salvation. We don't believe that. We don't believe that. Because if you believe that, you want to judge the other person today. God forbid I ever did that. But if I did that, you'd write me right off. And the very prophet you would come and hear somebody else preach said I wasn't lost. See, God can give more grace than the children can. He said, "Oh, watch this. This is still the prophet." Paragraph 0107. Vicki, I'd like to see that one. Oh, there's so much legalism today. Guess who he was preaching to? Us. There's so much legalism today. Touch not, taste not. You don't do these things legally. Wow. Amazing grace. Now, I'm not promoting sin, but I'm promoting grace. Back off and give people mercy and grace. People, Christians, Holy Ghostfilled Christian, fall down. [Music] Your prophet said that the natural types of spiritual. That's right. Is that right? Old people fall down more than young people all the time. Bless God. I've been in the message church for 40 years. You're about to fall down. You know, in the old age home, they give people walkers, wheelchairs. They give people nurses for escorts cuz they go to the bathroom, they fall flat in their face right before they're ready to sit on the commode. Wait a minute now. Your prophet said that's a perfect type. You thought that you got stronger when you get old. No, your spiritual. See, Paul got Christ left Paul's infirmity in the flesh because he had so much revelation. He wouldn't fix his problem. And he said, "My grace is sufficient for you." Because he would get high and lifted up and his head would get woohoo. And brother Brown prayed for those people when he was here. They were called waterhead babies. And there's a lot of people sitting in message churches with waterheads. Water head babies. Amen. Watch what the This is This is Watch what our prophet said. her next quilt. Vicki, no, you're a different place than me. There you go. I'm going to take my time on this one cuz this is my whole message right here. This a 61 quote. Brother Bram said, he said, "What's the matter with you Christians today? Why you won't accept that? break down these walls where these poor humans are. The people that believe in oneness, they want to go and fellowship with the assemblies of God. And the Assembly of God congregation, they want to worship with the oneness. And the brethren desire to do that. And they are that way. But as long as the devil can make them fight fight. As long as you're judging. Now if you weren't here last Sunday, you go back and listen to the video. But the Bible says the Bible says judge not and by what me if you were to judge by what measure you judge will it also be measured unto you. Now, that's just pretty simple. So, if you see somebody and it's obvious that they don't have the revelation or understanding of God's word, whose fault's that? It's not your fault. And it ain't God's fault cuz God has children of different ages. Yeah, just leave it alone. You know, if you were a parent and you know, in my family there was eight kids. So when my sister got married, I was seven. That means my when my oldest brother got married, I was eight. He could have beat the living stat out of me. But if he would have, my mom and dad would have stepped in and protected me, but not us spiritually. See, if old Christian, if the if the 20year-old brother was going to beat up on the sevenyear-old son, we'd just say, "Ah, he shouldn't be that young anyway." What's the sevenyear-old got to choose on his age? See that sevenyear-old is seven years old because that's exactly the will of God when the father drew him cuz no man come to that to Jesus unless the father draw him. So God drew people at different ages. So some are 20, some are 30, some are 40, but some are five. So we're just going to kill all the 5-year-olds. Jesus. You see what I mean? But a 5-year-old don't have the understanding as a 20 year old or a 30year-old or a 40y old. But he's a 5year-old. Just let him serve God in his understanding as a 5-year-old. Just let him be five. If he stays in that family, he'll grow. That's right. That's right. That's what the prophet's saying here in this quote. That's right. Amen. Next paragraph. I'm on 242. Now you see here what I mean, brethren, is I'm driving towards one thing. This is our prophet Jesus Christ and the unity of the church by the body of Jesus Christ. It's about unity. That's my whole purpose is unity. That was your prophet that said his whole purpose was saving souls and unity. Unity. That's right. Watch this next paragraph. Now, I don't say nothing about the baptism. Hey, if you aren't baptized in Jesus name, you aren't going to hell. Now, that's nonsense. Wow. You know, we mentioned last Sunday like, you know, there was actually people that received the Holy Ghost. They hadn't been baptized. All the new people that Peter preached to, they they added 3,000 to the church. They never had time to baptize 3,000 people. The thief on the cross was saved, but he never was baptized. He got to heaven, but he broke the rule. Prophet said that's nonsense. And yet he preached it. We know that the name of Jesus Christ is the right proper water baptism. I'm not preaching against that. But the emphasis. So when what the prophet's saying here, now I'm not putting words in his mouth. If you go out to witness to somebody on the street at the grocery store today, don't ask him what their baptism is. Ask them if they know Jesus Christ. And Jesus Christ will bring them to the proper fulfillment of the word. Maybe they're just five spiritually. Amen. Watch this. 44. And I tell you what happened the other day. Now he's going to tell you an experience in this quote what happened. He said he was in Texas and the oneness church 72 of them had sponsored his meetings. 72 of the oneness church had sponsored his meetings. No. The brother didn't believe in oneness. Not like your finger. And he had Assemblies of God preacher on the platform. And he said at the end of that paragraph, he said he was the finest man I've ever met. His wife was converted from Catholic and he was a she was a real saint and he was a real man of God. I'm going to jump a paragraph there, Vicki. I'm going to jump to 46. I'm going to jump that paragraph. See my paragraphs and here in verse chapter uh 246. And he said, but they were he he before that he was talking he listed a bunch of ministers and assembly of God church and he said those are Christians or real men of God. This is almost a 62 quote by the way. But they were all men of God and God had given them the Holy Ghost. How's that happen? If it wasn't grace of God, we'd all be gone with our fussing and things. That's exactly right. But it was grace that binded us together. No wonder we can sing, "Blessed be the ties that bind our hearts in Christian love." What what the prophet is telling you here is you got your emphasis on doctrine. And your prophet had his emphasis on salvation, grace, and unity. He did. I'm going to show you right here. We're not done yet. And so, you know what? 47. So, you know what? You can follow me right there. I'm not making this up. You know what? The general superintendent, the big most popular preacher of the witness church called me up and said, "Do you know what you did last night, Brother Brandham?" He said, "It was my second night there." He said, "What what did I do? We had a wonderful meeting." He said, the minister said to brother Brandham, he said, "You had a sinner. You had a man on your platform that was a sinner. Uhoh. Uhoh. He was judging. Yeah. Uhoh. Anybody else here but ever judged before? The Bible says, "Don't judge unless you get judged the same strictness. Brother Bram said, "I don't know it. Where was he?" And he names the assembly of God. Mr. Pertie names the preacher. And brother Brown said, "A sinner." What? He's Assembly of God preacher, brother. He said, "Yes." Now, this is a oneness. I I'm I'm going to take my I'm just slowing right down. Now, this is a oneness minister that's judging. He said, "Yes, but he's still a sinner because he hasn't been baptized, right?" Uh-oh. That's how you rate them. If you got baptized in the titles, you're a sinner. But if you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, you got the Holy Ghost, right? Wrong. Now, we know the right way. The Bible's very clear. Be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. But watch what the prophet said. And brother Bram said, "Pray, tell me why." Brother Brenham said he's got the Holy Ghost. Now, I'm just going to give you a sneak preview, but Brother Brennham, by the anointing of God, could look into people's lives. Cuz he's seen visions. So, here's a religious person that Brother Bram just preached for saying, "You got a sinner on the platform." And Brother Bram said, "But I can see that he's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost." Yeah. Do you know that still happens today? Sure does. 51. 251 about the middle there. And he said to brother Brandham, he said, "What did Peter say?" Now he's preaching to brother Brandham. He thinks he's got the correct revelation of the word of God. Oh, that sounds like believers. I've had some of them come up to me after I preach. Yeah. And Peter said in the Bible, repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and therefore your sins cannot be remitted until you're baptized in Jesus' name. And brother Brandham asked this minister that was legalistic and judging. He said, "Is that the Bible formula, brother?" You got that up there? Yeah. Right at the bottom. Is that the formula, my brother? That if you ain't, you know, repent and remission of sins and be baptized and that's beautiful and I love it. I agree with it and it's Bible. But you got to make the Bible all doveetail. You can't just take this scripture and it out and it out. So, brother B asked the brother, he said, "Is that the formula, brother?" He said, "Yes, sir. That's the formula." And so, that minister that you had on the platform is still a sinner cuz he ain't been baptized correctly. Oh, 252. And brother Bram said, "Well, God upset his own apple cart then in Acts 10:49. For while Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard the word preached, and they were not baptized at all." Then God give the Holy Ghost to people that wasn't even converted. Where in the world are you standing? Wait a minute now. Don't judge me. Don't throw no eggs at me. That's Bible. That's what brother Brown said, but that's also Bible. See, God is omnipotent and he might work in a different way than what you think he must. You know, when Jesus came to the earth, they thought he would come to the church. The Sadducees and Pharisees thought that he for sure would come to the temple, but he came to a barn. And so they rejected him because he never came to their assembly. Yeah. Yeah. Your prophet says, "Now, where in the world are you standing now?" See, one man was willing to place a minister in hell over baptism. And I'll guarantee you that's still happening because spirits don't die. You can just do a little shout for me. Amen. Spirits don't die. And here this minister came back to brother Brandham. He said, "Well, that this spirit don't die either." He said, "You know what we're going to do?" He said, "We're going to draw a little ring and we're drawing you out of our circle and we're not going to talk to you no more because we don't like how you read the Bible." Half the word. cuz the prophet was off the word, a minister of the word. You know what is it? Amos 3:8 says the God will do nothing except he reveals his secrets of the word to the prophets. And here the prophet is correcting another brother and he says, "That's it. I'm not going to talk to you no more because I don't like how you preach." Yeah. And brother Brown said, "Well, then I'm going to draw another circle and I'm going to draw you right back inside it again." He said, "Cuz you can't put me out cuz I love you. You see, you just can't do that." Said, "There's too many brethren out there that love me and believe in me." Said, "And they'll come anyhow." And I said, "They're they'll come and you can't draw me out. And if you draw me out, I'll draw you back in and make the circle. Make one circle." And then watch what he puts there right at the bottom. Cuz God by his grace, let me draw another one and pull you right back in. Now, here's somebody that's judging somebody in church, a minister. He's actually judging the prophet. And watch how not only did Brother Brown not judge him, but he said, "I'm going to pull you right back in to my circle." Because I love you. Romans 8:31. We're We go fast. We're We're almost done here. Amen. God, you're pulling wonderfully. You know, we I I I just want to I don't want to leave anybody misled this morning. The message is the truth, and we have the revealed word for the day, but that gives you no right to judge somebody that ain't where you are. No right at all. Matter of fact, the very word of God will judge you back because it was amazing grace. Amen. Romans 8:31. And what shall we say then to these things? If God be for us, then who can be against us? He that spare not his own son, but delivered him up for us. All how shall we not with him so freely give us all things see God give you freely your amazing grace and your amazing revelation and your amazing Holy Ghost but that spirit of legalism would like to keep it from somebody else I'm going to be there but he won't We don't talk. Uh, we also freely give us all things. Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? You see what I'm saying? God's saying you don't have We We read last Sunday, who was it that condemns? It was Christ that died. If you died to re to save my sins, then you can judge me. But God died to save my sins. And so there's only one person that can judge me, and that's Christ. And he ain't judging me. Who can lay anything to the charge of God's elect? Who? Us message believers can. We have the revealed word. We have a prophet that came and showed us the truth. Really? That's not what the Bible says. It says that was grace. Blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah. Because the ministers uptown never revealed this unto you. Blessed art thou, Simon Bjonah, for flesh and blood never revealed this unto you, but my father which is in heaven came down and showed you his whole plan. And because God did that, you're going to high and lifted up and get arrogant. That should make you meek and humble and say, "I can't believe you saved me, Jesus." When you knew the pit of sin I was in, I was way down in the mud. When you pulled me out, amen, it is God that justified. It's God. It's not the message believers. No, it's not the ones that have been in 30 years, 40 years, or 70 years. It's God. That's right. Who is he that condemnth? Is it not Christ that died? Yay. Rather, I read this last week. And is raised again, and even at the right hand of God, make an intercession for me. Do you know God himself is praying for the little child that's just getting saved? And he's praying that God will give him, nurture him, and give him the right kind of milk and just the right amount of times and do his feeding on demand. God don't believe in hourly feeding. You know, some mothers, they feed their baby like at 8:00, 4:00, you know, whatever, every 8 hours. But God plans on feeding on demand. When the baby cries, "Give me more of God." He just whoop pops it in there. I'll take more of Jesus. The bottle's already warm. Heaven's like a great big microwave. Boy, how do you think he made all the bread to feed the children of Israel in the desert? Yeah. I mean, God just Amen. Imagine that Christ Jesus loved the sinner so much that he was making intercessor intercession for him. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? So tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake shall we be killed all the day long. We are counted as sheep to the slaughter day. In all these things we are more than conquerors through Christ that loved us. And I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things even to come, nor heights, nor depths, nor any other creature, even if it's a makeeliever, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. Wow. Amazing. There was just one place that God chose to place his name. The chosen place of worship the prophet preached. It was in Jesus Christ. the chosen place of worship. Amen. Wow. We're looking for a quote here. Amen. God help us. One second. Sorry. Amen. And I want to close on this quote. I read this quote last week and I God's just laying it on my heart to share it again. And we're going to close this one quote, honey. Uh Vicki, it's the last one we read last week, right at the beginning, right above part two. For you that weren't here and maybe didn't see the video, this is a 64 quote. This is after the seals. seals were wrote in ' 63 about the third month. I'm waiting for Vicki to pull it up right before part two. God's word calls a total separation from unbelief. But unbelief ain't what you think it is. It's not a lesser revelation. Just give me the next paragraph. 75. I closed on this one last and I won't take as long. Paragraph 75. Just the next one up. To all those believers, you're a bunch of change in God's pocket. You need to see this. If you're legalistic this morning, you need to see this quote. I'm going to make this really nice and put it on the chalkboard out there. To all you message believers, you're a bunch of change in the pocket of God's hand. And God pulls this change out and there's pennies, there's nickels, dimes, quarters, half dollars, and dollars, but they're all coins. And now that is the world that's in God's hands. And there's some people that are just a one penny Christian. I don't want to be a one penny Christian, but I'll be happy to be a one penny Christian rather than beyond saved. But there's some Christians that are just a one penny Christian. That just means they don't haven't got the revelation of they don't understand God's word. They haven't came to it. Amen. And God can only use them for a penny. That's all they can buy. But don't you reject them. If they can't believe the real truth, don't turn them down and don't say they're not saved. Don't kick them out and say they're not in the kingdom of God because God uses pennies. Amen. The church, every church, every church and especially message churches. You might hate me for this. That's between you and God. They don't like that quote. And all the churches and message believers have judged people because they never measured up to their own personal revelation. And the prophet said, "Leave it alone." Don't disown them. Don't kick them out. You know, God probably wouldn't call a penny to minister. He might not call a nickel to minister. He might have a dime just minister once in their life. Do you know God raised up Esther for one message? One message. She never had to preach again. She went to the king, her husband. Wives can preach to their husbands. Oh yeah. No other men, just her husband. Oh yes. Esther was raised up for one message. Maybe she was a quarter. Maybe the regular people are 50 cents or or whatever. Maybe I'm I'm I'm probably a a quarter preacher and all maybe all the rest are silver dollars, but I'm still worth a quarter. And it takes four quarters to make a dollar. And you can't make that dollar without a quarter of me in there. That's right. Never. Yeah. Yeah. So, if you get rid of this quarter, you're only worth 75 cents. So, watch this. I'm closing on this. This is I mean, this is as fresh as it gets. But in the natural, if you're in the workforce, you put other people down so you get promoted. You step on other people's heads so you can get the promotion in the race. That's not how it works in the family of God. No, you don't come and step on other Christians and say, "Well, I pray more than them or I even go to prayer meeting." Like, that would really cut out a lot of people. But that ain't nothing to step on them and say, "Well, I'm better because I come every Wednesday night." Don't make me one speck better to step on somebody that can't never come because I don't have that watch this authority. God never gave me that authority because the price never came from my pocket. You see, it's like this in a family when your kids are small and they're asking me for my money. I have the authority to say you'll either do this or there won't be no money. But when your kids grow up and they have their own money and they come and ask the same parents for advice, you do not have the same authority because it ain't your money. You can say, "Little child, I think you're making a huge mistake. I wouldn't go down that road. I think you're going to have a train wreck. I done got that t-shirt and all that. But if it's his money, watch this. If it was his blood and his sweat to put the money in here, then he has the authority. And God gave that authority to one person, one name under heaven that every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Christ Jesus is Lord of all. And it's only by his blood that he has the authority to dictate. Leave thy family alone. Yes, sir. Don't take none away that when I poured my blood and water out and was beat beyond recognition. You know, I was seeing a quote and if you read in Luke, do you know when the people seen Christ after he was scared, they they they were they they were it was the Bible says it was like stunnable. the human. The Bible says that his bones looked out through the back of his flesh because the Romans had a way of torturing that the whip had scourged and they would wrap that whip around and then jerk it and literally rip the flesh off the bone. That's right. And then they smacked him up against the tree. the cross. And he had to push that wounded back up and down on the tree to take every breath. Every breath. Every breath. Like when he say down, he had to slide his wounded back up the tree and then slide back down. And he was sliding his hamburger up the tree for that little 2year-old kid that you want to judge. God's saying, "Bank off. I have the authority." Amen. I am the only one that has the authority. Brother Bible, please preach. I The only place that God put his name for worship was in Christ Jesus alone. Period. Amen. Amen. Amen. G. When we get that revelation, the body of Christ will come in perfect unity. Perfect unity. Cuz it won't matter to me one speck what level you're at. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. That's right. If you got You know, you you think I'm not preaching Bible. Your Bible says that the first shall be last and the last shall be first and that whom much is given much required will be required and to whom few is given see God don't even judge the pennies and the nickels and dimes like he does the dollars to whom much is given, much will be required. And what the Bible's saying there is if you're just a nickel, God's going to have a lot more than the dollar. Now, if you're sitting in a message church this morning, you're not just a dollar, you're a silver dollar. You're not just a dollar, you're actually a silver dollar. But you can go in the same pocket with a copper penny. Let's stand. [Applause] Amen. That's Bible. Who is it he that condemnth? Was it not Christ that died? Amen. Amen. God help us. Amazing grace. You know, we should praise God for the abundant of revelation we have. I praise God. It's nothing but amazing grace. How sweet the sound that say I am not worthy to save the wretch like me. But that's God. He's omnipotent. God chooses, you know, God chooses who he'll give the bigger talents and the lesser. And that, you know, when this master came back and he'd give five talents to one man, was it five or 10? Three to another and one to the one. He judged them all except he exactly the same except the man that buried his. He gave the same reward to the person that had two talents as the one that had five. Uhoh. That don't line up with my doctrine. You better read your scripture. Amen. Same reward. The man that had two talents is the one that had five. It was only the one that buried it and never went out to find lost souls. Which watch this? Because the one that buried it, he was afraid he would lose it. The only, the prophet said, the only thing that has any value in the world is lost souls. If we were doing God's will, we take that one penny and try to find another penny and win souls for him. Amen. Amen. God bless you. God bless you. I tell you what, next week it'll be maybe Junior will be preaching next week. I hope so. It be a different topic. I mean, the family of God.
