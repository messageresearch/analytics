[27:54] I didn't feel to go. I didn't feel for
[27:57] multiple reasons I didn't feel to go and
[28:00] so uh he called me yesterday and asked
[28:04] me to go and so uh if the Lord's willing
[28:08] I mean we're we're just searching. I
[28:09] haven't told him yet for sure, but uh I
[28:14] I felt a lot different this year when he
[28:15] called me the second time to go. They'll
[28:19] have a big convention there at Easter.
[28:21] He said there's I think last year there
[28:23] was 1,800 people there. He said they
[28:25] expect about 1,500 people. And uh last
[28:28] year, Brother Nelson went because I
[28:30] didn't go. And uh and so brother Nelson
[28:35] from Scar Bro and uh but anyway, we just
[28:38] plan on if we go to that convention.

[28:53] Salvador for a couple weeks and preach
[28:56] in the uh capital of El Salvador and go
[29:00] to Pastor Nelson's church.

[32:49] wonderful time. If you ever get a chance
[32:52] to get Brother Leu and and sister
[32:54] Margaret to cook for you, Brother Leu is
[32:57] from uh South Sudan and Sister Margaret
[33:01] is from Uganda
[33:03] and and Brother Leu fled to Uganda
[33:07] because of the civil war and he was
[33:10] right around the village of where sister
[33:13] Margaret was born and raised. But they
[33:16] had to move to Canada to meet each other
[33:19] and got married here. Amen. He was
[33:22] actually in Uganda right around her
[33:24] village for five years.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; But she came to Canada and he got sent
[33:30] to Canada and of course her first desire
[33:32] was his anyway was to go to the States
[33:35] and then New Zealand. But God has a
[33:38] tremendous plan. Amen. Can never fight
[33:40] God. Uh God has the ultimate say and and
[33:45] uh we just praise them for it.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So if the other ones come
[33:50] in, children, I you know, I know they
[33:52] were planning on being here. It just be
[33:54] the weather, but uh we'll do it at the
[33:57] end of service or we'll do it next
[33:58] service. Let's just stand and read a
[33:59] scripture.
[34:01] I'm not really preaching on this, but I
[34:03] wanted to touch on this current events
[34:05] and I'm I'm just going to touch on this
[34:07] and then uh I'm going to we're going to
[34:10] talk about this on Wednesday nights.
[34:12] Let's turn to Revelations 13.
[34:17] [clears throat] Revelation 13 and verse
[34:20] 4.
[34:22] We'll read verse 4 and verse 8.
[34:25] Just a just a preview and then I'm going
[34:27] to continue my message from last week.
[34:29] And
[34:30] Revelation 13:4, "And they worshiped the
[34:34] dragon which gave power to the beast and
[34:38] they worshiped the beast saying, who is
[34:41] like unto the beast?
[34:45] And who is able to make war with him?"
[34:48] And verse eight, and all that dwelt upon
[34:52] the earth shall worship him whose names
[34:54] were not written
[34:57] in the book of life of the lamb that was
[35:00] slain before the foundation of the
[35:02] world. Lord Jesus, I pray that you'll
[35:04] just be with the ministering of the
[35:06] word. And Lord, if there would be any
[35:07] still on the road for the from the snow
[35:09] or the ice, Lord God, please protect
[35:11] them, Lord God, and and just keep them
[35:14] safe. I know I know some had poor tires
[35:16] and were changing their tires needed to
[35:19] and Lord just we don't want one's hurt
[35:21] Lord God. So we pray that you'd have
[35:23] safety for them
[35:24] &gt;&gt; in your name we pray and be with this
[35:27] service Lord and we surrender to your
[35:29] will completely in Jesus name. Amen.
[35:32] Amen. You may have your seats. I know
[35:34] when we were at brother Lakuz uh he
[35:36] hadn't got your tires on yet, brother
[35:38] Jaft and he said he had got stuck in
[35:40] London on a little incline. And I think
[35:42] his old tires were uh uh very uh well
[35:48] furnished or finished. Amen.
[35:51] For those of you who don't know, this is
[35:53] just uh brother Bram talked about uh
[35:55] Revelations was uh a reflection of the
[35:59] states and uh the everything type
[36:04] everything was numbered God's
[36:05] numerology. See, the states have 13
[36:08] stars, 13 stripes, and they're
[36:10] represented in 13. And if for those that
[36:13] don't know that the states uh decided to
[36:16] uh take over another country yesterday
[36:18] or the day before and I just I'm not
[36:21] going to preach on that, but I just want
[36:23] to show you some statistics and and show
[36:25] you that we have to be careful that what
[36:28] appears to be good is evil. Amen. And if
[36:31] you look in Revelations 14, just
[36:33] touching on this a bit, but it talks
[36:35] about that in the sight of the first
[36:38] beast. And if you interpret that word to
[36:41] the Greek and and and I've got this off
[36:43] Google, it talks about that word is e n
[36:46] i p i o n. And anybody can have this
[36:49] when I'm done. And it means in the face
[36:52] of or in the presence of and by the
[36:56] blood the secret blood covenant and the
[36:59] world authorities
[37:03] every United States president goes
[37:06] before the pope and it that is it goes
[37:09] before the pope and the Jesuits and
[37:12] that's a face-to-face visit
[37:13] acknowledging him as the image of Jesus
[37:17] Christ. That's that's disgusting, almost
[37:20] repulsive for me to say it. And that's
[37:22] the reason why every regardless of
[37:25] party, it makes no difference to party.
[37:27] It's just uh you know, you know, it was
[37:30] in Matthew where where Jesus or Satan
[37:33] went to tempt Jesus and he offered them
[37:35] all the kingdoms of the earth.
[37:39] See, because how could Satan offer Jesus
[37:41] all the kingdoms of the earth is because
[37:43] their kingdoms are his.
[37:46] So you can think there's a great kingdom
[37:48] here on earth.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; And it's as great as Lucifer.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Lucifer will feed the kids and
[37:59] then he will kill them or sell them for
[38:00] trafficking after.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like don't be deceived by good
[38:05] things that happen. They're they're
[38:07] anointed and of the devil. Here we here
[38:10] the states and many of the Republicans
[38:12] and we could care less about the
[38:14] parties, but many of the people that
[38:15] voted for Trump voted for no wars. And a
[38:18] president that bragged that he was
[38:20] warless bombed seven countries in 25.
[38:24] He's not the boss.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; He's not even close to the boss.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; The Jesuits and the Pope
[38:31] &gt;&gt; are the boss. And if if you even think
[38:34] close to that, you're so strongly
[38:36] deceived, Google could tell you
[38:38] differently.
[38:42] Yeah.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; And when they go, you know, in the
[38:49] Bible, the words have numbers and en is
[38:52] a number 17:22. The root of the word en
[38:56] means the intermediate and it's between
[38:59] self holy too. And and this word this
[39:03] means that the US presidents are acting
[39:06] as a mediator to the boss Lucifer.
[39:10] Watch this. Remember Satan offered the
[39:13] kingdoms of the Lord, the kingdoms of
[39:16] the earth to Jesus, the Lord.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; They'll be his in the end
[39:23] &gt;&gt; when Satan's bound. But Satan offered
[39:26] them to to the Lord Jesus so he wouldn't
[39:29] have to as a side step that he wouldn't
[39:31] have to be sacrificed.
[39:34] Watch this here. He says the
[39:36] intermediate this this number en22
[39:40] the root word means intermediate between
[39:43] that they the presidents are wholly
[39:45] given to the pope of Rome and stand as a
[39:49] proxy
[39:52] that are given everything under his
[39:56] authority. And here it shows a picture
[39:58] of the of the last president and sitting
[40:01] in bowing to the pope. And it's got Rome
[40:04] the beast
[40:05] in front of his man,
[40:09] the saints, doing his dirty work.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; A so-called Christian nation that goes
[40:17] around bombing seven sovereign countries
[40:21] and and right this very month is is
[40:23] threatening to bomb like two or three
[40:25] more.
[40:26] They're actually setting up right now to
[40:28] bomb Iran.
[40:32] Amen. Let's read our scriptures and you
[40:35] can you can fill in the blanks. I'm
[40:37] going to read 2 to four and and seven
[40:39] and 8. And the beast that I saw was like
[40:42] a leper and his feet were as the feet of
[40:44] bear and his mouth as the mouth of a
[40:46] lion. This is where I want to give. And
[40:48] the dragon gave his power and his seat
[40:52] to the great authority. Now just watch
[40:54] how this authority is. Watch how
[40:55] Revelation is talking about it. And I
[40:57] saw the heads as it were wounded to
[41:00] death and his deadly wound was healed.
[41:03] This and the world wondered at the
[41:05] beast. That beast is Rome. And they
[41:09] worshiped the dragon and gave its power
[41:11] to the beast. And they worshiped the
[41:14] beast saying, "Who is like unto the
[41:16] beast? And who would be able to take war
[41:20] of him?" And it was given verse 7. And
[41:23] it was given to him to make war with the
[41:25] saints and to overcome them by the power
[41:30] to and by power was given to him to over
[41:34] over all the kindreds, tongues,
[41:37] and nations.
[41:40] and all that dwelt upon the earth
[41:42] worshiped him and whose names were not
[41:46] written in the lamb's book of life slain
[41:49] before the foundation of the world.
[41:54] If you want to know the countries that
[41:55] the states bombed in 2025, Syria, Iran,
[41:58] Iraq, uh Yemen,
[42:02] Simmon, Naia, and Venezuela
[42:08] all the time telling you on the news
[42:10] that Russia's evil for bombing one
[42:12] country.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:16] Lucifer the devil.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Close. You know, you can worship the
[42:22] states all you want and you their
[42:24] wonderful government,
[42:27] but they will be the ones that will
[42:28] force you to worship Rome.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; It will be it would if I was moving the
[42:35] dead last country in the world I would
[42:36] move to.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Is the USA of the devil?
[42:43] &gt;&gt; I know some of you are just stunned
[42:44] beyond words.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; All you got to do is read your Bible.
[42:49] Yeah.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; And if you want to go more than your
[42:51] Bible, just show what the prophet said.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; About his own country.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That's right.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; Evil, evil, evil. I I I posted a video.
[43:00] Nobody was brave enough ex in our
[43:02] country or the states to put a like to
[43:04] it. But in Nigeria or in Central America
[43:07] they were that since after about the 50s
[43:11] since World War II the states has
[43:14] overthrew
[43:16] 70 plus governments in the world
[43:21] &gt;&gt; and you think they're wonderful.
[43:24] [laughter]
[43:24] &gt;&gt; You're laughable.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; They're completely laughable.
[43:30] Completely laughable.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:35] You know our text that we preached about
[43:37] yesterday,
[43:39] the Bible says
[43:41] that without faith
[43:44] it's impossible
[43:46] to please God.
[43:49] And and I'm going to drive this home and
[43:51] if nobody likes it and it's just me and
[43:52] Len here next Sunday, it'll be fine with
[43:54] me.
[43:58] It's impossible to be afraid
[44:02] and be a Christian.
[44:06] &gt;&gt; You know, on my Facebook, I'll post
[44:08] truthful videos or truthful Bible
[44:12] truths.
[44:15] I erased one yesterday or today. Been on
[44:18] there like a year. I had like four
[44:20] people like it. And the way said, "Well,
[44:23] they're afraid of the government seeing
[44:24] you." Hey, let me just show you
[44:26] something. How the Christians were
[44:27] afraid. The three Hebrew children, they
[44:30] said, "We're not even careful how we
[44:32] answer you, Pope. We're not even careful
[44:35] how we answer you, president. We're not
[44:39] even careful how we respond to you,
[44:41] prime minister,
[44:43] because I am sold out to Christ. And if
[44:46] you come against my Bible, I'm not
[44:49] afraid to put a light to the truth.
[44:54] You say you got the Holy Ghost and
[44:56] you're afraid. You ain't got nothing.
[44:57] You haven't even got faith.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; You got to have faith before you have
[45:00] the Holy Ghost.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's impossible to please God
[45:06] without faith.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; And there ain't no fear in faith.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; So many people are blatantly deceived.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Hey, Peter, they threw him in jail. He
[45:21] wasn't afraid.
[45:23] You You think you you're serving
[45:24] [screaming] God and you got the baptism
[45:26] of the Holy Ghost and everything's
[45:28] great, but you're afraid. Afraid.
[45:34] Not only if you're afraid, not only do
[45:36] you not have the Holy Ghost, you don't
[45:38] even have faith. So, you haven't even
[45:40] started the beginning of the journey.
[45:47] I I I I don't think many people are
[45:50] Bible readers nowadays. I pray these
[45:52] young families will religiously forget
[45:54] about your daily food and do your bi
[45:56] spiritual food first and then God will
[45:58] take care of all the physical food. I
[46:00] promise you.
[46:03] But if you would read your Bible,
[46:05] Daniel, you know, Daniel, there's no
[46:08] place in the Bible it says you got to,
[46:10] matter of fact, it's the opposite.
[46:11] There's no place in the Bible it says
[46:13] you got to pray with your windows open.
[46:15] It says when you pray, go into your
[46:17] closet. But Daniel, because he was
[46:20] fighting against the the realms of
[46:22] Satan,
[46:24] the government.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, not many amens in that one.
[46:30] He said, "I ain't changing how I operate
[46:33] as I serve God." Man, a lot of believers
[46:35] could have read that during CO. We
[46:38] really found out who had the Holy Ghost
[46:40] during CO. I'm not [screaming] changing
[46:42] how I serve my God during CO. I'm not
[46:44] changing how I serve my God. Before the
[46:47] government passed a degree that you
[46:49] couldn't pray to no other gods but the
[46:51] king, that's just laughable. Some little
[46:54] squirt.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said, "If I prayed three times
[46:59] a day with my windows open before the
[47:01] degree,
[47:03] I'm praying three times a day after."
[47:07] &gt;&gt; It is impossible. If you're afraid for
[47:10] what I think or what your brothers and
[47:13] sisters think or your wife thinks,
[47:15] that's that's a huge [screaming] part of
[47:17] why you don't see the power of the
[47:19] anointing in the body of Christ.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Cuz you're afraid. [screaming]
[47:25] You're afraid to be ridiculous for
[47:28] Christ. You're afraid to to let go and
[47:30] let God have his way.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; You're afraid what your mama might say
[47:35] or your preacher might say or your
[47:37] brothers or sisters or God forbid the
[47:39] deacons would say,
[47:42] &gt;&gt; you're afraid.
[47:44] If God comes down and an overflowing
[47:47] Holy Spirit and and you want to cry and
[47:49] you're afraid cuz oh, I'm embarrassed.
[47:52] I'm over 20. I shouldn't.
[47:58] I'm afraid to say amen. That's not my
[48:00] style.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Really?
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Here the Bible says in Luke 12:32, it
[48:13] says, "Fear not, little flock, for it's
[48:15] a father's good pleasure to give you the
[48:17] kingdom." That ain't subject to who's in
[48:19] government.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:24] I'm going to give you a shocker. I I I I
[48:27] tell you something that would just blow
[48:28] your mind and I I'm not political at
[48:30] all. So just don't this but Paulie Evan
[48:33] the Conservative party will never get a
[48:35] vote for me and I'll die of old age
[48:38] because of what he said yesterday. He
[48:41] congratulated Trump on bombing and
[48:43] capturing a sovereign country.
[48:47] What a complete breaking
[48:50] international law. [screaming]
[48:58] Lucifer.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Who who would congratulate somebody for
[49:03] breaking international law but Lucifer.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Remember the world is his kingdom. He
[49:12] had the power to give it to Christ Jesus
[49:16] before he went to the cross. Said you
[49:17] don't have to go to the cross. Like
[49:19] that's going to be a bad scene. So, I'll
[49:21] just give you the kingdoms of the earth,
[49:23] but worship me. And we go, "Oh, you
[49:26] America, you're such a wonderful
[49:29] country. Why, you're so beautiful and
[49:33] careful,
[49:36] &gt;&gt; careful,
[49:38] &gt;&gt; careful.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Watch this. When you watch the teams go
[49:43] and play, that's why the prophet
[49:44] preached against professional sports.
[49:46] You watch the teams and somebody will
[49:48] hit a home run, you'll fall asleep in
[49:50] church or or not be afraid to say amen.
[49:52] If somebody hits a home run, they'll do
[49:53] the wave. Oh, praise God. Praise that
[49:57] ball player.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; But when you're worshiping God, you go,
[50:01] "Oh,
[50:05] &gt;&gt; but if you're watching a soccer game or
[50:07] a baseball game, you're like, "Oh,
[50:08] [screaming] let's do the wave. Let's do
[50:10] the wave. I've never seen the wave yet
[50:11] in a Holy Ghost fil church.
[50:18] Who's your Lord?
[50:21] &gt;&gt; You know, if we seen the wave in the
[50:23] Holy Ghost fil church, it wouldn't be
[50:24] waving at the preacher.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Be waving at Jesus Christ. Jehovah,
[50:29] Gyra, the alpha and Omega, the beginning
[50:32] and the end.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Wow. Here we just show some fast
[50:43] examples here in in Luke 1:30. It says
[50:48] the angel came to Mary. You know, human
[50:51] flesh is the first thing they do is
[50:53] fear. Oh, I feel God's presence on me. I
[50:57] better freeze up.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; I feel I feel the presence of God. I
[51:04] better freeze up. I better not say
[51:06] glory. I better not prophesy. Yeah.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid God will be wrong.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; God can't be wrong.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm afraid to. You're afraid. You
[51:20] You're afraid that you're Jehovah can't
[51:23] make mistakes.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Here the angel of the Lord said to Mary,
[51:28] "Fear not, Mary, for thou are highly
[51:31] favored
[51:34] of God." without
[51:36] &gt;&gt; God's always been dealing with fear.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; God's always been dealing with fear. And
[51:43] I I said this last week and I say this
[51:45] again, you know, and this coming week,
[51:49] if we and we do, Christ is the head of
[51:52] this church.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; And I could die this week in a car
[51:56] accident or anything.
[52:00] And Christ is still the head of this
[52:02] church.
[52:03] The flesh, the flesh person will change
[52:08] &gt;&gt; because of time and but God and God's
[52:11] Holy Spirit will never change. The same
[52:13] yesterday, today, and forever. Hebrews
[52:14] 8:13.
[52:17] And so the anointing of God comes onto
[52:19] you.
[52:21] And God desires for you to serve him and
[52:25] worship him in a specific way in the
[52:28] body.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; And you refuse
[52:36] &gt;&gt; because of fear.
[52:40] It's not fear of me because that's what
[52:42] I want.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Anything that God wants here this
[52:46] morning, that's what I want. Yeah,
[52:50] &gt;&gt; we spent our whole life believing and
[52:52] pretending that. And as soon as God
[52:54] would come down and bless somebody or or
[52:56] or do anything supernatural, we're like,
[52:59] I wonder I wonder I wonder I wonder what
[53:03] &gt;&gt; I wonder who's doing that. I I wonder if
[53:06] that's Bible.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; I wonder if the nine spiritual gifts are
[53:09] the Bible.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; I wonder if I should make noise.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Know, you can be as quiet as you
[53:14] want. He said the rocks will cry out and
[53:16] worship him.
[53:22] You know, you ever watch the people that
[53:24] are serving Satan?
[53:26] You know, you ever watch somebody get
[53:27] stoned drunk or be at a ball game or any
[53:30] kind of game and and they're in the
[53:32] spirit of the game?
[53:34] &gt;&gt; I've never been there ever once. Well, I
[53:37] haven't been there ever once for over 30
[53:39] years, but when I was really young and
[53:43] I never ever seen ever an account where
[53:46] the person was embarrassed to be in the
[53:48] spirit
[53:52] &gt;&gt; except in church.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; I've seen that lots of times
[53:58] &gt;&gt; on a regular basis.
[54:00] You go to the ball guy and you want go
[54:02] [screaming]
[54:04] &gt;&gt; the whole the whole building vibrates
[54:06] cuz somebody scored in the last 30
[54:07] seconds
[54:10] &gt;&gt; but the preacher says something that's
[54:12] amazing word of God and everybody's like
[54:20] &gt;&gt; how come Satan's converts
[54:24] are not afraid to look ridiculous to
[54:26] show the world
[54:28] &gt;&gt; who their Lord is.
[54:30] Hey, what what's a professional singers?
[54:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach on that.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; It's all it's all it's all the satanic
[54:42] symbols.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Lucifer, you'll see them all. They do a
[54:45] big goal before they go out to sing.
[54:47] They'll do all these things. You know,
[54:49] the Bible says that you you you fail
[54:51] because of lack of knowledge.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Do you know that every professional
[54:56] sports has a triangle in the thing? I
[54:59] just watched this the the mind control
[55:01] from Cersant from Quebec and he showed
[55:03] the pictures every there there's no
[55:06] there's the the the the wealthy
[55:09] countries of governments of the
[55:12] companies sorry of the world is the
[55:15] money from Lucifer.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; You don't think they sell beer and all
[55:23] that without Satan's symbol on it? We
[55:26] mentioned that last week. You know, if
[55:27] on my business card, everybody would
[55:29] recognize the symbol of the cross, but
[55:32] most people will not recognize the
[55:34] symbol around it because you do because
[55:37] you're part of the kingdom of God.
[55:40] You're part of the the the the truth of
[55:42] the message. And you would recognize the
[55:45] eagle with the two-edged sword dividing
[55:47] the word to the very bone of the marrow.
[55:50] You would recognize it. We could put
[55:52] that cloud out anywhere and everybody
[55:54] look out at me looking at a new gate.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; But when they're part of their kingdom
[56:04] &gt;&gt; and they do this or they do sexual
[56:07] scenes or they do this watch the press,
[56:09] you know, I was I was studying when I
[56:10] was studying and said, you know, every
[56:12] speech in the US, I have it on my phone.
[56:14] Would any of you would like to see this?
[56:16] They would always say, we just released
[56:18] 33 files from the Epstein case. We just
[56:22] had 33 of this thing. We just in 33 days
[56:26] we're going to do that. So you know why
[56:27] they do 33
[56:30] &gt;&gt; because 33 is the highest Freemason
[56:33] level by Lucifer.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; And you voted for that clown.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; I just watched the video where they had
[56:43] a dozen different government officials
[56:46] and they all said, "Well, in 33 days, we
[56:48] had 33 boats. We had we released 33
[56:51] files of the epsil and 33 we we had 33
[56:54] vaccines
[56:56] &gt;&gt; because they're part of the kingdom
[56:59] &gt;&gt; of Lucifer.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says if your name ain't in
[57:05] the lamb's book of life, you'll fall for
[57:07] that craziness.
[57:10] It's only those that got the baptism of
[57:12] the Holy Ghost that God will give you
[57:15] spiritual eyes and this these scabs will
[57:17] fall off their eyes because Satan don't
[57:19] come in here like a dragon with long
[57:21] tail and a long, you know, and growling
[57:23] and fire coming out of his mouth. No, he
[57:25] comes looking just similar to me, just a
[57:27] little bit better than me. Look, cuz
[57:29] he's got a full robe. He goes right to
[57:31] the ground and he says, "Amen."
[57:35] so sweetly.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; But inside,
[57:44] &gt;&gt; he's a raging wolf.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Seeking whom he can devour.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. God help us. Amen.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; We We're to the point that we're going
[57:56] to go home in a rapture.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; And you got to say goodbye to your fear.
[58:07] Matthew 28, the angel came unto the
[58:09] woman and said, "Fear not, for I know
[58:11] that ye seek Jesus which was crucified."
[58:15] &gt;&gt; Are we seeking Jesus?
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Are we seeking Jesus in this day? Or are
[58:22] we afraid?
[58:27] &gt;&gt; I read many scriptures last week. You
[58:29] know, there's no there's no fear and
[58:31] love and and and every there everything
[58:35] in the Bible. You wouldn't believe the
[58:36] amount of stuff
[58:41] that speaks about fear. Matter of fact,
[58:44] I had it. Let me go back to the
[58:45] beginning here. I had it. Fear. Fear
[58:49] not. Anybody know how many times fear
[58:51] not is in the Bible?
[58:55] &gt;&gt; 365. One for every day. Yeah.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; And and there's different textes. It's
[59:02] actually mentioned in the way of fear
[59:04] not 500 times, but fear not.
[59:10] It's mentioned
[59:11] 365 times.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; I wonder if God was trying to tell us
[59:18] something.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 41:10,
[59:23] it said, "Fear thou not, for I am with
[59:26] thee. Be no matter where you're at,
[59:30] &gt;&gt; be not dismayed,
[59:32] for I am thy God.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; I will strengthen thee.
[59:39] Yay, I will help thee.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Yay, I will uphold thee with my right
[59:45] hand.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Of righteousness.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[59:52] And yet if you were in public,
[59:55] are you afraid to take a stand for
[59:58] Christ?
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; Are you afraid to say somebody asked you
[1:00:03] a question in in this world that we live
[1:00:06] in? And they say, "Well, the Bible says
[1:00:08] we can't do that." That does that make
[1:00:10] you fearful?
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Not all of us. It does.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Most it does. Doesn't.
[1:00:22] See,
[1:00:25] God can't use you if you're afraid.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; God couldn't have used Daniel if he was
[1:00:31] afraid to pray and open his windows. He
[1:00:34] couldn't have used the three Hebrew
[1:00:35] children that came to the king and said,
[1:00:37] "You got to bow down and worship me."
[1:00:39] And they were so bold, they said, "We're
[1:00:41] not even careful what we tell you,
[1:00:43] king."
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Not Not only were they not fearful, they
[1:00:46] were actually bold.
[1:00:50] We're not even fearful of you. Because
[1:00:53] you know, like when Jesus stood before
[1:00:55] the king and and and he was astounded
[1:00:58] that Jesus never responded to his his
[1:01:01] little pee-wee thought and he said,
[1:01:03] "Don't [screaming] you know that I'm a
[1:01:05] powerful man
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; and I have the power to destroy your
[1:01:10] life or save it?"
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; And Jesus
[1:01:14] being God said, "You have no power at
[1:01:17] all.
[1:01:19] You have no power at all
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; unless God
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; says it's okay.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; But our kings, we walked around like
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; and it was God that let him do it.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; See, I'm not afraid of God.
[1:01:48] See, when you meet your God like Moses
[1:01:50] did at the burning bush, he was never
[1:01:52] the same man again.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; You know, I I honestly believe that in
[1:01:56] in the ranks of Christianity and in the
[1:01:59] message, people are afraid because
[1:02:01] they've never really themselves
[1:02:04] met the pillar of fire.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; They know all about it. They know what
[1:02:09] he looks like. They even know how he
[1:02:10] acts. And they know all the testimonies
[1:02:12] of their parents. Mhm.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; But did they do you
[1:02:17] personally
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; coming face to face with Jehovah?
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; You know, Sister Margaret when we were
[1:02:25] at their house was telling a testimony
[1:02:28] of a sister from Uganda and that just
[1:02:30] literally give me goosebumps, sister
[1:02:32] that you have to share that someday, but
[1:02:34] or give me permission to share it. It
[1:02:36] was about somebody that had died and oh
[1:02:39] well I I got to be careful because maybe
[1:02:41] she want to test it herself but
[1:02:43] beautiful. We're afraid of dying and the
[1:02:46] people were there bidding them tell come
[1:02:48] on here come on [screaming] come on
[1:02:49] we're here we're here to take you home.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; You know the prophet said that the life
[1:02:54] there is more real than here.
[1:02:57] Amen.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; She's like, "Oh, [screaming] please
[1:02:59] don't make me go back to this dirty
[1:03:01] place in Wyoming, your body was like
[1:03:04] your glorified flesh was there.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; I'll guarantee you when you get in your
[1:03:11] glorified body, your all your shoulder
[1:03:13] won't hurt
[1:03:15] and
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; your lower back won't hurt
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; and you won't have a speck on your eye.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; There'll be no glasses there in your
[1:03:21] glorified body."
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Unless you want to wear them just to
[1:03:24] look cool,
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; but you won't need them. Amen.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Well, wait a minute wait. And we're
[1:03:31] afraid to go there.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you, I was thinking
[1:03:34] about we we're praying about going to
[1:03:36] Mexico and I I and Mexico has some of
[1:03:38] the most unsafe cities in the world. And
[1:03:41] I and I was thinking, you know, if
[1:03:43] something happened, Sister Patty, I
[1:03:45] wouldn't be worrying about nothing back
[1:03:48] here.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; I mean, I would literally be in the
[1:03:51] presence of Jehovah.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; In a perfect glorified body, losing my
[1:03:58] mind,
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; stone drunk in the Holy Spirit.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; Worshiping
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; my Savior.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; You've never seen me do cartwheels, but
[1:04:08] when you get over there, oh, you'll see
[1:04:11] the best cartwheels you've ever seen.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; And we'll do everything we can do to not
[1:04:20] get there.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; You know, I want to tell you a story.
[1:04:23] You know, I had I I knew somebody that
[1:04:26] had bought a new vehicle and they
[1:04:28] couldn't afford it and it was just by
[1:04:30] per chance that it was no fault of their
[1:04:31] own. Somebody come pulled right across
[1:04:33] the road in front of them and they get
[1:04:34] t-boned and the vehicle got rode off and
[1:04:36] they paid off their debt and they didn't
[1:04:38] have the payments on the vehicle no
[1:04:39] more. And after it all happened, they
[1:04:42] got paid off. They think, "Praise God, I
[1:04:44] don't have that burden no more." And
[1:04:46] then after a few years, you know, they
[1:04:48] forgot that that that example and they
[1:04:50] went out and they bought another big
[1:04:52] vehicle like that and and this person,
[1:04:55] you know, distantly and and and I knew
[1:04:58] somebody that was riding with them and
[1:05:00] and the person riding with him was
[1:05:02] getting really agitated cuz we were
[1:05:05] driving on ice. I mean, the person that
[1:05:08] was with him and he said, you know, I'm
[1:05:10] I'm not afraid to meet my maker, but I
[1:05:12] wasn't thinking of it this morning.
[1:05:14] And the person that was driving the
[1:05:16] vehicle said, you know, if I smashed it
[1:05:19] up, I wouldn't have the payments. And I
[1:05:22] thought, well, that'd be all right as
[1:05:24] long as I wasn't in it.
[1:05:26] You see,
[1:05:29] we'll do everything we can do
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; to not get to heaven.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; You do everything to make it easier for
[1:05:35] you here. But when it says, now I I'm
[1:05:39] not saying that we hurry up, but but
[1:05:42] we're actually afraid. Many are afraid
[1:05:46] that, you know, if I go to Mexico and
[1:05:49] the drug lords took me and as long as
[1:05:51] they uh, you know, killed me fast, it'd
[1:05:54] be all right.
[1:05:56] Listen, it wouldn't m I would be so much
[1:05:58] better off than you here.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Help us, Father. I like I would be
[1:06:03] in heaven
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; and you would still be in Wyoming
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; in snow.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't have to go in the basement
[1:06:11] and fix the fire. I would never have to
[1:06:14] make another mortgage payment again. I
[1:06:17] wouldn't even have to sweep the streets
[1:06:19] of gold. I'd just go whoop and then
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Like there's not fly pus in heaven.
[1:06:27] Yeah,
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; the you you think I'm crazy. I think I'm
[1:06:34] crazy. But the Bible says that you can't
[1:06:36] comprehend
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; or compare the things that he has in
[1:06:40] store.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; For you.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; That love him
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; and you're trying to not get there.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; That's confusing.
[1:06:55] Or is it because we've never met him
[1:06:57] personally
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; and we're going on our mama's faith or
[1:07:03] our daddy's faith
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; and we're still afraid.
[1:07:15] See, when we're talking about God and
[1:07:18] you're one with God, you know, any
[1:07:20] minister that gets up and preaches,
[1:07:23] unless he's just naturally got a big
[1:07:25] mouth,
[1:07:27] uh he would be scared to death.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; But when he's one with God, Brother Bram
[1:07:34] said no one should step behind the
[1:07:35] pulpit unless they've met the pillar of
[1:07:37] fire face to face. But when he's one
[1:07:40] with God, it don't have no, it has
[1:07:43] nothing to do with me except this thing
[1:07:46] flopping up and down
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; because I'm dependent on everything
[1:07:50] coming from him just going through
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 43 and let's let's hurry up.
[1:08:02] We'll be here forever. Isaiah 43:1-2. He
[1:08:05] said, "But now thus sayaith the Lord
[1:08:07] that created created thee, oh Jacob, and
[1:08:11] he formed thee, oh Israel, fear not,
[1:08:16] for I have redeemed thee,
[1:08:19] and I have called thee
[1:08:25] by thy name,
[1:08:28] thou."
[1:08:30] Watch this.
[1:08:33] Watch those last two words. Thou
[1:08:37] art mine.
[1:08:39] You're mine.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; You're completely mine.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; No. No. No. The only way you could fear
[1:08:48] is if either you're not God's or you
[1:08:51] think you're God's too weak to protect
[1:08:54] you.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Now, I I tell you what, both of them is
[1:09:00] not a problem with me.
[1:09:04] I have no not even it would be
[1:09:06] impossible for me to think that God
[1:09:08] couldn't provide for me.
[1:09:10] Yeah,
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; I could tell you testimonies upside down
[1:09:13] even this church and you know, well, I'm
[1:09:16] going to tell you one from Wednesday
[1:09:17] night. You know,
[1:09:21] God has a way of this is definitely not
[1:09:24] in my notes.
[1:09:26] We were here putting up the lights in
[1:09:27] the fellowship hall and you know because
[1:09:30] anybody heard of inflation
[1:09:34] means your money don't go very far. Let
[1:09:36] me tell you a little story about
[1:09:37] inflation. You know, when my dad bought
[1:09:39] his home farm, it was 100 acres. He paid
[1:09:41] $1,200 for it. $1,200 for the buildings
[1:09:44] and 100 acres. He made a dollar a day
[1:09:47] and got his lunch.
[1:09:50] And you know, if that farm today was
[1:09:52] worth a million, you'd have to make $833
[1:09:55] a day.
[1:09:57] But that farm is not worth a million.
[1:10:00] It's worth over two. So if you make if
[1:10:03] that farm was if you were to buy that
[1:10:04] farm today for 2 million, you'd have to
[1:10:07] make $1,666
[1:10:09] a day.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; A day. And that's not counting that you
[1:10:13] got your dinner for free.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; So you need another 25 bucks on there
[1:10:17] for that.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; But that farm is actually worth 3
[1:10:22] million. Yeah.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; And so on today's standard, you need to
[1:10:27] make $2,400 a day to buy the farm that
[1:10:30] my dad did 70 years ago to be equal.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; You know what that kind of a lie is?
[1:10:35] It's called the Rockchilds.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; It's called the World Bank.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; They made it feel good that you got a
[1:10:42] big number in your bank account, but it
[1:10:44] don't buy nothing.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; It don't buy nothing at all. You know, I
[1:10:48] seen a post on on the internet and at
[1:10:50] and and uh and at at at uh that good
[1:10:54] they have the root beer stuff. Uh A&W
[1:10:57] A&W a cheeseburger was 35.
[1:11:02] A gallon of gas [screaming]
[1:11:03] was 30
[1:11:05] and a brand new car was 3,300.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Not bad. I'd drive a few cars if I had
[1:11:12] that price.
[1:11:15] But I know somebody that was really weak
[1:11:17] moment and they bought a car that was
[1:11:19] about 103.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Now 103 is a lot different than 33.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Now if you just divide 33 into 103, you
[1:11:29] got to make a lot of money.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; And we think, "Oh, we're rich."
[1:11:36] And God's like, "Oh,
[1:11:39] how am I going to show them?
[1:11:42] Yeah,
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; I'll have to get a pastor that don't
[1:11:44] have no brains that he'll just surrender
[1:11:46] to me and he'll tell them the truth even
[1:11:48] if they all leave.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; You're working for money that's got
[1:11:56] paper and ink on it.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; And if that government falls, which it
[1:12:01] will fall because all the kingdoms of
[1:12:02] the earth fall. All All that's a ll in
[1:12:05] case you're spelling. All the kingdoms
[1:12:07] of the earth fall. That paper won't be
[1:12:09] worth the ink that they bought to put on
[1:12:11] that money.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; And you're putting in front of eternal
[1:12:16] life.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Unbelievable.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; You would go to work
[1:12:25] to make some of this fake money and miss
[1:12:29] being in the presence of their brothers
[1:12:30] and sisters in the presence of Jehovah.
[1:12:37] shows who your God is.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; You know, I could tell you another
[1:12:41] story. Not that my dad's long gone, so
[1:12:43] it's no glory to my dad and and I
[1:12:45] wouldn't even have but he was up and for
[1:12:47] his confessions. I want to show you how
[1:12:49] the oldtimers when when they serve God
[1:12:51] when they had revival in their day, it
[1:12:52] was because they were dedicated.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; They were dedicated because you don't
[1:12:57] have revival today, it's cuz you're not
[1:12:59] dedicated.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; You're afraid.
[1:13:04] My dad grew tree foil and it popped in
[1:13:07] the sun and the seeds were the size of
[1:13:10] beach sand. He would put a tarp down to
[1:13:12] catch it and just put it in a teacup.
[1:13:15] And the guy that bought my dad's tree
[1:13:17] foil controlled the markets of all
[1:13:19] Ontario.
[1:13:21] Taro is a fairly big place if you want
[1:13:22] to go for a drive.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; And when it was the Sabbath
[1:13:28] and Brother said when the church doors
[1:13:30] are open, nothing would stop you from
[1:13:31] coming. Yeah.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; And it would lose the Sabbath,
[1:13:36] he went to church.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; And if God popped all that tree fo on
[1:13:41] the ground, which some years he took off
[1:13:43] 30,000 per farm before I was even born,
[1:13:46] he said, "Oh, oh well, no big deal. God
[1:13:50] didn't want me to have it anyway."
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; And they seen God move in their life.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. because they put him number one.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Number one.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Number one.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Number one. They didn't say, "Well,
[1:14:07] well, you know, maybe maybe God will
[1:14:09] forgive me if I backslide today." Number
[1:14:11] one. If God's number two in your life,
[1:14:14] he's not even a million.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm afraid. Afraid.
[1:14:30] You know, Moses was afraid when he left
[1:14:32] Egypt
[1:14:35] because he hadn't met the pillar of
[1:14:36] fire.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; He was called of God.
[1:14:42] He was in the church.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah, he was. He was called to God.
[1:14:47] Prophet Prophets are born prophets.
[1:14:49] He was called of God.
[1:14:52] But he ran
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; because the people seen him kill some
[1:14:56] measly Egyptian
[1:14:58] that was attacking the Jews. But when he
[1:15:00] met the pillar of fire, they said,
[1:15:03] "Where are you going, Moses?" He said,
[1:15:04] "I'm going to Egypt to take over." That
[1:15:06] was that would be like taking over the
[1:15:08] states and Russia together combined.
[1:15:13] Do you know if you have the baptism of
[1:15:15] the Holy Ghost in you right now, you
[1:15:18] have more power inside of you, deity,
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; than all the governments of the world.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Every one of them will bow a knee
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; in front of me.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Watch this. Watch this.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere.
[1:15:35] If you have the Holy Ghost inside of
[1:15:37] you,
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; brother Brenham said that deity is not
[1:15:40] in heaven alone.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; What is deity? Jehovah
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; gyra.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; That means I am packing deity. That
[1:15:49] means you're packing deity. And when the
[1:15:51] Bible says that every knee will bow
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; and every tongue will confess in front
[1:15:56] of deity, guess who they'll be bowing in
[1:15:58] front of?
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. I'm deity.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; I'm deity in flesh.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Anybody seen Jesus lately
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; in the body?
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; I have. I've seen him right here. Jesus,
[1:16:14] God bless you, Sister Jesus. God bless
[1:16:16] you, brother Jesus. God bless you,
[1:16:18] [applause] Sister Jesus. Sister Kim, God
[1:16:20] bless you, Sister Jesus. Brother Lord.
[1:16:22] Brother Gar, God bless you, brother
[1:16:23] Jesus. Sister Dama, God bless you,
[1:16:25] Sister
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; uh Sheila, brain freeze. Sorry. Sister
[1:16:30] Jesus.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Amen.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Wes, God bless you, brother.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait. That's right.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Who's whose hands he's using?
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Wait, wait.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The Bible says that he ascended up
[1:16:42] into heaven.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; And he said, "I'll go to prepare a place
[1:16:45] for you
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; that where I am that you may come also."
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; And but he sent down. But he said, "But
[1:16:50] wait until I send the spirit."
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; What was that? That was him.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "Wait until I send the Holy
[1:16:56] Spirit down and then you wake." What?
[1:16:58] What did it say? They said they would be
[1:17:00] endued [screaming]
[1:17:02] with power.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; What's that? That ain't you. That's not
[1:17:06] me.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; That's God. [screaming]
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Endued with power.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Who do you think the people are going to
[1:17:13] bow to? They're going to bow to the
[1:17:15] [screaming] power. Every knee will
[1:17:17] confess that he's Lord of lords.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; And King of Kings. Oh, it hasn't
[1:17:22] happened yet. But don't lose faith.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, when David was anointed
[1:17:27] king, he was as much king when he was
[1:17:29] running for his life as he was when he
[1:17:32] was sitting on the throne.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; He was anointed by the prophet Samuel to
[1:17:37] be king. And he was running for his
[1:17:39] life. That's what you're doing. You're
[1:17:40] running for your life. Don't be too
[1:17:41] fearful. Remember, remember, remember,
[1:17:45] remember David wasn't fearful.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:52] Tell me one time that David was fearful
[1:17:54] when he was running for his life.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; I'm listening.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; He wasn't fearful
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; because tell tell me the time that Paul
[1:18:07] was fearful when they had the shipwreck
[1:18:09] and they were building a fire and the
[1:18:10] the the the poison serpent, the snake
[1:18:12] bit his hand and and the people said,
[1:18:14] "Oh, oh, he must you he must be a bad
[1:18:17] guy. You must be a bad guy." because the
[1:18:20] serpent bit you. And and everybody said,
[1:18:23] "You you you must have did something bad
[1:18:24] because the snake bit you."
[1:18:27] And then he just went on doing his day
[1:18:29] and he kept growing a foot a year and
[1:18:31] and his shoulders kept getting wider.
[1:18:33] They said, "Oh,
[1:18:35] you must be God.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; You must be God."
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; They they went from thinking he was the
[1:18:41] devil
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; to being God. You know, people in the
[1:18:44] world are very confused sometimes that
[1:18:46] that the people in church called Jesus
[1:18:47] Babel, the devil, and the demons
[1:18:49] [screaming] called him, "Why are you
[1:18:51] here so soon?
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; It's not time for you to cast me out."
[1:18:56] So when Saul got bit [screaming] by the
[1:18:58] snake, they said, "Oh, he's the devil.
[1:19:00] God's God's getting even with him." And
[1:19:03] he just shook it off because the go
[1:19:05] because God had told him that he was
[1:19:08] going before the king
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; and he was on the way.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll tell you what, you know,
[1:19:13] Brother Bram said this, you you need to
[1:19:15] hear this. Brother Bram said that if you
[1:19:17] go on a mission trip,
[1:19:23] you don't have to pray about it.
[1:19:26] He didn't say that. He said you're 100%
[1:19:29] always in the will of God. Do you know
[1:19:32] what we miss in church most of the time,
[1:19:33] and I'm going to deal with that in the
[1:19:34] next few weeks when we have our business
[1:19:36] meeting. We have we have two or three
[1:19:38] commissions. We do foot washing
[1:19:40] communion and I
[1:19:41] I don't even know if we're doing that
[1:19:43] today, but we have footwashing
[1:19:44] communion.
[1:19:47] But it says go in all the world and
[1:19:49] preach the gospel. Yeah.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; And so if you leave your home and and it
[1:19:54] also says this, he said, "If you're not
[1:19:56] willing to leave your comfort zone and
[1:19:58] leave your mommy behind or your daddy
[1:20:00] behind or your brother or your sister or
[1:20:03] your little pet dog or the little
[1:20:05] snookle to go into all the world and
[1:20:07] preach the gospel, you're not even
[1:20:09] worthy of the kingdom of heaven."
[1:20:12] But what did God tell us? One thing that
[1:20:14] God told us to do,
[1:20:16] travel and preach.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:21] travel and preach. He didn't tell us to
[1:20:23] build houses.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Houses are fine.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; You know, I I I got a question for you.
[1:20:28] And and you know, and building churches
[1:20:29] is fine. It it helps the whole
[1:20:31] congregation. We we've done that and
[1:20:33] people have done I'm not preaching
[1:20:34] against that. I want I want to tell you
[1:20:36] something. Do you believe Brother was a
[1:20:37] vindicated prophet of our day? The last
[1:20:40] messenger to this age? For sure he was.
[1:20:42] How many churches did he build in around
[1:20:43] the world? He went around the world
[1:20:44] seven times.
[1:20:47] He had millions of dollars at his
[1:20:48] disposal.
[1:20:50] How many churches did he build in the
[1:20:52] poor countries?
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Not one. How many houses did he build?
[1:21:00] How many times did he preach? Three,
[1:21:02] four times a day.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; What did What did God tell us to do? Go
[1:21:07] into all the world and build houses.
[1:21:08] Build hospitals. Build schools. They're
[1:21:10] really good. I believe in schools. I
[1:21:12] believe in hospitals. I might need one
[1:21:13] someday. I'm not I'm not antihosp.
[1:21:17] But are you preaching?
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; If I can't afford to go into all the
[1:21:21] world and preach, but I can afford to
[1:21:23] help somebody put a steel roof on their
[1:21:24] house.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; I think you're reading the Ukraine.
[1:21:32] It's not in the Bible like that.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Go into all the world and preach gospel.
[1:21:38] God had one goal was that everybody got
[1:21:41] to hear the good news. You know, Brother
[1:21:42] Bram said things like this. He said,
[1:21:44] "It's it's it's unfair that you would
[1:21:47] hear the gospel preached to boredom.
[1:21:50] You're bored."
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; But in Mexico, they would invite me to a
[1:21:54] 1500 people convention. And there'll be
[1:21:57] nobody bored there.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; There'll be not one person bored there.
[1:22:02] And probably half them will be standing
[1:22:03] most of the service.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; I'm the same person. I'm no different.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Help us, father. When I preach in
[1:22:11] Uganda, there's people getting blessed,
[1:22:12] slain in the spirit, running the aisles
[1:22:15] up around the pulpit. There'd be 50
[1:22:16] people up around the pulpit. I'd have to
[1:22:18] go through I I'm still Dale.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; See, they're in the spirit.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; See, they're they're in all the go into
[1:22:29] all the world and preach the gospel.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Wow. Well, that was free cuz that's not
[1:22:36] in my notes.
[1:22:39] Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:42] Let me read a quote in our prophet and
[1:22:43] we'll get into we'll actually get into
[1:22:45] our message now. I've actually just got
[1:22:47] to the top of my message part two. Uh
[1:22:50] Amen. He said in total deliverance here
[1:22:54] Vicki if you pull that up that'd be
[1:22:55] great. 90 59 he said what would he do if
[1:22:59] we were all in one accord?
[1:23:04] The only way that we can do that
[1:23:07] is to unify
[1:23:11] our hearts together
[1:23:14] with brotherly love.
[1:23:18] With brotherly love,
[1:23:21] obey the offices of the church
[1:23:24] and the pastor
[1:23:27] and the pastor. Obey God. Now, we know
[1:23:30] I'm going to stop here right now. We
[1:23:32] know the Bible clearly says, "Know those
[1:23:34] that labor among you." If the pastor
[1:23:36] ain't in obedience with God, well, then
[1:23:38] you're in real bad trouble. You need to
[1:23:40] run for your life.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; You need to run for your life cuz to
[1:23:44] protect your soul. But if you believe
[1:23:46] that the pastor's in line with, you
[1:23:48] know, you know, I I'm going to just, you
[1:23:50] know, this is our New Year's Eve
[1:23:51] service. Can I give a testimony? I give
[1:23:54] a testimony. I learned something in 25.
[1:23:59] We're still growing, right? We believe
[1:24:01] the prophet had progressive revelation.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; I learned something in 25. You know,
[1:24:06] Vicki has done an unbelievable amazing
[1:24:08] job. Is our sound person.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; There's nobody in this building that's
[1:24:13] helped me half a quarter as much. Any
[1:24:16] hard difficulty for me to put my notes
[1:24:18] on iPads or or answer my phone or any
[1:24:22] technological stuff, it's normally been
[1:24:26] Vicki.
[1:24:28] I want to tell you what I learned in 25.
[1:24:30] I thought that when you were preaching
[1:24:33] in a message church, this is very, you
[1:24:35] need to hear this. I actually believed
[1:24:38] that when you preached in a message
[1:24:40] church
[1:24:42] that there were believers there
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; and that so you have believers,
[1:24:50] believers believe in the Bible.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Right? And we believe that brother
[1:24:55] Brandham came to reveal the secrets of
[1:24:57] the Bible.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; And this is something I learned 25. I
[1:25:01] just giving you a little sneak peek.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; I thought in 25 from the very beginning
[1:25:08] of the year, Vicki put every verse up
[1:25:11] and every quote that I preached from,
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; we had three families leave the church.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:30] I'm like, you know, I have my private
[1:25:32] time with God.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; I'm like, God,
[1:25:36] did I sin?
[1:25:39] God,
[1:25:41] was I under your headship?
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; I'm only a human.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; I'm actually a dumb human.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; I don't know how to lead. Look at how
[1:25:52] the prophet that the wisest man ever
[1:25:54] lived said, "God, I have no idea how to
[1:25:55] lead your people.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; I have no idea how to lead your people.
[1:26:00] God, what did I do wrong? What other
[1:26:03] book am I supposed to put up on the
[1:26:04] screen besides the Bible
[1:26:07] and the message of the hour?"
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:26:24] Fear.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Fear of the truth.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; You're afraid of the Bible.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Afraid of the Bible.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Why do you think God said fear not 365
[1:26:40] times?
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Because the believers in the Bible were
[1:26:44] afraid.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; You know, watch this. You know, there
[1:26:48] was disciples one time in the Bible.
[1:26:49] This is definitely not in my notes. And
[1:26:50] they were out rowing and they were
[1:26:52] fishing for big old salmon. You know,
[1:26:54] when we went to brother and sister
[1:26:55] Margaret's the brother Lagoo's place, he
[1:26:58] had a salmon there that was as big as a
[1:27:00] log jar. And it tasted better than a It
[1:27:02] was good. We ate the next day, brother.
[1:27:04] And it was woo. It was wow. Amazing.
[1:27:09] And the disciples are out there fishing
[1:27:11] and Jesus comes walking along like
[1:27:14] they're like
[1:27:16] [laughter]
[1:27:23] They had just spent with him two hours
[1:27:24] ago.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you a question.
[1:27:31] The Jesus that was with the disciples
[1:27:33] before they got in the boat, did he look
[1:27:35] any different when he was on the water?
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; I I'll answer that for you. Nope.
[1:27:46] But they were afraid because their God
[1:27:49] that they believed them couldn't walk on
[1:27:51] water.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Not in their mind.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; In their mind, they said, "Well, God can
[1:27:57] do this and this and this and this, but
[1:27:59] he can't walk on water."
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; And so, as soon as they seen him walking
[1:28:03] on water, whoa, that must be a ghost.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; So, I started to tell you a testimony.
[1:28:10] So, you know, you know, we have a few
[1:28:13] bills that come in in the church, you
[1:28:15] know, like we pay the light bill and,
[1:28:17] you know, few little things like that.
[1:28:19] And the the income was about half of
[1:28:22] what it was a year ago.
[1:28:24] And so when there wasn't no money in the
[1:28:26] church, Lan got it out of our bank
[1:28:28] account.
[1:28:31] And you know, I thought about that some
[1:28:35] because you know, Brother Brown said, he
[1:28:37] said, "God, when you split quit paying
[1:28:40] my bills, I quit preaching."
[1:28:44] That's what he said.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; You know, I said that to some preachers
[1:28:46] in Africa and they never seen those
[1:28:47] quotes before. Brother Brham said, "The
[1:28:50] day you quit paying the bills, I stop
[1:28:53] preaching."
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; You know what? I don't have to preach.
[1:28:57] I'm quite fine not preaching.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; I I don't I don't preach cuz I have low
[1:29:02] self-esteem or I need like you know
[1:29:05] something to do on Sunday or
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; and we were here putting up the lights.
[1:29:10] Remember I started back at the lights. I
[1:29:12] got sidetracked but we're back at the
[1:29:14] lights. My little phone went ding ding
[1:29:16] ding ding ding ding ding ding.
[1:29:19] And I was like halfway in the light
[1:29:22] mode.
[1:29:24] And so I never answered it.
[1:29:28] And then after a little bit, Lann's
[1:29:29] phone went ding ding ding ding ding ding
[1:29:31] ding ding ding. And she answered it cuz
[1:29:34] she wasn't sitting on the ladder holding
[1:29:35] the lights like this.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; And it was somebody four and a half to 5
[1:29:42] hours away.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; And they said, you know, we haven't had
[1:29:46] a pastor since March.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; We got a whole bunch of tithes and
[1:29:51] offerings to send out.
[1:29:55] Do you got an email that we can send it
[1:29:58] to your church?
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; See, the Bible says this. When the
[1:30:05] disciples came to Jesus and they stopped
[1:30:07] the people from worshiping Jesus, he
[1:30:10] said, "If it's of God,
[1:30:13] you don't want to be fighting against
[1:30:14] it."
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; But if it's not of God, you don't have
[1:30:17] to worry. They'll close the doors.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; So, you know what? Like if you don't
[1:30:22] want to pay the bills here,
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; God will have somebody from five hours
[1:30:25] away.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; The week before the end of the year when
[1:30:28] I'm here putting up lights that we
[1:30:29] bought from camp,
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; he jump
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; the last I probably haven't seen that
[1:30:34] person in six to eight months. Probably
[1:30:36] about 8 months. And before that, I
[1:30:38] probably hadn't seen him for two or
[1:30:39] three years.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Well, if I seen him once a year, that
[1:30:44] would be max.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; You see, I'm I'm preaching on fear.
[1:30:51] Yeah. Yeah.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; If you're in God's will,
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; you what?
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; What's What's the problem?
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; And if you're not, you have a right to
[1:31:01] be fearful.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; You see,
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; see, it don't matter to me if God pays
[1:31:18] the bills. It don't matter to me if I go
[1:31:21] to the mission field. If you think I go
[1:31:24] to the mission field and I get there to
[1:31:26] Uganda, I got there about 4:00 in the
[1:31:28] morning, 3 4:00 in the morning and and
[1:31:30] and got up that morning. They they
[1:31:33] knocked on my door at 7:00. I think I
[1:31:35] got 2 to three hours sleep and we had
[1:31:37] four services that day and I preached
[1:31:39] the second service. If you think that
[1:31:41] was a holiday,
[1:31:43] well, you you need counseling
[1:31:46] because uh
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; you know, like when when we went to O
[1:31:50] Salvador, I just I'm not bragging. I'm
[1:31:52] just saying if God's in it. See, see,
[1:31:53] when we went to O Salvador, we got there
[1:31:56] in the middle of the night on Well, we
[1:31:59] got there Wednesday morning,
[1:32:01] like 2 3 4 Wednesday mornings. I
[1:32:04] preached Wednesday night locally. Five p
[1:32:06] some pastors came from the capital over
[1:32:08] two hours away on a Wednesday night.
[1:32:10] distance didn't mean nothing to them cuz
[1:32:12] they're in love with God. Now, they only
[1:32:13] make $25 a day, but they're in love.
[1:32:16] See, they're not fearful. And
[1:32:19] so, the local pastor, he asked me to
[1:32:21] preach in the country. I'm thinking,
[1:32:24] "Oh, boys. We're going to Nicaragua at
[1:32:27] we have to get up at 3:00 a.m. to leave
[1:32:29] at 4:00 a.m. to go about a 6-hour drive.
[1:32:32] We were 2 hours in customs.
[1:32:35] Two hours. We never had a chair.
[1:32:40] There were two hours seeing if they
[1:32:42] should let us in or not into Nicaragua.
[1:32:47] And I got to and and you know what I
[1:32:49] told God? I said, "God,
[1:32:51] I'd had an experience in the Philippines
[1:32:53] and God whooped me because I turned down
[1:32:55] somebody preaching."
[1:32:59] And I told the pastor in the country, I
[1:33:00] said, "I'll go." I preached Thursday
[1:33:02] night. Do you know Thursday night? It
[1:33:04] wasn't even their regular service. They
[1:33:06] put up tables out in the parking lot,
[1:33:08] Sister Patty. They had those lights like
[1:33:10] string to the trees and that. They have
[1:33:12] no bugs there. And the middle of the
[1:33:14] night and they served a full course meal
[1:33:16] at 1000 p.m. on Thursday night. I'm
[1:33:19] getting up at 3:00 a.m. to go to
[1:33:21] Nicaragua.
[1:33:25] I went to Nicaragua. We got there Friday
[1:33:29] afternoon. I preach Friday night,
[1:33:30] Saturday night, twice on Sunday. I tell
[1:33:32] you what, I slept really good Sunday
[1:33:34] night.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:37] I'm just saying that. But see, God has
[1:33:40] to provide.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; And see, it's not because we're do. If
[1:33:44] God don't want to provide, then God
[1:33:45] don't want you doing it.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; See, when you're weak, God makes you
[1:33:50] strong.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; When you're broke, God makes you rich.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; When you're sick, God makes you healthy.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; But there's one thing that'll come in
[1:33:59] the way with that. Fear.
[1:34:04] If you think that you have to help God
[1:34:07] because you're fearful, you'll mess
[1:34:09] everything up.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Fear.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:20] Let's finish this quote.
[1:34:23] for God work. When God works through the
[1:34:24] pastor and through the board down in the
[1:34:27] church and all together are all in
[1:34:31] united in the kingdom of God, then God
[1:34:34] will hear. Then God will hear. And when
[1:34:38] we're unified in a group, then nothing
[1:34:42] then nothing can bother you. Don't be
[1:34:45] dismayed
[1:34:47] at anything.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Timothy and we're we're just
[1:34:52] going to go a little bit and and uh
[1:34:56] here 1 Timothy 1:6. Therefore, put thee
[1:35:00] in remembrance that I stir up the gift
[1:35:03] of God
[1:35:04] which is in thee by putting on of h of
[1:35:07] of hand putting on of my hands. And
[1:35:10] verse seven, for God has not given us
[1:35:14] the spirit of fear. So if you're afraid,
[1:35:18] where'd it come from?
[1:35:27] but of power
[1:35:29] and love and a sound mind.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Be not thou therefore ashamed of
[1:35:38] the testimony of the Lord. Now, you know
[1:35:40] what? When you put on a Bible scripture
[1:35:43] or Bible prophecy, like I I want to show
[1:35:46] you something. I put on I put on a
[1:35:48] little post of what happened yesterday
[1:35:50] morning and I put on this is Revelations
[1:35:53] 13 and I put the verses the dragon given
[1:35:57] power to the beast. You know how many
[1:35:58] Americans liked it?
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; One.
[1:36:03] Is there no message Americans?
[1:36:06] No. They don't want to admit that their
[1:36:07] country is evil.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Every country is evil.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They did in the third world
[1:36:16] countries. They did from Africa. They
[1:36:19] did from Central America. One American
[1:36:21] did. And he said, "Oh boy, is that ever
[1:36:23] true."
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; You know, the prophet said the the
[1:36:26] America was Revelation 13.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; That's the Antichrist. [screaming]
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:36:42] Be not ashamed
[1:36:45] of the testimony of the Lord,
[1:36:48] nor of me a prisoner, his prisoner, but
[1:36:52] be thou partakers of the afflictions of
[1:36:55] the gospel according to the power of
[1:36:57] God. Most people take the easy road. You
[1:37:00] know why most of you wouldn't go visit
[1:37:02] poor people? It's because it's
[1:37:04] afflictions.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; If it's hard, not going to do it.
[1:37:11] Well, you might not be called to it, and
[1:37:12] I understand you got families or jobs,
[1:37:14] but do you see what I'm saying?
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; You know why you have you'll have
[1:37:18] certain ministry? I I've had ministry
[1:37:20] right here, and I would ask them about
[1:37:22] going to other countries to preach where
[1:37:24] they got nothing to preach. Oh, no. I'm
[1:37:26] not called to leave outside the states.
[1:37:29] Uh what's it say? The gospel according
[1:37:32] to uh wait and be thou partakers of the
[1:37:35] afflictions.
[1:37:37] When you see a minister that's not
[1:37:40] willing to leave his home country
[1:37:43] for the gospel of Christ, don't invite
[1:37:45] him here.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Don't invite him here.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; He ain't got nothing I want.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; If you're not willing to be partakers of
[1:37:59] the affliction of Christ and not be
[1:38:01] ashamed, I don't want you behind this
[1:38:03] pulpit.
[1:38:09] Isaiah 44 or 41, sorry, 10 and 13. Fear
[1:38:13] thou not, for I am with thee. Be not
[1:38:16] dismayed, for I am thy God. I will
[1:38:17] strengthen thee. Yay, I will help thee,
[1:38:20] and I will uphold thee with the right
[1:38:22] hand of my righteousness. For I, the
[1:38:26] Lord thy God, will uphold thee, thy
[1:38:28] right hand, and say unto thee, Fear thou
[1:38:31] not. Fear not, for I will help thee.
[1:38:39] My goodness, aren't these amazing
[1:38:42] scriptures?
[1:38:44] Amazing scriptures. How How could we be
[1:38:46] in a state of fearfulness?
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 43 1 and two. But now, thus
[1:38:58] sayaith the Lord that created thee, oh
[1:39:00] Jacob, and formed thee, O Israel. Oh, I
[1:39:02] I've already read this one. I got that
[1:39:04] double. Praise God for that. Let's go to
[1:39:08] Joshua 1, and we'll close on this this
[1:39:11] example in the Bible.
[1:39:16] Amen. [clears throat] Joshua 1
[1:39:20] 1:3 and 5-7.
[1:39:24] Here God was telling Joshua
[1:39:27] not to fear.
[1:39:29] And here in one he said now after the
[1:39:31] death of Moses my servant the Lord came
[1:39:33] to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua
[1:39:35] the son of Nun. Moses minister saying
[1:39:38] Moses my servant
[1:39:41] is dead.
[1:39:44] Now therefore arise.
[1:39:46] You can't sit still.
[1:39:49] God can't use anybody that ain't moving
[1:39:51] for him. and go over Jordan, thou and
[1:39:54] all this people unto the land which I
[1:39:57] will give thee, even to the children of
[1:40:00] Israel. And verse three, and every place
[1:40:02] that the soul of thy feet tread, I have
[1:40:05] given to unto thee, as I said unto
[1:40:10] Moses. In verse five, we're going to
[1:40:12] drop to verse five.
[1:40:14] [snorts]
[1:40:14] And this here scripture is perfect for
[1:40:17] us and you today.
[1:40:22] In whatever state you find yourself in,
[1:40:26] there shall not any man,
[1:40:32] that's quite a few.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; There shall not any man, how many did I
[1:40:37] leave out,
[1:40:39] be able to stand before thee all the
[1:40:41] days of thy life?
[1:40:43] But you're afraid.
[1:40:47] As I was with Moses, so I will be with
[1:40:50] thee.
[1:40:52] I will not fail thee, nor will I forsake
[1:40:54] thee. Be strong and of good courage.
[1:41:00] For unto this people shalt thou divide
[1:41:03] the inheritance of the land which I
[1:41:05] swear unto their fathers to give thee.
[1:41:07] Now here he's bringing it up again about
[1:41:10] fear. Verse seven. And only thou be
[1:41:14] strong
[1:41:16] and very fearful.
[1:41:19] Oh, no. It didn't say fearful.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Be very courageous. Now, he's already
[1:41:25] told him that three times.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; That thou may observe according to all
[1:41:30] the law that which Moses thy servant
[1:41:32] commanded thee, and turn not from the
[1:41:34] right, nor the left, that thou may
[1:41:36] prosper whethersoever thou goest.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; And verse nine,
[1:41:42] this is the climax of fear. We're going
[1:41:44] to close on this verse.
[1:41:52] Have I not commanded thee?
[1:41:55] Did not Jesus put in the Bible, fear
[1:41:57] not, 365 times. Every day you do your
[1:42:01] devotions, you could go, fear not. I'm
[1:42:04] not sure how the day is going to go.
[1:42:05] Fear not. I I I'm not sure I can do
[1:42:07] homeschooling one more day. Fear not.
[1:42:11] I'm not sure how I'm going to pay the
[1:42:12] bills the end of the month. Fear not.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:19] Have I not I commanded thee? Be strong
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; and of good courage,
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; and be not afraid, neither be thou
[1:42:27] dismayed.
[1:42:30] Now, if you weren't supposed to be
[1:42:32] dismayed, how could you be fearful?
[1:42:36] For the Lord thy God is with thee,
[1:42:40] whethersoever
[1:42:44] thou goest.
[1:42:49] That means
[1:42:52] anywhere that you would travel to go
[1:42:54] into all the world and preach the
[1:42:55] gospel.
[1:42:57] Even
[1:42:59] everybody watch this. Everybody has a
[1:43:02] ministry. Not behind the pulpit, but
[1:43:05] everybody has a ministry. Remember
[1:43:07] brother Brown said that the mother could
[1:43:10] be the fifth gospel.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Mothers are to teach their children.
[1:43:14] raise up your children the way they
[1:43:16] would go. Do you know when my wife goes
[1:43:18] to the mission field, the sisters will
[1:43:19] ask her questions that nothing to do
[1:43:22] with the ministry?
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Does the Bible not say for the
[1:43:26] older women to teach the younger women?
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's not a ministry.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; No. No. We just put it all on one little
[1:43:34] priest behind the pulpit.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; The older women to teach the younger
[1:43:38] women.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Sounds like a ministry to me.
[1:43:46] Amen.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Wow. God help us.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; God help us to to come in contact with
[1:43:54] the pillar of fire. You know, I have at
[1:43:56] least two more examples in here. Three
[1:43:59] maybe.
[1:44:02] You know something I found out in the
[1:44:04] Bible is it just goes and goes and goes
[1:44:07] and goes. Every time you read it and
[1:44:10] study it, it just unfolds and gets
[1:44:11] bigger and bigger and there's more and
[1:44:14] more and more and more.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; God's telling his church says, "Fear
[1:44:18] not."
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; You don't have to fear, for he's the
[1:44:22] alpha and omega, the beginning and the
[1:44:24] end. When he came down in Revelations
[1:44:26] and he put one foot on the land and one
[1:44:28] on the sea, that was Jehovah.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; And he's saying, "I'm the boss of the
[1:44:33] sea and I'm the boss of the land."
[1:44:39] I'm the beginning and the end.
[1:44:42] He's all of it. Amen.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God is good. Very good.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; All the time. Amen.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I believe we're going to
[1:44:55] move communion
[1:44:59] to next week because the pastor was
[1:45:01] long- winded
[1:45:03] and uh very uh long- winded. It's almost
[1:45:07] 12:00. Soon will be. Amen. I believe
[1:45:11] we'll we'll just plan on communion next
[1:45:13] week regardless of the weather. Let's
[1:45:17] put it this way. We'll even set the
[1:45:18] communion up.
[1:45:21] Amen. cuz we've been playing with the
[1:45:24] weather for three weeks now. Amen. Still

[1:45:53] witnessing for Jesus and how the people
[1:45:55] might turn you down.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Because because you're a part of him,
[1:46:01] you know, you're you're not afraid of
[1:46:03] getting in the road and driving, you
[1:46:05] know, because you're God's.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Nothing can, you know, in Job say, you
[1:46:10] know, God said to to Satan, he said,
[1:46:12] "You can go this far."
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; You can you watch this. I I want to You

[1:46:52] but you got you got this around." And
[1:46:53] and God, this what this this is my final
[1:46:56] point of fear. God said, "You can go
[1:46:59] this far."
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

[1:59:28] may every soul
[1:59:31] here represented
[1:59:33] experience this communion with you, Lord
[1:59:36] God.
[1:59:38] Lord, we won't be afraid of who's in
[1:59:42] government or who's in power or what
[1:59:45] country we live in or where we travel
[1:59:48] [music]
[1:59:49] because there's one country.
[1:59:52] There's one kingdom
[1:59:55] that you're the King of Kings
[1:59:59] and you're the Lord of Lords and every
[2:00:01] knee,
[2:00:03] every government will crumble except
[2:00:06] your government. Every knee will bow
[2:00:10] and every tongue will confess. Even the
[2:00:12] ones that don't talk too clearly [music]
[2:00:15] are going to confess that there's one
[2:00:17] Jehovah Gyra. [music]
[2:00:20] There's one kingdom
[2:00:24] that all the others have to get their
[2:00:26] permission.
[2:00:29] Is it okay if I do this, God?
[2:00:32] God says, "You can go that far.
[2:00:36] I'll let you go that far, Satan.
[2:00:40] But don't you touch the oil and the
[2:00:42] wine.
[2:00:45] Don't you touch the anointed of God.
[2:00:47] [music]
[2:00:50] Oh, blessed be your name, Lord Jesus.
[2:00:53] Thank you. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:00:56] Thank you for the fellowship that we
[2:00:57] have in you and each other, Lord God.
[2:01:00] Lord, still even in myself rejoicing of
[2:01:03] the testimony sister Margaret told us
[2:01:05] about the lady in Uganda. Lord God, just
[2:01:09] supernatural
[2:01:10] like sister Nolma's testimony.
[2:01:12] Supernatural
[2:01:15] supernatural.
[2:01:17] [music]
[2:01:20] Hallelujah.
[2:01:22] Blessed be your name, Jesus.
[2:01:26] Oh God, please come. May this be the
[2:01:28] year that you'll just overflow us
[2:01:32] [music]
[2:01:33] and be in our midst and we'll come for
[2:01:35] one purpose and one desire is to see
[2:01:39] Christ. It won't matter who's here as
[2:01:42] Christ is here and his power and and
[2:01:44] demonstration.
[2:01:48] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. [music]
[2:01:50] Thank you for the opportunity
[2:01:53] to be one of your children to serve you
[2:01:56] on this earth. [music]
[2:01:58] Bless all the ones, especially the ones
[2:02:00] that drove so far. Bless them. Meet
[2:02:04] every need here represented. Lord God,
[2:02:06] we're still living in this world.
[2:02:08] [music]
[2:02:10] Hallelujah.
[2:02:12] Bless your bride, Lord Jesus. We pray.
