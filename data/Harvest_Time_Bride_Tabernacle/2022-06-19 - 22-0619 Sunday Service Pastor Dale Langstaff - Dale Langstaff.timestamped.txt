[27:34] amen
[27:36] amen when we close i want to sing what a
[27:38] day that'll be
[27:40] amy you can pull that up
[27:43] thank you musicians
[27:45] i was uh
[27:47] this week i was singing that
[27:52] started singing that song
[27:56] wow
[27:58] you know our
[28:00] excuse me
[28:08] goddess said
[28:10] to worship you had to get in the spirit
[28:13] so when people go to a ball game
[28:15] they get in the spirit of the ball game
[28:19] the problem you know john
[28:21] said that in the bible i was in the
[28:23] spirit
[28:24] in the lord's day you don't get nothing
[28:26] at a church it's not your brother's
[28:28] sister's fault
[28:29] it definitely ain't god's fault
[28:32] and it probably ain't the minister's
[28:33] fault either
[28:35] because you weren't in the spirit
[28:37] you were present but your mind was
[28:39] somewhere else
[28:41] amen god's so amazing we just welcome
[28:44] all our fathers
[28:46] and dads in us an awesome way it'd be
[28:48] nice to get a picture of us four dads
[28:50] here
[28:51] today
[28:53] and we talked to brother jim yesterday
[28:55] he's
[28:56] totally here he was actually planning on
[28:59] being here and sister linda's sister
[29:01] went back to london either on friday or
[29:03] saturday and he said i'm not he said
[29:05] she's going to be gone for a week and he
[29:06] says i don't know if i can come next
[29:08] sunday but
[29:09] he's here with us he's he's watching the
[29:13] services and
[29:14] and uh he's
[29:17] man he's one of us and then it's also
[29:20] brother junior and just
[29:22] so if we can get him a car he could come
[29:24] i think he said every other sunday he
[29:26] works and
[29:28] but just
[29:30] you know there's more present
[29:33] of course we have all the angels of
[29:34] heaven with us
[29:36] amen and we thank god for that amen
[29:40] amen we just want to read a couple of
[29:42] scriptures and kind of continue on the
[29:44] same theme and
[29:45] just see where god takes us talking
[29:49] about fathers also and and uh
[29:52] just uh
[29:55] see what you know i want to i want to
[29:56] put something out before we start though
[29:59] i want you to remember this when we're
[30:01] preaching
[30:02] remember
[30:04] satan
[30:05] believed the word
[30:10] but satan twisted the word
[30:14] just one word
[30:16] man
[30:17] and so anytime you see
[30:19] and
[30:20] anytime you see somebody
[30:22] that wants to take one part
[30:25] our prophet brother branham
[30:29] said the middle of the road was where we
[30:31] used to be
[30:33] our prophet the same vindicated prophet
[30:35] that you read in the one quote
[30:37] i have people this week send me lots of
[30:39] quote i believe every one of them
[30:41] they don't want to see the quotes i say
[30:43] from the same prophet
[30:48] see
[30:49] amen you and man god dovetails it
[30:52] beautifully
[30:53] this word
[30:54] dovetails are beautiful satan quoted the
[30:57] word thief
[31:01] amen hallelujah thank you lord let's
[31:03] turn to first john 3
[31:05] first john 3
[31:09] 16.
[31:11] first john 3
[31:13] 16 and just uh
[31:15] just i've really enjoyed uh you know
[31:18] when we ministered on i
[31:19] uh you know last couple weeks ago and
[31:22] it was just fantastic first john 3
[31:26] hereby perceive we the love of god
[31:29] that he laid down his life and we ought
[31:32] to
[31:33] lay down our lives
[31:36] for the brethren see if you have the
[31:38] same characteristics of christ
[31:42] you'll be like your father
[31:44] hereby perceive with the love of god
[31:46] that he lay down his life for us
[31:49] and we ought to also
[31:51] lay down our lives for the brethren
[31:54] so whosoever seeth has of this world's
[31:57] good and see us this brother in need and
[31:59] shut us up his mouths of compassion how
[32:02] dwelleth
[32:03] the love of god
[32:05] in him
[32:09] let us little children let us not love
[32:11] in word
[32:13] neither in tongue
[32:15] but in deed
[32:17] and in truth
[32:19] man your testimony
[32:21] needs to be more
[32:23] than just what you say
[32:25] hallelujah just i want to read uh
[32:28] another scripture matthew 25 before you
[32:30] see that matthew 25 and 31 now we were
[32:33] preaching on i never knew you
[32:36] and that's in matthew also in matthew uh
[32:39] last sunday we or two sundays ago we
[32:40] preached on matthew 27 23
[32:44] where jesus said
[32:45] depart from me i never knew you and that
[32:48] just says encount me and that spirit has
[32:51] encountered me
[32:52] of how believers have got to heaven and
[32:56] they were believers they see they were
[32:57] all virgins remember the 10 virgins they
[33:00] were all pure
[33:02] they were all virgins they were all
[33:04] sanctified
[33:07] five never had oil
[33:10] but they didn't recognize that they
[33:11] didn't have oil until the groom
[33:14] the time of the groom was coming you
[33:16] know we're at the end time we believe
[33:17] we're at the end of la rocia and and you
[33:20] see crop
[33:22] you can tell it when it's in maturity
[33:25] everything like this is the end of all
[33:27] the ages wrapped up right now
[33:29] and so we're seeing i mean because god
[33:32] sent us of indicate a prophet because
[33:34] the the the word has completely been
[33:36] been unveiled and unsealed and and you
[33:39] see you see the revelation of the word
[33:41] but you see the revelations of
[33:43] everything you see the revelation of
[33:45] satan's family and god's family on earth
[33:48] because it's coming to maturity
[33:51] remember the story in the bible where he
[33:52] talked about the man that went forth
[33:54] with the tires
[33:55] they said well we pulled him up as soon
[33:57] as he said no no no no no because you'll
[33:59] kill the believers
[34:01] but wait until the harvest
[34:04] we're at the harvest
[34:05] and he said then we'll take the
[34:06] terrorists and we'll burn them first
[34:09] and then we'll take the believers
[34:11] and we'll put them in the palace
[34:13] amen hallelujah matthew 25 and 31
[34:17] and the son of man shall come in his
[34:18] glory and all the holy angels with him
[34:21] when they shall sit upon the throne of
[34:23] his glory and before him shall he gather
[34:26] all the nations and shall separate them
[34:28] one from another
[34:30] so god's a separator
[34:32] if if we wanted to fill this place we
[34:34] could actually fill it
[34:36] but it wouldn't be separated i mean
[34:38] god's a separator it don't feel nice but
[34:41] it's
[34:42] we're not separators
[34:44] god's is
[34:45] god's words are separated
[34:47] amen remember that when the 70 got up
[34:49] and walked out on jesus he says 12 will
[34:51] you go also he never went after the 70.
[34:54] he intended
[34:57] he knew by predestination that they
[34:59] would get up and leave
[35:00] and before him gathered all the nations
[35:03] and he separated
[35:06] separated
[35:08] this is jesus talking by the way
[35:10] jesus separates
[35:11] them one from another the sheep divided
[35:14] he
[35:16] from the goats
[35:18] now how could god
[35:19] tell the difference
[35:21] from sheep to goats now i want you to
[35:23] keep this in your mind depart from me
[35:25] you workers of iniquity i don't know who
[35:28] you are
[35:30] no see they were in the same herd
[35:33] they they thought they were believers
[35:35] because they said god you know we've
[35:37] done miracles for many great signs
[35:38] preached and cast out demons and devils
[35:40] and see the anointings here reigns on
[35:42] the just and the unjust when god sends
[35:44] rain the wicked people get it too
[35:47] matt
[35:49] hallelujah i can't see that that light
[35:51] went funny
[35:53] uh 30
[35:54] 33 yeah there we go
[35:56] my prince and he shall set before the
[35:59] sheep on his right hand but the goats on
[36:02] his left now remember where the angel of
[36:04] the lord came to our prophet
[36:06] his right side hallelujah
[36:09] then shall the king say unto them on his
[36:12] right hand come and be blessed of
[36:15] of my father and inherit the kingdom
[36:18] inherit the kingdom of heaven prepared
[36:19] for you from the foundation
[36:22] that's a key part
[36:23] he knew who that would be
[36:25] the foundation of the world
[36:28] hallelujah
[36:29] for i was hungry
[36:33] now wait a minute i want to show you
[36:34] something here he's not saying
[36:37] i picked you up because you had long
[36:39] hair
[36:41] he said i'm not picking you out
[36:43] because what close your head on
[36:45] i said i'm not picking you out because
[36:47] how many times you went to church
[36:49] he said i'm not picking you out
[36:51] because of
[36:53] all these other things and we do believe
[36:55] them
[36:59] but he said i was hungry and you gave me
[37:01] me and he said i was thirsty and you
[37:03] gave me drink and he said i was a
[37:05] stranger and you took me
[37:06] in wow
[37:08] naked
[37:10] and ye clothed me and i was sick and you
[37:12] visited me and in prison i was in prison
[37:16] and you came
[37:18] unto me
[37:19] hallelujah remember the story of paul
[37:21] we're going to stop right there when god
[37:22] came down and woke paul up with that
[37:25] life
[37:26] he said who are you
[37:27] lord
[37:31] and the lord wasn't present in the flesh
[37:33] at that time
[37:34] he said i am jesus
[37:37] whom you're persecuting
[37:39] but jesus was not present
[37:42] but jesus didn't lie
[37:46] negan okay uh
[37:49] we got that one next one
[37:51] on my eyes i'm not being able to read my
[37:53] sheet and then show the righteous answer
[37:55] and say unto him lord when we when did
[37:58] we see thee
[38:00] i don't remember recognizing you this
[38:02] morning jesus
[38:04] and when did we
[38:08] and when did we
[38:12] next verse
[38:16] he said when
[38:20] saw we the a stranger and when did we
[38:22] take the end or naked and clothe thee
[38:25] when did we see you lord we i didn't
[38:27] recognize you lord
[38:29] no these are believers but they didn't
[38:31] recognize the lord
[38:33] or when do we saw these sick or in
[38:35] prison like lord we didn't recognize you
[38:39] and the king shall answer and say unto
[38:41] them barely barely i say unto you and so
[38:43] much as ye have done it unto one of the
[38:47] least of these my brethren
[38:49] ye have done it
[38:52] unto me
[38:57] then shall he say unto them that are on
[38:59] the left hand depart from me you curse
[39:01] it
[39:02] unto everlasting fire prepared for the
[39:05] devil
[39:06] and his angels it wasn't even prepared
[39:08] for them just the devil and his angels
[39:10] next verse
[39:13] for i was hungry
[39:15] and you gave me no meat i was thirsty
[39:17] and you gave me no drink
[39:21] when i was a stranger and you took me
[39:23] not in and i was naked and you closed me
[39:26] not and i was sick and i was in prison
[39:27] and you didn't visit me then shall also
[39:30] he answer and say unto the lamb lord
[39:33] when saw we
[39:34] and when were you hungry or a thirst or
[39:37] a stranger nagged or sick or in prison
[39:39] because and we did not minister unto
[39:41] them
[39:44] and when he shall answer and say unto
[39:46] them verily i say unto you and so as
[39:49] much as ye did it
[39:52] not
[39:54] the one of the least of these
[39:56] you did it not
[39:59] to me
[40:01] hallelujah you may have your seats
[40:04] amen lord jesus we ask you to just come
[40:07] and minister your truth this morning
[40:09] lord
[40:10] in a special way and we give you all the
[40:12] glory and all the honor
[40:14] and praise
[40:15] your beautiful name
[40:17] amen
[40:18] amen girls i forgot to show the pictures
[40:21] and i really want to show them so let's
[40:22] uh
[40:23] put them up we're just i'm sorry
[40:27] just
[40:29] this is all part of worship
[40:32] all part of the
[40:33] plan of god
[40:36] man i just
[40:37] miss uh
[40:39] went right into speaking amen
[40:41] this is a huge
[40:43] huge
[40:44] huge testimony
[40:46] if you give a penny to this church
[40:49] uh nine times out of ten it probably got
[40:52] sent
[40:53] on
[40:54] amen
[40:56] a large percentage anyway
[40:58] and uh this is pastor leo's church
[41:01] it's completely finished except for a
[41:04] few windows and doors
[41:06] and it's uh really stirring satan up
[41:09] over there
[41:10] you know the pentecostal churches used
[41:12] to tell leo they said you know if you
[41:14] got the truth how come you don't have a
[41:17] vehicle
[41:18] how come you got to ride a motorcycle in
[41:19] the rain like you got everything but you
[41:21] don't have no god your god don't provide
[41:24] for you
[41:25] and you know
[41:26] that same devil told them things like
[41:28] when they did the foundation they said
[41:30] you will not live long enough to see
[41:31] this building finished you know because
[41:34] your god isn't big enough
[41:37] but that same devil is kind of excited
[41:40] now
[41:41] because the pentecostal church is just
[41:42] around the corner
[41:44] and they might get cleaned out
[41:46] you can uh turn the page
[41:49] uh
[41:52] picture
[41:54] yep yep there we go
[41:57] beautiful
[41:58] that's a testimony to almighty god
[42:02] one of the poorest countries
[42:05] close to one of the poorest countries
[42:06] probably in the world
[42:08] you you i feel like you questioned me on
[42:10] that one dollar of yours
[42:12] is
[42:14] 28
[42:16] 3 800
[42:18] of theirs
[42:19] so if you have 250 dollars you have a
[42:21] million you're a millionaire
[42:23] in uganda
[42:26] amen
[42:29] pastor leo said they're going to be
[42:30] that's the end yep we go there that's
[42:32] the inside
[42:34] he said we're going to really have a
[42:35] time
[42:37] this sunday
[42:42] can you imagine
[42:45] to god be the glory
[42:48] okay this is a church that brick
[42:50] building on your right
[42:52] is uh we that's long dong in the
[42:54] philippines and when we preach there it
[42:57] was all bamboo and and uh straw ceiling
[43:00] and it blew down after me and luanne and
[43:03] amy were there
[43:05] and so we built that about eight years
[43:07] ago or so
[43:08] um and then he put a parsonage on beside
[43:11] it and he's probably been asking me for
[43:13] two years for a roof for the parsonage
[43:16] and so you can go
[43:18] there's the the green roof showing
[43:20] beside the black building
[43:22] so i sent him some money and it was half
[43:25] the roof
[43:26] and uh
[43:27] so i i told him i said uh he had sent me
[43:30] some pictures you can show more there
[43:32] vicky oh that's my
[43:34] my daddy
[43:35] um
[43:37] hey man yeah
[43:38] you see the the
[43:40] trees there just uh beautiful one of the
[43:42] prettiest islands in the philippines
[43:44] that's where all the pineapple come from
[43:46] and
[43:47] it's just an amazing place but god bless
[43:49] them
[43:50] we'll continue to finish the steel roof
[43:52] there and
[43:53] just thank you for all your love to
[43:56] pastor leo and they certainly
[43:59] are part of the family of god amen
[44:02] amen so back to our scripture and our
[44:04] thought where we were going in matthew
[44:06] matthew 7 and 23 he said here here's the
[44:10] people came to the judgment and they
[44:12] were planning on going into heaven and
[44:14] god didn't know them and then in the
[44:16] exact same book
[44:19] matthew we see just farther down god
[44:22] himself is judging
[44:24] how people he separated on the judgment
[44:28] and our prophet preached a message on
[44:30] that day at calvary and we might even
[44:32] play a short clip of it and i have many
[44:34] many many quotes from it and that but he
[44:36] said see god is our father and he said
[44:39] he was the greatest giver
[44:41] of all
[44:42] amen now we're not we're not saying
[44:45] giving
[44:47] largely may not be your your your money
[44:50] you know it's harder to give help or
[44:52] time than it is money
[44:54] especially here
[44:55] people in our country they gladly give
[44:57] you some money but don't ask them to do
[44:59] anything
[45:01] because well i'm really busy amen
[45:05] but don't be too busy
[45:07] for god
[45:09] amen and you see us as fathers on
[45:12] father's day and this time we see that
[45:14] our example is our heavenly father amen
[45:18] and we shouldn't just be as fathers we
[45:20] shouldn't just be dictators and and and
[45:23] put everything out see when god
[45:25] willingly wanted something done right
[45:30] he came himself
[45:31] when god himself came to abraham in the
[45:34] form of the three angels
[45:37] not that god was three but when the
[45:38] three angels came and and one of them
[45:40] was god himself
[45:42] he came down himself
[45:44] because this covenant was too important
[45:46] to be lost
[45:48] and here the bride of christ today god
[45:51] has come down god bless you brother fred
[45:53] welcome
[45:55] god has come down again himself
[45:58] and see here you know the bible talks
[46:00] about and let me just find it here in
[46:02] genesis 3 15 he said here here's god
[46:05] himself when in the fall of the garden
[46:07] and eve and satan the serpent and he
[46:10] said here he said he said
[46:12] after all these terrible things that
[46:13] happened god came and he was judging
[46:16] them and he said in in genesis 3 15 he
[46:19] said i will put enmity
[46:22] between thy seed
[46:25] and the serpent seed and it goes on and
[46:27] says and he'll bruise your heel and
[46:29] bruise his head but see here it wasn't
[46:31] just talking in the flesh
[46:33] it wasn't just talking that there's
[46:34] seeds in the flesh with no more mix with
[46:36] human seed but it was talking
[46:38] spiritually see that was satan himself
[46:42] and god was going to come down himself
[46:44] and come through the seat of a woman in
[46:46] the form of jesus christ jehovah and
[46:50] jesus christ was going to bring forth a
[46:52] family called his bride amen and that
[46:55] was the beginning of that seed and god
[46:58] said my bride will never mix never mix
[47:01] the word we'll never touch
[47:05] with satan's seed it's a physical
[47:07] impossibility
[47:11] the blood
[47:12] is different
[47:16] oh that should just make you lose your
[47:18] mind worshiping god
[47:20] you just think of that and the greatest
[47:22] promise that a father has in his family
[47:24] is that your children are your heritage
[47:27] and a happy is a man whose quiver's full
[47:29] of them but you can claim your children
[47:31] see your your heritage where christ
[47:34] started the family and he came through
[47:36] the scene and here god spoke these great
[47:38] words he said
[47:40] i'm putting empathy it's impossible to
[47:43] mix
[47:44] that's the seed genesis is the seed
[47:46] chapter
[47:47] no one can break that beard
[47:49] that's good until eternity
[47:52] amen
[47:54] we're not saved by some perchance
[47:57] satan can't touch you if you ever get
[48:00] your hands on that you're going to start
[48:02] bossing him around
[48:04] back off
[48:06] hallelujah that's amazing but remember
[48:09] in that picture what we said at the
[48:10] beginning satan believed the word
[48:15] how it fit his agenda
[48:19] in his contacts
[48:21] and he'd just throw an hand in
[48:24] or a butt once in a while
[48:28] but god's children
[48:31] will take the word
[48:32] exactly how it's portrayed to them and
[48:35] you see here he said here christ left
[48:38] the splendor
[48:39] of heaven
[48:42] he knew exactly
[48:44] it was going to
[48:46] hurt wasn't just in the flesh but just
[48:50] to think he was the boss but he was
[48:52] going to take shame
[48:54] for someone else
[48:55] brother dale
[48:58] and maybe
[49:00] you see
[49:01] he took the shame and the sins of the
[49:03] world
[49:04] because he was a father made to give
[49:08] and he didn't question whether he maybe
[49:10] would give you know he didn't want to
[49:12] die in the flesh but god it wasn't like
[49:15] hard for him to give
[49:17] see the the our prophet said and we're
[49:19] going to read many quotes later on he
[49:20] said eternal life
[49:23] and he has this scripture to back him up
[49:27] eternal
[49:28] life is living for others
[49:33] i don't mean like we're going to take up
[49:34] an offering for anybody no i don't mean
[49:36] that it's holding the door at the
[49:38] grocery store it's smiling to the person
[49:40] that's having a rotten day
[49:42] it's paying for somebody's coffee and
[49:44] tim horton's line if you happen to go
[49:46] through there or just
[49:50] however god would lay it on
[49:52] you know you know when he just says oh
[49:54] there's some
[49:55] just in the most
[49:57] you know
[49:59] wow
[50:01] god always knows when the time is the
[50:04] greed is the greatest just a little
[50:06] speck
[50:07] will just push you over
[50:10] and that's what jesus did himself in
[50:12] that day in calvary where he gave
[50:14] everything he was the bible says that no
[50:16] greater love has any man
[50:20] to delay down his life
[50:23] for his brother
[50:25] amen
[50:27] so many times we're so busy or so caught
[50:30] up and and you know
[50:32] we think money will fix everything
[50:34] but god wants your time
[50:38] and your family wants your time
[50:41] and your kids
[50:42] they don't care about your money
[50:45] they want your time
[50:47] you know what good would it be and i i
[50:49] was thinking of this this morning just
[50:50] in meditation i said what good would it
[50:52] be and i see people you can drive around
[50:55] it's in my family and distant families
[50:56] and different ones people that worked
[50:58] their brains out
[51:00] and their sin their family all went to
[51:02] satan
[51:03] and their family squandered everything
[51:06] some of the families in distant back
[51:08] that had
[51:11] much
[51:12] there's no real estate
[51:15] in that family name
[51:18] you know he could have had much much
[51:20] less
[51:21] and had his family in the family of god
[51:24] and they've been much much see it's a
[51:26] paradox
[51:28] it's a paradox you say well what's a
[51:30] paradox well it's something that seems
[51:33] unreal
[51:34] but it's true now our prophet said
[51:36] things like this he said
[51:38] we are because we came from god
[51:43] and we're going back to god we are
[51:45] creators
[51:46] satan is never a creator
[51:48] amen and you know like we said from
[51:51] genesis jesus rose up this new
[51:53] generation
[51:55] that you know the the word of god is the
[51:58] original seed and it is beautiful in how
[52:01] god made us and and so here we see the
[52:03] prophet and i'm just paraphrasing this
[52:05] story but he come home the one time and
[52:07] because the prophet's life was so busy
[52:09] and god had called him to a great
[52:12] ministry and and all these things
[52:17] and people would come by the house and
[52:19] and everything was in an uproar he came
[52:21] home the one time and his wife was so
[52:23] frazzled
[52:25] she was crying in the house
[52:27] the kids had dropped the mitts and they
[52:28] were fighting in the house and things
[52:30] were wrecked and the prophet said he
[52:32] said i could have come in
[52:34] and start giving orders
[52:36] now this is on uh this is a
[52:40] right here i got it in front of me
[52:42] he said i could have come in and started
[52:44] dropping orders but he said don't you
[52:45] know
[52:46] that you came from the creator and you
[52:48] are a creator
[52:50] and he said i come in and he said i said
[52:52] oh honey he said you know we're called
[52:54] to a great work and he said he said i
[52:56] started catching her spirit like jesus
[52:59] did the woman at the well
[53:01] and he said i started coming in he said
[53:03] you know why don't we he said i seen a
[53:05] dress up town that was really nice and
[53:08] he said i think we got you know things
[53:10] that went our way and the boat came in
[53:12] and
[53:12] maybe we'll tomorrow go up and and he
[53:15] started
[53:16] uh
[53:17] and and all the time the prophet's
[53:19] telling this story he said i was praying
[53:20] to god he said god bring your spirit
[53:23] through me into my family all the time
[53:26] all the time it wasn't it wasn't a man
[53:28] made it wasn't manufactured he said all
[53:30] the time he said i'm praying he said my
[53:31] wife was nervous he said he said god
[53:33] help them catch my your spirit
[53:36] through me he was he was trying to be a
[53:38] vessel where god could bring that just a
[53:40] hush over and he said the next thing you
[53:41] know the kids had put their mitts back
[53:43] on and they were paying with the blocks
[53:45] on the floor and he said the most
[53:47] amazing thing
[53:49] that goes back to this scripture
[53:52] he said honey step aside and i'll wash
[53:54] the dishes
[53:55] today
[53:58] the prophet
[54:03] the prophet
[54:06] now you know he had
[54:08] other ministries
[54:14] but we see very clearly in our scripture
[54:18] that when you needed me
[54:21] those were the ones that god put in
[54:23] heaven
[54:25] amen
[54:28] you notice in that scripture it wasn't
[54:30] just that they asked for money
[54:32] they said when i was in prison did you
[54:35] visit me
[54:36] when i was sick did you go by and see
[54:38] them
[54:40] amen
[54:41] and he said you know
[54:42] when i was washing the dishes
[54:44] you know my honey started talking about
[54:47] going to town the next day
[54:49] the kids and he said the whole
[54:50] atmosphere
[54:54] changed
[54:57] it wasn't because of money
[54:59] it was just because of
[55:02] kindness
[55:04] just
[55:05] courtesy
[55:07] hold the door
[55:08] you look beautiful this morning
[55:11] just
[55:13] he said what's that mean
[55:15] you are saying it to the lord jesus
[55:18] if you're part of the family
[55:21] that's why
[55:22] you know the family can never fight
[55:25] against one another you know the prophet
[55:27] said he said if you're doing the
[55:28] fighting
[55:29] you're in god's way he can't do it for
[55:31] you
[55:33] the bible says vengeance is mine saith
[55:35] the lord
[55:36] amen
[55:38] god help us
[55:40] to be out of the way
[55:43] amen
[55:44] and be there
[55:45] for someone else
[55:47] you never will believe
[55:49] how great a reward is waiting
[55:52] for you
[55:53] i want to read some of these quotes long
[55:56] that day at calvary there's many quotes
[55:58] but i want to tell you another story
[56:00] here this was a pharmacist i have it
[56:03] it's in the absolute 63 now you remember
[56:06] this is actually after the seals was
[56:08] open great revealing of the word these
[56:10] are all
[56:11] open and free for anyone you know that's
[56:14] one thing you'll find with the believer
[56:15] is he's not misplacing quotes or
[56:18] all the quotes are for our benefit
[56:21] you know amen
[56:23] you know the prophet taught us that
[56:24] prophets weren't infallible god only
[56:26] tells us prophets what they need to know
[56:29] prophets don't know everything they know
[56:31] what god knows they need to know
[56:34] amen and you know it's just so amazing i
[56:37] want to i want to read something here
[56:39] this uh
[56:40] i seen a quote the other day people
[56:42] see this and i preached on this a while
[56:44] ago and i had
[56:45] many years ago actually
[56:48] and uh and i'm not preaching on this but
[56:50] it just you come to me and i had it i
[56:52] printed off and i preached on
[56:55] you know the prophet said everybody
[56:57] wants gifts in the church
[56:59] the prophet said the greatest gifts god
[57:00] ever give to the church was the
[57:02] five-fold ministry
[57:04] man
[57:05] the greatest gifts but they don't want
[57:06] those gifts they want other things see
[57:09] what see when you're the bride of christ
[57:11] in your family it's all the package
[57:15] man you can't pick and choose and here's
[57:17] an israel uh
[57:19] israel and the church
[57:21] and this is a quote from our prophet and
[57:22] he said well they say i don't i this is
[57:26] i'm not making this up
[57:29] see
[57:30] how it's
[57:32] it's of the devil it's what it is
[57:35] if you see somebody picking and choosing
[57:38] just remember the garden
[57:40] just remember the garden that's all you
[57:42] got to remember it's the garden
[57:44] amen
[57:45] he said while they say well i don't need
[57:47] anyone to teach me glory to god i got
[57:49] the holy ghost now
[57:52] he said well then the holy ghost must
[57:53] have been wrong when he set the fivefold
[57:56] ministry and teachers
[57:58] in the church
[58:00] well that's the same vindicated prophet
[58:02] all the other quotes people were sending
[58:03] me this week
[58:05] he said god put them in the church as
[58:07] teachers and that settles it and he said
[58:10] why did he put teachers there if the
[58:11] holy ghost was going to do all the
[58:13] teaching
[58:14] without the teachers
[58:20] oh i don't believe that one that was
[58:23] before this
[58:25] amen
[58:26] see then just to go back to the garden
[58:29] remember satan quoted eve
[58:32] the quotes
[58:35] that's got not really said
[58:38] that's not the prophet said this
[58:41] oh praise god bless the lord he also
[58:45] said this too
[58:49] amen
[58:51] i'm sorry but it's good word
[58:53] it's good word anyway
[58:56] hallelujah
[58:58] hallelujah god is so amazing good he
[59:00] said you know romans 8 we don't have to
[59:02] go there but romans 8 5 and 7 it says
[59:04] that which is flesh
[59:06] is just flesh
[59:08] it's just flesh
[59:11] and i'm stirring up the flesh
[59:13] but he said that's the spirit
[59:16] oh it's of the spirit
[59:18] you decide what your god is
[59:21] my bible says that god is the spirit
[59:24] and those that that worship him will
[59:26] worship him in spirit and in all the
[59:28] truth
[59:29] amen hallelujah here here's a good
[59:33] baptist person here talking and he asked
[59:35] brother branham he said you know he said
[59:37] brother branham if i told you a story he
[59:38] said do you believe in a paradox
[59:42] and brother brahm said oh for sure i
[59:44] believe in a paradox
[59:46] he said well i thought you would he said
[59:48] i would never tell this story
[59:50] to anybody else
[59:52] because i don't feel they would believe
[59:55] me
[59:56] and they would think i was little
[59:58] cuckoo
[1:00:01] he said it was during the time of the
[1:00:02] depression
[1:00:04] and uh
[1:00:06] you could get medicine from the
[1:00:07] government you could wait in long lines
[1:00:10] and this man owned a drug store and
[1:00:12] there was a pregnant lady there with her
[1:00:15] husband
[1:00:16] and the line was like five or six hours
[1:00:18] long i'm just paraphrasing this i'm not
[1:00:20] trying to change it
[1:00:22] along and
[1:00:23] and
[1:00:24] she was very very sickly
[1:00:28] later in her delivery
[1:00:30] pregnancy
[1:00:31] and
[1:00:32] they come in to the pharmacy store
[1:00:34] because
[1:00:35] it was killing the lady to wait in line
[1:00:38] and the pharmacy young boy
[1:00:41] was out front
[1:00:42] and he said you know he put down the the
[1:00:45] uh pharmacy thing though this our
[1:00:47] prophet told us
[1:00:49] and it just so happens the message was
[1:00:51] are absolute
[1:00:55] also was the end of 63. and he told this
[1:00:58] story and he said they put down the the
[1:01:00] uh the
[1:01:02] thing from the doctor for the medicine
[1:01:04] and it was very obvious the woman was
[1:01:07] her husband was actually helping hold
[1:01:08] her up and and beside herself you know
[1:01:12] sick and her husband saying you know
[1:01:13] we'll soon have the medicine
[1:01:16] and
[1:01:18] you know this will help you
[1:01:20] amen and he so the young man turned to
[1:01:23] leave
[1:01:26] and he said to the boy he said by the
[1:01:28] way he said i don't have the money on me
[1:01:32] today
[1:01:34] but he said i will get it
[1:01:36] and come back and pay you
[1:01:39] i believe the government refunded the
[1:01:41] money or that they could get it in the
[1:01:43] line
[1:01:45] and the young boy said he said well i'm
[1:01:47] sorry sir
[1:01:49] but we're not allowed to fill
[1:01:50] prescriptions
[1:01:52] without the money
[1:01:55] and the
[1:01:56] man
[1:01:59] and his wife went to turn
[1:02:01] go out the door
[1:02:04] this is the father
[1:02:06] in the back and he said i was in the
[1:02:07] back filling prescriptions
[1:02:10] and he said
[1:02:12] i heard
[1:02:14] everything that was going on
[1:02:18] he said i come up
[1:02:20] and he said i said just wait a minute
[1:02:24] he said i got the details
[1:02:28] and he said just give me a minute
[1:02:30] he said i'll go fill that
[1:02:36] bring it back to
[1:02:46] you said i was fixing the prescription
[1:02:51] and the man was
[1:02:54] literally his wife was kind of
[1:02:55] collapsing and just
[1:02:57] it was just a bad situation you know
[1:03:00] they don't go into everything he says
[1:03:02] but i want to start reading here
[1:03:05] he said i fixed domestication as quick
[1:03:07] as i could to fill the prescription
[1:03:21] and he said
[1:03:22] when i started to put it
[1:03:25] in her head
[1:03:37] i'm sorry
[1:03:39] her hand had a nail scarf
[1:03:45] and her head
[1:03:46] and i looked up at her face
[1:03:52] she had the thorns
[1:03:54] on her
[1:03:56] brow and he said i touched my eyes
[1:04:00] and looked back again
[1:04:02] and he said i realized right then
[1:04:06] and so much as you've done it to the
[1:04:08] least of these
[1:04:11] he said
[1:04:13] do you believe me brother branham
[1:04:16] he said
[1:04:19] i put that in jesus act
[1:04:24] this is what the prophet said
[1:04:27] he said with all my heart doctor
[1:04:31] i believe every word
[1:04:34] you said
[1:04:38] with all my heart
[1:04:41] i believe every word you said
[1:04:44] amen
[1:04:46] here's god in heaven separating
[1:04:49] the sheep
[1:04:51] from the goats
[1:04:53] our heavenly father wasn't just
[1:04:54] concerned about what
[1:04:57] you could do for him
[1:05:00] so what can you do
[1:05:01] for god
[1:05:03] man every father will be concerned what
[1:05:05] they can do for somebody else but us as
[1:05:08] the bride of christ
[1:05:10] we should be concerned
[1:05:13] what we can do for others the prophet
[1:05:15] said repeatedly
[1:05:17] repeatedly
[1:05:19] living for others
[1:05:21] was eternal life that don't mean paying
[1:05:23] somebody else's bills
[1:05:25] that don't mean
[1:05:27] that we know there's people that come
[1:05:29] around the church just to get all they
[1:05:30] can get
[1:05:32] and man i understand that there's been
[1:05:34] i understand that totally there's
[1:05:37] there's
[1:05:38] bloodsuckers out there
[1:05:42] but you'll know the real
[1:05:44] you'll know the real
[1:05:46] and you know what
[1:05:48] i've been suck some of that blood
[1:05:51] before
[1:05:55] just give it to god
[1:05:57] god will give you more blood back
[1:06:00] i remember you know
[1:06:02] just
[1:06:03] just god knows
[1:06:05] it don't even matter god knows
[1:06:08] another country and you know we were
[1:06:09] doing things for message people and
[1:06:12] god's the ultimate judge
[1:06:15] amen
[1:06:16] so it don't matter even if it's
[1:06:19] if you did it with a pure heart and they
[1:06:21] mistreated you
[1:06:23] they mistreated christ
[1:06:25] and i would beg for mercy some of those
[1:06:27] people i begged for mercy from them
[1:06:30] i had a minister in another country and
[1:06:33] he wronged us and i said you know you
[1:06:36] you stole god's money
[1:06:39] i wouldn't want to be you but i forgive
[1:06:41] you
[1:06:42] i forgive you
[1:06:44] we know that and it makes us cautious
[1:06:46] but that is still no excuse
[1:06:49] why see remember
[1:06:51] when when uh in the bible in john 16 he
[1:06:54] said
[1:06:55] and even paul
[1:06:58] but the bible says in john 16
[1:07:01] it said they will kill you
[1:07:04] and believe
[1:07:05] they're doing god a service
[1:07:07] but just think about that
[1:07:09] when you know in your history
[1:07:12] people that have maybe left the
[1:07:14] fellowship in any area
[1:07:16] but in an attacking way
[1:07:20] and they believe that now watch this
[1:07:23] those people are deceived
[1:07:25] but they believe with all their heart
[1:07:27] that they're helping god stay on
[1:07:30] this side of the quotes
[1:07:32] and they're latching back believing
[1:07:35] they're doing god a service
[1:07:38] in john 16 1-3 he said they'll kill you
[1:07:40] and think they're doing god a service
[1:07:42] and the bible says they don't even know
[1:07:47] who god is
[1:07:50] that's john 16 1-3 for anybody who would
[1:07:52] like to know that
[1:07:54] man
[1:07:55] it don't change just because we're in
[1:07:58] this tie
[1:08:00] but see we're in a laodicean age and
[1:08:02] everything is against
[1:08:03] you know it used to be i heard a story
[1:08:05] told about the minister's boy and uh
[1:08:09] this almost sounds
[1:08:11] uh
[1:08:12] far out there but he said my mom never
[1:08:15] knew what the car handle door was flower
[1:08:19] because her whole entire life he said if
[1:08:21] she thinks if she ties the car handle
[1:08:22] door it'll start and drive away without
[1:08:24] her
[1:08:25] because she in her whole entire life but
[1:08:28] see
[1:08:28] it used to be more like that a gentleman
[1:08:30] with tip when bro the prophet is around
[1:08:32] he tips hot he meets someone in the
[1:08:33] street tip his head every time
[1:08:37] really
[1:08:39] see how but but god never changed
[1:08:42] but see see how that was just a it was
[1:08:44] it wasn't a mocking it wasn't courtesy
[1:08:46] hold the door for everybody hold it over
[1:08:48] for someone you don't know
[1:08:53] amen
[1:08:54] the bible says in the end times see
[1:08:56] parents and children will come against
[1:08:58] each other it's all prophecy it's got to
[1:09:00] happen
[1:09:01] but it not always was so
[1:09:04] amen
[1:09:05] respect
[1:09:07] and honor one another i if it's all
[1:09:08] right i'd like to read some of these
[1:09:10] quotes
[1:09:11] that day on calvary
[1:09:14] i don't normally read it but the prophet
[1:09:16] just says it so
[1:09:18] beautifully amen and this is just
[1:09:20] it's just something that you don't hear
[1:09:22] every day
[1:09:23] and i believe it's good uh
[1:09:25] i really believe it's good food you know
[1:09:28] amen good for us to think on these
[1:09:31] things amen
[1:09:34] now he says here in that day in calvary
[1:09:36] in 60 he says now the first thing i want
[1:09:38] to say is jesus never lived
[1:09:40] for himself
[1:09:42] his life was always spent for others
[1:09:44] perfectly that's perfectly
[1:09:47] eternal life and he say well why go to
[1:09:49] church and i do good things and he said
[1:09:51] that's fine but when you live your life
[1:09:53] for yourself
[1:09:54] you haven't got
[1:09:56] eternal life eternal life is living for
[1:09:58] others and it proves it
[1:10:00] when you come in to the lamb of god
[1:10:04] he lived and had eternal life because he
[1:10:06] lived himself for others and if you
[1:10:08] receive eternal life
[1:10:10] by receiving receiving that day
[1:10:14] you won't live
[1:10:15] you don't live
[1:10:17] for yourself
[1:10:18] no more
[1:10:20] you live for others
[1:10:23] he said how can you stand and let
[1:10:24] anybody call you
[1:10:26] here they're saying i mentioned this i
[1:10:28] believe the last time i preached he said
[1:10:29] how can you stand here and let people
[1:10:32] call you all these bad names he said i
[1:10:34] don't live
[1:10:35] for myself
[1:10:37] he said i live for others and that you
[1:10:39] might
[1:10:40] redeem that man
[1:10:42] and you might become sons and he said
[1:10:44] the trouble of it is the church has
[1:10:45] forgot
[1:10:47] that they're sons
[1:10:48] and you're sons and you're taking
[1:10:50] christ's place so you're a son and you
[1:10:52] don't live for yourself you live for
[1:10:54] others
[1:10:56] he said you live for that man that hates
[1:10:58] you and the person that would kill you
[1:11:00] if they could
[1:11:02] he said that's what he done
[1:11:05] because they did kill him
[1:11:07] and he died that he might save
[1:11:10] them
[1:11:11] and that's eternal life and then you
[1:11:14] and when you have that in your bosom
[1:11:17] you're facing heaven then
[1:11:20] hallelujah ain't that so true it's so
[1:11:22] backed up with our scriptures that we
[1:11:23] ready man you don't you don't think of
[1:11:26] it
[1:11:27] in that way so many times especially in
[1:11:30] our generations
[1:11:31] hallelujah he said that's what the
[1:11:33] tabernacle and that's what all the
[1:11:35] people has got to do is find out what
[1:11:38] you are
[1:11:39] and that's what the real purpose is
[1:11:42] church
[1:11:43] going to church and playing music and
[1:11:44] singing songs he said church is a
[1:11:46] correct place to be
[1:11:48] but judgment begins
[1:11:50] in the house of god he said you must
[1:11:52] reckon yourself
[1:11:54] dad
[1:11:55] and let christ live amen any believer
[1:11:58] that's got that so in here he talks
[1:12:00] about the goats he said depart from me
[1:12:02] and he says he said you were hungry and
[1:12:04] you didn't feed me and i was in prison
[1:12:06] you didn't visit me
[1:12:07] and i was thirsty and you didn't water
[1:12:09] me
[1:12:10] said the part for me he said
[1:12:15] and on the
[1:12:17] sheep
[1:12:19] he says i was hungry and you fed me and
[1:12:22] all these things
[1:12:23] and you ministered on to me
[1:12:26] and he said notice
[1:12:27] it didn't fall to get this church
[1:12:30] in your heart forever
[1:12:32] it's so unconditionally done
[1:12:34] that's what i want to paraphrase it's
[1:12:36] not like a struggle
[1:12:39] you just you don't even think about it
[1:12:40] you hold the door
[1:12:42] oh i got that
[1:12:44] it's just it's just the little things
[1:12:45] that no you don't even mentally
[1:12:48] i should have done that he said
[1:12:51] it's unconditionally and i want to get
[1:12:52] into this he said the people
[1:12:54] don't do it
[1:12:56] for a line of duty he said a man gives
[1:12:58] you something or another he said because
[1:13:01] he ought to do it the man that feeds you
[1:13:03] because you ought to do it he said he's
[1:13:05] got the person to give it to you has got
[1:13:07] a selfish idea he said it should be your
[1:13:10] very life
[1:13:13] and your very action he's gonna watch us
[1:13:16] he said it was so surprising to see
[1:13:18] these sheep say well lord when did i do
[1:13:20] it
[1:13:25] he said it's so automatic out of love
[1:13:28] it's just
[1:13:29] in you it's just
[1:13:32] your life
[1:13:33] god let people see that
[1:13:35] on calvary
[1:13:36] what he did for us it was just so
[1:13:40] automatic
[1:13:42] hallelujah
[1:13:45] and look at what jesus said he said in
[1:13:46] so much that you've done it for these
[1:13:48] you did it
[1:13:50] for me
[1:13:54] an unselfish life not a second's thought
[1:13:56] you don't think about it
[1:13:58] but you're just so dead to the things of
[1:14:00] the world and live in christ that you're
[1:14:02] walking highway and the things are just
[1:14:04] so automatic you just do them
[1:14:06] he said it's not that
[1:14:08] you're just a part of him and his
[1:14:10] spirit's dwelling in you and you act
[1:14:12] like him
[1:14:14] he said you get it
[1:14:17] he said you get it
[1:14:19] there's a way that seemeth right but the
[1:14:20] end thereof's death
[1:14:23] i want there's a part here oh he said he
[1:14:25] said not say he said you know he said
[1:14:28] willow jones here he's talking about
[1:14:30] somebody coming back to him he said will
[1:14:31] jones he said one time she was out of
[1:14:33] coal oh i want you to catch this just
[1:14:36] think about it
[1:14:37] and i went over and i bought her some
[1:14:39] coal and i tell you
[1:14:41] i seen a brother that needed a suit a
[1:14:44] clothes and i went and got him a suit of
[1:14:46] clothes
[1:14:48] and he said god bless you i'm a
[1:14:50] christian
[1:14:51] oh my what
[1:14:53] now this is the same vindicated prophet
[1:14:55] that we read all these other quotes from
[1:15:02] he said oh my you selfish
[1:15:05] poor
[1:15:06] miserable person
[1:15:08] you are
[1:15:10] a hypocrite
[1:15:14] i read that i thought
[1:15:17] but they just did all those
[1:15:19] nice things
[1:15:22] do you know why he called them you
[1:15:24] selfish poor
[1:15:26] miserable person
[1:15:29] you are a hypocrite
[1:15:32] because they had to think about
[1:15:35] that they were doing it
[1:15:38] the same act
[1:15:40] but the different spirit on it
[1:15:43] sounds like when some people come to
[1:15:45] church
[1:15:46] or come over to your house
[1:15:49] and they act like it's a duty to show up
[1:15:52] i had other things to do but i felt like
[1:15:54] i should come
[1:16:00] really same vindicated profit
[1:16:04] how do you think somebody's going to
[1:16:05] feel when they're impr well you know i'd
[1:16:07] rather not be here but
[1:16:09] i knew you were in jail so i thought i'd
[1:16:13] well don't let me hold you up
[1:16:20] he said oh this is the problem he says
[1:16:22] the next paragraph he said don't let
[1:16:23] your right hand know what the left hand
[1:16:25] is doing the left know what the right
[1:16:27] hand is doing just automatically dead in
[1:16:29] christ till you do it anyhow and it's
[1:16:32] your just your nature your makeup you do
[1:16:35] it anyhow and it's just your life you
[1:16:37] don't even realize you're doing it it's
[1:16:38] completely yielded to the spirit of god
[1:16:41] and it just lives itself out you he said
[1:16:43] you feel the you
[1:16:45] he said you feel that blessed spirit
[1:16:48] that's life
[1:16:49] it's not me that liveth paul said but
[1:16:50] it's christ that liveth in me it's just
[1:16:53] so completely
[1:16:55] automatic
[1:16:58] well he said i tell you brother branham
[1:17:00] we are christians here and we're helping
[1:17:01] these people and we're helping them he
[1:17:04] said
[1:17:05] this blows my mind
[1:17:07] he said oh my
[1:17:08] shame on you that's not even christian
[1:17:16] wow
[1:17:18] christian is just automatic get that god
[1:17:21] it's done
[1:17:22] and you forgot about it it's all done
[1:17:25] he said see christ is just automatically
[1:17:27] surrendered life to god see he said i do
[1:17:29] nothing but the father show me
[1:17:32] first
[1:17:34] he said he gave himself for a public
[1:17:36] service to the people and he gave his
[1:17:37] life freely and he didn't have to do it
[1:17:40] he didn't give it begrudgingly
[1:17:43] do it he didn't say oh brethren oh i
[1:17:47] ought to think about the whole lot of me
[1:17:50] but because you come and die for me
[1:17:53] he never said the word about it he died
[1:17:57] anyhow because it was god
[1:18:00] in him
[1:18:02] he said it's something not something
[1:18:04] that you try to do you can't work
[1:18:07] yourself up to it
[1:18:09] that's a whole
[1:18:10] problem with people that's make
[1:18:13] believers
[1:18:14] you don't work yourself up to speaking
[1:18:16] in tongues
[1:18:17] you don't work yourself up to prophecy
[1:18:20] you don't work yourself up to get in the
[1:18:22] holy ghost you're either born in the
[1:18:25] family or you're not born in the family
[1:18:27] yes you'll accept the resurrection price
[1:18:29] to redeem you back amen but you don't
[1:18:32] have to work yourself up it's a part of
[1:18:34] you he said it's something that burns in
[1:18:37] you
[1:18:41] hallelujah
[1:18:42] but if you left great things undone
[1:18:44] it this is what self-sacrifice life is
[1:18:48] that god lived for you automatically
[1:18:50] doing what's right
[1:18:53] he said that's calvary meant to you
[1:18:56] on the highway opened up that day now
[1:18:58] remember you can't be
[1:18:59] a halfway goat
[1:19:01] in a halfway sheep
[1:19:03] it won't mix
[1:19:06] now remember genesis 3 15. ain't that
[1:19:08] that's just that's just so beautiful
[1:19:11] from then on god said i'll put enmity
[1:19:14] just think of that spiritually
[1:19:17] satan
[1:19:18] you will never touch in this last day we
[1:19:22] will have a bride of christ
[1:19:24] amen and you it won't there's nothing
[1:19:27] you can throw you can impersonate her
[1:19:29] you can indoctrinate her you can quote
[1:19:32] her half the word
[1:19:34] you will never stumble
[1:19:36] a word made bride
[1:19:39] amen you know how he said was accepting
[1:19:41] the the the proof of the baptism of the
[1:19:43] holy ghost was accepting the the word
[1:19:46] for your day and being able to say amen
[1:19:49] to every word of it
[1:19:50] not understand it
[1:19:52] just believe it by revelation he said
[1:19:54] you know i was reading a quote this day
[1:19:55] he said you know he said if you
[1:19:57] understood and
[1:19:59] understood everything you wouldn't need
[1:20:00] faith
[1:20:02] and he said faith is revelation
[1:20:05] god said it and i believe it and i don't
[1:20:07] understand it
[1:20:08] but that settles it for me
[1:20:10] hallelujah he said it's just automatic
[1:20:12] to something that you do more than then
[1:20:15] you're going to get a drink of water
[1:20:17] when you're thirsty
[1:20:20] it's you don't strain to think oh well
[1:20:23] oh golly i helped somebody
[1:20:27] amen
[1:20:30] he says here again he repeats it he said
[1:20:32] now you can't be halfway sheep and
[1:20:34] halfway goats if you have that without
[1:20:37] the other
[1:20:38] he said
[1:20:53] amen
[1:20:55] it's talking about the love of god and
[1:20:56] and
[1:20:57] that's all part of the package amen
[1:21:00] he said
[1:21:01] though i sell my goods to feed the poor
[1:21:03] and everything else
[1:21:05] amen but the bottom line is the love of
[1:21:07] christ
[1:21:09] come down but that love will tabernacle
[1:21:11] when love's projected
[1:21:13] everything else
[1:21:15] grace sovereign grace takes over amen
[1:21:18] and may they be born in the kingdom
[1:21:19] great kingdom of god the spiritual body
[1:21:21] essential body for christ he's talking
[1:21:23] about living for others here he said the
[1:21:25] light of god shines on their path and
[1:21:27] breaks forth the veil the veil that
[1:21:30] beautiful light and when they're walking
[1:21:31] the highway of holiness it's living for
[1:21:33] others
[1:21:35] as christ did
[1:21:37] amen
[1:21:39] amazing
[1:21:40] how your life is
[1:21:44] affects
[1:21:45] how christ will look at you
[1:21:47] on that day
[1:21:50] amazing
[1:21:54] that's an important thing to know
[1:21:57] in this day
[1:21:59] because in all these scriptures these
[1:22:00] people thought they were right
[1:22:02] and the in the 10 virgins
[1:22:05] they were all virgins they were holy
[1:22:07] people
[1:22:08] amen just not prepared
[1:22:10] these people that came up they didn't
[1:22:13] even recognize the christ they were
[1:22:15] doing it with and it's because the same
[1:22:18] time when paul was persecuting him he
[1:22:20] didn't recognize the believers
[1:22:22] as christ and the same people that
[1:22:25] outlash
[1:22:27] ah
[1:22:29] any believers
[1:22:30] in any way
[1:22:32] they're not recognized this our prophet
[1:22:34] said he said when somebody does things
[1:22:36] like that he said they don't recognize
[1:22:39] the presence
[1:22:40] of jehovah god
[1:22:45] and bad your skin
[1:22:47] they said i was just talking to brother
[1:22:49] dale
[1:22:54] uh-huh
[1:22:56] god remembers
[1:22:58] god help us amen
[1:23:04] god help us

[1:23:10] just let me go through
[1:23:15] wow

[1:23:35] so the christian life is not some kind
[1:23:37] of cool tool that keeps religious
[1:23:39] organizations moving a christian is not
[1:23:41] a christian a christian is a christ-like
[1:23:45] a christian cannot be a christian until
[1:23:47] christ is tabernacled in that man you
[1:23:49] can't be a christian unless you were
[1:23:50] born from god
[1:23:52] amen you can imitate it
[1:23:55] the life of christ and that produces the
[1:23:56] life of christ so living you
[1:23:58] the things that christ did he said you
[1:24:00] will do he said what am i talking about
[1:24:02] he said i'm talking about a personal
[1:24:05] relationship
[1:24:07] with christ what is it it's your life
[1:24:10] lived
[1:24:11] for others

[1:24:16] is a mighty member body a spiritual
[1:24:20] body for heaven you were born you were
[1:24:23] born here he says it here is your life
[1:24:25] worthy of the gospel you were born into
[1:24:27] the church of jesus christ

[1:24:31] relationship with god in order to be a
[1:24:34] son of god you must be come
[1:24:38] a relative to god
[1:24:40] a relationship with god you must be he

[1:24:45] in order for you
[1:24:47] to be his son the new birth the only
[1:24:49] thing that will produce
[1:24:52] is a relationship

[1:24:57] hallelujah
[1:24:59] hallelujah
[1:25:02] thank you lord jesus amen
[1:25:08] he said if you got eternal life there's
[1:25:10] only one form and that's god and you
[1:25:13] express attributes
[1:25:15] that'll be living for others
[1:25:17] and if you
[1:25:19] and if you're not then you're not going
[1:25:22] to be there

[1:25:33] in
[1:25:35] in 64. i'm just reading the highlights
[1:25:37] he said you see it he said it's got
[1:25:39] predestinated this thing to be there to
[1:25:42] meet the challenge of the age and he
[1:25:44] said when he pronouncing anything it to
[1:25:46] hap anything to happen it says it will
[1:25:49] happen and he knows the seed will be
[1:25:52] there
[1:25:53] just at that time
[1:25:55] and he predestinated a bride and she's
[1:25:57] going to be there in the rapture
[1:25:59] she's going to be there and he
[1:26:01] predestinated by his poor knowledge
[1:26:03] and see there's nothing
[1:26:06] there's nothing
[1:26:08] can stop it
[1:26:10] hallelujah
[1:26:13] thank you lord
[1:26:16] amen
[1:26:21] amen it's just so
[1:26:23] amazing

[1:26:28] think that jesus came
[1:26:30] and brought this new
[1:26:32] this new family through how he was going
[1:26:35] to separate satan's
[1:26:37] uh lineage from the family of god amen
[1:26:40] and you see how
[1:26:42] just automatically
[1:26:43] you take the
[1:26:46] the characteristics
[1:26:48] of your dad
[1:26:54] hallelujah
[1:26:59] here he said jesus
[1:27:00] jesus only asked one thing that he
[1:27:02] prayed to his father
[1:27:04] amen that's the spirit of god he said
[1:27:06] you know
[1:27:08] you know what that was he said the one
[1:27:10] thing after all his sacrifice and all
[1:27:13] that he did on the earth for the world
[1:27:16] and his life that he lived and the path
[1:27:18] that he walked he said there was only
[1:27:19] one thing that he come back to the
[1:27:20] spirit of god and that's the father's
[1:27:22] sword he said that where i am
[1:27:26] you may be also
[1:27:28] that's all he ask god for his sacrifice
[1:27:31] that the family would be together
[1:27:34] that's a 65 quote hallelujah amen you
[1:27:38] know when a father comes home it should
[1:27:40] be the greatest joy when you think when
[1:27:42] you come in to worship god they don't

[1:27:46] was out and
[1:27:48] singing that song what a day that'll be
[1:27:51] and just the spirit of god if you just

[1:27:55] family will get in the spirit and when a
[1:27:57] dad comes home her family and the
[1:27:59] family's reunited it should be the
[1:28:01] greatest joy
[1:28:03] that ever comes out the same as when the
[1:28:05] prophet come home and the house was in
[1:28:07] an uproar just if you can get the spirit

[1:28:29] read that closing genesis 3 15 i'll put
[1:28:32] enmity between thee
[1:28:34] and the woman and between thy seed
[1:28:37] and her seed just think of that
[1:28:39] spiritually speaking
[1:28:41] satan cannot touch
[1:28:44] the born again believer he cannot touch
[1:28:48] a believer that came from god oh he's
[1:28:50] going to try and impersonate it he's
[1:28:52] going to try and come quotes close

[1:35:13] wrong absolute
[1:35:16] you know our prophet even taught us that
[1:35:18] the flesh of jesus christ
[1:35:20] it's not our absolute
[1:35:22] the spirit that tabernacled in him
[1:35:25] was
[1:35:26] but not the flesh
[1:35:29] jesus if he could have by his choice
[1:35:30] wouldn't have died
[1:35:32] he asked the father to change his mind
[1:35:34] twice
[1:35:36] our prophet said that jesus spoke in
[1:35:38] riddles and that's why the disciples
[1:35:40] didn't understand them
[1:35:42] man
[1:35:45] but people get caught up you know the
[1:35:46] bible says don't have any graven image
[1:35:50] it's just flesh

[1:36:19] even in this message
[1:36:21] and they're looking to different
[1:36:22] prophets
[1:36:25] and they're looking to our prophet it's
[1:36:26] not our absolute
[1:36:29] inside the message
[1:36:31] there is an absolute it's the word of
[1:36:33] god inside of it
[1:36:35] but not the flesh
[1:36:37] not every word
[1:36:39] that's the prophet's own words
[1:36:43] prophet's own words
