all for for helping and taking her shoes off it just makes them world of difference amen just so amen all these good things amen just remember Pastor Leo in your prayers he got really sick after Easter weekend and actually went to the hospital a couple times and believe he was fighting pneumonia and he's actually fighting high blood pressure and uh probably some of that was brother Dale pressure amen I have to repent amen but uh just pray for him amen he's just the land was giving them some natural stuff he can take but uh that he was doing a lot of business stuff he you know he the land got finalized and stuff and and all went fantastic amen and we thank God for it we give God credit man let's turn to Joshua 24 and just covet your prayers amen I just uh had many many ways to go and thoughts and I stand here today don't even know where I'm going but God does and we just surrender to him man Joshua 24 and 15. and we read a prescription so we have receipts amen and just uh amen and if it seemed evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord Hallelujah I'm going down serving the lord Hallelujah there ain't no doubt about it amen thank you Jesus amen Philippians 4 just another ones here Philippians 4 and I'm going to be still kind of touching on our our teaching the kitchen table of God's kitchen table and I just really have enjoyed that myself amen and Ephesians 4 11 and now that I speak in respects of one for I have learned and whatsoever state they're with whichever state I'm in there with to be content and I know both how to abound be abased and I know how to abound and everywhere in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry and both to abound and to suffering and I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me Hallelujah Lord Jesus we decide so you just add your blessings to the your word this morning and we give you the glory and honor for it in your name we pray amen you may have your seats I just was looking for another scripture here that was supposed to be on top here let's turn to Hebrews 2 just laying a foundation and just trying to surrender to God in how we will go amen and and this morning Ephesians 2 or Hebrews 2 sorry Hebrews 2. one and it just uh this is concerning that God's kitchen table and instructions and his word and you know I want to say this you know in the world we're living in if if we stay with the word of God if we stay with what's right that this sink in you're gonna seem radical and if we stick with the message of the hour and the pure truth you're going to be snubbed by believers your pastor brother Dale's going to be because the the word of God just says some really hard things sometimes and and there's no way in the world I could give you an answer for it but believe it amen but I know in all of that that if somehow brother Dale can surrender there's an amazing piece that it can be lightening out and storming and the world going to war and blowing up and just anything and you can just walk around and you're just like it's like you ever see a kid that's been in a war-torn area and there's bombs falling in the neighbor's yard and that and it's and it's like if I tell you a story he said but you know I was working with electrician Herman Leicester the one time and and he was wired with the light draw on he was he was you know he was an electrician so he didn't fear him we're Christians so the world don't fear us help me preach and and so he would touch the wire and it would shock and he wouldn't even Flinch you know like a bomb would fall and rush and he just and I was standing beside him like this did he touch it again and it shot and he said Dale would you get away from me you're making me nervous didn't Jesus when he went and pray for the the little girl he said get away from me you're making me nervous that was god Jehovah whoo turn the news off brother Dale ouch whoa you know you should only listen to the news to see what time we're in and I'll tell you right now man if you don't believe in the Rapture you're in the wrong church because it's it's like amen Hallelujah I say this before we preach and this is not uh prophecy this is not a prophecy if I process I'm going to be able to see it plainly from God this is your brother Dale in the flesh the states will go to war with China they will they have to because China's cornering them in a box and they're going to go broke either way and they'll fight going broke guaranteed guarantine a hundred percent and I believe we're going to be here to see some of that I hope we're not but we won't be here for Atomic Warfare the prophet said that we won't be here there will be no atomic bombs but the US dollar is going down and there and China's pushing hard and the states will retaliate it's guaranteed it'll be over Taiwan but it will happen you can mark that on the calendar and put brother Dale's Name by it it'll happen amen Hebrews 2 1. therefore we ought to give the more Earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time now we're talking about the word of God not brother Dale in the flesh less at any time they slipped away from us first the word be spoken of angels was steadfast and every transgression and every Disobedience received a just re recompense of reward how shall we escape how are we going to escape message believers the word of God if we don't obey it how's brother Dale going to escape brother God put it there and he sent us a prophet he loved us double he loved us double because he he didn't put it there he sent a teacher to explain it amen how so brother Dale Escape how shall we escape if we neglect this word of God you say this great salvation this great salvation is the word of God this is the message this salvation the only place you're going to find the Salvation is in the revealed word for your day how are you going to escape if we neglect this great message this great salvation which was first begotten to smoke by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them who heard him wow see Satan knows he's a great adversary and he knows when to attack the bride he knows when like number one we said this last time we've ministered all the guns are on God's chosen they're not on who Satan's already conquered they're on his side they're all on God's chosen and Satan knows exactly when to attack he's fat and he's lazy you say brother no you don't listen Satan always comes in for the good spoils of God number one he's coming for God's the best chosen bride hello hello and he's waiting until you're at perfection and then he wants to pick the flower oh he don't wait he don't come when the flower's getting planted no no no he's not interested in the work remember how many people helped the chicken baked the loaf of bread that's like Satan he he he's not interested in planting flowers he's not interested in praying he's not interested in coming to church or foot washing the community no no he's not interested none of that but when you get raped nice and pure and holy and you just open up all those that fresh fragrance then Satan says that's beautiful I think I'll come by you say brother Dale give me an example the Philistines when they come in and attacked Israel and took the crops they weren't around when the Israelites were planting the crop in the springtime they weren't around when they were greasing the tractor and trains in the oil and the Campbells and feeding the oats and the hay and carrying out the waste no no no no Satan wasn't around no no no they were completely free amen they weren't around when when they were the Philistines came to church and they were praying on their crops nope nope nope Satan they were completely free oh praise the Lord they weren't around when the crops were really green and Lush and looked beautiful nope nope see then they were they were the church was just having Revival Glory Hallelujah praise God but when there got to be some value there when they start to open up the rows when that grain came all in the head and it started bowing under the weight of the beauty and you see you see a holy ghost-filled person it I'm serious you see a holy ghost-filled person you know the prophet said I never wanted to grow up and be an old crunchy old man but you see a holy ghost filled god-filled safe that's just filled with the Holy Ghost and he's just he's just like honey it's just so full and brother I just want to rub up by him because he's just adorable and that's when Satan come in and said I'll take the crops that's when Satan comes in when you raise up your girl's brother Matt or any of you your parents raise up your kids and then you raise them up and you labor indefinitely until it becomes teenagers then Satan says I'll take him he wasn't around when he was changing the diapers no no no he wasn't around sister Ruth when you were praying on your knees all night for your little girls to get the Holy Ghost no no Satan wasn't around that but then when they're coming right up to Beauty Jake says ah thank you very much and it's about time you punch Satan right in the nose amen you need to stand up like the Israelite did and I looked in the Bible I forget his name leaves me right now but he killed over 600 Philistines doubles himself I said Satan you can line up or attack me all out once don't make no difference to me I'd done had a rake to hear no no that's not that's not that's not that's not brother Hill talking oh no no no no no no no no no all these people in the Bible it was the anointing of the Holy Ghost it was Samson was anointing of the Holy Ghost I said back up double you're not coming fresh bullions and there's things in the word of God that we need to stand on and that's why he's saying that song is be at peace perfect peace it's not your peace yeah and if you're looking for peace in a bank account like sorry but you ain't never having one in this country because it's called tax it's It's Supernatural peace it's God's peace that in the storm it's not even affected man I read it I read an article in the studying and I it was talking about an airplane that was flying over a ship and the air the plane was it well I read another one about an airplane but but the ship was just tossed crazy in the out of control and there was a the one of the persons on the plane said something about why don't that ship sink and there was an old sailor on the ship or on the plane he told the person he said you know why that ship don't say she said that's just anchored on the Rock of Ages he said that ship's got a good old anchor and he said don't matter how that tossed he said that's holding that ship solid and those waves can come ready without but that's it's connected it ain't just bouncing on the race like this no it's connected to a rock called Christ Jesus oh hallelujah amen and we need to stand on God's word and we need to be at peace with God's word but but there's a disclaimer if we don't have the Holy Ghost which I which I believe you do but if you if somebody don't have the Holy Ghost then they can't find peace and rest and they definitely can't find it in the word of God and the message of the hour because they won't like it they won't like it you know I I want to share something with you just just give me a second I I believe me I'm not even preaching on this but but well I'll just mention this just in case you know in the Bible when the Israelites married non-believers God never forgave them they died in the wilderness I know I know they were under law and Grace but you know the Bible is very clear and I'm going to talk preaching about marriage but I'm showing you how Satan works you come you remember what we said about the kids you come and they come to an age it's natural even the Holy Ghost says natural it's natural affections that people want to get married and move on tonight but don't you never flirt with devil don't you never flirt with a religious devil that would be worse than just a flat out devil man amen I wish I could just show you my heart but you see religion how it's just fell into complete nothings amen nothing I was with people yesterday and people that are going to church or in church today and and I have to disclaimer but because they could even watch but we believe in a rapture and this world's not my home I'm on a holiday I'm just passing through and you can lay up all the treasures you want but they're going to burn they're gonna burn burn and now I believe in providing for yourself I don't mean that I I look ahead too but I'm looking ahead that they're going to burn and I'm going to heaven but there's every Church in town it's not preaching that it was people yesterday he said oh he said don't go to that place oh he'll depress you believes the world's coming to that and I'm sitting there and I'm trying not to say nothing and I'm thinking like I don't know if I should put my hand in my mouth my foot or I'm just the the furnaces and and I'm like the Bible says the world's going to come to an end how in the world are you sitting in a church believing that the world didn't come to an end I'm like my life hello but Satan has gnawled their senses over time and it'll never happen in this generation whoa here here's an example and and I really really I just pulled this quote up this morning late and so I'm really I'm going to go a different route and I'm going to be all over I'm preaching with a shotgun this morning but but here here here in the Bible there was a man that married the world and and God really was upset with them it was the worst King Israel ever had sound familiar bring that up to date and we're we've ever had amen and they Ahab was raiding over Israel and he looked at all the message believers and their beauty of holiness and he had a taste for something else that's disgusting that's completely disgusting just good old-fashioned beautiful natural God made us if God wasn't a professional oh my unbelievable amen and here he married Jezebel and she was an idol worshiper you say well that'll never happen in our that'll never happen around careful careful don't say that amen because see that's how Satan see see there's this crazy thing called feel your love affection and it messes up your brain in common sense and okay now let me jump forward to that okay I I was at the guy say I believe the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord that's that's our Bible you know and so I was at the gas station paid for some guys to just randomly on Friday and and a man commanded can I be truthful can I preach truthful he had shorts on he was really it really he didn't have a nice beard like brother Tim it was all full of gray hair so it was like it was like sandpaper gray and black and all that and but it kind of looked like on cap is that all right and he come up to the guy said he said tell her and he said he said I just want to introduce myself I'm the new pastor in the church down the road I was standing right like just right there I'm watching the whole thing and he said you know if you need anything ever and all this stuff and and I I I I I and he left and I said he's just going out there I said Hey brother I said just wait a second I'll talk to you in the other side and so I paid for my gas now what I'll say I said I want to introduce myself I said I'm a pastor too in Wyoming nice to meet you and so he asked me some things if I knew Pentecostal people and all this and no no no no no and he said well do you know this that organization that we we go and all the denominations come and praise and I said yep yep I know about that I said there's a brother gives money to the orphanage and he went to it I said yep I'm all about I heard it was it was wonderful yeah all us pastors pastors aren't you we get together once a month and pray for each other and he said I'll give your contact to the Pentecostal Pastor I said praise God I said I'd love to be there but I'm not joining them see I'm already married spiritually but see you can't put your light on your bushel so I'm going to go and I'm in heaven like this and if they bring up something like Trinity I'm going to blow out their light or they bring up uh-huh but Satan comes in in feel your love and he tries to will you when you're guards down he comes in when the crop's right like in marriage and then he said oh well bless God you know they're they go to a pretty good church they have a pretty good message background help me there's Jesus don't go there pretty good don't work with God amen and Jezebel brought adultery into the nation among the people and the priests and the ministers and they fell victim to this great popularity demand popularity demand hello popularity demand thank you brother man somebody's helped me popularity event you ever see me getting popular kick me in the knee or smash the camera one or the other it's not about that we could have Silas preaching you know and it is the very picture of our country today wait a minute wait a minute this was the prophet you this was our prophet the very picture of our country today we've Fallen to popularity man oh no I don't like that story let's not let's stop right there but this is the same prophet but I don't like that story no doubt the priest thought that it would be all right no doubt the message preachers thought that it would be okay if we just didn't preach on the ones that hurt amen he said I'm reading this as a quote by the way he said no don't no the priest thought that it would be all right as long as the government okayed it now you know what this is an amazing prophet and I'll tell you what if he was ever Vindicated that was just number 300 million how did he know covet was going to happen do you know I posted Facebook in and Bible quotes and Bible two scriptures and two quotes and I had message preachers tell me he said but this is different because the government this is Coveted and so God understands that we're locked out of church wait a minute no this was a well-known message preacher and I definitely mentioned his name because every single one of you should have known do you know that every single person in the Bible that was a believer war against the government every single person Moses uh the the the the woman that delivered the babies for the Israelites where should I go like the disciples when don't go out and preach a Jeep thing and they beat them beat them but I don't want to be beat for the gospel God we have a modern gospel we're dignified but but we preach about those people but we don't believe what they believe there's no way we believe what they believe no we don't because I know church is right in this province that when the government allows them to open allowed them to open hello allow them to open they took a month to sterilize the church so you couldn't even use the government quote whoa ouch but I don't care what the government okays it's got to be what God okay oh man that hurts ouch no that's certainly God that'll be I got it highlighted right there I don't look for this stuff God chose it to me I mean if you knew how hard it was to find that intentionally it'd be impossible and one might ask me to retrace what I have just said oh foreign like I mean he's great in my head like that's unbelievable but it's actually true and that is a very likely picture of today now by the way I'm still reading word for word you may not think that we're idle adulterers worshipers this is being certain of God 5901 25 paragraph 10. you may not think that we are Idol worshipers brother Matt oh but I don't want to read the next part I don't think we are this don't qualify for us this but we are they are I change that person and the government endorses it people today are idle worshipers because they worship idols some of them worship um movie stars you say oh bless God I'm a message believer I don't do that I don't do that at all I don't worship any movie stars I don't have any TV stations in my thinking but sometimes when you see a sister preach so and they hold it like Dolly part [Music] or however they do it and I just think wow is that your own personal technique you know what our Prophet said he said if you tried to imitate somebody you'd look like a clown and that was somebody with the Holy Ghost what about Hollywood you would look like a dumb clown why not just be human and yourself is there something wrong with that for idols and some worship oh money money some so much money I've heard message believe or something he said you know praise God God give me a job I'm never at church but it was God to give it to me money Mommy well I definitely wasn't going this way this way [Music] I studied yesterday and I pulled this up this morning amen Wow money for idols and some worship television television stars for idols but all the all that you put before God is an idol let it be whatever it may be now that might be now I'm going to come in closer to you you said well breast God I don't have no problem with none of that yep praise God I'm right beside you but what about your opinion on God's word oh oh what about your opinion on the message revealed word lined up with the Bible oh oh even to Satan our great adversary is such a smart one until he puts something in the church before God and you might have a great big church you might have a great building you might have a great denominations and again you might even have a great congregation oh I'm glad you didn't say pastor but let nothing come before God and your heart and that includes any Ministry including your pastor like this relationship is not with your pastor it's with God it ain't worth the Evangelist it's with God it ain't with your favorite evangelist it's with God it ain't worth amen it ain't worth none of the fight for it's with God amen anything before God is an idol and these people knew that they wasn't spirit and these people knew that they wasn't spiritual like they used to be under the reign of other kings and they thought just because they was a religious message believer it says Nation ouch that everything would be all right and that's the way we have come to the place also and there's a lot of people brother Matt sitting in message churches and they think you know but they're like and if you lay out some word they think oh well you're a radical Dale's a radical preacher don't don't have nothing to do with him he's radical those people they're radical they they have radical they go against what the government says they're radical amen I tell you what you believe the government all you can believe a hundred percent and to be submissive to the government until it comes between you and God just like husbands and wives you you wives you love your husband but when he steps between you and God that's a different Covenant and the same thing for husbands you can love your wife to death but she starts stepping between you and your God and says you know don't serve he said wait a minute I love you dearly honey but there's just one little thing I tell you for me and this house we're going down serving the lord we're going down serving the lord and all my faults I'm still going down serving the lord Hallelujah he said here here in the message brother Brown said he said God could never bless Abraham until he fully obeyed and God will not bless his seed until you fully obey separating yourself from all things of the world amen God help us God help me and I I don't see listen listen I want I want to disclaimer preachers are not perfect beings and for sure this one if you find one that's perfect praise God for the perfect ones or very close but I'm only human I'm I'm just only human like if you step on my toes this chances are I'm just human brother man amen but God can use just humans like you use the donkey sometimes amen and the weather and all these things amen I said I wasn't gonna so I have to apologize I said I was going to leave uh uh children and uh I thought I was done it at God's table but I want to mention some more scriptures that are very hard scriptures and I can't explain them or understand but I just want you to know that they're in God's word I can tell you some of my personal thoughts on it I'm disclaimer or not but and then we're going to move on to to God's table and different things you see you see everybody has their love for special Parts amen and you know that's one thing we've seen when we even when we went to Uganda we'd ask some questions like why do you do it this way or why do you do this they said well you know but but you have to stay you know what I mean you have to stay and so I know exactly the world we're living in I happen to live in it too I understand the laws of the land and God's left us here for a reason and I believe that you're going to Blossom where you were planted but I don't believe ever that you're supposed to leave God's word now I'm going to read these scriptures and they're going to they're going to make you fall off your Pew and you're gonna think but but I'm going to give you a disclaimer after but it's something and and this is not when I read these scriptures I'm really disclaiming because it's they're they're loud but this doesn't mean that I when I was in those scriptures did it right even the prophet made mistakes and went back and apologized see because we're human I mean I don't mean I'm a prophet I just mean we're humans Hebrews 2. Hebrews 23 14. it says and I I truly am going to leave this children thing and move on to the table I'm just mentioning this for a thing this is I thought I was done and as soon as I left you know probably last two Sundays ago God said you forgot about this Hebrews 23 14 he says then then shall you beat him with a rod and he shall deliver his soul from hell now that's fire out I don't believe in beating that's what the Bible says let's let's continue reading another one a rod and reproof give wisdom but a Child Left to himself bring us his mother shame why just this mother a Child Left to himself behold not withhold not correct oh I'm sorry Hebrews the last one was he Proverbs 29 15. this one's Proverbs 23 13 sorry with whole night correction from a child for if thou bedest him with the rod he shall not die I'll go to prison with whole night correction from a child for if thou beat a Sim with the rod beat him that's hard he won't die he won't die this this is in the Bible buddy okay Proverbs 22 15. foolishness abounds in the heart of a child but the rod of Correction drives it far far far from him I'm going to tell you something I believe that scripture is singing I think many parents make mistake that's I don't mean anything personally here I don't believe I believe our kids are angels every one of them every one of them amen but when you're raising kids you can the Bible says erotic but your finger can be a rod to a three-month-old baby a six month old baby maybe a seven month old baby help me out sister Patty how old you know when the child just starts defying you and they're really young you can just go and they'll go have you and see you don't have to worry about never going calling up 9-1-1 and saying my dad just beat me to death I've never seen an eight-year-old mate seven month old talk yet I've never seen a seven month pick up the receiver and dial you say to me and what happens in this many times not here this is this is not for us this is for the online people brother Jim and sister Lyndon Chatham they're grandkids sorry brother jump uh as the kids get too old you can't chain you can't make an old dog new tricks and so when they're just and and listen children were born to cry okay I'm not talking about that I'm talking about when you know they're defying you or disrespecting you as a parent and a person and they're tiny you can correct them gently with with your rods God give you 10 rods and that's all it will take for a little Enders amen and then when the child becomes older you can just you know when you're in the grocery store you can just give them this look and they go you know what I mean because they know that look follows something amen you should never correct the child in public you should say but when we get home I have a present for you see you have ways of you know in our world I have a present I'm going to give you when we get home but make sure you keep your promise and fulfill the present in private and if they were old enough explain it to them but you know 1999 and I don't mean I did it right I remember when we went to Ohio camp and we had six kids under nine and I told him when we left the motel room if you Breeze loud in church when we come back to this room praise God we're gonna have a present for you when they there I can't I just go Meddle excuse me if you're trying to correct a kid that's like I mean I'm in favor of correcting kids that are in school you waited too long no I believe in like well believe me you know what I mean like like for example if you're in a restaurant eating shrimp with brother Dale and your kid throws a fit and you stand up and go outside and he smiles he knows he got that's the language he's speaking cry go for a ride so when our kids were in charge and we'd make him go to the bathroom before now once you pass 55 sometimes you have to go for walks more often I found that out but uh but if kids now and parents know if your kids are sick if your kids are sick we're humans don't be mean to your that's ridiculous I'm not talking about your kids are sick they need bathroom man but you know I remember a few times like when our kids just the preacher preached too long and if they needed to go up for a thing maybe if you made out there less comfortable than in here they never wanted to go out very often so every time we went out we give them a little erotic correction like Maybe there was no time at all and they had no trouble sitting on the cushion pews you know what I mean but but God said you have to tell the church this because it's here no you guys have wonderful families every one of you I mean my grandkids especially like this but you know what I'm saying they're saying for us but but there's there's problems in message churches like that and the other thing that God wants to tell you is and Uganda is wonderful at this when you discipline your kids you don't have to get upset it's not your fault they were born human so you don't have to go like in Uganda you know a mother could have five kids crawling over top of her and one's fussing and she just goes because they're very non-excitable or varied not langstas they're not like every time the house catches on fire in Uganda they like to fire beside the house because because they're but when you God didn't make you to discipline your kids and scream at them because that's insanity you just you say Hey you know but you may you would actually do most of the discipline before you can talk to them and it's and it's not like a rod it's God give you 10 rods it's just you can't bite Mommy you know you can't amen but that's part of the word of God whether the country knows it or not you know I had a example if you wait too long I had a brother in the flesh that had one of his uh kids had malfunctioned you know and he was a lang staff by the way that that has to be disclaimered and he spanked this kid and the kid kept acting up and he just keep on spanking them and this kid was old enough to talk so it was a problem and and he warmed them up really good and they get all done the spanking and the kid came up to Daddy and he said Dad I thought you were going to kill me and the dad said I thought I was going to have to that's the problem with waiting too long because when something's trained to get away with it it does it more often man it does it more often so then it takes more beatings correction amen amen see living in this world we sang that song peace I want to read a couple scriptures on that Philippians 4 9 and someday God's actually really leaning on my heart to preach on peace but this world is is in great chaos and the people and and everything about it but somehow we have to be the salt of the earth and we have to be we have to be anchored so the storm don't affect us and but I want to show you something that has to be in every Walk of Life you heard up it needs to be your anchor because see your bank account status or your bill is even unpaid don't change your status with God amen and whether you're married or not married that don't change your status with God and whether you're young or old that's how old people when they hurt they're not grouchy I had no idea that my dad went through the things he went through until I'm starting to get a little bit there and you know why I had no idea didn't show it he didn't say it amen and so you have to because if we're Anchored In Christ these little things don't affect our flesh but they do they affect my flesh but we're to get by that brother Dales to get by that hello I am so let me show you that in Philippians 4 9 he said these things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me now there's Paul teaching the people about what I just did about children or other things let me read that again and these things which you have both learned and received and heard was that from a person that God used in the Holy Ghost and you even seen it me so see Paul was worthy of the Gospel amen live me a sermon not not not to Perfection if you're looking you know and God of Peace will be with you in a world that there is no peace there is zero peace absolutely no peace let's go to Romans 8 6. Romans 8 6 he says for it to be carnally minded is death okay now is it okay to be honest okay that's where brother Dale is too much ouch let me to be carnally minded as death ouch that's me too much that's every one of us if you know if if things just you know I wish that cow hadn't died I wish I would have got that new job I wish my wife wouldn't have bought that vacuum [Music] I wish they you know but to be spiritually minded in the storm this piece life and peace see you can have peace but you get to choose if you wanted see the God of Peace is here do you accept them the God of Peace is here but are you living carnally wow you know that song we're saying is powerful song can you just imagine when we see the author of Peace at all I'll tell you right now brother Matt I'm going to lose my mind and it might not be much of a mind but it's going to be completely out of control the deacons are probably going to throw me out the window of Heaven because like it's going to be a mess we can't we we can't amen we need to we need to recognize who our God is we need to recognize the revelation of Jesus Christ and what he's given to us we don't have to live like you know God never put you know what when you come to church and you think oh it's Sunday again oh man I wished it was Monday you know who rejoices the devil no no okay I know we don't do that because when you're down and you're when you're disheartening and say brother Matt when I'm having a when my beans get caught in the crust and they don't want to grow and my dad used to say oh he's under pressure until the crop came through the ground okay but there's only one person that gets glory in that you know who it is Satan because you're carnally minded I mean he's like Dale's depressed today he can't worship God like he should I got him down a reindeer came out in front of me and I hit it with your nice new shiny car truck and you're upset oh good I got him the guy never ever planned that what does the Bible say who has he said I know the thoughts that I have towards you that's a piece prosper and health and strength and we're Believers and we are sad and depressed and burden and under pressure and we take depression pills and we take sleeping pills we take our God and here's God he's just right there and he said you know I don't I don't see you as having high blood pressure I don't see you as having trouble sleeping I don't see you having trouble burden of whether you can buy that that's one thing we've learned we've learned I've learned the way the people that have the least of the worldly Treasures are the happiness if you don't think that's the case then why is the richest people in the world commit suicide you know you can go to Uganda and their suicidal rate is zero they don't even know what you're talking about verify I don't have it that bad that we're sitting here on a plush Leather Coach with our feet up eating potato chips oh I'm so hard done by again about now and that's exactly how we live our spiritual life because we're we're soft you're worried about coming to church and it being air-conditioned most of the world dirt is happy under a tree I stayed in a church the other day this week and it was in the good old-fashioned Philippines in the rainy season and the water was just below their knee and every Pew was full you think a little bit of rain is going to keep us from going to church I'll tell you what when the water gets knee-deep in here and you show up to church in every peaceful I'll know that it's all in your approach God God's not the problem it's brother Dale's the problem it's our it's our flesh it's the problem amen God help us God help me God help me I'm not preaching to you I'm preaching to me amen peace you know we need to get to that point and when we get in that atmosphere I'll tell you what you talk about standing up brother Mike oh whoa you'll be like I tell you what it'll be like this brother Matt I can only give you examples that I see me and Luanne went to a restaurant not long ago and there was all the Pentecostal people there and oh praise God we're Believers and we speak in tongues and perhaps I know I believe in that too I'd like to do that every service those God's will it was all there's the bells there hold on and my wife get up and I'll tell you what God might judge standing right behind this Pulpit every head in that place there and it was right downtown at this breakfast restaurant and there was ladies four at a table on there like they were looking at a new gate man that's what God expects God expects them to do that of me because you're just so not Earthly but amen and you can't manufacture that piece because you get a big check in the mail it ain't gonna make it come to you amen because you have 15 kids it ain't gonna make you come to you or because you have the best wife in the world ain't gonna make you come to you it'll be God it'll be God almighty God help us let's turn to Luke 14. I'd like to get on at least one paragraph of scriptures on my kitchen table but we're going to end the year on this kitchen table Luke 14 27 to 33. in some of these verses I might paraphrase but I got them in my iPad see and what God's trying to tell us is if we come into Christ let me let me read I gotta I'm sorry I'm sorry about this I had slept Old Bay amen let me read this in Colossians 1 26 he said this even this is a mystery hidden of the ages from Generations but it's now manifested to us what's the mystery to whom God would make known The Riches of his glory of this mystery they they eat they use the word twice why do you use the twice and so brother Dale gets it and it's among the Gentiles so it's for us Colossians 1 27 Amy it's Christ in you the hope of glory and it's a mystery it's Christ in you and you cannot have Christ in you and be the same it just cannot it it will not and cannot happen it's Christ in you but it's a mystery here in Galatians 2 Galatians 2 and 20 and I'm going to get back to my scripture in Luke but Galatians 2 and 20 I just felt to say this here's Paul talking he said I'm crucified with Christ because I'm not alive nevertheless I live and yet not I I'm not alive and when I'm not alive it don't matter what's happening on this Earth it don't matter if China and the states go to war it don't matter if it's over Taiwan or not it don't matter if what's going on in Ukraine between Russia and the states and really it's just Russia and the states and Ukraine just happens to be in the middle uh it meant but see like these are this is just like see watch this this is definitely for brother that's just information but it's not really important like I know about it but because because I'm not alive like this ain't my home and I'm just passing through and like I'm not gonna have to plant crop on those fields because I won't be here and like not long term see see when we get that's what got so when we get to this piece if if it ain't in a Rapture if God comes and it will happen if the Rapture don't take place it's going to come and take one of us home and it very much brother Mike could be me but when you're in total peace with God I mean I mean you can't fake this brother man this is complete peace it's God's will you say listen God seemed it was just beautiful and instead of going to my funeral and crying you should say what an awesome God we sir I'd gone soon too God take me tune see it's completely different way because because I'm not even alive it's like brother Dale gets so uptight over whether it rains or don't rain or you know I mow the grass or don't mother but I'm not here hey hey hey our Prophet kind of lived God let me rephrase that our Prophet didn't kind of live that our Prophet did live that seeing his wife and and his little girl hello hello and looking back at his body on the bad and saying oh God don't send me back there don't send me back no send me back to Wyoming Edward Wyoming say oh God don't take me over there and God's like going they're reading the same letters and one's over there saying please don't send me by God please don't send me back what did Brother Brown's wife say can somebody help me preach when she was crossing over he said why in the world brother why in the world did you call me back can you imagine if one of us was safe and we were ready to go to Glory stop praying I'm gonna like swing a hammer out of my back says Patricia so you suck we don't believe that do we do we believe that do we really believe that I believe it's hope Brethren's first way do we really believe that she wished brother Branham wouldn't have prayed her back I believe uh-huh that's not religion that's that's that's not about this church that's something a lot higher than that whoa that's something that we can obtain here to be so at peace not you can't manufacture it's not your peace but you're so at peace and rest with God that's just like now I don't mean like when you come to the stop sign I'd look both ways still okay I'm not talking about being like like don't tempt the Lord thy God okay I'm not saying come to the Lord that God but if you've looked both ways and you didn't see somebody but we you know but but what we do is we live in guilt oh it's my fault they died if I would have prayed harder but I would have prayed harder and fast then brother Dale wouldn't have died or or one of your kids get killed in the car and he's like oh it's my fault I pulled right out in front of that guy no no what's your fault and then you let Satan just churn that you know you're backing up a semi and you you drive over a kitty cat or something I was going to say you know oh that was my fault I should have seen it how you were looking in both mirrors and Satan just turns out and guess who's winning because you just you just said well God I did all I could that's why when your kids if they go Wayward and you've raised them right and you've used your 10 rods of Correction okay yeah or less if you've lost anything and and you see you've raised your kids the best you knew and if you didn't know then from here on forward you're different and then you just say oh God you know what's all right God I did what I my best and then you're just peace you don't go like I hope hope I mean Hope's all right but it don't have a backbone faith has a Bible Prophet said the greatest enemy that Faith had what's that oh bless God I hope I go to heaven hope oh buddy if you're only hoping you're going to heaven you you better you better you better get in your closet when you go home today there's no hope in this I ain't taking something this seriously just by open yeah you know it's like this if I write a big check and I haven't called my wife and got permission I said I hope it goes through the bank no no no no no no no no no no no this is like eternity I'm crucified with Christ never yet let I I live not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the by The Who by the the faith the faith has a backbone and it's not hope by the faith of the Son of God that's that's concrete evidence guaranteed the money's in the bank Man Who Loved Me and gave himself for me amen see it's not about us it's all about Christ let me let me I promise I'm gonna close today I'm going to just read my Luke scripture Luke 14 27-33 and and uh I hope I hope there's something in this but I want to look into the scripture and see see these things that we don't normally you know when we're having Revival meetings we don't normally look into things like like dig down and you know the prophet said teach him gives you deep roots and when the winds blow you know amen and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be his disciples now if we're not following all the word of God ain't that kind of like ain't that kind of like not marrying your cross see God allows God gave you his word for his your guidance then he gave you her Holy Ghost to overshadow it all amen amen for which of you denying for which of you pertaining to build a tower Sid us not down first encounters the cost whether he is sufficient to finish it or not unless happily after he has laid the foundation is not able to finish it all that beheld it began to mock him now I know you're thinking physical but just think spiritually things like they thought they were a believer I took their kids because they were beautiful and [Music] saying this man began to build and was unable to finish or what king is going to make war against another king and said it's not down first and consult us whether he is able with the ten thousand to meet him that cometh with him with twenty thousand or else another is yet a great way off he'll send an ambassador and desires connect ions of peace so likewise what and I got a quote for this scripture by the way so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all but I didn't like those scriptures my pastor read this morning for sake it's not all their opinions cannot be my disciples but but I have a problem with that well you have to share that with God but let me it'd be okay if I read one scripture on that amen or two amen we've seen the star this is 63 12 16 growth long ago as long as you're I'm just reading the Highlight Parts as long as you're tied up with a bunch of unbelievers you don't believe those things you'll never be able to Able you see you'll be as blind as a bat cut yourself away from everything mother father you know he mentions all the things forsaking his own and come after me for is not worthy who is would put his hand to the plow and look back it's not worthy and brother or sister let me tell you that there is a genuine true Christian now this is our Prophet talking here a genuine true Christian light shining today he says tonight and it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever caught loose from everything else including make belief make believers and he is the word and he's always the word and God's word is always perfectly right and it has no private interpretation ouch this means just what it says the Bible said no private interpretation and I want to just drop down here he said uh well let me let me finish this he said if it's black it's black and if it's white it's white and that's just what it's the urum it's the absolute and everybody's born of the spirit of God is tied to this now that's all the scriptures even the ones we read today even the ones you don't understand even the ones you don't think your government will understand no matter nothing will separate him if he's tied to that word because it's Christ is the word and Christ cannot lie he's the word and you say well I know he said that but oh I know God put that in the Bible but he didn't realize that he would have this liberal government you know and there ain't no box and nothing about it he just said it and that's the way and that's what it is he can't change it he can't he's unchangeable he said Heaven's a nurse will pass away but my word will never pass away he said it'll be right and there's a season and there will be somebody and there will be somebody that'll shine in that season there'll be somebody oh it might not be many but there will be somebody it's guaranteed there'll be a few you see and I'm going to read one more quote and I'm going to close I promise but you know in some of these scriptures we've read wow the prophet said things that aren't preached in message churches today but the prophets preached them you know amen he's talking about this parable about before you would build a tower or go to war that you would consider the cost before you would build it or consider the amount of the war and watch how he answers this and he said now the first thing I want you to notice closely this is an enticing Spirit 55. he said the first thing I want you to notice closely is that this is a parable you know what that means it's a fleshly talk about spiritual things amen so he's talking fleshly and it will apply In the Flesh don't build the house unless you know you can finish it but but but it's got a greater meaning and you know what that greater meaning is make sure you when you start your Christian watch you can finish it it may make sure you have the Holy Ghost so you know he will carry He will carry you through make sure you put the token over your family so until they get the Holy Ghost it will carry them through and make sure you follow all the scriptures of the word of God and then the Holy Ghost is obligated to do what the flesh never uh-huh he said now if a king was twenty thousand soldiers and he was fighting up against 10 he said first he'd sit down and see whether he can he said for whom you would not forsake all cannot be his disciples if you can't forsake everything you can't be his disciples now I want to just drop to here's the prophet it's a prayer and he said heavenly father he said I know us you know all things regarding the person of man and what the man is and thou are mindful of him and you made him man and he's just the flower of the fields and today he's beautiful and tomorrow he'll be cut down and cast into the oven and wilted away now that's good for all of us and I pray Lord to thee to be merciful to us today to let each one of us take inventory that's pretty good advice take inventory and we're here in the house of correction and we're here to learn this is the prophet talking this is I believe he's in a church we're in the house of correction and we're here to learn and know how to live now wait a minute that's what the Holy Ghost was for I'm confused well that's what the people say that don't want to fight for Ministry oh now I'm not confused see they have a problem with headship they have a problem with coming together and being brothers and sisters and buddies they have a problem with going fishing together or whatever they do you see they have a problem with living with one another like sister Patty was out this week and she was finding some nice things at one of my favorite stores for the Mennonite stories you know I love those places and she called my wife to see if she could get me something and Luanne said oh she said we're spreading fertilizer on the wheat and sister Patty said well do you want me to pray for you and my wife said no it's going good don't pray oh what what's but now now that's a joke but that's kind of how brother Dale thinks because see when I'm thinking currently minded well I got everything under control look out there's a deer coming up you soon won't have it under control but see but if like if we just have like see if we just have no opinion and it's just God that's how that's how a pastor should be with this church see you're not mine you're Christ and so whether you come or not it's all about Christ it's not about me like you see but see what the problem is pastors have low self-esteem so if you stop coming they're like but that but where was God in that picture see God had a better place for them to go maybe a better pastor but oh but I was thinking oh oh I see yeah yeah and we're here to learn and know how we should live and let it come forth from the word of God today oh Eternal God hallelujah your children here for years but as that we come back to the house of God to learn and he repeats himself why does he repeat himself because you knew I was gonna God knew I was going to read this today and we come back to the house of God to learn and now he declarifies that he's in the house of God remember I said I think he's in church to learn and to know but but the Holy Spirit does all my teaching I mean I just sit on the couch and get a coffee and God just well that might happen too but the Bible also says forsake not to something of yourself together and all the more as you see the wars and the bombs Fallen because uh in like manner that some did because see God seen the coaches ahead of time and the prophets amen you don't think that the prophets in the old time seen the cards the Chariots with with fires lights going out racing down the 401 they've seen that in the Bible it's wrote right in the Bible just like that they've seen the courage but they were horses and chariots it's just it's just just well it's just God it's just Supernatural it's just amazing that God is so beautiful all-knowing and then people think that we're just going to get there by chance oh my goodness but see God wants you he wants to know amen see in Revelation it said the wife it didn't say the Holy Ghost it said the wife oh the Holy Ghost no the wife has made herself ready and I your servant desire to know more about you this is the prophet talking about God and he said I pray that you'll bring the inspiration of the Gospel upon us today and upon your servant and that your presence will inspire us through this building and will be so great today that we'll leave with our hearts Desiring to be better Servants of yours and that will Prof profitable and it'll be profitable for us to have come to church all merciful god Grant this blessing in Jesus name and and the title was enticing spirits how Satan says oh it's all right brother Matt you know it's all right if you know let's stand let's stand oh I'm sorry I I hope there was something yeah amen I I really believe that we serve an awesome God and and I know that God's got everything in control and even when brother Dale makes a mistake God still got it in control but I believe God still wants us to obey his word and do all the instructions that he showed us and then he will do what you couldn't do man you you raise up a child you train him teach them and you correct them and then God takes over man you come to church and you listen to the fivefold ministry and then God takes over it's not what the faithful Ministry says it's how God takes over but God wanted both we surrender ourselves to each other all including the faithful Ministry and then God takes over amen it's just beautiful how it comes together but we can't take out a peace and go die down it won't work no that won't work and and you know the situation and the world it's taken out a few pieces a few pieces amen God help us God help me God help me I I you know what I went you can play something honey I don't want to be known as radical I don't want to be known that one I don't desire to be looked at as uh not fitting in I don't desire that but I'm more concerned about fitting in with my Holy Spirit my Lord Jesus if I fit in really good with him and it means I don't kind of fit in to all the little clicks around here I I can I'm going to deal with that I'm going to deal with that I I just want to close with this I want to tell you Satan is a liar and he is uh he's a slicker and he'll come in just hairs hairy hairs just hairs and the next thing you know you'll be a million miles from God
