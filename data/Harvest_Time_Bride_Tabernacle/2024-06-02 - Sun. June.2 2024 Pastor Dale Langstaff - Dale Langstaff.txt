thank you all amen hallelujah just uh pray I know Jeff and dla are on their way they're just not here yet so it'll be all right if they come in late I believe they will have drove the farthest amen and just a couple of announcements we want to make we have a a new poster there for John Simon's uh uh uh meetings next weekend and it has on it who's preaching it's on the table and also I I had started to come this way with a poster and it got left in one of the vehicles but there's also young people meetings at John denas this weekend and I believe it's a husband and wife coming from I think New Zealand or somewhere I've never seen them but there's young people meetings there Friday and Saturday um so we just encourage you to be a part of anything that you can be amen and and uh I apologize for the poster not being up for John danz I actually thought it was or I would have printed it again and it got left in one of the vehicles but that was not on purpose amen amen and so we just uh uh we still are undecided we me and Lan ourselves possibly might not be here next Sunday but that's subject to the weather you just have to understand where we live we don't have our crops in yet and uh so uh we're invited to a lunch in for a retirement for John Simons and so uh you know if we're away brother Junior will be ministering amen but uh that that may or may not happen but it'll just be me and my wife so amen amen let's just look into God's word and you know that song was so beautiful we're going to read John 3:3 and then we're going to turn to Ezekiel 36 and 26 and you know brother Braham said in in the Lamb of and the dove he said the hardest thing we'll do is surrender to the leadership of the holy spirit amen the more that you can humble yourself and let God in and take control he said the people it's the hardest thing the people can do he said they can't let the Holy Spirit and their heads or their hearts they just they just are so used to you know leading that they can't let god god Jehovah the Holy Spirit lead them you know and you know he he said another one I have some of these on my phone I just printed just even God leading and things as we were driving to church he said you know the cause for misunderstanding is because you go by your experience rather than by the word of God that's in the suurus church Age series he said the reason that anybody would have a misunderstanding in the body of Christ is because you're judging by your past experience and not by God's word God help us as we look into his word and and we're going to look into many many things and this will be one of probably part two or three for sure and this is something that is just uh just come to me and and I can't I can't leave it away and some of this I I actually had four messages started in my iPad separately some of them were from over a month ago and just God dealing with us and you know we're going to go on a route rapure and we're going to go into Rapture very soon and he's only coming for a mature wife and so this other little Kitty stuff and the dolls and the coloring books we got to lay aside amen Jesus answered and said unto them verily verily I say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Amen these were people coming to see Jesus and let's turn over to Ezekiel 36 and 26 and this was powerful and this explains the whole problem that's in the church today and and in the message for sure and and you know I I pray to God that he will re reveal himself to you individually and and help us in a special way this morning amen God help us T not you know Paul said in the New Testament he said I fear that by the subd of Satan that he'll come in in and you will preach a different Jesus and you know and I I preached some of those sermons long back and a year ago and that but this is the same kind of sedu that Satan will do and let's read this scripture a new heart also I'll give thee and a new spirit I'll put into you and I'll take away the Stony heart and I'll put I'll take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh Lord Jesus we pray that you'll bless your word and bless your people and Lord May everything be done and said according to your will your leading and Lord we we invite you to be the Unseen guest here we invite you to be the scene guest Lord God where you break the Word of Life to your people we pray in Jesus name amen amen you may have your SE this morning you know brother Brown mentioned this in the message up multiple times in the scripture in Ezekiel and you know he he mentioned it so much he said most people in the church today get a new spirit and they believe they have the Holy Spirit and they're deceived now he mentioned that mult dozens and dozens and dozens of times connected to this scripture and you can always tell somebody that has the the wrong Spirit or doesn't have the Holy Spirit because they'll have a problem with the word of God Amen they'll have a problem with the word of God and however it's delivered amen and so many people brother B said that he had to give you a new spirit to get along with yourself he said he had to give you a new spirit to get along with the Holy Spirit and he said people stop before they go all the way in the experience and they stop with the new experience because it made you a better person but it didn't make you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and we see that no man shall inherit the Kingdom of Heaven see the kingdom of God and people ask brother Braham who will be there and he said if you came from God and you know Junior mentioned last week Sunday you know the word of God was in Mary you know and but the same word of God is in each one of us brother brah said that when he created Christ his son that it was the logos that went out from God and he said today we call it the theop but he said when he created you it was the exact same identical logos you either are a part of him or you ain't nothing at all amen God help us to be a part of God but we know that if we're a part of him we will fit in with them and Dov tail amen and God cannot refuse his word God will not deny his word it it's impossible how could Christ deny Christ come on now anointed one that's not a possibility and I'm going to share many things I actually put I put uh if we get that far and if we don't it'll be next week but I actually put up 10 pictures that I'm going to show in the screen quotes because because they're just unbelievable quotes that that you're going to you're going to think that brother Dale's went uh cucko you know I heard a minister when we started the church about 10 years ago and I listened to a message on absolute and a minister was preaching a very popular minister the states and he was preaching on the absolute and I said to myself back then 10 years ago I said you know if I preached that in my church everybody would leave now back then it only would have been my family and two or three other people but because see they were gauged on worship of each other they would accept it from a minister that had been in the message for 30 years and had 300 people in his church but the same holy H spirit in a new minister they wouldn't take it amen and brother Brown never taught it like that amen you either are he or you aren't he you are either are she or you aren't she you know and I love the gospel that don't put big eyes and little eyes and little yous and you know if we just all humble oursel and become you know the Bible says that if we become like children be like children you will see the kingdom of heaven sure and I'm just going to tell you something you're having a hard time being children and so am I because it's just not our makeup it's it's it's just not amen what God is talking about here about being children he's not talking about immaturity he's talking about just simply believe just simply take it you see a child has no experiences on their own so what they hear and what they see they believe amen that's why we're not supposed to light your Earth children that's why we don't talk about Santa Claus cuz he's a fake that's why don't talk about all these lies that the world accepts today because when they grow up and they say you lied to me when I was five you're still lying to me when I'm 15 amen those are make that's that's nothing but Satan trying to take Glory that's meant for God turning Santa Claus into somebody that only Jesus would know Divine that he knows what you want for Christmas he knows whether whether you've been good or naughty that's ridiculous that's that's insanity and the world gobbles it up right God have mercy on us how far have we went amen God have mercy on us Amen Let me just lay mention a couple of these quotes just to lay a foundation because they're they're hard to believe amen he said the Bible said that he'd give you a new heart and he'd give you a new spirit and many people even the Pentecostal people and the Full Gospel people have been deceived in that many times God said I'll give you a new spirit and he said that isn't his Spirit that's right that's in the hidden Life of Christ he said you'll notice another par another quote he said and the god being the first thing you take away is the old Stony heart and you'll receive he said I'll give you a new spirit he said that ain't his holy spirit that's in impersonating of Christianity we got the greatest impersonating of Christianity going on in the ranks of this message that you've ever seen in your born life that's why we have different camps amen that's impersonation of Christianity if we all got the same God and we're all going to the same heaven and there ain't going to be categories and rooms and uh you know lounges and man you you we we we we think of Heaven as like the Titanic the poor people were in the B them they drown the first class that's disgusting what kind of a holywood are we worshiping amen God help us he said you know in John 141 John 1413 uh 16 to1 18 sorry John 14 16- 18 and I pray the father that he'll give you another comforter and that he may abide with you forever and even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because he seeth him not neither knoweth him not but ye know him for he dwell in you there's the key part and shall be with you and he will not leave you comfortless for I will come unto you God help us in this time this last age you know this last age is right at the end where so many people will fall away and it's because they're looking on their experiences and they're understanding and they're going to be lost you know in the past month or so month and a half we had a lot of new people come through the church and ministers and even visitors and we all carry spirits and by God's grace you know part of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is discernment amen and I can I mean by God's grace let me let me say it this way it's a better way to say God can pick up aony a mile away amen that's right and God can give that to each one of us amen here he said let's just still laying a foundation for our thought now he said what's happening to the church is is received the seventh seal book and the revelation of Jesus Christ and not one now this is a direct quote and he said not one tenth of you can receive it that's in paragraph 179 and 61 after the seals of Revelations of of chapter 5 part two he said and we've received the opening of the seventh seal book and it's a revelation of Jesus Christ and not one tenth of you can receive it so now this actually gives the picture of the entire Bible and the seals that that the Bible had hid from the eyes of the wi and proof and God Did It by his Holy Spirit open them up revealing them right through the Bible glory to God God help us that we're the one t that can receive the revelation of Jesus Christ God God help us you know in John 5 here here they were and maybe we'll read it John 536 and 39 it just still I'm I'm trying to lay a foundation here we want to talk about we want to talk about deity and we want to talk about worship and we want to talk about Christ the anointed one John 5:36 but I have a greater witness than John for the works that the father hasth given me to finish and the same works that I do bear witness of me that the father has sent me and 37 and the father himself which has sent me hath bore witness of me ye have neither heard his voice at any time neither seen his shape verse 38 and ye have not his words abiding in you for whom he has sent him ye believe not he's talking about himself that's he's not talking about John he's talking about Christ the people had not receiv received the anointed one the Christ and he says verse 39 search the scriptures for in them you think you're a message believer eternal life and they are they which testify of me how can it how can you believe which receive honor watch this one of another and seek not the honor that Cometh From God you know every one of us have been guilty of you know it's just human nature that we want to be accepted we want to fit in we want to be I want friends myself I don't want to be a dead old grouchy man like brother Brown talked about it I don't want to have that Spirit when I become old but we need to have approval and honor from God H than honor from man and man's always seeking this honor from each other but what about God Amen God help us God help us here he's talking about the same Spirit and the new spirit and I'm just just to go faster I have a paragraph well here we we'll say in the do doors in a door he said he said you join a church he said I'm as good as you he said see I've accepted Christ he said maybe that's just what you've done now watch watch watch how he breaks this down he said you've accepted Christ we've accepted the message we've accepted the anointed word for our day he said you've ex accepted Christ and maybe that's just what you've done but did you make him your Lord that's a difference see and now the Lord can't sit down in the Book of Rules and say the word and then come around and deny it he said if you say that you got the Holy Ghost and the Bible says a certain thing to do and you say well I don't believe that he said just remember that the the spirit that's in you is not the holy spirit cuz it can't deny itself that's right he said he can't deny himself he wrote the word he watches over it and he'll perform it see so it's not the holy spirit that you got he said it's a spirit all right and it might be a spirit in the church and it might be the spirit of the pastor and it might be the spirit of the world and it it might be I don't know what it would be but it's not the Holy Spirit Hallelujah Matthew 13:10 And1 and the disciples came unto him saying saying unto him he said why speak ye in Parables and he answered and said unto them and I love this I could preach for eternity on this one because it is given unto you to know Hallelujah you should lose your mind on this scripture because it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it's not given Hallelujah here you know we see so I want to just show you some things that that we're blessed with in our day you know and and then we're going to go into our actual test text we we see in this day that we're blessed we understand deity and we understand that deity isn't in heaven alone but it's tabernacled in this building and it's Tabernacle in each one that has the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it wasn't just in the same deity that was in Christ is in each one of us with the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and he said you know they came to brother brandham and they asked him and they said what should we call you this this big shot came to brother brandham and he said sorry I'm ahead of myself there he said if we had the sa wh watch this I want to show you the deity forgive me I want to show you the deity how The Same Spirit he said and the spirit of the Holy Spirit would say let there be light and there was light and he said let there be trees and he and he did the whole creation let there be in the creation and he said that same mind that was in Christ is in use with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said so how much more could you say Let there not be cancer let there not be blindness upon my eyes Let Let The Healing in my body be so that's the SP spoken word today in our midst you know when Jesus went to the garden and he was praying to Jehovah and they said well who he praying to he was praying to himself because Christ was Tabernacle Jehovah he wasn't praying to a far away God and this morning if God's tabernacled in our flesh we're not praying to a far away God we don't have to look up or look down or look sideways and we don't have to get a big shot amen anybody that's tab on deity you can speak the word just like Jehovah himself did let there be light Let There Be trees let there be a lion let that cancer in my wife be gone Hallelujah that's spoken word and it's right in our midst and you don't have to get a big shot evangelist you don't have to because it's Tabernacle in each one of us that's right amen and you watch this he said Hallelujah here Jesus talking about he said I do nothing but the father show me he's he's bringing it back to Christ the Holy Spirit the father and he and he said you shall have it he said it's not me he said you shall have it that power that was given to the bride it's the Holy Ghost filled in the church that's right Hallelujah but it comes by the revelation of Christ and understanding positionally who you are amen everything we believe and teach points to Christ deity Amen Let Let me just read some examples of the Prophet just quickly he said but there's only one thing that our being here is centered around and that's Jesus Christ so God let us lay aside everything secondary and hold on to him Hallelujah we see here because God blessed us with a prophet and our day and and and you revealed the Mysteries that was already in the Bible it wasn't a new Bible they were there all along but we didn't understand them and we were confused like everybody in the world and they would go to cemetery school for years and they would come out and be dumber than when they went because they just took a man's ideas and so we see in our day we understand the the the the perfectly the word of God we understand the four first writers in Revelations we understand that that was Satan's mask and when Satan comes in like a flood God will raise up a standard against him we understand that true baptism of the Holy Ghost it's a part of God brother Brown said that God literally ripped himself in the day of Pentecost ripped himself apart giving licks of fire upon each one of you Hallelujah we understand the true godhead amen we understand true baptism we understand true one God one Lord and one Christ we understand the baptism we understand Grace without it being to disgrace that if you came from God and we understand eternity that there was no eternal hell that if you were Eternal if you're Eternal this morning if you believe you got eternal life you always were Eternal because anything that's Eternal never had a beginning so we I was in the mind of God when he created the heavens Earth I was in the mind before he created the heavens and the Earth Hallelujah we understand this we understand the history Babylon the we understand all these amazing things and that don't take away that's because God brought it and he revealed himself listen you know when you're coming into a marriage and you're in engagement and and you know it's just a few weeks or few days before the wedding if you got any brains at all you're going to reveal everything to your wife or your husband if you want any kind of a marriage at all if she's your rib or your or he's your rib there will be nothing that you won't talk about the day before the wedding this is exactly what Christ did to us as bride his wife is he's revealing everything because he knows that we're at a moment of time a twinkling of an eye he's going to come and reveal himself totally we understand the mystery of Christ the same yesterday today and forever there's nothing that happened in the past that can't happen here this morning than amen we understand the history of the blindness of the Israelites so we could be grafted in the 144,000 Amazing Grace Hallelujah multiple multiple Mysteries that we understand we need to not take these for granted amen God help us God help us to understand that we're blessed blessed beyond measure but because of all these blessings you you know Satan hangs around where there's honey there's always a lot of flies where there's a smell and we got the honey this morning and so everything that's related to Satan we're Shing off amen we're shoing off remember the prophet was shoing off in the Bible Peter was going to Sho it off all the the the evil stuff that was coming in amen God help us as we sh off these imitators of Christ these Slickers you know our Prophet clearly taught us that Satan wasn't something that you could recognize come on on you can recognize it if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you know what I'm saying it wasn't like obvious uhhuh God help us you know as we go through this I want to show you multiple things that God used in the Bible and because the people were people God had to rip them down yeah amen hallelujah in the Bible in numbers 21 5-9 and we're not going to read it but God has a servant Moses put up a serpent a bronze serpent so the people were dying because they were getting bit and he said no matter where you are in the earth if you just you didn't have to see it if you just look towards it see you know Jonah and the whale never seen the serpent but he looked towards it he seen it by faith and was saved and so was the the city amen but we see that Moses raised up this this uh this uh Serpent and God sent another Prophet along to tear it down because the very thing that God was using the people went to worship the actual bronze Serpent and Spirits don't change you know let me give you an example you said you know every artist that's paintings are worth like 10 million not one of them's alive you got to die before you're valuable it's kind of like a farmer when you die you're valuable but until then you're just flat broke amen but anything's valuable you know people will say all kinds of nice things before you die or when you die when they're walk oh you know he was the greatest amen our Prophet talked about he said why don't we give flowers when we're alive why don't you say hey they're the greatest today today but we're in a competition well he can be the grace if I'm the grace but when they die there's no competition no more amen hallelujah we also see in the the Bible where in numbers 20 where God Called Moses at the burning bush and when God Called Moses in the burning bush in verse seven or eight he commanded Moses to take his rod and when Moses went to Egypt everything he did was through the rod everything until he came to the wife stage oh hang with me here they were going to the promised land this ain't my home praise God I'm going to a Promised Land too and it's called heaven and so right before they were going into the promised land god changed his mask and he told Moses he said speak to the Rock and Moses worshiped the rod I'll say it for you amen you don't think you would worship thy rod Moses had seen that rod turned from serpent but in the but in the Tabernacle he had seen it hang over the water part the Red Sea he had seen it drop down and turn to a serpent then his Rod actually ate the other serpents I mean Moses was hello is anybody with me I mean that Rod had done some pretty Supernatural things I'll guarantee you brother B gave me a stick for a walking stick and it's amazing but if it did high for the rod that Mo brother Moses did I wouldn't keep it in the garage i' put it in the gun safe hello because Moses worshiped the rod th God himself told him to bring [Music] it cost them going into the promised land physically and so also in our day we can move ahead and I could give you scriptures for all that I'm just literally swiping by those scriptures amen the same thing happened in our day and this is so easy for us to see cuz we can just see this one some of the other ones you know sometimes it's easier to see all the flaws in everybody else's life but when we get a married you know it's the mirrors you know you know I I was just reading a thing you know the people moved in a new neighborhood and the wife was always complaining about the neighbors hanging out dirty laundry and the one morning they said wow they must got a new washer husband said no I got up early and wash the windows they were clean all along but when we look in the mirror and we see oursel we need some wind deex cuz we see that God used Mary in the Bible and she was highly favored among women oh yeah highly favored and the Catholic church has turned her into a god call her the actual Eternal mother of Jehovah amen now that's a very easy one for us to see but we have the same Spirit around us daily amen I know I'll say ouch for you ouch Hallelujah let me read some things that our Prophet said would that be all right I want to tell you something we had a minister here a month or so ago and I mentioned it on Wednesday night he quoted the prophet and when I went home I said I like that quote he looked two or three hours he couldn't find it I'll tell you something that won't happen this morning guarantee you I had these quotes you might not like them but I still have them amen and send at the door and knock he said then look to God and don't look at a man he said God don't want to show me that's the prophet he said he wants to show himself see we had a man come by here a month or so ago and I can tell you exactly he was a prophet worshipper cuz see if you follow the word you're obeying that's right you know what did what the did the prophet tell Saul he said obedience is better than sacrifice what did the prophet say you know I I know I you know I I I I know there's situations and I know but you know the prophet said he said if I was living some place and there wasn't a church that had all the truth I would go to a denominational church he he says it like this he says if they just believe that Jesus was God or the Lord if I had to spit all the other pets out I would still attend church so the outside world knew when sight I was on but message Believers don't believe that no absolutely not bless God the prophets my my pastor and you know he's going to marry and bury me and they're still doing that they're coming out with the tape family which is Straight From Hell the the very anointed Prophet said that God would not use no mechanical devices he could have used a donkey or you know any other animal he used a donkey to talk to a prophet one time but he chose he could have used the lights and the the Sun and all these other things but he chose man man we have multiple scriptures to show that God's the same yesterday today and forever but we'll see that where the honey is that's where all the things gather we we have to recognize that and we have to be able to separate the difference amen amen here he said in the seventh seal he said and we went to be a gem we want to be a gem in the crown of Jesus Christ and we don't want to never put man in it he said forget anything about me he said I'm your brother he said I'm a sinner saved by grace Amy if you put up that one that I said was hard to see is it hard to see it's about the ninth he said I'm a sinner saved by grace not fit to live that's exactly the truth I can't say that I'm not saying that to be humble that's the facts there's nothing in me not one sound thing at all Allelujah see now I showed you already that our Prophet was a Vindicated prophet and all the mysteries of the Bible have been revealed because of him through Christ using him but where the honey is there'll be a lot of other fuzzy plants this is the only one that's at small so I I apologize for that he said and the the the third from the top now I'm reading the third paragraph from the top he said now see I've always asked you to be careful who you're listening to he's talking about himself he said because there's so much of Just The Human Side but always if there's something that goes forth I'll say thus sayith the Lord do you know the Bible says that you know many people people are preaching that every single word the prophet preached is a Bible King James version if that was the case brother Brown said his name would be taken over the Lamb's Book of Life because you couldn't add to or take away from Brother Brown didn't add or change the Bible the Bible was all here perfectly he just by divine inspiration and anointing of God explained the Mysteries that we brother they had no clue the smartest doctor in the world never had a clue because this was God and it took God to show take the mask off and show who it was and he used the man brother Brown and we are the greatest age this age greatest age the great all the mysteries in this age all the Mysteries completely revealed don't misunderstand me you can't leave what you are this is everything I'm not talking about that but I have lots of scriptures where God says that I'm a jealous God and there's no other oh amen that's God help us amen he let's go to the next verse and I want to show you something you I mentioned about deity there's a thing here I want to show you in the second last verse there number eight he said like the woman that touched Jesus garment he said he didn't know who she was or what was wrong with her do you know what healed the woman that touched Jesus garment I know you're think thinking it was Jesus you're wrong Faith thank you it was her faith it's your faith you operate the gift of Jehovah you're you're putting yourself down you're down and you're stepping on your head amen no we're talking about Jehovah Christ amen come on now Hallelujah he said when now when Jesus spoke back to her it was thus says the Lord see Jesus recognized your facei what did a prophet say he said I'm operating it's your faith that operates the Visions it's your faith that calls praying to God God I need something and that's amazing when you listen to the tapes I it just drives just Thrills my heart to death you know when you listen to brother Brandon and listen to tapes and there's people that would sit down there and say you know pray for my daughter pray for my wife something like that and they justay 5 seconds I mean that's high-speed internet and it went Heaven went through all the politics in heaven and went right to the white Throne judgment and he came down and now he's dealing with a human person watch the power of God now it did I was just joking about the politics and you know what I'm saying but it went through all that it went to God your prayer your prayer not the prophet's prayer your prayer your prayer I mean it could have been the prophet's prayer but anybody's prayer and he God came back and anointed a man and he had to consider the thought and he spoke it out and it took 5 Seconds Hallelujah and you don't believe in miracles oh my goodness become a miracle accept the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you'll be a miracle you'll see a miracle you'll get a mirror and look at it said I'm a miracle I'm Tabernacle and deity oh this is so much more than a religion God help us God help us understand what he's doing Amen in our day I want to read some quotes from our Prophet amen and this is in no way I'm now these are what our Prophet said and a bunch of them I'm going to put up there this first one is I don't have but you get ready for the first one Amy he said he's the only one thing for you to see and that glorifies Christ he said it makes no difference a real true Mount Transfiguration experience only glorifies Jesus Christ listen I I want to just intersect something CU I feel something this morning brother Dale didn't choose to preach this this morning it took me six weeks I'm wrestling god this message is the truth but there's a lot of bugs hanging around this message that are a million miles from the truth there's a lot of people standing in pulpits that say they're quoting something and when you go to the after and ask for the quote they'll try to find it two hours later amen they're phony he said if it don't glorify he said it what he's talking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost still reading this this is the Easter seal this is right before he 65 he said it didn't glorify Moses it didn't glorify Elijah and it don't glorify themselves it didn't glorify nothing else but they seen the glorification of Jesus Christ and any True Believer that's in his heart that's all he's concerned about is glorifying Jesus Christ you can put the first one that's that's not it the one I just read this is the first one Amy amen I I apologize for being so honest but you know brother Brown said a pastor will carry the doctrine for the church and this is the truth this is the message of the hour but remember the message of the hour has all the Cannons of Satan pointing on them amen he he don't have to point the Cannons where there ain't no truth there there ain't no cannons pointing there he's already got them watch here the down this the red in the second paragraph he said now I I have nothing against the voice of God healing but the trouble with the voice of God healing is it's got away from it is it glorifies brother Bram the man because they put his writings in there instead of Christ Christ is what we want to glorify yes brother Pam was a Vindicated Prophet I know that well I wouldn't know nothing without him I couldn't even preach without him amen not the Mysteries he said this man is a tent and they out seat this L one and this one o seats outline that's you know what he's talking
