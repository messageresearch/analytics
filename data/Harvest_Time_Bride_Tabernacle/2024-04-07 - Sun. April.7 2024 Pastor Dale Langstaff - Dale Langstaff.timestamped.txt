[29:59] of something in my Ministry it will be
[30:00] bringing caution and warning to us that
[30:04] the rapture's close if I if I'm going to
[30:06] have a fault I'll just lean that way
[30:08] call me an extremist crazy man or
[30:10] something because I don't ever want to
[30:12] get there and see one of you come up and
[30:14] say well you know if I would have knew
[30:15] it was really that close really that
[30:19] close it's really that close it's really
[30:23] that
[30:24] close don't be deceived by our our
[30:27] lifestyle in our modern technology and
[30:31] and stuff that's around us it can be a
[30:34] blessing and and and we need to live I
[30:37] understand that just uh just a little
[30:41] preview of of Wednesday night amen it's
[30:46] been a a blessing to me amen and uh you
[30:50] know our we read a quote I'm not going
[30:51] to reread them just a short clips is
[30:54] that is that all right just brother Bram
[30:56] said that you would see God in
[30:58] everything in
[30:59] nature and because of our modern
[31:01] lifestyle we are removed from nature and
[31:03] we're like the kids that say well mount
[31:05] comes from the grocery store and brown
[31:07] mount comes from a brown cow and and you
[31:10] know uh like cuz we're removed from the
[31:15] Natural
[31:17] Life The Prophet said that if the the
[31:20] Christians the Believers had not watched
[31:23] the skies during jesus' time they would
[31:25] have never known that he was coming to
[31:27] bethle
[31:29] but this time he's not coming to
[31:30] Bethlehem
[31:32] only he's coming in a grand Rapture and
[31:36] it will be like the saint now you think
[31:38] about that he said if the Christians
[31:40] then had to watch the skies and they
[31:43] would have been so modern that they were
[31:46] watching our iPads and computers which
[31:48] are are not evil in
[31:51] themselves they would have never had
[31:54] wise men come to Jesus and they would
[31:56] have never had the shepherd
[31:58] come to Jesus which was part of his plan
[32:00] and you know there's some amazing things
[32:03] and and I'm not you know we don't
[32:04] brother Dale don't know the day and if I
[32:07] did I'm a
[32:08] liar um that's what the Bible says but
[32:11] we are in the season I'm looking I'm
[32:14] looking for a land called Bula I'm I'm
[32:17] consumed with
[32:19] it I'm beside
[32:21] myself and you're not going to find it
[32:24] in another country not even another good
[32:26] country I'm I'm consumed with it we're
[32:29] going to find it in glory amen and you
[32:32] know uh just a just a just carry on
[32:34] Wednesday night's thought you know there
[32:36] was a ship that hit the the the major uh
[32:39] bridge in the states and the there was a
[32:42] painter that's dead now and past you
[32:45] know God God spoke through a donkey in
[32:47] the Bible because a prophet wouldn't
[32:48] listen to him you know so am man he
[32:52] don't don't put God in your box say you
[32:54] know that's a little far out there
[32:56] because he's still Jehovah amen and this
[32:59] painter's dad this painter painted six
[33:01] bridges that were all broken half two of
[33:04] them had ships running into them and the
[33:06] name of the ship wrote The Anthem for
[33:09] the states which is the fall of the
[33:11] states which is falling in the river so
[33:14] the states has fallen their national
[33:16] anthem has fallen and just this week God
[33:20] sent lightning habol to lightning down
[33:22] to the Statue of Li Liberty and it was
[33:26] photographed the very same week that
[33:29] Biden's pulling back from
[33:31] Israel the states has
[33:33] fallen and the one painting that was set
[33:37] up on that bridge that was painting was
[33:39] the falling bridge and the ladder to
[33:41] heaven the falling bridge was making a
[33:44] ladder to heaven and the exact time that
[33:47] the the boat hit the bridge there's is
[33:50] the exact date that a movie's coming out
[33:52] that's the end of the
[33:54] world that might not mean nothing might
[33:57] not mean nothing
[33:58] nothing but God's still

[37:15] to read
[37:16] another scripture maybe uh just up above
[37:20] that let's just move up to verse uh 2
[37:23] and four in the same chapter there Amy
[37:26] first uh second second Peter 1 2 and 4
[37:29] Grace and peace be multiplied unto you
[37:31] through the knowledge of God and our
[37:33] Lord Jesus Christ according to as his
[37:35] divine power has given unto us all
[37:38] things that pertaineth unto life and
[37:40] godliness though through the knowledge
[37:42] of him that hath called
[37:44] us to glory and virtue therefore whereby
[37:49] sorry are given unto us exceeding great
[37:53] that's pretty good and precious promises
[37:57] that by by these you might be
[37:59] partakers that means not viewers only
[38:02] partakers partakers of the divine nature
[38:06] having escaped the corruption that is in
[38:09] the world by lust Hallelujah beautiful
[38:14] scriptures that God had to us you know I
[38:16] want to preach on partakers this morning
[38:19] and I want to preach on title it the day
[38:21] of the Lord this morning and I want to
[38:23] just lay a foundation you know brother
[38:25] Brown talked about this you know we are
[38:28] the children of
[38:30] light and you know totally we believe in
[38:32] predestination and election and all
[38:34] these things and they're the greatest
[38:36] promises in the Bible there's nothing
[38:37] better than that but but we are affected
[38:41] by our Badger skin and you know we're
[38:45] going to talk about worship some this
[38:47] morning and
[38:48] noise amen and brother bam says it like
[38:52] this and I I'm going to this is a little
[38:53] bit longer quote and I'm just going to
[38:55] slow down and read it and then we'll
[38:57] move on and we'll preach amen the least
[39:00] little bit of light will expose
[39:03] Darkness certainly that's the way life
[39:05] does it in the presence of death and
[39:07] that's the way it is that's the way
[39:10] right does in the presence of wrong
[39:14] that's why Faith does in the presence of
[39:17] doubt and it scatters it away and how
[39:21] can you the night stay here when the sun
[39:24] is shining her blessings through where
[39:27] does the night
[39:30] go it is no more what happens to the
[39:34] night where's the darkness this
[39:36] Tabernacle about 12 hours ago was
[39:38] completely dark but where's the darkness
[39:42] now he said it's concealed inside these
[39:45] walls here it is no more it's vanished
[39:48] why the light has come in and when the
[39:51] light comes in the darkness goes yes sir
[39:53] and he said you take the creatures now
[39:55] we're going to get down to ourself now
[39:57] now if if we're the creatures of
[40:00] light we it's just going to be nature
[40:03] that you're going to be
[40:05] light but if you're the creatures of
[40:07] Darkness you're going to be like the
[40:09] crotch roaches and The Beetles and all
[40:11] the animals that when you come in and
[40:13] flick on the
[40:14] light they scatter and so is it exactly
[40:18] the
[40:20] same when the presence of God and the
[40:23] word of
[40:24] God comes on the scene
[40:29] if you don't feel
[40:31] comfortable when somebody's getting
[40:37] blessed if you don't feel comfortable
[40:40] when the word of God and the revelation
[40:42] of God is coming through that was given
[40:44] in this
[40:45] day that we've come into everything in
[40:48] the word is ours the fullness of the
[40:50] word and we're coming to the Statue of
[40:52] the perfect man and if some you know our
[40:54] brother I kind of got this anointing you
[40:56] know when our brother was here he was
[40:58] preaching on uh you know maturity and
[41:00] and and coming up into full
[41:03] adoption and you can see it by our
[41:05] actions and reactions and I want to look
[41:08] at a scripture as we look into this so
[41:10] let's watch this he said they the
[41:11] creatures of night scatter and when the
[41:13] when the sunshine raises and the light
[41:15] flashes how they take to the darkness
[41:17] that's the way the gospel is he said
[41:20] when it flashes on them what happens to
[41:22] those who want to be called The Holy
[41:25] Roller he said if they're dark Darkness
[41:27] they'll Flee for the night and make fun
[41:30] of it he said because their
[41:33] children of
[41:38] darkness and the children of the day
[41:40] will walk right in to thy presence he
[41:43] said and the children of Light by the
[41:47] grace of God so when the light flashes
[41:49] on us we thank God that we walk with our
[41:51] eyes open looking at the things that we
[41:54] can see with our natural eyes and for by
[41:56] faith
[41:57] is the substance of things that we hope
[41:59] for and the
[42:00] evidence of things that we cannot see
[42:04] you know there was a story in the Bible
[42:06] talked about a message believer and he
[42:08] was connected to the message truth of
[42:11] his day and he wanted to be connected to
[42:13] the prophet of the day so he invited
[42:15] them over to his
[42:18] house but he was a children of
[42:21] darkness and so he had only done it for
[42:24] popularity for different reasons he had
[42:27] invited the parit of the day
[42:29] over this was
[42:31] Jesus and he came in his house and there
[42:33] was a sinner woman that came in his
[42:37] house that had a terrible life and a
[42:39] terrible
[42:40] story and she came and she took special
[42:44] ointment and she Anointed The Prophet's
[42:47] feet Jesus feet Jehovah's
[42:50] feet and she cried over his feet and it
[42:53] made the person of night
[43:01] uncomfortable wait a minute wait a wait
[43:03] a minute wait a minute that was a
[43:05] message believer he invited the prophet
[43:07] over to his
[43:10] house and Jesus asked this brother a
[43:16] question and I'd like to read that
[43:18] question he said he turned to the woman
[43:20] and said unto Simon he said see us thou
[43:23] This Woman This is Luke 7 sorry Luke
[43:26] 7:44 for where we're at now see is this
[43:29] woman and she washed she's entered into
[43:32] thine house and she G see is this woman
[43:35] and I entered into thy house and thou
[43:38] gavest me no water for my feet you
[43:41] didn't want to worship me you didn't
[43:44] want to really praise me you didn't
[43:47] really want to shout amen and jump up
[43:49] and down you didn't want to run the
[43:55] aisles you sat near the back
[44:01] he said but she has come in your house
[44:03] and she has washed my feet with your
[44:05] tears she has wiped them with her hair
[44:08] of her head thou gavest me watch does he
[44:11] goes back to him now he said you hadn't
[44:14] give him no water he said you didn't
[44:16] give me no
[44:19] kiss he said but this woman since the
[44:22] time that she came in has not
[44:25] ceased to kiss
[44:28] my
[44:30] feet hello this is in Luke by the way to
[44:35] kiss my
[44:37] feet I don't think you heard
[44:40] me that's like foot washing but I've
[44:43] never seen anybody kiss
[44:46] feet foot washing what we're get to the
[44:49] good
[44:53] part and my and she had anointed my head
[44:56] with the oil but this woman has not just
[45:00] anointed my head but anointed my feet
[45:01] also and let's drop to 47 verse 47 and
[45:05] she and he said therefore I say unto
[45:07] thee her sins which were
[45:11] many are
[45:13] forgiven for she loved
[45:16] much there's a reason why we have
[45:20] trouble the reason is because we feel
[45:24] like we were born in the message hear me
[45:26] Church this is Brother Dale too we feel
[45:29] like we've been born in the message and
[45:31] we feel like we live a Holiness life and
[45:33] we don't you know I want to tell you
[45:35] something just on the side view you know
[45:37] if we don't have real we're in we're in
[45:39] big trouble we're lost okay so I'll show
[45:42] you what the the children of Darkness I
[45:44] just just even yesterday I went to see
[45:46] brother Jim yesterday and we were paying
[45:48] at the restaurant you know you know the
[45:51] well I got to be careful because we're
[45:52] online there's a church in sarna that's
[45:57] the next denomination to our
[46:00] church and they have a rock concert
[46:02] coming in this week or soon the tickets
[46:06] are 30 bucks a person or 35 or something
[46:09] rock it says right on Rock it's
[46:11] Pentecostal and the I was paying at the
[46:15] tail and there was a a a singing group
[46:18] there Harmony by Voices was three people
[46:22] and the this is truth bake evangelic
[46:27] ja however I can't talk Church in
[46:30] ch and the one person had an earring in
[46:33] his nose like a like a hog we used to
[46:36] put them in Hogs so they wouldn't hurt
[46:37] the other pigs because it hurt their own
[46:39] nose and the other one had big earrings
[46:43] men you know the B talks about
[46:46] slaves and they're going to the foolish
[46:49] virgin to sing they're going to fake
[46:53] worship because they ain't got real
[46:55] worship but we're the B bride of Christ
[46:59] and we've been forgiven much and the
[47:02] Bible says that the much is given much
[47:05] is required amen and what is required of
[47:09] us is worship amen and I going tell you
[47:13] something it is
[47:16] impossible I believe me I can show you
[47:19] the scripture if God will allow us today
[47:21] we'll get to it it is
[47:24] impossible for the Holy Ghost to come
[47:26] down and noise and disrupt the
[47:29] service it's not possible it's not over
[47:32] not even in church order and
[47:34] Doctrine I've preached in places where
[47:36] people got completely stain slain Stone
[47:39] drunk screaming I'll tell you what you
[47:42] don't need notes when you're preaching
[47:43] in a place like that you talk about the
[47:46] power of almighty God falling on that
[47:51] place I've been in places where people
[47:53] dance or run or jump or and it never
[47:57] side affected me at all it never
[47:59] affected the anointing coming
[48:01] in and if it affected anybody out there
[48:05] it's because you were a child a creature
[48:07] of darkness and you wanted to scatter to
[48:10] the darkness watch what Jesus said here
[48:13] he said to to M to
[48:17] uh for she loveth much but to whom
[48:20] little is
[48:21] Forgiven now now this is God talking
[48:25] here this ain't a prophet no more this
[48:27] is God to whom little is Forgiven the
[48:30] same loveth
[48:32] little that's our problem right there we
[48:35] could go
[48:37] home if you have trouble entering into
[48:40] worship you don't actually believe that
[48:43] Jesus did much for you that's right to
[48:47] whom very little is Forgiven well you
[48:49] know bless God I was a pretty good man
[48:51] and I didn't really have a lot of dark
[48:52] sins you know cuz I didn't go in that
[48:54] way and you know I was near as bad as
[48:56] whoa who who who whoa who who
[48:58] who all have sinned and come short of
[49:02] the glory of God and deserve how Eternal
[49:05] damnation all have sinned even the elect
[49:09] have sinned but predestination saved
[49:14] them here he says here because
[49:19] whom little is Forgiven the same loveth
[49:23] little and he
[49:24] said in verse 48 and he said to her he
[49:29] said thy
[49:30] sins be forgiven thee you see this
[49:35] believer this Philistine that had
[49:38] invited Jesus to his
[49:40] house was rich and increased with Goods
[49:44] he was he had a position in the church
[49:47] he probably was the backup preacher or
[49:49] something and he wanted Jesus to be
[49:52] associated in his fivefold
[49:55] click
[49:59] but he put himself equal with
[50:01] Jesus so he didn't have to wash jesus'
[50:03] feet because Jesus could wash his feet
[50:07] I'm just as good as you you
[50:10] know I got to turn around call her
[50:14] too I'm just so see he put himself equal
[50:18] with God so he didn't lower himself to
[50:21] worship to wash God's feet to give him a
[50:24] kiss or to kiss even his
[50:28] feet now that's
[50:30] humility that's
[50:33] humility I wonder if we have our
[50:37] forgiveness
[50:39] wrong I wonder if we feel like you know
[50:41] the Bible says that no man comes to the
[50:44] father unless the father draws them you
[50:47] know but most most denominations believe
[50:49] that well you know we had a good
[50:51] preacher come in we paid him a lot of
[50:52] money he was a Ben norrod you know and I
[50:55] I decided I was in the the back pew and
[50:57] I wasn't going to go to the altar but
[50:59] you know I made a cud decision this
[51:01] would be a good time to go because you
[51:03] know he's a good preacher and and I I
[51:06] and it was i i i i i i
[51:14] i and God's just like oh my
[51:18] goodness no mud come to the father
[51:21] except the father drew them you had
[51:24] absolutely nothing less than nothing to
[51:28] do with where you are today it was all
[51:31] election and calling you know that's why
[51:33] the Bible said we read make your calling
[51:36] an election sure by by showing whether
[51:39] you're a CH Child of Light or a child of
[51:42] darkness by how you scatter when the
[51:45] presence of God Falls by how you scatter
[51:48] when you're around Believers be how you
[51:50] scatter when the revelation of the
[51:52] word's coming forth be how you scatter a
[51:56] you don't have to tell me nothing I just
[51:59] watch do you like being around the
[52:01] atmosphere do you lose your mind in the
[52:05] atmosphere do you get drunk very easy in
[52:07] the I'm talking about real Holy Ghost
[52:11] filled
[52:13] atmosphere in Isaiah 646 it says but we
[52:17] are all as unclean thing and all our
[52:20] righteousness as is with filthy
[52:25] filthy oh oh bless God I read the
[52:27] prophet I listen to him and I study in
[52:30] my as filthy rags that's how much all
[52:35] you're studying is filthy rags and we
[52:38] all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities
[52:43] like the wind that has taken
[52:47] us
[52:49] away oh but you know I what I'm trying
[52:53] what God's trying to show us this
[52:55] morning is what we are will
[52:59] show and and I I I get scared as a
[53:03] minister that that we could be deceived
[53:06] and thinking that we're okay and be like
[53:09] the ones that'll get to heaven and say
[53:11] but God by God I sat in the prophet's
[53:15] meanings bless God and by God I passed
[53:18] out message books bless God by God I
[53:21] prayed for somebody in his he got
[53:25] healed
[53:29] and God will say you
[53:33] did because children of light are
[53:37] children of Darkness amen Isaiah 647
[53:41] and8 for there is none that are called
[53:44] upon thy name that stirreth up himself
[53:47] because of our iniquities now now now
[53:50] this is kind of important because I'm
[53:52] we're trying to get rid of our own
[53:54] Holiness and get the real genuine Jo
[53:56] Jehovah there is none called upon thy
[53:59] name that stirreth up himself to take
[54:03] hold of thee uh-oh well what am I going
[54:05] to do with my good
[54:07] life for thou has hid thy face from us
[54:10] and H has consumed us because of our
[54:13] iniquities verse eight but now oh Lord
[54:17] Thou Art our father and we
[54:20] are aha there it puts our
[54:23] position he's the boss
[54:27] and we're the
[54:28] clay and he's the
[54:31] Potter and you know when Potter's making
[54:33] clay it's
[54:34] pliable so it's doing some Glory
[54:38] Hallelujah and it don't affect the
[54:39] Potter
[54:41] any cu he's working with
[54:44] you he said we are the clay and thou art
[54:47] the Potter and we are the works of thy
[54:50] handiwork be not worthy very sore be thy
[54:54] wrath not very sore oh Lord neither
[54:56] remember our
[54:58] iniquities
[55:00] anymore God help
[55:02] us in this time you know we need to and
[55:07] and you know we we we we had a wonderful
[55:09] service here today so this this ain't
[55:12] just bear with me I'm preaching to
[55:15] myself
[55:16] here but remember what the prophet said
[55:19] you're a children of light and if you're
[55:21] like Darkness you won't feel
[55:24] comfortable in the presence of of
[55:28] God
[55:29] Amen we need to not let Satan take our
[55:35] blessing from us and your blessing will
[55:38] be in worship and you say well how can
[55:41] that be well Paul and Silas got put in
[55:46] jail and Paul it was unlawful for him to
[55:50] be put in jail because he was one of
[55:52] them and he got beaten which was
[55:56] unlawful because they were actually
[55:58] scared that he would charge
[56:01] them and so like he didn't feel good
[56:03] when he came to church he would have
[56:05] stayed home and sat in the coach he
[56:07] would have watched from the coach
[56:08] guaranteed I mean praise God we got a
[56:10] lot of polls that would have stayed home
[56:14] they were beaten
[56:16] wrongfully and they went to a miserable
[56:20] jail where they had rats as big as
[56:24] muskrats and they had no air condition
[56:27] and they put their feet in
[56:31] stocks and they sat on the stone and it
[56:34] was wet and
[56:39] cold and the Bible
[56:43] says how did they do
[56:46] it how did they do it that they started
[56:50] to worship God they move beyond their
[56:54] circumstances they move beyond their
[56:57] bills they move beyond their their their
[57:00] domestic they move beyond their problems
[57:02] they move beyond their they moved Beyond
[57:05] everything on
[57:08] Earth they didn't pray they didn't
[57:13] pray they had no promise that God would
[57:15] throw them out of
[57:17] jail they had no like
[57:21] prophecy they just
[57:24] worship and God God erupted the
[57:28] foundations of some of those buildings
[57:31] that stand for thousands of
[57:34] years thousands of
[57:36] years amen watch this quote of our
[57:39] prophet he said you know I'm an American
[57:41] citizen and I have the right to do
[57:43] whatever I want to bless God he said
[57:46] that's your American privilege he said
[57:49] it's your American privilege but if
[57:51] you're a
[57:52] Christian but if you're a Christian
[57:54] privilege he said for Christians you are
[57:57] sheep and sheep forfeit their rights he
[58:01] said it lay still just lay and let it
[58:04] taken away from you the rights that are
[58:07] rightfully yours you know I'm preaching
[58:10] to myself CU brother Dale thinks is a
[58:12] Canadian and you know things that's
[58:14] happened in history I said bless God you
[58:15] know that's our constitution what's the
[58:18] government
[58:20] doing Paul was beaten to the point that
[58:24] the people that put him in the jail were
[58:26] were
[58:27] afraid because they' done it wrongfully
[58:30] and watch how they were I it just came
[58:33] to me and I I have the scripture in
[58:34] front of me but Paul was beaten because
[58:36] there was a woman that was
[58:39] possessed with a familiar Spirit a
[58:43] demon and the the other Christians were
[58:47] making a profit
[58:49] offer kind of sounds like a rock
[58:51] group coming to a place called
[58:55] Church
[58:57] making a
[59:00] prophet and Paul cast that demon out of
[59:03] them and the Christian people were
[59:06] angered because they saw their benefits
[59:09] of
[59:11] wealth Blown
[59:13] Away wrongfully put in jail for doing
[59:17] good he was put in
[59:19] jail amen but because of the power of
[59:23] worship let's go back to our our quote
[59:25] here he said you forfeit your right it
[59:27] lays it still lays still and it lets you
[59:30] take it away from it all the rights
[59:33] that's yours he said but the goat will
[59:36] kick up a storm about it that's right he
[59:41] said but sheep will forfeit its rights
[59:44] and a Christian always
[59:48] forfeits I don't like this
[59:53] one this really Burns me
[59:58] their National R oo you mean I can't
[1:00:02] stand on the constitution of
[1:00:05] Canada don't that burn you up Burns me
[1:00:09] up bless God that's the law they broke
[1:00:12] the
[1:00:14] law what's that got to do with
[1:00:17] God you forfeit it this exact a
[1:00:20] Christian always forfeits their National
[1:00:22] rights oh Bo if it's contrary to their
[1:00:28] Christian
[1:00:30] rights
[1:00:32] wow God help
[1:00:34] us you know brother brandham talked
[1:00:37] about when he came to Canada that we
[1:00:39] were cold and starchy and
[1:00:43] formal but and we are praise God but
[1:00:47] we're not Canadian and if you are you're
[1:00:50] in big
[1:00:52] trouble you're in really big trouble now
[1:00:56] she I mean you were in trouble in the
[1:00:58] beginning of Canada but now there's
[1:01:01] just and we've let Satan brother Dale
[1:01:05] let
[1:01:06] Satan just say this is just for me this
[1:01:08] ain't for none of you be
[1:01:12] shy
[1:01:14] inverted
[1:01:16] backward oh bless God that's not my
[1:01:19] personality I don't want your
[1:01:20] personality
[1:01:21] anyway your personality was formed in
[1:01:24] sin if you got the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:27] Ghost there ain't no shy there ain't no
[1:01:30] cold there ain't no bashfulness there
[1:01:33] ain't no formal it gives you great
[1:01:34] wisdom unbelievably
[1:01:38] wisdom and unbelievable
[1:01:41] worship and what we got to figure out is
[1:01:44] how much have you been
[1:01:46] forgiven how much did God do for you you
[1:01:50] know they show you know in our modern
[1:01:52] world you know they have lotteries and
[1:01:54] all these things
[1:01:57] and you know normally when people get a
[1:02:00] big
[1:02:04] gift they really show
[1:02:09] it but you got eternal
[1:02:12] life amen I have a scripture here if I
[1:02:15] just find it in all this
[1:02:22] uh here you
[1:02:24] know God help us God help us our worship
[1:02:29] you know what literally now I'm I'm I'm
[1:02:32] going to the far
[1:02:34] left but I want you to
[1:02:37] realize no amount of noise in this
[1:02:40] service can interfere with the Holy
[1:02:43] Spirit Satan cannot interfere with God's
[1:02:46] plan that's right it's not
[1:02:51] possible and for sure if it was caused
[1:02:54] by God but I'm going to get to places
[1:02:56] where brother Brown said every place God
[1:02:59] is it's no easier than
[1:03:03] this the hardest sermons I ever preach
[1:03:06] is to a quiet
[1:03:08] audience amen you know we we we if we
[1:03:12] had the
[1:03:13] revelation of we would go to Eternal
[1:03:16] damnation not sorry that's not Eternal
[1:03:19] but be lost forever and
[1:03:23] ever cuz hell ain't Eternal forgive me
[1:03:26] but be lost forever and ever or
[1:03:30] eternally in
[1:03:33] Paradise we'd have to put guards on
[1:03:35] these windows
[1:03:40] Insight brother Brown talked about a
[1:03:42] sister that came to him and said I never
[1:03:44] got nothing out of your service because
[1:03:46] there was one person in the service just
[1:03:48] screaming and shouting and amen and all
[1:03:51] this that brother Brown said if they
[1:03:53] wouldn't have been doing that this is a
[1:03:56] Vindicated Prophet the a brother Dale
[1:03:58] said I couldn't have even
[1:04:05] preached I couldn't even have preached
[1:04:07] that's
[1:04:08] right I couldn't even have preached
[1:04:11] that's how much it Disturbed
[1:04:14] him amen you know in the Old Testament
[1:04:18] in Exodus 24 or Exodus 28 sorry I just
[1:04:21] want to give you uh a a preview of this
[1:04:24] is the priest
[1:04:26] when they went into the holy of holies
[1:04:29] they had the Gown around them and they
[1:04:31] wore the golden Bells under gown and
[1:04:34] some of those verses brother Brown
[1:04:36] commented 10 and 50 times and even in
[1:04:40] the Old Testament before the baptism of
[1:04:42] the Holy Ghost was
[1:04:43] given everything was
[1:04:46] noise number one it was brother Braham
[1:04:49] said this he said in the quotes he said
[1:04:51] every place there's life there's noise
[1:04:58] amen so is there anybody alive you won't
[1:05:01] scare God or you won't scare me if
[1:05:03] you're noisy and he said the priests
[1:05:06] would go and when they walked they knew
[1:05:08] that they were
[1:05:09] alive but it actually he repeatedly said
[1:05:13] it played to him holy holy holy is the
[1:05:17] Lord God Almighty the whole time he said
[1:05:19] holy holy holy is Lord God Almighty holy
[1:05:21] holy holy is the Lord God
[1:05:23] Almighty holy holy holy
[1:05:26] and it was loud
[1:05:28] enough that through the badger skins
[1:05:32] with no fake
[1:05:35] instruments the whole
[1:05:37] congregation could hear the
[1:05:40] worship to
[1:05:43] God holy holy holy is the Lord God
[1:05:46] Almighty you know there's another story
[1:05:48] in the Bible where when Jesus came in on
[1:05:51] the
[1:05:52] donkey and the F Sadducees and Pharisees
[1:05:55] came to him and
[1:06:00] said remember these were religious
[1:06:03] people you know hey you need to tone it
[1:06:06] down a
[1:06:10] bit and Jesus said to
[1:06:13] them if they tone down one
[1:06:17] second that
[1:06:19] immediately immediately ain't a second
[1:06:23] long that immediately
[1:06:27] the
[1:06:29] Rocks we cry
[1:06:31] out I wonder how close our Stones get to
[1:06:35] that in the parking
[1:06:37] lot I wonder seriously it's not possible
[1:06:41] and you see you can say well you know I
[1:06:43] was never raised that way I thought it
[1:06:45] was reverence
[1:06:47] or I thought it was
[1:06:49] disrespect I'm giving you
[1:06:52] Bible I'm giving you Bible it has
[1:06:55] nothing to do with respect that's a lie
[1:06:58] of
[1:07:00] Lucifer he's taken your blessing and
[1:07:03] he's taking God's blessing because we
[1:07:05] were
[1:07:06] made let me tell you that we were
[1:07:12] made you were made to be
[1:07:16] noisy to
[1:07:18] worship and see brother Dale's going
[1:07:21] through this I said I was preaching to
[1:07:22] myself you know I had a couple hard days
[1:07:24] this week
[1:07:26] and when we get the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:28] Ghost we're not supposed to be affected
[1:07:29] by the environment around
[1:07:31] us when we're in the inner holy of
[1:07:36] holies you know I want to tell you
[1:07:37] something you're looking for something
[1:07:39] God doing I had a brother 5 hours away
[1:07:42] message
[1:07:47] me he said brother Dale you were really
[1:07:50] on my heart
[1:07:51] today I kept bringing you before God I
[1:07:55] said brother there was a
[1:07:58] reason there was a reason I had talked
[1:08:01] to him for
[1:08:03] weeks you want to see a power of God
[1:08:06] move it just happened it just happened
[1:08:09] it just happened it's because you can
[1:08:12] get so consumed with everything that's
[1:08:14] going on in your environment decisions
[1:08:15] and should I move should I buy should I
[1:08:17] sell should I should I should I build a
[1:08:19] bunker should
[1:08:22] I should I should I should I should I
[1:08:26] invest should I should I go should I go
[1:08:28] on a trip should I go to mfield you can
[1:08:30] be consumed you know what you can be
[1:08:31] consumed in the
[1:08:35] ministry you don't be biased the
[1:08:39] prophet and he had a special gift said
[1:08:43] why in the world do you go
[1:08:45] hunting he said because I'm always
[1:08:47] giving out and he said out there I fill
[1:08:53] up oh there I fill
[1:08:56] up nobody's made to just give out
[1:09:00] non-stop except
[1:09:03] Jehovah that's why there will be young
[1:09:05] Brothers in this church it's not about
[1:09:07] brother Dale brother Dale might go on a
[1:09:09] Hol you know what we were just at the
[1:09:11] the home show and the people the good
[1:09:13] friends in town here and they're going
[1:09:16] to a funeral and the people are 60 Lan
[1:09:17] turned 60 this year let that sink in you
[1:09:22] don't think God's called in you in the
[1:09:24] ministry brother Dale could go home this
[1:09:27] year and you have to still carry on till
[1:09:29] the
[1:09:32] Rapture it's not a oneman ministry
[1:09:35] that's why we have specials and and
[1:09:37] worship and testimonies and and teachers
[1:09:41] and Prophets and and and missionaries
[1:09:44] that we can buy their plane ticket and
[1:09:46] send them to Uganda and the pastor can
[1:09:48] stay here one of you Brothers can go
[1:09:50] over there and preach and they don't
[1:09:51] cost you nothing or or or where
[1:09:56] I just mentioned that it could be a
[1:10:01] Salvador we got to quit worshiping some
[1:10:04] big priest or some big and worship God
[1:10:09] and get into the the Holiness of worship
[1:10:12] and we need to get rid of the devil that
[1:10:15] says oh bless God I'm Sor or bless God

[1:10:18] you're in this when and I'm not talking
[1:10:21] about

[1:10:28] touches your
[1:10:30] heart and you come into the you know
[1:10:32] what you
[1:10:34] decide brother bam says that I might not
[1:10:36] get to these quotes because I you know
[1:10:39] I'll lose them but he said you make a
[1:10:41] decision when you come into the house of
[1:10:44] God you it's a calcal decision am I a
[1:10:48] Christian did God do anything for me
[1:10:50] it's it's your mental it's it I mean
[1:10:53] like God can go past that but if you
[1:10:56] want to fall asleep in church you

[1:11:57] to Heaven than
[1:12:01] Earth the easiest way you'll ever do
[1:12:03] that is not studying the
[1:12:07] message the devil studies the message
[1:12:12] daily it's worship the devil cannot
[1:12:15] worship God remember that Satan got
[1:12:19] kicked out of heaven because he

[1:29:03] noise
[1:29:05] am you

[1:30:02] quote there's a whole lot to matter with
[1:30:04] our churches today there is not enough
[1:30:10] noise this the same Prophet that work
[1:30:12] wrote Church order and Doctrine yeah
[1:30:14] that's right there is not enough noise
[1:30:17] about it not enough enthusiasm and not
[1:30:21] enough of something and so where where
[1:30:24] Jesus is there's always noise that's in
[1:30:28] he was to pass by this way in a 64 quote
[1:30:31] after the seals 6403
[1:30:37] 21b he said one time he came to
[1:30:39] Jerusalem and they were screaming and
[1:30:40] hollering hosan to Kings in the
[1:30:43] highest uh Hosanna to the king that
[1:30:46] cometh in the name of the Lord and some
[1:30:48] of the priests standing there said make
[1:30:50] them keep their peace and he said if
[1:30:52] they hold their peace the rocks will
[1:30:55] immediately cry out and something has to
[1:30:59] move watch this watch this watch this
[1:31:04] something has to move when Jesus is
[1:31:11] around something has to
[1:31:14] move when Jesus is around that's
[1:31:16] paragraph 103 of 6403
[1:31:20] 21b
[1:31:22] Hallelujah
[1:31:29] Hallelujah he said here in Luke 1937 to
[1:31:33] 40 Amy you can pull this up Luke 19:37
[1:31:36] he said and when Jesus came nigh even to
[1:31:38] descend on the Mount of Olives the whole
[1:31:40] multitude of the disciples began
[1:31:42] rejoicing and praising God did they have
[1:31:45] more than you
[1:31:47] have they didn't have the Revelation you
[1:31:49] have they didn't have the seals open
[1:31:52] they didn't have all the Mysteries
[1:31:53] revealed
[1:31:56] started praising God rejoicing and
[1:31:58] praising God and God with a loud voice
[1:32:03] for all the
[1:32:05] multitudes M Mighty works that they had
[1:32:10] seen has anybody seen any multiple works
[1:32:15] that are worth praising God for in their
[1:32:17] life in the last year amen in the last
[1:32:21] week I can

[1:32:43] and verse 39 and some of the Pharisees
[1:32:45] among them rebuked the master and the
[1:32:48] disciples and he answered he said I tell
[1:32:50] you that these will hold their peace the
[1:32:52] stones will immediately craw out
[1:32:54] I want to give you in closing some
[1:32:57] scriptures and we'll shut her down but I
[1:33:01] I I intentionally showed you multiple
[1:33:04] scriptures spread out through the

[1:36:58] Ghost yes sir that's
[1:37:01] right hallelujah amen acts is where Paul
[1:37:06] cast out the spirit of the woman we're
[1:37:09] going to just passed by that he said in
[1:37:11] Redemption 54 he said what a great
[1:37:15] pleasure the believer has knowing that
[1:37:16] he's living in doing something pleasing
[1:37:20] the
[1:37:22] Lord
[1:37:24] why if we would look for watch this this
[1:37:26] is beautiful why if we was looking for
[1:37:29] the coming of the Lord why I thought you
[1:37:31] weren't supposed to talk about the
[1:37:32] Rapture you're overemphasizing that
[1:37:35] brother Dale you know I'm so sick of
[1:37:36] hearing that Rapture talk you know we've
[1:37:38] been hearing that since I was born you
[1:37:40] know you know Paul talked about the
[1:37:42] Rapture in Corinthians he said the time
[1:37:45] was short in
[1:37:46] Corinthians that was a while
[1:37:48] ago I don't see a lot wrong with Paul's
[1:37:52] life he said why if we were looking for
[1:37:55] the coming of the Lord like we should be
[1:37:57] looking for it why my there would be no
[1:38:00] friction
[1:38:03] nowhere I don't care what anybody else
[1:38:05] does I'm looking for one thing that's
[1:38:07] the Rapture there can to be a tornado
[1:38:09] beside me but it's a Rapture I'm I'm
[1:38:12] thinking one thing is that telling me
[1:38:14] the raptures I'm going to still plant my
[1:38:17] beans I'm not going to get in a hurry
[1:38:19] I'm play them late May I'll have less
[1:38:21] weeds because maybe the Rapture will
[1:38:23] come
[1:38:25] I know you think I'm crazy but I'm not
[1:38:28] and if I am just leave me like I am man
[1:38:32] everybody would be in love and there'd
[1:38:34] be Harmony now now let's just back that
[1:38:36] up how are we going to get in love look
[1:38:38] for the Rapture
[1:38:40] today let's talk about the Rapture and
[1:38:43] we'll be in
[1:38:44] love
[1:38:46] today amen he said if everybody was in
[1:38:49] love
[1:38:50] oh wouldn't it uh he said everybody
[1:38:53] would be in love and there would be
[1:38:54] Harmony wouldn't that be wonderful and
[1:38:56] you know he may
[1:38:58] come he may come actually today now he
[1:39:02] said that in 54
[1:39:04] 11:14 in redeemed of
[1:39:07] judgment now he must have been crazy but
[1:39:10] I want to be the same
[1:39:12] crazy cuz he could come today you know
[1:39:14] when we get done I think he'll wait till
[1:39:16] we finish our fellowship CU that'll be
[1:39:18] the good send off and then we'll
[1:39:21] just we'll leave all their cars for
[1:39:23] everybody else to drive praise

[1:39:31] them he may come today and I don't know
[1:39:35] what's left that's right it's just the
[1:39:38] time for him to
[1:39:40] come wow for anybody that thought I was
[1:39:44] overemphasizing that it could come this
[1:39:46] year he thought it would come in
[1:39:48] 54 he didn't see nothing left in
[1:39:52] 54 H hello

[1:40:03] 80 don't come to me to feed you I mean
[1:40:05] I'll try to feed you but you know what
[1:40:07] I'm saying we need to be
[1:40:09] wise but we need to have something else
[1:40:11] really weighing the other side of the
[1:40:17] scales you know my you know we did some
[1:40:21] far out stuff this week I actually had a
[1:40:24] real estate person come byy and
[1:40:25] considered selling a
[1:40:29] farm now that to my father would be
[1:40:32] worse than a
[1:40:34] divorce or
[1:40:37] equal that would be equal to a
[1:40:40] divorce but you know before he died he
[1:40:43] said something he said Dale if you're
[1:40:46] going to go out and do something invest
[1:40:48] something this is good advice by the way
[1:40:50] he was a smart
[1:40:51] man and it's it's not going to do you no
[1:40:54] good in your
[1:40:56] life don't
[1:41:01] bother what are we building a kingdom
[1:41:03] for when we're not even here I mean
[1:41:05] that's some kind of a weird
[1:41:08] Kingdom I'm not I'm not against I I mean
[1:41:11] I believe it's even scriptural to leave
[1:41:12] things you know whatever's left whoever
[1:41:15] can have behind but he said you know he
[1:41:17] was talking about buying something he
[1:41:19] said if you're going to buy something
[1:41:20] and it's not going to help you your
[1:41:22] whole life buy groceries why would you
[1:41:25] buy it that's called working for
[1:41:28] GM or that's called working for New
[1:41:30] Holland or John Deere you know you can
[1:41:32] just be so chained to the ball and chain
[1:41:36] that everywhere you swing you just send
[1:41:38] it directly to
[1:41:40] John that's not my
[1:41:43] kingdom you see to
[1:41:45] me but we should be so consumed I'm
[1:41:48] thinking
[1:41:50] like and you just walk out and and God
[1:41:53] God will tell you God will tell
[1:41:56] you he'll tell you in different ways you
[1:41:58] just got to have the ear say if God's
[1:42:00] pushing you he'll push you off but if
[1:42:02] he's saying you maybe
[1:42:05] not watch
[1:42:08] this he said it's time for him to come
[1:42:10] he said what if we were all have that in
[1:42:13] our what if we all have that in our
[1:42:16] hearts this morning he's talking about
[1:42:18] that it's time for him to come that
[1:42:21] today was the last day
[1:42:23] we ought to live every day like it was
[1:42:26] the last day and this would be the last
[1:42:29] day all in love I I just wonder what
[1:42:33] like if if we were going to go in the
[1:42:35] Rapture would we worship God I wonder
[1:42:39] would if we knew you know if the dad
[1:42:42] ones start coming to our door and we
[1:42:43] recognize them and the prophet said that
[1:42:45] only the ones that are going in the
[1:42:46] Rapture will recognize the ones that
[1:42:48] come to the door and the neighbors will
[1:42:49] be looking at them and I'm going to be
[1:42:51] talking to brother Wade or my dad or
[1:42:53] somebody and you know the neighbors
[1:42:54] looking at me and go oh brother Dale
[1:42:57] he's he's he's went off on the cuckoo
[1:43:00] and I can see them perfectly right in
[1:43:02] front of me and I'm thinking well they
[1:43:03] went off in the cuckoo no somebody's
[1:43:05] cuckoo
[1:43:10] here he said would we what I want to say
[1:43:14] is if you would do anything different if
[1:43:18] you knew the Rapture was happening
[1:43:20] today if you knew the Rapture was going
[1:43:22] to happen happen next Sunday during the
[1:43:25] worship would it be
[1:43:30] louder would you be more involved in the
[1:43:34] worship next Sunday morning if you
[1:43:36] absolutely knew that in the middle of
[1:43:39] the worship service God was going to
[1:43:40] lift your body right you were going to
[1:43:41] get a body change
[1:43:44] oh holy smokes I know the answer for
[1:43:50] me that's right amen wow
[1:43:56] I might read some more scriptures but I
[1:43:58] want to read a last quote he said what
[1:44:00] would diamel do this is a quote in 62
[1:44:06] the wisdom versus face he said what
[1:44:08] would Dio do and I'm
[1:44:11] like who's
[1:44:14] Domino is that a person is that God is
[1:44:17] that another name I never heard of it so
[1:44:19] I went to
[1:44:21] Google and diamel
[1:44:24] is a charge of energy in a movement of
[1:44:29] electricity but I like the bottom of
[1:44:33] diamondo I'm a
[1:44:35] diamondo and I want to be more of a
[1:44:37] diamondo I want every one of you to be
[1:44:40] diol
[1:44:42] crazy he said diol in a human is a
[1:44:46] highly electric
[1:44:48] person uh
[1:44:51] in I can't even say that word
[1:44:53] explosive person with symptoms like a
[1:44:58] ball of
[1:45:00] fire a fireball a Powerhouse a
[1:45:05] selfstarter an Evangelical person are
[1:45:11] unusually uh
[1:45:16] intensive let's go to our prophet he
[1:45:18] said what would diamondo do he'd be a
[1:45:21] fireball he'd be a ball of fire he'd be
[1:45:25] explosive that's a prophet that's a
[1:45:27] prophet not Brother D these are the
[1:45:29] signs that he would be that what
[1:45:30] diamondo would do he said ask the father
[1:45:35] anything anything in my name and I'll do
[1:45:39] it John 1413 and 14 and what do you do
[1:45:44] you plug in to God if you want to
[1:45:48] worship God you got to get that old
[1:45:50] extension cord and plug it
[1:45:54] in you plug into God Amen he said that's
[1:45:59] right he said just plug into God that's
[1:46:02] all you have to do if you need something
[1:46:05] in your life just get out your plug and
[1:46:08] plug it into that I I don't the vce of
[1:46:10] God like the voltage must be out of the
[1:46:12] world it's got to be like whatever those
[1:46:15] big volts are and bigger than
[1:46:18] that he said the current comes flowing
[1:46:22] right down the line he said what happens
[1:46:25] the word starts growing and he shall be
[1:46:27] like a tree planted in the river of
[1:46:29] waters and his weaves leaves will not
[1:46:31] wither and whatsoever he doeth will
[1:46:32] prosper and Psalms 1 13 and the ungodly
[1:46:36] is not
[1:46:39] so well that's in the Bible because I
[1:46:42] had to look up to study because brother
[1:46:43] brand would be quoting things i' saying
[1:46:45] like is he just saying this is he thus
[1:46:47] sayith the Lord or is this Bible so the
[1:46:50] Bible is telling us that we can plug to
[1:46:53] God and anything
[1:46:57] anything is yours but the wicked it's
[1:47:01] not
[1:47:03] so the ungodly it's not so he said watch
[1:47:06] this he said the ungodly is not so he
[1:47:10] said now it didn't say The
[1:47:17] Sinner now he said it said the ungodly
[1:47:21] see that's the one who claims to
[1:47:26] be but has trouble
[1:47:30] worshiping claims to be but has trouble
[1:47:32] plug it in claims to be well you know
[1:47:35] bless God I'm kind of a quiet
[1:47:40] person I'll tell you how it works the
[1:47:43] very first time that Len laid eyes on me
[1:47:46] she told her girlfriend that I would
[1:47:49] never even cons I would never even it
[1:47:53] never even com through my mind cuz Dale
[1:47:56] don't
[1:47:57] speak cuz my older brother did all my
[1:47:59] talking I just nodded Arnold did
[1:48:02] everything you know they want to go
[1:48:03] there yep want to eat yep you want this
[1:48:06] yep she said how could you even cuz he
[1:48:09] don't
[1:48:10] talk that was my natural personality
[1:48:13] God's got a sense of
[1:48:16] humor see you thought you had a ni
[1:48:18] personality you weren't going to worship
[1:48:19] God that's what mine was I didn't speak
[1:48:21] I didn't have to speak
[1:48:23] yeah but but it's not our personality
[1:48:26] it's the Holy Ghost personality and you
[1:48:28] were made to Worship You Were Made To
[1:48:31] Worship that's right amen he said now it
[1:48:34] it never said The Sinner he said it said
[1:48:36] the ungodly see that's the one who
[1:48:38] claims to be and is ungodly with it you
[1:48:42] see that's right the ungodly is not so
[1:48:46] so the ungodly in a worship service
[1:48:48] won't
[1:48:50] worship but they claim
[1:48:56] this is in the wisdom versus Faith
[1:48:59] 62401 ungodly is not so they can't stand
[1:49:03] they can't stand the Judgment in
[1:49:06] righteousness they can't stand that we
[1:49:09] would worship God and be drunk
[1:49:12] spiritually speaking like when they come
[1:49:14] out of the upper room they said you know
[1:49:16] it's only the beginning of the day and
[1:49:18] they got like the new wine they can't
[1:49:20] stand the Judgment of the revealed word
[1:49:22] for the day and so if it's their
[1:49:25] favorite topic they're rejoicing but if
[1:49:27] it's not their favorite topic they don't
[1:49:29] want nothing to do with it that's why 90
[1:49:32] well a big percentage so the ones that
[1:49:33] don't worship a man they stay home in
[1:49:36] their coach because they get to play
[1:49:37] their favorite tape but you can't push
[1:49:40] play on
[1:49:41] me and I can't even push play on
[1:49:44] God cuz I just open this and like stuff
[1:49:47] comes out
[1:49:49] that it's just the way the get God is
[1:49:53] CU if you're surrendered to him you see
[1:49:55] he said they can't stand judgment with
[1:49:57] righteousness that's the that's not the
[1:49:59] sinner that's the on Godly that profess
[1:50:02] he said no sir they certainly can't so
[1:50:05] the time has come for the seed to be swn
[1:50:07] through those who are predestinated
[1:50:09] predestinated they're the only way them
[1:50:12] are the
[1:50:14] ones that are going to be a ball of fire
[1:50:17] a fireball
[1:50:21] explosive
[1:50:23] to
[1:50:25] God to God
[1:50:29] Amen let's just close with some some
[1:50:31] fast scriptures here John John 14:13-14
[1:50:34] whatsoever you ask in my
[1:50:37] name you shall have
[1:50:40] it that will I do that the father may be
[1:50:43] glorified in the son and whatever you
[1:50:45] ask in my name I will do you know this
[1:50:48] is actually New Testament Bible do we
[1:50:51] realize
[1:50:53] I wonder are we Believers are we Godly
[1:50:56] or
[1:51:02] ungodly here's here's this maybe I'll I
[1:51:05] I've got too much but maybe I'll uh
[1:51:08] Psalm
[1:51:09] 63 3 to5 brother B mentions this 42
[1:51:13] times talks about eternal life and I
[1:51:14] mentioned that uh because thy loving
[1:51:17] kindness is better in life he was
[1:51:18] talking about my lips shall praise thee
[1:51:20] because I have eternal life
[1:51:23] I have eternal life maybe if you're
[1:51:25] having trouble with the praise maybe
[1:51:28] you that's right that that's just Bible
[1:51:31] thus will I bless thy name why I live
[1:51:34] why I live not when I get to the
[1:51:35] Millennium it won't be any different in
[1:51:37] the Millennium if you're noisy here
[1:51:39] you'll be noisy in the Millennium if
[1:51:41] you're quiet here you won't even be in
[1:51:42] the
[1:51:43] Millennium
[1:51:44] amen why I live and while I lift up my
[1:51:47] hands in thy name my soul shall be
[1:51:49] satisfied in the marrow and fatness and
[1:51:51] my mouth shall praise the with the joys
[1:51:53] of my lips thy loving and and then he
[1:51:56] and there's 42 quotes so we could be
[1:51:58] here forever he talks about that the
[1:52:01] loving kindness is better than life is
[1:52:04] eternal life the
[1:52:06] resting Hallelujah Psalms 100 1-5 is a
[1:52:11] Joyful Noise unto the Lord serve the
[1:52:13] Lord his godness and let's just jump

[1:52:36] nature itself has to do it that's what

[1:52:41] body he'll control the coyotes and the
[1:52:43] birds in my front tree and the stones in
[1:52:46] this parking

[1:57:27] staying with me I I there was only one
[1:57:30] scripture on here I didn't read and I
[1:57:32] think it's going to get bumped to next
[1:57:35] Sunday Deuteronomy 311 to 16 and then
[1:57:41] 19 and for this commandment which I
[1:57:44] command thee this day it is not hidden
[1:57:47] from thee neither is it a far off what
[1:57:49] I'm telling you is not hidden from you
[1:57:53] you know to much is given much will be
[1:57:57] required I touched on that Wednesday
[1:57:59] night and I lost my little clip there
[1:58:01] you know you know watch this you know
[1:58:03] the Bible the guy that burned at the
[1:58:05] state for uh for translating the Bible
[1:58:08] from Hebrew and All Greek and whatever
[1:58:10] that was you know what he translated
[1:58:13] to
[1:58:14] English you know what the message came
[1:58:18] in
[1:58:21] English you know where the Prophet
[1:58:22] traveled the
[1:58:24] most in his
[1:58:27] home to much is
[1:58:31] given much much much much is required do
[1:58:36] you know when you want to listen to a
[1:58:38] tape and I know you all know this but
[1:58:40] like a tape that brother Brown preached
[1:58:42] 4 hours and you translate it to French
[1:58:43] it's now eight hours
[1:58:45] long so if you were only French you got
[1:58:48] to spend eight hours where you only got
[1:58:49] to spend four you think you're going to
[1:58:51] get oh scotf free to much is
[1:58:55] given much will be required is the one
[1:58:58] place when we preached for brother James
[1:59:00] in Uganda brother Jose preached he went
[1:59:02] through two translators now I tell you
[1:59:05] what that's close to mass
[1:59:07] confusion because one translator do it
[1:59:09] and the other one oh praise God it was
[1:59:12] him and not
[1:59:14] me too much is given much will be
[1:59:18] required it's not hidden from us and it
[1:59:21] it this truth is not in verse 12 it is
[1:59:24] not in heaven that thou should say Whom
[1:59:27] Shall go up to heaven for us to heaven
[1:59:29] and bring it down to us that we may hear
[1:59:32] it and do it God's already taken care of
[1:59:35] that part verse 13 neither is it beyond
[1:59:37] the sea that thou shalt say Whom Shall
[1:59:40] go over to the Sea for us and bring it
[1:59:42] to us that we may hear it and do it
[1:59:45] God's already taking care of that but
[1:59:47] the word is very nigh unto thee even in
[1:59:51] thy mouth MTH and in thy heart that thou
[1:59:53] mayest do
[1:59:55] it the word and worship see I have set
[2:00:00] before thee this day life and good and
[2:00:06] death and
[2:00:08] evil oh you get to choose if you want to
[2:00:13] worship God and Jesus himself God said
[2:00:20] if you feel like you didn't really do a
[2:00:22] lot for you you won't really feel like
