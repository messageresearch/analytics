conversations are gathering in our praise and worship for sure lord hallelujah we thank you that you're our heavenly father the greatest father that anybody could ever hope to have it's jesus christ hallelujah god come in the flesh and he's walking among us today in his bride and his spirits here lord your spirit's here and we praise you for it love you with all of our hearts your beautiful name we pray amen amen when we close i want to sing what a day that'll be amy you can pull that up thank you musicians i was uh this week i was singing that started singing that song wow you know our excuse me goddess said to worship you had to get in the spirit so when people go to a ball game they get in the spirit of the ball game the problem you know john said that in the bible i was in the spirit in the lord's day you don't get nothing at a church it's not your brother's sister's fault it definitely ain't god's fault and it probably ain't the minister's fault either because you weren't in the spirit you were present but your mind was somewhere else amen god's so amazing we just welcome all our fathers and dads in us an awesome way it'd be nice to get a picture of us four dads here today and we talked to brother jim yesterday he's totally here he was actually planning on being here and sister linda's sister went back to london either on friday or saturday and he said i'm not he said she's going to be gone for a week and he says i don't know if i can come next sunday but he's here with us he's he's watching the services and and uh he's man he's one of us and then it's also brother junior and just so if we can get him a car he could come i think he said every other sunday he works and but just you know there's more present of course we have all the angels of heaven with us amen and we thank god for that amen amen we just want to read a couple of scriptures and kind of continue on the same theme and just see where god takes us talking about fathers also and and uh just uh see what you know i want to i want to put something out before we start though i want you to remember this when we're preaching remember satan believed the word but satan twisted the word just one word man and so anytime you see and anytime you see somebody that wants to take one part our prophet brother branham said the middle of the road was where we used to be our prophet the same vindicated prophet that you read in the one quote i have people this week send me lots of quote i believe every one of them they don't want to see the quotes i say from the same prophet see amen you and man god dovetails it beautifully this word dovetails are beautiful satan quoted the word thief amen hallelujah thank you lord let's turn to first john 3 first john 3 16. first john 3 16 and just uh just i've really enjoyed uh you know when we ministered on i uh you know last couple weeks ago and it was just fantastic first john 3 hereby perceive we the love of god that he laid down his life and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren see if you have the same characteristics of christ you'll be like your father hereby perceive with the love of god that he lay down his life for us and we ought to also lay down our lives for the brethren so whosoever seeth has of this world's good and see us this brother in need and shut us up his mouths of compassion how dwelleth the love of god in him let us little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth man your testimony needs to be more than just what you say hallelujah just i want to read uh another scripture matthew 25 before you see that matthew 25 and 31 now we were preaching on i never knew you and that's in matthew also in matthew uh last sunday we or two sundays ago we preached on matthew 27 23 where jesus said depart from me i never knew you and that just says encount me and that spirit has encountered me of how believers have got to heaven and they were believers they see they were all virgins remember the 10 virgins they were all pure they were all virgins they were all sanctified five never had oil but they didn't recognize that they didn't have oil until the groom the time of the groom was coming you know we're at the end time we believe we're at the end of la rocia and and you see crop you can tell it when it's in maturity everything like this is the end of all the ages wrapped up right now and so we're seeing i mean because god sent us of indicate a prophet because the the the word has completely been been unveiled and unsealed and and you see you see the revelation of the word but you see the revelations of everything you see the revelation of satan's family and god's family on earth because it's coming to maturity remember the story in the bible where he talked about the man that went forth with the tires they said well we pulled him up as soon as he said no no no no no because you'll kill the believers but wait until the harvest we're at the harvest and he said then we'll take the terrorists and we'll burn them first and then we'll take the believers and we'll put them in the palace amen hallelujah matthew 25 and 31 and the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him when they shall sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall he gather all the nations and shall separate them one from another so god's a separator if if we wanted to fill this place we could actually fill it but it wouldn't be separated i mean god's a separator it don't feel nice but it's we're not separators god's is god's words are separated amen remember that when the 70 got up and walked out on jesus he says 12 will you go also he never went after the 70. he intended he knew by predestination that they would get up and leave and before him gathered all the nations and he separated separated this is jesus talking by the way jesus separates them one from another the sheep divided he from the goats now how could god tell the difference from sheep to goats now i want you to keep this in your mind depart from me you workers of iniquity i don't know who you are no see they were in the same herd they they thought they were believers because they said god you know we've done miracles for many great signs preached and cast out demons and devils and see the anointings here reigns on the just and the unjust when god sends rain the wicked people get it too matt hallelujah i can't see that that light went funny uh 30 33 yeah there we go my prince and he shall set before the sheep on his right hand but the goats on his left now remember where the angel of the lord came to our prophet his right side hallelujah then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come and be blessed of of my father and inherit the kingdom inherit the kingdom of heaven prepared for you from the foundation that's a key part he knew who that would be the foundation of the world hallelujah for i was hungry now wait a minute i want to show you something here he's not saying i picked you up because you had long hair he said i'm not picking you out because what close your head on i said i'm not picking you out because how many times you went to church he said i'm not picking you out because of all these other things and we do believe them but he said i was hungry and you gave me me and he said i was thirsty and you gave me drink and he said i was a stranger and you took me in wow naked and ye clothed me and i was sick and you visited me and in prison i was in prison and you came unto me hallelujah remember the story of paul we're going to stop right there when god came down and woke paul up with that life he said who are you lord and the lord wasn't present in the flesh at that time he said i am jesus whom you're persecuting but jesus was not present but jesus didn't lie negan okay uh we got that one next one on my eyes i'm not being able to read my sheet and then show the righteous answer and say unto him lord when we when did we see thee i don't remember recognizing you this morning jesus and when did we and when did we next verse he said when saw we the a stranger and when did we take the end or naked and clothe thee when did we see you lord we i didn't recognize you lord no these are believers but they didn't recognize the lord or when do we saw these sick or in prison like lord we didn't recognize you and the king shall answer and say unto them barely barely i say unto you and so much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me then shall he say unto them that are on the left hand depart from me you curse it unto everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels it wasn't even prepared for them just the devil and his angels next verse for i was hungry and you gave me no meat i was thirsty and you gave me no drink when i was a stranger and you took me not in and i was naked and you closed me not and i was sick and i was in prison and you didn't visit me then shall also he answer and say unto the lamb lord when saw we and when were you hungry or a thirst or a stranger nagged or sick or in prison because and we did not minister unto them and when he shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you and so as much as ye did it not the one of the least of these you did it not to me hallelujah you may have your seats amen lord jesus we ask you to just come and minister your truth this morning lord in a special way and we give you all the glory and all the honor and praise your beautiful name amen amen girls i forgot to show the pictures and i really want to show them so let's uh put them up we're just i'm sorry just this is all part of worship all part of the plan of god man i just miss uh went right into speaking amen this is a huge huge huge testimony if you give a penny to this church uh nine times out of ten it probably got sent on amen a large percentage anyway and uh this is pastor leo's church it's completely finished except for a few windows and doors and it's uh really stirring satan up over there you know the pentecostal churches used to tell leo they said you know if you got the truth how come you don't have a vehicle how come you got to ride a motorcycle in the rain like you got everything but you don't have no god your god don't provide for you and you know that same devil told them things like when they did the foundation they said you will not live long enough to see this building finished you know because your god isn't big enough but that same devil is kind of excited now because the pentecostal church is just around the corner and they might get cleaned out you can uh turn the page uh picture yep yep there we go beautiful that's a testimony to almighty god one of the poorest countries close to one of the poorest countries probably in the world you you i feel like you questioned me on that one dollar of yours is 28 3 800 of theirs so if you have 250 dollars you have a million you're a millionaire in uganda amen pastor leo said they're going to be that's the end yep we go there that's the inside he said we're going to really have a time this sunday can you imagine to god be the glory okay this is a church that brick building on your right is uh we that's long dong in the philippines and when we preach there it was all bamboo and and uh straw ceiling and it blew down after me and luanne and amy were there and so we built that about eight years ago or so um and then he put a parsonage on beside it and he's probably been asking me for two years for a roof for the parsonage and so you can go there's the the green roof showing beside the black building so i sent him some money and it was half the roof and uh so i i told him i said uh he had sent me some pictures you can show more there vicky oh that's my my daddy um hey man yeah you see the the trees there just uh beautiful one of the prettiest islands in the philippines that's where all the pineapple come from and it's just an amazing place but god bless them we'll continue to finish the steel roof there and just thank you for all your love to pastor leo and they certainly are part of the family of god amen amen so back to our scripture and our thought where we were going in matthew matthew 7 and 23 he said here here's the people came to the judgment and they were planning on going into heaven and god didn't know them and then in the exact same book matthew we see just farther down god himself is judging how people he separated on the judgment and our prophet preached a message on that day at calvary and we might even play a short clip of it and i have many many many quotes from it and that but he said see god is our father and he said he was the greatest giver of all amen now we're not we're not saying giving largely may not be your your your money you know it's harder to give help or time than it is money especially here people in our country they gladly give you some money but don't ask them to do anything because well i'm really busy amen but don't be too busy for god amen and you see us as fathers on father's day and this time we see that our example is our heavenly father amen and we shouldn't just be as fathers we shouldn't just be dictators and and and put everything out see when god willingly wanted something done right he came himself when god himself came to abraham in the form of the three angels not that god was three but when the three angels came and and one of them was god himself he came down himself because this covenant was too important to be lost and here the bride of christ today god has come down god bless you brother fred welcome god has come down again himself and see here you know the bible talks about and let me just find it here in genesis 3 15 he said here here's god himself when in the fall of the garden and eve and satan the serpent and he said here he said he said after all these terrible things that happened god came and he was judging them and he said in in genesis 3 15 he said i will put enmity between thy seed and the serpent seed and it goes on and says and he'll bruise your heel and bruise his head but see here it wasn't just talking in the flesh it wasn't just talking that there's seeds in the flesh with no more mix with human seed but it was talking spiritually see that was satan himself and god was going to come down himself and come through the seat of a woman in the form of jesus christ jehovah and jesus christ was going to bring forth a family called his bride amen and that was the beginning of that seed and god said my bride will never mix never mix the word we'll never touch with satan's seed it's a physical impossibility the blood is different oh that should just make you lose your mind worshiping god you just think of that and the greatest promise that a father has in his family is that your children are your heritage and a happy is a man whose quiver's full of them but you can claim your children see your your heritage where christ started the family and he came through the scene and here god spoke these great words he said i'm putting empathy it's impossible to mix that's the seed genesis is the seed chapter no one can break that beard that's good until eternity amen we're not saved by some perchance satan can't touch you if you ever get your hands on that you're going to start bossing him around back off hallelujah that's amazing but remember in that picture what we said at the beginning satan believed the word how it fit his agenda in his contacts and he'd just throw an hand in or a butt once in a while but god's children will take the word exactly how it's portrayed to them and you see here he said here christ left the splendor of heaven he knew exactly it was going to hurt wasn't just in the flesh but just to think he was the boss but he was going to take shame for someone else brother dale and maybe you see he took the shame and the sins of the world because he was a father made to give and he didn't question whether he maybe would give you know he didn't want to die in the flesh but god it wasn't like hard for him to give see the the our prophet said and we're going to read many quotes later on he said eternal life and he has this scripture to back him up eternal life is living for others i don't mean like we're going to take up an offering for anybody no i don't mean that it's holding the door at the grocery store it's smiling to the person that's having a rotten day it's paying for somebody's coffee and tim horton's line if you happen to go through there or just however god would lay it on you know you know when he just says oh there's some just in the most you know wow god always knows when the time is the greed is the greatest just a little speck will just push you over and that's what jesus did himself in that day in calvary where he gave everything he was the bible says that no greater love has any man to delay down his life for his brother amen so many times we're so busy or so caught up and and you know we think money will fix everything but god wants your time and your family wants your time and your kids they don't care about your money they want your time you know what good would it be and i i was thinking of this this morning just in meditation i said what good would it be and i see people you can drive around it's in my family and distant families and different ones people that worked their brains out and their sin their family all went to satan and their family squandered everything some of the families in distant back that had much there's no real estate in that family name you know he could have had much much less and had his family in the family of god and they've been much much see it's a paradox it's a paradox you say well what's a paradox well it's something that seems unreal but it's true now our prophet said things like this he said we are because we came from god and we're going back to god we are creators satan is never a creator amen and you know like we said from genesis jesus rose up this new generation that you know the the word of god is the original seed and it is beautiful in how god made us and and so here we see the prophet and i'm just paraphrasing this story but he come home the one time and because the prophet's life was so busy and god had called him to a great ministry and and all these things and people would come by the house and and everything was in an uproar he came home the one time and his wife was so frazzled she was crying in the house the kids had dropped the mitts and they were fighting in the house and things were wrecked and the prophet said he said i could have come in and start giving orders now this is on uh this is a right here i got it in front of me he said i could have come in and started dropping orders but he said don't you know that you came from the creator and you are a creator and he said i come in and he said i said oh honey he said you know we're called to a great work and he said he said i started catching her spirit like jesus did the woman at the well and he said i started coming in he said you know why don't we he said i seen a dress up town that was really nice and he said i think we got you know things that went our way and the boat came in and maybe we'll tomorrow go up and and he started uh and and all the time the prophet's telling this story he said i was praying to god he said god bring your spirit through me into my family all the time all the time it wasn't it wasn't a man made it wasn't manufactured he said all the time he said i'm praying he said my wife was nervous he said he said god help them catch my your spirit through me he was he was trying to be a vessel where god could bring that just a hush over and he said the next thing you know the kids had put their mitts back on and they were paying with the blocks on the floor and he said the most amazing thing that goes back to this scripture he said honey step aside and i'll wash the dishes today the prophet the prophet now you know he had other ministries but we see very clearly in our scripture that when you needed me those were the ones that god put in heaven amen you notice in that scripture it wasn't just that they asked for money they said when i was in prison did you visit me when i was sick did you go by and see them amen and he said you know when i was washing the dishes you know my honey started talking about going to town the next day the kids and he said the whole atmosphere changed it wasn't because of money it was just because of kindness just courtesy hold the door you look beautiful this morning just he said what's that mean you are saying it to the lord jesus if you're part of the family that's why you know the family can never fight against one another you know the prophet said he said if you're doing the fighting you're in god's way he can't do it for you the bible says vengeance is mine saith the lord amen god help us to be out of the way amen and be there for someone else you never will believe how great a reward is waiting for you i want to read some of these quotes long that day at calvary there's many quotes but i want to tell you another story here this was a pharmacist i have it it's in the absolute 63 now you remember this is actually after the seals was open great revealing of the word these are all open and free for anyone you know that's one thing you'll find with the believer is he's not misplacing quotes or all the quotes are for our benefit you know amen you know the prophet taught us that prophets weren't infallible god only tells us prophets what they need to know prophets don't know everything they know what god knows they need to know amen and you know it's just so amazing i want to i want to read something here this uh i seen a quote the other day people see this and i preached on this a while ago and i had many years ago actually and uh and i'm not preaching on this but it just you come to me and i had it i printed off and i preached on you know the prophet said everybody wants gifts in the church the prophet said the greatest gifts god ever give to the church was the five-fold ministry man the greatest gifts but they don't want those gifts they want other things see what see when you're the bride of christ in your family it's all the package man you can't pick and choose and here's an israel uh israel and the church and this is a quote from our prophet and he said well they say i don't i this is i'm not making this up see how it's it's of the devil it's what it is if you see somebody picking and choosing just remember the garden just remember the garden that's all you got to remember it's the garden amen he said while they say well i don't need anyone to teach me glory to god i got the holy ghost now he said well then the holy ghost must have been wrong when he set the fivefold ministry and teachers in the church well that's the same vindicated prophet all the other quotes people were sending me this week he said god put them in the church as teachers and that settles it and he said why did he put teachers there if the holy ghost was going to do all the teaching without the teachers oh i don't believe that one that was before this amen see then just to go back to the garden remember satan quoted eve the quotes that's got not really said that's not the prophet said this oh praise god bless the lord he also said this too amen i'm sorry but it's good word it's good word anyway hallelujah hallelujah god is so amazing good he said you know romans 8 we don't have to go there but romans 8 5 and 7 it says that which is flesh is just flesh it's just flesh and i'm stirring up the flesh but he said that's the spirit oh it's of the spirit you decide what your god is my bible says that god is the spirit and those that that worship him will worship him in spirit and in all the truth amen hallelujah here here's a good baptist person here talking and he asked brother branham he said you know he said brother branham if i told you a story he said do you believe in a paradox and brother brahm said oh for sure i believe in a paradox he said well i thought you would he said i would never tell this story to anybody else because i don't feel they would believe me and they would think i was little cuckoo he said it was during the time of the depression and uh you could get medicine from the government you could wait in long lines and this man owned a drug store and there was a pregnant lady there with her husband and the line was like five or six hours long i'm just paraphrasing this i'm not trying to change it along and and she was very very sickly later in her delivery pregnancy and they come in to the pharmacy store because it was killing the lady to wait in line and the pharmacy young boy was out front and he said you know he put down the the uh pharmacy thing though this our prophet told us and it just so happens the message was are absolute also was the end of 63. and he told this story and he said they put down the the uh the thing from the doctor for the medicine and it was very obvious the woman was her husband was actually helping hold her up and and beside herself you know sick and her husband saying you know we'll soon have the medicine and you know this will help you amen and he so the young man turned to leave and he said to the boy he said by the way he said i don't have the money on me today but he said i will get it and come back and pay you i believe the government refunded the money or that they could get it in the line and the young boy said he said well i'm sorry sir but we're not allowed to fill prescriptions without the money and the man and his wife went to turn go out the door this is the father in the back and he said i was in the back filling prescriptions and he said i heard everything that was going on he said i come up and he said i said just wait a minute he said i got the details and he said just give me a minute he said i'll go fill that bring it back to you said i was fixing the prescription and the man was literally his wife was kind of collapsing and just it was just a bad situation you know they don't go into everything he says but i want to start reading here he said i fixed domestication as quick as i could to fill the prescription and he said when i started to put it in her head i'm sorry her hand had a nail scarf and her head and i looked up at her face she had the thorns on her brow and he said i touched my eyes and looked back again and he said i realized right then and so much as you've done it to the least of these he said do you believe me brother branham he said i put that in jesus act this is what the prophet said he said with all my heart doctor i believe every word you said with all my heart i believe every word you said amen here's god in heaven separating the sheep from the goats our heavenly father wasn't just concerned about what you could do for him so what can you do for god man every father will be concerned what they can do for somebody else but us as the bride of christ we should be concerned what we can do for others the prophet said repeatedly repeatedly living for others was eternal life that don't mean paying somebody else's bills that don't mean that we know there's people that come around the church just to get all they can get and man i understand that there's been i understand that totally there's there's bloodsuckers out there but you'll know the real you'll know the real and you know what i've been suck some of that blood before just give it to god god will give you more blood back i remember you know just just god knows it don't even matter god knows another country and you know we were doing things for message people and god's the ultimate judge amen so it don't matter even if it's if you did it with a pure heart and they mistreated you they mistreated christ and i would beg for mercy some of those people i begged for mercy from them i had a minister in another country and he wronged us and i said you know you you stole god's money i wouldn't want to be you but i forgive you i forgive you we know that and it makes us cautious but that is still no excuse why see remember when when uh in the bible in john 16 he said and even paul but the bible says in john 16 it said they will kill you and believe they're doing god a service but just think about that when you know in your history people that have maybe left the fellowship in any area but in an attacking way and they believe that now watch this those people are deceived but they believe with all their heart that they're helping god stay on this side of the quotes and they're latching back believing they're doing god a service in john 16 1-3 he said they'll kill you and think they're doing god a service and the bible says they don't even know who god is that's john 16 1-3 for anybody who would like to know that man it don't change just because we're in this tie but see we're in a laodicean age and everything is against you know it used to be i heard a story told about the minister's boy and uh this almost sounds uh far out there but he said my mom never knew what the car handle door was flower because her whole entire life he said if she thinks if she ties the car handle door it'll start and drive away without her because she in her whole entire life but see it used to be more like that a gentleman with tip when bro the prophet is around he tips hot he meets someone in the street tip his head every time really see how but but god never changed but see see how that was just a it was it wasn't a mocking it wasn't courtesy hold the door for everybody hold it over for someone you don't know amen the bible says in the end times see parents and children will come against each other it's all prophecy it's got to happen but it not always was so amen respect and honor one another i if it's all right i'd like to read some of these quotes that day on calvary i don't normally read it but the prophet just says it so beautifully amen and this is just it's just something that you don't hear every day and i believe it's good uh i really believe it's good food you know amen good for us to think on these things amen now he says here in that day in calvary in 60 he says now the first thing i want to say is jesus never lived for himself his life was always spent for others perfectly that's perfectly eternal life and he say well why go to church and i do good things and he said that's fine but when you live your life for yourself you haven't got eternal life eternal life is living for others and it proves it when you come in to the lamb of god he lived and had eternal life because he lived himself for others and if you receive eternal life by receiving receiving that day you won't live you don't live for yourself no more you live for others he said how can you stand and let anybody call you here they're saying i mentioned this i believe the last time i preached he said how can you stand here and let people call you all these bad names he said i don't live for myself he said i live for others and that you might redeem that man and you might become sons and he said the trouble of it is the church has forgot that they're sons and you're sons and you're taking christ's place so you're a son and you don't live for yourself you live for others he said you live for that man that hates you and the person that would kill you if they could he said that's what he done because they did kill him and he died that he might save them and that's eternal life and then you and when you have that in your bosom you're facing heaven then hallelujah ain't that so true it's so backed up with our scriptures that we ready man you don't you don't think of it in that way so many times especially in our generations hallelujah he said that's what the tabernacle and that's what all the people has got to do is find out what you are and that's what the real purpose is church going to church and playing music and singing songs he said church is a correct place to be but judgment begins in the house of god he said you must reckon yourself dad and let christ live amen any believer that's got that so in here he talks about the goats he said depart from me and he says he said you were hungry and you didn't feed me and i was in prison you didn't visit me and i was thirsty and you didn't water me said the part for me he said and on the sheep he says i was hungry and you fed me and all these things and you ministered on to me and he said notice it didn't fall to get this church in your heart forever it's so unconditionally done that's what i want to paraphrase it's not like a struggle you just you don't even think about it you hold the door oh i got that it's just it's just the little things that no you don't even mentally i should have done that he said it's unconditionally and i want to get into this he said the people don't do it for a line of duty he said a man gives you something or another he said because he ought to do it the man that feeds you because you ought to do it he said he's got the person to give it to you has got a selfish idea he said it should be your very life and your very action he's gonna watch us he said it was so surprising to see these sheep say well lord when did i do it he said it's so automatic out of love it's just in you it's just your life god let people see that on calvary what he did for us it was just so automatic hallelujah and look at what jesus said he said in so much that you've done it for these you did it for me an unselfish life not a second's thought you don't think about it but you're just so dead to the things of the world and live in christ that you're walking highway and the things are just so automatic you just do them he said it's not that you're just a part of him and his spirit's dwelling in you and you act like him he said you get it he said you get it there's a way that seemeth right but the end thereof's death i want there's a part here oh he said he said not say he said you know he said willow jones here he's talking about somebody coming back to him he said will jones he said one time she was out of coal oh i want you to catch this just think about it and i went over and i bought her some coal and i tell you i seen a brother that needed a suit a clothes and i went and got him a suit of clothes and he said god bless you i'm a christian oh my what now this is the same vindicated prophet that we read all these other quotes from he said oh my you selfish poor miserable person you are a hypocrite i read that i thought but they just did all those nice things do you know why he called them you selfish poor miserable person you are a hypocrite because they had to think about that they were doing it the same act but the different spirit on it sounds like when some people come to church or come over to your house and they act like it's a duty to show up i had other things to do but i felt like i should come really same vindicated profit how do you think somebody's going to feel when they're impr well you know i'd rather not be here but i knew you were in jail so i thought i'd well don't let me hold you up he said oh this is the problem he says the next paragraph he said don't let your right hand know what the left hand is doing the left know what the right hand is doing just automatically dead in christ till you do it anyhow and it's your just your nature your makeup you do it anyhow and it's just your life you don't even realize you're doing it it's completely yielded to the spirit of god and it just lives itself out you he said you feel the you he said you feel that blessed spirit that's life it's not me that liveth paul said but it's christ that liveth in me it's just so completely automatic well he said i tell you brother branham we are christians here and we're helping these people and we're helping them he said this blows my mind he said oh my shame on you that's not even christian wow christian is just automatic get that god it's done and you forgot about it it's all done he said see christ is just automatically surrendered life to god see he said i do nothing but the father show me first he said he gave himself for a public service to the people and he gave his life freely and he didn't have to do it he didn't give it begrudgingly do it he didn't say oh brethren oh i ought to think about the whole lot of me but because you come and die for me he never said the word about it he died anyhow because it was god in him he said it's something not something that you try to do you can't work yourself up to it that's a whole problem with people that's make believers you don't work yourself up to speaking in tongues you don't work yourself up to prophecy you don't work yourself up to get in the holy ghost you're either born in the family or you're not born in the family yes you'll accept the resurrection price to redeem you back amen but you don't have to work yourself up it's a part of you he said it's something that burns in you hallelujah but if you left great things undone it this is what self-sacrifice life is that god lived for you automatically doing what's right he said that's calvary meant to you on the highway opened up that day now remember you can't be a halfway goat in a halfway sheep it won't mix now remember genesis 3 15. ain't that that's just that's just so beautiful from then on god said i'll put enmity just think of that spiritually satan you will never touch in this last day we will have a bride of christ amen and you it won't there's nothing you can throw you can impersonate her you can indoctrinate her you can quote her half the word you will never stumble a word made bride amen you know how he said was accepting the the the proof of the baptism of the holy ghost was accepting the the word for your day and being able to say amen to every word of it not understand it just believe it by revelation he said you know i was reading a quote this day he said you know he said if you understood and understood everything you wouldn't need faith and he said faith is revelation god said it and i believe it and i don't understand it but that settles it for me hallelujah he said it's just automatic to something that you do more than then you're going to get a drink of water when you're thirsty it's you don't strain to think oh well oh golly i helped somebody amen he says here again he repeats it he said now you can't be halfway sheep and halfway goats if you have that without the other he said amen it's talking about the love of god and and that's all part of the package amen he said though i sell my goods to feed the poor and everything else amen but the bottom line is the love of christ come down but that love will tabernacle when love's projected everything else grace sovereign grace takes over amen and may they be born in the kingdom great kingdom of god the spiritual body essential body for christ he's talking about living for others here he said the light of god shines on their path and breaks forth the veil the veil that beautiful light and when they're walking the highway of holiness it's living for others as christ did amen amazing how your life is affects how christ will look at you on that day amazing that's an important thing to know in this day because in all these scriptures these people thought they were right and the in the 10 virgins they were all virgins they were holy people amen just not prepared these people that came up they didn't even recognize the christ they were doing it with and it's because the same time when paul was persecuting him he didn't recognize the believers as christ and the same people that outlash ah any believers in any way they're not recognized this our prophet said he said when somebody does things like that he said they don't recognize the presence of jehovah god and bad your skin they said i was just talking to brother dale uh-huh god remembers god help us amen god help us amen just let me go through wow thank you lord jesus so the christian life is not some kind of cool tool that keeps religious organizations moving a christian is not a christian a christian is a christ-like a christian cannot be a christian until christ is tabernacled in that man you can't be a christian unless you were born from god amen you can imitate it the life of christ and that produces the life of christ so living you the things that christ did he said you will do he said what am i talking about he said i'm talking about a personal relationship with christ what is it it's your life lived for others amen the church of god in the uh is a mighty member body a spiritual body for heaven you were born you were born here he says it here is your life worthy of the gospel you were born into the church of jesus christ he said christians oh you are personal relationship with god in order to be a son of god you must be come a relative to god a relationship with god you must be he must be your father in order for you to be his son the new birth the only thing that will produce is a relationship with god amen hallelujah hallelujah thank you lord jesus amen he said if you got eternal life there's only one form and that's god and you express attributes that'll be living for others and if you and if you're not then you're not going to be there anyhow no man can come to me except my father draw there's another one that's in the heavenly bridegroom here's an another one proving his word in in 64. i'm just reading the highlights he said you see it he said it's got predestinated this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age and he said when he pronouncing anything it to hap anything to happen it says it will happen and he knows the seed will be there just at that time and he predestinated a bride and she's going to be there in the rapture she's going to be there and he predestinated by his poor knowledge and see there's nothing there's nothing can stop it hallelujah thank you lord amen amen it's just so amazing to be a part of god's family man and to think that jesus came and brought this new this new family through how he was going to separate satan's uh lineage from the family of god amen and you see how just automatically you take the the characteristics of your dad hallelujah here he said jesus jesus only asked one thing that he prayed to his father amen that's the spirit of god he said you know you know what that was he said the one thing after all his sacrifice and all that he did on the earth for the world and his life that he lived and the path that he walked he said there was only one thing that he come back to the spirit of god and that's the father's sword he said that where i am you may be also that's all he ask god for his sacrifice that the family would be together that's a 65 quote hallelujah amen you know when a father comes home it should be the greatest joy when you think when you come in to worship god they don't just have to be here it was like when i was out and singing that song what a day that'll be and just the spirit of god if you just picture you get in the spirit but your family will get in the spirit and when a dad comes home her family and the family's reunited it should be the greatest joy that ever comes out the same as when the prophet come home and the house was in an uproar just if you can get the spirit out and catch your spirit settle it down amen let's come honey and we'll sing that song amen hallelujah god will never let this bride be touched enmity that's just beautiful i want to just read that closing genesis 3 15 i'll put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed just think of that spiritually speaking satan cannot touch the born again believer he cannot touch a believer that came from god oh he's going to try and impersonate it he's going to try and come quotes close amen god's new seed was the was to bring the faith back to jesus christ it's beautiful it's beautiful beautiful example we have of father's day is our heavenly father amen hallelujah hallelujah oh he's beautiful amen amen let's sing this song just when we think of it just think of what it'll be like when you get there the prophet said it'll be the noisiest place you've ever been at when you realize that you're at the end of your heartache struggle and pain be the most loudest place you've ever seen just like if your dad comes home from being away or a trip or that how the kids will rejoice to be around their dad times hundreds and hundreds of thousands our heavenly father it'll be an amazing time amen there is come in a day when the heart aches shall come no more clouds in the sky and no more days in the eye and all is [Music] that will be [Music] i shall see when i look upon his face [Music] and leads me through the promised land [Music] they [Music] oh think about it [Music] see and when i look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace [Music] me by [Music] that will be [Music] i shall see [Music] when he takes me by the head and leads me through [Music] hallelujah lord jesus we love you we thank you for your characteristics and your beautiful spirit how you gave everything you was for me and for us for the family lord jesus lord we're just flesh here we're full of lots and lots of mistakes lord by your grace by your amazing grace we desire and we believe and we pray to follow your perfect example to be a life of giving lord jesus the greatest thing you can do is give somebody the love of christ blessed blessed be your beautiful beautiful name bless all the fathers and dads lord jesus thank you for my dad lord jesus life of giving give everything he was for his family and for the kingdom of god what an example what an example we have we love you lord jesus with all of our heart amen thank you lord jesus i just want to close with this you can still play honey our absolute is christ's word it's a word of god so many people are getting mixed up with absolutes and they'll be lost if you have the wrong absolute you know our prophet even taught us that the flesh of jesus christ it's not our absolute the spirit that tabernacled in him was but not the flesh jesus if he could have by his choice wouldn't have died he asked the father to change his mind twice our prophet said that jesus spoke in riddles and that's why the disciples didn't understand them man but people get caught up you know the bible says don't have any graven image it's just flesh it's bad your skin the bad your skin in the temple god had to rip in two amen this is what the bible says heaven and earth will pass away that's hard i don't even comprehend that how's heaven pass away when i'm going to be there i don't comprehend that but heaven earth will pass away but this year word it won't pass away and you know so many people are looking even in this message and they're looking to different prophets and they're looking to our prophet it's not our absolute inside the message there is an absolute it's the word of god inside of it but not the flesh not every word that's the prophet's own words prophet's own words god help us to keep our our eyes set on the goal it's christ jesus amen god bless you this morning [Music] you
