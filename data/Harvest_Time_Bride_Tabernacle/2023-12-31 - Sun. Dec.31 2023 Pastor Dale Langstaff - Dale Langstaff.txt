my buddy brother Bart amen he's been working hard and and just haven't seen him for a little time and brother Bart sends me nice messages and fellowship and music and different things and it's it's beautiful how the bride of Christ can be friends and have a relationship together amen amen we praise God for that amen hallelujah let's just look into his word this morning and uh just as we're going we're going to turn to Isaiah 28 and then we're going to read in Matthew and just Isaiah 28 uh starting at verse uh two amen and just I just want to make make a a small disclaimer this morning uh uh this was God's plan this was not my plan but I said we were going to preach on Church order and Doctrine and I very very seldom preach more than one message on the same same topic almost almost never um this is going to probably be one of part three at least amen this is just kind of laying a foundation and trying to catch the spirit of Christ as the prophet preached Church order and Doctrine you know the prophet said this he said one of the one of the things that made him the sadus was people misinterpret or mishear what I've spoken the misinterpret mistake amen and uh and and by no means we believe the word of God so we're not talking about Doctrine as far as leaving the doctrine and the princip principles of Christ that's not possible because we're part of him that's just not possible but all of us you know the prophet said that we all have every church is Sovereign every home is Sovereign and we all have our own doctrines like individually that are are are upbringing and different things amen and there's where the trouble is in the body of Christ amen you you'll watch that you you will watch that and we'll look at it in the word of God Amen help us Lord Jesus behold the I got a different scripture than you Amy I got Isa isah 28 oh verse 8 maybe you should try that sorry my PR is small on my iPad I'm sorry I'm afraid to touch my iPad sometimes it disappears on me does tricks amen sorry Amy there we go for all the tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean Whom Shall teach knowledge and whom shall make understand Doctrine and they are they that are wean from the mouth that draw from the breast now there there the Bible's talking about the maturity of Christ amen there there's no way that a mature person needs to separate when they're on the word of God Amen God help us God help me man for precept must be upon precept and precept upon precept and line upon line and and line upon line and here a little there a little for with understanding for with for with staming lips sorry and another tongue he spake to this people to whom he said this the rest wherewith ye may cause the wean to rest the weary to rest and this the refreshing yet they would not hear but the word of Lord the word of the Lord was unto them precept upon precept and line upon line and line upon line and here a little there a little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and a snare be taken wherefore hear ye the word of the Lord ye scornful men that rule this people of Jerusalem wow I would say that today is directed at the ministry where wherefore you ministers that teach Doctrine over God's bride amen be careful careful let's turn to Matthew 116 Matthew 11 116 just one Short scripture here and and I want to just say this as you're turning to Matthew 11:6 you know the prophet said this multiple times they say when you die or you're dying you speak a different language you look that up he said that about 30 some times he said when you die and if we got the baptism of the Holy Ghost this morning we're all language amen it's it's got to be Christ language I don't mean individual language but when we die we're not speaking our own flesh language so that means we laid aside our upbringing that means we laid aside the old Creeds that our daddyy taught us because we're speaking a new language it's Christ language amen amen he said when you die and when Christ died we spoke a different language God help us to grasp that this morning amen one scripture is blessed is he whosoever is not offended in me amen Lord Jesus we pray that you would just bless your word and Lord you just be with the visitors and so many new people here today Lord and we preaching really to the home crowd and God we pray that you'd have your way and and catch the anointing and the spirit that you've revealed to me Lord Jesus in this thought and may your will be done and everything that's done and said be according to your word Lord Jesus we pray your beautiful name we pray amen you may have your seats this morning we welcome you it's a great honor great honor and our privilege our friends and amen hallelujah amen thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah you know we want to look into this topic of of uh of uh the church order and and just the thoughts and just laying a foundation and my next Sunday Lord willing if he allows me and we continue this same walk I'm going to preach on the the three Wells that Isaac dug and the first two Wells he had to keep moving on and the reason why Isaac had to dig the well but he wasn't allowed to stay with the well and and you know we're going to type that to the three pulls of brother Branham and how brother brandham brought the three pulls but he kept moving amen but the denominational world will never come under the third pull in the word the revealing of the word and the receiving of his seed they'll never do that amen and we just want to carry that on and show it it just is a beautiful type you know and and here in this day you know we know that we type Elisha's Ministry and we have a double portion and we're we're Elisha today a type of Elisha in his ministry and you know we're never ever you know for for us to believe and you know when we would teach Unity of the body of Christ and and these things we all we we we come under Unity of the word but we'll never come under Unity of our individual doctrines that's not going to happen and if you're looking for that you're looking in a in a myth and of dream that will never will never arrive because every home would have its own its own headship you know every Church would have its own headship un I'm not talking about leaving the word I'm talking about individual will will standards amen and here we see here we see so many things in the Bible that are wrote in a Paradox and you have to be a part of the family to understand the family talk you understand what I'm saying you have to be a part of the family of Christ to understand the family's talk amen like the Bible is not wrote like a newspaper we must read it between the lines and and in no way I'm going to say some things that are really out there really out there and in no way am I promoting sin no way no way at all but Abraham lied and when Paul wrote the doctrine men of about him in the New Testament he never ever mentioned it Isaac lied and it was never ever documented to him Rahab lied to hide the servants and she was give the promise now I'll tell you what for brother Dale that's that I have to chew on that one for amen now I don't say that no way to promote lying Bible says that there will be no Liars in heaven but God is the own his own interpreter of his word amen and we should never separate over our own things that we've had to die out to let me let me show you what I mean you know when the prophet preached Church order and Doctrine most of the church order Doctrine he didn't live himself I'm not offending the prophet I'm not I mean I'm not insulting the Prophet The Prophet says that himself the prophet said that his service should not be longer than 30 minutes he he apologizes three times in church order and Doctrine for that the prophet said that a pastor should not be in the Serv like should uh be set aside to come under the holy of holies and be under the anointing before he did that but he almost never did that himself and so see there was things said that were were in context in an ideal situation but weren't law you see what I mean like those are proper things but we're humans you know what I'm saying now now we don't make a trend of coming late to church or different things let me show you something what I'm trying to show you is we we have to we have to respect each other we need to have Grace for each other I didn't say compromise and I didn't say leave the word but no man gives somebody else Revelation if you have a higher Revelation than me you can't give it to me blessed are you Simon bar Jonah Flesh and Blood gave this to you by my Father which was in heaven so all you can do is go and pray for that dumb brother Dale that God would have mercy on me and open my blind eyes you see what I'm saying and so so many times there's friction in the body over things that it don't need to be friction over amen now I don't know why God's doing this but our church here locally have grown and God's blessed us and we fantastic friends that with all my heart I love and I don't want to see Satan come in and change that ever it's of the devil he does and see we need to we need to just have you know we were gone to Salvador and we had a wonderful time and I preached in four different churches and it wasn't until I come home that I even knew who was a member of which church because they were so IND dovetailed like this I couldn't know who sat under who pastor and who the Pastor wasn't close or far or near amen we're not going to have our own clicks and our own bedrooms in heaven amen because we have some kind of a different amen God help us to to realize this in this last day amen hallelujah you know we are the prophet said this he said we are the final voice to the final age under a prophet's Ministry and the only Bible the world ever seee is I know that they're my disciples by how they love one another amen and we we need to we need to mature on this case amen we need to mature greatly in this case you know I want to I want to start out by John here and here we see John and and and and and I'm I'm gonna show you well matter of fact I'm gonna I'm going to go some a different one let's go to Romans 14 1-4 and this will lay a strong Foundation that will establish where we're going a strong foundation and and and I want you to to to if you will with me is is is put this together in the scriptures and compare this in every stage of your life him that is weak in the faith receive ye him uhoh that means if you think you got of Revelation and a part of the faith that is greater than I haven't caught and I don't believe you still have to receive me but not doubtful disput disput for one believeth that he may eat all things and another who is weak eateth herbs now I want to tell you what I'm guilty in this are area right here so confession number one I have openly mocked people that don't eat me but the Bible corrects me right here uhhuh he said let not him which eateth despise him that eateth not uhoh that means you're to keep your conviction on eating meat or eating herbs to yourself now I want to tell you what the word of God says that Jesus Sanctified it all for us he told Peter that all is ho he Jesus himself told Peter he said don't call cursed what I bless okay and he actually calls those that can't receive that weak but he don't give you no chance to come against the weak he says You must receive them that means you must have fellowship with them oh bless God I don't uhoh I think that's why the prophet said when he was here there was like a thousand different denominations now we have a thousand different message denominations well bless God I go to son so's Camp me well I don't go to that camp meeting because we got bless God I go to thos camp meeting those are denominational spirits in the message amen amen God help us I I'm sorry for you visitors forgive me I just just you talk to God about this um because uh verse four he said who art thou that judges another uhoh now every one of us if you're breathing this morning morning you've done that thank you brother amen obiously amen for the rest of you if you're breathing this morning you've judged other people's opinion on herbs and meat and doctrines hallelujah amen to his own Master he standeth or filth yay he shall be held up hold it up for God praise God it's not the ministers or the Ley for God is able to make him stand weak and strong amen that's fairly plain God is able to make him stand or strong you see let me let me lay a lay more of a foundation here you see you see they came to Jesus now I would say that Jesus when he was here tabernacled in the flesh I would say that like he had it all together correct I mean he was the fullness of the godhead bodily tabernacled in flesh and the religious World condemned him and those Spirits are very healthy today wo Hallelujah they're very healthy today because Jesus took his disciples in a corn field and they were hungry and they pluck corn on the Sabbath oh bless God would you want me to tell you what in Philippines it's already Monday so what is the Sabbath I mean of course we know the Sabbath is the baptism of the Holy Ghost but if you were in the law under a Sabbath I would was raised under that my dad wouldn't do work on the Sabbath he wouldn't buy or sell on the Sabbath but what's the Sabbath it's already Monday there so it's fine to start to combine what are you going to do if it's in Alaska and it's dark 24 hours a day it's always evening time you see these things they're they're they're they're stumbling blocks in our flesh and here Jesus said he said but Jesus answered he said have you not read that David did when he went into the when he was hungry and went into the Tabernacle and ate the shoe Brad now I'll tell you what they were living under the law when that happened and it was dos and don'ts and God had the right to kill him amen because it was it was in the grace dispensation remember Moses wrote the law Paul wrote Grace and they were doing dos and don'ts and the shoe bread was for the the the ministry the Tabernacle and was he condemned now you you see what I'm saying you're not all gonna we have this crazy idea in this world of Education that we're going to have Jehovah completely figured out and we're going to put them in our box I'm going to put them right in my box right here and the box is going to have the address Wyoming sorry that ain't going to work amen now I'm in no way condoning I believe the prophet said this he said this is my absolute this was the prophet's quotebook that's what he quoted all the time and I believe that the the the Holy Spirit has come through a prophet and Anointed The it revealed the Mysteries that was everything was already in here completely revealed it and it's a brand new book and if our Prophet had to read between the lines you're going to have to read between the lines can you explain this can you explain how David was able to do that that's recorded amen I have this here somewhere in first Samuel anyway where David went in the priest actually feared David and David did that and God said we'll come to it later and David said there's a man after my own heart and he's breaking the word of God now I'm not I'm not bringing that that I don't I don't believe for one second I should go out and start breaking the word of God because I would be in sin but I'm trying to stretch I'm trying to lean you on this side of the road to bring us back in the center that we've separated over things that we thought we had figured out and there's nothing wrong with you you know there was nothing you know you know when we went to Salvador all four of those churches were within a 20 Drive half an hour stretch Maybe the there nothing wrong with that but if there was anything going on it was one church when we go to heaven it'll be one church amen it'll be one church and so we have to so here here let's just jump forward here and we go into to John here and now the the prophet said that John was the greatest messenger Of All Times They said everybody else in the word of God came and talked about Jesus but John actually said there he is right there Jesus himself said there was not a greater man born of a woman than John but John got in prison and we get in our prison sometimes it's called the lack of Fellowship you know the first thing I told the church when I come back from Mador is I said you all need to get on a plane and travel because see every country has different different uh what do you call it different uh you know Customs thank you customs and we separate over our custom oh bless God if I don't wear TI and I don't Customs you go to the Philippines and 90% of the people are wearing a t-shirt blue jeans and flipflops it's 120 you would die if you wore a threp suit it's called heat stroke you see Customs you see what I mean and when and if so any time we're going to bring a group of Believers together uhhuh we all have our little niche and we have to set that little niche aside I want to tell you something brother Dale had to do brother Dale had a lot to learn in his lifetime but I had to set niches aside just when we were in a Salvador let me just tell you one they give the time of the church when it starts so like a good brother uh we came a half an hour early but they announced the time a half an hour before the service starts a half an hour early so I sat in the Pew for over an hour and I was getting bad sores and they hadn't even sang the first song I oh bless God you're a liar no that was their custom that was their custom you see and if I would have let believe me believe me you've all been there if you're breathing you've all been there if I would to let Satan W me up I'll tell that person a thing or two here I am it was only 102 here I am sitting here and Satan is just saying oh he ain't getting nothing out of this service today did they do anything wrong no did I do anything wrong nope who won the devil if you let him you see do you know what that that church is his own custom is you want to fasten your seat belt for this you in the music department Jared for sure you if you're in the music department and you don't show up one hour before the half an hour before the service starts you're not allowed to play in the musician you sit in the Pew that's an hour and a half plus before the first song now is it my place to say anything ah thank you brother Gord no if those people are happy and they're serving God praise God I'm in Rome I'm going to do as a Romans do you see what I mean but we let Satan come in and then we go behind the scene and we find another person and we go and then when that person leaves the church splits and Satan's going I got him I got him you see it with me so remember that Paul brought Grace and and let me tell you a story about this you know there's a a story and probably some of you have read it or seen it but there was a man that was a Christian believer doing his best and he comes to church now is there any Angels here I know there's Angels here but I can't see them so like okay the ones I can see haven't put their hands on and by no fault of his own it's called a memory and I G to tell you something there's times me and LW will tell each other in house no we we can't forget we can't forget but we just just forgot something yesterday I was supposed to send sister dla bones I mean I'd have to like stick it on my forehead I'd have to like put flashing lights on it I mean like bones I mean how like just one word I mean just bones and he forgot to shut off his cell phone now I believe it's disrespectful if your cell phone rings this morning okay but are you a human okay so you're a human and his cell phone rung and the preacher rebuked him from the pulpit the Deacon came from the back and he rebuked him and his wife rebuked him on the way home guess where he went that night he went to the bar he went to the bar and he was so uptight from getting attacked attacked that he spilled his drink it don't matter what kind of drink it was I didn't say it was alcohol and the bartender come right over and said oh that's all right that happens all the time here go to this table we'll clean this up and here's a free drink uh commotion on the house and the end of the story is he's still attending the bar but he ain't went back to church you know some of you new people brother actually well I'll even say it brother Carson was talking wonderful fellowship and and they're going to be back next Sunday he was asking me who the deacons were in the church and and that just made me proud because I don't want people to know who the deacons are I don't want a church where the deacons go around with a revolver oh I know I know I know the prophet said they're the police they're they're still the policemen they're not non they're they're they're non-mark polien like they're disclosed they're like the Secret Service you see what I me we don't need to kill people you see what I'm saying like that that's not leaving the word my job is not to hurt you and neither's the Deacon's J now oh you say oh bless God we won't have church or no no no no no no is is anything out of order you still don't know who the deacons are is there to me when I went to a church not that long ago and it was fine it didn't affect I don't really know why but my wife came to me after he said honey what was he doing I said I don't know but for whatever reason it didn't affect me but the Min I'm preaching and the minister comes right up like almost walks five feet from the pole I thought he was going to stop me from preaching then he gets out and he walks down the side of the church and he's looking in every window like and my wife's there and she's distracted because of the distraction and that's order you know what I mean amen let me get back and I'm sorry if this is different than you thought I'm sorry but it's it's it's it's for it's just for the local crowd amen but I I don't want to see Satan be allowed to come in you know if you like green and I like blue and you think I should wear you know there's ministers think that it's it's against a laot of preaching not way shirt because it's reference I mean if okay I'm sorry I disappointed you this morning but maybe don't tell me you think that way I mean or don't tell anybody else at least come and tell me privately you see what I'm saying but here John was the one that introduced Christ he baptized now I be pretty hard to not understand who he was when the Holy Spirit came down in the form of a dove and a voice come out of that and said this is my beloved Son hear ye him now you can't get a lot clearer message than that and when John got in his livelihood he said I'm not sure if you're the one or not and that he gave Jesus the greatest insult a human could have gave I don't know if you're qualified I don't think you're going to cut the Jesus you could never be my pastor I'd never go across the road to hear you preach are you even him huh and bless God if that was me I i' say I'll show him a thing or two well if you haven't died yet you would have but see when you die you have a new language let me show you what that new language was Jesus answered and said unto them he said go show John the things that you hear and see and he said the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the death hear the dead are raised up and the power of the Gospel preached to him and then he says these words said blessed are he who is not offended because I am who I am and as they departed Jesus began to insult John and he said what went you out in the wilderness to see what came you to wyom to see you came to see brother tail you're going to be sadly disappointed I'm obes I wore a green shirt a reed shaking in the wind he said what want you out to see a man clothes in white linen oh praise God I didn't wear a white shirt this morning maybe I should have even Jesus talking about it behold they wear soft clothing in King's houses he looks like the a bishop oh but what want ye out to see a prophet yay I say unto you more than a now how could he been more than a prophet more than a prophet the only way he could have been as the wife of Christ the bride of Christ like you are this morning he said for this is he whom was written behold I'll send my messenger before my face to prepare the way for thee verily I say unto you you see Jesus returned the greatest the highest compliment it couldn't have been any higher it's not physically possible for the greatest insult receive that's scriptural Bible says blessed are you that are persecuted for righteousness sake for rejoice and be ex hallelujah praise God they didn't recognize me Hallelujah they didn't recognize Jesus they called him belah amen but you can tell by the fruits whether you've died yet because your language exposes you they said that about Peter here Peter is cursed Christ to save his what he thought was his own n and a woman said your speech she wasn't talking about the car your tongue reveals who you are amen let me ask you does and I'm sorry this was kind of on the same theme we preached on living a sermon but does our tongue reveal who we are does my tongue reveal who I am he's still working on me don't kid yourself there's no doubt about it we have no right brother Dale has no right to go behind the scenes and say you know this is a wonderful brother and sister oh that's up the devil right there close the garbage can I understand that maybe in the case of if you were if ministers were trying to protect what they thought were sheep God's sheep and there was a wolf that they actually believed was a wolf and amen see we have to be careful that we don't devour each other a prophet said he said We Fight Together in the front yard we fight against each other in the backyard but nobody knows about it nobody knows about it you know in Jeremiah the Lord came to if you read Jeremiah 30 the beginning the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in Jeremiah 1 and here he's talking about Jacob and he's talking about how Jacob had battled and people had come against him and and you read in verse 16 he said therefore they all that will devour you will be devoured themselves we need to be careful bride of Christ that we don't Devour the bride of Christ amongst the bride of Christ we don't need to point fingers outside the bride of Christ we just the bride of Christ you know if you don't agree with somebody say bless God him in that area and whatever he's doing for Christ you know if you want to be kicked I and my home Church probably knows this but if you ever want to be kicked do something for Christ and you won't have to worry you'll have a lineup they'll wait to kick you that's not right we're not going in a Rapture like that oh bless God he done that way bless God I would have picked a different address I would have started a different time I wouldn't have ate I would have ate I wouldn't have wore a green chart I wouldn't have picked him huh and that you know the message Hub is a great thing for ministers and the bride and so I went to the message Hub here on Jeremiah 30 verse 16 and 17 and the prophet commented on this and we want to read it he said how I would love to sprend the rest of the a few minutes and now I'd like to pick this up right here he's talking about that Jeremiah 30 amen 16 and 17 you want to read Jeremiah 30 but 16 and 17 and you can maybe pull them up and switch them if you want jerem girls he said regardless of how many people regardless of how many of the churches have gone back stay under the blood he said that's the place to abide in our outs ups and downs thick and thin whatever it may be stay under the blood but here he's talking about uh uh one of the daughters of of uh or or sorry this was uh uh Naomi when they went out from the land and God took her husband and her two sons amen and the daughters were with and he said she thought she would go to a better place and join mother group see here in this time people will always move because of famine or hardships but hardships are what build your character let me just throw this in here you know I told you about Pastor Jose and and being in El Salvador and him testifying to us stuff uh that you know I didn't even know about their Civil War in their country but you know all those people that we minister to live through that hardship and I'm just thinking wow I would have run I would have run all the old people lived through the Civil War the army shooting at the people then after the Civil War they lived through the gangs you know we St it at the pastor's house where he moved he moved this front door right out to the sidewalk put a gate because the gangs came and would knock and demand money and he pulled this girl out of school but they still went to church when the gangs were everywhere to demand money for protection I'm like these people have just went through basically well really bad times and they still serve God you know we're soft you know like look at China you know the I I'm just trying to I'm not trying I'm going to clarify this again I'm not condoning sin but your brothers and sisters in China lie every time they get together you know how they buy a birthday cake it's against the law for them to gather and if any Authority comes in the church they say we're having a birthday party that's a blatant lie are they your brothers and sisters well you don't have it's up to you to decide if they are they're liying to me you see what I mean see like when we draw hard lines I wouldn't have blessed God I'd never do that maybe you wouldn't but maybe it's recorded in the Bible multiple times that they did it look at Moses when God told him to pick a wife and his sister marked God and she struck her with Leprosy which is Eternal eternally lost I don't know God's God why do you do it I don't know it's not my business but it's not yours you know what I'm saying he said he said she left to join another group because they were having some troubles spiritual bread wasn't there restore it back I will restore it sayith the Lord he said stay in now watch this is a commandment the prophet saying he said stay in the field where it comes from in other words don't run when hardships come so we find that she began a long journey back because she had heard there was Revival and you'll notice it was in the barle season see we we we think sometimes we think we're going to help God I'll help you make up your decision you know what I mean and so we we want we want we want to be a bible-based message church but we don't want to devour each other we can actually disagree and you don't need to tell me amen that that that that brings Unity under the word it it like amen you you know I feel like there's something on the you know when when the when the the cloud came down and the seven angels and it was it was Christ the headship came down many people told the prophet he said go tell the scientists and the news what this really is and the prophet started to go and God stopped them the holy he says it like this he said the holy Spirit stop me he said it's not for them don't throw your pearls before the swine so I I brought I brought that up to say you know if God's gave you Revelation or a cut that you know is different than the pastors or anybody else's just keep it to yourself you know I I heard a minister talk you know I'm we we're doing good on time but I I got a a lot of stuff here to show you and things that our Prophet said you know I've noticed in the ministry that people will really hang on one part of what the prophet said but then when he comes on another spot they're kind of kind of loose on that you know and I say well if you're going to take a little bit of it is it okay if we take it all let me let me just well let me I I'll try to stay in order here but he said amongst a lot of people we find a where there's a lot of motions oh there you go and so forth and there becomes titling and backbiting and all kinds of ungodly things brother that's seuic acid in the church and it's demon power Spirit of man and woman who get among one another and try to push off and say well that's this ain't not right that Pastor is wrong this ain't right that Ministry is wrong bless God I have the spoken word that's not right well if you just Chase it down 90% of the time he said nine out of 10 times the very person that's making a stir in the group is the person that ain't right with God another place he said if you'll look in their closet normally they'll have a skeleton he said let me read it he said that very person making a steer is not right amen he said God hates Discord among the Brethren be reverent be holy love God and stand by God as long as you know your life is right and your heart is pure and your thought is pure and love toward the brother and trying to uphold the the kingdom of God we're not most cases we're not trying to uphold the kingdom of God we're trying to uphold our own kingdom amen thank you brother well that'll hurt my pride maybe that's what you need amen who does the church belong to whose bride is it do you know eler when he brought Rebecca to Isaac he's never mentioned again so the pastor wasn't too valuable in that case it's about Christ and his bride his wife it's not you do to me we're if if if you're going to somebody and he's pointing to himself oh run for your life man enticing Spirits going forth demons under dis discretion and the last days we're in the last days we're in the end times amen God help us I'm saying this for the bride of Christ we must we must dwell together here before we're going to dwell together there amen and anybody that can't dwell together here ain't going to be there amen now I'm not saying that there I think every town should have a chch be able to come together whenever it's you know there's a big pwell going on amen hallelujah amen so I mentioned about Abraham Isaac and Rahab already Rahab lied and got blessing for it that's a paradox that's that's a paradox you can study that as long as you want to it's a paradox she blatantly lied amen so you you can you know you hear people say oh bless God we should follow what the government says Rahab never they K came to her house said turn them over she said they've already gone I'll say amen for you do I understand all that NOP I don't but we have to be careful we don't drive our Stakes down too far because when we do that we separate and that's not of God Amen God help us amen we already mentioned about David that's 1 Samuel 21 1-6 1 Samuel 1 21 1-6 where David went in the Tabernacle and took the SHO bread that was unlawful for him to do and God never said one word about it matter of fact quite the opposite God actually used that for an example in the New Testament how he never judged it you see to me you're trying to figure out this you know the the prophet said things like this he said you're never going to learn and study and find out who job is your brain's only three pounds you might be a genius but he's Jehovah amen I I I heard that the person answering an atheist you know and talking about the computer and the definition of God and and and he said he said if you could figure out my God in your three prown bring it wouldn't be the God I serve so our Prophet said this he said if you find somebody that's got all the answers even though in the same sentence we believe all the Mysteries are revealed he said run for your life because he don't know wow here the prophet talks about another thing I want to show you how God Chang and I just got two or three more things it's just quarter after 11 we're doing good amen here here the prophet I want to show you how the prophet's Revelation grew and and I want to I want to close with a a real shocker to you but here here the prophet was in his own church and he had been visitors and he was preaching New Year's Eve service and he was preaching on Daniel and Revelations amen and the people got so excited by the way I just for a disclaimer if you get excited in the church when you're preaching it won't distract me it'll be just say sium it won't matter if you're dancing shouting or walking or if it's in the spirit it won't affect me because it's in the same spirit amen and the prophet said I was so skeptic of that kind in my heart criticize that in my heart people started rejoicing and they were free and you know the story I know you know but he tells this in 61 by the way and only believe and he said a a woman came out and started dancing in the alleyway he said i' never been to a dance in my life uh oh see I can understand this because we weren't allowed to dance when we were kids and when the school had a dance at the public school we s out they knew that from our parents amen so I can fit right into where the prophet's thinking was that's evil and then he said I started thinking you know these two or three people I at first he says Oh my he said what are they doing in my church couldn't they just serve God and shut up they're being so on disrespectful that's not Church order and daughter chist God things are out of control uhoh and then he said I got thinking about the Bible this is all when it's going on he said right up and down the floor he said as hard as she could go she was dancing like that that old girl about 16 or 18 we would have you know what a 16 year old girl started dancing around this church this morning I'll guarantee you there's some of you in there with question you know why you know how I know that because you're a human ah she's too young to know ah she's too old to know I wouldn't do that I've never done that that's exactly how the prophet thought praise God and he said you know he said isn't that something he said right here in my church however they am I going to live this down they're they're they're cursing the church see he said watching her like this in my thought he said what are they doing for why why do they have to do this I'm trying to show see the prophet was trying to put a cap on it but it was God and he said why could what watch the prophet watch his language he said why couldn't they just play their music and went on and let it alone oh bless God I wouldn't have done it that way uhuh so so because of that you won't go to that camp meeting you won't go to that special meetings and I thought well that what watch his exact words this paragraph 10 this was a 61 mess he said that's terrible that's terrible they haven't got church order and doctor now now you know I believe in church order and Doctrine I'm just I'm showing you a I'm showing you a balance here show I'm showing you the balance from church order if you're not in order you're disrespectful I'm not condoning disrespect no no disrespect needs the the rod of Direction but we're not but this ain't the case see this was it was a it was a Creed that he had grew up with and he he'd been raised with it he never done it and he didn't understand it and he thought it was out of control the prophet and he's telling this in 61 and only believe and he said I got to thinking now there in the Bible there was things like dancing and I got to remember that David danced around the ark and all these things and he said he danced before the Lord and the Lord said he was a man after my own heart he said I got to think it well that's not you see how he uhhuh that would be the same way as brother Dale going a half an hour early on a service that's already booked a half an hour early and so I sat there for an hour and 10 minutes before the first song Started I like how my wife like I'm like this bless God that's not how we do it yeah and he said I got to thinking well maybe I haven't got the victory he said he said he realized that he talked about maram that went dancing with the tambourine when the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea and all the sisters come up and danc and it was all Victory and thing he said maybe I'm not converted maybe I ain't got the victory' and he see I got to thinking about this and he said you know what happened after a while he said I started patting my feet and he said before you know what I was out dancing on the aisle with the sister now that's a drastic change and most of us sadly most of us wouldn't be willing to do it would' say ah bless God I've done this for 30 years I ain't about to change now God give me this and I'm not moving to this that's what the denominational churches did said God give me this but I'm not moving to this and God said no problem I moved on he went from Luther to Wesley and then he went from Wesley to Pentecost real the gifts and then he went to the opening of the word uhuh just like Isaac drilled one well he he unplugged all his his own Wells of David his dad Abraham he unplugged all those Wells and then he went over and he went to this church and he dug a well and I'm getting into next Sunday serving but this is this is just powerful I mean this revealed my whole life when God showed me this and there was no problem when Isaac was digging the well brother Matt but as soon as water come up and there was signs and wonders look out Go the whole place filled up there wasn't even room for Isaac amazing how that happened well this is mine this building's mine this ministry is mine it's mine this God's mine this message is mine and I won't share bless God you're gonna have to go get dig another well that's what Isaac had to do and Isaac said okay I love you Brothers but there's not room for me to get a drink of water so I'm going to go and he said they did the people that kept it remember they didn't dig it they didn't dig it so he went to wall number two and you know what wall number two was I'm sorry for those of you be here next Sunday but he deal the world number two and there was no water in that well either until the water came and it was W and you know what sprung up on that well hatred and envy said bless God I don't like you you think I'm making this up you read your Bible that's why the prophet couldn't find nobody in the second pull to to have them preach in the thir bless God I don't like your ministry no more I'm going to go to a different I'm going to send my missionary money somewhere else where God can really use it and you know what Isaac did he said oh I love you Brothers but I can't drink so I'm going to go and I'm going to dig another well and the water come up and praise God he said this is what the prophet said in the Bible said the Lord has made room for us all the Lord's made room for us all who dug the wells and he wasn't able to keep them uhhuh powerful you wonder why you got to move in your spiritual life where something starts in your spiritual life life and there's no water there for you to drink read Isaac do you think he was happy to move on does anybody have any idea what it's like to dig a well back then well if you want to have an idea I have some pictures from Uganda where they dug it all by hand 50 I think they went about 56 feet before they hit any water they come back and went another 20t deep and then put brick around it that was at the orphanage by hand no safety precautions in there if that well would have caved in they would have been buried to life and they would just I'm not the man going down there now it's 120 with air there wasn't a big Breeze down in that well 70 feet in the ground can you imagine I'm trying to think of Isaac if I had been Isaac I would have pulled out my guns and said uh excuse me this is my water I'm just being I'm just human enough you think you would have just W oh bless God I'll just move on I mean I enjoy digging 70 feet deep oh no no no no if you got any uh oh but if you've died see those are a perfect shadow of the three-fold ministry and we're going to go into that next week we'll leave it there look at here where the Prophet messes and I got two more topics and my iPad even shut down it said it's time to close whatever that means uh that people mistake from the prophet you know what I'm saying we it's like it's like well it's I'm I want I want you to get it's the devil because anytime somebody says this is God and you can't have it and I got them and you can't and it's my kingdom and I didn't even dig the well huh h Huh here the prophet said he said now you know you ladies today you ladies that wear hats he said and you say that's your covering he said that's wrong Now ladies today don't say that I mean not in our church amen but he said lady's hair is recovering now that's Bible That's Bible but watch how people take that now there's a country I've had ministers tell me if you sisters showed up now I grew up in a church where 98% of the women wore a hat and I tell you what you want to be decked out you want to see the fanciest pictures of me and thew when we go to a coup's party woohoo it's when she puts on a $100 hat amen now that's class okay but there's message churches that if a sister showed up with hair dragging on the ground and she had a hat on her head they wouldn't let her in the church I I I I I've got that straight from Pastor to Pastor okay because they said oh bless God the prophet said the you can't wear a hat no no no no no no no no he said you can't make the Hat you're covering she's never cut her hair she can wear a hat to look party hello that's not compromise but that's the type of things that starts other caps so if I mean I would struggle with that that same area if you're in a position and the church you must by Church order and law wear a tie or you get demoted a lot of us would be demoted in our church but like that's in St Luke 45 it's version number uh it's like there's a lot of new virgins in the Bible it's uh it's like the cwe or something you know we have enough things to follow in the Bible that are are salvation issues salvation issues there you go hallel we have enough things to follow and Obey for the baptism of the Holy Ghost we don't need men's laws and digas a lot of the Bible's types and sadles amen it's like just like the Lord's Supper the Bible says yes Jesus did it in the supper time I don't care if you disagree with me it it don't make no difference the Bible says this do in remembrance it's a ceremony of remembrance and if you do it at night time here it's dinner time in the Philippines so somebody's backsliding hello I mean if you want to be doctrinally right about that the only person that did communion right was the Lord Jesus cuz every other country it was a different time the Philippines is 12 hours ahead of us Africa is eight hours ahead of us so like Leo he's probably already doing might be you know what I mean hey if you want to go to that law you go right back to the Sabbath well let me see I can't start my combine on the Sabbath but it's already 5:00 in the Philippines I wonder if God would understand is this a god of a country or a god of a universe you see to mean amen I mean you can mention Christmas the prophet anything the prophet preached about Christmas and Easter it's Pagan it's 100% Pagan Google will tell you it's Pagan this Bible will tell you it's Pagan and brother Dale don't grow a Christmas tree Jeremiah says don't be like the heathens take an ax and whack a tree them but he said there he goes he's compromises but you're little kitties praise God there's none in public school n this church hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus we don't want to find out what sex they aren't amen hallelujah God give your children to teach your yourself not the government in what kind of a world did God give Holy Ghost build mother and father the children and say the government's going to teach my kids that's ridiculous the Bible says train up a child in the way he shall go and don't let trudel or Hitler teach them thus sayith the pastor if God give you the kids you teach them yourself oh God put the under them so when I send them to the devil's the prophet said that when you go in places the Holy Spirit Waits outside hello hello he said if you intentionally go to a strip bar the Holy Spirit can't go in there with you so he waits outside but you think you can send your kids there you need prayer you need a lot of prayer that was free because that wasn't on there but the pro back to the Christmas but he said your kids if they were in school praise God they're not or they hear about kids getting a present that he said they don't understand he said it's like a two Tire it's here to stay so if you have a little kid and all the other kids in town are getting a present buy him a present just tell them the true meaning Jesus was born in April or May he was a lamb and it's not this time of year they're worshiping the Sun God because they think the soulless is going to burn up and all this Greenery is because there's not going to be no more sun but here here's a new bike go ride it and have all your kids over and invite me over and we'll party we'll eat hamburgers amen that's called Fellowship you you're not going to the profit never said bless God I'm going to change the world I'm going to get them to stop changing Christmas no no and see along that same Spirit you're not going to change everybody to your own personal Doctrine Revelation on the word of God either don't even try because it'll get you all riled up and fussy and I I don't understand what you don't see it just exactly like I do well because you're two different human beings that are at two different levels and two different things and just let you know God he's still Jehovah he can do a lot of amazing things amen oh man God help amen I want to just I want to close on this thing here matter of fact I'm going to close my iPad you know what I mean I'm just saying we have to we have to be respectful to one another respectful is there anything wrong with respect yes I believe like if there was a kid 10 years old and they're being disrespectful in the sanctuary they're going to be dealt with yes sir but if they're two months old take a pill they're two months old there's no kid under the age of seven that ever have to Disturbed me preaching God has given me a volume that I just control it up here I just turn it up amen if those kids didn't make noise and they sat still you take them to the doctor because they had epilepsy or something God made kids to way go amen you and this is free but I don't know where this go you know the disciples were bothered by children you know what Jesus told them back off and if you don't become like them Wiggly and movie you won't even be in the kingdom of heaven and you can go a lot further with that and I'm just going to throw this out there was I mentioned this Wednesday I don't know why I'm preaching two sermons in one you watch when Jeremiah went went around the walls of Jericho amen so I'm going to shock you all and I do have one I have one more quote I'd like to do after but I'm going to shock you so there's something on Church order and doctrine that I don't agree with the prophet it's all right I'm not that's not evil there church order and Doctrine the prophet said that if your kids can't be quiet in church leave them home that's on scriptural because the disciples tried to keep them from Jesus and he said back off bring them on now now listen listen this is where the prophets write if they're nine or 10 they don't need to be left at home they need the rod of Correction and they used to call it when I was a kid they used to call it the Woodshed and it's soed under the back tree and nowadays it'd have to be insulated so the government couldn't hear you and it's called give them a good old thrashing because that's disrespect but children are children and they will do what children do and that's not disrespectful and so you see when they went around the walls of Jericho the children had to be there for those walls to come down Joshua had to take the people out of the old age home and push them in the wheelchair he had to wait till the mothers changed all the baby and did all the breastfeeding well wait wait I got a diaper I got a dirty one here just hold on wait I got to be a part of this seven you don't think so read your Bible just go read your Bible and see if Joshua would have went around the walls if the walls would have come down without the old people and the young people said every soul soul that's if you're breathing amen but you see how we see we get if we get in different ages probably God help me if I don't get that way but you know we get old and crunchy well I don't understand kids no more or I'm ready you know I mean hey I remember what it's was like we had nine under we had six under nine I remember people in other churches is coming to me six kids undernight and saying hey uh your kids disturb me I said well stop breathing then I think you should sit in a different spot in church I don't want a church like that so I'm going to go to a different well that that's plain preaching but I'm sorry if that offends you but that's just factually the truth I have a Bible to back it up I'm going to a different well where there's room for all of us that's just Amen in this church there's room for kids because brother Dale won't be here forever and if God carries and I know the Rapture is overdoing it's past doing it might be my fault but if the Rapture terries it'll be the kids that carry on Amen we need to have a little bit of understanding and a little bit of love and respect and understand that we're all breathing humans like the guy that made the mistake on his cell phone I'm to close with this one thought and I'm just going to forewarn you before I close on this you're going to think that brother Dale has some kind of an agenda or something I I'm just going to clarify just for you know for the Satan's sake I don't but this was in 64 so this is after the Seal's questions and answers and you know this is for the people that love this part but they don't like this part you know and by God's grace you know I I I promised God when he called me here to this area I'll preach exactly what you give me if it's me and my wife period because because I'm going to get over there I'm going to have a clearing conscience I like to sleep when I lay my head down in that pillow there ain't going to be no phony baloney Amen brother Brown said I preached to thousands of PE tens of thousands exact quote that were completely newe [Music] this is 64 this is after the seals so his Revelation is very sharp so what would you do this morning if a lady from town walks in in a two-piece bikini she can sit any Pew in this church she wants to and the word will now now wait no this wait a minute now now if that was a backs sitting sister that had left the church and knew better or something like oh that would should be handled differently so you know you were raised in a home that's Defiance that's called iniquity to know but if somebody walks in from the world that you have never seen before except in the grocery store she's welcome in this church amen yep she might be the woman at the well that Jesus said I have an appointment and all you religious message Believers I'm going to send you up town to buy groceries like his disciples because your nose is too high in the air and you won't receive a prostitute uh oh uh oh oh ouch I don't like that ouch huh that's that's what our Prophet said said the disciples had a religious spirit on them and Jesus Jehovah sent them up town to buy physical food because he had an spiritual appointment with the prostitute that nobody would allow in her church she came to the well remember alone a different time when no other church members were at the well because she was not accepted oh you don't like that one at all I know you don't you I don't like that makes me really uncomfortable but she was a predestinated seed and you know what the Rapture is waiting for the last predestinated seed and it might be black in color of skin or it might be black in the color of sin and it very well could be in Wyoming because if you've heard the testimony it was definitely God that put this little place here Lighthouse and how will we receive her I didn't say compromise with her amen amen glory to God it's still the same message Hallelujah he said I was talking to some friends I'm going to read some of this because you just got to hear it from him because it's very clear away up in the mountains and there were some young women and I just prayed for her baby it had Upsy and the baby baby was well and the little poor family way up in the holler up there and they were black they had a black Tobacco Patch around the house and two rooms in the house there were seven or eight children and the wom folks and I said oh my just a board ax out there and she chopped her firewood and things like this hoing the garden and canning stuff and and I said I looked at that poor woman and she had the same dress on that she had two years ago and all the splits up and everything and I was trying to find some of medus me his wife dress for her to wear the next week and he said and and we were noticed standing there a couple of the brothers and I and this lady was nursing her baby and she just removed her breast and just dropped it out there and from her from her dress and began to nurse her baby and it was kind of an amazing minute for me that's the way my mama nursed me he said that's exactly right next paragraph paragraph 25 remember this is in 6408 he said I have more honor for a woman like that than I have for some of these women that'll put little Ola straps under them and throw them out like that and they don't even look human I want to tell you something that was shocking I'm I please forgive me brother I God had just already talked to me ahead of time so th this is for the home you know do you know we physically had people leave this church leave and they have the message on my phone because they thought there was sisters in the church that were at their home and did not have a bra on now is that the 100% the truth 100% the truth 100% the truth and I I'm just like I'm like I'm like I'm like you see what I mean Satan that's his thing you know I was preaching in Ghana I was preaching for Pastor John and I don't know his last name and it doesn't matter but he was right close to an orphanage that that we had been to actually Vanessa stayed at the orphanage do you remember his last name Vanessa I said don't matter anyway and I was just letting her fly and I had pictures of it and right where my wife's sitting a sister just dropped her thing out and the baby was nursing and I was just flying I looked and and you have to be a minister to understand it it it didn't affect me because I was under the anointing but the next time I looked over the baby had liked my and the baby was on up till the baby was looking around and the MK was just running over and the mother just put her finger over the end of it like this and the baby's like how you doing white preacher I said I'm doing good and all of a sudden the baby just hit the mama and went back on her breast and she was in the second row in Pastor John's Church in Ghana next to the orphanage about four hours where John Dan actually came from now what would most of you do if that happened here like are they part of the Bride are they Believers see our Prophet said that there was no sexual desire in feeding the baby she was doing what she was Barn to do doing Barn to do there was no and so I I'm I'm I'm just I'm trying to prove a point how we separate over foolish things they're all foolish even if you think your doctr good it's still foolish because behold how they love one another how they can Fellowship together and it'll never be the same Doctrine but you can lay aside your Doctrine to Fellowship amen so the last time we were at Pastor Leo's and I hope nobody watches this they got night service so I'm at Pastor Leo's and there's tents on three sides of the church one tent on the back was for people to eat under but on the side right and the front of the church was all tents the church holds like 600 people and all the you know like like under the tents was full too he had physically told pastors that come do not bring your church we have no room to sit them okay that's pretty plain am me so there's a lot of people there and so I my whole key I'm just thinking there like they really raise you up like a white God and I try to bring myself down and eat with the kids and so I go around I shake all the kids hand I shake every single person you know the most oldest and the ugliest and the youngest and everybody's hand so I go out to the town I'm shaking and I was like whoa oh oh I'm sorry I'm sorry and everybody was exposed I'm like I think I'll go back in the church building but if we were here in North America say bless God we're educated we're not doing that I went to different Cemetery I wouldn't be a part of that kind of stuff you know and so we go to different camp meeting and we have a denominational spirit and we separate over over something that has never ever been told you know the denominational they have like a membership book and it's like you must not color your hair you can cut it but don't color it you know I'm just you know you you want to see how I'm sorry but I but are we beyond the book I don't mean the Bible and I don't mean the message but do we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost let me let me close with this thought you know the prophet had a sister come up and she said Prophet I don't wear slacks now I believe in Holiness and you with see God so you won't be there if you want to wear women's clothes or men's clothes I hope you enjoy hell it's no problem but my sisters my daughters do construction and that's not illegal I I never found that anywhere in the Bible where that was illegal in the Bible never seen that if you find it you can send children them in private uh and so there was people that struggled with them wearing pants with a dress over it now like if it gets to minus 20 and you go on a genie boom like jar Genie boom we need to fix the bell at the thing praise God I got a whole bunch of kids do construction but I got to wait for the Bell fix uh it goes I think 65t in the air now you would be a little exposed if you only had a dress and your underwear on so you wear pants it's minus 25 and a dress over it completely to the knee you know what the prophet said you want to know what your Prophet said he said you you want to know what modesty is read the Old Testament where the Levites and the priests they covered their thigh and the prophet goes right along with the Bible and he says if your knee is exposed you Mar your testimony that's good for men and women if you show your knee you Mar your testimony okay so if your knee is covered and you're a man you're not wearing shorts because your knee's covered that's th sayith the prophet if you have trouble with that the him when you get to heaven you know or wherever you get but uh so there was also people that rebuked me for my girls wearing pants under their dress and they sent me the quote on my nice little phone here my nice pretty like wonderful phone it's amazing how people send you nice little messages and they highlighted the part where the Prophet said that it was illegal for a girl to wear overhauls but he didn't say nothing about putting a dress over the overhauls do you know what a jumper skirt is it's an overhaul with the skirt bottom and the prophet talked about a tuxedo on the bib overhauls and a jumper skirt that with the skirt bottom had pants on it now you want to watch how foolish people are and I promise I'm closing on this one close there was people in Africa so this sister came to brother Brown and he said brother Brown I don't wear slacks I wear shorts and brother Brown said well that's worse than wearing pants you're supposed to wear a dress and so the people in Africa took it see now the prophet also took that a guy that was a wore Grandma's underwear because Grandma's underwear used to be like you know about this now Grandma's underwear didn't go below the knee because but it was like long underwear so they took it that it was worse to wear shorts than it was to wear slacks so they passed the lawn their church I'm not making this up you're going to think I'm making this up I want to show you how ridiculous we separate over that the sisters couldn't wear underwear because it was pants under their dress until so they were wearing a man's garment and it was worse than slacks and if you would like to meet some of those people or have their name I can give it to you because I've been to Africa three times so you send a fat white person over there and I said are preaching I'm just preaching the word of God and they they got her like flies I'm like what did I say what did you say you interrupted their own private Doctrine and their own kingdom and so they left you see you see now that is the truth and I did not make that up and I have names and numbers I can give you but you see how far people will be foolish So In This Very church this very Church we've had people leave I like because they didn't think some people wore a bra how they knew that uh you know I but did you you but this isn't a message they're actually going to another message Church in Ontario okay hello so if you go to Convention to camp meeting you're probably going to sit beside that person and I've also had people tell me that if my girls wore a dress over any outer uniform they were wearing mans of perel and that was a sin so they couldn't wear underwear they couldn't wear long legging socks they couldn't wear long johns I mean that really goes in the ditch man that really goes fire out there you see what I mean and so you know in church order and Doctrine we want order and we want God's Will and we want Holiness and we want all the spirits of the gifts and we want the whole word revealed we we have healings and signs and wonders and but the word I mean we want want but we want more than anything we want feed of Christ in our belly and that'll be the word the prophet said this that every word of God is a seed and so if I mention one word that you had trouble chewing you're not pregnant this morning because you're saying well I won't go there well that was maybe your Manchild that you were going to deliver but you refused it and the prophet said if you did you weren't worthy let's stand let's stand God help brother Dale to be to be to be on the word in the spirit but balance not not in these things I could name dozens and I will next week I I'll if if you want to hear more surprises come next week I D you doesn't and dozens of things that message Believers believe and for everyone I can show you a dozen to 20 exact contradictory and Old Testament where in the world do they get that you know what it is they're not dead they never died they never died and they never got a new language when they died that's exactly what it is God help us God help me God help us all you know what we do more harm than we'll ever do good by putting something on somebody that God never ever meant for it to be never ever meant hallelujah thank you Lord St sheltered In The Arms Of God I feel the T of hand so kind and tender they're leading me in pth that I must [Music] run I no fear then Jesus walks beside me for I'm shant In The Arms Of God so let the sun High the dark CL rise

me for I'm said in the arm of God I want to just share this with you as we sing another song you know in Jeremiah 30 I really encourage you to read it in verse 8 God promises to break the Yoke of bondage that was around Jacob and what his enemies had attacked him amen and I don't know if you know just recently the you know people and and we have it we need to learn to be careful what we speak God won't be mocked God won't be mocked that's good advice for brother Dale also any of you that seen online the Turkish leader started to mock Israel and tell the UN that Israel would pay from Allah for what they're doing and he fell immediately out of that apum and they buried him two days later he was pronounced dead let me read for it two days later and you think that you can go around and preach your mouth against the bride and wife of Christ you're walking Where Angels With Fear To Tread On hot cools because God's still God and just like he opened up the Earth and swallowed up Nathan and car for blaspheming God's chosen one he just did it again in Israel you want to see God alive and well today go to the UN you don't even have to go to a message church you can go to the UN because God's in both of them and he won't be mocked amen God help us when we say things that we think we're right Moses sister did that too and Moses had to go and beg God for her for her life man I'm just trying to say that sometimes God does things that we will not understand on this side we will not understand most people didn't understand why he would call Brother Brenham with no education and couldn't speak good and they laughed him to scorn when he gave them their testimony of the vision that he would testify and pray before Kings and that that his Pastor said your stomach is upset you must eaten something really strong last night God help help us God help us that's the same God today when people are serving God Amen God help us let's sing all is well and we're going to close on this service D thank you Lord Jesus it's all well he's got it all in control amen there's a story in the Bible of elishah the sh my woman Anders son the woman found favor with God and he gave her a son W work came in the FI the little boy died but the woman face and even in death she testified that all is well all is well [Music] all we have heard the message of Lord and all is [Applause] [Music] well there is a place of perfect rest behind in so [Music] Bri rest for all this now things have not worked out like God people oh there you go for we're still here fighting the greatest battle ever fought we must have the F of Abraham KN God would never face and if we will trust in him we'll find that all is way all is [Applause] way all is well we have heard the message and all is there is a place a perfect rest behind the so rest little bright rest for all his way Hallelujah just a announcement we're going to just dismiss in prayer and bless the food you're all welcome to stay uh there's plenty plenty of food then afterwards probably around 1:30 that's give or take uh 20 minutes either way we're going to come back in anybody that wants to take part of uh communion and foot washing we'll have foot washing and communion and but you're welcome to stay and leave or whatever you're welcome to be a part of foot washingon communion you're welcome not to be to completely an individual Choice amen we just uh thank you for coming God bless you and we hope you got Lord Jesus we just thank you for this great opportunity Lord Jesus we pray that you'll bless and take care of your bride here Lord Jesus representative wherever we would separate our paths and wherever we would go May Our Testimony be strong and may we may we consider these thoughts that we we heard this morning from your word Lord Jesus and help us not to to R and stew and like the prophet said debate debates of the devil he said the Holy Ghost don't debate the word it shares the word Lord Jesus help us to not be Debaters Lord Jesus help us not to be salesmen for your word but help us to be lights and salty that that people will see our life and be salty and thirsty and want to be exactly like us Lord Jesus we pray Lord we pray for the food that will partake of Lord Jesus the physical food and then after as we come in and remember your supper Lord Jesus and communion Lord Jesus we just pray for the service then too but bless the food to our bodies and our fellowship in your name we pray amen God bless you this morning
