how God before the foundates of the world through predestination and election put something in his bride that would oh Blessed Be Your Name we love you Lord Jesus bless the beautiful bride of Christ that's come this morning and the ones that are out be with Kathy and Steve this morning Lord you know what's changed for the sister Steve was planning on being here this morning and just we asked you not most of all you'd meet their spiritual needs Lord Jesus reveal yourself unto them so plain Lord we do pray that you and meet their financial needs Lord Jesus and even any others in our you know as the world is changing and the economy is changing and things will become difficult God take care of your bride we pray we bless your name Lord Jesus and may we say when we leave that our hearts burned when we felt the pull of almighty God we love you with all of our hearts amen amen God bless you this morning it's just awesome to be here we sure welcome you all just uh welcome him most of all thank you for the song service thank you musicians let's turn to Matthew 24 and and uh I want to preach on Election this morning and I believe is just uh just a fantastic uh privilege to be elected and there's a way and you know I want to even before we read our scripture I say you know only the elected are in a battle only the elected are in a battle so those that were born you know what Jesus said to the ones he said you are of your fathers the devil they're not in a battle because they're already where they're going there's there's not no battle but because we were bypassed our theophany and we're a Triune being we have this Badger skin and it's fighting against our theophany and as soon as we lay down our Badger skin you know when I was a kid we used to hunt skins and when they dried out when they really dry out they're easy to store we just get this dried out all right see often he'll come oh praise God Amen Matthew 24 let's just start at uh verse 37 or maybe read to 39 now you know well we read our scriptures we'll start Matthew 24. but as in the days of Noah were so shall it be in the Sun the coming of the son of man be whereas many in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that Noah entered the Ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall it be in the also in the coming of the son of man be Lord Jesus we ask you to bless your word this morning to us and bless your bride and may you come and minister to us all this morning we pray in your beautiful name amen you may have your seats this morning let's just turn over to Genesis 6 6. Genesis 6 6 and you know most people when they read this scripture we think of the evil side of the age we think of you know when when we think of as in the days of Noah we think well it was wicked and so it's wicked today but we don't want to preach on that amen you know in everything the Bible says when Satan comes in like a flood God will raise up a standard against him and you know Satan has a program and Satan's doing things in the world by Jehovah God is also doing something God has a plan and you know when Satan's family is doing things and there's manifestations in Satan's kingdom there's greater manifestations and the family of God so when we think about Noah today as in the days of Noah we're not going to think about the wickedness of the world because we want to look at another side and here I want to show you that we'll read this scripture we're going to go to eight Amy and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and he grieved him at his heart wow and the Lord said I will destroy the man whom I have created on the face of the Earth both man and Beast and every creeping thing in the fowls of the air and it repented God that I have even made them now that's getting Wicked one more verse but Noah thound Grace and the eyes of the Lord hallelujah you know I want to lay this Foundation down just before we get into it more into the topic of election here we see that this is after the Garden of Eden and see in the Garden of Eden the Lions children the Lions laid down with the lamb and they there was no turmoil among the the animals okay until sin came in and upset the economy that God had planned now we're going back to that Garden but it'll be in the millennium and it'll be beautiful you can have a pat line for your kitty and it'll never eat you but here in Noah's day this is clearly after the sin and the guarded because we see here that God himself repented that he had even made man so I'm showing this here's here in Noah's day the lamb was not laying down with the Lions and the bunny rabbit when it ran out from the hay it was afraid of Disguise the eagle you know we're combining our harvesting now and the rabbits don't want to run out from the thing because you can see the Hawks just come down and just pick them up because it takes your cover and that this is how it was and Noah's day and sin yes had come up to a great part that God repented by God then had something to fight against Satan's economy and God has something today to fight against Satan's economy and it's called it's beautiful let me read you a quote that our Prophet said and it is beautiful just find it here he said this is talking about election now this watch how this is just was just Supernatural he said but in Christ you come by-election huh now watch this but he won't force you no that's a gentleman but the prophet don't stop there but he'll pull your heart to him no he won't force you but I feel the pull that's God Almighty before the foundation of the world he just he'll let you make your own choices serve and say but he'll have something on your heart and he'll be pulling you in pulling you in and you say well how in the world could that be well you know we we mentioned already about the animals now we know that right now on the day we're living in the whole earth growneth for the manifestations of the sons of man the whole earth is waiting for you to put on your theophany let's you know we read a scripture we'll maybe turn to Romans 9 Romans 9 16 so it says so then it is not him that willeth and not him that runeth but it's God it's God that pulls on your heartstrings it's God that shows Mercy amen you never woke up this morning he said well I believe I'll come to church this morning even though you did but it was God that it planted that and was pulling you yesterday your whole week you couldn't wait to get back in Fellowship with the body and the Supernatural Part here is this God does that even in animals and nature you look at this and the day of Noah when the animals were the prey of the Lions and the eagle and all these things just think of this case and Noah had preached for 120 years and the the community around them had deemed him Beyond mentally saying amen it never rained before there was no scientific evidence of it ever amen but hear the animals you know our Prophet let me let me jump ahead and talk about this the prophet he he went to India the one time and they were going to have a storm in India they have a lot of rock Cliffs and and stone fences and the birds make a lot of their their nests in the fences and the cliffs and the animals will take the shade in the afternoon Sun by The Cliffs and he said it was literally on the radio they said we don't understand why the animals have left the rocks but God understood because God had placed the election an instinct in those animals and before mankind could even know that the Earth was going to have a quake God's creation by elections new the something was going on you know look at today our scientists in the world and politics in the world they don't they can't understand why the world's upside down but if you just look at God's word it'll tell you why it's upside down it was because of the garden and the sin and everything's groaning for it to go back to the millennium amen which it's going to very soon I believe with all my heart but can you imagine the Uproar when Noah's getting ready and God by election calls the animals to come into the ark can you imagine the Buddy rabbit going in ahead of a coyote can you imagine a squirrel going in behind of a wolf can you imagine an eagle flying over and the field mice going in the ark now I want to tell you something brothers and sisters how in the world could the people that Noah had preached to for a hundred and twenty years and they see a lion not chasing the lamb go in single file into an ark whoa do you know our Prophet said and the Bible clearly says that if they would have seen the truth at that time they could have still went in how could they not have seen it you know the Bible says they have eyes but they cannot see they have ears and I'm telling you it's coming and their ears they cannot hear what greater sign would you want to see in Noah's day when you've seen that the animals lay down their Natural Instincts of eating one another and walk in single five amazing amazing that's election that was God pulling their hearts that's what our Prophet said he said he said it like this he said can you imagine that can the D or the cantaloupe or something eating grass and the first strike of lightning looking over saying honey it's time to get in it's time to get in and I want to tell you this morning like a deer or a cantaloupe honey it's time to get in because as in the days of Noah so shall it be in the Sun the coming of the son of man and we have arrived because we are in the season of the son of man coming you know our Prophet said the Rapture is in process right now it's it's going on right now you're waiting the the animals are going in the ark the Rapture is going to Glory and you can't see it you can't see it the world can't see it amazing amazing you think of the world can't you think of how many deer were in the field but only two went in you think how many lions were chasing but only two only two this way only two that's amazing that's why you know in every age it was such a small amount in many ages in Noah's day eight Souls were saved many ages just a small portion of the Bride elected predestinated now it'll be from every part of the earth I'm going to show you a video when we close just bless my heart I can't really watch it without literally affected me the bride around the world it's just powerful you you I know you believe it but you can't comprehend it the Bible says you can comprehend it and here our Prophet said that here these animals come in and all the world seeing these animals this Supernatural thing these animals going in I would have been asking some questions I would have been saying Noah we need to talk but because they were not in the election they had eyes but they couldn't see and you know this morning when you feel the tug and pull of God on your heart you should just lose your mind praising God you should just because the one sitting raped me said there was two in the bad and one was taken and the other was left there was two in the field and one was taken and the other was that oh if that ain't Amazing Grace amazing Mercy that God almighty saw me and you worthy not we weren't worthy in ourselves but because of him Paul praise God to think of the supernatural thing that happened even in the animal life and I got another part to talk to you about this you know kids you will know you say well how do I know if I'm elected you know the Bible and our Prophet clearly talked that you're under the umbrella of your parents and your parents have the baptism of the Holy Ghost if they're elected and so you're protected until you come to the age of accountability but you can tell when you get to the edge of the umbrella when you start doing things that elected people don't do see when you get to the edge of the umbrella the rain will fall on you if the umbrella won't do you no good and when you come out from underneath the umbrella of your parents protection it won't do you no good I want to show you another example not only did the world see the animals that would have ate each other normally walking in the ark these are wild beasts these aren't modified educated refined human beings you understand you know like an animal until you know even our kittens in the barn until we get them pet trained uh-huh they'll claw and bite you so that's called refined man but these animals that were not refined in any way through election could Tabernacle inside of an ark and not fight or eat each other for months and months you know bride don't eat bride you won't have an appetite for bride if you're a bride of Christ you won't have a teeth you know the children of Israel when they left Egypt some had a taste for the leeks and garlic more than the manna from almighty God God in heaven made man a Heavenly food can you imagine your digestive system how we took that I'll tell you what it would have been the healthiest food in the world and some said you know I'll I have a taste for and some are saying I have a taste for the world summer I have a taste for bride eating bride hear the animal Beast could Tabernacle in the Ark of Safety because that Ark meant that they were going to cross over and that they were actually it was a type of the tribulation the flood you know and Enoch taped us the bride but in in Noah's day that that was God's provided place of worship for Noah to cross over the tribulation the rough period and today kids Almighty the Lord Jesus Christ is your door to cross over the flood that's soon coming it'll be only the Lord Jesus Christ that'll put you in the Ark of Safety you know the one place the prophet said that actually the bride is the ark and Christ is the door because he said we are all baptized into one baptism the baptism of the Holy Ghost and everybody in that Ark we're in unison there was no dissension in that art oh it's blue it's beautiful think of how powerful election is powerful elections how in the world couldn't the denominations and the worldly people see it you know our Prophet said it he said to hear multiple places and and I know I'm I'm preaching to people that know this and believe this election he said you you didn't become a Christian nah here he said he said it's election he said we he said uh I wanted to get election strong because it's the truth he said now you didn't become a Christian just by convenience it don't matter how good the Evangelist preached which it could have been fantastic you didn't come to the Altar and just received Christ's end because the Bible says that no man come to the father except he pulled them draw them amen Hallelujah he likes it he won't take you against your will but he'll pull on that heart and he'll change your Earthly will you say look at our prophet he said I want to be a dropper period he said I don't want to be around people I want to be in the wilderness by God through election said I have a plan for your life and he pulled out his heart and even though in the mind he wanted to go that way his heart pulled them that way because of election oh it's beautiful Hallelujah the Bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord it's beautiful that even the wildlife in the animals like when Jesus was on the boat the disciples even the disciples that are following he said even the waves and the wind obey him that's powerful that's powerful you think no no this listen this happened when there was great sin so much sin that God repented that he even made man not lying still had a taste for bunny rabbit it didn't take it away because we're not in the millennium wow now if you can see that in the Bible and you can see people around the fringes of what we believe and they have a taste for bunny rabbit then they're not in the ark they're not you getting me see you couldn't be in the Arts and have a taste for somebody else that was in the ark no oh you weren't in the art you were still the one that was still in the field but the other one was taken oh my this is so amazing thank you Lord he said you because you were a Christian before you came into the world you young boys you got to realize through election you were a Christian before you were born oh it's beautiful before the foundation of the world before I was born before your parents were born God through Mercy Grace and yes we were born in sin and we all went the wrong way but God had a string and he pulled you in man you weren't here by coincidence you are born in a message family by coincidence your families are teaching you the truth by coincidence it's predestination of almighty God he couldn't lose you because you were a part of him you might have been the tiniest part but he ain't complete without you oh it's beautiful you say well bless God I decide you to then decide nothing God decided Hallelujah and you know what even how our prophets that ye might decide contrary and God will literally change your thought pattern uh-huh most ministers will tell you that most ministers say oh but God some it takes more sleepless nights than others some it maybe takes more Visions or dreams than others but God knows how to convert and change those that are his Hallelujah he said because you you were a Christian before you committed the world before you were born God ordained you a Christian from the Garden of Eden from before the from before the Garden of Eden from before the foundation of the world it's beautiful it's beautiful even the animals and Noah's day were elected oh that's I that just blessed my heart when I seen that and you see how they come into the ark you know the prophet said that in the ark everything in the Bible shows a trinity but in proper placing amen said the ark had a trinity they had three floors he said the baked beasts and the Chrome beasts were on the bottom floor the birds and the fowls were in the middle floor and he said Noah and his family were in the top floor Amen in different offices like your dad is still yet like your dad's a son and a father and he'll soon be a grandfather but it's exactly the same Jared man exactly the being oh it's beautiful not like the world teaches that in three people sitting on a throne that always agree on the oh that's ridiculous nobody ever always agrees on the same thing amen can you imagine three people sitting on the throne in heaven and they had to throw a quarter to decide which one was going to come and die that's that's you know the prophet said that even the the the the the truth is easier to believe that I lie and the world's accepted a lie Matt you say where the Prophet say the prophet said I can believe the Virgin birth of Jesus and marry easier than natural birth he said that's easier for me to believe that how God can bring two people together when God can just speak it oh it's beautiful oh it's beautiful he likes Sun no no no merit of Our Own you didn't choose to serve God you didn't choose to decide to serve God but it was God who chose Mercy for you oh I thank you Lord Jesus Hallelujah he said therefore Jeff you just dropped down there in verse 18 He said therefore hath he had mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he will heartedness amen you know you can understand election by by your fruits you shall know them God help us and here here right now in our day the last Christ maybe you know we don't of course we don't know the exact day but we're definitely in the season and the last Christ going out to the world to say get in the ark get in the ark and at the same time the Bible prophesies a great Falling Away oh how can it be prophesied that's how it can be how could the people see the animals just come out randomly from the field and start lighting up supernaturally just dovetail you know and just however they went in the ark and the birds flying over top and the people stood there and looked at them I don't think I'll go today exactly the prophets the exact same thing is happening right before your eyes and my eyes today if you talk to somebody outside which we all rub shoulders with different people that other ones will never meet and you could talk about the signs of the time and the well maybe we'll get a new government well we've had thousands of new governments see it's prophesied prophesy it's election it's God's plan and God knew it from the beginning and he's not surprised Hallelujah let's just read the story in Genesis 7. maybe we can and just I mean I know we've already mentioned it but Genesis 7 9 and then I'm going to drop to 13. and he said there went into and two unto Noah into the ark and male a female as God had commanded Noah now God just didn't I mean yes he commanded Noah but God was the one no I didn't go out with the last two and bring those animals in he had he had he had as much to do with that as you have to do with getting saved this morning nothing it was election and 13 and in the same self day enter Noah and chairman ham and his sons into the ark and his their wives and 14 and every Beast after his kind in the count after the kind and every creepy thing after the kind unto the Earth after it's kind and every fowl and every bird after his kind fifteen and they went into the no end to the ark two and two of All Flesh wherein as his breath of life and they went in all the flesh says God had commanded him and God and God shut the door here our Prophet said you know in the message he said when Noah went in he said Noah turn this this is what our Prophet said he said Noah would have turned around to those exact same people just try to try to go there with me in a picture in your mind kids you try to Picture This the animals supernaturally walking in the ark if you see a picture of the Ark it's massive you say well they oh my goodness news travels faster by mouth than it ever did by internet you say how did that be how how did the Queen of Sheba hear about the prophet By Word of Mouth by merchants by travel everybody had heard about Noah's message you know why you know why it had to be that way because God had to have all hear it for them to be able to be rejected it had to be same as in our day there's nobody getting to the judgment and say well I never heard the truth that ain't going to happen because our God's a just God amen and here they see that just picture that man you just picture all those what they seen the animals going in and then Noah turns around the door because what a prophet said no turn around the door and he said no folks this is Alaska see our God is Rich very rich very very very rich very very rich in Mercy he's not like brother Dale he'd be like Peter he said Lord how many times am I going to forgive my brother oh just a couple that's burning me up God says forever 70 times 7 meaning forever can you imagine the mercy of almighty God when he allowed Noah to turn around at the door say no this is your last call the very last time can you imagine the power and the anointing on that altar call and then he turned around and God shut the door and our Prophet said this he said he said this it never rained I believe it was for seven days now follow me with this church the people that had rejected the altar call for seven days believed they were right 24 they came the next day said yep I knew that man was cuckoo became the next Church age and they said 732 I knew that message was cuckoo they came the next church I knew that Prophet was cuckoo when they came on the seventh and they came on the seventh they did not know he was Cooper and our Prophet said this he said when it started to rain and they were Beyond safety he said this he said God never give them another way of Escape he never give them a log or a smaller boat he never give them a sailboat you never give them a speedboat he never give them a denominational Creed you give them one way one place of worship and that day was the ark in our day it's a lord Jesus Christ and that one way of Escape you're not going to get there and say well my preacher said huh and he said this he said and this will be also true for us he said so when that Ark lifted and the people had changed their mind and they were knocking on the door that's he said God Noah could not open what God headshot wow Noah could not imagine the feeling because see we're at we have the character of Christ so you look at somebody and you feel what Christ felt he would that all would be saved but he knew that couldn't be he knew there wouldn't be and I God have mercy on them but think of how blessed you are so election if you feel the Pope if you have a battle in your mind we've all had them and we don't I I don't I haven't talked to one person that had a battle that liked it but when your battle starts you should just start praising God and like losing Paul did it Paul did it in jail in the stocks I don't think he felt like it I just strongly I just have a strong feeling that impulsive less after he had been whipped and unjustly arrested because see he was one of them from their country he had been put in jail without a trial I have a feeling that his flesh didn't desire but he reached real deep past the flesh to his theophany to to his predestination to his election and it changed everything oh my my when we're going through our trials we could just see how much God loves you and he could never lose you oh it's it's it's amazing it's amazing Mercy election to be elected wow I know there'll be ones that are elected and there still may be going the wrong way but you can watch their life and it'll be bumpy God's putting up a roadblock and they'll bump it you know but God God won't lose those that are his it won't happen hallelujah it's so amazing just another quote here he said and provided away he said but God's provided away today of Escape we already said that was Jesus Christ and the spirit of God is moving in US and it it'll be moving in the bride because watch let me ask you a question the prophet said the Rapture is in process just let that sink in you're already in person wow how could it not just I told my wife I said the age we're living in I said it's so we can see everything coming and it's just so hard to function here I can't plan more than three days out you know a farmer I'm thinking years ahead years I know for a fact I don't believe in my heart that I'll be here years though how would you you know the Bible says election to put your kingdom where thieves don't come in and steal rust don't come in amen and you're you know you're saying well I'm provided for my family it was like the prophet he looked out and said I can't see past and I look out and I said well I can't see past I want to make something but I can't see past there our Prophet says here he said that's the spirit of God moving you to be in the ark and that's our art is a rapture that's how we're bypassing the tripods oh praise God amen God's not leaving his bride here to be tortured oh it's beautiful here he talks about the animals come together wow he said I believe every man or woman that's ordained of God I'll hear the voice and they'll hear the tug on their heart and they'll shoved to get into the ark as fast as they can go get into safety God's provided way of Escape for us is bright and that's it he said it's God's warning to his people prepare for me God you know you know the prophet said different you know really amazing things that I just love he said you know God's done everything he can do he said if you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have everything you need for the rapture if you've been born again you have everything for the rapture man you don't need to see you've already sold out to God you're already spiritually pregnant you don't need to see a mountain move to say oh no that's my God you already know it's your God hey man but here in

the tug on their heart hasn't made them completely turn all the way around Mercy is always and always has been where God is it's where truth is it's where the message of the day is that's where the word of God is God's electus are all Mercy we're God's electives there's Mercy where God's word is there's Mercy where God's a message of the hour for the day is is Mercy it's truth it's a mercy to the people where God's truth is his Mercy and there's still Mercy on the scene when there's still truth in the bride elect and the message is still here for the turning of the pulling of the hearts
