I believe that's God's perfect will so we're going to turn to Matthew 18 maybe you can stand with me for scripture I covet your prayers I just feel tired in the flesh but uh when we are weak he is strong and we uh praise God for that God's desire for us is to catch the full revelation of who he is amen whole H the whole Revelation amen and you know uh early in the week Revelations 181 [Music] uh I had absolutely zero intention of preaching part two of this message and uh I would have said I was finished completely finished with it and so me and God were having a a fight and uh Pastor Bley sent me a video and that tipped the balance amen let's read our scripture here and Matthew 18:1 and at the same time came the disciples unto Jesus saying who is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven Lord Jesus we pray that you'll ask add your blessing to this word and Lord God you know you know before the foundation of the world what was on the screen and Lord we're just in obedience to your leadership this morning Lord God lord we in the flesh would have went a different way but Lord we surrender to what you have for your people may you bless them and help them in a special way Lord I pray that you'll be with the speaker this morning and I pray that you'll be with the hearer and help them to to know that this is not just a man's idea but it's from the Throne of God and we give you the glory for Lord Jesus for your name sake amen man you may have your seats and brother Matt is just amazing to see you and awesome and God bless you and the family amen hallelujah you know we read uh just to to to lay uh you know we preached on uh blessed are those that are not offended in me and uh and you know I want I want to maybe uh just uh lay a a quick foundation and then continue on with a thought of God here but here here in the a perfect uh in the power of transformation this is right before the prophet died he said see perfect Fellowship he said oh it's a deep mystery this was the last quote I read last Sunday he said it's a deep mystery of God and he said how wonderful that God could have fellowship with us it was it was a mystery that God planned on Heaven fellowship with us and you know you know uh we we know that the word is the greatest part but when you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are the word and so then what becomes the greatest part is not the word no I'm not leaving the word it's Fellowship but see cuz in John 1:1 it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and God was every bit of the word but he still desired his greatest desire wasn't the word wasn't himself God's greatest desire was not himself he would have never left heaven and died on a tree for me his greatest desire was Fellowship his great like you got to get that your greatest desire of Jehovah is fellowship because he was all of the word and he wanted fellowship and we in this message of the hour we have the revealed Mysteries revealed and the the Mysteries and we we understand the the the Bible and it's a new book but we run from fellowship our society runs from fellowship we are Facebook screen uh junkies and we text junkies and and you know what's up junkies we never talk to anybody we don't see the reaction we're afraid of people's reactions we're afraid of people we will text people things that we would never say in their presence they' punch Us in the nose amen and this is you know God has never changed and I I just want to just lay this Foundation here here here you know um wow there's just a lot to this you know why why are Christians so offended because other people are different do you know brother Bram said you may have a different Revelation a different Doctrine a different Customs but God was a god of variety still the word I'm not talking about leaving the word a god of right do you know brother Brown said 30 five times that God was a god of vary he said that God was go you know you just to to lighten it up here something you know and my wife have differences I know that'll shock you but as soon as a tree dies in our front yard she wants to get the chainsaw and cut it down and I said man I wouldn't want to be an old person in your presence I mean she's going to get just throw you oh man it's going to be the farthest old age home you can ever see I said you know God like short trees and he likes baked monstrous oak trees he likes fat chubby evergreen trees and this will shock you but he actually likes dead trees too hello did you ever go to the Wilderness or or canara park or anywhere else and see no dad trees you know certain animals live in those dead trees they make their homes in those dead trees those dead trees have a purpose but we don't like that trees but see we don't like variety because we got this warped opinion and it's warped warped opinion of some Hollywood Guru that's straight from hell of this perfectional movie star life with no dead trees that's not who God is amen I believe God is a god of righty and he proves that in his word and he likes big mountains and he likes little mountains and he's got Plains and he's got deserts and he's got different things because he's made different and he wanted it to be that way amen he wanted it to be that way and he made season Summers and Winters and springs and Autumns and he made seasons and it showed that he's God of variety and he made you and a variety and some men real boisterous in a big mouth and fat like me and then there's other real dignified and Tiny and petite and others are fine and others are of different kinds and you just find that all the different kinds of people this he preached literally 10 days before he died all the different kinds of people are in God's kingdom well I don't like how they are cuz God help us God help us you know he said God never was you know he he talked about it his uh steer and robox Harmony House that he used to be able to buy in Sears and he said God never made us like identical PEDs in the Pod but you struggle with that and you might as well just say Amen cuz God told me you did and brother Dale struggles with it too cuz anytime somebody's outside of the mold of who we think is acceptable to God Amen we struggle with it let me just look for my new scripture [Music] here forgive me well here we go man we read a scripture last week I'll scroll back to the top of the message and John 1 1 and3 and and we we know the first two verses very well but in John 1:3 it says maybe we need to pull this up Amy so we can see it all things were made by him God and without God was not anything made that was made amen sorry got to find back where I was again we struggle with that and this is what Pastor Bartley sent me and after I tell you this video and this research I'm going to ask the kids come up and help me preach we struggle with uniqueness we we struggle with the variety in the Christian family and that's why we are destroying each other just say Amen cuz this church ain't over full that's why your kids left the faith because they can find more fellowship with the world the devil than they can in the house of God now that is insane and it's got to change insane now the only thing you got to recognize is when you leave and you go to the devil's house the devil is to kill devour eat and Destroy and he's also the father of all the lies so what seems to be pury will not be pry all your life but it is still a deception in the bride of Christ and the sooner we wake up and recognize it the sooner we're going to get out of here and I'm getting sick of living in this place amen and so we got to recognize that different a me we're like watch this in our church we're not trying to copy except God do you know you want to look at uh we're going to touch on Church order and doctrines and you know Jesus preached Church order and Doctrine in the Bible I'm going to get into some of that but here's a survey and it's done and and I have it on my phone I'm not going to it's it's a it's a legitimate survey and Pastor Bartley from Jamaica sent it to me and after he sent it to me I was just like whoa and he said uh-huh whoa this is the survey he said a lot of Christians are leaving their faith and especially the young people now you might as well just say Amen to that because it's the facts churches are empty and out you know you can buy churches for a dime a dozen make a house out of them and the Pew Research Center showed that in the last 10 years do you know just I'm just going to stop here cuz I felt something come back just in case you don't believe in this survey the Bible says this because it says unless he shorten the days there would be none of you here cuz we would all be offended with each other amen now now now we want to stop here for a second and say now listen you know I had a pastor in another country say you know you can't help that other people are offended with you now let me explain that there's people offended this morning that I'm preaching there's people offended this morning that this churches here and there's people offended that you have long hair and that you wear a dress now that you can't help but what you can help is are you offended are you yourself offended with God and I'll guarantee you in the past you have been the Bible says unless he shorten the days that there would be nobody saved and because of that reason he would shorten the days hello amen thank you watch this he said 28% in the last 10 years 28% 10 years that's not very long since ilot was born since since Silas was born 28% of Christians have stopped being Christians that's crazy Hey listen listen we're going to talk about Grace and greasy Grace don't over preach the predestination predestination ain't so you can sin predestination ain't there so you can be mean to me and just think you're going to get away with it predestination and election ain't so you can just say mean things to your brothers and sisters and don't think God's going to be upset cuz he said it would be better that a millstone were hung around your neck and you were drowned in the deeps of the sea and had never been born that's what God thinks of election 28% of less Christianity left the church and become atheists or Anonymous which is nothing and watch this he said CH they are the ones that have left they are not impressed anymore by the drama drama and The Message Church Hallelujah the drama and the facts that Jesus was crucified and died 2,000 years ago now now listen I just want to just lay let the say no we're not preaching about people can backside and you condoning it no I'm not saying that but the Bible has a verse for that it says let them work out their own salvation with fear and trembling the prophet said you know when his son was backl he said you made the bad you go ahead and lie on the was going oh come and pray for me I'm sick I think I'm going to die daddy and you know what do you know what brother Bram said he said you can go ahead and do your own praying cuz you did the sin in so when if you leave this word of God and you leave this umbrella of protection under the the message of the hour or under the home and you get in a rotten situation don't come come here crying on my shoulders we're going to pray for the Believers not for the ones that left well that's what the prophet did you're looking at me funny that's right that's what the prophet did with his own kids that's right so you need to consider your sin but if somebody wants to sin you fighting with them ain't going to fix nothing just leave it alone just don't go down that road but I thought I would but I doing God a service without doing it God's will it's God that draws people to him not you it's God no man comes to the father unless the father draws them amen God help us and there search has found that in in they're searching in the people that has left they're searching for something that's more meaningful than this message of the hour now that is the saddest news that any person could hear how in the world that that's Insanity that you have you have peace love joy longsuffering and all these things kindness Perfection a perfect home home perfect family perfect God and you're going to leave that for something more meaningful that's not happening but see remember that they're they're tired of the drama they're tired of I know they're not going to like that I wore this color shirt this morning or the tie or my trousers don't match my shirt but I'm more worried about matching God's shirt amen does that sound familiar here amen and the con and science they're they're looking for something that's consistent with science and consistent with the principles that we know today and Islam is the answer for them and Islam is jumping on the opportunity don't look at me shocked as all these churches come empty in Toronto and Kitchener guess who buys them all before they even put the real estate sign up Islam Islam by them and they're spending they're instead of spending larger money to build new buildings they can buy the ones that the Christians paid for that they almost give away because nobody wants the drama because nobody can please anybody so they just stop going amen and they're turning these churches into mosque and into schools for the Muslims and he said watch he said you know many years ago when the Revival the Revival Age come out and the wesling and all those people come out and the great Revival age he said they were affecting the Muslim following and there was a great burst of many many churches built and the you know when brother Brown was here at the end of his life the 50s 60s 7s and and they were a Revival and he said they converted all of our people but he said now we're getting them all back the Muslims he said because we served he said we need to buy these churches that the Christians are closing because they're turning to Islam and we'll serve the same Community full of people in the same building worshiping a false god wow and someday oslam Muslim will have all these people and they will teach the Christian the exchristian children in the Muslim schools and today we're bringing the favor back to their the communities to worship the Muslims and we're bringing the light of Islam which is completely false and a complete lie and people are turning to that because Christians are not Christians message believers are not message Believers according to what God Said watch this here and and and and this is I know this is very hard for me too he says God has no amputation in the body he said before the foundation of the world looked down through the stream of time and saw that everything would be and therefore he could call the elect those who he knew that would would uh would be put into this building to this building that's right and if you've been called tonight by the Holy Ghost and given a chance into the kingdom of God you ought to be so happy amen and if you're in the kingdom of God you're a part of the body of Christ and thanks to God you live your life for God and you do the things that's right and remember now watch this this might sink in a little bit rough when it goes down here and it might let it let it die just for a bit but if you're in the body of Christ he doesn't have any amputations his body is perfect and it don't need any amputations that's the truth he said you know the other night I was preaching up the ladder and he said they don't take off an arm or a leg and he said when you're placed there he said it's placed there and it's the right material for sure watch this in in Colossians 3 3 4 and 2 just still laying a foundation set your affection on things above and not on things of the Earth for ye are dead and your life is hidden Christ and God and when Christ who is our life shall appear we shall we shall also appear with him in glory you know God never came to attack his family now we preached last Sunday and I hate reruns but you know when God was spoke the Elohim out from him he left being the self-existent one and he became a family man and and the Bible says that he was he he made something off of himself the little ones came off of himself amen and and so here we see that that God made all this variety off of ourselves but we we are going around as Believers cutting down the old trees and cutting down the little trees you know the neighbor was tell on us a few weeks back you know the town they last year they put the new Street in and the town gave and come and give them some little trees and they were hugely offended because the trees were so small they wouldn't even plant them in their front yard they planted them in the side yard out of the view because see we got this mentality that everything's got to be perfect from day one day one we're not planting a tree in our front yard unless it's between 6 to 10t tall period or it don't get the front yard cuz it's not special enough and that's how we run the Church of God if you're not 6 to 10 feet tall you're not special enough so you can't be in the and multiple multiple times I wish I could read all the things that God said on the variety if you want to look that up the God of variety you will be stunned at what he said you know he said he has look at the variety of nationalities and people and voices and and and singing and just you name it size and character and customs and all these things he here the prophet said this and and I'm going to in a minute I I I want the kids to come up and help me for a second because I want to go into Jesus preaching his church order and Doctrine for a minute he said the church has failed yep they failed but watch what they failed in instead of bringing people together in the body they've separated them right they've separated them if somebody walks in here and they're a sinter thoughts don't have no effect on me it's not like a reflection if anything it's a good reflection on us it it's not a negative reflection on us because somebody comes in that don't look like us the church is a hospital for crying out loud the only place they can get fixes in the Church of the house of God under the preaching of the word and it's not up to me how fast they get fixed it's not up to me to give them mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and say you know don't it's up to God called the anointing of the Holy Spirit but we don't trust God so we become to help God and we become doing God a service when it ain't even God's will because you know like the song writes nobody knows how God can can woo a sinner's heart to himself that's God's job amen and now you're a bornn again Christian and you will forget watch this you'll forget your differences and come together as a Christian ought to can we do something our King will come for us when we do amen but you know if you're a daddy in a family you you'll have people come to you or if you're a pastor in a church or that they'll say well Nobody Does it like that I say well praise the Lord we're the first well nobody but I don't feel well praise the Lord get comfortable cuz God's a god of vary uhhuh he said then will come the day when all will stand together as seen in Daniel in the Book of Daniel the king will be there with his bride and in front of them will be the multitudes of the world who will judge what I wanted to see was we' all be standing together can you imagine when God runs the white Throne judgment and the bride of Christ is there with us and we're judg in the world now just think about this this in just a little bit of a humorous way can you imagine the different varieties of opinions wow I wouldn't want to be the person like that keeps order wow well it'll take a an eternity to get through the first Soul cuz you'll have five trillion people have a different opinion and everyone will want to be heard the last message brother Brown preached would that be a good example communion he said it's a reubel that you're that I'm a part of him and I'm a part of you no no no no no no I'm not a part of you I'm just a part of God but I'm not a part of you guys that's not what he said that was the last message it's a revelation that I'm a part of God and I'm a part of you and I love you and I love God and we're T taking this together that means we're together as a symbol of our love to God and our love and oh here's this good word I wish we could pull up all these quotes quick and our fellowship separate no no sorry our fellowship to one another to one another you know if you don't like your brother and sisters Fellowship regardless of how unique and the variety they are you're going to hate God you're going you're going to flat out hate God like we we need to recognize this before we get there cuz you know it'd be terrible if you got to heaven and you were disappointed in Hebrews 10:24 and 25 you can pull this up Amy let us consider one another and to provoke unto love and good works consider consider your brother and sister consider the variety of the brother and sister and Hebrews 10: 2425 yes amen and watch this and 25 and not forsaking oh I know this one we have memorized of your not forsaking the assembly which is fellowship shipping of ourselves together now the Bible knows this is going to happen it's amazing how God had this Revelation as in the matter that some have already done it I would say most but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching you know what it's not our job to conver convert you to my Doctrine it's not my job to convert you to my Revelation it's not my job to convert to save you brother Braham said I'm not the Savior I'm not your healer I'm pointing to you one it is and how you see the picture you know that you I know this is simple but like the dad That Sent His Four Sons to go see a tree and four different seasons and they all would have fought what the tree looked like because they went there in four different season seasons one season it was dead one season it was all white with blooms one season it was green and one season it was completely red with apples that's how immature we look to God blessed are those that are not offended in me because you are him and when you're offended with your brother and sister just because their tree's apple is red and yours is white with blooms and they were just pling it a few weeks later you're actually offended with God not your brother and sisters and that's why the young people are fleeing this place because of the drama drama is making me vomit and it's made our kids vomit the they've run for their life to survive and God will judge us for this God help us when we were yet sinners and unlovely and unlovable no man came to the father but he still put out his love to you amen how in the world you know I've seen I've seen message people have backyard parties at their house and they told me directly I'm not inviting anybody from the church you look shocked I didn't just hear that from one person I've heard that most of my message life I don't want to get in your backyard party and have a competition on quotes it's not about a competition on quotes it's not about a competition on your Revelation I just wanted you know people asking questions and answerers why do you go hunting why don't you just stay under the anointing and the the Revelation and the V he said I would blow up he said One Vision is hard harder on me than preaching for months blow up blow up and yet every time the message people get together oh did you read this I read this today and And yet when our Prophet went hunting I got this first hand from from uh his oldest son he got he came right under the anointing where where literally arms were grown up like unbelievable anointing in the service unbelievable and he got in the car and he was going to western Canada and the first thing he said in the car to the driver she got to any good jokes he came from The Presence of Jehovah now I know I've lost about 99% of you so far but I'm going to regain some of you right now do you know when the prophet went hunting how many people did he have friends in his church connections tens of thousands right everybody agree you can put your hands up that one tens of thousands word wi and he went hunting and he preached the message brother Bernard of the meanest man ever born he took a no good backsliding atheist butcher disgusting vomit redneck Pig and all those beautiful preachers bless God he won fellowship with all them even brother Braham said when I have a backyard party I'm not going to invite anybody from the church just let that sink in just think of how many people would have give right arm right arm to go with Brother brandham on that hunting trip Believers Believers and he took one man one man that was the meanest man he ever knew because brother brandham didn't want any religious drama you know Church we're missing God we're missing God uh-huh watch this you know I need some of the kids come up here and help me I want to I want to preach some church doctrine and and and and uh uh Amy I need John 13 up you know you if if any of the kids come up and if you if you're scared to come up bring your dad it's all right just you stand sit I don't care what you're doing you're not it's all right brother it's all right God loves you too it's all right right here just go to your just go to your brother no no we don't want just a langsa family that'd be disgusting come on both asleep oh well they're they're in Paradise all right brother yeah you can you can I'll call you Isaiah is that right brother Isaiah you've really groaned wow you're tremendously now now watch out this scripture I want yeah come on up it's all right and it's where where's Leah oh she's oh she well brother M it's all right you've really watch this and all things were made by who by God and without him was an anything absolutely anything brother Isaiah God bless you brother you've really grown brother yeah I was nothing made brother nothing made absolutely nothing made but wait a minute now now this is is different but I'm offended now you know I'm offended because I'm not brother Isaiah brother Bernard you know but I'm not Curtis I'm definitely not Sil and Silas is as different as night and day from Curtis they're they they're they were adopted I maybe and little an or sister Alice now watch this now they're they're they're very unique and variety and special an is completely different than Alice and an's hair is beautiful and long but Alice is just younger so her hair is shorter different and and all those beautiful were made by God and he seen that it was was good to have a variety really good now watch this now okay you can sit down thank you thank you and you maybe need to take him now watch this now in church order Jesus preached Church order but before we get to that let's read a quote he said God don't destroy his children he said he's trying his best to get them in in but it's the devil that's turned them loose that will destroy the children so God permits Satan to do his work that's in questions and answers God don't destroy what he created God don't destroy that no this is a quote this is paragraph 184 in questions and answers God don't destroy his question he's just trying to do his best to get them in okay so watch this so let me go back to our first scripture we're going to go to Matthew Amy and I read Matthew 18 1-7 and at the same time the disciples came to Jesus saying who is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven verse two and Jesus called onto the little children Jesus did what we just did I don't think there was as many sleeping and set them in his midst oh bless God I've never seen a church do that before well praise the Lord we're getting converted s him in his midst and said verily verily I say unto you except ye be converted oh now we're getting somewhere we're getting converted praise the Lord and become as a little children ye shall not even enter into the kingdom of heaven and whosoever therefore shall humble himself to the variety of God as as a little children which is the variety of God did we say we have variety up here it's little children the same is the greatest now we've been missing that for a long time remember we said a great Revelation how God love Fellowship is the greatest kingdom of God and whosoever would receiveth such as a little child in my name receiveth God oh bless God we don't have time for the kids oh shut up stay home get out of my way you know you don't you don't have a quotebook yet you don't that's disgusting justing receiveth me and verse 6 and whosoever shall be offended because I asked one of the little kids to come up front and help me preach with these little ones which I believe in me it would be better for him that a millstone would be hung around his neck and that he would be drowned in the depths of the sea for w into a world because of well they're different me bless God you know I wasn't raised in yand and you know I don't understand them I don't understand woe unto a world because of offenses I'm going to say like this would it be okay if I say like this w on to the message churches because of offenses you know every most message churches have had dozens of young people walk out of this place and it was because people with big mouths meddling in places that they didn't need to meddle matter of fact was sinful for them to medle there thank you Hallelujah you know you know we're not the church don't have to be perfect you know what I mean like God ain't less of God because 10 Bond Believers come in this place the Bible's still the Bible the message is still the truth and and Hallelujah you know you know the prophet in the prophet's meetings he had a sister sit there I think it was 23 or 26 years or 16 or it was years cutting her hair on a regular basis going to the putter salon now can you imagine anybody listen to The Prophet's message the mount that he preached against hair how in the world could it somebody like I mean all the others were offended and laughed and just all of a sudden after like 16 or 20 years sitting in the prophet's church it was just like oh I'm not almost got my hair wow I wish I would have heard that somebody's like you got to be kidding me do you know it takes sometimes long some of your kids it'll take longer for them to like squash some of my kids like it so I still pray for them amen or like some of our kids they hated peas and you know Sister Ruth I would put two peas on their plate and they would tidy around those pees and and build them up like soldiers and then they get all done and say Dad I'm all done but I'm looking I'm looking at these two little PES and I'm thinking oh my goodness oh my and verse 10 in this verse wo well even verse 9 but woe unto that man by whom the fences cometh woe unto the so-called Believers that we just butcher everybody we see they're not like us they're not like we think we think we think we should they're not even like you think to think God is cuz God ain't like that the prophet wasn't even like that take heed verse 10 take heed that you despise not one not one of these little ones for I say unto you that in heaven now that's a good place I'm going to tell you that their theophany is totally beholden the face of Jehovah God give to account said God can can you imagine their theop God those message Believers down there they're really mean to us they don't let us they don't let us sing they won't let us sing specials they could care less if we had anything special for us they don't promote anything regarding around the kids we never sing kids songs we don't care about the kids I was singing a song when I was plown this week stop let me tell you what the Lord Has Done For Me anybody heard that song they us sing it 10,000 times it was a testimony song stop let me tell you what the Lord's done for me for he saved my soul cleanse my heart and he made me whole so stop let me tell you what the lord we don't do that cuz you know kids are they don't matter they don't understand they don't they don't have no Revelation they're not converted you know they're not important they didn't come from God you know they don't come from God until they're about 18 and then they're immediately from God you know th this was Jesus I I want to rephrase this this is this was Jesus church order and Doctrine for children Amen in Philippians 2:12 wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling now that's verse 12 now if if you would allow me I'm just going to jump two verses but it's kind of like in the same context would we agree on that from 12 to 14 there's just like one verse in between there do all things we need this one up there we do all things without trying to help god without fixing all the problems that we think God don't know about man we don't believe God's you like omnipotent because like we know more than God knows God have you seen the mail did you get that text god without mummering or disputing that's not our business absolutely totally not our business wow your own salvation and then let the person just take care of it you know not everybody that's in heaven is going to be in the bride there'll be people that are just nice to the bride that's going to be a really small group cuz I mean the bride can't even be nice to each other so I mean the people that are nice to the bride that's just like that's like really Supernatural we might even have to change bedrooms or something Matthew 7 1:5 Matthew 7 1:5 it's really important and now now I want to show you something I'm reading a lot of quotes and a lot of Bible are we okay with the Bible okay judge not that you be not judged for in what judgment you judge the little iety of the children or the old dad trees in the front yard and the chainsaw and remember all these things people that we throw in the home and people that don't have a good voice and people that are terrible preachers like myself and and all these things this that you for with judgment you judge ye shall be judged and with what Merit measure you Merit it shall be measured unto you again I wonder if you've ever done seen something just disgusting done to the kids you think if that person realized that what they just did to a little child of God is going to come right back and feed them right in their face you know you know from from the youngest memories as I could be I hated people being picked on I can remember in grade two when Brent mckinin moved into the school and everybody wanted to beat him up and I'd stand reide I I'd take a whole class on you're going to lick both of us at the same time I never seen the kid before to me was just disgusting oh I don't know him I don't know how long he served God I don't know his personal Doctrine you know you know this is fresh I mean this is this is really fresh you know one time we had a lady from from uh Sam Sam Johnson's Church in Michigan was that am I saying that right Sam John Church she wanted to give some money to a pastor in the Philippines and and and I had preached for him I had preached for him and she had asked another bait name Pastor in the Philippines which I had also preached for him too and and I know these people if you want me to show but it's not important and she was going to send the money to the one preacher and asked him will you send it over to this one and he said no he said CU I don't know if he's really a Believer now I don't know if he teaches the same doctrine that I promote in my little cabin hello hello help me out hello and she called me out and she said brother Dale do you know Pastor S I said yep she told me the story and she said will you send the money to I said it's not my money of course I will see what right do you have if somebody comes up and gives you money and say will you give this to brother Bernard and said no no I want to give it to Sister Ruth it's not your money I mean now they're one so it wouldn't matter probably brother Bernard hands it sister but you what I'm you know what I'm saying but like like why not just what's wrong with just doing what the you don't have to ask any question well why are you sending it to him bless God it wasn't your money maybe the person prayed through about it I don't care it it's not my skin it's not my skin it's not my salvation but we have an opinion oh I've had oh man alive I had to get converted too when I was young oh please uhhuh Matthew 7 we're still here verse three and why beholdest thou the mol in thy brother's eye but considerest not the beam that's in thine own eye or why wilt thou say to thy brother let let me pull the Mt out of thine eye and behold the beam that's in thine own eye thou hypocrite First cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then Thou shalt See Clearly to cast out the mold in thy brother's eye now you know unbeliev is unbeknownst to most of us that are here in the flesh we haven't actually went in the Rapture yet like you know I mean even around the world like we actually haven't got a new body yet like the body change like our theophany body I mean it's hanging around us but it can't connect yet because we aren't converted yet well well that's what the Bible said it said when we get converted strengthen the Brethren oh my in Genesis 1:26 28 I just want to paraphrase this quickly one Genesis 1:26 and God said let us make man and our emages after our likess that means God has fat people and he has little people and he has squirmy people and he has male and female and so God created man man in His image and in the image of God now this will surprise some of you created he male and female now that's amazing why did God do that now there's no human alive can understand the female species but God actually created them but I don't understand that why would God make that big mistake well no but do you see what I'm that's I'm trying to get you to right but we preach we listen my own wife has said I felt like a dorat in message churches before now God don't have any doormats he don't have any people that's amputated and I can tell you what when my wife comes to me in private and says I was treated like a doormat when that person was preaching over the pulpit he's not [Applause] converted I don't care how many years he's preached this message amen now this is still Bible now let's go he created them male and female created he them he created them them now now this will really shock you in verse 28 now I only took part of these verses when I print them down and God actually blessed them wow I thought God just blessed the men he actually blessed them both well that wow and God said unto them and we just stopped there amen amen God help us in John 1:3 and all things were made by him and without him wasn't anything made God didn't make any mistakes but we live our life like he did we do and we feel like the way we live our Christian Life Is God we know you overlooked and had an oversight on this part so now we're going to help you with our baked mouth and if you as a human have that much love think of what your heavenly father would do for his children you know the Bible says that if you be in evil and how to give good gifts to your children and you were born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies how much more does God who made all things and by him was nothing else made his children amen questions and answers oh I've already read that story Matthew 19 we got it we'll speed up a little bit forgive me Matthew 1913-15 and he actually tell me what I want to go to Mark 4 Mark 10 sorry let's go to Mark 10 I like this one better I get to pick but we'll go back to Matthew but I like this one better now you would think that maybe we backslid or we never did something Mark Mark 10:13 and 16 now we need this up here so we can see it and the people brought the young children to Jesus at that he should t them their hands he touched the children now that's weird he actually touched the children and his deacons Glory Hallelujah they were message thought and his deacons rebuke God or the people that brought him and his disciples rebuke those that brought the children now let's just see how God wrote his church order and Doctrine would that be okay 14 but when Jesus saw it he was much this please and he said unto his deacons suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such now you know when the children were coming to Jesus now listen let's just make a little drama here they weren't Angels it didn't say they were like cryless noisess sit they could sit for three hours they were children they [Laughter] were and the disciples said they're being a big disturbance let's get these kids out of this way for the Holy Spirit to move messing up my concentration and Jesus said to them when he was much displeased suffer little children come unto me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of God and verily I say unto you that whosoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a little child into his church with all the distractions that a little child cannot do to me when I'm preaching he shall not enter into heaven and he took the children up during church now we're in the church service praise God wow I've never seen that done before and he took them up in his arms and he put his arms upon them and he said don't come to church no more and he blessed them that's Jesus church order and Doctrine let's go to Matthew 19:13 I'm going to speed up and Matthew 19:13 and when they were brought into him the little children that they should put their hands that he should put their hands on them and pray the disciples rebuke them now those were good deacons for any message church around the world they would get an amonous votes but Jesus said suffer the little children and forbid them not to come unto me for such is the kingdom of heaven and he laid his hands on them and departed hence you know I I tell you something brother Dale was young and stupid at one time and I'm still old and stupid but you know when I traveled you know God's a god of variety I'll never forget the first time I went overseas and if I would have had a message Doctrine of most make Believers I would have never went back overseas again cuz there ain't one thing that Africa does that's the same as us I've seen them when they I don't know what this song was it was another language brother Bernard I just seen the pews just empty out to the middle and it was wall to wall and they come up here and like they were just like and the walls started moving you know the first thing came to my mind we don't do that in Wyoming I never seen that done in Canada before well they don't have the same God as me because we don't do it that way we don't serve God that I'm offended I'm well they're being disorderly how can the song leader pay attention when there's people oh it's like the person that came to brother Brown said if they if she wasn't shouting amen hallelujah I couldn't even preach and the other person was completely distracted now that same action created two different reactions one person couldn't focus because there was kids in the church and the other person said he couldn't even preach unless the kids were there and that person was Jesus I think I like his example you know the one time we were in a service and The Neighbor Next Door there was just a bamboo and was no walls at all no walls at all at all and you can hear every car go by and then the neighbor had a hurt of cows and he'd run them by and the goats and that they would get out and they'd come over they oh and like the preacher up here and I'm like and the preacher go brother D I'm over here cuz I'm distracted I wonder who needed to get converted the cows or me I remember the one time we were in a different place and there was lizards in the church and the cat came to church it fell asleep and there was a lizard going up the pole and my daughter was really concerned about the lizard and she was moving around and the young people were jumping because she was distracted by the L cuz see they weren't distracted see they were in the mode they were like a like the minite hsees going down the road on 401 and they had blinders they didn't see no kids they didn't see no cows they didn't see no lizards they didn't see nothing but Christ mhm yeah now would it be okay if I continue continue and show you God's Church order and Doctrine this may surprise you so just Matthew 21 12-6 now I I don't think I can go very far wrong if we're reading the scriptures Matthew 21 and Jesus went into the temple of God and cast them out that were children oh I I knew I was in Reading they that sold and bought in the temple and he overthrew their tabers and the money Chambers and the seats and them that sold doves and he said unto them it is written my house should be called The House of Prayer but ye have made it a den of Thieves and the Blind and the lame came unto him in the temple now these are the people that are really a distraction like we don't want no blind people walking in here cuz they might walk into somebody like you just don't know that would would really distract me if I seen somebody walking like procurious and the BL and the lame people see if if there was and I'm not making fun if there was somebody walking like this you know when you go to high school and somebody like has no arm or something hand and like everybody in the whole school goes it's cuz they're not converted yet but Jesus was converted and so the Blind and the lame they came onto him after he got rid of the edos in church mostly the men the ones that were concerned about how much they were paying for the mixer or something I don't know and he healed them and when the chief priest and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did now watch this now this is you got this up here next verse the wonderful things he did and the children were crying in the temple now any good Deacon would come up and tap the mother on the shoulder and say get that kid out of here cuz all the people are distracted you know we can't even concentrate because a baby would cry and the children were crying is that what it says okay Ju Just I wasn't sure in the temple saying hosana to the son of David and they were sore displeased that's the message Believers cuz see it didn't go Jesus wasn't the god that they were worshiping he wasn't the god of variety they didn't want that variety so they just said we want won't accept that they were sort dis pleased and they said unto him hear us thou these that are crying and Jesus said unto them yay have ye never read that out of the mouth of babes and sucklings has he perfected praise I wish I was invited to ministers meeting I would roast their height how is God going to perfect out of the mouth of babes and sucklings perfect praise if they're not allowed in the church to cry amen H Joshua 24:15 and it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods of your father the past gods of the way we've always done it this way we've always kept the message Church really dignified and perfect are on the other side of the flood the gods of the amorites in whose land ye now dwell but as for this is a prophet saying but as for me and my house we're going to take what God says we're going to take his Doctrine here and and I'm I'm I'm trying to wind down here he's brother Brown's talking about a minister and us as people this is where we've missed it in the church he said you are just to throw out the net with the Brethren and now you know each one of us now he included you are fishermen and you know God and now the Lord told a fisherman one time he said as he followed him he said come and be Fishers of Men and we stand at the corner here by the church in the neighborhood and we gather and we throw out the net and it's not up to us what the net catches but we don't do that we gather all that we can bring in and the Sinners no matter watch this and he said we're bringing in every sinner no matter what position he's in and we're trying to bring him to Christ and there comes a time when we reach out away and we put out all our Nets together all the message people together so we can go way out and get a big rack of of whatever would be caught in the net and that's what we are here tonight is just to knit our fellowship oh there you go again I don't like that word I don't want nobody to come to my house not if we got to argue over quotes we knit all our Nets together in Fellowship of love not around quotes around my brethren and their Nets and see many Souls we can get to Christ and we know that and he used the word that I had to go to Google for it s e i n iing and even my wife that's brilliant didn't know what it was and it's a special kind of net that floats on top of the ground and it goes down like 20 feet in the net and it's like a round and fishes can come in a door of the net or come up from the bottom come in it and when they get inside it's like an upside down cone and it's this word however you say it and he said it's a large netting around the entire area of fish and he said so you know we're setting our Nets around all the community people trying to catch get everything coming in but there's something that's going to be but there's only going to be some of them that are going to be fish that we catch in the net but that's not our business amen another quote here and looking to Jesus he said I wouldn't argue with no one here's the man that wanted to to toh debate with Brother brandom on Divine Healing he said I wouldn't argue with nobody he Saidi don't believe in it he said I wouldn't Mar now oh man remember we said about the Bible said converted our Prophet says Mar okay watch this this is for all message people around the world all they're watching online listen to this he said I wouldn't Mar my experience and my feeling for the Lord Jesus Christ and that love to argue with one another now the Bible says you need to get converted and the prophet said I wouldn't Mar it I could care less if they agree it makes no difference to me and I'll preach the gospel and if you'll believe it all right and if you don't that's up between you and God now how can we believe what the prophet said it's between them and God but we don't believe that that's why we divide and we don't expect accept varieties and that's why we got to do it exactly like all the other people do it and if we break the mold it's going to be like terrible says who you know I love sister Ruth was doing the Caya throughout our place and and we talked and oh it was amazing what she said I was just she had to be converted she said we're not here to please everybody there will be people that won't like church in the country there will be people that don't like T and and praise the Lord for them but don't come to our house cuz this one Sunday once in a year on three weeks from this Sunday we're going to break the mold we're going to be a little bit more like Jesus when he preached on the hill on the grass site around the campfire oh wow you've really backslid now really I never knew Jesus Built Church buildings in pews see and even when we have the food sister Ruth and Lan were talking about the food and we said what we're going to have and it's going to be five or six different options and we said well of course I'm always the person out I believe it was me I said well what if somebody don't like that and sister Ruth very converted spoke up she said we can't please everybody with the food food amazingly enough if you have five options for you go to a restaurant we won't be we'll eat what's left over after camp but we want everybody just in that little amen here the prophet saying I'm not responsible for nothing but preaching the word and it's him that pulls them in just I'm finishing here just two quotes God help us amen and all these people I love them with all my heart and I don't know which one of them which is I can't tell you but I just hear to preach the word and I cast the net and Pull It in and if there's frogs in the net there's water spiders and there's snakes there's some fish too and that's up to God to decide that why can't we just accept that I just pull the net in I just preach the word and Pull It in and say well here they come Lord All Around The Altar and you know who's yours and you've known them since a foundation of the world and I don't know which one's who but you do so it's up to you Lord and that's the best I can do and I'll go somewhere else and throw the net out to another group and that's all I can do but we've got a spirit of the devil that if they ain't like us and they don't do everything exactly like us and if I'm disturbed or distracted or something they can't be God God help us God's a variety and now this is my last quote and now that uh what caused a disgrace in the church upon the church is because the people get around their oh oh this is so good fleshly ideas my God is white fat and a man and get to running away with things and that causes those different groups and things and well I belong to this one and they don't belong they don't get along with that group so I won't either that's our profit that's in works that I do and bear witness of me and I don't have the paragraph right in front of me but I can sure get it for you that's our message right in a nutshell do you know I had a a minister in a far away country you don't know and by the way we pray that you'll pray for us we're we're looking for plane tickets to go to El Salvador the last couple days of November and the 1 of December and we'd like to take everyone here with us and in a close area it don't take money it just takes your your willingness to have a god of variety that's all it takes do you know we went to four churches when we were there and honey would you say that all four were vastly different and vastly beautiful some had completely different music than others do you know they were actually preaching the same word of God that we're preaching surprisingly enough do you know actually we walk through little towns that were probably as small as brigon and there was Believers from three different churches lived in the same town and we stopped in every one of their houses and we didn't actually fight and I didn't actually have to get my phone and pull up quotes and bicker and argue Chase all the young people out no it never happened you know people from other churches actually made a smoothies other people actually fed us meals from a I know that like that's actually amazing but we have this stupid idea that came from Satan that if we don't fit in our mold we have respects the persons based on their size and their ability the quality do you know most of Jesus disciples were non-educated other than Paul most of them couldn't write their own name the very person that Jesus gave the keys to he couldn't write his name I I think you call that pretty much illiterate do you know that your Prophet I want to say that again that your Prophet oh bless God that your Prophet when he started preaching was such a poor reader that he had his wife come behind the desk the holy D can you believe it a woman do you know I had to block and onri people cuz we had sisters come behind the holy desk and sing specials and I had no problem slapping them off my connectionless when a woman started telling me how I was going to run the church on the other side of the world that is the most disgusting vial from hell you ever to see you know a woman a sister can do everything that handle the word her brother and she could even handle the word over her family family and the Bible says for the old sisters to teach the younger sisters and you're failing in that area sisters cuz I got three daughters and they need a lot of I'm just I that's a joke but amen you I'm seriously you sisters that have wisdom tell my girls for crying out loud they won't listen to me I'm a man I'm that's is that Bible that the older sisters would tell the younger sisters you know I was young once and you know I I I I be careful uh-huh you have all the permission you need from the word of God to fulfill your role you see what I mean brother brandham had his wife come behind the pulpit and read the Bible because he could not read now let me ask you let's do a survey here have you went to one single Church in your life where you seen that happen put your hand up if you have that's un amous and let me let's just just continue on this I I believe we're on something good so and if you had seen it happen do you think it would have emptied out the whole church put your hand up a woman came to the front oh your Prophet did that let me okay let me let me ask my last question was he wrong see how you don't like change and variety that hurts you it hurts you you don't like it and now the cause of disgrace upon the church is cuz people just get their fleshly ideas you know when brother Dale went to the Philippines Africa and El Salvador and even before we went to monzerat I knew exactly how God was supposed to be God had told me how he should be right in Ontario Canada brother Bernard it was exactly how we are right now h H are you kidding careful Church you're so familiar with the god you think is God that you don't realize that there's actually Believers that do things different than you do and they're going to be in heaven too and they actually preach the same message we believe and they actually surprisingly enough have the baptis of the Holy Ghost fleshly ideas and you get you get to run away with these things that's the fleshly ideas and you cause these different groups and things and while I belong to this one and they don't get along with this group so neither will I neither why well let me just tell you something you don't have to ask me to go anywhere that might shock you I hope it don't but you are your own self you have the same holy ghost that I have Hello you were elected and predestinated I was I in a hierarch some dictatorship like Hitler and the church or the pope let me close with this I had a minister this week in another country tell me that since we have been many many moons ago that not one single local church would come by his church cuz he's different that's exactly how most of us live when's the last time you came to a house that you don't feel comfortable with if you get out of your comfort zone you feel awkward well I'm not comfortable around those people maybe you need to get converted maybe amen I love going to places where nobody else will go I I think God literally give me that Ministry that where all the I don't want to be where all the politics are I it makes me vomit it gives me a I want to tell you something it makes God vomit too and I believe we're going to close with it we matter of fact we can stand the musicians can come the God we serve is a lot different than the god that sometimes in our mind in our mind and we've portrayed by accident sometimes because he's a god of variety and I I would challenge you to look up that a god of variety brother Brown quoted it 35 times and he used multiple things like garden flowers nationalities colors people cultures towns Trees Animals everything culture a god of variety God love variety and God love fellowship and because something was different I let you know this because something died God don't have any chainsaws
