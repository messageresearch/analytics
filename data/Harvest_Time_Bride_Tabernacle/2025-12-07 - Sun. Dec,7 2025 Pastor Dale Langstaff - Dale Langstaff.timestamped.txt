[25:53] Amen. We recognize it's winter time.
[25:56] Every time we go by Matt and Abigail's
[25:59] or we go to visit them, I am amazed at
[26:02] how far they drive
[26:04] to come and fellowship with us.
[26:07] I think it's a good hour and 20 minutes
[26:10] on a good day on a Sunday. [snorts]
[26:14] one way.
[26:17] Amen.
[26:20] Amen. Well, I got good news for you. If
[26:24] God will let me, I'm going to stop my
[26:26] I'm going to stop my uh series after
[26:30] today.
[26:32] Amen. Next Sunday, if God willing, I'm
[26:34] going to preach on Judas Escariat.
[26:39] Next Sunday.
[26:41] Amen. Let's read a scripture while
[26:44] you're standing. 1 Corinthians, I
[26:46] mentioned this last week. We're going to
[26:49] preach on what Paul preached. 1
[26:51] Corinthians 4
[26:54] and we want to read verse six.
[26:58] I think we'll just
[27:03] read verse six and seven. Amen. You
[27:06] know, our prophet told us this that if
[27:08] you thought too highly of yourself and
[27:12] you wanted to recognize yourself. Now,
[27:14] you know, this is a paradox because we
[27:17] came from God. So, we're a part of God.
[27:19] So, we are gods with a small G. So, God
[27:22] greatly loves you. You're a part of him.
[27:24] But you and your flesh, if you want to
[27:26] think too highly of yourself, Brother
[27:29] Brham said, stick your hand in a pale of
[27:31] water and pull it out. Find where your
[27:33] hand is.
[27:36] Amen.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; You'll never find it.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the scripture
[27:43] says those exact words.
[27:46] And these things, brethren, I have
[27:49] in
[27:51] figure transfigure
[27:53] to myself [snorts] and to Apollus for
[27:57] your sakes,
[27:59] that ye might learn in us not to think
[28:01] of a man above that which is written,
[28:06] that no one of you be puffed up,
[28:10] for one against another.
[28:14] For who maketh thee to differ from the
[28:16] other another? And what hast thou that
[28:20] thou dost not receive? Now if this if
[28:24] thou dost disreceive this, why dust thou
[28:28] glory? As if thou hadest not
[28:33] received it.
[28:35] Let us not think of a man above that
[28:39] which is written, that no one of you be
[28:42] puffed up one against another.
[28:46] For who maketh thee to differ from
[28:49] another?
[28:52] What hast thou that thou dost not
[28:54] receive? For if thou hast received it,
[28:59] why does thy glory
[29:01] as if thou hast not received it? Lord
[29:05] Jesus, I pray that you'll take this
[29:08] text, Lord God. You know what you've
[29:10] laid on my heart and what you've shared
[29:14] with me, Lord God, and what we've
[29:15] studied and and Lord, I pray that you
[29:17] convey this to your family, Lord God.
[29:19] And Lord, more than as much as any, we
[29:23] thank you for your presence, Lord God.
[29:26] And Lord, our only desire is to adore
[29:28] you, to worship you, to give you all the
[29:32] glory, and to serve you, Lord God, with
[29:34] our complete heart. And we praise you,
[29:37] Lord God, for yours is only one God,
[29:41] Jehovah Gyra. And we love you, Lord God,
[29:44] this morning in your name. Bless the
[29:46] hearer, Lord God, and help them
[29:49] to catch your spirit, your revelation,
[29:52] Lord God, we pray. Amen. Amen. You may
[29:55] have your seats this morning.
[29:57] [clears throat] Amen. [snorts]
[30:02] I want to continue this same title we
[30:04] were preaching on. The seed of God
[30:07] always brings the nature of God. And and
[30:10] if we were going to go down a little
[30:11] different road this morning, you know,
[30:13] Brother Bram said about a hundred times
[30:16] in the message that your attitude
[30:20] controls everything.
[30:23] Your attitude controls everything. If if
[30:25] you came in anything, your attitude in
[30:28] your relationship, in your job, in
[30:31] serving God, your attitude, you know,
[30:33] and if and we might go into this more in
[30:35] the new year, but brother talked about
[30:37] the angel, the Holy Spirit coming by,
[30:39] and if your attitude was wrong, it would
[30:42] just it would just fly away. God God was
[30:45] a dumb nature. And if you're woing and
[30:48] barking and and howling and all this, he
[30:51] will not sit around your territory. And
[30:53] even he can explain this. You know, you
[30:56] know the angels that are hovered about
[30:57] us, you know, the footsteps of the
[30:59] righteous are are ordered of the Lord,
[31:01] but they're encamped with angels of God.
[31:03] And those angels have left the presence
[31:05] of Jehovah in heaven. And they will only
[31:08] be pres they will only be comfortable in
[31:11] that same presence. You know, you wonder
[31:14] why God and and Brother Ben mentioned
[31:16] this in in El Salvador last night. You
[31:18] wonder why God isn't in our church as if
[31:20] we don't have the same presence that's
[31:22] in heaven. You wonder if God's not in
[31:25] our home is if there ain't the same
[31:27] atmosphere in our home that there wasn't
[31:29] in heaven. And so when the angels come
[31:31] to a different atmosphere, they don't
[31:32] know how to control it because they're a
[31:35] dove dove
[31:37] and they can only feast on Holy Spirit.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; They're a dove anointing. You know,
[31:42] brother Bram said this so many times,
[31:44] your attitude will change this, you
[31:46] know, and and different things. You
[31:48] know, Brother Bram, you know, as as he
[31:50] had a gift of visions and and you know,
[31:52] the in the healing the prayer lines, you
[31:55] know, there would be people that God
[31:56] would want to speak to. And when the
[31:58] power of God was there in a special
[32:00] supernatural way, he'd say, you've heard
[32:03] this thousands and thousands of times in
[32:06] the message, be reverent. Be reverent.
[32:08] Bow your head. Be reverent. Be reverent.
[32:10] Be respectful. But your attitude, your
[32:12] attitude. Be respectful. If you're if
[32:15] you're barking, those those demons will
[32:18] go on you
[32:20] &gt;&gt; instead of leave the place.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, you know, brother Ben, I
[32:25] we'd listened to a message there. He
[32:27] preached in El Salvador and he was
[32:29] pointing out and so I I'm just taking
[32:31] this part of his. He said, you know,
[32:34] there was in brother Bram's meetings,
[32:35] you would know you he would see how the
[32:37] angel would go over people and he could
[32:40] see the pillar of fire over them. And he
[32:42] said there was a brother and there there
[32:44] you've heard this and the thing he said,
[32:45] "Be careful, sister. Be careful,
[32:47] brother. You're going to miss it." And
[32:49] you'd miss it for all of eternity. And
[32:51] there was a brother that the angel had
[32:53] went over and he said that the the the
[32:56] devil Lucifer got him to go out to the
[32:59] bathroom and the spirit the the angel
[33:01] left him and went to another person. He
[33:03] said that man died with the disease he
[33:05] took to the bathroom
[33:08] because he didn't have the reverence and
[33:11] the attitude
[33:12] of the presence of Jehovah. God created
[33:16] the angels
[33:19] &gt;&gt; to worship him in the presence. Now
[33:21] watch this. And those angels leave that
[33:24] presence and they expect the same
[33:27] presence that was just here.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; That's the only presence they're
[33:31] comfortable in
[33:34] &gt;&gt; is worship to Jehovah
[33:36] &gt;&gt; and him alone.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; And that's the same with our homes.
[33:41] Amen. And you know, it's actually I
[33:44] really got this message I wanted to
[33:46] preach next Sunday. You know, it it it's
[33:50] just uh I actually had a couple things.
[33:53] It's really peculiar how God sends a
[33:55] message. But you know, Brother Brandham
[33:57] said things about Judas a Scariot.
[34:02] Brother Brham did. And many of us have
[34:06] made decisions like Judas the Scariot.
[34:07] God bless you, brother Fred. Very, very
[34:09] welcome. Amen.
[34:13] Amen. God help us. Amen. But that's we
[34:15] want to go on with this. Let's watch
[34:17] this here. What our prophet said just a
[34:18] couple in the fifth seal. He said,
[34:20] "Don't you never he" He said, "I don't
[34:22] want to never think because I'm a wash
[34:24] woman or a little plow boy that I can't
[34:27] receive a revelation from God." See, God
[34:32] has children. Amen. And and we never
[34:35] want to put oursel above what God has
[34:38] planned. And then we'll go to the next
[34:40] quote here and I want to get right into
[34:42] our text. He said, and this was he
[34:44] mentioned 97 times he said, "Your
[34:46] approach, your attitude is what it
[34:49] takes." If you're healed today or not
[34:52] healed today, it's all on your attitude
[34:55] &gt;&gt; and your approach. [snorts]
[34:57] And that's what it is tonight, dear
[34:59] friend. It takes the attitude. And we
[35:02] are and we believe that we are in the
[35:04] presence of Jesus Christ. But he said
[35:07] it's your attitude that brings the
[35:10] results.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; God never changed. The presence of Jesus
[35:14] Christ never changed.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; It is your attitude to his presence. You
[35:19] know the prophet said this many times.
[35:20] He said most of the time that people met
[35:23] miss the presence of God is because they
[35:26] didn't recognize
[35:29] &gt;&gt; him. That's right.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; You didn't recognize him. So, we had in
[35:33] our text and last week we'd finished out
[35:36] reading a bunch of quotes about uh
[35:38] arrogancy and being arrogant and and the
[35:40] opposite to arrogant and humility. And I
[35:43] want to show you just fastly and quickly
[35:45] and we're we're going to go into it, but
[35:46] I want to show you three examples of the
[35:48] difference of being delivered or not
[35:51] being delivered over humility or
[35:53] arrogancy. And the first one is in Luke
[35:56] 23. And uh I got different verses here,
[35:59] but I want to show you here that here's
[36:00] the time that Jesus is being crucified.
[36:04] And there was a couple cross or a couple
[36:06] thieves that were being uh charged also
[36:08] with them, one on each side of him.
[36:12] And we see in in the the chapter here
[36:15] that Jesus is is being illegitimately
[36:19] killed by crucifixion. And he prays
[36:22] here. He says, "Father, forgive them
[36:26] for they know not what they did."
[36:28] Amazing and unbelievable
[36:31] humility
[36:33] &gt;&gt; in the in the presence of injustice. But
[36:37] we see in verse 39, and maybe you can
[36:39] pull that up. Excuse [clears throat] me,
[36:41] Vicki. And they call them the the male
[36:44] factors, but these were actually
[36:45] thieves. And we see here that the one
[36:47] male factor, the one thief railed on
[36:50] Jesus and mocked Jesus.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; Don't be too critical of them cuz
[36:56] sometimes we do that also.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I want to I want to this this is
[37:03] powerful annoying. I want to I want to
[37:05] go back to Judas the scared. I want to
[37:06] tell you something. You know,
[37:09] every one of us do what he did is we
[37:13] value Jesus.
[37:17] on Jesus Judas a scar the value was 30
[37:20] pieces of silver
[37:22] &gt;&gt; what is it to you
[37:26] &gt;&gt; you have a value on
[37:29] &gt;&gt; it's very clear to see it in your life
[37:34] &gt;&gt; amen we see this one male factor he's
[37:37] railing on Jesus and he said if you're
[37:38] him and you're the Christ and you could
[37:41] save others why don't you just save us
[37:44] Now watch the difference in arrogancy to
[37:47] humility. And the other thief on the
[37:49] exact other side that was both being
[37:51] charged for robbery, he he looked at the
[37:53] other guy and he said, "Are you out of
[37:54] your mind?" He said, "Don't you fear
[37:57] God? We are getting justly the price
[38:00] that we deserve to be charged with
[38:02] because we're robbers.
[38:05] But here's a man that has done nothing
[38:08] and is paying the equal price." And
[38:10] Jesus looked at that man and he said,
[38:13] "This day you'll be with me
[38:18] in paradise."
[38:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:23] &gt;&gt; I'd like to ask you the something. What
[38:26] was the difference?
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Both men, both on a cross,
[38:33] and both robbers.
[38:37] Y
[38:39] &gt;&gt; it was their attitude.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; That's right. Y
[38:43] &gt;&gt; it was their attitude
[38:46] to God.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; For the other robber said, he said,
[38:51] "Lord,
[38:54] when you come into your kingdom,
[38:57] remember me."
[39:00] And Jesus said, "Because of your
[39:01] attitude,
[39:05] &gt;&gt; I'll never forget you.
[39:12] Wow. We see another example in the Old
[39:15] Testament is Saul and David. Both
[39:20] godly men.
[39:23] Both godly men.
[39:26] But Saul never ever repented for his
[39:29] sins.
[39:31] Paul went out to war. He had orders from
[39:33] God through the prophet to utterly
[39:35] destroy. And when he come back and he
[39:37] brought the lambs and that Saul says
[39:40] twice he said it was the people
[39:44] that did it. I'm not guilty. It was all
[39:48] your fault. It was my fault.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; You know Saul never asked Saul never did
[39:54] ask for forgiveness. But he never
[39:57] admitted that he had done wrong until
[39:59] Jesus said, "You're through."
[40:06] &gt;&gt; But the difference was arrogancy.
[40:09] But the difference with David was David
[40:13] did a far worse crime. But God don't
[40:15] rate crimes.
[40:17] But David had murdered and raped.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Far worse crime. And when the prophet
[40:25] came to David and he said, "You are that
[40:28] man." David said, "I have sinned."
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Period.
[40:34] [clears throat]
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Look at the difference
[40:37] in their approach.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; One was arrogant, said, "I never did
[40:41] nothing wrong. It was the people that
[40:43] did it and they were just hanging around
[40:45] me."
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And the other one, David said, "I
[40:52] have sinned against the Lord."
[40:54] And I want to show you our last example
[40:56] before we really get into our text here
[40:59] in Corinthians
[41:01] is there was a woman in the Bible whose
[41:04] daughter was grievously vexed with the
[41:07] devil in Matthew 15.
[41:11] and she came on to Jesus and because she
[41:14] was uh a gentile and not a uh she called
[41:19] Jesus by her wrong name.
[41:22] She was asking for Jesus to touch her
[41:24] daughter
[41:27] and Jesus gave her the greatest insult
[41:30] that he could have possibly gave a
[41:32] woman.
[41:35] He said, "It's not meat to take the
[41:37] children's bad and cast them
[41:40] to dogs."
[41:43] That would have pretty well cleaned up
[41:44] the church
[41:46] &gt;&gt; most places.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; But look at her humility. She had just
[41:52] been called
[41:57] &gt;&gt; She' just been called by who she had
[41:59] called her Lord.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:03] A dog.
[42:07] [laughter]
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; A dog.
[42:19] You know,
[42:22] &gt;&gt; she says, "Truth, Lord."
[42:25] I That's unbelievable. If there was ever
[42:27] a Christian in the Bible, it had to be
[42:28] her.
[42:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:31] But even the dogs eat the crumbs
[42:34] from the master's table.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; And look at how God
[42:40] he he literally
[42:43] changed 365
[42:45] degrees.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Over her attitude.
[42:56] Jesus said,"Woman,
[42:59] you have great faith,
[43:03] &gt;&gt; and be it unto thee as thou even thou
[43:06] wilt."
[43:08] &gt;&gt; And her daughter was healed the very
[43:10] same hour. Do you know her daughter
[43:12] would have died of that sickness?
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; If she would have took the proper steps
[43:19] of saying, "You just insulted me."
[43:24] &gt;&gt; And he did.
[43:28] So see, you know, it's it's amazing.
[43:30] Amen. So our attitude really does define
[43:34] everything you get from God.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; Everything you get from God.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to just jump into our text
[43:42] and we're we're really preaching here
[43:45] this morning in Corinthians is Paul's
[43:47] message. And and let's just go to 1
[43:49] Corinthians 1:10. And he said, "Now I
[43:51] beseech you, brethren, in the name of
[43:52] our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all
[43:55] speak the same thing."
[43:59] Well, that would be a miracle.
[44:02] And that there be no divisions among
[44:04] you, but that ye be perfectly joined
[44:08] together
[44:09] in the same mind
[44:13] and in the same judgment.
[44:17] That's what God is expecting of the
[44:20] believers
[44:22] this morning.
[44:24] And he said, "For it has been declared
[44:26] unto me, brethren,
[44:30] that there's ones in the house that are
[44:33] contentious among you." And here we can
[44:37] go into this scripture in verse 12 and
[44:39] 13. And I'm not going to read all these
[44:40] because we would be here tomorrow and
[44:43] that. But here they were saying there
[44:45] was people that were saying, "Well, I
[44:46] got saved under Paul and I got saved
[44:49] under Apollos and I got saved under this
[44:51] one and that one and this one is a great
[44:53] person to me and and I would listen to
[44:56] this one online and not that one and I
[44:58] wouldn't go to his meetings but I would
[45:00] go to this one and and Paul here he
[45:02] jumps into this and he said, "Was Christ
[45:04] divided?
[45:06] Was Paul were these people crucified for
[45:09] you
[45:11] &gt;&gt; or were they b were you baptized in
[45:13] Paul's name? And here Paul says, he
[45:15] said, "I'm glad that I never ever
[45:17] baptized you because you would think
[45:19] that it was my spirit getting on you
[45:22] that I baptized you in my name because
[45:24] it was me."
[45:28] &gt;&gt; Said, "Christ didn't send me to baptize
[45:30] you, but to preach the gospel
[45:35] &gt;&gt; and unless the cross of Christ should be
[45:38] made to none
[45:41] effect."
[45:43] You see, we we have to be so careful.
[45:45] You know, you know why the worship felt
[45:46] so powerful on that last song.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Because we were worshiping Jehovah.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We respects one another but not
[46:03] worship. Amen. God's no respective
[46:06] person. So even when we respect one, I I
[46:09] don't deserve no more respect than any
[46:12] one of you sitting here of the least of
[46:13] the children. Amen.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; He said in 23, he said, "But if we
[46:22] preach Christ crucified, it is unto the
[46:25] Jews a stumbling block and unto the
[46:27] Greeks foolishness."
[46:31] You know that same spirit's here today
[46:35] because people want to adore.
[46:38] Brother Bram said it this way. He said,
[46:39] "People are looking for a Superman to
[46:43] save the world." He said, "Russia's
[46:44] looking for a Superman
[46:46] &gt;&gt; that'll save their continent.
[46:48] We're looking for a Superman that's
[46:50] going to save our continent, but God's
[46:53] the only Superman."
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:59] So here the the the very Christ that was
[47:02] crucified was a stumbling block and
[47:06] foolishness to all the believers in the
[47:09] Bible.
[47:11] Wow, that's amazing. But unto them that
[47:15] were called,
[47:17] Christ was the power of God.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. The power of God. And here and we
[47:23] jump into chapter 2 in 1 Corinthians.
[47:25] And I want to show you how Paul's
[47:27] emphasizing one person, Christ. He said
[47:32] in 1 Corinthians 2, he said, "I am
[47:34] determined to know anything among you,
[47:36] save Jesus Christ."
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; And him crucified.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; For I was with you in weakness and in
[47:47] fear and in much trembling. Wait a
[47:50] minute.
[47:52] Paul was a scholar.
[47:55] He was a brilliant genius.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; But Paul never counted none of his
[48:03] physical abilities.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; And to serving God.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; For I was with you in weakness. He
[48:12] wasn't a weak man.
[48:14] In fear. He wasn't fearful
[48:19] &gt;&gt; and in much trembling. at look at the
[48:22] humility of Paul. No wonder God could
[48:26] say, "I've chosen him to take a message
[48:29] to the Gentiles."
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. The humility of humbling himself
[48:34] was like enormous. He said, "Watch
[48:37] this." And the after the scripture,
[48:39] watch this. In Christ, the mystery of
[48:40] God revealed, he said, "By the lack of
[48:43] revelation is why we have so many
[48:45] divisions among us and is so much
[48:48] mockery.
[48:49] God help us.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we move on to 1 Corinthians
[48:59] 3. And we see here and and you know God
[49:03] does everything for a reason. 1
[49:05] Corinthians 3 is almost an identical
[49:08] retreat of chapter one.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Almost an identical.
[49:16] For I cannot speak unto you of spiritual
[49:18] things, because you are carnal, even
[49:21] babes in Christ, because you put this
[49:24] one ahead of the other. Be ye not yet
[49:27] carnal, whereas there is among you envy
[49:29] and strife and divisions, and ye are not
[49:32] carnal, but walk as men. you know,
[49:36] and and he this ain't personally here,
[49:41] but it it is so sad to see go
[49:44] Christians. It I'm telling you, it's a
[49:47] it's it's a sin.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; It's a sin,
[49:56] but it's flesh nature to put somebody
[49:59] else down
[50:00] &gt;&gt; to raise yourself up.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; That's very powerful.
[50:07] Who did Jesus put down so he was able to
[50:10] save me?
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Nobody.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; He never even put down the soldiers
[50:20] &gt;&gt; that drove the nails.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; He never put down the soldiers that give
[50:26] them the vinegar. Yeah,
[50:30] &gt;&gt; he never put down the ones that threw
[50:33] the dice and gambled for his uniform.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; But you just let somebody come and have
[50:41] a different revelation than you.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; And they'll talk behind that person's
[50:48] back.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; They're not as far as me think.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; That's that's a terrible curse. terrible
[50:58] sin.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; It breaks God's heart.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; It's everywhere in the world.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:17] If somebody isn't and we I know we
[51:19] mentioned this you well I I'm just going
[51:20] to tell you this. This is are
[51:25] the last two years we've been at Central
[51:27] America this time of year,
[51:31] you know, and the churches are just as
[51:32] divided there as they are anywhere in
[51:34] the world.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; People that are professing, it don't
[51:46] matter what somebody else thinks. Why
[51:48] can't you just hold the door for them?
[51:51] You know, I'm going to shock you. Shock
[51:53] you really bad. You know, my brothers
[51:57] are singing in a Zinfree Methodist
[51:59] church tonight Christmas songs.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; And I'm going
[52:07] &gt;&gt; and I'm going
[52:13] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to go and I'm going to let
[52:14] my light so shine. And I'm going to put
[52:16] salt and pepper on top of me. And I hope
[52:19] some of them brush and get it in their
[52:20] nose.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to be their buddy.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to to say I'm I'm above.
[52:33] No, if I was, I'd need to stay home.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Actually, I'd need to go to the altar.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; That That's so sad.
[52:49] So sad. You know, when I went I I had
[52:58] I had a man tell me yesterday,
[53:01] he said, "The only time there's unity in
[53:03] this country is when you show up, D."
[53:12] And when I was there, there was a
[53:14] minimum of five pastors in one building.
[53:20] And the guy said, "As soon as you leave,
[53:21] they'll not have nothing to do with us.
[53:24] But when your presence is here
[53:28] now listen
[53:29] brother, I am not put that should be the
[53:33] case with every one of you.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; It has I'm not preaching a message about
[53:40] brother Dale." Amen.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; When you show up somewhere,
[53:44] &gt;&gt; you should draw people to you like flies
[53:46] on a molasses pale
[53:48] &gt;&gt; on a hot day.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; You get a lot more with honey than you
[53:53] do with vinegar.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; You should attract people like a magnet.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; I feel the pull. The people should feel
[54:03] the pull of something crazy
[54:06] supernatural.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; And they do. I got a testimony of that
[54:11] from a sister in in in our church
[54:13] yesterday. Met somebody at the grocery
[54:15] store. They were so drawn to him. They
[54:17] came to their house the same day.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; You see, it ain't a message about
[54:23] brother Dale.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; But we don't to get to heaven. You don't
[54:29] have to divide people to get there. Just
[54:31] take care of yourself and make everyone
[54:34] want to go on your cloud,
[54:37] &gt;&gt; on your wing.
[54:41] That's right.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; You could read this scripture in chapter
[54:52] 1 or chapter 3 1-10, but I'm not going
[54:56] to read it. But it was all divisions
[55:00] over flesh.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; And actually I am going to read part of
[55:08] this here. Here he said Paul he says
[55:12] he said I have planted and Apollos says
[55:14] watered but God give the increase. The
[55:17] only part of that verse you need to read
[55:18] is but God give the increase.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; But God give the increase. And so then
[55:24] neither is he that planteth anything
[55:30] &gt;&gt; he that waterth anything
[55:34] &gt;&gt; but God. Oh, I like that. Yeah.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; But God give the increase [snorts]
[55:42] according to the grace that is given on
[55:44] to you.
[55:46] Amen.
[55:48] God help us. God help us. And then we
[55:51] come down to our text. Amen. In
[55:54] Corinthians 4, 1 Corinthians 4. Now you
[55:57] see how every chapter Paul is dealing
[56:01] with what we've preached on the last
[56:03] three services.
[56:06] every single chapter
[56:09] &gt;&gt; that you might learn in us not to think
[56:11] of yourself
[56:13] above what it is written. That no one be
[56:17] puffed up
[56:18] &gt;&gt; one against the other.
[56:22] Puffed up.
[56:26] I was talking to a pastor in another
[56:28] country and he said it's customary here
[56:31] if somebody's throwing a big service
[56:33] that you know depending on you know it
[56:35] it wouldn't happen in North America
[56:37] continent but sometimes the churches are
[56:40] really full
[56:42] and sometimes there's not even parking
[56:45] and so let me give you an example this
[56:47] wasn't evil at all when when we did the
[56:48] dedication for pastor Leo in Uganda he
[56:52] had m he had zillions of pastors 70 or
[56:55] 80 pastor pastor's present. That's
[56:57] that's just unbelievable. And he
[56:59] physically told the pastors, "Don't
[57:01] bring nobody but your family or there'll
[57:04] be no place to sit."
[57:06] Now, they had three tents outside the
[57:08] church that held about 6 or 700 people.
[57:11] And you you would have had to park a
[57:13] mile away if because they don't have a
[57:14] bike parking lot cuz nobody has cars,
[57:16] very few cars. And so, see, there is
[57:19] reason. And so this brother was telling
[57:20] me in another continent, he said, "We
[57:22] wouldn't show go to a church if they
[57:25] were having a big special meetings
[57:27] unless we had a formal invitation." And
[57:29] somebody's saying, "Well, I had sent him
[57:30] an invitation and the brother sent me
[57:33] the message from the other person and
[57:36] this is what the message said. Am I
[57:37] going to be blessed to have your
[57:38] presence?"
[57:41] He said, "That's not an invitation."
[57:46] Do you see how Christians, so-called
[57:49] Christians, will go right on the line
[57:52] of lying?
[57:56] &gt;&gt; And they believe they're going in a
[57:57] rapture.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; You know, I have things among ministers
[58:05] that are so close to white life that the
[58:07] minister copies and pastes. He said,
[58:09] "You'll never believe this. So, I'll
[58:10] just send you what he sent me.
[58:14] and they all believe they're going in
[58:15] the rapture.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; Now, now God knows we're not we're not
[58:20] worried about But see, that's got to
[58:22] change for those whoever's going. That's
[58:25] not going to be that way.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Y
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's all comes down to our
[58:30] attitude. We were we were in God's plan
[58:34] and we can't change where we are in
[58:35] God's plan. And but it's miraculous his
[58:39] plan. And and you know, if you have a
[58:42] bad attitude because because you don't
[58:44] like what God did in the plan, well,
[58:46] you're actually fighting God.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Let's just drop to chapter 7 of Second
[58:59] Corinthians. And you'll notice how the
[59:02] content is still the same. And I want to
[59:04] read this in verse 17. But as God has
[59:07] distributed every man as the Lord has
[59:09] called everyone, so let him walk.
[59:16] You know what Jesus said to Peter? What
[59:18] is that to thee? Follow thou me.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; What is that to thee? Follow thou me.
[59:24] Well, they What is that to thee? Follow
[59:26] thou me.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; And so ordained I in all churches.
[59:35] Here's Paul saying how he walked. Amen.
[59:38] As God called everyone, that's how he
[59:40] walked. And is any man called being,
[59:43] watch this. Is any one of the men being
[59:45] called circumcised? Let him not become
[59:48] uncircumcised.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; If God called you to that's fine.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; It is any man uncircumcised, let him not
[59:57] be circumcised.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Watch how he says this here. He's trying
[1:00:02] to He's trying to show you how valuable
[1:00:05] your doctrines are.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; And and I believe in doctrines. You you
[1:00:10] know, Brother Bram said, "A local church
[1:00:12] ain't even a local church without
[1:00:15] doctrines."
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; So I I do believe in doctrines,
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; but doctrines don't divide.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Watch in verse 19. And he said
[1:00:26] circumcision
[1:00:28] is nothing.
[1:00:31] Uncircumcision
[1:00:33] is nothing
[1:00:36] but keeping the commandments of God.
[1:00:39] You know what the commandments of God
[1:00:41] is? You must
[1:00:44] be born again.
[1:00:46] If you don't have a new birth and you
[1:00:48] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you
[1:00:49] ain't going nowhere. Let every man abide
[1:00:53] in the same calling wherewin when he is
[1:00:57] called. And ye are bought with a price.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; Be not ye servants of men, brethren. Let
[1:01:09] every man wherein he is called there
[1:01:12] abide in God. Amen. We should be so
[1:01:15] pleased and so blessed. God knew. God
[1:01:18] made you exactly how he wanted you to
[1:01:21] serve him.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; You were you were made to worship God
[1:01:24] and to prove to Satan that there would
[1:01:26] be a bride in this last age that would
[1:01:28] never fall like the first Eve.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; And all the characteristics and and and
[1:01:37] everything you need to fulfill that plan
[1:01:40] was in God's mind when he created you.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Wow.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; I I want to I'm going to get into I got
[1:01:51] some I got we're going into Corinthians
[1:01:53] 12, but I want to show you a a quote
[1:01:57] that will jar your foundation. Now, now
[1:02:00] I I want to just show you something that
[1:02:03] our prophet was a man of God. And and so
[1:02:07] watch how he shows how a man of God, the
[1:02:10] nature of God operates. And this will
[1:02:12] jar you and you need to put this up
[1:02:14] here, Vicki. 263.
[1:02:16] Here's brother Bram talking. So, Brother
[1:02:19] Dale's not insulting Brother Bram. This
[1:02:21] is Brother Bram talking in ' 61. He
[1:02:24] said, "I am not a preacher, but if you
[1:02:27] read this, he was talking about the
[1:02:28] preachers that were on the platform when
[1:02:30] he's talking." He said, "But there's
[1:02:32] preachers and they've got a higher
[1:02:35] office than I have.
[1:02:46] I wonder how many message believers
[1:02:47] believe that.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; Let's move on. Mind now he's explaining
[1:03:05] the gift of God. And we're going to go
[1:03:07] into this in in multiple quotes. He
[1:03:10] compared the gift of God as a diamond
[1:03:12] and as a room in a building. He said,
[1:03:16] "Mine is prophetic office to prophesy."
[1:03:20] He's a prophet.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; Now, they're not that a minister. Most
[1:03:24] ministers can't prophesy. It's not a
[1:03:27] pathetic p. I can't see. I don't see
[1:03:30] visions.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; They're not built like that. They wasn't
[1:03:34] ordained for that.
[1:03:37] But what does the Bible say? Now I
[1:03:40] believe the Bible was a good absolute.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; God has said in the church, apostles,
[1:03:45] missionaries, prophets, pastors,
[1:03:47] teachers, and evangelists. Do you know
[1:03:48] that brother Bram said, and I have the
[1:03:50] quote not in my message right here, but
[1:03:52] I have it in my iPad, that brother Bram
[1:03:54] said, the highest co calling of the
[1:03:57] five-fold ministry is an apostle.
[1:04:00] The very highest.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; You know what apostle is? A missionary.
[1:04:05] one that saves souls,
[1:04:08] the highest calling.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandham said.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Watch this. And he said, "Them are gifts
[1:04:15] ordained of God and anointed." Now watch
[1:04:18] here the next paragraph.
[1:04:20] Now this is again just for
[1:04:22] clarification. This is the prophet's
[1:04:24] message here. He said, "Now I have no
[1:04:26] education and that's the reason I am not
[1:04:29] a preacher." These men,
[1:04:33] now he's talking about the preachers.
[1:04:34] She's just carrying on the next
[1:04:35] paragraph. These preachers could take
[1:04:38] the word
[1:04:40] and they wouldn't have to use one of
[1:04:43] these gifts
[1:04:45] and they could lay the word out there so
[1:04:48] they could tie Satan in such knots that
[1:04:51] he couldn't get out of it.
[1:04:54] Now, he's talking about the preachers on
[1:04:56] the platform behind him.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Okay, are you picking up something? Look
[1:05:00] at the humility of God's prophet. He's
[1:05:04] saying the men of God sitting behind me
[1:05:07] have got a gift that they can tie the
[1:05:09] Satan in knots. And watch what he says.
[1:05:15] You could tie Satan in knots and he
[1:05:17] couldn't get out of it.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; See, but let's let's look right after
[1:05:22] the C there, right near the bottom about
[1:05:26] the bottom last paragraph.
[1:05:28] But he says,
[1:05:30] "I can't do that.
[1:05:43] He said that's not my calling.
[1:05:47] They're called for that now, but they're
[1:05:50] men of God. Every man that's called of
[1:05:53] men. And he said, "If you go into this,"
[1:05:55] he said, "now then, how are you going to
[1:05:58] fail from getting well passing through
[1:06:01] that ark like this?"
[1:06:03] See how the look at the nature,
[1:06:07] the seed of God brings the nature of
[1:06:10] God. Look at the attitude
[1:06:13] of the star messenger for this age.
[1:06:17] Father
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; said preachers,
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; those preachers on the pot have a higher
[1:06:23] office than me.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Now if we look into this in first
[1:06:31] Corinthians, this backs up what the
[1:06:33] prophet says.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now 1 Corinthians 12:4, he
[1:06:37] said, "Now there is, how does it say
[1:06:39] that?
[1:06:40] diversity of gifts and the same spirit
[1:06:43] and different administrations in the
[1:06:45] same Lord. And see how that that all
[1:06:48] workketh the same God which workketh in
[1:06:51] one and for all
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; and the manifestations. But see how
[1:06:56] people won't take this scripture and
[1:06:59] they'll take one gift and they'll put it
[1:07:01] up on the clouds.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Or or or one revel. See how the
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; but this is Paul's message
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham built upon it. He
[1:07:12] said I preach what Paul preached.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; He said this is a manifestation of the
[1:07:17] spirit that is given to every man to
[1:07:20] profit with all.
[1:07:24] Now I'm going to there you know and so
[1:07:26] he goes into the spirit of wisdom,
[1:07:27] knowledge and faith and all this and
[1:07:29] discerning of tongues and kinds and all
[1:07:31] this. But let's go to verse 11. But all
[1:07:34] these workketh that one and the
[1:07:36] self-made same spirit dividing every man
[1:07:41] s separately as he will. It's God. It's
[1:07:46] God that puts the gifts in the church.
[1:07:49] It's God that puts the gifts in you and
[1:07:52] it's God in the different
[1:07:54] manifestations.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; But it's all one body. As the body is
[1:08:00] one, so it has many members and all the
[1:08:02] members are of the are members of that
[1:08:06] body being many and are one body. So
[1:08:08] also is Christ. So I want to show you
[1:08:12] something this morning. Christ
[1:08:14] [screaming]
[1:08:16] will look different.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; The anointed one will look different.
[1:08:25] Remember how the prophet gave gave
[1:08:28] credit to his wife to Jehovah because
[1:08:32] she prepared his clothes and ironed his
[1:08:35] shirts
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; and kept the crowd back from the door
[1:08:39] and answered the doorbell.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; He was saying God's placed a gift in her
[1:08:48] to protect me so I can minister.
[1:08:51] Yeah,
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; every [screaming] part of that is value.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Every part of that's value. And the
[1:08:59] prophet goes into this. [cough]
[1:09:02] He said, "For the one spirit are we all
[1:09:05] baptized into one body, whether Jews or
[1:09:07] Gentiles, whether bond or free or been
[1:09:10] made to drink of the one spirit." But we
[1:09:13] forget that.
[1:09:17] For the body is not one member
[1:09:21] but many. But most of the time in the in
[1:09:25] the ranks of Christianity, if a member
[1:09:28] is different than you, it's got to be
[1:09:31] wrong.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; But it could still be a part of the
[1:09:35] body. Yeah,
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; we see this, you know, it goes into now
[1:09:44] it's talking about foot and hand, ear
[1:09:46] and all this. And then we go to verse
[1:09:48] 19. It says, "If they were all one
[1:09:50] member, then where would the body be?
[1:09:55] But now are we many different members,
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; but yet we're Christ?" Yeah,
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; you're all individuals
[1:10:03] and you all are different than me but
[1:10:05] still Christ.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Then he goes after this in 21 he talks
[1:10:12] about if you were all the eye and the
[1:10:13] ear all this and then you know this
[1:10:16] chapter actually finishes that the the
[1:10:18] the the more comely parts
[1:10:22] get more credit
[1:10:25] but that's not how our fleshly body
[1:10:27] works.
[1:10:28] your little toe gets more credit because
[1:10:32] you know if you don't think you need
[1:10:33] your little toe just chop it off and
[1:10:35] you'll tend to fall over to your right
[1:10:37] side
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; if that's the one you cut off cuz your
[1:10:42] little toe is balance for the whole body
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; but because we're humans we tend to only
[1:10:52] value
[1:10:53] what we can see as important
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; but that's not how God is. Amen. Now, I
[1:11:00] want to read if if it's okay, I want to
[1:11:02] and we're we're doing good. I want to
[1:11:03] read some quotes that are directly
[1:11:05] connected
[1:11:07] to 1 Corinthians 12:4 on the message of
[1:11:10] he said, "Now about Christ was the
[1:11:12] fullness." And if you see a man here
[1:11:15] prophesying and another one a pastor,
[1:11:18] another one evangelist, and another one
[1:11:19] a teacher, he says, "Now, you can't say
[1:11:22] that you're not in it
[1:11:25] because it's just one of them is a raise
[1:11:28] off of God."
[1:11:31] And it all points right back to God, the
[1:11:34] big master diamond.
[1:11:40] You know, if you have a big diamond or a
[1:11:42] little diamond or if you have a blue
[1:11:45] diamond or a round diamond, it's still a
[1:11:47] diamond.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Another one here, the infallible. He
[1:11:54] said, "Now, we might differ one from
[1:11:56] another." Now, is is that kind of what I
[1:11:59] was saying? Here's a prophet backing
[1:12:01] that up. He said, "You often thought the
[1:12:04] reason that doo perhaps is because it's
[1:12:07] the body not recognizing different
[1:12:09] ministerial gifts that are in the body."
[1:12:12] You see, we do believe in the gifts of
[1:12:14] the spirit certainly and God's
[1:12:17] supernatural. And so, let's just jump to
[1:12:19] the next paragraph
[1:12:21] here. He said, "So God is just like a
[1:12:24] great big diamond."
[1:12:27] That's God. How's it chipped out and
[1:12:31] fixed up and magnified and God so
[1:12:34] arrayed in his affairs on earth until he
[1:12:37] would be able to like a big diamond, the
[1:12:39] light of the diamond would reflect these
[1:12:40] rays of light.
[1:12:43] And some of them might be blue
[1:12:46] and some might be green and some might
[1:12:49] be real,
[1:12:51] whatever that word is, dime.
[1:12:55] But sometimes as humans, we get it in
[1:12:57] our head. Well, if if you're a blue
[1:13:00] diamond and you see a red one, well,
[1:13:03] that
[1:13:06] that's
[1:13:08] that's the other
[1:13:10] that's the other.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; What? But there's not another God.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; That that's the other uh Oh, you mean
[1:13:20] the other church. But it's God's the
[1:13:23] diamond.
[1:13:25] Yeah,
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; that's the other.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; But see, God had different, you know,
[1:13:30] brother Brandham talked about God was
[1:13:31] God of variety. That's why he made
[1:13:33] flowers different
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; and each light would array a different
[1:13:39] color maybe.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Watch this. Right at the bottom,
[1:13:46] but it's all reflecting from the same
[1:13:49] great diamond.
[1:13:53] Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; Another quote and and we're coming to
[1:13:58] the end here. We're not going to be long
[1:14:00] this morning. I don't believe. But
[1:14:01] another one from the same verse in the
[1:14:03] message hub 12 and 4. And he said this
[1:14:08] he's he's comparing the the body of
[1:14:10] Christ to a room.
[1:14:12] And he said so let's just jump to the
[1:14:15] main paragraph. He said, "This room here
[1:14:17] is the body of Christ,
[1:14:20] and by one spirit are we all baptized
[1:14:23] into this room.
[1:14:26] And in the room, there's a gift of a
[1:14:29] chair to relax in. And there's a gift of
[1:14:34] light to be able to see.
[1:14:38] And there's a gift of heat, so you
[1:14:40] didn't have to wear your coat." Yeah.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; And there's a gift of a rocking chair
[1:14:46] for their mothers with babies.
[1:14:49] And there's a gift of a lounge and a
[1:14:51] gift of a rug. And they're all And
[1:14:54] there's a gift of a picture, but it's
[1:14:56] all the room
[1:14:58] is Christ.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; The room is Christ.
[1:15:13] Be careful you don't reject Christ.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Be careful if the person sitting beside
[1:15:20] you you don't like might have the spirit
[1:15:23] of Christ on them.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Bram talked about
[1:15:29] every church age that missed its its
[1:15:33] move of God was because it didn't
[1:15:35] recognize the presence of God. When
[1:15:37] Jesus came and was born on the earth,
[1:15:40] the reason they crucified him was they
[1:15:42] didn't recognize the presence of Jehovah
[1:15:47] in their midst.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; That is so the case with everything you
[1:15:57] do to serve God.
[1:16:01] If you truly recognize the presence of
[1:16:05] Jehovah
[1:16:07] in your life, in your atmosphere of your
[1:16:10] life,
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; everything you did this past week, you
[1:16:14] do different.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Me, too.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:31] I want to read about three quotes.
[1:16:32] Vicki, you're going to see some with the
[1:16:34] paragraph or the brackets around them.
[1:16:36] Them are the ones I want to read.
[1:16:40] Now, I want to show you something. We
[1:16:41] preached on this June 22nd, and I'm just
[1:16:44] going to hit on I think there's four of
[1:16:46] them, and I'm just going to hit Pacific
[1:16:48] paragraphs, but if anybody wants these
[1:16:51] are long quotes. So, this morning, I'm
[1:16:54] pulling out a paragraph. I'm not pulling
[1:16:57] out of context, but I didn't want to be
[1:16:59] another hour.
[1:17:01] And we did preach it June 22nd.
[1:17:04] He said, 'Now you'll see what I mean
[1:17:07] here, brethren. I'm driving towards one
[1:17:10] thing,
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; And the unifying of the body of Jesus
[1:17:21] Christ. Yeah.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; One thing
[1:17:25] I'm driving between the Jesus Christ
[1:17:29] and unifying the body of Jesus Christ.
[1:17:32] Brother Brown didn't care
[1:17:35] if you believe different than him. I'm
[1:17:37] going to prove this.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Do you?
[1:17:42] Now, I I have to disclaimer this because
[1:17:44] as soon as you say something like that,
[1:17:46] you'll say people will say, "Well, you
[1:17:47] don't believe what Brother Brham." I
[1:17:49] wholeheartedly believe what he preached.
[1:17:51] And this is what he preached.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; What I'm reading right here,
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; what I don't believe in is ministers
[1:17:59] pulling out their favorite oneliner
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; that's not balanced in the message
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; of the hour.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; He said that's my whole purpose
[1:18:11] is unifying.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Next paragraph. Now, I don't say nothing
[1:18:19] about,
[1:18:21] hey, you ain't baptized in Jesus name.
[1:18:25] Now, I want to just stop right there.
[1:18:28] That's true baptism.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; True baptism.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; That's true baptism.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Father's not a name. Son ain't a name.
[1:18:43] Father, Son, Holy Spirit, it's not a
[1:18:45] name. There's no [screaming] power in
[1:18:48] those titles.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; You know, I I want to just I want to sm
[1:18:52] this. You know, brother Bram had two or
[1:18:54] three times where he tried the power of
[1:18:57] God. Do you know he had he had Lucifer
[1:19:00] come in his room and stand at the head
[1:19:01] of his bed and challenged him in on the
[1:19:04] godhead of of how brother Brham taught
[1:19:06] the Godhead. And brother Bram said, you
[1:19:08] know, in the name of brother Brandham,
[1:19:09] William Brandham, and in the name of the
[1:19:11] titles and all this. But when brother
[1:19:13] Bam said in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; he said that Lucifer vanished.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he also talked about when he
[1:19:22] was in I forget the exact scenario, but
[1:19:25] he talked about twice I think there's at
[1:19:27] least two quotes where they were doing
[1:19:29] spiritual
[1:19:30] witchcraft and they had actually tooken
[1:19:33] a a table, a four-legged table, and it
[1:19:36] had wavered up in the air and it was
[1:19:38] floating up in the air and they were
[1:19:40] trying to curse Jehovah.
[1:19:44] They were mocking Jehovah. And brother
[1:19:47] Bram's presence.
[1:19:50] Brother Bram was not a a Brother Bam was
[1:19:52] a gentleman because he had the nature of
[1:19:54] Christ.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; But there's times when you're pushed
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; that it's more than you can take.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; But Brother Brham wanted to try it. And
[1:20:04] so he'd say he said and you know in the
[1:20:07] name of this and the table just stayed
[1:20:09] there. I'm talking the table super
[1:20:13] elevated off the floor. He said, "And
[1:20:17] and you know, he'd say his name, it's
[1:20:20] elevated. William Brandham, it's
[1:20:22] elevated. In the Father, Son, Holy
[1:20:24] Ghost, it's elevated. In the pastor's
[1:20:26] name, it's elevated."
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; And this is how the quote goes. He said,
[1:20:31] "But what I said, in the name of Jesus
[1:20:33] Christ, may you come down." He said, he
[1:20:35] said, "That table smashed down, all four
[1:20:36] legs broke off the table
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; because the power
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; is in the name
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; of Jehovah."
[1:20:49] But watch how the prophet
[1:20:52] explains this.
[1:20:55] He So, so you you understand that's true
[1:20:58] baptism.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; If you get baptized, you need to be
[1:21:01] baptized in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; But he said, "If you ain't baptized in
[1:21:08] Jesus' name, then you're going to hell."
[1:21:12] He said, "Now that's nonsense.
[1:21:20] Wait a minute. You don't You mean I got
[1:21:22] to quit insulting the trinitarians?
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now that's
[1:21:29] nonsense."
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; I I'm just going to show you a little
[1:21:33] disclaimer. There's a lot of people
[1:21:34] won't show you this.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Because they're building a kingdom onto
[1:21:38] theirel,
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; but brother Dale's not built this. See,
[1:21:42] you're not mine. Amen.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; You You're never will be mine.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; And And I'm a sinner.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Okay, you understand? I was born in sin,
[1:21:51] shaped in iniquity, come to the world
[1:21:52] stealing cookies.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Don't Don't get this wrong.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; You're Christ.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; We're his servants. I just happen to be
[1:22:02] the one sharing the word.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; We're his servant. Is that
[1:22:12] Can somebody huh?
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, sorry, Fred. Oh, that's all
[1:22:16] right. It didn't up said that's all. I
[1:22:19] was thinking it was mine. Fred, don't
[1:22:21] have a heart attack.
[1:22:24] It won't scare away God. It takes a lot
[1:22:25] more noise than that. Scare away God.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:30] That's the exact same ring I had. Say,
[1:22:32] I'm I'm sure I shut it off.
[1:22:35] Do you see how Do you see how our
[1:22:37] prophet was the seed of God
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; and he had the nature of God? Now watch
[1:22:42] watch his attitude.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; You just seen it there.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; I got to go down and find this. Oh, here
[1:22:51] we go. Did you find the next one there,
[1:22:54] Vicki? It's a bigger
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Oh. Oh, no. 11 11. Yeah, there we go.
[1:23:01] That's what I'm on. He said, 'Now
[1:23:03] brother, if you get to the place that
[1:23:05] you won't reach across the fence
[1:23:07] [snorts]
[1:23:08] and come across the street and associate
[1:23:12] and go to another church to hear
[1:23:13] Christmas carols.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; And call a man a brother just because
[1:23:20] there might be a little hair's
[1:23:22] difference.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Watch what he says in the paragraph.
[1:23:28] Yeah. Yeah.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; This is brother Brown talking. A little
[1:23:33] hair is different. He said, "How do you
[1:23:35] know you're not a little different in
[1:23:39] God's sight in some little something?"
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; You know what brother Brown just did
[1:23:50] there? He killed your arrogant spirit.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; He killed your arrogancy. Well, bless
[1:23:57] God. I've been in the message 45 years.
[1:24:00] I sat in the prophet's message and I
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; so
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; the Bible says, "Blessed are those that
[1:24:11] have not seen and yet still
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; believe."
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let's
[1:24:19] Let's go back. This I can actually give
[1:24:22] you the the title of this one.
[1:24:26] How do you know a hair's difference? How
[1:24:29] do you know that you might be off just a
[1:24:31] little something? You say, "Well, we
[1:24:33] have the revelation. All the mystery."
[1:24:35] Yes, there are all the mysteries. How do
[1:24:37] you believe your interpretation of the
[1:24:38] mysteries that Brother Brham did and
[1:24:39] aren't exactly
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; like Jehovah thought?
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Well, you you're saying your brain is as
[1:24:45] big as Jehovah.
[1:24:46] Well, let me just tell you something.
[1:24:48] The Jehovah I serve won't fit in your
[1:24:50] brain
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; even with the mysteries revealed.
[1:24:54] Because my Jehovah is bigger than about
[1:24:56] a three or three and a half pound brain.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; So no matter how much you see, let me
[1:25:01] tell you.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, is it okay to quote the
[1:25:06] Bible? The Bible says that we through a
[1:25:09] glass darkly.
[1:25:12] But someday
[1:25:14] [laughter]
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; someday I'm going to step right before
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; 100% of the presence
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; of Jehovah
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; and you won't be standing. I'll
[1:25:26] guarantee you that
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; and be a brother.
[1:25:41] And be a brother.
[1:25:44] Somebody is a hair different than you.
[1:25:46] And be a brother. And be a brother. Why
[1:25:48] certainly brother? The altar is your
[1:25:52] place. Exactly. Right. get right with
[1:25:55] God. I wouldn't want that evil spirit to
[1:25:58] ever be on me. That's right. The one the
[1:26:01] pot is calling the kettle black.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; And this whole series has been nothing
[1:26:12] but God shown me that a lot of ministry
[1:26:16] is the pot calling the kettle black.
[1:26:20] Help
[1:26:21] us, father.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; God, help me.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; I'm only human.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; You're ahead of me, Vicki.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Now, I apologize for boring you June
[1:26:40] 22nd message, but
[1:26:43] you know, when Paul wrote Corinthians,
[1:26:45] he wrote the same thing in chapter one
[1:26:46] as he wrote in chapter 3. Yeah.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; uh, we're doing the same thing as June
[1:26:53] here. Brother Brown says, "Wow,
[1:26:56] you belong to our organization or you
[1:26:59] don't belong to anything."
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; We're the one that's right and the rest
[1:27:04] of you
[1:27:06] is wrong.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Separate yourself.
[1:27:12] Oh my.
[1:27:14] Yay. The days of miracles has passed.
[1:27:16] That's He's just putting a scenario.
[1:27:18] They're not past. Yay. And divine
[1:27:20] healing. And there's nothing to it.
[1:27:22] Yeah, there is. Yo, and there's no such
[1:27:24] thing as this or the other. Watch what
[1:27:27] prophet says. He says, "Oh my." See,
[1:27:30] that's nothing but the poison breath
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; of Satan.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; You don't have nothing to do with him.
[1:27:40] You don't believe it like we do.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:45] and around the ranks of this. The reason
[1:27:48] we don't have nothing to do with
[1:27:50] anything other than our ranks and our
[1:27:54] camp meeting
[1:27:57] is because you don't believe to where
[1:27:59] you don't go to the you don't go to the
[1:28:00] temp camp. Well, no, you don't go to let
[1:28:04] me see. You don't go to the advis camp.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; And oh, fantastic man of God. Well, no,
[1:28:10] you don't go to the camp in New
[1:28:12] Brunswick.
[1:28:14] No. Uh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[1:28:16] There's there's got to be a camp
[1:28:17] somewhere else. No, I go to this one.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; And he said, "That's because you won't."
[1:28:28] He said, "That's the poison breath
[1:28:31] of Satan. We're the ones that's right,
[1:28:34] and all the rest of them are wrong."
[1:28:36] Well, of course you think you're right
[1:28:37] because you live in that tabernacle.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:44] But watch how Corinthians, I believe,
[1:28:46] what what did I read there? Corinthians
[1:28:47] 17 say it said that you're one member of
[1:28:51] the body.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; You're one ray of light that's blue
[1:28:55] coming off the diamond, but there's
[1:28:57] another ray coming off that's red.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; There's another one coming off. Now,
[1:29:01] those rays are still, now watch, I want
[1:29:03] to clarify something. Those rays are
[1:29:04] still going back to the God diamond. I'm
[1:29:07] not talking about leaving the word of
[1:29:09] God.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The word of God is you must be
[1:29:13] born again
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Let's go to another one here.
[1:29:24] 61 quote here. Just just a one
[1:29:26] paragraph. And I I have way more in my
[1:29:28] iPad here, but I'm literally scrolling.
[1:29:30] 61 is Vicki where I'm at. Um
[1:29:34] was just down a little bit from 116.
[1:29:40] I don't think that's He said, 'I tell
[1:29:43] you what, where we've made our mistake.
[1:29:46] Now, if you'd excuse me for saying this
[1:29:51] in closing,
[1:29:53] I picked that in the right spot because
[1:29:54] we are closing.
[1:30:00] Where we've made our mistake is we've
[1:30:02] tried to denominate oursel into it
[1:30:06] and we've made it and the rest of them
[1:30:08] don't have it. We have it and the rest
[1:30:12] of them don't have it. And then he names
[1:30:15] different churches.
[1:30:17] They're nothing. They're all cool. And
[1:30:19] he said, "If you don't watch out, you're
[1:30:21] going to be the same
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; as the others.
[1:30:26] And we're going to watch and find oursel
[1:30:28] that same way.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; So if we go back and we
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; the prophet said,
[1:30:39] he said, "If you don't watch out, you're
[1:30:41] going to fall too."
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's the poison breath of
[1:30:46] Satan."
[1:30:48] And then he said, "Well, that's what did
[1:30:50] he say? Foolishness. Something when you
[1:30:52] think somebody's going to hell.
[1:30:54] Ridiculous. I believe the word he said.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; And watch how brother Bram's
[1:31:05] and we're we're closing it. Watch how
[1:31:06] his seed and his nature and his attitude
[1:31:09] was. Watch how his his attitude was that
[1:31:13] I'm pointing everything to Jesus Christ.
[1:31:16] And my whole goal and my whole desire is
[1:31:20] unify everybody
[1:31:22] around this Jesus Christ.
[1:31:24] That's right.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Everybody.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; And like you're some aren't going to
[1:31:28] like pumpkin pie and some aren't going
[1:31:30] to like banana pie or cherry pie. And if
[1:31:32] you hit a pit, just spit it out. Don't
[1:31:34] throw the whole pie out cuz we worked
[1:31:35] really hard making the pie.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; But there might be, you know,
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; you see what I mean? And that is the
[1:31:43] spirit of Christ. Now, you have been
[1:31:46] enormously blessed.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. and this day to have a star
[1:31:51] messenger
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; come and reveal the mysteries of the
[1:31:55] Bible. But if that makes you arrogant,
[1:31:58] you backslid.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; You backslid.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; And many
[1:32:06] I I believe God's going to let me say
[1:32:07] this. And many are in that state right
[1:32:11] there.
[1:32:17] God help us. That has to change for
[1:32:21] those that are going in a rapture.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; That's to change. Now, I want to just
[1:32:25] close with this scenario. You know,
[1:32:27] God's going to have a wife
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; and that's going to be caught away in a
[1:32:31] rapture. There's going to be a great
[1:32:34] tribulation on the earth. We're going to
[1:32:36] have a honeymoon, which will be a
[1:32:38] thousand years. While the tribulation's
[1:32:40] carrying over, there'll be 145,000 Jews
[1:32:43] saved. Then there will be those that are
[1:32:45] converted in the tribulation, Gentiles,
[1:32:48] and those that were even good to the
[1:32:50] bride that will actually be serend.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; But your attitude
[1:32:59] can never change where those people are
[1:33:02] placed.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; But watch this. But your attitude will
[1:33:05] change where you're placed.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Amen. Your attitude
[1:33:11] towards me
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; will never change.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Where brother Dale's being placed.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; But that same attitude would change your
[1:33:21] placing.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Remember our first quote that we read?
[1:33:29] Everything
[1:33:32] that's that's a lot of stuff that God
[1:33:35] does
[1:33:36] is based on your attitude.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[1:33:45] God help us. He left the splendor of
[1:33:48] heaven. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord God. Let's sing that
[1:33:52] song.
[1:33:53] Hallelujah. He left the splendor of
[1:33:55] heaven
[1:33:57] for a no good sinner boy like brother
[1:33:59] Dale.
[1:34:01] He left the splender
[1:34:05] of heaven,
[1:34:10] knowing
[1:34:12] his destiny
[1:34:18] was

[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music and singing] He left
[1:37:57] this place. Thank you, Jesus of heaven.
[1:38:01] [music]
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Praise him. Blessed is your name. Let's
[1:38:04] sing that song. We're singing again.
[1:38:07] Come, let us adore him. You know,
[1:38:08] church, I want to share [music]
[1:38:10] something with you.
[1:38:13] When you have your light of your baptism
[1:38:15] of the Holy Spirit
[1:38:19] and you're in the presence of God,
[1:38:24] I'd have a hard time seeing your light
[1:38:27] [music]
[1:38:28] for God's light.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; But God placed us where we are.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; To go where it's dark.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; You're to go where it's dark. Where
[1:38:40] brother Dale can't go. [music]
[1:38:42] and where your neighbor can't go
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; and where your husband can't go and
[1:38:47] where your wife can't go and you take
[1:38:49] that exact same light and it's just
[1:38:53] radiant
[1:38:55] [music]
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; and you're the only one in the room with
[1:38:57] that light.
[1:39:01] Everybody in your presence [music]
[1:39:04] will see your light.
[1:39:08] Don't hide your light
[1:39:10] under a [music] bushel.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; That's all these messages are.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Throw away your church bushel
[1:39:20] [music]
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; and let your light shine all around.
[1:39:25] And then on Sunday, you can bring your
[1:39:26] light back to church. [music] Put it
[1:39:28] under the bushel.
[1:39:30] Cuz see, we all have the same light. If
[1:39:32] we were all baptism
[1:39:35] had the new birth, we all had the same
[1:39:37] light. So we don't have to shine our
[1:39:38] light to each other's. [music] It's not
[1:39:40] about brother Dale's light shining more
[1:39:42] than anybody else's light. Even little
[1:39:44] child.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; But when you get out these doors, throw
[1:39:48] them in the bush.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; That's what all these messages meant.
[1:39:58] [music]
[1:40:02] We've been hiding our light far too long
[1:40:05] [music]
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; and nobody can see it.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing this and we'll be
[1:40:12] dismissed. God, we love you. God bless
[1:40:15] you. Amen. [music] He loves you. Come
[1:40:20] us. [singing and music]
[1:40:30] Yeah. [singing]
