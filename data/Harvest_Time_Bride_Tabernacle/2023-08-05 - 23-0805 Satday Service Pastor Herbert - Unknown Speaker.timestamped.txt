[28:05] the Lord
[28:08] well my names I'm rather Herbert makoba
[28:12] from Uganda
[28:14] and I would like to present my greetings
[28:18] from my home Church my
[28:21] Uganda brethren
[28:22] much greetings to you in the name of our
[28:26] Lord Jesus Christ
[28:29] I do appreciate very much if I can go
[28:33] back into a memory
[28:35] about your appearance brother Daryl
[28:38] black staff and your wife
[28:41] and the brother Jose Garcia
[28:44] we were glad to receive you in Uganda
[28:48] and we were very happy
[28:51] with the job that was done in Michiana
[28:55] and how people believed and they took
[28:57] baptism
[28:59] it was a very good image in the sight of
[29:02] the Lord
[29:04] may God continue to bless you Brothers
[29:07] and it has been in my heart to say let
[29:10] me go under see how my brothers are
[29:12] doing there
[29:13] and I'm glad the Lord has allowed me to
[29:16] come
[29:17] praise the Lord
[29:19] amen
[29:20] so
[29:23] I will not waste time
[29:26] but I will straight away go to the world
[29:28] and I will speak from the bottom of my
[29:31] heart whether we are few I don't care
[29:34] whether we are two or three
[29:37] the Bible says Jesus said
[29:40] where two or three are gathered I am in
[29:44] the Emirates
[29:47] so therefore
[29:49] we are glad that he is in our Midwest
[29:53] and I want to speak from the bottom of
[29:56] my heart
[29:57] what the Lord will put on my heart
[30:00] because
[30:02] a man cannot live by bread alone
[30:06] but by every word
[30:09] that proceedeth from the mouth of the
[30:12] Lord
[30:14] it may be just a small word but it is of
[30:17] great effect
[30:20] God gave Jonah a very little word
[30:25] on a paper
[30:28] go
[30:29] and tell the people of the Navy
[30:34] that within 40 days time if you repent
[30:38] or not
[30:39] you will die
[30:40] it was not many pages
[30:43] it was just very if you could write down
[30:46] it was very small something on a small
[30:50] paper
[30:51] but it was carrying a lot of importance
[30:55] to the life of people
[30:59] it was so tremendous that if you cut if
[31:02] you could listen to those small words on
[31:04] the paper
[31:05] you live
[31:07] if you not listen to those small words
[31:10] on that paper and oh those are very
[31:12] rewards you cannot live
[31:16] so we are glad everyone that comes from
[31:19] here we live by that
[31:22] amen can we stand up now
[31:29] uh we shall
[31:31] turn to our Bibles in the book of
[31:34] Matthew chapter 10
[31:39] and then the book of Romans chapter 10
[31:44] all of them are chapter 10 chapter 10.
[31:47] so Book of Matthew chapter 10
[31:51] which already from verse
[31:53] 41
[31:57] verse 41.
[32:02] then the book of
[32:04] Luke I mean
[32:06] Romans chapter 10
[32:09] verse 14 and 15. let's read
[32:15] he that receiveth a prophet
[32:20] in the name of a prophet
[32:22] shall receive a prophet's reward
[32:26] and he
[32:28] that to receiveth righteous man
[32:31] in the name of a righteous man
[32:33] shall receive a righteous man's reward
[32:38] then let's go the book of Romans chapter
[32:42] 10 14
[32:45] and 15.
[32:48] how then shall they call on him
[32:53] in whom they have not believed
[32:57] and how shall they believe in him
[33:01] of whom they have not heard
[33:04] and how
[33:06] shall they hear without a preacher
[33:11] and how
[33:12] shall they preach except they be sent
[33:17] as it is written how beautiful are the
[33:20] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[33:22] peace and I bring glad the tidings
[33:25] of good things
[33:29] Father Here we are your children
[33:33] Lord God I call upon your presence into
[33:38] these scriptures
[33:40] may you father expound
[33:43] this word our souls
[33:45] because even one soul is so tremendous
[33:48] in your sight
[33:50] you preached through your Prophet One in
[33:54] a Million
[33:55] that was so tremendous
[33:58] father may your word edify us here
[34:02] both body spiritual and
[34:05] our spirits
[34:08] father we need your blessings
[34:12] forgive us in anything
[34:14] and Lord that we may be precious before
[34:17] your sight
[34:19] granted is my prayer in Jesus name Lord
[34:23] we pray amen
[34:25] we may be seated
[34:29] so my dear brothers and my dear sisters
[34:34] I want
[34:36] to
[34:37] from the holy Oracles of God let me
[34:41] bring out something especially from The
[34:45] Book of Matthew where we have read
[34:48] ah
[34:50] verse 41 he that receiveth a prophet in
[34:54] the name of a prophet shall receive a
[34:57] prophet his reward
[34:58] and he that receiveth righteous man in
[35:01] the name of a righteous man shall
[35:03] receive a righteous man's reward so I
[35:06] want to talk about
[35:09] how we receive our prophety's reward
[35:13] that's what I'm going to concentrate
[35:17] I want to concentrate very much on that
[35:20] how
[35:22] to receive a prophet's reward
[35:26] that is nice now how we can receive a
[35:30] prophet is reward
[35:32] there is a program with God
[35:37] this God says
[35:39] data
[35:41] how then shall they uh how how then
[35:46] shall they call on him in whom they have
[35:49] not believed
[35:51] that is a question
[35:55] how can we call on him
[35:59] in together
[36:02] in a straight line
[36:05] not a crooked line but a straight line
[36:09] so that the result the good result is a
[36:15] reward from God
[36:18] praise the Lord
[36:20] that is it
[36:22] so therefore we find that in the Book of
[36:26] Matthew God is talking about
[36:30] he who will receive a prophet so that
[36:33] one who is talking is our Lord Jesus
[36:35] Christ we can take him
[36:37] so then if he sends a prophet then we
[36:41] must get him
[36:42] then we we must also be a true receiver
[36:50] because
[36:51] he's talking like this
[36:54] he is talking like this whoever receives
[36:59] so that means we must have a true
[37:02] receiver
[37:04] so therefore these three people we are
[37:07] talking of
[37:09] all of them must be true
[37:13] now what about God
[37:17] um
[37:18] important
[37:19] omniscient forever he remains a true God
[37:26] he has never changed
[37:30] he is always a true God
[37:33] and when he sends he also sends a true
[37:38] prophet
[37:40] that's right
[37:43] so it intends you he intends that this
[37:47] true Prophet will be received
[37:51] by who by the true receivers
[37:58] Ary so the three
[38:00] if you change one then things don't go
[38:04] right
[38:06] now we have confidence in God that for
[38:10] him forever and ever
[38:13] eternity he remains a true God
[38:19] but who can change
[38:21] the only person who can change is may be
[38:24] a prophet because it's a human being
[38:27] the only person who can change is maybe
[38:30] a receiver because he's a human being
[38:33] but God
[38:36] when he chooses
[38:38] he chooses a true prophet
[38:43] he says like this
[38:46] that Jeremiah before he was born God
[38:49] knew him from his mother's womb
[38:53] therefore God chooses always our true
[38:57] prophet
[38:59] so why do how and why
[39:03] that some people they miss a reward why
[39:08] it's because they make the line crooked
[39:15] okay
[39:17] I will I will bring an example
[39:20] a good example
[39:22] we want to line up some good example of
[39:25] prophets from the Bible
[39:27] we shall start from the book of uh maybe
[39:31] uh the book of First Kings chapter 17
[39:35] you will find out that
[39:37] the word of God came to Elijah
[39:43] Elijah Tish bite is God who sent him
[39:48] so when he sent to him
[39:51] how did he do
[39:54] he had
[39:56] to test him
[39:58] he had
[40:00] to build in him a good foundation
[40:04] a good foundation of obedience
[40:08] because God always he does his things in
[40:11] order
[40:13] when he wants to do something he builds
[40:16] it on a strong Foundation
[40:21] if it pertains the word of God he builds
[40:25] it on a an obedient Foundation
[40:31] and an obedient Foundation is always
[40:33] very very strong
[40:37] that's how God does
[40:39] so so he started like this
[40:42] bite
[40:45] and then he line is him
[40:48] so the word of God that's the number one
[40:51] we have already started with the number
[40:53] one God
[40:54] he's looking for a second person
[40:57] then he finds Elijah Tish bite
[41:00] and then he sends to him
[41:02] so the Bible tells me
[41:05] that uh he sent to him let me read it
[41:09] there
[41:10] okay okay okay let me read that the book
[41:13] of
[41:14] Foster Kings
[41:17] yes chapter 17. that's right aha first
[41:20] king chapter 17 let me read I will start
[41:23] from uh verse
[41:27] verse 2.
[41:30] and the word of the Lord
[41:32] came unto him
[41:34] saying get the hands and Eternity
[41:38] Eastward and hide thyself by the Brook
[41:44] that is before Jordan
[41:46] and it shall be that thou shalt drink of
[41:50] the Brook and I have commanded the
[41:54] Reverend is to feed thee there
[41:57] that's fine and so he went and the day
[42:00] that according unto the word of the Lord
[42:03] for he went and dwelt by the Brook
[42:05] carries that is before Jordan now
[42:09] imagine
[42:10] imagine God is sending Elijah here
[42:14] things that are odd it's not simple
[42:18] it was not used or that people should go
[42:21] under dwell by the river
[42:24] whenever he could send people he sends
[42:28] them to people's homes
[42:31] where there is a home where they can eat
[42:33] well and sleep well
[42:36] but here he sends them him to a river
[42:41] and then he reveals to him that I have
[42:44] already prepared
[42:46] I have already talked because I'm a
[42:49] Creator I talk with all the creation I
[42:52] command every Recreation as I did
[42:55] command in the time of Noah two by two
[42:58] to go to the to the to the to to the to
[43:01] the ship or maybe
[43:03] yes that he built the ark
[43:06] I commanded the animals to go to the ark
[43:09] I have also commanded the Ravens
[43:13] who regardless of their situation
[43:17] whether they have a bad history that in
[43:19] the time of Noah
[43:21] they did it only the dead bodies
[43:25] and rebelled
[43:27] so you have no question
[43:30] I am sending you
[43:33] go under dwell by the river Calif
[43:37] I have commanded the Robins
[43:40] they will feed you
[43:43] so don't ask whether they pick food from
[43:47] the from the garbage
[43:51] whether they pick from where
[43:54] whatever
[43:58] no need of imagination is
[44:01] you just believe
[44:05] so it was such a a very hard situation
[44:10] but God is preparing this money here
[44:16] to be a true obedient prophet
[44:24] a true obedient prophet
[44:28] who can it be of great profit to others
[44:35] Hallelujah
[44:36] okay
[44:38] now here the Bible tells me
[44:41] that and he went and the deed according
[44:45] according
[44:49] not doing shortcuts
[44:52] no reasoning capacities
[44:55] no saying how
[44:58] no question
[45:02] he just went
[45:04] and indeed
[45:06] according to the word of God
[45:08] but what is God intending to do
[45:13] he's intending
[45:15] to bring out a reward
[45:18] through
[45:19] as straight
[45:21] prepared lion
[45:24] of obedient people because God himself
[45:28] is ever righteous
[45:30] is ever holy and his other obedient and
[45:35] that is ever good
[45:39] now he is preparing a very good conduit
[45:43] a good way
[45:45] how he can send the blessings to God to
[45:49] flow so good smoothly to the destination
[45:53] praise the Lord
[45:56] yeah
[45:58] Here Comes Paul understand something
[46:01] in the book of
[46:03] Hebrews chapter 10 verse 35 is there he
[46:06] says like this
[46:08] cast not away your confidence
[46:11] that has a great reward
[46:15] that after you have done after you have
[46:18] done God needs you to do his will
[46:23] so that he can send his reward to flow
[46:27] so smoothly to you
[46:30] because God is he has never been a liar
[46:35] he's always a true God
[46:38] it is we human beings
[46:40] who make things hard
[46:44] it is we human beings
[46:46] who smear him
[46:48] pots
[46:51] but he's always holy
[46:54] and righteous God
[46:57] it's we who only amend ourselves
[47:01] it is the we who correct ourselves and
[47:04] line up in the line
[47:07] so that we can receive the promises
[47:11] so that we can receive the promises
[47:14] praise the Lord
[47:16] all right
[47:18] let's go ahead
[47:19] so we find out that
[47:21] here goes Elijah
[47:25] and stays by the river Gareth and the
[47:29] ravenis brings some meat
[47:32] we don't know where it was from
[47:36] but this man became so obedient
[47:39] because it was God
[47:43] and sometimes even Jesus said
[47:46] for their sake I sanctify myself
[47:51] so therefore
[47:53] Elijah
[47:54] was sanctifying himself
[47:57] foreign
[48:03] and become of a great prophet or a great
[48:07] reward
[48:08] to a certain third believer
[48:12] to defend the person remember that we
[48:15] were aligning here three people God in
[48:18] the middle of prophet and lastly a true
[48:21] receiver because Jesus said whoever
[48:23] receives a prophet
[48:26] so we we need to be so there was a
[48:28] certain Widow
[48:31] so this Widow was a true receiver
[48:35] so God was intending
[48:38] but before he sends Elijah to a widow
[48:42] he prepares the things
[48:46] he prepared the Ravens he said I have
[48:49] already done that I have commanded the
[48:51] rabbits
[48:52] then he prepares a widow
[48:55] she will receive a prophet
[48:57] because he said how will they receive or
[49:01] how will they call on him of whom they
[49:03] have never heard of and then he said how
[49:06] will they go except they are sent
[49:10] that's right so God prepares everything
[49:15] and our job is just to line up and be
[49:18] obedient
[49:19] and then we do
[49:21] according
[49:23] to the word of God through who through a
[49:27] prophet
[49:29] uh let's go back at the that we are
[49:31] seeing the book of
[49:33] we are still in the book of First Kings
[49:38] but
[49:40] before you go to the book of First Kings
[49:42] let me read something here a quote
[49:45] let me read a quote here of brother
[49:48] Branham
[49:49] about this woman here
[49:52] the
[49:55] uh that Widow
[49:58] about that Widow
[50:02] the prophet says like this
[50:07] uh
[50:13] yes in this message reaction to an
[50:17] action
[50:20] he says like this
[50:23] then she had
[50:26] she started to turn again
[50:29] and she heard the voice saying
[50:33] but bring me one fast
[50:37] what do we learn here
[50:42] seek you first the kingdom of God
[50:47] how will
[50:49] I meet it
[50:51] I can't tell you
[50:53] but you put God first
[50:57] seek you first the kingdom of God
[51:00] and his righteousness all these three
[51:03] things
[51:04] all these things will be added
[51:08] bring me fast one
[51:12] obedience
[51:15] when God is the prophet says a certain
[51:18] thing
[51:19] do it hold on to it
[51:24] that's right
[51:27] now
[51:29] here goes Prophet Elijah
[51:34] God is preparing a line
[51:37] God is preparing a conduit to wear
[51:41] the blessings where the true reward
[51:45] goes through to a final destination
[51:50] and reaches the final person
[51:53] so now here comes
[51:55] Elijah to a home of this Widow
[51:58] but God tell him that God tells Elijah
[52:00] that arise
[52:03] and a god
[52:05] to verifiers of his Eden
[52:08] I have I have already done this again
[52:15] I have commanded the widow woman to feed
[52:18] you
[52:20] I've done that
[52:23] so
[52:24] however he goes
[52:26] of course the woman will also try to
[52:29] resist
[52:32] but
[52:33] a good Prophet always
[52:36] he corrects the error
[52:40] and he tries to bring you back to the
[52:43] line
[52:46] because this woman what did she do
[52:50] she started it look at the circumstances
[52:54] and then she started the reasoning
[52:58] she did not go very quick on the line as
[53:02] a true receiver
[53:04] but he was trying to dodge
[53:08] she was trying to stray
[53:11] but because a prophet is already in
[53:14] God's program he knows what is he doing
[53:18] then he started to say but that's why
[53:21] Prophet Branham also quoted that thing
[53:24] that but
[53:25] that means he is trying to correct the
[53:28] error
[53:30] but bringing me fast
[53:34] right
[53:37] until she obeyed
[53:42] when she obeyed oh quickly she lined up
[53:45] in the line
[53:47] praise the Lord
[53:49] when she lined up in the line
[53:51] things went so well
[53:54] I tell you how life changed
[53:58] they were living in the time of famine
[54:04] they were living in a time of trouble
[54:08] oh yeah
[54:10] they were living in the time of death
[54:13] because even she confessed with her
[54:15] mouth
[54:16] you know anything you have to confess it
[54:18] with your mouth
[54:19] she said I have just little I with my
[54:23] kid we eat and then we die
[54:29] so they were living in a time of death
[54:32] that was our expectation
[54:35] praise the Lord
[54:37] but now when the prophet comes he
[54:40] corrects the error
[54:43] he brings her back to the line
[54:47] and when she lined up I tell you
[54:51] miracles happened
[54:57] Crews of oil never wasted
[55:01] the pan of the floor
[55:04] it it remained
[55:06] miracles
[55:08] what happened she ate she ate
[55:12] she became so good she was transformed
[55:20] Here Comes Paul unders says in the Book
[55:23] of Romans chapter 12. I beseech you
[55:25] brethren don't be confirmed like this
[55:29] world but rather be transformed
[55:33] so this woman here started to transform
[55:36] our life
[55:38] and she became a Christian she became a
[55:41] question people asked how come everyone
[55:45] looks skinny
[55:48] everyone is just bending to death
[55:52] looking to the soil
[55:56] how cows that you walk upright
[56:01] and you are happy
[56:04] and you are glad
[56:07] what happened tell us a mystery
[56:11] the mystery is
[56:14] I received
[56:17] a prophet
[56:19] and now I have a reward
[56:22] of what you see in my home
[56:25] praise the Lord
[56:28] I tell you
[56:30] when we line up
[56:33] we don't make God headaches
[56:37] we make him happy
[56:39] if we can line up
[56:42] in the word of God
[56:45] Things become so easy
[56:48] Hallelujah
[56:54] that is what happened
[56:58] she received
[56:59] a prophet is a reward
[57:04] also
[57:07] if we don't go very far
[57:10] it was in the mind of Jesus
[57:13] to speak and remind the Pharisees
[57:18] that you for us is
[57:20] here I am
[57:22] fulfilling the scriptures
[57:25] in the book of Deuteronomy
[57:27] it was written that
[57:30] God said
[57:31] I will give you a prophet
[57:34] like you Moses
[57:37] and the weather will never receive all
[57:40] listen to him
[57:42] will be cut off so I have come in that
[57:46] category in that room to fulfill the
[57:50] scriptures
[57:51] and now you are trying to stand crooked
[57:56] you are straying away from the line
[58:01] he was blaming them
[58:02] and here
[58:05] he was reminding them let's go to the
[58:07] scripture
[58:09] let's read the book of
[58:11] look
[58:13] chapter 4.
[58:15] let's read the book of Luke chapter 4
[58:19] verse 25.
[58:27] that's right
[58:29] okay it is here on the my screen but I
[58:33] tell you the truth
[58:36] many widows were in Israel in the days
[58:39] of Elias
[58:41] when the heaven was shut up
[58:44] three years under six months
[58:46] when great feminine was throughout all
[58:49] the land
[58:50] yeah keep on rolling
[58:55] but unto none of them
[58:57] was Elisha sent
[59:04] and a woman that was a widow
[59:07] you see how Jesus is bringing the things
[59:11] he says always things are in order
[59:14] how can they Colony him of whom they
[59:18] have never heard
[59:19] and how can they go except they are sent
[59:23] now here comes Jesus remaining these
[59:26] forces
[59:27] telling them reminding them about the
[59:31] Widow
[59:32] that means this is for us is
[59:35] are refusing because they are going to
[59:38] call him bills
[59:41] they are going to doubt in him
[59:45] they are going to call him son of
[59:48] he has no a proper father
[59:51] bastard is seed maybe whatever
[59:54] so therefore
[59:55] Jesus is saying oh
[59:58] you see
[59:59] in the days of
[1:00:01] that Widow
[1:00:03] the days of Elias
[1:00:06] the window of Sarah Peter
[1:00:10] there was no one who was sent there
[1:00:12] except it was Elijah
[1:00:15] and no one received the Elijah except
[1:00:17] that Widow
[1:00:19] now what are you doing
[1:00:21] you are trying to
[1:00:24] misconstrue or to stray the line
[1:00:27] to let the conduit be zigzag
[1:00:31] and that you miss the promises
[1:00:34] and you missed their words he was
[1:00:36] blaming them
[1:00:41] praise the Lord
[1:00:44] he was blaming them
[1:00:46] because he was reminding them
[1:00:50] so therefore he did not end there
[1:00:53] continue he's going to talk about it we
[1:00:55] want to bring another Prophet again
[1:00:58] and that will be Elias himself the one
[1:01:01] who received the double portion from
[1:01:03] Elijah
[1:01:06] Contin my brother because I can see you
[1:01:09] putting you on the screen
[1:01:11] uh-huh
[1:01:12] another verse
[1:01:16] and
[1:01:18] all there in this synagogue when they
[1:01:20] had these things were okay let me open
[1:01:24] myself and read it there The Book of
[1:01:27] Luke I think another verse 25 verse 25
[1:01:29] you are on 28th I wanted verse 25.
[1:01:38] but I tell you of the truth
[1:01:45] that's 25 verse 26 again
[1:01:52] [Music]
[1:01:58] okay
[1:02:00] I won't read about uh
[1:02:03] Elias
[1:02:08] 26
[1:02:10] okay
[1:02:13] that's right
[1:02:16] let me go there myself uh-huh
[1:02:21] but
[1:02:23] verse 27
[1:02:25] and the many
[1:02:28] verse 27 under many Reapers
[1:02:32] Where in Israel in the time of Elijah's
[1:02:36] they profit
[1:02:39] and none of them was cleansed
[1:02:43] saving in a man
[1:02:45] of the Syria
[1:02:47] you see why is he quoting me
[1:02:51] he's quoting me
[1:02:53] he's going back to the courts
[1:02:59] we have some believers who don't believe
[1:03:00] in quoting
[1:03:02] I wonder what they want to do
[1:03:05] quoting is not bad
[1:03:08] and also quoting as a purpose
[1:03:13] we have some
[1:03:15] we have some two Disciples of Jesus
[1:03:17] Christ
[1:03:19] who wanted very much to court but they
[1:03:21] had a wrong spirit
[1:03:25] they told Jesus
[1:03:28] that do you want us to qualify from
[1:03:31] heaven
[1:03:32] and ban these people like he did
[1:03:35] Elijah
[1:03:37] then Jesus rebuked them that no
[1:03:40] you don't know what kind of a spirit you
[1:03:42] have
[1:03:44] so that quoting was wrong
[1:03:48] but this quoting that Jesus is also
[1:03:51] quoting is good
[1:03:53] so therefore we believe in two things
[1:03:56] we believe in quoting
[1:04:01] but it depends on why are you quoting
[1:04:05] that's right
[1:04:07] so we should totally not deny quoting
[1:04:10] quoting is good
[1:04:14] also quoting has a purpose with some
[1:04:17] preachers
[1:04:19] they can caught but with a wrong spirit
[1:04:24] praise the Lord
[1:04:27] so here
[1:04:30] our Lord is quoting with a purpose
[1:04:36] that's right
[1:04:37] like I'm quoting here I'm quoting with a
[1:04:40] purpose
[1:04:41] sure
[1:04:44] that's true
[1:04:46] so he's talking about Norman
[1:04:50] because all of these people
[1:04:53] there they rewarded that they received
[1:04:57] was the change of their bodies
[1:05:02] that woman the word that she received
[1:05:06] was a change of her body because when
[1:05:09] you don't eat you get so lean skinny
[1:05:12] until you die
[1:05:16] that's right
[1:05:21] and also with the mama
[1:05:24] when the leprous continues it eats you
[1:05:27] until you die
[1:05:32] amen
[1:05:35] so we live by the word of God
[1:05:41] so
[1:05:44] the Bible tells me
[1:05:46] there was a young lady
[1:05:49] who was gotten from Israel
[1:05:52] God touched her
[1:05:55] and she reminded The Mummy
[1:05:59] the mistress in the home
[1:06:02] can you approach Daddy
[1:06:05] and tell him that dra is
[1:06:09] a prophet in Israel
[1:06:14] if he can go
[1:06:17] and line up in the line and become a
[1:06:20] true receiver
[1:06:22] whoever receives a prophet
[1:06:25] in the name of a prophet
[1:06:28] shall receive a prophetess reward
[1:06:32] so I'm explaining
[1:06:34] how it was
[1:06:36] how it was meant to be
[1:06:40] if my master can go to Israel
[1:06:43] and line up
[1:06:45] and don't have any question is
[1:06:47] regardless of which prophet he will find
[1:06:51] God will use that one
[1:06:54] he will receive a reward
[1:06:56] and that reward will change his body
[1:07:01] and then here goes Naman
[1:07:04] and he carries all kind of prizes
[1:07:07] and all kind of things
[1:07:10] and then he goes to the headquarters
[1:07:13] of Israel thinking that things per thing
[1:07:16] is pretty cool things
[1:07:18] can be done with the political Affairs
[1:07:21] no
[1:07:25] political Affairs does not even do
[1:07:28] anything to our spiritual
[1:07:32] so when he reached the headquarters of
[1:07:35] Israel
[1:07:36] I think maybe they made the big gun gun
[1:07:40] shoots under big parade sand salutes
[1:07:43] is because all the all other nations
[1:07:46] were panicking because of
[1:07:48] nerman he was a victorious man in
[1:07:50] fighting he was killed
[1:07:54] he was a champion
[1:07:56] everyone from trembles
[1:07:59] the Bible tells me that he had done a
[1:08:02] lot of victories
[1:08:04] and when he reached Israel
[1:08:07] they must give him respect and I know
[1:08:09] they did it
[1:08:12] I know when presidents
[1:08:14] they when they visit other countries
[1:08:16] they give them big respect and The Poets
[1:08:19] and so on and they can pray the national
[1:08:22] anthems and so on
[1:08:24] so all that happened but it was not
[1:08:27] going to help
[1:08:29] so when he reached to tell the purpose
[1:08:31] where he went to Israel
[1:08:33] he said
[1:08:34] honorable king of Israel
[1:08:38] I came here because there's good news
[1:08:40] that when I come here
[1:08:42] you know how you can cleanse me
[1:08:45] from leprosy oh that was beyond the
[1:08:49] possibility of king of Israel
[1:08:52] he started crying I saying oh
[1:08:55] that's the only way how he's looking for
[1:08:58] work
[1:09:01] oh I can't
[1:09:03] but God who's rich in the mercy
[1:09:07] takes the news to a a true prophet
[1:09:12] to a second man in the middle
[1:09:16] one is God second is a true Prophet
[1:09:19] third must be a true receiver then the
[1:09:22] reward comes
[1:09:24] so here
[1:09:25] Elisha says send him to me because
[1:09:30] behind me there's always there's a true
[1:09:32] God and I am true let him come and line
[1:09:36] up to be true he will receive a reward
[1:09:43] Hallelujah
[1:09:45] he will receive a reward
[1:09:49] then here comes in a man
[1:09:52] he reaches the premises of Prophet
[1:09:54] Elijah
[1:09:56] now Prophet Elijah says
[1:09:59] the true receivers
[1:10:02] according to this time
[1:10:04] they must be obedient only to The Voice
[1:10:08] there is no need of seeing a prophet
[1:10:10] then gaining faith
[1:10:12] it's time of just obedient The Voice
[1:10:19] yeah that's true
[1:10:21] we have some Believers in this message
[1:10:23] who are awaiting Prophet Branham to come
[1:10:26] back under pressure to them that is
[1:10:29] wrong
[1:10:34] we have some of them
[1:10:37] who wants him when he comes back
[1:10:39] and then they go and then in they kneel
[1:10:42] down and then he touches them and then
[1:10:44] he prays for them
[1:10:46] that will not work
[1:10:49] it is in the time of The Voice
[1:10:52] we have heard the voice
[1:10:55] we do according to the voice
[1:11:01] we are not Thomas
[1:11:04] we are in the time of faith
[1:11:08] Thomas says unless I see him under Luke
[1:11:11] and then he touched and then I can
[1:11:13] believe
[1:11:14] no need of that
[1:11:17] so here comes
[1:11:19] normal
[1:11:22] and Elijah
[1:11:24] picks from the house
[1:11:27] and the sense only their voice
[1:11:31] listen to The Voice
[1:11:33] and when the voice came
[1:11:35] this man he said oh
[1:11:39] what is he saying
[1:11:40] go under deep in River Jordan
[1:11:44] and then it starts imagination and
[1:11:47] comparing under whatever
[1:11:49] he's refusing to line up
[1:11:53] he says I thought he would come up
[1:11:57] and touch me and a bit and do this and I
[1:12:00] do everything and whatever that's what I
[1:12:03] thought
[1:12:04] and then he started the fuming
[1:12:07] and any thought
[1:12:09] I thought it would come
[1:12:11] and I see
[1:12:13] and find out what kind of
[1:12:16] a very important man is talking to
[1:12:20] and that cannot walk in the kingdom of
[1:12:23] God
[1:12:26] yes brother Joseph
[1:12:28] in the kingdom of God there is no
[1:12:30] important people
[1:12:33] all of us are children of God
[1:12:39] now I thought all these ranks
[1:12:43] all these escorts surrounding me
[1:12:46] all these presence
[1:12:48] all these words that I have
[1:12:51] if we would have come and looked at
[1:12:53] these things
[1:12:54] he would have trembled so quickly
[1:12:57] understand what I need because
[1:13:00] so all that he thought was out of line
[1:13:04] it cannot work
[1:13:11] we are talking of God builds things on
[1:13:14] an obedient Foundation
[1:13:18] God wanted him
[1:13:24] obedience is when a prophet of God it
[1:13:28] tells you something to do it do it
[1:13:35] let's go back again before I finish this
[1:13:38] let's read something in the book of
[1:13:43] yeah fast Kings
[1:13:46] chapter we shall read the two verses
[1:13:49] chapter 17 we shall read verse 5
[1:13:53] and verse 15.
[1:13:55] let's read
[1:14:00] verse 5
[1:14:05] chapter yeah
[1:14:07] First Kings
[1:14:09] uh
[1:14:12] verse
[1:14:15] five says
[1:14:17] this is now the prophet isn't it
[1:14:20] so he went and did according unto the
[1:14:25] word of the Lord
[1:14:26] that is number two in the middle
[1:14:30] so let's see number three verse 15.
[1:14:33] roll down verse 15 quickly aha number
[1:14:37] three a true receiver
[1:14:39] and she went
[1:14:42] and indeed according to the saying of
[1:14:46] Elijah
[1:14:48] what happened
[1:14:51] things went so smooth
[1:14:55] that's what we do
[1:14:58] some people want to be just robbers
[1:15:00] Through the Windows
[1:15:02] and Jesus said don't be a widow don't be
[1:15:06] a robber Don't Be Fifth
[1:15:11] friend how did you come here he says
[1:15:17] and then
[1:15:19] he says you did not go through the door
[1:15:25] so some people want to meet God Through
[1:15:27] the Windows
[1:15:29] no it cannot work
[1:15:31] it must be through the door
[1:15:34] where things are lined up
[1:15:37] our Prophet said
[1:15:39] stay in the line
[1:15:42] why did he scream like that he knew
[1:15:45] things that people who do stray from the
[1:15:48] line
[1:15:52] other ways
[1:15:54] that's why they want to create
[1:15:55] denominations out of the message
[1:15:58] that's why they are doubting the message
[1:16:01] that's why they are doubting the prophet
[1:16:03] that's why they are falling away
[1:16:07] it's because they have refused to line
[1:16:09] up
[1:16:13] brothers and sisters
[1:16:15] we are on a right Channel
[1:16:20] we are on a right line
[1:16:24] we must continue whether people fall Let
[1:16:27] Them Fall if they live let them live
[1:16:30] but you follow these examples that I
[1:16:33] have told you things are very good
[1:16:39] Hallelujah
[1:16:42] we are on the right track
[1:16:44] no worries
[1:16:46] no worries we are on the right track
[1:16:51] praise the Lord
[1:16:55] now
[1:16:57] Elisha
[1:17:00] what brought him on the line
[1:17:03] the Common People the Bible tells me the
[1:17:06] common people had Jesus gladly
[1:17:09] when he preached the gospel
[1:17:11] the Common People received him gladly
[1:17:14] that's right
[1:17:16] the Common People the low ranked people
[1:17:20] who are the escorts of Norman who are
[1:17:24] just normal people
[1:17:25] they are the women who convinced him
[1:17:29] they're the ones who quoted for him they
[1:17:32] said if a prophet
[1:17:34] they even mentioned if a prophet maybe
[1:17:37] he never regarded him as a prophet but
[1:17:40] they men should understand if a prophet
[1:17:42] tells you something can't you do it sir
[1:17:45] maybe maybe we can sir
[1:17:49] I tell you
[1:17:51] they convinced him
[1:17:53] until he came to the eye
[1:17:58] so
[1:17:59] never question
[1:18:02] when God tells you to do something
[1:18:05] never fume never member never question
[1:18:10] never give why and how
[1:18:15] no just do it
[1:18:18] be obedient
[1:18:20] amazing
[1:18:22] then
[1:18:24] this poor man of God
[1:18:26] what he did he humbled himself
[1:18:31] and he says
[1:18:32] now what do we do I think now this was
[1:18:36] became the Consultants
[1:18:38] the community people became consultant
[1:18:40] so what should we do they said let's go
[1:18:43] how many times you do we deep
[1:18:45] seven what about you too
[1:18:51] will be enough
[1:18:54] because it was a fearing Jordan
[1:18:56] it's because it was comparing
[1:18:59] remember he said that we have Urban
[1:19:01] river which is so good decorated
[1:19:05] with a lot of things very beautiful
[1:19:09] It's Not Like Jordan
[1:19:11] so he was fearing
[1:19:13] you see we were not given a spiritual
[1:19:16] fear
[1:19:18] so he was fearing and comparing things
[1:19:23] but they kept on convincing him
[1:19:27] sir
[1:19:28] go
[1:19:30] all right let me go
[1:19:32] then dope
[1:19:34] then he started
[1:19:37] no
[1:19:38] you have not fulfilled
[1:19:43] ah enough they said if you will reach
[1:19:47] seven times oh we tell you a fun day we
[1:19:51] tell you sir we tell you all honorable
[1:19:54] it will be good
[1:19:56] they confess they convinced him
[1:19:59] and when he did 70 times
[1:20:02] a quick reward came on him
[1:20:06] [Applause]
[1:20:08] he received a new body
[1:20:11] Hallelujah
[1:20:16] keep on
[1:20:18] keep on dipping
[1:20:21] believers
[1:20:22] keep on dipping
[1:20:24] keep on dipping in Jordan
