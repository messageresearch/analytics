we're also thankful that you take people that aren't perfect to use for your glory and Lord if we feel like we're not qualified or not capable or have no special abilities we're still part of your program because we can pray thank you Lord Jesus the greatest thing that any believer the greatest opportunity the most powerful thing the only thing you could never do too much of is commune with you in prayer Lord we pray that you'll bless your bride here gathered this morning and touch my body Lord Jesus we pray as we Minister your word and we give you the glory and the honor for it in your name we pray amen amen God bless you all the musicians and amen welcome it's wonderful to be here in his presence God welcome brother Lauren and sister Sheila back we they were doing some driving amen just God's protection with them amen also we thank you for the the ones that are responsible or did the hall make it look nice and pretty and God bless you amen you know it's a body Ministry everybody has a part everybody has a part and you know sister Leah special was beautiful because God's not looking at it being perfect God's looking at the love that it took to come up and worship him and the ability that God's gave her amen and anybody can do that you know I I went and got my phone because I had a picture I might show you and in uh but you know just you just wait on the leading of God I might show it on a Wednesday tonight but brother brandham is preaching in his service and he has about 25 or 20 young people playing around the foot of the pulpit you didn't think your Prophet would do that but I have a picture of it and the picture is blurred because the children are moving their arms see God loves children God loves children and the prophet Propet love children you know we're watching on Wednesday night you know if you miss Wednesday and if you have to miss it it's okay but if you don't have to you really miss the move of God cuz some of our best services are on Wednesday and uh we listen to a tape very we did something different we listened to a tape of brother Donnie Reagan preaching and we're going to finish it this Sunday and I know what that tape's going to say but almost half of the tape the prophet changes the service even cancel service because of the children amen amen that's how God spoke to him and his whole Ministry was circled around the children amen let's just go to uh John 1 1 1-5 amen I pray that God will bless you this morning just got covet your prayers I been dealing with a bit of an earache for two or 3 weeks and I went to the doctor and they never had no ear drops that the doctor ordered to give me in Ontario or maybe wherever but God is an awesome God and also we cover your prayers coming up soon we'll be going to El Salvador and the trip and and just we we covet your prayers because we're not going in the flesh we're going by the leading of God and just that God will do what he wants to do amen amen I want to I want to preach on judging God judging God this morning in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him now I want to just stop there for a second just I know you're standing but let's just comprehend this that everything good and bad in this Earth was made by God all things were made by God and without him was not anything made that was made now that means that he made the things that you don't like Amen in him was life and and the life was the light now we know that any living creature is how they can do xrays because you have light in your body if you're alive so the Bible is just so perfect amen and the light is the life of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended us not let's just jump to verse 12 but as many as received him gave he power to become sons of God now that could be people that you don't like even them that believeth on his name and this is verse 13 shows it here which were not born not of the blood nor of the will of religious men of the flesh nor of the will of man but of the will of God lord Jesus we pray that you will Minister what you've laid on my heart and and Lord may you be with the speaker and the hearer and may nothing be spoken that that isn't in part of your plan predestinated plan Lord God and we love you and we're only here to fulfill what you've already seen before the found foundation of the world and we give you the glory for it in your name amen you may have your seats this morning you know brother Junior preached last Sunday and and I was tremendously blessed because uh tremendously blessed and he just touched I'm going to read later on a scripture that you touched on brother Junior's preaching in Kitchener this morning I believe and and uh but you know we as Believers sometimes well we're still human so we are disappointed appointed and and uh and we we find things that happen that disappoint us even through our understanding of the word now let me let me resay that now as Believers we have things that happen that disappoint us with our understanding of God now now I got hard Bible for this so you're in trouble now let me give you an example under what kind of a circumstances would Joshua send his deacons to a wh house that the will of God would be fulfilled now your Prophet said that when Jesus had an appointed time with the woman at the well that the disciples doubted that he was Jehovah because he spoke and he had to have discernment and if he really knew who she was he would never be communicating and that proves that the disciples understanding of Jesus Christ was wrong and my understanding of Jesus Christ has been wrong many times and so has yours I'll just say it for you to help you out because see when somebody you know we get so religious and and I mean I mean say this but you know brother Bram said multiple times that we don't have a thought coming he said that about a dozen times and he also said that God don't need you to fill his plan in his kingdom now he does if you're surrendered to him but you see what I mean but see we it's brother Dale and God help you if you knew me when I was young but we get a religious spirit around us and when somebody makes a mistakes or God forbid even sins we are the first ones not to talk to them not to fellowship with avoid them and throw them out of the building and the Bible says this now watch let me just lay a foundation here he said but he said you see in the world so as it is in the church we're trying to build something that God don't need your help to build hello now I I I'm going to tell you something brother Dale is still struggling with this because the thing I love love the most I don't fully I can't hardly get my head around and that's predestination election because an election if you're God's you know let me just let me just dramatize this for you a bit can you comprehend the thief on the cross when he got up to heaven now come with me on is this all right come with me on if it ain't it's too bad for you you come with me on this journey the thief on the cross comes up there and they say hello how are you and he says and he said well how would I know that you're qualified to come into heaven now I I know I know the Lamb's Book of Life but just come with me and they said well tell me what the Seal's Revelation was and he said the Seal's who he said well tell me who baptized you in the water baptism they said what what water what well tell me what the Evangelist theme was that preached a powerful message and you came to the Altar and give your heart and got the baptism to what Holy Ghost and they say well you're at the wrong gate you're supposed to go to the gate down the road cuz that Thief didn't know one thing of what you hold dear not one single thing he didn't even know that Jesus was the Christ he just knew that he was being unworthily killed whoa what in the world are we going to do with that scripture he says God don't need your help to build his kingdom God just wanted you to preach a word and he'll do the building he's the architect and he's got the plans all laid out now that the oness union is 58 now let's just read our text scripture here now Romans 9:19 and God you know God brings messages like this and when I found this scripture in a very peculiar way and it just exploded in my face here's God saying to us thou say then unto me why does he still find fault why do you as message Believers find fault with the plan of God now now see and I can answer that because we're disappointed that somebody backslid made a mistake was a woman at the well was and and and and I understand those disappointments because you know because of the pride and shame in our family we want our kids to be all angels and millionaires we say oh there goes my kids look at them they're successful they're sting on the front Ru on church and they all got but maybe God's plan was to make them be losers God's plan okay let let's go to verse 20 now now here this is God speaking now he's speaking through Paul here that wrote Romans n but oh man Thou Art Thou that repliest against God God's election now I'm talking about replying against God's election s the things formed say unto God the person that formed it why hast Thou made my kids a failure why have you made my church a failure why have you made anything in your opinion the things formed say unto him say unto God that formed it why hast Thou made me like I am why did God make me fat short and have a baked mouth the Bible is saying the Believers who could get by any thought add one cubic to your statue now verse 21 hasth not the Potter power over his creation the clay and of some lumps he makes a vessel of Glory Hallelujah and another Of Dishonor now I tell you what you don't know who the dishonor is until you get there because if you would have been following the thief's life on on the cross I imagine he was more than a thief he probably did some lying he probably did some other you know like that kind of attracts a certain group of people and so if you would have been following his life and you had missed the one day that his judgment came you would have said well he's in hell and you were disbelieving God's plan you were judging God now watch this verse 23 and he that might make known The Riches of his glory to the on the vessels of Mercy Amazing Grace Grace is oh amazing which he had aord prepared unto Glory even you us me whom he has called not of just the Jews only that was his Lage is is is Earthly but also the Gentiles as he saith also in is Hosea I will call my people which were not good people not my people and her beloved which was not beloved how can we judge God you know see we're here to we're here because we're come from God and we'll prove in our life that there will be one the second bride will never fall but you might fall down your whole life until your last day until your last day what did Paul say the greatest messenger in the New Testament I fall I Die daily he may he had he had The Thorn In the Flesh amen watch this verse 29 and we'll move on from the scripture and as I Isaiah said before except the lord of the Sabbath had left us a seed you had have been as Sodom and had have been like onto gamorra and you know in our fleshly vessel it is so itches is human nature to have an opinion and to have an opinion is to judge because you can say well God I mean as a minister or you as people you say well God I mean like you have to understand that like God how come the church ain't full we got the truth God how come the church starts how come do we go how come how come how come DS the pastor how come how come we have church at 10 how come think of whatever your how come is let's just read the scripture in a Hosea 2:23 it says and I God will so sow her unto me and the Earth he's meaning like planter and I will have mercy upon her that hasth not attain mercy so here God saying in his word of God that the last person you believe that'll be in heaven will be there the very dead Li he say I know he was he was he was no good he or she was no good and God says right here in Hosea he said I will have mercy upon her that hath not obtained Mercy see you know who they didn't obtain Mercy from was the Believers but God stepped over brother Dale and said I still love them and I said I don't like that oh I know you've said the same thing come on help me out well it wouldn't be in the word of God Paul wouldn't have put it in there why are you judging God because see this game ain't over until it's over amen and watch this and I will say unto them which were not my people that means they didn't attend church they were not in the family of God you thought God says that were not my people Thou Art my people and they shall say that thou art my God wow why do we be in God's creation see I can answer that because you're an amateure God and you you know H how do young people you know when they're invisible and they're 14 think they can walk in front of trains and semis and it won't hurt them because they're they feel like they they've never felt pain they they they're they're very unwise and they feel like they're invisible ible Invincible or whatever the word is but us with the baptism of the Holy Ghost understanding election and predestination can look at somebody that don't measure up to our Statute in what we understand of the word and think we're invisible and they're not God help us let's read a thought where he said this he said you ain't got no thought coming thought or think coming he said the Bible said let this mind be in you that was in Christ the mind that was in Christ being in you and he always did that which pleases the father because he was the word and so we know that that we have no thought coming and we must just believe what he says now I that's beautiful but you know we can read the we can I can read the scriptures and and and and and the message and show it and people say oh well he didn't mean that or well well what about the other now wait a minute like we we we got to set the absolute and then we'll abide by the absolute I'm giving you Bible I gave you message but we want to read a different a different message he said you say wait well I can't this is continuing this quote he says in investment 63 he said this person is you know how brother ministering says well I you say I can't explain it and this has got to be close to the best thing that ever happened to me he says no and if you could then you couldn't explain God you don't know God by being smart intellectual conception he said you know God by faith and it is the only way that you'll know how to believe God he said you can't explain God so all those preachers that are really smart well praise God I can still keep preaching watch how he explains this he said you can't explain God he said no one can amen wait a minute it watch this now no I'm still reading by the way he said it's not for you to explain he said no nobody can explain God and it's without finding out by expect expectation ex explaining it you got to believe him and if you wouldn't if it wouldn't be that way then there's no more faith now you've got to just believe that God has a predestinated elected plan and so you see we we and and and and I I'm not preaching that you can go sin and God will save you that ain't the case cuz if you do it willfully that's a uh you know it's just proven who you are iniquity is to to sin willfully and and do it but we're not judges you know that it's so easy for us to believe Paul was a greatest messenger of Grace but Paul was killing Christians and had the government back ping for it I wouldn't vote him in as my pastor and neither would have you let's just turn to Romans 8:28 and we're going to read just a few and this is where Junior picked up the the thought that was just so beautiful so what I'm trying to say is God is is omnipotent and he's God and we're his children now I'm going to read some quotes for multiple times multiple multiple times brother Braham says this you're God's children and let him take care of the children yeah not me not me because he knows what children are his and only God can deal with his own children he said Romans 8:28 and we're going to skip around here some I'll tell you where we're going he said and you know that all things work together for good to them that love God to him that is called according to his purpose now you mean all the ministers that left the message and quit preaching and all the people that aren't sit aren't maybe attending church right now that's that's that's that's good all the churches that fell apart because a godly man died and and and and Satan come in and divided them and that and that was part of God's plan that's hard for me to say but uh-huh yeah that was part of God's plan do I understand oh no way do I understand God no way I don't understand them I don't all things work together all the all the hardships in your life that were on Christian and on just was for your good and God allowed it what wow I say let's read on find out about this God verse 31 and what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who can be against us let's jump down to 33 and I'm not trying to skip any words I'm just trying to hit a a main point here and who shall lay anything to the charge of Gods elect I want to show you an example would that be okay the church message deacons brought a sister that was caught in the very Act of adultery and they said God the Bible says Giller I'm like I'm one of the deacons come on that's Bible help me preach you'd be one of the deacons too bless God that's unscriptural I love that Doctrine that's unscriptural and Jesus ignored them I said right in now now now wait let me just I felt felt something no I'm not condoning adultery oh no no I'm not condoning adultery no but I'm saying you can't get a gr your three PB brain if you're a genius can't comprehend the God I'm serving because if it could I have a different God and Jesus rose up and he said who that has not sinned in the past can kill uhhuh and Spirits don't die Spirits don't die and they were supernaturally pricked in their conscience and they left and Jesus said where are the Believers that were accusing you now you say how did you say they were believers they were Church going message Believers at that day does brother Bale fully comprehend that s i don't you going to go have to ask somebody a lot smarter than me am I condoning it absolutely not it would break my heart wow you say well this was a unique case well you know I feel sorry for you because I just showed you four unique cases let everything be established by two or three Witnesses see I'm just saying we I I know that in our day the Mysteries are revealed I am the seventh seal Christ is come down yeah yeah but I still can't comprehend everything and don't even pretend like it to me because if you can I don't want to fellowship with you ever wow I'm saying that you know you know and I never did it you know for one week on a regular basis maybe we'll do do it at the end God told me you need to have the people make a circle and pray for our gathering he told me that in the beginning of the week he told me that in the middle of the week because without Christ we'll eat each other because see we all had different parents and we all different things grilled into our conscience as children and you can't bring that forward and Minister that to me and and even if you bring Christ forward he's more than the word cuz the letter kth but the spirit giveth life but I'm not saying leave the word you see we're in a bit of a pickle let's go finish our verse here who has laid anything to the charge of God's elect is it God that justifies you know if we had the characteristic of our daddy our heavenly father wanted all of his children to succeed and we shouldn't be the one picking out who they are and who they aren't amen verse 34 who is he that condemneth well bless God the Bible says well bless God I found a quote who is that person wasn't it Christ that died or was it you yay rather wasn't it him that rose again and and who is even at the right hand of God which means Authority and power he is God and is also he's making the intercession for the ones that we don't think measure up to be a part of our click group wow so God's interceding for these examples I sent you and the Believers are bringing them to him he watch this he said you know here in a quote here he said Satan couldn't take him he said Satan couldn't drown Noah until the purpose of God was finished he couldn't burn the Hebrew children until the purpose of God was finished and he couldn't kill job with boils and troubles till the purpose of God was finished and neither can he kill Daniel with lions until the purpose of God was finished see there's a purpose you know what there's actually a purpose in sin there's a perp you want to know one of the purpose that God could be a savior there's a purpose in somebody being able to fall down can you imagine they could get redeemed again that's amazing grace and mercy he said neither could the D the lions eat Daniel until the purpose of God was finished and neither could death in old age take Abraham who was a liar until the purpose of God was finished I know you didn't like that but he actually was see you know when they wrote the the the theology or whatever you say the history of Abraham's life in the New Testament they never even mentioned you want you want to I I I was meditating on this you know Abraham was so uh an example of us when hard times came in Israel he left the church he left the message wait a minute Father Abraham left the message because the Israelites when they leave their home country are immediately out of the will of God and they had a famine they weren't seeing no gifts of the spirits in the church so he said I'm going to go over to the ones that are making them up so he left the message yeah and then he lied because he was afraid because he left the message amen and when God wrote the history about Abraham he forgot all that part and you remembering my past wow can you figure that God out and neither can it take the same quote and neither can it take you or can it take me until the purpose of God is finished in your life so I so we gather from there this Comfort why does God let troubles come in amongst us why would he do that would not God want a perfect family I mean let me read why does God let troubles come in God you want to know why God harnesses the trouble and puts a bits in its mouth I want to stop right there you can serve Satan all you want you're still going to bring glory to God if it's his purpose you go right ahead and Seed Wild Oats you're going to have a lot of days of sad days you're going to have a lot of days of crying you're going to have a lot of days of repentance like the Jews are going to when they recognize their Messiah they're going to whail and ferment and that look at look at look look at Joseph when the type of Christ when he revealed himself to the Brethren the Bible says the whole country heard them wailing and crying because they had recognized the mess up that they had willfully made he said God harnesses that trouble and he puts a bit in your mouth and makes you obey him and those trouble bring those troubles that are in our midst which there is not maybe they're unspoken troubles bring us closer to God wow I'm going to stop praying to be close to God come on cuz well nobody else put their hand up but if you pray to be closer to God the only way to get you there is to send troubles in your circle and you thought it was Satan and you thought it was Satan who can you imagine when God hit me with this brick I was just like whoa God wait wait a minute I have to investigate now I just tell you something there ain't no way in 10 million Worlds the brother Dale got this Revelation or this thought or this message by being smart or could I couldn't even imagine to make this up so you can take that for whatever it's worth but if you don't believe in God using people to show his will I feel sorry for you cuz I couldn't even pretend to figure this out why does God let troubles come in because he harnesses the troubles puts a bit in its mouth and makes it obey him and these troubles bring us closer into fellowship with god wow you mean all those nights sleep I was worrying about what God was allowing to happen and I was begging him not to let him do that I'm just gonna go to sleep you know let's go to questions and answers and I believe this was 64 he said here a sister asked brother brandom he said you know I was serving the devil and in sin for many years until I found the Lord this is the question and he said please brother brandom he said I've sinned again and I'm not worthy to even be in this your presence or in this church before you in this holy place please please please tell me if I could ever be restored whole again would anybody like to hear the answer to that he says yes yes yes you have not sinned my friend wait a minute wait a minute brother brandom if I do some sin wouldn't I know if IID done the sin hello he says you've not sinned my friend so far in God but that you would okay this was went different I thought so far in God that you could not be restored if you had sinned so far that you could not be restored you would never want to be restored he said see see but as long as there's something dealing with you in your heart there's a line of restoration there guilt of the least guilty of the whole I don't let me rephrase that that's in respects the persons in James and I love that I can preach that my whole life cuz I hate that I just detest people that lower people to make them feel higher that is the most disgusting low life you have ever seen I don't care where you came from and you're and the prophet will say this matter of fact thank you Lord thank you thank you Lord he said here's people testifying to brother Brown he said you know one of the main differences of brother Brown's Ministry can you imagine somebody born in the southern states of Kentucky picking up a no a black baby child that's crosseyed and say God heals your eyes because they're not supposed to like them do you know that brother Bram said is is that all right just quote brother do you know that brother I have the quote on my iPad here but take me a couple minutes to find it that brother Brown did not like black people did you know and God wouldn't give him the Holy Ghost until he sent him to a black church and that's where he got the baptism of the Holy Ghost so even your prophet in the beginning of his ministry was Prejudice and that's us say it's his own words I'm just quoting them and I can gladly give you the quote I'm standing On Solid Ground he said the greatest difference in brother bram's Ministry he said look here I tell you something this is Brother Brown talking he said I don't care if it's a negro child whether it's a Japanese child whether it's a Chinese child I don't care if it's a Korean child it's a person he said wherever God made a child there's no respects to persons God God's children period he said I don't care if they're in poverty below the line or above the line God made that job if you ever sit under a Ministry that shows respect because you're poor or you're wealthy or you came from another country run for your life cuz it's straight from hell that's right I don't care if he wears a nice suit whoa that's free guilty of the least is guilty of the whole he said this is Brother Bram now I'm back I'm reading now he said I brother Bram have sinned many times every day everyone of us do it that you don't want to do do things that you don't want to do he said it's it's in our hearts we don't want to do the way that or we don't want to ask this question he said see it's proof that God's still dealing with you he said you probably got nervous probably Satan was telling you watch just Satan coming in here see Satan's a great preacher he's a tenfold Ministry he's one of the top 10 he said Satan was telling you that you couldn't be restored and he's lying certainly he is because look if there's a deep calling to the Deep then there's got to be a deep to respond to the deep and if a hunger then something there has got to take away the hunger or there wouldn't be no hunger and he said as I've asked you lots of times before there was a fish fin in the back he said God made the water and before there was Earth he made the tree so the tree could grow and and now before there was a creation there was a creator that created the creation and see what I mean he said now as long as you're wanting and hungering to get back to God there's a God somewhere calling you to it see and you wouldn't be hungering for it now I know lots of people that are going straight it looks like it looks like in their physical Tabernacle they're going straight to hell but they have a conscience that when they're in my presence and they're used to cussing all the time oh oh oh the preacher's here so what made them do that it wasn't themselves they're very comfortable custom but when they recognize the presence of Christ oh yeah praise God did you catch it in you they go oh oh sisters here that's God that does it amen where did I lose my place he said now there's a place that you can cross the line that you can't get back when but when you get down to that shape he said it goes to show that you've only Fell From Grace sorry now there's a place that you can where you can't get back but when you that's is your there again the shame shape you was it goes to show that you've only Fell From Grace backsliding now I want to this is a climax of our message people that aren't living right are not lost backsliding is not lost I want someone to tell me somewhere in the Bible where backsliding is lost and I can prove it by the Bible a backslider is not lost they're just out of Fellowship watch what he says here Israel backslid all the time but they never lost their Covenant they lost their joy and their praise but they didn't lose their Covenant David lost his Joy of his salvation when he took biva uriah's wife but he never lost his salvation now those are some pretty bad things to do he never said David never said restore unto me the my salvation he said restore unto me the joy of the Salvation that I still have and oh there's so much legalistic legalism in the church today that's what we're preaching about judging God there's so much legalism I'm this is your Prophet saying this this is in questions and answer 62 he said there's so much legalism in the church today says that we say as Believers touch not taste not don't do those things and I didn't come to this church tonight illegally I'm tired I'm nervous amen God help us here's another example here David going out when Saul was chasing him now did Saul sin he disobeyed God he tried to kill God's anointed which to kill in your heart to plan to premeditate kill his murder whether you did it or not and here David would have David could have killed sa and here God led him right up David's an amazing character in The Bible an amazing character here David God LED David right up to his enemy that is is intentionally plotting to kill him multiple times and the man was D the man was after David's life and David's very own men said God has let him come into your life so you can kill him God has arranged it that the people that you don't agree with you can really give them a piece of this message so they'll never come to this church again and David said God forbid you know what the Bible says that an offended soul is harder to win back than a walled City there's a time to actually not there's a time actually to be silent you don't have to tell somebody something that's going you know it's going to offend them what what good is that going to do you never be able to witness to them again not even your life I got an example for you you want to hear an example some things are just beyond explanation Jerry did a job for a man and he said you know I want you to just come and do this job now this just this is fresh I didn't put this down in my iPad I didn't study this all week but I was out and the man said just go ahead and do this job now I have dealt with that man for 20 years yeah or longer maybe 25 now we've been married living where we are for almost 40 so when I say 25 I probably with for 35 years and Jared said well no I won't do the job I'll come by and I'll give you a price and then you can decide so Jared did that told him what he was going to do give him a price the guy said okay go ahead and do it Jared got all done and the guy said that was way too much money to spend on this this old P junk house and Jared said well maybe I agree with you but he said I got two questions for you did I give you a price before I start was it exactly this price yep yep yeah I did you tell me to go ahead yep and I was work in the field and I've been there 38 years and that man drove by me and he wouldn't look at me and I'm like sister Donna I'm like hello hello I did exactly what what the word of God say says and there will be people not look at me I did exactly what you told me to do exactly and you told me I did it whoa now you know sadly in the message this ain't meant to hurt this is meant to help us you know the house of God is a place where sometimes God if I would have preached In the Flesh which I did over a year two years ago what Donnie Reagan preached on the CDs you would have said brother Dale's leaving the message but because Donnie Reagan is welcome to preach in every Church in the world yeah you can go ahead and leave I'll just say you didn't like what Donnie Reagan preached but if I had have preached it word for word you would have said my pastor's off the word and sadly the people you would have told would have believed you you know why because I'm a child Minister and you know what God says about that if you're look for James 4 he says I hate it and it's sin and you're headed to Hell unless you repent he says you're guilty of everything that you think you're saved from because you would lift up status quo wow that hurts me too don't kid yourself you know see God is on partial and they're his children and we need to be very careful you I I I you know God's ministering this morning you know I went to denfield last Tuesday and I I had nothing better to do you could say I went with my brother well that's not the truth I was finding out the price of cows going to me to try to steal some cows from my brother and I'm not I'm not preaching I'm not wearing a suit God forbid I'm not wearing a tie I'm dressing the roughest dirtiest clothes you could ever see I went to a sale the other day and Jared said it looks like you came out of the popper thing hadman worh for maybe 20 years or something and I put it back in he so embarrassed me and I'm sitting there and onbon me there's another man over there that's 81 and he's ministering to homeless people up he lives in exor and he's talking to a Catholic which is a friend of mine and he said the Catholic he says see that man over there I see him looking at me really weird like he said you need to go sit beside that man and S talk to him he said he's a minister of God and you know what he said he was coming and he was asking about the mission field and all these things and he said I support people that do God's work do you have a charitable number was brother Dale looking for that you decide see God is God God could raise up the stones to worship him if you choose not to come to church God can use a donkey to minister to the five-fold ministry if you don't want to believe what God is and sometimes God comes across and such a that I just look at it I'm like what is now if that ain't it then you're not in fellowship with God because his ways are so much higher than our ways even if you're really holy his ways are so much and his thoughts are so much higher than brother Dale's thoughts that he'll go to people that are un blable and he'll bring them into the fold because he knows that before the foundation of the world and he knows that the things that they're doing ain't the real them we we struggle with that I do too I do too Junior help me a little bit we see something I say they're doing wrong be careful that could be God be careful there could be commit an adultery and you and you say that's wrong you say oh just leave it alone just leave it alone we don't know where Christ is tabernacled watch this and it hasn't come to manifestation yet yet is a key part yet if it had been brother Dale watch this watch this watch this just back up the cart if it had been the man hanging on the cross and I in I know you're sitting right beside me cuz I know some of you and I in the flesh would have said I would put the plug in the wall you know what I mean the electric chair but God that was him can you imagine and that's what's happened and that's one of the reasons where the smallest group there is you say oh bless God it's CU people don't believe the truth if you would just give them a chance if you would just give them a half anounce of a chance you know I know a minister and some of you sitting here and I'm not using names that when he lived a whole bunch of his children were serving Lucifer and so far two of them are the most amazing Believers that you have ever met and you have met in the world but he's dead and there's another one that's coming and yet if you would have judged them while he was still alive brother Brown said that lots of Grandma's prayer prayers are answered when Grandma you on bye-bye why are we judging God you said well no no no no there was this s oh listen I've got that t-shirt God you have no idea how God whipped me when I'm studying this I see exactly what you see I see imperfection I see people that are just off and I say oh that's nothing [Music] but here he says don't say nothing about Christians he said maybe he said don't say nothing about Christians maybe some of them don't live just right or do just right but that's God's child that's God's preparation 54 want to know 0401 paragraph uh 23 he said maybe they don't live right how can you be God's child not live right and they don't do right but that's God's child and let the father take care of his own kitties KD you know if we're fighting one another God's given us both a weapon oh I've got some of them God's given both of us a weapon and corrected him maybe God can help him well I've had a few of those weapons from trying to help god with his Kittles and I was justified by the Bible because they weren't living right and they weren't doing doing right and brother Brown said that God would give you a whoop wow God help us amen God help us J let spell smoke shut the fan off amen God help us here I I want to read this scripture again and read another quote and we're going to we're going to stop here Revelations 8:28 30 and 34 and I I know we already touched on some of this and and I I know but I want to just read again now we know all things work together for good the god that love God and to them that are called according to his purpose and to him he did Forno he also predestinated and to them and to be conformed to the image of the son that he might be the first born among many heathens moreover whom he did just shut the light off in there whom over he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called he's also Justified and whom he's Justified he's already so these people that are living the life wrong and not doing right in God's eyes they're already glorified and I and brother Bram saying here he said God didn't send me now I'm still sent to preach the word but he didn't send me to go around talking to those people and show them amen I can Minister out the word and God will Minister him through the word but in God's eyes the people that we're judging are already glorified and it could be the woman at the well could be Rahab it could be the woman caught in the very act and it could be saw massacring Christians and if any of those people walked in this church today if you're breathing you would have a feeling come over you like better be careful why can't we just treat them as equal you know if you know I I want to tell you the confession you know I used to have people that would invite me to the church and I would go and I just say you know I even different situations but we're on camera and I just say I say I'll go to your special you come to my special and they would never and I and I told some people I said you know if you got God as your protector and you're afraid to come here you ain't got a very strong God you know where I'm going with that just read between the Lins if you think you're right and I'm wrong and I'm not afraid to go to where you believe you're right but you're afraid to come where I'm wrong you're afraid of your own ability of God keeping you you see what I'm saying amen watch this I'm going to close with this this message unbelief now unbelief is sin you know why God couldn't condemn the woman woman for disbelieving the angel he's talking about Sarah Abraham's wife because she was a part of him and God don't want us going around condemning people that we don't know if they are a part of God because now you're punching God and I fear for my life so I ain't going to do that he said why God couldn't condemn the woman for disbelieving the angel do you believe that he said but he couldn't do it he said that's the way some of you church people go and you church people are acting why I've been kicked out of here so Lo why we have kicked out a long time ago but God couldn't do it why he couldn't kick Sarah out cuz she was a part of Abraham and so she so she was hirs with Abraham and he had he kicked out Sarah he would have been kicking out Abraham out too and so he couldn't do it on the account that they were one actually he says husband and wife on the account that she was his wife and he was the husband and so that's the way it is because Christ can't kick us out we're his sons and daughters and our unbelief and what's unbelief help me up sin our unbelief God can't kick us out now listen that that's heavy on you know I I challenge anyone of you who got message Shir look up onb belief I think it comes up oh it's a lot it's a really lot I was going to print off some pictures is that the way it is of with Christ he can't kick us out because we're sons and daughters and are on belief now hang on you've never heard this said don't mean nothing that's 61 Abraham and his seed after him if anybody wants to look it up who you mean I can just go out sinning he says our unbelief doesn't mean nothing real true Seed of Abraham will shine anyway there it is you couldn't stop the very next I I lied let me just so good he said you can't stop the program of God with your unbelief now I'll just tell you what you're going to have some troubles so if you're gods and you make the bad you're going to have to lie in it and so you can go ahead and do all these sewing Wild Oaks and have 50 different kids from different men and it ain't going to be me crying it's going to be you when none of them come and see you because you were a bad person but it don't take away the seed of election so you cry a lot what do you think Israel's going to do they crucified the Lord and the world will hear them F cry when they recognize what they're do and when you backslide you're still Gods he can't kick you out but when you come to repentance you're going to be a sorrowful sight crawling back on your knees like a worm he said so that's the way it is oh he said you can't stop the program of God with your unbelief John the Baptist said God is able for these stones to rise up children onto Abraham see God's word is spoken and it's got to come to pass oh my God help us in the face of uh just let me please read a couple of these in the face of all this doubt God go God goes right on proving his word to be right as he has in every age and unbelief doesn't stop God it does it doesn't hinder him I don't care how much the world unbeliev it it's still going to happen now I said I was going to read one and I read three God forgive me wow now brother Dale is not condoning sin but God's saying stop judging me stop judging me you know when Paul wrote this I want to just close with this in Romans 9 the 2 verse When Paul wrote this visy he said I have great heaviness and continuing sorrow of heart I'm going to interpret that and you can disagree it's because Paul knew when he wrote that nobody would believe or understand his message it's unbelievable it's unbelievable that there could be somebody in this world that ain't called in yet that in God's mind there already glorified and then the world they're so w sinning that's unbelievable that's that I want to sing have thy own way Lord you know brother Dale in no way is condoning that we can go out and sin and you can't sin without having repercussions of that sin but I'm saying this even though you sin it don't take the the seed away and God don't expect the other Harvest to condemn the seed that's coming late you know you know God God may bring in people in his Vineyard that's God's choice if he don't bring no more into this church it's it's completely up to God but if some of those people that are sitting with me at the sale and come over and talk and they walk in I don't need anybody here and neither does God need you to tell them anything absolutely nothing you know that man that come over and was ministering to the homeless I never told him about the Seven Seals I never told him about a prophet I never told him about election I never told him I did he's already attracted to me hello I'm not going to offend him with steak when he can't take that's right stop it stop it stop it stop during your Revelation nobody just keep it for yourself your Revelation you could die with your Revelation different mind that's between you and God work out your own salvation with fear and trembling just stop because those are God's kles amen God's KD all come to him at a different time in a different season and a different re ation thank you sisters for not and they're in a different spot and if they come in and they look different us don't say nothing just like God just like God just like God God is God you don't have no right to say God I don't like the people that are coming to this I just can't I don't think that they're qualified I that's Bible That's Bible be careful be very careful you know brothers and sisters you can fight against me or you can fight against somebody smaller than you or whatever but when you bring god Jehovah into the picture be very careful be very careful be very careful oh God help us have [Music] th the and the [Music] and and and my [Applause] way help us Lord why [Music] we ask him
