God bless you. We love you. We don't deserve you as friends, but but we're family. So, &gt;&gt; Amen. God is so good. We we did enjoy oursel in Burlington and and uh one of the brothers preached a message Saturday morning. They were they were all fantastic and just a wonderful fellowship. And you know, when somebody shows themselves friendly, Brother Bram said, "If you want friends, you have to show yourself friendly." Yeah, &gt;&gt; man. You want friends? Go be friendly with somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm going to fish in the brother's pond that preached there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh, wow. &gt;&gt; It was powerful. He read the scripture in Genesis about Eve being begiled by the serpent. And Jesus came to them and they knew they were naked. And they told God, they said, "We feared you." &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Who told you that?" &gt;&gt; Amen. I just Who told you you don't have no money? &gt;&gt; Who told you you're sick? &gt;&gt; Who told you you don't have your family saved? &gt;&gt; Who told you that? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Who told you that? &gt;&gt; Who told me you had problems? &gt;&gt; That's right. I I just about lost my mind when the brother was preaching. &gt;&gt; Who told you that? &gt;&gt; Who told me the world was falling apart? Who told you that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. Was really good. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's turn to Hebrews 12. Hebrews 12 verse 5 verse 5 and 6 maybe verse 7. Amen. We we do welcome you and we just are honored by your presence. Amen. It's it's God's presence that we come to be in amidst. Amen. And ye have begotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children. My son, despise not thou the chastisement of the Lord, nor faint thou at the rebuke of him. For whom the Lord lovest, he chastiseth, and scores every son whom he receiveth. And if ye endure chastisement, God dealeth with you as a son. For what son is he whom the father chastises not? Lord Jesus, we pray that you'll you'll reveal yourself to us more clearly and and show us your purpose and and your understanding and and all these things, Lord God. And Lord, I discount it a great privilege to stand before your bride. You're the ones that you purchased with your blood. you purchased, you've seen them in your mind before the foundation of the world, Lord God. And Lord, we're a servant to you, Lord God. And bless your bride. Bless us, Lord God, as you minister to us all this morning. In your name we pray. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. You know, we're living in a world where it's it's not falling apart. It has already fell apart. And many of us are in trials. and and and you know, you don't have to tell me about your trials. I know that cuz I'm in my own trials and and you you just can recognize it by the news and the the places that it's it's prophecy. It's in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Things are coming to an end in this world that as we've known it and and we're going to go in a rapture and a new place, but before we go, we're still here and God's elect are still here and and so we're under we're under this we feel this atmosphere around us. Amen. And we talked things are changing. Me my wife talked about it. It's changing the pressure even in the churches. It's changed and and the people and their thoughts and their minds is changing. &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you something that your testing time is coming to an end. &gt;&gt; And your angel is on the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your angel is on the way. You know, God don't God is not an abusive father and and God is only showing to the world and to yourself who you belong to. &gt;&gt; When God chastises us and and sends us in trials, when he gives us hard times, it's to prove that we won't run. &gt;&gt; We won't run from him when when there's no money in the bank. We won't we won't stop coming and serving God with our whole heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the one brother preached on who has your heart is who you serve. &gt;&gt; If you're worshiping your car this morning, I I feel really sorry for you if you get in an accident on the way home. But whoever has your heart &gt;&gt; is your God. &gt;&gt; If you love your school books more than God, it's you that got your heart. But whoever has your heart controls your being. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so when God has your heart and God has the heart of the elected because they come into this atmosphere that's prophesied and and many people we're going to look at through the Bible that come into this atmosphere, they never run from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they recognize that they were already sold out to God and he had their heart. And I I want to lay just a bit of a foundation and show you how many times in the Bible God talks about trying us. It's not because he don't love you. It you should lose your mind when you go through a hard time. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because it proves that you're God's. &gt;&gt; He's proven to Satan they won't run from me. &gt;&gt; He's proven to the devil &gt;&gt; no matter what I throw at him. What did he do with Job? He said, "I dare you to try him. &gt;&gt; I dare you. You can throw everything at him, but don't take his life." &gt;&gt; And Job's good friends and his wife and all them said, "Why don't you just cursed God and die?" &gt;&gt; He said, "You're talking like a foolish person. &gt;&gt; I'm already purchased by that God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I could no more curse the God the the God of my heart than I could curse myself. &gt;&gt; Oh, ain't he amazing. &gt;&gt; But I just, you know, and and the and the and the pressure and the things that different ones are going through. &gt;&gt; We're You're all going through something. &gt;&gt; I don't have to be a prophet to see your future to know that you have trials. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; But your angel &gt;&gt; is on the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, so many times we misinterpret who God is. And and we're going to get into that just a little bit. Brother Brown said that angels are ministering spirits to the church. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You think, "Well, I'm going to see a great minister come out and I'll recognize that's God." &gt;&gt; No, it's ministering spirits. &gt;&gt; God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; You know, when Paul I'm just way ahead of myself. When Paul was on the road to Damascus, a light came over him. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Lord, &gt;&gt; who are you? Who did he see? Did he see the flesh of Jesus?" No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did he see a good preacher? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Did he see the disciples or the apostles? That must have been who we see. &gt;&gt; No. How in the world? Paul was a Jew. H how did he recognize the Lord? &gt;&gt; There was no person. &gt;&gt; Don't get caught up in the Godhead as a person. &gt;&gt; It's a spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "I am Jesus." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who you persecute? And Jesus wasn't on the earth. Paul wasn't persecuting Jesus. &gt;&gt; But he had the right of the army, the government to go after the church. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; He was killing Jesus &gt;&gt; in the church. He could come in your home, take your life. Jesus. How did he recognize Jesus? &gt;&gt; My Lord, who art thou? &gt;&gt; Abraham. When God decided to go down and give Abraham the promise, &gt;&gt; it wasn't Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus hadn't come yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet said that God just made three bodies. Just said, "Whoop!" grabbed a couple angels. "Come on, angels." Whoop! Jump in that body. God jumped in the other body and he went down. And Abraham said, "My Lord." How do you recognize him? Wasn't the body. It wasn't the body. It didn't look like Jesus. The Bible said there is no beauty that he could would, you know, you would look upon him. It wasn't Jesus. He just he just cloop. &gt;&gt; He said, "My Lord." &gt;&gt; And when he went to Lot, he said, "My lords." &gt;&gt; How did they say that? &gt;&gt; It wasn't the wasn't the clay. &gt;&gt; It was the spirit. &gt;&gt; It was the spirit, the ministering spirit that Abraham recognized the presence of Jehovah. &gt;&gt; That's right. There was some supernatural nature &gt;&gt; that came into the place &gt;&gt; and he said, "My Lord &gt;&gt; and he ate some honey and he ate a calf or a lamb and poof, he was gone." &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah, &gt;&gt; my Lord &gt;&gt; ministering spirits here. I'm I'm sorry. I'm way ahead. James 1:24, he said, "Brethren, count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations, knowing that this, that the trying of your faith workketh patience, but let patience have their perfect work, that ye may be perfect and tired and wanting nothing." God don't plan on you living in a realm of temptations. You don't have any problems at all. &gt;&gt; You say, "But you, but you, who told you that?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who told you you weren't a child of God? Who told the prostitute at the well she wasn't a child of God? Who told Rahab she couldn't save her whole family when she was in the business? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who told you that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, there's just two spirits. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's Jehovah &gt;&gt; and it's one that's fighting against Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Who's the accuser of the brethren? &gt;&gt; Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. Count it all joy. See, when we recognize this pressure in the environment around us, we recognize that I am a child of God. I ain't no longer a slave to nobody &gt;&gt; cuz I'm already bought with the price. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I'm a child of God. &gt;&gt; Some of you don't know my story, but you're a child of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Oh, Brook Church, we need a revelation &gt;&gt; that you're a child of God. &gt;&gt; And when we're together, we'll be just saying, "I'm a child of God." Well, like my house fell down around. Well, I'm a child of God. Like, you know, &gt;&gt; I drove in the ditch and I was upside down, but I'm a child of God. Like, &gt;&gt; do you know the Bible says that Satan can't touch you &gt;&gt; unless God permits it? &gt;&gt; Do you know Satan couldn't touch Job until God said? God said, "You know what?" He said, "You can go this far." And Satan came back to God and he said, "Well, I couldn't get him to fall because you only let me go this far, but if you let me go farther, I'll do." And God said, "Okay, you can go this far." &gt;&gt; Cuz see, at first he said, "You can take all God, Job's wealth and all this other stuff, but you can't touch his life or his family or his house." And Satan said, "See, God, this is an unfair competition. You're protecting him. You got a hedge built around him." I want to just give Satan a notice. It's always an unfair competition because I read the end of the book and I am a child of God. I know who is the winner at the end. I know who's the winner at the beginning. And I know who's the winner at the beginning, at the end. And I know who's winning all the way through. &gt;&gt; But your temptation and your trial is just to prove to Satan that I am a child of God. He's my Lord and my King. &gt;&gt; It don't matter if I go home and hit a smack, hit a back track. Brother Cadre Digs was saying, he said, "When I get a funeral, you know, if I ever have to take a trip before any of you and before the rapture, man, don't nobody wear black. Wear purple and pink and and red and &gt;&gt; I want you to dance &gt;&gt; because I'll be dancing in heaven. I'll be dancing on my head. I'm no longer a slave. There's somebody that took the sting of death &gt;&gt; and the grave away. &gt;&gt; It was my Lord. He He took the keys from Satan. He said, "Hello, hand them over, brother." Not brother. Hand them over, dude. &gt;&gt; I'm no longer a slave to this life. Psalm 66:10 and 12. For thou, oh Lord, has proven us. There you go. And thou has tried us as silver is tried. Psalm 66:10 and 12. Thou has brought us into the net. Thou has laid afflictions upon our loins. Thou has caused men to ride over top of my head. Sounds pretty bad. And I even went through the fire and through the and went through the water. But thou but read all of it. But thou has brought us out with a healthy price. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm no longer a slave to what's to throw at me. It makes no difference. We It's about high time we give Satan a headache. &gt;&gt; Amen. And recognize that I'm a child. You can just pour it on, Satan. Take everything I have and make me sick. &gt;&gt; I'm a child of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Peter 1 6 and 7. There where wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, for ye are in heaven in are in heaviness, though the manifold temptations through manifold temptations, that the trials of your faith bringeth much precious than gold, though it be tried with fire, it might be found unto to praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ. You're waiting for the rapture. I'm going to just give you a news flash. You don't have to wait for the rapture. You don't even have to wait for the millennium &gt;&gt; for the appearing of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He appears to me daily. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's around me all the time. I never leave him behind me. &gt;&gt; I lay down with him. I rise up with him. I drive my truck with him or wherever I'm going because I am a child of God. The very spirit that he is is living inside of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The appearing of Jesus Christ is you mean I've come to this church so long and you didn't recognize the father. You know the des the brother came to Jesus and said we would see the father and it would make us happy. Jesus like I've been with you all this time. &gt;&gt; And and your eyes were closed every time I was around you. &gt;&gt; You didn't pick up that I am he. &gt;&gt; Did you ever pick up that you are he? &gt;&gt; You are. If you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you were elected before the foundation of the world, ye are he. Amen. &gt;&gt; The very spirit that he is, &gt;&gt; the very same mineral that's in the teaspoon of the ocean is the whole ocean. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I am a child of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. &gt;&gt; Here in Job, he said, "He has tried me and I shall come forth as gold." I want to show you a quote here. This is amazing. This This should make you just lose your mind. It's all right. I just give you another news flash. God ain't afraid of praise. &gt;&gt; You know, Cadre Dakes, he had to I'm thinking I'm going to get one. He had to print up a sign. Amen. &gt;&gt; I haven't got a wrote on there yet, but that means amen. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes you need coaxing. &gt;&gt; You know, we're in school. This is a news flash. Here's the cards. We're learning our ABC. Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; You want the stones to cry out? &gt;&gt; They're never going to have to cry out as long as I'm alive. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Watch what the prophet says here. And he that is in you. &gt;&gt; Did you get that? &gt;&gt; He that's in you. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you were looking for a great somebody. &gt;&gt; You should get a mirror. &gt;&gt; You're great. &gt;&gt; Are you great? &gt;&gt; It's no longer me that live, but Christ that liveth in me. Are you great? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a Christ. It's not me. I'm not alive no more. It's Christ that's living in me. I died years ago. Amen. Watch what the prophet says. Greater is he that's in you than that wheelchair you're sitting in. Greater is he that's in you than that stretcher you're laying on. Greater is he that's in you than the cancer that the doctors give a name. Greater is he that's in you than any of your afflictions. This is a quote, by the way. Greater is he that's in you than anything the devil could ever put on you. &gt;&gt; Glory. greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world. Greater is he &gt;&gt; you. Yes. &gt;&gt; See, he is in us. And that's Christ. He's He was our conquered every enemy for us. And then he was here on the earth and he conquered sin. He conquered sickness. He conquered death. conquer sickness, hell, death, and the grave &gt;&gt; and come to us and set us free of all these things. But there's some of you that are getting a news flash. You didn't know before today you were free. I'm no longer &gt;&gt; a slave to fear. &gt;&gt; Cuz greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He took all these. He conquered sickness, hell, death, and the grave and come to us to set us free of all these things. And greater is he that's in you than Satan that could buffet you o put buffets over you. Yes, he's greater. &gt;&gt; It's you. The Christ that's in you is greater to than you think. &gt;&gt; You're looking at your own ability. &gt;&gt; God ain't even looking at your own ability. &gt;&gt; Are you kidding? God is not even looking at your own ability. Do you know the amount of people in the scripture that fell down daily and God just never even recognized their failure? Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he looked at the spirit that was the election and the spirit that was tabernacled inside that that that mistake of clay. &gt;&gt; You're looking at my failure and my mistakes. Are you kidding? &gt;&gt; Have I been this long with you that you didn't recognize the father? &gt;&gt; Oh, you were looking at this body. Well, I just put it on once in a while, you know, when I need to walk around. Like I I put it on when I go to the bank so they don't get scared of ghosts. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You think I'm kidding? You know, when Peter was in prison, who came to him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You thought it was a person, but I'm sorry, you're mistaken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was not. It said a pillar of fire, a light, bright light, shined in the jail. &gt;&gt; It was the same pillar of fire that stopped Paul on the road to the Saul on the road to Damascus. And he said, "My Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, I want to just jump ahead because I'm back to this spirit going through the bank of the spirit. And when Peter got out of jail and he knocked on the door, the people were praying. They'd went to church and they were praying at Mark's house and he knocked on the door and the lady went and seen Peter and she went back and reported to the believers. Now Peter's at the door knocking and they said, "It's a ghost. &gt;&gt; They were message believers. &gt;&gt; It's a ghost. &gt;&gt; He's knocking to you this morning. &gt;&gt; You can you say my Lord or do you just see a ghost? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that the angel of the Lord came into Peter and what did the angel look like? Maybe I better give you a scripture for that. I skipped two or three examples, but we'll just go how God wants us to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What? Watch here. Maybe we just read this part. Oh, wow. Is it ever fun to preach this morning? I'm sure glad somebody showed up cuz I would have blew up if you hadn't come. &gt;&gt; Acts 121-17. Now watch what Peter's trial was. Now in the time of Herod the king, he had stretched forth his hand. Vax certain vax certain of the church. And he had killed a whole bunch of the message believers. He had killed James and John by the sword. And because he saw that it pleased the Jews. See, he was worried about his popularity. The king, you know, you got to watch those politics. They'll tell you anything to get their vote. &gt;&gt; Herod was killing the Christians to get the vote of the Jews. &gt;&gt; Did anybody see that he killed James? Go to the next verse. &gt;&gt; And because he saw it pleased the Jews, they were going to keep them as their king. Keep killing those Christians. I I like that politician. And they were at the church praying. In verse seven, if we go, actually, we better go ahead just to show you how time. So Herod had had planned a time to kill Peter. And because he was afraid of this spirit called God, he put four guards to guard him. He was already in the inner prison. And this is uh where are we at? Peter, he slept between two soldiers and he was bound by two chains and the keepers at the door of the prison. In verse 7, and behold, and behold, an angel of the Lord came unto him. And it was a beautiful looking man like me, and it was a light. &gt;&gt; It wasn't a person. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's right. You get hung up on people, man, you're going to you're going to have a hard time. &gt;&gt; God's trying to show you the truth. But, you know, don't get hung up on people. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Watch this. &gt;&gt; And the behold, an angel of the Lord came unto him, Peter. And a light shined in the prison. That was the person. The person that was an angel was God in the pillar of fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he smoked Peter on the side and said, "Rise up and rise up quickly." And his chains fell off him. And the angel saw said unto him, "Guard thyself and bind thy sandals." And so he did. And he said unto him, "Cast thy garment about thee and follow me." It still's not a man. It's the light. &gt;&gt; Don't get hung up on some man. &gt;&gt; We have one God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's a spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's called many different names. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's called Savior, Lord, King, &gt;&gt; Jehovah, Gyra, my provider. He's the the Elohim. &gt;&gt; And he's just changing his mask. He's just &gt;&gt; And if you fall in love with one mask, &gt;&gt; sorry, probably change tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, follow me. Amen. And he went and he followed him. And Peter wished not this verse n wished not that it was true that he had was done by the angel. And he thought he saw a vision. &gt;&gt; He thought he was dreaming. &gt;&gt; There's no way I don't see nobody. I can't. You know, people nowadays, they want to be able to touch everything. &gt;&gt; If they have a million dollars, they want to be able to touch it. They want &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You don't think so? &gt;&gt; That's why you see people that got a lot of money, they buy a hundred cars. They're worth 100,000 a piece. They want to be able to touch their money. &gt;&gt; Why would you do something stupid like that when they're just going to rust and rot out and devaluate? &gt;&gt; Y that's right. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Lay up your treasures where moth and rust this night comes and thieves and thieves and even if you're rich and thieves and thieves don't break through and steal. &gt;&gt; But we like to look at our wealth. That's why people along the river build a $5 million house. They're only worth three million, but they want to look at their money. &gt;&gt; And then their tax bill is 50,000 a year, but they get to look at it. &gt;&gt; And they got to hire five nannies to clean it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then be a slave to the bank because they didn't have that much money. &gt;&gt; And then when they inherit it to their kids, they lose it because they couldn't keep the upkeep. Do you know how many palaces around the world that people lose because they can't pay the property taxes and the cleaning bill? Hello. &gt;&gt; Dual Fairbank House in Betroy was one of those. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But God got something a lot more tangible. See, don't don't take your physical your your earthly experience over to your godly experience cuz God won't give you an idol to pet. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is my idol. He'll shatter that thing. He'll smash that little idle piece of wood. Do you know the prophet that put up the serpent in the wilderness that everybody looked at would be saved? He had to bring the next prophet to tear it down cuz they're like, &gt;&gt; "That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Worshiping things. &gt;&gt; God is not a thing. &gt;&gt; God is a spirit." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Peter thought he was in a vision. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's amazing. Verse 10. And he passed the first and second ward. They had him in the inner prison cuz remember Herod wanted to to have a big party. Do you know Christians can actually party? &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel so sorry for you. I feel so sorry for you. You know the God I serve is not boring like you guys. &gt;&gt; Do you know that the Bible says that every soul that gives their heart to God, they throw a party? &gt;&gt; They have all the pizza you could eat in heaven. &gt;&gt; The angels are losing their mind because one soul &gt;&gt; give their heart to God. We come to church and we're like, &gt;&gt; "Yeah, &gt;&gt; sure wish you'd shut up. &gt;&gt; Oh, this is so boring." You know, I can't I can't do this. What's this? What? You know, I can't do this and I can't do that and I got to go here and I can't go there and I can't eat this and I can't drink that, but I can't do that and I can't. Who told you that? I want I want to just give you a news flash that's really fresh. Do you know that everything God did had Satan copied? Do you know a man getting drunk is copying the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Lucifer is a loser and a copycat of the King Jehovah. And he's trying to give you an imitation. He's trying to give you an imitation. But you know when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost the next day you don't puke in the toilet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm no longer a slave to fear. God was the one that knew how to have a good time. &gt;&gt; And Satan copied it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God was the one that had worship the angels and the seraraphims at heaven saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty. Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty." And the whole earth, the foundation started moving and the post of tabernacles started waving like, "Holy, holy, holy." And then Elvis come out and said, "Oh." Came out with rock and roll. You thought that was the first rock and roll. &gt;&gt; God had his own rock and roll when the saraphims in heaven were moved the temple and the foundation of the thing saying, "Holy, holy, holy is Lord God Almighty." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir. Your prophet said that if you're quiet, you died &gt;&gt; and we'll have a funeral &gt;&gt; because pretty soon you'll be smelling. &gt;&gt; He said if your religion don't have any noise, bury it. &gt;&gt; Bury it. &gt;&gt; Because you're soon going to be stinking up the place &gt;&gt; cuz this religion makes a lot of noise. You never know when the Holy Spirit will come on me and I'll just lose my mind. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You never know if you pick up a high shaker. I could be driving down the road and I could just disappear and the truck could just drive off wherever. See, you should come to a point that every golden opportunity you get to witness that God is a spirit and you could disappear into a vision and the guy that you picked up, the hitchhiker, could be killed because he ain't in the vision yet. &gt;&gt; He might recognize that he's with a super being, a supernatural &gt;&gt; being &gt;&gt; called Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, as soon as the spirit, this light took Peter past his trial. Wow. &gt;&gt; Amazing. Verse 10. And they when they passed the first and the second word, and they came to the iron gate that leadth into the city, they opened unto him in one accord. Now, it never said the angel had to touch them or put the key in or or, you know, lay hands on it. &gt;&gt; They opened to him in one accord, and they went out and passed through the street. And forth with, are you got that up there? Right near the bottom, the last line. and forth with the light. The angel &gt;&gt; went woo. &gt;&gt; Cuz his trial was over. &gt;&gt; And then he went to the believers and they didn't believe what they were praying about that they believed that they believed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Woo! [Music] &gt;&gt; Watch what the prophet says in the angel of the Lord. He said, "Now angels have always been ministering spirits that are sent to the church." Is that right? And all through the apostles age and they were ministering angels that met the apostles and the disciples. Is that right? And they always appear to them in the form of light. For all you those people that are worshiping some person light, &gt;&gt; it always appeared to them. That's in the angel of the Lord. Amen. Is that right? It was light that shone down upon Paul that blinded him. Peter was in prison and the light shone in. The angel of the Lord told him the different places in the scripture referred to the pillar of fire was light. It was also the angel of the covenant that led Israel through the wilderness. It was light. What was that? And he ends it really perfectly there. It was Christ. &gt;&gt; Do you know Christ is not a being? &gt;&gt; You know Christ does not have a body. &gt;&gt; It's the anointed one. &gt;&gt; Christ is the anointed one. marriage and divorce. Now, we notice that Paul Paul was raised up. He said, "My Lord," I I guess I told you this one already, but this is where I got it from the prophet's message. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, now that boy being a Jew, he certainly wouldn't have called anything unless he had seen a symbol of God. And he would have never called it Lord." But he didn't see nothing. &gt;&gt; He just seen light. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it was the nature. Watch this. Let's just Oh man. Well, maybe we we got time. And Jesus said, "I go to the father and I came from God and I returned to God." And there he was back in the form of the pillar of fire again. And he said, "I am Jesus whom you persecute. It's hard for you to kick against the pricks." This Jesus is the name of God. This ain't a flesh being &gt;&gt; because Jesus wasn't even there at that time. &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's hard for you to kick against the prince. And I really And this is the same pillar of fire that came through the bars and opened the prison doors and took Peter out mysteriously. And watch what he says the next paragraph. And then you'll always know anything by its nature. That sounds about like our Sunday message about a month ago. You'll know God by its nature. &gt;&gt; There's things that God don't chase. God don't chase money. &gt;&gt; God don't chase popularity. &gt;&gt; God's not a Hollywood politician. &gt;&gt; God's not looking for votes. He's looking for hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. The nature and anything that is known by the nature, the fruit it bears. And I ask you to watch what kind of fruit it bears. And this is a light. This light which is God. Now do is it all right if we do believe this is the prophet, right? &gt;&gt; The nature and this light which is God. What? But but but God had no God's light. He's a spirit &gt;&gt; because he always goes back to the word and God proves it by the word and he preaches the word of God. God manifests it materially. So before you wow where am I in my notes? I think I skipped a few people. Wow. Praise God. Genesis 22 1 and 2. Here God with our father Abraham was tempting Abraham and it was a real temptation. It was what you're going through some of you right now. Make it personal. &gt;&gt; Share it with God. Say, "God, I feel like you're coming after to kill me. I feel like you're coming after to kill my family. &gt;&gt; Tell God, your angel's coming. &gt;&gt; 22 and 1. And it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham. That's kind of unique. Why did God do that? To prove to Satan who he was, not just to Satan, but even to himself. And he said unto him, Abraham, and he said, Behold, I am here. Verse two. And he said, "Take thy son, thy only son, Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee up to the lamb, and offer him up to a burnt sacrifice." I would have said, "Whoop! Wait a minute, God. You lost me right there. &gt;&gt; You lost me." &gt;&gt; You I just I checked out right there. That one verse was the time to leave the church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know why Abraham didn't check out? because he was already sold out. &gt;&gt; God already had his heart. &gt;&gt; He was just proven that he had his heart. &gt;&gt; Do you know how much Abraham loved his son Isaac? &gt;&gt; There was a miracle child. &gt;&gt; Come late in his days. &gt;&gt; He was going to carry the promise. Going to take on the ministry after Abraham had died. Are you kidding? I tell you what, he pulled all his hair. He said, "Good." I mean, he had more than one sleepless night. &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet said? I I I I'd like to just bump in here. I I got it in the quote. He said he he lost a few nights sleep. He was wondering, "What in the world am I going to tell Sarah?" &gt;&gt; Well, honey, I had this voice come to me and I just went up and I killed our family. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you did a hunt. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now verse 10." Now, I skipped a bunch here. Verse 10. And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took a knife to slay his son. I wouldn't have done that. God knows I couldn't take that so he wouldn't ask that out of me. &gt;&gt; But he might take your son in a car accident &gt;&gt; or a different way to &gt;&gt; you know you want to make sure you know that's another good reason when you come to church is to really worship God in the spirit &gt;&gt; because if you're too quiet, God might not be sure he's got your heart. So he might have to take your son &gt;&gt; or your daughter. &gt;&gt; Yeah. because he's like, "Well, they just come to church and they just sit around like &gt;&gt; and God's like, &gt;&gt; I wonder, Sister Joey, I wonder if he really loves me, the guy that sits here." Yeah. &gt;&gt; But I tell you, I guarantee you that if you come to church and you're like, &gt;&gt; in the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; I don't mean I mean in the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; God won't have to go, I wonder if he loves me. &gt;&gt; Because you're not concerned who's sitting beside you, what they're going to think or what your wife's going to think or what your kids are going to think that you're lost. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And And then God won't have to send you through &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; some tribes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, if God sees you starting to build the kingdom too much on earth, spending too much time to buy a Lamborghini and a big whatever that big something is, you might say, "I'm not sure. Yeah, &gt;&gt; maybe I'll just take all that from you &gt;&gt; to see what happens after I take it all from them. &gt;&gt; See if they'll still come to church when they have to hire a taxi &gt;&gt; or ride on the city bus. &gt;&gt; We might have to open a city bus in &gt;&gt; town. Am I watch this? So verse 10, he said, "He stretched forth his hand with the knife to kill his son. And the angel of the Lord, called to him out of heaven &gt;&gt; and said,"Abraham, Abraham." He said, "Here I am." Did you think it was like a man that grabbed his hand? No. Sorry. He said, "Lay not thy hand upon the lad, but rather do anything to him to him. For now I knowest that I have thy heart and seeest that thou dost not withhold thy son for thine only son &gt;&gt; from me." &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, I believe that Abraham could have sidestepped this trial from God. Yeah, I do. &gt;&gt; If he hadn't put so much emphasis, oh, honey, change his diaper. Change it fast. Did you wash his clothes three times today? Put a mask on them. We don't want nothing to hurt this little prize. Don't let the dog near him. Don't let him lick a cat. He might get leprosy. He might get fleas. &gt;&gt; You don't think Abraham took care of his boy Isaac &gt;&gt; with super precaution measures? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You don't think he put him in the inner part of the tent and he slept in the doorway to protect them from all harm? Yeah. &gt;&gt; You think he let him play around cliffs and mountains unguarded? &gt;&gt; No. He worshiped that little boy. &gt;&gt; All my hope is in this little boy that was promised by God &gt;&gt; because he said, "Your seed will be as the sands of the earth and the stars of heaven." And it's all wrapped up &gt;&gt; in this little Isaac. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Be careful. &gt;&gt; Be careful. &gt;&gt; I'm just saying. I mean, if you &gt;&gt; can do the trial again if you want to. &gt;&gt; And Abraham's covenant be here. The prophet says he said Isaac put not put the hands behind. He's talking about Isaac. He's he was ready to to uh bind Isaac and to to sacrifice him because that's what God had told him to do. And Abraham lifted up the little lad and put him on the rocks. And here in the middle of this paragraph, maybe you might have to go up again, Vicki. He said, "Can you imagine him standing there trying his intelligence trying to go and work out what am I going to tell Sarah when I get back home?" &gt;&gt; Oh. Yeah, he was in a trial, &gt;&gt; but the little buzz kept saying, "I'm Jehovah. &gt;&gt; I am a child of God. I'm no longer afraid who gets voted in in Canada." Cuz I am a child of God. &gt;&gt; I don't care who gets voted in anywhere cuz I am a child of God. I don't care how many warships they put in the ocean till they run into each other with their lights shut off because I am a child of God. It doesn't matter to me when California falls to the ocean and the sharks come in and swing into the Salt Lake Sea because I am a child of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that little buzz kept saying I am Jehovah. I will provide. Just follow me. Just trust me. I &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And two things are working at the same time. What are you going to listen to? Who told you that? If you listen to this, you're gone. If you listen to that this, you can't go. You've got to be sure that it's perfect. &gt;&gt; You might as well say you got to be sure that it's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got another example and and uh we're going first Kings 19 1-8 here. The prophet Isaiah had a couple rainy days in his life. You know, he had a few days that he was out of food and water and a few days that he didn't have a lot of money in the bank account and a few days that it was kind of dry around where he lived. And Abel told Jezebel all that Elijah had done. Elijah had just killed all their prophets, the false prophets, butchered them. Now he had done that when the spirit of God was on him in a powerful way and he with all with all how he had slain all the prophets by the sword and Jezebel sent a messenger. Now you know Elijah when the spirit of God was on him, he was fearless. &gt;&gt; He took on the whole country. &gt;&gt; And then the wife of the country sent a messenger onto Elijah and said, "If I don't kill you like you killed all my prophets, let it happen to me what happened to the prophets." And Elijah got up and ran for his life. How did he do that? Because God was pulling back the spirit that was on him and he was seeing what Elijah would do. And Elijah went a day's journey into the wilderness and came underneath a juniper tree in verse n four. And he Elijah requested himself that he must die and said, "It is enough now, Lord. Take my life. I am no better than my father's. And as he laid and slept under the juniper tree, behold. Behold, your angel showed up. God is never late &gt;&gt; and he's never early. He's on time perfectly. He got Elijah right where he wanted him because he had more work for Elijah to do. Don't think, church, that your trial is the end of what God has in your life. &gt;&gt; That's nothing but a lie of the devil. &gt;&gt; He's got more for you to do. But he's just refining you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For what's to come ahead. And the angel of the Lord came and touched him and said unto him, "Arise and eat." And he looked, and behold, there was cake. Do you notice he never said there was a person standing there? &gt;&gt; They had a Sears from They had a stove from Sears or, you know, one of those stores, Temperaments or something. There was a baked strong white angel standing there cooking, flipping burgers and eggs and biscuits. No, no. So, sorry to to break your bubble, but God is a spirit &gt;&gt; and God can just speak and it will happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he arose and there was cake baked on the coals and cruise of water at his head and he did eat and drink and he laid down again. You don't think God could cook like that? How did he send mana to the wilderness for the children of Israel? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Did he have a big stove from temperaments there? &gt;&gt; A couple angels out with like six foot angels like flipping biscuits like heavenly mana. No, he just went &gt;&gt; and the mana rain down from heaven. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Like we think we're so smart because we come out with GPS and like controlled missiles and that God had controlled missile food like a long time ago. Like I just Elijah just laying under the mystery and he just sends him a controlled missile right beside his head that cruise of water. &gt;&gt; Wow. Verse seven. And the angel of the Lord came unto him again the second time. Where did he go? He appeared again. And he touched him and said unto him, "Arise and eat." Because thy journey is great for thee. God is telling you after this trial that you're going through, your journey is going to be great. Just hang in there. Your angel's on the way. He's going to rebuild your strength. Amen. &gt;&gt; For the journey is great for thee. And he arose and did eat and drink. And he went on the strengths of that meat for 40 days and 40 nights. Wow. God had big plans for Elijah. And Elijah wanted to end them all by taking his life. &gt;&gt; God said, "No, no, no, no, no. I sent an angel here. And what do dost thou hear? The prophet said, he said, God sent his angel. The angel touched him and he went to sleep. Then he woke him up and there were some corn cakes there and some kind of cakes baked laying on the side of him and he said, "Elijah, rise up and eat." Now you maybe want to look at the bottom two lines of that. There's the grace of God to you, the elect, &gt;&gt; his bride. There's the elect of God to you, the servants of God. &gt;&gt; See, God was resting him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. Just one more one more scripture and we're going to close. Matthew 4 1-11 and we'll try to wrap this up here quick by God's grace. I I trust you're getting this. &gt;&gt; We're all going through pressure, &gt;&gt; but your angel is on the way. &gt;&gt; God, you know, the Bible says that he'll never give you more than you can take. &gt;&gt; God knows exactly how to mold the clay. &gt;&gt; He's the master and I'm the clay. Mold me and make me. And that that spitting, God, oh that hurts. Needs like making a lid on the boat. Oh, God knows exactly how far that clay will roll out &gt;&gt; to make the lip. What about the lips that have a safety edge and they roll back underneath like that? Oh, &gt;&gt; he knows exactly how far he can bend it before it breaks. And you feel like you're in the fire cuz he's refining you. But then he's going to sit you right up there. Said, "That's me. &gt;&gt; What they are is me." All that I am, he poured into Christ. And all that he poured into Christ, the anointed one, he poured into you. &gt;&gt; He poured it into you. And he said, "World, Satan, you want to see me?" He said, "You want to see me? You haven't been to the Wyoming church. &gt;&gt; Why? I'll give you the address." &gt;&gt; You think I'm losing my mind? &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "The deity don't dwell in heaven alone." No. &gt;&gt; Oh, you were looking for the return of Jesus like again or something. No, Jesus won't touch the earth because it's not cleansed yet. So when he comes in the rapture, he's going to be we're going to go to meet him. So the ones that Jesus is on the earth now is Jesus &gt;&gt; cuz deity is walking around. Deity deity had a shower this morning. Picked a pink shirt. deity. &gt;&gt; You think my God wouldn't do that &gt;&gt; in the prophet's time. He Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I forgot to ask you what color of eyes you want in a socket that never had a ball. &gt;&gt; God didn't want to give the little girl an eye that she wasn't pleased with. &gt;&gt; Hello. Hello. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Now, I know this is going to maybe I'm going to bring this as general as I can, but it's 100% the truth. And we're just reading right out of Matthew 4:1. Do you know that Satan can't tempt God? But Jesus was tempted in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Well, you thought the flesh of God was Jesus was God. But how would Satan have enough power to tempt God? Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Hello. God can't tempt the spirit of Elohim. &gt;&gt; He is the self. He was the selfexisting one &gt;&gt; before there was anything there was him. Do you know that the very Jehovah, this self-existing one, created that little peepy little devil that you worry about? That little mouse. &gt;&gt; Do you know that hell was created for Satan and his angels, &gt;&gt; not for people? &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, wow. This Bible is amazing. when God sent an angel in our day that took the seals off the Bible and revealed the mysteries that we could just understand so clearly. And then this Jesus was led up of the spirit. See, Christ is the anointed one. God is a spirit. So here's God leading up his flesh son to the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. Now, if you think I'm going out on a limb with this and you think, "Well, yes, I know Jesus Christ. That's the name of God. That's a spirit." And why God can't die as a spirit. So, he had to make a body to die for him. Because you can't nail spirits onto a cross because that'd be like nailing a ghost to a cross. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the prophet said, "The spirit of God left Jesus when he died and took the sins of the world because God can't become sin." &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you think that the flesh body of Jesus is Jehovah, the flesh, it was when God was tabernacled in him. But as soon as he changed the mask, it was over. Because when Jesus was in that, God said he was a triune being. And Jesus himself went before he was going to die for God and he said, "God, change your mind." &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; He prayed at the world in the before the garden. He said, "God, change your mind. I can't take this no more." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; the bot was huge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it showed that God had his heart. You know what the Bible says that that he speaketh to the heart what you know what the Bible says this it says whatever's in the heart will come forth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What you are in the heart will come forth. And Jesus said those amazing words. He said nevertheless. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was his heart speaking. That was not his brain speaking. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless, not my will but thine be done Lord God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And here we see in the second verse, and he went the 40 days and 40 nights, and he fasted. And then the tempter came unto him, and he said, If thou be the son of God, command these stones to be made into bread." And he answered and said, "It is written, man shall not live &gt;&gt; by bread alone, by by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God." &gt;&gt; You see how perfectly Jesus is speaking here. &gt;&gt; You know, when God was using Christ Jesus, he was the fullness of the bod godhead bodily. But when he was done with that body, it rotted just like my grandpa's. &gt;&gt; Because he took another mask &gt;&gt; and even Jesus said, "Every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God." And the devil taking them up and set him in the temple, and he said, "If thou be the son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written that he will give his angels charge over thee. For their hands they shall bear thee up, lest the time they dash thy foot against a stone. And Jesus said unto him, it is raining again. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. See, Jesus wouldn't tempt God. That's why Jesus wasn't a showmanship. That's when Jesus went to the pool and he healed one person stepping over dead people, sick people, I mean. And he was doing exactly what the father showed him. I do nothing except the father show me. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now if you believe Jesus is the father, then why did he have to have the father to show him? &gt;&gt; It's a spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto him, it's okay. Let's go to the and verse eight. And the devil takes them up into exceeding high mountain and shows them all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of the world. Now I just want to I want to just step in here. The prophet said the Bible says lay up your treasures where moth and rust. Don't put too much hope on this earth &gt;&gt; because it is Satan's right. It's Satan's until we go in the rapture &gt;&gt; and get to the millennium and God burns this earth over. &gt;&gt; Every kingdom of the world. &gt;&gt; Everyone, even the nice ones that I want to move to are controlled by Lucifer. &gt;&gt; Every government &gt;&gt; that's king over their property, &gt;&gt; their boss is Lucifer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just so you understand that perfectly. &gt;&gt; Taking him out to see and showed him the world and all the glory of all the kingdom. And he said, "And he saith unto him, all these shall I give thee." Whoa, wait a minute. Wait a minute. How could Satan said I give them? He owns them. I'll give thee if thou will fall down and worship me. That's why Christians don't build a kingdom on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because where your heart is, you would be worshiping the kingdom and that would be Satan's. So don't get too much tied up in brick and mortar and you know copper and gold and brass signals. Just use them for their purpose and then say, "Well, like Satan, you can have all them when I'm gone. Hope you enjoy my truck. It's pretty cool. &gt;&gt; I'll have a better one in heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll be just and I'll be there. And Jesus said unto him, "Get thee, hence, Satan, for it is written that thou shalt worship the Lord thy God." Why didn't Jesus say that? "Get thee, hence, Satan, that thou shalt worship me &gt;&gt; because I do nothing until the father shows me." That's right. &gt;&gt; God is a spirit. &gt;&gt; And yes, Jesus had the fullness of the Godhead bodily, but God was testing the badger skin. &gt;&gt; He was testing the badger skin cuz that badger skin was going to hang on a cross and represent God to take the sins of the world. Hallelujah. and him only shalt thou serve. And the devil leaveth him. And behold, angels. Angels. Does Jehovah need angels to strengthen him? See, if God can be strengthened, then that means he got weakened. I'm pushing your limits. God don't get weakened. So he don't need strengthen. And angels came and ministered unto him. &gt;&gt; You know who they were ministering onto? The flesh. &gt;&gt; Because the flesh had fasted for 40 days in the wilderness and went through a great trial with Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he was ministering onto the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God don't need ministered onto. God needs worship. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We worship God. We don't minister to God. God don't need to hear this message. God is the message. The message we believe the prophet brought, it's not from a man. It's God. It is God. It is everything. The word is God. &gt;&gt; How can you tell God, "Well, this is what your word says." He already He is it. &gt;&gt; I am it. He just needs worse. Our last scripture, Lamentations 3, and I'm closing. You can actually come, honey. Lamentations 3:22 and 26. And it is the Lord's mercy that we are not consumed because his passions, compassions fail not. They are new every morning. Great is thy faithfulness. The Lord is my portion, saith my soul. Therefore I will hope in the Lord. The Lord is good unto them that waiteth upon him to the soul that seeketh God. And it is good that man shall both hope and quick quite quickly wait for the salvation of the Lord. I want to just close with this thought. When your trial is over and God knows you're at your limit. He'll send you an angel. &gt;&gt; He'll send you an angel because God's no respector of persons &gt;&gt; just like he sent an angel to all those examples in the Bible. He'll just go whoop. I want to just I want to just drop this in here for one second for all you parents that maybe have unsaved loved ones that and those examples if you didn't pick it up is they were not all believers. Saul was butchering the church but Saul was elected. &gt;&gt; Did anybody hear me? &gt;&gt; Saul was elected. So if you have an unsaved loved one that's out there and you don't think God can send an angel to grab that person, &gt;&gt; if he was predestinated in the mind of God before the foundation of the world, he might be butchering your character and butchering Christ's atmosphere and butchering all those things. And God will set the pillar of fire &gt;&gt; and strike them blind. And somehow in sin he'll say my lord &gt;&gt; because he was elected. &gt;&gt; That's amazing grace. &gt;&gt; An angel of light coming to the church is grace. &gt;&gt; It's grace. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you sister. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord. Wow, man. You were hunkked this morning cuz I could I was really able to preach. Thank you, Jesus. Oh, wow. Let's worship him. Thank you, Lord. Glory. Oh my amazing. Hallelujah. When you're that you're with sin, say, "Lord, I can't take it." Hallelujah. says, "Hang on." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My angel's coming. &gt;&gt; Travel at the speed of light. Amen. From my mother's womb, you have chosen me. Love has called my name. I've been born again into the family. Your blood throws through my veins. I'm no longer slave to fear. I am a child of God. Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] You [Music] surround me [Applause] [Music] from my enemies to all Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] [Music] You have chosen me. [Music] [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Applause] You made the sea. Oh, I my [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] I am God. Hallelujah. Amen. I want to sing that song till the storm passes by. But when she's pulling this storm up, I want to share this with you. Do you know there can only be fear on your outer body? &gt;&gt; It's not possible to have fear on the Holy Ghost. You know the Bible says not to fear those that could kill the body &gt;&gt; but that could take God from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the fear is this body. &gt;&gt; This body is going to pass away. &gt;&gt; This body was created to pass away. &gt;&gt; And so when you're a triune being you know our prophet told us this and I I I'm close. He said God chose the soul but God took the heart or Satan took the mind. &gt;&gt; And so when when you asked yourself who told you that if it's fear it's Satan talking &gt;&gt; God will never speak in fear down here. &gt;&gt; As a man thinkketh in his heart so easy is he &gt;&gt; man we need to think with your heart. &gt;&gt; As a man thinkketh in his heart. I don't even what's fear? I I don't understand fear. I'm like a child that walks in front of a semi. I can play on the road every day. Cuz fear, &gt;&gt; who's fear? &gt;&gt; I'm going tell you, God. But Satan, when you start listening to Satan, he comes up here and he goes, "Oh, you might get hurt." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If you if you hang around that Dale person, you might get hurt. &gt;&gt; If you hang around those holy rollers, they might they might they might get blessed. You might get drunk in the spirit. You might you might get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and cry in public. Can you believe that? That'd be so embarrassing. &gt;&gt; You you might be asked to sing a special and made a wrong turn or or re do a testimony. That's Satan. That's it right here. That's it. But God will never tell you that. He said, "That's my child. They're out there worshiping me. They're saying a testimony of how good I am. &gt;&gt; That's my child. as you think in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the next time you get the least little bit of fear like I don't know how I can make it through the day. Remember it's this person cuz just God will never tell you I don't know how you're going to make it through the day. &gt;&gt; I don't know how I'm going to pay my bills the first of the month. The first of the month coming up tomorrow. Oh, how are we going to make the bread? Remember, remember that's Satan. &gt;&gt; That's Satan. God already paid your bill. &gt;&gt; Where he wants you to live, he already paid it. &gt;&gt; He owns the cattle on 10,000 hills. &gt;&gt; He knows where all the gold is in the world. &gt;&gt; He's got the key to the long street. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's like, oh man. Wow. Thank you Jesus. Wow. The the zone is just amazing. Thank you Lord Jesus. In the dark of the midnight I have in my face. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Yeah. Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Applause] [Music] A [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat.
