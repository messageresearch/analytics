[14:00] amen man sister Ruth has got special
[14:07] amen
[14:28] amen
[14:58] for
[15:04] alive when Jesus died on the cross
[15:08] everyone thought his life was over but
[15:13] three days after the
[15:16] crucifixion there was a great
[15:20] earthquake an angel came down from
[15:25] heaven and rolled aside the St
[15:29] from the entrance of the
[15:33] Tomb very early on Sunday morning some
[15:40] woman went to the tomb and they found it
[15:46] empty Jesus wasn't there they didn't
[15:51] know what had happened so an angel came
[15:56] to them saying do not
[15:59] be
[16:00] afraid
[16:03] go
[16:05] they go quickly and tell his disciples
[16:11] that Jesus is Alive and he will meet
[16:14] them
[16:16] soon the woman ran quickly from the tomb
[16:21] with great joy and
[16:24] excitement as they went Jesus met them
[16:29] and greeted
[16:31] them on their way Jesus met them the
[16:36] woman ran to
[16:39] Jesus and worshiped him he was
[16:44] alive then some of the
[16:48] dis the Jesus said do not be
[16:53] afraid go tell the disciples I will need
[16:58] them
[16:59] soon the woman shared the good news with
[17:04] the disciples but the story sounded like
[17:08] nonsense to them so they didn't believe
[17:13] it then some of the
[17:16] disciples ran to the
[17:19] tomb to see if this was true and they
[17:24] found an empty tomb just like the woman
[17:29] had
[17:30] said that same day two of Jesus's
[17:34] followers were walking to
[17:38] EMAs as they walked along they were
[17:42] talking about everything that had
[17:46] happened to
[17:48] Jesus and as they talked Jesus himself
[17:53] suddenly came and
[17:57] began
[18:00] with them but they did not recognize him
[18:06] when they arrived they sat down to eat
[18:11] when Jesus Took the bread and blessed
[18:15] it they they
[18:18] recognized him but at that moment Jesus
[18:24] disappeared these men went to the other
[18:27] disciples
[18:29] and told them what had happened and just
[18:33] as they were telling about it Jesus
[18:39] himly standing there among
[18:47] them peace be with you he said the whole
[18:52] group was
[18:55] astonished why are you afraid Jesus
[18:58] asked
[18:59] look at my hand look at my feet you can
[19:04] see that it's really me everyone was
[19:07] filled with joy and
[19:10] Wonder Jesus said it was written long
[19:14] ago that the Messiah would suffer and

[52:01] Sal
[52:03] on
[52:08] C
[52:12] tree amen thank you musicians I sure
[52:16] appreciate
[52:19] that well if you don't know who I am my
[52:22] name is Kyle Wert I live down in the
[52:25] states little little farther south from
[52:27] here down in Ohio and I'm happy to have
[52:30] my wife and two little girls well one
[52:33] little one's getting kind of big yeah
[52:35] she's growing pretty fast but uh
[52:38] there're still little girls to me always
[52:41] and so I'm really happy to have them
[52:42] with me sometimes they don't get the
[52:44] opportunity to go with me and uh I was
[52:47] happy happy that they can be here and so
[52:50] always makes me feel good and uh just
[52:53] wanted to say I sure appreciate for the
[52:55] Carson Shan for hosting me last night
[52:58] they fed me like a king so if I'm a
[53:00] little lethargic today it's because my
[53:02] body is still digesting all the food
[53:04] from last night so I really appreciated
[53:06] your hospitality in the food and brother
[53:09] Dale and his wife got chance to have our
[53:10] first time of fellowshipping last night
[53:12] and I found him to be just a genuinely
[53:15] sweet loving brother instantly like he
[53:17] said you know witness with one another
[53:20] that we came from God we came from God
[53:22] and we're just sojourning in a land
[53:24] that's not our home remember I'm not an
[53:26] American so you don't have anything
[53:27] against me uh we're from the same place
[53:30] it's called heaven and um I know you
[53:33] don't identify as Canadians I hope not
[53:35] uh not much to be proud about um I'm not
[53:38] knocking it because we got it way worse
[53:40] down in America so nothing to be proud
[53:42] of as American but what we got sure
[53:44] something to be proud of and that's a
[53:46] heavenly father and a kingdom that we
[53:47] came from and we're going back to really
[53:49] soon and so now on we're we're on this
[53:52] Earthly Journey we're learning to be
[53:54] like him uh this journey was never
[53:56] intended to be easy uh sometimes people
[53:59] get depressed they get down they get
[54:01] discouraged because life doesn't always
[54:03] go the way they think it was going to go
[54:05] but I promise you it's going just the
[54:06] way that God intended it to go because
[54:08] he's more interested in your character
[54:10] than he is in your comfort and we as
[54:12] Christians don't live this life for
[54:14] Comfort we live this life to be
[54:16] conformed into the image of his dear son
[54:19] that is the purpose of Us coming today
[54:21] that is what we are standing here
[54:22] representing this day on this Easter day
[54:24] this Resurrection Day we're not
[54:27] testifying as other churches that there
[54:28] was a resurrection 2,000 years ago we
[54:31] are standing as living Epistles
[54:33] expressed attributes of his glory
[54:35] testifying that that was a great
[54:37] Resurrection but this Resurrection is a
[54:40] greater Resurrection to be called out of
[54:42] dead denominations to be quickened into
[54:45] Christ Jesus conformed into the image of
[54:47] his dear son not a pressure not to be uh
[54:50] you have to live this kind of life not
[54:52] people saying don't do this and don't do
[54:53] that no something from the inside
[54:55] expressing Lord I love you I want to be
[54:57] more like you change me change me from
[54:59] the inside out that's how a dove cleans
[55:02] itself and that's how these doves clean
[55:04] themselves it's the only bird that puts
[55:06] off an oil from the inside pushes all
[55:08] the worldly desires away from you you
[55:11] just don't want them no more and I can
[55:13] be one of those living testimonies I am
[55:16] not what I want to be and I'm not what I
[55:18] ought to be but by God's grace I am not
[55:20] what I used to be he's been pushing off
[55:22] a lot of things and desires I once had I
[55:24] don't have no more because there's
[55:27] something of greater value on the inside
[55:30] now and so it's just uh we just like to
[55:32] get together and talk about him you know
[55:34] brother bandam he says if you want to
[55:36] see angels and if you want God to draw
[55:38] close to you he says keep him on your
[55:40] mind all the time talk about him talk
[55:43] about how good he is how sweet he is
[55:45] don't talk about all the problems
[55:47] believe me if you got some looking for
[55:48] something to criticize you'll find
[55:50] plenty to criticize and you know what
[55:51] God will give you plenty to criticize
[55:53] but if you come looking for God you'll
[55:55] find him
[55:56] I promise you find him he hides himself
[55:59] in Simplicity and reveals himself just
[56:01] the same way and so we're just honored
[56:04] to be here I I sure have you have a
[56:06] beautiful church building I want to
[56:08] congratulate you on such a nice building
[56:10] I see you're doing some construction
[56:12] work here going to be an awesome window
[56:15] and I'm sure it's going to be beautiful
[56:16] on the outside but brother Benham said
[56:18] the true beauty of a church is the
[56:19] character of its people and so as it's
[56:21] getting better on the outside I'm
[56:24] praying for you that all just that
[56:25] character of Christ that beauty starts
[56:27] to overflow in each of your lives more
[56:29] and more every day and so uh give my
[56:33] greetings from my pastor brother Chad
[56:35] Lamb he uh he's just he was in Australia
[56:37] for uh two weeks traveling preaching and
[56:40] uh he just got back home so I haven't
[56:42] had a chance to shake his hand and say
[56:43] hello to him yet um but uh but we're at
[56:45] our we're doing what we we're about our
[56:48] father's business you know we'd like to
[56:49] we want to just do what he's called us
[56:51] to do in this life and so I uh I like to
[56:55] just go over over my announcements they
[56:57] always make me nervous I'd rather go to
[56:58] the word but nonetheless I think that's
[57:00] about all I wanted to say Well when it
[57:04] comes to announcements so brother Dale
[57:07] said uh you know I take my time I can
[57:10] take my time and I have kind of a rule
[57:12] uh my rule is however long it takes me
[57:14] to travel to your church is about how
[57:16] long I allow I think you would allow me
[57:18] to preach and so it took me three hours
[57:20] and 15
[57:22] minutes okay brother Dale said so so
[57:24] don't be upset at me you're a pastor you
[57:27] take it up with him schedule
[57:30] counseling so God bless you I I do have
[57:33] a subject that's been on my heart for
[57:34] quite some time uh I have to honestly
[57:37] say it was something that the Lord
[57:39] placed on my heart about a year and a
[57:41] half ago and uh it's something that I
[57:43] been laboring in and studying on my own
[57:46] uh for quite a bit I have now preached
[57:48] seven parts of this back home and I'm
[57:51] going to preach it all in one
[57:53] today I'm going to condense it down
[57:57] um because I think it's a vital message
[57:59] for the hour in which I think it brings
[58:01] things into perspective I think it helps
[58:04] us to understand why we're going through
[58:06] some of the things that we're going
[58:08] through question marks we might have I
[58:10] think will be answered uh as we start to
[58:13] see what this great hour is that we're
[58:15] living in and what great goal God had um
[58:21] sometimes we we we take it too lightly
[58:24] we take these things too light lightly
[58:26] these things become too common to us but
[58:29] you sometimes don't realize to what
[58:31] great effort God has went to to redeem
[58:34] his sons and daughters and bring them
[58:36] back into fellowship with him and so I
[58:39] hope it's okay we'll just take some time
[58:41] and we'll go through the scriptures
[58:43] together and we'll see where the word
[58:44] takes us how the leading of the Lord but
[58:46] always keep in your mind I leave my
[58:48] notes often times um because I do know
[58:51] and I I always want to be yielded to
[58:53] follow the leading of the Lord and so I
[58:55] do know if you have a need in your heart
[58:57] all you have to do is keep it before the
[58:58] Lord and the Holy Spirit can guide me
[59:01] off my notes and speak directly to
[59:03] whatever need you have uh that's that's
[59:05] our God he he's he's a risen savior he's
[59:09] he's not a Creed not a theology not just
[59:12] some story we've all heard he's a living
[59:15] God dwelling in the presence of his
[59:17] people comes to simple Humble Hearts
[59:20] he's still there's no Beauty we should
[59:21] be hold him there's no Beauty it's still
[59:24] so simple so comp
[59:26] so humble that the wise and great of
[59:28] this world look over past and say a
[59:30] there's nothing to it but it's the same
[59:32] Lord Jesus Discerning the thoughts and
[59:35] the intents of our hearts and speaking
[59:37] to each of our needs so you just pull
[59:41] and we'll see how the Lord leads I'd
[59:43] like you to turn in your Bibles to 1
[59:46] Corinthians chapters
[59:48] 2 verse
[59:52] 4 now back home I'm also the youth
[59:55] leader so we got about 50 kids in our
[59:57] youth and uh I've got
[1:00:00] kids and so it's made me over the years
[1:00:03] become very conscientious to use
[1:00:05] plainness of speech um but the Carson's
[1:00:08] noticed that over the years and I do
[1:00:11] that on purpose um because what good is
[1:00:14] it for our young people to give them
[1:00:18] slogans or pump them up with
[1:00:20] emotion if they don't understand what
[1:00:22] you're talking about and they don't know
[1:00:25] how to overcome the devil and his
[1:00:26] tactics what are we doing this
[1:00:29] for and so you have to have a place to
[1:00:32] stand the prophet of God said man's
[1:00:35] faith cannot stand on the shifting Sands
[1:00:37] of a man's idea he says it needs the
[1:00:40] solid Bedrock of God's word so a Young
[1:00:44] Person's faith can only rest in the word
[1:00:48] of God and I believe it's the duty of
[1:00:51] every minister to make sure that he
[1:00:53] preaches a message that even the young
[1:00:55] people can get something from it and we
[1:00:58] know that this is a pattern throughout
[1:01:00] scripture that even God takes Great
[1:01:02] Mighty wise men and breaks them down
[1:01:05] into such Simplicity that God can
[1:01:06] finally use them Moses wasn't in the
[1:01:09] right kind of shape with his strength
[1:01:11] and his wisdom and all he knew and he
[1:01:13] was powerful man but he was in no
[1:01:15] condition to do God's work and then when
[1:01:17] he could strip that all away from Moses
[1:01:19] now he said now I got a man that'll do
[1:01:21] just what I want him to do say just what
[1:01:23] I want him to say and he'll be quiet
[1:01:25] when I I say be quiet Moses and you'll
[1:01:28] speak when I say speak Moses and that's
[1:01:31] the kind of men we want to be and that's
[1:01:32] the kind of Epistles living Epistles we
[1:01:35] want to be so you just stay with me in
[1:01:38] my
[1:01:39] plainness so First Corinthians chapters
[1:01:43] 2
[1:01:45] verse4 and my speech and my preaching
[1:01:48] was not with enticing words of man's
[1:01:51] Wisdom but in the demonstration of the
[1:01:53] spirit and of power that your faith
[1:01:56] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[1:01:59] but in the power of God how be it we
[1:02:02] speak wisdom among them that are perfect
[1:02:06] that means fully
[1:02:08] matured yet not the wisdom of this world
[1:02:11] nor the princes of this world that come
[1:02:14] to not but we speak the wisdom of God in
[1:02:18] a mystery even the hidden wisdom which
[1:02:21] God ordained before the world unto our
[1:02:24] Glory which none of the princes of this
[1:02:27] world knew for had they Ann it they
[1:02:29] would not have crucified the Lord Of
[1:02:32] Glory now Romans
[1:02:47] 8:14 Romans 8:14 just say Amen when
[1:02:51] you're
[1:02:53] there the word of God reads for as men
[1:02:55] many as are led by the spirit of God
[1:02:58] they are the sons of God for ye have not
[1:03:02] received the spirit of bondage against
[1:03:03] to fear but ye have received the spirit
[1:03:06] of adoption whereby we cry ABA father
[1:03:12] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[1:03:14] our spirit that we are the children of
[1:03:16] God and if children then hirs Hees of
[1:03:20] God and Joint HS with Christ if so be
[1:03:24] that we suffer with him that we may be
[1:03:29] also glorified together for I reckon
[1:03:33] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:03:34] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:03:36] glory which shall be revealed in us for
[1:03:39] the earnest expectation of the creature
[1:03:42] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:03:45] sons of God for the creature was made
[1:03:48] subject to vanity not willingly but by
[1:03:52] reason of him who hath subjected the
[1:03:55] same hope because the creature itself
[1:03:58] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[1:04:00] of corruption into the Glorious Liberty
[1:04:03] of the children of God for we know that
[1:04:07] the whole creation groaneth and
[1:04:10] travaileth in pain together until now
[1:04:14] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:04:18] which have the first fruits of the
[1:04:20] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[1:04:24] ourselves
[1:04:26] waiting for the adoption to with the
[1:04:28] Redemption of the body will you just bow
[1:04:32] your heads for a word of
[1:04:36] prayer gracious Heavenly Father we thank
[1:04:39] you for this day we thank you for the
[1:04:42] opportunity Lord that by your grace
[1:04:43] you'd watch over us Lord that you would
[1:04:46] draw us to a place that's been set aside
[1:04:48] and Sanctified Lord for the preaching of
[1:04:51] your word I pray Lord that you'd
[1:04:53] sanctify my mind sanctify by my lips
[1:04:57] Lord I can do nothing without you so
[1:05:00] father God I pray that you would anoint
[1:05:02] me say just what you want said you know
[1:05:05] the needs of your children father I pray
[1:05:07] that you'd meet their needs I pray Lord
[1:05:10] that an atmosphere of Faith would be
[1:05:12] created so that all things are possible
[1:05:14] to him that believeth father God break
[1:05:17] the word now and open our eyes we pray
[1:05:20] in Jesus name amen amen you may be
[1:05:23] seated everyone
[1:05:28] do you mind if I take off my jacket is
[1:05:30] that okay here all right God bless you
[1:05:34] thank
[1:05:36] you so I'd like to title this
[1:05:39] thought the groaning Pains of
[1:05:43] adoption not the growing pains but the
[1:05:47] groaning
[1:05:49] Pains of
[1:05:52] adoption um the subject of adoption has
[1:05:55] has been quite heavy for me for quite
[1:05:58] some time this last year and I've heard
[1:06:01] many people say different thoughts about
[1:06:03] adoption um and many people have
[1:06:05] interpreted in many ways and I myself
[1:06:09] just felt burned Within Myself to look
[1:06:11] for myself what is adoption all
[1:06:14] about uh because I believe this message
[1:06:16] is more than God sent a
[1:06:18] prophet uh way more you know they uh
[1:06:22] Moses was the prophet that came to Egypt
[1:06:24] thousands of years years ago and 2
[1:06:26] million people recognized that prophet
[1:06:29] in that day and they believed he was a
[1:06:31] true prophet of God with a true message
[1:06:33] of God for deliverance but how many of
[1:06:35] them went to the promised land very few
[1:06:38] they could not enter in because of their
[1:06:40] unbelief uh there was only found to be
[1:06:43] Joshua and Caleb that had a different
[1:06:44] Spirit within them they never doubted
[1:06:46] God they would go wherever he led and we
[1:06:49] find today that we are in a Third Exodus
[1:06:52] and our Exodus did not just consent cons
[1:06:57] uh uh consist of a coming out brother
[1:06:59] bam said there's two parts of an exodus
[1:07:01] there's a coming out and a going in and
[1:07:04] so many of us uh that have maybe been
[1:07:07] raised see I was not raised in the
[1:07:08] message so I haven't been uh maybe told
[1:07:11] now you believe it this way and it was
[1:07:13] said this way and do it this way for me
[1:07:14] I always felt I was one born out of
[1:07:16] season so I got to go look for myself
[1:07:18] what did the prophet of God say what
[1:07:20] does the word of God say I want for
[1:07:22] myself what is this predestinated unto
[1:07:24] the adoption of son
[1:07:26] what am I predestinated to what is God
[1:07:28] bringing me to because I can't do it in
[1:07:31] myself but I am predestinated to be
[1:07:33] conformed into the image of his dear son
[1:07:34] I'm predestinated unto the adoption of a
[1:07:38] son and it's a very clear process for us
[1:07:42] but I also see that it's a great
[1:07:43] Temptation in this hour to just get
[1:07:46] comfortable and if things aren't
[1:07:48] comfortable
[1:07:52] leave uh and I want to remind you what
[1:07:55] the scripture said about adoption and if
[1:07:58] children then heirs verse 17 of Romans 8
[1:08:02] join HS with Christ if so that we suffer
[1:08:07] with
[1:08:08] him so there is no adoption without
[1:08:11] suffering everyone and we find today
[1:08:13] that be people are becoming so soft they
[1:08:16] don't want pain they don't want
[1:08:19] difficulty they don't want struggle they
[1:08:22] don't want conflict they don't want
[1:08:23] anybody rubbing them the wrong way or
[1:08:25] uh poking them in a weak spot so they
[1:08:27] just
[1:08:28] leave they don't go to church no more
[1:08:31] they don't have Fellowship no more they
[1:08:33] abide by themselves we have a message
[1:08:36] and we have a prophet I'm going to sit
[1:08:37] at home and you don't realize you're not
[1:08:41] going to be able to come to
[1:08:44] Perfection a five-fold Ministry was
[1:08:46] given for the perfecting of the Saints
[1:08:49] and there is no perfection without
[1:08:51] suffering and good news for you if
[1:08:53] you're a part of a people there will be
[1:08:55] suffering
[1:08:55] [Laughter]
[1:08:56] because none of us are perfect are any
[1:08:59] of you perfect yet not yet you're only
[1:09:01] made perfect in the eyes of God because
[1:09:03] there's a shed blood there speaking for
[1:09:05] you but your best your righteousness is
[1:09:07] as
[1:09:08] filled you have nothing good you can put
[1:09:11] before him and say look I'm doing a
[1:09:13] pretty good job no we have a blood
[1:09:15] they're speaking greater things my
[1:09:18] righteousness filthy righteousness his
[1:09:20] righteousness a perfect righteousness
[1:09:22] that's imputed unto me by faith in his
[1:09:26] word and in the promises of his word but
[1:09:28] we find so many people don't want to
[1:09:30] come unto Perfection Perfection means
[1:09:33] maturity and maturity is
[1:09:36] painful when you have a child any of us
[1:09:38] that have children when that child is a
[1:09:40] baby do you ever spank a baby no not a
[1:09:44] baby that baby can do whatever it wants
[1:09:47] it can throw its bottle well maybe not
[1:09:49] throw bottle it can goooo Gaga you know
[1:09:51] spit up do everything you're not going
[1:09:52] to spank a baby who spanks a baby
[1:09:56] but you have everything for the baby too
[1:09:58] baby can't itself baby can't change
[1:10:01] itself baby can't put itself down for a
[1:10:03] nap you have to do everything for a baby
[1:10:05] because it's a
[1:10:07] baby but when a baby begins to mature
[1:10:11] now something happens in the maturing of
[1:10:13] a son and maturing of a daughter yeah if
[1:10:16] they do wrong little spanking now don't
[1:10:20] do that sis don't do that honey you're
[1:10:22] not supposed to do that if they throw
[1:10:24] their bottle and they're six years old
[1:10:25] told there's going to be some
[1:10:26] chastisement coming somewhere right and
[1:10:29] that's just the way it goes with
[1:10:30] maturing is also suffering pain comes
[1:10:34] with it because God is training up
[1:10:36] children and so many of us I think we
[1:10:39] thought well well God sent a prophet we
[1:10:40] believe the message and it's all done
[1:10:43] we're over let's go to the throne you're
[1:10:46] not fit for the throne because character
[1:10:49] is not a gift character is a victory you
[1:10:54] have to overcome
[1:10:56] yourself yourself you're your greatest
[1:11:00] enemy you have to overcome your own lust
[1:11:02] of Flesh and lust of the eyes and your
[1:11:04] own pride of life and there's not a one
[1:11:06] of us that doesn't have to overcome this
[1:11:08] is the Bible scripture and you'll fight
[1:11:11] every day of your life this old carnal
[1:11:13] nature and this old carnal flesh that
[1:11:16] gets enticed by this world and you have
[1:11:18] to beat it into subjection every day and
[1:11:20] bring your life subject to his will so
[1:11:23] that God can sit back someday and say
[1:11:25] he's not about his will he's about my
[1:11:27] will he's about the father's business
[1:11:30] he's not interested in his business
[1:11:31] anymore he's about the father's business
[1:11:34] and see I believe that God is raising up
[1:11:36] a mature bride a mature bride not an
[1:11:39] immature bride a mature bride now I'd
[1:11:42] like to take this from many Avenues if
[1:11:44] it's okay and we're going to start in
[1:11:46] the scriptures and we're going to go
[1:11:48] fast for a little bit and then we'll
[1:11:49] pause sometimes but I want you to see
[1:11:51] all of this in the scriptures in the
[1:11:53] message of the hour so again my title
[1:11:56] the groaning Pains of adoption and so
[1:12:00] Galatians 4:4 says but when the fullness
[1:12:04] of time was come God sent forth his son
[1:12:07] made of a woman made under the law to
[1:12:10] redeem them that were under the law that
[1:12:13] we might receive the adoption of sons
[1:12:15] and because you are Sons God has sent
[1:12:17] forth the spirit of his son into your
[1:12:19] hearts crying ABA father wherefore Thou
[1:12:23] Art no more a servant but a son and if a
[1:12:26] son then an heir of God through Christ
[1:12:29] something in your hearts burning I know
[1:12:32] I'm not what I ought to be but something
[1:12:34] yearning putting you before the word
[1:12:36] coming to church listening to the
[1:12:38] message because there's something inside
[1:12:39] you trying to grow come to maturity and
[1:12:42] it needs the good word of God and The
[1:12:44] Fellowship of the Saints to keep
[1:12:46] maturing in the Lord there's something
[1:12:48] groaning earnestly within you and so if
[1:12:51] we see in Colossians
[1:12:53] 1:26 even the mystery of God which hath
[1:12:56] been hid from ages and from Generations
[1:12:59] but is now made manifest to his Saints
[1:13:02] to whom God would make known what is the
[1:13:04] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:13:07] among the Gentiles which is Christ in
[1:13:09] you the hope of glory but we know that
[1:13:13] God is not going to come for an immature
[1:13:15] bride he's not he's not a grown man
[1:13:18] doesn't marry a six-year-old
[1:13:20] girl immaturity too immature God is
[1:13:24] going to unite himself with a fully
[1:13:26] matured bride and so we see we're now in
[1:13:29] Harvest time I believe this name of
[1:13:31] church is Harvest Time Church Harvest
[1:13:33] time now when it comes to Harvest Time
[1:13:35] everything's got to get ripe the sun's
[1:13:37] got to get intense and it's got to bake
[1:13:39] out all the greenness all the immaturity
[1:13:42] all the attitudes the selfishness the
[1:13:45] self-love in that seed in that life so
[1:13:49] it can be just like Christ she'll be so
[1:13:52] much like him she will be him you won't
[1:13:55] be able to tell the difference in their
[1:13:57] nature their attitude their speech their
[1:14:00] conduct you see this is what we are
[1:14:03] being transformed into by his grace and
[1:14:06] his Mercy do you recognize the High
[1:14:08] Calling of your life do you realize what
[1:14:11] you've been born to do you realize the
[1:14:14] mercy and grace of God to bring you a
[1:14:16] message that's going to bring you unto
[1:14:18] Perfection and to a fullness of Christ
[1:14:22] this is quite a high calling everyone
[1:14:24] this is something that cannot be taken
[1:14:26] lightly and we owe Our Lives to
[1:14:29] it so many people want to keep the
[1:14:31] message like close to them they want to
[1:14:33] keep the word oh it's a part of their
[1:14:35] life but it ain't their
[1:14:37] life you'll find yourself eventually
[1:14:40] where God's spirit will no longer strive
[1:14:42] with you he will not strive with you
[1:14:44] you're if you're a disobedient son year
[1:14:47] over year over year and he keeps wooing
[1:14:49] you and wooing you and wooing you and
[1:14:50] you never never listen to this tutor you
[1:14:53] never line up his Spirit won't always
[1:14:55] strive but if there's an inkling of a
[1:14:58] desire in your heart for God to be
[1:14:59] conformed Into His Image then praise God
[1:15:02] he hasn't given up on you because you
[1:15:04] can't desire if that deep is in their
[1:15:07] calling there's got to be a deeper of
[1:15:09] God available for you that's the reality
[1:15:12] of it we know this the Simplicity of it
[1:15:15] if there's something in your heart
[1:15:16] yearning for more of God there must be
[1:15:18] more of God available there must be and
[1:15:21] I'm finding Within Myself I'm groaning
[1:15:24] constantly I'm not what I want to be
[1:15:27] there L there's more for me Lord bring
[1:15:29] me up higher change me keep going Lord I
[1:15:33] I don't want to stop anywhere on the
[1:15:34] journey until I've come to my position
[1:15:37] as an adopted son now brother brandham
[1:15:40] said and what is the Holy Ghost given
[1:15:41] for now watch what God did when his son
[1:15:45] was born he let him go 30 years testing
[1:15:48] him trying him then he give him three
[1:15:51] years of hard trials and then at the end
[1:15:54] of the hard trial when he seen that his
[1:15:57] son was about the father's business he
[1:16:00] took him to mount Transfiguration in the
[1:16:02] Book of Luke he took Peter James and
[1:16:05] John three Witnesses and he went on top
[1:16:08] of a mountain and there God performed
[1:16:11] the laws of adoption he they looked up
[1:16:14] and they seen Jesus and his clothes
[1:16:16] shined as white as a lightning and a
[1:16:18] cloud overshadowed him and a voice came
[1:16:20] out of the cloud saying this is my
[1:16:22] beloved Son hear ye him him that's what
[1:16:26] he says now I'll sit down now I have no
[1:16:30] more else to say what he says will be
[1:16:34] the law and the truth you know God wants
[1:16:38] to take a rest he's waiting for you he's
[1:16:42] waiting for you to come to maturity so
[1:16:44] God can take a little bit of a break
[1:16:47] you're wearing him out he wants to be
[1:16:50] able to take a rest and has so much
[1:16:52] confidence in you that he'll say the
[1:16:54] right thing
[1:16:55] or he'll say nothing at all he'll speak
[1:16:58] when I say speak he'll be silent when I
[1:17:00] tell him to be
[1:17:01] silent that's what God's looking for in
[1:17:03] a mature
[1:17:05] son so he was caught up Jesus's adoption
[1:17:09] was on Mount Transfiguration after the
[1:17:11] trial now he received the baptism of
[1:17:13] Holy Spirit the Bible says that the
[1:17:15] spirit of God descended like a dove down
[1:17:17] there at the River Jordan there with
[1:17:18] this Prophet baptized him there and the
[1:17:20] spirit of God descended but he then had
[1:17:22] to go through some more trials some more
[1:17:24] test testings to see if he would be
[1:17:26] faithful to just be about the father's
[1:17:29] business before he could become an
[1:17:31] adopted son now in our modern language
[1:17:34] we don't understand adoption we use the
[1:17:36] word adoption incorrectly according to
[1:17:38] the Bible now a bi biblical adoption was
[1:17:41] on this place brother bham describes it
[1:17:43] in desperations and so when the Holy
[1:17:46] Ghost fell upon the Pentecostal people
[1:17:48] and they began to restore back the gifts
[1:17:50] and things to the church they thought
[1:17:51] that they were born in the spirit and
[1:17:53] that settled it but you see there is a
[1:17:56] placing of a son and after this son
[1:18:00] proved to be a real son then he was
[1:18:03] taken to a public place there he was set
[1:18:07] up his robes were changed and he sat
[1:18:10] there and this is the placing of a son
[1:18:13] that he was now heir to everything that
[1:18:16] the father
[1:18:17] had God did the same thing for his son
[1:18:20] on Mount
[1:18:21] Transfiguration he changed he was
[1:18:23] transfigured in his rment shined as the
[1:18:25] sun this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:18:28] well pleased so we see a Biblical
[1:18:31] adoption was when a father would take
[1:18:33] his son now he would be a servant he
[1:18:35] though he was born a son he would be
[1:18:37] treated just like all the other servants
[1:18:39] in the home and he would be placed under
[1:18:41] a tutor and he would be tested and tried
[1:18:44] constantly to see how he would respond
[1:18:47] in this situation how he would handle
[1:18:49] this one talking bad about him how he
[1:18:51] would talk handle this situation and
[1:18:53] that situation how was he going to
[1:18:55] mature under the tutor would he listen
[1:18:57] to the tutor would he do his own thing
[1:19:00] or would he come subject to the leading
[1:19:01] of the
[1:19:03] tutor now the tutor had to come back and
[1:19:06] be able to give a good report your son
[1:19:08] is just like you he's just like you and
[1:19:11] when the father could hear he's just
[1:19:13] like you he responds just like you he
[1:19:16] would run the family business just like
[1:19:18] you then he says okay he's no longer
[1:19:20] going to be treated like a servant today
[1:19:22] I make him a son now he would take him
[1:19:25] to a public place before all the people
[1:19:27] and say this is my son I'm going on
[1:19:32] vacation he's going to run the family
[1:19:34] business from now on I can take my rest
[1:19:38] he's submitted finally his will to
[1:19:42] mine didn't change the fact that he was
[1:19:44] a son he was born a son but he was not
[1:19:46] treated any different than a servant
[1:19:48] until he could be tested tried and
[1:19:51] proved to be a real son then there's the
[1:19:54] placing of a son that's the adoption of
[1:19:59] the sons of
[1:20:00] God so we see that this must take place
[1:20:04] for each of us as Sons and Daughters of
[1:20:07] God so many people stopped when they got
[1:20:09] the baptism of the Holy Spirit and they
[1:20:11] thought I'm all done no more maturing
[1:20:13] for me I'm good I can kick back relax
[1:20:16] and do my own
[1:20:17] thing no you
[1:20:19] can't no you can't you don't understand
[1:20:23] what it's all about you you might have
[1:20:25] screamed you might have shouted you
[1:20:26] might have run up and down the altars
[1:20:27] you might have felt the blessings of God
[1:20:30] but if you're predestinated unto the
[1:20:31] adoption of sons you're going to find
[1:20:33] out that your will is not your
[1:20:35] own you will not be about your will
[1:20:37] you'll be about the father's will his
[1:20:39] business you're on this Earth to
[1:20:41] perform that's a true Son of
[1:20:44] God so many times we just want life easy
[1:20:48] we want to do our own thing and we want
[1:20:51] God to be like a Aaron boy for us
[1:20:53] brother bam said you never pray until
[1:20:55] you need him you have a financial need
[1:20:57] or a bad situation then you're like Lord
[1:20:59] help me solve my
[1:21:00] problems and we know that's not how we
[1:21:02] ought to pray the prophet of God told us
[1:21:05] we should be praying finding his will
[1:21:06] for our lives not praying to have God
[1:21:09] fulfill our will for our
[1:21:11] lives see the attitude the mentality of
[1:21:14] a true bride of Jesus
[1:21:16] Christ sometimes we want the
[1:21:19] benefits but we don't want to go through
[1:21:21] what's necessary to be it we don't want
[1:21:24] to surrender
[1:21:26] everyone so in Blasphemous names
[1:21:29] 1962 he says our family when a son is
[1:21:32] born it's a son but it's put under
[1:21:34] tutors to raise it and if that son never
[1:21:37] did come to be the right kind of a son
[1:21:40] then he will never be an heir but if
[1:21:43] he's the right son and a son that will
[1:21:46] obey his father then he will be an
[1:21:49] adopted son and positionally placed he
[1:21:52] will be an heir to all that the father
[1:21:55] has and that's what we want to be an
[1:21:58] heir to all that the father has now
[1:22:02] brother bam makes this comment and this
[1:22:03] is what really shook
[1:22:05] me he said now what's see what God was
[1:22:08] doing on Mount Transfiguration he took
[1:22:10] his own son up there you see he had been
[1:22:13] proven to be the right son for he was
[1:22:15] able to stand all the Temptations
[1:22:17] therefore he was taken up to mount
[1:22:19] Transfiguration and he was
[1:22:21] overshadowed brother bam there is where
[1:22:23] our Pentecost people made their mistake
[1:22:27] being born into the family by the Holy
[1:22:29] Ghost that's right but then we must be
[1:22:31] the right kind of children tutored by
[1:22:34] the right
[1:22:35] tutor many people want the experiences
[1:22:38] of Pentecost they want the gifts of
[1:22:41] Pentecost the anointing of Pentecost but
[1:22:43] they don't want to go on to the full
[1:22:45] maturity that God requires Pentecost to
[1:22:48] to go from to you know brother Brenham
[1:22:51] said this he said you know the greatest
[1:22:53] robbery that ever took place in the
[1:22:55] history of man was caused by a false
[1:22:58] light yeah he said the greatest Train
[1:23:00] Robbery I think they shined a false
[1:23:01] light a train thought it was another
[1:23:03] train so he stopped on the tracks and
[1:23:04] they robbed the train because of this
[1:23:07] light he said you know the church's
[1:23:10] greatest robbery was caused by a false
[1:23:13] light he said the light of the previous
[1:23:16] age becomes the blinding light to the
[1:23:19] present light
[1:23:20] coming so Pentecost becomes a blinding
[1:23:24] light to where God is taking the Bride
[1:23:26] of Jesus
[1:23:27] Christ heavy statement that's what the
[1:23:29] prophet of God said and I'm going to say
[1:23:32] just what he said cuz we find there's a
[1:23:34] move back to Pentecost back to Pentecost
[1:23:37] I'm all for it let's go back to
[1:23:38] Pentecost but let's go back to what they
[1:23:40] were in heart and in mind brother
[1:23:42] brandham said not just the signs the
[1:23:44] Wonders the gifts the Miracles go back
[1:23:47] to where they could say for me to live
[1:23:48] as Christ and to die is gain that's what
[1:23:51] the brother brandham said was back to
[1:23:53] Pentecost where it's no longer your will
[1:23:55] but his will you're living for but
[1:23:58] people just want the anointing but they
[1:23:59] don't want to subject their will to the
[1:24:01] father's will proving I wonder what
[1:24:04] they're really looking for do they want
[1:24:07] the adoption of a
[1:24:09] son or do they want
[1:24:12] Pentecost a blinding light from a
[1:24:14] previous
[1:24:15] age that's what the prophet said that's
[1:24:19] what the prophet said
[1:24:21] now First Corinthians it says this 1
[1:24:25] Corinthians
[1:24:26] 13:10 but when that which is perfect is
[1:24:29] come then that which is in part shall be
[1:24:31] done away with brother brandham said we
[1:24:33] have today by God's grace the perfect
[1:24:36] interpretation of the word of God with
[1:24:38] Divine Vindication so if we have a
[1:24:41] perfect word here then see what's next
[1:24:44] when I was a child I spake as a child
[1:24:46] for I understood as a child I thought as
[1:24:49] a child but when I became a man I put
[1:24:51] away childish things for now we see
[1:24:54] through a glass Darkly but then face to
[1:24:57] face now I know in part but then I shall
[1:25:00] know even as I am known you did not
[1:25:02] realize the mystery of God that was in
[1:25:06] you the great mystery unfolding of God
[1:25:09] that God has been working on unveiling
[1:25:12] himself he said there was a three-fold
[1:25:13] purpose in the back part of his mind
[1:25:15] Christ The Mystery of God revealed to
[1:25:16] gain preeminence first in a man he did
[1:25:18] it Christ Jesus now he's trying to gain
[1:25:20] the preeminence in a
[1:25:23] people he's trying he's working really
[1:25:26] hard the only thing that can stop his
[1:25:28] will your will he's a perfect gentleman
[1:25:32] he will not force you to do something
[1:25:35] you don't want to
[1:25:36] do my it's an amazing thing to
[1:25:40] consider but that's the scriptures
[1:25:43] that's this
[1:25:44] message and that's what's going on he
[1:25:47] said there was a four stages there's a
[1:25:49] lot of farm ground over here so you all
[1:25:51] understand farming quite well uh there's
[1:25:53] four stages there's the stalk there's
[1:25:56] the tosel there's the shuck and then
[1:25:59] there's the seed life is in the fourth
[1:26:01] stage brother brandham says this
[1:26:04] justification made way for
[1:26:06] sanctification sanctification made way
[1:26:08] for the baptism of the Holy Spirit but
[1:26:11] the baptism of the Holy Spirit made way
[1:26:13] for the person of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:15] himself to come down into Perfection and
[1:26:18] bring the word
[1:26:19] again ah Perfection full
[1:26:22] maturity so
[1:26:24] water blood spirit the ingredients for a
[1:26:28] life brings forth a baby but it's just
[1:26:31] that a
[1:26:34] baby a baby now the baby must move on
[1:26:38] into
[1:26:40] maturing now I found this so interesting
[1:26:43] because this fourth stage is the stage
[1:26:45] of life and so when I was looking at
[1:26:47] this by brother bham said now the book
[1:26:50] of Ephesians parallels the Book of
[1:26:52] Joshua it's the adoption book it's the
[1:26:56] placing of a son now when I began to go
[1:26:59] look through that I began to think okay
[1:27:02] Ephesians we look in Ephesians chapters
[1:27:04] 1:4 it says having predestinated us unto
[1:27:08] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:27:11] to himself according to the good
[1:27:12] pleasure of his will well what's so
[1:27:15] interesting I I went back a few books
[1:27:17] and I says well we all know the book of
[1:27:18] Romans is kind of known as the book of
[1:27:20] justification Romans 3:25 it says
[1:27:24] wherefore there where is boasting it's
[1:27:26] excluded uh by uh by law of Works nay
[1:27:29] but by the law of Faith therefore we
[1:27:31] conclude that a man is justified by
[1:27:33] faith without the Deeds of the law so in
[1:27:35] the Book of Romans is a justification
[1:27:37] book so then we go to the next book and
[1:27:39] it's so interesting the very first
[1:27:41] chapter in the very first verse Paul
[1:27:43] called to be Apostle of Jesus Christ by
[1:27:45] the will of God unto thus our brother
[1:27:48] unto the Church of God which is at
[1:27:50] Corinth to them that are sanctified in
[1:27:54] Christ Jesus called to be Saints and to
[1:27:57] every place whereupon the name of Jesus
[1:27:59] Christ Our Lord is called so then the
[1:28:01] first book justification is found in
[1:28:03] Romans the Second Step sanctification
[1:28:07] found in the first book of Corinthians
[1:28:09] it's just we're following down line so
[1:28:10] then the next book would be Galatians
[1:28:12] what's amazing Galatians is quite the
[1:28:14] book it says this oh foolish Galatians
[1:28:17] who hath Bewitched you that you should o
[1:28:19] not obey the truth before whose eyes
[1:28:21] Jesus Christ was evidently set forth Cru
[1:28:24] CR ified among you this only would I
[1:28:26] learn of you received ye the Spirit by
[1:28:29] The Works of the law or by the hearing
[1:28:30] of Faith are you so soon foolish to have
[1:28:33] begun in the spirit that you're now made
[1:28:35] perfect in the flesh this is that
[1:28:38] confusing book this one's odd Galatians
[1:28:42] is the book where Paul the Apostle the
[1:28:44] messenger to the first church age
[1:28:46] withstands Peter to his face a man who
[1:28:50] had the Holy Ghost withstands him to his
[1:28:53] face
[1:28:54] because he's trying to perfect himself
[1:28:56] withdrawing himself from the Gentiles
[1:28:59] thinking he can withdraw himself and and
[1:29:01] basically put forth a circumcision In
[1:29:03] the Flesh for further Perfection but
[1:29:05] you're not perfected by works you're
[1:29:07] perfected by faith and there Peter got
[1:29:10] within it the righteousness indignation
[1:29:12] withstands Peter to his face and calls
[1:29:14] him out because there's your
[1:29:17] deception they had the baptism of Holy
[1:29:19] Spirit Peter had the baptism of Holy
[1:29:21] Spirit but he's about to make a massive
[1:29:23] mistake he's not going to move on into
[1:29:25] adoption which is by faith found in the
[1:29:27] word of God coming and subjection to
[1:29:29] whatever the Apostle Paul preaches he's
[1:29:31] trying to withdraw himself unto a uh the
[1:29:34] the to the Jews and a circumcision of
[1:29:37] the flesh so we find it's a critical
[1:29:39] moment we ourselves right now in a
[1:29:42] critical
[1:29:45] moment critical moment the messenger to
[1:29:47] the age which was Paul then rebukes
[1:29:50] Peter Peter takes the rebuke he takes
[1:29:53] the pain pain of the correction does not
[1:29:56] the scripture say if you're my child you
[1:29:58] can stand chastisement and if you're not
[1:30:01] my son you can't stand
[1:30:03] chastisement so Peter identified himself
[1:30:06] to be a true son he could stand the
[1:30:08] chastisement of Paul and he can line up
[1:30:10] with the word so then you have that
[1:30:13] baptism of Holy Spirit but it's that
[1:30:14] critical moment brother bam said that
[1:30:16] critical moment then we have obviously
[1:30:19] Ephesians chapters 1 and 4 predestinated
[1:30:22] to the adoption of son so see it's the
[1:30:24] fourth justification Romans
[1:30:25] sanctification Corinthians baptism Holy
[1:30:28] Spirit Galatians but that's that
[1:30:29] critical moment for everyone they think
[1:30:31] they're fine they can go home they can
[1:30:32] just not go to church no more do what I
[1:30:34] want I already heard the prophet I heard
[1:30:36] the message I believe it yeah that's
[1:30:37] great so did they thousands of years ago
[1:30:40] in the first Exodus they heard the
[1:30:42] prophet they heard the message of the
[1:30:43] hour they believed it they left the of
[1:30:45] egpt they left the denominational
[1:30:47] systems and they went and wandered
[1:30:49] around in the wilderness and complained
[1:30:50] every day of their life complained about
[1:30:52] the pastor complained about the church
[1:30:54] complained about this brother complained
[1:30:55] about that brother don't like the music
[1:30:57] don't like this I don't like this I
[1:31:01] don't boy so then this brings into the
[1:31:04] question what part of the journey are
[1:31:06] you on right
[1:31:08] now now you may not be in Egypt but are
[1:31:12] you in the
[1:31:13] wilderness where there's constant
[1:31:15] murmuring and complaining about
[1:31:18] everything or have you come into the
[1:31:20] promised land positionally placed by
[1:31:23] Joshua
[1:31:24] the holy spirit that uses a five-fold
[1:31:26] Ministry of pastors Apostles prophets
[1:31:29] evangelists and teachers that are
[1:31:31] fallible
[1:31:33] men God uses non-perfect people to
[1:31:36] perfect his
[1:31:38] bride iron sharpens iron if you ever
[1:31:41] sharpen a knife it's got to go on
[1:31:42] something abrasive to be sharpened God
[1:31:45] knows how to perfect his children even
[1:31:47] the scripture says heresies must needs
[1:31:49] become so that those that are approved
[1:31:50] among you will be made manifested that
[1:31:53] means made flesh made living Epistles
[1:31:56] read of all men so that question is
[1:31:59] always an individual question where are
[1:32:01] you on this Exodus Journey might not be
[1:32:04] in Egypt but are you still in the
[1:32:06] wilderness it's individual question for
[1:32:08] each of
[1:32:09] us Hebrews says this
[1:32:13] 3:15 while it is said today if you will
[1:32:16] hear his voice hearken not your hearts
[1:32:18] as in the provocation for some when they
[1:32:21] had heard did provoke how be it not all
[1:32:24] that came out of Egypt by Moses but with
[1:32:27] them whom he G was grieved 40 years was
[1:32:31] it not with them that had sinned whose
[1:32:34] carcasses fell in the wilderness unto
[1:32:36] whom swear that they would not enter
[1:32:39] into his rest but to them that believe
[1:32:43] not so we see that they could not enter
[1:32:46] in because of
[1:32:48] unbelief Hebrews 4 let us therefore fear
[1:32:51] lest the promise being left us of
[1:32:53] entering into his rest any of you should
[1:32:55] seem to come short of For unto us was
[1:32:59] the Gospel preached as well as unto them
[1:33:01] but the word preached did not profit
[1:33:03] them not being mixed with faith in them
[1:33:06] that heard it for we which have believed
[1:33:09] do enter into rest as he has said I have
[1:33:12] sworn in my wrath if they shall not
[1:33:13] enter my rest although the works were
[1:33:15] finished from before the foundation of
[1:33:17] the world Paul's speaking to the church
[1:33:19] saying you better be a fearful Bunch you
[1:33:22] better take this serious viously just
[1:33:25] because you hear the prophet just
[1:33:27] because you can agree and say it's the
[1:33:28] truth that does not mean it's doing
[1:33:30] anything for
[1:33:32] you brother brandham said he said uh
[1:33:35] just agreeing in the message is not
[1:33:36] enough he said there's a woman on the
[1:33:38] front row she' make me a fine wife she
[1:33:39] looks like a good Christian wife she'd
[1:33:41] make me a good Christian wife I'm sure
[1:33:42] in all ways she'd be a good Christian
[1:33:43] wife he said but she's not mine until I
[1:33:45] take her and make her mine so many
[1:33:47] people look at the message they agree
[1:33:48] with the message but they don't make it
[1:33:49] a part of their life they fail to have a
[1:33:52] revelation that it's the mystery of God
[1:33:53] unveiled in the hour in which they're
[1:33:55] living it's Christ to you now you could
[1:33:58] either say Okay Noah's got an ark there
[1:34:00] and it's a pretty good Ark and I know
[1:34:01] destructions coming but I'm not getting
[1:34:03] on the ark I'm going to stay on the
[1:34:04] outside of the Ark I'm not getting into
[1:34:06] Christ now that Ark represented Christ
[1:34:08] the word because it was the word of God
[1:34:10] made manifested God spoke to a prophet
[1:34:13] he brought he brought into view the word
[1:34:15] of God made manifested and it was a way
[1:34:17] of Escape because impending judgment was
[1:34:20] coming now we all know impending
[1:34:22] judgment is coming for this hellbent
[1:34:25] world both in Canada and America as
[1:34:27] hellish as all get out and every one of
[1:34:30] you know it like how God hasn't already
[1:34:32] burnt the whole thing up already I don't
[1:34:35] understand I'm a human being and I'm
[1:34:38] disgusted by what I see the selfishness
[1:34:41] the selflove the nonsense that you see
[1:34:44] everywhere now what do you think God is
[1:34:46] doing sitting back holding back the
[1:34:49] judgments of God waiting for that last
[1:34:52] predestinated seed coming in and then
[1:34:55] them that have come in laying in the
[1:34:57] presence of the Sun for full Harvest
[1:35:01] maturity we're at the end
[1:35:03] everyone but they had to get in the ark
[1:35:06] to avoid the Judgment floods they had to
[1:35:09] get in I want to drop this in there too
[1:35:11] I've been studying this brother Brenham
[1:35:12] said there was so much science and
[1:35:14] technology and education in Noah's day
[1:35:17] that they could shoot the moon and prove
[1:35:19] there's no rain up there Noah why do you
[1:35:22] think science and education
[1:35:24] Advanced to disprove God Science
[1:35:28] Education and technology is all of the
[1:35:30] devil all you have to do is go back in
[1:35:33] the beginning and see where civilization
[1:35:34] came from Cane's line of people Commerce
[1:35:37] and workers of metal and music and it
[1:35:39] all came as a result of a fallen seed
[1:35:42] the serpent seed not God's children the
[1:35:45] Devils brought this world that you see
[1:35:48] all around you into
[1:35:50] view so if you think about it in that
[1:35:53] day
[1:35:54] Science Education and Technology had
[1:35:56] Advanced to a point to just disprove
[1:35:59] God's word that's it now they shot the
[1:36:03] moon brother bham said when they shot
[1:36:05] the Moon it knocked the world off its
[1:36:07] axis flooded the Earth and destroyed the
[1:36:11] people he say God doesn't destroy man
[1:36:14] man destroys
[1:36:16] himself God all he has to do is just
[1:36:18] step back all he has to do in your life
[1:36:21] is just take one step back and you're
[1:36:24] finished your own lusts will override
[1:36:28] every moral compass and every
[1:36:30] restraining aspect of the holy spirit in
[1:36:32] life it'll destroy every aspect of you
[1:36:34] all he has to do is take one step back
[1:36:37] and you're
[1:36:38] finished man destroys himself God
[1:36:41] doesn't destroy man so now I'm looking
[1:36:43] at it and looking at it again today oh
[1:36:46] in our day we've now had another
[1:36:48] explosion of science technology and
[1:36:51] education with one purpose God
[1:36:55] not to make the bride's life a little
[1:36:58] easier where do you think it came from
[1:37:01] what purpose do you think it's serving
[1:37:04] brother Brenham said science and
[1:37:05] education poisoned the mind of the
[1:37:08] people in Noah's day to where they
[1:37:10] couldn't receive Noah's message what do
[1:37:13] you think your science and education and
[1:37:15] technology is do it's poisoning the
[1:37:17] minds of the people to not believe God's
[1:37:20] word it's the same pattern not changed
[1:37:24] you're just living in Satan's Eden and
[1:37:25] did not Jesus say as it was in the days
[1:37:27] of Noah so shall it be in the coming of
[1:37:29] the son of man an explosion of science
[1:37:32] technology and education one goal one
[1:37:35] purpose discredit God's word and the
[1:37:37] destruction of God's people brother bam
[1:37:38] said that's the whole purpose of all of
[1:37:40] it so we find these
[1:37:42] parallels as we see this Exodus in the
[1:37:46] beginning and I want to drop this in
[1:37:47] here as well we know there's an outer
[1:37:49] court experience an inner court
[1:37:51] experience and a holy of Holy Experience
[1:37:53] and I find often times today people uh
[1:37:55] haven't went all the way we just have to
[1:37:57] be honest uh when their life is good
[1:38:00] God's blessing them they have plenty of
[1:38:02] money and home Life's good okay they're
[1:38:05] doing pretty good but as soon as
[1:38:06] something in their natural life goes a
[1:38:08] little wild doesn't work out quite the
[1:38:10] way they they think it a well all of a
[1:38:12] sudden they're just they're miserable
[1:38:13] they're down they're out they're
[1:38:14] frustrated they're angry they don't want
[1:38:16] to go to church they don't want to have
[1:38:17] any Fellowship
[1:38:18] Believers because it's all based on the
[1:38:20] natural sunlight when the natural
[1:38:22] sunlight blocked by the clouds they
[1:38:25] don't do so good but then there's
[1:38:27] another little bit greater light uh and
[1:38:29] that's the inner court and then the
[1:38:31] inner Court there's seven golden
[1:38:32] candlesticks and the Seven golden
[1:38:33] candlesticks give forth a light and what
[1:38:35] is it the seven a the seven Church ages
[1:38:37] and the Seven Messengers represented
[1:38:39] there so what is it brother man said
[1:38:40] it's a church light they live by the
[1:38:43] Light of the church so if the church
[1:38:44] they're doing good as long as nobody
[1:38:46] rubs me the wrong way I'm doing good I'm
[1:38:48] happy to come to church and as long as
[1:38:49] Pastor doesn't ever uh preach against
[1:38:51] anything that you know I my personal
[1:38:53] preference and said what I'm doing
[1:38:56] okay uh but as soon as he does I want no
[1:39:00] fellowship with Believers I want to
[1:39:01] isolate myself you know why you haven't
[1:39:04] went all the
[1:39:06] way you haven't went into the holy of
[1:39:09] holies there's a church light that you
[1:39:11] can live by but brother mam said those
[1:39:13] candles get
[1:39:14] Smoky and when the church gets going
[1:39:16] through a little difficulty then all of
[1:39:18] a sudden you want to run
[1:39:20] away Ah that's when the church needs you
[1:39:23] the
[1:39:24] most when things get difficult that's
[1:39:26] when the body needs each other more than
[1:39:29] ever
[1:39:30] before but there is a light NE never
[1:39:33] goes out and that's the shikina light
[1:39:36] and brother bam said it was once sin to
[1:39:37] go beyond that Veil into that shakina of
[1:39:39] light he said now it's sin if you don't
[1:39:42] it was once dead he said sudden death to
[1:39:44] go in now it's death if you don't you'll
[1:39:48] you're going to perish unless you can go
[1:39:50] all the way that's just the reality of
[1:39:52] it that's what he he's wooing you he's
[1:39:54] calling you to come in and if you refuse
[1:39:56] to come in what what's he going to
[1:39:58] do what's he going to do so let's look
[1:40:02] at this pathway of adoption is this okay
[1:40:04] we doing all right I mean when you want
[1:40:06] me to stop just say stop I'll stop so I
[1:40:09] want to look at this continuation of the
[1:40:11] pathway onto adoption because remember
[1:40:13] we're going from a child to a full
[1:40:15] matured adult and I found a pattern in
[1:40:17] the life of Jesus Christ because he is
[1:40:19] our pattern and it's found in
[1:40:21] Philippians
[1:40:22] 2:5 Philippians 2:5 and the word of God
[1:40:25] says let now I'm going to stop right
[1:40:28] there on the first word let means allow
[1:40:32] it means you have to allow let this mind
[1:40:35] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:40:39] who being in the form of God thought it
[1:40:41] not robbery to be equal with God but
[1:40:44] made himself of no reputation took upon
[1:40:48] himself the form of a servant and was
[1:40:51] made in the likeness of men and being
[1:40:53] found in the fashion as man he humbled
[1:40:55] himself and he became obedient unto
[1:40:59] death even the death of the Cross and
[1:41:02] what I jumped out to me as I began to
[1:41:04] see in verse five you see there's a
[1:41:07] decision you have to allow the mind of
[1:41:10] Christ to be in you remember he's a
[1:41:12] perfect gentleman he's not going to
[1:41:14] force himself into your life you have to
[1:41:16] let it and then in verse 7even he took
[1:41:19] upon the form of a servant so he first
[1:41:22] made his the decision and then he
[1:41:25] doesn't look to be served he looks to
[1:41:27] serve he says not my will be done but
[1:41:30] thine will be done he was about the
[1:41:33] father's business and then what you see
[1:41:35] is there's a sacrifice made and in the
[1:41:38] sacrifice he becomes obedient unto death
[1:41:40] though he is in the form of God he
[1:41:42] humbles himself and becomes obedient
[1:41:43] unto death and I found this to be the
[1:41:45] pathway of an adopted son this is found
[1:41:49] everywhere in the Bible it's found in
[1:41:52] the Book of Joshua in the first Exodus
[1:41:54] it's found in brother banham's life and
[1:41:55] it's found in the bride there's first a
[1:41:58] decision and then God makes you he
[1:42:00] stands in silence while you make your
[1:42:02] decision to see what you'll do will it
[1:42:03] be your will or his will and then
[1:42:05] ultimately it leads to a sacrifice of
[1:42:08] your will for God's Will and we find
[1:42:10] this first found in Mark let's look at
[1:42:12] Jesus Jesus is following the pattern of
[1:42:15] this he says in Mark 14 36 he said ABA
[1:42:20] father all things are possible unto thee
[1:42:22] take away this cup from me nevertheless
[1:42:26] not my will but thy will be done you see
[1:42:31] he didn't even do his own
[1:42:33] will he didn't even do his own will he
[1:42:35] was only about the father's business he
[1:42:38] wanted to not have to do this Lord if
[1:42:40] there's any way I mean is there any
[1:42:42] other way and then instantly no not my
[1:42:45] will thine will be done so he makes his
[1:42:49] decision his will or God's will then we
[1:42:52] find it and Joshua I'd like to look at
[1:42:55] it from Joshua because in the first
[1:42:57] Exodus let's see a decision made in
[1:42:59] Joshua 1:16 it says and they answered
[1:43:02] Joshua saying all that thou Hast
[1:43:04] commanded us we will do whatsoever thou
[1:43:07] sendest us we will go according as we
[1:43:11] hearkened unto Moses in all things so
[1:43:14] will we hearken unto thee only the Lord
[1:43:16] God be with thee as he was with Moses so
[1:43:19] even Israel before they're going into
[1:43:21] the promised land he puts before them a
[1:43:23] decision what will you say about it will
[1:43:26] you do all that I lead you to do or will
[1:43:28] you do half of what I tell you to
[1:43:30] do see the Holy Spirit asking through
[1:43:33] Joshua Joshua type of the Holy Spirit
[1:43:35] the people in that day make your
[1:43:36] decision before we go into the land will
[1:43:38] you obey will you hearken to my
[1:43:40] voice now we look at brother Branham
[1:43:43] brother bham had to make a decision did
[1:43:45] you know
[1:43:46] that brother Branham had to even come to
[1:43:49] an adopted son do you know that we're
[1:43:51] going to look at it it's perfect now
[1:43:53] brother bham had to First make his
[1:43:55] decision this decision can be found in
[1:43:58] the prophecy of Danny Henry because thou
[1:44:00] Hast uh because thou Hast chosen the
[1:44:04] Narrow Path the harder way thou Hast
[1:44:07] walked in thine own choosing thou Hast
[1:44:10] picked the precise and correct way
[1:44:13] correct decision and it is my way
[1:44:16] because of this momentous decision a
[1:44:19] huge portion of Heaven awaits thee
[1:44:21] brother brandham had to make his own
[1:44:23] choice and it was the harder way we all
[1:44:26] get to Life's decision sometimes and we
[1:44:29] get to make a decision I'm either going
[1:44:30] to take my way which is usually the easy
[1:44:33] way or I'm God's way which is usually
[1:44:37] the harder way it's usually not hard to
[1:44:39] know what God's way is it's the harder
[1:44:42] way it's just the harder way but you
[1:44:44] know what humans avoid pain at all costs
[1:44:47] it's sad to say but we really do we want
[1:44:49] air conditioning we want soft pews we
[1:44:52] want no
[1:45:53] so see the first decision comes into
[1:45:55] view that's the first step of an adopted
[1:45:57] son the second one that comes into view
[1:45:59] is silence now it's interesting when um
[1:46:02] a child is uh growing up now my oldest
[1:46:05] one when she's making decisions on her
[1:46:08] own now I don't always tell her
[1:46:10] everything to do sometimes me and Mom we
[1:46:13] sit back and watch the decisions that
[1:46:15] she makes sometimes we just want to see
[1:46:17] what she says what she's going to do
[1:46:19] she's put in a tough situation someone
[1:46:21] maybe says something about how's she
[1:46:23] going to respond we want to see what
[1:46:25] character shines through our daughter
[1:46:27] you know we're watching her growing up
[1:46:29] we're watching her maturity we don't
[1:46:31] always intervene in everything and solve
[1:46:33] all their problems for her you know you
[1:46:35] know God does that for us too sometimes
[1:46:38] God goes completely
[1:46:40] silent completely silent Where's God God
[1:46:43] why aren't you moving on the scene why
[1:46:44] aren't you solving this problem Lord I
[1:46:46] need you right now he's like I'm going
[1:46:48] to sit here for a second I want to see
[1:46:51] how they respond
[1:46:55] I'm going you know God does big things
[1:46:57] in silence prophet of God said he does
[1:47:00] great big things in silence sometimes
[1:47:02] father God just sits back and watches
[1:47:04] his children oh that's how they're going
[1:47:07] to
[1:47:09] behave that's how they're going to treat
[1:47:11] that brother my own you know their own
[1:47:13] brother and sister in Christ that's how
[1:47:15] they're going to handle
[1:47:16] them oh that's how they're going to
[1:47:19] treat the Man Down on the Corner that's
[1:47:22] how they talk about about uh the
[1:47:24] unregenerated but but but people that
[1:47:26] are human beings that have life I gave
[1:47:28] them life that's how they act serpent
[1:47:30] seed I don't have time for them oh
[1:47:33] that's how they
[1:47:35] act then when God goes silent there's a
[1:47:38] reason behind his
[1:47:40] silence sometimes God will go silent in
[1:47:42] the church just to watch how everybody
[1:47:44] behaves
[1:47:47] themselves God sometimes won't solve a
[1:47:49] problem for the pastor Pastor don't know
[1:47:51] what to do he's like Lord I don't know
[1:47:53] what to do right here Lord help me help
[1:47:55] me yeah it's good let him sweat it out
[1:47:57] for a moment I'm going let him sit back
[1:47:59] I want to see how he handles this make
[1:48:01] him wait for a moment before I show him
[1:48:03] what to do he does this when God goes
[1:48:07] it's not because he's not up to
[1:48:09] nothing God's up to something in each of
[1:48:12] Our Lives when God goes
[1:48:14] silent so that silence serves a purpose
[1:48:18] for the adoption of sons you'll find
[1:48:21] that pattern consistently
[1:48:23] now Jesus in Isaiah 53 he o he was
[1:48:26] oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened
[1:48:28] not his mouth he was brought as a lamb
[1:48:31] to the slaughter and as a sheep before
[1:48:33] his shears is dumb he opened not his
[1:48:36] mouth now can you imagine this here is
[1:48:39] the Son of God Jehovah God bottled up
[1:48:43] and confined in the body of Flesh with
[1:48:45] the power to change the scene at any
[1:48:47] moment if he wanted to he had the power
[1:48:49] he could just boom all of the soldiers
[1:48:52] gone dissipated I mean evaporated before
[1:48:54] his very eyes everyone that had stripped
[1:48:56] off his clothes humiliated him ripped
[1:48:57] out his beard beat him to a pulp he
[1:49:00] could have changed the scene but he did
[1:49:04] nothing he stood silent he was an
[1:49:07] adopted son it was the father's desire
[1:49:11] that he had to pay the price for
[1:49:12] somebody else so he did nothing he took
[1:49:15] the
[1:49:17] beating there's your adopted mature
[1:49:21] son see the calling of us now God
[1:49:25] wouldn't call you for this if it wasn't
[1:49:27] possible you know that right God can't
[1:49:29] ask for you to come or predestinate you
[1:49:31] into adoption of son and this is your
[1:49:32] course if it's not
[1:49:35] possible it's got to be possible God has
[1:49:38] made a way for the adoption of sons and
[1:49:41] he's got a custommade course for each of
[1:49:43] us and we're all on a customade path
[1:49:45] through life through disappointments
[1:49:47] discouragements uh ridicules rejections
[1:49:49] humiliations it's customade just to
[1:49:52] bring you to adoption it's beautiful
[1:49:54] it's the most beautiful
[1:49:56] thing now we can see the same parallel
[1:49:59] now for the Book of Joshua let's look
[1:50:02] Joshua 610 Joshua had commanded the
[1:50:06] people ye shall not shout nor make any
[1:50:09] noise with your voice neither shall any
[1:50:12] word proceed out of your mouth until the
[1:50:15] day I bid you to shout then you shall
[1:50:20] shout Joshua 6:16 and it came to pass
[1:50:23] at the seventh time when the priest blew
[1:50:25] the trumpets Joshua said unto the people
[1:50:27] shout for the Lord hath given you the
[1:50:29] city so the people shouted when the
[1:50:31] priest blew the trumpets and it came to
[1:50:32] pass when the people heard the sound of
[1:50:34] the trumpet that the people shouted with
[1:50:36] a great shout and the wall fell down
[1:50:38] flat so when Joshua the holy spirit said
[1:50:41] be quiet be silent they silence nothing
[1:50:46] and when he said okay now speak they
[1:50:48] spoke they
[1:50:51] shouted this is so deep right no it's
[1:50:55] very plain God hides his mysteries in
[1:50:58] very plain simple ways it's right before
[1:51:01] each and every one of us God is looking
[1:51:02] for subjected lives subjected Wills to
[1:51:05] his will where he says speak you speak
[1:51:07] when he says sit down be quiet you don't
[1:51:09] you sit down and be quiet even you could
[1:51:11] have the power to change the scene and
[1:51:12] you say nothing you could put that
[1:51:15] brother in his place you could put that
[1:51:17] sister right in her place you never
[1:51:18] should have acted like that and you
[1:51:20] could put her in her place and he says
[1:51:21] don't say a word
[1:51:23] you be kind you be sweet be loving you
[1:51:26] do good to her she's treating you bad
[1:51:27] now you go do something good for her see
[1:51:31] the adoption of sons now brother
[1:51:34] brandham see we're following the pattern
[1:51:36] now brother brandham
[1:51:38] 1961 a man said to me the other night
[1:51:40] brother bham if you will just compromise
[1:51:42] a little bit this great man Full Gospel
[1:51:44] man will take you and we'll furnish you
[1:51:46] an airplane and you can join our
[1:51:48] religion and you'll take you'll take
[1:51:50] this we'll take this gift to every major
[1:51:51] city in the world world and we will
[1:51:53] blast it forth if you'll just compromise
[1:51:55] just a little bit on your teaching he I
[1:51:58] said now you with a doctor's degree ask
[1:52:02] a servant of God to compromise on the
[1:52:04] word I can't even think of such a thing
[1:52:06] as that man no sir there's no compromise
[1:52:09] with me at all I believe what God's word
[1:52:11] teaches the coming of the Son of God I
[1:52:14] believe the baptism of the Holy Spirit I
[1:52:15] believe signs and wonders following the
[1:52:17] Believers that's exactly what God Said
[1:52:19] and that's what I stand by that's what I
[1:52:21] believe and I know it's the truth
[1:52:23] no one's going to get him to compromise
[1:52:25] you could shower him with any kind of
[1:52:26] worldly blessings you wanted to if the
[1:52:28] prophet of God wanted to he could have
[1:52:30] been the most popular man on the whole
[1:52:32] world who could have stood in front of
[1:52:35] him who he could have had it all but he
[1:52:37] was about his father's business he would
[1:52:40] only do what God commanded him to do he
[1:52:43] would not compromise when the word of
[1:52:45] God spoke he spoke and when the word of
[1:52:47] God was silent he was
[1:52:49] silent now it's the bride's turn
[1:52:53] here you go pergam and church age those
[1:52:56] in the bride only do his will no one can
[1:53:00] make them do otherwise they have thus
[1:53:03] sayith the Lord or they keep still they
[1:53:06] know that it has to be God in them doing
[1:53:08] the works fulfilling his word he did not
[1:53:10] complete his work while in his Earthly
[1:53:13] Ministry so now he works in and through
[1:53:15] the bride she has thus sayeth the Lord
[1:53:18] or she's silent she says nothing
[1:53:24] says nothing so see the pattern first
[1:53:27] the decision then you got to learn to be
[1:53:29] silent When God Says be silent you be
[1:53:31] silent then comes the sacrifice this is
[1:53:35] the tough one this is where rubber meets
[1:53:37] the road let's look at it with Jesus
[1:53:41] John 10:17 therefore doth my father love
[1:53:44] me because I Lay My Life down that I may
[1:53:48] take it up again no man taketh it from
[1:53:51] me but I lay it down myself I have power
[1:53:55] to lay it down and I have power to take
[1:53:57] it up again Isaiah 53 yet it pleased the
[1:54:02] Lord to bruise him he hath put him to
[1:54:05] grief and thou shalt make his soul an
[1:54:07] offering for sin he shall see his seed
[1:54:10] he shall prolong his days and the
[1:54:12] pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in
[1:54:14] his hand he shall see the travail of his
[1:54:16] soul and shall be satisfied by his
[1:54:19] knowledge shall the righteous servant
[1:54:21] justify many
[1:54:23] for he shall bear their
[1:54:26] iniquities brother bam says in the
[1:54:28] presence of God someone said when he was
[1:54:32] on the cross if thou be the Son of God
[1:54:34] come off the cross and prove that you're
[1:54:36] a Son of God he could have done
[1:54:39] it they paid him the greatest tribute
[1:54:42] that they ever had there but they didn't
[1:54:45] know it they said he saved others but
[1:54:48] himself he cannot save but if he would
[1:54:51] have saved himself he could could not
[1:54:52] have saved others he gave himself so
[1:54:56] that he could save
[1:54:59] others now sacrifice comes into view and
[1:55:03] we find brother bham said now to live
[1:55:05] your life for others is looking
[1:55:07] heavenbound right he said now don't live
[1:55:10] for the one that loves you and treats
[1:55:11] you good he said you live for the one
[1:55:13] that hates you and would kill you if
[1:55:17] they
[1:55:18] could he said now that's eternal life
[1:55:23] wow so you have to measure what we think
[1:55:25] we have sometimes with the Bible and the
[1:55:28] message of the hour do you love the one
[1:55:31] that hates you are you living your life
[1:55:33] in sacrifice to the one that would kill
[1:55:35] you if they had the
[1:55:38] opportunity that's what the prophet of
[1:55:40] God said is eternal life because that's
[1:55:42] Christ's life he lived his life for
[1:55:45] others he lived for the one that was
[1:55:46] ripping his beard out and beating him
[1:55:49] and humiliating that's who he was living
[1:55:51] for that's who we live for we live for
[1:55:54] somebody
[1:55:56] else I see adoption is a high calling
[1:55:59] guys I mean it's this is this is serious
[1:56:01] but this is what we're called unto the
[1:56:03] adoption of
[1:56:06] sons so we find here the parallel now in
[1:56:09] The Exodus Journey we find one who
[1:56:12] wasn't able to make the Sacrifice by the
[1:56:15] name of
[1:56:16] achen achen answered Joshua and said
[1:56:19] indeed I have sinned against God of
[1:56:21] Israel and thus thus and thus I have
[1:56:24] done when I saw Among The Spoils of the
[1:56:27] good goodly babish garments 200 shekles
[1:56:30] of silver and a wedge of gold and 50
[1:56:32] shekels of weight then I coveted them
[1:56:35] and I took them and behold they are hid
[1:56:37] in my Earth in the midst of my tent and
[1:56:39] the silver underneath of it and Joshua
[1:56:41] and all of Israel took Ain the son of
[1:56:44] Zariah the silver and the garments and
[1:56:46] the gold and his sons and his daughters
[1:56:48] and his oxen and his asses and his sheep
[1:56:51] and his tent and all that he had and he
[1:56:53] brought them into the valley of aor and
[1:56:55] Joshua said why hast thou troubled us
[1:56:58] the Lord shall trouble thee this day and
[1:57:00] all of Israel stoned him with stones and
[1:57:03] burned them with fire after they had
[1:57:05] stoned them with
[1:57:07] stones this is a man who believed the
[1:57:10] prophet believed his message left Egypt
[1:57:14] went through the Wilderness
[1:57:16] trials came into the land but testified
[1:57:19] he could not lay his will down for
[1:57:21] another
[1:57:22] couldn't lay his life down for somebody
[1:57:24] else's he loved himself so much that he
[1:57:27] was willing to sacrifice the word and
[1:57:29] his own family for his own filthy
[1:57:33] will if you live your life for yourself
[1:57:36] you're not the only one that will perish
[1:57:38] you're not the only one that suffers
[1:57:40] your wife suffers your children will
[1:57:42] suffer everything about you will
[1:57:44] eventually be destroyed because heavens
[1:57:46] and earth will pass away but God's word
[1:57:48] will never pass away and if I'm not
[1:57:50] going to pass away I've got to align
[1:57:52] myself with the word so this man could
[1:57:55] not go all the way couldn't pay the
[1:57:58] price now let's look at brother brandham
[1:58:01] standing in the Gap
[1:58:03] 1963 I let the sick people lay I want
[1:58:07] the Lord to tell me where to go and what
[1:58:09] to do and that was wrong see I had built
[1:58:11] myself up a complex because the people
[1:58:13] wouldn't hear my message and God forbid
[1:58:16] that I ever compare myself with the life
[1:58:18] of Moses but it's exactly what Moses did
[1:58:21] the people wouldn't listen to him when
[1:58:22] he come to deliver them so he just left
[1:58:25] them alone and went out in the
[1:58:26] wilderness but God turned him around for
[1:58:28] he had he had he had long forgot about
[1:58:31] the sufferings of the people and I know
[1:58:34] that one day this will cost me my life
[1:58:37] that's right it's going to but the truth
[1:58:40] is still going to be
[1:58:42] known brother brandham was willing to
[1:58:44] stand in the Gap suffer the persecution
[1:58:47] suffer the ridicule suffer the rejection
[1:58:49] for God and for his people so the people
[1:58:51] would be lost so now we find the bride
[1:58:56] very
[1:59:00] simple3 and he said unto them all if any
[1:59:02] man will come after me let him deny
[1:59:05] himself take up his cross daily and
[1:59:08] follow me for whosoever will save his
[1:59:10] life will lose it but whosoever will
[1:59:13] lose his life for my sake shall save
[1:59:19] it Romans 8:35 who shall separate us
[1:59:22] from the love of Christ shall
[1:59:24] tribulation distress persecution famine
[1:59:26] nakedness Peril or sword it is written
[1:59:29] for thy sake we are killed all the day
[1:59:33] long we are accounted as sheep for the
[1:59:36] slaughter nay in all these things we are
[1:59:39] more than conquerors through him that
[1:59:42] loved us you know this is not a Joel
[1:59:44] ostein style
[1:59:46] message I mean life is tough for a real
[1:59:50] True Believer it's difficult it's tough
[1:59:54] and I don't sugarcoat it it's not a
[1:59:56] flowery bed of
[1:59:58] ease see you have to love him so much
[2:00:01] more than your known natural life I I
[2:00:04] you know I said this a while ago you
[2:00:06] know value is determined by the price
[2:00:09] you're willing to pay for something so
[2:00:11] if you say this house across the street
[2:00:13] now to you um to the neighbor it's only
[2:00:16] worth 50,000 but to you it's worth
[2:00:18] $100,000 what's the house worth
[2:00:20] $100,000 because there's a person
[2:00:22] willing to pay the price to get the home
[2:00:25] now what price was Christ willing to pay
[2:00:28] to redeem
[2:00:29] you he was willing to give up everything
[2:00:32] now here's my question to you what price
[2:00:35] are you willing to pay for
[2:00:39] him see whatever price you're willing to
[2:00:41] pay determines what value he really is
[2:00:44] to
[2:00:45] you if he doesn't mean anything to you
[2:00:48] you will pay nothing for
[2:00:50] him the little bit of difficulty a
[2:00:53] little bit of not getting to do what you
[2:00:56] want you've just testified how much a
[2:01:00] value he is to you he's of no value to
[2:01:03] you I don't want to go to church I don't
[2:01:05] want to read my Bible I don't want to
[2:01:06] listen to The Prophet God I don't want
[2:01:07] to fellowship with them people it's fine
[2:01:10] you just showed to him how valuable he
[2:01:13] is to you he means nothing to you see
[2:01:17] value is always determined by the price
[2:01:19] you're willing to
[2:01:20] pay so if you're willing to give up your
[2:01:23] life you show he's of more value to you
[2:01:25] than your own natural life and that's
[2:01:29] the attitude of the Bride so many people
[2:01:31] want to say they're the
[2:01:33] bride um but the Bride is a very special
[2:01:36] group and she's a very rare bunch and
[2:01:39] the attitude and nature and life that LE
[2:01:42] she
[2:01:43] lives uh will be quite a display of the
[2:01:47] grace of God and the love of God that
[2:01:49] they have in their hearts they'll show
[2:01:51] the world how much they really love him
[2:01:53] because they're willing to suffer for
[2:01:54] his name's
[2:01:55] sake yeah so we look in Shalom
[2:02:01] 1964 he said suffering for the name's
[2:02:04] sake is just growing pains of his grace
[2:02:07] yeah suffering for his word see it's
[2:02:10] just growing pains of his grace yes sir
[2:02:13] remember that it's the grace of God that
[2:02:16] was given to you you know just as you
[2:02:18] grow in Natural Life your natural body
[2:02:20] it has pains while it's you know a leg
[2:02:22] leg pains arm pain because it's growing
[2:02:26] now he says now the sufferings that you
[2:02:27] endure as a Christian it's just the
[2:02:29] Growing Pains of his grace it's just
[2:02:32] part of the maturing process of a son
[2:02:35] and daughter of God so adoption is just
[2:02:37] plain painful I don't know how to tell
[2:02:39] you any other way it's not a great deep
[2:02:42] thought it's just painful you have to be
[2:02:44] willing to endure the pain Hebrews Jesus
[2:02:47] showed us this Hebrews 121 wherefore
[2:02:49] seeing we are compassed about by such a
[2:02:51] great cloud of witness says let us lay
[2:02:52] aside every weight and every sin that
[2:02:55] does so easily beset us and let us run
[2:02:58] with patience the race that is set
[2:03:00] before us looking unto Jesus the author
[2:03:04] and the finisher of our faith who for
[2:03:06] the joy that was set before him
[2:03:09] endured the cross despising the shame
[2:03:13] and is sat down at the right hand of the
[2:03:14] Throne of God this is your example this
[2:03:17] is one who endured a cross for someone
[2:03:19] else's sake he didn't have to go to the
[2:03:21] cross for himself
[2:03:22] he went to the cross for somebody else
[2:03:24] so then God turns to you and says who
[2:03:26] are you willing to go to the cross for
[2:03:28] you know the only way he could go to the
[2:03:31] cross and endure such contradiction of
[2:03:32] Sinners and humiliation and
[2:03:33] embarrassment was he had you on his
[2:03:36] mind who for the joy that was set before
[2:03:39] him brother bam said it was the joy of
[2:03:41] fellowship with you so he was willing to
[2:03:44] pay the ultimate price to restore
[2:03:46] fellowship with you that he once had
[2:03:48] that he wants to restore so then the
[2:03:50] question then becomes what price will
[2:03:53] you pay what will you endure you know
[2:03:55] sometime in the Christian Life you just
[2:03:57] have to
[2:03:58] endure you just got to endure it that
[2:04:01] means persevere deal with it just keep
[2:04:04] going bear the burden and keep bearing
[2:04:07] the cross like I've always said this if
[2:04:10] Bible says this it says take up your
[2:04:12] cross daily okay okay if you can't find
[2:04:16] your cross what path are you
[2:04:20] on like you can't find any cross there's
[2:04:24] nothing difficult for you to have to
[2:04:25] endure every day you wake up it's just I
[2:04:28] do what I want to do I don't have to
[2:04:30] subject myself to anybody I don't
[2:04:33] like I've always said that if you can't
[2:04:35] find the cross that you have to pick up
[2:04:37] I promise you you're on the wrong
[2:04:40] path if you find yourself on his path
[2:04:42] you'll find a cross nearby that you're
[2:04:44] going to pick up that's just the way the
[2:04:46] Christian Life goes there's a cross for
[2:04:49] each of us to carry
[2:04:53] so Hebrews
[2:04:55] 12:5 still okay right know I'm dropping
[2:04:58] a lot out there but it says seven
[2:05:00] sermons in one so I'm trying to go fast
[2:05:02] I'm sorry I just want to paint the
[2:05:04] picture and then Pastor you can go in
[2:05:05] and fill in all the details later so I
[2:05:08] just hit these high points here so
[2:05:10] Hebrews 12:5 it says ye have forgotten
[2:05:13] the exhortation when speak his unto us
[2:05:15] as son unto children my son despise not
[2:05:18] the chastening of the Lord nor faint
[2:05:20] when thou art rebuked of him for whom
[2:05:22] the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scores
[2:05:25] every son whom he receiveth he if ye
[2:05:29] endure chastening God deal with you as
[2:05:33] Sons for what son is he whom the father
[2:05:36] chasteneth not but if ye be without
[2:05:40] chastisement wherefore all are partakers
[2:05:43] then you are bastards and not
[2:05:46] Sons Sons are corrected when they do
[2:05:49] wrong and they're corrected hard
[2:05:53] sometimes spankings in life are hard
[2:05:56] really really painful I remember a story
[2:05:58] one time brother Brown tells in the
[2:06:00] great Shepherd he said there was a a
[2:06:01] shepherd He had a sheep and the Sheep
[2:06:04] was a mama sheep and good sheep followed
[2:06:06] followed the shepherd everywhere till
[2:06:08] one day it had a baby and it so consumed
[2:06:11] with this little baby lamb that it took
[2:06:14] its eyes off the shepherd but the BAM
[2:06:16] tells a story great Shepherd and he says
[2:06:18] he took his eyes off the shepherd and
[2:06:19] the shepherd kept watching them mom
[2:06:21] wouldn't listen to him kept wandering
[2:06:22] away farther and farther away from the
[2:06:24] flock he says okay so what did the
[2:06:26] shepherd do brother bam said the
[2:06:27] shepherd went down picked up the little
[2:06:29] baby lamb carried
[2:06:31] it now that mother lamb never took her
[2:06:35] eyes off the shepherd because something
[2:06:37] that she loved dearly was now in his
[2:06:39] hands he said you know sometimes God
[2:06:41] will take a little child from
[2:06:43] you take a loved one from your life he
[2:06:47] said sometimes God does those things we
[2:06:49] don't understand why some things happen
[2:06:51] like like that but God knows what he's
[2:06:53] doing like we got to stop questioning
[2:06:56] God and why he does what he does stay in
[2:06:58] this Wilderness journey and comp
[2:07:00] complain and murmur because things
[2:07:01] aren't going easy for us no it's all
[2:07:03] part of the process it's all part of the
[2:07:05] journey un
[2:07:06] adoption sometimes things are difficult
[2:07:09] that's the way it must
[2:07:12] be and I find this so you guys Farmers
[2:07:14] up here the last stage of a harvest is
[2:07:18] um up here you have combines right you
[2:07:19] have combine so so H you you think about
[2:07:22] this little corn or weed up there having
[2:07:24] a good day Sun's shining you know it's a
[2:07:26] nice day and all of a sudden this crazy
[2:07:28] combine comes through this combine comes
[2:07:31] through beats the tar out of that piece
[2:07:33] of wheat I mean knocks it all I think
[2:07:36] that's how you the only way you can do
[2:07:37] you got to beat the tar out of it right
[2:07:39] did you know that's part of a Christian
[2:07:40] Life too the adoption of sons there
[2:07:43] comes a time you're going to get the tar
[2:07:45] beat out of you and if you don't think
[2:07:48] that's scriptural let me show it to you
[2:07:50] brother brandham tells a little story
[2:07:52] about 6C Smith George Smith Brother bam
[2:07:56] used to be a
[2:07:57] boxer I love this God should this to he
[2:08:00] said I'm going to tell you Billy no
[2:08:02] matter how well- trained you are how
[2:08:04] athletic of an experience you have and
[2:08:06] how strong you are for your size it
[2:08:09] ain't nothing until a lick will stop the
[2:08:11] blood when it hits you he said you might
[2:08:14] hate me but when you get up there in the
[2:08:16] ring you'll appreciate it said your body
[2:08:19] will build up and be able to come back
[2:08:21] quickly
[2:08:22] if you get hit and just fall over you
[2:08:24] lay there and you take the count but if
[2:08:26] your body is built and can stand the
[2:08:29] licks then when you get hit hard licks
[2:08:33] real hard then you'll be able to come
[2:08:35] back quick and get back on your feet get
[2:08:38] knocked right out of the ring and then
[2:08:39] jump back in there he he had just got to
[2:08:43] go through it Plum knocked me out of the
[2:08:45] ring he said I have to do it he liked to
[2:08:49] kill me he was 35 lb heavier than I was
[2:08:53] he was a real fighter and I was just a
[2:08:55] student he was almost killing me he said
[2:08:57] but you'll appreciate it one day when
[2:08:59] you're in the ring and I found that to
[2:09:01] be the truth so what was the final stage
[2:09:05] of this Fighter for brother Bram he was
[2:09:08] well trained he was athletic and he was
[2:09:10] strong but he had to be able to take a
[2:09:13] punch sometimes in your Christian Life
[2:09:15] when you're coming into adoption and
[2:09:17] full maturity you just got to take the
[2:09:19] punch you got to be able to take the
[2:09:22] hard licks of Life they're going to hit
[2:09:25] you so hard sometimes but it's all a
[2:09:28] part of the training it's all a part of
[2:09:30] an adopted son's life some really hard
[2:09:33] licks and I don't know what those licks
[2:09:35] are only you know times exactly what God
[2:09:38] will hit you with maybe a sickness a
[2:09:40] lost loved one situation difficulty I
[2:09:43] don't know but there's some hard licks
[2:09:45] sometimes and you just got to learn to
[2:09:46] endure the hard licks remember Christ's
[2:09:49] mystery of God revealed Satan has A
[2:09:51] Punch Coming For You I don't care who
[2:09:54] you he don't don't care who you are he's
[2:09:58] got a right to that one punch which
[2:10:01] would you rather have it be blindness or
[2:10:03] an arthritic or be nervous he's got
[2:10:06] somewhere he's going to punch you he's
[2:10:08] got a right to that open place now
[2:10:11] that's the spot that you've got to keep
[2:10:12] covered over all the time we all have
[2:10:17] weaknesses I hope I'm not the only one
[2:10:20] you know what the weak wees were your
[2:10:22] greatest blessing in
[2:10:23] life if you had no weaknesses brother
[2:10:25] bham said it was this nervousness
[2:10:27] condition that I have that led me to
[2:10:28] Jesus Christ if you had no weaknesses
[2:10:31] you'd have no
[2:10:32] need ah we have a great need we have a
[2:10:35] debt that we could not pay we have
[2:10:37] weaknesses in our life that we can't
[2:10:38] overcome we have complexes difficulties
[2:10:40] scars pains that we've all gone through
[2:10:43] and they're all weaknesses Allowed by
[2:10:45] God to keep you dependent on him they're
[2:10:49] the greatest blessing if we'll actually
[2:10:50] look at week is from the right position
[2:10:53] and so now we went through the decisions
[2:10:56] to the silence the sacrifice and then
[2:10:58] just the reality that adoption is
[2:10:59] painful and you got to learn to take the
[2:11:01] punches it's the chastening of a son but
[2:11:05] then also the aspect of adoption is the
[2:11:07] placing of a son that you've all been
[2:11:09] born with gifts and callings from God
[2:11:11] you all have a place in the body we all
[2:11:15] have a place in the body God did not
[2:11:17] call us to be an adopted son and live
[2:11:20] all by ourselves separate from a body of
[2:11:22] Believers this is not scriptural it's
[2:11:25] not in the Bible because the body is a
[2:11:28] many membered body and everybody has
[2:11:31] their place their gift their position
[2:11:34] that they must come to and just like uh
[2:11:36] if we were fighting a battle if I'm
[2:11:38] fighting the enemy on this side I need
[2:11:40] someone covering my side on this side
[2:11:42] and someone needs to cover me on this
[2:11:44] side and who's going to cover me back
[2:11:46] here and you as a many many B body of
[2:11:49] Jesus Christ are covering for one
[2:11:50] another where you're weak he's strong
[2:11:53] where he's strong she's weak and
[2:11:55] everybody has a place in the body
[2:11:57] because you're serving each other you're
[2:12:00] not just serving yourself and that was
[2:12:03] part of the Joshua commission when he
[2:12:05] brought the children of Israel out of
[2:12:07] Egypt through the Wilderness journey
[2:12:09] through the chastisements through the
[2:12:10] silences of God bringing him into the
[2:12:13] position of the promised land what did
[2:12:16] Joshua do he said now you're going to be
[2:12:18] in that part of the land and you're
[2:12:20] going to go to this part of the land and
[2:12:22] you're going to cover this side if the
[2:12:24] enemy comes anywhere around we've got
[2:12:26] people everywhere we've got this place
[2:12:28] secure this is our promise word and this
[2:12:31] is your position and you're the people
[2:12:32] to cover that ground Joshua blessed him
[2:12:35] and gave Caleb the son of uh jhuna
[2:12:38] Hebron for an inheritance Joshua placed
[2:12:41] the people in their position you each
[2:12:43] one have gifts and callings from God
[2:12:46] nobody can take your place nobody can
[2:12:49] take your place and the devil convince
[2:12:51] you I can't I got nothing I can't do
[2:12:53] anything for God I've got no purpose
[2:12:56] just you being here just you saying Amen
[2:12:59] to the word of God just you helping to
[2:13:01] create an atmosphere can bless the
[2:13:03] person beside you you don't know what
[2:13:05] someone else is going through but see
[2:13:08] you're living your life for others
[2:13:09] you're you're sacrificing your own time
[2:13:11] your own energy your own Comfort to
[2:13:13] create an atmosphere for say a young
[2:13:15] person like do you love the young people
[2:13:17] more than you love yourself it's easy to
[2:13:19] stay home stream services
[2:13:21] well come sit create an atmosphere sing
[2:13:23] songs create an atmosphere of faith for
[2:13:25] somebody else to be able to receive the
[2:13:27] word and be born again and come to
[2:13:29] maturity see we are supposed to live for
[2:13:31] others and that's why it's a body
[2:13:33] Ministry and that's why part of becoming
[2:13:35] an adopted son is finding your position
[2:13:38] in the body of Christ everybody has a
[2:13:42] position brother bam said in adoption
[2:13:44] but when they were born they were
[2:13:46] positionally born into the kingdom of
[2:13:47] God and the Holy Ghost has set in the
[2:13:49] church some Apostles some some prophets
[2:13:52] some teachers some pastors some
[2:13:54] evangelists then he gives into them
[2:13:57] their speaking with tongues
[2:13:58] interpretation of tongues knowledges
[2:14:00] Gifts of wisdom Gifts of healing and all
[2:14:03] kinds where the church is now this is my
[2:14:06] purpose in doing this the church is
[2:14:07] always trying to take somebody else's
[2:14:09] corner but they don't but don't do that
[2:14:11] you can never raise corn in ephraim's
[2:14:13] corner if you're Manassa you see you
[2:14:16] have to take your place in Christ
[2:14:19] positionally everybody has their
[2:14:21] position but stay in your position stay
[2:14:24] right where God's called you to be do
[2:14:26] what God called you to
[2:14:27] do that's how a fful Ministry
[2:14:30] compliments each other you know they
[2:14:32] compliment each other they're not there
[2:14:33] condemning one another and say ah he
[2:14:35] can't pre you know this one should do
[2:14:37] this no my goodness my goodness no
[2:14:39] everybody the Evangelist needs the
[2:14:41] pastor the pastor needs the teacher the
[2:14:42] teacher needs the Apostle the Apostle
[2:14:44] needs the prophet it's all part of
[2:14:46] the out a while back I was sharing with
[2:14:48] by the day I hope it's okay but like I
[2:14:50] realized the five-fold ministry is all
[2:14:52] the aspects of a father Raising a
[2:14:54] Son because Ephesians 4 the five-fold
[2:14:57] ministry is given for the what
[2:14:59] perfecting of the Saints what is
[2:15:01] perfecting full maturity to come to full
[2:15:04] age to come to maturity so when you're
[2:15:06] raising your child you have son this is
[2:15:08] your son okay there's times when you uh
[2:15:11] he needs corrected you got to get out
[2:15:13] the rod of chastisement and it's time
[2:15:15] for a little uh stimulation by what the
[2:15:19] say protoplasmic stimulation
[2:15:21] gets it needs a spanking the boy just
[2:15:23] needs it but there's other times it's
[2:15:24] not time for spanking right sometimes
[2:15:27] you just got to put your arms sh and say
[2:15:29] it's going to be okay buddy don't worry
[2:15:30] it's going to be okay all is fine then
[2:15:32] there's other times you can't spank it's
[2:15:34] not a time to put your arms around him
[2:15:36] now you have to teach him a lesson you
[2:15:38] have to instruct him on something right
[2:15:40] then there's times that he grows older
[2:15:41] he just doesn't understand with the
[2:15:43] knowledge that he has he doesn't
[2:15:44] understand the situation so what do you
[2:15:46] got to do you got to take him up to see
[2:15:48] things from a little bit higher
[2:15:49] perspective what does the prophet do he
[2:15:51] lifts you up higher you're looking at
[2:15:53] things not right you need to come up
[2:15:55] higher and look down on the situation
[2:15:57] and see it as it is right and then the
[2:16:00] Apostle he's the missionary right he
[2:16:03] said we can do it there's times you can
[2:16:04] just say I'm not going to wrap you up
[2:16:05] and give you a hug I'm not going to
[2:16:06] teach you lesson it's not take you up
[2:16:08] higher it's to say you can do it just
[2:16:10] keep going just keep going right it's
[2:16:14] the all the aspects of a five-fold
[2:16:16] Ministry it's all the aspects of our
[2:16:18] heavenly father to help bring people to
[2:16:20] full maturity or the adoption of sons so
[2:16:23] people are cutting themselves off from a
[2:16:25] five-fold Ministry and they're
[2:16:26] paralyzing their own
[2:16:28] maturity they can't spiritually come to
[2:16:31] full maturity I didn't say that the
[2:16:33] Bible said that you don't have to take
[2:16:35] my word for it Ephesians 4 says it's
[2:16:39] there for the perfecting what is the
[2:16:41] perfecting the
[2:16:44] maturing of the saints of
[2:16:47] God you need the five-fold ministry and
[2:16:49] all of their weakness wies all of their
[2:16:52] failures we're all failures there's none
[2:16:54] great amongst us there's no great
[2:16:56] anybody but God God just chooes unlikely
[2:16:59] individuals with lots of broken uh
[2:17:01] broken pieces and uh broken up ways and
[2:17:05] weaknesses and complexes and all you
[2:17:07] know brother bah had a complex right you
[2:17:09] understand that right you understand big
[2:17:11] complexes nervousness even told his wife
[2:17:13] to lie one time made massive mistakes
[2:17:16] your Prophet was not perfect but he was
[2:17:19] perfect that's what made him perfect his
[2:17:22] imperfection made him perfect because in
[2:17:24] his weakness God's strength was made
[2:17:26] strong now what is the fivefold ministry
[2:17:28] they're weak but in their weakness his
[2:17:30] strength's made strong so then God uses
[2:17:32] the weakness of the five-fold ministry
[2:17:33] to what display the strength of God and
[2:17:36] bringing Saints unto full
[2:17:39] maturity you can't deny what the word
[2:17:44] says you're just hurting
[2:17:46] yourself so in the voice of the sign
[2:17:50] when God is called a person to a job
[2:17:52] there's no one else that can take your
[2:17:53] place there's just no one else that can
[2:17:55] do it you're each one set here in God's
[2:17:57] economy just for this place one fasts
[2:18:01] one communes another one will cast out
[2:18:03] Devils another one will just stay
[2:18:05] fasting that's the whole body of Christ
[2:18:07] working together in a Unity when we see
[2:18:10] the denominational barriers breaking us
[2:18:12] up that's what hurts my heart because
[2:18:15] see that's the thing that's always
[2:18:16] separating us there is no big people
[2:18:19] among us there's no great people among
[2:18:21] us we are all the same we're just the
[2:18:24] children of God there is only one great
[2:18:27] one amongst us and that's Christ no big
[2:18:30] preachers no big anybody just Sons and
[2:18:33] Daughters of God I'm just happy to be a
[2:18:35] part of you like I hope you understand
[2:18:37] it's like I don't need to preach I don't
[2:18:39] I happy I come up here just to have
[2:18:40] fellowship with you you know eat some
[2:18:42] good meals and sit down and hear the
[2:18:43] word of God I don't ever have to preach
[2:18:46] like I don't need to be preaching I'm
[2:18:48] happy to just be a part of the body of
[2:18:49] Jesus Christ hearing the word word being
[2:18:51] perfected by his grace I'm just a happy
[2:18:53] to be a part of it like that's why I've
[2:18:55] always told me I'm just happy to be here
[2:18:57] you don't understand what I went through
[2:18:59] I was never born and raised in this God
[2:19:00] in his Mercy came my
[2:19:02] way so 1 Corinthians chapters 12 just so
[2:19:07] that you can see it from the Bible for
[2:19:09] the body is not one
[2:19:12] member okay we'll stop right there I
[2:19:16] don't need a body I can live all by
[2:19:18] myself I can listen to the prophet of
[2:19:20] God and I don't have to have Fellowship
[2:19:21] Believers 1 Corinthians for the body is
[2:19:24] not one
[2:19:26] member but
[2:19:28] many
[2:19:30] o if the foot shall say because I am not
[2:19:33] the hand I am not the body is there
[2:19:35] therefore not of the body if the ear
[2:19:37] shall say because I am not the eye I am
[2:19:39] not of the body is there uh therefore
[2:19:41] not of the body if the whole body were
[2:19:43] an eye then where's the hearing if the
[2:19:45] whole body were the hearing where is the
[2:19:46] smelling but now hath God set members
[2:19:50] every one of them in the body now listen
[2:19:52] to this one as it hath pleased
[2:19:57] him and they say oh I would go but that
[2:20:00] person's
[2:20:01] there I don't care for that person now
[2:20:05] hold on God ha set in the church that
[2:20:09] person they're there because God set
[2:20:12] them
[2:20:13] there so maybe they're there for your
[2:20:17] perfecting or maybe you need to go there
[2:20:20] for their
[2:20:22] cares you know you can't complain about
[2:20:25] these things you got to start looking at
[2:20:27] things from the Bible's perspective we
[2:20:29] have been we we're bone of his bone life
[2:20:31] of his life power of his power word of
[2:20:33] his word we are him we do things
[2:20:36] according to the word of God not how we
[2:20:37] feel about things we stick with what the
[2:20:40] word says so the body is not one member
[2:20:42] many membered bride vastly different
[2:20:44] individuals different Natures different
[2:20:47] ideas on things your each home Sovereign
[2:20:50] right I have different ideas than my own
[2:20:52] Pastor brother Chad I submit myself to
[2:20:54] him because I love him as a pastor I
[2:20:55] know God has said him as a pastor and
[2:20:57] I'm so happy he's my pastor but we're
[2:21:00] different like we're different
[2:21:02] individuals I'm different from my wife
[2:21:04] she's very detailed I'm not she's very
[2:21:07] good at organizing I'm not really great
[2:21:08] with organizing things but I love her we
[2:21:11] compliment Each Other Well I think you
[2:21:12] think we compliment each other yeah
[2:21:14] okay see we needed each other she needed
[2:21:18] me there was something in me that she
[2:21:19] needed something I know I needed a lot
[2:21:21] of her most of all her I wouldn't be
[2:21:22] here today without her but that's the
[2:21:24] reality of it we need each other and as
[2:21:26] time goes on brother bam said you guys
[2:21:28] draw closer and closer and closer
[2:21:31] together he said don't let nothing get
[2:21:33] amongst you he said don't let any
[2:21:35] difference ever get amongst you to the
[2:21:37] point where you can't love each other CU
[2:21:39] we're going to have differences we're
[2:21:41] sometimes going to rub each other wrong
[2:21:42] your nature is going to be contradictory
[2:21:44] to another man's nature it's a
[2:21:47] many-membered bride God's a god of
[2:21:48] variety who you going to go compain
[2:21:50] playing to God and say God why'd you
[2:21:51] make that man that way cuz eventually in
[2:21:54] that argument you're going to have to
[2:21:54] shut your mouth because then you say who
[2:21:57] am I to question God for making that man
[2:21:59] what he is today and then you have to
[2:22:01] sometimes ask it about yourself
[2:22:02] sometimes you get frustrated with
[2:22:03] yourself why' you make me this way God
[2:22:05] then you have to say no Lord I'm
[2:22:06] fearfully and wonderfully made you made
[2:22:08] me for a purpose to fulfill a job that
[2:22:10] only I could fulfill I am me because no
[2:22:14] one else could be me no one else could
[2:22:16] fulfill this role that you've called me
[2:22:17] to it may just be prayer you see what he
[2:22:21] said someone praying someone fasting
[2:22:23] someone singing a song Someone preaching
[2:22:25] someone creating an atmosphere it's not
[2:22:28] always
[2:22:29] preaching it's everybody in their
[2:22:31] position makes the whole unit work
[2:22:33] together as one cylinder all in harmony
[2:22:36] with each other and then you watch what
[2:22:38] God will do amongst you that's the
[2:22:40] reality of it you love each other and
[2:22:42] just pull up a little closer as time
[2:22:44] goes
[2:22:46] on oh boy man we've went a while I
[2:22:49] better beat it up
[2:22:51] so okay all right okay okay he said good
[2:22:55] so I said
[2:22:56] okay brother the Dale said good keep
[2:22:58] going right keep going okay okay we keep
[2:23:00] going now I want to bring in the
[2:23:01] witnesses of adoption I told you this is
[2:23:03] seven parts and I'm not even done I mean
[2:23:05] it's say clo so I want to bring in the
[2:23:07] witnesses of adoption now this may sound
[2:23:10] interesting but it's right out of your
[2:23:12] Bible and you'll find out I think with
[2:23:14] more clarity what this age is all about
[2:23:17] now brother bam says and hear ye him he
[2:23:20] says now God is going to do something
[2:23:21] great and so when he does he brings
[2:23:24] forth Peter James and John we'll just
[2:23:26] call them faith hope and charity the
[2:23:29] three great gifts of God take Peter for
[2:23:32] Faith James for Hope and John's always
[2:23:34] love which is Charity he takes this
[2:23:37] faith hope and charity with him as he
[2:23:39] goes up into the mountain because he is
[2:23:41] fixing to do something he's going to
[2:23:43] make a great expression and he wants it
[2:23:45] to be confirmed he always confirms it
[2:23:49] with three Witness
[2:23:51] two or three Witnesses the Old Testament
[2:23:52] statement is in the mouth of two or
[2:23:54] three Witnesses let every word be
[2:23:56] established now watch where I'm going he
[2:23:59] goes up into the mountain calling these
[2:24:01] three men three outstanding gifts of the
[2:24:04] people that was with him they bring him
[2:24:06] up into the mountain then he has three
[2:24:09] Heavenly beings some something must
[2:24:12] going to take place see there's three
[2:24:14] Earthly Witnesses and there's three
[2:24:16] Heavenly Witnesses there's Moses Elijah
[2:24:20] and Jesus transfigured or transformed
[2:24:22] and there's Peter James and John the
[2:24:26] Earthly and the Heavenly all meeting
[2:24:29] together now think of this now the Bible
[2:24:32] says out of the mouth of two or three
[2:24:33] witnesses that every word be established
[2:24:35] now a witness you would say we we use
[2:24:37] the word Witnesses if we're going to
[2:24:38] have a court case a judgment right now
[2:24:41] in a court case uh prosecution and
[2:24:44] defense will both produce what Witnesses
[2:24:46] they both will produce witnesses to
[2:24:48] prove their case right that's the
[2:24:50] reality of it anybody to prove their
[2:24:51] case produces Witnesses right you have
[2:24:53] to have a witness now when they were
[2:24:55] trying to uh condemn Jesus Christ they
[2:24:58] could they gathered false Witnesses
[2:25:00] because even then that corrupt court
[2:25:02] that kangaroo court that was trying to
[2:25:04] persecute Jesus Christ had to get
[2:25:06] witnesses to be able to pass judgment
[2:25:09] but they couldn't get their witnesses to
[2:25:11] agree the Bible says they couldn't get
[2:25:13] their witnesses to agree but we have
[2:25:15] faith hope and charity and these three
[2:25:17] Witnesses are an agreement and these are
[2:25:19] the Earthly Witnesses of an adopted son
[2:25:22] now think of this for a second the
[2:25:24] Earthly Witnesses of an adopted son is
[2:25:27] faith hope and
[2:25:30] charity a mature son has Faith a mature
[2:25:34] son hopes when it doesn't look like
[2:25:37] there's anything worth hoping for a
[2:25:38] mature son has charity loves a love that
[2:25:43] endures that's patient that's kind
[2:25:46] that's
[2:25:47] courteous that's charity
[2:25:50] real charity an adopted son has that
[2:25:53] witness saying yes this is an adopted
[2:25:55] son see I'm charity and I'm witnessing
[2:25:58] that this is an adopted son see this
[2:26:00] adopted son has Faith to overcome any
[2:26:03] situation because he knows God can't
[2:26:05] fail God keeps his word I don't care how
[2:26:08] smart you are I don't care how much you
[2:26:10] understand you know faith is a witness
[2:26:12] in your life as an adopted son because
[2:26:14] whatever God says you say amen that's
[2:26:16] the truth like sister hadie right I
[2:26:19] don't think she was the most
[2:26:20] intellectual one there she just said
[2:26:22] that ain't nothing but the truth brother
[2:26:23] brandom and she's her she was the right
[2:26:26] woman who said the right thing in the
[2:26:28] presence of the right person and God
[2:26:30] confirmed knowing she would ask for the
[2:26:32] right thing the third poll manifested on
[2:26:35] this woman the first time the third pole
[2:26:37] manifested was to her because she had
[2:26:40] faith in what the prophet said she just
[2:26:42] believed what he said was the truth so
[2:26:44] faith is a true witness of an adopted
[2:26:46] son charity is a true witness and hope
[2:26:49] is also witness for an adopted son now
[2:26:52] those three Witnesses are the Earthly
[2:26:54] Witnesses but there's three Heavenly
[2:26:56] witnesses as well Moses was resurrected
[2:26:59] they disputed they couldn't find Moses's
[2:27:01] body the devil was angry he says Hey
[2:27:03] where's Moses guys he disputed with
[2:27:06] Michael the Archangel where's Moses
[2:27:08] we've been looking for him for days no
[2:27:09] one of my demons can find Moses why
[2:27:11] Moses was resurrected now Elijah's there
[2:27:15] standing with Jesus who was Elijah
[2:27:16] representing the raptured Chariot of
[2:27:19] fire come down and rapturing and what
[2:27:20] was Jesus the word transfigured an
[2:27:23] adopted son where what did Brother bam
[2:27:25] said he said Earth and Heaven were
[2:27:27] uniting again heavens and earth were
[2:27:29] uniting what is an adopted son he's
[2:27:32] being lifted up out of this AR Earthly
[2:27:35] identification finding his Heavenly
[2:27:37] identification what did Brother brandham
[2:27:39] say in his final sermon in the communion
[2:27:41] I am not the son of Charles and Ella
[2:27:43] Branham I am a Son of God he had come
[2:27:46] back into true communion a true Oneness
[2:27:49] he knew who he was and where he came
[2:27:51] from and that's what we sometimes are
[2:27:53] struggling to understand we still have
[2:27:54] these elements of spiritual Amnesia we
[2:27:56] don't really know who we are we're
[2:27:57] trying to find our identification in
[2:27:59] work trying to find our identification
[2:28:00] with certain set of friends or in
[2:28:02] success or this or that and you realize
[2:28:04] the greatest identification you can have
[2:28:06] is a Son of God a daughter of God there
[2:28:09] is nothing of Greater importance to you
[2:28:11] than just to be his son hallelujah it's
[2:28:14] nothing more there's not you you've
[2:28:16] already achieved the greatest thing
[2:28:17] possible to just be a son of God a
[2:28:20] daughter of God there's no higher
[2:28:22] calling in life it's amazing these it
[2:28:26] Witnesses must all be on
[2:28:29] display now remember Witnesses are
[2:28:31] called before a judge
[2:28:33] now brother brandham goes into this in
[2:28:37] the Life Magazine see Life Magazine
[2:28:39] packed it this mystical circle of light
[2:28:42] goes up in the air of Tucson Phoenix in
[2:28:45] the same way that I told you nearly a
[2:28:46] year before it happened how it would be
[2:28:49] like a triangle the picture hangs in the
[2:28:51] church down there you that took the
[2:28:54] magazine has it there it was just
[2:28:56] exactly they said it's 27 miles high and
[2:28:59] 30 mil across they don't understand what
[2:29:02] happened it happened mysteriously and
[2:29:05] went away
[2:29:06] mysteriously brother Fred sofman brother
[2:29:09] Jee Norman and I were standing there
[2:29:13] three as a witness like he took up to
[2:29:16] the Mount Peter James and John to give
[2:29:19] witness that stood there and watched
[2:29:21] what had happened now let's recreate the
[2:29:23] situation for a moment there's Jesus
[2:29:26] Mount Transfiguration there's three
[2:29:28] Earth Earthly witnesses that went up
[2:29:29] with him Peter James and John now a
[2:29:31] cloud descends and Jesus is caught up
[2:29:34] into the cloud and Moses and Elijah the
[2:29:37] raptured and the redeemed or the
[2:29:40] resurrected and the raptured they
[2:29:42] present Jesus's figure changes he's
[2:29:44] transformed he's glorified State now and
[2:29:47] a voice cries out and says this is my my
[2:29:50] son hear ye
[2:29:52] him now in 1963 the prophet of God is
[2:29:56] bringing up Life Magazine he's saying
[2:29:58] now three as a witness we went up on the
[2:30:00] mountain and a cloud came and I got
[2:30:03] caught up into the
[2:30:05] cloud and he said hey this one seemed a
[2:30:08] little bit more to me than the other
[2:30:10] ones this theophany and what made up the
[2:30:13] white wig angels and brother Benham said
[2:30:16] one man can represent an entire church
[2:30:19] age so you had the seven Angel
[2:30:21] Messengers in making up the cloud of
[2:30:24] Christ the head of Christ what were they
[2:30:26] representing the
[2:30:28] resurrected of the ages of the last
[2:30:30] 2,000 the entire bride was represented
[2:30:32] in Christ Jesus when John looked at the
[2:30:34] seven golden candlesticks he saw one
[2:30:36] liken to the son of man gab about to the
[2:30:37] pasts what is it Christ in Bride form so
[2:30:40] brother brandom gets caught up he sees
[2:30:41] the seven angels around him he says what
[2:30:43] is this I've been caught up into this
[2:30:45] what is this cloud and what is this age
[2:30:48] it's the age of adoption
[2:30:52] this is way more than just God sent a
[2:30:54] Prophet this is way more than just a
[2:30:56] cloud of vindication the Vindication is
[2:30:59] the resurrected lives coming to full
[2:31:01] maturity what a resurrection that was
[2:31:04] what a resurrection that this is being
[2:31:06] quickened and be made alive in Christ
[2:31:08] Jesus quickened caught up into Christ
[2:31:11] understanding who we are where we came
[2:31:13] from the mystery of Christ coming into
[2:31:15] Plain
[2:31:18] View thank you
[2:31:21] God hides in Simplicity it's just hidden
[2:31:24] in
[2:31:24] simplicity so this Earthly witness Faith
[2:31:27] who through faith subdued kingdoms
[2:31:29] wrought righteousness obtained promises
[2:31:32] stopped the mouth of lions quenched the
[2:31:34] violence of fire escaped the edge of the
[2:31:36] sword and out of weakness were made
[2:31:37] strong waxed violent violent in fight
[2:31:40] and turned the Flight of the Aries to
[2:31:42] the aliens uh they were stoned they were
[2:31:45] saw asunder they were tempted they were
[2:31:47] slain with a sword they wandered about
[2:31:48] in sheep skins and goat they were
[2:31:50] desolate Afflicted and tormented of whom
[2:31:52] the world was not worthy they wandered
[2:31:55] in deserts and in mountains and in dens
[2:31:57] and in caves of the earth and these all
[2:31:59] having obtained a good report through
[2:32:02] faith received not the promise God
[2:32:04] having provided some better thing for us
[2:32:07] that they without us are not made
[2:32:11] perfect they're waiting for us the last
[2:32:15] 2,000 years and seven other Church ages
[2:32:18] and all the bride for the last 2 th000
[2:32:20] years is waiting for us to come to what
[2:32:22] Perfection what is perfection full
[2:32:25] maturity full
[2:32:27] maturity that's what they're waiting on
[2:32:31] that's what this age is here to
[2:32:32] accomplish the adoption of sons hope
[2:32:36] Jeremiah 17 says blessed is the man that
[2:32:38] trusteth in the Lord whose hope is in
[2:32:40] the Lord you don't put your hope in the
[2:32:42] government you don't put your hope in
[2:32:44] your retirement you don't put your hope
[2:32:46] in your insurance package you don't put
[2:32:47] your insur uh hope in how much money you
[2:32:49] got in the bank or your family or your
[2:32:52] daddy's money or anything my hope is in
[2:32:55] the
[2:32:55] Lord that's where my hope lies there's
[2:32:58] an adopted son he puts his hope in the
[2:33:00] right things and then we know charity
[2:33:03] everybody knows charity charity suffers
[2:33:05] long it's kind there a nothing worse I
[2:33:08] can find than it's just a a not nice
[2:33:11] Christian you know you may not have
[2:33:14] 10,000 converts but you could smile when
[2:33:16] you go to the grocery store you could
[2:33:18] conduct brother bam said this he said
[2:33:20] conduct yourself with joy in the midst
[2:33:22] of the trials that he sees fit to bring
[2:33:25] your
[2:33:26] way be
[2:33:28] happy we should be the happiest kindest
[2:33:32] sweetest people that have ever walked
[2:33:34] the Earth the Bride of Jesus Christ she
[2:33:36] should be able to love like no one else
[2:33:38] can love if anybody could find sympathy
[2:33:40] in someone's eyes it should be you it
[2:33:43] should be you yeah that's what I always
[2:33:46] loved about Jesus they always mocked him
[2:33:47] and ridiculed him and he was friends
[2:33:48] with all the prostitutes and the
[2:33:50] publicans and the worldly people they
[2:33:51] all loved him he must have treated him
[2:33:53] really sweet must have been gentle and
[2:33:55] kind understood why maybe they were in
[2:33:57] the situation that they were in he was
[2:34:02] compassionate so charity never
[2:34:06] fails so Romans uh or Romans 8:1 17-18
[2:34:12] and if a child then HS with God and join
[2:34:14] airs with Christ if we suffer with him
[2:34:16] that we may also be glorified together
[2:34:19] for I re that the sufferings of this
[2:34:20] present time are not worthy to be
[2:34:22] compared with the glory which shall be
[2:34:25] revealed in us remember you're
[2:34:26] predestinated unto adoption Justified
[2:34:29] makes way for sanctification
[2:34:31] sanctification makes way for baptism
[2:34:33] Holy Spirit baptism holy spirit makes
[2:34:34] way for the person of him of the word
[2:34:36] himself to come into VI whom he's
[2:34:38] Justified he sanctify him who he
[2:34:40] Sanctified he's already what
[2:34:42] glorified and what is glorification
[2:34:44] Jesus said glorify me father with the
[2:34:47] glory that I had with thee from before
[2:34:48] the foundation of the world he said I
[2:34:50] have glorified it and I will what
[2:34:53] glorify it again I will glorify it again
[2:34:56] how in you how was he glorified he did
[2:35:00] the father's will he was nailed to a
[2:35:03] cross as an adopted son he wasn't about
[2:35:06] his business he was about the father's
[2:35:08] business what will the bride be in his
[2:35:10] very own image not doing her will his
[2:35:13] will not trying to defend herself
[2:35:15] protect herself she lives her life for
[2:35:16] others as an adopted son we're almost
[2:35:19] done
[2:35:20] I have to skip a couple
[2:35:22] pages
[2:35:24] so I wanted to pose this question to you
[2:35:27] in light of what we've said here as the
[2:35:30] purpose of this age is bringing children
[2:35:32] into adoption um there's a portion of
[2:35:35] word in Acts 1 18 it says when Jesus
[2:35:39] said this he said but ye shall receive
[2:35:41] power after the Holy Ghost is come upon
[2:35:43] you what was that power brother bam said
[2:35:47] he said it was power for service not
[2:35:50] just power to raise the dead speak in
[2:35:51] tongues no it was power to live the
[2:35:53] Christian Life to Live the Life that he
[2:35:56] lived the holy spirit is given to you
[2:35:58] for power for service and ye shall be
[2:36:01] Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem to
[2:36:04] Judea Samaria and to the uttermost parts
[2:36:05] of the earth and when he had thus spoken
[2:36:08] these things while they beheld he was
[2:36:10] taken up and a cloud received him out of
[2:36:13] their sight and while they looked
[2:36:14] steadfastly toward Heaven as he went up
[2:36:17] behold two men stood by them in white
[2:36:21] apparel which also said ye men of
[2:36:24] Galilee why stand ye here gazing this
[2:36:28] same Jesus which is taken up from you
[2:36:31] unto Heaven shall so come in like manner
[2:36:34] as you have seen him go into heaven so
[2:36:38] that's my
[2:36:39] question having heard all that we've
[2:36:41] heard today why stand you here gazing
[2:36:45] sometimes we look what is this message
[2:36:47] what's it all about why is it in the way
[2:36:50] it's why is the difficulties why the why
[2:36:53] the conflicts amongst churches why can
[2:36:55] nobody get along with nobody am I the
[2:36:58] only one that's asked the
[2:37:00] question could it be we haven't moved on
[2:37:02] into
[2:37:03] adoption have we maybe not fully realize
[2:37:06] what that cloud represented what it was
[2:37:08] all about it was the father coming down
[2:37:11] making a public declaration these are my
[2:37:13] children sir hear ye them hear ye them
[2:37:18] they represent me I have confidence in
[2:37:21] them they'll speak when I tell them to
[2:37:23] speak and they'll be silent when I tell
[2:37:25] them to be silent they have their
[2:37:27] Witnesses speaking on their behalf they
[2:37:28] have faith they have hope they have
[2:37:31] charity they're all in View for the
[2:37:32] world to see see that cloud is the
[2:37:35] adoption of children we were
[2:37:37] predestinated to this age and they
[2:37:41] without us are not made perfect because
[2:37:43] they're waiting for our adoption so
[2:37:46] these things must come into view and I
[2:37:48] think at times we have to say what are
[2:37:50] we looking at what is this all about
[2:37:52] what's been going on and what is my role
[2:37:55] now what do I do now having seen what
[2:37:59] great calling God has called us
[2:38:02] to musicians will you come will you
[2:38:05] stand with me I apologize for so much in
[2:38:08] such a little time I hope uh you're okay
[2:38:11] with that I just delivered my soul and
[2:38:14] hit some high points I I feel a little
[2:38:16] bit bad because so every one of these
[2:38:18] literally I could go an hour on and I
[2:38:21] just tried to cover seven aspects of
[2:38:24] these adopted
[2:38:26] Sons I'd like to close with this thought
[2:38:28] brother bham said in the resume of the
[2:38:30] ages brother bam says not for one moment
[2:38:32] do I bring a message to the people that
[2:38:34] they may follow me or to join my church
[2:38:37] or to start a fellowship or an
[2:38:39] organization I have never done that and
[2:38:42] I will never do that now I have no
[2:38:44] interest in those things but I do have
[2:38:47] an interest in the things of God and
[2:38:48] people and if I can accomplish just one
[2:38:52] thing I will be
[2:38:54] satisfied and that one thing is to see
[2:38:56] established a true spiritual
[2:38:59] relationship between God and Men where
[2:39:02] men live as New Creations in Christ
[2:39:05] filled with his Spirit living according
[2:39:07] to his word I invite you and plead and
[2:39:11] warn all of you by the hearing of this
[2:39:13] voice yield your lives completely to him
[2:39:17] even as I trust in my heart that I have
[2:39:19] given my all to him God bless you and
[2:39:22] may his coming Rejoice your
[2:39:25] heart brother bham never preached so
[2:39:28] that he could have people listen to him
[2:39:30] or have a big church no true Minister I
[2:39:32] think ever ministers so that people
[2:39:34] would uh think well of him or come to
[2:39:36] his church or have a big F A true
[2:39:38] minister of God just wants to see the
[2:39:40] word of God living and thriving in a
[2:39:43] person's heart and and I want it for me
[2:39:45] I I I don't I don't even I I that's for
[2:39:48] me I you know what I love about
[2:39:49] preaching the most is the time I get set
[2:39:52] aside alone with God to study the word
[2:39:54] because I find in the time I'm spending
[2:39:56] with him it changes me just the alone
[2:39:58] time it's my favorite part of preaching
[2:40:00] when you ask me I get nervous about
[2:40:02] standing here but I love the couple days
[2:40:04] before as my mind is just stayed on the
[2:40:06] Lord and I'm looking through the
[2:40:07] scriptures and he takes me from one
[2:40:09] thing to another thing and this opens up
[2:40:11] and this opens up it's the thrill of my
[2:40:13] whole life it's just to see the word
[2:40:15] opening up before me as it begins to
[2:40:17] open it up to my eyes and that is my
[2:40:19] heart desire for each and every one of
[2:40:20] you is that honestly that that true
[2:40:23] spiritual relationship that God desires
[2:40:24] to have with you will be established in
[2:40:26] you and you can see what he's calling
[2:40:28] you unto he wants to be able to put you
[2:40:31] before all menlu say ah this is my boy I
[2:40:35] want the whole world to know this is my
[2:40:37] boy he's just like me just like me I'm
[2:40:41] proud of him and I'm happy to be
[2:40:43] identified with my son that's what he
[2:40:45] wants for each and every one of us will
[2:40:48] you just bow your heads for word our
[2:40:49] prayer as we
[2:40:52] close Heavenly Father we just come
[2:40:55] before you so thankful for this day
[2:40:57] thank you Lord for your word lord it's
[2:41:00] so real it's so
[2:41:01] alive Lord we're not looking at a
[2:41:03] history book or some Fable from years
[2:41:05] ago we're looking at a living reality of
[2:41:08] a living word being made manifested
[2:41:10] before our eyes and father your Prophet
[2:41:13] said let it first start in the mind then
[2:41:15] drop into the heart and they be
[2:41:16] manifested in the lives of your children
[2:41:19] and father father God I pray that we've
[2:41:21] brought the word before your children
[2:41:22] today I believe Lord and I pray that it
[2:41:25] was just the spiritual food and due
[2:41:27] season Lord I pray that we would take it
[2:41:29] into our hearts and meditate and chew on
[2:41:31] these things and Lord may they take root
[2:41:34] in our hearts and lives and may it bring
[2:41:36] into view a reality of a Son of God into
[2:41:39] view for the whole world to see father
[2:41:41] where we failed you and we all have
[2:41:43] failed you lord your Prophet said we all
[2:41:46] make big mistakes I pray Lord that You'
[2:41:49] forgive us for those big mistakes that
[2:41:51] we make sometimes father we pursue our
[2:41:53] own will we do what we want we don't
[2:41:56] like uncomfortable things we sometimes
[2:41:59] try to separate ourselves from painful
[2:42:01] situations or painful people father
[2:42:04] that's not right I pray Lord that the
[2:42:06] reality of eternal life would begin to
[2:42:08] express in us a life that lives for
[2:42:10] others a life that's kind a life that's
[2:42:14] full of joy happiness Lord May these
[2:42:17] things that we speak about they see seem
[2:42:19] so common but that the real elements of
[2:42:22] eternal life may they be in view for all
[2:42:24] the world to see in each of us father I
[2:42:27] pray for every young person here every
[2:42:29] old person may Lord we draw closer to
[2:42:32] you and Lord I know that's burning in my
[2:42:35] heart and I believe it's burning in
[2:42:36] their hearts and Lord if it's a deep
[2:42:38] calling there must be more deep to
[2:42:40] respond to it father I commit the pastor
[2:42:42] we we thank you for the pastor of this
[2:42:45] church brother Dale Lord what a blessing
[2:42:47] it is to have a pastor that cares for
[2:42:49] the the people I pray Lord that you'd
[2:42:51] continually bless him bless his ministry
[2:42:53] bless his life and his wife and his
[2:42:55] family bless this church May every
[2:42:57] person Lord be anointed of the Holy
[2:43:00] Ghost to fulfill their position be in
[2:43:02] their role and their post of Duty Lord
[2:43:04] may it all beat together as a like a
[2:43:06] Harmony father amongst the people like a
[2:43:08] great composition everybody playing

[2:43:15] singing everyone creating an atmosphere
[2:43:18] for each other always encouraging
[2:43:20] uplifting doing what we can to protect
[2:43:23] and going out after each of us when we
[2:43:25] see one in Fault may we go after them
[2:43:26] but there's too much love in a heart to
[2:43:28] let them get away Lord May the love of
[2:43:30] God be spoken amongst these people as
[2:43:33] the scriptures say this is how all men
[2:43:35] will know that you're my disciples
[2:43:37] they'll have love one for the other see
