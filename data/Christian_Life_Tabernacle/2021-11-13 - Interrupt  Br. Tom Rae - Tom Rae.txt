Description:
Interrupt 
Br. Tom Rae
Saturday Evening Service: November 13, 2021.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

hamburgers and hot dogs and everything and you can just go down there and finish it up after service amen but right now we want to feed on something else you know it was back in i thought you know last november and then i got to thinking it was in november before that so it's been two years since we've had our meeting and you know i remember something that was i heard a statement that brother branham made very early when i first came into the message he said the best place to find the lord jesus is where you left him you know go back to where you left him and so i got to thinking about our meeting and i thought lord where did we leave off at you know two years ago where were we at and what were we doing so i thought in my heart that i just wanted to pick up where we left off [Music] two years just ago it right up [Music] keep marching [Music] got sister joanne with us he was with us two years ago brother tom my good friend was preaching the word you know satan can strike at us but he can't keep this body down this body is designed to resurrect all i can tell you all about how we're here in the earth and we're coming out of here amen let's stand together two years ago brother tom was seeing me here and we worshiped them together let's just worship the lord i know he's here but let's just lift our praises up to them and worship as we invite our brand the lord and we invite our friend to come minister the word [Music] everything [Music] me me uh [Music] with me glorified foreign [Music] [Music] oh [Music] he'll give you everything let us foreign the lord every day and now never ending praise may our insane lay [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] hallelujah [Music] hallelujah let's just lift off our hearts lift up our hearts and lift up our voices [Music] lord we love your presence we love your people we love your word and we're so thankful that we could gather tonight around the great unveiling of god [Music] my mother's brother david said let's just go back go go back for some of us this prophet said now i lay me down to sleep go back to a little boy little girl maybe we left off somewhere lord but whether we are a poor man or a poor woman [Music] or call on the name of the lord jesus christ you meet the needy and we are needy people lord needy of your word to minister deep within our souls tonight so we just pray lord as we take the word that you will break it remove the man [Music] and let the word be proclaimed we thank you for this work here lord that i've so loved over the years brother david sister leslie the family and the family of god have been such a part of my life in joann's life thank you for them lord it means so much to me so now as we turn to the word we've had some wonderful worship wonderful songs the atmosphere's been created now i pray that the word of god will find an entrance to every heart this evening not one of us would go home lord without saying truly the lord jesus has spoken to me along the way we commit the evening to you in jesus name amen amen god bless you all nice to see you nice to be here so enjoyed last night brother burley amen i'll tell you what i just said you know this morning i saw him for breakfast or a little bit and i said you know the prophet preached token and he didn't quite finish his message so that evening he preached desperation but he says can i just cover what i missed this morning so i thought well maybe we'll just let brother burley cover what he missed last night but nobody took the offer and thus here i is so thank you brother david for your friendship your love for allowing me to sit and stand and be with you means so much to me i die demon always an honor to speak to the redeemed of god and we don't we don't preach to be the people down we preach the minister to lift you up edify you in christ build you up in the faith and tonight we're just going to take a little subject build a little bit upon it maybe the lord holy spirit will take us tomorrow morning but uh you know me you get what you see and that's all you get we just want the lord to take over the rest okay it's nice to see you brother mark tj thank you and that being here joseph you're here different ones that have come always feel very humbled so please let's turn to our bibles a number of places in the scriptures i'd like to take a look at i might title this little message tonight interrupt it simple word from simple man love the lord love this message just get interrupted you know forget who's beside you lord you can interrupt me so the son of man came remember he interrupted zacchaeus's life maybe zach kia's here tonight try why don't you try climbing let's send a man come to your house come to feast with you saint luke chapter 6 saint luke chapter 6. we'll take an overall view and then we'll take a take an individual view hear the scripture tonight luke chapter 6 verse 17 and the bible reads and he came down with them he's talking about the apostles and they are mentioned in verses before he came down with them and he stood in the plane and the company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of all judea and jerusalem came from the seacoast tire and saddam which came to hear him came to be healed of their diseases and they that were vexed with unclean spirits what does the bible say they were healed they came with an expectation and god met that expectation they didn't come to gawk they didn't come to look they didn't come just to see what was going on there is actually a need within them and god was able to meet that need and they came from all over the place so you can look around the room tonight and say well we come from all over the place but where's jesus and i want to say jesus is here jesus is here your bible my bible says in hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same today forever and just a quick look at the message brother brown says it over three thousand times i would say that he's trying to get a point across that he's just not the god of yesterday or a god of the future i want to tell you he's a god that is here right now and he's here to deliver he's here to save he's here to heal he's here to do exceedingly and abundantly more than you can ask or think i'm not here to show you or tell you how much i know in my gray matter because i don't have much great math i got a big heart and i love the lore i love him so it's bible says he didn't hear some of them he healed them all and i would love it from here from gary to all the way in the back that we could go to the house of god tonight with our hands lifted up glorifying the king of glory and saying that same god that they met on the plane is the same god that met me at church and delivered us from everything amen amen we're not playing church we're finished playing church we are the church and we're going forward we're going to show a dying world that god interrupts his redeemed god interrupts only his seed he'll let serpent seed go its way but he will not let the elect go their way he will interrupt their lives he will meet your every need how many got a need tonight amen remember there's a church that did not have a need in laodicea they had needed nothing blind miserable naked and didn't know it needed nothing but we're needy people needy of god to interrupt our lives take us from a lukewarm person to a church that's on fire amen i don't believe this no i don't get that i don't get that as i invited our church the other day well if you're looking for that kind of church in the wrong church all right we haven't finished reading the scripture yet and you're worried that you're not sitting i don't know if they had seats where jesus were i don't know they were in the plane nobody robbed you know folding chairs but they wanted to get to jesus amen it didn't matter what situation get me to jesus they brought the sick the lame the halt and god healed them all amen praise the lord and they that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed and the whole multitude sought to touch him interrupt us lord the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and he healed i want you to read that with me and he healed them and he healed them all may the lord add his blessing to his word you may have your seeds how many have ever read that or sang that song pass me not oh gentle savior hear my humble cry and maybe we've come to meetings and we're always with all filled with expectations and it seems we should be but sometimes sometimes the holy spirit needs to deal with us individually deal with us personally and fanny cosby she sang and wrote a little song pass me not o gentle savior can we say gentle shepherd gentle jesus past me not o gentle savior then if he is here and i do believe with all my heart or i wouldn't be preaching that if he's here and he can is doing his part greg he can do his part but we have to do our part and our part is reach out and touch the lord as he passes by and that's that's pretty personal isn't it that's pretty personal so the scripture says they came to the plain and the multitude of people came from all over judea and jerusalem and sighed on by the sea they came to meet this jesus and we've come to a meeting and had a wonderful meeting last night and yet we can get lost in the crowd we can get lost in the amens and the hallelujahs and the glory to gods and and i'm i'm one of those people that like those things but like brother burley said i don't need those things i just need him and if he's coming by then he deserves the praise the worship the glory he does deserve it all so he's here to maybe interrupt your life tonight so i just came here a preacher preached and brother tommy's excitable or something i am something to be excited about but i'm also here because i love him and i would want him to deal with me just as much as he would deal with you see you don't know what i am you don't know what it was and a lot of us have individual lives that nobody knows nothing about but jesus interrupted it changed me changed me filled me watched over me blessed me kept me and he's still keeping me so what he's done for one he'll do for others and there's as your pastor has said there is nothing he cannot do we're the ones that limit him he's unlimitable he's immeasurable he's omnipotent and we got these big words to explain it because we're finite we're trying to understand god but he could move on this little church right now and we would never even have to preach if they did it in the old testament what's wrong with the new testament the glory of god come down in that temple when solomon dedicated it and the minister couldn't even minister wouldn't that be something if all of a sudden we started to just get interrupted and we started to lift up our own heart and lift up our hands and lift up our voices and say to your wife or to your children honey god's here if he's here let's worship him let's glorify him i don't want to be an observer i don't want to be a part of the crowd that said who's those crazy people i'll be with jesus any day of the week they want to call him a fanatic they want to call him bowser bob i'll call him king of kings i'll call him lord supreme he interrupted matthew said matthew you come out of that tax booth and you come with me interrupted james and john and peter and andrew he's here to interrupt your life so i'm tired of just being a lukewarm church member i want to be on fire with god i want this message alive i want to see the son of man myself i don't want it to be an expression i want it to be an experience i'm sorry but i'm not sorry i feel like that little woman half the time i just want to wash his feet i don't care about you i don't think she cared about anybody all she just cared about was jesus she didn't care about the pharisees actors you know what a pharisee i mean they act religion i'm not interested acting church acting special meetings i want to wash jesus fate [Applause] amen she interrupted simon the pharisees home his party was over she rained on his parade hallelujah said he's the one cousin he's the one he's here you mean me in my unsafe state or my backslidden state that jesus is here yes he's here he's here brother brown so often said he's not 10 feet away he's not six feet away he's the same he's not six feet away he's just right here can he interrupt your life did he interrupt it i i i like just being what i am i just like i i just like sitting here and coming to church and letting everybody do everything and i just want to be a taker not a giver so many takers where's all the givers but brown said true christianity is living for others that means everybody here should be a giver so brother branham was trying to show us that the son of man himself jesus christ was a very present god to to interrupt our lives oh little lady i wonder if i just turned my back and said oh little lady dear little lady he's not looking at anybody little lady sitting here looking like this with her hands praying you've got a bad hand and she was praying i'd say the holy spirit interrupted her life she came to a meeting but jesus came to the same meeting jesus came to the plane and then god met their needs i know that jesus christ is here right now and i know that he could meet your needs you say well brother tom i lost my joy you can find your joy right now in christ jesus amen you can find your victory amen yes sir you can't find anything you got a bad hand but do you believe that's the question do you believe even the little introduction we've got on right now do you believe do you believe my jesus is here you believe your jesus is here yeah he said you didn't touch me you touched him so you don't have to touch brother tom you don't have to touch an altar you can touch him here just touching jesus as the songwriter says this is all that really matters and your life do you know the song and what does it say in your life or what never be the same when he interrupts your life it'll never be the same when tom ray got interrupted it would never be the same drugs went never be the same drinking went never been the same never gone back don't want to go back never been the same only one more and then a songwriter said i want more of jesus more and more and more at utes asked me has there been time you didn't want more there's never been a time never been a time that i didn't want more jesus not a time can you turn with me please to psalms 38. psalms 38. okay just under your breath interrupt me just say it just for for me or just humor me interrupt me just interrupt me psalms 38 verse 3 there's no soundness in my flesh because of thy anger neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin for my iniquities are gone over my head as heavy burdens they're too heavy for me this is david my wounds stink and cr and are corrupt because of my foolishness i'm troubled i am bowed down greatly i go down mourning all the day long for my loins are filled with lonesome disease and there is no soundness in my flesh i am feeble and sore bore and sore broken i have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart lord all my desire is before thee and my groaning is not hid from thee all my desires all that i longed for you know i hope you don't mind if i quote songs or psalms or you know david when we see the songs all i want to see is jesus all i want to see is him in me so god sees my desire god sees my groaning and it's not hid from him it's not hid from him so he's a great god isn't he isn't he a great god how often did you hear that prophet say he said i saw you there he says and then brother brown break out of it that was not me that was him that was him whatever he said is that true he said i saw you i i saw you sitting by your bedside you were by your chair and you're praying god sees everything he just wants to interrupt us amen we just have to make ourselves interruptable you know we put up so many walls of facades and by the time we're finished we got a listen our fortresses are bigger than this room we built up this we built up that we built up this he wants to break it down tonight he wants to break it all down all our facades all our religiosity all our way he just wants us to be real people amen amen so touching jesus really all that really matters isn't it jackson is not brother jackson is that all that really matters and then a prophet comes down and brings it so real that you don't even have to think about a jesus of 2000 years ago you had a prophet come on the scene and bring jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever a greater than solomon is here he was bringing us to the reality that he's not a god of the past he's a god of the presence and if you would just let yourself get interrupted he could change your life in a moment's time in a moment's time but we say we can't do that because the doctor said this can't do that because of this problem he can do anything he can take a woman at the well if he can take a mary magdalene if he can take a legion he can take you if he interrupted their lives he can interrupt your life he's the same god he is absolutely the same god but he sees your desire he sees your groaning what's your desire what is your groaning tonight jesus give me jesus that's all i want all i want amen he's the great high priest amen who is this melchizedek he was bringing god on the scene a son of man bringing the son of man on the scene he said who is this melchizedek he is king priest he is king jesus he's king of kings he's my high priest he's your high priest and he can be touched by the feeling of your infirmity tonight is ah brother tom i'm just low as low can be just reach out just let him interrupt you right now he can change whatever your situation is for the glory of god that's what meetings are about that's why we come to church that's what the word's for to wash us and cleanse us hallelujah we're not the baptist we're not the methodists no sir we're not the assemblies we are the bride she is the elected sea gene of the living god outside of that you can just take every bit of chaff you want but you give me seed give me seed he's my high priest he's my god and he's a very prison help in time of trouble and if you're in a time of trouble right now he's here right now to meet your need to interrupt your life to say change you in a moment change you in the moment he's a great high priest of brother braham said he's a great high priest and he says there's hundreds and hundreds of times he's a high priest and can be touched by the feeling of your infirmity he's the high priest he's a high priest that can be touched he's trying to show us that the jesus christ the great high priest himself can only be moved by your confession ah there's we're coming down to the where the pedal hits the medal now uh-huh it's you've got to have the desire you've got to have the groaning you've got to say i want to meet you jesus but i'm a deacon they can't see me we they can't see me break down they can't see me call on god i'm a trustee don't you know i've been here for 30 30 years who cares who cares i didn't know we gave stripes i didn't i didn't get a stripe uh-huh i don't get my 45-year stripe i don't care about stripes i

i'm a long-winded preacher really i think he's a long-winning preacher what time we get out of here last night man it went by that fast huh this is marvelous genesis please genesis chapter 2. you're gonna have a lot of interruptions in life yep and a lot of interruptions especially this time this hour this day oh my goodness yeah the other day i picked up that thing i was ready to throw it half a mile that was a thousand dollar phone computer you know it's just when you want to pray uh-huh this is when you want to pray and then the devil plays your head how do you know that that's not a need that you got to be praying for and you find out it's an advertisement craziness like i need that but we get interrupted don't we sure we do then you don't answer and then you're in trouble really big need all of a sudden the brothers drive we've been trying to get ahold of you for five hours the bible says here in genesis 2 verse 9. genesis 2 verse 9. well we can read verse 8 and the lord god planted the garden eastward in eden and there he put man whom he had formed and under the ground made the lord to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden the tree of knowledge of good and evil let's go to verse 16 and the lord commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shall not eat of it for in the day that thou eat is thereof thou shall surely die that's pretty easy command pretty easy not even ten commandment one commandment just one statement just one let's turn to oh you just flipped the page there to chapter three verse one so now between now what we just read to now god separated eve from adam so the commandment was eve in him come on eve in him she had a knowledge that was amazing because we're going to see a little something here and now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field and we've known and probably heard much on the fertility of satan mr the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god hath made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden verse 3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you what where did you where did the lord say that i want was somebody read that before did we miss that by reading how did she know that she was in adam and then adam he knew all things you hadn't read where it said that you she wasn't she wasn't to eat of it but she knew if she touched it it'd be trouble god said you shall not eat neither shall you what touch it lest ye die so there's certain kinds of touching i want you to take a special note that that word touch in the hebrew means the nega n-a-g-a don't touch the tree of good and evil now here we are in satan's eden well brother tom now where are you going with that let's just stick with the scripture now because if god wants to interrupt you i'll tell you there's a devil that wants to interrupt your life he'll want to interrupt you and he's now she is saying to touch to touch is to die you know why she mentions the word touch because if you look up the word the meaning touch it means to take sexual contact here she is knowing not just to eat of it even just to touch it and i could so quickly go to today and brother braham says in a church age book and he brings it down he says we're amongst two trees again today and i could say to you as eve knew don't even touch from the tree of good and evil don't touch it ah where did gaming come from tree of life where'd your music come from tree of life [Music] where did the entertainment world come from tree of life no it came from the tree of good and evil and it has its sexual connotations once you touch it listen you can't game without rock and roll playing or strip down women in the game you might as well be honest we don't even have to play it which i never have i've just seen walking down the mall the advertisement on the silly windows and people say oh it's just a game no it's not a game it might have been you know x's and y's when i was learning a computer in the dark ages of the 80s and you had an arrow go up and you hit that thing going across and you thought now you're living it you're flying f-15s and boy we got quiet all of a sudden no god is trying to interrupt your life he's trying to get you away from the tree of good and evil and get you to the tree of life because touching him will change your life forever gaming will be silly it's absolutely ridiculous that grown men can spend hours one two come on i got didn't get an amen yet now come on come on he wants to interrupt your life get you away from the tree of good and evil come on and get you back to the tree of life because brother brahman said jesus sent his angels to run us back come on to the tree of life but everything you pick up now every phone you got everything you do is made from that tree and that tree's got sexual connotations and you need to conquer it and bring it subject to the holy ghost boy are you a holiness preacher yeah i guess so i hope so i hope so i don't preach for a favor i don't preach for you know pat on the back i know what i was and i know what happened when he interrupted me and i know what i am today and i don't want the garbage and so if jesus could just interrupt you one more time you could put that behind you and you can put the cross before you hallelujah interrupt us lord interrupt us yes sir they touched him the multitude touched him and everyone was healed i want every hole with my heart's desire when i prayed this afternoon and thought on this little subject as the lord was opening up lord would everyone leave here totally deliberate if you're here lord and they all gathered on the plane and they came from here and they came from north south east west and they just wanted to be with jesus and touch him and he healed them all healed them all the marvelous remarks and just healed them all can you imagine them going back to the hometown going back in the neighborhood telling your neighbor i went to church that night i went to church and jesus came by my way it changed everything we had a fella live in a house just down the street from our our the church and he he lived there for a while he lived there for years lived there for years moved away and a believer came and moved into that house never been the same the neighbor looked over the said what's different about you what's different about you said jesus he said do you mind if i find out jesus i'll come to your church i want to find jesus one can live and the other one can live one just live their life and the other one will live for jesus i i he walked into the house house of the lord he walked in about a month ago i thought about david joanne and i went for a lunch years ago we were sitting down having a sandwich and a guy sat down he had a jeans pants on and jean jacket on and you know a little tie dyed shirt on and white gray stringly hair with a ponytail she said that would have been you and that would have been me but jesus interrupted my life hallelujah and now says of god i've been kept clean by the grace of almighty god can you say amen can you say lord interrupt me tonight we've got we got tonight and tomorrow morning let's not worry about tomorrow morning maybe get raptured tonight wouldn't that be an interruption that's the interruption of interruptions lord change us glory it almost get you on your feet you'd be so happy huh wouldn't that be something young fellas yeah jesus is here glory to god really man you're a loud preacher we can't figure you out one minute you're broken the next minute you're yelling well just say paradox okay that's all i have to say i'm a paradox we're all paradoxes we'll never be the same didn't you just say that this poor man cried come on who's a poor man here i'm a poor man you know say oh you got a nice suit jacket one dad i never had a jacket didn't even know where that jackal was my dad had to buy me my first suit he didn't like my long hair then i got saved he got short hair and he says i like to better with long hair they can't figure it out i can't figure it out but i like this way better hallelujah so he's a great high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities touching jesus is all that really matters and you sit here and we look and we look at a preacher standing behind a pulpit but let's look beyond the veil it's been on the flesh and let's look at jesus say jesus why don't you touch me tonight why don't you speak to me tonight lord amen this poor woman cried what are you talking about we haven't got there yet luke chapter 8 verse 43. luke 8 verse 43 and a woman having an issue of blood suffered from a hemorrhage for 12 years 12 years spent all our living upon physicians neither could be healed of any came behind him i want you to take special note of that she came behind him she didn't come in front of him she came behind him she had a blood issue that means she's unclean if she would have come before him the crowd would have pushed her away but she humbled herself she came behind jesus she wanted to interrupt him he can interrupt you or you can interrupt him lord here i am i need you tonight lord jesus i'll do whatever it takes and here she is with her blood she spent everything that she had she just wanted to get healed she just wanted a healthy life and the physicians never had the answer laodicea didn't have the answer doctors didn't have the answer but dr jesus had the answer and i want to tell you tonight the great physician that is now here has your answer for every situation that you will ever ever come to you just got to come to him humbly come to him and ask jesus can i interrupt you lord just a little title interrupt lord can i interrupt you i don't want to come to church just to church i want to interrupt you lord i want you in such a bad way you see my desires and you see my groanings i want to be an adopted son of the living god i don't desire to be like luther i don't desire to be like wesley i'm sorry i don't even desire to be like pentecost i desire to be like a son of the living god aren't we at harvest time isn't the grain back to maturity again isn't this the time when the sons of god know they're sons of god isn't this the time we put the devil under our feet is this not the hour come on i need your feedback amen this is your day this is your hour this is your time amen and the bible says and she touched and jesus said who touched me who touched me he knew who touched him he knew that billy touched them he knew that this woman touched him but she had to have a confession come on come on you need a confession jesus touched and i touched him amen hallelujah who touched me jesus says somebody touched me oh wouldn't that be some somebody touched me all of a sudden there's a sister in the corner over there glorifying god with her hands raised in there somebody touched him [Music] somebody touched him jesus said somebody touched me for i perceived that virtue has gone out of me and when the woman saw that she was not hit she wasn't hit she didn't want to be hit she touched him she came trembling falling down before him declared unto him before all the people for what caused she had touched him and how she was healed this poor woman cry immediately if you say it in french immediately not that i know french of course but she was healed immediately and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort be of good comfort your faith have made you whole go in peace hallelujah she went away real sad huh she went away downcast depressed huh she's depressed sad no sir she spent everything she had she had nothing but she had jesus you might have spent everything in this world but give me jesus hallelujah i'm not downcast i'm not sad come on [Applause] actually put a smile on your face yeah you know i i got tickets to the world series everybody's smiling now who would like these tickets oh man i'd have a scramble first one gets them come on don't be so spiritual now oh not me i'd let billy get him are you kidding me are you kidding me you'd push him over in a heartbeat and you'd be grabbing for it just to see a silly baseball game but i want you to see jesus amen it's better than a home run grand slam it's better than anything amen get to love jesus get to love the word get to love the son of man himself not talking about a history book i'm talking about a god that's present right now that's amongst you hallelujah you can touch him as the gospel says in 39 places it's associated whenever you touched and jesus touched something it was always for their benefit any time they touched the lord it was for their benefit you come to church on a wednesday night if you come to church on a wednesday night i hope you come to church on a wednesday night i'm in trouble again of course we all come wednesday night but every time you touch him it's beneficial come on you brothers please who has a job here yeah if you've got a hands up huh you always want to know what the benefit package is how many holidays i get how much dental do i get how much medical do i get you always want to know the benefits and a lot of times you don't even take the job because the benefits aren't very good come on i'm trying to tell you the benefits of christ the benefits of christ are unbelievable he's a healer he's a savior he's a deliverer what a benefit package oh but i get 75 percent dental he gives me a hundred percent i get 100 medical i don't have to put i don't have to pay for it he does everything [Applause] without money without price huh you sure don't want bags with holes in it do you make all you can and have nothing at the end of the day but watch watch how jesus adds to that little purse of that little cruise that never runs dry i love that because that's me my brother's made more money than i've ever dreamed of making oh now we're getting personal now and everybody gets quiet again but i just had a little cruise they served the lord and in serving god at the end of the day i my father owns a cattle on a thousand hills they said why why didn't we do what you did well it's a good question when you just get saved and find out they actually think it's in their smartness right their smartness makes them but their benefit package is rotten because when they're finished with their job there goes the benefits our benefits go from here and forever amen i get a total healing i get a new body i get a city i get tree i get streets of pure gold don't tell me this benefit packages were nothing [Applause] you need to talk start talking about that future home and forget about this home [Applause] oh i got to get a bigger home i got to get bigger this guy got to have faster car i got to get this i got and when you get it what is it somebody drives up with a nicer car that's right that's right i was we were in victoria my wife and i one year and and we went down and go to the dock and always look at all these yachts you know all these yachts really there's no more sea over there come on i don't know what are they gonna do with the yachts there's no yachts over there the crazy guys they get these yachts worth millions of dollars right and the top dog he's always the guy on the top deck slipping his little drink but then a bigger boat comes man he evaporates he's down in the galley somewhere hiding because there's another bigger boat there's always going to be a bigger house bigger car bigger this but there's not going to be another city like our city hallelujah can you imagine come on i always call it a floating ice cream cone he said tom you are so weird the earth is the earth right everybody flown here you fly at what thirty five thousand feet that's only six miles up on the city wall you got another 1494 miles to go pyramid city round earth ice cream cone just remember and he's on top of the city the one that's interrupted us glory to be to jesus he's the lamb in that city where the lamb is the light he wants to go there with me [Applause] have you been that interrupted yes i've been that interrupted hallelujah so every time touching jesus is always to do with a beneficial effect but it's how you touch him a soldier can touch him and have no virtue but a believer touches him and there's a benefit amen vines explains it a different way when you touch him take a hold of him come on come on that's what i want you to do tonight not just touch him i want you to take a hold of him i won't let you go until you bless me come on jacob i won't let you go until you bless me i won't let that preacher stop preaching until he blesses me [Music] hallelujah so vines in the greek then once you touch him hold on him don't let him go for nothing don't let no job make you let him go don't let no woman don't let no man no sir i want what jesus gives me amen well that's a whole nother service so i'll talk that on another time leave that one to the pastor it's your attitude it's just your attitude uh-huh it's your attitude how do you want to be touched how do you want to be interrupted huh how badly do you want him to interrupt you a woman she believed if she just touched the hem of his garment but the bram goes on to say she's healed she just touched him she was healed is that right it depends on what you think about it god sends it to you but it's your attitude towards a divine gift that'll determine what you get out of it how'd you come to church how did you come to church that's a great afternoon we had a great barbecue didn't we i'm not great man i'm so tired i hope that preacher's quick i got one preach everybody else can go i'll preach to him everybody else said will he be quiet please but it's our attitude it's our attitude man i mean can you imagine you know if you're a group of young people i'd actually go through those doors and come in here boot him open and go i'm at church brother david would probably be dancing in the air everybody came busting through the doors with this great anticipation changes of preaching changes the atmosphere changes everything that's why special meetings are special and the only reason why they're special because you're special outside of that it's special meetings every week [Music] cosmon's not special of course he's special who says he's not special i say you're special so what makes a special meeting people who's the people you brother jackson are you special you sure are so isn't on every service special it's our attitude it's just our attitude yeah interrupt me tonight it's wednesday i hate wednesday at work work on wednesday it's the middle of the week man i had two behind me i got two in front of me but when i come to church i'm gonna get supercharged [Applause] hallelujah then when you get to sunday man it's rocket fuel hallelujah what an attitude to half what an attitude to take hey amen amen turn that on nowhere he sees your groaning he sees your desire he wants to interrupt you the bible says in isaiah 58 and 11 it says and the lord shall guide you continually the lord shall guide you continually hello seed the lord shall guide you continually and satisfy you in drought it's a dry and thirsty land and i can barely make it really come on man there's a fountain been opened up in the house of david my bible says in the lord shall guide you continually continually and satisfy you in drought and in dry places and make strong your bones and you shall be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters fail not i want to hear an amen amen why jesus interrupted me i was in dry places but there was a fountain opened up and that fountain now is in me and out of my belly flows what rivers of living water in the good times praise his name in the bad times just do the same these are the benefits [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah now ephesians church age brother brahma says in first takes first john 5 and 11 and says and this is the record that god has given to us eternal life and this life is in his son and thus the record god's word states plainly clearly that life eternal life is in the sun no other place first john 5 and 12 says he that hath the son has he that has a son is what he that has a son has life and he that hath not the son hath not life so now it's life and not life how do you know a tree is living if you have no leaves on the tree what do you say dead no fellowship dead no throat dead come on if you can tell a natural tree buy it by its status how about spiritual trees oh okay okay we'll leave that but now he that has the sun has life saying so the tree in the garden here's the prophet now saying the tree in the garden was jesus that's right life is in his son since this is so the tree in the garden has to be jesus all right then if the tree of life is a person come on the tree of knowledge of good and evil is a person all soul it can't be otherwise thus one righteous one thus a wicked one amen standing side by side so now we got the son of man versus the man of sin stay with me we got the son of man and now we've got the man of sin which tree do you want let's take the tree of life because we know who wins that's right devil know who wins so now it's the son of man versus the man of sin one's a tree of knowledge of good and evil one's a tree of life but the ram said they're two trees two persons thus one's the righteous one one's the wicked one they're standing side by side when in satan's eden once again we're back to eden but i'm not staying in satan's eden i'm being changed by the son of man himself to another beauty called eden beauty because i'm eating off the tree of life hallelujah yes sir amen so not only does mark take a record of this woman crying having a need to interrupting but matthew also describes it if i could but touch the hem of his garment so not only thus mark and matthew luke also has a look we read and mark also says if i could just touch his clothes who gave her that revelation close if i could just touch his clothes why where'd that inspiration come from where did your revelation come from who told you that malachi 4 was here who told you he was luke 17 30. who told you it was revelation 10 7 who told you revelation 10 5 who told you read revelation 10 1 who told you revelation 10 8 who told you that where'd that come from where did peter get power to christ the son of the living god where'd that come from that came from the eternal realms of god [Applause] listen to what brother braham said but see you've received his word you've received his word he interrupted you he you've received his word oh hallelujah hallelujah he said that's what sets it a fire we're going to get to the lamb yet brother david we're going to get to that lamp because saints there's got to be somebody here on fire there's somebody's wick that needs to be lit because jesus is here to interrupt your life because ye are the lights of the world come on is that true or right is that true is that what

interrupting us tonight hallelujah so there's a certain woman so you might as well say it's me i'm the bride the certain woman this poor woman cried and she didn't say i needed to touch david she said i just need to touch the hem where did she get that where come on let's be reasonable let's not be reasonable that's a silly thing tommy shouldn't have said that i preached against that one time well let's think about this that's a better way to think about it let's think about it here is now she receives the word brother brown goes hallelujah brother that sets it a fire well so is receiving the word is equated to fire who's the wet blanket around here huh no wet blankets here no we left them outside and don't pick them up brother brahma said that sets that brother on fire why because you got a hold of something and something got a hold of you and when you receive it it's a revelation which slips out of the unseen world yonder glory where'd that revelation come from outside yonder oh man you broke into another world and brother brown said i'm living between two worlds what's he trying to do brother billy bring us into that world and so you're getting a revelation that's pulling you in getting the revelation pulling you in getting down the revelation pulling you in hallelujah come on he wants you in that realm he doesn't want you in the tree of good and evil he wants you in the tree of life himself hallelujah what does this do when you receive this revelation it's a revelation it's something that slipped out of the unseen world yonder i need to get saved it's from that unseen realm you caught that revelation kerry think about it and just think of all those other revelations that have that's why he said the rapture is just what one more revelation of that unseen realm pulling us in hallelujah amen yes sir it's slipped out of the unseen world yonder come rolling down the mystical mystical channel somewhere into your soul man you talk about poetry you talk about poetry there's a poetry this beats longfellow the iliad and homer just in case we've got some historians around here this is poetry of malachi 4. it's in motion and it's moving amen so now it slipped out of the unseen world yonder come rolling down through that mystical channel somewhere into your soul now you say i see it you know what you know what brother harm says then your eyes brighten amen you look at somebody you got no revelation brother i better look this way hey this is your prophet not me i probably would have said a weird a weirder way he said it a right way he said now when you get that something your eyes brighten you see some of you know they got it by their eyeballs [Music] right yeah you talk to somebody and he doesn't want to look at you you know there's trouble i said look at me son look at me hey they know they don't want to look at daddy but when you get that revelation slipped out of that unseen realm from that mystical place yonder bringing you to that place he says your eyes brighten up your lip that hang down you bunch of powders i never got my way huh no we got our way we get him you get everything your eyes brighten up your lip he says your lip your lip that once hung down straightens to a smile that's what your prophet said you catch a revelation you're going to be smiling [Music] yes sir something happens oh this is going to be a good one now something happens and you don't even need a prayer line no more i'm healed that's my benefit he interrupted me to heal me come on she touched his garment and got a healing you can touch the son of man and you will get your healing [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah yes sir she wasn't just touching somebody she was touching messiah you're not just touching somebody tonight you're touching the messiah [Applause] hallelujah amen and when you got him don't let him go don't let him go i want my wife saved i want my husband's sake i want my children saying glory why because it came from the mystical realm into this realm to move us into that realm [Music] hallelujah in the back of the church said you don't think i'm not watching you yep i didn't watch everybody he touched me [Applause] oh he touched me and all that something happened now i know he touched me and made [Music] [Music] if i could dance i'd dance i'll tell you what brother david it gives you something worth shouting about standing about rejoicing about why he interrupted me from the unseen realm [Applause] we didn't learn this in a theological college did we huh i don't think so we didn't learn this by doctor's own so nope we didn't learn this by no man brother we didn't even learn this by brother branham we let we learn this we got revelated this through a son of man [Applause] through son of man himself a son of man god can do nothing unless he first reveals it to his servants the prophets first and god came in that mythical realm and made that revelation real to you a lot of people saw it but didn't believe it we never saw it and we believed this i didn't see it i believe it because the word himself interrupted me brother rahm said you're looking for messiah he said you already got messiah falling that's why you have world falling apart that's what he said he said you're looking for messiah why are you crying for messiah he says you've got messiah i want to get you into the i want to get you into the rapture that's what this whole message is about to move a people into that dimension he interrupted you to get you there oh i love i love that i love that have you got a broomstick around here man

[Applause] brother tom i'm sorry for that fly in fly open business forgive me once your soul is on fire it's lit by god and once lit by god it can't go out hallelujah because there's pastors preachers

trimming wicks that's anti-bible i hate anti-bible but that plays with your mind because you guys go camping you say hey this what don't need to be dripped and then you'll start weird eh you'll say something's weird here you won't catch it quite unless you hear like a preaching like this message on wic truman time hallelujah so now when you receive the revelation something slept slipped in from that unseen world yonder so i just want you to say well it was just a revelation no no no no it's sweeter than that it's way sweeter than that say i call it revelation brother no no no no it's way sweeter than that it's way sweeter he said it's a revelation that slipped out of the unseen world yonder rolling down through the mystical channel somewhere unto your soul and when you caught that you could never leave when you got that you could never leave so people that leave never got that you might as well tell it like it is if it's got lit from that mystical realm yonder and it changes your eyes tightens your smile amen you can't go back you can't throw the towel in you can't do nothing you are a prisoner to jesus christ interrupt it i say lord interrupt us tonight [Applause] can you imagine here a prophet son of man standing there a little women a little woman with these little broomsticks little broomsticks but there's going to be a channel open brother billy there's going to be a channel that's going to roll out that mystical realm and it was going to come and if i could just get to the sun that son of man i can give him my broomsticks and i can walk like a child of god i trust you can catch a revelation tonight you're not leaning on the world no more [Applause] not leaning on your boss not leaning on your wife not leaning on your husband you're leaning on him are we all right i know you're just being nice don't you know that i i had my words so fail me you get in his presence you want to just weep and tell him how much you love him and then all of a sudden he starts stirring and moving and you want to shout and you want to sing you want to glorify the king amen 12 years of loneliness gone come on come on some of you went 25 years some of you went 10. some of you went 35 years of loneliness without god without the word without him but then jesus came then jesus came right and he interrupted us he interrupted us 12 years of loneliness 12 years of being ostracized unclean she had any place she had to go she had to say she had to say gregory i'm clean i'm unclean don't come near me i'm unclean 12 years ostracized and alone she had to have been a woman of wealth because the bible says 12 years she spent all she had and i you look it up you look it up you'll find out what she tried what kind of remedies ostrich egg powder on fire i don't know can you imagine when people are desperate they'll try anything they'll go to buddha they'll go to krishna they'll try anything but it won't touch them they won't touch them won't do nothing but then you come to the word himself amen you come to jesus christ the living word it changes your life forever she had to cry unclean for 12 years everything she touched was unclean everything she touched so when touching jesus theoretically would have made him unclean but you can never ever make the one that is clean unclean never he's the holy one the righteous one could never be unclean but she knew if she could touch him i would be clean [Applause] [Music] amen rejected by all jay why don't you stand up if you don't mind brother jay god bless you look at that look around the room everybody doesn't want to even talk to you no more it's all right no not all right thank you brother j you're a good sport but can you imagine living and seeing all these people that you love and you can't go near them you can't be around them you can't fellowship with them you can have nothing to do with them and you had to say unclean and clean and clean but one day after 12 years for me 21 years for somebody else

[Music] you know we have people here that have been battling sickness you know it's one thing to come under conviction because you've been dabbling in the world but it's another thing to challenge the devil at the sickness you know we have someone tonight that asked me to pray because their mama sits in a wheelchair there's others that come up time and time again and pray because they want to see god i think it's time we challenge ourselves you know do you believe this man's got the holy ghost so we've been asked to go lay our hands on someone because they don't have no hope now what are you talking about a lot of difference in someone being delivered from something they shouldn't be in any way then believers that know that god and are clean and they'll go up to that person and say you know the doctors say you're dead but i've come yes testify there's life in the camp now we ain't playing no more right there's deliverance yes sir that's right you know we don't really know what god will do many times it won't do but i heard a gospel about standing for something yes sir yes sir so alls i know is i'm going to take this brethren and i'm going to go pray for somebody because they asked me to amen amen now what do you believe do you believe he's the same yesterday forever do you believe there's resurrection power in the camp do you believe he can heal yeah the liver you know i

just want to testify i don't know how much faith you have or you don't sure sure but i know a god and so tom yes sir all i know is to do what he told me to do he said if we lay hands and i know that a brother testified and this brother listened and he believed that you like to prove yes this gospel john you've done all and you've asked okay and because you asked [Music] i don't know what else anybody else we're going to go pray for this person because they can't come here but if you can come and i don't mean oh god i want to get right or oh god i've been sinning and poking around and it's

i know and alls i want to see is a living god doing supernatural no we're not worthy it's not about us it's about a god it's about a tree it's about a fountain that we can drink from and touch we
