because the scripture tells us when we call upon that name we shall be saved we commit everything to you and the the word we ask you speak to us in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen god bless you just open up your bibles colossians colossians chapter 1 let's start from verse 10 it says that that you might walk worthy of the lord unto all praise being fruitful in every good work it says an increasing knowledge of god strengthened with all might according to his righteous power unto all patients and long-suffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the father which has made us meet to the meet to the partakers of inheritance of the saints in light who had delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood and forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god the first born of every creature by him where all things were all things created that are in heaven that are in earth visible and invisible whether there be that be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist so he's before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning of the with who is the beginning the first moment from the dead that in all things that he might have the preeminence it continues on it says for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i'd say whether whether they be things in uh in earth or things in heaven and you that were sometimes alienated of the and and and enemies in your mind by wicked work yet now had he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblemished and unprovable in his sight if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled be not move away from the hope of the gospel which he have heard which was preached to every creature which is under heaven wherefore i paul may i paul made a minister who now rejoiced in my suffering for you and filled up that that which is behind of the affliction of christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church wherefore i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you the fullness of the word the fullness the for the full the to fulfill the the word of god even the mystery which had been heard from ages and from generation but now is made manifest to his sense to whom god would make known what is the richest of his glory of the mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in jesus christ amen you may have your seats also we will just turn in hebrews 13 and we're going to read from verse 5 it says let your conversation hebrews 13 and verse 5. it says let your conversation be courteous be without let your conversation be without coveredness and be content in such thing as ye have for he has for he has said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what man shall do unto me remember them which have rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god whose faith follow consider the end of the conversation jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen you know i was trying to get out of not preaching the day i told brother david i forgot how to preach and that didn't work and so we'll i hope we'll say something that's of benefit to you this evening i i just want to just to to to read few things and to say a few words about you know just something that uh came to my heart you know and and i hope i could just express it um the way i i have it um i just want to speak about jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and specifically i want to speak on uh christ in you christ in you and i want to say this christ in you today christ in you today as we read in the scriptures paul was trying to to to speak and let them know that there was a hope that was to come and there was a hope that it was speaking of regarding the gospel basically trying to show them that all of these things that they heard and all these things the gospel that was preaching being preached to them was not in vain that they he had a hope that was attached to it and and and it brings it down to say that the hope of glory was christ in you now when you read this as even as paul has written it i i was so you just look at it he began by just letting them know that we're praying for you and you know we we we are with you and and all those things and but then he began to speak about moving from how that they should stay with the gospel into things and then he began to speak about even the mystery of christ christ he knew being the hope of glory now we can brenham speak so many i preached so many messages about christ jesus christ uh the same yesterday today and forever and he speaks and i could say tonight you know it's wonderful for us to gather here and no doubt if if we open the bible as we begin to speak about david we will all rejoice about the story to see how that god used to man and you know i i don't know if i'll have time to read those quotes i think one of them he was speaking about isaiah he's saying that a man just like you and i he says a man with us up and down ups and downs a man that you know just like us and and no doubt and and he says amen with his up and down and men like just like me um bringing us into the scriptures bringing us into the word of god so we can identify and see ourselves in what he was preaching and and and so and and that becomes very important because like i said we could read about david we could read uh about moses we can read about all of them in fact brother branham says that christ yesterday we could see christ yesterday it was the spirit in the old testament we could see christ in david we can see christ in moses we could see all of that and that's something that we hold dear that's something that helps us that's something that we read and we see god and we see his pattern and everything but i would say this but what he also wanted to let the people in our generation know that that is not sufficient it's not good enough for us to just talk about christ yesterday but we have to identify christ today it's the identification of christ today in in one of the messages i'm sorry i'm just going to be all over the place uh uh i believe it's it's it's about the trip to india he talks about uh a man i believe his name was reid had dr reed had who had met this muslim young man who began to question him and he said that he came and he says you know why don't you believe in christ and why do you believe in jesus christ i said well we believe in muhammad he said well we have a book and you know the bible he speaks about the the export and everything he says well we have the koran and then he begins to speak to him he says well you know he says jesus will do he will save you and he will give you all this and everything i'm just paraphrasing he says well the quran just offers as much joy as the bible does and so he began well you know you will have this he says well we believe that if we die we'll have something too so if it's about things to come everybody can can can dream all they want everybody can can say all they want and if it's about the past we have a record just like you have and so he he he began and and one of the things which as you read it one of the things that you realize that was lacking was the ability to manifest christ today was the ability and brady venom talks about it in one place i believe in the token or some place it says i wish they would have called me or something like that or you know i wish i would have talked to the brother and everything in fact i've already came to see brother branham so he speaks about how that they will you could come the gospel can be preached to where we could talk about history we could talk about what god did and the exploit and the things that he did and we can turn around and begin to talk about the promises all the future promises and everything and that's what christianity in the world has become you look at all it becomes a court of conduct well you know the bible says you shall not steal and you shall not lie you shall not do this and you shall not do this and and people go and they practice those things and they call that christianity when you ask him about christ today it doesn't even cross their minds it's all about well you know this is the bible in order for us to go to heaven we're gonna beat ourselves into obedience we're gonna beat ourselves into submission and do those things and and and try so hard until we can manifest these things and weigh ourselves and see if we've done it all then god will accept us the the understanding and the the coming into the realization that there is such a message as christ today is missing and this is one thing that the message has brought in such power in such a reality for us to know it doesn't do any good to talk about a god of the past it doesn't do any good to to talk about the exploit and everything if those things cannot be done today if those things cannot be touched today they cannot be manifested today they cannot be felt today what good is it if we're going to talk about the future anybody can dream what they want to dream about the future so what we need is a god of yesterday who can manifest what he promised yesterday or what he promised today today and then if i receive what he promised today then i know he's taking me somewhere now i i was thinking you know barbara will oftentimes say you know god said let her be and if there wasn't then god didn't say it or he will say well you know he did this over here if he doesn't do it here then it's not god and often time my mind uh just uh uh drops him to the qualification well if it's not god are we denying god are we saying it's not god no he is trying to bring us to a place for us to come to the realization that the attributes and the characteristics of the god who wrote the bible is such that if he did one thing he's obligated to keep it again [Music] he's obligated to do it again so if those characteristics are not together then it's not the right the right god that we're worshiping if those characteristics cannot be kept if he did it yesterday he's able to do it today if he promised he will do it he's here to fulfill his word if he doesn't fulfill then it's not the god that we're worshiping he says in the message christ jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he says now he says but christianity after a a worldwide experience christianity is one of the true religion it's the only religion that that could show an empty grave it's the only one that the founder any man or no man like him ever stood on earth and said i have power to lay down my life and take it again and a little while the word see me no more and yet ye shall see me the unbeliever won't see me no more but yet ye shall see me for i am i am i personal pronoun i'll be with you even in you to the end of the consummation jesus christ the same yesterday today and and forever so now he's talking about this reality of god that continued to manifest itself every time this the reality of this god who who stood up there and said i have the power to lay down my life and take it up again and not just that but he says i've made the promise that i'll be with you even in you until the end so he says now we can come we can come to the thought it says now if if he is the same he is not dead he is risen from the dead he promised andy and his believers would see him all down to the end so this god is promised to be made manifest or to be seen every time his believing children are on the scene every in every age he's made available his presence so that his believing children will know him so they can see him so they can hear him and then he says plump to the confirmation and they that would see him he says now if he is the same yesterday today and forever many men have have talked many men have talked to i've talked to says well uh in one way he is the same the bible didn't didn't say that in a way he said he is the same and if we hunger to see him he says with the same enthusiasm that the greek did they had heard of him they came and they got to see him through the courtesy of one of his disciples he says well he says can't we do the same if he is the same yesterday today and forever so if we have gathered here tonight with the same enthusiasm with the same desire with the same expectation but he's asking can't we not see him and i want to say him we can see him [Music] now let me just say this this revealing of the son of man that we have seen in the end time is nothing like anything before i mean jesus christ came and and and and he came we could as i let me just profess that we it's the same thing that we've seen in the time of jesus why a man can stood there we can read the bible and recall when jesus was on the boat and he stopped the winds or when he did the scripture says they looked at him and says what manner of men is this that even the wings and the wave will obey him that's the same ministry that we've seen manifested here it was the ministry to manifest the son of man something that will catch the attraction of everybody in such a way that everybody came everybody and i'm talking not just believers the unbeliever followed everybody came why because it was such a power such a an eye-opener such a display of the reality of god that a man will stand there and speak about things that nobody has seen and and it wasn't done so we could just gather here and say well we have received a great ministry in all of those things now it was done so we may know under what god are we serving that same god is here tonight doing the same thing it was done so we may know what gospel we have received we didn't receive this is not the men's intellectual or the understanding of the explanation of what the bible is and it's not this is jesus christ manifesting according to the promises that he made in the bible that the gentile will receive and see the same manifestation that the jew was seen that's why when he stood there when he began to call there is nothing that could stand before him because this is not a man just trying to you know i can stand here and say okay you can come i'll pray for you and i'll see if god can heal you and if you have faith you will receive it you know and you can pray or one after another and so forth but this is not so this is god standing there presenting something that will catch every man's eye so he says it says now we can talk about the resurrection we can speak of it but if it it but but if it isn't a reality then it just becomes a mere myth it says it's a story but if it's proven that it's the truth then it says then we are among the people the most happy what we're desiring is not a a story or a myth or something it's that reality of a god who can come and manifest this word to us tonight he speaks again in the message the word the word become flesh he speaks it says and i said now i said he says he says so i need an absolute so i took i'm sorry this is in the message the absolute and then i'll drop on to the other one it says so i need an absolute so i took one i took i took one god's word so i read in the word and he says and he has said in in john chapter and saint john chapter one it says upon this absolute i'll build my church that's right so i took him and i took him at his word revelation 22 and said whatsoever shall take one word out of this or add one word to it add one word to it to to that to that add one word to that's the absolute that's the end of all strife it says this is the absolute whatsoever whatsoever takes anything from it or adds anything to it god said i'll take his part out of the book so that has to that so that had to be the absolute and jesus said that men shall not live by bread alone but by every word then i knowed i know this every word as he said precept upon precept line upon line that's the way it had become just as it's written then he said if you abide in me he is the word my words abide in you you can ask what you will i know then if christianity it says i know then if christianity was the word of god he was the word and by accepting the word the word lived through him and then i know if i abide in him and my if i have if i abide in if i abide in me if he abide in me and my word in you ask what you will and if you are the word if you are if you are in the word and part of the word you will only ask what the word tells you to ask it says no it says no that's the that's not the day you are living in then ask accordingly and then it says so therefore back to the subject it says talking about talking now this personality but i'll uh but i'm tired it says i'm tied to jesus christ to him by his word he is my absolute i found that all these denomination things had the absolute and each one each one they had their own absolute teaching the code of conduct so so here he is again saying it was no longer about god abiding into the people causing them to live a certain life or doing certain things it became all it became is okay we'll take the bible we'll read it says in corinthians that women shall not cut their hairs men shall not do this and they do this and then you know they figure out a way to obey those things and they go home and they call that christianity and and and he began day in and day out and men will try always approaching god from the standpoint that we are sinners and we're trying to get to the kingdom of god and the better we do the better god will accept us forgetting that there was a promise that god was to send of his own spirit in fact the promise when i say jesus christ today i want to say this you are jesus christ today jesus christ today is the revealing of god in his own body a group of people that have received the spirit of christ and they're manifesting the works of christ why because it's christ living through them and he cannot fail because he didn't fail when he was in jesus christ because it was the word that was spoken from the beginning and that same word is doing the same things in the myth so he says the code of conduct good behavior it says how how to do good how to be a good person a good so it becomes those things how they become how they can do good and how they can it's not we are not interested and i want to say this if you are a christian you will become a good citizen if you are a christian you will have good morals you have all of those things but it's not us following after those things it's the life that i have received that produces those things because man has taken this as said here it says they came and they took out the whole christianity has become uh uh uh uh almost to a place where you know they've forgotten the abiding of christ into his people which will produce the very things that they're looking for so he says in the message the word becomes first it says now now as i said as elijah the prophet brought all the prophets of baal and so forth to the mount carmel to prove and say that god uh who is god and said he says now there's only one thing that can that there's only one thing to do and then and then if your gospel is right then then uh if your gospel is right then let me leave mine and serve you and serve yours now here stand the death and dumb boy i love this yes then the death and dumb boy it says which one of your gods can make him whole the paul said i didn't come with the enticing words i oh i wonder how many people came and perhaps those that preached before him how the demonstration and all kinds of things they did and how they came in the great orators and they will come and how some will come even like the prophet of el great sacrifices that men were making but here he is a simple gospel he says well you know we have a deaf and dumb here which one of your gods will make him whole he says if you do i'll serve your god and that's why it's so important that the christ that projected out of us the christ that's been projected out of us is the life of christ that's showing to people this is my god this is what i'm having to present and you show me your god and oftentimes you have you don't even have to say a word and often they fall under conviction you know i remember you know i was at work one day and and you know i was trying to get something to eat and this young man i was working with he said oh you know let's get in my car and everything and we got in the car and my goodness music was just blasting out and and i was trying to even tell him to just lower it down and and so you know i and and so he said you know when we got in the car it says i said you know can you i said i'm a christian he said yeah i'm a christian too and everything he asked me what kind of music he listened i said i only listened to christian music and that was the end of it and the thing came down i didn't even have to say much why because oftentimes we think well you know i gotta go and say this and preach this and and do this and present to him the the mysteries and do this no your very life because remember it's not you the the very life is the life of christ the very attribute is the attribute of christ again the same things that he did in christ he healed the sacred it called the afflicted and and he called the sinners and everything that same life is doing the same thing in you there's not even much words that needs to be said the very life when it's presented will cause the same effect why because it's the same god so it says which one of your god it says let me send you a damn boy which one of your gods can make him whole and give him and and and and and give him give him his hearing and his speech he says that's what i want to see that's what i want to know see it says which one of which one can restore the speech of this boy and everybody was silent you know often time we we we we get engaged into things that we probably shouldn't be in and in the debate of the scriptures and the things all where we need to do is just present christ and what he was send us to do and he said and i said now christianity had been represented to you in the form of doctrine and in pamphlet and in the bible which which i am for it it says 100 but god helps those missionaries to go there and to live god help those missionaries to go there and to live there yes sir but i said it's not fully being represented to you you see it's been represented to you in words only in word only but god that wrote that wrote that word that god already that that you you've got already got places in your heart and now come to a place till he's going to make the world live see make himself make himself in the word he says now i said he stands here stands a lead the death and dumb he can't speak or hear or nothing he's been born that way and the holy ghost is the holy spirit is here and revealed the sins and the things and and the people and just almost fainted when he's when he said when when they said that you know and all of them make so much noise you can't understand because it's cause they just they just had this militia to watch them you know and and and and it was just up and down and my they said people from all over india was there so you don't you he says you couldn't tell what uh uh what was there you see how many or or it says how many or nothing you can't understand it says so then uh this little boy when i brought him up there so here he is it wasn't so much about you know oh let's go to this book and let's do this ceremony it was about god the holy spirit coming down to reveal his word and bringing people into the fault to catching the attention of the people and showing them what god had offered and presented for that time but when i'm says in the message deity of jesus christ he says and brothers and sisters that deity is in you he says a little while the world see me no more but yet you shall see me for i am with you it says even you even in you to the end of the age christ in the manger it says christ in a manger no christ in you hallelujah we are not worshipping christ in the manger but christ in you the holy ghost we and and i talked about even the expression tonight it's easier for us to be gathered and when we worship it says you know god who's in heaven and worship him and god and and and create some type of imagination of the location where god is and everything but the prophet is here telling us it's christ who's in you making sure you know the location of where god is you didn't come here by your own self you didn't save yourself everything about you it's not by yourself it's him that brought you here so when you worship him you look at the god who's taken you out of sin and who's done this great work to bring you here that's the god you worship because when the enemy becomes a living god then he becomes a god that you know that you've seen his works and everything he says the holy ghost it says the hope of the hope of life hallelujah the creator god himself dwelling in human being it does not yet appear what we shall be but will shall but we'll see him as he as he is as he is for will be made like him it says no room for him it says people around here say they are they are christ the churches of christ they go to and what happens last night open up the christianity the christmas present let's see about daddy here there it says what was on the christian what was the christmas tree of many of many men last night set a box of beer somewhere in the room it's set the box of worm of beer it says no room for jesus all for beer open up mom's mama's present a deck of cards cards it says no room for jesus no no room for jesus the cards that's right instead of a little bible or something or something to to the children it's a little g-man book a little something like that no room for jesus instead of going to church they go to the shows dances everything and call themselves christians that's not the life christianity is not a confession of the mouth without the life christianity is just not a man standing there and claiming that i'm a christian and i've been saving all of this and this and here he is the the very in other words as we said you don't even have to open your mouth look your life your very life speaks about it all it says my brother when deity of god by the holy ghost come into a human heart it cults out everything that christ hasn't created you are you know that's the truth and that's the kind of gospel we want we want something not just the refraining of doing something or going there because remember the idea is not for you to come to a place where you stop drinking you stop smoking or that's like even as brother branham is listed no the idea is that spirit comes upon you it uproots everything of the world out of you it puts you into work for jesus christ amen you know because that that's why i i even made that segment it's not the satisfaction that you know i don't feel like drinking beer or going to a bar or going to a club and everything that's not my satisfaction my satisfaction is christ today revealing this flesh my satisfaction is christ walking on this earth doing the same thing that he did when he was here today 2000 years ago and i will say this the manifestation of christ and the characteristics of christ has been manifested in this bride in this end time according to the bible why because christ the mystery of god revealed it was christ the bride revealed in his own flesh he says oh christ the hope of glory in you not in the cradle in you that was one time god was back in the beginning then he came into moses he came into the children of israel in coming two he came into the cradle but now we are worshiping him we are worshipping him way back like some but now we are worshiping him way back like some priests pre prehistorical something when christ is in you the the the worshipping him is something of the past oh we we thank you god because you gave your life for us you died on calvary and and as you as they're praying they they the envisioning the robe and the man with the robe and going on to the cross we thank you for the blessings and your promises never uh coming to a place where we can make any contact between what happened to calvary and you today never coming to a place where there's you can connect it to and say what did what i'm experiencing today is the product of what happened at calvary what's happening in my flesh how i've been saving all those things is a product of what he did why because i can testify a calvary because i'm a living proof not because somebody told me the story not just because it's written in the bible but i'm a living proof because i've seen my life and i know that calvary is real because i'm the result of what calvary produced he says he says in the message israel and the church his picture says well i said i said then do you believe he says do you believe that you can drink i said no i never said that it says a grain a grain of wheat can only produce wheat it cannot produce cocker bird it says there's no desire in it there's no life in it to do it to produce the cocker bird within it to produce the cocker bird with and if we are we in jesus christ he continues on and says paragraph 63 says don't be deceived you had better search this close now see if you keep saying don't condemn me to do this or don't condemn me to do that things of the world it says now i'm going to hurt just a little bit pull the feathers back the other way it says but it's this it's this one one sure evidence that you've never been to christ you've never been born again he that loved the world and the things of the world the love of god is not in him now if you just quit the things if you just quit doing it because you know you ought to do it and quit doing it it says that's the sign that you haven't got nowhere yet it says when that thing becomes dead in you the nature of it is gone away there's another person in there in that only there's only person in there and and it can only produce the holy spirit that was in christ in you it says produces the christ like nature nothing you do what he did he chose he chose that he chose that before the foundation of the world and he drops in in paragraph 66 he said he says someone said well i know i got saved because i quit smoking that wasn't why you got saved that wasn't why you got saved you got saved because god chose you before the foundation of the world to save you god chose you before the foundation of the world to save you that's the scripture teaching amen now you see being found out it's not us it's him he chose us abraham couldn't sell well bless god i come down from the tower of babel hallelujah that's why i got saved he's got he says he'll have saved the whole bunch of he would have saved a whole bunch then if that's the reason why if that's the reason they'd done it he didn't do he didn't do that it's in his program and and i i just want to say this i think there's a beauty for us to look at the word of god and begin to realize that there is a manifestation of christ for within our flesh that is promised for us to do in this end time there's a manifestation or there's a promise in the bible the uh pouring but random says you know i believe it's in the message the mighty god revealed before us it says it's not so much that god emptied himself out but it was that he changed his form from one to another the same god to do the same thing that he promised he would do and i believe if we can if we begin to focus on that tonight coming to the realization that we are being placed here for the manifestation of christ within our flesh like i said i was moved by the testimony of cosmonaut and and and brother uh brother joseph so much that you know it was something that moved within them the word was spoken god spoke to their heart and they move upon that same action and and pravanam says oftentimes he says he even spoke about elijah and all of them he said isaiah and all of them he says it was by them yielding to the word of god he says isaiah spoke things that would make sense he said things that would make sense but yet he said it because why it was yielded to the word of god things that didn't make sense to the head he spoke it anyhow why because it was the spirit of god that moved upon him so that's why it becomes so important that we are the people that are sensitive and can be moved by the spirit of god otherwise all we become is a bunch of learners you know the scripture says this and this and that's exactly what i'm going to do and not being moved by the spirit at all you know when the spirit comes it brings the interpretation of the scripture that's why the prophet can come in this hand it says by god's grace we have received the interpretation of the scripture of the bible what was the interpretation you know he speaks about the the old pharisees how they will come and read the scroll and follow into the action and yes this young man and and i seem to be messing up everything but when i'm asked a question it says what was the vindication the works was not a vindication because they had more works than jesus did the vindication was jesus was doing it according to the promise of that hour jesus was doing it based upon what the spirit moved upon him to do what the word of that hour was written about him or if we could be a people that could come into this place let the spirit move upon us and interpret the scripture for us to walk in it he says question and answer he says i thought this was wonderful it says a french scientist said less than less than three three hundred years ago if a man would ever if a man would ever make the terrific speed of 30 miles an hour gravitation will take him from the earth now this is a scientist right it's got the title of scientists and nobody talks about him he says 30 miles an hour well do you think that scientists would refer back to to him today would refer to to that today far be it no sir it says they got growing about nine nine to ten hundred ten hundred miles an hour yet or something in the rocket it says then sixteen hundred it says sixteen hundred miles an hour still taking him out uh it's still still taking him forward scientist has taken a man more forward greater things with his mind than what it says then what and what's the only thing that is the tree of knowledge father and the ministers taking him with a spirit which is unlimited but here is what it is science is not science and looking back to what science said a few years ago science is taking what they've got now and moving forward for something new something else it says but we asked the preacher well but we asked the preacher whoever says well we'll see what moody said about it we'll see what wesley said about him it says i don't care what they said about it i know what god said about it now i know what god said about it now now i want to say this that's why it becomes that's why the word of god is not dead manner it's not old manner that we continue to eat the same way and we continue to eat it's a revealing of the word of god it's god coming and taking something anew taking something that was written and being bringing the interpretation back to us so we may know what the need is today it's god taking his word and bringing the interpretation of it today you know it's saying here they're not looking back and always in in the equation every time they work out an equation about how to do something and said well keep in mind we said that you know we couldn't go 30 miles an hour no they forsaken that they've taken that aside and everything that's why even the prophet comes and tells us in this time that we couldn't go back and take noah's message and apply today is it the word of god absolutely we couldn't take uh wesley message and apply it today no is it the word of god yes but we've come into a place where god has sent us a prophet and is interpreted as the word for our time is interpreted as the word for our hour he's shown us in the map where we are and what we need to be doing and that word by eating it is translating us into the forward looking of what god wants us to fulfill we could sit here and talk it's uh it's jesus today i'm interested in jesus today i'm interested in seeing jesus talk to me i'm interested in touching the hands of jesus this tonight i'm interested in conversating with jesus i'm interested in moving forward with jesus if the musician could come i was thinking about the story that porter ranum says this woman that he went to the hospital and he was to pray to the with the woman that was just right next to it there was a curtain that was separating them and it was open it says you know let's bow our head and pray and that's how the woman screamed now they said shut down that curtain it says yesterday i said aren't you a christian it says i'm a methodist shut down that curtain and if we're not careful that's what people become i'm a message believer i'm this and this you give yourself a bunch of titles it's not about titles it's jesus christ i want to see him but when it speaks about so we would see jesus it says in order for them to see it they had to go into the manifestation of that hour the veil of god for that moment what was he into it was in the veil called jesus christ and when he manifested himself those that desire to see him saw him within the veil but the critic though that went well you know we got the words of moses and you know we're not going to move away from the word they fail to see god that same creator manifested into a flesh all but those that came with the fervent heart and those that came with expectation and the desire they were able to look past the flesh and see god manifested himself and it's not different from this end time people can look and say jesus i mean you know when they think about jesus they think about this great creature they forget to see that in this end time the manifestation is jesus in the body in a people that don't look like much in just the regular people in just the people walking and going to the same jobs that they're going eating at the same restaurants that they're eating oh if they can only take that opportunity to realize you know if all the people in the bible that things happen too mary wasn't doing anything special she was just walking and doing a regular thing when the angel came to her you know abraham didn't come out and pray for god to hear him and no he was just doing what he did every day and god came into that path that's how god comes and with us it's no different it's you just doing the things that you do every day taking care of your family going to work and doing all those things god is being manifested in those things god has been manifested to those at work god has been manifested in your family god is manifesting in the people that you're coming in contact with the only thing is we have to be surrendered and aware of what it is in the message of paradox it says jesus said a little while the world will won't see me no more but ye but yet you shall see me for i'll be with you even in you john 14 and 12 he said he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also more than this shall he do because i go unto my father it says that's the reason he said in mark 16 the signs shall follow them that believe he says it was it was a living god in a man that could lay himself out before god according to the word of god and the word of god would make them will make would be made manifest in him a man that could lay himself before god and the word of god will be made manifest in him he didn't say he was a superman a man that will lay himself before god and then the word of god will be manifested in other words why was jesus born as a baby he could have just came in as an adult you know and died and and do all of those things but he came because it was for twofold one was to give of his own life so he could save us but the other he was actually creating a way showing a way of overcoming in the human flesh it was showing us how because when we go back and refer ourselves on how we overcome we look at his life it was a life lived within a flesh it was not a life lived just as a god but by him coming one of the purpose was to die but the other was to show us a way to overcome how we confirm the things how we dealt with things how we relied on nothing but what the father showed him and the same spirit that was in christ in the bride prabhanam tells us that she do she does nothing except what god shows her why because that shows that it's the same spirit it says and every time you see a man receive the baptism of the holy ghost that's a paradox how that god of heaven makes himself known to this man he says talking talking through him walking through him living through him it's a paradox and when we are in the image of god and god and and god took of his own image and brought it himself into the image of his own brought into the image of his own image that he made himself it continues on it says god once lived in a man then sinner drove him he said then sin drove him away it says and then god killed his own son and let and then let god come back to live in his own people again yes sir that's a paradox it's strange it's strange things how that he does it the church god chose his church to be a paradox how that he took how that he took instead of the polish scholars making a church the theologian he took a bunch of ignorant unlearned fishermen and he gave them the key to their kingdoms not the caiaphas the high priest learneth what he did what did he do he says he gave it to the ignorant fisherman not a man who knowed all the ins and outs he gave it to a man that had uh that had prostrated himself before him and knowed him now you know not it says not to know him in his book his book is life but to know him his life the keys was given to peter paradox he will do that instead of caiaphasi's the smartest man in the religion realm he gave it to peter he's given it to the people that are coming and bowing before him prostrating themselves before giving themselves before him those are the ones that have the keys and i want to say tonight the keys have been given to you it says has he been hidden to the wise and the prudent but to you is given to know the mysteries of god let's all stand christ in you the hope of glory christ in you jesus christ today that's just by heads our gracious father we're so thankful lord lord oftentimes we don't understand all the ins and outs and but father our hearts desire is to come into a fully manifestation of christ today lord but i believe it's the outcry of every creation to manifest you in the best way that we can oftentimes our flesh comes on the way and we do and we say things father that we don't mean to but lord jesus we have a comfort in our heart to know that you've only manifested yourself to those that the father had given you in the beginning as your prophet said that you save us because it was predestinated for you to come in this age and to save us father i pray that you strengthen us today lord father where we are weak that you may give us strength where we've come short father that you may just give us lord encouragement and help us so we may overcome those things because what we desire more than anything is that manifestation of you lord we ask tonight that you bless each and every one lord father whatever the desire is tonight or the need is tonight lord we committed into your hands and we ask that you move upon it because you promised you will do it you said that ask and ask abundantly that your joy may be full lord we ask that you bless the people lord we commit everything to you we ask that you protect us father be

the laundry and the dishes that the supernatural is happening christ in you the hope of glory what a wonderful privilege hallelujah let's pray heavenly father lord we know we there we know that we

all these big things lord you're asking us to be faithful in the small things you're asking us to be sincere lord and when we have a sincere heart you can use that you can use a person lord that will yield to yourself and what you have and what your word is and then within those things those other things those signs will follow even as brother david's been preaching lord the signs don't go before us lord but when we have your spirit the one we dedicate our lives those things are around us they follow us and those are the things that the people see and draw into you but we want to put you on display we want to be your billboard lord we want to be able to be something that you can reflect yourself off of lord this church is on fire lord and we're just asking that you continue to just deal
