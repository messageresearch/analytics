[35:08] that Divine love that you so possessed
[35:12] thank you Lord and this morning Lord
[35:15] we're in certainly
[35:18] in trying times
[35:21] and we ask this morning that you would
[35:23] stir up our hearts and our minds by way
[35:26] of remembrance
[35:28] that we might serve you even more
[35:32] diligently than we have in the
[35:35] past Lord I ask for special overcoming
[35:40] Grace Lord the battle sometimes seems so
[35:43] long
[35:44] but we will endure with patience and run
[35:48] the race that's set before us we ask you
[35:51] to be with us now in Jesus precious name
[35:54] we pray amen amen God bless you this
[35:58] morning you may be seated certainly nice
[36:01] to be in the house of the Lord this
[36:05] morning uh before we stand and read our
[36:08] scriptures we certainly uh um are
[36:11] grateful for everybody and and uh we
[36:15] want to let you know that we are uh
[36:19] still working a little things out here
[36:22] and there um uh we're especially working
[36:26] on the are conditioning that we can try
[36:29] to get it balanced and where everybody's
[36:33] not too cold now we're always going to
[36:36] have hot people and cold
[36:38] people that's
[36:41] scriptural you you know what I mean so
[36:44] the scripture says either be hot or cold
[36:48] so if you're wanting it perfect it's not
[36:50] going to happen CU we're trying to stay
[36:53] with this Bible the best we can so we we
[36:56] found out that
[36:58] maybe on the sides it's a little cooler
[37:01] than the center and uh that back left
[37:04] corner seems to be a little colder and
[37:07] different places but we're working on
[37:10] that okay so uh bring a sweater and uh
[37:15] and if you seem to get chilly we
[37:18] hopefully we'll get it all figured out
[37:20] one of these days and also we're not
[37:24] really supposed to park in the fire lane
[37:27] so that's the driveway kind of the
[37:30] street in uh there now we've named that
[37:34] street bride way that's what we call
[37:36] that in fact we're even going to put a
[37:39] street sign up that says bride way but
[37:42] it's a way it's not a parking spot so uh
[37:47] we're going to have to work on that so
[37:49] maybe some of the younger brothers tell
[37:51] we get the rest of the parking lot uh
[37:54] cleared out could maybe park down the
[37:57] street or or somebody but we're really
[37:59] not supposed to park in there so we want
[38:02] to do that also uh just for those who
[38:07] don't know um if uh the men's bathroom
[38:12] is on my left or your right and the
[38:15] woman's is on is on my right or your
[38:19] left so this is the men's side that's
[38:22] the woman's side um I I heard some
[38:25] brothers got confused the other day you
[38:28] know um I surely don't want that Spirit
[38:31] to end up in our church so um then uh
[38:36] also uh we have uh a nursery and that's
[38:42] because we're we um this year uh we're
[38:47] um expecting to have 10 births this year
[38:52] so we have um uh this on this side is a
[38:57] Nursery if it's if it's for nursing
[39:01] mothers
[39:02] Nursery this over here is the cry
[39:06] room okay so there's a
[39:09] difference okay it's not an
[39:12] overflow okay so you you should never
[39:15] have two parents in the cry room at a
[39:19] time so it's not a place that you're uh
[39:23] um you just automatically go so you're
[39:26] not in church you say well I have a
[39:29] child that's
[39:30] not uh you know doesn't behave well you
[39:35] know bring them into the house of the
[39:37] Lord and pray and maybe an atmosphere
[39:40] will come and the Lord might be able to
[39:42] do something to help uh help them along
[39:45] the way we're here to raise children in
[39:48] church you know what I mean uh I I know
[39:52] in the world system they they have
[39:55] daycare raise their children have uh the
[39:59] school take care of them and feed them
[40:01] but we want to raise our children and
[40:04] and up in the word of the Lord so that's
[40:08] a cry room it's not a it's for you to
[40:11] take your child in there settle him down
[40:14] uh let them know that U that there's uh
[40:17] if he doesn't behave there's worse to
[40:19] come and then get him back into the
[40:22] house of the Lord and act and raise them
[40:25] up so uh also we have a little box in
[40:28] the back it sits on a counter on it it's
[40:32] written tithes and offerings uh but you
[40:35] also May write a
[40:37] suggestion if you have a suggestion just
[40:40] write a suggestion and and put it in
[40:44] there and we will read
[40:47] them that may be all the further it goes
[40:51] but but
[40:53] um but at least you can voice your
[40:57] opinion don't Corner the deacons and and
[41:01] that just write it down you know what
[41:03] you suggest and and uh uh if if there's
[41:07] something we can do about it we
[41:10] certainly will so we just trust the Lord
[41:14] your blessing today we' like to read a
[41:17] few scriptures and and fellowship a
[41:20] little bit with you this morning out of
[41:23] the message called The Rapture
[41:28] and so let us stand and we'll read a few
[41:30] scriptures this
[41:32] morning we'll get right into our our
[41:35] thought this morning won't try to keep
[41:37] you uh too long and that you might uh
[41:42] enjoy the good things of the Lord so
[41:45] we'd like to start by reading in 1
[41:49] Thessalonians U the 4th chapter and the
[41:52] 13th verse
[41:59] and he's Paul speaking
[42:05] here he
[42:06] says but I would not have you to be
[42:11] ignorant Brethren concerning them which
[42:15] are
[42:16] asleep that ye sorrow not even as others
[42:21] which have no
[42:24] hope for if we believe that
[42:27] Jesus died and rose again even so then
[42:34] also
[42:35] which even even so them also which
[42:40] sleep in Jesus will God bring with him
[42:46] for this we say unto you by the word of
[42:50] the Lord that we which are alive and
[42:54] remain unto the coming of the Lord
[42:57] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[43:01] or shall not hinder them which are
[43:04] asleep for the Lord himself shall
[43:07] descend from heaven with a shout with
[43:11] the voice of the
[43:13] Archangel and with the Trump of God and
[43:16] the dead in Christ shall rise first and
[43:20] then which we we then we which are alive
[43:24] and remain shall be caught up
[43:27] together with them in the clouds to meet
[43:31] the Lord in the air and so shall we ever
[43:35] be with the Lord amen therefore Comfort
[43:40] one another with these words amen isn't
[43:44] that a great comfort amen and let's also
[43:48] turn over to a second Thessalonians the
[43:51] 3 chapter
[43:57] and we'll read uh through the fifth
[44:01] verse he says finally Brethren pray for
[44:04] us that the word of the Lord may have
[44:08] free course and be
[44:11] glorified even as it is with
[44:15] you and that we may be delivered from
[44:19] unreasonable and wicked men for all men
[44:23] have not
[44:24] Faith but the Lord is faithful
[44:27] who shall establish you and keep you
[44:31] from evil and we have confidence in the
[44:35] Lord touching you that you both do and
[44:39] will do the things which we command you
[44:43] and the Lord direct your hearts in the
[44:47] love of God and into the patient waiting
[44:51] for Christ amen and also we just like to
[44:55] read a scripture found in
[44:59] Hebrews the 12th chapter in the first
[45:05] verse wherefore seeing we also are
[45:09] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[45:13] witness let us lay aside every weight of
[45:17] sin which does so easily beset us and
[45:21] let us run with patience the race that
[45:25] is set before for us Heavenly Father we
[45:29] ask you to uh bless your word to us in
[45:32] your precious name we pray amen God
[45:36] bless you may be seated this
[45:42] morning I think one of the greatest
[45:47] uh
[45:49] victories uh and tools to victory for
[45:54] the believer
[45:57] is to recognize the day and the time
[46:01] that they live in and the message or the
[46:05] word to that
[46:07] age uh so again we say that that it's
[46:14] one of the greatest tools to Victory it
[46:18] it's also is what uh establishes the
[46:23] believer and settles the believer that
[46:27] they they might be able to be
[46:29] steadfast because Satan's the author of
[46:33] confusion that's how that he gains
[46:36] Victory is he makes you unstable and and
[46:41] we know that a man that is tossed to and
[46:44] fro by every wind of Doctrine then he
[46:48] becomes unstable in all his ways and
[46:52] there's a
[46:53] continual uh uh result of
[46:57] instability uh you're not sure of where
[47:00] you're going you don't send a sure
[47:03] message uh you you don't have a sure
[47:07] testimony uh your light can't shine uh
[47:10] in any specific direction or or or you
[47:15] you fact you you when you're unsure you
[47:18] don't have much backbone you don't you
[47:21] can't stand up and make a stand you you
[47:24] lose the ability to be affirmative
[47:27] and and to hold the position so if if
[47:31] you're not uh if you're not sure and you
[47:35] don't have Clarity then it's very easily
[47:38] to be tossed to and fro and and to be
[47:41] carried
[47:42] about and the the result of that is is
[47:45] it doesn't even uh it doesn't even
[47:49] signify uh any light there's not light
[47:53] that can come uh from an unstable uh uh
[47:58] person or someone that is not stable in
[48:02] their ways you wouldn't look to that
[48:04] person as an example or if I could say
[48:07] it that way you wouldn't follow somebody
[48:09] who didn't know where they're going uh I
[48:12] remember a story that was uh told to me
[48:16] the first time that I I went up into the
[48:19] hills of of West Virginia and and any of
[48:23] you have been in that country it's just
[48:25] hills and everywhere and a fellow got
[48:28] lost so he got behind a
[48:31] fella and so he was following this guy
[48:34] staying right behind him the GU going
[48:36] down Hills and hollers and everything
[48:39] and all of a sudden the guy stopped you
[48:41] know and it was real foggy out you you
[48:44] just hardly could see the the front of
[48:46] your car it was so foggy and the guy
[48:49] stopped and so he got out of his car and
[48:52] walked up to the guy and said why' you
[48:54] stop the guy said I'm in my driveway
[48:59] see he he was following somebody but he
[49:04] didn't even know where the guy was
[49:06] going and I I just say that because it's
[49:09] important that we recognize where that
[49:13] we
[49:14] are and uh and that we have Clarity on
[49:20] on what it is that we recognize the day
[49:23] that we're living in the hour what we're
[49:26] living and and what is the message to us
[49:30] what it is is that God speaking to you
[49:34] what it is that he wants you to hear
[49:36] what it is that he wants you to
[49:38] recognize but everything that God does
[49:41] he does with the purpose so there
[49:43] there's nothing that's happening here
[49:46] and if I could say it this way if if you
[49:48] would allow me to to say it that the the
[49:52] the whole focal point of God and
[49:56] everything he he does is his elect lady
[50:00] a a amen everything is based on you the
[50:04] grace of God the love of God is directed
[50:07] to you so and and he doesn't want you to
[50:12] get caught up a good soldier doesn't
[50:16] entangle themselves in the Affairs of
[50:19] the world uh you know we as we as a
[50:23] human beings we measure uh and compare
[50:27] ourselves one with another and uh you
[50:31] know our countryes at a time where
[50:33] they're going to pick a new leader or
[50:35] the same leader whichever way they
[50:37] decide to go but you know really that's
[50:40] not who's the the lord of the air and
[50:44] the ruler of this Earth You know what I
[50:47] mean so it doesn't matter what they're
[50:48] doing that's not who we want governing
[50:51] in our lives we don't want our lives
[50:54] governed by the government we don't want
[50:56] our lives governed by science we don't
[50:58] want it governed by
[51:00] education our our desire is that the the
[51:05] word of the Lord Reigns in our hearts
[51:07] and that that's what we want we want to
[51:10] have sure Clarity and understanding of
[51:14] what God's message is to us and and and
[51:19] what is our place and our
[51:23] participation
[51:24] uh what what is the thing that we want
[51:27] to do uh we're not trying to straighten
[51:29] out the world but we are trying to
[51:32] manage Our Lives according to the word
[51:35] of God and so uh we we certainly notice
[51:41] I I believe that we're uh we're
[51:44] definitely in perilous times I don't
[51:47] think there's
[51:49] um any question about those things I
[51:54] think that we we notice uh that uh
[52:00] there's definitely wars and rumors of
[52:03] wars it it's striking to me
[52:07] when uh you hear commentators can you
[52:11] hear newspaper headlines and radio
[52:14] flashes that uh our country is closer to
[52:18] world war or the world is than they've
[52:21] been in so many
[52:23] years um that is quite a uh striking
[52:29] thing um no doubt uh many of you have
[52:33] heard that uh that you know they're
[52:38] launching rockets and
[52:41] missiles um at Israel and Israel is
[52:46] retaliating back and and in our country
[52:51] now uh on the
[52:53] streets everywhere just college campuses
[52:58] in the streets all all across the uh the
[53:01] land is a a crying voice death to Israel
[53:06] you know do away with Israel uh and you
[53:10] know whether the world likes it or not
[53:12] that's God's children they're God's
[53:16] people um uh we know that their eyes
[53:21] were
[53:22] blinded uh for our sake the G sake that
[53:27] we might be able to uh hear the
[53:32] gospel uh uh and that he might also have
[53:37] a gentile bride and so we we find
[53:41] ourselves and if I could say it this way
[53:45] uh what do you think right now is going
[53:49] on in the minds of those that are
[53:54] spiritual in uh
[53:57] Israel maybe whether the 144,000 whether
[54:02] we understand where they are or who they
[54:05] are uh uh and that's not the point I'm
[54:10] trying to clarify this morning but I
[54:12] imagine there's people there now that
[54:16] are in deep consideration of the time of
[54:20] Israel what what is happening to our
[54:22] country what is the future of our nation
[54:26] and uh we know that there's a political
[54:29] Israel but we also know that there's a
[54:32] spiritual
[54:33] Israel amen but and you know and we know
[54:37] that not all Israel is Israel if we
[54:40] could say it that way but there's an
[54:42] election and God always deals with the
[54:45] elect people uh other people are there
[54:50] but the God's elected plan for his
[54:54] people that's the reality of what's
[54:58] transpiring it's it's not uh what the
[55:01] newspaper says the New York Times is not
[55:06] the explainer of
[55:08] reality uh radio stations Fox News CNN
[55:14] NBC
[55:15] ABC they are are not the uh uh
[55:21] explainers of
[55:23] reality uh we know is the scripture
[55:27] tells us that to to watch Israel you
[55:30] know what I mean watch the Fig Tree
[55:32] watch what's happening and if if and I
[55:37] I'm trying to talk this about where our
[55:39] place is if they are under the
[55:45] threat of
[55:47] elimination and now people can vocally
[55:51] speak out and divide our nation over the
[55:55] the court or the destruction of Israel
[56:00] so if in the timeline in the time piece
[56:04] that God's put there and you know our
[56:06] messenger told us to look to them and to
[56:09] watch them is that there there's
[56:12] actually an effort to uh take them out
[56:17] and and so if we could say that their
[56:21] clock is
[56:23] ticking you know what I mean it's
[56:25] running out they're in a fight for their
[56:29] survival they're they're actually uh uh
[56:33] there's a measure of war and and and
[56:38] instability that uh people feel that
[56:41] they can strike out and eliminate and
[56:45] what stopped that for so long is the
[56:48] United States of America stood up and
[56:51] said you you you harm Israel you harm us
[56:55] but we're not there
[56:57] anymore you understand that's not a
[57:01] conclusion that our country is United
[57:05] behind
[57:06] anymore another we're not we as a
[57:11] whole and as a nation we're not sure now
[57:16] about our stand for
[57:19] Israel and I'm not trying to go to the
[57:22] politics side of it but I do want to
[57:26] go to the time piece of it the to the
[57:32] recognition that there's something going
[57:35] on over there and I as I see what's
[57:38] politically going on I wonder what that
[57:43] uh Orthodox Jew that uh that believer
[57:48] there that's deep with into the
[57:50] scriptures and and and I've been told
[57:53] that they study the the word of of God
[57:57] Is So their their lives are given to
[58:00] reading the original Scrolls and the
[58:02] Scrolls and knowing the word of God that
[58:04] you could take a book of the Bible and
[58:07] and roll it up and take a needle and
[58:10] press it through the the the rolling of
[58:14] that and they could tell you what words
[58:16] that that needle
[58:19] penetrated in other words they know
[58:21] their scripture they know their
[58:23] prophecies I wonder what they're seeing
[58:25] how that they're determining their
[58:27] prophecy what what what time do they
[58:30] think that they're
[58:32] in then they're sitting there as a
[58:34] nation so not only politically are they
[58:37] going through a great conflict but I
[58:39] wonder where the where the believer is
[58:43] the the the the real devout one that
[58:46] looks to serve God and and to live by
[58:49] God and live by the Commandments and and
[58:52] keep themselves purified and is keeping
[58:54] the law and is doing all that they can
[58:57] to stay true to the to Israel I wonder
[59:02] what the uh I wonder what the uh uh
[59:06] beating of their heart is what their
[59:09] mind is what and reading it and knowing
[59:12] that there's God somewhere in it
[59:16] all in other words there's go Where's
[59:18] God what's he what's going on what's
[59:21] transpiring what's taking place uh uh
[59:26] something's on the move here the spirit
[59:28] of God's moving God fixing to move is it
[59:31] the time of the
[59:32] Messiah uh could you imagine the
[59:35] spiritual questions the trouble with us
[59:37] we sit
[59:39] numb you know we we sit on Church
[59:42] benches not even recognizing that God's
[59:45] moving there there's great events that
[59:48] are taking the place things are coming
[59:50] to pass uh a rapid the the signs are
[59:54] everywhere the fashing Red Lights of the
[59:56] sign of his coming is flashing flashing
[1:00:00] flashing uh things that are prophesying
[1:00:03] uh prophecies are coming to pass right
[1:00:06] and left and and we sit back and and and
[1:00:10] we be we we're
[1:00:14] unengaged we just think that all things
[1:00:18] continue as they are where is the sign
[1:00:21] of his coming uh where is uh the
[1:00:25] awareness or uh uh the alertness uh or
[1:00:29] the
[1:00:31] self-examination or anything that uh
[1:00:35] takes place uh it it just you know
[1:00:39] that's what they said oh we've been here
[1:00:42] before all things go on the same and in
[1:00:46] the last 20 years uh the moral decay of
[1:00:52] of our country is is
[1:01:01] unspeakable and it ought to
[1:01:04] be it ought to be sending
[1:01:07] signals it to say it as easy as I can it
[1:01:14] uh I believe we call it a wakeup call it
[1:01:18] ought to be a wakeup call uh to our
[1:01:22] country that we've seen so many of the
[1:01:25] things things that our Messenger
[1:01:28] prophesied to us that he revealed to us
[1:01:32] in seed form we actually see it growing
[1:01:36] at to in into strong bushes and plants
[1:01:42] but not only that now they're putting
[1:01:44] forth their
[1:01:46] fruit and people eat the fruit thereof
[1:01:51] remember the the death you know was the
[1:01:55] partake of the life of of the of the
[1:02:00] fruit of the tree of of of Good and
[1:02:04] Evil and it that partaking of that tree
[1:02:09] and I'm not going to go into serpy but
[1:02:11] it bore
[1:02:12] children it had
[1:02:14] Offspring and if you don't think the the
[1:02:17] philosophies and the teachings and and
[1:02:21] the things that are are transpiring now
[1:02:24] are bearing children
[1:02:26] they're they're raising people that
[1:02:28] think that way they're raising people
[1:02:30] that stand for those kind of
[1:02:33] things so you're you're not in your
[1:02:35] isolated world if I could say this
[1:02:38] darkness is creeping in all around us
[1:02:41] until it becomes
[1:02:44] dark the thinking's dark the actions are
[1:02:48] dark it becomes a Godless nation and the
[1:02:52] scripture says not wishing to retain God
[1:02:54] and their knowledge God has given them
[1:02:57] over to a reprobate mind and and I hate
[1:03:01] to say it this way but soon our whole
[1:03:03] world and our whole country and
[1:03:05] everything's going to be run by a bunch
[1:03:07] of
[1:03:09] reprobates people that don't consider
[1:03:12] God that are lying all their hope into
[1:03:15] science and education and they think
[1:03:17] they're going to fix the future you know
[1:03:20] uh dig a hole in the ground and escape
[1:03:23] the atomic bomb you know fly to the moon
[1:03:25] and live in another place in in in
[1:03:28] everything there's only one flying away
[1:03:30] I want to do and it's Way Beyond the
[1:03:35] moon so we realize that that
[1:03:42] the our
[1:03:44] course and our path to
[1:03:47] Victory is to
[1:03:50] recognize the day that we're living
[1:03:53] in to
[1:03:55] to overcome means to recognize Satan in
[1:04:00] every one of his
[1:04:04] tricks the the Overcomer must
[1:04:09] recognize the two spirits in the
[1:04:12] framework of the church and withstand
[1:04:15] the other
[1:04:16] one and and the we want to withstand if
[1:04:21] I could say it this way as we just read
[1:04:24] in Hebrews we we want to withstand the
[1:04:28] laziness the
[1:04:30] lukewarmness we want to withstand the
[1:04:34] Amnesia that that's upon the church we
[1:04:38] want to with understand the
[1:04:41] complacency that we we find out in our
[1:04:44] daily lives that uh our routines uh just
[1:04:49] keep us at the same path that we are
[1:04:52] sort of like what we would say treading
[1:04:54] water or running on a treadmill running
[1:04:57] and not going anywhere but we've got to
[1:05:01] we've got to shake ourselves if I could
[1:05:04] say it that way and bear witness that
[1:05:07] there's something going
[1:05:10] on there's something going on we need to
[1:05:13] recognize what is
[1:05:16] happening what's happening in our
[1:05:19] country what's happening in the world
[1:05:22] what's what's transpiring what what is
[1:05:25] God's message to us are are do we have
[1:05:28] the vision uh clear of where we are and
[1:05:33] what it is that we need to prepare for
[1:05:39] and are we preparing and
[1:05:43] and
[1:05:44] because if I could interject this
[1:05:48] is along with
[1:05:51] recognizing the day and its message and
[1:05:55] recognizing the time that we are living
[1:05:58] in and and recognizing the circumstances
[1:06:02] and the spirits that we're fighting
[1:06:05] along with the recognition of this and
[1:06:08] the realization of where that we are a
[1:06:11] and where that we need to be uh presents
[1:06:15] to us great
[1:06:18] opportunity great opportunity to rise in
[1:06:22] spiritual
[1:06:23] Heights uh so
[1:06:26] you know that's a uh I don't want us to
[1:06:29] miss the
[1:06:32] opportunity that lays before us this
[1:06:36] morning to obtain the victories that
[1:06:40] we're so need of and the spiritual
[1:06:44] growth that we're so need of and the the
[1:06:48] the the most important event for the
[1:06:53] believer is the rapture
[1:06:58] there there's nothing that's more
[1:06:59] important to the believer than the
[1:07:03] Rapture now we're living in the age of
[1:07:06] lady oia so it it's it's a age where
[1:07:10] people are blind miserable poor wretched
[1:07:15] naked and don't know
[1:07:18] it and they they feel that they they
[1:07:23] don't have need of anything because thou
[1:07:26] sayth Thou Art
[1:07:28] rich and clothed in fine
[1:07:31] riment that we have need of
[1:07:35] nothing
[1:07:37] and that is a reality that a lot of us
[1:07:41] sometimes can't even recognize when
[1:07:43] we're in that condition
[1:07:47] ourselves you know when we're
[1:07:50] self-willed and a way Seth right unto a
[1:07:53] man but the end of that way is death
[1:07:56] uh they they uh AR aren't subject to any
[1:08:02] type of leadership but their own
[1:08:04] discernment and and so a man sets his
[1:08:07] course he just he's uh he thinks he's
[1:08:11] right he thinks he's on the right path
[1:08:13] and he has no measuring he has no
[1:08:16] measuring stick whatsoever to uh to view
[1:08:22] his life he doesn't have a mirror to
[1:08:25] look at
[1:08:26] and he doesn't have a yearim thund you
[1:08:29] know something that uh is uh uh he he he
[1:08:34] goes to in in the time of uncertainty
[1:08:37] and and and the time of seeking
[1:08:40] leadership he doesn't have something
[1:08:42] that he goes to something that becomes
[1:08:45] his absolute something that draws a
[1:08:48] clear picture for him that he can say oh
[1:08:52] this is where I am it's like in the mall
[1:08:57] or you'll go and you'll have these signs
[1:09:00] up and and all of a sudden there's a
[1:09:02] button that says you are
[1:09:05] here
[1:09:07] now do you this
[1:09:09] morning in your
[1:09:12] life have a spot in your life that says
[1:09:17] you are
[1:09:21] here that's
[1:09:23] important it's important to morning that
[1:09:26] you know where you
[1:09:28] are we've we've discussed for months and
[1:09:31] years and years preaching to the church
[1:09:34] who they are who you are who you are who
[1:09:37] you are but I A lot of times it doesn't
[1:09:40] matter who you are if you don't know
[1:09:41] where you
[1:09:44] are and I I I think it's real important
[1:09:47] that the church recognizes where are we
[1:09:50] what is going on where are we where are
[1:09:53] we in time where are are we what day are
[1:09:56] we in what's transpiring what's God
[1:10:00] doing uh how's the spirit moving and man
[1:10:04] offers all kinds of
[1:10:06] substitutes man offers Revival we we sat
[1:10:09] here and we preached through the message
[1:10:11] of the hour and and talked and and
[1:10:13] showed it in the scriptures how that
[1:10:15] there would be a false
[1:10:18] Revival and and and we've seen those
[1:10:21] revivals come and
[1:10:23] go but there's one thing that has not
[1:10:25] changed is the law of God's word the
[1:10:29] word is always
[1:10:33] correct and so even though in a
[1:10:37] sermon I could never cover it exactly
[1:10:41] all perfect but I I will just try to uh
[1:10:46] shed a little bit of light if I could
[1:10:49] not in the way of
[1:10:51] explaining but in the way of stirring up
[1:10:54] our Pure your mind that we
[1:10:58] ourselves would examine ourselves and
[1:11:02] take a look at our
[1:11:04] position uh uh our positioning and our
[1:11:08] spiritual growth and our
[1:11:10] spirituality to take a look at our lives
[1:11:13] to see where our effort is going what
[1:11:16] are our labors into uh you know have I
[1:11:20] gained any
[1:11:21] ground uh if a person's working working
[1:11:24] working and they're not gaining any
[1:11:27] ground financially they're not
[1:11:30] gaining any accomplishment at all it's
[1:11:33] time that that person sits down and
[1:11:35] considers the fact you know I might
[1:11:37] consider doing something
[1:11:40] else this isn't getting me
[1:11:44] anywhere you know it might be as simple
[1:11:46] enough as asking your boss for a
[1:11:50] raise you know but if you're not going
[1:11:53] to continually do the same thing over
[1:11:56] and over again and expect to get
[1:11:59] different results the results have
[1:12:02] already proven they've already been
[1:12:06] Vindicated you do this you do this you
[1:12:08] do this look at where you are go back
[1:12:12] five years look at what you were doing
[1:12:14] well look where you are you know if if
[1:12:17] you got a ton of credit card uh debt now
[1:12:20] and you go back five years and you say
[1:12:23] oh you know I I I I had a bunch of
[1:12:26] credit card debt I got rid of this I did
[1:12:28] this I got rid of the credit card debt
[1:12:30] and now you got a big old bunch of
[1:12:32] credit card debt it might be a good
[1:12:35] thought to you that something you're
[1:12:38] doing ain't
[1:12:41] right that's on the carnal
[1:12:46] side that's the natural side and we know
[1:12:50] a lot of times the natural types the
[1:12:52] spiritual so we're talking a minut this
[1:12:55] morning that it behooves us to have a
[1:12:59] recognition of the time that we're
[1:13:02] living and what message are we
[1:13:06] receiving what what are we hearing God
[1:13:10] speak to us because this is not a
[1:13:13] staying message this is a leaving
[1:13:18] message we're not here to preach how to
[1:13:21] make life easier for you here and how to
[1:13:25] get along Paul just absolutely taught us
[1:13:28] in one sentence how to get along he says
[1:13:31] pray for us that we don't have to
[1:13:33] contact unreasonable men cuz all men
[1:13:38] don't have
[1:13:41] faith pretty simple what you hang around
[1:13:46] with so let us just take a moment if I
[1:13:49] could say it this way and we'll go back
[1:13:52] to Thessalonians
[1:13:55] here
[1:13:56] and and read this
[1:14:00] scripture once again found in first
[1:14:05] Thessalonians and he says and Paul says
[1:14:09] for this we say unto you the 15th verse
[1:14:12] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:14:15] the Lord that we which are alive and
[1:14:18] remain until the coming of the Lord
[1:14:21] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[1:14:25] shall not hinder for the Lord himself
[1:14:29] shall descend from heaven with a
[1:14:32] shout with the voice of an archangel and
[1:14:36] with the Trump of God and the dead in
[1:14:39] Christ shall rise
[1:14:42] first and we want to just take a moment
[1:14:44] if I I could to
[1:14:48] uh
[1:14:50] uh read a few statements and comment on
[1:14:54] that because I certainly believe that's
[1:14:58] where we
[1:15:02] are we are living in the day of the
[1:15:09] voice of the shout the voice and the
[1:15:15] Trump we're living in that
[1:15:19] time and and and that day and uh
[1:15:25] there's things that we
[1:15:27] certainly know for a fact and and one of
[1:15:31] the things we know for the fact is that
[1:15:34] the Rapture is only this Rapture that
[1:15:38] we're talking about is only for the
[1:15:45] bride this Rapture that we're talking
[1:15:47] about is only for the bride so if I
[1:15:53] consider myself
[1:15:55] bride then I realize what is for me is
[1:16:01] for the
[1:16:02] bride so I I've got I've got to come to
[1:16:06] that conclusion I'm that bride I'm the
[1:16:10] bride so therefore if this Rapture is
[1:16:14] for the bride is for this elect lady is
[1:16:18] for this chosen people there's an elect
[1:16:21] people that are going to be raptured or
[1:16:26] translated or are going to be caught up
[1:16:29] into the air uh with the Saints to meet
[1:16:33] the Lord in the air and forever to go be
[1:16:36] with the Lord so we got to ask ourselves
[1:16:39] do I number myself among those
[1:16:45] people that's do I number myself am I
[1:16:49] one of
[1:16:50] them and now if if that's the promise
[1:16:55] for the bride that elected people that
[1:17:00] is promised this resurrection and we
[1:17:03] know that's the last event on the
[1:17:07] horizon for the
[1:17:10] believer is the catching away of the
[1:17:14] church and so if that's what is
[1:17:18] in my future I will use that word
[1:17:22] because it even though it could be this
[1:17:24] morning
[1:17:25] morning then
[1:17:28] it I I imagine if I believed for certain
[1:17:33] that I was going to take a
[1:17:35] trip I would prepare for that trip I
[1:17:39] would make sure I had my documents I
[1:17:42] would make sure I had my my
[1:17:46] ticket I would make sure I had my
[1:17:50] itinerary now you don't want to travel
[1:17:53] with me because I just pull into a place
[1:17:56] and figure we work it
[1:18:00] out you know Leslie and I we we went to
[1:18:05] a country to do a wedding so we were
[1:18:07] very close by so we thought we'd fly
[1:18:09] over to Ireland so we flew into Dublin
[1:18:13] and we got to Dublin and we thought man
[1:18:16] this Dublin hotels everywhere you know
[1:18:19] well it was the same weekend they had
[1:18:22] this band I guess they called them
[1:18:25] YouTube
[1:18:27] YouTube
[1:18:29] YouTube YouTube or whatever and the
[1:18:33] national
[1:18:35] Irish Soccer
[1:18:38] Championship there wasn't a room in
[1:18:40] Dublin
[1:18:42] anywhere and here we are just dragging
[1:18:44] our bags up and down the road wondering
[1:18:46] where's the hotel is there a hotel you
[1:18:48] got room no no
[1:18:51] rooms so finally some guy said hey I
[1:18:54] think I know where there's a
[1:18:56] room now when I say room what do you
[1:19:00] think you think a room a hotel room
[1:19:03] right bathroom a bed dresser couch a
[1:19:08] room right a room no this was a
[1:19:12] room which most of us in America call a
[1:19:19] closet so we found a bed in the closet
[1:19:23] why cuz we didn't have an
[1:19:25] itinerary we didn't have a
[1:19:30] reservation not basically we were
[1:19:33] unprepared for the circumstance that
[1:19:36] presented ourselves thank God for a good
[1:19:40] Praying
[1:19:41] Wife because we would have spent our
[1:19:43] first night in the
[1:19:45] park if it wasn't for somebody just
[1:19:48] coming along and guiding us to a
[1:19:52] room well this is too great
[1:19:55] of an issue to take
[1:19:58] lightly you don't want to miss your
[1:20:02] departure time you want to be on
[1:20:06] time you want to be prepared you want to
[1:20:10] make sure you've got the token You' got
[1:20:13] to make sure you're going to pass
[1:20:15] through customs you're your your
[1:20:17] everything has got to be
[1:20:21] ready and so
[1:20:25] we see that these great things and and
[1:20:29] so we realize
[1:20:33] that it's only the bride that's going to
[1:20:36] go in this Rapture and I'd like to read
[1:20:38] this from
[1:20:39] paragraph 65 and
[1:20:45] 66 but to the church the bride the
[1:20:50] Rapture is a revelation to her yes
[1:20:57] amen so it takes it Beyond just being an
[1:21:02] event
[1:21:04] am the Rapture is more than a date on
[1:21:08] the
[1:21:10] calendar the Rapture is a revelation or
[1:21:14] if I could say that a faith it's a
[1:21:19] condition you've got to be in rapturing
[1:21:22] condition if the same spirit that that
[1:21:24] was in Jesus Christ dwell in you it'll
[1:21:27] Quicken your mortal body so it wouldn't
[1:21:31] matter about the time frame if I could
[1:21:34] say it's April 15th or it's April 30th
[1:21:38] or or if I said a time or a date which
[1:21:41] no man knows that but it still wouldn't
[1:21:47] matter if you didn't have the spirit in
[1:21:50] you that quickened you when that time
[1:21:54] came
[1:21:55] right so what would be more important
[1:21:57] knowing the time or having the spirit
[1:22:01] that quickened you when that time came
[1:22:04] that's why he didn't care that we knew
[1:22:07] the time because the importance wasn't
[1:22:10] on the time the importance was on the
[1:22:14] condition the condition that you're
[1:22:20] in that's what's
[1:22:22] important that that you're ready for the
[1:22:26] event and God never brings judgment now
[1:22:30] the Rapture to you might be a great
[1:22:32] Victorious thing if you're a Believer
[1:22:35] but it's judgment to the rest of the
[1:22:38] world that's right cuz the only thing
[1:22:41] that's holding this place together now
[1:22:43] is the
[1:22:44] believer and she's few and far in
[1:22:48] between and she's got lots of spots and
[1:22:51] wrinkles in her feast
[1:22:55] she's
[1:22:57] invaded with the
[1:23:01] lukewarm with the Sunday
[1:23:04] churchgoer with the person that doesn't
[1:23:07] wash feet and doesn't take communion
[1:23:10] that that doesn't contribute and and
[1:23:15] administer to the
[1:23:17] body lot of
[1:23:21] Benchwarmers that's not just in this
[1:23:24] Church such just the
[1:23:26] world but they've been taught that the
[1:23:28] Rapture is a time it's going to happen
[1:23:32] one day and when it happens it happens
[1:23:34] and alls I have to do is uh be a
[1:23:38] believer Satan believes the thing that
[1:23:41] Satan lacks is Resurrection Life a life
[1:23:47] that can resurrect
[1:23:49] him now I don't so say those things to
[1:23:53] condemn anybody body but if I could say
[1:23:56] this it's to wake them up wake them up
[1:23:59] who do you think you're
[1:24:02] fooling you can pray like an angel and
[1:24:05] live like a
[1:24:06] devil it just it
[1:24:10] it there's no way we
[1:24:13] know by comparing ourselves one to
[1:24:16] another there's only one thing you can
[1:24:19] do as an individual is stand up into the
[1:24:22] face of your own real it and ask
[1:24:25] yourself the depth of your sincerity how
[1:24:29] committed am I to the Rapture how
[1:24:32] committed am I to making it how how well
[1:24:35] is that everything to
[1:24:39] me or would I like to schedule it in my
[1:24:42] time uh book you know whatever you call
[1:24:45] those books where you write your dates
[1:24:48] and
[1:24:49] stuff and say okay the Rapture will fit
[1:24:52] in for me
[1:24:55] between July 25th and July 27th other
[1:24:59] than that I'm pretty packed
[1:25:04] Lord you should have
[1:25:07] nothing in the whole world more
[1:25:11] important to you than making the
[1:25:17] Rapture it is the most single thing to
[1:25:21] do now don't fear
[1:25:25] you don't have to make it he will guide
[1:25:28] you he will instruct you he will lead
[1:25:32] you he will provide for you everything
[1:25:35] that he needs to provide for you and the
[1:25:38] first thing he wants to provide to you
[1:25:41] is the
[1:25:42] recognition of the hour that you're in
[1:25:45] so you can make
[1:25:47] preparation the time is at
[1:25:51] hand it's a revelation
[1:25:54] that the Revelation the true bride of
[1:25:58] Christ will be waiting for that
[1:26:01] revelation of the Rapture the true bride
[1:26:04] of Christ will be waiting for that
[1:26:08] revelation of the Rapture Give me a
[1:26:11] definition of the true bride of Christ
[1:26:13] one who's waiting for the revelation of
[1:26:16] the
[1:26:18] Rapture they're looking for
[1:26:22] it what's the sign of it what's the sign
[1:26:26] of his
[1:26:28] coming wh what what what are the
[1:26:30] flashing red lights how am I going to
[1:26:32] know how am I going to know that uh I'm
[1:26:37] getting close look at the message look
[1:26:41] at the day look at the events look at
[1:26:43] the flashing lights that are flashing
[1:26:46] out in front of you and say wait a
[1:26:48] minute I just might be at the doorstep
[1:26:51] of the
[1:26:52] Rapture amen
[1:26:57] I might I might take heed to what's
[1:27:01] important what I'm praying
[1:27:06] for I might get serious for a moment and
[1:27:10] I preaching this to me
[1:27:13] especially now it's a
[1:27:16] revelation for Revelation is Faith you
[1:27:20] cannot have Revelation without it being
[1:27:23] faith faith is a revelation because it's
[1:27:26] something that's revealed to you faith
[1:27:30] is a revelation faith is something that
[1:27:34] has been
[1:27:35] revealed to has been revealed to you
[1:27:39] like it was to Abraham that could call
[1:27:43] anything
[1:27:44] contrary to what has been revealed to
[1:27:47] him as though it wasn't so
[1:27:54] I don't care what goes on out
[1:27:58] there if I'm fixed on that
[1:28:01] Rapture I understand what's going on
[1:28:05] what's taking place how it's
[1:28:08] unfolding and I can sit right back and
[1:28:11] say I'm in the midst of the unfolding of
[1:28:14] the revelation of the Rapture it don't
[1:28:18] matter what's happening out
[1:28:22] there I got sing less of
[1:28:29] heart that's what faith is it's a
[1:28:31] revelation of God the church is built
[1:28:34] upon a revelation the whole entire
[1:28:41] body and and we we we follow that down
[1:28:45] and we understand and one of the
[1:28:47] greatest Revelations we had but in the
[1:28:50] book was
[1:28:52] written but then remember remember it
[1:28:55] was sealed with Seven Seals and the
[1:28:58] Seven Seals was not to be opened
[1:29:00] Revelations 10 until the sounding of the
[1:29:05] last Earthly angel on Earth Revelations
[1:29:09] 10:7 and in the day of the sounding of
[1:29:13] the last Angel's message seventh Angels
[1:29:17] the mysteries of God should be finished
[1:29:19] in that age and that's the age we're
[1:29:23] living in
[1:29:25] look now we've at least established that
[1:29:27] we're in the end
[1:29:30] time and the sign of the end
[1:29:33] time if I could say this in humility
[1:29:37] wasn't the pulls that brother renam used
[1:29:41] to to catch the attention of the
[1:29:46] people because everybody went out and
[1:29:49] impersonated
[1:29:51] that everybody was taking people by the
[1:29:54] hands everybody had oil everybody's
[1:29:58] Discerning just made a complete mockery
[1:30:02] of
[1:30:03] it but when it came down to it only the
[1:30:08] word of God through a prophet could
[1:30:11] reveal what was in those Seven
[1:30:14] Seals and it would only be revealed to
[1:30:17] the elect to whom that it was written
[1:30:21] because it was assigned to her
[1:30:26] that you're in
[1:30:29] the the coming of the
[1:30:33] Lord when the angel descended and took
[1:30:36] the book in his hand and put his foot on
[1:30:40] the land in the sea all those beautiful
[1:30:43] types we've seen in our generation come
[1:30:46] to pass John was going to write but he
[1:30:50] said don't write in the days of the
[1:30:52] voice of this angel he will reveal what
[1:30:55] was written in
[1:30:57] here and and man had been probing at it
[1:31:03] forever always throwing it down in the
[1:31:06] future and the messenger made this
[1:31:07] statement he said you'll find out that a
[1:31:10] lot of what you're looking for has
[1:31:11] already come to
[1:31:14] pass and then when we saw the seals open
[1:31:18] we saw the beauty of God laying out
[1:31:20] seven Church ages and then coming right
[1:31:23] back and watching those horse riders
[1:31:25] move up through those Seven Ages and
[1:31:28] actually reveal to us that most of it
[1:31:30] had already taken
[1:31:34] place and now we're in the last part of
[1:31:38] it we're in our part of it your part of
[1:31:43] it this is the part that you're a part
[1:31:47] of this this is the thing that he's
[1:31:50] flashing before your eyes that that you
[1:31:54] can see what's
[1:31:58] transpiring again we'll read now the
[1:32:02] Rapture is only the Rapture that we're
[1:32:05] talking about is only for the
[1:32:08] bride remember the Bible said and the
[1:32:11] rest of the Dead live not for a thousand
[1:32:14] years this great
[1:32:19] Rapture is there not a Rapture friends
[1:32:24] where are we
[1:32:26] at where are we going what are we going
[1:32:30] to do what age are we living in listen
[1:32:35] to these great questions paragraph
[1:32:39] 81 the these are the questions that he's
[1:32:42] asking now he's not asking them they're
[1:32:47] unbelievers these questions are to you
[1:32:50] cuz you're the only ones reading the
[1:32:52] message you're the the only one that
[1:32:54] recognize he's a prophet you're the only
[1:32:57] ones that's that that heard that voice
[1:33:00] and were attracted to it so these
[1:33:02] questions are to
[1:33:04] you they're your
[1:33:08] questions these are the things he's
[1:33:10] wanting you to
[1:33:13] consider is there not a Rapture friends
[1:33:17] Jesus said I call you friends because
[1:33:19] what you know what I'm doing that's
[1:33:23] right
[1:33:27] if you're a friend of a prophet you
[1:33:29] receive what a prophet's reward what
[1:33:33] does God what's the prophet's reward God
[1:33:36] does nothing until he first reveals it
[1:33:38] to a servant the prophet the reward that
[1:33:42] you have of being a friend of the
[1:33:44] Prophet is the revelation of what the
[1:33:47] prophets revealing
[1:33:49] [Applause]
[1:33:56] he he said is there not a Rapture
[1:33:58] friends where are we
[1:34:01] at where are we at right now this
[1:34:05] morning what is going
[1:34:08] around on around us and where's our
[1:34:11] button that says this is where we're
[1:34:17] at what are we going to
[1:34:21] do great question
[1:34:24] what are you going to do now that you
[1:34:27] know who you are you know where you're
[1:34:28] at what are you going to do you ever
[1:34:31] hear the expression what are you going
[1:34:33] to do about
[1:34:37] it you know what are you going to
[1:34:40] do if you know something's broken you go
[1:34:44] oh uh the car's
[1:34:46] broken
[1:34:49] duh what are you going to do about it
[1:34:53] are you going to fix it are you going to
[1:34:56] junk it are you going to buy the part
[1:34:59] are you going to sell
[1:35:01] it but you can't do
[1:35:05] nothing hear me this morning you can't
[1:35:08] do
[1:35:11] nothing you've got to get give yourself
[1:35:14] a
[1:35:15] good understanding of where you're at
[1:35:18] and do
[1:35:20] something what age are we living
[1:35:28] in what promise do we
[1:35:36] have there is going to be a Rapture the
[1:35:40] Bible says there will be and it'll it'll
[1:35:45] be only for the elect the elect lady the
[1:35:50] bride in this day that's pulled out the
[1:35:56] church and and so we we say in this day
[1:36:01] so we understand one of the first things
[1:36:03] that's happening is a pulling
[1:36:07] out we already know the seed separates
[1:36:10] from the Shu but there's also a pulling
[1:36:13] out so that's happening within you
[1:36:16] there's got to be a pulling out away
[1:36:19] from the world there's got to be a
[1:36:21] laying down of other goals and other
[1:36:25] Ambitions and placing the Rapture in its
[1:36:29] proper place that's what I'm living
[1:36:33] for that's what I'm waiting for I'm
[1:36:36] waiting for the rapturing faith I'm
[1:36:39] waiting for the Revelation now where
[1:36:41] does faith come from it comes from the
[1:36:44] word of God and hearing the
[1:36:47] word so if he wants to give you this
[1:36:50] Faith he's got to show you what's trans
[1:36:53] inspiring so you can see it and have
[1:36:57] eyes have and see and say whoa this is
[1:36:59] where I'm at I'm in the midst of it
[1:37:01] right
[1:37:05] now it's going
[1:37:10] on and what's my
[1:37:14] response now as far as I'm concerned I
[1:37:16] see nothing but
[1:37:20] Saints and everybody around you can see
[1:37:23] Saints
[1:37:25] the most important thing is what do you
[1:37:27] see in
[1:37:30] yourself and how do you measure your own
[1:37:33] self so the a real question would be are
[1:37:38] you being
[1:37:39] pulled because that's what this is he
[1:37:42] says the bride in this days that's
[1:37:46] pulled
[1:37:48] out so he's trying to pull us out
[1:37:52] there's a a a pulling out that's
[1:37:55] transpiring here the a a a a separation
[1:37:59] of what's happening now he's going to
[1:38:02] tell us that three things take
[1:38:05] place he says three things
[1:38:08] happen a shout a voice a
[1:38:13] trump has to happen before the Lord
[1:38:19] appears now a
[1:38:21] shout Jesus Does all three of
[1:38:25] them when he's when he descends
[1:38:30] descending now man you've got to
[1:38:33] understand man's problem is is they
[1:38:36] think
[1:38:37] literally or they think in a straight
[1:38:40] line so they think this event's got to
[1:38:44] happen then this event's got to happen
[1:38:47] then this event got to Heaven there
[1:38:50] they've always been taught step one step
[1:38:53] two step three I talked with my
[1:38:56] architect today and visiting with him
[1:38:58] the other day and we were visiting he
[1:39:00] says the biggest problem people have is
[1:39:03] they can only see one
[1:39:05] line they can't visualize in three
[1:39:09] dimensions but as Architects we got to
[1:39:14] think
[1:39:16] dimensionally and that's the way man
[1:39:19] thinks he thinks this then this than
[1:39:24] this but we understand that he does all
[1:39:27] three of
[1:39:29] these he's a God of all space in all
[1:39:33] time he can do more than one thing at a
[1:39:39] time just like he's not three persons
[1:39:44] he's father son Holy Spirit one person
[1:39:48] in three offices he can possess and
[1:39:51] operate all three offic
[1:39:53] at one
[1:39:57] time so first it's not oh I see this
[1:40:03] happening and I'll kind of blow that off
[1:40:05] but when I see this happening
[1:40:08] no no he does all of these things when
[1:40:12] he's
[1:40:14] descending when he comes forth to take
[1:40:18] the book when he comes forth he's doing
[1:40:22] all of these things that the the same
[1:40:23] time when he makes his move to man all
[1:40:27] these things are transpiring they're all
[1:40:31] going on at the same
[1:40:35] time you can't sit back and say oh
[1:40:38] there's a shout here and next is this
[1:40:42] and next is that no it's all
[1:40:48] happening it's all
[1:40:50] transpiring it's all going on a
[1:40:52] perfectly according to his
[1:40:55] time you say well I thought Israel God's
[1:40:58] dealing with
[1:41:00] Israel he's dealing with them more than
[1:41:03] theyve ever been I imagine there's just
[1:41:05] think in that country where a country
[1:41:07] just launched a a a rocket at you and it
[1:41:10] could have been
[1:41:12] nuclear and they've got so much
[1:41:15] hatred that they don't care if they nuke
[1:41:21] you oh we just living under such a false
[1:41:25] sense of false
[1:41:35] security he
[1:41:37] says he says has to happen before Jesus
[1:41:41] appeared now a shout Jesus does all
[1:41:45] three of them when he's descending a
[1:41:50] shout what is a shout it's the mess
[1:41:53] message going forth first the living
[1:41:57] bread of life bringing forth the bride
[1:42:00] hall now God has
[1:42:03] always God has a way of doing things and
[1:42:07] he never changes his policy he never
[1:42:11] Chang he's he's un unchanging God in
[1:42:16] Amos 3 and 7 he said he would do nothing
[1:42:20] on Earth until first he revealed it to
[1:42:23] his servants the prophet and just as
[1:42:26] certain as he promised it he'll do
[1:42:31] it now here's the messenger telling the
[1:42:35] church hey the shouts going on The Voice
[1:42:39] is going on the Trump is going on he's
[1:42:42] doing all three of these things but man
[1:42:45] is caught up in this
[1:42:47] lineal event AB C D no
[1:42:54] God's way beyond our timeline that's
[1:42:58] right or us figuring it
[1:43:03] out he
[1:43:06] says he says so he promised he'd do
[1:43:11] nothing he opened the seals he discerns
[1:43:15] the thoughts and intents of his heart we
[1:43:17] don't have to go into the ministry of
[1:43:19] the son of
[1:43:21] man but we are trying to did get this
[1:43:24] morning is to stir stir up our Pure
[1:43:26] Hearts by way of
[1:43:30] remembrance he ordained these things to
[1:43:33] be and he must send this the first thing
[1:43:37] comes when he starts descending from
[1:43:40] Heaven there's a shout what is it it's a
[1:43:44] message to get the people together so if
[1:43:50] the message is here the descending has
[1:43:53] has already
[1:43:57] started it's on its
[1:43:59] way so you're in the process of
[1:44:02] it you understand it's it's
[1:44:05] started it
[1:44:08] started now if you got a single event in
[1:44:12] your mind a date and you're lineal and
[1:44:16] you think oh it's a date it's a time
[1:44:18] it's a place but when you realize it's a
[1:44:21] revelation it's a condition
[1:44:23] that God's going to reveal to his elect
[1:44:26] lady his bride what is going on and what
[1:44:30] I'm doing because we're his friends and
[1:44:33] then we can sit back and look at the
[1:44:35] picture and by looking at the picture we
[1:44:38] might take heed and realize it's time to
[1:44:41] get
[1:44:44] ready I'm going to try to
[1:44:47] hurry well I maybe spent too much time
[1:44:50] trying to lay a foundation but it's said
[1:44:53] the first thing to come he starts
[1:44:54] descending from Heaven there's a shout
[1:44:57] what is it it's a message to get the
[1:44:59] people together a message comes forth
[1:45:03] first now it's lamp trimming time rise
[1:45:08] and TR trim your
[1:45:11] lamps what watch what watch was that it
[1:45:16] was the seventh not the sixth the
[1:45:18] seventh behold the bridegroom cometh
[1:45:21] rise in trim your lamp and they did some
[1:45:25] of them found they didn't have any oil
[1:45:28] in the lamp see but it's lamp trimming
[1:45:31] time it's Malachi 4 time
[1:45:35] when when you come
[1:45:38] it's Luke
[1:45:41] 177 it's Isaiah and all those prophecies
[1:45:46] that it can perfectly set in order for
[1:45:49] this day in the scriptures
[1:45:53] we see it living right
[1:46:00] there see there's see these things
[1:46:04] happen my dear brother sister when God
[1:46:08] in heaven knows I could die in this
[1:46:10] platform right now you just ought to
[1:46:13] walk around a while it's just tremendous
[1:46:17] when you see God coming forth from the
[1:46:21] heaven
[1:46:23] hallelujah what he saying the walk
[1:46:26] around is just tremendous when you see
[1:46:28] God coming forth from the heaven Lord
[1:46:31] give me isab that I might
[1:46:34] see he's coming forth from the
[1:46:37] heaven it's a revelation to the bride
[1:46:40] but he can't do it until he first
[1:46:42] reveals it to his servant the
[1:46:45] prophet and then through the word of God
[1:46:48] he gives the Revelation to the believer
[1:46:51] that they too can look up
[1:46:53] for they know their Redemption draws
[1:46:55] nigh and they can see him coming from
[1:46:58] the
[1:46:59] heaven
[1:47:06] Glory when you see God coming from the
[1:47:09] heaven standing for groups of men and
[1:47:12] standing there declaring himself just as
[1:47:15] he he ever did and that's the truth and
[1:47:19] it's the Bible open see we're here
[1:47:32] now let's just take this in closing and
[1:47:35] I I'm I I won't I'll just read two more
[1:47:38] statements and I'll wrap the point up he
[1:47:43] says so we know that there's a shout a
[1:47:47] voice and a
[1:47:50] trump and he he he he goes on to say he
[1:47:54] says the first
[1:47:56] thing is the sounding the first thing
[1:48:00] is the Trump or the voice no a shout and
[1:48:04] then a voice and then a trump a shout a
[1:48:07] messenger getting the people together
[1:48:10] second is the voice of the Resurrection
[1:48:13] the same voice a loud voice of in St
[1:48:17] John 11:38 and44 that called Lazarus
[1:48:21] from the grave getting the bride
[1:48:28] together and then the resurrection of
[1:48:32] the Dead to be caught up with it watch
[1:48:36] the three things take
[1:48:39] place he's not talking about the future
[1:48:44] if and he'll say it here in a little bit
[1:48:47] but it's a voice of the Resurrection yes
[1:48:51] so you know we were dead in trespass and
[1:48:55] sin yes we were we were spiritually dead
[1:49:01] but there was a voice that awakened us
[1:49:04] up the sleeping bride it awakened her
[1:49:08] wake
[1:49:10] up it it it it it's the the the shout
[1:49:16] contains the voice contains the
[1:49:20] trumpet it's not oh we're just in this
[1:49:22] part of it the next part of it coming no
[1:49:25] there's something big going on here it's
[1:49:28] the end of time is going on here it it's
[1:49:31] it's taking place we've arrived we're
[1:49:35] [Music]
[1:49:37] here it ought to make a
[1:49:40] shout or get
[1:49:42] sincere or go home and apply the
[1:49:50] token he says now watch the
[1:49:53] three things take place the next is what
[1:49:57] was a
[1:49:58] trump a shout a voice a trump now the
[1:50:03] third thing is a trump which is always
[1:50:06] the Feast of the trumpets is calling the
[1:50:09] people to the
[1:50:12] feast and that'll be the bride supper
[1:50:17] the Lamb's supper with the bride in the
[1:50:20] sky but what takes place it's a
[1:50:25] calling an
[1:50:27] invitation so he's offering the
[1:50:29] invitation to the wedding
[1:50:32] supper he he has a shout to get you to
[1:50:37] gather you up a uniting time and sign
[1:50:40] it's a voice to call you out of the Dead
[1:50:43] Slumber of sin and dead religions out of
[1:50:47] your spiritual grave and it's a trump
[1:50:50] calling you to the feast so you just
[1:50:53] don't hear the message and then this is
[1:50:56] the invitation to the wedding of
[1:50:59] supper you're not going to get another
[1:51:02] one it's not going to come another
[1:51:06] way you know the parable how he sent his
[1:51:09] servants out and finally he sent his son
[1:51:12] what do you think came in this
[1:51:16] generation what do you think the son of
[1:51:18] man was what do you think he did when he
[1:51:21] came and he took the
[1:51:26] book that's why this generation is
[1:51:29] guilty for the second crucifixion of
[1:51:32] Jesus
[1:51:34] Christ what was transpiring in this
[1:51:37] message was the beginning of the Rapture
[1:51:40] of the
[1:51:43] church the events were
[1:51:49] unfolding the shout was the message the
[1:51:52] voice wak up the sleeping virgin listen
[1:51:55] what he says see the first things come
[1:51:58] forth is his message calling the bride
[1:52:01] together the next thing is a
[1:52:04] resurrection of the sleeping bride the
[1:52:07] one that's dead back in other ages
[1:52:10] they're caught together and the Trump
[1:52:13] the feast is in the heavens in the sky
[1:52:16] what is it that's the thing that's
[1:52:19] taking place friends am amen amen we're
[1:52:25] already we're right there ready now the
[1:52:30] only thing is the church coming come out
[1:52:34] has got to lay before the sun and ripen
[1:52:37] the great comine will come by after a
[1:52:41] while the wheat will be burned the shock
[1:52:44] but the grain will be gathered into the
[1:52:50] Garner so
[1:52:53] you can look at
[1:52:55] it and if I could say this way our
[1:52:59] messenger explained it the word of God
[1:53:01] has a compound
[1:53:03] meaning so if he ever does one thing he
[1:53:06] does everything the same way over and
[1:53:08] over again that's the law of things so
[1:53:13] so he has his bride so he's going to
[1:53:16] have a shout for the bride he's going to
[1:53:19] have a voice for the bride and he's
[1:53:21] going to have a trumpet for the bride
[1:53:23] the one TR the trumpet's calling Israel
[1:53:26] to the Feast of the trumpets but it's
[1:53:28] calling the bride to the wedding supper
[1:53:31] that's right it's not only is it calling
[1:53:34] the Dead the in the church before call
[1:53:38] calling them to life but it's calling
[1:53:41] the bride that's alive on the earth it's
[1:53:43] calling them to
[1:53:46] life the Resurrection Life the spirit
[1:53:50] life the Revelation that's going to
[1:53:52] Rapture not only is it a trump calling
[1:53:56] them to their feast it's a trump calling
[1:53:59] us to the Feast of the wedding
[1:54:02] supper so it's going transpiring in the
[1:54:05] natural and it's transpiring at the same
[1:54:08] time in the spiritual to the
[1:54:10] bride parallel going on compound
[1:54:18] meaning uh there's not much time left
[1:54:24] it's all
[1:54:26] happening and I could let me just put
[1:54:28] this in here for
[1:54:31] the what Paul said in Hebrews
[1:54:34] 121 you know let us run the race before
[1:54:38] us you know what ripening of the sun is
[1:54:44] it's
[1:54:46] it's it's
[1:54:49] overcoming that's what it means to ripen
[1:54:52] means to overcome yes sir what does it
[1:54:55] mean to mature it means to overcome and
[1:54:59] and I like to just say this to you you
[1:55:01] know pick one
[1:55:04] thing and overcome
[1:55:06] it don't try to overcome the whole world
[1:55:09] don't try to overcome everything that's
[1:55:12] wrong with you do it one thing at a
[1:55:15] time how did he gr go to Richmond I
[1:55:20] think the quot he took it one City at at
[1:55:22] a time one thing at a time pick that one
[1:55:25] thing in your life that you know is not
[1:55:27] right and deal with it get that put away
[1:55:31] then go to the next one go to the next
[1:55:33] one
[1:55:35] overcome but don't be so caught up with
[1:55:40] everything that's wrong with you that
[1:55:42] you don't move it
[1:55:46] all it's like having so many stuff on
[1:55:48] your plate that you just go in circles
[1:55:51] do I do this do I do this do I do this
[1:55:54] do I do this and then you stop and you
[1:55:57] go no maybe I do
[1:56:00] this pick
[1:56:02] one do
[1:56:04] it check off the
[1:56:07] list this is done this is
[1:56:12] done I did this my most successful days
[1:56:15] is when I write a list of everything I
[1:56:17] have to do I check it off I check it off
[1:56:19] I check it off I get it done
[1:56:23] but when I
[1:56:24] don't then I have a bunch of half
[1:56:27] tackled tasks I got a bunch of undone
[1:56:32] things the last thing the bride does she
[1:56:35] sits in the sun she's got her invitation
[1:56:38] to the wedding
[1:56:39] supper she's been brought to
[1:56:42] life by the voice of the
[1:56:48] Resurrection she's heard the
[1:56:51] shout that unites her with the
[1:56:54] bridegroom and they have the invisible
[1:56:56] Union the prophet of God said the
[1:56:58] wedding takes place
[1:57:07] here let us
[1:57:09] mature
[1:57:15] sir therefore the message calls the
[1:57:17] bride together
[1:57:20] see the shout and the Trump the same
[1:57:23] morning with a loud voice he screamed
[1:57:27] out with that shout and the voice and
[1:57:32] woke
[1:57:33] Lazarus with a loud voice saying Lazarus
[1:57:36] come forth see and the voice wakes up
[1:57:41] the sleeping bride the sleeping dead and
[1:57:45] the Trump with the sound of the Trump
[1:57:49] and when it does it always a trump calls
[1:57:52] Israel to the Feast of the trumpets
[1:57:55] which was the Pentecostal Feast the
[1:57:57] great feast in the sky and the Feast of
[1:58:01] the trumpet and now a trumpet
[1:58:04] denounces a calling together Calling To
[1:58:07] The Feast now what is the the Lamb's
[1:58:11] supper in the sky the assembling
[1:58:14] together in the bride the Feast of the
[1:58:18] trumpets the wedding supper and so I'm
[1:58:22] I'm I made my note this is our call to
[1:58:24] the
[1:58:25] supper you've been
[1:58:27] invited you've been called put on the
[1:58:30] wieding
[1:58:32] Garment get ready to
[1:58:34] go so we we see you know a trump also
[1:58:39] denotes
[1:58:41] war and so we see God's dealing with
[1:58:45] Israel and when we see the Fig leaf fig
[1:58:49] tree put forth as leaf we know that the
[1:58:53] Gentile days are
[1:58:56] number when we see Israel they may have
[1:58:59] a Palestinian State they may have a
[1:59:02] border I don't care about that I know
[1:59:04] one thing there's a spiritual Israel in
[1:59:07] there that's on their knees before God
[1:59:10] Amen that search in the prophecy that
[1:59:13] wants to know where they're at and what
[1:59:16] the promises are for this day I wouldn't
[1:59:19] be surprised at all if if the very word
[1:59:23] of God that God fulfilled brings them
[1:59:25] all that come across this
[1:59:28] message yes I don't know I can't
[1:59:30] prophesy that but I know what contains
[1:59:33] the truth I know where the Mysteries are
[1:59:37] I know where the revealed word of God is
[1:59:40] I know where Jesus Christ is
[1:59:46] revealed but that's our Victory yes sir
[1:59:50] is to know
[1:59:52] who we
[1:59:53] are where we are what it is we're facing
[1:59:58] and what's going
[2:00:02] on the
[2:00:05] shout the
[2:00:07] voice and the Trump they're in full
[2:00:10] swing yes they're in full
[2:00:14] array they're
[2:00:16] accomplishing the purpose of each one of
[2:00:19] them that's right he's doing them all
[2:00:21] that the the same time they're all at
[2:00:25] work they're all
[2:00:28] performing what they were intended to
[2:00:31] perform and You by the grace of God
[2:00:34] thank you Lord because God could do
[2:00:37] nothing unless he first reveals it to
[2:00:40] the prophet yes sir comes to you elect
[2:00:45] lady and opens up Hallelujah the whole
[2:00:50] process
[2:00:52] of what's going on

[2:01:36] to grab victories we're not trying we
[2:01:39] don't need to talk our way out of
[2:01:43] things you know you can't love your way

[2:01:56] help just like my little woman that
[2:01:58] washed Jesus's feet prophet of God said
[2:02:01] she thought in her mind if I go down
[2:02:04] there and wash his feet he'll know what
[2:02:07] I do he'll know where I got the
[2:02:12] money he already knows what you're

[2:02:46] no man lights a candle and P puts it
[2:02:49] under a bushel but he lights that candle
[2:02:52] handle like no man has thus saith the
[2:02:55] Lord and doesn't tell the world you know
[2:02:57] what the prophet of God said he
[2:03:00] said if the God told me thus saith the
[2:03:03] Lord George Washington would rais from
[2:03:06] the grave you know what he said he'd
[2:03:09] do I'd tell the whole
[2:03:14] world because it's the word of God you
[2:03:17] don't have to have if you hide it you
[2:03:19] ain't got it
[2:03:22] it's the word of
[2:03:23] God and if we

[2:05:45] descending from
[2:05:49] Heaven you may see something else
[2:05:52] you may read that differently than I
[2:05:55] read it and I can certainly understand
[2:05:58] that and you certainly have a right to
[2:06:02] read it in the way that you choose to
[2:06:06] but the one thing I do implore you to do
[2:06:09] is read it yes listen to it pray for
[2:06:13] Revelation and see what God is

[2:07:09] shout and the
[2:07:11] voice and the Gathering of the Bride to
[2:07:14] that wedding
[2:07:17] supper have I really taken seriously the
[2:07:20] invisible Union of the Heavenly
[2:07:23] bridegroom and the Earthly
[2:07:27] bride or have I
[2:07:32] been rocked
[2:07:34] asleep and
