[33:32] praise God he's so good let's pray our
[33:36] heavenly father we're so thankful
[33:39] that the love that you had for us
[33:42] father it was eternal
[33:44] it was your love that brought us forth
[33:47] from your mind
[33:49] into the existence of a word state
[33:52] and father then from there you
[33:55] manifested Us in flesh
[33:57] father can we return us one day soon to
[34:01] have that Eternal fellowship with you
[34:03] we're so grateful father we ask that
[34:06] what we're here
[34:08] we can fight the good fight of faith
[34:11] that your love would be shed abroad into
[34:13] our hearts
[34:15] that we can share you father with those
[34:18] that are in need father pre-adventure
[34:20] that they too might be hungering and
[34:23] longing for your presence father guide
[34:26] our footsteps for we know they are
[34:29] ordered by you
[34:31] father we just ask that our atmosphere
[34:34] would be one such that was pleasing to
[34:38] you father help us to grow in you we
[34:42] pray in the precious name of the Lord
[34:45] Jesus Christ we pray amen
[34:49] amen we've been studying our little uh
[34:54] study here in Nehemiah so let's go back
[34:57] and read the
[34:59] ninth verse here of this great scripture
[35:04] and watch it unfold the forest and thank
[35:09] you person God is so good
[35:12] he said then he we remember we read in
[35:17] the eighth verse that
[35:19] um
[35:20] he is now beseeching the Lord
[35:24] and he's praying to the Lord he's heard
[35:27] that Jerusalem it lays in waste a great
[35:30] portion of it still
[35:32] uh that the labor has ceased their
[35:36] uh
[35:38] for the people in Jerusalem have grown
[35:41] cold and
[35:43] formal and they have no leadership
[35:48] and so the and they're in sore condition
[35:52] and there's a lot of critics and
[35:54] reproach and mockery going on and it it
[35:59] just tears Nehemiah up and so now he's
[36:02] praying the Lord he says remember I
[36:04] beseech Thee the word that thou
[36:08] commandest thy servant Moses saying if
[36:12] ye transgress I will scatter you abroad
[36:15] among the Nations so he has discerned
[36:19] that
[36:21] that they have been scattered abroad
[36:24] and because of that he knows the reason
[36:28] that they've been scattered abroad was
[36:31] because they didn't keep his
[36:32] Commandments so that's the first thing
[36:35] he acknowledges he acknowledges the
[36:38] existing condition that the word
[36:41] described Lord we're sorry that we
[36:45] sinned that's why we are where we are in
[36:49] the shape that we're in
[36:51] we accept that it's our fault
[36:55] you know it's it's not the other guy's
[36:58] fault it's our fault you know it wasn't
[37:01] the other guys that were out of the will
[37:02] of the lord we were out of the Will O
[37:05] Lord we're the ones that gave them
[37:07] occasion to come in against us why
[37:10] because we let our wall down
[37:13] and so that's what we're talking about
[37:15] the path of restoration and so then he
[37:18] goes on to say this he says
[37:22] but if he turn unto me and keep my
[37:27] commandments so now what is he doing
[37:29] he's carrying out the word he's turning
[37:33] unto the Lord
[37:35] he's following the pattern he's
[37:37] following the word it's not just in his
[37:40] mind but he's actually putting it to
[37:43] practice in his life
[37:46] so if the scripture says call out unto
[37:48] the Lord
[37:49] call out
[37:51] if the scripture says let your voice be
[37:53] known let it be known
[37:56] you know I mean you could bring the word
[37:59] into flesh form
[38:01] and so if then he says here he said
[38:05] that if we turn unto me and keep my
[38:08] Commandments and do them
[38:12] though there were of You cast out
[38:17] unto the uttermost parts of the heaven
[38:22] I will gather them from
[38:25] fence
[38:26] and bring them unto the place that I
[38:30] have chosen to set my name there father
[38:34] we'd ask your blessing on the word your
[38:38] precious name we pray amen may be seated
[38:43] um
[38:45] go again I'm I love history though uh
[38:49] history is hard for me because history
[38:52] is full of names nobody has
[38:56] and uh they're all tongue twisters
[39:00] and they count backwards and you know so
[39:04] the smaller the date the longer it is
[39:07] and and so all that stuff always been
[39:10] difficult to me uh I I always loved
[39:14] geography because the mountains didn't
[39:16] go nowhere
[39:17] you know you could stay with those but
[39:20] so we're following this story here of
[39:25] the burden that came on nehemiah's heart
[39:27] because he has a desire
[39:30] to see Israel
[39:33] and Jerusalem restored
[39:36] so we know that when the children of
[39:40] Israel just a brief story we know that
[39:44] the children of Israel after 400 years
[39:48] captivity in Egypt we know how we they
[39:51] got there there was a famine in the land
[39:54] Abraham sent his sons and and we know
[39:59] that Joseph was set there to prepare
[40:02] pharaoh and finally the rest of his
[40:04] brothers came to uh Egypt and when they
[40:09] saw it was good they took their father
[40:11] and they brought them all down and they
[40:14] dwelt in the land of Egypt and they
[40:17] could go out there until a pharaoh came
[40:20] and didn't know their name and they were
[40:22] held in captivity
[40:24] and so as they were held in captivity
[40:27] there for those 400 years God sent Moses
[40:31] and Moses delivered them with a mighty
[40:35] hand amen just think if God before you
[40:40] who can be against you the whole world
[40:43] can be against you but God will go
[40:45] exceedingly and abundantly beyond what
[40:49] the world can even ask or think and so
[40:53] he delivered them out and so when they
[40:57] went to
[40:59] a Mount Sinai
[41:01] and they were on their way to the
[41:04] promised land and God spoke to him we
[41:07] know that they immediately fell back
[41:11] Israel has always had a problem and it's
[41:15] a type of the Church of being distracted
[41:18] by the world
[41:19] part of why we're going through this
[41:21] history is so that we can understand
[41:24] because we're talking about having a
[41:26] faith restored that it doesn't matter
[41:29] what's happening in history God's plan
[41:32] is is on its path also
[41:37] and and he's going to raise up men and
[41:41] women all down through this journey in
[41:45] order to keep his plan moving and and
[41:49] and and and bringing people and bringing
[41:52] involvement and he changes the course of
[41:55] history when he needs to change it
[41:58] in order that his word might be
[42:02] fulfilled and so we know if we follow
[42:05] the history of the children of Israel
[42:08] that they they come to the place and
[42:11] they get the Ten Commandments and they
[42:13] have the Ark of the Covenant and they
[42:15] told them what they need they put the
[42:18] Commandments in there and they have this
[42:20] art of the Covenant and we know that at
[42:24] that time dwelt in behind Badger skins
[42:27] we know the story David tried to bring
[42:30] the Ark in and he was supposed to be
[42:33] carried on the shoulders of the priest
[42:35] and we we know those stories of how that
[42:39] then after that man died they sent the
[42:42] ark and they set it aside and David had
[42:45] a desire in his heart
[42:47] to build a temple but so in the meantime
[42:52] Israel was growing
[42:55] they were in a land filled with milk and
[42:57] honey they're surrounded by the
[43:01] the amorites the Hittites and all these
[43:05] are these uh uh
[43:08] descendants of Ishmael and they're in
[43:13] different tribes and they're in
[43:14] different uh Nations and different
[43:17] kingdoms and these kingdoms are small
[43:20] but they're growing in population the
[43:23] world is growing it's increasing in
[43:26] number education is increasing science
[43:29] is increasing the civilization is on the
[43:34] move and it's increasing and so we find
[43:38] out that that the the tribes of Israel
[43:42] they all United and decided they wanted
[43:45] a king
[43:47] and that King they chose was Saul and
[43:50] they chose Saul because he was a mighty
[43:52] warrior and and they wanted somebody who
[43:56] could fend off the enemies that kept
[43:59] coming in and Samuel withstood him and
[44:03] said wait a minute God's been our
[44:05] defense all this time he's far fought
[44:09] our battles and he's saying if you get a
[44:11] king he's going to take your sons and
[44:14] put them into the army he's going to
[44:16] take your daughters and put him into
[44:18] servitude he says you're going to have
[44:20] to pay taxes and everything that they
[44:23] chose to have man rule over him because
[44:27] they wanted to build a kingdom they
[44:30] wanted to have an army protect them they
[44:33] wanted to move from something that was
[44:35] spiritually going to protect them to
[44:38] something carnal that they could tell
[44:40] they could know they were safe because
[44:43] there was safety in numbers they could
[44:45] know that they were a kingdom because
[44:48] they were prospering economically and
[44:51] God had already promised them you take
[44:53] care of the lead elevates I'll take care
[44:55] of you that was God's covenant with them
[44:58] and you can read all these great laws so
[45:01] we know that that what took place then
[45:03] is that you know again uh the
[45:07] Philistines came and to David Rose out
[45:10] and he slew the Philistines and it built
[45:13] fear amongst all the little countries
[45:16] around and Saul's Kingdom grew but we
[45:20] know again that the stories of of of
[45:23] Israel we won't go into all of them but
[45:26] Saul was eventually slain and they put
[45:29] David as king
[45:31] and David's heart's desire was to build
[45:35] the temple and to have a place that the
[45:38] ark could dwell that the presence of God
[45:41] would be and so uh Nehemiah is referring
[45:46] to that Temple place where God dwelled
[45:51] and we know when Solomon prayed his
[45:53] prayer that the whole Temple was filled
[45:56] with the presence of God that's where
[45:58] the high priest went into the ark and he
[46:01] had to have the rope and Bell tied upon
[46:03] him and and all the great Traditions
[46:07] around the presence of God being there
[46:09] but God is fixing to change
[46:13] at the end of this Exodus so these are
[46:18] all the fruits of the first Exodus of
[46:21] them coming out of of uh Egypt going in
[46:26] and having a land and building a temple
[46:29] where the ark dwells in but we know soon
[46:33] that God is going to change that
[46:35] Dwelling Place he's not going to dwell
[46:38] in the temple
[46:39] anymore
[46:41] but he's now going to dwell
[46:44] in a man
[46:46] and it's going to turn from the temple
[46:49] dwelling to him saying this is my
[46:52] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased as well
[46:55] and later even for us as Gentiles that
[46:59] he would now move in and and dwell in us
[47:03] so as as the is as the Jewish Kingdom
[47:07] is growing and David's
[47:11] David has his uh
[47:14] uh uh uh Kingdom and now his kingdom
[47:18] goes to Saul I mean this uh to Solomon
[47:23] it was a glorious golden age for Israel
[47:27] he was wise he knew how to do business
[47:32] he had treasuries and wealth and they
[47:36] prospered and they were in prosperity
[47:39] and and and he ruled in this golden age
[47:43] and it was beautiful but when he finally
[47:46] came down to and it was one United
[47:49] Kingdom Israel there was basically we
[47:54] saved kind of three provinces were all
[47:57] in it a Galilee and then Samaria and
[48:01] Judea but all that was Israel and they
[48:05] were all United under King Solomon and
[48:09] they were glorious age and people came
[48:12] to seek the wisdom you know these
[48:13] stories of your Bible but we're just
[48:16] talking of this because we want us all
[48:20] to understand that the world is still
[48:23] going on
[48:26] do you understand there's activity in
[48:29] politics and civilizations and conquest
[48:32] and rumors of war and almost if I could
[48:36] say it like today the world's going on
[48:39] it's still doing things but in the midst
[48:41] of the world God's Eternal plan is
[48:45] unfolding
[48:46] and can unbelief doesn't stop God
[48:49] circumstances doesn't stop God he knows
[48:52] what he's going to accomplish he's going
[48:54] to accomplish it and what men thinks are
[48:57] their great works and their Great
[48:59] accomplishments are only small little
[49:02] tools in the great plan of God to bring
[49:06] his eternal purpose to pass
[49:09] so we know what happens Solomon goes off
[49:11] the scene and his son rail Bond
[49:15] takes over
[49:17] but he's a harsh King
[49:20] and and he he he
[49:23] despises the people of the north and so
[49:27] they Rebel and the Kingdom of Israel is
[49:31] divided in two parts it what was
[49:34] referred to as Israel which is uh
[49:38] Galilee and Samaria and Judea to the
[49:43] South so rareboam takes a hold of
[49:45] Jerusalem jeroboam takes the North
[49:49] and we know it's not wrong until
[49:52] jeroboam gets mixed up in all kinds of
[49:55] stuff they doesn't the fam they don't
[49:57] stay with the word of God they'll get
[49:59] involved in adultery and all those
[50:01] things so now we're at the place
[50:05] where we talked this this morning the
[50:08] Syrian Kingdom
[50:10] comes in
[50:12] remember Syria
[50:14] was before
[50:16] Babylon
[50:19] okay so the Assyrian kingdom comes in
[50:22] and they take all of the north of
[50:25] Samaria into captivity and Judah if the
[50:30] country of Judah is left to strive on
[50:33] its own
[50:34] so in that time the syrians then
[50:38] eventually prepare a
[50:43] prevail
[50:44] against Judea and it's all swallowed up
[50:47] in the Syrian Kingdom but about that
[50:51] same time that Civil War is going on
[50:54] within Syria and Nebuchadnezzar Rises up
[50:58] and Babylon takes over Syria
[51:02] Nebuchadnezzar's the king and he goes
[51:05] and he goes over and he enters in to
[51:09] that portion of the Syrian country and
[51:14] raids the temple
[51:16] destroys the temple steals all the
[51:20] vessels all the gold everything out of
[51:23] it and and takes it and and and we know
[51:27] the great Bible stories that that follow
[51:31] and they're over there just making
[51:34] mockery of God and we know the children
[51:37] of Israel Shadrach neshach and Abednego
[51:41] and the stories that begin to fall in
[51:43] the scripture so we're to the point now
[51:47] then what takes place is Babylon now is
[51:51] the power that controls uh Jerusalem
[51:57] because they've captured the ground the
[51:59] syrians had the leadership of Syria has
[52:03] changed in the Babylonian leadership
[52:05] they're under captivity now we're
[52:08] reading our story at that time Cyrus
[52:11] came and he came and took all of that
[52:14] Kingdom and even more and so now we find
[52:18] where Nehemiah is so we know that what
[52:22] we're seeing here is God's plan
[52:25] and leading all the countries of the
[52:29] world all falling in place civilization
[52:32] because God's preparing another Exodus
[52:36] for his children
[52:38] but this is not going to be a a physical
[52:42] Exodus it's going to be a spiritual
[52:46] Exodus it's going to be an exodus of
[52:49] Faith it's going to be an exodus of
[52:52] Revelation it's going to be an exodus of
[52:56] of a new relationship so it's going to
[52:59] be coming out of the law into the spirit
[53:03] of Grace it's going to come out of the
[53:07] leadership of the law to the leadership
[53:10] of the holy spirit so we see here in
[53:14] looking at this how the politics of the
[53:17] world and civilization of the world and
[53:20] everything is actually going down its
[53:24] course in this history is is coming to
[53:27] pass really with a purpose that God has
[53:31] in his mind
[53:33] we know Alexander the Great comes and he
[53:37] takes over the Persian Kingdom the
[53:39] Persian Kingdom gets broke up and then
[53:42] who comes marching along Rome
[53:47] now Rome has
[53:49] control of the world
[53:51] they think
[53:55] who's got control of the kingdoms amen
[53:58] they're his we know that Satan's the
[54:02] ruler of the air and the prince and all
[54:04] those Kingdom but they're all working
[54:06] together to the good of God's elect
[54:12] you're not going to deceive God's elect
[54:14] they're predestinated to come just like
[54:19] those Jews that were in Israel at the
[54:23] time they was under the conquest of Rome
[54:25] everything was the planned so that the
[54:30] angel could appear to marry and Joseph
[54:32] would inspouse her he would take her to
[54:35] Bethlehem they would be born the
[54:38] Shepherds would shout his veins they
[54:40] would go to Egypt everything
[54:43] Herod would slay the children that were
[54:46] spoken in the scripture all this
[54:48] political stuff that's going on
[54:51] isn't stopping God
[54:55] and just like we've got to and that's
[54:57] what we're talking about the path to
[54:59] Restoration
[55:01] we've got to rise up by looking at God's
[55:04] word and saying wait a minute God's Got
[55:07] A Plan he's got a faith I want my faith
[55:11] to be restored in God's word that I can
[55:15] be a part of what God's performing and
[55:19] not let whatever it appears to be going
[55:22] on in the world
[55:24] hinder me
[55:27] banks are crashing
[55:29] what do you do when your bank crashes
[55:33] you go to the scripture that reads I'll
[55:36] not suffer my my holy ones
[55:40] a righteous man shall not beg bread
[55:44] the Lord's supply of all my needs you
[55:49] return back to the word of God
[55:52] because what he says is reality
[55:58] it's not perception
[56:01] yes I I just heard a commentator the
[56:04] other day say as we all know perception
[56:08] is reality
[56:10] I thought you lying Neville
[56:14] no
[56:15] God's word is reality
[56:19] you want to get a better glimpse of
[56:21] reality for our day really what's going
[56:25] on go listen to Satan's Eden go listen
[56:28] to God of this evil age go listen to The
[56:32] Invisible Union of the Bride tree and
[56:36] and the bride of Christ you find out
[56:39] here's Satan building his eating and yet
[56:42] here's God's got all these wonderful
[56:44] promises for this personal Union and and
[56:48] power that he's going to employ and and
[56:52] Pastor the believer that they can do the
[56:56] same works that he's doing and what
[56:58] we've got to understand is that we've
[57:00] got a great restoration coming and we've
[57:03] got to get on that path to Restoration
[57:05] and
[57:07] participate in the things that we need
[57:11] to have within our lives to allow that
[57:14] restoration to come past in us so what
[57:18] we're seeing now as we're talking about
[57:21] the the not only just the restoration of
[57:24] Jerusalem but in ourselves the
[57:27] restoration of building our walls and
[57:30] our gates
[57:31] and not letting our hedge down and
[57:35] that's exactly scriptural because when
[57:38] Satan came to Jesus he said he said have
[57:40] you considered my servant job he says
[57:43] that's because you built the Hedge
[57:45] around them
[57:47] he said no say let me tell you he's
[57:49] genuine you can do whatever you want to
[57:52] him except take his life
[57:55] now here's Joby sitting on a dung Heap
[57:58] he's full of boils his wife's saying why
[58:01] don't you just curse God and die
[58:06] but there's something about Joe
[58:09] he's all through this suffering
[58:13] he's learning more about God
[58:16] he's understanding The Rose the the
[58:19] flower that goes in and comes out and he
[58:22] he says you speak as a foolish woman he
[58:26] says the lord giveth the lord taketh
[58:28] away it blessed be the name of the Lord
[58:31] he's he knows he made the sacrifices for
[58:34] sin his accusers are accusing him of sin
[58:37] but he knows the Integrity of God's word
[58:40] and finally he starts entering the
[58:42] Revelation in all his suffering and
[58:44] finally comes to the place he says
[58:46] though the skin won't eat my flesh yet
[58:48] I'll see God he sees the lightning
[58:50] flashing and he's moved on upon God and
[58:54] then he's restored
[58:56] a hundred fold
[58:58] it's it's a fabulous story of the path
[59:03] of jobs
[59:05] restoration
[59:07] okay it's our hearts that desire so we
[59:12] we pick up where we're at now because
[59:16] uh
[59:18] Nehemiah is heartbroken he's gotten the
[59:21] news
[59:22] that Israel still lays in ruins the
[59:26] walls are all still crumbled down the
[59:29] gates are are burnt the temple has been
[59:33] built but the people are still in
[59:36] disarray he's burdened and he prayed the
[59:39] Lord and we and he said and I pray thee
[59:43] thy servant this day the 11th verse
[59:46] and Grant him Mercy in the sight of this
[59:51] man for I was the king's cup Bearer
[59:55] and it came to pass we'll start reading
[59:57] in the second chapter
[59:59] and it came to pass in the month of
[1:00:02] nasan
[1:00:04] that the 20th year of exers King that
[1:00:10] wine was before him
[1:00:13] and I took up the wine and gave it unto
[1:00:16] the king now I had
[1:00:19] not been Before Time sad in his presence
[1:00:25] wherefore the king said unto me
[1:00:29] why is thy continent sad seeing Thou Art
[1:00:34] not sick
[1:00:36] this is nothing else but sorrow of heart
[1:00:41] then I was very sore
[1:00:45] afraid
[1:00:47] you know you can
[1:00:50] put all these different types you can
[1:00:53] place in there but I I like this that
[1:00:57] the king
[1:00:59] recognized your continents and let me
[1:01:02] tell you the power of your continents
[1:01:07] and you know what that means your
[1:01:08] atmosphere your attitude it could very
[1:01:12] very powerful thing
[1:01:14] in fact the scripture even tells us that
[1:01:17] people may inquire of you what is your
[1:01:21] hope
[1:01:22] that you you you you have such joy and
[1:01:27] confidence and peace amidst all this
[1:01:31] suffering
[1:01:34] you know what is it what is it you've
[1:01:36] got we know the story that was told
[1:01:39] about the Rancher the farmer and the in
[1:01:42] his hand and he the farmer wanted to
[1:01:44] know why he was so happy and why he was
[1:01:46] so blessed and he said it's the Lord
[1:01:50] boss he says do you want him he says yes
[1:01:53] I want to meet him and he'd go out and
[1:01:55] climb over the fence and go kneel down
[1:01:57] the middle of the pigpen
[1:02:00] and the boss will get up there and he'd
[1:02:03] start going through that mind battle and
[1:02:05] him being out there kneeling in the pig
[1:02:08] flop and with his great boots on and
[1:02:11] everything and he just pulled back but
[1:02:14] it just kept burning in his soul
[1:02:17] the peace and the joy that that this
[1:02:22] little farmhand had and the effect it
[1:02:26] was having on him and so much so that
[1:02:29] finally one day he said okay he started
[1:02:32] over the fence he said hold on Boss you
[1:02:36] don't really have to come here you just
[1:02:37] got to want to do it and be able to he
[1:02:40] led him to the Lord
[1:02:42] and he passed the peace
[1:02:45] that he had in his life unto others
[1:02:50] you can live a gospel and preach a
[1:02:53] gospel without saying a word
[1:02:57] you are written Epistles read of all men
[1:03:01] amen and and I'm not a a very good uh I
[1:03:07] don't want to use the term
[1:03:09] you know they call it poker face but
[1:03:11] that's because you're trying to Bluff
[1:03:14] and and con somebody you know usually if
[1:03:18] I get upset it's all over my face you
[1:03:20] know and someone will say well what are
[1:03:22] you upset about nothing
[1:03:25] you know your continents speaks loud
[1:03:30] if you're happy people know you're happy
[1:03:34] you're red well I want people to read me
[1:03:39] if the if the spirit of the Lord's in me
[1:03:41] and I want I want it to
[1:03:44] what my attitude is and what my nature
[1:03:47] is I want that to be a billboard
[1:03:51] you know program called that beautiful
[1:03:53] message
[1:03:55] okay about the billboard being the
[1:03:58] advertisement of our lives that were
[1:04:01] every single one of us is a billboard
[1:04:03] for the Lord that we ought to make those
[1:04:06] around us thirsty for what we have and
[1:04:10] so this King
[1:04:12] he he sees
[1:04:14] him and he says and and he said I was
[1:04:18] sore afraid
[1:04:19] and said unto the king
[1:04:23] let the King live forever
[1:04:28] and in one way he was saying I'm sorry
[1:04:32] I'm let the King live forever I'm sorry
[1:04:35] that my continents upset you
[1:04:40] because he he was afraid because he saw
[1:04:43] that his attitude his nature had an
[1:04:46] effect on one that could take his life
[1:04:50] if he so decided he had the fear of God
[1:04:54] and do you know the fear of God's the
[1:04:57] beginning of wisdom if if you can learn
[1:05:00] and I need to learn it to pray this for
[1:05:02] me that that I need to be mindful of the
[1:05:07] words I speak the attitudes that I have
[1:05:10] the nature that I that I present that I
[1:05:14] need to be in fear of God
[1:05:17] can you understand that that I I don't
[1:05:21] displease him and I think one of the
[1:05:23] greatest things that the Lord says he
[1:05:25] said I only do those things which are
[1:05:27] pleasing to the father Lord help me get
[1:05:30] to that place
[1:05:31] I think it would make a difference of
[1:05:34] the attitude I walked in the atmosphere
[1:05:36] have you ever been around somebody that
[1:05:39] everything's woes me
[1:05:41] oh I can't get no help with this and
[1:05:44] woes me I have to do all this and oh my
[1:05:48] life is so burdened
[1:05:50] you know
[1:05:52] and I I think that gets old
[1:05:57] you know well you wonder what what do
[1:06:00] you have
[1:06:01] you know life is such a trust struggle
[1:06:04] raising kids is so hard well you know
[1:06:08] we we raise four of the most ordinary
[1:06:12] kids known to mankind and some of you
[1:06:15] are laughing but you know it's true
[1:06:18] and uh and uh
[1:06:21] I mean they was always up to something
[1:06:23] it you know we had four kids in five
[1:06:26] years you know what I mean we take care
[1:06:28] of business and move on and uh they were
[1:06:33] I mean my goodness gracious but you know
[1:06:35] Leslie never complained
[1:06:38] never complained about raising them up
[1:06:40] never complained about the stuff they
[1:06:42] went through you know what I mean I
[1:06:45] asked her many times which one do you
[1:06:47] want me to eliminate so that that life
[1:06:50] would be easier for you and all she
[1:06:53] wanted every single one of them there
[1:06:55] you know uh we are paying eight hundred
[1:06:58] dollars a month for car insurance
[1:07:00] because they would wreck every car we
[1:07:02] bought them you know what if something
[1:07:04] but we had a promise
[1:07:06] that if we'd raise them up in the way
[1:07:08] that they'd go that they had returned to
[1:07:11] that way it took a while but God kept
[1:07:14] his word
[1:07:16] and and and don't worry
[1:07:19] do you know if you've kept your part
[1:07:21] we've already heard
[1:07:23] the scriptures say if you kept his
[1:07:26] Commandments and you returned to him
[1:07:28] though they get as far away as the
[1:07:30] heavens could be I will gather them back
[1:07:32] in your kids can't get too far from God
[1:07:36] that God can't touch them
[1:07:39] and so he's sore afraid and he's saying
[1:07:43] uh so let the King live forever I I'm
[1:07:47] sorry for this but he said why should
[1:07:51] not my continents be sad
[1:07:53] when the city
[1:07:57] the place of my father's sepulchers
[1:08:01] lieth
[1:08:03] waste and the gates there are are
[1:08:07] consumed with fire
[1:08:12] now I like this part a lot
[1:08:16] then the king said unto me for what does
[1:08:20] thou make request
[1:08:23] so I prayed
[1:08:26] to the god of Heaven
[1:08:29] look the king Saints is this a request
[1:08:34] or is it a complaint
[1:08:37] you know there's a big difference
[1:08:38] between asking for something if things
[1:08:42] aren't right don't complain about it
[1:08:44] I I just to be honest with you so you
[1:08:47] can know me I I don't like criticism of
[1:08:49] every any form
[1:08:51] nobody likes to be criticized but I
[1:08:54] certainly don't like criticism that
[1:08:56] doesn't have a solution
[1:08:59] that ain't no good
[1:09:01] okay
[1:09:03] what do I do about it
[1:09:07] you know well you might say well this is
[1:09:09] the way I would do it well that's good I
[1:09:12] accept that
[1:09:14] you know we we all know the rule right
[1:09:17] there's two ways to do everything the
[1:09:19] right way the wrong way in my way that
[1:09:22] that's our nature but you don't want
[1:09:24] criticism if someone's not going to help
[1:09:26] you
[1:09:27] I think we call that constructive
[1:09:29] criticism so he the Kings ask him he
[1:09:32] says are you complaining
[1:09:36] what's the request
[1:09:39] what's the request
[1:09:41] so when you find yourself
[1:09:43] in a place of Sorrow you find yourself
[1:09:46] back that you find yourself discouraged
[1:09:49] you find yourself down you find yourself
[1:09:52] in a place that you don't want to be you
[1:09:55] find yourself burdened whatever it is
[1:09:57] maybe a failure you've had has put you
[1:10:00] in a place of Burden you feel backslid
[1:10:03] you feel beat down you feel away from
[1:10:06] God the question isn't well what is
[1:10:11] what's your request
[1:10:16] what can I help you with what can I do
[1:10:18] about it this is such a relationship of
[1:10:21] if of the King Typing Our Father in
[1:10:24] heaven and his son having a burden and a
[1:10:28] need whether it's for himself to be
[1:10:30] right
[1:10:32] because now Nehemiah wants to get back
[1:10:35] to where he can start worshiping God
[1:10:38] keeping his Commandments he's wanting to
[1:10:41] be restored back to the to the life that
[1:10:44] he was brought up in
[1:10:47] and he wants it for his Brethren he
[1:10:50] wants Israel to return back to the
[1:10:53] father
[1:10:55] and he wanted to do something that he
[1:10:57] can do to help bring it to pass and he
[1:11:01] knows if Jerusalem can rise up he knows
[1:11:04] that the children can gather around
[1:11:06] there and that they can start worshiping
[1:11:09] God and start keeping the feast and
[1:11:12] start doing the Commandments that Moses
[1:11:14] given
[1:11:16] so he's his desire is for a Revival to
[1:11:21] break out if I could say it that way
[1:11:25] but he's got to make his request known
[1:11:29] so the king's asking him
[1:11:31] you know you could read it kind of the
[1:11:33] way I do I read it like is that a
[1:11:35] request
[1:11:38] or what's the request
[1:11:42] what are you saying
[1:11:44] well I'm saying the place is wrecked
[1:11:49] maybe oh I wrecked my car
[1:11:53] is that a request
[1:11:56] do you need Carr any prayer do you need
[1:11:59] a ride
[1:12:01] part of restoration
[1:12:04] is making your requests known
[1:12:08] we have not because we asked not because
[1:12:12] we don't believe that God
[1:12:16] could answer
[1:12:19] the prayer
[1:12:26] so
[1:12:28] yeah I think it's a great question the
[1:12:30] king says what what what request is thou
[1:12:35] what does thou make request so I can
[1:12:38] pray to the god of Heaven
[1:12:41] and I said unto the king
[1:12:44] if it pleased the king
[1:12:46] and If thy servant have found favor in
[1:12:50] thy sight
[1:12:52] that thou May Ascend me unto Judea and
[1:12:57] unto the city of my father's Sepulcher
[1:12:59] that I might build it
[1:13:03] I love it I might restore it that I
[1:13:08] might do something for the kingdom of
[1:13:11] God and the King said unto me the queen
[1:13:15] also setting by him
[1:13:18] for how long shall that journey be and
[1:13:21] when will thou return so it pleased the
[1:13:25] king to send me and I set him a time
[1:13:34] he gave the king his word
[1:13:39] your word is gold
[1:13:42] if you don't promise something that you
[1:13:46] can't keep at least say Lord willing
[1:13:50] but if foolish man says I'll do this and
[1:13:53] I'll do that and I'll do this and I'll
[1:13:55] do that Lord willing if everything goes
[1:13:58] well
[1:13:59] you know what I mean this is our plan by
[1:14:02] the grace of God but Lord willing always
[1:14:05] acknowledge who's in charge and who's in
[1:14:09] control and and and and and what it
[1:14:13] means and so he gave his King his word
[1:14:17] he says I set a time a time for his
[1:14:21] departure a time for his return what
[1:14:24] that he was going to do what he purposed
[1:14:27] it and and I think the beautiful part of
[1:14:30] this that we have to understand he
[1:14:32] established his motive and objective
[1:14:38] a lot of people ask things and want
[1:14:41] things done and they've got something up
[1:14:43] their sleeve
[1:14:45] you know he didn't have anything up his
[1:14:48] sleeve he was laying it out to the King
[1:14:50] this is what I want to go for this is
[1:14:53] what I want to do this is the burden of
[1:14:56] my heart I'm not hiding anything from
[1:14:58] you there's nothing up my sleeve okay
[1:15:01] this is the plan that I'm going to carry
[1:15:03] out I'm committed to it I'm not hiding
[1:15:06] I'm full disclosure I'm full in view
[1:15:10] I've got no secrets
[1:15:14] I'm open this is my View
[1:15:18] it's so important
[1:15:20] that not only that you know where you
[1:15:24] stand but others know where you stand
[1:15:27] that the first way to gain respect so
[1:15:31] many people here they're so wishy-washy
[1:15:34] in and out up and down you don't know
[1:15:37] what to believe
[1:15:38] when they tell you because they don't
[1:15:40] have a life that matches up so this is a
[1:15:44] man that God's place there he's prepared
[1:15:47] himself God prepared him he prepared
[1:15:50] himself now he's in the place to go into
[1:15:54] action and in order to go into action
[1:15:57] he's got to make his requests made known
[1:15:59] to the Lord
[1:16:02] what it is that he wants
[1:16:07] you all know the scriptures about what
[1:16:10] the Lord teaches ask the father anything
[1:16:12] of my name he'll give it always
[1:16:15] encouraging us to ask ask for the things
[1:16:19] that will help you on your journey to
[1:16:22] the kingdom
[1:16:23] don't be embarrassed if you need it
[1:16:27] he already knows you need it
[1:16:29] he wants to enter into the fellowship of
[1:16:32] supplying your needs because he's
[1:16:35] Jehovah jirei he's Jehovah Rapha he's a
[1:16:38] a Lord that supplyth our needs he's our
[1:16:41] healer all the Redemptive names of
[1:16:44] Jehovah are all summed up in the Lord
[1:16:46] Jesus Christ and so he's watching
[1:16:49] Nehemiah go through all the right steps
[1:16:52] of restoration
[1:16:54] honesty making his requests
[1:16:58] everything about him becomes beautiful
[1:17:01] and he just as he moves on here and
[1:17:04] moreover I said unto the king if it
[1:17:07] pleased the king let letters be given me
[1:17:11] to to the governors beyond the river
[1:17:15] that they might can convey me over till
[1:17:20] I come unto Judea
[1:17:23] he's got to pass through all the lands
[1:17:25] God across the river Euphrates the
[1:17:27] Tigris Rivers the universe rephraties go
[1:17:31] all the way over across Jordan
[1:17:33] you could look at the map
[1:17:36] so his his journey
[1:17:39] is about
[1:17:41] 670 miles
[1:17:44] that would kind of be as the we'd say
[1:17:47] the crows fly
[1:17:49] but
[1:17:50] it took Nehemiah
[1:17:54] 14 years earlier it it took him 900
[1:17:59] miles of Road
[1:18:02] and four months
[1:18:04] of travel
[1:18:07] to get to
[1:18:10] Jerusalem to build the temple
[1:18:14] that is commitment
[1:18:17] for the full Journey
[1:18:19] and God will sometimes
[1:18:22] test us
[1:18:23] he'll put time
[1:18:25] in between the request
[1:18:28] how long did Abraham
[1:18:30] how about Noah
[1:18:32] how about the things that people
[1:18:35] required and were asking for and God
[1:18:39] puts if I could say this word maybe an
[1:18:42] endurance course
[1:18:46] right because
[1:18:48] faith and love they endureth all things
[1:18:52] they don't give up on their Pursuit
[1:18:55] okay and and don't give up on the
[1:18:58] pursuit of Excellence
[1:19:00] that's what makes it excellent failure
[1:19:04] is what produces an excellent product
[1:19:08] if if there's not failure sometimes if
[1:19:11] there's not a a stress test and a test
[1:19:16] to prove something and if it's never
[1:19:19] been proven you can't have confidence in
[1:19:22] it
[1:19:23] but if you watch somebody go through
[1:19:25] struggles after struggle and they still
[1:19:27] stay firm and they still praise God they
[1:19:30] rise up they keep going they're their
[1:19:32] goal you don't mind that they've got
[1:19:34] problems you don't mind that they're
[1:19:37] fighting the good fight you don't mind
[1:19:39] their failures because you know they're
[1:19:41] not going to quit they're persistent
[1:19:45] and and this man knew what set out
[1:19:50] before him
[1:19:51] that he was persistent because he's
[1:19:54] trying to put everything that he could
[1:19:57] do to make it come to pass and so he
[1:20:00] asked the king for these letters and and
[1:20:03] so he sent these letters and and the
[1:20:06] letters unto
[1:20:08] ask for The Keeper of the king's Forest
[1:20:12] that he might give me timbers to make
[1:20:16] beams for the gates of the palace where
[1:20:22] which
[1:20:23] apprehendeth to the house and for the
[1:20:27] walls of the city and for the house that
[1:20:30] I shall enter into and the King granted
[1:20:34] me according to the good hand of my God
[1:20:38] upon me
[1:20:41] don't forget to give credit
[1:20:43] to those that God uses to help you
[1:20:48] if you have a boss that employs you pray
[1:20:51] for him
[1:20:52] give them credit don't run them to the
[1:20:55] ground you know okay don't you know if
[1:20:59] God gives you a job and you hate it
[1:21:02] you know what I mean it kind of tells me
[1:21:05] maybe you don't understand how God works
[1:21:10] you know you just don't sit back man I
[1:21:12] hate what I'm doing I hate what I'm
[1:21:13] doing well did you pray about it before
[1:21:16] you started it
[1:21:19] you know like if you didn't pray about
[1:21:22] before you started and God didn't give
[1:21:25] it to you and you just jumped in it
[1:21:28] because you were driven by desperation
[1:21:32] if you didn't know what Nehemiah did
[1:21:34] Nehemiah was going to go do something
[1:21:36] and the scripture tells us before you
[1:21:39] build something count the cost
[1:21:41] so he counted the cost he looked at what
[1:21:44] he needed he requested I'm going to need
[1:21:46] men I'm going to need Timbers I'm going
[1:21:49] to need these things and then he was
[1:21:52] relying on the goodness of God to
[1:21:55] provide for him
[1:21:58] you know we just saw this just recently
[1:22:00] in our building program so we we get a
[1:22:03] bit covet comes and we get a bid for
[1:22:06] trusses for our church
[1:22:09] trusses are the little roof pieces that
[1:22:11] goes on they wanted a hundred and ninety
[1:22:14] thousand dollars
[1:22:19] you don't think that was
[1:22:22] ain't no way
[1:22:26] of course if you say well what are we
[1:22:28] going to do
[1:22:30] we have to save the money someplace else
[1:22:33] or do something
[1:22:35] because we have a goal that we're trying
[1:22:37] to meet
[1:22:38] and you know and then you know
[1:22:41] everybody's fighting us and it's
[1:22:42] terrible and we just think the world's
[1:22:44] coming to an end and all that stuff and
[1:22:47] I want to hang everybody in the city and
[1:22:49] there can't be enough lightning fall
[1:22:51] down you know what I mean and and uh
[1:22:54] being you know I'm writing dirty letters
[1:22:56] to the city council you know I'm all
[1:22:58] stirred up
[1:23:03] what did I forget
[1:23:05] I forgot about the goodness of God
[1:23:09] right the scripture says if God begins a
[1:23:12] work
[1:23:14] he'll finish it
[1:23:17] that goes for me
[1:23:18] that goes for anything he's in
[1:23:22] and if he's in you and he started a work
[1:23:25] in you he'll finish the work in you
[1:23:29] so we went back out and we said okay I
[1:23:32] called the first company up that talked
[1:23:34] to man I said we're ready for those
[1:23:36] trusses now we want to put them in
[1:23:39] production can you here's the new print
[1:23:42] of what we're going to do and took the
[1:23:45] balcony out and here it is
[1:23:48] he writes me back he says that'll be
[1:23:50] forty thousand dollars
[1:23:54] that's a hundred and fifty thousand
[1:23:57] dollar different
[1:24:01] you don't think somebody's got timing
[1:24:05] I'm so glad that God didn't let me build
[1:24:08] this building
[1:24:11] but if he builds it
[1:24:13] it'll be according to his will according
[1:24:16] to his time according to his place
[1:24:20] but again don't forget to give glory to
[1:24:23] all those that help you and enable you
[1:24:27] and bless you
[1:24:30] they said George Washington wouldn't
[1:24:32] take a drink of water without thanking
[1:24:34] the lord
[1:24:36] he he appreciated it so much I thank the
[1:24:39] Lord
[1:24:43] he said
[1:24:45] so he said then I came to the governors
[1:24:48] beyond the river
[1:24:50] and gave them the king's letters
[1:24:52] now the king had sent captains of the
[1:24:56] army and Horsemen with me
[1:24:59] I don't know the king's motive and
[1:25:01] objective of that but I think one thing
[1:25:04] the king wanted to do is he wanted to
[1:25:06] make sure
[1:25:08] he got there
[1:25:11] and carried out what his heart's desire
[1:25:14] do you ever think that just might be
[1:25:16] just like God in Camp in this
[1:25:19] angels
[1:25:20] around the righteous
[1:25:23] because the angels of the Lord are
[1:25:26] camped about them that fear Him
[1:25:28] and here you see it
[1:25:31] a man that feared God feared the king
[1:25:35] and he's been encamped about
[1:25:40] I I that just moves me I'm sorry I I get
[1:25:43] moved by some of the smallest things
[1:25:46] but it's just the little things that God
[1:25:49] does that just amaze me
[1:25:52] you know he just didn't send this guy
[1:25:54] with a letter
[1:25:55] but those guards went with him and you
[1:25:58] know why they went with him
[1:26:00] because they went to enforce the king's
[1:26:04] letter
[1:26:05] they weren't there necessarily
[1:26:09] for
[1:26:10] Nehemiah
[1:26:11] but Nehemiah was packing a letter from
[1:26:14] the King
[1:26:16] and to them men
[1:26:18] that was the law
[1:26:21] and if you didn't obey that letter they
[1:26:23] would Lop your head off
[1:26:27] they in their heart in their lives in
[1:26:31] their dedication and what they've chosen
[1:26:33] they were chosen to uphold the will of
[1:26:37] the king
[1:26:39] and that's what they were along for they
[1:26:42] were alone when he handed that letter to
[1:26:46] the king's ruler of the forest those
[1:26:49] captains is there when he gave them that
[1:26:52] letter them captains and them guys stood
[1:26:54] there and went
[1:26:56] chart chopping
[1:27:00] they were there to enforce
[1:27:02] the king's will
[1:27:05] aren't you glad you've got angels
[1:27:08] that are going to enforce the will of
[1:27:10] the Lord that are encamped about you
[1:27:13] that carry those if you're about his
[1:27:16] business
[1:27:18] our Prophet taught us that he will make
[1:27:20] a way
[1:27:23] oh I love it I just Thrills me I don't
[1:27:26] can't help myself I'm just a child when
[1:27:29] it comes to Bible stories but there they
[1:27:32] were they're gonna they were making sure
[1:27:34] that that King's letter that King's
[1:27:36] letter was was gold to them
[1:27:40] it was the will of their King
[1:27:43] we know some other guys that heard the
[1:27:45] will of the king one day don't we
[1:27:47] he said oh just to have a cup of water
[1:27:51] from that Brook
[1:27:53] oh those guys heard that
[1:27:55] all of a sudden you heard four or five
[1:27:57] horses Gallop off
[1:27:59] where was that Brooke it was on the
[1:28:01] other side of the enemy
[1:28:03] they slashed and cut their way through
[1:28:06] got to that well fending people off
[1:28:09] laying down they got that drink for
[1:28:12] their King off they went back across
[1:28:16] they brought it to David
[1:28:19] oh they said here King we overheard you
[1:28:24] say you wanted a glass of water
[1:28:27] David was moved
[1:28:29] by their allegiance he has moved by
[1:28:33] their Authority in fact he was so moved
[1:28:36] he didn't even feel worthy to drink that
[1:28:39] water because these men went through
[1:28:41] such an effort just to meet his request
[1:28:46] wouldn't it be wonderful if we had that
[1:28:48] kind of loved one for another that if we
[1:28:50] heard someone's burden or somebody's
[1:28:52] need that we would fight everything that
[1:28:55] we could to bring it to pass in their
[1:28:57] life David poured it out and the Lord
[1:28:59] and said Lord I'm not worthy
[1:29:01] to drink this water these men are
[1:29:04] greater
[1:29:06] than my feet then my thirst
[1:29:09] he saw every man better than themselves
[1:29:18] that's what that little verse means to
[1:29:20] me
[1:29:21] maybe I got more out of it than I should
[1:29:23] have
[1:29:24] but
[1:29:25] I think there's more in there I missed
[1:29:29] Hallelujah
[1:29:32] and when santaball
[1:29:35] sent a ball out I guess you guys make
[1:29:38] these names up for yourself
[1:29:40] okay because I I don't ever read them
[1:29:44] twice the same way I go to try to figure
[1:29:47] them out and they got little dots and
[1:29:49] little U's and little marks over there
[1:29:51] and I think am I supposed to know what
[1:29:53] that squiggly thing means
[1:29:56] I don't know how nobody taught me what
[1:29:58] they meant you know so it just looks
[1:30:01] like what it is you know San
[1:30:04] Baal lat
[1:30:07] and ho row night
[1:30:11] and
[1:30:12] to buy ha
[1:30:18] anybody else want to take a shot at it
[1:30:20] I'm I'm game
[1:30:25] this the servant
[1:30:27] and
[1:30:29] ammonite heard of it it grieved them
[1:30:33] exceedingly that there was come a man to
[1:30:37] seek the welfare of the children of
[1:30:40] Israel isn't that a type of the hateful
[1:30:44] society that we live in today then if
[1:30:47] you seek the welfare of something oh you
[1:30:50] they got so many names for you that it's
[1:30:54] it's unbelievable
[1:30:55] and he said so I came to Jerusalem and
[1:30:59] was there three days
[1:31:01] and I arose in the night
[1:31:07] and I
[1:31:09] and a few men with me
[1:31:12] neither told I any man what God
[1:31:16] had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem
[1:31:21] neither was there any Beast with me
[1:31:25] save the Beast that I rode upon
[1:31:29] and I went out by night
[1:31:32] by the gate of the valley
[1:31:35] and before the dragon went
[1:31:38] and to the dunport
[1:31:41] and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which
[1:31:44] were broken down
[1:31:46] and the gates thereof which were
[1:31:49] consumed with fire
[1:31:51] then I went to the gate of the
[1:31:54] foundation the fountain
[1:31:56] and to the king's pool
[1:31:59] but but there was no place for a beast
[1:32:04] that was under me to pass
[1:32:07] then I went up in the Night by the Brook
[1:32:12] and viewed the wall and turned back and
[1:32:16] entered by the gate of the valley so I
[1:32:20] returned
[1:32:21] this is a man that wasn't boasting
[1:32:24] or seeking glory for himself
[1:32:30] he looked at the task
[1:32:33] and no doubt
[1:32:37] he might have not realized
[1:32:40] how big of a task it was
[1:32:43] or how bad the situation was
[1:32:47] but what did he have
[1:32:50] he prayed
[1:32:51] the king granted his journey
[1:32:54] he asked the king and the King gave him
[1:32:57] letters
[1:32:59] God didn't take him this far to fail
[1:33:03] and there was no boast in his life there
[1:33:07] was no look at me I'm here to do this
[1:33:09] I'm going to accomplish this great thing
[1:33:12] you know I'm a master builder he wasn't
[1:33:15] a master builder he was a cup Bearer
[1:33:19] he wasn't counting on him he was
[1:33:21] counting on God he didn't want to get
[1:33:24] the glory he wanted God to get the glory
[1:33:28] he he somehow must have felt in his
[1:33:32] spirit that he was part of a bigger
[1:33:35] accomplishment
[1:33:37] God wasn't built in Jerusalem up God was
[1:33:40] building Jerusalem up so his real son
[1:33:44] could go to read Jerusalem so he could
[1:33:47] be rejected he could be judged he could
[1:33:51] be found a sinner that he could go to
[1:33:55] the cross
[1:33:56] Jeremiah Nehemiah might not have
[1:33:58] understood all those things but he was
[1:34:02] compelled to do what he did and he did
[1:34:05] what he was compelled to do he didn't
[1:34:08] have to have an understanding of it he
[1:34:11] just believed that the part that God was
[1:34:14] playing in him
[1:34:16] and I'm afraid today too many of us have
[1:34:18] to know what tomorrow holds we have to
[1:34:21] know what the future holds we have to
[1:34:23] know how it's going to affect our stock
[1:34:25] market how it's going to affect our
[1:34:27] retirement we got so many things in the
[1:34:30] picture
[1:34:32] he didn't
[1:34:36] that burden still rang true
[1:34:38] he didn't tell nobody he didn't boast
[1:34:42] he didn't take no glory
[1:34:45] because it was the spirit of God
[1:34:49] moving in him
[1:34:51] God was going to use Nehemiah to build
[1:34:55] walls that were broke down
[1:34:59] all he was going to do was bring the
[1:35:03] word to them
[1:35:06] he surveyed it
[1:35:10] may I say this young people
[1:35:13] I know that marriage lies ahead of you I
[1:35:17] know job decisions lie ahead of you
[1:35:20] relationships lie ahead of you meetings
[1:35:24] that you go lie ahead of you survey the
[1:35:27] ground
[1:35:28] look at the country look what's there
[1:35:31] look what's ahead preview it
[1:35:37] don't walk blindly into things
[1:35:42] I I I just remember brother REM talked
[1:35:46] to that girl
[1:35:47] that can I I forget
[1:35:49] what she told them it's something about
[1:35:52] his hair well he's got wavy hair and
[1:35:54] brother man looked at says what's that
[1:35:56] got to do with it
[1:35:58] wavy hair
[1:36:00] how do you like my wavy hair
[1:36:03] you know what I mean wavy hair don't
[1:36:05] stay there
[1:36:10] he said what has that got to do with it
[1:36:12] look at the things that matter
[1:36:15] you understand he wasn't distracted
[1:36:18] he didn't all of a sudden decide what
[1:36:20] rather build Temple
[1:36:22] I'd rather build houses I'd rather do
[1:36:25] this he's stuck with his conviction
[1:36:30] stick with your convictions
[1:36:32] survey the ground ahead of you
[1:36:34] understand what lies ahead of you
[1:36:37] understand the job that you're
[1:36:39] commissioned to do and the things to do
[1:36:41] okay and if you wonder take something
[1:36:44] make sure it falls in a line with the
[1:36:47] will of God in your life and the work
[1:36:49] that God has for you to do
[1:36:52] it didn't matter I love the fact that he
[1:36:55] kept this secret I love the fact he went
[1:36:58] out at night and he saw it you know why
[1:37:01] he wasn't going to ask the people to do
[1:37:04] something that he hadn't experienced
[1:37:06] himself
[1:37:10] how many times have I heard people come
[1:37:12] to me and say oh I know exactly how it
[1:37:15] feels
[1:37:17] you're not old enough
[1:37:20] to know what it feels like
[1:37:23] to be in this body
[1:37:26] you haven't had the number of hurts
[1:37:29] you haven't done that I can't walk up to
[1:37:32] somebody
[1:37:33] who's Lost the Child
[1:37:35] and say I know how it feels
[1:37:39] because I don't
[1:37:41] I can sympathize I can be compassionate
[1:37:45] I can tell the Lord knows how it feels
[1:37:47] the father lost his son I could comfort
[1:37:50] him with the gospel you will see them
[1:37:53] again
[1:37:54] I've had to have several families had
[1:37:57] lost young children lost him at Birth
[1:37:59] lost them right after birth
[1:38:01] it's a hard time to get through
[1:38:05] but he gets us through them
[1:38:07] come back the task
[1:38:10] did not deter him it just made God
[1:38:14] greater
[1:38:15] and he stayed humble he knew what he was
[1:38:19] going to ask he knew what he was talking
[1:38:21] about he prayed and he had a plan
[1:38:25] and the Lord had given him the course to
[1:38:29] follow and so we find out that he
[1:38:31] entered uh
[1:38:34] back in the valley gated return
[1:38:39] and the rulers knew not wither I went
[1:38:42] nor what I did
[1:38:44] neither had I as yet told it to the Jews
[1:38:50] nor to the priest nor to the Nobles nor
[1:38:55] to the rulers or nor to the rest of that
[1:38:59] did the work
[1:39:02] yeah I didn't even talk to him till I
[1:39:04] knew myself
[1:39:06] and then I said unto them you see the
[1:39:09] distress that we are in
[1:39:12] how Jerusalem lieth
[1:39:15] waste
[1:39:16] and the gates thereof are burnt with
[1:39:19] fire
[1:39:20] come
[1:39:21] let us build up the walls of Jerusalem
[1:39:26] that there be no more reproach
[1:39:30] come let us
[1:39:34] not I'm here to do this and I'm here to
[1:39:39] do that he didn't even tell him till he
[1:39:42] knew what he was saying he knew that God
[1:39:45] was capable and then he when he says
[1:39:47] look at where we're standing look at the
[1:39:50] reproach look at what they're doing look
[1:39:53] at this let's build this together let's
[1:39:57] stand up together to let us
[1:40:01] build up the wall of Jerusalem if one
[1:40:05] can put an army to flight
[1:40:08] two can put ten thousand
[1:40:11] us can do more than I
[1:40:14] us is a much better
[1:40:17] friend than me
[1:40:19] I would rather have we than me
[1:40:23] can humbly approached him he knew his
[1:40:26] position he knew he was a cup Bearer
[1:40:29] they could have scoffed at him
[1:40:31] say what do you know about building
[1:40:36] the only thing you've done is lived in a
[1:40:38] palace and and and and held a cup
[1:40:44] you know unbelievers will find some
[1:40:48] reason you can't do what you can do
[1:40:49] they'll find some reason you can't have
[1:40:52] a miracle they'll find some reason why
[1:40:54] the task is too big they'll find some
[1:40:58] reason they are Soulful in negativity
[1:41:00] that the scripture tells us and our
[1:41:02] Prophet tells him he says don't surround
[1:41:04] yourself with unbelievers
[1:41:08] he went to him he finally went to him
[1:41:11] and said let us build this wall together
[1:41:16] I like this
[1:41:17] a whole lot
[1:41:23] and there was a purpose for it
[1:41:25] that we be no more a reproach
[1:41:29] then
[1:41:33] there's a perfect time for everything
[1:41:37] because it shows motive and objective
[1:41:40] can let's rewrite the story I come
[1:41:43] riding in town
[1:41:45] I'm going to build a wall
[1:41:47] I got a letter from the King
[1:41:51] slave
[1:41:54] they'll probably take that off YouTube
[1:41:57] but you got it first I didn't right
[1:42:03] it's crazy
[1:42:06] but look at his approach
[1:42:09] look at his attitude
[1:42:11] he can't do it without them
[1:42:14] he's sharing his burden with him he's
[1:42:17] wanting what he's sharing with them is
[1:42:19] for them
[1:42:21] to take the reproach off to give you a
[1:42:25] place you're living amongst this Rubble
[1:42:27] let's build this wall that you don't
[1:42:29] live in this reproach that you don't
[1:42:31] live in this crummy condition because
[1:42:34] that you can be raised up
[1:42:37] let's do this together and he never he
[1:42:41] never said me and then he brings it to
[1:42:43] him he says he says like this and then I
[1:42:48] told him of the hand of my God
[1:42:52] where's all the glory going it's all
[1:42:55] going to God he said I told them of the
[1:42:59] hand of my God which was good unto me as
[1:43:04] also the king's words that he had spoken
[1:43:08] unto me and they said let us rise up and
[1:43:13] build Hallelujah
[1:43:16] that's a result
[1:43:19] did you hear the quote what Matthew read
[1:43:21] this morning and when he talked about
[1:43:23] the one lays in the flesh he wasn't
[1:43:25] taught right she said the other lady
[1:43:27] came up
[1:43:28] she was quiet she sat there and she
[1:43:32] walked up in the line she was there for
[1:43:34] that child
[1:43:36] who had legs that wouldn't move and all
[1:43:39] of a sudden the child goes
[1:43:42] look Mommy
[1:43:44] and she looks at brother remember she
[1:43:46] says brother random I knew it would
[1:43:48] happen
[1:43:49] I knew what would happen
[1:43:52] what did that humble approach
[1:43:55] do
[1:43:58] her husband
[1:44:00] who was a sinner
[1:44:02] came burning out of the audience and
[1:44:06] wanted that God
[1:44:09] because he'd seen other gods he'd seen
[1:44:12] other religions he said but when he saw
[1:44:14] something genuine and he saw it was the
[1:44:17] love of God that did it
[1:44:19] he wanted some of that
[1:44:22] and when they saw the humility of
[1:44:25] Nehemiah they saw the burden of his
[1:44:28] heart they they saw the respect that he
[1:44:31] had for God and how that God had moved
[1:44:35] and brought him thus far and got a cup
[1:44:37] Bearer to pack a letter of the king with
[1:44:40] soldiers something that's totally
[1:44:42] unperceivable
[1:44:47] but when they saw it and they saw his
[1:44:51] attitude and approach they wanted to be
[1:44:53] a part of it
[1:44:55] you know maybe more people would want to
[1:44:57] be a part of what we have
[1:44:59] if we took The Humble side
[1:45:04] and then
[1:45:09] we're here
[1:45:11] and he said
[1:45:13] and they said
[1:45:20] and I
[1:45:31] he
[1:45:32] okay I was where was I
[1:45:35] verse 18. okay okay and they and and
[1:45:40] then I told them the hand of God and and
[1:45:45] what the king had done and they said let
[1:45:47] us rise up and build so they strengthen
[1:45:50] their hands for this good work
[1:45:55] they prepared themselves
[1:45:57] again this great path to Restoration
[1:46:02] but when what's his name and what's his
[1:46:05] name and what's his name
[1:46:07] the servant
[1:46:09] and the ammonite and gertram and Arab
[1:46:14] and heard of it they laughed us to scorn
[1:46:18] and despised us and said what is this
[1:46:24] thing that ye do
[1:46:26] ye will ye rebel against the king
[1:46:33] they wouldn't lend their hand to nothing
[1:46:37] and here's a bunch of little children of
[1:46:41] God
[1:46:41] that are going to build the city walls
[1:46:44] they're not Builders they're nothing
[1:46:48] but they've got one thing if God be for
[1:46:51] you who can be against you
[1:46:53] what is going to stop the will of God
[1:46:57] from coming to pass in your life only
[1:47:00] believe all things are possible
[1:47:05] they looked at that and they looked at
[1:47:08] that little group and they said you
[1:47:09] gonna Build That Wall
[1:47:12] ah
[1:47:14] reminds me of another Bible story huh
[1:47:17] you gonna kill me with that rock
[1:47:21] when did you send this little puny thing
[1:47:24] out here to fight me am I a dog
[1:47:28] that you would mock me
[1:47:30] I'm going to take you and stick you up
[1:47:33] on that bush
[1:47:36] and he said well
[1:47:38] I'm gonna chop your head off
[1:47:45] one had God
[1:47:48] always wins
[1:47:50] if God before you
[1:47:53] who can be
[1:47:55] against you
[1:47:58] and they mocked him
[1:48:00] then I answered I them and said unto
[1:48:03] them the god of Heaven
[1:48:06] he will prosper us therefore we his
[1:48:10] servants will rise and build but you
[1:48:14] have no portion nor right nor Memorial
[1:48:18] in
[1:48:21] Jerusalem
[1:48:23] I love that
[1:48:25] amen that's chapter two
[1:48:29] just a little bit we could glean out of
[1:48:31] it
[1:48:32] amen it encourages me
[1:48:36] that God Can Build me
[1:48:38] into a statue of a perfect man
[1:48:41] he can bring me
[1:48:43] into a visible Union with him and that
[1:48:47] as he is so can I be in this world not
[1:48:52] by my might
[1:48:53] not by my strength but by his spirit
