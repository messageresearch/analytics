Description:
The Path Forward Is Bread
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Sunday Morning Service 
March 16th, 2025
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

we help you and I know that uh we're all here for the glory of the Lord so let's read our scripture and then we're going to read a lot of scripture and and we're going to try to just bring something that's on our heart this morning and it says in and you know the story this is the uh uh as the four verse starts then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterward and hung hungry and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread and Jesus answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God God bless you may be seated this morning uh if I was to title my sermon this morning I would call it the path forward is bread and uh we're going to be uh sharing some thoughts with you this morning out of the message Harvest time and what brought me to this is I was thinking on the tape I sat Saturday morning and I listened to uh the sermon recognizing its day and its message and and I I I plac that in my heart because there's so many voices and so much political disturbance and uh people are uh moving out of our country because they can't stand the current president and and they're starting to find out all kinds of things that are government's been doing and they're all in a total uproar um and uh so I I told lesie this morning I said I I I'm I I I just read an article that if you drink water out of a plastic bottle it's uh it's going to hurt you so I said no more no more micro Plastics and and uh all all these things that make America healthy again and uh uh you know all this is killing you all this is killing you so they've come to the realization that everything's killing them if they would listened to a prophet 5050 years ago they would have already known these things and I thought one of the things that was brought out that was so tremendous and and I want to shed light on this if I could in a way that uh um you can understand why that they're in the condition that they're in you understand I me one side just can't believe it but they discovered that our government had spent $20 million of studying if men could have babies now on the surface that might appear to you to be a shock men in women's sports and trans gender and uh uh gender affirming and all these things about gender and all these things about uh men and women and E and this coming together and and I was visiting with some of the brothers and it struck me you know that Satan is a perverter we know that and what what his goal was is to exalt himself above the sons of God and to be worshiped as God now if I could give uh a little bit of logic or make a little sense of their thinking kind of if I could say this in their defense of why that they're pursuing so something that seemed so incredibly odd to us that about uh men becoming women and women becoming men and them wanting to do away with the the pronouns and and identifying everything that the way that they want to identify things but if you would go back to to the beginning and you would begin to understand when God made man man was both male and female you understand that he was both male and female now if you take God out of the picture and that's what man had done they they believe that man evolved whether it was something bumping into somebody in space or but eventually they said that man evolved up from uh a primate uh some might say a a monkey or an ape or chimpan or and and they've done studies how smart they are and and and all all these things you know and uh uh and so they they have this they have this uh this idea in them that man evolved because they've eliminated God from their thinking now I know that's hard for you to do but they don't believe in a god therefore they don't believe in an end they don't believe in a judgment they don't believe they have to answer to anything alls that they do is they believe that they're evolving and and and so all of this thinking that's going on is they believe that man is going to evolve back in have you ever seen pictures of what they show what a man a thousand years from now is you know he's got a great big head because he's full I think they're kind of bigheaded already but you know they got a great big head you know what I mean and and they're all creatur listic and everything they believe that man's evolving that way he he's he's going to evolve into a being where he's back to being male and female where he's back to being able to reproduce within himself and so this is the kind of thinking that man's given over to and he has a reprobate mind because they've taken God out of the picture and they've taken the word of God out of the picture so this is why they're studying all these things they believe that man's going to go to Mars they believe that man's going to evolve man's going to become smarter he's going to interact with artificial intelligence and and he's going to become something that is both male and female well it's just they can't come up with anything new Under the Sun God made them male and female they were together and God separated them so you just begin to see and you begin to recognize that this is all of sign of our time and that was a great failure that man has always came into if you would uh follow with me this morning is there inability to recognize the hour and the time that they're in and the message that God has for them so each of you this morning I I'm here with you we've got not only to recognize what's going on in in the world around us but we need to recognize what's going on in the spirit and in the life and and what what's going on within our own s uh and and and we we need to make a a a great connection with what that we live by you know what it is that we're living by and if if it's ever an hour uh that we realize the events of what has transpired and as Christians we know that the Lord taught us that his gospel would go into the ground we understand that unless a seed you know dieth and goeth into the ground it cannot bring forth life so he knew that the seed of his word what that he was preaching in was going to go into the ground he knew the enemy would come up and stand against us how many believes God knows all things so he knew that what he was preaching that the enemy wouldn't leave it alone he knew there would be four horse riders that would come out and would battle against it he knew that he that Satan would try to make the word of none effect so he knew that that word and that truth of the Gospel that he preached would one day be buried in the ground in in a Roman Catholic educational scientific uh uh civilization it would get buried but he knew it would rise again and we understand that because we want to recognize the day and its message and we saw that that what what Christianity was in the beginning you cannot look at what the disciples were and what the Life of Christ was and go to Rome and look at the Catholic church and say that they have any comparison whatsoever religious oh very religious spiritual oh very very uh reverent and holy and atmosphere of and esteem uh uh fabulous buildings and everything but that was so far away from one that didn't have a place to lay his head you you know what I mean that preached on the hillsides and and and and and and did signs and wonders and and did work so the the the you can't even relate them hardly one to another because we knew this seed would have to go into the ground and then we realized that that as that seed came up it sprung up one day a a priest got to reading Romans and he realized that there was one sacrifice for sin and that was the blood of the lamb and that Jesus Christ cleansed us from all sin and unrighteousness that there was Power in the Blood there was power in forgiveness and that man was not justified by his Works he was justified only and solely by the blood of Jesus Christ and there was only one place that God would meet a man and that's under that shed blood so don't ever bring to God all that you've done and all that you think you are and and oh I've done this and I've done that you know when those two men were praying in the temple it was the guy in the back that said Maya Koopa have mercy on me have mercy on me I'm a sinner that's the one that God heard the one that knew he needed a sacrifice the one that he knew he needed a savior the one that knew he didn't have any righteousness and that our righteousness is his filthy rags but it's the righteousness of the father and that God did that for us and he saw that and he said no it's not it's not the literal body of Jesus it's not the blood it's not confessing sins it's not paying offerings it's not giving the priest your money it's not kneeling in s rosaries for hour and endless disputations and and the worship of saints what a Revival could you imagine being locked into that prison of the Catholic church and coming forth and realizing that that that you didn't have to go through that mother Harlot to make it that God had provided a way for you personally oh my and they they broke they they were they came out of it and the Protestant church was born Protestant was protester they protested those things they don't protest them anymore they just join right up and then Wesley came on the scene didn't he and he said wait a minute just because that we're forgiven doesn't mean that we can't live right and he began to preach the sanctification of the believer not the believer's sins are forgiven now that believer sanctifies himself sanctification means he sets himself aside for service I'm going to make my life that it's a life of service it it's not it it's not in fellowship with Darkness it can't how can two walk together unless they agree and Wesley be to preach the sanctification of the church they called a Methodist because they they had a method of sanctification of of reading and of praying and of works and and and and and addressing right and acting right and speaking right these became things that mattered to them and they begin to sanctify themselves and the early Methodist Church had the Holy Ghost they they called them shouters and and rolled and they praised God and and they they lived right and many people uh uh misunderstand the baptism of the Holy hly spirit because of restoration of gifts restoration of gifts was not the baptism of the Holy Spirit the baptism of the holy spirit is the nature of Jesus Christ coming into a Believer and the believer came to the place that they knew not only were they Justified not only were they Sanctified but they could do the same works that he did by his spirit and that the spirit of God could lead them and they could be led and the sons as many as called the sons of God are led by the spirit of God and and they moved into the baptism of the Holy Spirit they sought the outpouring of the spirit they sought what that those men experienced in the upper room being endued with power from on high not emotion not gift but a power that was Supernatural Christ in them the hope of glory and we watch that seed grow up and so as I listen to that and I thought of recognized the day in the message and pro of God talk man always fails to recognize where they're at and I thought Lord in my heart and and the spirit just moved on me and it just came so to my heart what where are we lord I want to recognize the day I want to recognize what its message is to me it's a call out so many times I say well I believe the message I been this message over 50 years I'll tell you I don't think I know half of it we've been patting one another on the back and making accolades about our elves you know we're the true church we're the bride and and you know like I said sometimes we ought to name our churches we're right and everybody else is wrong and I I think that that you know I I don't want to miss it and I cried out my heart and I thought Lord where are we and he says well David this is Harvest Time it's harvest time I'm going through now and I'm identifying ex separating the wheat from the shock it it's a time that it it's a time that there's a I'm making the change that I promised I made a promise and now I'm here to keep that promise I'm going to call out an elect I'm going to separate the sheep from the goats I'm going to have a church without spot or wrinkle and and that the process he he's going to perform the process and so I I I be I as I went and read this and I I wanted to make it clear to you this morning where I stand not only as an individual but because you've placed me in this office or God has and you've so diligently and Faithfully have sat under the ministry for years but I think you ought to have a right to know what I believe and what I stand for just as as plain as day and I thought of the way forward and that came on to me real early in the year you remember when I first began to preach it I thought about the going forward I want to go forward and as I looked and I I I I wrote these notes I said uh and a lot of people thought or maybe there was a way forward you know the the placing of the gifts uh in the church and speaking in in tongues and giving words of knowledge and prophecy and dancing in the spirit and praising and worshiping uh uh with emotion and expression and and and that that was presented to the church that there was a a a a move of the spirit again that the spirit was moving and that Pentecost was being revived and and and I just have to be honest with you I I I don't feel feel that it's the way forward now if you feel that way and you feel that's the path to go down then and if that that you feel that's the way the church should go then then you should join yourself to that don't sit in opposition don't fight him but if you feel that the path of the church going forward is the spirit moving and prophesying and speaking words of knowledge and and giving tongues and interpretations of tongues and dancing and shouting and running over the church that's fine I'm not against any of those things let them be done decently and in order but it's still I don't feel it's the path forward and I can only travel the path that I feel is a path that goes forward and you have to choose what's your path forward I've heard a lot of uh seemingly if I could say it this way of movements like and teachings and things of you know like another coming of the Lord you know where Jesus comes in in in a bride coming or he now he's coming in the form of his bride and and uh like there was one there was what they called perusia which was there's in a different anointing than there's ever been before that it this is the path we should take this movement this thinking this teaching and endlessly explaining it over I didn't feel that explanations of and pursuing explains and thoughts and trying to teach and and get terminologies and all those different things I just don't feel that's the path forward I don't feel it's going to get us there I I've seen so many of them the Thunders good men morally good men and they went down those paths because they believed in their heart that they were paths forward and that that was going to create some sort of Revival in in the hearts of men and women and Believers that was going to make them different there's only one thing that'll make you different and that you must be born again and it brought me to where that I stand this morning and the message that I say the way forward is this word and it's the bread that we live by and if you will go with me this morning and let us read in the gospel of St John in the sixth chapter of the Gospel of St John Jesus said that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and I'd like to start this morning just in our thought here this morning Jesus had just fed the 5,000 and the 3,000 and gathered up Loaves and Loaves and he turned and there was a great multitude that had followed him now all the scriptures and scriptural stories are are not given to us just to meditate on but they're given to us to reflect deeply in our own conscience to examine our own thinking and our Pursuits down life and Jesus said to him and and he said Jesus answered them Jesus answered them and said verily verily I say unto you you seek me not because you saw the Miracles but because you did eat of the Loaves and were filled just think of how their natural survival clouds their spirituality and so many times our natural natural burdens and our natural problems our health our finances our jobs and our rent that cloud our spirituality and we worry about things that we should never worry about and Jesus goes on to say he said labor not for the meat which perisheth but for the meat which in endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath God the Father sealed now listen to that because we are living in the day of the son of man then they said unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God Jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God that ye believe on him who he hath sent in every age every messenger that went out every Star that went out if you follow the church the Believers in every age have believed whom God sent so you say brother McGary what's the path forward the path forward is to believe whom God ha sent then they said therefore unto him what sign showest thou then that we may see and believe thee what Dost thou work the look at man God never built his church on Works he built it on divine revelation and if he if he built his church on divine revelation he'll vindicate his church by divine revelation you you are Vindicated by the Revelation that's manifested in you he said he and that we may see and believe what does thou work what is it by what power do you do this what is it that's working in you our fathers did eat Mana in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat now look at where they're at and now here come some of the greatest scriptures for the Believers let us walk through them just for a moment we'll try to hurry then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and gives life unto the world then said they unto him Lord Evermore give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I say unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not and all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out now you want to know a path forward he says all that cometh to me how do I believe believe on whom God hath sent he says for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day oh my I I hold that verse this is the will of the father this is what all that the father ha given me I won't lose one of them and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up in the last day what does see mean it doesn't mean with the eye it means to understand those that can understand him those that have Revelation those who eyes have been open to recognize the day and the hour that they're living those that hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled either you're looking for God or you're looking for the things of the world either you want something that's Supernatural that transpire in your life real Revelation and what was given to this lady Ela I counsel thee to B give me IAM that I may a see scen everything seen everything if if we've been offered a lot of paths forward we've had preacher after preacher after preacher go into this message and pull something out and and we've been told Lo man will come and say he's here and he's there this is the way but let me tell you something anything that breaks Fellowship is Antichrist he let the path God provides the way let's read further everyone that seeth the sun oh how many times did he say it's not me it's him whatever he he said he looks out at the audience and he says who do you say this is he would discern the thoughts and intents of the heart and then he would look at us and say do you remember the woman at the well she saw a man just like you're seeing you're strangers one to another aren't we and he would absolutely lay the whole setting why because he was Reimers nating to the Gentiles the same thing that he did for the Jews and after he discerned her thoughts and intents she looked at him and she said sir I perceive that thou art a prophet and we know when the Messiah comes that he'll do these things a charlot but he spoke something that he hardly spoke to nobody else any place in the Bible he said I am he and I'll tell you the Gentile Church in this AG saw Jesus Christ standing in their mid doing the same works nothing's ever touched it nothing's ever matched it oh I wonder if we hold it in the regards that it ought to be held as we read down it gets better and better and better and better the Jews then murmured at him but he because he said I am the bread which comes down from heaven the path forward is the word bread you want to go forward I want to go forward I want to share with you this morning what I believe the path forward is and if we want to walk this path together then we'll pray one for another we'll lift one for other up we'll bear one another's burdens we'll come shoulder toosh shoulder we'll have a union that's promised in this day an invisible Union between the Earthly bride and the Heavenly bridegroom there'll be a Oneness but until you establish that absolute until you establish that path then you've just got people looking for this way and looking for that way and offering this to you and offering that with you but I'll tell you one thing in the name of the Lord my sheep know my voice and another they will not follow and I heard him stand right in the pit said I am the voice of God to you I know you resented that but I am the voice of God to you let us read down they just murmured at him because he said I am the bread which cometh down from heaven and they said is this not Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith I come down from heaven and Jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves no man can come to me except the Father which hath sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day it is written in the the prophets and they shall be all taught of God best written in the prophets old and new Gentile and Jew it was written that the Jews would be taught by God and then he looks out and he says who do you say that the son of man is and then he looks at him he says as it is in the days of the son of man as it is in the days of Noah as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the of the son of man what was it God in man teaching the people you want to know the path forward you want to know where God's trying to take the church we'll get into it in just a moment but we've almost forgot the reverence of this message that it was God teaching us God veiled in flesh the unveiling of God who do you say this mesed is why is man looking for another way man looks for another way when he doesn't accept the provided way and I'll say it and I hope it goes around I believe that every minister in this message from the north to the South to the East and to the West is obligated by God to play the tapes to their congregations why would you keep the word from them no I'm not playing the a tape this morning I believe in preaching the only thing they've done with the tapes is they added the word only I believe in press play but somebody came and added one word only they added one word surely takes one word one word if it takes one word how much more should we stay with the word it's my own personal belief but I'm honestly with you this morning I believe the path forward to the church lies in the storehouse of God's word I don't believe it lies in teachings of Revelations from that word I don't believe it lies in a movement of the spirit I believe it lies in the Revelation and the bread of the word the bread of life that's our path forward you say do we know it all no Lord feed me how much more is in there how could Paul said you're like babes you can only drink milk you're not ready for the strong meat of God's word the scripture comes back and says you're fools you compare yourselves one with another why why why do men do that because their eyes are off what what they should be on work out your own salvation with fear and trembling if you have questions about this message you need to pray yourself through until you have a beyond a shadow of a doubt you know that this is the Word of Life they'll be taught of God that every man therefore that that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh to me well what's the path forward he that learnthe with to me if God ever does one thing one time he's got to do it a s he didn't leave this church into the hands of men that's why he said when the Holy Spirit comes and does these same works and you call it be elub there's no forgiveness for you in this life or the life to come because it was going to be more than a man you say no was brother Bram God no brother brand was a sinner saved by grace but it shows you the power of the blood shows you the power of a man that would dedicate himself to God and that's called and placed and elected I like what he said he said God just shows it to me I write it down and preach it you should you better better have confidence in the path you're on people have come to this conclusion I don't believe the path that brother David's on they thought it might be in the movement of the spirit and I give them credit for going forward and believing that's the path they ought to be on but let me tell you you better find a path because if you're lukewarm you'll be spilled out of his mouth you better find something in your life sir that becomes Your Divine leadership am your absolute your ultimate one of the last message he preached was leadership that this church was going to have to have Supernatural Divine leadership and you the Holy Spirit didn't even come to speak of himself but he came to bring you into remembrance of everything he taught I'm not yelling at you I'm trying to preach to myself not that any M man hath seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me have everlasting life I am the bread of life I believe the path forward is the bread of life your fathers that eat man in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die you see what the path forward is to eat I am the living bread which cometh down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world and the Jews strove amongst themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then Jesus said un them verily verily i s un you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man you you you can't miss that the bread I am the bread what was he yes he was a prophet he came in the form of a son of man God failed in flesh and now he and and to make it in that day they had to eat that word and then in order to be just to the Gentiles he comes right back in this day in the same Ministry no difference between the ministry of Jesus Christ and this last day Ministry except the Corporal body it was the Eternal Word truth of God he said if you don't eat the bread of life that the son of man is providing you'll perish so many of us believe and don't eat we just don't eat oh I got so much to go I just going to have to stop it's 11 11 o'clock is that clock right is it 12 11:40 all right I'll just try to close I'll I'll leave this part off except that you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life In You whosoever eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I'll raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father hath sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me let me read that St again as the living father hath sent me and I live by the father verily verily I do nothing so he that eateth me even shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven now not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead he that eateth this bread shall live forever we find out Simply I just like to read if you Brothers if you go to harvest time I'll spend just a few moments reading some quotes to you this morning cuz I hope that you catch it cuz now he's preaching it's harvest time it's time to leave what have we been trying to tell you there's change happening God's changing the dedication the heart of the believer we're not here to condemn we're here to encourage I I'm the chiefest of Sinners I preached this to myself this morning it's so easy to run from the presence of God but to get in there knowing all that's been laid up for you it wasn't laid up for those people in the meetings they were there to see the Miracles but he left food he left bread he left substance CU he knew there was going to come a time in this country where there was such a drought for spiritual food that people would be chasing after this and chasing after that and going after this and trying to Manu manufacture this and Manufacturing that and here it's been sitting there all the time but you've got to make that decision within your own heart it's not by association it's not by Fellowship it's not by church membership it's by eating the book it's by eating the word now listen as we just read these statements if you would help me I'd like to just start with paragraph 70 it says now if this is kind of puzzling and about a man being Brad and being the word let's now go and search for this let's find out the scriptures are all true and they cannot be ever broken every scripture will be fulfilled no matter how strange it seems It's always be fulfilled paragraph 87 now now because I'm talking this morning about the path forward I I want to read to you now from the message Harvest Time what I believe the path forward is and if you believe I ask you to to join with me in a greater dedication to this message than we've ever had before if you're not then I ask you to seek with all your heart the path that you want to go down and find it is that fair Jesus said that they might be one father as you and I are one not for some men to be over something it never will work one denomination wants to take over the other and one man over the other one but that ye might be one with God like Christ and God was one that's what the prayer is that he was the word and Jesus prayed that we might might be the word reflecting him that is prayer to be answered that is his prayer to be answered that we will be one that we will reflect him you say which way do I want to go let's just let's just stay with it see Satan squabbles up the carnal mind but that wasn't Jesus prayer at all that we might all congregate together and all have a certain Creed and so forth every time they do it they go further and further from God it wasn't his will that we came up with a teaching and a Doctrine whether it be this coming whether it be that coming whether it be this anointing whether it be this teaching he said every time man tries to unite that way it takes him further from God is it plain and men go from pillar to post looking for something to latch on to he wants us to be one with God and God is the word each individual in his heart must be that one with God paragraph 101 that was his plan I am God he says I cannot change that's still his plan it's never his plan for Creeds or organizations or man-made rules and man shall live by rules that man shall live by by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God that's his plan so if I want to go forward the only way I can go forward is in his plan and his plan is to eat the word of God that's the path forward it's not coming up with something outside of what we've got it's letting what we've got change us paragraph 109 now see it's not it's not our good living that just something goes with it it isn't our church loyalty that go with it with it but the main thing is staying with that word don't eat nothing else but the word stay with it he is that word now we want to watch close now and he's going back to the Garden what did Satan get Eve to do to eat is that right when Jesus is up there being tempted what did Satan try to get him to do to eat what he Satan never changes his tactics what do you think he's going to try to get you to do eat something we got way too many chefs in the land God sent us one Vindicated scripturally identified Malachi 4:5 Luke 130 Revelations 10:7 paragraph 115 don't put a bishop over it let the Holy Ghost stay over it see the Holy Ghost was sent to keep the weeds and things out not what the bishop thinks or an overseer or so forth it takes the Holy Spirit to keep that church in its condition he was that perfect word as we will see he says he say and he goes on to say that we have the same choice I'd like just to continue reading a few spots now he made everything work to his glory that's what his attributes are doing displaying his go Glory one vessel of honor and one of Dishonor but it's God that makes it not him that willth or him that runneth but God that showeth Mercy see no man can come to me said Jesus except my father draws him and all that the father hath this is paragraph 125 past tense given to me will come to me to the word so if if all that the father had given him would come to him and that's the word then we know what the path forward is it's not something that someone's bringing up to us putting quotes together and making teachings you don't need something that's batched up if you understand if if it's already made for you just exactly to your taste just exactly to your need some of you have favorite food food we all give Jerome a hard time cuz he likes chicken you want to go to lunch let's go have chicken right Roman he's got places he likes Fried Chicken you know what I mean now I ain't gonna whoop up some old batch of some kind of bird and try to convince him to eat it you ought to know what you want to eat we ought to know what this message does for us when we listen to it when we read it and when we obey it and I'm going to try to hurry here because I I want to read some statements about our Bible he said the word how how can they come unless they were are all they were foreordained to come as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God see cuz their names were on the book he come to redeem what was on the book okay isn't that really what we've all been Desiring is to be the pure Sons and Daughters of God as brother Jim I just love that just one day he dropped that scripture i in it was like my whole life changed herein is the love of God made perfect as he is so are we in this world that's our path we already know that power without character satanic you can't be sitting there having a big college television football blowout party and the next morning be sitting in church running around speaking in tongues and prophesying that's what he that's what he he he just blasted the church for that but you know the best way to get rid of that conviction is take his voice out of the church because you know what happens when you put on a tape something will sneak up out of that tape that you missed but what set you free the truth set you free Jesus said I am the way the truth the life no man comes to the father but by me and he was the word Jesus brought his word to this generation and identified it if you took every Doctrine in every Bible teaching from every church and you put it through the filter of God's word a great big funnel and you filtered it through the filter of God's word what you would have what after it all got filtered is the message of the hour cuz it's the truth you saywell brother brandom's come and gone he did what God had him to do the truth that he taught was the Eternal Word of God not the 20th century word of God and it was left for you to eat he said if you eat this bread you you will have the power to become the Sons and Daughters of God that's life you talk about getting something answered as many as received him he gave power to become the sons of God cuz their names are written on on the Lamb's Book of Life he come to redeem them on the book over here he says he's trying to find a man that would live the whole word of God would you turn with me to paragraph 143 are you there Brothers now this is our path forward this is what he's trying to bring us to this is what eating his word will do for us we are we as Christians are only reflecting him the moon only reflects the son in its absence and the believer only reflects the Son of God in the absence of the Son of God is it's the light of the Bible it's the light of the Bible the scriptures being Vindicated in our lives the word that makes light in darkness the word that makes light in darkness it shall be light in the evening time hello light hello light of the world ye are the light of the world no man lith a candle and put it under a bule basket don't look at what you are look at what he can make you don't look at where you've been look at where he can take you all things are possible look at your heart could you imagine that eagle in that chicken yard just saying oh I'm eating this chicken food I'm eating like that I'm just so bad there's no way I can fly no he looked up and saw something he wanted to be that's what I want to be I want to be a son I want to be a reflection of the Bible I want him to reflect himself in my life I want get rid of the things out of my life that aren't him I I want to pray I want to fast I want to ask for deliverance I want to overcome blessed is he that overcometh for him shall the father give the kingdom it's given to the Overcomer you want your path to Victory eat only reflection of him that's the light of the Bible the scripture being Vindicated in our lives the word that makes light in darkness you are candles that sets upon a hill that ain't the sun it's a candle the candle just takes the place of the sun just shows a certain amount of light we are God's children we are Sons and Daughters of God Only by the spirit with portion he had it without a portion we are the stars that shining all of us together makes the light to the world but he is the entire son that reflects the light to every Star Hallelujah I believe him God help my unbelief you want to go forward get rid of your unbelief quit calling yourself Devils quit running yourself down for your past you you've heard the expression you can lead a horse of water but you can't make them drink drink come drink from the Fountain of Life free [Music] really you think if if there was a a drought in the land and there is a bottle of water in this church you don't think a sinner would find his way through those doors that he could get a drink of Living Water sure he would and you've got it on your Comm computers you've got it on your phones you've got it in books you've got it on tapes i i i i Marvel at myself how little I drink going have to turn these into glass how little the path forward that's what he does this is paragraph 48 and that's what he does to every organization that's what he does to to every individual he tries to give you the natural things that you can look at and it takes you away well look at this great big church why they got so many millions in it our church is the biggest church in the city well we have the mayor comes to our church see all that our pastor has a degree a DD an LD a pH d That's well that well he he is uh bound to be a smart man a Catholic priest can come around and cover him over any time with his degrees he's got 60 some odd books he has to know as bad as much as you know the Bible to get his degree to be a priest so don't try to compare educ ation that's just like the world it's always trying to compare don't compare with things of the world don't compare with churches compare with the Bible that's what we're we're doing today that's what the matter with us Pentecostal churches that's what the matter with our qu quartets and singers and so forth as we have we're trying to act like Hollywood Hollywood Glitters the gospel glows there is a difference between a glitter and a glow see Hollywood Glitters from clothes and Ricky and ricettas and rickettes but God humbly glows in humility of the believer no matter how ignorant he is he glows in humility not shines in Hollywood paragraph 53 now Satan tries the same tactics on Jesus he tries on the rest of them he tried to make him eat something besides the promised bread work word you see how clear the path forward is this is Harvest time because Jesus said it is written man shall not live by bread alone see he tried to make him obey him though it looked pretty good looked like he could feed himself he could have done it it and he says 55 you notice they tried to make him eat something besides the bread of life that every man should live by but Jesus stayed with the father's word oh he didn't hit Eve oh he didn't hit Eve then he never hit Moses he never hit any of the rest of them he hit one was going to reflect every word when he ran into him reflect every word see he is he that's the reason he was the word but Jesus stayed with the word refusing his theary s Cemetary Doctrine yes sir his new light his more experience he couldn't push it on Jesus like he pushed it off on Eve to show her oh surely God do you hear what he said his new light everybody goes to the same books the same tapes and for some reason people can come up with new light let's get the light that's in there but this is what he said now we find out that he failed Jesus went right back to him with thus sayeth the Lord now this is 57 now when he sees that believer watch the believer come in the same category now each one of you when he sees you're going to stay with the Bible yes I believe the Bible I ain't joining no Creed the things out there I'm going to stay with the Bible and and as ever if he can't get you to believe it to live a real true and to believe the word I want you to notice what he done to Jesus the second time if he ain't get you I ain't going to join no Creed I'm going to I'm I was born free I'm going to stay with it I'm going to do this or to do that see we're we're of that category you know so what he what what he tries to do he tries to educate you substitute let's just read 60 and we're closing but Jesus said when he the spirit of Truth has come see he will bring all these things that I have taught you to your memory the word and he'll show you things to come there is the real Spirit-filled church now stays with the word reflects the word God on Earth he doesn't need any Theologian because his word is of no private interpretation he interprets his own word by vindicating it and proving it to be true paragraph 177 now watch as we hurry through when the spirit of Truth is come he will teach you all all things whatsoever I have taught you oh my bearing all remembrance to you what I've said to you bring to you all remembrance he will show you things to come he will vindicate every word confirming it the word with signs following everything that he promised that God promised in the Bible if you'll turn turn loose of every Creed and everything else and hold unto the word God is obligated to take care of his word and so when you do this the word vindicates itself and then turning and reading in 278 now the second Eve watch her she was created a new like he was on the day of Pentecost filled with the spirit and fed by the word now I'm getting religious I feel good that first church that first Eve which was to be Christ's bride how many can say Amen she was to be Christ's bride she was born at Pentecost not Nia Rome not in London England not not in the United States not in Germany with Luther not in England with Wesley not in the United States with Pentecost so-called she was born on the day of Pentecost she was Spirit-filled she was Spirit-filled and word fed every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God even to Judas oh they just had to take everything just just word by word a real blooming plant on God's Earth representing him another bride tree how did she have to take it word by word that was Satan's other trick just put it in one great big conclusion one great big explanation package it up into one big thought that's not a path a path is something you go down that's a camp when you got it all figured out and you got all the doctrine and you got the teaching this is what we believe this is our terminology this is how we look at this this is how we look at that this is what brother Bram said this is what brother brandham meant that's not a p that's a camp does that bring a message to mind going beyond the camp the footsteps of the righteous are led by the Lord what's the path forward the path forward is word by word line upon line precept upon precept I'm a part of this word I'm going to live by this word I'm going to feed on this word he said his Word of Promise reflects him in her paragraph 279 they had to take notice to Peter and them they hadn't been to Seminary and they know that they hadn't been to any Bible School some theological Cemetery Seminary they had no education because they couldn't even write their own name the Bible said they were ignorant and unlearned but what happened they had taken note they had been with Jesus and there he was in them reflecting his promise glory glory to God that's what we need in this age his word reflect in him in her the church she was alive by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God I think I have one last statement look here there must come forth a true seed paragraph 297 there has got to be cuz he's coming for the bride without spot or wrinkle he's coming for it a word Vindicated bride oh she'll be such a little bitty group Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah wherein eight Souls were saved is that right so shall it be in the coming of the son of man how many I don't know but see the bride is is going to May made up all down through that the word in their age it's not just this last group God is going to take the whole thing out of here amen that's a sobering thought isn't it so I I just this morning if I could say to you I believe the path forward for for this bride is in the storehouse of God's word that came by the message of the hour and we're going to walk through it it's not a camp it's a path and we know one thing if the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ dwell in us if we can reflect that Bible in in us if that same Spirit be in us that was him and we live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God that spirit will also Quicken our mortal bodies God bless you brother Billy amen God bless you let yall stand this morning be fed by every word of God Amen why don't we sing
