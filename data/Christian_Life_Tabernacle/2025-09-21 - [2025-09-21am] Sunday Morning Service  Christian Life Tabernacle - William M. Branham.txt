Description:
Sunday Morning Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
September 21th, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believer
 in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

And father, may each heart walk from this place knowing that you love them. We ask that you would help us this morning. In Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Thank you musicians. So nice. If you have your Bibles, let's uh turn in our Bibles to uh uh we're going to read two places. Uh let's start in Matthew 28:18. I think I have a think also um I think also we want to read in Matthew uh 10:8 and we'll read here in ma Matthew the 10th chapter and then we'll go to the 28th and then we'll go to Mark uh 16. So let us just read here. It says in the fifth verse of the 10th chapter, it says, "These 12 Jesus sent forth and commanded them, saying, go not un to the way of the Gentile, and unto the cities of Samaria, enter ye not, but rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, As you as you go, preach, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the leopard, raise the dead, cast out devils. Freely ye have received, freely give." &gt;&gt; Amen. And then let's turn over to uh Matthew the 28th chapter. And the 16th verse and we just start with the 18th verse. And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. And lo, I am with you always, even until the end of the world. Amen. Doesn't that make you feel good? Hallelujah. And then also in Mark starting with the 14th verse of the 16th chapter of the Gospel of St. Mark. Amen. He said, "Afterwards, he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at me and upgraded them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen." And he said unto them, "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe. In my name shall they cast out devils. They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents. And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. Our gracious father, we ask you to bless your word to us in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. May be seated this morning. We we want to take our thoughts this morning from a message that our prophet preached called end time evangelism. And you know so as you know in the beginning of the year um my heart was moved in the direction of uh what's our path forward or where do we go from here? you know what direction uh uh should we go not only as individuals but as a body of believers not only as a body of believers but as a family your home your life uh I think that we each of us in our lives should have a goal uh we should have a vision uh without a vision and the people perish. Something that's on your heart, something that you desire to do, a a way that you want to be, something that you want to accomplish. And in your home, you you want your home to be a certain way. You want your life to be a certain way. Uh and you want the church uh to be a certain way. and and so wi without that desire to go forward uh then you you can't just sit still, you know, because we're told that either you're going to leave better or worse. either you're going to uh get something from God and and and uh try to put that in your heart and live it with with all of your life or you're going to uh let that uh fall away. Isn't that right? Amen. So, if I would ask you this morning and I would say uh do you love the Lord? Well, uh, the English people would say yes, and the French people would say we, and the Spanish people would say see. Yes, we see. That's pretty good because that's what it's about. Yes, we see. You understand? We We see. We have a vision. We get it. We're We're catching hold of it. We understand what it is that we where we want to go, the path that we we want to go forward, the direction that we want to go in. So our our hearts now can be a flame. It's hard to be on fire for something you don't believe in. You know, it's hard to put your effort into something that you're not sure of. You know, and that's why Satan, one of the greatest things he likes to do is author confusion because confusion paralyzes you. &gt;&gt; You're not sure of the outcome. You're not sure of the result. Many people don't pray for the sick because they're not sure of the outcome. You you understand there are they're they're afraid that they won't get what they asked for that that that fear paralyzes them from doing it. But I like the way our messenger approached it. God said, "Lay your hands on the sick." So if I lay my hands on 500 people and they all die, I'm going to lay my hands on somebody else because that's what he said. &gt;&gt; And and and whatever his will is, that's what our heart's desire is. So, we're we're talking about when we talk about end time evangelism and we begin to uh uh talk about these, I I want to uh talk a little bit because we we begin to talk about um what direction that we want to go in as a body. Now, I hope that you feel you're a part of the body of believers. not just the local body but the body of Christ, the mystical body of Christ where he's the head of our body. So if he's the head of body and we're the body members in particular, each one of us having gifts and talents and and hearts desires and personalities, God made it that way. He he put it that way. And then by his spirit he fits and joins us together. Each need supplying to the other. So the body becomes something that that it does does a work without and it does a work within. &gt;&gt; You you you want you understand that you you feed your body, right? And you're there's a work going on within your body. It's taking the food you eat and it's turning it into glucose and it's putting it into your body and it's building cells and and you work and you build muscles and and uh and so that you have actually have an internal working of your body. You're drinking. You're eating, you're breathing, you're staying alive, and then your body does outside work. So, it's got inside work and outside work. And both of those works have to work together. &gt;&gt; Do you understand what I'm saying? Is that that you you've got to you've got to get u the inside working. If you if your inside's not working, we call that being sick, right? And when you're sick, it's hard to work when you're sick. So, if the inside's not working, the outside doesn't work too good. So, I think you understand what I'm saying. Now, I'm saying this pertaining to the body of believers. And we're just going to go a little down a little path this morning, if you'll go there with me. Now, this is what the prophet of God said. He says we we have no denomination. So we don't belong to any denomination. We don't have state prespators. We don't have overseers. We don't have a pope. You you understand? We we we're a sovereign body. Just like you're a sovereign individual, we're a sovereign body. So we're not connected to any group that we have to believe a certain way or we have certain qualifications. Now many of you may not realize this but you know how I'll just throw this in there. I just feel to but you know how denominations work like within the assemblies of God. If we were to join the assemblies of God we would be a franchise. And we would pay the assembly of God to use their name, Assembly of God. And then we would we would pay a franchise fee for being a part of that group. Now, I know that seems strange to you, but it's it's spiritual McDonald's. They all got the same menu, &gt;&gt; right? They all got the same name. &gt;&gt; Now, you can own that McDonald's, but you pay for that franchise. You're a part of that. Now, we're not part of anything that we franchise to. First of all, we got to realize we're a local assembly. We're a local body. So the way we operate is the way we choose to operate. I didn't say the way I choose to operate, the way we choose to operate. And this is how our messenger explains it. He says, he says, "We're no denomination. We're just gathered. We just gather." &gt;&gt; And really, that's what we do. We just gather. &gt;&gt; We just gather. The people that believe in God greater gather together to worship the Lord together to offer our prayers to God to make our confessions to him. And each Sunday and each day we go through a purgatory that is po pouring puring our souls by his holy spirit from our sins trying to live as godly as we know in this present age looking for his appearing at any time. for we are looking for that at any time. Now, I want you to hold that thought there uh just a moment a as he begins to explain what what we are. We're looking for that appearing. So, we have gathered here together. This isn't a career seminar, you know what I mean? We're not teaching ways to make more money, right? But we're we're we're here to prepare for his soon coming. &gt;&gt; His soon coming and and so that that plays an important part of that. So, I'm just going to read the little statements and and make comments on them and and and so and he says this. He says the same thing today. When you see his work, we see we see we right. We see. Yes. We see when we see his work, right? when you see his work. Now, we have already seen and witnessed the appearing of the Lord. Now, remember, appearing and coming are two different words. The appearing and then to come. Now is the appearing. He's already appeared in these last days, right here with us in the last few years. Now, it's a sign of his coming. He's appearing in his church in the form of the Holy Spirit, showing that that it's him because people cannot do these things that you see the you see the Holy Spirit doing. So, that's the appearing of the Lord. Now remember I it spoke in both places appearing and coming. So we know the Lord's appeared in our day or as we would say he's came in our day. Is that right? As Gentiles we see that the Gentiles never had the signs and wonders. They never had the things that that the Jews saw. But now the Gentiles saw that demonstrated also. So now God can judge them both equally because they both equally have seen. So we know the Lord Jesus appeared or we would say he came in this day. Jesus came. He took a prophetic ministry &gt;&gt; and he veiled himself in that body. So we saw William Brham the man, but yet it was the Lord Jesus who was in that man doing the work, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yes, we see. &gt;&gt; We see that. You understand? It's been revealed to us. &gt;&gt; We know that. Now, it it's hard to go forward sometimes if you don't see things. You know, it's like your your your your children, they may not see that. So, they come to church for you &gt;&gt; because they don't want the consequences, &gt;&gt; right? So, we make you go to church. My children, we made them go to church. And sometimes they would sit on the back row staring at the ceiling. You know what I mean? But we made them go to church because we had a promise that if we raised them up in the way that they were to go that that they would come to the knowledge of the truth. And then by grace and by the mercy of the Lord, they each came to the place where they saw it for themselves. &gt;&gt; They saw it. I see it. I see it. I recognize it. I I understand it. It's been open to me. And And so that that's so we see those things. And and so he said so he upgraded them for the hardness of their heart because they didn't believe those things believed those who had seen it. I believe to do the same thing today that they didn't believe the testimony of those people and he upgraded them for it and then he commissioned them to go into the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he would be with them to the consummation of the end of the world and these signs shall follow. So he commissioned those that saw, those that believed. He gave them a commission. The scripture refers to it in some places as a reasonable service. This is if you see it and then you you're obligated to tell somebody because it was freely given to you. So freely give &gt;&gt; and and you know so we know that God's done something. We know that God's moving. We know that he's alive. We know that he's resurrected. We know that he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. But we don't want to be paralyzed. You understand? We we just don't want to to know it as a form of intellect. But he that's why he took it from just being the trans um the transferring of knowledge into something of a a greater work. So it just wasn't the transfer of knowledge that I've come. He says, "No, I'm going to give you something that makes the word of God alive and real, &gt;&gt; that shows and proves that we're not looking back at history 2,000 years ago. We're not saying that Jesus Christ rose from the dead. We're saying he's here." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's here and he's the same. &gt;&gt; That's what we want to see. &gt;&gt; Okay. He's here to do the same signs and wonders. If we believe that, then those signs will follow them that believe. So if if I get a devil on me. Well, none of you have ever had a devil on you. Oh, I'm sitting in the heavenly places this morning in Christ Jesus. No. The devil's like a roaring lion, right? &gt;&gt; He's like a a a a a tiger or a lion. You know how they set their claws in you and they just hold on to you and and I I've I've watched the films and and and nature of of the lion grabbing a hold or the or the hyena and and they just hold on and hold on until you just don't have any strength and they try to bring you down. Well, I've had the devil bite on me. &gt;&gt; I've had him sink those old teeth into me. Just try to drag me down and get me so weary that you just don't want to go forward. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But we can cast those devils off. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We can shake those spirits off of &gt;&gt; If we believe and we have faith, &gt;&gt; we can cast those spirits out. We get sick sometimes. I want to thank the brothers. My ankle. I was just getting to where I could hardly walk and and the brothers prayed for me and the Lord, he he really touched me, you know. The next day I I was I was so much better. It was You knew it was the Lord. &gt;&gt; We we we we see. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? Yes. We see we see that that's a reality to us. &gt;&gt; Okay. So we we we we we come together on the the power of the resurrection. Now, this is go I'm just going through this because if you just bear with me this morning, he says, he says, "Today we try to take the written word, we have in letter form, creed form, and so forth to all the world." Okay? So, he says that's what we do. We have the Bible, right? So we try to take the Bible and say this is the word of God. We know that God sent a prophet in Malachi 4:5. So we we we we try to take the scripture and say according to the scripture, God was to send a prophet in Malachi 4:5. We know according to the scripture, God was to open the seals. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. In Revelations 10 that we are going to have an understanding of what the seals were, what the horse riders, that's something that he promised. Okay. Now, you can you you can't take that to people without you having a life &gt;&gt; that identifies that you've seen it. That's right. &gt;&gt; How can you say I believe that the prophet, great prophet was sent before the great and dreadful day of the Lord before his coming and then we don't live like he's coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? So there there there's there not only is it working within but it's it's working without. &gt;&gt; So there's there there becomes now we're talking about evangelism. &gt;&gt; We're talking about the commission. &gt;&gt; Okay. How does it work? What what method did God set in place &gt;&gt; for the church to carry out his commission because we're all ordered. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; As our messenger said, if you're convinced, you're concerned. &gt;&gt; So there there's a way to approach it. There's an understanding we have. And I hope as I read these things to you, they unfold a little bit to you and you can place yourself in the body. You've got to realize, you've got to place yourself in the body because in order to evangelize, not only are you bringing the word out to the world, but the word has to be working in the body. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, if we don't care one for another, if we're not praying for our own sick, right? If we're not visiting the widow and the fatherless, if we're not doing the works within the body, if the body's not working together and it's not fitted and joined together, then the outsider can't see the manifestation of the word of God. You understand? Because he didn't say, "I'm going to read it, but I'm just explaining what I'm going to read." He didn't say, "Go give it out in letter form." &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Go out and teach it." &gt;&gt; He said, "Preach it." &gt;&gt; Because God's word is preached by manifestation. &gt;&gt; Let's just read it. these uh this is I'm just reading out of end time evangelism. He said he says but Jesus said go and preach the gospel. He never said teach the word. He said preach the gospel and the gospel came not in word only. So it comes in word okay but not in word only. So right so so preach the gospel came not in word only but through the manifestation of the word. For the only way that it could be done was to make his promise come to pass. Now, we're talking about end time evangelism. It doesn't do any good for us to preach the promise if the promises aren't coming to pass. But that's why he lets us know. Correct? Because it's by these great and exceedingly precious promises that we're partakers of the spirit and nature of God. &gt;&gt; God is with us. We know that God is with us when he's bringing his word &gt;&gt; to pass. We know that we're a body of believers when we have care one for another, love one for another, we're doing the body work, &gt;&gt; taking care of one another, doing the works of the Lord within our own framework with our own body. We're all participating and applying the promises of God one to another. Then you go evangelize &gt;&gt; and someone walks into your midst and they see that God's here. &gt;&gt; Why is he here? Because the promises of God's word are coming to pass. &gt;&gt; The gospel is just not being preached. But there's a people &gt;&gt; that are living what they're talking about. &gt;&gt; So the body so that it it's from without. So we're commissioned to go into all the world. Is that right? Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, they had that problem in the first church. They all went out preaching and then they got there and the people began to complain because the widows weren't being fed, the fatherless, there was all kinds of problems and everything. And and and then the the the disciples said, "Well, we can't stop what we're doing. to to attend to these things. So he said you pick some men amongst you and you start attending to these situations. That was how the church birthed. Well, that's what we do. You know, I can preach the gospel, but you've got to take care of the body. You've got to look out after one another. I mean, you know, we have new people. We have people that are fresh in the message. We got different places. We attend one to another because some some of you elderly sisters, the scripture says you teach the younger women how to dress, how to conduct themselves, how to honor their husbands. If you see a sister that that it's got high heels, you know, I I don't have time to run out in the parking lot. I have with some. I have walked up and say, "Sister, may I talk to you? a little bit. You know, your heels are we we don't wear high heels or or maybe a dress is too tight or too short or maybe some brother's got, you know, long hair or whatever is is going on. Those are all ABC thing, but they're things we take care of amongst ourselves. You know, if you know somebody's got odd against somebody and e And so the body begins to to work within its own framework. In other words, it I believe the scripture I you know that first of all charity begins at the household of faith. So it come so it starts with me and then what's going on with me extends outward. And so, but it's it's the manifestation. In other words, if we just sit here because we believe that God sent a prophet, that's the letter. &gt;&gt; Where's the manifestation of our faith? &gt;&gt; Where's the proof that I believe what he said? Well, that has got to be brought forth because God manifests his word. That's what he does. He says, "For the only way it could be done was to make his promises come to pass." He says, "And the only way you can do that is not by a track. But by the Holy Spirit working through you, your life becomes his life. He is in you. &gt;&gt; Now this is how the beginning of evangelism. This was the beginning. He said, "You must be born again. You must be born again. There's got to be something that transpires within you as an individual that you possess. You can't belong." That's the strength of denominationalism is they they create a sense amongst the people that if you belong and you come here, you're good. And they come by the thousands and they feel that their strength and their comfort is in their numbers or in their agreeing one with another. And and it it's we're not here because we agree one with another. We're here because we want to worship, serve the Lord, purge ourselves, and prepare for his &gt;&gt; coming. That's what we're here for. And we're here to minister one to another within the framework of our body. That when one of us is sick, we all are sick with him. &gt;&gt; When one of us grieavves, we all grieve with him. When one of us rejoices, we all rejoice with him. We're in it because they'll know that we are his disciples by our love one for another, our care one for another, our our mental acuity to the fact that we see and we recognize and understand that we're part of one another and part of a body. The scripture plainly states is that if you say you're not part of the body, then you're not part of the body. Now that's within your own selves that you that you that you see that you that you actually feel within the framework of your heart that I have a love and an understanding that I'm I want to take care of my brother. They're a part of me. I want them to make it. &gt;&gt; I want to help them make it. &gt;&gt; I want to share their burdens, bear their burdens, bear their sufferings, pray with them. I when I I come to the household of faith, I'm not just fulfilling an obligation. I'm here to be of service to to those I'm sitting with. What can I do for you this morning? How can I help you, sister? Are you going through anything? What's your burdens? What's your trouble? You care one for another. you when somebody that doesn't have that in their life and you go out into the world because we're talking about evangelism and you introduce somebody to this message, you tell them what God's done in this last day and we'll get to this in a moment. And then they could come into the confines of a body and find out there's a people there that believe this. &gt;&gt; They believe in the coming of the Lord. They believe in that in laying hands on the sick. They believe on being born again. They they believe those things. They're living those things. They're practicing those things. the it it's it's when their eyes are open to that then they know that God is with you &gt;&gt; and he's alive in your midst. &gt;&gt; But what happens if someone you you you preach the great story and they come in and and you're backbiting. There's people hungry. Nobody has a burden for anybody. You hear somebody's out of work and you don't pray that they get a job or you don't offer any help or the in other word it it doesn't do any good if it just remains in theory. Okay. And in teaching, the teaching's true, but it didn't come. I am the way, the truth, and the life. So, we know that this is the way. We know the message for the hour is the way. We know it's the truth. But now we've got to connect the life &gt;&gt; not only in our individual life but in our body church life. And there it's easy to come to church because you believe in the message. Brother Random said, "Come to church on Sunday. This is a message church. I'm coming to this church. I'm going to sit here. I'm going to take care of my Sunday duty." That's a creed. And I'm going to leave and I'll be back next Sunday morning to fulfill. Well, I hate to say it, but that's you're a part of a a a dogma. &gt;&gt; You're a part of a creed. You're fulfilling an ordinance. You're fulfilling a moral code. I don't believe that's what the messenger was desiring from the church. He wants every individual in here to be empowered with the power of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Silver and gold have I none. But that which I have, I give. Freely I've been given. Freely I receive. Freely I give. I don't come here to fulfill the obligation. I come here because I'm looking for the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And I want to serve God's people. &gt;&gt; The love of God is shed abroad in my heart by the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; I love and I care. I've entered into the capstone of the believer. Now this is this is a life that you can possess. Let's go further if if you would bear with me. He says, "So it's not passing out a track. It it's the Holy Spirit working through you. Your life becomes his life. He is in you." Now, that was the foundation for evangelism because the scripture said, "You must be born again." &gt;&gt; And the guy says, "Well, how can I reenter into my mother's womb?" And Jesus says, "Look at the spirit. Look at the wind." In other words, you were born with the nature. You were born in sin, shaped into the iniquity, came into the world speaking lies. Blame your mom and dad for that. And they can blame their mom and dad and they can blame their mom and dad and they can blame and it'll go all the way back to the Garden of Eden. We left God. Mankind left God. And once they left God, they no longer had his nature and his spirit because that we came into the world through an act of sin. Now God through marriage gave a place where that act was sanctified and it was holy and it could bring forth children and men could live fulfilling the desire of his flesh, the need for companionship and he could go forward in life. Man makes lots of mistakes, but God provides grace and mercy and forgiveness. And when a man goes one way, all he can do is come back, repent of his sins, and start a fresh. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's all you can do is start a fresh believing that if you confess your sins, he's faithful and just to forgive them &gt;&gt; and to throw them into the sea of God's forgetfulness to be remembered no more. Don't you remember them? You go on. Even in marriage and divorce, he said, "You go on the way that you are. Go forward. &gt;&gt; Do the best you can. It's all you can do. But let's understand where it comes from and what the church is based on and what's it mean when we say born again. He said the heathens when they worshiped the idol, they prostrate themselves before the idol and believe that that idol talks back to them. that God, their God turned, comes into this idol and spoke back through them. Now, that's what they believe. That's what a heathen believes. They put the idol there. Now, they believe that God comes into the idol and speaks to them through the idol. Pretty close. You know, &gt;&gt; at least they believe God's speaking to them. &gt;&gt; Now, let's just stay if we could. Now, that's just contrary turned around what God is. Listen, God doesn't deal with idols. You are his instrument. &gt;&gt; You prostrate yourself before God and he comes in you and speaks out to the people. That's the difference. He's the living God for a living person, not a dead God to a dead idol. He's a living God to a living being. You become his witness. What he said is what he said here. We're talking about the beginning of evangelism is you become his instrument. &gt;&gt; You lay yourself prostrate before God. Now, we can't circumvent what God program is. He said, "Repent." &gt;&gt; That's what he said. Repent. That that was that began. Men and brethren, what must we do? Repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Now I I I'll just leave what I want to say maybe for another time. He said that. Notice many people say that was just for the apostles. He said, "Go into all the world and preach this gospel to every creature." Conjunction. These signs shall follow them that believe. It's not a moral code. It's an experience that you've had that you're sharing with somebody else. until you've repented, &gt;&gt; till you know what it's like to say that you're sorry, &gt;&gt; to recognize. You can't ask somebody else to recognize their sins, recognize their faults, recognize their shortcomings if you've never recognized your own. If you don't, if you can't identify, I know what it's like to be a sinner. &gt;&gt; I know what you're going through. I know what it feels like to be lost. I know the pressure that you're under. I know that Satan talks to your mind. But I've got something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's not something I know about. It's something that I went through the process and I got the results. I followed the recipe &gt;&gt; and I got the cake &gt;&gt; and it was everything that he said it would be. &gt;&gt; This is what I'm offering to you. &gt;&gt; Life, &gt;&gt; joy, peace. These things are real. These are things that a a believer he a believer has because he's he he's he's moved upon by it and that and that's what that that's what the the believers built on. Now listen to this. Very close. The Christian knows it's the coming of the Lord. There's an atmosphere. It depends on what you're looking at. For the Lord has strictly told us just what was going to happen at the time. And we don't know the minute or the hour, but we know we are nearing it somehow. Now we're we're looking for the coming of the Lord. That is the joy of the believer. &gt;&gt; May I read a little more? So, we know the world's under pressure. How many knows it's under pressure? &gt;&gt; I mean, it's I mean, you got to turn turn off the news, the radio, all they want to talk about is division and demons and this group hates this and democracy. They're they're not going to save democracy. They're not going to save America. &gt;&gt; Spiritually speaking, in case somebody's watching me on YouTube or something, but I've been cancelled enough that I I don't think there's no more places left to put a stamp. There's no hope. &gt;&gt; It's gone. There's only one hope &gt;&gt; and that's the coming of the Lord &gt;&gt; there's only one peace &gt;&gt; that's to be found &gt;&gt; out of this confusion out of this mess out of this financial trouble and that's the Lord Jesus Christ. He's the way out. &gt;&gt; And you &gt;&gt; as an individual have found the way out. &gt;&gt; You have found your way to peace. &gt;&gt; You have found your way to joy. Even if you lose a loved one, &gt;&gt; you know that there's coming a time where you'll be reunited in the Lord. &gt;&gt; You're you're not anchored here. &gt;&gt; Your life ain't here. We're not of this world. &gt;&gt; This isn't the greatest economy ever. God is the greatest economy ever. &gt;&gt; The money in the bank ain't going to save you. The bank will close. There's no rest. That's why the world's under so much pressure. That's why they get so infuriated with the way somebody thinks that they lash out, they speak out, they speak hatred, they they speak all those things. I I'm not going to get into that battle. I have another place of refuge. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the rock of ages. &gt;&gt; It's the cliff of the rock. &gt;&gt; Yes. We see. We see that young people the joy of the Lord is when you see for yourself that Jesus loves you. &gt;&gt; That he knows the battles you go through. He knows the mind battles. He knows that Satan is working against you. And if you could find that place where you get alone with him &gt;&gt; and you just talk to him, &gt;&gt; you will know and feel his presence &gt;&gt; come around you and speak to you and say, "I've got you. I have you in the palm of my hand &gt;&gt; and nothing will pluck you out. &gt;&gt; Lo, I am with you always, &gt;&gt; even in you till the end. &gt;&gt; But it's only when you desire that peace. It's only when you you can look out and you can see this world and you don't see a future in it. You know why you don't see a future in it? There's no future in it. &gt;&gt; I'm 75 years old. I guess according to if if we live a real modest life, uh we can live on our social security and what little bit we've got saved up and I can live till I die. Wow, what a life. Deary, we can go to Cracker Barrel a couple times a week and we can have coffee at McDonald's and and maybe you could get a burrito and I could get a a sausage McMuffin and then we could go home and you can tinker in the garden and I can tinker in the garage and and we can sit around till we Hi. Hallelujah. Uhuh. I'm looking for the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Grave, where's your victory? Death, wears your sting. &gt;&gt; I've ran a race. I've fought a fight. I'm going for a crown. &gt;&gt; I I I I I've experienced him coming to to me in a very dark valley when I was on the edge of of of ending my life, &gt;&gt; trapped in drugs, trapped with demons, &gt;&gt; trapped in in in an incredibly lost &gt;&gt; place. No vision, no life, no future, no nothing. And he came. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; And he told me, I'm the life. &gt;&gt; I am the way out. &gt;&gt; That's right. I believe it. &gt;&gt; I am the way out of these things. Jesus Christ is the way out. &gt;&gt; It was those people that found that way out. They had that personal experience. &gt;&gt; That was who he used to evangelize. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the doctrine that evangelized. It wasn't the teachings that evangelized. It wasn't the church that evangelized. It was the experience that evangelized. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you realize what you really are &gt;&gt; and you see that he loved you anyway and you see it, you know it, it becomes a reality to you. That's what you share. You can't even begin to share Malachi 4:5 and Luke 17:30. You might as well just share George Washington because it's both true history. But this is something that's real. &gt;&gt; We see it. Yes, we see. We know that's real. No matter what trials come, we know it's real. &gt;&gt; But there's there's there is a way out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's Christ. Now, the Christian should not be in that condition. In other words, worried and stressed out, wondering about the future. He should not be in that condition. We should be happy waiting for the coming &gt;&gt; for it's close. That's our hope. That's our joy. &gt;&gt; That's our victory. I don't need to get my truck paid off. my house paid off. I need to make the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't need to have a lot of money in the bank. I need to know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Jesus I met will take care of every single one of my needs. I'm not worried. I'm happy that he loves me. &gt;&gt; I'm happy that I have met him. I know he's real. I've experienced his forgiveness. I've experienced his touch. That's what we're trying to get to each individual. It's not it doesn't it it comes with emotion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But that emotion is built on a forgiveness, &gt;&gt; on a meeting, &gt;&gt; on a revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that I'm in the palm of his hand and nothing can pluck me out. &gt;&gt; And if he started a work in me, he'll finish it till the end. That's what we want. We just don't want you to feel something. We want you to know something. &gt;&gt; And if that knowledge brings you to a feeling, hallelujah. But we should all know it. Listen to what it is. To the church. We should be happy waiting for his coming for its close. We can feel the cool breeze of Calvary. My sins are forgiven. That's not laid to my charge. I make mistakes, but if I confess him, he's faithful and just to forgive him. I know I'm his. I know he died for me. I know he won't leave me nor forsake me. It's a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus. It doesn't matter how that is expressed in somebody else. Some may shout, "Praise God." Some may cry, praise God. Like Paul was sharing with us the other day, when they rebuilt the temple and they brought the books out and they begin to read them to Israel for the first time. The people that were just seeing it for the first time, they shouted &gt;&gt; with praise. And the oldtimers that had seen its destruction, they wept. Here you got all the old-timers weeping because they seen what God's done. &gt;&gt; Here's the people that never seen it before, seeing it for the first time. and they're shouting. &gt;&gt; And the scripture says that those are far off, they were they didn't know what was going on. They were confused because half the people were crying and half the people were shouting. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't care shout or weep, &gt;&gt; but see &gt;&gt; that was the point. know that he's forgiven you, &gt;&gt; that he'll love you. &gt;&gt; The best, what do they best match maker in the world is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He'll find somebody for you. &gt;&gt; And if he finds somebody for you and you don't like them, God will fix it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He'll either change you or change them. But if God's in it, God's going to do it. &gt;&gt; You don't have to worry. I don't care what's behind you. You can't live with your mistakes forever. You've got to let them go and know that he'll take you from where that you are. &gt;&gt; Now listen to what we just said. He says, "And when we and when we look down and see the God of heaven who made the promise and the when we see When we look down, when we see the God of heaven who made the promise and the very things that Jesus did in his life, promised would return in the last days. &gt;&gt; And here we see it. We see it. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? It's not. The church is built on revelation. &gt;&gt; It's built on men and women and young ladies and young men who see it. &gt;&gt; They see the coming of the Lord. They see the destruction of the world. They see the gift at Calvary. How do you see? You get Isab. He lets you see it, but you see it. You know it. You've met him. He says the promise of his return in the last day. What is that? You see it? You It's paragraph 46 out of end time evangel. I don't are things not working right. I know mine was all but it says what is that? When we see his return in the last days, we see it in his word. What is that? That's the breath of the refreshing like the rain coming. We know redemption is nigh. See, something is fixing to take place. And the world doesn't see that. They laugh at it because they did it in other days. But we know that it's coming near. And that's the reason I chose the subject today for the last for a while the tabernacle of end time evangel. And when we are doing missionary work or foreign missions with the word of God, we know we're always in the will of God because Jesus commissioned his children was to go into all the world and preach the gospel. Freely it was given freely give. Is that correct? &gt;&gt; Now so what are we talking about? We're talking about end time evangelism. End time evangelism begins with the individual coming to the knowledge and seeing that Jesus Christ paid their price for them and their sins are forgiven. That the nature that caused them to sin is no longer laid to their charge. Something made you sin. Is that right? It was a nature that you got. You were born with it. You were born in unbelief. You were born in sin. You came into the world speaking lies. that that that that was where you're at. And the wages of that is death, right? But now the Lord comes, he dies on Calvary, he pays the price for that sin, and he gives you the gift of eternal life. Will you die? Oh, this body will die. But we're not worried about the first death. We're worried about the second death. Eternal separation from God. So, we know that he desire it. We see it. He reveals that to us. It becomes real to us. We understand that he's forgiven us of our sins. And we stay there. We lay ourselves prostrate and we die to that nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until his spirit comes in us. Will Satan try to resurrect that nature? Yes. That's a battle. &gt;&gt; We're in that battle. Do we stumble sometimes? Yes. But we know we can repent and he's faithful and just to forgive us and we return back. So we know that what it is we see his spirit working. And so he says he says now he says you must be born again. Let me read this again. In order to be born again, it's letting yourself go and die. And the spirit of Christ comes in you. Then you're no more yours. It's Christ in you. See, the Holy Spirit, Paul said, "I die daily yet I live. Not I, but Christ liveth in me. See Christ. I tell you, I'm a Christian and the spirit of Christ is in me or in you, then we do the works of Christ. Jesus said in John, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also. Then he said here, "These signs shall follow them that believe." &gt;&gt; So where does it start? It starts with the spirit of God convicting you of sin. &gt;&gt; You can't get around that. &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Spirit does. He convicts you of sin. You're living your life. You're happy. You're good. I was happy. I had long hair. I was hanging out with all kinds of real famous rock musicians, you know? I had a big old blunt, you know what I mean? And man, I was happy. I was what we used to call righteous &gt;&gt; and cool. And then something interrupted my life. &gt;&gt; I didn't want it to interrupt my life. I mean, it started interrupting my life. It started convicting me. And the more it convicted me, the more I tried to smoke it away &gt;&gt; or drink it away or play enough music to make it go away. You know, if he start bugging you, what do you do? You run to the cooler, you get a six-pack, and if that six-pack won't do it, you buy a 12-pack. If the 12-pack won't do it, you get a 24p pack. If a bottle of wine won't do it, you get a gallon of wine. &gt;&gt; You're trying to find anything. Make this conviction go away. &gt;&gt; But you know what that conviction's doing? It's trying to kill you. &gt;&gt; It's trying to make you to the place you don't want to be what you are. I don't want to be this way no more. I don't want to feel this way no more. This is ugly. &gt;&gt; What is it? is the conviction trying to bring you to the place that you lay prostrate before the Lord and you let yourself go and he comes in. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother McGary, I want the baptism of the Holy Spirit." There is no baptism of the Holy Spirit without death. &gt;&gt; We can preach till the presence of the Lord fills this room. You can sit there and watch person and miracle and miracle transpire. You can feel his presence till it tingles up and down and the hair raises on your neck. And you might cry out in your heart, I want that. I want that in me. And I as a minister might sit there and say, I want you to feel that. I want you to experience that. But there's no atmosphere that I can produce that will bypass death. &gt;&gt; That is thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; You can't get away from it. &gt;&gt; You'll never get it till you want it. And you'll never want it till the Holy Spirit makes your life miserable without it. &gt;&gt; And it's in his hands. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the law. It's the gospel. &gt;&gt; I want you to be happy. I want you to shout, but I don't want the shout from come from the outside. &gt;&gt; I want the shout to come from the inside. &gt;&gt; I want you to know what I'm shouting about. I don't want the music to create the shout. I want God to create it. and you sit in your room, you sit in your car, you sit alone in those lonely places and your mind works. That's when you talk to him. That's when you say, "Lord, what what am I going to do? What what do I do for a living? What's my life going to be like? Where am I going?" You have all these great questions. And if you just turn for a moment and talk to him, you feel his presence because the Bible said he won't turn you away in no wise. If you're sick and you just sit back, you say, "Lord, I'm sick." Why do you want to get get healed? To prove God's a healer. God don't need to prove he's a healer by making you well. &gt;&gt; You got to have a reason. I want to be well so I can be a better wife. I want to be well so I can testify. I want to be well so I can do a work for you. &gt;&gt; We don't need to be well just to be well. &gt;&gt; We need to be sick so we can get well. &gt;&gt; I hope that wasn't misunderstood. But that's what it is. That's what the church was built on. It was built on individuals experiencing the presence of the Lord, him in them, and the love of God in their heart going out and saying, "What He's done for me, he can do for you. It's important. And I preached a sermon. I said, "You've got to have confidence and faith in your death." &gt;&gt; Well, maybe I got that before the cart, but you want to get farther in the Lord. You want to get a refilling of the spirit. You want to have a revival in your heart, &gt;&gt; die to something, &gt;&gt; sacrifice something, &gt;&gt; give up something. &gt;&gt; But there's no circumventing death for the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Being born again means you let go, you die, and he comes into you and replaces your old nature with his nature. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If the spirit of Don of John Dillinger was in you who was a gangster, you would have guns. If a spirit of something else, a painter was in you, you would paint. If the spirit of Christ was in you, you do the works of Christ. Look at your works. Look at yourself in the mirror. Look at what you say. Look at what you do. Look at where you go. And if you see the world and you want to be different, ask him, "Lord, I want to overcome. I want to be different. I'm sorry that my nature causes me to act like this. I want a different nature. I want the joy of the Lord in my heart. I want love in my heart. &gt;&gt; You know, the world today has got everybody looking at their fleshly body. People aren't happy because they're big. Other people aren't happy because they're skinny. I'm not happy because I got a big nose and I'm fat and I'm bald and I, you know, &gt;&gt; give it up. &gt;&gt; What happens if we all get to heaven and we're all gigantic? Wouldn't that be just a whole heartbreak? Don't starve yourself spiritually over your flesh. &gt;&gt; God don't look at that. God looks at your heart. &gt;&gt; And that's what it means to be born again. That's what it means to have the Holy Spirit. I've died and he has come into me and he's living in me and I'm going to treat everybody around me the way he taught me to treat him. I'm going to live the life day by day. Now, evangelism is beginning because the world is seeing your light shining. &gt;&gt; I've kept you a long time this morning, but I just have to get this off my heart. They see your light shining. They know there's something in you that they don't have &gt;&gt; and you know where they can get it. because they're going to find it the same place you found it. And when they're willing to die and they're willing to change and they're willing to want to be different and you're willing to pray with them and you're not ashamed of this gospel and you'll kneel down with them wherever they are. You can lead them to the Lord Jesus Christ and the Lord Jesus Christ will come into their heart and they'll be born again. And then as they grow in the Lord, the leadership of the Lord will grow in their lives. The spirit moving on them will grow in their lives. Their lives will worship. they'll be what God wants them to be. The beginning of evangelism starts here. &gt;&gt; The fruits of evangelism is here. So we have to be living as a body, ministering one to another, visiting our sick, taking the burdens, getting involved, letting the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. And then we take our experience and we let our light so shine amongst men that our good works might glorify the father in heaven. You can't look back at your life and say, "I'm going to fix this and I'm going to fix that." All you have to do is stop and say, "Lord, whatever caused me to do those things, I'm asking you to take it out of my life. I'm willing to lay it down. I'm willing to die. And as he grows, your light will shine." And I'd like to close with this. Listen to this closely. This is paragraph 85 out of end time evangelism. And today the scientific theory of the modern so-called religious group has tried to prove that this blessed thing we have called the Holy Spirit is only emotion. That's what they say. It's just emotion. But listen close now. See, it just don't stand up according to their science theories. Well, I would like to ask them this. What makes them change? This blessed thing we call the Holy Spirit is not measured by the emotion. It's measured by the &gt;&gt; change. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now listen what he says really close. He says he says, "Well, I would ask them this. What makes them change? What makes the drunkard stop drinking? What makes the prostitute cease her evil life? What makes the cancer and the disease depart from the people &gt;&gt; and the deaf and dumb and blind and dead to raise? Explain that. Is that emotion? It has emotion with it. Certainly. Certainly &gt;&gt; if someone gets delivered, I'm happy. &gt;&gt; I praise God. &gt;&gt; That excites me. &gt;&gt; But the question wasn't the emotion. It was the change. &gt;&gt; That's right. What made me change from a long-haired drug addict to giving my life to Christ and going preaching on the street? &gt;&gt; You explain that to me &gt;&gt; because I can't explain it. &gt;&gt; I can't explain how he found me. I can't explain why he found me. I can't explain what he wanted to do with me when he started with me way back then. You think I ever saw a building? No, I didn't want I don't want nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; I hated people. &gt;&gt; I'd get up at 4:00 in the afternoon, stay up all night, and go to bed at 4:00 in the morning. Well, it have nothing to do with the sun. But one day, the sen &gt;&gt; decided &gt;&gt; it was his turn &gt;&gt; to have me &gt;&gt; and he plucked me &gt;&gt; out of the greasy, slimy hands of the enemy. You say, "How did he do it?" He made me so miserable &gt;&gt; that I cried out. And when I cried, he answered. &gt;&gt; You know you'll have it when you know you've changed. &gt;&gt; If you want to change and you're willing to die, lay yourself down and let his spirit come in you. You will experience what it's like to be born again and have a new nature. And then the works of the Lord as you mature will follow you. As you're faithful and little, you'll become faithful in much. &gt;&gt; Anything that's alive has emotions and anything that doesn't have emotions is dead. Excuse the expression, but I think we ought to bury some of our emotionalist religion then because it's dead. It has no emotion to it. Any religion that has not emotion should be buried because it's emotional. Jesus when he entered the city he the children all of them all of his friends cried hosana him that cometh in the name of the Lord and those religious of that day couldn't stand it was too emotional he said if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out something must cry out because there's life in there. You understand? If the life is in there, the emotions follow. The emotion doesn't bring the life. Death brings the life. Resurrection brings the emotion. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then we could go into uh but we'll leave it there. So what is evangelism? It's people who've experienced a change and they let the world know that Christ, our Lord and Savior Jesus &gt;&gt; can give you the change. And the change brings joymen, &gt;&gt; peace, longsuffering, strength. It does something for you. &gt;&gt; It sets your heart on fire. You say, "Why does Satan keep after me?" Because he's an unbeliever, &gt;&gt; but you're a believer. &gt;&gt; And your faith overcomes the world. The musicians we come. So I hope just to sum it up this morning to evangelize we have to have an experience. To bring the fruits of evangelism we have to have a storehouse. that's functioning as Christians. When we can get those things working together, a body ministering one to another, and our light shining in the world, proving that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. We will see signs and wonders like we've never seen before. We don't want to get ahead of God, but I believe this time and the season. Everything in the church was based on the commission. It wasn't based on the upper room. It was based on what took place. They were commissioned. Is that correct? They went and got the power to carry out the commission. And the church is based on commission. Signs and wonders. The movement of the spirit is based on the church fulfilling the commission. Not calling the blessing, but fulfilling the commission. And the blessing comes when the commission is fulfilled. I hope I'm understood. &gt;&gt; I hope I've never caused any trouble or confusion about emotion or about blessing. But when things are done in order, &gt;&gt; yes sir, &gt;&gt; God moves in a mighty way. Let's we stand together. Maybe I just ask this question to you this morning. In your own heart, honestly, do you feel you could live closer to God? You don't have to raise your hand. You don't have to do anything, but just be honest with your heart. Is the coming of the Lord a breath of fresh air to you? Is it your hope? Is it your comfort? For Paul said, if the if we have not the hope of this coming, then we of all people are most miserable. But it's the breath of fresh air. He's coming for me. I'm living for him. and I'm going to live like him and be like him. And if there's parts of your life today, like there are in mine that are not like him, I raise my hand today and I say, "Lord Jesus, you promised the Holy Spirit would lead and guide me into all truth and righteousness." I raised my hand this morning asking that that spirit would come to my life. It would guide me and it would work with me. Lord, I preached for an hour or more this morning and I know the people are weary and but Lord, I ask that you just touch their heart way deep down inside. And Father, and our young people that they can say, "Yes, we see. I see Malachi 4:5. I see this prophet messenger that my parents and brother McGary and the people talk about. I see it for myself. [Music] Lord, I I know you're real, Jesus, cuz I've talked to you and you came by and visited me. I know it's real. I know you're real in my life. And father, if there's any that have doubt of your love for them, I pray that you would just come by and whisper to their heart and give them eyes that they could see that they might know you. Father, and those that have been walking this journey for a long time, may we become more Christlike. May we display the virtues and the joy and the love. May we have good works that would glorify our father in heaven. Lord, I ask you to forgive me of all my shortcomings. Lord, we want the joy and we don't want a dead religion. We want to have the emotion that's caused by your presence. I just ask that you grant it to every heart and hand that's raised. Every person in here that wants more of you, Lord, that loves you and loves your word. Father, those that have not experienced you and your presence. Father, I pray you make yourself known that you would deal with their heart in such a special and wonderful way. Oh, the fresh breeze of Calvary. Amen. On a hill far away, [Music] Does that mean something to you? [Music] Oh, the world of our shers must. Oh, are you going to cling to it? Let them know.

But, you know, I have kind of a similar testimony as brother David. But I I stand here today as a miracle &gt;&gt; and and I believe that with all my heart. &gt;&gt; God's grace is sufficient. &gt;&gt; Let's just pray. &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father, Lord, we so thank you Lord for the life you give us, Lord. the blood you shed for us, Lord. So many times, Lord, we falter and fall, Lord. And you're always there to catch us, Lord. Lord, you lift us up. You strengthen us, Lord. You give us new life each day, Lord.
