Description:
[57-0419] The Perfection
Tape - Br. William Marion Branham
May 10, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

ask that you'd bless us tonight we pray in your precious and holy name amen you know tonight um I was really enjoyed Sunday evening service and uh David Jr brought to us out of Galatians you know and the great thing that you know we started in the spirit now are we perfected by the flesh and uh I was led to this tape that brother Branham preached and and I I listened to it and and then I listened to it again and again I just felt in my heart uh I just never had Satan fight me so bad on playing a tape and then I realized why because this is the foundation of every Christian experience as you listen to brother Brandon preach he said that God provided a way and there's only one provided place of worship so we're going to listen to one hour of the message called perfection it is it is ABC's if I could say it this way at its best it is the description and the foundation of every real Christian experience prophet of God said that people end up wrong because they don't start out right you've got to start here in this tape tonight as you listen to it this is the starting place of of every Christian experience every Christian Journey everything that's laid out before us that we're going to come to go through all has to be tied back to what is being taught here I believe it'll be a blessing to you there's no no discernment in it that uh it's very it's a teaching tape it's real straightforward it's scripturally anchored and I believe that it'll be a real blessing if you take the time to listen to what's being said so we're just going to have the Brother start it they're going to start playing it at the scripture and then the minute the prophet of God's done reading the scripture uh you may be seated uh and uh I I believe that he's going to start in the Book of Matthew the fourth chapter and the 47th and 48th verse so Lord bless you uh the words true amen the words true I I really hope that you take this to heart this evening um um I'm I'm trusting the Lord that my brother Dennis will be with us this coming weekend to preach for us I was going to preach tonight but this was so heavy on my heart I thought I've just got to play this so I know you love your messenger uh this is perfection 1957. Lord bless you tonight as you listen to the word of Truth tonight that we are celebrating of the crucifixion of our blessed Lord I wish to read the night from his own precious lips the words that he has had written in his book in Saint Matthews the fourth chapter we and the 47th and 48th verse we read this and it's you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the public and soul but be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect and tonight we gave out that we were going to speak on the subject of perfection now we that seems like a very strange text to take for the night of the crucifixion of Our Lord but today perhaps you've been listening to the radio and hear the different messages and The Messengers how they presented that great awful day when our Lord died for the sins of the world so I have chosen tonight to go around a different way to get to it so it would be a little different and might refreshing you a little and may the Blessed Holy Spirit Inspire the word now as we take the effort to bring it God requires Perfection we want to bear that in mind that there's nothing just part way can go in the presence of God it must be perfect or worship everything I am in the Garden of Eden God had Adam and Eve in the garden and they sinned and transgressed the laws of God by sinning disobedience and when transgression comes disobedience is the transgression of the law and the law of God him being holy just unadulterated holy therefore no spot of unholiness can ever stand in his presence so if sin came in the world by transgression then sin must be dealt with before the sinner can ever stand in the presence of God now if there is no law then there is no justice but law require Justice requires a law and the law when it is it is uh recalled on IT projects Justice now by the law no flesh is saved now the law cannot save us the law was just the thing that put us in jail but it has no redeeming power the law only showed us that we were Sinners and condemned us that's what law is to do it's the brain condemnation or to show you where your mistake is so the law in itself could not save It could only prosecute and God being holy and just he had to have a prosecution he had to prosecute The Sinner because he had overstepped the bounties of Grace and had become a law breaking citizen then he must be dealt with and the every law has a penalty for the penalty of transgressing God's law is death and it had to project death to the human race and all of the human races under the penalty of this law now when Adam and Eve had sinned there was no way no other remedy that they could ever stand in the presence of God again except this sin be dealt with and no man can commit a sin of any type no matter how little or how big that individual sin has to be dealt with before the one who committed it can ever stand in the presence of the holy God so therefore when Adam and Eve had sinned and it transgressed the law they were subjects of death and the law had to be executed therefore it put all the human race under the penalty of death now if we can only settle down for a few moments now in our thinking and look at this great picture and remember that every person here is included in this every man and woman child is included in the penalty of death by the transgression of the head of the human race Adam by his transgression every one of us fell victim to sin and sin must be dealt with and so God in his great infancy and his great love the law was to separate The Sinner from his maker then he become annihilated I am totally annihilated there would be no way for him to ever come back unless that sin was dealt with and it would be very easy then to believe in a total annihilation of The Sinner at the end for he is completely forever separated from the presence of God now notice this sin and how God being just and he could do nothing else but be just for he is the resource of all Justice then there would be nothing else for him to do but to place the penalty for this transgression and the penalty was death for he said the day you eat thereof that day thou shall surely die now it's a dark picture we have here but then if we go back just a little further and find out the very attributes of God the Bible plainly tells us that God is love but yet being love he has to be just so love does not mean just the thing that can be petted and played with love is the justice of God now when God seen that his children have transgressed his law and that they must die the death then Sovereign Love stepped in to make a way for God seen that these children was to be absolutely totally annihilated from his presence there was nothing else to be done for their transgressed his law and the penalty of his law was death planet and then love of God went out for his subjects and when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace produces the object of the love and God by foreknowledge when he loved his race so well yet with the penalty he caused the subductionary death to take place in the Garden of Eden that was he substituted an innocent creature a Little Lamb that no no sin and it went for a substitute to work and to die in the stead of the guilty sinner and it was a lamb slain to hold the life of his subjects all through the Old Testament they offered the blood of lambs and goats sheep bulls and Heifers a substitutionary death but all in the great economy of God there was back in his mind the real object coming which would be them were Shadows of the real object that was to come I am the real object was to come was his only begotten son all the Lambs that died was only a shadow and a shadow is only the negative side of an object and they only spoke of Calvary coming now for a picture of this let's turn in our Bibles through the book of Hebrews and pick up your what Paul the great Apostle speaking trying to separate these things for us in the 10th chapter of the book of Hebrews we read this and I just love the word amen the word is the truth amen and I like to read it before my congregation because I know that in the Judgment I'll stand with them now I've got to give an account so if I bring it from the word then I'll not be guilty because it's the word and God's responsible for his word we see so much today of evangelists and so forth filling up around personalities oh it's a disgraceful thing and we find out in going into churches we go into church and you find a certain Pastor he's got some little peculiar act about him some little emotion if you don't notice the entire congregation will take that spirit if he's just a little emotional or jerks his head or some little odd thing well the whole church will take on to that and we've got today in our modern church is the word it's Sensations and little things like that and it's got such a confusion but oh my beloved Brethren if there ever was a time that we ought to be on the word it's today [Applause] you see I would hate to stand at the judgment and know that I had some little ficklish something of a loose peculiar Revelation and misled people I don't want them to have him my spirit all my action but I want them to have God's spirit by God's word that produces truth so on this great occasion tonight I would like to read from God's Eternal Word now we realize that the law existed for many years but the law could never take away sin as I have said in the past it was just a jailhouse it was the great detective that told you what you had done but had no remedy to deliver you it puts you in the pawn shop but there was no Redeemer to take you out with it it only prisons you to let you know that you was a sinner but now notice in Hebrews the 10th chapter as we read for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image remember it was a shadow of an image to come a shadow only introduces that there is a image making the shadow a shadow of the things to come and not the very image notice all the things the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which were offered continually make the calmer unto perfect now God in the beginning required Perfection man Jesus when he come to Earth said be ye perfect like God in heaven is perfect and the law having a shadow of things to come could never make the worshiper perfect you got the picture now let's go it again so you'll be sure not to miss it God requires perfect holiness [Music] no one can stand in His image with one little speck of sand I am not Jesus witnessed the same and said be perfect just like God in heaven is perfect and the Bible said that the law could never with its sacrifices make the calmer perfect then the law could not perfect anything it was only a pointer these sacrifices made every year could never make the worshiper perfect so therefore no one under the law are keeping of laws are under the shadows could be perfect four second verse then would they not have ceased to been offered if there is anything that I can do to make myself perfect in the presence of God then Christ did not have to die for me yeah if there's one thing that you can do that would Merit anything in the presence of God then Christ died in vain no law keeping no legalistic ideas of yours none of your own holiness no things that you could quit doing quit lying quit stealing quit smoking tobacco quit going to the picture shows still you are lost nothing can do it joining churches rituals ceremonies baptisms orders of the church reading of Creeds saying of prayers all those things would count nothing you are lost not one thing can you do in yourself for you are a sinner under condemnation and there's not no way within yourself or any Creed or any pain that you could do or think of of yourself that could Merit one thing in the presence of God because you are a sinner to start with and the Bible declares that we were all born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking love and God could not take one man to die for the other because one is just as guilty as the other in the presence of God the Archbishop born in this world was as guilty as the lowest Barfly in the city amen 110 not atone for the other therefore he took an innocent life of an animal a Little Lamb and under the Old Testament the law was when a man sinned he brought the lamb to the altar say if he transgressed any of The Commandments he brought the lamb and he laid it on the altar he laid his hands upon the land and he confessed these sins that he was wrong and know that he was guilty of and was the law required death and he brought the lamb and instead and when he the throat of the little animal was cut and it's beginning to kick its little feet and blading if you've ever seen a lamb slaughtered what a pitiful cry the poor little fellow trying to blame and his little jumper veins cut and as he kicked and squivers and as he straightens out then Quivers again and breaks in the blood gushes it bases little wool and the worshiper's hands and as the worshiper realizing for committing adultery for lying stealing whatever is guilt laws or even evil thinking whatever it was in the least Shadow he was guilty because it was his nature he was a guilty person not maybe by the Czar but by Nature he was guilty and he had to recognize that this innocent little lamb died in his place and he felt sorry for the little thing but the man as soon as the lamb finally died with the blood of the Lamb upon his hands he walked from the building with the same desire in his heart that he had at the beginning wow because the light that was in the little lamb light lays in the blood your life is in your blood we know that and the life in the blood of the Lamb was animal life therefore when it's little car puzzles were broken and the life went out of the animal it could not come back to the worshiper because the worshiper was a human being the blood made a covering but it could not perfectly atone for the man left the building with the same desire to sin as he had in the first place but doing this he was looking forward to a time when there would be a perfect lamb comes and he did it on the burnt offering because it was the only way he knew about so you see when the blood was pouring and the life went from the animals it could not come back to the man for one was animal one was man an innocent animal to a guilty man but oh one day some 2 000 years ago the Lamb of God was born down in a little manger in Bethlehem and was led like a sheep to its Slaughter some 1900 years ago this afternoon at three o'clock he died this apocalypse blemish Lamb of God hung on calories Crossing died forever sinner amen now when the worshiper comes to this Lamb by faith and this is a different type of land amen it's not a lamb like the other no man can come to this lamb except God draws him first all right you seek God's sovereignty oh I hope this soaked way down deep down Emma look God knows he had sheep in this world he knowed he was going to have people to be saved and his love looked down and seen those who would be saved therefore by for knowledge he predestinated a church to meet him at her without spot or random [Applause] and if God required a church without spot or ankle he had to have something to make it that way he could not require it his Justice his judgments could not let him ask such a thing if there wasn't a way to make it forever and men cannot do it in himself he's a total failure God let him see that through the law to the judges and through all the Old Testament he sent the prophets he sent the righteous man and they found out that everyone failed amen so God by his Sovereign Grace sent from the portals of Glory his only begotten son I'm gonna take our place remember if he'd have said for the pope of Rome to take it he could not have done it amen if it has set for the Archbishop of Canterbury to do it he could not have done it amen if he would have called on the most holy Reverend father or Bishop of the world he could not have done it he had been just as far rejected as Judas is character amen he could not do it do it because he was born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and needed atonement for himself amen Hallelujah [Music] but there came one from the portals of Glory yeah none other not a man not a good man neither a tune or a gentile he was nothing less than almighty God hidden human flesh he came himself to offer his own blood for it did not come to sex sex had nothing to do with it but he overshadowed a virgin and brought forth from a blood cell that he created himself [Applause] [Music] the innocent one then my salvation yours tonight does not hinge upon the merits of our own actions it ends up on the positive poverty Grace hello almighty God who has chosen [Music] certainly I could never be perfect nor you could never be perfect and we'd all claim to be perfect but we have this one consolation that our faith rests in a perfect sacrifice has already been received [Music] then how do we know that we get that when the worshiper puts his hands by faith upon the body of the Lord Jesus and feels the pair of sin and the mark of spit in his own face feels the groanings of Gethsemane the agonies of calorie and knows that he's guilty and confesses his sins correctly oh blessed Lord I am guilty and I have no other way but you to help me and by faith you're bidding the Holy Spirit has come and bits become and I'm now by faith except Jesus as my personal savior am I that life that come from him on Calvary called the Holy Ghost which was hid in the blood cell of the Lord Jesus returns to the worshiper and baptizes him with the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ amen and he's already judged amen you don't have to worry about judgment as I turn and look at that little crucifix I realize that that is represents his body and now that body has already been judged God take justly judge it again for it's already judged amen God's structured judgments of death upon that body and as long as I can find a way to get hit in that body [Applause] judgment was stuck for me and for you we are free Romans 8 1 said there is therefore now no condemnation that them that are in Christ Jesus that walk not into the flesh but there you are no condemnation I don't care what comes or what goes you are HID beneath the blood yeah again how do we get into that body First Corinthians 12 13. says that by one spirit how does the Spirit come through the sacrifice where did the spirit lay within the blood why couldn't the animal come back it was an animal the animal spirit could not come to the human spirit and do anything to it because the human Spirit was a higher line of life than the animal but no other man's Spirit could come back if you've got the spirit of some ancestor it's spiritualism but God himself came that his own Spirit which is the highest line of spirit there is can come back by the form of the baptism of the Holy Spirit to the worshiper to the blood of Christ and take him into the body ever be safe watch the blood of bulls and goats would not work see it was weak now let's start reading about the 12th verse all right the blood of bulls and goats cannot work neither could it atone watch but this man what man the bishop know the pope no but this man after he offered one sacrifice for sin forever sat down at the right hand of God Amen from his fourth expectant though his enemies be made his footstool are you ready are you ready for the word listen to this they don't want you to let it sink down listen closely far by one offering not year by year not Revival at your Revival not meeting after meeting not day after day but by one offering he has p-e-r-f-e-c-t-e-d ee they have he has by one offering he has perfected that's God's requirement forever then that are sanctified there you are that's the answer to the death of Christ that's the answer to Calvary he absolutely with his own blood purchased our sins and perfected forever his Believers therefore in Christ We Stand blameless thank you in the presence of God Almighty amen amen we are underprivileged people with our own doctrines we are being taught that we have to get up to a certain place we have to do a certain thing no my brother it's nothing you've done it's what God did for you we are now if we are justified by faith we are perfected forever in the presence of God then Jesus said be therefore perfect then it was perfected forever God do the death of Christ 1900 years ago today perfected the believer that he foresaw before the foundation world forever and those who he has called he has Justified those who he foreknew he has called those who he has called he has Justified those who he has Justified he hath already glorified he has perfected his Believers now watch this go back now to the first verse the law having a shed of good things to come and not the very image of those things can never with those sacrifices which were offered year by year continue make the calmer unto perfect what's Perfect's what we're talking about for then they should not have ceased to be offered because that the worshiper once purged would have no more conscience of sin what do you mean the word conscience there and right interpretation is desire and if a man comes to worship her correctly before Christ seeing his suffering and he offers himself to Christ and says oh Lord God there's nothing in me that can atone but I'm holy depending on you then that Holy Spirit comes into the human heart the very sin questions settle forever forever desire sin has been taken from you for if the law could have done that then sacrifices will not have deceased but being that it could not do it Christ had to die to make us perfect friends there is so many things that we could say tonight about the profession we are always trying to gouge the eyes out of somebody else to make ourselves just a little holier than they are they are but if we only looked at the picture it's only God's grace that we are what we are [Music] I learned a lesson a hard way I was having a meeting down in Ohio and I was staying out in the country because of the masses I cannot stay in the city we've been eating out a little dunkard restaurant and such lovely little waitresses and decently dressed and clean as they could be very ladylike waited on us it was a little spot of Heaven so eating such a place their kitchen was and span and on Sunday they closed up and they went to their Church I got a little hungry let's go to preach Sunday afternoon and I went over to an ordinary little just the common Little American restaurant to get something to eat and when I walked in the door what did I hear but a slot machine going and was standing there a man of my age which perhaps was a married man with his arm around a woman playing a slot machine are very low the protection of our righteousness of our Goods we're standing there violating a thing that he is supposed to be protected because it's illegal to gamble in Ohio playing a slot machine and I turned and looked towards the back of the building there was a bunch of teenage boys in an old rock and roll records on the machine plane a young lady of about 18 years old very neatly uh underneath as a woman but she was standing there with her dress hanging low in the front and one of those boys with his hands on the girl where they did not belong and they were smoking and drinking and I thought oh God how can you stand it and I looked over to my right when I heard someone make out a big groan and there said an age woman probably 60 years or 70 years old she had on those little old vulgar clothes just about halfway upper limbs and her poor old wrinkled flesh was just as flabby as it could be and she had on this shirt lip makeup and a great big purple thing on the side of her face painted a little pair of shoes on sandals with purple toenails painted purple fingernails painted and her hair was cut real sharp and curled up and dyed blue and I looked at her and across the table set to man drunk one of them it was summertime with a big old army over coat on with a gray scarf wrapped around his neck and if whiskers all over his face up belching and going on and they excuse herself the man did from her and started walking out like this to the restroom I stood there and I said God why don't you destroy the whole thing why don't you just sink it beneath the Earth I said is my little Sarah and Rebecca going to have to grow up under such stuff is that I said how can you God in your great Holiness ever stand to look at such a thing like that and not send an earthquake and sink it as I was standing there condemning the woman as I was I stepped back behind the door I felt the spirit of God come to me and I stepped behind the door and I seen like something twirling and when it was in the vision it was a world turning around and around and as a notice around the world was a Scarlet Street around the world and as I got to the world I seen myself just a little boy doing things that I ought not to do maybe not like that but it was sin and every time I did anything I seen that great black shadow go towards heaven which God would have killed me at that minute there are seen standing between me and God stood that perfect sacrifice I see him standing there with the thorns on his head in the spit hanging on his face and every time my sins would start towards God he'd reach out and catch it like the bumper on the car he was protecting me from death and every time I'd do anything wrong God would have killed me certainly his Holiness requires it his law requires it and every time I'd do anything or you do anything the blood of Jesus Christ acts like a bumper and I've seen that Scarlet streak meant that then that the blood still holds the Earth and as I stood looking I got a little closer to him as I noticed him now I can hear him say father forgive him he doesn't know what he's doing and I looked down in their laid a book and there's a recording Angel there in standing by his side and every time I sinned it was put out on the book and my name was on it and I realized that someday uh that blood streak would be lifted and I'd have to stand in the presence of God with my sinful life blasting by his Mercy he was holding off my judgment I went to him humbly I know on my knees and I said oh Jesus thou Son of God I am unworthy to come in your presence but will you please forgive me for what I have done he touched his side with his hand took the old book and wrote pardon on it voted back behind him and my sins were gone then he looked and he Stern in the face he said now I have forgiven you but you want to condemn her then our sin wanted and meant it as I come out of the vision I walked over to her I said how do you do she was drinking she looked up Batman she said oh hello I said could I sit down she said I have company I said I don't mean it in that way lady I just want to speak to you a minute she said be seated and I said lady just a few minutes ago standing there behind that door I begin to tell her as I begin to look the tears begin to run down her cheeks and she told me I said lady you don't mean to do these things Jesus died in the judgments of God is held off by his blood you don't mean to do this and she said no sir she said my father was a deacon in church I was raised in a Christian home my husband and I were charter members and live the Christian Life she began to tell me after his death she had two young girls and she went straight and how the girls had left her and she had told her life away and she thought there was no more hope for her [Music] no I said God be merciful those who he has four knew he has called amen she said are you Reverend Branham from Dad I said I am she said I'm ashamed of myself to be sitting here like this she said do you think there would be a chance for me I said Jesus has his arms stretched out waiting for you to come lady and the other people began to take up and I said would you walk out here in this floor with me she said I will sir I took her by the hand I said you're about the age of my mother would you kneel there with me the floor and there in the floor we broke up that place that afternoon to an Old-Fashioned meeting and God saved that woman by his grace am I she dressed herself and come to the meeting and as far as I know living a Christian Life tonight amen is it oh God breaks Perfection he requires your repentance he requires your loyalty to him but he's looking tonight no matter how much you sin how little or how much you are still a sinner and cannot get in no other way but by Jesus Christ God's all-sufficient sacrifice in any if you are perfected forever [Music] think of it it's not nothing you do it's not new pages you turn it's not a new life you start it's a confession of your wrong and God's grace to you that brings you to Perfection then you are perfected in Jesus Christ I trust tonight friend of mine while we are here at this great crucial moment now when decisions must be made after hearing this story you might have never heard it before but you can't go out one of those doors the same person you come in you must go out better or worse and while we bow our heads just a moment I want you to think mightily about it what about your soul tonight Jesus Christ died for you you say brother Brandon when I can get quit smoking when I can quit drinking when I can straighten this thing up I'll do it oh it will never be done right you'll never be able to do it why don't you just come the way you are and by faith go to that stream thy flowing wound Supply then redeeming love to be your theme and shall be till you die why take a substitute why try to get in by your church why try to come in because you quit drinking or quit lying come by the way of perfection for about one sacrifice he has perfected forever those that are Sanctified how do I get Sanctified confess your sins in the presence of the blood of Jesus and the right that come from that blood comes back to the worshiper and sanctifies him from the desires of the things of the world for about that all-sufficient sacrifice he had Sanctified us one Spirit we are all baptized into one body now there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus to them that walk not after the flesh but the spirit if you're trying to walk by the spirit and still lusting for the flesh the sacrifice hasn't been sufficiently applied to you but the worshiper once purged has no more desire of sin that was Calvary it isn't a place to sell flowers or a little place to do this or that it was a place where God and man were reconciled it was a place where peace and perfect safety was brought to mankind can you go with me tonight my sinner friend to Calvary and by faith apply this Blood to your own soul and let the Holy Ghost come and sanctify You by his great sacrifice before we pray would you raise your hand to God and say be merciful

this day henceforth will you raise your hand say remember me brother Brandon prayer that's the decision in my heart is there any this great night while we wait just a moment over your own my right hand side surely there's one along There Are you ashamed of your sins Are you ashamed of what you've done the world tonight is looking for Heroes [Music] and it has Heroes physically speaking one day honors Switzerland one Swiss Switzerland was at stake the little Swiss party had gathered out into the fields to defend defend their economy the great oncoming Army was too great for them they were all trained had big Spears as Shields the Swiss could do nothing but give up they were backed up against the mountain then there was a hero stepped out somebody had to die and if they lost the battle they had enough of those sickle blades and rocks sticks to fight with when the oncoming Army looked like a brick wall if they were taking their lovely little wives to be ravished their young girls would be ravished their babies would be killed their heads would be busted their homes would be gone everything would be lost then there was a man whose name is too quickly forgotten by the name of Arnold Von weeklord he stepped out and said man of Switzerland this day I give my life for Switzerland he said just over the mountain on earth is a little white home I've got a wife and three children waiting for me but they'll never see me again for this day I give my life for Switzerland they said what will you do Arnold Von weak Lord he said follow me and do the best you can with what you have to do with and he looked over the Army until he found the thickest of the spears then he stuck up his hands in the air he run towards that big brick wall of Spears and screaming Make Way for Liberty Make Way for our Liberty a hundred steers turned to catch his charge he threw his arms out and gripped them into his own bosom which pinned him down and he died on the end of those Spears those Swiss followed him with clubs and sticks that great display of heroism riding that Army to the Swiss beat him out of the land and they've never had a war from that day since stand up in Switzerland and name the name of Arnold Von wicklord you'll see tears running down their cheeks why he saved their land that was a great hero deed it's seldom compared with and never exceeded in this Earth but oh it was a little thing to what happened one day when Adam's race stood demons Marching In from every sign prophets had failed law had failed sacrifice of bulls and Lambs that failed man's nature had failed everything and Adam's little race stood defeated outnumbered by devils superstitions sickness diseases there was one step out in heaven and said this day I'll die for Adam's race he came to the Earth and was made flesh he looked like down where the midst of the spears was the darkest the very darkest of all man's dreads was death and he took death into his bosom and own Calvary he paid the sacrifice and screamed make a way for Liberty and he screams to his church take this which I have left you my blood and my spirit and fight whatever what you got we can conquer tonight to that friend
