just before brother Michael comes you know every year I just have like a theme in my heart and I thought these words that the Lord spoke and he said the people draw anion to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me and I I thought in my heart like James said he said draw an eye unto me and I'll draw an eye into you and I thought for this year that was my theme of my heart I want to draw an iron to him in my heart you know what I mean I want it to be more personal than it's ever been I I want the love affair to grow and I just think it's a a beautiful thing that God's doing you know these are kind of like home meetings we're welcome for all our visitors and all that came but this this meeting was I think really set for us that we could take that next step to draw closer and that's that's really what I want I want to be touched in my heart you know what I mean something just deep and Rich and I thought of this prayer that brother Branham prayed uh in the message invisible Union and I thought this is my prayer and I hope it's your prayer too Lord God I am asking the bride tonight the ones that I feel has pulled away and waiting may they separate themselves from everything in the world they must lay in the presence of the warm s-o-n light of the son of God bathing in his word in his love granted dear God yes I want to bathe in his love this weekend don't you that I know he loves us I know he cares for us and I know he wants to do for us exceedingly and abundantly above what you got you can either ask or think but it's very simple if you draw nigh unto him and not and I thought beyond my lips Beyond My Singing Lord I want my heart Amen to draw an eye unto you uh isn't that your heart's desire tonight so it's a real privilege for us to have brother Michael with us I think the first time he ever preached away from his house there's home church he preached here for us and then he came back again with his father and preach for us and we're nice to have him back today I know you'll be excited I know you'll be blessed and I know that's his heart desire is to present the Lord Jesus to you that you can draw close to him amen it's been amazing grace hasn't it all along let's sing that as we open our Pulpit to our brother we give them all the Liberty that he can take he doesn't know you he doesn't know your life but he knows the god you serve amen he knows the message that you follow and we have Fellowship in this together and so we love them so let's sing this song as we subject our hearts and our spirit to the spirit of the Lord to the word of God and let's just ask the anointing to come down let's just all draw a little nighty hymn he promised us that if two or three would gather together that he would be here so let's approach him knowing that he's going to walk in our midst tonight that he's going to be here and he's going to give us an opportunity to Touch the Hem of His Garment to tell him that we love him to listen to his voice and let our hearts just rise up in the goodness of his love let's sing Amazing Grace amen amazing foreign [Music] the Lord was Grace [Music] I remember that day amen [Music] trust me I praise [Music] Ten Thousand Years thank you Lord thanks [Music] and just praise and praise him praise God [Music] praise God [Music] we'll praise God praise God praise [Music] just a tidbit of what's going to come out of our mouths when we've been there 10 000 years amen amen will be shouting on the streets of Glory it'll be a whole lot louder I'm sure well it's sure good to be here tonight what an honor it is be with you as butter David said indeed it was my first trip away from home was here so this is like home away from home so we're just so thankful we can come here and sojourn with you share our heart and our burdens tonight I'll just be the appetizer and then butter Tom he'll be the full full course in the next couple of services all right and there's a few brothers that we were today they took us so just had to take a little break for her lunch and my goodness we had more than appetizers so if anybody was there and and you know it and they start to nod off because they are in food coma you just hit them and say wake up maybe but tonight maybe we'll fill up with a little bit different food tonight I mean that's what our desire is tonight well we'll just go straight to the word then and we'll turn to our scriptures we'll turn to Matthew 16 tonight very very we could say calm in Scripture something that I'm sure you've heard probably many have preached on somebody's probably preached on here but it's I'd say a really uh critical scripture Matthew 16 we'll start in 13. and you were worshiping I was sitting in the back there my goodness it just sounded so beautiful the people of Lord have a right to shout and sing amen for the way is growing dark but that ain't our future sir amen Matthew 16 we'll start verse 13 when Jesus came into the coats of caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am and they said well some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias and others Jeremiahs or one of the prophets well you saith unto them but whom say ye that I am it had to be personal has to be personal tonight you can say well so-and-so says this is who you are so and so is that but who do you say who do you recognize him to be that's what Jesus is asking them and so Simon Peter something struck him quite strongly amen something struck him he says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God Amen and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon barjona for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee by my Father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against him amen isn't that a precious scripture amen what a promise the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it maybe you just can skip over a couple books into John 17. we'll just read one little verse there John 17 verse 1 right at the top very short portion these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come I'm just going to stop right there the hour is calm amen let's just pray Heavenly Father tonight we have come to gather around your precious bleeding word Lord our that's what draws us together that's what unifies our heart is not Lord just natural friendships and different Lord ways that we come together but Lord It's Your word that unifies us Lord that we can come from different parts of the world in the East and the west but Lord something in our heart connects us it's your word tonight and Lord we want and desire that word to really Lord just to be to become a Living Word Lord it may be somebody that's come Lord year over year and it's just Lord maybe just a letter but Lord tonight he could become Living Word to their heart and Lord when that happens Lord nothing's the same Lord Peter Lord when he had that Revelation strike his soul lord I'm sure Nothing Was the Same Lord because the Lord it was revealed to him exactly who you were so Lord I pray tonight that would be the the Lord the tonight what you would do to each and every heart is reveal who you are to your people we pray in Jesus Christ's name we commit this weekend now in this service amen hey man you may have receipts I'm still as nervous as I was four years ago nothing's changed there I can tell you that we'll just take a little scripture we'll enjoy the the word tonight The Hours come I'm going to just take a little bit I want to speak tonight about the bride's moment the bride's moment and it we have little moments we would call it what a moment in life is maybe just a short little piece of time something that we we can live we you know a capturable moment or something we live we go through a little event we say well I want a great moment that was I just don't know how amazing that that time was and I pray maybe this will be that at the end of these next few days you say what a moment we had in the presence of the Lord and so that'll be a time that you can you capture in your memory say wow what a moment that was right we so we have these These Times our lives are filled with moments is essentially what happens I think even Apple has got that figured out you know when they pop up on your phone you know a new moment and so they put a whole bunch of pictures together you say yeah exactly I got a couple Apple people here with me all right you see that and so that's what it is these are these are moments in time but sometimes you know we miss moments uh you know they pass by like this fast and and we just don't miss it we say wow I wish I really held on to that that aspect of my life or maybe that portion of time maybe we'll this weekend will blow by and you'll be like man I just didn't pay attention the way I should have but that moment is now gone and so we want to hold on to that amen life does that it just like Fades it's like Vapor scripture said life is like a vapor right and so it just kind of goes like a puff of smoke it just suddenly the time is gone and the moment has disappeared and that happens that probably the older ones in here to be like yeah where did time go now you know from the kids to the grandkids and it just disappeared on you and suddenly it's uh you know time is gone and you're wishing oh to be back at 20 or 25 or 40. okay maybe you're not surely somebody's wishing they could go back to 20. I'm wishing I could go back to 20. but people don't we don't pay attention to moments sometimes many times many times I I know you've all seen it it's an easy way to to give an example but uh you know everybody goes to like a big event and they're just like yeah this is amazing right they're taking they're looking at the moment through this device right here they're like yeah let's just you know a big family deal or maybe a real special time you're like yeah this is yeah let's take the picture and they live the moment through this everything's going on around them and they're like yeah this four and a half inch screen is just the best way to take it in so take the moment in here and they actually miss what's going on right and I wonder how many how many years are going to pass by they said man how many moments did I really miss how many moments have I missed thus far and so we want to capture we want to we want to live right here we want to live in the now right we want to live kind of right now everything to God is right now God don't have past or future he has now and so time is an interesting concept okay we we consume ourselves with time don't we and uh and we consume ourselves with the passing of it we're concerned with future and we're concerned with with the past and and so it actually it stops us from enjoying the presence of now the presence of right now and we actually get duped into into remaining in two different places we get either we get we either have to we stay either in past and mulling over what has happened and we we Ponder this and we think about the past and we really chew on that one or or we're into the other side and we're waiting constantly for what's happening ahead of us we're always oh you know what's my future going to be like or what I'm going to do when I grow up and all these types of things and so we're stuck in either the past or the future but those are really you can't really hold on to those moments you know the past is it's I can't grab it and I can't grab the future but I'm living right here right now it's a tangible piece of time I can touch it because it's right here it's right now but 15 minutes from now I got nothing nothing so how much do we stay back there and few past and how often do we stay trying to look in the future and we miss the moment we missed it now and so we get distracted in these aspects but you know we're all unavoidably victims of time to some degree because it's become accepted state of Norm in this fast-paced kind of highly motivated world that we live in very high strung I would I'm sure you'd all agree but it's important that we understand to not be present is to be torn between essentially these two worlds it's in one or the other and neither of them exist at the end of the day it's just kind of something out there and it's something back there but this moment right here right now it exists right now that's what you have man so many people they Ponder the past can't get past maybe a grudge can't get past maybe a memory of something that happened to them something it's hindering them and they get stuck there and they never actually ever really can move forward and some some people brother Brandon even talks about those that build Bridges and they worry so much they become so nervous because they're they're building these bridges in life in their mind he says they actually never come to pass they don't even happen and so you get so worried about future and just miss everything forget the past don't live in a rearview mirror you don't drive that way do you I sure hope not you're going down the road and you're like yeah and you're looking in the rearview mirror the whole time no I'm sorry please tell me what would happen yeah we'd crash you're done so don't live life that way live it in the rear view mirror oh my everything that happened in the past and what this happened how this happened to me this person did that to me oh why did they do that oh my goodness and you're gonna crash because you have no clue what's going on right now just move on well I even said that forgive those things which are behind very fast-paced world you know I can imagine I was thinking about this When I Was preparing for and I was thinking about what it what would have happened to the at the pool of Bethesda if you got lost in the past or the future and you were sitting there on your on the steps to the pool or something like that and maybe you could have been right there right at the front end of it and you could have been sitting there in your in your tatters or your your Affliction of some sort and you could get lost lost in how come I'm this way and how good has happened to me and your mind is just wandered off or what's gonna happen to me in the future I can't even find my my food for tomorrow and you're sitting there and you get lost in it and the angel starts to trouble the water and you're somewhere else somewhere in your mind somewhere in the past somewhere in the future and you miss the moment someone else is like the water's moving and I'm in and you're like whoa but I was right there and you missed it missed the moment help us tonight as the angel starts to stir the waters as he starts to stir this weekend in your soul you say oh no I don't want to be my mind somewhere else pondering about what tomorrow may hold right now the Angels turn the water saying look up your Redemption draws now the water is turned you need to be right attentive is that have been really lame to miss it miss it but Abraham says I see a woman sitting way back there she's got a blue and white polka dot dress she's got a lump in her left side have faith don't doubt don't miss it oh God Miss Griffith have faith in God believe with all your heart and the almighty will heal and make you well you know how many he says that number of times to people he says don't miss it oh God he then he calls out their name because he's trying to catch their attention don't miss the moment the angel is moving right beside you he's right over you don't miss it he says if you can only take a spiritual Looking Glass and look into your soul he says and you'd find out what it looks like he says the greatest devil and the chiefest of all is unbelief is unbelief how about demon of doubt wages and has claimed so many and I want to take this this this aspect of Doubt because I want to bring it and tie it together with missing your moment because somebody so often people miss their moment because they're doubting what God is able to do for them and so that's what brother Brian had to stir their their faith up call their name out and say don't you know don't basically don't disbelieve don't doubt because they're sitting there well you know I don't know is this really Mrs so-and-so Mrs Griffith catch their attention their faith spikes because doubt is hanging there trying to hinder the moving of God in your life and miss your moment that's all the devil's really caring about tonight he's just sitting here what can I do to distract you so that you miss the moment this weekend tonight even and so he's going to throw whatever he can at you he's throwing to all you teenagers something about tomorrow or your schoolwork or your work or something like that or your friends doing this or this is happening and how can they put that on Instagram I mean that no so he's there he's just throwing at you something so did you miss the moment and doubt the chiefest of all Devils is what better Branham says is the Kingpin of trying to do that and hinder God moving in your life if we look at Cain as an extreme example he was he here he was with Abel God had just said hey just do as your brother who is your brother Abel simple he was in this moment here the sacrifice if he had just done that his sacrifice would have been accepted he labored Cain was a good old church boy and here he was in the Garden of Eden but Abraham says there was no scriptures written the two boys came neighbor they both wanted to make a sacrifice and find favor with God and he says so Cain Khan built an altar Abel built an altar well if that's all God requires God would be unjust to condemn Cain so Cain made a sacrifice so did Abel Cain worshiped so did Abel Cain did everything Abel did so if a church so if belonging to church going to church making sacrifice praying and worshiping to God is all God requires then God would be unjust to condemn Cain so there's got to be more than that got him more than that but Kane doubted and disbelieved really what happened in the garden he didn't he didn't believe so he would he was not going to believe well here's Abel he's killing a lamb he's he's put a completely different sacrifice and he said no there's no way I've got the the fruits this is the fruits of my labor this is what I'm doing he had no he had no desire he couldn't there was nothing even in him to believe that and to say well you know and accept the sacrifice and that that unbelief and that doubt hindered him from having an accepted sacrifice it wasn't even in him it wasn't even in him but so that's an extreme example doubt raining in his heart imagine poor Noah's naysayers you know this is what hindered them really it's gonna rain Noah what even is that you're telling me water's coming from the sky it's gonna it's gonna sprinkle down and and there's going to be enough of it to flood this place you're insane I've never even seen this before what even is that God we get moisture from the ground but no but God told me don't believe it don't believe forget it Noah you're you're off your rocker into the world are you kidding me you mean this place is going to completely be destroyed and God just spoke to you right because what was happening was doubt unbelief that was hindering them from being saved yes I think of those like Nicodemus who came to his moment my goodness Nicodemus came to Jesus by night he had a secret meeting with Jesus he had a face-to-face encounter he was in the presence of the Almighty yes how is this that we must be born again I have to re-enter my mother's womb he just couldn't get there how can this be and doubt was raining there I don't even see how this can be it and see he was trying but doubt was hindering him here he was face to face with Christ can you imagine that not many people had a one-on-one private moment some were going through the crowds they were just we'll get there just trying to get there there was hundreds of people but Nicodemus had a private meeting by night and he misses moment he couldn't believe he doubt was raining there Rich Young Ruler same same aspect another one-on-one encounter but just couldn't believe the words that were being said just sell all you have just give your possessions and follow me nah is that really what I need to do really I mean if I have all my possessions I could make a huge tithe check and the work of you know the work of the disciples and Jesus would be just greatly benefited sell everything I got nah and again found himself in hell imagine Judas he also walked with Christ day to day but his heart impenetrable those at Pentecost these are on new wine they weren't catching the moment what God was doing and so doubt he's out there Desiring to hinder a move within some when God's people he's chief chief is chief of the devil that's what he is and so they're there to create confusion create uncertainty and just cast a little bit of Reasonable Doubt that's a legal term actually just a reasonable doubt if you can get enough of that the jury is like well you know I don't know if I can believe this it'll throw it out of court because there's Reasonable Doubt this didn't happen right and so that's really all the devil is trying to do he's just trying to cast enough Reasonable Doubt really is that really what God is Desiring is that really what I need to do just enough just needs a little Shadow of Doubt he says Butter Brown says the devil would like to prove that different he's trying to be he talks about him being trying to be exposed he hates to be exposed in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is Jesus said about Satan he has no pardon me I have no pardon him and he says the devil would love to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word okay why do you think all of this message all this message is tough and believe the sign and all this aspect because he's just trying to destroy confidence in the word it's a tactic of the devil see it for what it is it's just trying to put doubt in you and I's heart yeah amen when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spirit of revelation of the word the gates of hell cannot Prevail amen and so forget that reject the Reasonable Doubt he's just trying to play something in your heart can you imagine God's Court law didn't work that way this doesn't work that way so you'd think in the in the current man's idea or I should say in Satan's Court he would bring up those Noah those scientists in Noah's days they'd tell them all about the scientific achievement of the day and why there's no moisture in the air and why there's just an impossibility for it to flood and where the moisture is going to come from it's completely lunacy and so they would be casting not just Reasonable Doubt incredible amounts of doubt but God's court of law isn't working that way we can say it that way he says no if Noah God understand and he'd just say well God spoke to me and he told me that it's going to have a flood and I must build an ark and I believed it well in God's court of law he's saying that's that's the way it would go he'd throw the gala down and say case dismissed out of court it's totally opposite God wants Faith he wants you to believe he wants you to cast inside reasoning cast aside all doubt a man I wonder if you put no if you put yourself on the stand what would your testimony be we don't want to be on the Reasonable Doubt side you'll say no God sent a message God sent a prophet God came in my day and unveiled himself before me and sent a message to capture my heart oh really that's what you believe in Satan's gonna throw it in you really well what about all this all these different issues with the cloud this and that and the other really and he's just going to throw a little bit of this a little bit of Doubt on God's core understand you say ah I believe it I might not understand it all but I believe it and he's saying bam case dismissed amen I really don't care how many Fall Away for one reason or another Branham actually says he goes you know he says you've seen so many impersonators come along saying this and glory to God I got this and Hallelujah I got this and you find out they haven't got nothing this is a quote and the devil did that to rise a doubt in your heart look at that you find they got nothing and the rise of doubt in your heart he did that purposely to do that but remember if the devil's going to do that and put an impersonator in our midst just to rise in doubt in your heart amen you say well you know what really a fake here and some how come that person you know left in the Years hey over the years you've seen a lot of people come and go this is how it is but it's purposely done to rise it down in your heart but brother Branham says he goes but remember the only remember that only says one thing that if there's an impersonator there is a genuine if there's an imposter there's the real thing there's gonna be somebody somebody that's gonna say no I'm the real thing I don't care what you do I don't care what you doubt but I believe it 100 percent hey man he says there's a genuine Holy Ghost there's a genuine spirit of God there's a genuine power of God there is a Son of God that's reflecting himself tonight as the Holy Spirit to show forth his life he's standing here tonight in the midst of you Amen in the form of the Holy Spirit to pound all the dross out of you all the doubts out of you and reflect to you the resurrection amen he said he's not dead oh sir hey man he's alive a man's a doubts trying to hinder you from from receiving in your moment what God has ordained for you but Abraham says the chiefest of all and so now it can hinder somebody from receiving what God has designed for them if you read in Matthew 13 it says and when he'd come to his own country speaking of Jesus he taught them in their synagogue in so much that they were astonished and said when's hath this man this wisdom and these Mighty works is this not The Carpenter's son is not this his mother it's called Mary and his brother and are James and and Joseph and Simon and Judas and his sisters are they not with us as well so they're just talking to themselves when when's had this man done all these things and they're offended him in him but Jesus said unto them he said a prophet's not on not without honoring his own country and in his own house and he did not many mighty works because of their unbelief think of it because of their unbelief here the king of glory was walking in their midst it where isn't that his son his or his brothers James and his sisters and such this is all they could see because of their unbelief and he said the scripture says and he did not many mighty works because of their unbelief it's not because Jesus lacked power because they wouldn't believe and he was there and he could have done so much for them but they said I don't believe it cannot be who is this but I am so glad tonight that there is something that God is able to penetrate that demon of doubt it is not it might be the most powerful in Hell's domain but it is not the most powerful in God's domain amen and butter Branham talks about this he actually talks about there's those that are that are just straight unbelievers they're just they don't even have the seed inside of them to believe but he said that's different he says that there he actually tells them to leave the service at the end in prayer lines and when he's Discerning he says if you don't believe he said I just recommend you get out okay because it would be a bad it's a it was a terrible time a terrible position to be in as God is moving in the service and they don't believe he said but as a Believer he said if there he talked about a Christian he says you might just have weak faith he says well he goes we can take care of them the moving of God in your life amen and so he gave an example he said there was a man in a service he said service after service brother Brandon would come to the come to the the uh at the end of a service he said who who would like to receive Christ who would like to receive Christ tonight and and this young man he would stand up and he'd acknowledge yes I I want to serve the Lord and I want to give my life to the Lord and so then brother Branham he'd pray for the different ones that did that and and he'd do it again at next service or so he'd say well who would like to give their Hawks to the Lord and stand for Christ and this man would stand up again I want to stand for Christ oh okay and brother Brandon praise from the game he'd do it again and again and again he said this happened many times and months passed he said even Revival is coming he would stand you know and he then brother Brown says mine this is it just didn't quite you know he didn't need to talk to this man and so brother Brown went out and and uh seen him on the street and he says uh are you a Christian yet after many times standing up he had something in his heart he had a yearning he had to hit a desire but something just wasn't clicking for him he just wasn't able to really press through in a set so so brother brother Branham beats him on the street and says you a Christian yet you know what his response was he says no I said well he's honest you know he'd stood up many times here brother Brandon I was asking him he says no he says but remember me so that was what an appropriate response he says now he did this again then in another service and he said he said now those that like to stand for Christ if you'd like to give your heart to the Lord this is after this time in the street he said I said to him Little Brown says I said come here a minute he walked up think about this so now come here a minute he says what's the matter with you this is better Branham imagine if someone stood in the church and better better David said you know who would like to give their heart to the Lord tonight he'll just stand and give their life to Christ and a few of you would stand up and maybe someone say no I'm consecrating my life to him and Brother David said you know I've seen that person stand up like 15 times he's saying come here a minute I want to talk to you this is what brother Brown did he says what's the matter with you he says I don't know I said do you want to become a Christian okay he says yes sir he says well why don't you become a Christian he said I don't know I said there's just something he says down in your heart you want to be a Christian but there's something that won't let you be a Christian is that right he said that's it I said brother Brian he said that's a devil he said and that's unbelief and I said you believe that look at how simple this is you believe that my goodness something though was rising up and starting to strike this man's heart it was just brother Brandon was Discerning what it was he says that's just unbelief not the unbeliever that doesn't even have it there he had something in his heart that desired God to come in and change him but he was being hindered by something but Abraham says it's the devil it's unbelief you believe that he said yes sir I said Do you believe if I'll ask God to break that power of unbelief above you that you'll be a Christian amen he said yes sir amen and in just that time we bowed our head he let out a scream he jumped in the air like that and it was gone and the man is a staunch Christian today amen he said Do you believe if I pray that that power of unbelief above you you'll be a Christian just that simple just as simple yes I believe you could be in that exact position tonight you could have stood up 18 times over the last five years Desiring something of God to move you but it's just something a little demon of Doubt but the same God that delivered that man if you said Lord there's a demon of unbelief that is trying to cause me doubt but at your word it's your word it can be gone because it cannot have power over your God he might have might be the cheapest but he cannot cannot overcome the power of almighty God he said watch just the devil that unbelieved that little old snickering thing there little Shadow to keep him from breaking into it recognize it for what it is it's just a shadow that's trying to stop you from breaking into it amen but the power of God the power of almighty God is greater than greater than every darkness and every enemy amen and something revealed to him he says my and he believed it and it was over in a moment he had a moment he was in the moment he could have been why is he calling me up like that why is he pulling me out like that in the audience and making me embarrassed like that because he was concerned over his soul that's all that mattered he said young man I want to talk to you you come here and here he was in the presence of a prophet he said it's a demon of unbelief you believe that I do you believe if I pray the power of darkness is gone I do done over it's that simple it's not a complicated thing this is do you believe amen amen faith to believe a better Brian says there's a revelation he says the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized never ever be overemphasized he said it means more to you the Revelation your Revelation he says which is Faith it means more to you than perhaps you realize he says no I'm not talking about the Book of Revelation I'm talking about all Revelation it's tremendously important to the church amen because we know the gates of hell can't Prevail against it is what the scripture says Butter Brown says how could God build the church Upon A man speaking of those thinking that it was Peter that they were building the church on that he denied the Lord Jesus and cursed while doing it can't build his church Upon A man born in sin and it wasn't some rock laying out there as though God had hallowed the ground at that spot he said and isn't as the Protestant State the church is built on Jesus it was on Revelation read it the way it's written Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it but my father hath revealed it and Upon This Rock Revelation I'll build my church he said the church is built on Revelation and that is what the devil is wanting to hinder you from his from from receiving and causing the devil because if you can get that if he can drop a revelation in your heart of who he is he cannot Prevail over you brother Brian he says he says it Expo Revelation exposes Satan it Reveals His Works he says he fights that he can't stand that to the devil now he knows that if he can get the people but this is speaking the Lord if he knows even get the people true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she's an invincible Army amen so why do you think the devil is trying to send out his chief one get down get out there I need the biggest guns of hell out there because I can't get them to believe that they're an invincible Army so I'm going to make them doubt who they are doubt that they're a child of God doubt that God can conquer everything and they'll be not invincible and Satan he says will be powerless before him he'll be he said he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert he says oh we love it Satan hates it but we love it amen may God pour it on each and every one of us amen fat butter brownie even says the Visage of Satan is actually he even changes his countenance when he's being exposed hey man can you imagine he says you see those faces Satan knows he's going to be exposed when something's being revealed to somebody he says in the most peculiar change comes over their countenance he says Satan is afraid let's change his face tonight Satan's afraid he's afraid that something's going to be imparted into your soul and say oh his whole face changes he drops with just complete dismay in all sorrow are you kidding me they're getting it tonight change his face tonight till God cast that demon of Doubt away I want to receive everything I want this moment to be mine Hallelujah hey man it's different it's not learning it's not message teaching and just oh you know what just learn it you're learning your ABCs something different than that if you can learn it you can unlearn it but when it is dropped in your soul when it's something that Wells up and it just strikes you say oh my goodness that's Jesus Christ he's my savior I was a wretch but now I'm free I was lost but now I'm found and God revealed who he is to you that's why they're gonna be those here that are here for 40 years 50 years 60 years because nothing can change you yeah and they're standing in the face of the enemy saying yeah Impostors imposters but genuine genuine that's why we have our veterans in front of us and you we respect them with everyone because they've been standing high waters come enemy has come and battered them and bruised them but they're still standing amen it's a precious place where God reveals himself to you they're precious moments so precious brother Brown he says he says the devil can lie he says he can get those five senses and lie to you but he can't touch that super sense of Faith he can't touch it that's why he hates it that's why he combats it that's why he don't want you to get to church that's why he don't want you on your knees that's why he don't want you in the scripture that's why he doesn't want you reading a message because he's combating he hates it he can put everything he can lie to you on every level but he cannot get his little fingers on so on your Sixth Sense hey man it's beyond his reach Amen brother Brown says it's called faith faith is that great thing amen it's a place where God reveals to you that you alone are more than able amen beyond the reach of Darkness beyond the reach of Doubt beyond the reach of the enemy he can't grasp it there it's that sacred Sans place he says when doubts come fears begin to rise there's always that certain place that you can go back to that time where God met you and the devil can't tread on those sacred Sands he could tread on a lot of places he can bring up memory and he can storm Polo over it he can bring up imagination he can just ride like a chariot like jehu all through it and he can tread all over but there's a spacious precious place there's a special place that he cannot put a toenail on because it's where you and God had communion that's where you and God had Fellowship God met you and he you drove his take down God you became personal to me and the devil can't go there you go there you go back to those sacred moments you go back to those Precious Places and say that's where God met me and God will meet you again and again and you'll have those moments and every one of them every one of those moments is Untouchable by Darkness amen I'm so glad there's a place that he can't even go think about it I think about that little little story but around talks about that little eagle think about when he was all pecking there like a chicken he was pecking in the chicken yard here he is uh you know here like an eagle stands yay tall they're pretty big things and he's just like walking with his big talents all over the chicken yard with these little shrubs of chickens all around him and he's he hasn't figured out this isn't my place she's like all right you know we pack I guess this is what we do and that's just what he knows he knows the worms is what I eat the dirt is where I scratch he's got a Talon about the size of my finger and he's like all right meanwhile the chicken is it's like scratching hard he's just like what he must have provided a lot of worms for a lot of chickens he was the pro Digger but can you imagine okay that's what he was but can you imagine he hears something he heared a scream he said wait a second that's I haven't heard that before something started speaking to him you're sitting in a service you're like I've been in the service for 10 years but something struck something called out to you and you said whoa whoa wait a second what's that and you look up you look up your Redemption is drawing nice hey wait a second that looks like me he's got really big wings like me nothing like this little shrub of a chicken here with a little drumette come out of his bottom come on and he starts looking and viewing yeah yup Talons beat yup that's me and he started to recognize who he is he said I'm an eagle that's who I am I've been born to fly so here he says forget the chicken yard I'm going to go up and he starts to Flap Them Wings this service keeps going forward you start listening to more words and you're like wow and you start to Flap them little wings of yours and you start to fly I want to ask you the question do you think anything anything someone could have told that eagle actually you're not an eagle you're a chicken get back to the Head yard do you think anything could do that never never to be an insane Eagle it's not even happy music really I'm now soaring 10 000 feet in the air and I those those chickens are actually my prey they were who I was teaching but now they're fat and they're blunt but I'm gonna eat them you think he's going back never neither are you ever going back when God reveals who you are never can you go back to the pan peck of the world never leather band says because something is inside you amen that's why faith Revelation is so important because it's what recognizes that God is present and on the scene if Cain had a revelation can you imagine God spoke to him face to face but he had nothing Zippo I can't even imagine come on Kane just do as your brother God speak you to him nothing void of any ability to recognize that God was there yeah it's brother Branham when he was told he says he can get the people to believe faith not even cancer will stand before your prayer amen brother says so then you see why Satan is so against the Book of Revelation he said anything that's revealed spiritual Revelation Satan is against it because it's reveal the revealing of Christ all right he said Let the church go on with his great denomination organization little flowery messages and so forth let him go on Satan won't bother that they don't have no troubles everybody pass them on the back but when there comes a time that God through the Holy Ghost revealed Christ back to the church with power and demonstration and healing and of the sick and signs and such he said he would follow the Believers come to pass it and Satan turns over in his bed and does something about it when God starts to reveal himself to the Church of who he is and God starts to move the power of God is on his people that turns the devil in his bed wait a second the denomination he don't care he's snoring logs he's that got nothing to do I don't have to worry but when God is revealed and he's moving in his people and they start recognizing God is on the scene Satan is turning over in his bed saying oh dear goodness I got to get up these people are seeing who they are they're actually serving they know that there's a living God in the scene that there's a message of this hour bringing a bride to her position I'm getting out of bed I'd say get him out of bed get him out of bed don't leave him sitting there don't know don't don't leave the devil like yeah whatever I don't need to worry about them make him worry about you be a disrupter of his sleep get him up morning noon and night yeah there were those in the scriptures that were a disrupter they were disruptor of the enemy that was there was able can you imagine what a disrupture when God revealed to him it was blood and he put a lamb on the altar that was a disrupter can you imagine Satan saying are you kidding me he knows exactly what it was in the garden he was trying to hide it hurricane had no even understanding of it but Abel did because it was revealed to him that what happened in the garden here right at the beginning Satan's like no way he knows exactly and he's actually doing putting a lamb on the altar as a foreshadow of what's to come of a land that's coming on the cross oh no not already not the first person yeah shamgar think of it it was revealed to him who he was he says now wait a second you know the story we know shamgar his little Ox code and brother Brandon dramatizes that so well talks about his little children and how they weren't eating and nothing like that but something struck him something was revealed to him he said wait a second I am an Israelite I'm in circumcised I am part of God's people and I am not going to allow this to come against me and so it was it struck him and here he was in position with faith struck he took his Ox gold and he was in his moment and what did he do he defeated them all When Faith strikes you when Revelation strikes you and you live that moment you're a disrupter of the enemy's Kingdom I think my goodness time the devil must have thought he had it with Samson he just had it there he locked him up cut off his hair put his eyes out he said yeah I beat him got it and so there was Samson sitting grinding out on the grinder down in prison there but something started to well up with him some started to well up in him he started to realize wait a second I am under a covenant I started to reach back during those days and his hair started to grow back he says I'm a chosen one he started to realize who he is and what God brought him for and the moment came when he could come out there and he stood on those pillars and hear the devil thinking that he was going to take him down but he recognized he was in his moment he knew who he was he said God wants more once more and he could reach back and take strength from who he was and he killed more more in that moment than he did all through Past Times you can do more in surrender and dying to yourself and realizing who you are then all the pastimes great amen so revelation brings a recognition which brings you a moment in his presence and there's a little woman that had a blood issue and all them people passing by all them people standing you can imagine what it was and Jesus was moving through the crowds oh my goodness incredible times and people were trying to get to the front trying to get to there and oh there goes the rabbi oh that's that guy over there that claims to be a prophet oh there's that fanatic over there and all such as that he said but but what happened he said that little woman had an issue of blood and she had heard about him she had heard that he had been healing the people she'd heard that there's there's something different about this man no no he's a fanatic I knew what he's doing out there so he killed him he's a prophet or something like that so she's hearing it she's hearing all the different things of the day she's got all the doubt being cast out there Chief Demon's like yeah did you hear this did you hear that she heard it she heard it but he says but what happened the little woman had an issue of blood and she had heard about him and when she come down there regardless of what anybody said he said she recognized who he was this is the importance of recognizing who he is if he can reveal to you and you can receive that she said if I could only touch His Garment but because she was recognizing she was ensuring that she wasn't going to miss her moment she said I knew that is that's something different that's Jesus Nazareth he he must be somebody he's more than a prophet I got to get to him and he says and when that genuine faith in God became a positive thing to her what did it release it released his power to heal her incredible quote if you can recognize he's on the scene if you can recognize he's here there's a power that's released to her you and I there was a power brother Brown said of healing to that was released to her she said it can if I can just touch him in such a way he turned around and told her what was wrong with her he said your faith has saved saved you what did he said Faith others standing there might have been sicker than she but you see she recognized his presence I wonder how many services we go by and we don't recognize his presence and then someone just strikes it it's just just reaches the throne and the Lord just blesses them and they receive something through the service because they recognized his presence in their midst and everyone else can be like I don't know why why are they so happy why are they so calling out on God why are they receiving what am I missing they recognize something they recognized his presence God help us that we don't miss God moving on the scene as we're here in a service we can and we counter you're living in your little prayer room and his presence come and it's just you know commonness don't miss him tonight don't miss him don't miss him tomorrow recognize his presence she did and she received the healing he says understanding by sicker than her she recognized his presence she knowed that was her opportunity that was her moment she says I ain't gonna worry about the past I ain't gonna worry about the future I've got a moment right here right now he's in my midst oh he's a long he's still a hundred and something feet off and there's a thousands and hundreds of people but he's right there and he's just right there it's like I can almost just feel it I gotta get there somehow and so then it takes a little effort to press in to a service it takes some effort to get into the atmosphere and say oh God you have something for me there's something for me I need something from you he's just right there he's just in your midst but is he can you recognize it and she did whatever it took she tore over the people she got underneath the people she crawled down on the ground skinning up her knees and this and that and the other she's like I gotta get there whatever it takes because he's here he's here [Applause] where there are two or three gathering in my name there I am in their midst now maybe I pray not just two or three recognize he's in our midst but that all that you might receive and draw something from the master tonight he says but we've got to recognize his presence and now how you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest Glory Glory he said not the promised word of Moses age not any other things but the promised word of this age amen made manifest my goodness and God didn't do it under a little bushel no God made himself manifest in this day in front of the world then you know he's here and he doesn't do it to entertain he's not doing this entertainment but Abraham talks about it he says not doing God doesn't show these things entertain he wants you to recognize his presence because he wants a relationship with you he wants communion not just to show off too many people wanted Jesus to show off and they got nothing nothing but then they were summoning that said I I just want to communion with him I need to get to his feet I need to worship him that person that person that was different how we know about the little lady who did just that and she rushed real quickly he went with an alabaster box and she had to get to Jesus as well she recognized somebody was here that needed to meet her need she was a wretch she was a sinner she had a terrible terrible background and terrible life who knows what had brought even brought her there but he she said he's a prophet as she goes she's thinking in her memory I know of another person you know the word traveled like really quick in those days and she heard it of another person that was just like her that had a character like hers and if God can do that to her if God can move on the scene for the woman at the well surely he can do it for me Rahab recognized something and she got what she needed I'm like a Rahab I'm like a little Harlot I need something from him he's a prophet I need to get there but she recognized his presence in their midst and so she had an opportunity and she recognized him and she was forgiven Glory up there he says I'll recognize he's the son of God I'll do him as service I don't care what they do but I'll do something what is he asking you to do what is God asking you to do she got there on his feet she started weeping and crying and and all her hair all about her and she's starting to wash his feet with her tears and just worshiping and communing with him and here everybody's just looking around like what is she doing does he even know who she is think of the dichotomy here think of the disparity between everybody here everybody else it's like she's just a prostitute here what kind of man is that would even let her at her feet but she recognized something it's the minority that recognizes Jesus in our midst she sought she recognized his presence what did it do it washed what did it release to her brother Brown said forgiveness it released forgiveness to one It released healing to another it released forgiveness if you can recognize he's in your midst it's your moment she could have been looking there at me like oh I don't know I don't know if I can really get in there I mean it would it just caused me so much shame I mean look what would they think of me well you know what do they think you already doesn't really matter you know what they think about you I know but in front of everybody I have to like go in there oh but he's he's all alone and no one's even welcoming him Wally I know but maybe just wait for him to leave and then you can do it just secretly on the side street or something like that no but but look at him there and she's warring in her mind her opportunity was right there think of it doubt it's just coming in there no no you don't need it now do it some other day maybe tomorrow tomorrow Brandon says the devil does he says that's Catholicism tomorrow you can you can do that tomorrow delaying it another day he said she said no no I must do it I must do it I must get to his feet and she tore through she tore through that little room she busted past all them Pharisees he said I must get to his feet [Applause] and because she could do that because she pressed through all the doubt all the guilt all everything all the shame because she could do that for forgiveness was released to her and here Simon is standing there what's that unrecognized and look what he got terrible what a moment pilate stood there too yeah there he was face to face with the King of Kings he said I liked it I desire a miracle from him this is his what he saw Miracle Man in a miracle from him I want to see something this is all he was seeing but around him says right in the presence of God turned it down because what had he appreciated the opinion of the public more than he appreciated having the opportunity to be in the presence of God opinion of the public what are my friends going to say about ah if I really stand fervently for God in my school ah but you know I don't mock me I don't know I'm kind of like the top guy in my in my class you know I really don't want to have you know any of that shame it says pilot that's where Pilot was I don't know the public will and have a great opinion of me and he appreciated that more his popularity with the people and his position in Rome and then he appreciated having the opportunity to be in the presence of God bye mother Brown says what happened the woman was forgiven and given eternal life and pilate lost his mind and went insane and committed suicide drowning himself in Switzerland brother Brown says that God help us not to put something in the way of your moment maybe one more Little Martha you know Martha she gets a bad rap sometimes well you know Mary I want to be Mary yes Mary had her moment I defeated Jesus so you do want to be like Mary and not miss that opportunity you know when Martha but then something something must have changed I love Martha because Martha didn't run out because now her brother had died her whole world had changed the she was a breadwinner I'm sure for their family her sister and herself and her world got turned upside down and so here they've been calling no Jesus would you come you know if the friend your dear friend is is sick and needs you to come and he doesn't come and he delays here they are now days have gone a few days have gone by and now Lazarus has died and you can imagine just the whole thoughts that were going there and oh my you don't think the devil took every opportunity he could to just pound her with every bit of Doubt really he said he's your friend and he didn't even come out here to heal to heal you've seen how many other healings and how many other Miracles and he couldn't even come and save your friend your brother come on really you serve that kind of God but here Martha then Runs Out Jesus now is on the scene and she runs out to find Jesus and she said Lord Brown says watch that Sixth Sense watch this Faith now in action he says Lord if thou would have been here my brother would not have died but it doesn't end there she she said oh it's it's over all is done if you weren't here if you had been here he wouldn't have died and period that's not where it ends but she says even now even this moment because she recognized somebody was on the scene the king of glory was there Lord this could have happened he's dead already I know this he was sick you didn't come I just I take you at your will whatever you desire but even now even now you can deal with it even now you can raise him up why because you recognize who is in our midst she says whatever you ask of God God will give it to you he said that's the Sixth Sense she recognized somebody was there and I'm not gonna pass up my opportunity he's right here she ran to meet him she said oh I gotta get to him even now oh God even now I have an issue even now I have a body a problem in my body I need healing my son needs Deliverance I've had circumstances but even now you're here in our midst even now you can deal with it yeah Jesus pulled himself together he says I am the resurrection in the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live oh he says whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die here she's hearing this now from Jesus and you can imagine the reasoning is going on but Abraham says what are you going to say reasoning there's a man laying down there dead and worms crawling through him never die the resurrection and doubt is still working his action he's still he's still hitting hard and she's trying to get him and he says oh but he's just got through saying he was a resurrection into life that's God's word that's the Sixth Sense he said it's beyond Doctor's Care well it's beyond Hope they've got cancer Beyond it's ravaging through their body he was dead in the Tomb gone into these far past four stage cancer he oh he said his Beyond thoughts of scientific research defy all reasonings cast them down why it's witnessing to God's word he said I am not I will be but I am the resurrection and the life and whosoever believeth in me he said that's the Sixth Sense he says oh he said oh thy brother shall rise again brother Brown says to the Grave they went two of them he said something had to happen oh my can you imagine if Jesus said I just couldn't imagine when Martha cried out but even now oh it's one of my favorite lines of Martha she just cried out even now I don't care about the circumstances of the past right now you're here right now I need you amen and she knowed if she could only get to him she could get only close to him and present the case just to hear one promise from him that's all she wanted and when he said I'm the resurrection and the life and he that believeth on me though are dead that's all Martha wanted to hear that's all she wanted to hear all she wanted because Sixth Sense Faith was moving her to confess and believe him and you know what Drew for her yeah yeah you know what her faith Drew for her Resurrection somewhat healing they came and they recognized the opportunity and said I have a need I got healed I need healing and God gave it to them there was one who needed forgiveness a wretched sinner far from Jesus and she came and bowed down his feet and said oh God I worship you and he did empowered you from him and forgave her but there's one like a Marta who said oh I believe you're the resurrection and the life and she recognized the presence of God and it drew down Resurrection Hallelujah what a position she was in what a moment yeah I wonder tonight what power do you need released [Applause] they received it in Scripture because they recognized he's here oh how many times brother Brown say he's here and how many missed it and how many was released to them what they needed you've got to put it into your world now you he's not a God he Hebrews 13 8. means yesterday today and forever bam says when he's not recognized his power is always not revealed when he's not recognized and so then the opposite must apply when he is recognized his power is revealed I said Lord are we recognizing Our Moment today are we going to go through this next set of meetings and just kind of let it go buy us and not take God starts walking down the aisle here and he starts pricking a heart starts pricking a heart it's a still small voice he doesn't come out with big shoutings and Lightnings and thunderings it's that still Small Voice and so and that's why that doubt is out there so much and just throwing every reason he can because he's trying to drown it out everything he can but God is moving you just get quiet enough God is moving he said Lord I really need you in this area of my life as we close you don't always think we can look back in the scriptures and we can think of that I always think how the disciples were so often Jesus was saying something to them he'd tell him he even told him about how he would die three days he'd be raised out he talked about this to them but then when it happened it totally missed it it totally missed that Jesus had talked to them about it and in the moment they totally missed what was actually happening even though they'd been told this is going to happen and then they're in the moment they're even forewarned and then it happened and totally went over their heads they thought well Elias was supposed to come yeah he did come that was John the Baptist oh these are the disciples and I wonder I wonder here we are in this age when the word has been revealed and the messages come to unveil Christ This is the End Time age with an end time message we cannot be like the disciples there's no extra time there's no extra time that they could be after didn't I tell you onto a mass as Jesus was telling him all the scriptures and it was now post oh oh and then their eyes were opening oh he told us about these things now we remember but it already passed God gave us an end-time message to reveal everything to show us the full opening of the word there is no oh oh that's what he meant because after Rapture there's no other opportunity don't miss the moment we're in now there's no extra time there's no overtime Rapture comes like oh it's tied and we've got to go in overtime I gotta chat no there's no chance God gave a message for the now he gave it for this moment today tonight so that you could recognize I have come in this hour to reveal who I am to pull a bride out of this hate don't miss the moment oh yeah Lord help us recognize Where We Are I know scripture brother Brown talks about when she recognizes who she is and he talks about releasing a power but our brand it's for me this is the bride's moment this is where we're at we can't miss it this is her moment this is what it's all come to is this time we can recognize the Son of God son of man being revealed in this day it's our moment to catch it amen he said if recognition can release healing if recognition can release Deliverance if recognition can release natural Resurrection the same recognition that God is on the scene here revealing a message to you recognizing this day and its message will release to a bride Resurrection in a rapture not recognizing there's no Resurrection it's a special power that's released to this bride but Abraham says but to the church the bride the Rapture is a revelation to where it's revealed to her that Revelation the true bride of Christ will be waiting for that revelation of the rapture what a moment yeah you know when you're expecting something and you're right on the edge you're just waiting for it to happen you know the moment has come for such and such to happen you are acutely aware of everything you're just looking what is is this what is this going to happen you're just waiting for it you don't know maybe exactly when but you're just waiting there's a moment the moment's coming here it is and you're just acutely in tune with what's happening that's where the bride is that's where his people are we're just we should be waiting just really acutely aware the signs of the times the messenger has come Malachi 4 has been revealed the word of God has been unveiled and you're just in tune because the moment is here isn't that where the wise virgin were right we had the wise and the foolish virgin and they're the foolish virgin they didn't have no oil in their lamp as we close and they you know they trimmed their lamps and these poor foolish version they recognize that you know what I gotta go find some some oil they weren't ready they weren't ready the shout went forth the bridegroom cometh and here's oh my goodness I don't have oil and so they clearly they missed the moment but there is a people yeah there's a people that are ready they have been waiting the call went out and they have oil in their lamp and they're saying all right and she's in her position now for something to happen the bride was coming and she's made she's trimmed her lamb nice and clean and everything's looking looking perfect she's got oil in her life she's living a holy life she's walking in step with the word whatever the word is saying she's doing and she says waiting there the broad groom cometh the bride room comes and so she's just waiting there the moment of Crossing is just about here here we are the fullness we have the fullness of all healing brother Brahm says that he Divine Healing is the earnest of our resurrection and the fullness of Deliverance now the fullness of Peace it's right here right at the tip of time and we're recognizing the bride recognizing this is the moment this is what it's all come to I'm here I'm ready I am aware the shout has gone forth and then there's going to come a time when the scripture says actually it says and then they went to buy the foolish version the bridegroom came and I put there the door opened because if you go open then they were ready that went in with him and the door was shut so when the bridegroom come the door opened okay that's kind of just if we it had to open for it to shut all right and I just thought my here we are at this time where we've recognized who we are we know exactly we're in position we're waiting for the moment and it's like at the wedding when the bride is standing there and she's ready and waiting she's adorned herself she's all ready and she stands at our church she stands at the door the door is shut you know nobody can see her quite yet everything's been away in the moment as everything she's made herself ready she's done everything the wedding is is perfect she's adorned herself and she's she's there everything is is perfectly in order and now the door opens and the bride walks forth this is her moment everything has been built up to this time can you imagine if she's there and the door opens she's just like in her t-shirt and jean skirt oh it's it's time no no she'd miss her moment really it's off what happened no not this bride she's prepared herself she's adorned herself with the righteousness of God she's put this message on she's pure spotless white she's robed in the righteousness of Christ and that door we are at that moment where the door is just about to open the bridegroom has called but the door is about to be there where the bride is in her moment it's her time to cross over from time into eternity because you recognize God is coming this day and you have brought down a power of Resurrection so that you can be ready to take that step oh my can you imagine there is a moment where part of me and part of you is in eternity and in time it is such a sliver of time but it's just a snatching of time don't miss that don't miss that moment where it's like yes I'm in eternity that's your moment that's why this message came that's why it's calling out to you that's where the devil hounds you because he wants you to miss that opportunity you know the moments after that musicians can come the moments after that are just pure Bliss yeah imagine oh my goodness these are the everything all the difficult moments that the bride has had getting to that point you know some weddings are terrible in preparation oh they're nightmares and you just hear about the stories of what goes on in preparation for a wedding oh my goodness it can be a difficult time it can be okay it's been a difficult time getting to this place the devil has pounded said there's no way a bride is going to come across that door of Eternity no way I'm going to hinder her there is a time and she is about there to step over and when she does all the memories of all those Trials of all those difficult moments of preparation are gone God Amen that's a moment I want to be in that's the bride's moment amen when he's in the Lord says well we've got a large wedding Feast prepared we've got a long Thousand-Year honeymoon and I just can't wait to show you the city that I've built for you oh my that's the moment he's dying to show you but you gotta get there you got to make sure you recognize him here so that you can be with him there amen amen don't miss a moment Brian it's just a little while longer that door is just about ready to open don't let go now amen oh my do you know the song because it's one of my favorites and I just it just was on my mind as I prepared for this here comes the bride do you know that song oh dear goodness well I know a few

sweetly ring choirs of angels start to sing pick up your trumpet Gabriel and blow oh my that's a moment Saint that's why we sojourn and we've labor and and we we go through these difficult times because this is the moment we've been made for amen well all right let's sing this [Music] hey man you can stand we know it can't be far away [Music] here she comes Here Comes [Music] we're here [Music] [Music] [Applause] what a happy day some from every nation [Music] [Music] the bride marching down [Music] the very hour knowing seems [Music] comes down [Music] oh what is [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] getting ready [Music] foreign [Music] she wants step inside boy Oh Happy Day what a happy day [Music] I I certainly wish I was more musically inclined but God didn't give me that but I'll tell you one thing I do have is I enjoy the word of God and you know something really struck my heart as our brother was preaching about a moment you know God gives us these moments all through life and if you're not ready and I don't know who is here Wednesday evening but I don't I think this I never seen a glove come together like this you know expecting looking for a moment and and God's got a moment for you he knows what you have need of and he has the moment and we here don't don't miss a moment but you ever think and and for you that you're if you have something in your life that's hindering you ask God for a moment and then when he comes recognize it let John do it recognize the doubt I love that about the boy coming up didn't you and he said yeah can you wreck it do you believe that that doubts the devil and the minute he recognized Satan for what he was and then he could recognize him for what he was then he knew that greater he is in you than he who is in the world and he was able to get this but why do you think that God in your life has laid out all the plans for you to have moments yeah do you know it's scriptural let me read a scripture to you behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed for in a moment in a moment how important is the recognition of a moment foreign just think of it I mean this isn't just a nice sermon right right by a guy that really knows how to preach you know what I mean with the lovely Spirit you just gotta love the guy even if you don't want it but it's more than that you see how easy it is to miss the moment of him telling us about a moment that's coming because I'm showing you a mystery it's going to be in the moment how quick of a moment in the twinkling of an eye the last Trump for the Trump shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise Incorruptible and we shall be changed you know God always prepares his people he always provides for them what they have needed and now here comes the voice of God out to us through the word of God saying church it's done in moments yes it's done in moments you've got to be prepared to receive the moment will he give you all little opportunities a moment you want a Deliverance in your life he will bring you a moment that you can grab a hold of you you have anxiety attacks ask for a moment in expectation brother Branham said do you need healing expect healing he'll give you heals you need salvation expect salvation he'll give you salvation you need Deliverance I need Deliverance I need a moment I'm looking for the moment that he comes to deliver me that's faith it's you can't look back you can't look forward because Deliverance comes now so as we go forward just think of this what he's doing because he's telling us the rapture we call it rapture the catching away the changing he says it so beautifully I'm showing you a mystery I'm showing you a mystery I'm telling you something I'm opening something up to you I'm giving you a revelation look at how the sermon unfolded first it started out Revelation Revelation the greatest thing is revelation and now we realize that he says yeah I I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment don't you think it would be a good idea if we practiced catching the moment if you look at your own life individually and ask yourself am I catching the moment because I need to be able to catch the moment because it's going to be in a moment I think it was more profound tonight than maybe we were able to grab a hold of it's maybe a little more serious because God's very gentle he's very kind he's very sweet he speaks his word in such a a lovely way but in another way he's crying out to us and letting us know Church get ready because it's just going to be in a moment now maybe you need a moment this weekend so I'll I'll accept that and you we could have a Revival right now you know I mean Tom would never have to preach Mike wouldn't have to preach again but I want that moment too but let's start looking for Our Moment amen you got bitterness Lord give me a moment I need a moment just give me a moment I've said that a lot of times give me a moment to get ready just give me a moment before I speak just give me a moment [Music] if you're tormented by something [Music] if you have a failure in your life that just keeps coming up and you do everything you can he sees that he sees your effort he sees your trying he sees the The Cry of your heart he sees the weakness of your flesh he was tempted every way that you're tempted [Music] gotta ask for the moment [Music] you've got to say Lord I need the moment [Music] you got to expect the moment you got to believe that he will give you that opportunity to walk away from that sickness to walk away from this sin that so easily besets you he will provide that to you he's Jehovah Jireh he will provide you the moment [Music] do you want the moment it may be tomorrow morning it may be tomorrow night it may be tonight but I want a moment do I say just a moment will I get my moment because the Rapture itself the same moment that gave you deliverance we heard the Lord say tonight is the same moment that gives you Resurrection the same moment that gives you healing is the same moment the only thing that's stopping you [Music] is that lying voice I want you to tell the devil that he is how many knows the definition of the devil he's the father of all lies and there's no truth in him our messenger told us he said that God cast his vote for you Satan cast his vote [Music] against you now is who you cast your vote with so when you hear that voice that voice that discourages you that voice that reminds you of how many times you failed are you going to accept that moment are you going to accept the moment says come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and I'll give you rest cast your cares upon me for I care for you cast your cares upon Him because he careth you what moment are you gonna take tonight because you've got to realize that was more than Michael speaking to us tonight that was Elohim veiled in flesh revealing to us a mystery I show you a mystery we're all knocking asleep in sin but we're going to be changed you realize you're going to be changed before you're going to be changed oh you got to be changed change me Hallelujah give me a moment change me I'm here [Music] I'm sitting right here right now In This Moment there's so many things I don't like about myself but you promised me that I could be different I promise your spirit would come by and make me different [Music] if I miss this change if I can miss the change from coming from lust to freedom from it if I could miss the moment of coming from Fear to comfort how am I Ever Gonna Catch the moment of the rapture let's prepare our hearts let's realize that you've got to decide that you want a moment [Music] you got to understand that he wants to give you that moment behold I stand at the door and knock [Music] any man that opens up I'll come in with him and I'll eat the evening supper and I'll sup with him you want that moment [Music] I'm going to let it rest there [Music] God keeps all his appointments do you believe he has a moment for you that's the first question I was do you believe that he's got a moment for you do you believe he's got a moment for someone that's on your heart you believe that he's got a moment for a loved one you believe he's got a moment for you to receive his Spirit to be free would you start looking for that moment would you start believing for that moment would you just start tonight quit listening to that slime bag [Music] and say Lord I know you got a moment [Music] your moments now touched a Hem of His Garment if it's not now be an expectation because he's going to come by in a rush of a wind in a little still small voice in a little quickening power and he'll touch you in just an instant latch onto it yes grab a hold of it pull it into your heart and believe it that this was him he came by I accept it look for Our Moment help me sing this with your brother Billy [Music] this love is so deep more than I can say I'm melting your peace [Music] The More I Seek You oh and the more I find are you crying from that moment the more I find you [Music] and bring [Music] more than I can stand when I'm melting your peace
