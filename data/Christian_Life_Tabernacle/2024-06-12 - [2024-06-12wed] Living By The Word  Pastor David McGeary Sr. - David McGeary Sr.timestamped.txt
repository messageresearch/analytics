[24:36] come upon the scene well I just want to
[24:38] give a testimony a few days
[24:40] ago uh me and my dad were looking at a
[24:44] vehicle and um we didn't know that the
[24:48] Lord was going to put this in into
[24:51] action but the Lord did it because we
[24:53] want to be obedient to the word of God
[24:56] so we were just dealing with with this
[24:58] individual and you know he had this van
[25:01] for sale so we went there and checked
[25:03] that out and
[25:05] um he was he he was from Georgia he was
[25:09] um um Armenian and his name was George
[25:14] so we start talking we're test driving
[25:16] he's letting us look at the vehicle
[25:18] and you know I just asked George a
[25:21] question and I said how is it with
[25:24] selling
[25:24] cars and he says you know what he says
[25:27] it's hard
[25:28] he said uh you know it's not the same
[25:30] that it used to be so then that just
[25:32] turned the door to talk to to start
[25:34] talking to him about the Lord so we talk
[25:38] for a few minutes and we get out of the
[25:41] car me and my dad he just invites us
[25:43] into his house to make the
[25:45] paperwork and we start talking and we
[25:48] start talking about the Lord
[25:50] and
[25:53] um then his wife comes out and she
[25:56] starts to get interested and just starts
[25:58] asking
[25:58] you know where we're from and everything
[26:00] and I'll tell you what it was it was
[26:03] such a supernatural presence there
[26:04] because you you can tell that there was
[26:07] hearts that was being poured out and
[26:08] wanting to know more about
[26:10] God and
[26:12] and we stayed there for a few hours and
[26:18] uh once we left we asked to say a prayer
[26:21] for him and it was just so it was just
[26:24] so beautiful the way that the Lord ended
[26:26] it but you know that's how God calls his
[26:29] children and if if we receive this word
[26:33] I it's always upon my heart to testify
[26:35] about the word and you just never know
[26:38] when God puts you in the place just for
[26:40] that reason this was never about the
[26:43] car this was just for the word for us to
[26:47] have the word upon our lips to testify

[47:16] be

[47:21] meet you in heaven and uh uh that'll be
[47:25] a great time that's the City I really
[47:27] want to visit so I I probably should put
[47:30] on here you know like uh Berlin and then
[47:35] right next to it you know the New
[47:38] Jerusalem you know because that's really
[47:40] where I want to go that's the city that
[47:43] I want to go to amen and so we just uh
[47:47] but anyway so uh I'll be preaching both
[47:50] services this Sunday it's it's Father's
[47:54] Day and but we'll be preaching um uh
[47:57] both Services Sunday and uh many of you
[48:00] go out and eat on uh Sunday and a lot of
[48:04] times we don't have service but uh we're
[48:06] going to go ahead and have service just
[48:08] for those who would like to come back if
[48:10] you're going to spend time with your
[48:11] family that's certainly okay and then
[48:15] the Wednesday the 19th not these
[48:17] brothers don't know this so they're
[48:18] going to hear this for the first time
[48:20] and then they got to get back with us to

[48:25] ask brother Andrew to speak speak for us
[48:27] the Wednesday the
[48:29] 19th and then the Sunday the 23rd uh
[48:34] brother Billy will speak for us in the

[49:22] the 10th we've asked brother Cosman to
[49:24] speak for us so if you're not going to
[49:26] be here let us know that's the most
[49:29] advanced notice you're ever going to get
[49:33] so you can sit around and be nervous for
[49:35] a couple weeks and then every time you
[49:37] get a sermon ready somebody will come up
[49:40] in front of you and preach it and then
[49:42] you you think oh my but I found out
[49:45] something you can preach the exact same
[49:48] sermon every Sunday and somebody will be
[49:51] blessed because it's not the words that
[49:53] bless you it's The Giver of the words
[49:56] it's his presence that bless you so
[49:58] let's go ahead we want to turn to two
[50:01] scriptures um this evening and and read
[50:07] I I didn't know if if is brother Tim did
[50:10] he is brother Tim here out of town well
[50:12] brother Tim wherever you are happy
[50:13] birthday Tim turned 40 today so we're
[50:17] really uh grateful for that and uh but
[50:21] let us read what Jesus says here in uh
[50:27] in Matthew the fourth chapter in the
[50:31] fourth verse and I I all these verses
[50:35] that have become very common to us that
[50:39] we just speak out uh so quickly the
[50:44] they're starting to come back to me and
[50:47] I'm starting to think through them you
[50:50] you know what I mean and can find out
[50:52] that here's the simple verse but there's
[50:55] God's head in that simplicity so let's
[50:58] read this I think you all know this by
[51:00] heart Jesus answered and said it is
[51:06] written man shall not live by bread
[51:11] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[51:15] out of the mouth of God now that was
[51:18] written in Deuteronomy 8
[51:20] and3 so Jesus says it is written so I
[51:24] want I want you to catch that now now
[51:27] Jesus is what quoting the
[51:30] scripture so and and then so that's what
[51:34] he said and then I also want to read
[51:36] over in Hebrews another scripture that's
[51:39] very uh we we know so well and that's
[51:43] Hebrews chapter
[51:51] 11 and the sixth
[51:53] verse and it says
[51:56] but without faith it is impossible to
[52:00] please
[52:01] him for he that cometh to God must
[52:06] believe that he
[52:08] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[52:12] that diligently seek Him Heavenly Father
[52:16] we ask you to bless your word to us this
[52:19] evening in Jesus precious name we pray
[52:23] amen God bless you may be seated and and
[52:30] so as I looked at this scripture and the
[52:34] the if I had a thought or a little
[52:37] thought for us this evening uh trying
[52:39] not to uh take us uh too long is that it
[52:46] it's called living by the
[52:49] word living by the word and and our
[52:54] heart's desire is as we are uh speaking
[52:58] into the uh scriptures and
[53:00] fellowshipping with the church is that
[53:04] we're we want to grow our faith so where
[53:09] we can live by faith and living by the
[53:13] word is living by faith whe When you
[53:17] live by the word you live by faith so if
[53:22] we if if if it's impossible to please
[53:25] God with without faith then the only way
[53:29] that you can really please God is living
[53:34] by the word Peter wrote it this way and
[53:38] he spoke in the scriptures and he said
[53:40] it's by these exceedingly great and
[53:44] precious promises that we become
[53:48] partakers of divine nature and and so I
[53:53] think this is everything that we've have
[53:56] and listening to our messenger say and
[54:00] everything that that we're believing in
[54:02] our hearts our hearts desire is to grow
[54:08] into the nature of the Lord Jesus Christ
[54:12] to be more Christlike to live by the
[54:16] word of God and and that's what Jesus
[54:20] said he says we don't live by bread
[54:22] alone so we don't live by bread alone we
[54:26] live by every word that proceedeth out
[54:30] of the mouth of God therefore we live by
[54:33] the word of God so here's Jesus in a
[54:37] situation where he's being
[54:39] tempted uh he's weak and we heard our
[54:42] Prophet tell us the minute you get
[54:43] tempted the minute you get down the
[54:46] minute he thinks he's got a little bit
[54:48] of advantage on you that's when he
[54:50] really puts forth his attack now that's
[54:54] something to know
[54:57] right because if you know that then you
[54:59] can live by that you can actually sit
[55:03] back and say I'm a little down now I'm a
[55:06] little weary now uh uh but the and the
[55:11] enemy is going to attack me
[55:13] now but but we know that uh the Lord
[55:17] knoweth what we have need of even before
[55:20] we ask and we can cast our cares upon
[55:24] Him for he carth for us us you see now
[55:27] you're living by the word you're living
[55:31] by the word it's the only way that you
[55:33] can please God is to live by the word
[55:36] because our goal is right I mean what
[55:40] we're called to do whether through death
[55:43] or
[55:45] through remaining here on Earth we are
[55:48] really called to be a part of the
[55:52] Resurrection we we're not going to be a
[55:54] part of the second death you know he
[55:57] that is born to the spirit of God he he
[56:00] he doesn't die you know what I mean and
[56:03] that's what that's what we want we don't
[56:05] want that second death we don't want
[56:07] that uh be be consumed by that fire we
[56:12] we want that eternal life that's in Us
[56:16] in each of us now that eternal life is
[56:19] in us because God put us here that this
[56:23] eternal life might be
[56:26] manifested and and so if eternal life is
[56:30] manifested then what was in the
[56:33] beginning was the word and the Word was
[56:36] with God and the Word was God so there's
[56:40] no way you can be like God and not live
[56:43] by the
[56:45] word cuz that's what he said man doesn't
[56:48] live by bread alone but he lives by
[56:51] every word that proceedeth out of the
[56:55] mouth of God that's what he lives by
[56:58] that's what be that's what his faith is
[57:01] in because without faith it's impossible
[57:04] to please God and what's God asking you
[57:06] to put your faith in he's not asking you
[57:09] to come up with a
[57:12] conclusion or a
[57:14] result or a
[57:18] want you hear me and say now I'm going
[57:21] to believe that this comes to pass
[57:26] that that's not what that's just not
[57:29] what he's
[57:36] uh that that's just uh not what he's uh
[57:42] asked us to
[57:43] do he hasn't asked us to to have faith
[57:49] in what that we can come up with I want
[57:53] this oh Lord God I want that new truck
[57:57] Lord oh I I I believe God e and I really
[58:02] want this thing and I'm going to have
[58:04] faith that that I get I I get that I get
[58:08] that truck no okay that that approaching
[58:11] by the word of God every good and
[58:13] perfect thing comes from the father
[58:16] above the Lord knows what I have need
[58:20] of you know what I mean and if you don't
[58:23] need it
[58:26] you know maybe some of what you have
[58:28] might go to someplace else like give
[58:31] alms to the
[58:32] poor you know mean so your life starts
[58:36] to change because you know the only way
[58:39] that you can reach that Perfection
[58:42] because if the same spirit that was in
[58:45] him dwelleth in you that's what'll
[58:48] Quicken your mortal body what was the
[58:51] spirit that dwelt in the Lord he said I
[58:54] do nothing in tell the word the father
[58:58] reveals it to
[59:01] me so he lived by the
[59:04] word remember he was going down he says
[59:07] I have need to go by this place and one
[59:10] of the greatest Bible stories for our
[59:12] age that was ever spoken the woman at
[59:15] the
[59:16] well because he had need to go by there
[59:19] he was led by there why was that he was
[59:22] led by there and lived by that word so
[59:27] in this day it became his
[59:30] identification of Discerning the
[59:33] thoughts and the intense of the
[59:35] heart right so now God's looking for
[59:38] good
[59:39] people because we've come up through all
[59:42] the church ages right all the teachings
[59:45] all the doctrines and we've got to the
[59:47] place where we think faith is what what
[59:51] we quote unquote what we believe
[59:57] you know that's what faith is but the
[1:00:00] faith
[1:00:01] that that God is looking the faith that
[1:00:05] it's impossible to please him
[1:00:08] without is the one that diligently seeks
[1:00:13] what he
[1:00:16] said and then lives by it when you live
[1:00:20] by something right that that means that
[1:00:23] now you're decision making
[1:00:27] Your
[1:00:28] Atmosphere your attitude your
[1:00:32] approach everything that you do is based
[1:00:36] on that
[1:00:40] word because you're living by it okay so
[1:00:44] there there's
[1:00:46] a the only way we can
[1:00:48] manifest him is by manifesting what that
[1:00:53] he is
[1:00:56] and what is he he's the
[1:00:59] word he's the thoughts of God expressed
[1:01:03] he he was the that those thoughts became
[1:01:08] tangible in life form that we could look
[1:01:12] upon him and see what he did how that he
[1:01:18] acted how that he approached things what
[1:01:23] that he taught and then we can look
[1:01:25] there and say there's the word okay
[1:01:28] that's the word he was our
[1:01:31] example he was the first
[1:01:34] fruits uh uh that was of the
[1:01:37] Resurrection that was that we saw what
[1:01:40] that life did it quickened his mortal
[1:01:43] body and brought him out of the Grave
[1:01:45] because he was obedient to that word see
[1:01:48] we're not in a battle with the word
[1:01:51] we're in the battle with our
[1:01:54] flesh cuz the FLH Wars against the
[1:01:57] spirit Jesus even said the spirit is
[1:02:00] willing but the flesh is
[1:02:02] weak so so this is the the thing that I
[1:02:06] think is is is so in important for us to
[1:02:11] understand is what it means to live by
[1:02:15] the
[1:02:17] word that's why he told Timothy study to
[1:02:20] show yourself
[1:02:21] approved how that you might
[1:02:23] answer every man
[1:02:29] now so just think the scripture tells us
[1:02:32] be slow to
[1:02:34] speak be slow to
[1:02:37] wrath wait on your wrath you know what I
[1:02:42] mean uh don't don't cast your pearls be
[1:02:47] before dogs you know you just you don't
[1:02:50] always just testify cuz testifying makes
[1:02:53] you feel good that you're preaching
[1:02:56] yourself a
[1:02:57] sermon you know and you like it and you
[1:02:59] walk up said I really told them and I
[1:03:01] really told them and I you know the
[1:03:06] whole scripture is subjection to the
[1:03:09] word take no thought what you would say
[1:03:12] but father the spirit will give you
[1:03:14] utterance to speak the things when you
[1:03:16] start living by
[1:03:19] that I'll tell you one of the hardest
[1:03:21] ones is take no thought for tomorrow
[1:03:27] true it's tremendous so we see that
[1:03:32] Abraham right was the was the father of
[1:03:37] faith in other words Abraham
[1:03:41] lived by the promise that God gave
[1:03:45] him now now this is me inserting
[1:03:51] myself into the conversation does
[1:03:54] everybody understand that I'm not
[1:03:56] this isn't thus sayith the Lord but I
[1:03:58] I'm I'm going to think about Abraham
[1:04:02] living by the word of God how many knows
[1:04:06] that by the time
[1:04:09] Abraham
[1:04:11] uh got to his age that he was a a rich
[1:04:18] man he didn't know that he had lots of
[1:04:23] cattle he had sheep
[1:04:26] do you know what I
[1:04:28] mean and he
[1:04:30] was he he he he he Liv because he lived
[1:04:34] now can you imagine him moves to this
[1:04:37] town and and he from the land of ER and
[1:04:40] he comes to this land and he says you
[1:04:43] know I'm going to be the father of
[1:04:44] Nations i' better start buying up some
[1:04:51] stuff he's living by the word I better
[1:04:54] get some land here I better get some
[1:04:57] sheep I've got a whole nation to feed I
[1:05:00] got to get some cattle I I better make
[1:05:03] friends with everybody around me I
[1:05:06] better start doing favors and and and
[1:05:09] going and helping people because pretty
[1:05:11] soon I'm going to I'm going to have many
[1:05:14] uh many family members here and we're
[1:05:16] going to have to get around in in the
[1:05:19] community you know he his whole
[1:05:23] nature and his whole being
[1:05:26] and his whole approach took on a
[1:05:29] completely different view of Life simply
[1:05:34] because he was
[1:05:36] living by The Word of
[1:05:41] Promise and I like the way brother RM
[1:05:43] tells the story he went down to the
[1:05:45] doctor and said Doctor you got any room
[1:05:49] in the
[1:05:50] hospital uh me and Sarah are going to
[1:05:52] have a
[1:05:53] baby and then he comes back 25 years
[1:05:57] later and says is that room still
[1:05:59] available now there's a man that's
[1:06:02] living by the
[1:06:04] word living by the word so we know that
[1:06:08] we receive the word of God in this
[1:06:10] message this hour the message of the
[1:06:13] hour what God's looking for is men and
[1:06:16] women that live by that word live by
[1:06:21] what that was spoken that becomes their
[1:06:25] life and and now they can put their
[1:06:28] light on a hill and let their light so
[1:06:31] shine among men because what was the
[1:06:34] word of God the word of God was the what
[1:06:37] the light of
[1:06:40] men right it it's the only thing uh that
[1:06:45] gave guidance to
[1:06:47] mankind of the way to go the wages of
[1:06:51] sin is death but the gift of God is
[1:06:54] eternal life through Christ Christ Jesus
[1:06:56] so the only way that you can be a
[1:07:00] light is to live by the
[1:07:03] word because the word is the light of
[1:07:06] men and there it doesn't do you how much
[1:07:09] theology you speak or how many words you
[1:07:12] speak because your actions speak louder
[1:07:14] than your
[1:07:16] words so if you're living by the word
[1:07:20] now you become
[1:07:24] ambassadors of the
[1:07:26] Kingdom and there is a
[1:07:29] kingdom and what he remember he talked
[1:07:32] about our Prophet talked about those
[1:07:33] great expansion Bridges you know going
[1:07:36] from here to there like I always said
[1:07:38] every road in the world leads back to my
[1:07:44] house whether it's in Maine or
[1:07:48] Canada you can go all the way to Points
[1:07:51] North the farthest Road up there tell
[1:07:54] there's no roads in any further in
[1:07:57] Canada the edge of the uh the Northwest
[1:08:01] Territory and that road leads to my
[1:08:03] front
[1:08:06] door you say well what happens if you
[1:08:08] come to a dead end go back the way you
[1:08:13] came isn't that what the prophet of God
[1:08:15] said if you get someplace and you you're
[1:08:18] stuck go back to where you left them go
[1:08:22] back to where you found them that then
[1:08:25] you start living by that you when when
[1:08:29] didn't he say to be certain of God and
[1:08:32] then when you when everything comes
[1:08:34] against you or you you reach obstacles
[1:08:37] or you find yourself in a spot you don't
[1:08:39] know whether to turn right or left what
[1:08:41] did he say he says you get
[1:08:44] down right you turn every
[1:08:48] stone you make everything
[1:08:52] right and
[1:08:54] then you
[1:08:56] stand there right and be certain of God
[1:09:01] be
[1:09:02] still right because you know that he's
[1:09:05] God you know that he promised you he
[1:09:09] wouldn't leave you nor forsake you but
[1:09:12] he be with you even in you to the end
[1:09:15] now those are Idle Words unless there's
[1:09:19] somebody doing
[1:09:22] it be not hearers of the word but be
[1:09:27] doers of the word live the word live the
[1:09:31] message live what's in those books take
[1:09:34] those sayings and those statements and
[1:09:38] those little nuggets of of the of wisdom
[1:09:44] and knowledge that infolded into the the
[1:09:48] word of God and live by
[1:09:51] it make your decision based on that that
[1:09:56] word not a predetermined
[1:10:01] outcome not a
[1:10:03] goal that you're trying to reach by
[1:10:06] doing
[1:10:08] it now I'm going to do this because I'm
[1:10:13] expecting a
[1:10:15] result no you do it because he said
[1:10:20] so it's all he
[1:10:23] wants I'm going to live by this word I'm
[1:10:26] going to do what it says and and and
[1:10:30] Abraham he he you know he he lived he
[1:10:34] lived by the word of God there're just
[1:10:36] some some wonderful statements that I I
[1:10:39] thought were so marful he says now he
[1:10:43] says now that's a genuine believer when
[1:10:46] the Holy Spirit not some
[1:10:50] persuaded by some other people or not
[1:10:53] some other thing
[1:10:56] so you're not
[1:10:57] persuaded you're not persuaded in
[1:11:03] to taking the
[1:11:05] word to try to achieve a desired
[1:11:13] outcome okay because we're not making no
[1:11:15] thoughts for
[1:11:18] tomorrow we're not making plans the evil
[1:11:21] of the day is sufficient thereof we're
[1:11:24] not taking no thought of Tomorrow we're
[1:11:28] not stacking and manipulating the word
[1:11:31] and trying to place it that we might
[1:11:33] have influence over somebody or or or or
[1:11:37] we might build a shell around us or we
[1:11:40] might try to uh to to get advantage over
[1:11:47] somebody
[1:11:49] no we're going to live by that
[1:11:53] word I'm going to live by it I'm going
[1:11:57] to be subject to it I'm going to obey it
[1:12:01] I'm going to I'm not just going to hear
[1:12:03] it but I'm going to do it without
[1:12:07] any any
[1:12:10] idea what the result is except that you
[1:12:14] know that you diligently sought him
[1:12:18] right and he's a
[1:12:22] rewarder so you know the reward is going
[1:12:26] to be his it's not going to be
[1:12:33] yours in other words I did this or I
[1:12:37] built this or I got
[1:12:40] this no what what is it that you would
[1:12:45] like what is the purpose father I don't
[1:12:50] know I don't know what the purpose is in
[1:12:54] me
[1:12:55] obeying this
[1:12:57] word it don't look to
[1:13:00] me like it would be something that I
[1:13:04] would do or that I think will
[1:13:09] work it doesn't it doesn't seem to me to
[1:13:14] agree with my
[1:13:16] adversary is a smart
[1:13:21] move but that's what the word said to do
[1:13:24] agree with your adversary quickly unless
[1:13:26] you play the utmost
[1:13:28] farling so you say how is this going to
[1:13:31] work I don't
[1:13:34] know but I live by
[1:13:37] it I agree quickly I don't get into a
[1:13:42] battle that's right right I I like I I'm
[1:13:46] I'm slow to wrath I'm slow to
[1:13:50] speak you know I I I turn the other
[1:13:53] cheek I'm living all this I'm doing all
[1:13:57] this this is this word now has become my
[1:14:04] mind let this mind be in you that was in
[1:14:08] Christ Jesus so what was the mind when
[1:14:11] all this was tempted the mind that was
[1:14:13] in Jesus was the word it is written it
[1:14:17] says over in
[1:14:19] Deuteronomy that that man don't live by
[1:14:22] what you're offering me
[1:14:25] he offered him kingdoms he offered him
[1:14:29] wealth he offered him jobs he offered
[1:14:31] him glory he he offered him all those
[1:14:34] things and and and he just sits back and
[1:14:37] he says
[1:14:40] no we don't live by those things we live
[1:14:44] by every word that proceeds out of the
[1:14:48] mouth of God and so what did he do he he
[1:14:51] became subject right and obedient even
[1:14:55] even unto the death of the
[1:14:58] cross for this cause I have come into
[1:15:01] the world
[1:15:03] okay all the opportunity that was there
[1:15:06] he was living because the word was
[1:15:09] taking him to
[1:15:13] Calvary but he knew something else right
[1:15:17] it is
[1:15:18] written I shall not suffer my Holy
[1:15:23] One that's right Amen to be corrupt I'll
[1:15:28] not suffer my Holy One to to be devoured
[1:15:32] by the skin worms I'll not suffer my
[1:15:34] Holy One he knew that he knew something
[1:15:37] else I have power to lay down my life I
[1:15:40] have power to take it up again when he
[1:15:42] went to Calvary to pay the price for
[1:15:45] your
[1:15:46] sins that what what you deserve for your
[1:15:49] sins he would take that chastisement
[1:15:52] upon him he was going to take those
[1:15:55] stripes so you could sit one day look at
[1:15:59] those stripes and he said you see by
[1:16:03] these Stripes you are
[1:16:09] healed and you don't care what the
[1:16:11] doctor says because you're not living by
[1:16:13] what the doctor
[1:16:16] said I'm not against doctors you do what
[1:16:18] doctor say you know what I mean but if
[1:16:21] the doctor fails that word
[1:16:23] don't H hallelujah thank you Doctor
[1:16:28] you've done everything you can do for me
[1:16:31] the word of God told me to go with you
[1:16:34] as far as you can take me but when you
[1:16:37] can't take me no further I have another
[1:16:41] [Applause]
[1:16:42] physician and it's the word because
[1:16:46] that's what I'm living by I'm living by
[1:16:49] the word
[1:16:55] now it sounds
[1:16:56] great but when that's the only
[1:17:00] thoughts that are in your
[1:17:04] mind you clear every other thought out
[1:17:06] of there every other
[1:17:10] logic every other
[1:17:12] scenario every other
[1:17:17] voice no matter how they spin it no
[1:17:20] matter how they paint it no matter how
[1:17:23] they point it out how much real and
[1:17:26] logical their explanation looks if God
[1:17:30] didn't say it it's a
[1:17:34] lie because if you're living by the word
[1:17:38] you know that man lives by every word
[1:17:40] that proceed us out of the mouth of God
[1:17:42] and let God every word of God be true
[1:17:46] and every word of man be
[1:17:50] alive so now you're living by the word
[1:17:53] this is what the mature
[1:17:55] maturity that God was looking for we
[1:17:59] love the blessing of the spirit we love
[1:18:02] the gifts operating in our midst we love
[1:18:05] praising
[1:18:08] God I don't care if you do five laps
[1:18:11] around the church in two
[1:18:14] minutes but live the
[1:18:19] word don't jump any higher than you live
[1:18:25] don't
[1:18:26] shout any other than the words that are
[1:18:29] proceeding out of your
[1:18:31] mouth that's what he's looking
[1:18:34] for he's looking for the
[1:18:37] faith that people
[1:18:40] live by the word okay God has showed it
[1:18:43] to
[1:18:44] you right the whole church is built on
[1:18:48] Revelation right Peter Flesh and Blood
[1:18:52] have not revealed this to you
[1:18:55] but my father has revealed to what was
[1:18:58] that the word what was he he was the
[1:19:01] word he was the son of God God revealed
[1:19:05] to Peter that Jesus was the son of God
[1:19:09] it was in his heart he saw
[1:19:12] it he believed
[1:19:15] it and he lived by
[1:19:18] it where should I go
[1:19:22] Lord thou alone has the word words of
[1:19:25] eternal life what else am I going to
[1:19:27] feed on what else have you ever even
[1:19:30] thought in your mind of going someplace
[1:19:33] else that doesn't preach this
[1:19:40] message I
[1:19:42] mean I mean if you I probably shouldn't
[1:19:45] say it but if if you went
[1:19:50] online and and pulled
[1:19:53] up some of these Services of Kenneth
[1:19:57] Hagen and and and uh brother Browning
[1:20:02] and and and and some of these guys were
[1:20:06] I mean people are falling on the floor
[1:20:08] laughing and they're sliding out of
[1:20:11] their their benches and they're they're
[1:20:14] dancing I there's one one guy gets and
[1:20:17] I'm sure he's filled with the spirit you
[1:20:19] know he just running and he dances and
[1:20:21] he's comes running down the aisle just a
[1:20:23] dancing and jumps up and stands on the
[1:20:25] pulpit and he's up on the pulpit you
[1:20:28] know uh we got dance frof right up here
[1:20:31] it it'll bust
[1:20:33] but and and you think well that's
[1:20:37] wonderful but if it doesn't profit a man
[1:20:41] anything if his
[1:20:44] thoughts and his
[1:20:47] leadership isn't the word if he's
[1:20:50] looking for that Spirit to lead
[1:20:52] him right then Satan can impersonate any
[1:20:56] gift of God there's one thing that Satan
[1:20:59] can't impersonate and that's the word
[1:21:03] because there's no truth in him he's a
[1:21:07] liar and the father of all
[1:21:10] lies so anything that you believe that
[1:21:14] and live by that not the
[1:21:17] word it's almost a
[1:21:21] lie so we don't judge any of those
[1:21:24] things as long as the life lines up with
[1:21:27] the
[1:21:28] word that's
[1:21:31] all we live by the word of
[1:21:34] God so I just like to read a statement
[1:21:37] so just a a couple of wonderful things
[1:21:40] he
[1:21:41] says and he's he's he's talking
[1:21:46] about uh you know the church re says now
[1:21:49] there was a Believer because he seen it
[1:21:52] he believed it and was fully persuaded
[1:21:57] that thou art the Christ the Messiah the
[1:22:00] word of God for this day and we believe
[1:22:04] that now that's a real
[1:22:06] believer he's talking about Peter th art
[1:22:10] the
[1:22:11] Christ so now because he accepted that
[1:22:15] word he now was a
[1:22:19] participant in The
[1:22:22] Exodus from the law
[1:22:25] to Grace come on now now he wasn't going
[1:22:29] to live by the rules no more the washing
[1:22:34] of pans the wearing of this the wearing
[1:22:37] of that he wasn't going to live under
[1:22:39] the rule of the flesh that kept telling
[1:22:43] him he was a sin but now he realized
[1:22:47] that thou art the Christ the kinsman
[1:22:50] redeemer now I can have your spirit and
[1:22:54] live by Grace because he saw that word
[1:22:59] and lived by it he
[1:23:01] participated in the Exodus of coming out
[1:23:06] just like Moses when he saw that burning
[1:23:09] bush right and he got those Commandments
[1:23:12] and he started Living by what that bush
[1:23:14] told
[1:23:16] him right and then he went into Egypt
[1:23:20] because he was living by that
[1:23:23] word he threw his stick down because the
[1:23:25] word said so right amen those guys threw
[1:23:28] their sticks down he could only do one
[1:23:30] thing right all he e was be
[1:23:34] still he didn't go back and question
[1:23:37] God God why did you make me a
[1:23:41] fool they were all sitting there and
[1:23:43] going cheap musicians
[1:23:45] trick yeah we can do that too that ain't
[1:23:50] nothing just stood there why he's living
[1:23:54] by by the word yes sir God didn't give
[1:23:56] him
[1:23:59] another line yes he didn't give him
[1:24:02] another action he didn't have plan B we
[1:24:06] don't have plan B we got plan a no no we
[1:24:10] don't have plan a we have plan
[1:24:13] W that's what we live by plan W word
[1:24:17] says it I do
[1:24:22] it and the Prophet told me if I take
[1:24:26] that word to be still and know that he's
[1:24:31] God all I got to
[1:24:33] do that's why I love that film so much
[1:24:37] he he's there and he talks about it and
[1:24:39] all all these great preaching and he
[1:24:41] says oh you know I'm going to go over to
[1:24:44] uh Africa in a few T days and I'd sure
[1:24:47] like you all to be uh praying for me and
[1:24:51] uh let me tell you about this life that
[1:24:53] was in the
[1:24:55] uh cancer and it goes up and it swells
[1:24:57] up and and and then he he
[1:25:01] says you know I'm waiting for
[1:25:04] something father if I said anything to
[1:25:08] offend you and then that head rolls
[1:25:11] back like that and he looks up and he
[1:25:16] looks out at the audience and he says
[1:25:17] he's
[1:25:19] here I take every spirit in this
[1:25:22] building and my control in the name of
[1:25:26] Jesus Christ do you think there was a
[1:25:28] spirit in that building that wasn't
[1:25:30] under his
[1:25:33] control why he stood there didn't come
[1:25:37] up with another program the angel of the
[1:25:40] Lord told him to go there preach the
[1:25:42] gospel that he would be with them and
[1:25:45] nothing would stand in his way not even
[1:25:47] cancer that he would know the thoughts
[1:25:49] and intents of the heart of the people
[1:25:52] that he could take them by the hand and
[1:25:54] know what was diseased in that hand and
[1:25:57] he lived by
[1:25:58] it he lived by the first pole the second
[1:26:02] pole and third pole he lived by the word
[1:26:05] that was revealed to him then he gave
[1:26:08] that word to us because the word of God
[1:26:10] comes to a prophet so that we could live
[1:26:13] by it and have the same
[1:26:19] results living by the word of God
[1:26:24] to live by the word of God is to get rid
[1:26:28] of every other
[1:26:29] thought every other idea how many times
[1:26:33] do we hear our messenger say you don't
[1:26:36] have a thought
[1:26:39] coming it's not a rebuke us he's telling
[1:26:43] us something stay with
[1:26:46] it stay with the word Abraham stood with
[1:26:51] it you know stick with it God tells you
[1:26:55] to do something prophet of God said if
[1:26:57] God told you thus sayith the Lord he
[1:26:59] said you move on it
[1:27:01] quick don't you hesitate one
[1:27:04] minute you go do it because you know
[1:27:07] what'll happen the inspiration will
[1:27:10] die and it it
[1:27:14] seasonal when it's
[1:27:16] spoken you got to go when God shows you
[1:27:20] the word live it act on it
[1:27:25] be don't put a plan
[1:27:27] out don't you don't need to do nothing
[1:27:30] you you you know how I loved how he sent
[1:27:32] those disciples
[1:27:34] out okay you guys want to join this
[1:27:36] church sell all that you have and give
[1:27:39] it to the poor and come follow
[1:27:43] me that's what they did that's what Anis
[1:27:46] ananas and saf is all about they held
[1:27:50] back some money instead of moving on the
[1:27:53] word of God
[1:27:54] and they're manifesting the spirit of
[1:27:57] ananas and saf instead of full obedience
[1:28:01] to thus sayith the
[1:28:06] lord they're so spiritual on that they
[1:28:10] can't run it back through the word of
[1:28:12] God and live what the word of God
[1:28:15] says the word of God
[1:28:18] does not fail amen
[1:28:26] there's only one immutable
[1:28:29] truth that God
[1:28:32] canot
[1:28:35] lie so if he said
[1:28:37] it he'll take care of it you don't have
[1:28:41] to take care one thing for
[1:28:44] yourself he said if he send you he's
[1:28:48] obligated to take care of you you're not
[1:28:51] obligated to take care of yourself
[1:28:53] you're not obligated to make plans
[1:28:56] you're not obligated to know what
[1:28:57] yesterday is you're not obligated to
[1:29:00] build your nest and all that you do what
[1:29:02] God says to do God will be
[1:29:07] fantastic cuz our God's
[1:29:10] awesome and people that live his word be
[1:29:14] and take those exceedingly great and
[1:29:16] precious promises now become partakers
[1:29:19] of divine nature what that notice they
[1:29:22] now have divine nature in
[1:29:28] them think of it isn't that what we're
[1:29:32] striving for to come to the full
[1:29:34] maturity of that seed that can give life
[1:29:40] out only one way to do
[1:29:44] it not
[1:29:47] religion not
[1:29:50] service live the word
[1:29:54] live the
[1:29:57] word anyway he he says this
[1:30:00] here he
[1:30:03] said he's talking about Abraham right 65
[1:30:06] years going to the doc doc you still
[1:30:08] holding that hospital
[1:30:11] open it makes you act
[1:30:14] funny your decisions are
[1:30:17] odd to the
[1:30:19] world but it's believer
[1:30:24] no matter how strange it seems the Bible
[1:30:28] said that he was fully persuaded that
[1:30:31] God was able to perform what he said he
[1:30:38] would
[1:30:41] do pully fully persuaded not a make
[1:30:46] believer you know I better get my ducks
[1:30:49] in a row and you know no no
[1:30:54] you know could you imagine Sarah trying
[1:30:56] to look younger and you know going out
[1:31:00] to the teenage store and an old granny
[1:31:04] walking around in young kids clothes and
[1:31:07] you know try not wanting to have a spare
[1:31:09] tire on her head
[1:31:12] and we're going to have a
[1:31:20] baby but look what God did turned him
[1:31:23] young again
[1:31:25] he's got a plan for those that keep his
[1:31:28] listen what he said that ought to be the
[1:31:32] achievement of every believer this
[1:31:36] afternoon God is able to keep every word
[1:31:40] that he said he'd
[1:31:46] do end the
[1:31:50] story God said I am the Lord that health
[1:31:54] all thy diseases I'm God and I cannot
[1:32:01] change you can live by it because he
[1:32:05] doesn't change he doesn't fail that's
[1:32:08] that's that's what he's trying to
[1:32:10] achieve our messenger cried to us over
[1:32:12] and over again back to the word back to
[1:32:15] the word back to the word believe the
[1:32:18] word that's why you've got to get in
[1:32:20] your
[1:32:21] Bibles and read it and I'm I'm going to
[1:32:24] close but I I I I just wanted to to to
[1:32:28] talk about job I like what he said here
[1:32:31] he
[1:32:33] said he said job went through the trial
[1:32:38] and the test his children
[1:32:41] taken everything else taken the church
[1:32:45] members come and accused him of being a
[1:32:47] secret Sinners and tried to say
[1:32:50] everything against him but yet he
[1:32:53] wouldn't listen to any of it he knowed
[1:32:57] he had meant God's
[1:33:00] requirement what did he do he went and
[1:33:02] he killed the sacrifice he laid his
[1:33:05] hands upon it he did exactly what the
[1:33:08] word of God said he knew that that his
[1:33:11] sins were
[1:33:13] transferred to that and that he had
[1:33:16] meant God's requirement and he knew that
[1:33:20] every good and
[1:33:21] perfect gift comes from the father
[1:33:23] father above and God tempteth no
[1:33:29] man and he even said we are not tempted
[1:33:33] above that which we're
[1:33:36] able so when you feel that temptation is
[1:33:40] pushing you to that Brink to give in go
[1:33:44] back to the word and said the word says
[1:33:47] that I have the ability in me now I
[1:33:50] might have to pray and find it I might
[1:33:52] have to give a or two I might have to
[1:33:55] spend some time in my closet but I've
[1:33:58] got the ability cuz he said so and I can
[1:34:02] live by
[1:34:03] [Applause]
[1:34:10] it we are way too me of worthy
[1:34:17] people he said those disciples were men
[1:34:20] of few words
[1:34:24] they just
[1:34:26] lived they just
[1:34:28] lived what they did you look back over
[1:34:32] their lives and they just
[1:34:35] lived and that's what job did listen to
[1:34:39] this this is beautiful I know I read I
[1:34:40] can't get over it he said he met GRE Rus
[1:34:44] he know there was no need of Satan
[1:34:48] trying to tempt him he knowed it was the
[1:34:53] devil
[1:34:57] and as long as Satan can make him
[1:35:01] believe that his
[1:35:03] sickness was his God doing it he had job
[1:35:11] whipped why why did he know it wasn't
[1:35:16] God because it was contrary to the
[1:35:20] word not to the circumstance okay not to
[1:35:24] the picture that the preachers were
[1:35:26] drawing you're a secret sinner we know
[1:35:29] you've got
[1:35:31] something he never accepted
[1:35:34] it and that's what youve got to do
[1:35:36] you've got to
[1:35:39] stop and listen to what's in your
[1:35:43] head because the word of God told us
[1:35:46] that's where the battle is and the
[1:35:49] greatest weapon that he gave us was what
[1:35:52] his word
[1:35:54] live by the word it'll defeat Satan any
[1:35:58] time any place anywhere in any in
[1:36:01] circumstance it is what God gave the
[1:36:05] believer to live
[1:36:07] by praise God it's
[1:36:12] simple it's simple just do what he said
[1:36:16] believe what he said he had meant the
[1:36:19] requirements he believed what he said he
[1:36:22] did it and then he makes statement it
[1:36:24] says nobody can take your place no
[1:36:27] matter how little you are in other words
[1:36:30] I've got word to live did remember our
[1:36:33] Prophet talked about the little spring
[1:36:35] and the watch or the little Jewel how
[1:36:39] important it was to making the whole
[1:36:41] thing work we got to live by that the
[1:36:45] word of God says you're fools to compare
[1:36:47] yourselves one with
[1:36:50] another what is it to you if he terries
[1:36:52] till I come follow th me see this is
[1:36:56] your thinking this is your actions this
[1:36:59] is what you're living by you're living
[1:37:02] by the word this is what God want his
[1:37:06] bride to come
[1:37:08] to of people that didn't move until they
[1:37:13] had thus saith the
[1:37:17] Lord the
[1:37:21] word the word
[1:37:24] oh I hear our Prophet saying it over and
[1:37:26] over again it's the word it's the word
[1:37:29] what was he trying to sell us it's the
[1:37:32] mind of Christ it's the victory of the
[1:37:35] church it's reality it's truth I am the
[1:37:40] resurrection and the life no man cometh
[1:37:43] to me but by the father and our Prophet
[1:37:47] always put that and he was the word amen
[1:37:54] when do you start living by the
[1:37:58] word right
[1:38:01] now you leave those things which are
[1:38:04] behind behind and you press for the
[1:38:07] higher calling that's the word you've
[1:38:10] got to learn to take that word and live
[1:38:13] by it I'm leaving those things which are
[1:38:15] behind behind I'm pressing for the high
[1:38:17] car I didn't leave the word yester
[1:38:20] yesterday so what do we do we cry Aba
[1:38:23] father we confess our sins our sins go
[1:38:27] before us right red meats Red is thrown
[1:38:30] in the sea of God's forgetfulness to be
[1:38:32] remembered no more you got to live by
[1:38:38] that Satan's the accuser of the Brethren
[1:38:42] who can lay anything to the charge of
[1:38:44] God's elect because the seed of God
[1:38:47] remains in
[1:38:48] them God's not looking for some sort of
[1:38:52] fantastic that's right he's not looking
[1:38:56] for some kind of fleshly
[1:38:58] manifestation he's looking for word
[1:39:04] delers word livers it's all he
[1:39:08] wants people that live by the word am no
[1:39:11] matter how little they are no matter how
[1:39:14] unnoticed they go one of the most
[1:39:16] unnoticed people in all of
[1:39:19] Israel is spoken of All Through Time
[1:39:23] because she threw three little
[1:39:26] mites in a
[1:39:30] basket think of it she lived the
[1:39:35] word she wanted to do her part in the
[1:39:38] time of giving didn't have to be a
[1:39:41] lot but oh what a glorious testimony and
[1:39:46] what did Jesus say he said wherever the
[1:39:50] gospel is preached this will be
[1:39:52] mentioned
[1:39:55] so I know I'm preaching the gospel
[1:39:57] because I mentioned it
[1:40:00] Hallelujah I'll take it wherever I can
[1:40:03] get

[1:56:42] good amen so I I leave on my trip the
[1:56:45] 18th I don't I just I know I'm going to
[1:56:48] go do a wedding
[1:56:50] and Mary brother El and he found
[1:56:55] somebody he loves and now he can't live
[1:56:57] without her can you imagine that anyway
[1:57:01] we tried to talk him out of it but
[1:57:02] there's just no way he said if you don't
[1:57:05] do it I'll get somebody else that's a
[1:57:07] Believer right there that's what I like
[1:57:11] anyway so after that we don't know what
[1:57:13] we're doing but normally I would just go
[1:57:16] and I say I'm not going to preach
[1:57:18] anywhere I'm not going to see no
[1:57:19] Believers but this time I the Lord opens
[1:57:23] the door or gets me to find a Believer
[1:57:26] to fellowship with I'm just going to
[1:57:28] approach it with a different attitude so
[1:57:31] if
[1:57:32] you'll uh pray for me on this little
[1:57:36] trip and that God will make it just what
[1:57:40] I need and and if I can be of any
[1:57:42] service to him uh we'd like to do that
[1:57:45] then we're trying to pray about a trip
[1:57:47] to Zambia uh later after the summer
[1:57:50] maybe stop in and see some friends in
[1:57:52] Cape Town and uh we don't know what that
[1:57:56] trip will do but I'm so grateful with
[1:57:58] the ministry that we have here at the
[1:58:00] church to stay with the word of God and
[1:58:03] maybe give me a little freedom to do
[1:58:05] some of the get some of the burdens off
[1:58:07] my heart that I've carried for years and
[1:58:10] this place was a burden we're just about
[1:58:12] finished with that place and you guys
[1:58:14] will have a nice place and and good
[1:58:17] Ministry and good Fellowship good
[1:58:19] deacons trustees and you you're in good
[1:58:22] hands cuz it's the holy spirit that was
[1:58:24] given to lead the church and and we'll
[1:58:28] carry on if the Lord would take me I
[1:58:31] believe the word of God carries on if
[1:58:34] you'll keep me here but I know one thing
[1:58:37] if God wants me here there's not enough
[1:58:40] sickness or Devils to take
[1:58:43] me right and if God wants to take me
[1:58:46] there's not enough medicines and doctors
[1:58:49] to keep me here I want to live by that
[1:58:52] it's the word of God God bless you go in
