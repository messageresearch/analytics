[10:50] [Music]
[10:58] oh to you
[11:01] [Music]
[11:11] are alone
[11:16] [Music]
[11:24] even if I brought a mic too
[11:26] to pray for the opening of the service
[11:28] and read the Psalms
[11:30] [Music]
[11:36] [Music]
[11:46] [Music]
[11:50] go ahead and bow our heads
[11:54] the service to Him Father we so grateful
[11:57] to you for all things Lord we thank you
[12:01] for your faithfulness and how your lord
[12:03] so faithful to meet each need to come by
[12:05] your way to make yourself known to us
[12:08] father we love you and we so grateful
[12:12] for an opportunity that we might come
[12:13] and hear of you Lord that we might come
[12:16] and worship you
[12:18] Lord that we might come and feel your
[12:19] presence Lord take some time and
[12:22] fellowship with you we commit the
[12:24] service to you
[12:25] asking for you to have your perfect way
[12:27] Lord may your word speak May every need
[12:31] be met Lord you knew the needs that
[12:33] walked in that door before
[12:36] you know the victories that are going to
[12:38] walk out that door
[12:40] more than we can ask
[12:42] father we've just depend upon you now to
[12:45] move on the scene
[12:46] worship you
[12:48] give you all the glory pray this in
[12:50] Jesus name
[12:54] so we're going to do this the
[12:55] old-fashioned way this morning a little
[12:57] bit short-handed you want to turn in
[13:00] your Bibles to Psalm chapter 9 this
[13:03] morning
[13:07] you know I thought it was a timely psalm
[13:09] for the hour that we live in
[13:12] you know we seem to be
[13:14] surrounded on every Hand by people who
[13:18] are out of control
[13:20] you know nations are out of control
[13:23] governments are out of control
[13:26] mankind is out of control
[13:28] there's so many encouraging scriptures
[13:31] in just this one chapter
[13:34] you know that can put us put that all in
[13:36] perspective
[13:37] and remind us who's really in control
[13:42] you know we could spend time on every
[13:43] verse you know and probably be blessed
[13:46] by all of them but as I was reading that
[13:47] it was an interesting statement that
[13:49] David bade a couple times
[13:51] which also caught my attention he said
[13:53] it in verse 1 he said I will praise thee
[13:56] O Lord with my whole heart
[13:59] I will show forth all
[14:03] thy marvelous works
[14:06] and then it says in verse 14. that I may
[14:09] show forth all
[14:12] thy praise
[14:15] that I would show forth all thy
[14:17] marvelous works
[14:19] and that I might show forth all thy
[14:22] praise
[14:24] you know as we read when we read this
[14:27] chapter we're going to see that he's got
[14:29] it all under his control
[14:32] you know everything's coming into its
[14:34] position
[14:36] and though may it seem to us and to
[14:38] others in the world that everything is
[14:39] out of control it's coming into his
[14:41] control so has been in his control
[14:45] you know it's not about us getting
[14:47] things under control
[14:49] it says in verse 10
[14:52] he says they that Know Thy Name
[14:55] will put their trust in thee
[14:58] for thou O Lord Hast not forsaken them
[15:01] that feare thee
[15:04] you know whatever it is
[15:06] that may be going on in our lives
[15:09] or going on around us
[15:12] in the world
[15:13] he's got this
[15:17] and they that know his name
[15:20] will put their trust in him
[15:23] and he hasn't forsaken them that fear
[15:25] Him
[15:27] so with all that being said
[15:30] in the midst of the chaos
[15:33] or seeming chaos
[15:35] what was David's part
[15:38] what's our part
[15:41] you know it says verse 1 I will praise
[15:45] him
[15:46] that's part of the role that he plays
[15:49] in verse two I will be glad and rejoice
[15:51] in him
[15:53] I will sing praise to his name
[15:57] in verse 11 it says Sing Praises unto
[16:00] the Lord
[16:02] sing and rejoice and praise
[16:08] you know and we have to do that he's
[16:10] worthy of Our Praise but
[16:13] all his praise
[16:16] all his works is more than that
[16:20] you know our lips our voice our shouting
[16:24] the best singing we can bring the best
[16:26] preaching we can bring is a unworthy
[16:30] instrument
[16:31] for the praise to his name
[16:36] you know in verse 11 it says declare
[16:38] among the people his doings
[16:42] you know we all enjoy a good worship
[16:44] service being able to praise and worship
[16:46] him and enjoy his the moving of his
[16:49] spirit and his word within the four
[16:51] walls of this church
[16:54] but there's more to the job
[16:57] you know something even greater
[17:00] than just celebrating his presence
[17:04] you know if we limit this to what
[17:06] happens in a worship service
[17:08] in the four walls of this church then we
[17:10] haven't performed all his praise
[17:13] we haven't performed all his works
[17:19] are we moving beyond just the praise and
[17:21] the rejoicing and are we making
[17:23] declaration among the people are we
[17:25] showing forth
[17:28] his praise and his works
[17:32] you know it says I will show forth all
[17:34] thy marvelous works that's demonstrate
[17:38] verse 14 I will show forth all thy
[17:41] praise that's demonstrate show
[17:46] you know anyone can
[17:49] enjoy his presence in a good service but
[17:51] when the Music Stops
[17:54] and the church dismisses
[17:56] are we showing forth
[17:58] his praise are we demonstrating
[18:02] showing forth his works
[18:06] you know brother Branham said that the
[18:08] bride would be the final voice
[18:10] to the final age
[18:14] but if the only voice we have
[18:17] is when the music is playing and it's
[18:19] within a church service are we
[18:21] fulfilling all his praise and all his
[18:24] works
[18:28] in other words it's incomplete without
[18:31] the demonstration
[18:33] Isaiah 43 21 says this people
[18:36] have I formed for myself
[18:39] they shall show forth my praise
[18:45] it's in the walk
[18:47] it's in the life
[18:48] it's in the actions
[18:50] it's in the day-to-day
[18:54] demonstration
[18:56] of the presence of the Lord
[18:59] first Peter 2 9 says but ye are a chosen
[19:02] generation
[19:03] a royal priesthood and a holy nation A
[19:07] peculiar people that ye should show
[19:10] forth
[19:12] the Praises of him who hath called you
[19:14] out of Darkness
[19:15] and into His Marvelous Light
[19:18] you know as Paul said in First
[19:19] Corinthians 2 4 it's not about how good
[19:22] we can sing
[19:23] or how well we can preach
[19:26] but it was in power and demonstration
[19:31] as it says in second Corinthians 3 2 an
[19:33] epistle written in our hearts known and
[19:36] read of all men
[19:39] not just the ones in this building
[19:43] you know his people the people that he
[19:45] has formed for himself
[19:48] of whom David numbered himself
[19:51] were constructed to show forth all his
[19:54] works and to show forth all his praise
[19:58] and unless we get to the demonstration
[20:00] of his presence
[20:03] rather than just a celebration of his
[20:05] presence
[20:06] then the work is incomplete
[20:08] it's not all praise it's not all His
[20:11] Marvelous works
[20:13] so as I was reading you know Psalm 9
[20:15] this morning and you know just
[20:17] encouraged by that promise that he's got
[20:19] this he's got it all in control but your
[20:21] part my part
[20:23] is to show forth all his praise
[20:27] to show forth All His Marvelous works
[20:31] as he brings all things under his
[20:32] control
[20:34] so let's just read that together here in
[20:36] Psalm 9. you know that's what stuck out
[20:39] to me I hope that blessed you
[20:41] we'll read that together starting in
[20:43] verse one I will praise thee O Lord with
[20:46] my whole heart I will show forth all thy
[20:49] marvelous works I will be glad and
[20:51] rejoice indeed I will sing praise to thy
[20:54] name O thou most high when my enemies
[20:58] are turned back they shall fall and
[21:00] perish at thy presence for thou has
[21:02] maintained my right and my cause thou
[21:05] saddest in the throne judging right
[21:08] thou has rebuked the Heathen thou has
[21:10] destroyed the wicked thou has put out
[21:13] their name forever and ever o thou enemy
[21:16] destructions are come to a Perpetual end
[21:19] and thou has destroyed cities their
[21:21] memorial is perished with them but the
[21:24] Lord shall endure forever he hath
[21:26] prepared his throne for judgment and he
[21:29] shall judge the world in righteousness
[21:31] he shall Minister judgments to the
[21:33] people in uprightness the Lord also will
[21:36] be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge
[21:39] in times of trouble and they that Know
[21:41] Thy Name will put their trust in thee
[21:43] for thou Lord has not forsaken them that
[21:46] seek thee sing praises to the Lord which
[21:49] dwelleth in Zion declare among the
[21:52] people his doings when he maketh
[21:54] Inquisition for blood he rememareth them
[21:56] he forgetth not the Cry Of The Humble
[21:59] have mercy upon Me O Lord consider my
[22:03] trouble which I suffer of them that hate
[22:05] me thou that liftest me up from the
[22:07] gates of death that I may show forth all
[22:10] thy praise in the gates of the daughter
[22:12] of Zion I will rejoice in thy salvation
[22:15] the Heathen are sunk down to the pit
[22:18] that they made in the net which they hid
[22:20] is their own foot taken the Lord is
[22:23] known by the Judgment which he executed
[22:25] the wicked is snared in the work of his
[22:27] own hands Higgin Sila the wicked shall
[22:31] be turned into hell and all the nations
[22:33] that forget God for the needy shall not
[22:36] always be forgotten the expectation of
[22:39] the poor shall not perish forever arise
[22:42] O Lord let not man Prevail let the
[22:45] Heathen be judged in thy sight put them
[22:48] in fear O Lord that the nations may know
[22:50] themselves to be but men see them
[22:58] foreign

[44:20] in our midst
[44:22] to do for us exceedingly and abundantly
[44:25] above what we could ask or think
[44:29] father there's
[44:30] no ability in man to
[44:35] even make contact with you
[44:38] you have to open the door and
[44:42] you have to administer Your Love
[44:45] and we're so thankful that you so loved

[45:05] it's not based on emotion
[45:07] it's not based on feeling it's based on
[45:11] thus saith the Lord we ask you now to
[45:14] grant us your presence in a continual
[45:17] revelation of yourself this morning in
[45:21] Jesus precious name we pray amen amen
[45:25] God bless you if you have your Bibles
[45:27] this morning I'm
[45:29] excited about
[45:32] going through the word with you this
[45:35] morning and and uh fellowshipping around
[45:39] the things of the Lord
[45:41] you know I I
[45:45] find it sometimes that I I I get I
[45:49] watched other people do things and you
[45:51] want to uh a lot of times you want to
[45:54] compare yourself or or you kind of get
[45:57] jealous that you don't go from one end
[46:00] of the platform to the other and you
[46:02] don't have it but I don't have that
[46:05] anymore
[46:06] I used to think I had it but now there's
[46:10] one thing I know that I have and I have
[46:12] a message
[46:15] that God sent
[46:17] and we can all look at that together
[46:20] and it feeds us all the same and it'll
[46:23] be a blessing to us so let's turn in our
[46:26] Bible to Isaiah
[46:27] the uh
[46:29] seventh chapter of the book of Isaiah
[46:32] starting at the 10th verse
[46:37] just bible study this morning
[46:41] going through some quotations and
[46:44] um and fellowshipping around some
[46:47] nuggets we have a lot in Louisiana and
[46:50] some on vacation but we're here
[46:54] and we can have a good time in the Lord
[46:57] amen
[46:58] and to me a good time in the Lord is the
[47:01] opening of his word amen so it says in
[47:05] Isaiah the seventh chapter in the 10th
[47:09] verse it says moreover the Lord
[47:13] spake again
[47:15] that ahaz saying
[47:18] ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God
[47:23] ask it either in the depth or in the
[47:28] Heights above
[47:30] but he has said I will not ask neither
[47:34] will I tempt the Lord
[47:37] and he said hear ye now o House of David
[47:42] it is a small thing for you to wear him
[47:47] in
[47:48] but will ye weary My God also
[47:52] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[47:55] you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[47:59] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[48:03] his name Emmanuel father bless your word
[48:07] to us in your precious name we pray amen
[48:10] amen God bless you you may be seated
[48:13] this morning
[48:15] once again we can continually to thank
[48:20] you for tolerating the construction
[48:24] where it's starting to go slow uh if
[48:28] ever if you all pray real hard
[48:30] and everything goes good next week we
[48:34] hope that we can start pouring concrete
[48:36] here a week from next not this next week
[48:41] but possibly the week or so after start
[48:44] that and and then if everything goes
[48:48] good maybe we'll have some parking by
[48:51] the time that our meetings come that's
[48:55] November 11th 12th and 13th but we're
[48:58] going to have to move some mountains how
[49:01] many beliefs we can move mountains
[49:06] oh boy we're running on about a quarter
[49:08] of a tank all right well praise God you
[49:12] know why God don't have churches because
[49:14] he says it just takes two or three to
[49:17] agree on any one thing see he's not
[49:19] gonna he's not gonna let us be stalled
[49:22] out by the unbelief don't stop God but I
[49:26] say get enthused join in the the thing
[49:29] and if and and we'll just press and
[49:33] trust the Lord uh I'm excited about this
[49:36] this morning sharing this with you uh
[49:40] and and it just it's a beautiful message
[49:43] it it came on my heart and last uh
[49:47] Wednesday night I believe we listened to
[49:50] the uh message the oncoming storm
[49:55] and and we noticed in listening to that
[49:58] sermon we noticed how that there was so
[50:01] many parallels
[50:03] in that message preached in 1960 that it
[50:09] uh it was almost like it was just
[50:12] directed exactly for the time that were
[50:16] we were sitting here today it had storms
[50:20] in Florida
[50:22] right it had talking of nuclear uh war
[50:27] and destruction how many knows our
[50:28] president was speaking the other day and
[50:31] told a a large group of people he says
[50:36] that were on the doorsteps of Armageddon
[50:38] right
[50:41] right well you know
[50:44] even so come quickly
[50:46] Lord Jesus
[50:48] amen amen that that's a good thing for
[50:51] us for those that are going up
[50:54] you know it might not be too bad for
[50:57] everybody else but for us it's going up
[50:59] and we noticed in that sermon how it
[51:02] talked about disease but what he was
[51:05] talking about was that
[51:08] people fail to heed the warning
[51:12] that there were that he talked about how
[51:14] the the the
[51:16] whether prophets he called him to go out
[51:19] and get all the signs and all the data
[51:23] and everything and then they tell the
[51:25] people there's an oncoming storm there's
[51:29] there there's there's uh coming it's
[51:32] just like we have these Sirens that go
[51:34] off it's because all the conditions are
[51:37] right for a tornado for a a a a twister
[51:43] and you'll see the dark clouds and
[51:45] you'll start to see them swirl I've seen
[51:48] many a little hook come down out of the
[51:50] cloud and everything's right that the
[51:54] conditions are right and when the
[51:56] conditions are right for something you
[51:58] take heed you know what I mean you take
[52:01] warning and we also heard another
[52:04] beautiful nugget he said there's no need
[52:07] of giving a warning unless there's a
[52:11] place safety to run to
[52:15] in other words it wouldn't be a warning
[52:18] if you couldn't do something or make
[52:22] some uh sort of preparation to avoid uh
[52:29] what is being warned about so there's a
[52:32] warning given so there's got to be a
[52:34] place of of shelter and that's what they
[52:38] do why do they put the sirens out that
[52:40] it's it's it's to tell you take heed
[52:43] find a place of safety and and they give
[52:47] all the instructions about which a place
[52:50] of safety is go to the center of the
[52:52] house you know we have that little
[52:54] bathroom in the center of our house you
[52:56] know what I mean and and We've ran in
[52:59] there a time or two you know and maybe
[53:01] you bring a mattress in there with you
[53:03] or some pillows or or whatever and the
[53:06] wind's blowing and the tops of the trees
[53:08] are coming out and and boy you learn to
[53:11] pray
[53:14] I think that would be good if we had a
[53:16] few more tornadoes come through the
[53:19] neighborhood and and and maybe get a get
[53:23] Earnest with God learn how how to pray
[53:26] and so there's got to be a place of
[53:29] safety
[53:31] else the warnings of no avail
[53:34] you know
[53:36] what are you telling me in other words
[53:37] it's not as it's not a sentence of
[53:41] Destruction how would you like if the if
[53:43] the flash came over the news in a few
[53:47] minutes you will be no more
[53:50] there's a storm coming and there's
[53:52] nowhere to avoid it there's no place to
[53:55] run why you can tell that to the world
[53:59] today there's only one place to run and
[54:01] that's Christ
[54:03] when he preached the great message
[54:05] choosing of the Bride he says o Los
[54:08] Angeles Los Angeles dogs and felt that
[54:10] thou self above the city of Ames but
[54:13] Thou shalt be brought into the lowest
[54:15] tale and and and he said flee
[54:19] flee into Christ that's your only place
[54:23] of safety so we understood that by that
[54:26] sermon that
[54:28] that God
[54:31] sends warning and and what we took out
[54:35] of it as a congregation was are are we
[54:41] um
[54:42] in tune or hearing or seeing on or
[54:47] understanding the warnings
[54:51] you understand so we we know that uh and
[54:55] we'll get into this a little bit this
[54:56] morning but
[54:58] we we know that the message has a great
[55:03] great teaching
[55:05] teaching of the godhead
[55:07] teaching of water baptism
[55:10] teaching of of uh
[55:13] the gifts of the Spirit and the
[55:15] evidences of the spirit at the teachings
[55:18] of the church ages and who The
[55:21] Messengers are it has the opening of the
[55:24] seals that is the Revelation and the
[55:28] revealing of the son of perdition and
[55:30] how that God stood in his Seven Ages we
[55:34] have those great parts of the message
[55:36] but within the framework of the message
[55:40] is also a warning to his sheep of what
[55:45] to be a wary of
[55:48] you understand what to be aware of and
[55:53] and that we need to we need to be able
[55:56] to heed the warning
[55:59] heed the warning so uh this message that
[56:03] we're going to Fellowship in this
[56:06] morning is a message that brother bran
[56:08] preached uh 11 29 up 63 called the super
[56:14] sign and I I just felt in my heart I
[56:18] felt led to to go this way to listen to
[56:21] this message
[56:22] it came on my heart and
[56:25] and uh I always try to when it comes to
[56:28] the time when I start waiting for a
[56:31] sermon that's the way that I do I wait
[56:33] for a sermon I ask the Lord what would
[56:35] you have me bring to the people you know
[56:38] I I don't try to go and make a sermon
[56:43] and then
[56:45] present it in such a manner that it's
[56:49] acceptable all right
[56:52] okay so what I do is I just wait on the
[56:55] Lord and and usually I look for the
[56:58] direction from the Lord to the message
[57:02] to a message and those of that have
[57:06] known me for a long time you know I
[57:09] usually stay within the framework of one
[57:11] message I I don't try to go take a lot
[57:14] from this message and a lot from this
[57:16] message because I feel that the message
[57:19] was given with a message
[57:24] and if you can get the message that's in
[57:28] the message then you've accomplished a
[57:31] lot now I find out that there's a lot
[57:33] more message in a message than I'm
[57:36] capable of comprehending but I still try
[57:40] to to glean from it and so there was
[57:43] many things that stood out to me in this
[57:47] in this uh
[57:49] this message and uh and so I I just kind
[57:53] of want to go through it uh with you
[57:56] this morning and and and fellowship with
[57:59] these things and we want to kind of
[58:01] still hold that standpoint of
[58:05] recognizing the warning and and our
[58:08] messenger preached a message to us he
[58:11] called recognizing your day and its
[58:14] message
[58:15] and uh so uh that's a very good uh
[58:21] thought to understand that God's got
[58:24] something for us and so as we we start
[58:27] this little uh sermon out uh of course
[58:31] we just read the same scriptures that
[58:34] brother Branham read and he makes he
[58:38] makes this statement in paragraph tell
[58:40] 12 uh if the brothers are more than
[58:43] welcome to put these uh
[58:46] paragraphs up there because my heart
[58:49] says are is that you identify with the
[58:52] message
[58:53] that the message becomes something to
[58:56] you that you know it can be understood
[59:00] by you and revealed to you by God
[59:06] that it is the The Source uh uh in its a
[59:12] way that God hath chosen to speak to you
[59:16] so you can you can find out that you can
[59:19] be in many many circumstances life
[59:22] circumstances different circumstances I
[59:26] remember one time that uh we were
[59:29] considering
[59:31] um you know whether
[59:33] we should uh put our daughter in
[59:37] gymnastics or or or or something like
[59:40] that you know and this is years and
[59:43] years ago uh she's just a young girl at
[59:46] that time and we didn't have all the
[59:49] tapes available to us we didn't have
[59:51] them on online if if you wanted to
[59:55] listen to a tape I got reel to reels and
[59:58] and you got out the machine and you
[1:00:00] threaded it and you started playing it
[1:00:03] you know and you prayed that your player
[1:00:05] was good enough it wouldn't eat it up
[1:00:07] the tape and and you listen and at that
[1:00:12] time uh brother Doug mccuse and Roy
[1:00:15] borders begin to print brother random's
[1:00:19] messages in their garage in Tucson
[1:00:22] Arizona that was the beginning of the
[1:00:25] spoken word and then they got to
[1:00:27] Jeffersonville and they began to print
[1:00:29] out books and they begin to say send
[1:00:32] them out and you would get on the
[1:00:34] mailing list and then every month or or
[1:00:37] so maybe every two months a message book
[1:00:41] would come
[1:00:43] and and that's how you learned
[1:00:46] you know you just didn't pick a word
[1:00:50] you know what I mean and then go to 50
[1:00:53] different messages no you had to sit
[1:00:56] there and read the whole message you
[1:00:58] know what I mean and I I feel that's
[1:01:01] part of the problem is that people
[1:01:03] aren't getting the message that's in
[1:01:07] each message
[1:01:08] because they've chopped it all up into
[1:01:11] quotes
[1:01:13] it's just you here this morning so uh
[1:01:16] you know you know I get on my soapbox
[1:01:18] every now and then but that's I can't
[1:01:21] help myself
[1:01:22] but it you know so they'll have a
[1:01:25] subject matter and and the contents of
[1:01:29] the message
[1:01:30] what the spirit of the word of God is
[1:01:33] that he's trying to present to us the
[1:01:37] the whole picture that he's drawing and
[1:01:40] the placing of the statements and the
[1:01:42] quotes in their context and continuity
[1:01:45] is lost
[1:01:47] but we couldn't do that
[1:01:50] when we got it we we didn't know what
[1:01:52] was in there
[1:01:54] don't you wish you could approach this
[1:01:56] message the same way I think you ought
[1:01:59] to
[1:01:59] I think when you are put on a tape you
[1:02:02] ought to sit there and say I don't know
[1:02:03] what's in here why because there's
[1:02:06] spiritual food in there for you today
[1:02:09] it's a FR it's a fresh cooked meal
[1:02:15] you know what I'm saying and and uh and
[1:02:18] your appetite
[1:02:21] changes things
[1:02:23] Leslie's cooked a lot of the same dishes
[1:02:25] to me over the years but when I'm really
[1:02:28] really hungry man that's just really
[1:02:31] really outstanding you you know what I
[1:02:34] mean it it it's really good at you know
[1:02:37] I told somebody one time I said you know
[1:02:39] I don't really like that they said
[1:02:40] you're not hungry enough yet
[1:02:44] you know that's how I learned to love I
[1:02:46] love deviled eggs now
[1:02:48] wish they weren't called deviled eggs
[1:02:50] but I don't mind eating up the devil so
[1:02:52] uh
[1:02:53] uh it's good but what I was pointing out
[1:02:56] to you is that so I I went to the door
[1:02:59] with this question on my heart
[1:03:03] and opened up
[1:03:05] the book and I can't quote the quote
[1:03:09] exactly right I remember how it spoke to
[1:03:11] me but it was on the lines go ahead and
[1:03:15] let your daughter do such and such and
[1:03:17] turn her into a street walker or
[1:03:19] something of that nature and I got my
[1:03:22] answer
[1:03:23] right there I believe those answers are
[1:03:25] still lying in the framework of God's
[1:03:27] word
[1:03:28] I I think if you have a question on your
[1:03:31] heart a doctrinal question wondering
[1:03:33] something that uh is uh a burden on you
[1:03:39] that the word of God is a place that you
[1:03:42] can go to
[1:03:43] and and my heart's desire is that each
[1:03:46] of you would have that relationship with
[1:03:49] the word of God how old can you be
[1:03:51] Brother David before you can have your
[1:03:54] relationship well I've seen six years
[1:03:56] old choose phones
[1:04:01] I don't care
[1:04:03] when they're old enough to listen to you
[1:04:06] they're old enough to listen to God
[1:04:10] so the the this is what our desire is as
[1:04:14] a pastor is to have a group of people
[1:04:17] that's associated with God's word I
[1:04:20] don't want to do your religion for you
[1:04:23] it's a warning
[1:04:25] it's a curse
[1:04:27] amen second hand Revelation is what's
[1:04:31] holding the church back
[1:04:33] but let us read this statement he says
[1:04:35] it said
[1:04:37] he says here he says but remember God's
[1:04:41] clock will be just exactly on time
[1:04:46] all these things has to be this way
[1:04:50] it has to be all done according to his
[1:04:54] great knowledge his foreknowledge
[1:04:59] for by foreknowledge
[1:05:02] he could predestinate not by his desire
[1:05:09] what a teaching right there God does not
[1:05:13] predestinate by his desire
[1:05:16] he predestinated by foreknowledge
[1:05:20] he knew the beginning from the end he
[1:05:22] knew what you would do he knew the
[1:05:24] mistakes you made because he knew he
[1:05:27] would fall he knew you were shaped in
[1:05:29] sin uh
[1:05:31] born in sin shaped in iniquity came in
[1:05:34] the world speaking lies he made
[1:05:36] Provisions for you he had Grace for you
[1:05:40] he had mercy for you he knew you'd have
[1:05:43] an ear to hear so he made sure you heard
[1:05:46] the word but he doesn't predestinate by
[1:05:49] his desire he is not willing that any
[1:05:53] should perish
[1:05:55] but by his foreknowledge he knew who
[1:05:58] would accept it and who would not
[1:06:02] therefore he can make everything work
[1:06:05] according to his big time clock that's
[1:06:09] clicking away for he could foretell the
[1:06:13] end from the beginning and therefore he
[1:06:17] knew that we would live in this day
[1:06:21] he knew that this would be our day
[1:06:25] and he plans for this day
[1:06:30] and he had plans for this day
[1:06:33] he has plans for every day
[1:06:37] he never has one of his plans ever fail
[1:06:41] he is always on time now that that is a
[1:06:46] a great statement
[1:06:48] because this now
[1:06:51] places you
[1:06:53] in a very serious position
[1:06:58] because God's got plans for your day
[1:07:04] he's got plans for every day he's got a
[1:07:07] plan for this day he's got a plan for
[1:07:10] this hour he's got a plan for this time
[1:07:13] so it would behoove us as followers of
[1:07:18] God's word to question ourselves is what
[1:07:22] is the plan
[1:07:27] and we ought to seek it
[1:07:29] we ought to seek his face we ought to
[1:07:32] seek his will
[1:07:34] what is the will father what is the will
[1:07:37] for the activity of my day what is your
[1:07:41] will for my spirit
[1:07:43] what is your will for my nature what
[1:07:46] what what you've got to plan now I don't
[1:07:51] create a plan and I don't create God's
[1:07:54] plan and and I I can't say dear and tell
[1:07:58] you that what God's plan is for your
[1:08:02] life
[1:08:04] that's something that you've that you as
[1:08:08] an individual needs to work out your own
[1:08:11] salvation with fear and trembling and
[1:08:15] you could remember that God's mindful of
[1:08:18] you so if you were predestinated you
[1:08:20] were predestinated in his foreknowledge
[1:08:23] so he knew you he knew you'd accept it
[1:08:25] he made Provisions for you and he made a
[1:08:28] plan for your life we've went over this
[1:08:31] many times something that he has for you
[1:08:33] to do
[1:08:37] so if you don't seek that plan
[1:08:40] then what you're doing is is you're
[1:08:42] cloaking yourself in religion
[1:08:47] you're saying I believe
[1:08:50] and therefore it's what I believe that
[1:08:54] saves me
[1:08:57] did I make that clear
[1:08:59] in other words it's my doctrine that
[1:09:02] saves me
[1:09:04] it's the teachings that I accept that
[1:09:08] saved me the only
[1:09:10] salvation comes in the person of Jesus
[1:09:15] Christ in your life
[1:09:17] and he cannot reveal himself to you
[1:09:22] personally without him revealing his
[1:09:25] word to you which was his thoughts
[1:09:28] expressed or his plan
[1:09:32] so each of you are important
[1:09:35] and nobody can take your place because
[1:09:38] he has a plan for your life
[1:09:41] he's got a plan for your day
[1:09:44] he's got a plan and we we are in the
[1:09:48] lady of seeing age and so we've got to
[1:09:51] be very careful about being lukewarm and
[1:09:55] thinking that don't matter and
[1:09:57] everything's going to happen just the
[1:09:59] way it's going to happen oh where is the
[1:10:01] sign of his coming everything continues
[1:10:04] on as it is but remember the warning
[1:10:07] Swift destruction
[1:10:10] when they say peace and safety beware
[1:10:14] so we all want to understand this great
[1:10:16] warning
[1:10:19] that that there is and that God has
[1:10:23] given us signs
[1:10:27] and those signs go unnoticed
[1:10:32] and I mean I'll give you a sign he said
[1:10:35] an everlasting sign a great sign a
[1:10:39] virgin shall conceive
[1:10:41] how many think on Earth that that day
[1:10:43] knew a virgin conceived
[1:10:48] the greatest sign that God ever give
[1:10:52] goes unnoticed
[1:10:55] now most of the signs that God give
[1:11:00] go unnoticed
[1:11:02] but you got to remember that you've been
[1:11:06] chosen and elected to seek the signs
[1:11:14] because
[1:11:15] signs do two things they warn you and
[1:11:19] direct you
[1:11:23] so you see a sign and it shows us arrow
[1:11:26] and it's got a little number under it
[1:11:29] 25. that doesn't that means the road is
[1:11:32] quick crooked up ahead and go through
[1:11:36] this safely at 25 miles an hour it
[1:11:39] doesn't mean oh boy a crooked Road I can
[1:11:42] go 50.
[1:11:46] well that's fine if there's nobody else
[1:11:48] maybe
[1:11:50] but people sometimes forget they have
[1:11:52] other people in the car with them that
[1:11:55] they're responsible for other people on
[1:11:57] the road that they're responsible for
[1:11:59] that's why the prophet of God somebody
[1:12:01] that's he says that gets in a car drunk
[1:12:04] ought to be charged with premeditated
[1:12:06] murder because there's zero
[1:12:09] responsibility
[1:12:10] involved so not only are you responsible
[1:12:13] for yourself
[1:12:15] but you're also responsible because you
[1:12:18] are written Epistles red of all men and
[1:12:22] people are watching your life how did
[1:12:25] you respond to the events and signs that
[1:12:30] are transpiring around us
[1:12:34] and we've really got to the place where
[1:12:36] the ministry and and the people and one
[1:12:39] another we don't hold ourselves
[1:12:41] accountable we've lowered the standard
[1:12:44] by which we should live by we've lowered
[1:12:46] our accountability and we've written
[1:12:49] ourselves off just by saying we're
[1:12:52] predestinated
[1:12:54] we're gonna be there
[1:12:57] well you might be there
[1:12:59] but I'd like to be there with full
[1:13:01] reward
[1:13:05] I don't know who's going to be there or
[1:13:07] not
[1:13:08] but it's pretty evident by the gospel
[1:13:11] the people that are going to be there
[1:13:14] are going to be word living people
[1:13:19] and I'm not trying to preach
[1:13:21] condemnation today I'm trying to say
[1:13:24] that just like anybody if you're not
[1:13:26] given a hundred percent then let's pick
[1:13:29] it up a little bit
[1:13:33] if you're not doing your part then let's
[1:13:36] see what your part could be
[1:13:39] we can't
[1:13:41] do one thing about yesterday
[1:13:45] all we can do is cry Abba Father apply
[1:13:49] the blood leave those things which are
[1:13:52] behind behind him what press
[1:13:56] for a higher calling
[1:13:59] that collects our our desire so we we
[1:14:02] point out something in the the title of
[1:14:05] this message is super sign
[1:14:07] now the prophet of God is trying to
[1:14:09] point something out to us he says he
[1:14:12] says this is what we call a superage
[1:14:17] everything that you see nowadays must be
[1:14:20] super
[1:14:22] and I I won't re-continue reading but he
[1:14:26] points out everything super right
[1:14:28] supermarket
[1:14:30] super this super that it's always better
[1:14:34] I I don't even know what a razor blade
[1:14:38] they're on now you know it got track
[1:14:42] five now and and Ultra Glide and Super
[1:14:46] Glide and and and all this stuff pretty
[1:14:49] soon you're just gonna have to open a
[1:14:51] box and your hair is going to fall off
[1:14:53] your face
[1:14:56] everything's super
[1:14:59] you know it's always new and improved
[1:15:01] new and improved well every time I see
[1:15:05] new and improved I wonder what's the
[1:15:06] junk I was using before
[1:15:09] why didn't you do that the first time
[1:15:14] now you might just sit there and not
[1:15:18] uh take heed to that but there's no more
[1:15:22] Corner Grocery Stores
[1:15:25] they're all what supermarket
[1:15:28] and and so and they used to be just
[1:15:31] regular grocery stores right but they're
[1:15:34] not Target anymore what are they now
[1:15:36] Super Target
[1:15:38] Super Walmart
[1:15:42] because everybody buys into better
[1:15:47] that's what that's what it is did you
[1:15:50] know that's a sign
[1:15:54] it's a sign
[1:15:56] of the time
[1:15:58] and I just like to read these things to
[1:16:01] you because he said he says in paragraph
[1:16:05] 20 he says I think even the women is
[1:16:07] getting super dressing Modern Age the
[1:16:11] old-fashioned shoes they had some
[1:16:13] leather in them
[1:16:15] you'd buy them about three dollars a
[1:16:18] pair
[1:16:19] the very best kind
[1:16:21] had more leather than them than a dozen
[1:16:25] of pairs got today
[1:16:28] you got to pay 25 for
[1:16:31] but it has to be the Super type you know
[1:16:36] heals about like that
[1:16:38] and I I don't know I preach against
[1:16:42] heels all the time and I I believe that
[1:16:45] some of the sisters wear high heels
[1:16:48] because they just don't
[1:16:51] no
[1:16:53] sisters
[1:16:55] that's your job
[1:16:58] I am not going to try to go up to a
[1:17:01] sister and say wow sister
[1:17:03] I noticed your shoes
[1:17:07] you know those heels are awful High come
[1:17:10] on mothers
[1:17:12] Elder women teach the younger
[1:17:17] you know I mean I know we get these
[1:17:20] Fashions and these European Fashions and
[1:17:23] Fashions you know these ones were the
[1:17:25] the guys come around and they wear their
[1:17:28] pants like you know like this and all
[1:17:33] that like that you know what I mean and
[1:17:35] they they got they don't only have no
[1:17:37] socks on and and all that they look like
[1:17:40] woman's pedal pushers on a man
[1:17:45] come on
[1:17:48] I don't know I don't think your legs
[1:17:51] look so sharp that you gotta wrap them
[1:17:54] up like a wiener so he talks about
[1:17:56] weiner dresses on women and here's guys
[1:17:59] wearing wiener pants wake up
[1:18:03] okay Brothers
[1:18:05] you spiritual Brothers
[1:18:10] no I know a lot of culture you know you
[1:18:13] don't you don't ever say nothing to
[1:18:16] nobody but you go talk about them behind
[1:18:18] their back
[1:18:21] because it's impolite look it we're not
[1:18:24] about polite when it comes to saving
[1:18:26] lives
[1:18:30] there's an instance
[1:18:33] of a a jet plane in in an Asian airliner
[1:18:39] crashed
[1:18:42] and killed I don't know how many people
[1:18:45] because in their culture
[1:18:49] you never said anything to the person
[1:18:52] who was in charge
[1:18:55] four other Pilots or three other Pilots
[1:18:58] sat in that cockpit knowing that this
[1:19:02] Captain was in air
[1:19:05] and wouldn't stand up
[1:19:07] and save his life
[1:19:12] their lives
[1:19:15] and the lives of the people
[1:19:19] because they didn't want to be
[1:19:20] embarrassed
[1:19:22] come on
[1:19:25] if I can embarrass you and get one safe
[1:19:27] yeah
[1:19:28] then Lord help me
[1:19:32] with that in other words
[1:19:34] uh we need to start policing ourselves
[1:19:38] we need to be have a spiritual mind to
[1:19:41] be able to look around and say wait a
[1:19:43] minute man this is out of hand
[1:19:46] sister you can police yourselves about
[1:19:50] your clothes about whether something's
[1:19:52] too tight or not I would hope that the
[1:19:54] church is farther along that and the
[1:19:57] prophet of God said we can't teach you
[1:19:59] algebra because we don't have some of
[1:20:02] our ABC's down you teach your ABCs to
[1:20:06] one another
[1:20:08] you go to one another you talk to one
[1:20:10] another you help one another
[1:20:14] you know what I mean sit down go with
[1:20:16] them in a spirit of love that's how it's
[1:20:18] taught in the scripture you go to that
[1:20:21] person and it's pure love you pray you
[1:20:23] get up you go to them you sit down you
[1:20:24] talk to them you say you know you're
[1:20:26] wearing these fashions
[1:20:29] we just don't wear those fashions
[1:20:31] they're not good for the house of the
[1:20:33] Lord
[1:20:34] no I I can't govern you outside of this
[1:20:37] place
[1:20:40] but there are certain things we want to
[1:20:41] do here
[1:20:42] you know what I mean and we have we have
[1:20:45] rules for the sanctuary and I know
[1:20:47] there's a lot of things that we can't
[1:20:49] take care of right now because we don't
[1:20:52] have the facilities but when we have the
[1:20:54] facilities to keep the sanctuary holy
[1:20:58] and to keep us acting right then don't
[1:21:01] be a
[1:21:03] uh afraid if we're going to have to
[1:21:06] start getting rid of some bad habits
[1:21:09] of course it's always easier not to
[1:21:11] start the habit than it is to break it
[1:21:15] but anyway so we we understand that
[1:21:18] everything's super right we got super
[1:21:20] highway super freeway super this super
[1:21:24] that
[1:21:25] everything's super like he said about
[1:21:27] these shoes he says but it it has to be
[1:21:31] the Super type
[1:21:33] you know heels about like that no toes
[1:21:37] in it but it's super
[1:21:40] you see it the thing
[1:21:43] you have to almost be in super curves to
[1:21:47] walk in it you see that's right
[1:21:50] everything has got
[1:21:52] everything has got crazy to me see
[1:21:57] but it's a super age it's a super time
[1:22:01] how many catch that principle
[1:22:07] do you all understand that right
[1:22:09] everything's got to be better the newest
[1:22:12] better biggest fastest quickest more
[1:22:15] Super
[1:22:16] now do you understand that's a sign
[1:22:22] now that's the question as this has been
[1:22:25] going on
[1:22:26] Church of the Living bride
[1:22:29] elect lady
[1:22:32] Spirit-filled
[1:22:34] believer
[1:22:36] wife of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:40] those are your titles
[1:22:44] that's your description
[1:22:50] have you recognized and understood that
[1:22:54] all this superness
[1:22:56] this super technology is a sign of God
[1:23:01] let's just look at it verse 20 acts
[1:23:04] excuse me paragraph twenty all these
[1:23:07] seeing signs
[1:23:10] are the marking of a spiritual Darkness
[1:23:17] all these things that we see happening
[1:23:20] in these super super super
[1:23:23] if we only knew it what is it it's the
[1:23:28] sign of spiritual Darkness
[1:23:34] let's go down and just read farther
[1:23:39] we're in a hurry we've got to get there
[1:23:42] and what do we do when we get there
[1:23:46] used to take walk home
[1:23:49] from work
[1:23:50] used to be that kids had to walk to
[1:23:53] school and now they have a bus to come
[1:23:56] to the door and pick them up and escort
[1:23:59] them into school and out of school and
[1:24:03] then pay half a million dollars for a
[1:24:06] recreation room to give them a little
[1:24:09] exercise or they die well they used to
[1:24:13] get it walking to school super age
[1:24:17] Now isn't that right even the Church of
[1:24:21] have to have they ain't got enough
[1:24:24] activity among them they have to get a
[1:24:28] room where they can all play and jump up
[1:24:31] and down used to be the spirit made him
[1:24:34] do that
[1:24:35] but now they have to get out there out
[1:24:39] there some sort of super time see all
[1:24:43] leading to a spiritual Darkness a great
[1:24:48] day that we're living in all of this
[1:24:51] superness all of this Modern Trend all
[1:24:55] of this making it easy being able to
[1:24:58] pull up this being able to pull up that
[1:25:01] being able to look this man I know
[1:25:03] everything now
[1:25:05] ask me a question where's my phone
[1:25:11] people don't have to use their mind they
[1:25:12] don't have to memorize you know what's
[1:25:15] happening people used to memorize
[1:25:16] scripture
[1:25:21] I find myself
[1:25:23] oh I won't look that up I know the
[1:25:25] scripture something in my mind somewhere
[1:25:27] but what I'll do is I'll just when I get
[1:25:29] there I'll ask my phone
[1:25:32] because I don't even have to quote it
[1:25:34] right
[1:25:36] I just got to say
[1:25:38] and it shall be in the days of King
[1:25:40] James Version
[1:25:42] there it is
[1:25:46] did you understand that God has been
[1:25:48] warning us that if it's causing us to go
[1:25:52] into spiritual Darkness
[1:25:58] oh we think we're
[1:26:00] bigger and brighter and better than ever
[1:26:04] but you know the difference between
[1:26:06] sitting down and reading your Bible and
[1:26:08] meditating on it and looking it up is
[1:26:11] that it doesn't stay here
[1:26:15] it drops into your heart how many
[1:26:18] understand the process of the will of
[1:26:20] God
[1:26:23] do you know the prophet that God taught
[1:26:25] that how many have read in the message
[1:26:27] and understand I know I'm challenging
[1:26:30] you left here a little bit this morning
[1:26:32] but I'm not doing it in Anger I'm doing
[1:26:34] it in warning in Awareness the prophet
[1:26:38] of God says it starts in your mind
[1:26:41] then it drops into your heart and
[1:26:45] becomes the will of God you know why
[1:26:48] where when does the spiritual Darkness
[1:26:51] go away the spiritual Darkness goes away
[1:26:54] when something drops into your heart we
[1:26:58] don't hardly have anything drop into our
[1:27:00] hearts anymore
[1:27:04] because it doesn't stay there very long
[1:27:10] you know what they call it they call it
[1:27:12] the news cycle
[1:27:15] people's EX
[1:27:17] attention span they have to have
[1:27:19] something new to stimulate them
[1:27:21] something new to this you can remember
[1:27:22] just a few months ago or maybe a year
[1:27:24] ago now I don't know how long war in
[1:27:26] Ukraine war in Ukraine you don't see it
[1:27:32] something new and better has come along
[1:27:34] no you know what's come along something
[1:27:36] darker
[1:27:42] mama
[1:27:43] is dark
[1:27:48] darker
[1:27:50] because these are signs all of its
[1:27:54] leading to spiritual Darkness
[1:27:57] the great day that we're living in now
[1:28:00] you know his people God's people of the
[1:28:03] Bible has always been warned of God to
[1:28:07] watch for the signs of the time
[1:28:13] God's people
[1:28:15] by God
[1:28:17] has always been worn to watch for the
[1:28:22] signs of the time so what was Wednesday
[1:28:25] night about
[1:28:27] it was a warning that challenging us are
[1:28:31] we watching for the signs of the time do
[1:28:33] we even know what the signs of the time
[1:28:35] are can we read
[1:28:39] the signs of the time are you able to
[1:28:42] read
[1:28:43] the world that you're living in
[1:28:45] spiritually
[1:28:51] you better
[1:28:55] because this is the age that Satan
[1:28:57] appears as an angel of Light
[1:29:02] and the only way he can be discerned is
[1:29:05] be discerned by the word of God
[1:29:11] you can't discern Satan by denomination
[1:29:14] you can't discern them by creeds
[1:29:18] you can't discern them by a social
[1:29:21] gospel
[1:29:23] there's only one way he can be discerned
[1:29:25] and that's by the revealed word of God
[1:29:31] there's there's no other way
[1:29:34] you just you just
[1:29:36] you you'll miss it look and so he said
[1:29:41] now look let's just read here a good
[1:29:45] he says about to watch the signs of the
[1:29:49] time Jesus when he was on Earth he said
[1:29:51] to the Pharisees of the day he said you
[1:29:54] blind Pharisees
[1:29:56] you go out in the evening and you look
[1:30:00] and see the skies are clear and red and
[1:30:02] say tomorrow you'll say it'll be a clear
[1:30:05] day and he said then you go out and
[1:30:08] there's lowering angry looking then you
[1:30:12] say tomorrow there'll be foul weather he
[1:30:14] said you can discern the face of the
[1:30:17] Skies
[1:30:18] but the signs of the time you can't
[1:30:23] discern
[1:30:26] now
[1:30:28] let's get real
[1:30:31] okay
[1:30:36] how's our discernment
[1:30:43] people have lost discernment
[1:30:46] they're being fed stuff that they don't
[1:30:49] even realize
[1:30:51] I I'm going to preacher and
[1:30:54] and
[1:30:55] it's just the truth but all this gender
[1:30:59] identity
[1:31:01] making girls wonder if they're girls and
[1:31:04] boys all it is is a bunch of perverts
[1:31:08] trying to get a bunch of new Young
[1:31:10] subjects that that they can enter in to
[1:31:16] all kind of perverted acts with
[1:31:20] parents if you find out that stuff's
[1:31:23] going on you go to that principle
[1:31:28] I know some of you mothers don't think
[1:31:31] you can homeschool if you want to know I
[1:31:33] I'm I'm for everybody that homeschools
[1:31:36] I'll support you 100 percent
[1:31:39] if you have to send your kids to public
[1:31:42] school get involved
[1:31:48] don't let them
[1:31:50] you know I had a brother come the other
[1:31:52] day he said
[1:31:54] my my daughter
[1:31:57] Ken I think 10 or 12 or daughter came to
[1:31:59] home and says Dad how do I detail
[1:32:02] whether I'm a boy or a girl or not
[1:32:09] well someone's
[1:32:11] wants her to get her mind messed up for
[1:32:13] some reason
[1:32:17] you know what the scripture says he
[1:32:19] snares their conscience with a hot iron
[1:32:23] giving them over to perversion
[1:32:27] working that which is unseemingly man
[1:32:31] with man and woman with woman
[1:32:34] have you been able to discern that
[1:32:37] when you first heard it
[1:32:40] did your spiritual antennas go up and
[1:32:43] say wait a minute this is a sign well we
[1:32:47] ought to have known that a long time ago
[1:32:48] because we were told as it was in the
[1:32:50] days of Noah as it was in the days of
[1:32:53] Sodom
[1:32:55] okay so Okay so we've got to be in tune
[1:32:58] but Satan is trying to make us
[1:33:00] spiritually dead
[1:33:03] substituting religion
[1:33:07] in other words no activity in the spirit
[1:33:10] I believe the message
[1:33:15] well great news to y'all
[1:33:19] Satan knows William Branham fulfilled
[1:33:22] Malachi 45.
[1:33:25] and he's more afraid of it than most of
[1:33:27] us
[1:33:30] he said
[1:33:31] foul weather he said you can discern the
[1:33:34] face of the Skies but the sign of the
[1:33:36] times you can't discern said if you
[1:33:39] would have known me you would have known
[1:33:41] my day
[1:33:43] if you'd known Moses he said you'd have
[1:33:45] known me because Moses spoke of me in
[1:33:50] otherwise I have been saying they would
[1:33:52] have known that the scriptures that must
[1:33:56] be fulfilled in that day was being
[1:33:59] fulfilled and they didn't know it
[1:34:04] now we talked about a plan of God
[1:34:07] and there's a plan of God that's going
[1:34:09] to be fulfilled in this day but do we
[1:34:12] know it
[1:34:16] see we've got complacent
[1:34:19] thinking it's all over
[1:34:27] can't do it
[1:34:29] wake up
[1:34:30] Shake ourselves
[1:34:32] let's get back in with God
[1:34:34] that's good let's get back connecting to
[1:34:36] the message let's leave those things
[1:34:38] which are behind behind no condemnation
[1:34:41] here

[1:34:44] you're all going but you got to find the
[1:34:47] way to go before you get there
[1:34:50] I don't want to be elected and be
[1:34:53] spinning around in the circles and have
[1:34:55] to have God slap me flat on my back
[1:34:58] somewhere on a bed looking up at the
[1:35:01] ceiling for me to get my mind back in
[1:35:04] focus
[1:35:10] he said
[1:35:11] they he says in other words
[1:35:16] they would have known the scriptures
[1:35:18] that must be fulfilled in that day being
[1:35:21] fulfilled and they didn't know it they
[1:35:24] had their eyes were so set on their
[1:35:27] traditions and things until they
[1:35:30] couldn't see the actual scriptures
[1:35:33] unfolding before them

[1:37:23] that something's not right

[1:37:28] bananas that's got all black on the peel

[1:38:05] the other day while Leslie was gone but
[1:38:07] when I realized that I couldn't open the
[1:38:09] washing machine I figured I was a far
[1:38:11] cry from uh cooking something
[1:38:23] about
[1:38:24] get back now let's follow this down and
[1:38:27] you don't mind this is Sunday school
[1:38:29] right everybody okay
[1:38:32] anybody that if you have to go I totally
[1:38:34] understand if you get bored you can get
[1:38:37] up and run around you can go to that
[1:38:40] playroom brother bran was talking about
[1:38:44] he said they couldn't see the actual
[1:38:46] scriptures unfolding he said I would
[1:38:49] like in that age to that
[1:38:51] he said to this age now he says now
[1:38:55] we find about the same thing exists
[1:38:58] today this paragraph 25.
[1:39:01] when we know that we're living in the
[1:39:05] hour of gross darkness is covering the
[1:39:10] earth and the people
[1:39:16] everybody understand that
[1:39:19] everybody understand it's a sign
[1:39:21] every understand everything going super
[1:39:24] everything going modern was assigned to
[1:39:27] the church
[1:39:29] that spiritual Darkness was starting to
[1:39:34] set in
[1:39:37] fact you in other words this it's a
[1:39:40] great cloud
[1:39:42] it's a great fog of technology and
[1:39:46] knowledge and wisdom and and and uh the
[1:39:51] great civilization and education and
[1:39:55] science is moving over America and
[1:39:59] moving over the church and bringing
[1:40:03] spiritual Darkness
[1:40:06] oh I can see better than I ever can
[1:40:14] but that's not the kind of spiritual
[1:40:15] sight we need
[1:40:17] stay with me would you I'm just trying
[1:40:20] to point these things out
[1:40:23] he said
[1:40:26] among the fine people sometimes they
[1:40:28] fail to see it
[1:40:30] they just walk away honestly I would be
[1:40:34] discouraged it would discourage me if I
[1:40:38] didn't know that Jesus said
[1:40:41] what he did about it that no man can
[1:40:45] come except my father draws him and all
[1:40:49] the father hath given me will come they
[1:40:52] never be able to see it he said well did
[1:40:56] Isaiah speak of you saying you have eyes
[1:40:59] but can't see ears that can't hear it's
[1:41:03] a pitiful sight but that's the way they
[1:41:08] were
[1:41:09] now
[1:41:11] let me say it again
[1:41:13] that's not your lot
[1:41:18] you're not in that group of people
[1:41:23] you've been given I Sav
[1:41:26] that you can see
[1:41:29] but sight
[1:41:32] is the same as faith faith cometh by
[1:41:35] hearing and hearing by what the word of
[1:41:38] God so this morning God has given us
[1:41:41] Isaac washing our eyes washing our
[1:41:45] hearts washing our minds calling out to
[1:41:48] us warning us their spiritual Darkness
[1:41:55] and what's the warning
[1:41:58] it gets covered up with Revival
[1:42:01] it gets covered up with fancy preaching
[1:42:04] it gets covered up with people thinking
[1:42:07] they're joining movements
[1:42:10] this is an individual affair
[1:42:16] I don't want to be dark
[1:42:20] you could be part of a church and blind
[1:42:23] as a bat
[1:42:26] I counsel thee
[1:42:30] to buy a meme
[1:42:32] let's just read
[1:42:34] paragraph 25.
[1:42:38] now we find just about the same thing
[1:42:41] exists today when we know that we're
[1:42:43] living in the hour of gross darkness is
[1:42:46] covering the earth and the people
[1:42:49] and we find
[1:42:51] that all these modern achievements
[1:42:57] technology
[1:42:59] all these modern achievements of this
[1:43:03] super age and so forth that we're living
[1:43:06] in is only a sign of gross darkness in
[1:43:15] the spiritual
[1:43:17] Realm
[1:43:22] not the historical Realm
[1:43:26] God sent a prophet
[1:43:29] the seals are open not in the historical
[1:43:32] Realm
[1:43:36] not in the doctrinal realm
[1:43:42] baptism
[1:43:44] not in those realms
[1:43:47] not in the natural Realm
[1:43:50] but it's in the spiritual Realm
[1:43:53] and what book the spiritual women you
[1:43:56] think of that I wrote it like this for
[1:43:57] my own self but what are the spirits
[1:44:00] doing to our lives
[1:44:07] not the not the the outward sign
[1:44:12] but the spirit
[1:44:14] behind it
[1:44:16] those 200 000 demon demons that were
[1:44:20] released on the bride those spiritual we
[1:44:24] fight what
[1:44:25] spiritual wickedness in high places what
[1:44:30] are the spirits
[1:44:33] it's like all this modern Christian
[1:44:35] music
[1:44:37] I had people get up in a great big Huff
[1:44:43] because I wouldn't allow certain groups
[1:44:46] To Be Sung
[1:44:49] go ahead
[1:44:50] run away go to some place they'll let
[1:44:53] you sing all that Honky Tonk rock and
[1:44:55] roll
[1:44:56] be a big church star
[1:45:01] all right you know what I mean come back
[1:45:03] and everything looked fine everything
[1:45:05] hunky-dory but it's the spiritual realm
[1:45:09] that we're getting dark into
[1:45:13] we don't recognize the spiritual realm
[1:45:16] we don't recognize the spirits that
[1:45:18] they're moving we don't recognize the
[1:45:20] effect
[1:45:24] you know the prophet of God warns the
[1:45:26] church he says you're all one big happy
[1:45:28] group he said but somebody will come in
[1:45:30] and they'll spread just a little poison
[1:45:33] what's that doing to you spiritually
[1:45:39] I hope we never measure
[1:45:41] our church my number
[1:45:46] that's right
[1:45:47] I hope we measure by men and women who
[1:45:51] can recognize the spirit of God they can
[1:45:55] recognize Satan in every single one of
[1:45:58] his tricks and they'll withstand them
[1:46:01] with the pure unadulterated word of God
[1:46:10] it's the spiritual Realm
[1:46:13] not to the movement of the spirit
[1:46:18] not to the Rain
[1:46:20] falling
[1:46:22] man may I just jump ahead the paragraph
[1:46:27] uh 166.
[1:46:31] it said brother sister
[1:46:34] we are living in the days of the
[1:46:36] supermarket
[1:46:38] super jet
[1:46:39] Super Highway
[1:46:41] super race super everything
[1:46:46] there is a super sign we've had
[1:46:50] signs of religion
[1:46:53] we've had signs of Revival
[1:47:00] we've had signs of getting together
[1:47:05] we've had signs of speaking in tongues
[1:47:08] we've had signs of healing to sick we've
[1:47:11] had all these signs
[1:47:17] they're
[1:47:19] they're those are the signs they're
[1:47:20] trying to throw out to the people now
[1:47:27] they're missing the sign
[1:47:32] if I get too long this morning you don't
[1:47:34] have to come back tonight
[1:47:40] okay whatever sign you want to take
[1:47:44] right the spiritual Realm
[1:47:47] we're in the lady of cnh where either
[1:47:50] just lukewarm
[1:47:52] [Music]
[1:47:53] since when did the the church
[1:47:57] start giving up evening services so they
[1:47:59] can play basketball
[1:48:08] they're letting it down
[1:48:12] but because we have the get together
[1:48:13] sign we have the Revival sign
[1:48:17] we have all the other signs all we have
[1:48:19] to do to am I preaching too crazy but
[1:48:24] all we have to do to make all of our
[1:48:27] lukewarmness
[1:48:29] go away is just have a good shouting
[1:48:32] Revival
[1:48:33] has some real hard uh uh healing
[1:48:38] preaching have some real hard lay it
[1:48:40] down boy get everybody excited tell
[1:48:43] everybody who they are tell them all
[1:48:45] their names are on the Lamb's Book of
[1:48:47] Life they're all going tell them we're
[1:48:49] the ones we're the Revival were it we're
[1:48:52] all together this is what he spoke of
[1:48:58] and spiritually don't even recognize
[1:49:01] the question is
[1:49:03] what are these spirits
[1:49:07] that are in the world working all this
[1:49:10] thing what is it doing to us spiritually
[1:49:16] is our spiritual awareness more acute
[1:49:21] than it's ever been
[1:49:24] or are we getting lukewarm cold formal
[1:49:29] getting to the place we know it all
[1:49:33] we gotta shake ourselves we got to be
[1:49:36] aware it's the spiritual realm they're
[1:49:39] lukewarm
[1:49:40] they go to church
[1:49:44] and people does
[1:49:46] and seem to have real Zeal to go to
[1:49:50] church
[1:49:52] but to know anything about the spirit
[1:50:00] I'm not saying this
[1:50:04] it's a warning from our messenger
[1:50:08] I'll close up I won't get all but I'm
[1:50:10] gonna I want to take this next part and
[1:50:13] I'll close there maybe finish up tonight
[1:50:18] of course you could always go home and
[1:50:20] get the book and sit down and listen to
[1:50:22] the tape and then you'll know exactly
[1:50:24] what I'm preaching
[1:50:28] they seem to have Zeal to go to church
[1:50:31] but to know anything about the spirit
[1:50:33] the time that they're living in
[1:50:37] some of them are as blind as they can be
[1:50:41] about those things
[1:50:43] no matter what God would do
[1:50:46] or how well it would be proved by his
[1:50:49] word they just can't see it I wonder if
[1:50:54] it isn't just about like that what he
[1:50:57] said we have eyes
[1:51:00] but we can't see
[1:51:03] we ought to look around
[1:51:06] and see all these things what's
[1:51:09] happening are a sign
[1:51:12] at the end is at hand because these are
[1:51:17] the things
[1:51:19] that was predicted to be
[1:51:23] at that time
[1:51:26] we ought to be able to look around and
[1:51:29] see these things
[1:51:31] so you see I'm a I'm just a pastor
[1:51:34] okay it's the lowest one of all the
[1:51:37] gifts
[1:51:39] on the totem pole
[1:51:42] and I accept that
[1:51:45] but I want you to know
[1:51:49] the the pro there's a lot of other
[1:51:52] things than this message
[1:51:56] that if we don't get serious we're
[1:51:58] letting slip by
[1:52:02] and you're accountable for them
[1:52:10] what does it say in Revelations 3 18.
[1:52:14] I may I mean just I mean that that's the
[1:52:19] the scripture for our very age that we
[1:52:22] live in let me just you go ahead and put
[1:52:25] it up there if you
[1:52:27] if you have a brother in my in
[1:52:31] Revelations
[1:52:34] uh
[1:52:35] 3 18.
[1:52:38] they said I count thee to buy of me gold
[1:52:41] tried and Fire
[1:52:44] that that may ask
[1:52:46] be rich
[1:52:48] and weight reiniment that thou mayest be
[1:52:52] clothed and the shame of thy nakedness
[1:52:55] does not appear now listen to this verse
[1:52:57] it doesn't say bye
[1:53:02] it says an anoint thine eyes with isab
[1:53:07] that thou mayest see
[1:53:16] that is a
[1:53:18] warning
[1:53:20] for our age
[1:53:23] that's our messenger the Angels little
[1:53:26] lady'll see it telling the church
[1:53:30] anoint your eyes with I said that you
[1:53:34] can see because Satan appears as an
[1:53:36] angel of Light you've got to be able to
[1:53:39] discern the signs of the times you've
[1:53:41] got to be able to discern the spirit you
[1:53:43] got to be able to turn the darkness
[1:53:45] that's coming on we got to be able to
[1:53:47] evaluate ourselves be honest with
[1:53:51] ourselves sit into the mirror and say am
[1:53:54] I carnal or I'm spiritual
[1:53:56] or am I lukewarm a little of both
[1:54:01] and I need to press to spirituality
[1:54:07] now I was going to go through this
[1:54:08] little section here but I'm going to
[1:54:10] skip it
[1:54:11] and
[1:54:12] and brother REM talks about how the
[1:54:15] signs always foreruns his events
[1:54:20] right
[1:54:21] like the birds
[1:54:23] the the geese they when it gets cold
[1:54:26] they go south when it gets hot they go
[1:54:29] north
[1:54:31] right the Cycles always been the same
[1:54:34] everything four runs the event
[1:54:45] or whatever
[1:54:47] there's there's always something that
[1:54:50] foreruns God always fore runs the event
[1:54:54] he says his signs always foreruns his
[1:54:57] events
[1:54:59] just as it does
[1:55:01] he says and that's what he says he says
[1:55:03] when you see geese
[1:55:05] going you see buds coming on you see
[1:55:09] leaves of hauling off see it's the
[1:55:12] continuity of nature blending in God's
[1:55:16] laws of nature Blends in he foreruns his
[1:55:19] events he always has been it never will
[1:55:23] fail
[1:55:24] it never fails
[1:55:26] then he says God's prophets
[1:55:31] prophets are the chief sign
[1:55:35] God's chief sign is a prophet
[1:55:40] so what does he always saying he always
[1:55:43] sends a prophet
[1:55:44] to forerun
[1:55:47] he never sends judgment upon the Earth
[1:55:50] without first sin that's paragraph 40
[1:55:53] sending a prophet
[1:55:55] search the scriptures a prophet is the
[1:55:59] chief sign of God to his people
[1:56:02] that he has sent this person this
[1:56:06] certain person like Noah like Moses like
[1:56:09] Elijah and all the prophets he sends
[1:56:12] them to manifest the word for that age
[1:56:14] and give his people a warning
[1:56:22] of all these other signs
[1:56:25] we've seen the chief sign
[1:56:30] we've seen a prophet of Malachi 4 5.
[1:56:34] the Fulfillment of God's word we've seen
[1:56:37] that sign
[1:56:41] now I want to add this because this
[1:56:44] meant very much to me personally
[1:56:48] and I hope that I can drive it home
[1:56:53] because the prophet of God preached the
[1:56:55] in the message the voice of God
[1:56:58] he said there's
[1:57:00] so many voices today
[1:57:03] people pointing you everything to the
[1:57:06] wrong way
[1:57:08] and then he stands there
[1:57:12] and he says I am the voice of God to you
[1:57:18] now I know you resented that
[1:57:22] and then he says but I am
[1:57:26] the voice of God
[1:57:28] to you
[1:57:32] so as a pastor this morning
[1:57:35] I'm encouraged
[1:57:37] Curry to get back into your spiritual
[1:57:39] Realm
[1:57:42] to put on
[1:57:45] your spiritual glasses the prophet of
[1:57:47] God said your spiritual thinking cap
[1:57:52] understand
[1:57:54] this whole super trend
[1:57:56] is a sign of gross spiritual Darkness
[1:58:00] and
[1:58:01] Satan
[1:58:03] keeping people from the spiritual Realm
[1:58:09] don't let Satan
[1:58:12] blind you
[1:58:13] burden you
[1:58:15] clutter your mind
[1:58:18] so you miss the spiritual Realm
[1:58:22] God don't care about your sins he's
[1:58:24] forgiven your sins
[1:58:26] most of us can make our sins right
[1:58:30] do right
[1:58:32] say you're sorry apply the token get rid
[1:58:36] of the stuff that's eaten you up
[1:58:39] he's already forgiven you
[1:58:44] but the chief sign
[1:58:46] is a prophet
[1:58:49] and he says when God gets ready to send
[1:58:53] judgment
[1:58:54] before he sends judgment he sends a
[1:58:58] prophet to manifest his word his word
[1:59:04] this is paragraph 42 and 43.
[1:59:08] vindicates the word of that age
[1:59:12] he he did it in all other ages he
[1:59:16] promised to do it in this age
[1:59:18] he will do it in this age regardless of
[1:59:22] what the people say about it he'll do it
[1:59:24] anyhow because he cannot break his
[1:59:28] continuity it's the way he planned
[1:59:34] he always does it the same way he never
[1:59:37] fails to do it like he did it the first
[1:59:40] time
[1:59:44] so everything's happening just right
[1:59:46] like John the Baptist now we had 400
[1:59:49] years
[1:59:50] the malachite to John
[1:59:53] and there's been no sign a prophet of
[1:59:57] the Old Testament
[1:59:59] but as long as the space
[2:00:02] at least the time of the judges that
[2:00:05] they're ever
[2:00:07] what that they ever was without a
[2:00:09] prophet what's the matter
[2:00:13] now I'm asking you this morning
[2:00:16] to jump with me
[2:00:19] into the spiritual Realm
[2:00:24] and listen to this
[2:00:28] what's the matter
[2:00:30] why didn't they have a prophet during
[2:00:33] that time
[2:00:35] there was no word placed
[2:00:39] for that
[2:00:42] time
[2:00:47] think of it
[2:00:50] they didn't have a prophet because there
[2:00:53] was no word placed
[2:00:55] for that time
[2:00:57] there was no word placed for that time
[2:01:00] they had to wait until the time got
[2:01:03] right
[2:01:05] they had to wait
[2:01:09] now no word
[2:01:11] place for that time so we understand
[2:01:14] that God has a time that he places his
[2:01:17] word
[2:01:19] now remember if it's not spoken before
[2:01:23] it happens it's not prophecy
[2:01:32] is that right
[2:01:34] so we understand that we had Malachi 4
[2:01:37] 5.
[2:01:40] he prophesied all these things we
[2:01:43] listened to the prophecy Wednesday night
[2:01:45] and stood back in awe
[2:01:49] how the world condition could be
[2:01:53] identical speaking of nuclear storms in
[2:01:56] Florida's diseases how many other
[2:01:59] statements in there that what was in
[2:02:01] there was going on right at the moment
[2:02:07] and now we realize his prophesied
[2:02:11] and we're sitting here this morning
[2:02:13] we're seeing the gross Darkness the
[2:02:15] spiritual decay all these things why
[2:02:18] because there's a word that is placed
[2:02:23] for this time
[2:02:27] okay
[2:02:30] it's his plan there's something a word
[2:02:34] that's placed for this time
[2:02:38] oh
[2:02:40] if we could grab a hold of it
[2:02:43] if we could know it's there
[2:02:46] if we could look at all the warning
[2:02:48] signs we know part of the word that's
[2:02:50] placed for this time is what
[2:02:53] the translation of the Bride
[2:02:56] the placing of the bribe the positioning
[2:02:59] of the Bride
[2:03:02] those are things we've got to take into
[2:03:03] our heart personally
[2:03:06] but you wonder why why wouldn't there a
[2:03:09] Prophet there was no word place for the
[2:03:11] time why did the prophet of God come in
[2:03:13] our day that many times
[2:03:17] since John
[2:03:19] Paul
[2:03:21] why did a prophet the chief sign
[2:03:26] show up in this day
[2:03:28] because there was a word
[2:03:31] placed here
[2:03:33] for this day
[2:03:35] that's the word you must make personal
[2:03:39] contact with
[2:03:46] don't let somebody else do your religion
[2:03:48] for you
[2:03:53] there was no word placed
[2:03:55] now all of a sudden I see a prophet I
[2:03:58] see the signs I see some Gomorrah and
[2:04:01] all of a sudden what's that telling me
[2:04:05] yeah I'm not here as an observer that
[2:04:07] was a prophet
[2:04:09] that was a sign
[2:04:11] that's the truth
[2:04:12] is Lady osia
[2:04:15] it's this is evil that's evil that's not
[2:04:18] what that's not the elect lady
[2:04:22] that's religion
[2:04:24] that's church members
[2:04:26] that's theology
[2:04:29] this is a spiritual Realm
[2:04:32] the spiritual realm tells a Believer
[2:04:34] there's a word
[2:04:37] that's been placed
[2:04:40] for this time
[2:04:50] and you can't rely
[2:04:55] on the sign of getting together
[2:04:59] the sign of religion the sign of Revival
[2:05:04] and all those signs
[2:05:07] you've got to understand
[2:05:09] because that there is a word
[2:05:11] that's been placed
[2:05:14] for our day
[2:05:16] there's a work at that time had to wait
[2:05:20] until it got so we know there's a word
[2:05:22] it says
[2:05:24] he said
[2:05:25] and what a what a warning he said that
[2:05:29] it took all that between that time so
[2:05:31] the church guy he says now nothing has
[2:05:34] taken place
[2:05:35] between that time so the church just got
[2:05:39] slothful and went on its own way until
[2:05:43] the time of Promise draws nigh
[2:05:48] the time
[2:05:50] of what God's got
[2:05:53] for the bride
[2:05:56] but the bride has got to heed the
[2:05:58] warning
[2:06:01] she got to get into the spiritual Realm
[2:06:05] it's not going to be done by preachers
[2:06:09] it's going to be done by the hunger of
[2:06:12] your heart
[2:06:14] you anointing your eyes with isab and
[2:06:18] entering in now in closing then I I had
[2:06:21] so many things to go but I'm just going
[2:06:23] to settle with this
[2:06:25] I don't need to go into all the
[2:06:28] teachings of Malachi 4 5. but I'd like
[2:06:31] just to say this
[2:06:33] because this is part of the warning
[2:06:37] that I believe with all my heart
[2:06:41] that
[2:06:43] the bride is slipping away from
[2:06:48] and I let me just read it if
[2:06:51] that you would it's paragraph 54 and Out
[2:06:54] close promise you with this
[2:07:00] that's the way the gospel is today
[2:07:05] it can only be seen in the way that God
[2:07:11] presents it to you
[2:07:15] and if it's presented to you outside of
[2:07:19] the continuity of the Bible and it's not
[2:07:22] God telling you that
[2:07:26] It could only be seen
[2:07:31] by the way that God presents it to you
[2:07:38] now I want to inform you
[2:07:41] I am not Malachi 4 5.
[2:07:47] I am not Luke 17 30. I am not
[2:07:51] Revelations 10 7 though I am all of
[2:07:55] those
[2:07:57] but I am those
[2:08:00] because I've accepted the way that God
[2:08:04] chose to present it
[2:08:07] the only way it could be seen
[2:08:11] is by the way that God presents it
[2:08:16] and remember
[2:08:18] God interprets his word by a prophet
[2:08:23] he sent the message by Malachi 4 5. he
[2:08:29] gave the sign the only way you're going
[2:08:32] to receive the plan of God is to receive
[2:08:36] it by the way that God sent it it's not
[2:08:39] second hand
[2:08:47] I love church
[2:08:49] I love church people I love preaching
[2:08:51] the gospel I Love The Gospel but God
[2:08:55] gave every single one of us a message
[2:08:58] and in our day here a way to hear it
[2:09:03] don't worry about the guy that's out
[2:09:06] there sitting on the backside of uh
[2:09:10] Tibet somewhere
[2:09:13] if he's God will take care of him
[2:09:17] but much is given
[2:09:22] of whom much is given much is required
[2:09:27] he chose you and elected you
[2:09:30] to see first of all the signs
[2:09:34] to see the chief sign
[2:09:39] to see the Vindicated word
[2:09:42] to see the ministry of the son of man
[2:09:44] and now to come to the full realization
[2:09:47] that the the plan the God's word that's
[2:09:51] been allotted for our age he has a way
[2:09:54] for you to see it
[2:09:58] and it's through that
[2:10:00] great message
[2:10:04] and I'll say this in closing again
[2:10:07] brothers and sisters
[2:10:09] we are living in the days of
[2:10:11] supermarkets super jets Super Highway
[2:10:14] super races super everything else
[2:10:18] and there's a super sign
[2:10:20] we've had the sign of religion
[2:10:23] we have this sign of Revival
[2:10:26] they're shaking those signs in front of
[2:10:28] us now
[2:10:31] but remember the only place you're gonna
[2:10:34] hear it and see it
[2:10:37] is from the source that God chose to
[2:10:40] reveal it I will do nothing until I
[2:10:44] first reveal it to my servant the
[2:10:48] prophet
[2:10:49] we've had signs of getting together
[2:10:52] we have scientists speak in it as we
[2:10:54] have signs of Healing The Sick we've had
[2:10:57] all these signs
[2:11:01] but yet we find in the Bible
[2:11:04] that the last sign before the sun
[2:11:07] promised Sun arrived it was a super sign
[2:11:11] Jesus says As it was then
[2:11:15] before the promised Sons arise
[2:11:18] that the super sign would come on the
[2:11:21] Earth again
[2:11:22] I declare to you tonight
[2:11:26] in the name of Jesus Christ it's on
[2:11:30] earth now
[2:11:33] not only that but it's right here among
[2:11:37] us tonight
[2:11:39] the Holy Ghost God's super sign the
[2:11:44] resurrected Jesus Christ it cannot fail
[2:11:47] it's an eternal sign it can never be
[2:11:51] changed heavens and earth will pass away
[2:11:54] but that it will never change it's an
[2:11:58] eternal Everlasting sign God manifested
[2:12:03] in human flesh God makes himself known
[2:12:07] in human flesh
[2:12:14] oh Hallelujah
[2:12:17] what was Luke 17 30.
[2:12:22] what was the last sign
[2:12:25] Luke the one that the only way you could
[2:12:28] receive it was the way that he presented
[2:12:31] it
[2:12:32] the last sign was God failing himself in
[2:12:35] flesh
[2:12:36] speaking to you every warning
[2:12:41] not only that because you are in this
[2:12:44] mind but you weren't manifested yet he
[2:12:48] put it on tapes and books where you
[2:12:50] could have access to it and read it and
[2:12:52] it can do the same thing to you than it
[2:12:55] did to the believer that accepted it
[2:12:57] then he's the same yesterday today and
[2:13:01] forever
[2:13:05] isn't that beautiful
[2:13:09] he's got
[2:13:10] do you believe that to be the truth
[2:13:14] with all your heart you believe it
[2:13:17] don't shut yourself up like a turtle in
[2:13:21] a shell
[2:13:22] if there's any turtle in you
[2:13:26] take the shell out
[2:13:28] let the Holy Spirit come in don't close
[2:13:32] yourself to some Creed or denomination
[2:13:34] brothers and sister the hour has arrived
[2:13:38] and I believe that God has done as much
[2:13:42] as he's going to do
[2:13:44] the next thing is action of the church
[2:13:48] or either we're going to be
[2:13:59] you think it's the action of us running
[2:14:02] out and going to hospitals and laying
[2:14:04] and the action of the church
[2:14:08] is anointing their eyes with I sap that
[2:14:13] they can see
[2:14:15] the action of the church is the return
[2:14:19] to the spiritual Realm
[2:14:23] we've had to get together sign
[2:14:26] we've had the religious sign we've had
[2:14:28] the Revival sign
[2:14:31] what's the last thing for the church
[2:14:33] it's the invisible Union of the Heavenly
[2:14:36] bridegroom in the Earthly bright it's
[2:14:39] every believer making contact with the
[2:14:43] revealed word of God

[2:16:17] like to see
[2:16:19] if you feel that there's maybe things
[2:16:21] that are getting past you that you're
[2:16:24] not recognizing
[2:16:26] and you'd like to lift your heart to him
[2:16:28] this morning

[2:16:45] my past mistakes and failures I I've let
[2:16:49] people come around and
[2:16:53] make my heart bitter and make me afraid
[2:16:59] but Lord I I want you to restore
[2:17:03] the joy of my salvation
[2:17:06] I want you to restore my appetite for
[2:17:10] your word

[2:17:34] Lord I want you to give me some
[2:17:36] spiritual backbone
[2:17:38] I want you really to
[2:17:40] [Music]
[2:17:41] get my heart
[2:17:45] set right again on your message in your
[2:17:47] messenger
[2:17:49] Lord I've let a lot of people do my
[2:17:52] religion for me
[2:17:54] people say brother Branham said and I
[2:17:57] accept it with never going looking
[2:18:00] never reading
[2:18:01] never bringing it to my heart myself
[2:18:08] Lord in fact if I am honest with you
[2:18:12] I really don't have any leadership in my
[2:18:15] life at all
[2:18:18] I'm just being pushed down this
[2:18:22] the river of time and
[2:18:28] just going from door to door
[2:18:34] and I don't have any real spiritual
[2:18:36] leadership in my life
[2:18:38] foreign
[2:18:42] I don't have a place I'm grounded to
[2:18:46] that I know is truth
[2:18:50] Eternal truth
[2:18:54] and I'm asking this morning Lord that
[2:18:57] you would ground me this morning
[2:19:01] I'm opening my heart
[2:19:05] I see this morning that you stood at the
[2:19:07] door and knocked
[2:19:11] and I want to open up this morning
[2:19:15] and I want to
[2:19:17] allow you to come in and
[2:19:21] talk to me spiritually
[2:19:23] [Music]
[2:19:26] give me isap that I might see
[2:19:36] that my spiritual man can
[2:19:39] arise this morning
[2:19:43] foreign
[2:19:45] Lord that's what we need
[2:19:48] Lord I've preached this morning
[2:19:50] with all my heart
[2:19:53] as honest as I could be
[2:19:57] Lord I trust that the people know I love
[2:20:00] them
[2:20:03] Lord Lord you understand
[2:20:06] how much I understand that you chose a
[2:20:09] prophet to bring this message
[2:20:13] you so one-man invasion
[2:20:16] a one-man source of Revelation
[2:20:21] you told us Lord to hit on the high
[2:20:24] places
[2:20:27] and I've tried to follow that this
[2:20:29] morning
[2:20:31] hit on the high places
[2:20:33] the things that you said the wonderful
[2:20:36] things you pointed out
[2:20:40] but Lord it takes your spirit
[2:20:43] to deal with the heart
[2:20:47] and I ask that you would deal with the
[2:20:49] heart this morning
[2:20:52] and if there's one here this morning
[2:20:54] they'd like to draw
[2:20:56] closer to you than they've been
[2:20:59] and they'd like to lift their hand to
[2:21:02] you father
[2:21:08] Lord
[2:21:12] set me off flame again
[2:21:18] make this message real to me again
[2:21:22] make it like it was the first days I
[2:21:25] opened the books
[2:21:27] the first time I pressed the button
[2:21:31] don't let it be common to me Lord but
[2:21:34] may I receive
[2:21:36] the spiritual
[2:21:38] leadership
[2:21:40] and the way that you chose for us to see
[2:21:44] it
[2:21:44] was only the way that you presented it
[2:21:49] father and you presented it and stored
[2:21:51] it up in a storehouse
[2:21:53] that we can go there and live
[2:21:56] and eat
[2:21:59] I can't change that Lord
[2:22:04] you didn't choose me to be the source
[2:22:08] the Lord I believe you called me to make
[2:22:12] the source available
[2:22:14] I've done that this morning Lord now I
[2:22:17] ask that
[2:22:20] whom forever you've attended this word
[2:22:24] that it would take such root in their
[2:22:27] heart
[2:22:28] that they could say from that time
[2:22:31] I'm different
[2:22:33] I've been changed
[2:22:35] I've been set a flame again
[2:22:41] I've examined myself and
[2:22:44] I've made corrections to my life
[2:22:47] and I'm going to go forward from this
[2:22:49] place better than I've ever gone before
[2:22:53] we ask it
[2:22:55] in Jesus precious and wonderful name
[2:23:00] amen let's sing this song as we prepare
[2:23:03] to dismiss
