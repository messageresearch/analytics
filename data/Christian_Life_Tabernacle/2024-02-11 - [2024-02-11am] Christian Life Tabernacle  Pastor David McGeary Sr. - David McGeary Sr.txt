commit the service to him Heavenly Father we lord truly you are worthy Lord how you Lord just look forward to the day when you and your people may be one and Lord how we can declare how worthy you are Lord I pray pray that you would help us to declare your how how worthy you are with our lives Lord that we would be willing to just commit ourselves holy to you that you would just continue to use your word to transform us into your image Lord we commit the service to you once again Lord we come here with expectation or not because there's something special about the building or about about the you know the preacher father it's your presence Lord It's your word and we come Lord expecting Lord that you would make yourself known to us each of us have a desire Lord to draw closer to you and to hear from you each of us have needs that we lift up to you in faith and in and in Hope and in prayer father I pray that you would come and have your way in the service that you'd meet every need Lord that you'd speak that word which we need in our in in due season Lord we commit the service to you that your will would be done Lord and that lives would be changed and transformed closer to your image we pray in jesus' name amen amen you may be seated you know in Exodus 33 um we read a story of how Moses was communing with the Lord one day as all the people were worshiping in their tents and we know the story that Moses was seeking after the Lord because the people had just sinned they created for themselves a beautiful kind of worship but without the word and it had caused the Lord to remove his presence from the camp that's right and to pitch the Tabernacle outside the camp even though the worship service itself was was so loud that it could be heard from the top of the mountain the Lord was nowhere near right so Moses was seeking the face of the Lord and in verse 15 he says Lord If thy presence go not with me carry us up not then if you aren't with us I don't want to go at all when the Lord is speaking to him and he says in verse 19 I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show Mercy to whom I will show mercy and then he says this in verse 20 thou can not see my face for there shall no man see me and live for there shall no man see me and live that was on my mind as I was reading Psalm 41 this week want to go ahead and turn to that we'll be reading that this morning this is again one of those psalms where David is in prayer before the Lord you know a lot of things on his heart a lot of Trials he's going through and he's just communing with the Lord and you know as he gets to that place where the Lord begins to work with him he makes this statement in verse 11 by this I know that thou favor me because mine enemy does not triumph over me and as for me thou uphold us me in mine integrity and sest me before thy face forever so on the one hand we have the Lord telling one prophet that thou can not see my face and live and then here's another Prophet on the other hand declaring that thou sest me before thy face forever you know it turns out that David has a lot to say about the face of the Lord in the Psalms you know for example in Psalm 27 he says when thou s seek ye my face my heart said unto me thy face Lord will I seek speaking of a call to seek his face yet thou can not see my face and live other verses speak of the face of the Lord Psalm 246 this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face he also speaks of hiding his face yeah you know many times David cries out to the Lord begging him not to hide his face Psalm 1437 hide not thy face from me lest thy be like them that go down into the pit so I can't thou can not see my face and live that's right but if you hide your face from me I go down to the pit Psalm 1022 hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble incline thine ear unto me Psalm 279 hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in anger and yet in Psalm 519 his prayer is hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities so no man can see my face and live that's right and yet there's a call to seek his face David Avid despairs when the Lord hides his face from him but asks him to hide his face from his sins in Psalm 31:16 he says this make thy face to shine upon thy servant oh save me for my Mercy's sake three times in Psalm 80 David says turn us again oh God and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved Psalm 119 135 make thy face to shine upon thy servant and teach me thy statutes now the effect of the face of the Lord is salvation and instruction but thou can not see my face and live you know elsewhere in the Scripture it speaks of the Lord setting his face against a person or a people and them being plagued and destroyed yet now in Psalm 41 as we read this this morning David rejoices because the Lord has set him before his face forever the face of the lord it's salvation yet it's judgment and destruction it's death but something he desires we seek and can find it's something we don't want hidden but we do want hidden from our sins something that we desire to be set before but something we don't want set against us the face of the Lord as Nicodemus said how can these things be how can we we seek his face be set before his face but no man can see his face and live it says in John 1:18 John makes this statement no man hath seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him the face of the Lord has been declared it has been made known it has been made manifest through a reflected image amen his son almost like a solar eclipse he says later in 1 John 1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon so that unapproachable unseeable face has been declared into to us in a manner that can be seen and approached not only that but in 1 John 4:9 in this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him that's right or as Paul says it this way in Colossians 3 if you're risen with Christ ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God so if we're already dead we can't die Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live In the Flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God an entrance has been ministered whereby we may have boldness to enter into his holiest by a New and Living Way you know as David says in Psalm 41 as for me thou uphold us my integrity and sest me before thy face forever a place I could not go without death he has set me a place by him you know as the Lord told Moses in Exodus 33 thou can not see my face for thou sh for there shall no man see me and live but you know behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon upon a rock that's right and it shall come to pass while my Glory passeth by that I will put thee in a cleft of The Rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by there's a place prepared where you may see his face and oh by the way this was Moses right there in his tent let's go ahead and stand this morning I don't know about you but I'm grateful there's a place an entrance has been ministered where I can be set before his face and live where I can seek his face and where there can be instruction and salvation as he says Thou uphold us me in mine integrity and settest me before thy face forever let's just read that Psalm 41 together it's 13 verses starting verse one blessed is he that consider the poor the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble the Lord will preserve him and keep him alive and he shall be blessed upon the Earth and thou will not deliver him unto the will of his enemies the Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing thou will make all his bed in his sickness I said Lord be merciful unto me heal my soul for I have sinned against thee my enemies speak evil of me when shall die and his name perish and if he come to see me he speaketh vanity his heart gathereth iniquity to itself when he goeth abroad he tth it all that hate me whisper together against me against me do they devise my hurt an evil disease say they cleaveth fast unto him and now that he lith he shall rise up no more yay my own familiar friend in whom I trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me but thou oh Lord be merciful unto me and raise me up that I may requite them by this I know that thou favor me because mine enemy does not triumph over me and as for me thou uphold me in mine integrity and sest me before thy face forever blessed be the Lord God of Israel from Everlasting and to Everlasting amen and amen amen God bless you may have your seats amen it's the whole time Holy Spirit and the

Arsenal the blood of the Lamb father it's where we meet you it's our place of Fellowship it's our confidence in every victory that you paid the price your own price with your own self no other greater price could be paid and we're grateful for that this morning Lord Jesus we just ask you to bless us this morning in our fellowship this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen God bless you may be seated thank you musicians this morning um you know I I I wanted to um just take a moment uh to fellowship and with you and and I uh I just want to if I could say uh this to uh in my relationship with you uh and I I just wrote a note here is I think it's important that you understand my position as a pastor and the things that I can do and I can't do because I'm governed by the word of God you know I don't really care what anybody thinks outside of our congregation but I do care what you think that that's important to me you know and and of course my greatest desire is that you know that uh I I try to bring bring uh you the word of God just the way that the prophet of God said it um I do I do my best not to uh incorporate is my Revelation but in one sense I can only preach my Revelation and so but I always uh want you to know that it's not my position to make you believe the way I believe okay I I'm not going to spend hours trying to get you to describe things in the same terminology that I describe things and and to make emphasis over and over again that you might see it the way that I see it uh because that's not really uh my position uh uh the number number one thing that I'm supposed to do is just preach the gospel okay that's what my position is and it it's and when it comes to counseling and things uh the only thing I can do is bring you in remembrance of what the word of God said or what the prophet of God said because if everybody would stay with the word the word would automatically correct the air you you understand if people would uh uh pray first so whenever you come to me you're way down on the bottom of the ladder there's lots of things in between first of all prayer reading the scripture studying to show show yourself approved uh finding out what the messenger said but if you ever have to come to me you have to understand my position my position I isn't a psychiatrist or a psychologist you know it's not to give you uh what I think you ought to do on it's to tell you what the word of God says and to bring you in remembrance of the things that he said uh and you know another thing is is it's uh my position isn't to take sides you know in fact even that's how the pastor describes what a pastor supposed to be he's supposed to be in the middle of the road when there's two different opinions and bring both of the opinions back to this middle of the road which is the word of God so you know it's not my job to to you know to side uh differences not to take sides it it's to stay with the word and uh so I think sometimes uh you know people uh want me to be more than I'm allowed to be you understand I'm not allowed to be the scripture tells me that I cannot Lord over God's Heritage you understand so it's that's important that you understand that you know what I mean so and and also uh you know it it's important that I'm not influenced by money by popularity by family or friends right you know what I mean you have to understand that go that goes that I have to to do my best not to be influenced by things I have to do my best to preach the gospel to everybody at every level you you understand you can't have a group of people that are more spiritual they're more into the Mysteries they're more into the deeper things I I I it's not my position just to take those people and single them out because they're easier to preach to or they might look at things the way that I look at things okay my position is to preach to the children to the young adults to everybody to go to Encompass it all and and uh and it it's not my position to govern your life lives and and I want you to know that that that I I'm not allowed I don't govern your lives you know what I mean whether you buy this or buy that or move here or move to that house I know there's a lot of Ministries a lot of cultures that a person won't move from one house to the other without talking to the pastor it's not my job you know what I mean you live where you want to live you know what I'm saying the the only thing I can preach to you is is pay your bills try to stay out of debt try to live where you can go to church you know what I mean put God first that that's what governs you not me it's not my job to make choices for you and sit down if if you did everybody be driving a Ford and and this and that and you know what I mean and everybody have their hair cut the way that I wanted it cut you know what I mean so uh you know that it's not my job to cover you know what I mean it's not my job to make you afraid of me you know what I'm saying like whoa I don't want the pastor to be mad at me you know if if you've ever sat under a Ministry where you're afraid of the pastor you've never had one that's exactly okay you you know it's just not what I'm about you know what I mean I I I'm just like you U you know I I I I I fight the same devil you fight you know I'm not granted with some great big spiritual uh ability above everybody else you know I pray just like you pray I get sick just the way that you get sick you you know what I mean there's there's absolutely nothing different from you a and myself as far as life concerned as far as a gift that's God operates that gift and you operate that gift if you're hungry for the word of God God will help me bring you the the word of God if you're not hungry for the word of God uh you know we'll uh not have evening service and you can all go home and watch the Super Bowl you know what I mean if you think think it's a Super Bowl you know I mean this country is going to buil bet 25 no $85 billion dollar will be beted gambling you know I mean it's it's a joke and then after it's over it's over how many knows who won the 1968 Super Bowl I don't I didn't even know who won last year what difference does it make it's fake you know what I mean but it's not my job to to govern and and and uh you know and and there are things that it's not my place to make a decision to make you you know what I'm saying so it's not it it's not uh uh up to me to decide whether you can get together like you know if all the people people from uh uh from wherever you're from want to get together and have a picnic you want to get together and have a dinner that's not my choice you know it's not my decision you know who gets together and why you want to get together you can do that you know what I mean I it's not my choice you can do what you want to do you you know what I mean and I don't have to be invited you you understand I don't have to be there uh so uh you you've got to understand if you want to have people over Thanksgiving fine if you want to have a baby shower fine you know what I mean it's it's not a church function you know I mean your dinners are not a church function getting out there together is not a church friend you don't have to call me and say you know there a bunch of us would like to get together and have dinner great you know what I mean it I'd rather tell you all great instead of get 50 phone calls can we have a dinner can we get together and have a dinner it's not my position it's not my place it's not that's what you're born again for that's what you have the Holy Spirit for yeah you know what I mean and and so you don't need my permission you don't need my permission now there are some things you have to understand now and so the scripture is very specific about the the positions of men and women in the scripture you all and you know so I'll just read this little scripture to you because I think it it's extremely uh um strong but it says um for God is not the author of confusion but of Peace as in all churches of the Saints let your woman keep silence in the church for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be be under obedience as also saith the law and if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church and and so you have to understand that there's a relationship between the husb usband and the wife now I know the brothers have got together and they have a men's breakfast they want to come together and say uh we we want to meet and fellowship and have a breakfast well I know the sisters then they feel like well we want to come together and have a sister's breakfast but but you understand I cannot insert myself between the authority of the husband over his wife do you understand what I'm saying I can't gather the sisters together and have a sister's meeting because I'm the pastor lesie can't have a sister's meeting cuz I won't let her you you you you understand what I'm saying so it's not Tit for Tat that's that's between if you have a question ask your husband you know what I mean but you see that's in the Book of Judges uh you know that uh uh Samson gave a riddle and they came back and answered the riddle and and Samson said if you had not plowed with my heer in other words if you hadn't talked with my wife you wouldn't have known these things you see and and I'm not allowed to do that I'm not allowed to to say I'm going to gather the sisters together and the sisters are going to do this or the sisters are going to do this or we want to do that if you do that under the leadership of your husband I can't say anything about it you understand that so I I'm I'm not free to to run off and and start this and start that or start this or do this or do that and and so you can't put me in a position that I'm not allowed to go and I didn't know maybe you didn't think I was governed you you know what I mean but I got a lot more restrict frictions on me than you have on you and so I want you to to know that so uh you know the if the sisters have a baby shower and they want to go to baby shower I presume that all of you have the your husband's permission you know what I mean and uh I can't get involved in that so we if you understand that I I just want you to understand that there's one thing that is above us all and that's the word of God that's the word of God so uh I I uh it it there's nothing personal either way if all the Zimbabwean people want to get together and have a you know have Zimbabwean food or all the congales or the Hispanic people or the Irish people or are you know and you want you can do all that that that just just not it has nothing to do with church it's not a church thing you know if your child wants to play sports it's fine that's your family that's a family decision it's a husband's decision I presume you're you would talk that over whether or not you would watch your children and go your children now there are things that I can preach against like having televisions in the home and and how you dress but you know the prophet of a young lady came to brother Brandon and he said told her he says well your parents are farther down the road that's why they feel the way they feel he said but you be a Christian wherever you are and if your child can't play sports and be a Christian then you talk with them have them get the Holy Ghost and and you know and uh um and and I'm I'm not against Sports it's not my job to make a decision in sports it's your job you understand that it's it's your job to decide what's best for your children it's not my job to make family decisions so do you want you understand where I'm coming from so if it has nothing to do you know uh it I can't give my blessings or my cursings I've got to stay out of it so if you want to do something you pray about it talk to your husbands about it and and he's the head I am not cannot insert my headship between the husband and wife between the husband and his family and the order in which I have to go is I have to go from word to husband husband to family and if you say what happens if you don't have a husband the order is from you to your father and then your father to me if you don't have a father and you don't have a husband then me and my wife will try to counsel you back according to the word of God because and so I just say these things because I think it's important that you understand that I don't have all the authority sometimes that you think I should have and I can't make all the decisions and calls that you think I should be making it's not my place and I can't leave my place I have hard enough time with myself let alone getting out of my place amen so I just hope you understand that and uh understand really the position of a pastor is to feed the Sheep amen is to to lead them in the path of God's word it's it's not to create a social structure or to to choose so if you will do that so uh we're going to uh just turn again if let's stand and turn to Romans I believe it's the 12th chapter of Romans that we've been reading if I got that right in my memory um and we want to read Romans again it says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a Living Sacrifice wholly acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove that what prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God father we ask you to bless your word to us in Jesus precious name we pray amen God bless you this morning we're going to have a a wonderful uh portion of uh a tape this morning uh uh and I I trust it will bless you so to understand what we've been talking about we we've been talking about the law of the seed the law of the seed that that when God chose to create the world he chose to do it by by seed so in other words it wasn't going to be uh uh speak in other words a banana tree you know and all of a sudden a banana tree appeared no he he spoke the word and instead of having a banana tree he planted a banana seed and then however long it took his Spirit brooded over that until that that came forth and so everything that God did he did it in seed form that was what that was the law of the seed and we understood that now how why that Eve could say that that she had received a a child of the Lord when uh she bore forth Cain which we knew came from The Serpent and we we've been talking about that the importance of understanding serpent seed and to understand the seed and the law of the sea how it could only bring forth of its kind and so in order for for uh Lucifer to to exalt himself over the sons of God and to build a better Kingdom and to build an Eden he had to have something that would produce after its kind so he had to have a way to reproduce himself to reproduce himself which is different than coming under the influence of something and Jesus referred to it and he finally looked at him he said you're of your father's the devil you know that you're unbelievers of the word of God and another place our Prophet said to us he says they don't have any thing within them to believe with and words there's not a seed in them there's not something in them and so we're we we we're trying to really get us to come to that place uh where we have that inner faith that that faith that comes from from not our sight not our senses not our emotions not our makeup of our outward senses and our inward senses but we come to that place where that six s that thing the prophet of God talks about that down on the inside of that is a soul and and and he said some people have a little serpent there and other people have the seed of God there and we we realize that we can't judge that by the flesh they were lines that would have been perfect lines Cain and and and Abel if their their lines would have just been straight down the line but what happens is that the sons of God saw the daughters of men were fair and then they begin to mix it and even the the human race is hybrid our fith our our flesh is hybrid and so you have to understand that when it comes to interracial marriage it doesn't have anything to do with the word of God it has to do with the the plan of God that everything bring forth of its kind and we know that different cultures and different races marry each other and and we have uh different uh skin types different facial features that's that's just the way that the hybriding wind you you you understand and and there's nothing that that we can do about it it has nothing to do with prejudice it doesn't have anything to do uh with um what's right and what's wrong it has to do with the word of God Amen the law of God and so to to try to to go back to the law of God we can't undo things that's right you you understand that in other words if if you come from a a a a a mix marriage or or or two different uh cultures married and all those things that you can't go back and undo anything the only thing you can do is if the seed of God's in you is bring yourself under subjection to God's word and so uh all those lines have been crossed the only line that hasn't meant crossed is the seed word of God that's still what's in us and so no matter what your carnal situation is or your fleshly situation is we don't want to find our faith in the flesh we want to find our faith in our heart we want to find our faith in our inner being CU he said that he would be like a Fountain of Living Water springing up within us and and so there's got to be some place that we can go to because if God is going to require of you faith and Revelation there there's go he's got to give you something to believe in you know what I mean something that he can show you he he's not going to try to tell lay a bunch of stuff out here and have you try to sort through it and determine what you believe and what you don't believe he he's going to place something inside of you that he can contact remember the great story about the magnet that he said that went down then it swept out over the floor he was at a manufacturing place a a great tool making place and and there there was some over there uh tooling on a aluminum and there was some over there uh tooling on steel and copper and and different things working and he said at the end of the day all of a sudden a great magnet went down and it swung all across that place and and the and certain metals were connected right away to that magnet but you know aluminum won't hook on a magnet yeah you know and if you ever noce people that want to know what something is before they drill it or something they'll take a magnet and they'll put it on and if it don't stick it's not steel I don't care how much it looks like steel it's aluminum you know what I mean aluminum is not as strongest steel lot of things we could go into but but but there was something that connected right and there's something in you amen that connects with the word of God right regardless of what your outward shell is you understand God didn't judge you or make you or plant his seed based on your genealogy he did it before there was a genealogy in the foundation of the beginning of the world before there was a moon before there was a star he placed it in you so you might have got here through all kinds of different circum ances through all kinds of different marriages through all kinds of things your parents May divorced and remarried and and this and that and all that that has nothing to do with you and God's word God's word is personal to you you know it doesn't matter if your if your parents don't get along or they do get along that has nothing to do with you personally and that's what I'm talking about when you come down and you've got to be able to separate the whole world and not look outside for your faith but look inside for your faith your faith is within you amen God placed the kingdom of God within you that's that's why you can't understand the beginning nor the end of it don't ask me how I got in this pulpit cuz I can't figure it out how I was a hippie boy how I was living in California how I the people I listened to the people that had influence on my life the path that I came I can only go to one thing is that somebody had to have their hand on me and if he took me from there he didn't take me from there to drop me off along the Wayside he that started a work in me's going to finish it all the way to the end and you might go through a lot of things the prophet of God said sometimes a man will stumble from church to church religion to religion everywhere going and searching but one day he hears that eagle stream one day he hears that voice you may have been through all kinds of emotions all kinds of trials in your lives all kinds of failures all kinds of problems all kinds of of of habits and everything but when that voice strikes that seed there's something in you that says amen that's right and then you don't care what the world thinks you don't care you're not you don't care about what they think of your position what what they think about your thing there's only one thing you know you've got if you've got a thirst for what struck your heart and you want more of that yes that's what you want more of I want more of God I want more of the word I want more of life I want to be more like him and you found something that can transform you and that's what's beautiful yes sir you say Brother David why do you love this message so much because I was in a dark spot amen if I could say that I was in prison I was one of them HS that was in prison there's no way I could have got out of what that I was in I couldn't think my way out of it I couldn't work my way out of it the My Flesh had control in me but one day I heard something that gave me life and it blessed me and oh I had a thirst for it amen I was hungry to hear it and you know the most beautiful thing about the word of God I love is I've haven't learned it all yet I will never learn it all I will always want more he always has more from me it'll always get better it'll always get richer my eyes can always see farther you are not stuck where you are and this is the last place I want to be stuck as in this world cuz it's going backwards it is it's going backwards so they they're going one way and we're going up and so this morning if you would bear with me because my desire for you is really to come to the place regardless of your weakness and I don't know any of you have ever had siblings you know that all your brothers and sisters are rotten but you well they feel the same way you know what I mean but we are a part of something that God is doing and we don't want you to find your faith from the outside we want you to find your faith from within the prophet of God made a statement that that I've heard it for years I've quoted it for years but I've never come to the realization of what he was saying and I'm still coming to the realization of it but he said pray to him with is in you now that's amazing statement pray him with was within you we're going to listen to 16 minutes this morning of the message called the spoken word is the Original Seed so remember a seed is in its beginning form right so a seed has within it the power to transform from what God pled to what his intention of that seed was is it is an apple tree an apple tree in seed form yes every fruit that's ever going to come from that apple tree is in that seed now we're trying to find our faith because where's Faith final resting place the word of God faith has got to rest on the word of God that's where your faith is you not not your faith isn't in your understanding of it your faith isn't in your ability to explain it your faith is in the ability to say God said so that settles it you know and I I feel you should feel the same way there there's a law the prophet of God said why don't they stop it they know their High breeding's kill killing them he says why why won't they stop it and he said they can't because God said so that's right and that's what solves every situation as God said so I want to just read a statement uh to you and then so we can start this and fellowship on it and have it be a a blessing to us uh but this is what he says he says now remember every spoken word of God is the Original Seed amen so that's right everything that's not spoken word is a what a high bread it's a mixture it's a mixture and and and if we need in our lives in our spiritual lives is to prune out the hybrid things that's right the things that are mixed and that's all that Satan has done to you since you've been a young child is mixed his ideas mixed his education mixed his civilization mixed everything you are you are a a product of the voices that have been talking to you you go to school and maybe you you do it and you have a friend and they like to play tennis and you like that friend and they get you out and now you're playing tennis you know what I mean and and the only reason you became a tennis player it is is not because you know uh I can't think of any tennis players but Arthur Ash and he's be so far over your guys's heads you but anyway uh uh you know it just may not even be a talent you know and you develop it or whatever somebody influenced you to go this way that way you didn't chose where you were born at you know okay I like what David said he says I you were my God I was cast upon you from my mother's Billy I didn't have no choice but God was he he got your great-grandfather and your great grandfather and he got them to marry and them to marry and them to mix and everything to bring you into the world so you might not understand why you were born where you were born when you but if you come back to the word of God God will make all that clear to you that's right because every spoken word every word of God is the Original Seed the word of God is the only seed that was originally planted anything else that's planted whether it's education civiliz knowledge science if it's not 100% pure word is hybrid and what do we know about things that are hybrid they die The Original Seed is the only thing that contained eternal life and this is why our Prophet told us if you have eternal life you always had eternal life you would have never received the pure unadulterated word of God if there wasn't a seed in you to receive it that's right if not you just ended up with some idea and I can say this all of you have an opportunity to listen to the original word that was spoken in Our Generation by the promised scriptures of Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 and Revelations 10:7 which told you that one had come to restore back the revelation of the word that our fathers had so every spoken word is the Original Seed if you have a a a some sort of uh device or phone or tablet or whatever that you would like to listen to we're going to start in paragraph 118 and and and with this statement now remember correctly that's why each generation has its own Revival amen it gets a chance at the word then they hybrid it instead of T of taking on they go somewhere else that's the statement we're going to start with we're going to listen to 18 minutes this is a very strong 18 minutes and I I um my desire is that you find yourself in here okay you find yourself in these this little 18 minutes when we're done we'll go back and make a few comments on it and we'll try to be out as soon as that we can so let's enjoy this wonderful teaching of this this message is 6 hours and some minutes long so 16 minutes of it isn't a lot but uh let's just en let's just enjoy this this morning God bless you it's in the spoken word The Original Seed uh the message that came from uh spoken word uh the publishing company started on paragraph 118 thank you God bless you correctly that's why each generation has its own Revival it gets a chance at the word then they H read it instead of Tak it on they go somewhere else my mission and I believe that God has called me far I I have to say some personal things today because that's what I told you I do amen see to tell the world my Miss I believe to the Earth is what is to forerun the coming word see the coming word which is Christ and Christ in him has the Millennium and has everything right there because he is the word all right Jesus said in John 3:5 if you want to mark that down John 3:5 we all know it or either I turn maybe somebody on the tapes but might not be able to turn just at that time and I'll read here u in St John the third chapter and the fifth verse and we see what Jesus said we might start off just a little before that third Jesus answered and said unto him verily verely I say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily I say unto you and to thee except the man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God is that a seed every spoken word of God is a seed seed that's right I'm going to prove that just in a minute where Jesus said so every spoken word of God is a seed then except a man be born again why must he be born again he's dead with the fion he in he's a h he's got to be born again why he was born in Sin from Eve sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies he's a liar to begin with no matter how smart educated what more he is he's a liar the Bible says he is how holy his parents was or anything about he's a liar to begin with and the only way he can tell truth is say what truth is through his own lips that's the only way truth can come anything contrary to that word he's a liar yet that's pretty flat but that's what God Said let every man's word be a lie and mine be true amen anything that comes from his lips contrary to deny this word or put it in some other race or some other generation or whatever it is he's a liar it's exactly he's got to be born again then he sees every word the only way you can be born again is that life of God in him to produce that life a seed must have water to grow now you put a seed in the ground if there's no moisture in the ground it's dust and it won't grow in the dust can't it's got to have a certain percent of moisture or it won't grow is that right yes the letter kth the spirit giveth it life now it must have morer to grow his word is a seed now to prove that let's turn to Luke the 8th chapter the 11th verse and see if this is true or not if if the Bible says his word is the SE Luke the 11th chapter or the eth chapter rather and the 11th verse and we'll see what God said about it 8th chapter 11th verse now he goes ahead and begins to tell there much things to say by let's start the fourth this read and when much people were gathered together and there come unto him out of every city he spake by Parables a soar went out to seow his seed to seow his seow his seed and as he solded some fell by the wayside and it was trotten down and the fouls of the air divided it and some fell upon Rock and soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture moisture Baptists Presbyterians lutherans without the water and when he's first converted he looks right straight to Christ he believes and the first thing you know that denomination binds him up into a place and the marster of the spirit's gone from him he becomes denominational and he's dead not only Baptist but Pentecost don't believe that I know many of you don't but you just wait a little bit we see where the Bible States all right of like of moisture the last word in the sixth verse of the eighth chapter the like of moisture and some fell among thorns and sprang up with it and choked it see what was that he goes ahead and tells that's some as soon as they get to be I'm not going to pull one punch today on nothing amen amen just what I think the Christian businessman and the rest of them are these Pentecostal organizations and these people is building all these big millions of dollars of things the richest of the world has choked out the glory and spirit of God dying because it's choked the world care of the world has choked them out the women wants to be active and Bob off their hair and have Waterhead haircuts wear shorts and look like the rest of the world world the preacher standing in a pull pit with practice their all mans and Afraid of the word of God because of a meal ticket if they can't ride a Cadillac and they're not even considered spiritual anymore that's right if they can't breast the best of clothes and do everything else they're they're considered they're backslid they're not so and so an old man back there old brother kid told me this morning they don't want him no more because he's old he stays right with the word what's the matter they like marst all right and fell on and others fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit when he had said these things he cried he that has an ear to hear Let Him hear oh what a parable how I could like to preach a text on that now Ser Hallelujah when he had said these things the eth chapter 8th verse eth chapter others fell on good ground and sprang up and bear fruit on 100 fold and when he had said these things he cried screamed out something maybe like this when he said oh bring forth 100 fold he that has an ear let him here other words if your ears in tune with God let him hear see his disciples asked him saying what might this Parable be and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom the mystery see what he's talking about here now watch what is the mysteries of the Kingdom watch this Mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in Parables that seeing they might see might not see and hearing they might not understand see but God's word comes right on down to the Judgment the judge them because they did see was there now the parable is this the seed is the word of God Hall what is the seed of life the word of God therefore for life you can't come to a Creed you can't come to a denomination you got to come back to the word now the seed of life all right his word is his seed and his spirit is the water now right back to John 3:14 there you get it again see see the spiritless is the water now look John 3:14 we understand what it means you want to read it as Moses lifted up the brast serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up see now if Moses lifted up the brass serpent for the same cause Christ was lifted up amen now what is it Moses lifted up the brass serpent so that the people that was perishing might have water for Life am look Jesus oh God Jesus is the word of God Amen now we're going to hammer that down this afternoon see prove it Jesus is the word of God and he was bursted open that life the life is inside the seed that this life which is Spirit water flowing over the spirit over the seed of God will bring forth the life of the seed and if it brings forth something else they some other kind of seed there then amen do you understand if the spirit of God comes forth to water the seed if it's the seed it's watering it'll produce the life of the seed that clear produce the life of the seed well that's why it's SK for I believe the Bible is a is the word the whole truth and Jesus is the word made made manifest he and his word is one and the same what was he now look he was that seed I got to hold something back in order to get in here this evening you see it's hard amen he was that seed that Eve should have produced you you get it he was the seed that e was produce but she H it amen by disbelieving God's word so he was that seed and the only way that life could be uh in the reproduction of life life had to come through that seed and that seed had to die in order to spread out the life can't you see it that's why the water was given to water the seed am the holy spirit that was in the Garden of Eden was to water of the seed man wasn't made to die he's made to live but High breeding brought life of death rather she hbr now you deny the ccum seed then I'll ask you why what's these funeral services about she's hybrid every one of us are hybrid from the original that's where you're constantly dying but oh God there's a germ of life come from the real seed that God proved it was the seed he rose him up again that through that life that's going over the seed life was given to Eve over his real church is bringing forth life again through the birth through the womb of his bride oh it's rich and glorious hu I give a little time to study Hallelujah so it'll sink in he is that seed he is that seed that was produced by the word of God be it unto me Lord according to th word there's the seat taking the word see now Jesus is the word made manifest he and the word is one and the same and that's why it was so made manifest in him so perfectly that's the reason that God manifested himself so per perfectly in Jesus because he was the seed word The Germ word itself The Germ that's inside the seed that's the life in the seed you get it it was a he was The Germ word of God the germ is the spirit The Germ is the water and Jesus had to be broken open there in order for that seed to let forth its life to water other seed that was coming Hallelujah do you see even he said of sheep I it's not of even of this fold I have they're going to see that they're going to get that word and stay right with it and I'm sending forth the spirit to water it and it'll produce just exactly it'll produce Miracles it'll produce the power of God it'll produce and it will not deny anything because it's a kindered seed with the seed it can't say Mr cerer you come live with me no no sir no no it won't do it no indeed it just won't mix can't mix death and life you can't be dead and alive at the same time so you see what I mean it is the germ that come from the seed he is he's the word of God made perfectly manifest that's the reason that in him was what that was the thing that he is correctly the son from the first Adam was the son that was promised through Adam continuing on the human race and Eve hbrd to The Serpent and brought forth a generation of bastard children born to death without life and Jesus come and was that seed he proved it everything that Adam lost Jesus was amen see he is the C Eve would have finally brought that child forth but you high read it brought the serpent in listening for wisdom understanding knowledge I'll wait till we get into the bride with that that's what's that's the reason I believe what I believe it's got to come back to this word that's the reason I say if somebody wants to to discuss with me talk to me about this word come that's right I've offered that anytime if you think that the name of Jesus Christ isn't the right way to baptize come talk to me about it if you don't believe there is such a thing as serpent seed you come see me let's just take the word if you don't believe that women should have long hair and that's their covering come talk to me about it with a word if you don't believe that the end of the time is at hand and these things I'm talking about is come talk to me about it come with me brother seed just come on right you can't be a seed and disagree with the word because the word is a seed and if you are the word how can you disagree with you'd be disagree with yourself you'd be defeating your own purpose like somebody said what would you why do you ever go out with them people like that well if I didn't do it I'd be defeated you very purpose I a sa here for there's got to be a light how many believe there will be light in the evening time there's got to be a light amen there's got to be uh something that shines on we're not going to be long but you have to understand what what we're wanting uh each of you to understand is not to look at the outside but the look at the inside and and let's listen let's read that last statement we'll read a couple more statements we'll move right on he said you can't be a seed and disagree with the word now we always look to the disagreer but take that for yourself that's right it's impossible for you if you have the SE seed now you didn't choose to plant the seed God chose that for you so it doesn't matter where he planted it you know whatever ground he planted it in you were the ground and he planted the seed in you you're coming along in life no matter where you are and you hear the word of God and you you just can't disagree with it that's right now you can fight the results that the word is trying to produce right I mean you can you can withstand it you can fight it but that's what he told Paul oh it's hard to kick against the prick Paul Lord who art you Paul I've come to show you the many things you might suffer for my sake because I've chosen you to bring the gospel to the Gentiles okay so Paul's writing on look at Paul's condition man he's a Sadducees a Pharisees of this studied under Gia he's out riding his horse he's going to get turned over you may be the same way you may have been going about this you had your career you had this idea and all of a sudden the light The Germ of the seed spoke to your heart and you might have said whoa that's true and you might try to resist it you might trying to fight it you know you're battling with your flesh you're drawing off the lust of the flesh you got habits you got all these things pulling at you Satan's just trying to put every hook on you to to keep you but you've got what something inside of you something that's starting to be quickened and you can't deny it that's true that's true I know it's true I don't want to let nobody else know I know it's true you know what I mean but you know pretty soon you can't even keep that light under a bush your basket it'll just automatically start showing out of you you know pretty soon you know you might smoke and and and everybody might smoke and you've been buming cigarettes and people have been buming cigarettes all of a sudden you hear that word remember remember it's in seed form I like what Billy Paul used to say he said I never caught a fish that was already cleaned in cook you know and God goes to scale in you yeah amen you know that fish have scales right okay and and he goes to working on you and he goes to taking you from this trouble to that trouble and you get in in in in trouble I was kind of looking at Matt gritting cuz I know know some of his testimony and all that Heidi did did for him to get him out of trouble and stuff and and it it's it's a path it's a journey it's a growth but the first thing you know there's something inside of you that said amen now how quicker could you grow if you quit looking at the outside and look at the in the Amen in you if you if you if you could connect with that that that part of you that says Amen to every word of God it didn't ask you to say whether you're guilty or not guilty it just said you cannot deny the word of God the seed cannot deny the word of God if that seed is in you you cannot deny the word of God that is not given in a negative context that's given in a positive context to every believer so they will know they have something to believe in they can sit there and say despite myself there's something in me that says Amen to every word of God and that word is going to transform me from what I am to what God wants me to be it's been struck that's right Paul didn't even know what struck him he was a scholar so he went out on the backside of the desert poured through the scriptures year after year after year until he understood that Jesus was the word he was the Old Testament that that that they were one and then he could PR write the book of Hebrews to say Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen so each one of you know that about yourself when I heard the word something inside of me said that's true I could not deny it that's what he wants us to start coming to that he said now listen he says with the word and if you are the word how can you disagree with it you'd be uh disagreeing with yourself you'd be defeating your own purpose oh my goodness think of that that's a wonderful statement I've been disagreeing with myself a lot yes the arguments with me I'm arguing with myself the word of God in Me saying this is the truth this is right well that's the truth and I'm sitting here I don't want to do that I you know surely I can work a way around this I'm arguing with myself I'm defeating my own purpose my own purpose is for that seed to grow in me amen and to become what he wants me to keep and therefore we have the great battle of the mind and the great battle of the flesh the battle's on the outside life is on the inside have confidence that you know it's true you know it's true let's just read back in and and look at some of the most beautiful statements that he says he said he says he says let every man's word be a lie and mine be truth if any thing that comes from his lips contrary to deny this word or put it in some other race or some other generation or whatever it is he's liar now listen he says that's exactly he's got to be born again then he then he sees every word and the only way he can be born again is that life of God in him to produce that life the only way you can be born again if that life life of God is in you to produce that life the people that are born again are the seed of God now the rain falls on the just and the unjust praise God what do we do when the rain comes we rejoice when the presence of the Lord sweeps through we Rejoice you ought to Rejoice you ought to be happy you ought to raise your hands you ought to praise God that's all that's wonderful and there's people that that that manifest the gifts of the Spirit in everything but the only thing that can be born again is the seed of God that's right you understand so we're not talking about a spiritual experience we're not talking about emotional experience we're talking about a seed that God planted coming to life we're talking about his kinship your kin to the seed your seed kin amen he was a what Redeemer a kinsman redeemer he didn't just come to redeem Israel he put them on pause right I I don't want to I maybe hate to use this terminology but he was dealing with Israel and all was sudden he pressed the clicker or he pressed the button and he put him on pause and he said now I got to go over and get my Gentile seed and he dropped in to start dealing with the Gentile seed to get them from every generation to get them from every Revival to pull them up to T start his life and then bring his life all the way up until he got to the back the final age where the seed would reproduce itself again and the bridegroom and the bride would become one Hallelujah and then when that's accomplished and he does the Harvest and he harvests that out there he presses the button again and picks up Israel I can't explain everything God's going to do with Israel but I know one thing for sure he's going to deal with all those that are his and now he's dealing with his and you're beautiful to live in this day he said a seed must have water to grow now you put a seed in the ground and there's no moisture in the ground it's dust it won't grow in the dust it can't it's got to have a certain percent of moisture to grow that's right the letter kth the letter kth and that's and if if the letter kills let me say this to you the letter of the message can kill also because the reason the letter kth because it's the they take the message they take the word they take the Bible or whatever and they work it according to their own thinking and that's why let me say this when the when when the gospel's preached and and and we come to the end of the service that's the time that you ask God to bring moisture to what you've heard to to bring the spirit of what you heard into your heart into your life to let it drop down down from your mind into your heart where it becomes the will of God let it drop down from your mind to your heart to your spirit to where you become one with it where he makes the life of what's been spoken come to you don't leave it in your mind let it come into your heart let it come into your life till you feel the if I could use the word the anointing of it the presence of it the revelation of it until you make contact with the person that spoke it there's no evidence of that you know him amen you know when he's near you that's right you know when he's here I love it when our messenger would say you feel something don't you a real warm spirit all over you that's him that's the mo the moisture that's the moisture you need for what you hear don't just leave it in the intellect just don't leave it say I agree with it and that's the truth and that's what I believe but there's a life attached with it there's a life attached with the word that life is the spirit that was the life of it that was The Germ of it and and that's what you that's what we want to make contact with is the reason that it was spoken the purpose that it was spoken and you sit in the presence of God and you let that purpose come to you you let him deal with your heart and you know what you'll find yourself you'll find tears rolling down your cheek you'll be sprays in your hand saying thank you God thank you Lord you'll find answers to problems you've had things will open up to you all of a sudden the weight you had just starts getting lifted and you know everything's okay because he came by but if you never sit in his presence you never take the moisture and you just take the letter of it I believe it go beyond what you believe go on for the purpose sit there a moment and argue with yourself until you're willing to say I'm going to accept this I'm going to believe it I'm going to change my attitude I'm going to change my heart Speak to My Heart Lord come let me feel your presence you know we think that it is so it's the word but remember it it's a beautiful thing what he says he says now the word is a seed now to prove that let's read in Luke so he goes out and he says the words of seed so God planted the seed so you understand that he's planted the seed it's in you that's why you may AE amen every word of God so it's not just me sitting up here and saying do you believe the word of God you believe what brother brandom said but that I want you to get the moisture of God's word the the the attitude of it the spirit of it the nature of it the love of it that's what we got to call that's what we got to ask for that Lord Let It Rain that's why the prophet of God said what they thought was the latter rain was not it was just an unrighteous partaking of spiritual gifts because the latter rain couldn't come until the teaching rain the prophetic rain came first because you've got to get the moisture of the word so the spirit and Truth he says I work I I seek those to worship me in spirit and in truth and in word and the spirit of the word that's what he's looking for he's looking for people not just to have an intellectual conception yes you have to get an intellectual conception yes has got to start in your mind but you sit there and let it drop from your mind into your heart Hallelujah and you let the life of the word change you and if you repent of things you repent he's just Sten faithful to forgive you am but Jesus was that seed right he was the seed and the spirit together he was the life of the word the seed of the word what did he call it the The Germ yes of the word that's why the first Adam was what a living soul but the second Adam was a what a quickening spirit that's right that what we got to have we got to have that word quickened to us we're not going to get by without moisture I'm not talking about a Pentecostal experience Paul said you know if we speak in tongues all these things we'll do if God permits but let us just move on to Perfection so how many believe there's a life in the word amen that's what we want we want the life that's in the word why did you speak this to us Lord Jesus through your messenger what was it that he's trying to get to me Lord give me Revelation I'm going to pray for Revelation what is revelation revelation is the moisture that strikes what you've heard to make it real to you amen that you can have faith yes else you're battling Theology and Doctrine and what this man says and what that man says in this teaching and that teaching and you're Forever Learning never coming to the realization of the truth but if you'll ever get into the spirit of the word the moisture of the word it settles it and then you can say I can't explain it but God said so and it becomes beautiful and he he makes this great beautiful statement what is the seed of lifeu it's the word of God so so life is a fruit that's right of the word so what is the seed that brings life what is an apple seed bring Apples right so the the life the seed of the apple is the apple seed the seed of the fruit was the apple seed so the the seed what is the seed of life what has to be planted in order for Life to Come what is the seed of life what is the seed of Glory what is the seed of the of the presence of God what is it that God has to plant in order to produce spirit ual life it's the word you can't bypass the word and get an experience that's hybrid but you can't have the word without the fruit of the spirit cuz it's lifeless we want life we want eternal life we want life we want to be fruitful we want to grow in his presence we want to make the rapture start with the word hallu the word is the seed of life it's what God planted to bring forth life when our messenger preached this message he wasn't preaching doctrines and Creeds he was revealing a Life of Christ it was the revelation of Christ it was a life he was talking about and there was only one thing that was going to produce that original life and that was the original word and that's the way of the true Prophet to speak the original word so if you've got other voices in your life they have a fruit they have a life they have an attitude they have a thinking and they'll have fruits that's why Satan's the author of confusion that's why he's got so many voices and so many fingers poin in so many directions but every person in her this morning ought to know by the pillar of Fire by the cloud two of the same signs that he gave Israel when they left and their Exodus are the same size he gives the Gentiles for their Exodus you have the voice that's right I'm sure most of you are educated somebody taught you to read somebody taught you your job you know the Holy Spirit teaches you and guides you into all righteousness Amen in other words he speaks a word that word has a life that life goes out onto you Mo gives you moisture that you might come into what that life and seed is supposed to produce they don't work separate am they work hand in hand that's right if he gives you word he gives you life and spirit to go with it so don't ignore the second part remember we said it has two parts it's got the word it's got the betting ground so it had to have someplace to go now when that word quickened to you it and it gives you Revelation I want you to know there's life there the word was the seed to the life right don't just take the seed but find the life of it wait in his presence sit in church a moment pray come early Lord I'm here for moisture I'm here for some rain I'm here for some spirituality I I'm here to get my carnal mind out of the way that's Emy with God Lord I'm here for for your PR pres I don't care how other people manifest their presence the word carries a presence Hallelujah if you hear the word he's got a presence attached to that word he's got a spirit that's attached to your word it may not be a group thing but I'll guarantee you it's it's an individual the word convict you he's got his presence there to comfort you to lead you and guide you and give you Revelation and I'll tell you anytime God's even chastise me afterwards has brought forth beautiful fruits that's right it's been wonderful amen you understand what we're we're we're trying to get to you've got to have faith in what's happening on the inside of you and you say there's nothing happening it's all in my head then ask God that's what he says you've got to be borned again you've got to ask God to bring it to life don't leave it in knowledge don't leave it in intellect get the moisture that's attached with it and he goes on to explain and I'm going to close Jesus is the word of God that's right right so this is he goes on this is in paragraph 137 Jesus is the word of God he was burst open so what's he saying he gets on Calvary right he dies right so now sin's paid he's burst open in other words now the life is not just contained in him right he's he's paid the price now now he's burst open that the life that was in him might go forth and water the seed the life that was in Jesus Christ was the Holy Spirit the spirit of the word is the holy spirit Hallelujah if you can feel that presence you want to call it anointing I'm good with that word you can feel that anointing you can feel that life you can feel the conviction of it you can feel the joy of it when you get Revelation what is revelation when God shows you the word it's all of a sudden the life of that word comes to you you how many have had a revelation of the anointing that comes with it the joy that comes with it the life that comes with it let's don't leave that out we're not talking about theology we're not talking about Creeds we're not talking about dogmas we're talking about the Life of Christ Living in us and not hiding behind religion thank youus religion's a what it's a covering religion is only for your neighbor it's not for God God knows the day you were born he knows everything about you he knows every sin you ever committed you might as well quit trying to fool God you might as well just be right up with them Lord you know I love to drink right Lord I got the problem something inside of me is telling me it's wrong something inside of me is telling me that I I need to be delivered Lord I don't even want to be delivered I like it I need your spirit I need moisture I need water I need you to send your spirit to make that come alive in me that I might overcome doesn't do you no good to to uh uh uh drink a gallon of scope in the parking lot you know what I mean or to throw Sim sims down here how many knows what Sim sims is yeah know my boy you never had to hide smoking from your parents that was a little teeny breath mint that kept the smell of smoke C you John you remember them things then huh how do you call them Sin Sin yeah Sin Sin I got it you you hit it right on brother no let's be honest that's right you're miserable Le say Lord I'm miserable I'm miserable but it ain't no need telling God you're happy when he knows you're miserable he wants you to know there's something inside of me that let I know I'm miserable because I'm not living right now Lord send the moisture send your spirit send your life that's what he died for let's read it again in closing he says Jesus is the the word of God and he was BR burst open that life the life is inside the seed who was the seed he was the seed right the life was in it he was the word he was the seed of God it was burst open that this life which is Spirit the this life which is Spirit don't get your idea that there's a life of the word and then there's the spirit there's a life of the word and there's some sort of extra baptism of the spirit the spirit comes in goost like the wind it comes upon you it moves not you rejoice you're in the spirit but that Spirit has a word that it's attached to the spirit does nothing in itself in fact it didn't even come to speak of itself but to bring us into remembrance of all things he said he are you saying brother McGary you tell me there's not a baptism holy spirit let me tell you what most people have they have an intellectual understanding of Christ and when that leaves the intellectual and they really come in contact with the light life that life B burst them again you don't have to give an Evidence to it you know it you know you've been chained you may not be what you ought to be you may not be what you want to be but you know one thing you're not what you used to be some life some outside spirit the being of the word has made contact with your seed and it's going to produce life it's the life of the word is the spirit the spirit is the life that was in Christ returned to the church I will not leave you comfortless I will come again yeah and I'll be with you even in you till the end and I will send another comforter not a different person he was the comfort in the flesh now he was sending the comfort in the spirit amen and he'll lead you and guide you in all truth just a change of office the same person the same word the same Creator all Heaven and Earth was created by the word the word was the original seed the life that was in the word is now burst out open over the church that it might bring other seeds to life therefore he becomes a what a quickening spirit amen that's oh let's just finish up what he says he says the life which is Spirit water flowing over the spirit over the seed of God will bring forth the life of the seed it's the spirit that brings forth the life of the seed you can hear the word intellectually you understand that there's nothing wrong with that you've got to hear it first but he said hear he that have ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit saith make contact with the moisture yes make contact with the spirit of the word make contact with the presence of the word make contact with the giver of the word make that personal you know it doesn't hurt to take a few hours out a day and get somewhere alone and pray it doesn't hurt you to sit in your car for a moment and be still the prophet of God described it he said i' get alone and I'd lean up against the tree and I just wait on the Lord and he said it would come w w w remember how he said it came like waves it would just come and all of a sudden he'd break through we call it praying through we call it breaking through we call it getting out of all the things of the flesh until you get into the presence the life of the word you're not going to have two experiences you're not going to have a word experience and a spirit experience because the word is the seed of life we want the life of the word the life of the word and that life of that word will cause all things to happen in your life all things are possible the life of the seed and if it brings forth something else there's something other kind of seed there then that's how the rain can fall on the just and the unjust if it brings something else other than the life and love of Christ there's some other seed there now I don't know who that is I'm not worried about that I'm worried about what seed is in me and when I hearing that word am I waiting on the moisture the life of what was spoken to make contact with me and cause a change in me and move me closer to what God had in mind for me to be I'm not worried about religion I'm not worried about church order I'm not worried about those things there's one thing that I I desire is that the word that's speaking in my heart the word that I'm hearing that the life of that word comes and Mo moistens and Waters my seed that it can bring forth the intended life of the seed that's planted that faith is already in you amen he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world it's got you this far and he said he'll not leave us nor forsake us and then he he goes he says amen do you understand if the spirit of God comes forth to water the seed if it's the seed it's watering it'll produce the life of the seed is that clear produce the life of the seed for that's what it's given for what's the Holy Spirit given for not a second person a office an administ ation what was it given for to bring forth the product of the seed that was planted now can you imagine the faith God is giving us something to believe in because faith has to have a final resting place it can't rest on on a promise that's sitting over here because the minute you try to rest on that somebody comes along and moves it over here and now it's got a different understanding now you're going to try to get it and boy somebody moves it over here and then it's over here and it's over here you're arguing with yourself it's in you the seeds in you he who's in you the very thing that's in you that heard the word that your heart recognized that's what he wants you to pray for that's what the spirit is for is to bring that word in you to life and and and I I'm just going to see if I can find this before I I close to see if I can find what he said here he he said exactly he says uh this is like in paragraph 145 then and and so uh and he he just says this Jesus had be broke open and for the water of the spirit and I think I just read the other he says Jesus had to be broken open there in order for the seed to let forth its life to water the other seeds that was to come and then he comes down here says you see it I mean it's the germ that comes from the the seed he is and the word of God made perfectly manifest for the reason that in him that was the thing he is correctly the son of the first Adam he was the promised Adam continued to continue on the human race and Eve hybrid it the serpent brought forth the generation of bastard children born to death and Jesus come was that seed he provided everything that Adam lost Jesus was he he was is correct Eve would have finally brought forth the CH the child forth but he hybrid it and brought forth the servant listen for wisdom and whatever and so if you go on it to read and I I I can't find it but the reason Jesus come was for the same purpose was that he would have Offspring that's right in other words Satan he he found his way into Eve defeated it now Jesus was the quickening spirit and that and we couldn't be brought back to our original condition to our original son and daughter ship we couldn't have been brought back to that by Creeds dogmas in or anything it had to be the Original Seed the original life striking the original seed to produce the original Sons and Daughters of God so if Eve would have brought forth that child anyway don't you think that you would have been brought forth anyway you would have but the program was interrupted so now he had to come and burst open and come germinate and bring life to the other seed oh my church we are so eternally secure amen we are so eternally secure the one thing God didn't leave in our hand was our our Eternal destination if you have eternal life you always had eternal life Lord revealed that to me let the life come manifest that in me and you can ask anything in my name he will give it lay down the past press for the higher calling take a moment to get into his presence and let the life of the Lord deal with you it life isn't what it seems It's hybrid it's a lie there's only one form of truth I am the way the truth the life no man comes unto the father but by me am I I hope that in my own humble way this morning that you can take courage and know that you're in the palm of his hand and nothing can pluck you out and if he started a work in you he will finish it and if Satan is trying to entice you with some some other life some other thinking some other way of living he's a liar am and there's no truth in them and the wages of unbelief is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus God bless you brother believe [Applause] me am man let's all stand amen the spirit word producing the spirit life amen amen let's sing that song pour your spirit out
