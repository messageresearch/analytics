[16:45] that we're here this morning we lift up
[16:46] your name and we praise these things in
[16:49] Jesus name
[16:51] amen you may be seated just a
[16:55] minute it's um it's a serious week in
[17:01] Texas this
[17:03] week the state of emergency has been
[17:07] declared in many of our cities and
[17:11] counties schools are going to be
[17:15] closed there have been warnings to
[17:18] reduce
[17:19] travel and to stay off the
[17:22] road all the hotels are booked and
[17:27] triple their normal rates
[17:30] all the TV stations are suspending their
[17:32] normal
[17:34] broadcasting to provide
[17:37] full full-time live news
[17:40] coverage makes you
[17:43] wonder what is this sobering
[17:48] news it turns out that on
[17:51] Monday for a space of time lasting no
[17:54] more than 4 and 1/2
[17:56] minutes the moon will line up perfectly
[17:58] and cover the
[18:01] Sun the light of the sun will be
[18:05] hidden by the moon in a total
[18:11] eclipse all this
[18:13] activity
[18:16] caused by what is expected to be the
[18:18] movement of millions of
[18:21] people to find a place to look at the
[18:24] Sun for 4 and A2
[18:27] minutes
[18:29] you know it's the sun is something we
[18:31] take for
[18:32] granted it provides
[18:34] light each and every
[18:37] day it nourishes life all around the
[18:41] world gives us the ability to
[18:45] see all things revolve around
[18:48] it and
[18:49] yet each and every day the world goes
[18:53] about its
[18:55] lives without giving more than an
[18:57] occasional thought to it
[19:01] few people even look at the
[19:03] Sun and those who can or who those who
[19:07] try can't stand its brightness for more
[19:09] than a few seconds and are forced to
[19:11] look
[19:13] away you know they are busy with their
[19:16] lives but yet they enjoy the benefits
[19:19] that it
[19:21] gives but for four and a half
[19:25] minutes people will be traveling
[19:27] countless miles seeking all kinds of
[19:32] ways to look at the Sun for four and a
[19:35] half
[19:36] minutes only because the Moon is moving
[19:39] in front of
[19:41] it and its light will only be seen in
[19:46] the shadow of the
[19:49] moon this is something that hasn't
[19:51] occurred in this
[19:53] area in 146
[19:56] years and will not happen again
[19:59] for another
[20:02] 293 but it's a passing novelty a for
[20:06] most a thing to
[20:08] study or be entertained
[20:12] by but if we remember Psalm
[20:16] 191 it says the heavens declare the
[20:19] glory of
[20:20] God and the firmament showeth his
[20:25] handywork this was on my mind as I would
[20:28] contined to see all the attention and
[20:30] all the activity around this total solar
[20:35] eclipse the heavens are constantly
[20:38] declaring his
[20:41] glory when you continue reading Psalm 19
[20:44] it speaks about the heavens day in and
[20:48] day out our continuously uttering speech
[20:52] and showing knowledge and
[20:54] that there is no place on Earth where
[20:57] the language of the heavens
[20:59] amen and their
[21:01] declaration is not being
[21:05] heard it finally says this in verse four
[21:07] in them the heavens hath he set a
[21:11] tabernacle for the Sun and in verse 6
[21:14] his going forth the Sun is from the end
[21:18] of the heaven and his circuit unto the
[21:20] ends of it and there is nothing hid from
[21:23] the heat
[21:25] thereof there is an everpresent
[21:29] Universal worldwide declaration being
[21:32] made in the
[21:35] heavens you know three times in the
[21:37] Psalms you can find the phrase the
[21:40] heavens
[21:42] declare Psalm 19 was this first
[21:46] time Webster's Dictionary defines
[21:49] declaring this
[21:50] way to make known to make clear to make
[21:56] evident to state
[21:59] emphatically and three times it says the
[22:02] heavens
[22:05] declare the second place in the Psalms
[22:07] where you can find this statement is
[22:09] Psalm 97 we're going to be reading that
[22:12] this
[22:13] morning and it says it this way in verse
[22:16] 6 it says the heavens declare his
[22:21] righteousness and all the people see his
[22:27] glory you know in Psalm 19 it says the
[22:30] heavens
[22:31] declare his glory but then here in Psalm
[22:35] 97 it says the heavens declare his
[22:37] righteousness and all the people see his
[22:40] glory all the
[22:42] people
[22:46] everyone but as we continue reading in
[22:48] Psalm 97 this morning you notice that
[22:51] different types of people have different
[22:54] reactions to the constant witness that
[22:56] is being
[22:57] made it says in verse 7 that those that
[23:00] serve graven images or Idols are
[23:03] confounded you know as some of the
[23:05] brothers and I were chatting the other
[23:07] day you know an idol is just anything
[23:08] that you any image you create and focus
[23:11] on and becomes your center of worship
[23:14] you can even create an image of God and
[23:16] his word that is an idol that you
[23:20] worship those who serve man-made
[23:23] Creations
[23:25] images are confounded by the Declaration
[23:28] that God is being made is constantly
[23:31] making because he doesn't line up with
[23:35] our
[23:36] thinking or our belief system or what we
[23:41] think is
[23:44] important verse eight describes the
[23:46] response of another group of
[23:49] people with to this declaration being
[23:52] made it says Zion
[23:54] heard and was
[23:57] glad notice the difference the heavens
[24:00] declare his
[24:02] righteousness all the people see his
[24:05] glory but Zion heard the Declaration
[24:07] that was being
[24:10] made he that hath an ear let him hear
[24:15] what the spirit saith to the
[24:18] churches it continues in verse 8 and the
[24:21] daughters of Judah rejoiced because of
[24:23] thy
[24:24] judgments so the heavens declare his
[24:27] righteousness everyone sees
[24:30] something but there are those who both
[24:33] hear the Declaration being made and
[24:36] rejoice because of his
[24:39] judgments in Psalm 50 and verse 6 we
[24:42] find the third time he speaks of the
[24:44] heavens making
[24:46] declaration it says and the heavens
[24:48] shall declare his righteousness for God
[24:51] is Judge
[24:53] himself just a few verses earlier it
[24:56] says he shall call the heavens from the
[24:58] above from above and to the Earth that
[25:00] he may judge his
[25:03] people so in addition to declaring
[25:06] righteousness he is performing
[25:11] judgment declaring his righteousness
[25:14] causing all to see his glory and being
[25:17] used to judge his people the heavens
[25:23] declare in Psalm 98 it says for he
[25:26] cometh to judge the Earth with
[25:29] righteousness shall he judge the world
[25:32] and the people with
[25:33] equity in Psalm 9 and he shall judge the
[25:37] world in
[25:38] righteousness he shall Minister judgment
[25:41] to the people in
[25:43] uprightness the heavens
[25:45] declare you see a declaration is being
[25:49] made and there's a people that hear and
[25:52] rejoice because of his righteous
[25:56] judgments tomorrow the whole world will
[25:58] catch a
[25:59] glimpse for 4 and 1 half
[26:02] minutes of the sun being hid in the
[26:06] shadow of the
[26:08] Moon the source of light being hidden in
[26:12] the image of
[26:15] another for a small space of
[26:18] time the whole world will be able to
[26:21] catch a glimpse of the sun peing through
[26:24] the image of the one that reflects his
[26:27] image
[26:29] the glory of one will be seen in
[26:34] another all will see it some will be
[26:38] confounded but Zion hears the
[26:42] Declaration yet a little while and the
[26:45] world seeth me no
[26:47] more but ye see me amen because I live
[26:52] ye shall live
[26:53] also at that day ye shall know that I am
[26:58] in my father and ye in me amen and I in
[27:02] you let's
[27:05] stand you know in Acts 17 we can read of
[27:09] one day on Mars Hill in Athens where the
[27:13] church a CH the first church age
[27:15] messenger was addressing the all the
[27:18] people that were gathered at that Center
[27:20] of knowledge and learning to worship the
[27:23] images of their own
[27:25] creation and he pointed out that at the
[27:28] end of the day the Declaration was this
[27:31] that they should seek the
[27:33] Lord if happily they might feel after
[27:35] him and find him though he be not far
[27:40] from every one of us for in him we live
[27:43] and move and have our
[27:46] being for we also are his
[27:50] offspring verse 31 because he hath
[27:53] appointed a day in the which he will
[27:56] judge the world in righteousness
[27:59] by that man whom he hath ordained
[28:01] whereof he hath given Assurance unto all
[28:04] men in that he hath raised him from the
[28:07] dead there is a constant declaration
[28:10] being made in the heavens and there is a
[28:13] people that hear it and rejoice let's go
[28:17] ahead and read Psalm 97 together the
[28:20] Lord reth let the Earth Rejoice let the
[28:23] multitude of Isles be glad thereof
[28:26] clouds and darkness are round about him
[28:28] righteousness and judgment are the
[28:30] habitation of his throne a fire goeth
[28:33] before him and burneth up his enemies
[28:35] round about his Lightnings enlightened
[28:38] the world the Earth saw and trembled the
[28:40] hills melted like Wax at the presence of
[28:43] the Lord at the presence of the Lord of
[28:45] the whole earth the heavens declare his
[28:48] righteousness and all the people see his
[28:50] glory confounded be all they that serve
[28:53] graven images that boast themselves of
[28:55] Idols worship him all ye gods
[28:58] Zion heard and was glad and the
[29:00] daughters of Judah rejoiced because of
[29:02] thy judgments oh lord for thou Lord art
[29:05] high above all the Earth Thou Art

[1:06:36] [Music]
[1:06:38] through Lord it hasn't even entered into
[1:06:41] our hearts the things that you have
[1:06:44] prepared for
[1:06:45] us Lord we ask you bless us this
[1:06:49] morning that your presence would be here
[1:06:52] amongst
[1:06:54] us and that this would be a great time
[1:06:58] lord as we turn a corner in our local
[1:07:02] assembly
[1:07:03] [Music]
[1:07:06] history that we could rededicate
[1:07:09] ourselves and reposition ourselves into
[1:07:12] the things of God we just ask you to
[1:07:15] bless us now this morning we pray and
[1:07:20] Jesus precious and holy name
[1:07:24] amen amen God bless you may be seated
[1:07:28] thank you
[1:07:32] musicians it's
[1:07:34] uh
[1:07:36] certainly uh wonderful to be here this
[1:07:40] morning and and uh I I like what Billy
[1:07:44] said I'm going to ask maybe just a
[1:07:46] couple of Brothers to come up and been
[1:07:49] in this journey with us for a long time
[1:07:52] and say a few words maybe some of the
[1:07:55] minut ministers to say a few words here
[1:07:58] in the church at the last time and we
[1:08:00] don't have a service this evening so we
[1:08:03] don't have to run off and then we're
[1:08:07] going to play a portion of
[1:08:09] our of a a message that's very timely
[1:08:16] message so we just um you know when you
[1:08:22] leave what's behind you behind
[1:08:26] then you know all you've got is what's
[1:08:28] in front of you and you don't know what
[1:08:31] that
[1:08:32] is and I think that's the way God wants
[1:08:35] us to walk he wants us to walk by faith
[1:08:39] knowing that all things are possible and
[1:08:43] that
[1:08:45] uh there's no adversity no Spirit no
[1:08:49] nothing in this world that can't be
[1:08:52] overcome by Calvary and and uh we just
[1:08:56] trust that um we've endured pretty close
[1:09:02] I mean uh these people on the front row
[1:09:05] have a chance to bend their neck down a
[1:09:08] little bit and you'll have a little more
[1:09:10] Elbow Room and we just trust that you'll
[1:09:14] enjoy the good things of the Lord but
[1:09:17] you know I'd like to ask uh you know
[1:09:20] like brother Matt to come he's been here
[1:09:24] with us from the beginning just say a
[1:09:26] few words brother Tim zler to come these
[1:09:29] guys were here uh when when we just we
[1:09:35] didn't even think anything would happen
[1:09:38] you know and here God just keeps
[1:09:42] moving but whatever we move in we surely
[1:09:45] want it to be in the Lord so Matt I know
[1:09:48] you prayed but just come up and and uh
[1:09:53] uh just share a little a little bit on
[1:09:56] your heart all the things that uh the
[1:09:59] blessings and things that you've been
[1:10:02] through and little bit about it Matt's
[1:10:05] been faithful for us for a long time
[1:10:07] he's a
[1:10:09] real real friend to me so I
[1:10:17] love well anybody that knows Brother
[1:10:20] David uh knows that he didn't let me
[1:10:23] know I was going to be S doing this
[1:10:28] so I started my journey um at the old
[1:10:33] church I know there's not a whole lot of
[1:10:36] people in here
[1:10:38] that ever had the privilege of being in
[1:10:40] that church but
[1:10:44] um you know when we were in that old
[1:10:46] church um when we would sing God's not
[1:10:50] dead he is alive um the whole floor
[1:10:54] would Shake
[1:10:56] um and when we had meetings we thought
[1:10:58] oh is it going to hold
[1:11:00] up um and I can remember the first
[1:11:03] service when we were in here and
[1:11:07] um you know afterwards we're like what
[1:11:10] did we
[1:11:11] do I think brother Billy said there
[1:11:13] about six rows on each side that were
[1:11:15] filled and it was
[1:11:18] just it seemed crazy that we were here
[1:11:22] um and now uh
[1:11:25] there's people that we don't even see
[1:11:27] that're in the back room just it's
[1:11:29] packed out um God has been so good um
[1:11:34] you know the the scripture says that if
[1:11:36] I be lifted up I'll draw all men unto
[1:11:41] me and we have a
[1:11:44] pastor that is his main focus is that he
[1:11:47] lifts the word of God up yes and it's
[1:11:50] what's drawing the
[1:11:52] people it's not the personality
[1:11:56] it's not all of you wonderful people
[1:11:59] it's him doing the
[1:12:02] work the main thing our Prophet said is
[1:12:06] stay with the
[1:12:07] [Music]
[1:12:08] word it's what's going to work it's
[1:12:11] what's going to get us through to the
[1:12:15] end God's the one that's been adding the
[1:12:19] increase you know in my in my prayer I
[1:12:23] had just read in the church age book
[1:12:25] about how that the love of many
[1:12:29] wax C in this last day and how brother
[1:12:33] brandom said we really need to fight
[1:12:34] against that
[1:12:36] Spirit but I can testify that from the
[1:12:41] old church to this church and now moving
[1:12:43] into the next
[1:12:45] church I see the Capstone setting in on
[1:12:51] people we're living at the end time it's
[1:12:54] not not a far
[1:12:57] off God's been so good to
[1:13:00] us I'm just uh I love you all I'm very
[1:13:06] thankful for Brother David brother Billy
[1:13:09] and all that
[1:13:12] uh you know it it takes a body it takes
[1:13:16] a
[1:13:17] body and don't ever think that you're
[1:13:20] not part of it or that you're not
[1:13:24] significant because you're somebody to
[1:13:27] the
[1:13:28] Lord and you're needed
[1:13:33] here just want
[1:13:36] to say that I love you and God bless
[1:13:45] you before brother Tim comes I like to
[1:13:48] have my my son David Jr come up and say
[1:13:52] we now he's been with us for since the
[1:13:56] beginning and uh he was a little uh
[1:14:01] bigger when we brought Matthew so
[1:14:04] Matthew was just a little baby and uh
[1:14:07] but anyway Davey if you'd come and just
[1:14:10] say here he is over
[1:14:20] here bless you
[1:14:23] um I had a sneak Peak a little bit that
[1:14:26] I might be asked to say something last
[1:14:28] night we're fellowshipping with our
[1:14:31] pastor my father and uh he kind of
[1:14:34] mentioned on his heart that he may have
[1:14:37] the brother say something and I I got to
[1:14:39] tell you there's just a lot that starts
[1:14:41] to go through your mind you you get
[1:14:43] called to places of reflection I think
[1:14:46] all of us personally um during this time
[1:14:49] we we know that we were taught that that
[1:14:51] God deals with the the individual the
[1:14:53] same way he does the church Church um we
[1:14:56] could even you know this our brother
[1:14:58] this morning brother Mike was talking
[1:15:00] about the moon and the heavens God does
[1:15:02] things that uh he declares and he he
[1:15:05] works in Tye a lot of times it's so we
[1:15:07] can understand our position with him and
[1:15:09] how he's dealing with us and personally
[1:15:13] reflecting you know I started to ask
[1:15:15] myself you know what what does this mean
[1:15:17] to me what's the change of the building
[1:15:19] uh what What's the you know what how
[1:15:23] should I understand if anything that the
[1:15:26] Lord's dealing with my heart on and I
[1:15:28] you know I went back and I started to
[1:15:30] think I said you know would I would I
[1:15:33] look at it is this a change of where I
[1:15:34] go to
[1:15:35] church you know and if I was to look at
[1:15:37] it that way um you know I would say well
[1:15:41] many of us if we were to Look Back 40
[1:15:43] years 30 years 20 years I and I was to
[1:15:47] ask you where did you go to church you
[1:15:49] you probably give me a different answer
[1:15:50] than where you're at right now and some
[1:15:52] of you like David you didn't even give
[1:15:53] me an option I wasn't yet so uh that's
[1:15:59] what I can do I can look back and say
[1:16:00] you know there's been a lot of change of
[1:16:01] buildings you know I Brother David just
[1:16:04] mentioned the last one but I could
[1:16:06] remember the church on Beach Street I
[1:16:08] could remember the church before that I
[1:16:10] think it may have been in halam city um
[1:16:13] he would show up there early to get the
[1:16:15] heaters going and I remember maybe one
[1:16:18] of my earliest memories is him Lifting
[1:16:20] me up to get my hands warm on one of the
[1:16:22] vents because that building just was
[1:16:24] cold and um you know so it it caused me
[1:16:29] to think well you know we really don't
[1:16:30] have a continuing City here this isn't
[1:16:32] like we become attached to a building
[1:16:35] though the Lord's done so many special
[1:16:37] things in those buildings and and
[1:16:38] there's nothing like I I mean you
[1:16:41] reflecting on a place that the Lord has
[1:16:43] visited you and they would dig Wells
[1:16:46] they would you know name the places and
[1:16:49] it's good to be able to say this was a
[1:16:51] building that the Lord did Mighty things
[1:16:52] and he visited Us in but you know that's
[1:16:55] not the church that we're going to um
[1:16:58] you know I I would look at it and you'd
[1:17:01] say well
[1:17:04] um is it just the people and I I thought
[1:17:08] brother Matt put it really it it's that
[1:17:10] we're part of a body and even on our
[1:17:12] church website you know I just went and
[1:17:14] read it just to kind of see you know
[1:17:18] what what is it that we're standing for
[1:17:20] what what is it that we're about and
[1:17:22] it's that we would all lift up the truth
[1:17:24] in this message message and and
[1:17:26] understand the headship that we've come
[1:17:27] under that we're we've gathered together
[1:17:29] in this day under a message and it's a
[1:17:31] light it blinds some you know the same
[1:17:34] light that blinds some others are seen
[1:17:36] by and uh it we we have the pillar of
[1:17:40] fire up here we know that the picture
[1:17:43] itself it it can startle some people
[1:17:45] they don't understand it I I thought you
[1:17:47] know as brother Mike was mentioning well
[1:17:50] isn't that something it it's the very
[1:17:53] Life of Christ shining for and yet some
[1:17:55] may look at it as an idol but to us it's
[1:17:58] not an idol we haven't made a Graven
[1:18:01] image or an even image made of man but
[1:18:04] we're seeing Christ revealed in a church
[1:18:06] and a bride and and we're living in and
[1:18:10] walking in that same light um but I uh
[1:18:16] had a a
[1:18:19] quote and it it was something that when
[1:18:21] I was looking brother brandom say about
[1:18:23] a new building he said it is a blessing
[1:18:25] for me here to see God's Church
[1:18:28] prospering a new building and so forth
[1:18:30] God ever bless you people be loyal to
[1:18:33] Christ stay true to the pastor and work
[1:18:36] together everybody hand in hand for I
[1:18:39] believe the coming of the Lord is soon I
[1:18:42] think we've heard all of those things
[1:18:44] echoed just this in each thing the
[1:18:47] brothers have said and
[1:18:50] uh I
[1:18:52] uh really one of the things maybe struck
[1:18:55] me
[1:18:57] is there's a little bit of nostalgia for
[1:18:59] me to walk away from a building you know
[1:19:01] I don't know that you could rimin s you
[1:19:03] could say it's it's uh you I I think
[1:19:06] some may look and say I I remember the
[1:19:08] time I wish it was just that small group
[1:19:10] where you could know everybody and you
[1:19:12] could invite everybody over to your home
[1:19:14] and I mean you could make an
[1:19:15] announcement we're all going to the
[1:19:17] restaurant and there was going to be
[1:19:19] room for everyone and you can't you
[1:19:21] can't do that I mean I could say hey
[1:19:23] everybody I'm opening up up my home and
[1:19:25] I couldn't fit everybody in the house
[1:19:27] you know um and I'm so looking forward
[1:19:30] to getting in that new building and
[1:19:32] getting to see everybody in the same
[1:19:34] room I you know we haven't seen each
[1:19:37] other all in the same
[1:19:38] room together on a Sunday morning we
[1:19:42] don't when we get in there what a time
[1:19:44] that's going to be and that's just a
[1:19:46] reflection right these are just types
[1:19:48] what a day that'll be When We Gather
[1:19:50] over there and we're all together one
[1:19:53] you know it we the things he has for us
[1:19:56] we can't comprehend and they're just so
[1:19:59] blessed and
[1:20:01] uh I thought as I was on that you know
[1:20:05] we're established in a present truth
[1:20:08] because everything here is temporal the
[1:20:10] things and the places you were yesterday
[1:20:12] you're not going to be in tomorrow and
[1:20:14] if the Lord carries and we're ask that
[1:20:15] same question 20 40 years from now where
[1:20:18] you go to church it may not be that
[1:20:19] building so the the the thing is is we
[1:20:22] have something more sure we have
[1:20:24] something more that we're established in
[1:20:26] that can't be shaken many of you life
[1:20:28] circumstances are going to take you
[1:20:30] other places and uh if your focus is on
[1:20:34] a building you're going to it's going to
[1:20:37] be this is the building that the doors
[1:20:38] don't shut right on it's uh I didn't
[1:20:41] like the paint color you know I would
[1:20:43] have hung this picture I would have done
[1:20:44] you know it's too hot it's too cold but
[1:20:47] what is it that we're gathered around is
[1:20:50] it it heavens and earth will pass away
[1:20:51] but it cannot fade it's not going to
[1:20:54] pass away
[1:20:55] this isn't a building you go to but
[1:20:56] you've been made a part of the body of
[1:20:58] Jesus Christ you're joint members with
[1:21:01] him and that's not a place you're seated
[1:21:05] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus this
[1:21:07] isn't a a a location on a map that
[1:21:09] you're going to put if someone ask you
[1:21:11] where you go to church you could say
[1:21:12] it's over here you know we've got a new
[1:21:14] building but really we've where we go to
[1:21:17] church is you're a tabernacle yes you
[1:21:19] know this Tabernacle I think it was
[1:21:20] Peter someone says this Tabernacle is
[1:21:22] going to be dissolved so when you catch
[1:21:24] that you're actually a part of a living
[1:21:26] body the body of Christ I you know
[1:21:29] that's what I would want us to be
[1:21:31] gathered together in and um I I'm
[1:21:34] looking forward to what the brothers
[1:21:36] have on their hearts to say there's
[1:21:38] going to be many of them but I I know it
[1:21:40] may be a little lengthy I wanted to read
[1:21:42] a quote because I I looked at this um
[1:21:45] and we don't have church this this
[1:21:47] evening so um I uh thought this was a
[1:21:51] good this is going to be in Jesus keeps
[1:21:53] all of his appointments if we're to look
[1:21:55] back and say hey this is the journey
[1:21:56] that we've come through to this building
[1:21:58] we're going to another one it could
[1:22:00] chronologically read out a lot of ways
[1:22:02] um and this is um one that I think it's
[1:22:08] a little lengthy reading so I'm going to
[1:22:10] make sure they could find it and
[1:22:13] uh don't mind just taking the time to to
[1:22:17] Fellowship uh around this because I
[1:22:20] think it it just helps us capture that
[1:22:23] we're so much more than just a building
[1:22:26] and so I'm grateful I think this is
[1:22:28] early in the paragraph uh par maybe
[1:22:31] around paragraph 5 and I'm so grateful
[1:22:34] that some of these any Shepherd is
[1:22:36] interested in getting his sheep the
[1:22:38] vitamins and these are spiritual vems as
[1:22:41] it was that would help the Sheep to grow
[1:22:43] into the strong faith in our God and so
[1:22:46] I approach such men and now speaking
[1:22:49] this morning on the thought of the
[1:22:51] church growing see coming into a seed in
[1:22:54] the ground ground and that seed is as
[1:22:56] it's planted grows from glory to glory
[1:22:58] and it becomes after a while until
[1:23:00] Blossom and then it goes back in the
[1:23:02] seed and that is the original seed that
[1:23:05] was planted and so has the church been
[1:23:08] the church age started in this last days
[1:23:11] after the Dark Ages had started with
[1:23:13] Martin Luther and the Reformation
[1:23:15] preaching justification by faith after
[1:23:18] his time they organized the church it
[1:23:21] died out then in there some ziggly after
[1:23:26] Luther and uh ziggly didn't even believe
[1:23:29] in the Virgin birth he went over into
[1:23:31] Switzerland they still don't believe in
[1:23:34] the ziggly doctrine do not believe that
[1:23:36] Jesus was virgin born they said he was a
[1:23:38] son of Joseph and called the Son of God
[1:23:41] but that takes the whole prop out from
[1:23:44] under the whole Foundation of
[1:23:45] Christianity he was virgin born or he
[1:23:48] just was a man like you or I he was the
[1:23:51] son of God then after that come Calvin
[1:23:54] and on and on finally the church got
[1:23:56] into such a condition there had to have
[1:23:58] another reformer reformation and God
[1:24:00] sent John Wesley which a message of
[1:24:02] sanctification and cleansiness of the
[1:24:04] spirit and then he had W filled and many
[1:24:07] of them went into this great reformation
[1:24:09] and Asbury they come the United States
[1:24:12] and this great Revival saved England and
[1:24:14] the world at that time what did they do
[1:24:17] after them Founders died out they began
[1:24:19] to organize upon the doctrine and the
[1:24:21] first thing you know they made an
[1:24:23] organization then we had others break
[1:24:26] off from there such as Alexander
[1:24:28] Campbell John Smith the Baptist Church
[1:24:30] and so forth and then the Nazarene the
[1:24:32] pilgrim Holiness and others come on and
[1:24:34] come on the great Reformation again
[1:24:36] Pentecost coming out of the
[1:24:37] organizations in the restoration of the
[1:24:39] gifts speaking in tongues Divine Healing
[1:24:41] great Miracles and signs coming up come
[1:24:44] off and when for a long time it's been
[1:24:46] 50 after about 58 years now since the
[1:24:50] Holy Spirit began to fall on isua Street
[1:24:52] out in California here in the United
[1:24:54] United States where it started falling a
[1:24:56] great time come then what did Pentecost
[1:25:00] do one him made an organization he said
[1:25:03] he's coming in a wild a white horse and
[1:25:05] another on a white cloud and away they
[1:25:08] went an organization and split up
[1:25:10] breaking up the Brotherhood among the
[1:25:12] people and just like Israel little did
[1:25:15] Israel know that when they were shouting
[1:25:18] the victory of on the bank of the river
[1:25:21] they would only be about 40-day Journey
[1:25:23] about 40 miles away from the promised
[1:25:25] land they didn't realize they were about
[1:25:27] 40 years it would take them but what was
[1:25:30] it Grace have provided them a profit a
[1:25:32] pillar of fire a sacrificed lamb a
[1:25:36] deliverance and still they wanted
[1:25:39] law the way something they could have
[1:25:42] something to do in it they want to put
[1:25:45] their hands to it that was the most rash
[1:25:49] mistake they ever made in Exodus 19 when
[1:25:52] Israel rejected Grace and accepted law
[1:25:55] and then what did they do he just let
[1:25:57] them go right there in the wilderness
[1:25:59] for 40 years they planted Vineyards they
[1:26:02] eat fruit they married wives they raised
[1:26:04] children
[1:26:06] all till their old generation died off
[1:26:09] the other generation come on 40 years
[1:26:11] later and not hardly 40 hours away but
[1:26:14] had to wait 40 years before they went
[1:26:16] over then a new leader come in Joshua
[1:26:19] and they moved on into the land and they
[1:26:21] grew and the new group now I think it's
[1:26:24] very beautiful type here that we find
[1:26:26] out long ago when our forefathers in the
[1:26:28] Pentecost they raised up they had the
[1:26:29] old general counsel from the form the
[1:26:32] Assemblies of God out of there come UPC
[1:26:34] then United and so forth and they got
[1:26:36] organized and they organizations fussing
[1:26:38] fightings God just let them go right
[1:26:40] there and merry wives rais children
[1:26:42] speak in tongues Shou in the spirit but
[1:26:45] now there's a new group come
[1:26:47] up they were only just a few from the
[1:26:50] promised land all these blessings they
[1:26:52] was fine but remember the whole land
[1:26:54] belonged to them now we're fixing to go
[1:26:57] into a promised land so may the Lord
[1:26:59] help us as we look upon these things
[1:27:02] see I'm sorry that's a long reading but
[1:27:06] there's so much in there for me and
[1:27:08] there there's even other things I I'm
[1:27:10] not going to go but you know read the
[1:27:12] first two chapters of
[1:27:14] Ecclesiastes you know and uh the Lord
[1:27:17] just dealt with my heart on that and you
[1:27:19] know we if we were to assess ourselves
[1:27:22] I'm going to encourage myself in the
[1:27:23] Lord I look at myself myself I don't
[1:27:24] stand up here perfect I don't stand up
[1:27:26] here worthy I don't stand up here with
[1:27:28] any uh ability to to to think I could
[1:27:32] say anything edifying but that's not how
[1:27:35] Christ sees us and I would say that if
[1:27:38] our focus is ever on the material things
[1:27:40] you're going to find
[1:27:41] fault and uh the pride cometh before a
[1:27:46] fall and I'm really proud of that new
[1:27:49] building and it's really beautiful and
[1:27:50] it's really amazing and I didn't ever
[1:27:52] think it would be possible but I don't
[1:27:54] want to get lifted up and start looking
[1:27:55] on carnal things and think that those
[1:27:58] are what I'm established in the Lord's
[1:28:00] going to do Mighty things the way he
[1:28:02] deals with the church he deals with the
[1:28:04] individual Calvary was for a compound
[1:28:06] purpose he died to heal your body he
[1:28:09] wasn't willing that you would stay in
[1:28:10] sickness but what he was really after
[1:28:12] was the well-being of your soul and we
[1:28:15] see that reflected God has taken care of
[1:28:17] us so beautifully as a body materially
[1:28:20] he's provided us a building and I
[1:28:22] believe it should be well we should look
[1:28:24] out after it we should tend to it we
[1:28:25] should care for it but at the end of it
[1:28:27] the wellness is more than the the
[1:28:29] wellness of the building right it's the
[1:28:32] it's it's us spiritually and where we're
[1:28:34] at and so I just want to encourage you
[1:28:37] make sure you know your position is in
[1:28:39] Christ it's not in a building where you
[1:28:40] go to church isn't going to be the
[1:28:42] building um it we've got something more
[1:28:46] uh lasting because that building
[1:28:48] probably won't who knows how long the
[1:28:50] Lord
[1:28:51] carries but um set your affections on
[1:28:54] things above and they'll last forever
[1:28:56] God bless
[1:28:57] [Applause]
[1:29:08] you you I can kind of consider brother
[1:29:11] Tim a gentle giant you know he doesn't
[1:29:14] say much but you know I always watched
[1:29:19] him all the time that I've pastored how
[1:29:23] he reacts how he
[1:29:25] handles himself what where he puts the
[1:29:28] importance on things you know and what's
[1:29:33] the first place of his heart he's always
[1:29:35] been a real inspiration to me and a
[1:29:38] blessing uh and I just not to the church
[1:29:42] he was deacons for a while and the
[1:29:44] different things he's offered to help
[1:29:46] get our Sunday school put back together
[1:29:48] but it's it's just that
[1:29:52] Dedication that he has towards the word
[1:29:56] of God and and what's first in his life
[1:29:58] that's always been a blessing and to me
[1:30:01] personally and so I just wanted brother
[1:30:03] Tim he's been in the journey with us a
[1:30:05] long time like brother Matt just to say
[1:30:07] a word or two this morning God bless you
[1:30:11] brother that's because I wear my hair
[1:30:13] like he
[1:30:16] does Amen it's uh it has been a long
[1:30:21] journey as brother Matt said you know we
[1:30:23] look back to the the old old building
[1:30:25] this used to be the the new building
[1:30:27] it's soon going to be the old building
[1:30:30] uh we're thankful For What the Lord Has
[1:30:31] Done
[1:30:32] and uh a lot of things to reflect on uh
[1:30:38] I think
[1:30:39] we our priority ought to be the future
[1:30:42] rather than the
[1:30:45] past but to know where you're going it
[1:30:49] helps to know where you've
[1:30:51] been and uh
[1:30:56] those that have been led a longer time
[1:30:58] than
[1:30:59] others you you
[1:31:02] uh tend to know the
[1:31:07] pitfalls and the roads that you
[1:31:10] shouldn't take sometimes we do we turn
[1:31:12] off on the wrong
[1:31:14] road but you know the Lord wrote his
[1:31:17] first gospel in the heavens and we're
[1:31:20] taught well we know
[1:31:22] that and uh
[1:31:25] brother Mike reflected and talked about
[1:31:27] the total
[1:31:30] eclipse that's not a
[1:31:32] surprise we knew it was coming uh all of
[1:31:36] a sudden there's been this scurrying
[1:31:39] around and so many people are trying to
[1:31:42] get in position to view
[1:31:44] it but you know the Lord said a wicked
[1:31:48] and adulterous generation seeketh after
[1:31:50] a
[1:31:52] sign but yet the sign is there and as he
[1:31:58] reflected that the uh the moon comes in
[1:32:02] front of the
[1:32:04] sun and the only light you see of the
[1:32:07] sun is reflected by the
[1:32:11] moon brother R taught us that the moon
[1:32:14] was the type of the
[1:32:17] Bride so we think of that apply it to
[1:32:20] our lives spiritually speaking that's
[1:32:23] the way we ought to be
[1:32:24] right and the world gets a chance to see
[1:32:28] the moon shining in the light of the sun
[1:32:31] think of that yeah very just for a short
[1:32:35] time and all these people got hotel
[1:32:38] reservations and spent the money and
[1:32:40] want to be in the right
[1:32:43] position and then NASA comes back and
[1:32:45] says well that little region of totality
[1:32:48] may be a little more narrow than we
[1:32:51] think think of that
[1:32:54] it's a straight and narrow way amen amen
[1:32:58] so and it's going to be a total eclipse
[1:33:01] too when we don't come in here and we go
[1:33:03] over there be much different and we sing
[1:33:05] the song we are standing on Holy
[1:33:09] Ground this up here you get up here and
[1:33:12] you if you're like me you you get Tongue
[1:33:15] Tied you don't know what to say or how
[1:33:16] to say it your heart gets in front of
[1:33:18] your mouth and you just want to spill it
[1:33:21] all that's a spirit that we can pain
[1:33:24] that we bring into this place it's not
[1:33:27] Holy Ground right here if you think so
[1:33:30] we think well we come up for prayer over
[1:33:33] there we have to come back over here
[1:33:35] it's a holy God in this place it's a
[1:33:38] holy God that we bring into this place
[1:33:41] it didn't matter if it was a mataga
[1:33:43] whether it's here or next door he's with
[1:33:45] us
[1:33:48] always um you know when we came we had
[1:33:52] uh two young children
[1:33:54] we hadn't been out of the the naval
[1:33:56] service very long we came back to this
[1:33:59] part of the country we tried to settle
[1:34:01] down in East Texas and
[1:34:04] uh invariably the Lord just provided a
[1:34:07] way and moved us out here which is where
[1:34:10] I met my wife and I'm thankful for that
[1:34:13] but we came back here and we had two
[1:34:15] other
[1:34:16] children and the Lord has really blessed
[1:34:19] and we've been able to raise them in the
[1:34:21] fear and admonition of the Lord and and
[1:34:25] uh it's due
[1:34:27] to having a church right here in this in
[1:34:31] this
[1:34:34] area
[1:34:36] um that's a blessing okay we we were in
[1:34:40] an area where we had to drive over an
[1:34:42] hour to go to church when we were in in
[1:34:44] Washington state and we didn't always
[1:34:48] agree with what was being
[1:34:51] preached but you have to
[1:34:54] take what you can and you're in church
[1:34:57] you're you're following the scripture
[1:34:59] which says forsake not the assembling of
[1:35:01] yourselves together so we come together
[1:35:04] and fear an admonition of the Lord and
[1:35:06] and you worship but it wasn't real
[1:35:09] comfortable and
[1:35:11] uh but I will say when you
[1:35:17] come and you don't doubt that what
[1:35:19] you're going to hear is the
[1:35:22] truth there's something
[1:35:24] about that where you can truly Worship
[1:35:27] in spirit and in
[1:35:30] truth because you feel like the message
[1:35:33] is in me I am the message but when you
[1:35:36] hear that message preach and you say
[1:35:38] Amen to it then that's a quickening
[1:35:41] that's not by the ministry here that's
[1:35:44] of God
[1:35:45] himself that gives you comfort in your
[1:35:47] soul to say Lord I have a need at that
[1:35:50] point I have faith and believe whatever
[1:35:52] I have the Lord can answer okay so I
[1:35:57] just
[1:35:59] uh I would say I can't I certainly am
[1:36:02] not as eloquent as the is either brother
[1:36:05] mat or Brother David in in expressing
[1:36:07] myself
[1:36:11] but I look back in my life I didn't
[1:36:15] think the way we were taught that I'd
[1:36:17] ever be over 10 years
[1:36:20] old yeah you know we thought by 77 we're
[1:36:25] out of
[1:36:27] here
[1:36:30] um like I said the firman at the heavens
[1:36:34] uh that expresses God's first Bible Well
[1:36:37] he has a scriptural promise to us too to
[1:36:40] take care of us withs soever thou goest
[1:36:43] he'll be with us um there's many things
[1:36:46] yet to be fulfilled right we know it'll
[1:36:49] come in Rapid
[1:36:51] succession but the Gentiles days are
[1:36:53] short the Jews are in their Homeland
[1:36:56] they're ready there's so much turmoil
[1:36:58] right now with Iran getting involved and
[1:36:59] everything I don't know if you follow
[1:37:00] the news that closely but it's getting
[1:37:03] very very
[1:37:04] serious
[1:37:06] um you know I we we think the Year of
[1:37:10] Jubilee uh next week if it's allowed
[1:37:14] we'll have our first meeting over there
[1:37:16] maybe be our last I mean if you really
[1:37:19] consider it um I want to read just a
[1:37:23] portion of of scripture and I read it
[1:37:25] this morning not knowing I'd be up here
[1:37:29] um and and it's the last little section
[1:37:33] of first
[1:37:37] Thessalonians and verse
[1:37:39] 27 I focused on because Paul wanting to
[1:37:43] get his message across and realiz that
[1:37:45] he's doing it by
[1:37:47] letter he says I charge you by the Lord
[1:37:50] that this epistle be read unto all the
[1:37:52] holy brethren
[1:37:58] and I
[1:38:00] say respectfully that sisters
[1:38:03] too that when the scripture is read pay
[1:38:08] heed because it's not a man speaking at
[1:38:10] that point it's God speaking
[1:38:14] right let's just get back to uh verse
[1:38:19] 11 says wherefore Comfort yourselves
[1:38:22] together and edify one another even as
[1:38:25] ye also as also ye do and we beseech you
[1:38:29] Brethren to know them which labor among
[1:38:32] you and are over you in the Lord and
[1:38:34] admonish you and to esteem them very
[1:38:37] highly in love for their work's sake
[1:38:41] even if it's their life's work sake
[1:38:44] think about it this morning and be at
[1:38:46] peace among
[1:38:47] yourselves now we exhort you Brethren
[1:38:50] warn them that are unruly Comfort the
[1:38:53] feeble-minded support the weak be
[1:38:55] patient toward all men see that none
[1:38:59] render evil for evil see that none
[1:39:02] render evil for evil unto any
[1:39:05] man that's hard to do sometimes but ever
[1:39:08] follow that which is good both among
[1:39:11] yourselves and to all men Rejoice ever
[1:39:14] more pray without ceasing it's always
[1:39:18] confounded me how we are supposed to
[1:39:20] pray without ceasing it says in
[1:39:23] everything and give thanks but you know
[1:39:25] when you're you're driving your car and
[1:39:27] you're upset or things are getting to
[1:39:30] you you just whisper a prayer within
[1:39:33] your spirit if you're always in
[1:39:34] communication with the heavenly father
[1:39:36] you'll find that you can't be offensive
[1:39:38] to anyone as my dad likes to refer to it
[1:39:42] the Royal
[1:39:48] telephone pray without ceasing in
[1:39:51] everything give thanks for this is the
[1:39:53] will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
[1:39:55] you quench not the spirit despise not
[1:40:00] prophesyings prove all
[1:40:02] things hold fast that which is good
[1:40:05] abstain from all appearance of evil and
[1:40:08] the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy
[1:40:12] and I pray God your whole strength your
[1:40:15] whole spirit and soul and body be
[1:40:18] preserved blameless unto the coming of
[1:40:21] the Lord Jesus Christ faith faithful
[1:40:24] faithful is he that calleth you who also
[1:40:28] will do it amen blessed be the name of
[1:40:31] the Lord I I think there's going to
[1:40:34] be many times many accounts we're a to
[1:40:37] look back and say this this will be just
[1:40:41] a a vague memory we'll have so
[1:40:43] much uh to talk about and to do over
[1:40:46] there to Worship the Lord um we'll be
[1:40:49] thankful that we have this overflow here
[1:40:52] we don't know the many AC activities
[1:40:53] that are going to happen in here but we
[1:40:55] do know that that God keeps all his
[1:40:57] appointments and where he's invited he
[1:41:00] comes and we'll just invite him to the
[1:41:02] new place the same way we have here amen
[1:41:05] I would refer one more scripture and
[1:41:07] it's just a one verse but it's the very
[1:41:09] last verse of
[1:41:12] John and think about this for your
[1:41:14] future because as I said I didn't know
[1:41:16] that I'd be 10 years old but I certainly
[1:41:19] didn't know I'd be as old as I am now
[1:41:21] but the day will come when uh you know
[1:41:25] brother Bram said he was an old man he
[1:41:26] was 56 years
[1:41:31] old but he wore his body
[1:41:34] out to bring us a
[1:41:37] message and there are also many other
[1:41:39] things which Jesus did the which if they
[1:41:42] should be written
[1:41:43] everyone I suppose that even the world
[1:41:46] itself could not contain the books that
[1:41:49] should be written amen thank you brother
[1:41:59] now you you reflect back and you think
[1:42:02] of the meetings
[1:42:04] and everything we've had and the people
[1:42:07] that we've been privilege to have stand
[1:42:11] in preacher and you know and I've
[1:42:14] watched my good friend Harold Brown who
[1:42:18] used to come preach for us and I
[1:42:19] preached for him and the Lord took them
[1:42:21] home and brother Doug McHugh these are
[1:42:25] people that you know knew the prophet
[1:42:28] and and had contact with them brother
[1:42:30] Doug you know this testimony and the
[1:42:33] things that he had we had the privilege
[1:42:35] of having Billy Paul with us and you
[1:42:39] know Billy
[1:42:40] Paul he he took me aside one day and he
[1:42:44] just said Brother David he said one of
[1:42:46] the greatest
[1:42:47] meetings that I ever had was in your
[1:42:51] church and
[1:42:54] the people came and and lot of the
[1:42:57] people that came to that meeting he's
[1:42:59] been here a few times for us but they
[1:43:01] said I've never seen a
[1:43:04] meeting be put together and so well
[1:43:07] organized as this meeting and there's
[1:43:10] tremendous little things that took place
[1:43:13] in that meeting that phenomenal Miracles
[1:43:17] that
[1:43:18] transpired and it wasn't the building
[1:43:21] but he said it because the people people
[1:43:23] are prepared and that's the most
[1:43:25] important thing if you want to get
[1:43:27] something from the Lord is to be
[1:43:29] prepared and so before we play our tape
[1:43:33] this morning I'm just going to have
[1:43:34] Matthew come say take just a few minutes
[1:43:37] to say a few things uh he was just a
[1:43:41] baby uh maybe someday I'll post the
[1:43:44] picture um lesli's holding him and and
[1:43:49] Sharon's holding on to lesie skirt
[1:43:53] davies's off running somewhere we you
[1:43:55] know never knew where he was at and uh
[1:43:58] we're turning the key for the first time
[1:44:01] into the uh the building on halam
[1:44:05] City uh when I first
[1:44:08] came we were renting a community center
[1:44:11] on John T White Road and they would have
[1:44:15] the Bingo and the dance the night before
[1:44:17] and we'd sweep out the cigarette butts
[1:44:20] and put up the beer cans and and and
[1:44:23] then hold a little service and then uh
[1:44:26] when the Lord put us on a heart and we
[1:44:28] we came here we found a a little old
[1:44:33] house in uh uh halam City and and the
[1:44:39] sanctuary was 11 ft
[1:44:42] wide and we had little pews that we cut
[1:44:45] off a little shotgun church and the uh
[1:44:50] if I I reached up I could almost touch
[1:44:53] the ceiling off of a one foot
[1:44:56] platform and uh uh we had some great men
[1:44:59] come through there brother Ed Dalton and
[1:45:02] different uh people came and and preach
[1:45:05] for us there first place I met brother
[1:45:08] George was over at that church in uh
[1:45:12] halam City and and then from there we
[1:45:15] moved to Beach Street and uh and now
[1:45:19] it's a wedding chapel over on Beach
[1:45:21] Street I thought that's PR pretty good
[1:45:23] typee if you and then for Beach Street
[1:45:26] we went to the great double wide and uh
[1:45:30] where some of the mornings there would
[1:45:32] be more wasps in church than members and
[1:45:36] uh you know they'd be flying around
[1:45:38] everywhere and and they like they said
[1:45:41] we'd play and and uh and it was quite uh
[1:45:47] uh you know quite the the times that we
[1:45:50] had there and uh way back then you know
[1:45:54] brother uh Richard and Lenny were
[1:45:57] Richard Lenny stand up would you please
[1:45:58] both you
[1:46:00] there amen they're the first people that
[1:46:03] picked me up from the airport the first
[1:46:05] time I came to Dallas Fort Worth and
[1:46:12] uh they're are part of our founding
[1:46:16] members and sister Lenny used to sing a
[1:46:19] song for me called if just a cup of
[1:46:21] water I I place within your hand just a
[1:46:25] cup of water is all that I
[1:46:31] demand and that song would keep me
[1:46:36] going when I didn't think it was worth
[1:46:39] it and there several times I've thought
[1:46:43] of
[1:46:45] just you know forgetting it all and
[1:46:49] going someplace else and do something
[1:46:51] but the Lord just kept comp telling me
[1:46:54] and the main reason I believe it's all
[1:46:57] is cuz I believe in eternal
[1:47:01] life and if he gave you eternal life and
[1:47:05] it's freely given then freely give and I
[1:47:09] always wanted to make a stand for this
[1:47:11] message so uh it's it's been uh quite a
[1:47:16] thing as brother Kim said I think it's
[1:47:19] important that we all understand it when
[1:47:23] we go there it's going to
[1:47:26] change you you understand yeah and
[1:47:30] remember brother Tim how when we came it
[1:47:32] just felt like that closeness was gone
[1:47:36] and all of a sudden it felt like we're
[1:47:39] though we we only had this much space it
[1:47:43] was like we weren't close to one another
[1:47:45] again it like we're we're spread out and
[1:47:50] uh and you know with we we had one or
[1:47:54] two people in our youth group I think it
[1:47:57] was my two kids everybody else was was
[1:48:00] little you know and then I remember just
[1:48:04] as time come I remember when the parks
[1:48:07] came you know and and uh and we we
[1:48:11] started having some fellowship in Wade
[1:48:13] and Heidi uh virly and just a few people
[1:48:18] started coming together and uh and we
[1:48:23] just we just started growing and we
[1:48:25] never dreamed that the day would come
[1:48:28] that we'd fill this place up I mean I
[1:48:30] thought the Lord would come before now
[1:48:32] how many have been were born before
[1:48:41] 77 well come on Richard Lenny you're
[1:48:44] born before
[1:48:47] 77 no what I'm saying is that's when we
[1:48:50] used to think it was going to end
[1:48:53] we didn't think it go on but look at
[1:48:55] what God did he gave the time so you
[1:48:58] could be here cuz you were on the Lamb's
[1:49:01] Book of Life and your name was there and
[1:49:03] he knew you had to come here and and and
[1:49:08] so he he allowed this time to go on but
[1:49:11] we know we're close quickly coming to
[1:49:14] the end so uh I going ask just Matthew
[1:49:17] to come just and say a word then we'll
[1:49:19] move right into our tape this morning
[1:49:22] and I I hope that it will uh uh bless
[1:49:26] you this morning so from a little baby
[1:49:29] he came from Arizona and we dedicated
[1:49:34] him and brought him to Texas and here he
[1:49:37] is he done growed up so bless you
[1:49:42] that amen um you know just in before the
[1:49:48] service just the way many times the Lord
[1:49:50] deals with my heart he'll put us
[1:49:53] just a a message on my heart in the
[1:49:56] pre-service and um you know this is I
[1:50:00] would say every morning with with the
[1:50:01] Lord is Supernatural I feel this this
[1:50:03] morning is
[1:50:05] particular uh with with everything it
[1:50:08] represents but um shortly after that um
[1:50:12] one of the brothers got me as a sister
[1:50:15] wanted to
[1:50:16] testify of something that had taken
[1:50:18] place she uh had a a dream uh her her
[1:50:24] her baby had been sick uh was only about
[1:50:27] five or six months old and was unable to
[1:50:29] take medicine or food and she had a
[1:50:33] dream and in that dream she was sitting
[1:50:35] here in this church in this
[1:50:37] congregation and she had said if my baby
[1:50:40] is not healed then I'm not going to come
[1:50:42] back to this
[1:50:43] church and in the dream she got up to
[1:50:46] leave and as she was leaving a great
[1:50:48] light came
[1:50:49] in and led her back back into the
[1:50:53] congregation and came into the
[1:50:56] congregation and Brother David was there
[1:50:58] preaching and Brother David perceived of
[1:51:00] the light and the light came up and
[1:51:03] settled right around him and um the
[1:51:07] angel of the Lord or an angel spoke to
[1:51:10] her and said the word is being preached
[1:51:12] here and your baby will be
[1:51:15] healed and she woke up and she um told
[1:51:21] her husband
[1:51:23] uh what had taken place and that um
[1:51:26] it'll be at this church that uh her baby
[1:51:29] would be healed and and and that has
[1:51:32] taken place that was manifested and she
[1:51:34] she just wanted to testify of that
[1:51:36] before the service and so if she uh
[1:51:39] would share her testimony those would
[1:51:41] would come to know by maybe Word of
[1:51:43] Mouth of who that was but the word is
[1:51:45] being preached
[1:51:47] here and the angel of the Lord
[1:51:49] accompanies this
[1:51:50] message if you just uh re turning your
[1:51:53] Bible to um Psalms 132 I just want to
[1:51:57] read this um scripture
[1:52:02] here
[1:52:04] um you know when you you think about the
[1:52:07] buildings I I believe this as we' moved
[1:52:09] to the new Sanctuary I believe it would
[1:52:11] be the fifth
[1:52:12] one of of you know you just think of
[1:52:15] changing a building or changing
[1:52:18] habitation changing a dwelling place and
[1:52:20] you look in the scripture here in Psalms
[1:52:23] 132 and verse 13 it says for the Lord
[1:52:27] hath chosen
[1:52:29] Zion he hath desired it for his
[1:52:32] habitation that's right
[1:52:35] and just in Simplicity if I could say it
[1:52:38] like this God wants to be where you
[1:52:41] are yes God wants to be where you are
[1:52:46] and you know many times as you would
[1:52:49] make a family you might meet somebody
[1:52:52] maybe where you meet them that place
[1:52:54] becomes special to you and I think of uh
[1:52:57] me and my wife where we first started
[1:52:59] our journey I call it uh The Shoe Box on
[1:53:03] a dirt Hill it was just a a trailer up
[1:53:06] on a dirt Hill um but I love that place
[1:53:11] because that's where I was able to bring
[1:53:14] my wife and it it it become a special
[1:53:16] place and so you you might have your
[1:53:18] your first home or uh you have places
[1:53:21] where you experience things and those
[1:53:23] places become special uh just as this
[1:53:26] building here is is very special um all
[1:53:29] the babies that have been dedicated and
[1:53:31] ones that have been filled with the Holy
[1:53:33] Ghost and delivered uh uh from Spirits
[1:53:36] and infirmities and God has done many uh
[1:53:39] wonderful things here it's a special
[1:53:42] place and it makes me think of in the
[1:53:44] scripture of of Jacob how there was one
[1:53:48] time where he took those uh stones and
[1:53:51] he he made a pillow and
[1:53:53] that's when God would come down to him
[1:53:54] in a dream and and he would rehearse to
[1:53:57] him the very promises that God gave unto
[1:53:59] his father Abraham that he was going to
[1:54:02] bless his seed and give him the land and
[1:54:04] and uh when when he when he woke up you
[1:54:08] know he said oh my th this is this is a
[1:54:10] holy Place go God God was was surely
[1:54:14] here and he he got he got oil and he he
[1:54:17] anointed those rocks and he called the
[1:54:19] place bethl which means the house of God
[1:54:22] because so he said surely the presence
[1:54:24] of the Lord was here but I'm I'm so
[1:54:28] thankful it's it's not the the ground
[1:54:31] you know what what made the ground when
[1:54:34] when when Moses came before that burning
[1:54:37] bush he said Moses take off your
[1:54:39] shoes well that ground wasn't holy just
[1:54:42] a few days before that right that bush
[1:54:45] wasn't on fire a few days before
[1:54:48] that but it was the very presence of
[1:54:51] Almighty God that came down upon the
[1:54:53] ground so that when Moses came into that
[1:54:56] place and Moses take off your shoes for
[1:54:58] this place where you're standing it's
[1:54:59] Holy Ground because it was the presence
[1:55:02] of almighty God that was there and I say
[1:55:04] God has chosen this
[1:55:06] bride
[1:55:08] Hallelujah to be his habitation it's a
[1:55:11] holy place it's a sacred place and so
[1:55:14] maybe there's been many things here that
[1:55:16] we've uh um experienced that we've
[1:55:20] enjoyed but it's not because of the four
[1:55:22] walls it's not because of the building
[1:55:23] but it's because that Pillar of Fire
[1:55:26] it's because the message of the hour
[1:55:27] it's because of his presence that's here
[1:55:29] amongst us that we've been able to enjoy
[1:55:32] these blessings and and I just was
[1:55:34] thinking in my heart about how how uh
[1:55:36] Jacob there anointed that and and he had
[1:55:39] that dream he said there was Angels
[1:55:40] descending and
[1:55:42] ascending and I thought it was a
[1:55:43] profound thing that Jesus would pick
[1:55:45] that up in in John uh chapter 1 when
[1:55:49] when Philip I believe would find
[1:55:51] Nathaniel say hey come see
[1:55:54] come see a a man is this not the one is
[1:55:57] this not the Messiah is this not the one
[1:55:58] that we've we've been looking for all
[1:56:01] this time the promise uh uh to to Israel
[1:56:04] that there would be a messiah that come
[1:56:06] he said come and see and as he
[1:56:08] approached him right as as he came up to
[1:56:12] him and he approached him he he he he
[1:56:14] said behold an Israelite who wh whom
[1:56:16] there is no G he said
[1:56:20] Rabbi when knowest thou
[1:56:22] me he said before Philip called you when
[1:56:25] you under the Fig Tree I knew
[1:56:30] you I I I think of
[1:56:35] that this message has called your
[1:56:40] name uh oh before you were in that
[1:56:43] condition when you were in lady osia I
[1:56:44] saw you greater things you just read
[1:56:47] that scripture he says and Jesus
[1:56:49] answered and said un him because I said
[1:56:51] unto thee I saw thee under the Fig Tree
[1:56:53] believest thou he said Thou shalt see
[1:56:56] greater things than these Hereafter you
[1:56:59] shall see Heaven open and angels of God
[1:57:01] ascending and descending upon the son of
[1:57:04] man oh if if there's anything on my
[1:57:07] heart that I could say to you now I want
[1:57:08] to say you're going to see greater
[1:57:10] things this has been
[1:57:13] great this has been wonderful this this
[1:57:15] these four walls have been great but I
[1:57:17] want to say you you're going to see
[1:57:18] greater things you're going to see
[1:57:20] Heaven open oh oh maybe you've seen the
[1:57:21] seal open maybe you've caught Revelation
[1:57:24] may maybe you've had family members and
[1:57:26] certain wonderful things I want to tell
[1:57:27] you you're going to see greater things
[1:57:29] maybe your heart rejoices as you hear
[1:57:31] these testimonies going forth and and
[1:57:33] people testifying and you know in your
[1:57:35] own heart you've been holding something
[1:57:36] close Lord I I've been praying and
[1:57:38] believing for you to move on my behalf
[1:57:40] on my family on my marriage on these
[1:57:42] things I want to see greater things
[1:57:44] you're going to see you keep holding on
[1:57:46] you keep believing cuz we're just
[1:57:48] getting
[1:57:49] started we're just getting started we're
[1:57:51] just getting warmed up it's going home
[1:57:54] time we might be changing a habitation
[1:57:57] but God has chosen this bride he's
[1:57:59] chosen you to be his habitation
[1:58:02] yes his presence is with you and I want
[1:58:05] to just read this quote as uh brother
[1:58:08] brandom would say this you'll see you'll
[1:58:10] be able to see Angels descending and
[1:58:12] ascending upon the son of man now
[1:58:15] because he was coming into higher
[1:58:17] Heights of you that's just accepted
[1:58:19] Christ by
[1:58:20] justification accept accept him by
[1:58:22] sanctification and clean up your life
[1:58:24] you're still smoking Watch What Happens
[1:58:27] how much different you look back to
[1:58:29] justification you who is just standing
[1:58:31] Justified and never received the baptism
[1:58:34] of the holy ghost step up into that
[1:58:36] sphere then look back down at the rest
[1:58:39] of it see just keep
[1:58:41] walking till after a while you get so
[1:58:45] light you just could walk on up in the
[1:58:48] Rapture oh I want to say we've seen a
[1:58:51] lot of great things
[1:58:53] we've seen a lot of wonderful things but
[1:58:54] my just something on my heart was I want
[1:58:56] to say that as we might be changing a
[1:58:59] dwelling place we might be changing a
[1:59:01] habitation we might be new moving into a
[1:59:03] new building but know this for assuredly
[1:59:05] the only thing that's ever made this
[1:59:07] place anything was because of this
[1:59:09] message because of his presence because
[1:59:11] he's chosen this bride to be the place
[1:59:15] of his habitation and as we move on over
[1:59:18] into another building yes we're going
[1:59:19] through growing pains and and there
[1:59:21] might uh adversity and things we got to
[1:59:24] go through but I just want to declare
[1:59:25] unto you oh oh oh you think you think
[1:59:29] that was wonderful greater
[1:59:31] things Thou shalt see greater things
[1:59:34] than these and I'm looking forward to it
[1:59:36] because one of these days in between six
[1:59:38] and
[1:59:39] nine the change is on God bless
[1:59:49] you uh this morning
[1:59:52] um I've have chosen a portion of tape to
[1:59:57] play and
[2:00:01] um I I just want to say we're going to
[2:00:03] always play
[2:00:06] tapes okay
[2:00:08] so uh if if you're embarrassed to be in
[2:00:12] a tape
[2:00:15] Church we're tape
[2:00:18] church okay because I believe that
[2:00:22] there was a voice of God sent us in this
[2:00:27] day that the Lord promised that he would
[2:00:33] return that he would come that there
[2:00:35] would be a visible Union in invisible
[2:00:39] Union between an Earthly bride and a
[2:00:42] Heavenly
[2:00:43] bridegroom that that word had to come
[2:00:46] back in the day of the son of man God
[2:00:49] dwelling in flesh deity in flesh
[2:00:52] standing in our midst doing the exact
[2:00:56] same signs and wonders that Jesus did if
[2:01:01] I could use this terminology a
[2:01:05] reiners of the ministry of Jesus Christ
[2:01:08] for the
[2:01:10] Gentiles so the Gentiles had a chance to
[2:01:14] see exactly what the Jews saw deity
[2:01:20] veiled in flesh am now brother Bram
[2:01:24] wasn't the the the couldn't have went to
[2:01:29] Calvary because he was born in sin and
[2:01:32] shaped in iniquity but because of
[2:01:36] Calvary the spirit of God could dwell in
[2:01:39] him and the Lord would absolutely
[2:01:42] totally take complete control to where
[2:01:46] it was no longer him speaking but God
[2:01:51] was stand standing in our midst veiled
[2:01:54] in human flesh doing exactly the same
[2:01:59] things that he did when he was here you
[2:02:02] say well I would have believed Jesus if
[2:02:04] you wouldn't have believed this message
[2:02:06] you wouldn't have believed
[2:02:09] Jesus cuz when you saw Jesus you saw a
[2:02:12] Galilean you saw a a a man that there
[2:02:16] was no Beauty in him to be hold in fact
[2:02:20] he had critics
[2:02:22] and and they said many evil things about
[2:02:25] him so we have such a picture in our
[2:02:28] mind of what Jesus was Jesus was a man
[2:02:32] walking on Earth full of
[2:02:36] deity and we had in our day the Gentiles
[2:02:41] without
[2:02:43] promise but to be just he said as it was
[2:02:47] in the days of
[2:02:49] Sodom as it was in the days of Noah so
[2:02:52] shall it be in the coming of the son of
[2:02:54] man and we've seen that son of man deity
[2:02:59] veiled in flesh God presented in a
[2:03:02] prophet himself yes doing the same signs
[2:03:06] and wonders
[2:03:08] right and we totally
[2:03:12] vind excuse me the word of
[2:03:16] God what a
[2:03:19] privilege to be able to to see that
[2:03:23] and so this portion of tape and we're
[2:03:26] going to uh Brothers I think they gave
[2:03:28] you a paragraph
[2:03:31] but if you just back up to paragraph
[2:03:34] 31 um be before that we're going to
[2:03:37] start with the
[2:03:41] scripture when you come into a place
[2:03:45] sometimes and this is my purpose of this
[2:03:48] this morning when when you go onto a job
[2:03:51] have you ever anybody ever went on to a
[2:03:53] new job and everybody's there and
[2:03:56] they're all know the ropes and
[2:03:59] everything and and you you're the new
[2:04:02] person and so you don't really feel a
[2:04:04] part of it you know what I mean you're
[2:04:07] kind of on the outside trying to work
[2:04:09] your way in and after a while you learn
[2:04:12] the ropes you know how things work and
[2:04:16] and you become a part of it and and and
[2:04:20] then you you join the the
[2:04:22] family
[2:04:24] well if we're going to go next door the
[2:04:28] the our our friends that are in the back
[2:04:31] I I hope you haven't become accustomed
[2:04:34] to being in the back cuz you're not
[2:04:37] going to be back there no
[2:04:39] more you're going to be in here with all
[2:04:41] of us all the crying babies
[2:04:46] together you you know what I mean
[2:04:48] everybody together because we're
[2:04:52] we're it's going to take us all
[2:04:55] together you know the expenses of this
[2:04:58] building are are are nothing to be
[2:05:01] compared to the expenses of the other
[2:05:04] building you're going to have to make
[2:05:07] the choice of being a
[2:05:11] part being a part of it making it work
[2:05:16] this gives us a wonderful opportunity
[2:05:19] for all of us together to go to that
[2:05:23] place next door as a body and all of us
[2:05:28] make it work all of us play our part all
[2:05:32] of us contribute all of us make the
[2:05:37] atmosphere
[2:05:40] and brother Brenham addresses that in
[2:05:44] this
[2:05:45] portion of tape and I
[2:05:50] I I have
[2:05:52] seen the word of God work so many
[2:05:58] times just following this messenger's
[2:06:02] example and taking what he says in doing
[2:06:05] it there was a lady that we knew and her
[2:06:11] son suffered from
[2:06:15] epilepsy and he would have epileptic
[2:06:20] surgeries
[2:06:22] and she was looking to me to do
[2:06:25] something and I knew I couldn't do
[2:06:27] nothing you know I have seen Devils be
[2:06:30] cast
[2:06:31] out it is not a fun
[2:06:35] thing and so I I I just said what to do
[2:06:39] so I I just it just come on me I said
[2:06:41] the next time he has one of those fit
[2:06:43] fits you take his shirt off of them and
[2:06:46] you go burn
[2:06:47] it well that's what brother brandham
[2:06:50] told right amen and you know what she
[2:06:54] did the next time he had a f a seizure
[2:06:58] she went and ripped the shirt off it
[2:07:00] threw it on the barbecue lit it up and
[2:07:02] caught it on
[2:07:04] fire you think that boy ever had a never
[2:07:07] ever had another epileptic GI
[2:07:12] never never cuz the word of God
[2:07:15] works amen but you've got to make a
[2:07:18] choice whether you're going to be a part
[2:07:20] of it or not
[2:07:23] am and and that's what I
[2:07:28] trust takes place amen that our move
[2:07:31] would change us from
[2:07:35] churchgoers to members of a body that we
[2:07:39] would all together be involved in the
[2:07:43] work of the
[2:07:44] Lord so it's so easy in this message to
[2:07:49] be a part of the message amen and not a
[2:07:52] part of a local body or not a part of
[2:07:55] the work everybody has access to the
[2:07:58] tapes everybody can listen to the
[2:08:01] prophet preach and and and know that's
[2:08:03] the truth amen and we all have that in
[2:08:08] common but to join
[2:08:11] together as each member fitted and
[2:08:14] joined together and each person
[2:08:18] contributing towards the cause amen of
[2:08:21] of
[2:08:22] Christ to prove and to be a shining
[2:08:25] light that the power of the Resurrection
[2:08:29] is still with a body of
[2:08:31] Believers that there's a body of
[2:08:33] Believers that lives by the word of God
[2:08:37] it's part of it doesn't not not doing
[2:08:40] its own but but doing its own thing and
[2:08:43] you can all do your own thing you've got
[2:08:46] that right but I hope that when we we
[2:08:50] say goodbye of this
[2:08:53] building and the
[2:08:56] back the Overflow joins with the
[2:09:00] sanctuary and we all move together we'll
[2:09:03] move with a body with one heart one mind
[2:09:06] and one Accord and I hope that is that
[2:09:09] we believe this message that we follow
[2:09:12] what this messenger taught and that we
[2:09:15] make our lives worthy of the
[2:09:20] Gospel amen and this is a a a a when you
[2:09:24] turn a corner or an event comes to place
[2:09:29] that it's a it's a a chance to to make a
[2:09:34] change people are so enamored with the
[2:09:38] eclipse because they feel that it's a a
[2:09:41] chance to make a
[2:09:44] change they they've got all kinds of
[2:09:47] ideas about how it affects the spirit
[2:09:49] and psyche Minds are are are going crazy
[2:09:53] and everything and I I thought well it's
[2:09:57] pretty how beautiful for us we I'll make
[2:10:00] it my
[2:10:03] sign you know a time
[2:10:06] to to make a difference a time to take a
[2:10:09] good look at yourself and say what am I
[2:10:12] a part of what am I putting my effort in
[2:10:15] what Am I Living
[2:10:17] For
[2:10:19] and this is a a beautiful tape it's 2
[2:10:23] hours and 34 minutes long we're going to
[2:10:25] play 20 minutes of it and if you can
[2:10:28] absorb everything that's in this 20
[2:10:30] minutes your life will never be the
[2:10:35] same amen but I want you to know that
[2:10:38] I'm not ashamed to have the picture of
[2:10:41] the pillar of
[2:10:42] fire I'm not ashamed to have the picture
[2:10:45] of the
[2:10:47] cloud I'm not ashamed of this message
[2:10:51] cuz it is the power of God to
[2:10:54] Salvation and there is no way out of
[2:10:59] this universe if I could say it that way
[2:11:03] but by God's provided way and God
[2:11:06] provided the way to the church through
[2:11:09] the
[2:11:10] voice of a
[2:11:14] prophet now that Prophet could have had
[2:11:17] many different
[2:11:19] names but the name William brandham was
[2:11:23] the name that he had he was the
[2:11:27] Fulfillment of the promise of Malachi
[2:11:31] 4:5 before the great and terrible day of
[2:11:34] the Lord I will send you Elijah the
[2:11:36] prophet that he could return to the
[2:11:41] children the faith of their fathers the
[2:11:45] faith that they had when the church was
[2:11:48] birthed that's if we don't move move to
[2:11:51] that place of Faith then we have
[2:11:56] Theology and not
[2:11:58] Revelation amen so we we want to be
[2:12:02] built and take the opportunity this
[2:12:06] morning as we play this 20 minutes or or
[2:12:10] so of this message that'll be my sermon
[2:12:13] to you this

[2:12:19] decision in your heart is my life
[2:12:23] worthy of this
[2:12:28] gospel you know what
[2:12:31] excuses have I been using not to be
[2:12:36] 100%
[2:12:40] involved and to
[2:12:43] live
[2:12:44] 100% for
[2:12:47] him I can't make this journey on my

[2:17:49] amen
[2:17:52] now turning your Bibles to the book of
[2:17:56] St Luke and we're start at the 14th
[2:18:00] chapter and the 16th verse to read some
[2:18:04] scripture for a basis for a background
[2:18:07] for this that we're going to TI a lot
[2:18:10] about 30 to 40 minutes
[2:18:14] on
[2:18:15] now the 16th verse of the 14th chapter
[2:18:19] of St Luke
[2:18:21] then said he unto him a certain man made
[2:18:26] a great supper and bed many and sent his
[2:18:30] servants at supper time to say to them
[2:18:33] that were bidden come
[2:18:36] for for all things are now
[2:18:40] ready and they all with one Accord begin
[2:18:43] to make
[2:18:45] excuses the first said unto him I bought
[2:18:48] a piece of ground and I must need go and
[2:18:52] see it I pray thee have me
[2:18:55] excused and another said I have bought
[2:18:58] five y yoke of
[2:19:01] ox and I go to prove them I pray the
[2:19:05] have me
[2:19:06] excused another said I've married a wife
[2:19:10] therefore I cannot come so the servant
[2:19:14] came and showed his Lord all these
[2:19:18] things then the master of the house
[2:19:21] being angry said to his servant notice
[2:19:24] it's not servant
[2:19:25] servant go out quickly into the streets
[2:19:28] in the lane and the cities and bring in
[2:19:32] hither the poor and the Maine and the
[2:19:35] Halt and the
[2:19:38] Blind and the servant said Lord it is
[2:19:41] done as thou has commanded and yet there
[2:19:45] is
[2:19:46] room the Lord said unto the servant go
[2:19:50] out into the highways and hedges and
[2:19:52] compel them to come in that my house may
[2:19:56] be filled for I say unto you that none
[2:20:00] of those men which were bidden shall
[2:20:02] taste of my
[2:20:05] supper now did you notice there was
[2:20:07] three pools or three turns of
[2:20:10] it when they went out first and call to
[2:20:15] them that
[2:20:16] were uh are bidden to
[2:20:19] come and they didn't do it so they went
[2:20:22] out a healing
[2:20:23] campaign went have to get the Blind and
[2:20:26] Hall and still there were rooms so he
[2:20:28] went out and
[2:20:30] compelled the good bad and indifferent
[2:20:34] they should come in now you read another
[2:20:37] parable of this something on in Matthew
[2:20:40] 22 1 to10 if you'd like to read it later
[2:20:43] on but I I drew this subject from there
[2:20:48] uh is your life worthy of the
[2:20:51] gospel now Jesus here is saying man has
[2:20:57] always tried to make
[2:20:59] excuses not to receive God's word of his
[2:21:05] invitation though it be firmly proven to
[2:21:09] him that it's that it's his supper and
[2:21:12] his invitation but man is constantly
[2:21:15] making
[2:21:16] excuses and if you read St Matthew uh 22
[2:21:21] you'll find that the excuses were made
[2:21:24] there
[2:21:25] also and and they try it went back into
[2:21:30] all ages went back into the age and said
[2:21:34] a man a bid them and had a Vineyard and
[2:21:39] we find that Parable and how he sent his
[2:21:41] servants to collect from this Vineyard
[2:21:43] first servant come what did they do they
[2:21:46] run him off the next servant come they
[2:21:50] also Stone him and they run servant
[2:21:54] after servant off the cruel man the king
[2:21:57] sent finally his
[2:22:00] son and when his son came we find out
[2:22:04] that they said this is an air we'll kill
[2:22:07] him then we'll have all things then
[2:22:10] Jesus said to them the king sent forth
[2:22:14] and slew those murderers and burnt their
[2:22:18] cities now we see when God gives a man
[2:22:22] an
[2:22:24] invitation and to do something or to
[2:22:29] receive the
[2:22:30] invitation that he's given him and he
[2:22:33] returns it down then there's nothing
[2:22:37] left after Mercy is spurned but judgment
[2:22:40] if you step over the boundaries of Mercy
[2:22:43] then there's only one thing left and
[2:22:45] that is
[2:22:47] judgment and we find that man has done
[2:22:50] that in all ages it's happened most
[2:22:54] every age in the
[2:22:56] Bible when God sent Noah his servant and
[2:23:00] made an way of an escape for all the
[2:23:03] people who wanted to to be saved but the
[2:23:09] people only laughed and scorned at
[2:23:13] Noah but God made the way but they had
[2:23:17] an
[2:23:18] excuse it wasn't a according to their to
[2:23:22] their uh modern thinking it didn't it
[2:23:26] wasn't the way they wanted it so they
[2:23:28] made excuses in the days of Noah they
[2:23:30] made excuses in the days of Moses they
[2:23:33] made excuses in the Days of Elijah they
[2:23:35] made excuses in the days of Christ and
[2:23:38] they make excuses
[2:23:41] today now him speaking directly to
[2:23:44] Israel the ones that was called To The
[2:23:48] Feast then I would also apply today the
[2:23:53] man the church who has been bidden to
[2:23:57] come to the feast and won't do it this
[2:24:00] spiritual Feast of the Lord and they
[2:24:03] won't do it they don't want to do it
[2:24:06] they've got other things to do they find
[2:24:08] excuses now if Israel 2,000 years ago
[2:24:12] would accepted the invitation that they
[2:24:16] were given they wouldn't be as they are
[2:24:18] today 20 th years ago Israel turned down
[2:24:23] the invitation to come to the wedding
[2:24:26] supper and they turned it down and went
[2:24:30] into judgment but as Jesus said they
[2:24:34] stoned and killed the prophets that was
[2:24:37] sent to
[2:24:38] them um by making excuses now the
[2:24:43] excuses they made in each day we find in
[2:24:46] the days of Jesus that he didn't he
[2:24:50] didn't didn't affiliate with any of them
[2:24:53] they said when did this man get this
[2:24:55] learning what school is he from is not
[2:24:58] this the carpenter son isn't his mother
[2:25:01] called Mary isn't his brothers Jo and
[2:25:04] James so forth and isn't his sisters
[2:25:06] with us then where did this man get this
[2:25:09] authority to do this in other words he
[2:25:12] didn't affiliate with him so they said
[2:25:14] he's beah he's a Samaritan he's got a
[2:25:17] devil and he's mad he's a he's a he's a
[2:25:21] man that's got an evil spirit on the
[2:25:24] line of religion and has drove him crazy
[2:25:27] and that's what he's out there like a
[2:25:28] wild man don't pay any attention to him
[2:25:32] and we know what happened to Israel and
[2:25:35] they scamed out they were so sure that
[2:25:38] that man was wrong until on when they
[2:25:42] condemned him he said he said let his
[2:25:44] blood be upon us and upon our children
[2:25:47] and it's been there ever since Jesus was
[2:25:51] trying to tell them that their excuses
[2:25:53] was what kill the prophets and what kill
[2:25:56] the righteous that
[2:25:58] come they accepted their Creeds that man
[2:26:02] had given them instead of taking the
[2:26:05] word of God and by doing so had made the
[2:26:07] word of God of no effect now you've
[2:26:10] either got to say in this that this is
[2:26:13] God's Will and God's desire or either
[2:26:16] something else that you can crop up
[2:26:18] that's better than what this is and you
[2:26:21] have to take one or the other you can't
[2:26:23] serve God in man and you've got to say
[2:26:26] this is the truth or that's part of the
[2:26:29] truth or it isn't all the truth or it
[2:26:32] isn't put together right or it isn't
[2:26:34] interpreted right and the Bible said
[2:26:37] that the word of God is no private
[2:26:40] interpretation no one else is supposed
[2:26:42] to put an interpretation to it it's
[2:26:43] written just the way God wants it
[2:26:45] interpreted just what it says that
[2:26:48] that's what it's supposed to be just
[2:26:50] take it the way it's said way it's wrot
[2:26:52] down
[2:26:53] here now they accept their Creeds they
[2:26:56] make God's a Promises of no effect to
[2:27:00] them they bypass that just skip away
[2:27:02] from it now if Russia had accepted the
[2:27:07] Pentecostal blessing 75 years ago when
[2:27:10] the Holy Ghost fell in
[2:27:12] Russia they wouldn't have been communist
[2:27:15] today now 75 years ago they had a great
[2:27:19] Revival in Russ R God come among them
[2:27:23] and they had great revivals way into
[2:27:26] Siberia and what did they do they
[2:27:28] rejected it and today the country is
[2:27:33] gone and the churches can't have church
[2:27:37] uh only H her permission and they are
[2:27:39] doomed into judgment as gone off on this
[2:27:43] wild tantrum of Communism sold out to
[2:27:47] the
[2:27:48] devil 50 years ago the Holy Ghost fell
[2:27:52] in
[2:27:54] England just after that come George Jeff
[2:27:59] and FF
[2:28:01] Bosworth and Charles price Smith
[2:28:05] Wigglesworth those great warriors of the
[2:28:08] faith 50 years ago and offered
[2:28:12] England the Holy Ghost Revival but what
[2:28:16] did they do they laughed at him put him
[2:28:19] in jail
[2:28:20] called them crazy thought they lost your
[2:28:23] minds the churches refus the people to
[2:28:26] come hear them and they healed the sick
[2:28:28] and cast out devils and done great works
[2:28:32] and because that England as a nation
[2:28:35] rejected the gospel her her sins is know
[2:28:40] throughout all the
[2:28:41] world there's hardly a a more of an
[2:28:46] apostate nation in all the world even
[2:28:49] including Rome in France than England
[2:28:52] she's a mother of
[2:28:55] apostasy right where uh finny and many
[2:29:00] of the great man preached in the hay
[2:29:03] market and Charles G finny and Wesley
[2:29:08] and on down and she turned it down and
[2:29:12] down even last week or two in the papers
[2:29:16] you find out where their great man has
[2:29:19] so Deon to the to the sect of women
[2:29:23] until spies come in and their head man
[2:29:27] found some more of them the magazines
[2:29:29] has packed it their sin of Scandal right
[2:29:32] in their government has sold their
[2:29:35] disgraceful Name Across the
[2:29:38] world why she rejected the truth she had
[2:29:44] her
[2:29:45] excuse and she's
[2:29:47] finished England is all washed up with
[2:29:51] God long time
[2:29:53] ago if
[2:29:55] America 15 years
[2:29:57] ago when the Great healing
[2:30:01] Revival continued on from Pentecost
[2:30:04] broke out in the nation and there was
[2:30:07] the revivals on the capital Washington
[2:30:11] DC the presidents vice presidents great
[2:30:16] people Governors great things taking
[2:30:19] place Governors and and man were healed
[2:30:23] that Congressman Upshaw had been a
[2:30:24] for for 66 years and they could
[2:30:29] not turn their face and say it wasn't so
[2:30:32] it was right before them but they turned
[2:30:34] it
[2:30:35] down and tonight that's the reason this
[2:30:38] nation stays she's doomed there's no
[2:30:43] hope for it at home she's crossed the
[2:30:46] line between judgment and mercy and
[2:30:49] she's elected in what she has here to
[2:30:51] control the nation and she's rotten to
[2:30:55] the core her politics is
[2:30:59] rotten the morals of this nation is
[2:31:01] lower than anything I can think of and a
[2:31:05] religious system is rottener than the
[2:31:09] morals she becomes and doing this she is
[2:31:13] now joined herself all these churches
[2:31:17] and the the nation into the Federation
[2:31:19] of churches and taking the mark of the
[2:31:22] beast what a
[2:31:24] thing
[2:31:26] why Christ give them the
[2:31:29] opportunity come to my Feast the Feast
[2:31:33] of Pentecost which means 50 when the
[2:31:36] Holy Spirit poured out on Russia they
[2:31:38] was called To A Feast of Pentecost
[2:31:41] spiritual feast and they turned it
[2:31:44] down England the Holy Ghost is poured
[2:31:47] out upon them and they turned it down
[2:31:50] America the Holy Ghost was poured out
[2:31:53] upon them and they turned it
[2:31:57] down he bit three times three times he
[2:32:02] sent out and they did not listen to The
[2:32:06] Feast then he sent again and he said go
[2:32:10] and compel those people to
[2:32:13] come the tables got to be set the tables
[2:32:17] ready to Ste room I believe that maybe
[2:32:21] maybe within the next few months or
[2:32:22] something or year or whatever it is
[2:32:24] God's going to send another shaking
[2:32:28] across the country for there's somebody
[2:32:30] still out there somewhere that's a
[2:32:32] predestinated seed that the light has to
[2:32:34] fall on somewhere somewhere in the
[2:32:38] world the nation itself is gone I was
[2:32:42] looking at this week's Life Magazine
[2:32:46] down at the where down at the Little
[2:32:49] Rock other day are rather hot springs
[2:32:52] and there I seen I believe it was a
[2:32:55] governor of the state of New York with
[2:32:59] some kind of a strip teas over in
[2:33:01] halula dancing with her now in here
[2:33:05] below that was another renowned man oh
[2:33:09] what a disgrace look at our nation today
[2:33:13] look at the condition of our of our
[2:33:16] nation look where she's went to how low
[2:33:20] she
[2:33:21] sunk look at our religious system today
[2:33:25] how can it be that the churches can ever
[2:33:29] get into the condition that they are now
[2:33:32] is because they have rejected and
[2:33:34] refused the message of God the
[2:33:37] invitation to come to the feast could
[2:33:40] you call a life like that worthy of the
[2:33:44] Gospel could you call a life that could
[2:33:48] set and per perit their their people to
[2:33:51] do the things to smoke cigarettes the
[2:33:54] other day down here a certain church a
[2:33:57] little league team was playing down here
[2:34:00] at the park and my brother-in-law's
[2:34:03] little boy is a pitcher uh for one of
[2:34:06] the teams and so he was out there
[2:34:09] pitching and there was a church league
[2:34:11] playing and there was the pastor with
[2:34:14] these little fellas out there on the
[2:34:16] ground playing and the pastor Smoked
[2:34:19] Cigarettes after cigarette of a real
[2:34:22] neighborly church right here by and
[2:34:25] could you imagine a man and even people
[2:34:29] sitting in the audience noticed it but
[2:34:32] it's getting so that they don't even pay
[2:34:34] any attention to it a certain great
[2:34:36] church a Baptist Church that I know of
[2:34:39] lets a church out from Sunday school 15
[2:34:43] EX3 minutes so that the pastor and all
[2:34:46] of them can stand outside and smoke
[2:34:48] before they come back in to serve the
[2:34:50] duty of the
[2:34:53] law John Smith the founder of that
[2:34:56] church prayed so hard that God send a
[2:34:58] Revival till his eyes swoll shut at
[2:35:01] night and his wife had to lead him to
[2:35:02] the table and feed him with a spoon if
[2:35:05] that man would turn over in his grave if
[2:35:07] he know that church had gotten that
[2:35:10] condition what is it they were bidden to
[2:35:13] come and turned it
[2:35:16] down that's the only thing and you
[2:35:18] remember Jes Jesus said in here that
[2:35:21] those that were bidden and turned it
[2:35:23] down would not taste his
[2:35:26] supper when God sends the Holy Ghost and
[2:35:29] knocks at a man's door and he
[2:35:32] deliberately turns it down sometime he's
[2:35:34] going to turn it for his last
[2:35:37] time and then you won't be a privileged
[2:35:40] character you can sit in the church and
[2:35:43] listen to the gospel and agree with the
[2:35:46] gospel you might do so much and say I
[2:35:48] know it's right
[2:35:50] but never put a finger on it to help it
[2:35:54] yourself see you just listen to it
[2:35:57] because you say I believe it's right
[2:35:59] that's just sympathizing with
[2:36:01] it I could say I believe that's a
[2:36:04] $10,000 that don't mean I got it see I
[2:36:08] could say it's good cold water but
[2:36:10] refuse to drink
[2:36:11] it you know what I mean and this is
[2:36:15] eternal
[2:36:16] life and to refuse to do it one day
[2:36:19] you'll cross the line between judgment
[2:36:22] and
[2:36:23] mercy and then you won't be have the
[2:36:26] privilege to come and receive it to you
[2:36:29] people who come here I'm not responsible
[2:36:33] for those who are are other ministers
[2:36:36] are speaking to but if it's
[2:36:38] right you owe your life to
[2:36:42] it what more could you ever find that
[2:36:46] would be more of a benefit to you than
[2:36:49] to know that you can have eternal
[2:36:52] life what if I was giving away capsules
[2:36:56] here that scientifically proven
[2:37:00] scientifically proven that this capsule
[2:37:03] would make you live a thousand
[2:37:07] years well I I'd have to get a militia
[2:37:10] out here and swarm away from the place
[2:37:15] you wouldn't have to make an alter call
[2:37:17] fart you just have to beat them away
[2:37:20] from it to live a thousand years and yet
[2:37:25] scientifically
[2:37:27] proven that the Eternal God all his
[2:37:32] power of His resurrections which promis
[2:37:34] you eternal
[2:37:36] life and Satan will put his Legions out
[2:37:38] there and keep you away from
[2:37:41] it yet you can look and sensible enough
[2:37:44] look in the face of it and see it's
[2:37:45] right but then turn it down see some
[2:37:49] some kind of an excuse it's too hot I'm
[2:37:52] too tired I will tomorrow just some kind
[2:37:55] of an excuse that's all they do by
[2:38:00] rejecting the day of visitation it
[2:38:03] separates you from God now we noticed
[2:38:07] and in the Old Testament they had what
[2:38:09] they call the Jubilee year that was when
[2:38:12] all the people that was slaves could go
[2:38:16] free when the Jubilee sounded and then
[2:38:19] if the man did not go out if there was
[2:38:22] some excuse that he could give that he
[2:38:24] didn't want to return to his land then
[2:38:27] he had to be marked in the ear with an
[2:38:29] all by the post in the temple and then
[2:38:33] no matter how many jubilees come along
[2:38:35] that man was sold out he could never no
[2:38:39] more come back as a citizen in Israel no
[2:38:42] more what did he do he rejected his
[2:38:46] invitation he didn't have to pay nothing
[2:38:49] the debt of his slavery was over his
[2:38:53] family was free he could go right back
[2:38:56] to his homeland and get his own
[2:38:58] possession but if he refused to do it
[2:39:01] then he wasn't allowed no more with
[2:39:03] Israel and his possession was given to
[2:39:05] another now the same thing in the
[2:39:08] natural applies to the
[2:39:10] spiritual that if we as inheritance of
[2:39:14] eternal life and we hear the gospel and
[2:39:18] know that is true and we reject it and
[2:39:20] refuse to do it or to listen to it we
[2:39:23] take on the mark of the
[2:39:25] beast now somebody said now there's
[2:39:28] going to be a a mark of the beast it's
[2:39:31] going to come someday let me tell you
[2:39:33] it's already
[2:39:35] come as soon as the Holy Ghost Begin to
[2:39:38] Fall the mark of the beast begin to take
[2:39:40] place see you only have two things one
[2:39:44] of them is accepted takes the Seal of
[2:39:47] God to reject it takes the mark the
[2:39:49] Beast to reject the Seal of God is to
[2:39:53] take the mark of the beast everybody
[2:39:56] understand to reject the Seal of God is
[2:40:00] to take the mark of the beast for the
[2:40:01] Bible said all that was not sealed by
[2:40:04] the Seal of God took the mark of the
[2:40:07] beast when the trumpet sounded and all
[2:40:09] wanted to go freak could go them it
[2:40:11] didn't was
[2:40:12] marked now you see the mark of the beast
[2:40:17] if we talk about it in the future is
[2:40:19] when it's going to be made
[2:40:21] manifest when you realize that what
[2:40:23] you've already
[2:40:25] done see and so is the holy spirit it's
[2:40:29] to be manifested when we see the Lord
[2:40:32] Jesus coming in glory and feel that
[2:40:36] transforming power and see the Dead
[2:40:39] Rising out of the grave and know that a
[2:40:42] second longer we'll be changed and have
[2:40:45] a body like
[2:40:46] his it'll be made manifest then to see
[2:40:50] those who rejected it will be left down
[2:40:53] out didn't Jesus said The Virgins went
[2:40:57] out to meet Christ some of them fell
[2:40:59] asleep the first watch second third
[2:41:01] fourth fifth sixth to the seventh watch
[2:41:04] but in the seventh watch then came forth
[2:41:07] the sound behold the bridegroom cometh
[2:41:09] go out to meet him and the ones that
[2:41:12] were sleeping
[2:41:15] awaken all the age back to Pentecost
[2:41:18] woke up
[2:41:20] see from the seventh age the seventh
[2:41:22] Church age all the way back to woke up
[2:41:25] and these that were in this church age
[2:41:26] of living they were changed and they
[2:41:29] went in at the very time they went in
[2:41:31] the sleeping virgin come and said we
[2:41:33] want to buy some of your or but they
[2:41:36] said we just got enough for ourselves go
[2:41:38] to them and sell it and while they were
[2:41:40] trying to receive this AA the bridegroom
[2:41:45] came there has never been a time in the
[2:41:49] history of the world that the
[2:41:52] episcopalians Baptists methodists
[2:41:55] Presbyterians the papers are full the
[2:41:58] religious papers are praising God that
[2:42:01] those sleeping virgins are now trying to
[2:42:04] receive
[2:42:06] Pentecost trying to receive the Holy
[2:42:08] Ghost and don't the people realize that
[2:42:13] it will not happen according to the word
[2:42:16] of God while they were trying to come
[2:42:19] back the bridegroom come and took away
[2:42:22] the bride and they were cast into outer
[2:42:24] Darkness for
[2:42:27] judgment because they rejected their
[2:42:31] invitation all peoples are bidden to
[2:42:34] come God in every age has sent out his
[2:42:37] light and it's been rejected and now
[2:42:40] today is no different from any other day
[2:42:43] to reject the day of the
[2:42:46] visitation when God is making a visit to
[2:42:49] the church and to the people receive it
[2:42:52] then don't put it off till next year the
[2:42:54] next Revival that's the hour today is a
[2:42:57] day of
[2:42:58] salvation and remember God has never
[2:43:01] sent a message in any day but what he
[2:43:04] Vindicated with the
[2:43:07] supernatural Jesus said himself if I do
[2:43:10] not the works of my father then believe
[2:43:12] me not but if I do the works you believe
[2:43:15] the works if you can't believe me when
[2:43:18] you see clearly cut and and made
[2:43:21] manifest now the time has come that she
[2:43:25] rejects it then she's bored in the ear
[2:43:28] with an awe then she'll never hear it
[2:43:30] now she takes herself to the
[2:43:31] confederation of churches to go right in
[2:43:33] to take the mark of the beast one of the
[2:43:35] great Ambitions somebody give me the
[2:43:37] paper in just now this new Pulpit said
[2:43:40] is to unite the churches together
[2:43:43] they'll do it just as certain as I'm
[2:43:44] standing here and the Protestants Fall
[2:43:48] Apart
[2:43:49] see because the church the Bible said
[2:43:52] Paul the prophet of the Lord said that
[2:43:56] day will not come except there come a
[2:43:58] falling away
[2:44:00] first and then the man before the man of
[2:44:03] sin will be
[2:44:04] revealed he that Seth in the temple of
[2:44:06] God opposing himself all that's above
[2:44:08] God he as God forgiving sins on the
[2:44:13] earth and so forth how that this thing
[2:44:17] happened but it couldn't happen until
[2:44:19] falling away until the church begin to
[2:44:21] get away from the spiritual Feast draw
[2:44:24] itself back and organize itself and then
[2:44:27] the Revelation didn't stay with the
[2:44:30] church remember Israel walked Day and
[2:44:34] Night by the pillar of
[2:44:37] fire when that Pillar of Fire moved they
[2:44:40] mooved with it and remember it was a
[2:44:43] fire at night and a cloud of day so it
[2:44:46] might come day or night anytime but
[2:44:49] wherever it was there was a propitiation
[2:44:51] made that they would not fail to see it
[2:44:54] it was a light at night and a cloud in
[2:44:56] the daytime and they followed it yes sir
[2:44:59] the same thing Martin Luther saw it what
[2:45:02] did he do he come out of Catholicism but
[2:45:05] what did they do they build a little
[2:45:06] fence around said we're lutherans this
[2:45:08] is it then Wesley saw it mov it away
[2:45:11] from there he went what they do build a
[2:45:13] little fence around and said this is it
[2:45:15] why the I do moved right on again
[2:45:17] Pentecost saw it why they do moved out
[2:45:20] of the westling and nazarin and so forth
[2:45:22] what do they do they build a little
[2:45:23] fence around call we're Oneness and
[2:45:25] we're Trinity and we're the United and
[2:45:26] all this what did he do God moved right
[2:45:28] on out of it see we cannot do that we've
[2:45:33] got to follow every day every hour of
[2:45:36] the day every step of the way we've got
[2:45:38] to be led by the Lord Jesus
[2:45:41] Christ amen if we don't we take an
[2:45:45] organizational life and a life that
[2:45:47] doesn't follow Christ daily is not
[2:45:50] worthy a man that's a Christian on
[2:45:52] Sunday and goes to church sits back
[2:45:55] there and thinks he owns the church
[2:45:56] because he does this that the other and
[2:45:58] on Monday oh steal and lie and women
[2:46:03] that'll go out on the public beaches and
[2:46:06] and out up the streets with immoral
[2:46:08] clothes
[2:46:10] on I thought of our the first lady
[2:46:14] wouldn't even put on makeup to go before
[2:46:16] the pope and come back and set a
[2:46:18] Waterhead haircut uh uh spree for the
[2:46:22] women in the nation and all these uh
[2:46:24] dresses that when she's become mother
[2:46:27] every woman in the country wants to wear
[2:46:28] one of them uh mother type dresses now
[2:46:31] that's right it's examples that they
[2:46:34] know that those people that do that they
[2:46:37] take on a spirit of the world and that
[2:46:40] don't belong in the Church of the Living
[2:46:42] God praise the Lord women ought to look
[2:46:46] to Jesus Christ you ought to look to
[2:46:48] Sarah name of the Old Testament yes now
[2:46:51] they got so that I was preaching the
[2:46:53] other night somewhere about a women to
[2:46:57] obey their husband
[2:47:00] obey that went out the mar Rich a long
[2:47:02] time ago but uh they ain't going to do
[2:47:05] that no sir they live in America and
[2:47:08] they let you know so they not going to
[2:47:11] obey but as long as you don't do it
[2:47:13] don't never try to call yourself a
[2:47:15] Christian because you're not I don't
[2:47:17] care how much you Dam to speak with
[2:47:19] tongues if you don't obey your husband
[2:47:21] you're out of the will of God a woman
[2:47:24] that wears shorts and does these things
[2:47:27] that she does on the street don't call
[2:47:29] yourself a Christian you want to have
[2:47:31] the world and still hold your testimony
[2:47:34] you cannot do that in the presence of
[2:47:36] God when you know better than to do
[2:47:41] it notice bored in the a marked away
[2:47:45] then you'll never hear remember that's a
[2:47:47] sign of closing the ear years you won't
[2:47:50] hear it no more you won't listen You'll
[2:47:52] never be able to get to it again oh she
[2:47:54] don't believe that oh my don't tell her
[2:47:56] she believes it no she tell you right
[2:47:58] she don't know
[2:48:00] it how could a a lady just to ask you
[2:48:04] how could a lady as I spoke Sunday last
[2:48:07] Sunday night a week ago tonight on a red
[2:48:10] flashing light how that the the the Run
[2:48:14] of women has become prettier than it
[2:48:16] ever was that's nothing nothing against
[2:48:18] a woman now that's just but how she
[2:48:21] controls that see that she's got that
[2:48:24] way to put her in a Temptation like Eve
[2:48:27] was put before the
[2:48:29] tree every man every son that comes to
[2:48:32] God's got to go through that hour
[2:48:35] testing this is the age of women this
[2:48:39] nation is or she has to go through that
[2:48:41] testing if she can be a pretty woman and
[2:48:44] act like a
[2:48:45] sister the Lord's blessings upon her
[2:48:49] but when she can get herself to to know
[2:48:52] this and display herself absolutely
[2:48:56] shows that she's got a a bad Spirit on
[2:48:59] her she don't mean to be that way I
[2:49:02] don't think many of them don't but they
[2:49:05] don't realize
[2:49:11] that it's all on
[2:49:13] tape so you know you don't just cuz I
[2:49:17] stopped it don't mean you can't go pick
[2:49:19] it
[2:49:20] up right but let's just look at what
[2:49:24] he's saying he says there's an
[2:49:28] invitation a time that's given to you to
[2:49:32] say I'm going to give my all did you
[2:49:35] read that and I thought it was it it was
[2:49:39] beautiful he
[2:49:41] said he said remember Israel walked Day
[2:49:45] and Night by the pillar of Fire when the
[2:49:49] pillar of fire moved they moved with it
[2:49:52] and remember the fire at night and the
[2:49:55] cloud by day isn't it amazing that this
[2:49:58] message has got
[2:50:02] both it's got
[2:50:05] both to move right with it to stay with
[2:50:08] it when it moves to move with it not no
[2:50:12] excuses amen God will provide a
[2:50:17] way
[2:50:21] he says it appear by day so it might
[2:50:25] come day or night any time but whenever
[2:50:29] it was there was a a prary made and they
[2:50:34] would that they would not fail to see it
[2:50:38] it was light at night and A Cloud by by
[2:50:42] the daytime and they followed it yes sir
[2:50:45] the same
[2:50:47] thing now this is what you this is what
[2:50:49] we can do we can't make an excuse not to
[2:50:53] follow this message
[2:50:55] 100% we do not take this message and try
[2:50:59] to fit the message to the trend of the
[2:51:02] world we can't make excuses for this
[2:51:05] message amen the message called out the
[2:51:09] condition of the world just the way it
[2:51:11] is stay with the message stay with the
[2:51:15] message don't make an excuse not the
[2:51:18] follow it be 100% sold out to it and
[2:51:23] this is what I'm saying this is an
[2:51:26] opportunity for there to be a change in
[2:51:29] your life leaving this building you
[2:51:32] could go into something that's brand new
[2:51:35] you can become a part of it you can get
[2:51:38] in there 100% you can live your life
[2:51:41] 100% you could come to church living
[2:51:44] holy you could come to this or you can
[2:51:47] be a spot in a room Wrinkle In in the
[2:51:50] the the
[2:51:55] feast and you know what he said when you
[2:51:58] they were called to go free can you
[2:52:00] imagine that you owed didn't matter how
[2:52:04] much you owed that's right when that
[2:52:06] trumpet
[2:52:08] blew your debt was paid
[2:52:13] for you understand what would happen if
[2:52:16] you owed money that person could take
[2:52:19] you into servitude you'd sell your
[2:52:21] children as Farm Workers as maids and
[2:52:25] they would work in that home paying the
[2:52:28] debt
[2:52:30] down but every seven years they blew a
[2:52:34] trumpet and they wiped the Slate
[2:52:37] completely clean all over Israel every
[2:52:42] Israel right was now free to go back to
[2:52:45] their land and resume their life debt
[2:52:48] free
[2:52:49] could you imagine
[2:52:51] somebody not wanting to go take life
[2:52:56] stay in bondage to sin stay in bondage
[2:52:59] to Habits Stay in bondage to things of
[2:53:02] the world stay in bondage to sports stay
[2:53:05] in bondage to politics when we have an
[2:53:10] opportunity we just heard the
[2:53:13] trumpet we just listen to 20 minutes of
[2:53:16] the Trump of God for the Trump shall
[2:53:18] sound
[2:53:22] we've heard the shout The Voice the
[2:53:25] Trump of God and we can go
[2:53:29] free into the freedom that we have in
[2:53:33] Christ Jesus living by the
[2:53:37] resurrection not just for it but by it
[2:53:41] that power in our lives to
[2:53:44] overcome and we can do that we can't do
[2:53:47] it on our own
[2:53:50] he invites us and just like he's invi he
[2:53:53] inviting all of us to make a commitment
[2:53:57] all of us to make a
[2:53:59] decision all of us to to ask
[2:54:03] yourself am I going to live by this
[2:54:06] gospel amen move when it moves go when
[2:54:10] it goes stay with it 100% is the choice
[2:54:14] that that's given to you there's a lot
[2:54:17] of things offered out there in the
[2:54:20] world you know a lot of Pleasures a lot
[2:54:24] of
[2:54:25] careers a lot of things but let me tell
[2:54:28] you they're
[2:54:31] temporary they're
[2:54:35] temporary I remember most of you
[2:54:38] probably aren't old enough to remember
[2:54:40] the Sha of Iran richest man in the world
[2:54:44] he he flew every place he went he
[2:54:46] brought a hospital with
[2:54:50] him a comp an
[2:54:52] airliner
[2:54:53] complete Hospital doctors surgeons
[2:54:57] everybody guess what happened to him he
[2:55:00] died just the
[2:55:03] same and here God's offering eternal
[2:55:08] life where you'll never
[2:55:12] die you live forever
[2:55:17] am didn't he say if I gave you a pill
[2:55:20] take this pill you'll live A Thousand
[2:55:22] Years well I'll guarantee you I don't
[2:55:24] think a real believer would take that
[2:55:26] bill I don't want a thousand years of
[2:55:30] this I can't even imagine where this is
[2:55:35] going but I don't have to because I have
[2:55:38] a pillar of fire I have a cloud I have
[2:55:41] something that I can follow I have
[2:55:44] something that I can stay with something
[2:55:47] I can live for amen something that's got
[2:55:50] a reward Beyond whatever you could think
[2:55:55] don't give up on anybody you just live
[2:55:58] more the more faithful you live the more
[2:56:02] True to this word you live the closer
[2:56:05] the that the ones that you love are
[2:56:07] coming to
[2:56:12] it but the more you compromise it the
[2:56:15] easier it's for them to stay away you
[2:56:17] come sold out to God's word you'll have
[2:56:20] an effect on everybody he promised us
[2:56:23] that it's a
[2:56:25] promise and just look it just he says he
[2:56:29] says it
[2:56:31] moves he says Pentecost saw it and what
[2:56:34] did they do they moved out of the Wesley
[2:56:36] the nazarin and so forth what did they
[2:56:39] do they built their little fences right
[2:56:42] now this is what he comes down he says
[2:56:44] we cannot do that we've got to follow
[2:56:48] every day every hour of the day every
[2:56:52] step of the way we've got to be led by
[2:56:56] the Lord Jesus if we don't we take an
[2:57:02] organizational life and a life that
[2:57:05] doesn't follow Christ daily is not
[2:57:08] worthy do you understand if we don't
[2:57:11] follow this daily we take on an
[2:57:13] organizational life people say well we
[2:57:15] won't be organized we'll never be a
[2:57:17] denomination but we got an
[2:57:19] organizational
[2:57:22] life and then he described it right we
[2:57:25] can sit in church and agree with it we
[2:57:27] can go Amen to it he says but that's
[2:57:29] just sympathizing with it and that's
[2:57:32] what an organizational life is it's
[2:57:34] recognizing the truth and sympathizing
[2:57:37] with it but has excuses for everything
[2:57:40] that comes along that they can't live
[2:57:43] 100% for
[2:57:46] it I don't want an organiz ational life
[2:57:48] it's too late it's too
[2:57:53] late
[2:57:55] but let maybe in your own personal life
[2:57:59] this gives something to you to have a
[2:58:02] place that you're going to turn a corner
[2:58:05] you can you can say okay we're we're
[2:58:08] making a move I'm going to make a move
[2:58:11] spiritually yes let the natural type the
[2:58:15] spiritual I'm going to make a life more
[2:58:17] dedicated ated I'm going to reach out
[2:58:19] I'm going
[2:58:20] to I'm I'm going to be I'm going to be
[2:58:23] Christlike I'm going to continue I'm
[2:58:25] going to live my whole life for the
[2:58:28] gospel he says we don't want to be a
[2:58:31] Christian on
[2:58:34] Sunday we we want to go out and I I'm
[2:58:36] just praying that that in our
[2:58:41] life
[2:58:42] that and I and
[2:58:45] I my own self
[2:58:51] I want to make it's going to be such a
[2:58:54] burden lifted off of me that we're that
[2:58:58] it's done that I can be back in position
[2:59:00] myself where I can be led every day and
[2:59:04] I believe God led me to build it and and
[2:59:07] it took a lot of work it took a lot of
[2:59:09] money it took a lot of time but that's
[2:59:12] done you understand you can't try to
[2:59:16] there's no Rewards of the past our
[2:59:20] reward is to follow
[2:59:21] him and he'll lead us and go forward and
[2:59:26] see what he has we'll we'll finish up
[2:59:28] our little remodeling here and we we'll
[2:59:31] go forward but I I'm anxious for what
[2:59:33] God has and I want to invite
[2:59:36] you to be a part of
[2:59:40] it I want you to know it's going to take
[2:59:43] you your
[2:59:45] prayers your life your
[2:59:49] faith to to see him walk in our midst
[2:59:54] we're not here to build a a monument to
[2:59:58] anything we're here to follow the word
[3:00:01] of God that was brought to us in this
[3:00:03] day through Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30
[3:00:07] Revelations 10:7 that the life that was
[3:00:11] manifested in the messenger of this
[3:00:15] age whom we've had the privilege to
[3:00:22] hear and
[3:00:24] follow and I'd like to read these two
[3:00:27] statements in
[3:00:29] closing this is paragraph 2
[3:00:33] 264 now the only way to
[3:00:36] live a life
[3:00:39] Worthy is to let Christ and his
[3:00:44] word which he is the word
[3:00:48] reflect itself so perfect in you till
[3:00:54] God's vindicates what he said in the
[3:00:59] word for Christ died that he might
[3:01:03] present himself before God a
[3:01:07] sacrifice and it returned back in the
[3:01:12] form of the Holy Spirit to reflect
[3:01:16] himself through his people to carry on
[3:01:21] his work reflecting himself through you
[3:01:25] to fulfill his promised word in these
[3:01:31] Future
[3:01:34] Days that's why he died that he could
[3:01:37] present a sacrifice to God that he might
[3:01:41] come and dwell in
[3:01:44] you how many want them to dwell in you
[3:01:50] what's the first thing you got to do cut
[3:01:53] the
[3:01:55] excuses get rid of the
[3:01:58] excuses don't come up with an
[3:02:04] excuse you know I just thought you know
[3:02:08] I I I used to like the Rangers and I
[3:02:10] used to go to the Rangers game when I
[3:02:12] finally gave up the Rangers and quit it
[3:02:14] and said I'm done with them you know I
[3:02:16] don't know a player on the team anymore
[3:02:18] it just wasn't for me they won the World
[3:02:21] Series good I'm glad because as long as
[3:02:25] I was hanging out with them they never
[3:02:27] one cuz I'm not meant to hang out with
[3:02:29] them I'm not to walk with them and
[3:02:31] everything you know what I mean I okay
[3:02:34] there there's no more
[3:02:36] excuses I know some of you like uh what
[3:02:39] a soccer football you probably know all
[3:02:42] the guys that uh run around that ain't
[3:02:45] our thing our thing's eternal life
[3:02:48] through Christ Jesus so that's the only
[3:02:51] way just just let's put that paragraph
[3:02:54] back up let's read that again listen to
[3:02:55] it closely now the only way to live a
[3:02:59] life Worthy is to let Christ and his
[3:03:04] word which he is the word reflect itself
[3:03:09] so perfect in
[3:03:12] you till God
[3:03:15] vindicates what he said in the
[3:03:21] word till God vindicates in you what he
[3:03:24] said in the word for Christ
[3:03:28] died that he might present himself
[3:03:32] before God a
[3:03:34] sacrifice and
[3:03:37] it returned back in the form of the holy
[3:03:43] spirit amen to present himself as
[3:03:47] sacrifice
[3:03:48] and then that spirit that was in him
[3:03:51] returned back on you in the form of the
[3:03:53] holy spirit so what the holy spirit is
[3:03:56] is the same spirit that was in Christ
[3:03:58] Jesus in you to reflect himself through
[3:04:02] his
[3:04:06] people to carry on his
[3:04:10] work reflecting himself through you Amen
[3:04:16] to fulfill F his promised word in these
[3:04:20] Future
[3:04:23] Days paragraph
[3:04:26] 270 and
[3:04:28] today when the evening lights are
[3:04:32] shining and there's not a man in his
[3:04:36] right
[3:04:37] mind but what can say any Bible scholar
[3:04:42] looking at the Bible knows this is the
[3:04:46] last days
[3:04:48] then it behooves us to fall from these
[3:04:52] big to it behooves us to fall from these
[3:04:57] big walls or get away from these things
[3:05:02] and to get into the righteousness of
[3:05:05] Jesus Christ in this last day and take
[3:05:10] on the Seal of God before the devil
[3:05:13] gives us the mark of the beast oh my
[3:05:17] yeah
[3:05:18] pray God to let the light of this day
[3:05:23] rise in you to be an obedient servant to
[3:05:28] God and then let the fruit of the Holy
[3:05:33] let the fruit of the spirit ever remain
[3:05:36] in your life and that is life that is a
[3:05:40] life worthy of the Gospel let me say
[3:05:44] this in closing the only way
[3:05:48] the only way that you can live a life
[3:05:52] worthy of the Gospel is let the gospel
[3:05:58] itself every bit of the Gospel come into
[3:06:03] you and reflect his promises back let
[3:06:08] them vindicate let God living you and
[3:06:13] vindicate the promise of this day amen
[3:06:19] is
[3:06:23] that let that be as all the brothers got
[3:06:27] up in here and say is not look at our
[3:06:31] building let's look at our life let's
[3:06:34] look at these people what is it about
[3:06:36] these people they follow the prophet
[3:06:39] they follow the message and you say the
[3:06:41] prophet what's that mean the prophet it
[3:06:44] was the scriptures fulfilled they re
[3:06:47] recognized the scriptures being
[3:06:49] fulfilled they recognized the Bible
[3:06:52] promised that the spirit of Christ would
[3:06:55] come dwell in a a a a a a
[3:06:59] vessel a human vessel that's what we
[3:07:02] call a prophet one that speaks lip to
[3:07:05] ear to God that that would come and he'd
[3:07:08] be manifested he'd give a message to the
[3:07:11] church and that message is the only
[3:07:14] thing that frees her from the deception
[3:07:19] of the
[3:07:21] devil everybody's out there's a
[3:07:25] Christian but Satan appears as an angel
[3:07:28] of Light and there's only one way to
[3:07:32] discern that angel of Light from Christ
[3:07:35] is by revelation of the pure word of
[3:07:41] Goden so it's not anything to play with
[3:07:44] you have the opportunity to be become
[3:07:47] one with the word of God to live your
[3:07:50] life have eternal life be filled with
[3:07:54] every promise that he can reflect
[3:07:56] himself in you and it's offered to you
[3:07:59] and what did Brother B says he says the
[3:08:01] Le Satan sends all his Legions out there
[3:08:05] to keep you from
[3:08:07] it amen he'll give you your own personal
[3:08:12] demon oh
[3:08:14] yeah a Tormentor
[3:08:18] to keep you from it amen but boy when
[3:08:21] you want it so bad you just start
[3:08:23] recognizing that devil and you say Satan
[3:08:27] get behind me I know you you're my own
[3:08:30] personal
[3:08:32] devil you're my
[3:08:34] Tormentor I'm tired of
[3:08:37] you and resist him and he'll flee don't
[3:08:42] make
[3:08:45] excuses when Satan tempts you that's not
[3:08:49] you that's not you when you fail that's
[3:08:54] not you that's not the real you the real
[3:08:57] you is a believer of this word of God
[3:08:59] that's who you are let's take our
[3:09:02] position as one of the Brethren said
[3:09:04] let's take our place let's realize what
[3:09:07] we stand
[3:09:09] for we're not trying to build a new
[3:09:11] religion that's we're not trying to
[3:09:14] build a new Fellowship we're not trying
[3:09:16] to create a new movement we're not
[3:09:18] trying to get something that's excited
[3:09:20] we're not trying to have better music
[3:09:22] and more
[3:09:24] Talent we let anybody sing who
[3:09:28] sings you want to come sing you can
[3:09:30] squeak out a tune in this church and we
[3:09:33] all might be plugging our ears but you
[3:09:35] got a right to do
[3:09:37] it it's not reserved for The Talented
[3:09:40] it's reserved to those that love
[3:09:44] God we're not interested in person ality
[3:09:48] we're interested in one thing and one
[3:09:51] thing only God sent a voice my sheep
[3:09:54] hear my voice and another they won't
[3:09:57] follow let's make that what we represent
[3:10:01] let's make that what we stand for let
[3:10:04] let us all in common have an absolute
[3:10:09] and that absolute is the message of
[3:10:12] Malachi 45 Luke 17:30 and Revelations
[3:10:16] 10:7 let it be applied equally to
[3:10:22] everybody and let our light so shine
[3:10:25] amongst men that our good works might
[3:10:29] glorify Our Father in Heaven I thank the
[3:10:33] Lord for the past
[3:10:35] amen I thank him for the things I've
[3:10:39] seen I think thank him for the presence
[3:10:42] and I could go on for hours about the
[3:10:45] Miracles I've seen
[3:10:47] but I want to look what he's got in the
[3:10:50] future what does he have in our future
[3:10:54] days and I want to be a part of it I
[3:10:57] want you to be a part of it and wherever

[3:12:17] Lord our gracious
[3:12:20] father We Want to Thank
[3:12:25] You Lord
[3:12:28] back sometime around 2000 I think 6 s
[3:12:32] somewhere in
[3:12:33] there we moved into this
[3:12:36] [Music]
[3:12:37] place and Lord we
[3:12:40] remembered what a miracle it
[3:12:42] was Lord I remember sitting in the bank
[3:12:46] with brother Mike parks
[3:12:50] and getting the loan to build this
[3:12:53] little
[3:12:57] building Lord and
[3:12:59] it got completed and then it was paid
[3:13:04] off and Lord we outgrew the walls
[3:13:09] and and it was on our heart father that
[3:13:13] the people could be more
[3:13:16] comfortable
[3:13:18] Lord you made a
[3:13:22] way Lord and we poured that slab
[3:13:27] on April
[3:13:30] 1st and Lord one year to the
[3:13:34] day we were

[3:13:48] goodness
[3:13:49] Lord we want you to lead us into more of
[3:13:52] your greatness more of your
[3:13:56] reflection Lord more of of bringing

[3:14:06] [Music]
[3:14:09] in Lord it may feel
[3:14:13] odd the first few services

[3:14:26] moved in this
[3:14:29] journey father you've made it
[3:14:38] home when you leave a home Lord
[3:14:42] just there's so many feelings
[3:14:46] involved
[3:14:47] but Lord there's freshness in the new
[3:14:49] home
[3:14:51] and we ask Lord that you go before
[3:14:56] us in a little while Lord we'll
