[41:57] word amen and
[42:01] uh and uh if if this don't make her
[42:05] happy I'm
[42:06] hopeless because this is the the most
[42:09] favorite chapter in all the Bible for me
[42:12] so I'm this is the meat of it all to me
[42:15] personally so we're just going to read
[42:17] one verse and then we'll have our seats
[42:20] John
[42:22] 171 these words spake Jesus and lifted
[42:27] up his eyes to heaven and said father
[42:31] the hour is
[42:34] come glorify thy son that thy son Also
[42:39] may glorify thee Lord bless your word
[42:43] pray Jesus name amen you may be
[42:51] seated Jesus spoke these words and it
[42:55] said
[42:57] says father the hour is come and so I'd
[43:03] like just to title this little uh
[43:06] thought here if I could uh the hour of
[43:12] fulfillment the hour of
[43:15] fulfillment and another way to express
[43:20] that hour of fulfillment would be to say
[43:24] Harvest Time Harvest time is the hour of
[43:28] fulfillment it's the time that the uh
[43:32] sheep has ripened the fruit has WIP
[43:35] ripened the seed has come to uh maturity
[43:39] and it's time uh to take it into the
[43:43] Garner because the time of its
[43:45] fulfillment has come and it's fulfilled
[43:48] its journey and so I'd like to go
[43:50] through these just on a little uh uh
[43:54] further continuance of this morning and
[43:58] we noticed this morning that there there
[44:02] was a great awareness the prophet of God
[44:04] said you've got to be real careful here
[44:06] now he in other words watch this this is
[44:09] very important he says that Satan is
[44:13] going to offer the
[44:15] Supernatural and you wouldn't think that
[44:17] he would offer the supernatural but
[44:20] remember he he wants to sit upon the
[44:24] Thrones and and and Rule rule over the
[44:27] Stars which are in heaven and other
[44:29] words he wanted to exalt himself above
[44:31] the sons of God and the daughters of God
[44:35] and so we we that's what we've got to be
[44:38] aware of and so we know that what we
[44:42] were saying is that in every age as the
[44:46] life passed through it stopped and and
[44:50] what we're talking about is that there's
[44:52] a continuance onto perfection when that
[44:56] which is perfect is come and and I guess
[45:01] the best way for me to express this is
[45:04] is
[45:05] that in this chapter Jesus going is
[45:09] going to pray and he's going to ask the
[45:13] father to give to his children that
[45:18] which is perfect another words he
[45:21] doesn't want anything less for his own
[45:25] than
[45:26] that which is perfect and so that's why
[45:29] I say it's the time of fulfillment the
[45:32] time when that which is perfect has come
[45:36] and I'd like to read a few statements uh
[45:39] and we're just going to go through these
[45:41] scriptures uh uh just slowly together if
[45:45] I could but I want to listen to this
[45:50] statement uh this is at the towards the
[45:52] very end of the invisible Union of of
[45:56] the bride of Christ so it's the
[45:59] invisible Union of the Heavenly
[46:01] bridegroom and the Earthly bride there
[46:04] is a union and that we know that this
[46:06] was a uniting time and sign so the
[46:10] beauty of this is what that the Lord
[46:14] came here to
[46:16] accomplish and so this statement is in
[46:19] paragraph
[46:21] 3:24 um it
[46:24] says the word that fell on the day of
[46:28] Pentecost will not work this day no
[46:34] sir now that's
[46:37] striking now it it doesn't say that the
[46:42] blessings wouldn't work but the word
[46:46] wouldn't work so in other words
[46:50] preaching that won't won't work today
[46:54] and when you say something doesn't work
[46:57] that means it won't accomplish the task
[47:01] that's at
[47:02] hand that's right okay so it won't it
[47:05] won't it won't
[47:08] complete or finish the work so that it
[47:12] won't work it it it had its day it had
[47:17] its time it had its season it's had its
[47:20] purpose and though it was good and
[47:23] though it was perfect in its time it
[47:26] won't complete the task so there's
[47:30] something that needs to be completed
[47:32] there's something that's got to come
[47:34] that's going to make us perfect so all
[47:37] of us not only in our uh not only in the
[47:41] gospel as we're talking of the history
[47:43] of the Gospel but also in our own
[47:46] personal life of what we want to fulfill
[47:50] and what we want to become and the
[47:52] victories that uh that we want to obtain
[47:57] the things we want to uh have uh have
[48:01] the victory over and you know okay I
[48:04] like I read that scripture this morning
[48:06] when I was reading Corinthians and you
[48:08] know basically the scripture said he's
[48:10] not easily riled up you know he doesn't
[48:13] he does not ready to strike back so
[48:16] quick and I thought in my heart you know
[48:17] I I I want to improve on that I want to
[48:20] be better there and so there's got to be
[48:24] a way that I can be better
[48:26] there's got to be a way I can grab a
[48:28] hold of it and for the hour I'm living
[48:31] in cuz I'm facing things that nobody
[48:33] else has ever faced so are
[48:36] you in this generation in this hour that
[48:40] we live in well there's never been a
[48:43] time like this there's never been a
[48:45] confusion like this there there's never
[48:48] been the age of wickedness like we live
[48:51] in now total
[48:53] apostasy total separation from God and
[48:58] any thinking that's Christian thinking
[49:01] whatsoever H has just been denied we're
[49:04] in the days of
[49:05] Sodom amen and the days of Noah and uh
[49:11] and judgment is fixing to strike and so
[49:15] he's saying though that was a tremendous
[49:18] blessing in fact it was the birth
[49:22] blessing it's what caused the birth of
[49:25] the church church so it wasn't what was
[49:28] going to finish the church it was what
[49:31] birthed the
[49:33] church so that life had to come all the
[49:35] way down to the
[49:37] end but this is our messenger telling us
[49:41] now he's
[49:42] saying and I'll read it again the word
[49:44] that fell on the day of Pentecost will
[49:46] not
[49:47] work this day no sir that was for
[49:51] Pentecost this is for the bride
[49:57] the going home of the
[50:01] Bride so that's the
[50:05] Fulfillment the going home of the Bride
[50:08] that's the Fulfillment of our journey is
[50:11] the going home of the Bride that's the
[50:13] Fulfillment of the Gospel is going home
[50:16] of the Bride when the bride's gone then
[50:20] that that there's there's no more
[50:21] fulfillment but
[50:23] judgment and every one else after that
[50:26] will have to go through the great Throne
[50:28] judgment and we'll be judged and weighed
[50:31] I don't want to go
[50:34] there I don't I don't want the record of
[50:38] my life put on display and and everybody
[50:43] to know and see what I
[50:46] thought and what I've
[50:48] done I want something
[50:51] now you understand that'll cause me to
[50:55] go over that great
[50:58] Chasm that I can pass
[51:01] into the kingdom that he promise was
[51:04] there for
[51:06] me and so you understand what he's
[51:08] telling us here as we read
[51:12] it he says this is for the bride going
[51:18] home of the Bride so this
[51:21] fulfillment this word of this day this
[51:25] message that was brought to us through a
[51:29] Vindicated fulfillment of Malachi 4:5
[51:33] Luke
[51:34] 17:30 Revelations 10:7 John 12 and many
[51:38] other
[51:39] scriptures was for the going home of the
[51:42] Bride that was the
[51:45] expressed purpose of this message was to
[51:49] prepare a bride for a
[51:53] Rapture not to not to shower us with
[51:57] blessings not to uh reinvent the wheel
[52:01] not to empower us again with a
[52:06] Revival if you had to choose today
[52:09] between having a great Revival of works
[52:12] and miracles and and and uh people
[52:15] coming out of the hospitals and a great
[52:18] glorious time or leaving this Earth and
[52:21] going into Glory what would you
[52:24] choose
[52:27] well if you say I choose leaving this
[52:29] Earth and going to Glory then you have
[52:31] to take the way that's provided to get
[52:36] there not a
[52:39] decoy that's saying this will take you
[52:42] there this revival will take you
[52:45] there this great outpouring will take
[52:48] you there
[52:50] no obedience to this word will take you
[52:54] there and he said this is the
[52:57] Pentecostal word will not work in this
[53:01] day now I didn't say
[53:05] that I would have never thought
[53:08] that I would have never been able even
[53:11] to see
[53:12] it if there wasn't
[53:15] iav given in this day that we might
[53:22] see you think of it our Prophet brought
[53:26] us is
[53:28] have that we could apply it to our
[53:30] spiritual eyes and we can see the
[53:33] condition see the pathway see The
[53:36] Shining
[53:37] Light understand what it is where we're
[53:40] going where the place on the map is that
[53:44] we're trying to get to other than that
[53:48] we would have just been rambling from
[53:50] Pillar To Post from revival to Revival
[53:53] from meeting to meeting from minister to
[53:55] minister from one thought one
[53:58] interpretation to another interpretation
[54:00] praise God that God sent us an
[54:06] absolute something that's been
[54:07] Vindicated and is just unquestionable
[54:11] and
[54:13] unmatched amen not one jot or t that
[54:18] hadn't been
[54:19] fulfilled and that stood the word test
[54:23] and went through the Hall of
[54:26] critics and and he goes on to say listen
[54:29] he says we've got something
[54:35] different amen now we don't need to mix
[54:40] yesterday with today
[54:44] right you know we we
[54:48] we we're not going to build an
[54:52] arc you know what I mean it won't work
[54:55] so we want what works for our day and
[54:59] what that he's telling us here and he's
[55:01] preaching in this particular message is
[55:04] the only thing that will work today is
[55:06] an invisible Union between the Heavenly
[55:10] bridegroom and the Earthly
[55:12] bride the only thing that will that will
[55:16] cause
[55:17] us to leave this world and he doesn't
[55:22] want us to approach that with a hope so
[55:25] oh I hope I make it I hope I can do
[55:28] enough works that he takes me someday uh
[55:33] he's going to take me no he wants it he
[55:35] wants it closer than that he wants it
[55:38] tighter than that he wants it more real
[55:40] than that he wants it to be that we know
[55:43] what he's
[55:44] doing that we become one with him in
[55:47] fact he even says that we're married to
[55:49] them this is a bride age it's a union
[55:52] it's a it's a an absolutely
[55:55] uh uh joining together Flesh of My Flesh
[55:58] bone of my
[56:00] bone and and he goes on to say he said
[56:03] the
[56:04] Pentecostal
[56:07] rep represented that again we're in the
[56:12] bride age amen no more than Moses's law
[56:19] would have worked in the time of Paul
[56:21] here
[56:22] we try to tell them you're dead to that
[56:28] and you cannot have
[56:31] that so what we're talking about is a
[56:35] time of
[56:36] fulfillment not a a time of return many
[56:42] people
[56:44] misinterpreted what the restoration was
[56:47] it wasn't restoration back to the gifts
[56:51] that fell on the day of Pentecost it was
[56:54] a a restoration of the faith that's that
[56:59] our fathers had now we're going to read
[57:02] this chapter slowly together verse by
[57:04] verse I just trust my eye hold out and I
[57:10] want you to as as we read
[57:13] this think of what it
[57:17] is the faith that they had because in
[57:21] this chapter Jesus is going to describe
[57:26] what it was that they
[57:30] possessed okay and this is a a a great
[57:34] chapter and I I I've got a few other
[57:37] quotes that I uh little areas that I
[57:40] want to read and I may jump over here as
[57:43] we go through this now let's let's let's
[57:44] read this beautiful Jesus is fixing the
[57:48] hour has come it's the time that he's
[57:51] now going to be
[57:53] taken and as as the Beautiful song was
[57:57] sung the crown of thorns is going to be
[57:59] placed upon him his throne is now going
[58:03] to be a cross and he's going to lay his
[58:07] life down for his
[58:12] own now he doesn't want
[58:16] that maybe I don't have the vocabulary
[58:18] to exppress it but please bear with me
[58:22] he doesn't want this to be in vain
[58:28] okay he he he wants to lay his life down
[58:31] and he wants it to accomplish
[58:36] something okay because what he's doing
[58:38] is he's making a
[58:41] purchase is that right he's going to
[58:44] he's going to purchase his own
[58:47] back he's going to purchase all that the
[58:51] father hath given him he's going to make
[58:53] payment
[58:55] for the sin of
[58:57] Adam for the first Adam was a living
[59:00] soul but the second Adam was a
[59:02] quickening spirit he's fixing to go to
[59:05] make payment for all the
[59:09] sins of his brothers and sisters and of
[59:13] his
[59:14] Kindred he is now going to go do the
[59:17] work of a kinsman redeemer he's going to
[59:20] go to the cross and he's going to pay
[59:22] the price for their sins he's going to
[59:24] take the chastisement of their peace
[59:27] upon themselves and by his stripes he's
[59:29] going to heal
[59:32] them
[59:35] hallelujah it's
[59:38] beautiful he
[59:41] says as thou hath
[59:44] given hath given
[59:47] him and this is life
[59:51] eternal that they might know Thee the
[59:56] only true
[59:57] God and Jesus Christ whom thou hath
[1:00:05] sent
[1:00:07] amen not another way I am the way the
[1:00:11] truth the life no man comes into the
[1:00:15] father but by me that they might know
[1:00:18] that that they might have the revelation
[1:00:22] of that listen to and pray
[1:00:25] he
[1:00:29] said I have glorified thee on the earth
[1:00:34] I have finished the work which thou Hast
[1:00:39] given me to do the time of
[1:00:42] fulfillment I have finished the work
[1:00:45] that thou has given me to do and now oh
[1:00:49] Father glorify thou me with thine own
[1:00:55] self with the glory which I had with
[1:01:00] thee before the world
[1:01:06] was oh thank you that is
[1:01:12] beautiful let's oh I just got to read
[1:01:15] this I think maybe I should just come
[1:01:18] over and and and read
[1:01:22] this he says Now read remember this is
[1:01:26] paragraph
[1:01:27] 221 in invisible Union of the Bride but
[1:01:32] remember when it went down and the grain
[1:01:35] be to
[1:01:36] ripen you find before the grain can
[1:01:40] ripen
[1:01:41] everything in that stock has to be
[1:01:47] dead now I don't have to go through
[1:01:49] justification everything's got to die
[1:01:51] right every idea everything Hallelujah
[1:01:55] can you see where we're standing life is
[1:02:00] in the grain
[1:02:02] again what is it just exactly like the
[1:02:07] same grain that went in the ground the
[1:02:13] same Jesus in
[1:02:16] Bride
[1:02:21] form same power same church same thing
[1:02:27] same word the same
[1:02:30] word sucked up through these and come
[1:02:34] out here and come to a head here and all
[1:02:40] of that life that come through here
[1:02:44] picked up its people now it's forming up
[1:02:49] into a head for the
[1:02:52] Rapture amen yes and then he he goes
[1:02:56] down here in paragraph
[1:02:58] 222 well you were separated from your
[1:03:01] first Union by spiritual death now you
[1:03:05] are born again or remarried again to a
[1:03:09] new spiritual union for not of your
[1:03:14] natural life of the things of the world
[1:03:17] but of your eternal life that germ that
[1:03:21] was in you at the beginning
[1:03:25] found you now we're just going to read
[1:03:27] this because he's pling he says now he
[1:03:33] says now father
[1:03:36] glorify me in thy own self and glorify
[1:03:40] which I had with thee before the world
[1:03:43] was I have manifested thy name un unto
[1:03:49] men which thou Hast given me out of the

[1:03:59] them me and thou haast
[1:04:03] kept kept Thy
[1:04:07] word now they have known that all things
[1:04:13] whatsoever thou haast given me are of
[1:04:19] thee now this is the
[1:04:22] faith you understand that he's talking
[1:04:25] about they have known that all things
[1:04:27] that thou haast given me are of thee now
[1:04:31] he's got if we're going to have our
[1:04:33] faith restored he's got to give us
[1:04:35] something to believe in so he does the
[1:04:38] same work in our day and now the
[1:04:40] believer in our our day restored with
[1:04:43] the same faith says everything that
[1:04:45] we're hearing is of the
[1:04:49] Father for I have given unto them
[1:04:54] The Words which thou Hast given
[1:04:58] me and and they have received
[1:05:03] them and have known surely that I came
[1:05:07] out from thee and they have believed
[1:05:12] that thou did sent
[1:05:15] me now you're talking about what's being
[1:05:19] restored because we're talking about the

[1:05:51] all thine are mine
[1:05:54] and I am glorified
[1:05:58] in
[1:06:00] them now remember this prayer he says is

[1:07:05] them in thy name these that thou giveth
[1:07:10] me I have kept and none of them is lost
[1:07:16] but the son of predition that the
[1:07:19] scriptures might be
[1:07:21] fulfilled and now
[1:07:25] now come I to thee and
[1:07:29] these things I speak in the world that
[1:07:34] they might have my joy fulfilled in
[1:07:39] themselves I have given them Thy word
[1:07:43] and the world hath hated them because
[1:07:47] they are not of the world even as I am
[1:07:51] not of the world amen oh
[1:07:56] my isn't that beautiful I pray not that
[1:08:00] thou shouldest take them out of the
[1:08:03] world but thou thou should us keep them
[1:08:06] from the
[1:08:08] evil they are not in the not of the
[1:08:12] world even as I am not of the world
[1:08:17] sanctify them through thy truth Thy word
[1:08:22] is truth as thou Hast sent me into the
[1:08:27] world even so I send them also into the
[1:08:32] world and for their sake I sanctify
[1:08:36] myself that they also might be
[1:08:39] Sanctified through the truth
[1:08:43] amen neither pray for I these alone but
[1:08:47] for them also which Shall

[1:09:01] art in me and I in thee that they also
[1:09:06] may be one in us that the world might
[1:09:11] believe that thou Hast sent me now he's
[1:09:15] talking about that which is perfect when
[1:09:19] they become one as he was one with the
[1:09:24] father and the glory which thou
[1:09:30] givest me I have given
[1:09:33] them that they may be one even as we are
[1:09:40] one now this is what was going into the
[1:09:44] ground and this prayer now that prayer
[1:09:48] has to come to a time of fulfillment so
[1:09:52] it went in the ground and it started
[1:09:54] coming up through justification
[1:09:56] sanctification through Pentecost now
[1:10:00] into an invisible Union between the
[1:10:02] bride and
[1:10:06] Christ i in them and thou in me that
[1:10:11] they may be made perfect in one and that
[1:10:18] the world may know that thou haast sent
[1:10:21] me and have loved the them as thou Hast
[1:10:26] loved
[1:10:27] me oh this is
[1:10:30] beautiful this is what it's all about
[1:10:33] this is what he prayed for this is when
[1:10:35] he went to the cross for that we can be
[1:10:38] one with the father as he was one with
[1:10:41] the
[1:10:41] father that we can be one with him as he
[1:10:45] was one that the love that was in the
[1:10:48] father would be in us just the way he
[1:10:50] loved the father that he loved us
[1:11:00] father I will that thou also whom thou
[1:11:05] Hast given me be with me where I
[1:11:14] am that they may behold my
[1:11:19] glory which thou haast given me for for
[1:11:24] thou lovest me before the foundations of
[1:11:29] the world oh righteous
[1:11:32] father the
[1:11:35] world hath not known thee but I have
[1:11:39] known thee and these have
[1:11:43] known that thou ha sent me and I
[1:11:48] declared unto them thy name and will
[1:11:53] declare it
[1:11:55] that the love wherein thou haast loved
[1:12:00] me may
[1:12:02] be in them and
[1:12:06] I in
[1:12:09] them if I could try just to say that's
[1:12:12] the
[1:12:13] Perfection we don't want to miss and i'
[1:12:16] just like to close
[1:12:18] and say these few words and I'll ask
[1:12:21] brother Billy to read our communion
[1:12:24] scriptures to us tonight before
[1:12:28] communion so we just read this statement
[1:12:31] it said that the germ that was in you at
[1:12:34] the beginning found
[1:12:36] you he says your
[1:12:39] name now is in the book of
[1:12:49] life is in the is in the Book of Life
[1:12:55] but not the book of life but the Lamb's
[1:12:59] Book of Life which the lamb redeemed and
[1:13:04] the old book of your natural
[1:13:08] Union but your new bride Hallelujah not
[1:13:13] the old book of your natural but your
[1:13:15] new bride Hallelujah your new life is in
[1:13:20] the Lamb's Book of Life so what does he
[1:13:24] open in this age he takes the Lamb's
[1:13:27] Book of Life he puts his foot on the
[1:13:29] land and the Sea and he opens the book
[1:13:32] and your name is in
[1:13:35] there your married certificate
[1:13:39] Hallelujah where your true Eternal germ
[1:13:44] from the beginning takes hold yes sir so
[1:13:48] now we're talking about what it is that
[1:13:51] this perfect thing not the old Union
[1:13:54] yeah but something that's new and
[1:13:56] different is going to take hold in you
[1:14:01] what was in you in eternity now takes F
[1:14:06] hold that that seed finds you you
[1:14:12] yes he
[1:14:15] said your marriage your true Eternal
[1:14:19] germ from the beginning takes hold now
[1:14:22] you're not forgiven but you're
[1:14:25] Justified Glory Justified Romans
[1:14:29] 51 therefore being
[1:14:32] justified by faith and we're not going
[1:14:35] to to read all that but we're just going
[1:14:37] to jump over and and read this he says
[1:14:42] therefore being
[1:14:43] justified I was accused you were
[1:14:48] accused you never done it in the first
[1:14:51] place the old Union is in the sea of
[1:14:55] God's
[1:14:56] forgetfulness you wasn't
[1:15:00] married you you wasn't married to it it
[1:15:04] to begin with the bridegroom bore your
[1:15:09] shame for you in your place he took your
[1:15:14] place for you were predestinated for him
[1:15:18] to be his bride before the foundation of
[1:15:22] the world
[1:15:23] the Bible said so you are the
[1:15:26] predestinated
[1:15:29] seed now we're talking about what was
[1:15:32] perfect has come now what was perfect
[1:15:35] was in the word of God for it was the
[1:15:38] perfect word of God it was the original
[1:15:42] spoken
[1:15:44] seed how did you come to this you were
[1:15:48] deceived into it by your first marriage
[1:15:51] to your adulterous parents Eve it's no
[1:15:55] fault of your own but your natural birth
[1:15:59] came after Eve who committed adultery
[1:16:04] that's the reason you were born an
[1:16:08] adulterous you were a sinner to begin
[1:16:11] with that's right you were deceived into
[1:16:16] it no you ain't no it isn't or ain't
[1:16:21] your fault you never did it because the
[1:16:25] little
[1:16:26] germ that was in you was to be you from
[1:16:31] the foundation of the
[1:16:34] beginning of the world God put your name
[1:16:39] on the Lamb's Book of
[1:16:42] Life where was your new life it was in
[1:16:46] the Lamb's Book what did God do he put
[1:16:51] He
[1:16:52] put he he put your little
[1:16:56] germ that was in you to be before the
[1:17:00] foundation of world he put your name in
[1:17:04] the Lamb's Book of Life and what makes
[1:17:08] it perfect because that book was
[1:17:11] opened and we found our name on it and
[1:17:15] now we know because we are going to be
[1:17:18] known as we were known and how did he
[1:17:22] know us he knew us as being The Germ
[1:17:26] that was in him in the beginning oh I I
[1:17:31] know sometimes it sounds complicated but
[1:17:34] the truth of the matter is it's so
[1:17:37] simple and so
[1:17:40] beautiful that all that the father hath
[1:17:43] given me will come to me and so when we
[1:17:49] we want just to say that this is the
[1:17:52] time time of fulfillment when that which
[1:17:56] is perfect is come that which is in part
[1:18:01] is done away and we can rejoice and
[1:18:05] people say well I want those
[1:18:07] blessings well not only do you have
[1:18:10] those blessings you have more than those
[1:18:14] blessings you have him who gave those
[1:18:18] blessings you have the giver Hall not
[1:18:21] the gift
[1:18:24] oh my let me say that
[1:18:27] again you don't just have the gifts you
[1:18:31] have The
[1:18:32] Giver of the gifts that you in him might
[1:18:38] be one the perfect union of the Earthly
[1:18:43] bride and the Heavenly bridegroom God

[1:18:50] communion scriptures and they will then
[1:18:52] we'll bless the bread

[1:18:58] it 1 Corinthians
[1:19:01] 11 the
[1:19:04] 23rd says for I have received of the
[1:19:07] Lord that which I also deliver unto you
[1:19:11] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:19:14] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:19:17] when when he had given thanks he Brak it
[1:19:21] and said take eat this is my body which
[1:19:24] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[1:19:28] of me after the same manner he took the
[1:19:31] cup when he had stopped saying this cup
[1:19:34] is the New Testament in my blood do this
[1:19:38] do ye as often as he drink it in
[1:19:41] remembrance of me for as often as ye eat
[1:19:44] this bread and drink this cup ye do show
[1:19:47] the Lord's death till he come wherefore
[1:19:50] whatsoever whosoever shall eat this
[1:19:53] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:19:56] unworthily shall be guilty of the blood
[1:20:00] of the body and of the blood of the Lord
[1:20:02] but let every man examine himself so let
[1:20:05] him let him eat of that bread and drink
[1:20:09] of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:20:11] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[1:20:14] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[1:20:16] Lord's body for this cause many are weak
[1:20:20] and sickly among you and many sleep for
[1:20:23] if we would Jud we would be we would
[1:20:26] judge if we would if we would judge
[1:20:29] ourselves we should not be judged but
[1:20:32] when we are judged we are chasen of the
[1:20:35] Lord that we should not be condemned
[1:20:37] with the world wherefore my brethren

[1:21:35] father was all purchased that we could
[1:21:39] have the love wherein you had loved the
