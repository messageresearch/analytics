[31:32] certainly good to be gathered back in
[31:34] the house of god
[31:36] man let's open our bibles in john
[31:38] chapter 13.
[31:39] uh
[31:43] we're gonna we're gonna read
[31:47] from chapter one but we're gonna skip
[31:49] some and
[31:50] uh let's just see how
[31:54] we go let's start from uh john chapter
[31:57] 13. let's start from verse
[32:01] from verse
[32:21] let's start from verse one it says now
[32:23] before the feast of the passover
[32:26] when jesus knew that his hour was come
[32:28] that he
[32:29] should depart out of this world unto the
[32:32] father
[32:34] having loved his own which were in the
[32:36] world he loved
[32:38] them unto the end and supper being ended
[32:41] the devil having put in the
[32:43] heart of judah iscariot simon's son to
[32:46] betray him
[32:48] jesus knowing and this is the
[32:51] verse that i want to focus on he says
[32:54] jesus knowing
[32:55] that the father had given him all things
[32:57] is given all things in his hand
[33:00] and that he was come from god and he
[33:02] went to god
[33:03] he raised us from sap and laid aside the
[33:05] garments that he
[33:07] and the garment then took a towel and
[33:09] girded himself
[33:11] and after pour water in the basin he
[33:13] began to wash the disciples feet
[33:16] and to wipe them with a towel wherewith
[33:18] he was curded
[33:20] then came into simon peter and peter
[33:23] said unto him lord thou washed
[33:25] my feet jesus answered and said unto him
[33:29] what i do thou knoweth not but that
[33:31] shall know
[33:33] year after peter said unto him
[33:36] thou shalt never wash my feet jesus
[33:38] answered unto him
[33:40] said if i wash thee not thou has no part
[33:43] with me
[33:45] simon said simon peter said unto him
[33:48] lord not
[33:48] not my feet only but my but also my hand
[33:52] my hands my hands and my head jesus said
[33:55] unto him he that is washed needed not
[33:58] saved to wash his feet but he is clean
[34:02] every with and ye are clean but not all
[34:05] for he knew he should betray him
[34:07] therefore he said
[34:08] he are not all clean
[34:11] so after he had washed the feet and had
[34:14] taken the garment which he was
[34:17] the garment and was it and taking his
[34:20] garment and
[34:21] was set down again he said unto them
[34:24] know ye what i've done
[34:26] to you you call me master and lord
[34:29] and you say well for so i am
[34:32] if i then your lord and master
[34:35] wash your feet you ought to watch one
[34:38] another's feet
[34:39] for i have given you an example that you
[34:42] should follow
[34:43] as i have done to you the lord had the
[34:46] blessing to the reading of his word
[34:48] you may have your seeds
[35:00] amen i certainly enjoyed it this morning
[35:02] our pastor just
[35:04] uh speaking about
[35:08] adoption and the time that we live in
[35:11] i i believe it's certainly the heart of
[35:14] every believer
[35:16] to become into the manifestation of what
[35:18] god has called us for this end time
[35:21] you know i don't know about you but
[35:23] there comes a time where we get tired of
[35:25] this world
[35:26] you know i was thinking about even
[35:28] myself i said i'm just tired of being
[35:30] human
[35:31] i'm just tired of working up and just
[35:33] doing human things and going to bed and
[35:35] continuing
[35:36] it's just tiring you go one day after
[35:39] another
[35:40] there has to be another purpose besides
[35:42] just being human to us
[35:44] and and my title tonight if i could just
[35:46] for a few minutes just
[35:48] to to speak to you tonight i want to
[35:50] speak on
[35:52] i come from god and i go back to god
[35:55] i come from god and i go back to god as
[35:57] jesus
[35:58] knowing the scripture says that he knew
[36:00] that he came that he had come from god
[36:02] and he went back to god
[36:04] in other words he was very clear in his
[36:07] understanding of who he was
[36:09] what his purpose was and what he's about
[36:11] to do
[36:12] and and and as he begin to do his work
[36:15] and has began to do about go about the
[36:17] things that he did
[36:18] when he woke up in the morning he had no
[36:20] doubt no
[36:21] questions about what is it that his
[36:23] mission was that day
[36:25] and i believe that sometimes we get
[36:27] caught up within our own minds we don't
[36:29] have clarity of mind and
[36:31] and and we go about days and sometimes
[36:33] there's so much confusion within our
[36:35] heads
[36:36] and i hope tonight i could just bring it
[36:38] in such a way we could see
[36:40] that as jesus even as a reader says i
[36:43] have given you an example
[36:45] that you should do as i have done unto
[36:48] you
[36:49] now i was thinking about this scripture
[36:52] specifically we read it every time we do
[36:54] foot washing and very familiar scripture
[36:56] reading
[36:57] and jesus in talking to them referring
[37:00] to the exact
[37:01] foot washing we could say he was there
[37:03] talking to them about these disciples
[37:05] and no questions they were wondering you
[37:08] know who's the servants and who's what
[37:10] and everything and
[37:11] and he showing humility saying that i'm
[37:15] the master washing your feet and
[37:16] everything
[37:17] and and you have to do the same as i
[37:19] have done
[37:20] and showing them in that concept and we
[37:22] can also look at it
[37:24] as jesus being an example not just for
[37:27] this particular
[37:28] foot washing or this was what was taking
[37:31] place
[37:32] but yet we can also look at it from the
[37:35] the whole bible and all his life and see
[37:37] the things that he accomplished
[37:39] and realized that he was made to be an
[37:41] example for us
[37:43] i was looking uh this afternoon i began
[37:46] to look at the bible and there was just
[37:47] things that
[37:49] that came to my mind that i just want to
[37:52] perhaps just add or complete or add to
[37:56] what was said this morning
[37:57] because that's where my inspiration came
[37:59] from
[38:01] the the when you when you think about an
[38:04] example
[38:04] someone being an example i was thinking
[38:06] about even how
[38:08] myself you know be when i was in school
[38:11] you will go and and perhaps they'll give
[38:14] you a
[38:14] a a an equation to solve and and within
[38:18] the equation they'll tell you maybe
[38:20] x plus y you know divide by z
[38:23] equals to d or whatever the case is they
[38:25] will give you
[38:26] something and this is the equation and
[38:28] and and and as they give it to you
[38:30] they'll give you an example they will
[38:32] take another one
[38:33] and they will try to put the numbers in
[38:35] there and solve it for you so you can
[38:38] see
[38:39] what the answer is going to be and i
[38:41] began to think
[38:42] often time even as our pastor was
[38:44] speaking about jesus being
[38:46] example this morning we realized as we
[38:48] look at the bible
[38:50] um we could look and and and and and
[38:53] look and
[38:53] and realize in the sense if we look at
[38:56] it in the sense of what i'm speaking
[38:58] about an equation
[38:59] when they give you an example when it
[39:01] comes during the exam
[39:03] they're not going to take the same
[39:04] example and give you as a question
[39:07] because that was just an example for you
[39:09] to follow
[39:11] but the truth behind the concept is that
[39:13] you can apply what you have learned from
[39:16] the example
[39:17] and get back to the same answer you can
[39:20] apply
[39:20] and follow the logic that's been applied
[39:22] you put this one here the number this
[39:24] other number was here this is how you're
[39:26] going to deduct it this is how you're
[39:28] going to get and get to the same answer
[39:30] so we can realize and i began to look at
[39:32] the bible even as our pastor was just
[39:34] going this morning
[39:35] that there are scriptures and there are
[39:38] things that apply to jesus
[39:40] him being the firstborn among many
[39:42] brothers that we partake into it
[39:44] we realize that he's the firstborn about
[39:47] mingy brother and
[39:48] he came and even as we just read about
[39:51] him saying that i have given you an
[39:52] example that you should follow
[39:54] we can see but we also find out that
[39:57] within the same bibles
[39:59] that there were things that were
[40:00] specifically attached to the life of
[40:02] jesus that we were not to be fulfilling
[40:05] in any means whatsoever in other words
[40:07] jesus came
[40:09] and he was given for for for death so we
[40:12] can live
[40:13] so his death is for us to live and we
[40:16] can find out that the bible also says
[40:18] that he was forsaken of the father
[40:20] so we don't have to be forsaken so jesus
[40:23] god didn't want us to come to him and
[40:25] use and go in the bible and say
[40:27] well you know the scripture says my god
[40:29] my god why is i forsaking me
[40:31] right now i feel forsaken no jesus
[40:33] fulfilled that scripture so you don't
[40:35] have to apply it to yourself
[40:38] jesus took that he was taken he was
[40:40] given to death
[40:41] he died on the roman cross with the
[40:43] nails and everything
[40:44] so we don't have to go to the cross so
[40:46] we'll be saved so our life can be spared
[40:49] in his death
[40:51] so we find out as we realize it jesus is
[40:55] basically
[40:55] what was given to us and and i hope this
[40:58] won't offend anybody
[40:59] jesus became what we would call is the
[41:02] formula
[41:03] by which we get the answer that we are
[41:05] looking for
[41:06] everything that we have need of jesus is
[41:09] the formula the word is what has been
[41:11] given to us
[41:12] because we realize that jesus is the
[41:14] word and is the formula
[41:16] that god has given us that if we can
[41:18] take him
[41:19] take what he did and take it and apply
[41:21] it that god will answer our prayers
[41:24] and so as i'm speaking on uh
[41:27] uh we come from god and going back to
[41:30] god
[41:30] this morning our pastor was i was just
[41:33] touched how he was bringing
[41:34] even about adoption we understand we can
[41:37] see here
[41:38] uh that it's very important we realize
[41:40] that election
[41:42] is very is is different from adoption
[41:45] god elected us election is the choice of
[41:48] god we don't have any part to do with it
[41:51] in fact uh you know he came and chose us
[41:53] we didn't even know we were chosen
[41:55] until he came and showed us that he
[41:57] chose us
[41:59] election is the domain of god it has
[42:02] nothing to do with
[42:03] us it happened when we were we didn't
[42:05] have to take and
[42:06] counsel with god and tell him oh please
[42:08] pick this one or pick that one no this
[42:10] is something that god does within
[42:12] himself
[42:13] and he chooses who he wants to be and
[42:15] where he wants to do what he wants to do
[42:17] with you
[42:18] but also we realize that but when it
[42:21] comes to
[42:22] adoption it's based upon the conduct
[42:26] upon the character upon our attitude
[42:30] and what we exhibit so it's very
[42:33] different so we are elected
[42:35] absolutely but we they they coming into
[42:39] adoption
[42:40] is the the the uh uh it's what
[42:43] it comes through between the tutor when
[42:45] you let one one listens to the tutor and
[42:48] follow what the tutor is teaching
[42:49] until you get to the place where you are
[42:52] completely brought into the place where
[42:54] the father's character
[42:56] is manifested into the sun that's when
[42:58] it takes hold
[43:00] so we realize that as children of god is
[43:02] a constant desire
[43:04] within our hearts to continually
[43:07] manifest the character of god
[43:09] to continually come to a place where his
[43:11] mind
[43:12] become our mind where what his desire
[43:14] become our desire
[43:15] where we continually die to ourselves
[43:18] until we can get into this place
[43:20] where he can come and use us for his
[43:22] kingdom
[43:24] jesus said i come from god and i go back
[43:27] to god
[43:29] within that statement i begin to think
[43:31] about it
[43:32] it summarizes everything about what he
[43:35] was
[43:37] and what he came to do when he woke up
[43:39] in the morning
[43:40] how he approached things in life how he
[43:43] dealt with him how he responded to
[43:45] things that came upon him
[43:46] it was based upon that one statement
[43:49] that he had a clear
[43:50] understanding of where he came from and
[43:53] where he was going
[43:56] and i'll say this where you know we can
[43:59] as
[43:59] our brother andy randy was preaching
[44:01] last wednesday says
[44:02] oftentimes we reason ourselves out of a
[44:05] lot of things
[44:06] i began to think well you know that was
[44:08] jesus and he came from god and
[44:10] and everything but we realized tonight
[44:12] that we also came from god
[44:15] we came from god now we can say well
[44:18] you know we bypass our theophany the
[44:21] logos and we came to be tempted
[44:23] but we live in a time where all the
[44:26] mysteries
[44:27] all of those things that were hidden are
[44:29] open there's no more mysteries
[44:32] everything that god planned to do from
[44:34] the beginning
[44:35] all the things that we bypassed that we
[44:37] didn't know anything about
[44:38] the that we live in the time of the
[44:41] revealing of that word
[44:42] and quickening power is here present
[44:45] to make you whatever you believe you can
[44:49] be
[44:50] why because the word has been open
[44:51] there's no excuse
[44:53] we couldn't say well that was jesus
[44:55] because he had no knowledge
[44:56] that same knowledge has been transferred
[44:58] to us in this end time
[45:01] so we by the word of god by faith in the
[45:05] word of god
[45:06] we can take the word of god and the holy
[45:08] spirit can come and quicken that word
[45:10] and make it a reality to us if we can
[45:13] sit here and realize that
[45:15] god has played something within this
[45:17] bible that we cannot attend to
[45:19] then we're wasting our time if he has
[45:23] placed something a scripture a promises
[45:25] lady here
[45:26] it said that i'm going to bring into
[45:27] adoption but yet he knows that we cannot
[45:30] get to it
[45:30] then what's the purpose of trying but he
[45:33] has given us all things he has made his
[45:35] word
[45:36] in fact he himself has come down
[45:39] so he can take his word and make it real
[45:42] unto us
[45:44] but madam speaks in the message what was
[45:47] the holy
[45:48] ghost given for he says i'll just read a
[45:50] part of it it says
[45:51] the church is waiting on me and you the
[45:54] adoption time
[45:56] when god can pour into us his
[45:59] fullness his power his resurrection
[46:03] he says that when the that when the
[46:06] church and christ become
[46:07] so close together till christ become
[46:11] visibly visible among us
[46:14] and raise us and raise the dead and we
[46:17] go into the rapture
[46:19] it's saying that this is the time god is
[46:21] waiting upon
[46:22] us to come into the place we
[46:26] we we take the word we let him perfect
[46:28] our character
[46:29] we let the holy spirit work upon us we
[46:31] let him
[46:32] do his work so we can he can take us and
[46:35] bring us into a place
[46:37] where he's saying that where christ
[46:39] becomes
[46:40] visible among us and they can raise the
[46:43] dead so we can go into the rapture
[46:45] that's the time that we are living in
[46:47] that's the time that's what's before us
[46:50] is the rapture is the transformation of
[46:52] our body
[46:53] but before the transformation can come
[46:55] the character has to be established
[46:57] [Music]
[46:59] we we heard it this morning
[47:02] that we will come to church and yet
[47:04] there are very clear things that god has
[47:07] established that we should do as
[47:09] believers
[47:11] but yet we find reasons why we cannot do
[47:13] them
[47:14] yet we find a way to reason out of those
[47:17] things to
[47:18] do we we fail to come to the place where
[47:21] we can just display the obedience of the
[47:24] word of god within our lives
[47:27] so so we find out
[47:32] the scripture says in first timothy
[47:36] chapter 3 and verse 16 it says
[47:39] and without controversy greg
[47:42] is the mystery of godliness
[47:46] it says that god was manifested in the
[47:49] flesh
[47:50] justifying the spirit sin of angel
[47:54] and preached unto the gentile
[47:57] believe unto the world and receive up in
[47:59] glory
[48:01] now i i began to think about this
[48:04] great is the mystery of godliness
[48:09] now we you you can think about this
[48:12] mystery of godliness that
[48:14] god the mystery of godliness our
[48:17] brother branham keeps referring to it
[48:19] over and over
[48:20] and in every sense he speaks about we
[48:23] we have to understand that jesus came he
[48:26] was
[48:27] uh yet mary conceived and he was born
[48:30] as a moral he came and we can
[48:34] follow his life and and see as at a
[48:37] young age at the age of 12 the scripture
[48:39] says he was found
[48:40] in the temple debating with the rabbi
[48:43] and and showing them the scripture
[48:45] concerning himself
[48:46] so asking them questions about his own
[48:49] life and the
[48:50] thing that the scripture spoke so in
[48:52] other words even the very prophet is
[48:55] walking us
[48:55] slowly for us to realize that something
[48:59] is happening here
[49:00] it's coming and he's inquiring about
[49:02] himself well it says that it would be a
[49:04] virgin born and isaiah spoke this
[49:07] and this happened and i'm told i was
[49:09] born this way
[49:10] now he wasn't debating about anything he
[49:12] was telling them about the things that
[49:14] happened
[49:15] and they didn't have an answer for him
[49:17] so and he would
[49:18] uh walk him through and he said how that
[49:20] he was taken into egypt and
[49:22] and and to be saved perhaps he'll go
[49:24] back to the scripture and show them that
[49:26] the scripture says that out of israel
[49:28] will i call my son
[49:30] he began and and he he was able to see
[49:34] the pattern in the scripture
[49:36] concerning himself and what the
[49:37] scripture talked about him
[49:39] and the prophet said that he went and be
[49:41] and to the river jordan and he was
[49:43] baptized
[49:45] and the bible tells us that he received
[49:48] the holy spirit
[49:49] because it says that the spirit
[49:50] descended in the form of a dove
[49:53] so we can clearly see out of
[49:56] regardless of the challenges that he
[49:58] faced as a human
[50:00] regardless of everything that he was he
[50:02] was following the pattern that was laid
[50:04] before him
[50:06] in the scripture he knew that the lamb
[50:08] had to be washed he went and washed
[50:09] himself
[50:10] he knew that he had to be baptized he
[50:12] went and did that he the spirit led him
[50:14] into the wilderness to be tempted
[50:16] and he was tempted by all manner the
[50:18] prophet tells us that
[50:20] he had the right to get married he had a
[50:22] right to have a house and
[50:24] he had a right to have a family he had a
[50:26] right to everything that was alive
[50:29] he was tempted with by every manner
[50:32] now if by every manner within your head
[50:35] right now
[50:36] you're thinking about something and say
[50:38] there's absolutely no way that jesus
[50:40] uh could be tempted of this then you
[50:42] make a scripture a lie
[50:44] it says by every manner so every
[50:46] temptation that's ever come
[50:48] upon you he was tempted of it
[50:51] that's why i'll become the high priest
[50:53] who can be touched by the feeling of
[50:55] infirmity
[50:56] anyway uh you think about the he
[50:59] he he walked in the road full of dust
[51:02] he got thirsty he needed to drink he got
[51:05] tired and he needed to rest it
[51:07] he needed a place maybe perhaps to put
[51:09] his head
[51:10] and and everything now this is the
[51:12] mystery of godliness
[51:15] i'm not talking about jesus i'm talking
[51:17] about you sitting here
[51:21] the mystery of godliness is that god
[51:24] has to be manifested in a human flesh
[51:27] with the trial and temptation and the
[51:30] things just like it is right now
[51:32] with all the uh a trial and all of those
[51:35] and
[51:35] things that seems like this is
[51:36] impossible and all he he went through
[51:39] all of that
[51:40] the scripture didn't say when he went
[51:42] perhaps from capernaum to jerusalem he
[51:45] flew no he didn't fly
[51:47] he walked perhaps during on the road
[51:51] he got tired and he needed to rest a
[51:53] little bit this is the mystery
[51:55] of godliness
[51:59] perhaps he he walked in and he walked up
[52:02] on the road
[52:02] on a rock perhaps he hurt himself and he
[52:05] needed to be carried and put aside
[52:07] so he can look at his foot and
[52:09] everything that's the mystery of
[52:10] godliness
[52:13] we we probably sometimes put in our mind
[52:16] that the mystery of godliness is just
[52:18] god walking on the air
[52:20] and not touching anything and everything
[52:22] just being perfect no
[52:23] it was that way it had to be that way
[52:26] so he can manifest what he came to do
[52:29] and the things the situations in your
[52:32] life has to be the way they are
[52:34] they have to be going the way they're
[52:35] going so that the godliness can be
[52:38] manifested through it
[52:42] the mystery of godliness is god
[52:45] manifesting in the flesh
[52:47] and i believe the prophet says one place
[52:49] that is god
[52:50] in the company of human beings doing
[52:53] human being things and
[52:55] and getting involved in human being
[52:56] things why but it was god
[52:59] manifesting what he came to do
[53:15] what i'm says
[53:21] he says so we know that the prophet
[53:24] were in the days gone by it says
[53:28] today it's christ
[53:32] god in sandra time and diverse manner
[53:35] speak to the father by the prophet in
[53:37] the last day
[53:38] but it says but in the last day through
[53:41] his son jesus christ
[53:43] it says which is the holy ghost the holy
[53:46] spirit
[53:47] in us
[53:50] that's the mystery of godliness is that
[53:53] god has given us the spirit
[53:57] that can walk us through the word of god
[53:59] every day
[54:00] not just when we come to church but
[54:02] every situation
[54:04] there's a quickening that's there
[54:05] present to walk you through
[54:07] to guide you what you should do to lead
[54:10] you in the place that he wants you to be
[54:12] why because that's how he desired to
[54:14] reveal himself
[54:15] now i want you to think about this and
[54:18] i'll take it even
[54:19] back to our prophet they bring somebody
[54:22] to be prayed for
[54:23] and here he is and they tell him you
[54:25] gotta go do this and he hadn't received
[54:27] a vision yet he didn't go
[54:30] that's the mystery of godliness he
[54:32] didn't just go around healing everybody
[54:34] he just didn't walk around just doing
[54:36] all kinds of miracles
[54:38] he didn't just go around and say you are
[54:40] healed and i will touch you and you'll
[54:42] be healed and everything
[54:43] no he did it according to the way it was
[54:46] shown unto him
[54:48] even as jesus said that the son do
[54:50] nothing except what the father
[54:52] shows him in other words he was
[54:54] comfortable
[54:55] he was he had no conflict whatsoever
[54:59] in the position that he was between
[55:02] the man flesh that he was and the spirit
[55:04] that dwell within the flesh
[55:06] the spirit had control over the flesh
[55:09] and he did nothing
[55:10] except what the father showed him you
[55:13] know i began to think that's the problem
[55:15] with me
[55:16] sometimes i i began to think about every
[55:18] trouble i've ever been
[55:20] in is because of my flesh every
[55:23] uh a place anything i've done wrong is
[55:25] because
[55:26] i didn't hit through the spirit i
[55:27] followed the flesh any time i thought
[55:30] it's something oh no i should do this
[55:32] and i didn't hear through the spirit
[55:34] that's when he ended up in something
[55:35] terrible but all we have been
[55:38] given the promise that there's gonna
[55:40] come quickening power even at this
[55:42] end time because remember this is not
[55:45] just the holy spirit falling on this is
[55:48] not pentecost
[55:49] but this is the adoption where we can
[55:51] become
[55:52] or brought into the place where our
[55:55] thoughts becomes
[55:56] or god's thoughts become our thoughts
[55:58] god's mind become our mind
[56:00] whatever he desire becomes what he did
[56:02] what we desire
[56:03] in fact it takes us to the place where
[56:05] if he tells us not to say it we don't
[56:07] say it
[56:08] it don't matter how many people will
[56:10] ridicule you if god didn't tell me to do
[56:13] it i won't do it
[56:15] that's the place that we need to get to
[56:17] often time we
[56:18] you know you you've been looking in a
[56:21] prophet's life
[56:22] he got uh he did things just because
[56:24] people put pressure on him
[56:27] and that's what he got in trouble the
[56:29] most was because he was
[56:31] under pressure because things i think
[56:33] about pressure that we go through every
[56:35] day
[56:35] how we do things under pressure good or
[56:37] bad we realize that
[56:39] we're not supposed to do that way
[56:49] so it says which is the holy spirit in
[56:53] us it continues on it says
[56:56] it says arise and shine for the light
[57:00] has come the word light is vindicated
[57:03] again
[57:05] the light vindicated again god's word
[57:08] so that you can see god manifested
[57:10] manifested
[57:12] in his promise of the light of the day
[57:15] or the word given to this age this
[57:19] promise
[57:19] hasn't been ma these promises that's
[57:22] made
[57:23] for this day these promises
[57:27] that was said to that was said by the
[57:29] prophet
[57:30] by jesus himself that in that day god in
[57:33] standard time
[57:34] hebrews chapter 1 it says god in sunday
[57:37] time
[57:37] in diverse manners spoke to the father
[57:40] through the prophet but
[57:41] in the last day through his son
[57:45] god is speaking to his sons in this age
[57:48] and
[57:48] others the manifestation of god as we
[57:51] said
[57:52] is the right manifestation for this hour
[57:55] it's a group of people that have been
[57:57] set aside
[57:58] here to manifest what god intends to
[58:01] manifest
[58:02] in this generation a group of people
[58:04] that have been set aside
[58:06] elected being brought into this adoption
[58:10] where they say nothing except what he
[58:12] tells them to say
[58:23] now
[58:32] the i was watching the scripture speaks
[58:34] and i thought this was very
[58:36] interesting
[58:40] but random speaks in a message shalom it
[58:42] says it speaks about the great light it
[58:44] says
[58:45] it says that the great light that hung
[58:48] upon the wilderness
[58:50] which was which which was that moses
[58:54] forsook
[58:55] egypt esteemed the great reproach of
[58:57] christ greater than the treasure
[58:59] the the treasures of egypt it says
[59:03] that same one that met saul on the road
[59:05] on the road down to damascus
[59:08] a great light that hung before him the
[59:11] same light that same pill of fire
[59:13] soul being a hebrew would never worship
[59:16] anything anything spiritual or anything
[59:21] or call it lord in this position
[59:24] he was in the position that he was in he
[59:26] would say lord who are you
[59:28] he said i'm jesus it says that same
[59:31] light has
[59:32] come to what to manifest
[59:35] to manifest to make known to the people
[59:38] the promise that is made for today for
[59:41] this day
[59:42] manifested light of of the day the
[59:45] darkness
[59:46] is dark is darkened
[59:49] we we know that in in in this message
[59:52] adoption evidence or pastors going
[59:54] through it
[59:56] it is said that it's not for the
[59:58] unbeliever this is the calling for the
[1:00:00] believers
[1:00:01] those that are elected those that have
[1:00:04] been baptized with the holy ghost
[1:00:06] are the ones that are going to be placed
[1:00:08] and we know
[1:00:09] that he came and and he specifically uh
[1:00:13] said that that message was for for the
[1:00:15] elect for the ones that are elected
[1:00:17] and placed i'm sorry those that are
[1:00:19] elected with the holy spirit
[1:00:21] so they could be placed and and you look
[1:00:24] at it we look at it from the standpoint
[1:00:26] of jesus
[1:00:27] we see how that he came he was being he
[1:00:29] was born
[1:00:30] he went to be baptized and he had the
[1:00:32] goalie the holy spirit and he was
[1:00:34] tempted
[1:00:35] and now we see him go to the cross uh
[1:00:38] uh we see him i'm sorry we see him go to
[1:00:41] the mountain of transfiguration
[1:00:43] where the adoption took place and what
[1:00:45] one of them uses that to say he says in
[1:00:48] romans 8 and 1 and 17 it says
[1:00:50] you are born of the spirit of god and
[1:00:52] therefore you should not walk
[1:00:54] in flesh but walk after the spirit
[1:00:58] it says it's the it's for the believer
[1:01:00] the position
[1:01:02] you it's for you to know your position
[1:01:04] in christ
[1:01:05] and why is it that we know our position
[1:01:08] in christ
[1:01:09] it's we we understand in the world that
[1:01:11] we live in
[1:01:12] that you cannot operate effectively
[1:01:15] unless you know exactly
[1:01:17] what you're supposed to do if if a
[1:01:20] person is doubting about what they're
[1:01:21] supposed to do
[1:01:23] or not sure if they should do what
[1:01:24] they're doing it is never
[1:01:26] empowering for you to do that thing but
[1:01:29] when you've come into the realization
[1:01:31] that i have been elected
[1:01:33] that this is where i've been placed for
[1:01:34] me to function
[1:01:36] you you are much more confident and
[1:01:38] that's where
[1:01:39] uh uh power is given for you to operate
[1:01:42] effectively
[1:01:43] so god is wanting to place us to bring
[1:01:46] us into a place
[1:01:48] where we can bring the manifestation of
[1:01:50] this hour
[1:01:51] exactly the way he want us to bring why
[1:01:54] because
[1:01:55] we have we have been uh elected here we
[1:01:58] are
[1:01:58] baptized with the holy spirit and is
[1:02:00] placing us to the place
[1:02:02] where he would want us to be effective
[1:02:05] for the kingdom
[1:02:06] where we can do some good for the
[1:02:08] kingdom where we can
[1:02:10] uh uh do something in order to
[1:02:14] prolong the kingdom or to continue the
[1:02:16] kingdom the place where he can come and
[1:02:18] use us
[1:02:19] and know that it's in harmony with what
[1:02:21] he had chosen
[1:02:22] us to do
[1:02:27] he says he says now
[1:02:33] in the message here he him but when he
[1:02:36] makes this statement he says
[1:02:38] now our lord jesus as we
[1:02:42] as as we are speaking of him i love to
[1:02:45] read
[1:02:46] i love to read after him because he
[1:02:49] never made one mistake
[1:02:51] everything he done was perfect in
[1:02:53] harmony with god
[1:02:55] and how much time he he says how much
[1:02:58] time
[1:02:59] that we waste as as we leisure around
[1:03:03] he says but he never found you never
[1:03:05] found
[1:03:06] jesus at no time ever was
[1:03:10] as we call uh uh
[1:03:13] getting around every move every place
[1:03:16] that he went
[1:03:17] everything that he did everywhere that
[1:03:20] he spoke
[1:03:21] had a meaning to it and was exactly
[1:03:24] in harmony with god and the will of god
[1:03:29] it says
[1:03:30] that's the reason he was so pleased
[1:03:33] with him saying this is my beloved son
[1:03:37] in whom i'm well pleased everything
[1:03:40] was perfectly in harmony with him
[1:03:44] and and i believe that's the desire of
[1:03:46] our hearts tonight
[1:03:48] is that armor need to be developed by
[1:03:50] the hearing of the word
[1:03:52] by the obedience to the word you know
[1:03:55] i believe our greatest hindrance
[1:03:57] sometimes even as a
[1:03:59] messenger told us is ourselves because
[1:04:01] we get to the place like i said
[1:04:03] we get under pressure we get all those
[1:04:05] things and we
[1:04:07] fail under those circumstances to obey
[1:04:09] what the word tells us to do
[1:04:11] but oh if we can go past the pressure
[1:04:14] if we can go past the temptation pass
[1:04:17] and get to the place
[1:04:19] where that relationship is in such a way
[1:04:22] that it don't matter what people say it
[1:04:24] don't matter what you think
[1:04:26] but you act according to what he has
[1:04:28] told you to do
[1:04:29] i believe that perfect harmony will be
[1:04:31] there
[1:04:36] the scripture is full of account
[1:04:40] even as a read
[1:04:44] it it says about calling us to return
[1:04:47] back to god
[1:04:50] and and and you can look at it but i
[1:04:53] want to make so many statements i didn't
[1:04:55] have time
[1:04:56] to to uh uh take them all
[1:04:59] and and you know most of this that
[1:05:02] we cannot go to god unless we were with
[1:05:06] him
[1:05:06] first you cannot
[1:05:10] return to something that you were not
[1:05:12] there before
[1:05:13] so but yet the scripture is calling us
[1:05:15] back to return to god
[1:05:17] it still is putting us in a position
[1:05:19] where
[1:05:20] uh because this world is built in such a
[1:05:23] way
[1:05:24] and and oftentimes we have to be
[1:05:26] reminded
[1:05:28] that we are not here as just sinners
[1:05:30] trying to please god and go to heaven
[1:05:33] even as our pastor was speaking this
[1:05:34] morning it's very important we realize
[1:05:37] that we are the elected people
[1:05:39] we are that seed of god he wants us to
[1:05:42] operate from the standpoint
[1:05:44] that we understand that we are elected
[1:05:47] and we are chosen to be here
[1:05:50] because otherwise you keep going back to
[1:05:52] there again you keep going back to
[1:05:54] question do i have the seed am i really
[1:05:56] the seed
[1:05:57] no that's not the question you let the
[1:05:59] seed if the seed was buried
[1:06:01] you live it in there you don't touch it
[1:06:04] you believe and you continue forward
[1:06:07] so the enemy wants us to constantly be
[1:06:09] questioning something that god has taken
[1:06:11] care of
[1:06:12] but he wants us to operate in the place
[1:06:15] that
[1:06:15] if uh when i'm already the seed what
[1:06:18] should i be producing
[1:06:21] i am the seed what should i be producing
[1:06:24] so as we read now i want you to hear in
[1:06:27] isaiah 44
[1:06:29] verse 21 to 22 he says oh remember all
[1:06:32] ye
[1:06:33] jacob and israel
[1:06:36] for thou are my servant and i have
[1:06:38] formed thee
[1:06:39] thou are my servant o israel thou shalt
[1:06:42] not be forgotten of me
[1:06:44] i have blotted out as a thick cloud that
[1:06:48] transgression
[1:06:49] and as a cloud that's seen return unto
[1:06:51] me
[1:06:52] for i have redeemed thee so in other
[1:06:55] words
[1:06:55] god is wanting us to operate into the
[1:06:58] standpoint where
[1:06:59] we have a complete understanding that we
[1:07:02] are sons and daughters of god
[1:07:04] he wants us to know that and to have
[1:07:06] that
[1:07:07] constantly in our mind as we are
[1:07:09] operating
[1:07:11] never to come to a place where well i'm
[1:07:13] just a sinner
[1:07:14] no he died for you so you don't have to
[1:07:16] call yourself a sinner
[1:07:19] we want to come and approach him in the
[1:07:21] standpoint that i have received the seed
[1:07:24] and i believe that i've been chosen and
[1:07:26] i'm here to do what he called me to do
[1:07:30] so he says oh return unto me what
[1:07:33] the purpose for returning is because
[1:07:35] they were chosen
[1:07:37] he tells them remember o jacob thou are
[1:07:40] my servant
[1:07:41] i have formed thee he made them to be
[1:07:43] what they were
[1:07:47] he says return unto me for i have
[1:07:50] redeemed thee
[1:07:51] it speaks in jeremiah chapter 3 and 14
[1:07:54] it says
[1:07:56] return all backsliding children
[1:07:59] say unto the lord for i am marrying for
[1:08:02] i am married
[1:08:03] unto you and i will take you
[1:08:08] one seat one of this city one of a city
[1:08:11] and two of a family and i will bring you
[1:08:14] unto i will bring you to zion
[1:08:18] in jeremiah 4 and 1 it says if that will
[1:08:21] return
[1:08:22] all israel say the lord return unto me
[1:08:25] and if that will put away thy
[1:08:28] abomination
[1:08:29] out of thy sight it says
[1:08:32] then will thou not be removed
[1:08:36] now it's wanting us reminding us again
[1:08:40] that when as we come when god has come
[1:08:43] and
[1:08:44] and brought us out he's returning us
[1:08:46] back
[1:08:47] to something that he wants to achieve
[1:08:50] because he realized that the mystery of
[1:08:52] god
[1:08:52] is that god wants to restore the
[1:08:55] condition that exists in the garden of
[1:08:57] eden
[1:08:57] when satan came in and caused the fall
[1:09:00] god is working towards the return of the
[1:09:03] kingdom
[1:09:04] so he can establish his kingdom back the
[1:09:06] way it was so we are not coming in
[1:09:08] as sinners into a kingdom we are coming
[1:09:11] back as sons and daughters
[1:09:12] as we were with him i was thinking about
[1:09:15] the prodigal son
[1:09:17] the scripture speaks now this prodigal
[1:09:19] son
[1:09:20] was a son before he left
[1:09:24] he was a son before he left and he was
[1:09:26] aware of who he was
[1:09:28] and here he comes and there's a son and
[1:09:31] and if i could just use that type and
[1:09:33] say that
[1:09:34] the the uh the scripture says that he he
[1:09:37] was going he went into a far country
[1:09:39] sin dragged him away the lust of the
[1:09:42] flesh and
[1:09:42] and everything the messenger tells us
[1:09:46] that
[1:09:46] when man sin it says the spirit didn't
[1:09:49] sin
[1:09:50] because if man had remained a spirit
[1:09:53] there was no way that it was gonna sin
[1:09:56] but what caused sin was the fact that it
[1:09:58] was put into a body of flesh
[1:10:00] it was put into a body of flesh and the
[1:10:03] woman who came out of
[1:10:04] him was part of the byproduct and the
[1:10:07] enemy used that so he can cause the fall
[1:10:09] but it says the spirit didn't sin
[1:10:13] now so when the flesh that's what
[1:10:15] brought the confusion
[1:10:16] no wonder we have such confusion today
[1:10:19] why because it was through the flesh
[1:10:21] every time the enemy comes it comes
[1:10:22] through the flesh so he could tempt us
[1:10:25] and all those things
[1:10:25] he says through the lust of the flesh
[1:10:27] and the the the pride and the
[1:10:30] the eye and all those things that's the
[1:10:32] outlet that the enemy comes in
[1:10:34] through our lives so he can tempt us but
[1:10:36] we realize that
[1:10:37] when god came now he is the man has come
[1:10:40] into sin
[1:10:40] it says but the spirit even in his
[1:10:44] fallen state there was something in adam
[1:10:48] desiring that returned to the place he
[1:10:50] knew something about this place about
[1:10:52] this relationship
[1:10:54] he knew something about what he was to
[1:10:56] be a god something that just
[1:10:58] was within him he just knew because
[1:11:01] remember he was made god over the earth
[1:11:03] and god was god over the universe he
[1:11:06] just knew
[1:11:07] even though he lost it he just knew
[1:11:10] about something about being god
[1:11:11] is another thing that happened even with
[1:11:13] us yet we are
[1:11:15] in sin and all of those yet there's
[1:11:17] something within us
[1:11:18] to just know that this is not right it's
[1:11:21] just asking for the perfect condition
[1:11:23] this cannot be all that it is this is
[1:11:26] not it why because
[1:11:27] there is something that desires to
[1:11:29] return to god
[1:11:32] but it says god put that in you
[1:11:35] and we want to make sure that we use
[1:11:37] that so we can return back to the place
[1:11:40] that god is calling us
[1:11:41] so we find out this prodigal son dragged
[1:11:44] away into a fall country
[1:11:47] in sin and he squandered everything that
[1:11:49] he had even
[1:11:51] as the scripture tells us and he lost
[1:11:53] everything that he had and
[1:11:54] he was in sin and and he came until the
[1:11:57] place where
[1:11:58] he didn't have a place to sleep
[1:12:03] all the people that he taught were
[1:12:04] friends they ran away from him
[1:12:08] all of the ones that caused him to come
[1:12:10] out there were no way to be found
[1:12:15] and he continue on he continue on and
[1:12:20] he finally finds himself in a pig pen
[1:12:25] what a place what a place he finds
[1:12:29] himself in a pig planet
[1:12:31] a big pen and and over there with
[1:12:35] pigs and and just just wrestling and
[1:12:38] and fighting for food the scripture says
[1:12:42] that
[1:12:43] one day he came back to himself
[1:12:48] when he came back to himself the first
[1:12:50] thing that he knows
[1:12:52] that he's a son now he didn't think
[1:12:55] he realized that this is not who i am i
[1:12:58] am made to be a son
[1:12:59] i was made i was created a son
[1:13:03] and the scripture says when he came back
[1:13:05] to himself he said
[1:13:06] i'll go back to my father it says even
[1:13:08] the servant in my father's house
[1:13:11] they have better food than theirs it
[1:13:13] says i will return
[1:13:14] my father even if if he can only take me
[1:13:17] as a servant
[1:13:18] but oh i tell you in the kingdom of his
[1:13:21] father
[1:13:22] there was no way absolutely that he a
[1:13:24] son can come and return as a servant
[1:13:26] as that was a type of god that when his
[1:13:29] son has gone out and is returning
[1:13:31] there is no way that son can take a
[1:13:33] different place
[1:13:34] except the place i was predestinated for
[1:13:36] him to be in
[1:13:39] we can be made servant we are called to
[1:13:42] be sons
[1:13:43] we are called to be daughters of god we
[1:13:45] are called to be gods and to reign with
[1:13:47] him
[1:13:48] we are god we are called to have
[1:13:49] dominion upon the things that are upon
[1:13:51] us
[1:13:52] where greatness is the mystery of
[1:13:53] godliness we are called to manifest god
[1:13:57] within this flesh
[1:14:01] that's why i begin my statement and just
[1:14:03] say i'm just tired of this world i'm
[1:14:05] just tired of being a human
[1:14:08] every time you work up it's human
[1:14:10] thinking and it's human thinking upon
[1:14:12] human thinking
[1:14:13] it's adding and subtracting and and
[1:14:15] dividing and it doesn't add up and
[1:14:17] go try to put more calls and do this i
[1:14:20] would just want to work up and i'm
[1:14:21] thinking as god
[1:14:24] that's a desire for my heart just to see
[1:14:26] the god out of me and says
[1:14:28] that semi says it's the adoption time
[1:14:31] god is waiting for you and i
[1:14:33] why and how does he start it starts with
[1:14:35] the desire within your heart
[1:14:37] for you to desire to see god within your
[1:14:40] flesh
[1:14:40] it starts with his your desire and god
[1:14:43] coming and making that desire reality
[1:14:48] we couldn't desire it unless it was
[1:14:50] somewhere that god could bring it to
[1:14:52] come to pass
[1:14:54] it says in jeremiah 24 and 5 he said
[1:14:57] again
[1:15:00] the word of the word of the lord came
[1:15:02] unto me saying
[1:15:04] thou saith the lord the god of israel
[1:15:09] like this good fig so will i acknowledge
[1:15:13] them
[1:15:14] that are carried away captive into jew
[1:15:17] of judah captive of judah whom i have
[1:15:19] sent out
[1:15:20] of this place into the land of the
[1:15:23] chaldeans
[1:15:24] for their good for i will set
[1:15:27] mine eyes upon them for good
[1:15:30] now i want you to think about that i
[1:15:32] will set my night upon them
[1:15:34] for good and i will bring them again
[1:15:38] to this land
[1:15:43] it means that we're there before
[1:15:48] we're not going to a strange place
[1:15:51] we're going to a place that we've been
[1:15:54] before
[1:15:55] i wonder when we begin to see that place
[1:15:57] we'll just recognize it
[1:15:58] yeah i remember this i remember this
[1:16:00] just like that little
[1:16:01] the young man who was lost and he went
[1:16:03] to the war and he had amnesia
[1:16:05] but yet they began to take him and and
[1:16:07] they were with him in the train and
[1:16:09] they'd be
[1:16:09] they let him wander and he began to walk
[1:16:11] he says no dude
[1:16:12] go and take him he said no just leave
[1:16:14] him living by himself he began to walk
[1:16:16] and he began to lock it he began to walk
[1:16:19] it
[1:16:19] and finally just sits the tower and
[1:16:21] something just rings a bell
[1:16:23] he says i know that
[1:16:26] i'm telling you that's the path because
[1:16:28] they say these things are not given so
[1:16:30] we can apply it to other people
[1:16:32] it's been given so we can apply it every
[1:16:34] step of the way
[1:16:35] why god is dropping hints upon you so
[1:16:38] you can say
[1:16:39] oh if i recognize it it's him showing it
[1:16:41] to me if i recognize it it's him showing
[1:16:43] it to me
[1:16:44] how do you with this everything that's
[1:16:46] happening
[1:16:47] how do you come to the right mind to
[1:16:49] decide what's right and what's wrong
[1:16:57] everything people have lost their minds
[1:17:00] there's no basis of of of even
[1:17:03] measuring and and it's just any time
[1:17:06] something is mentioned
[1:17:07] this group pulls that way that group
[1:17:09] there's no room for
[1:17:10] anybody to listen to anybody
[1:17:14] but oh i'm so thankful that we have a
[1:17:16] word of god
[1:17:17] that can just come and say i recognize
[1:17:20] what he's saying
[1:17:21] this is what i desire i don't desire
[1:17:23] anything happening out there
[1:17:25] i want to be exactly as he promised that
[1:17:27] i'll be in the end time why because it's
[1:17:30] god
[1:17:32] calling you it's the prodigal son
[1:17:35] recognizing
[1:17:36] this is not what i was called to be
[1:17:39] and the scripture says that when he came
[1:17:41] back the fredo hogan has a fist
[1:17:45] he said that they will go and put a rope
[1:17:48] upon him now it wasn't they they didn't
[1:17:51] welcome him just as a
[1:17:53] the father didn't say well you know you
[1:17:55] already squandered what was your part so
[1:17:57] there's nothing left for you you're just
[1:17:59] gonna go and
[1:18:00] work with the servants and everything no
[1:18:02] you know why
[1:18:03] because the father always have enough
[1:18:06] the father always have enough
[1:18:08] you can never exhaust the wealth of the
[1:18:10] father
[1:18:11] he has enough for every one of his sons
[1:18:14] if you are a son you have a place
[1:18:16] if you are a daughter you have a place
[1:18:18] he's met an inheritance for every single
[1:18:20] one of us
[1:18:21] in fact he counted every single one of
[1:18:23] us before he can go pay the price
[1:18:26] he counted it says and he called you by
[1:18:28] name
[1:18:29] he counted and says i know this one i
[1:18:31] know this one i know this one
[1:18:32] he didn't say well god i remember the
[1:18:34] meaning sentence that i have no
[1:18:36] he called you by name and then once he
[1:18:38] counted all the name he says
[1:18:40] now i'll go pay the price for all of
[1:18:42] this that i just counted
[1:18:46] it's the father's pleasure to say for
[1:18:49] him for him to give you the kingdom
[1:18:51] it's the father desire to give you the
[1:18:54] kingdom
[1:18:54] it's not his kingdom he didn't want it
[1:18:58] god didn't create the earth so he can
[1:19:00] come and rule upon the earth
[1:19:01] that was not his intention he created it
[1:19:05] so his sons and daughters can rule upon
[1:19:07] it
[1:19:09] he created it for adam and if we can
[1:19:12] come to a place and realize
[1:19:14] why am i asking for this because the
[1:19:16] father wants me to have it
[1:19:18] you don't ask for anything that the
[1:19:20] father don't desire for you to have
[1:19:38] he says in the church age it says
[1:19:48] oh after after reading john chapter 5
[1:19:52] and 19 it says
[1:19:54] as we talked about the armor and he says
[1:19:55] this harmony
[1:19:57] is now to exist between the groom and
[1:19:59] the bride
[1:20:02] he shows her his word of life
[1:20:05] and she receives it
[1:20:10] i think that's simple but that's very
[1:20:12] important
[1:20:16] because this word has been shown to a
[1:20:18] lot of people and they haven't received
[1:20:20] it
[1:20:24] this word has been shown to a lot of
[1:20:26] people some have acknowledged it
[1:20:28] oh i see i see what you mean
[1:20:32] but no way to find the application of it
[1:20:36] the application of it comes in the
[1:20:38] obedience
[1:20:40] you know i was thinking about many
[1:20:43] people
[1:20:44] want they they want something big to
[1:20:46] happen
[1:20:47] they want some great event for for it to
[1:20:49] shake them
[1:20:51] but that's not the promise for the bride
[1:20:56] because brother branham says that it's
[1:20:58] not the government forces that will move
[1:21:00] the bride it says it's the word
[1:21:02] that moves the bride it's to receive the
[1:21:05] word that we have received
[1:21:06] now california can sing today it don't
[1:21:09] mean anything
[1:21:10] in regards to where we have to be with
[1:21:12] the word
[1:21:15] is it going to sink absolutely because
[1:21:16] there was a promise that is going to
[1:21:18] sink
[1:21:20] but we can't be sitting in a place where
[1:21:22] our clocks are turned towards and say
[1:21:24] okay is it singing how far is it santa
[1:21:27] no
[1:21:28] we have to be in the word so that the
[1:21:31] things that the word has promised will
[1:21:33] come to pass within our lives
[1:21:35] and i began to think just how
[1:21:39] even simple the rapture would be
[1:21:42] and people will miss it
[1:21:47] you know i i was i remember
[1:21:50] going to a you know a training
[1:21:53] training with someone and you know they
[1:21:56] show me
[1:21:58] what what we had to do goodness it was
[1:22:00] very intimidating
[1:22:02] lights flashing over here this part
[1:22:04] doing this and not part doing that
[1:22:06] and i'm like there's no way we could put
[1:22:09] this together
[1:22:10] there's no i don't think i have enough
[1:22:12] time to learn and remember all of this
[1:22:15] but the person told me said you know
[1:22:17] don't just everything that you've seen
[1:22:19] and everything just don't worry about it
[1:22:20] let's go back to
[1:22:21] it took a pen and a paper remember this
[1:22:24] remember this remember this remember
[1:22:25] this
[1:22:26] it says you do this here you do this
[1:22:27] here you do this here in other words
[1:22:29] what i'm saying is
[1:22:30] it's not this great gigantic event that
[1:22:32] we have to sit
[1:22:33] and worry about that is coming and when
[1:22:35] it's going to come and everything
[1:22:37] no the secret lies in the preparation
[1:22:40] and the things that are done
[1:22:41] on the daily basis basically he told me
[1:22:45] just go ahead and you just do this part
[1:22:48] don't worry about this other part just
[1:22:49] do this make sure you know how to do it
[1:22:51] i did it as i he says can you do it
[1:22:53] again i said yes okay
[1:22:54] move here can you do this now i said
[1:22:56] yeah i could do it and can you do that
[1:22:58] and then i was able to do it
[1:23:00] and pretty soon i was able to do all of
[1:23:02] those little things
[1:23:03] and then it produced the same thing that
[1:23:05] i was scared of
[1:23:06] looking
[1:23:10] the rapture will come will happen
[1:23:13] by us doing exactly what we're doing
[1:23:16] right now
[1:23:17] coming to church praying to god and
[1:23:19] working up in the morning
[1:23:20] seeking for his face letting him guide
[1:23:22] you in the morning
[1:23:23] waking up and taking care of this and
[1:23:25] doing this and you don't have to go find
[1:23:28] anything anywhere else it's in the word
[1:23:30] it's in the obedience in the word
[1:23:32] it's by following what he said it's by
[1:23:34] walking with him every day
[1:23:36] it's by doing all of those things the
[1:23:38] smaller things that adds to the big
[1:23:40] thing
[1:23:45] it's not it's not for us to look into
[1:23:48] the domain that doesn't belong to us
[1:23:50] we concentrate on the domain that we
[1:23:52] have been given
[1:23:54] which is the obedience to the word
[1:23:58] you know you think about jesus even
[1:24:02] we can even take it to a prophet
[1:24:05] here he is and in one situation he's
[1:24:08] able to raise a dead baby
[1:24:11] to raise a dead person
[1:24:14] he walks into a different situation a
[1:24:16] sick person he doesn't know what to do
[1:24:20] because nothing had been shown to him
[1:24:24] people want him to do he said well all i
[1:24:26] could do is just pray i haven't been
[1:24:28] shown anything i i can't i cannot
[1:24:31] if he hadn't shown me he said my own mom
[1:24:34] my own mother
[1:24:36] he said he didn't show me anything i
[1:24:38] couldn't go and say mom
[1:24:40] stand up and i said i'll just continue
[1:24:42] to pray
[1:24:43] it was hit to him and i'm saying that to
[1:24:47] just show that
[1:24:50] it's in the humility it's in those even
[1:24:53] somewhat the picture of weakness
[1:24:56] somewhat a picture
[1:24:57] seems like this person doesn't know or
[1:25:00] it seems like he's confused at times and
[1:25:02] all those things
[1:25:03] yet in that is manifested the greatest
[1:25:06] power
[1:25:08] that we've ever seen why because when
[1:25:11] the thing was shown
[1:25:13] it was confidence that was put on the
[1:25:15] display when it wasn't shown it was the
[1:25:18] word that was applied
[1:25:19] the word says to do this i'll do exactly
[1:25:21] what the word says
[1:25:22] if i don't understand i'll just do what
[1:25:24] the word says but when
[1:25:26] i come to the place where it's clearly
[1:25:27] revealed to me then i will apply exactly
[1:25:30] what
[1:25:30] he wants me to say why it's god
[1:25:34] the mystery of godliness god revealing
[1:25:37] the human flesh if the musician could
[1:25:39] come
[1:25:45] because if we're not mistaken people
[1:25:46] will think the image of
[1:25:48] god or going back to god
[1:25:51] is us walking on the air and just
[1:25:54] healing everybody and standing up the
[1:25:56] dead and doing all of that
[1:25:58] no is to come to a place
[1:26:01] where whether it be ridicule
[1:26:04] whether it be criticism whether it be
[1:26:06] anything
[1:26:07] it doesn't move you what moves you is
[1:26:09] what he says for you to do
[1:26:12] let's all stand
[1:26:30] let's just bar heads i mean i trusted
[1:26:33] your desire
[1:26:35] because it's truly my desire
[1:26:39] that that adoption may be manifested in
[1:26:43] my life
[1:26:45] that i can get to a place where
[1:26:49] it's just me and him i don't care what
[1:26:52] anybody thinks
[1:26:54] i don't think i don't care what
[1:26:57] if people think i lost my mind that's
[1:26:59] fine with me
[1:27:01] but the desire is lord is this what you
[1:27:03] really want me to do then i'll go do it
[1:27:06] where pressure means nothing
[1:27:11] where temptation can be overcome because
[1:27:14] the desire and the promises that that
[1:27:17] power will come
[1:27:18] and cause us to be overcomers
[1:27:20] [Music]
[1:27:22] gracious father that's all desire
[1:27:24] tonight lord
[1:27:27] lord i raise my hand and we pray to you
[1:27:30] lord
[1:27:32] lord that we may come to the place lord
[1:27:36] and
[1:27:39] you didn't give us the holy spirit so we
[1:27:40] could just go run around and do whatever
[1:27:42] we wanted with it
[1:27:44] but you gave us so you can bring us to
[1:27:46] that placing
[1:27:48] that place where we could be so obedient
[1:27:50] so listening
[1:27:52] about the father's work
[1:27:55] the desire of the father what the father
[1:27:58] desire becomes what burns it within our
[1:28:00] souls
[1:28:03] look like the scripture speaks about the
[1:28:05] servants of david a desire to drink from
[1:28:08] a fountain from a
[1:28:09] well oh god they took the sword and went
[1:28:12] and fulfilled the desire of the
[1:28:14] king and when they brought water the
[1:28:16] king took it and he poured it on the
[1:28:18] floor
[1:28:20] on the ground because he realized he was
[1:28:21] not even worthy to drink it
[1:28:24] lord we want to be that way lord when we
[1:28:27] hear your word and something within our
[1:28:29] heart just want to go out and
[1:28:31] fulfill every bit of it until you are
[1:28:33] satisfied to see it come to pass within
[1:28:35] ours
[1:28:35] [Music]
[1:28:37] give us strength guide us and lead us
[1:28:39] lord where we have fallen short
[1:28:41] give us strength so we can overcome and
[1:28:43] stand and walk according to your way
[1:28:46] we love you we commit everything into
[1:28:48] your hands and ask us things in the name
[1:28:50] of jesus christ amen

[1:37:52] revelation that you want us to see
[1:37:55] or we ask that you would just be with
[1:37:57] this church lord be with each individual
[1:37:59] or we know there's a collective body
[1:38:01] around the world lord that is
[1:38:03] positioning themselves getting ready for
[1:38:05] the rapture
[1:38:06] helpless lord to have that faith give us
[1:38:08] that eyesight that we could see
