Description:
Br. Paul Ossou
Interpreter: Br. Billy Mbuyi
Wednesday Evening Service: July 22,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

[Music] oh [Applause] [Music] is [Music] yes [Music] without you [Music] but when you are here lord [Music] [Music] in the name of jesus christ amen we're going to read the two scriptures the word the first one in amos chapter eight versi on that place uh verse 11 to 13. and then we'll move to a very familiar scripture reading in malachi 4. amos chapter 8 verse 11 it says behold the day the days come sayeth the lord that i will send a famine in the land nor not a famine of bread nor of thirst for water but the hearing of the word of the lord and they shall wander from sea to sea and from north even to the east they shall run to and fro and seek the word of the lord and shall not find it in that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst also let's turn to malachi chapter four so from verse one it says behold for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all and all the proud yea and all that do wicket wickedly shall be shall be stubble and on the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch but unto you that fear my name shall the sign of righteousness arise with healing in its wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of their style and ye shall thread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soul of you of your feet in the day that that i shall do this say with the lord of hosts remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto him in horeb for all israel with the statute of judgment behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the hearts the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse thinner jesus lord jesus like people that have learned to read it we write your word mr but only you can give the context and you can give the life that comes with it because the light will kill us but it's the spirit that giveth life important force speak to us once more in the name of jesus christ amen amen i have your seats i'm not yet able to preach in english in super prayer oppression and english so i'm obliged to preach in french if i try to preach in english she should say the question maybe some words you will not able to understand what i want to say so i'm glad to preach in french if you see don't to have me to speak again tonight and tonight uh based on the scriptures that we read i'm going to speak a little bit on the message that i titled why the message of the hour why the message of the end time we know that we are at the end time when we see in the bible everything that was described based on the end times we are leaving those things [Music] the bible tells us in second timothy chapter 3 that in the end cruel people there will be lovers of pleasures more than god and all the riches breakers uh non-religious people and this scripture speaks also in matthew 24. that in the end time they're not supposed to leave and all of us we know we are at the end time everything that we are living right now what was in the time of noah what was it the time of lord natural when we look at it on the natural aspect of it are complete with a complete menthol we can see that those things have happened or they are happening right now and as we are at the end time and we know all of us that are gathering here that god has given us grace that god will send a famine on the land let's just say people will go to and fro they will go from the the north onto the east they will try to seek for the word of the lord but they will not find it the jerky power because it's god who's speaking the jerky prophetess it's god prophesying through amos with this prophecy of amos we can say all of us lose yourself i will condemn to seek for the word of god and not to find it a conjunction and when god sends the thirst it's like in the natural when you have when you are thirsting when you've crushed the wilderness on board when you've gone two weeks without drinking if you find a source of water even if it's dirty you're gonna drink of it here it's difficult to go a mile without finding a church building because people are thirsty because people and they are obligated to go anywhere to go find it just so they can appease their thirst it comes with like i was saying if we were to stay with this prophecy of amos every single one of us we were lost but when god thought of you and me god open a breach god called malachite to say that to you just for you that are fearing had decided to give this promise to it says for you behold i will send you elijah the prophet that's why i have the habit of saying if god has given you grace to sit in the church to message church you hear this message it's already a true grace it's the love of god it means god loves you you know otherwise you were going to find yourself in the prophecy of amos yeah and because of that we're gonna just try to see why the message of the end time what's your message why is god sending us this message of the end time we all know that this messenger of the end time uh many times i have the habit of saying that to those that have not believed the message of the hour yeah i'll tell them that god promised don't you leave the deputy in second peter chapter 3 that the the heavens and the earth of the present is reserved for fire death that god will destroy this earth by fire mercury but just like in the time of noah the triloman god cannot destroy the earth without telling us which is the way of escape and today we cannot build the ark like noah major but god is obligated to do just like it did in the time of noah and love to send us a man to show us the way hey and malachite says [Music] according to the scriptures you will not receive that if you want to be sure to be saved find yourself in elijah be sure is fulfill what the scripture says that he's going to fulfill in this time why but mark is we're going to take first uh a little bit obviously it's talking about the transfiguration refills you and restoreth all things and how is it written of the son of man that he must suffer many things that they have done unto him what's whatsoever they listed as it is written description when you take the same description in matthew chapter 17 that the disciple understood that he was talking about john the baptist but when we read of this scripture we see clearly that jesus bowed [Music] he's speaking about two separate elijahs he says elias must come [Music] in other words jesus is giving the definition to what elijah elias was going to do [Music] jesus is saying what elias must do any gender elias must come and he will restore all things and we know that that john the baptist didn't restore all things we know that in the book of acts john the baptist had already come he was killed it was here's the evidence and jesus came he was crucified when the time of the refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord and they shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you whom the heaven must receive until the time of the restitution of all things don't you are paralyzed which god has spoke by the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began since john baptists are there if john the baptist had accomplished or established everything jesus was not going to be received in heaven until the restitution of all things it means that the time of the restitution of all things something that was to be coming in the future when the book of acts was being written and jesus said because son that only elias anything it's talking about bringing something back to its original statement it means something was me it was displaced something lost this nature and that thing had to be brought back in the original state why the message of the hour the end time to restore all things but this title did has to be given back to us god had to give us a tarot deal back so we can come back to the original position and that's the purpose for the message of the hour it's the restitution of all things by the prophet elias it's gonna do two things you set he's saying now the messenger of malachi 4 in revelation 10 7 is going to do two things he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders of revelation 10. which are the revelation containing the seven seals it will be this divinely revealed mystery truth divinely revealed mystery truth that will literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal father exactly so the message of the end time for the restitution of all things and this restitution of all things according to malachi chapter four the hearts they don't form of children has to be brought back to the hearts of the apostles to the father the apostolic fathers we know that throughout the ages that they uh the gospel lost his meaning people didn't know what kind of god they were worshiping they were worshiping god the father the son and the holy spirit they didn't know who they were sending their prayers to let's not but you do not repair it if you think people were baptizing in the name of the father the the the holy spirit and the lord people had gone away from the gospel but in order for us to have the real phrase we focus on messaging that this messenger had to bring us back first from the mother that put to the foundation of the apostles to the faith that the father had allah to the word that was preached by the fathers to the worship that the apostles had and you have to know who we are worshiping i had the habit of telling my friends jehovah witnesses do you know it could come like as the dad went out that he changed his clothing that he changed the form he comes back and you're wondering is it him or is it not him yeah you still should give me the free fair but it's the only one thing that you need to do it's to ask to his wife that's good because to the wife he will reveal himself he never hides himself instead of just saying you are jehovah witness jehovah changed the forms and his bride he can assure you that your jehovah of the old testament it's jesus christ of the new year and that's why university in the classroom comes and one time i said i made a declaration before a friend who was a jehovah's witness i told them do you know that jehovah witnessed they don't have the holy spirit he was he was shocked he may point a bible i said take your bible jesus said that you wait in jerusalem that you will receive a power it will come upon you the holy spirit you will because the bible says [Music] [Music] he made it in such a way that the bible has become a new book to us when we read this bible we find marvelous things in it the things that the wise and the prudent they just go over. the question about the the deity of jesus christ it can be solved by one scripture there's a lot of scripture to talk about it fifth uh verse the bible says one law it says one one lord insult for one faith one baptism as a jew one god and father of all who is above all and through all in that we will call god the son and in all of us that we would call god the holy spirit just one lord remember the same kill this to the tooth is above all barney tooth is in all truth it's in all of us all addiction and this messenger allah had to bring us back to the the faith of the apostles allah that when they will pray god that god was able to take our episode to enter into prison ascendant to break off the chains that appear to open the prison bar and to tell to peter exactly where they were exactly praying for him the faith that the father the apostles when peter and john develop when they were to get caught when they were before this uh they were looking at the man he said we have no money no silver power they didn't they need that they had this power rise up and walk paralytic and the crippled man was able to walk that's what the message is taking us back to i wanted a memphis to have that same kind of faith as the consulate said to prisons to be conscious of the power that god has given us you know many times the devil tries to lie to us to tell us we don't have that it doesn't you don't it doesn't neces you don't need to have strength that's the one man it doesn't even need for you to shake used to quiet predicate sometimes as preachers we think that the anointing when we're about to break the glass but just look that the most the most powerful anointing was upon him he's fulfilled sometimes we don't even need to pray for somebody when you have need of something who comes with that when you are sick just the preaching of the word itself the blessing that you have need off the message of the end times according to malachi how many allah bring us back to the faith of the apostles is it says there must rise a message that will shake the hearts of the people right back to the apostolic uh the apostolic fathers again a wilderness man that will come out and you will have a message that will run right straight back to the word again [Music] that's the hour we are living in allah considerably then consider now jeff demon uncertainty i ask you in this hour you people hear of jeffersonville ominous in 19 and 33 la lumiere naturale de santilla or fluff the supernatural light fell upon down fell fell fell down yonder on the river also you laugh because your batista sang some person that day when i was baptizing 500 500 in the name of the lord jesus i was about a 20 year old boy what did it say the first one jeffersonville at the foot of the spring streets there when the when the courier journal erode i believe it was the louisville uh herald aprilia anatix usually pack that article pack that article of it upon it went plumbed across the associate plus prime into canada the doctor doctor cut it out after that cut it out off the of a paper way in canada in 1933 when i was baptizing my seventeenth person yes under this witness [Music] a light came down from heaven shining down above there community like a falling like a star falling from the heaven in what a voice said come back as john the baptist was sent to be the forerunner of the first coming of christ your message shall for run his second coming in the world this day this scripture is fulfilled this day je la ve pumi that god has confirmed that to whom god said grace that his message will for run the second coming of christ and that's why it's the only man to whom god has asked the magazine to to to to to to save up to store up land with you food predication all is preaching all his messages so that he could go around the world when god said that this good news has to go to the automotive parts of the earth and then the end will come he's talking about this message to go to the ends of the earth but because it's this message showing us the plane of salvation and it's this messenger [Music] had to bring the heart of the the children back to the father the apostolic father and according to uh uh revelation 10. [Music] it has to reveal all the mysteries that we left danielle when you take the book of daniel that is daniel chapter 12 i believe the bible said that god showed to daniel things that that's the one who said you'll ask god what will happen to these things daniel god said oh daniel it says go go in peace it says go lay in peace that shows this thing these things will remain secret until the time of the end i love please and then manny will read it and then their understanding will grow thunder illa killer he said that he wanted to write of it julia didn't know god said no don't write sell seal guard keep it second what the thunders have spoken i love what you said that at the voice of the seventh angels when it began to sound good when you proclaim his message let me tell you the mystery of god so we can have the restoration of all things so god has to send us a messenger to whom he has revealed these things to him if you don't have access as a prophetic to this prophet who brings back to the apostolic to whom that abdomen gave them the revelation of the mysteries of god you are on the side and that's the reason for the message of god that's why god sent the message of the end time today there's many preachers which by their own knowledge they are just causing uh misunderstanding chaos people think today that the revelation of the seven seals that's the revelation of the seven thunders it's to always every time when you preach just scream seven thunders seven seals seven thousand seven seals even barbara who preached the seven seals a president said so after the seven sails he preached a lot of other messages with different titles in which he didn't even mention the seven thunders or seven sails today i believe that there are preachers if brother branham was still alive that there were preachers that were going to explain brother branham's message to himself to brother branham before but but branham says i want to appreciate you know before you preach the seals god doesn't do nothing for nothing before one of my appreciation but i preached when god is just about to do something to deliver his people god sends a message to the people it's a terrible sample and it's so simple as we will see it in the breaking of the of these seals that was the purpose that was the my purpose of bringing this first second that what we'll find out so that the breaking of those seals is so simple that the smart remote then million demands we'll miss it you see it's expected you see i hope that god will anoint me for that why where is the passport this year it just goes over the top and that's the reason i thought the message of this morning will be appropriate to lay the foundation on the simplicity of god you see don't use your cash dollars how god hides himself in simplicity people are complicating things that they just causing confusion god is in the simplicity and it's not because it's not because somebody screams every day seven thunders seven seals seven thunder seven seals that he does have the revelation for seven thunders or seven sails let's take the book of second king last they called elite only that's when uh [Music] we're gonna read and then i'm going to skip a little bit second king chapter second king chapter no second see chapter two okay second king chapter two and it came to pass that when the lord would take up elijah unto heaven with a whirlwind that elisha that elijah went with elisha from gilgal and when elijah said unto elisha terry here i prayed for the lord had sent me to bethel and the lash and elisha said unto him as the lord liveth as my soul liveth i will not leave thee so they went down to bethel and as the son of the prophets that were at the at battle came forth elisha came forth to elisha and said unto him knoweth that that the lord will take away thy master from thee from thy head today and he said yea i know hold ye your peace and the last elijah said unto elisha terry here i pray thee for the lord has sent me to jericho and he said and andy and he said as the lord liveth and as my soul liveth i will not live dee so they they so they went to jericho and the sons of the prophet where that were at jericho came and came to elisha and said unto him know with that that the lord will take away the master from thy head today and he said and he answered and said unto any answer yay i know it hold your peace hold thee your peace 15 and when the sons of the prophet which were to view at jericho saw him they said the spirit of elisha do rest on elisha the spirit of elijah do rest on elijah and they came to meet him and bow themselves to the ground before him and they said unto him behold now they'll be they'll be with thee with a servant 50 strong man let them go and pray we pray thee and seek thy master let's let's uh lest prayer adventure the spirit of the lord had taken him up and cast him upon some mountain unto some valley and he said ye shall not send. and when when they urged him to wender herjim when they urged when and when they urged him till he was ashamed he said send them therefore fifty men and they shot there for 50 men and they sought three days and found him not for it you see it's here the bible was telling us the prophet that they were sons of the prophet at bethel they were sons of prophets at jericho they were basically trying to preach to elisha the the the the rapture of elijah elijah if pressure is they were preaching to elisha the the the rapture of elisha in other words that they were to understand what they uh the rapture of elijah was look closely that when elijah was taken when elijah was coming back and he met the same sons of the prophet that were preaching rapture listen for hallelujah they were trying to preach to him and say well perhaps the spirit of god took him and he threw him somewhere on some mountain let's go try to find him in other words they were preaching something that they had no revelation about please don't push it they preach he's offered the demonstration they did demonstrations what just circulation these two to sort the shoes i know people say all kinds of things and we know that a lot of it is not right upon this you can not the secret import i cannot answer for what others any any man says i got to answer for what i say [Music] i can only say what it whether it's the truth or not and i'm i'm one that has to be responsible for it another circle not whatever somebody else says i can't judge no man i wasn't sent to judge me but to preach the message it's not going to all the demonstration that people are doing around the seven sales and the seventh time it's so fun [Music] today the message is not just something that's accessible to the preacher the message is that the message is accessible to all the believers and and and all the uh believers all the all believers have to be able to be uh christians the believers who would go and verify everything that the preachers will say to see what if what they were saying was conformed to the scriptures to see if what they were saying was it was was confirmed to what brother branham said they see the paper confirmed and if it wasn't so they would not receive it the preachers are given they they they are given the gift to go and take the scriptures and put scriptures together so they can bring the image to the people and revelation 10 7 in order for god to confirm him at the same time and he wanted to accomplish something else in this ministry according to luke 17 8 uh 18 to uh 28 to 30. second god wanted to manifest the sign of the the signs of the son of man through the ministry of elijah we know in the time of abraham justice god made a body god entered into the body with two angels he visited abraham he manifested the sign of the son of man in the time of jesus do you remember god himself the fabric he made a body in the womb of mary manifested to sin defeat the lord and he manifested the son of the sign the son of man to the jews and to the samaritans and we know according to scriptures that there's three races of people the jews samaritans who are half jew have gentiles and the gentiles and god promised according to the this scripture of luke 17. that it will manifest the same thing for the gentiles but contrary to what god did in the time of abraham and even in the time of jesus in our generation god didn't make another body god took immortal man and i'm not done lupita a man born of sin conceit dominicity it's someone who was born in iniquity to whom god had made just given grace for god to take him and express himself to his people but that didn't make that person refit the lord remember the son of man himself says three one two seven read it when you go home when you get home the message the seventh angel message opening up the seals question what is it but the messenger is revealing the son of man fell a distance no can you get it separated now difficult that's where it seems to be so hard for you it's very difficult today question that was in the time of jesus that in this time is also god the messenger says it was that the messenger the messenger is not the son of man that is revealing the son of man it is a sackiest song with the tell me this he says that's where it seems so hard for you lovely man not the son of man melo but the seventh angel the section the seventh messenger of the lord is revealing to the public the son of man because it left a left shark in the paper unfair here there's one anointed ones the sword is on choi they're so-called believers and the unbelievers the formal and the pentecostal church stand up against the true grain fully syrup manifested but let them alone their foley will be made manifest bless their heirs you see i understand you now don't god ten one through seven for him to reveal to us the mysteries look this certified the manifestation luke 17 30 the manifestation of the son of man and all those things to the position of the sons and daughters of god the position of the sons and daughters of god who can manifest christ who can show that he's the same yesterday today so we're going to start from first but in the day of the voice of the seventh angel contest when he shall begin to sound the mysterious accomplishment the mystery should the mysteries of god should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophet and the voice that i heard from heaven spoke again and to me and said go and take the book which was open in the hand of the angel that stand upon the the sea and upon the the earth and i went unto the angel and i said unto him give me the little book says is turning to john go to the angel do you want to leave ask for the book i leave here and john john went to the end and he asked for the book is the lava launch and i went to the angel and i asked for the little book and he said paulu take it and eat it and it shall be belly
