[7:25] amen
[7:26] good morning
[7:27] we're going to go ahead and read psalm
[7:29] 118 this morning
[7:33] and uh
[7:35] you know i was reading this and
[7:38] was struck by a statement that david
[7:41] makes in the psalm
[7:43] in verse 5
[7:46] he says i called upon the lord in
[7:48] distress
[7:50] the lord answered me
[7:52] and set me in a large place
[7:57] he set me in a large place
[8:02] david makes this statement again in
[8:04] psalm 18
[8:06] 19
[8:07] which is also second samuel 22 20
[8:11] after defeating all those giants that
[8:13] sought to destroy him
[8:15] he says he brought me forth also into a
[8:18] large place
[8:22] he delivered me because
[8:24] he delighted in me
[8:27] you know that's an unusual statement a
[8:29] large setting them and setting him in a
[8:32] large place that's an unusual statement
[8:35] you know it isn't really used very often
[8:37] in scripture except for very specific
[8:39] cases
[8:42] what does it mean to be set in a large
[8:44] place
[8:46] by the lord
[8:49] david says it again in psalm 31
[8:53] and this time he gives us a little bit
[8:54] of a clue
[8:56] about what this means
[8:58] it's in psalm 31 7-8 it says i will be
[9:01] glad
[9:02] and rejoice in thy mercy
[9:05] for thou hast considered my trouble
[9:08] thou hast known my
[9:10] soul
[9:11] in adversities
[9:13] and hast not shut me up
[9:17] into the hand of the enemy
[9:19] thou hast set my foot in a large room
[9:24] so instead of being shut up
[9:27] to the hand of the enemy
[9:31] being contained with a limited set of
[9:33] options
[9:35] or no options
[9:37] caught between a rock and a hard place
[9:40] he has set him in a large room
[9:44] in a large space
[9:48] you know think about that how many times
[9:49] do we find ourselves in situations or in
[9:52] circumstances maybe where
[9:54] it seems like we're between a rock and a
[9:56] hard place
[9:59] you know we have two options
[10:02] ugly and uglier
[10:04] limited and more limited
[10:07] you know and sometimes
[10:09] we forget
[10:10] we allow ourselves to believe that we
[10:12] have to choose between those two limited
[10:15] options
[10:16] but we have an example in the scripture
[10:19] that there's one that can set us
[10:21] in a large place
[10:25] you know when the lord was dealing with
[10:26] the children of israel
[10:29] he often referred to the land of promise
[10:32] as
[10:33] a large land a large place
[10:36] just to give you an example in exodus 3
[10:38] 8 as
[10:40] god is speaking to moses and giving him
[10:42] his commission
[10:45] the lord says this i am come down to
[10:47] deliver them out of the hand of the
[10:49] egyptians
[10:50] and to bring them up out of that land
[10:54] into a good land and a large
[10:58] a land flowing with milk and honey
[11:02] the very work of the lord
[11:05] was to
[11:07] take this people out of one land
[11:09] a land of
[11:11] limited options
[11:13] it was a land where you built treasure
[11:14] cities for pharaoh or you starved
[11:18] to a
[11:20] large land
[11:21] where there were more options than that
[11:24] where there was any option
[11:27] available to them
[11:30] not just option a or b
[11:33] but unlimited options
[11:36] i love the way that the tribe of dan
[11:39] speaks of this large land
[11:42] when they
[11:44] are making a claim on their inheritance
[11:46] in judges chapter 18
[11:49] you know as they move to
[11:51] 1810 if you want to look it up but as
[11:53] they move to lay hold of what was
[11:55] committed to them by promise
[11:57] you know and they're encouraging one
[11:59] another they make this statement
[12:01] when ye go
[12:03] ye shall come into a people secure
[12:06] into a large land
[12:09] for god hath given it into your hands
[12:13] a place
[12:15] where there is no want
[12:17] of anything that is in the earth
[12:22] you want a scriptural definition of what
[12:24] a large place is
[12:27] it's a place
[12:29] where there is no want of anything
[12:32] in the earth
[12:34] or it could be said another way
[12:37] all things are possible
[12:41] in a large place
[12:44] you know first chronicles 4 10 is maybe
[12:46] a familiar scripture
[12:48] to some of you there was a period of
[12:50] time where it was very popular out in
[12:52] nominal christianity but it's about the
[12:54] prayer of jabez
[12:56] it was a book written about it and just
[12:58] some random guy
[13:00] just some guy
[13:02] and
[13:04] you know i want to highlight one thing
[13:05] about this large place as we read the
[13:08] prayer of jabez in first chronicles 4
[13:10] 10.
[13:13] it says and jabez called on the god of
[13:15] israel saying o that thou wouldest bless
[13:18] me indeed. and enlarge
[13:22] my coast
[13:24] and that then a hand might be with me
[13:26] and that thou would keep me from evil
[13:28] that it may not grieve me
[13:30] and the lord granted him
[13:32] that which he requested
[13:36] notice among all the things that jabez
[13:38] prayed for
[13:40] he prayed that the lord would enlarge
[13:43] his coasts
[13:46] would make his room make his space
[13:49] larger
[13:51] and the lord granted him that request
[13:55] why
[13:56] because it was in accordance to the word
[14:00] you know as the lord was leading the
[14:01] children of israel into the promised
[14:03] land
[14:05] several times he referred to the
[14:06] statement enlarging their borders
[14:09] you can look it up it's in exodus 34 24
[14:12] deuteronomy 12 20 deuteronomy 19 8 all
[14:15] of them examples of enlarging their
[14:17] borders
[14:20] the children of israel were each given
[14:22] an inheritance in the land
[14:24] but we read in joshua 13 that though
[14:26] everyone got an inheritance there was a
[14:29] lot that was left unclaimed
[14:31] right
[14:35] you know and as far as we know
[14:38] jabez is the only one
[14:40] who prayed and asked that the lord would
[14:42] enlarge what he had
[14:45] take the options he was given
[14:47] and make them greater
[14:49] make them more
[14:51] enlarge
[14:52] his coasts
[14:55] and the lord granted him his request
[14:58] all that stood between
[15:01] the children of israel
[15:03] accepting what they were given as
[15:05] options
[15:06] and enlarging their coasts
[15:09] was asking for it
[15:11] that's it
[15:13] you know how many times do we find
[15:15] ourselves in situations where
[15:17] we have a difficult decision to make
[15:19] it's either option a or option b
[15:22] how many times do we pray that the lord
[15:24] just gives us more options
[15:27] enlarge our coasts
[15:29] enlarge our borders
[15:31] all things are possible
[15:33] when you're caught between the armies of
[15:35] egypt
[15:36] and the red sea
[15:39] you know
[15:40] that the lord would open a third door
[15:43] or a fourth option
[15:45] or a fifth
[15:47] a large place
[15:49] where you're not limited to just a few
[15:52] but where any option
[15:54] is available
[15:56] to you all things
[15:58] are possible
[15:59] so as we read that
[16:01] this morning
[16:02] you know i hope each of us can remember
[16:03] i hope i can remember that
[16:05] you're not necessarily limited to the
[16:07] two options you have in front of you
[16:10] there's one who can put you in a large
[16:12] place
[16:13] where any option
[16:14] no limit
[16:16] all things are possible
[16:17] if you can only believe
[16:19] so as we read psalm 118 this morning
[16:21] that's what stuck out to me i hope it
[16:23] was a blessing to you
[16:25] but we'll read that together
[16:28] oh give thanks sent to the lord for he
[16:30] is good because his mercy endureth
[16:33] forever
[16:34] let israel now say that his mercy
[16:37] endureth forever
[16:39] let the house of aaron now say that his
[16:41] mercy endureth forever
[16:44] let them now that fear the lord say that
[16:46] his mercy endureth forever
[16:49] i called upon the lord in distress the
[16:52] lord answered me and set me in a large
[16:54] place
[16:55] the lord is on my side i will not fear
[16:59] what can man do unto me
[17:01] the lord taketh my part with them that
[17:03] help me therefore shall i see my desire
[17:07] upon them that hate me
[17:09] it is better to trust in the lord than
[17:11] to put confidence in man
[17:13] it is better to trust in the lord than
[17:15] to put confidence in princess all
[17:18] nations compass me about but in the name
[17:21] of the lord will i destroy them they
[17:23] compass me about yea they compass me
[17:26] about but in the name of the lord i will
[17:28] destroy them they can pass me about like
[17:31] bees they are quenched as the fire of
[17:34] thorns for in the name of the lord i
[17:36] will destroy them
[17:38] thou hast thrust sore at me that i might
[17:40] fall but the lord helped me
[17:43] the lord is my strength and song and has
[17:45] become my salvation
[17:47] the voice of rejoicing and salvation is
[17:50] in the tabernacles of the righteous the
[17:53] right hand of the lord doeth valiantly
[17:55] the right hand of the lord is exalted
[17:58] the right hand of the lord doeth
[18:00] valiantly i shall not die but live and
[18:03] declare the works of the lord the lord
[18:06] hath chastened me sore but he hath not
[18:08] given me over unto death
[18:11] open to me the gates of righteousness i
[18:14] will go into them and i will praise the
[18:16] lord
[18:17] this gate of the lord into which the
[18:19] righteous shall enter
[18:21] i will praise thee for thou hast heard
[18:23] me and art become my salvation the stone
[18:26] which the builders refused has become
[18:29] the headstone of the corner
[18:31] this is the lord's doing it is marvelous
[18:34] in our eyes
[18:35] this is the day which the lord hath made
[18:38] we will rejoice and be glad in it

[57:03] 16
[57:06] how's everybody feeling
[57:09] praise god
[57:14] i'm going to read the first six verses
[57:16] here it says observe the month of abib
[57:18] and keep the passover unto the lord thy
[57:21] god
[57:22] for in the month of abid the lord thy
[57:24] god brought thee out of egypt by night
[57:29] thou shalt sacr thou shalt therefore
[57:31] sacrifice the passover
[57:34] unto the lord thy god of the flock and
[57:37] the herd
[57:38] in the place
[57:40] which the lord shall choose
[57:43] to place
[57:45] his name there now notice the emphasis
[57:47] there
[57:48] in the place which the lord shall choose
[57:50] to place his name there thou shalt eat
[57:53] no leavened bread within it
[57:56] seven days shalt thou eat unleavened
[57:59] bread
[58:01] therewith even the bread of affliction
[58:03] for thou that thou mayest remember the
[58:05] day when thou came us forth out of the
[58:08] land of egypt all the days of our life
[58:10] and we know that seven days of
[58:12] unleavened bread is a type of the seven
[58:14] church ages and he says that there shall
[58:16] be no leavened bread seen with thee in
[58:18] all thy coast seven days
[58:20] neither shall there any thing of the
[58:22] flesh which thou sacrifices the first
[58:24] day and even remain all night until the
[58:26] morning thou mayest not sacrifice
[58:29] the passover with any of thy gates which
[58:33] the lord god give thee now notice this
[58:35] thou mayest not sacrifice the passover
[58:38] with any of thy gates which the lord god
[58:40] giveth thee but
[58:42] at the place
[58:44] which the lord thy god shall choose to
[58:47] place his name
[58:49] there thou shalt sacrifice the passover
[58:52] at even
[58:53] at the going down of the sun at the
[58:56] season
[58:57] that thou came us forth
[58:59] out of egypt amen heavenly father we
[59:02] just approach you now at the reading of
[59:05] your word
[59:06] we commit ourselves and this
[59:08] congregation into thy hands lord
[59:10] that you would just come and break the
[59:12] bread of life as only you can speak to
[59:14] your children anoint our lips
[59:16] anoint the ears lord that they would
[59:19] hear from you i pray
[59:20] in jesus christ's name
[59:22] we ask it amen you may have your seats
[59:26] and just in uh
[59:28] the lord placed a little
[59:29] a thought upon my heart and
[59:32] as i just went to
[59:34] um
[59:35] find the direction and the leading of
[59:37] the lord when god might speak to my
[59:39] heart a certain many times he he might
[59:41] deal with ministers different and many
[59:44] times he'll deal with myself in
[59:45] different ways uh something that'll be
[59:48] quickened to me or sometimes it'll just
[59:50] be a a thought that he speaks to my
[59:52] heart and as i start to meditate upon
[59:54] that i like i like to look into the
[59:56] message and find uh a message that would
[59:59] that that could be a foundation or
[1:00:01] something that i can draw from and so as
[1:00:04] i was uh
[1:00:05] looking into this thought uh the lord
[1:00:07] brought me to the message god's provided
[1:00:10] place of worship
[1:00:12] and the prophet of god would preach this
[1:00:13] in 1965 november 28th
[1:00:17] and i tell you god knows how to
[1:00:18] encourage you
[1:00:20] um you know uh uh i i just um as our
[1:00:23] pastor um
[1:00:25] was was leaving out of town i was i was
[1:00:28] struck in my body and i went to the
[1:00:30] doctor and and they had diagnosed me
[1:00:33] with a sickness and i wasn't feeling
[1:00:35] good and and my voice was was
[1:00:38] my throat and everything was just kind
[1:00:39] of of heaping up against me and and i
[1:00:42] thought to myself well
[1:00:44] i don't i'm not going to tell the pastor
[1:00:47] you know i don't i want him to be able
[1:00:49] to go in his joy's trip and i just want
[1:00:51] to depend on god so we asked
[1:00:53] some of the brothers to pray for us and
[1:00:55] and as i started to look into this
[1:00:56] service and i started reading it
[1:00:58] i noticed i'm like you know what this is
[1:01:00] this is the same day today is the same
[1:01:02] day that the prophet preached this
[1:01:04] message 56 years ago and and i you know
[1:01:06] you like things like that it encourages
[1:01:08] you and i say god knows how to encourage
[1:01:10] you and i started to to read it and and
[1:01:12] as i started to read it the prophet said
[1:01:14] i'm a little bit hoarse so bear with me
[1:01:16] if you will in speaking you know there's
[1:01:18] little things like that we're believers
[1:01:20] right
[1:01:21] i'm thankful that we just don't have to
[1:01:23] believe things are by chance you know
[1:01:25] but but we're people of god that that we
[1:01:27] can believe that you know god is
[1:01:29] speaking god is moving and little things
[1:01:31] like this mean something to us you know
[1:01:34] so so i was encouraged i thought well
[1:01:36] you know what i can say the same thing
[1:01:37] and and i thought if if the prophet
[1:01:39] stood on this same day 56 years ago and
[1:01:42] said bear with me my my voice is a
[1:01:44] little hoarse i'm in good company so
[1:01:47] bear with me a little bit uh my voice
[1:01:49] might might be a little hoarse but um
[1:01:52] we uh we just want to deliver uh god's
[1:01:55] message to you
[1:01:57] and so i just thought it would be um
[1:01:59] fitting to
[1:02:01] open uh
[1:02:02] and reading the the prayer that the
[1:02:04] prophet would
[1:02:06] um
[1:02:08] say right before going into this service
[1:02:10] and and i do want to say uh that i'm not
[1:02:13] trying to um
[1:02:16] this is a wonderful message and i
[1:02:17] actually believe the one that brother
[1:02:19] branham preached in april
[1:02:21] the 25th will be the next service that
[1:02:24] our pastor is going into
[1:02:26] and i'm really looking forward to that
[1:02:27] because it's just so packed and it's so
[1:02:30] unending and and we're not
[1:02:32] necessarily trying to to gather from
[1:02:35] this whole message but just take a a
[1:02:37] quote here or there to support the
[1:02:38] thought that that god had dropped on my
[1:02:40] heart but i did think that this a prayer
[1:02:43] at the very beginning was fitting and
[1:02:46] just to read it now is maybe in your own
[1:02:48] heart you'll pray as we read it he says
[1:02:50] be real sincere now
[1:02:52] we're approaching the word of god which
[1:02:55] is god in letter form
[1:02:57] he says great author of this book
[1:03:05] bear with me
[1:03:07] we're a little hoarse
[1:03:12] might be a little struggle this morning
[1:03:14] but hey god is more than able
[1:03:17] i might need to keep a water bottle in
[1:03:19] hand
[1:03:21] great author of this book
[1:03:24] it's a seed we are taught that a sower
[1:03:28] sowed so said the author now we do
[1:03:32] realize that a seed will grow
[1:03:35] if it's in the right kind of ground
[1:03:38] so father will you this morning
[1:03:42] take all the briars and thistles
[1:03:44] and unbelief
[1:03:46] and skeptic thoughts out of our hearts
[1:03:50] that the word of god might
[1:03:53] grow freely
[1:03:56] watered by the spirit in our hearts
[1:03:59] that we might become the people of god
[1:04:02] granite father
[1:04:05] that's our hearts
[1:04:07] not only do we have recognized this but
[1:04:10] may there be others throughout the
[1:04:12] country
[1:04:14] each one the heart burning with love and
[1:04:16] tenderness
[1:04:18] will go to try to win the lost brother
[1:04:20] the lost sister
[1:04:22] grant it today god
[1:04:24] we're looking holy to you
[1:04:27] for you are our guide and our lord so we
[1:04:30] pray that you'll direct us in your word
[1:04:32] today
[1:04:33] and give us of thy blessing
[1:04:36] through thy grace
[1:04:38] and in thy name we ask it
[1:04:40] amen isn't that a wonderful prayer i
[1:04:43] believe i'll try to switch to a handheld
[1:04:45] that
[1:04:47] give me a little bit more
[1:04:48] control and
[1:04:50] maybe we can take it away if we have to
[1:04:52] cough but i just thought that was so
[1:04:54] neat there he he says take all the
[1:04:56] briars and thistles and unbelief
[1:04:59] and skeptic thoughts out of a heart that
[1:05:02] that the word of god might grow freely
[1:05:05] and be watered by the spirit in our
[1:05:08] hearts and i say you know that's where
[1:05:10] the seed
[1:05:11] takes hold it's in the good ground is
[1:05:13] there any good ground here this morning
[1:05:16] that's where the seed of god and you're
[1:05:17] not good ground by your own choosing or
[1:05:19] your own ability but god has
[1:05:21] predestinated you to be the good ground
[1:05:24] this morning that the seed of the word
[1:05:26] would take root in and it would start to
[1:05:28] grow and it would start to manifest and
[1:05:31] so we're praying that god would take out
[1:05:33] all the briars and all of the thistles
[1:05:35] and all of the unbelief lord any of the
[1:05:37] the skeptic thoughts that would be in
[1:05:39] your heart my i don't want to be playing
[1:05:41] church this morning but maybe we can
[1:05:43] move past uh the person that's sitting
[1:05:45] next to us and we can move past the
[1:05:47] building and maybe we can move past the
[1:05:49] things that we're thinking about what
[1:05:50] we're going to do after the service and
[1:05:52] maybe the things that happened on the
[1:05:54] way to service we we know how satan will
[1:05:56] buff it at your flesh and he'll try to
[1:05:58] to distract you and he'll try to come
[1:06:00] against you but i pray that right now
[1:06:02] that every thought can come subject to
[1:06:05] the word of god this morning and that
[1:06:06] the holy ghost can come in his power and
[1:06:08] demonstration and he could speak to a
[1:06:11] people where the seed of god has been

[1:06:15] that are not of god and all the bristles

[1:06:20] keep you from recognizing the presence
[1:06:23] of the lord jesus christ in our midst
[1:06:25] that we would move away from all the
[1:06:27] unbelief and we'd find ourselves sitting

[1:06:31] midst he's present amongst us so we want

[1:09:44] and i'll see what this great sight is
[1:09:47] there moses he came nigh there what did

[1:10:11] where moses was standing holy and i want
[1:10:13] to tell you this morning oh the place
[1:10:16] where you are standing pride of jesus
[1:10:17] christ you are standing on holy ground
[1:10:21] not because of a church building not

[1:10:25] because jesus christ is here in your
[1:10:28] midst you are on holy crown oh why don't
[1:10:32] you just serve him why don't you worship
[1:10:34] him why don't you open up your heart and

[1:10:46] faith that god has put in you by a sixth
[1:10:49] sense that jesus christ is here

[1:12:12] believer this morning
[1:12:14] and i i pray everybody had a good
[1:12:16] thanksgiving
[1:12:18] a lot of times we were able to spend
[1:12:20] time with friends and family and
[1:12:22] you pick a location
[1:12:25] you set a time
[1:12:28] and you show up and that's where
[1:12:29] everything is happening
[1:12:31] oh my the sides and the turkey
[1:12:34] and the cranberry and the stuffing and
[1:12:36] the
[1:12:37] green bean casserole and sweet potatoes

[1:12:42] y'all eat we come from many different
[1:12:45] cultures
[1:12:46] many different countries represented
[1:12:47] among us but it's a thanksgiving time
[1:12:50] it's a great a time of thanksgiving
[1:12:52] where we give thanks
[1:12:54] unto god and you know you have to come
[1:12:56] to that place because that's the place
[1:12:58] where everything is happening many times
[1:13:00] you pick a place in a location where you
[1:13:02] want to settle something or you want to
[1:13:04] do something you know i was kind of
[1:13:06] reminded as i thought on these things i
[1:13:07] remember it being in sixth grade and
[1:13:10] and you know
[1:13:12] i i was this was my first year in the
[1:13:14] school bell manor which is uh just right
[1:13:15] down here uh down the road we currently
[1:13:18] were going to
[1:13:19] um christian temple and uh
[1:13:22] they decided that they didn't need
[1:13:24] anybody of my caliber at their school
[1:13:26] anymore
[1:13:27] my parents were doing the best they
[1:13:28] could to put us
[1:13:29] uh in a in a private school and they had
[1:13:32] elected that it would be beneficial if
[1:13:34] me and my brother since i'm not alone in
[1:13:36] this matter
[1:13:37] didn't return
[1:13:39] and so i found myself in my first year
[1:13:41] it's in sixth grade which was in the way
[1:13:44] they do our school system here that
[1:13:46] would be the last grade they do
[1:13:47] kindergarten through six at the public
[1:13:49] school here and you know i found myself
[1:13:51] coming to this public school and you
[1:13:53] know they didn't have a dress code kind
[1:13:55] of like
[1:13:56] the the the private school did
[1:13:58] i was like you can wear sweatpants to
[1:14:00] school
[1:14:01] i'm like i can wear sweatpants and just
[1:14:03] a little you know a t-shirt and just go
[1:14:05] comfy so you know i kind of like that so
[1:14:07] i started showing up to school you know
[1:14:09] i mean i probably didn't look like the
[1:14:11] best dressed
[1:14:12] i probably probably didn't look like the
[1:14:14] cool kid at school but but you know i
[1:14:16] was comfortable and i was kind of an
[1:14:17] oddball a little bit of a misfit there
[1:14:19] but you know i remembered i was there
[1:14:21] and there was this uh a friend of mine
[1:14:23] named jordan you know we played ball
[1:14:25] together and and we had known him but we
[1:14:27] had gotten into dispute one day
[1:14:30] and the whole the whole class was they
[1:14:31] were kind of watching you know and uh
[1:14:34] words were starting to be exchanged but
[1:14:35] we had a saying around there meet me at
[1:14:38] the flagpole
[1:14:42] when you get to that point and everybody
[1:14:44] hears meet me at the flagpole well
[1:14:45] that's the place where things are going
[1:14:47] down that's the things where things are
[1:14:49] gonna happen you know and so i think
[1:14:51] maybe i got a little excited you know
[1:14:54] and and i said well meet me at the
[1:14:55] flagpole you know and i was just a
[1:14:57] little bitty shrimp
[1:14:58] and jordan he was he was athletic he was
[1:15:01] fast he was bigger than me and and you
[1:15:03] know so the school got out you know and
[1:15:04] i started to think i was like well you
[1:15:06] know what
[1:15:08] it's time to go to the flagpole
[1:15:11] you know what i i remember as i i
[1:15:13] remember in my mind i pray i have it
[1:15:16] right but but i remember i i think i let
[1:15:18] a little bit more time lapse
[1:15:20] but i went there and there you know
[1:15:22] everybody was gone and there was jordan
[1:15:24] he was there at the flagpole and i
[1:15:26] showed up he goes i'm surprised you came
[1:15:29] and i was like well i'm here he's like
[1:15:30] what do you want to do about it i was
[1:15:31] like well you know
[1:15:34] i'm here
[1:15:35] he's like yeah i didn't think you'd show
[1:15:37] up i was like well i didn't know if
[1:15:38] you'd show up either you know what but
[1:15:39] we we ended up doing is we just we shook
[1:15:41] hands and i remember we actually just
[1:15:43] walked home that day and and we were
[1:15:45] friends and i thought you know yeah you
[1:15:47] know meet me at the flagpole and i
[1:15:49] started to think about that you know
[1:15:51] about how we have differences with
[1:15:52] people and and and maybe the in the
[1:15:55] church maybe you have ought in your
[1:15:57] heart for a brother or sister or maybe
[1:15:59] things are are going just like you think
[1:16:02] they should be going and and many times
[1:16:04] if we're not careful we develop an
[1:16:06] attitude or we we we develop a frame of
[1:16:10] thinking of maybe a couple in the way
[1:16:12] that they conduct themselves and maybe
[1:16:14] when they come to church and maybe the
[1:16:16] way that we're dressed and all of a
[1:16:18] sudden we start looking through the eyes
[1:16:20] of a critic and we leave the blood at
[1:16:23] the door and we start to look at
[1:16:24] somebody through eyes that are casting
[1:16:27] judgment and many times we'll find
[1:16:29] ourselves in the devil trying to cause a
[1:16:31] root of bitterness and we'll find
[1:16:33] ourselves in a place if we're not
[1:16:34] careful where we have ought with our
[1:16:36] brother or sister
[1:16:40] but i i thought of this you know what we
[1:16:42] ought to say in our heart
[1:16:44] as in the world as i would be there at
[1:16:46] school and maybe you would be excited
[1:16:47] about something and you say jackson meet
[1:16:49] me at the flagpole everybody knew what
[1:16:52] that meant but i wonder if the bride of
[1:16:55] jesus christ in your heart you could
[1:16:57] look at that brother and that sister and
[1:16:59] say meet me at calvary why don't you you
[1:17:01] meet me at the cross when you come to
[1:17:04] that place when you come to calvary oh
[1:17:07] to think that there was a wounded lamb
[1:17:09] that bled and died for your sins how
[1:17:12] could you come to that place how could
[1:17:14] you hold any animosity how could you
[1:17:16] hold any bitterness how could you hold
[1:17:19] any malice how could you hold any
[1:17:21] judgment how could you look down on your
[1:17:24] brother and sister when a wounded bloody
[1:17:27] lamb that was beaten that was shame that
[1:17:31] is dripping that was wounded was now
[1:17:34] there to that cross to take away all of
[1:17:36] your sins to take away all your brother
[1:17:39] and your sister says oh when was he
[1:17:42] wounded for your transgression before
[1:17:44] you ever committed one sin he was
[1:17:47] bruised before you ever did it why we
[1:17:50] were living in sin but god so loved you
[1:17:53] that he went and paid the price for you
[1:17:55] i wonder if in your heart right now you
[1:17:57] could be repent of and you can say you
[1:18:00] know what i'll meet you at the cross
[1:18:03] it's at the cross where things happen
[1:18:05] it's at the cross it's a place of
[1:18:07] manifestation where you can experience
[1:18:10] the love of god
[1:18:13] oh hallelujah there is a fountain
[1:18:16] filled with blood
[1:18:18] drawn from emmanuel's veins where
[1:18:21] sinners plunge beneath the flood lose
[1:18:24] all their guilty stains oh i tell you if
[1:18:27] i want to meet you anywhere i want to
[1:18:29] meet you at the cross
[1:18:32] let you let me meet you under the shed
[1:18:33] blood of jesus christ
[1:18:36] as we just move into verse six here and
[1:18:38] just kind of continuing through our
[1:18:40] thoughts a little bit
[1:18:49] but at the place which the lord thy god
[1:18:52] shall choose to place his name
[1:18:56] in there notice that now
[1:18:59] but at the place
[1:19:01] which the lord thy god shall choose to
[1:19:03] place his name
[1:19:05] there
[1:19:07] thou shalt sacrifice the passover at
[1:19:10] evening at the going down of the sun at
[1:19:13] the season that thou camest forth
[1:19:16] out of egypt and the prophet would point
[1:19:18] out how you know deuteronomy means two
[1:19:20] laws
[1:19:23] two laws
[1:19:24] you can obey god's word and live
[1:19:28] or you can disobey god's word and die
[1:19:32] and god gave his law
[1:19:34] on mount sinai
[1:19:37] and by that condemned the human race
[1:19:40] because no man was able to fulfill that
[1:19:42] law
[1:19:43] but then god gave another law on mount
[1:19:45] calvary
[1:19:47] i said god gave another law on mount
[1:19:49] calvary that by that law every man can
[1:19:52] live if you're identified with the shed
[1:19:55] blood of jesus christ and i'm so
[1:19:57] thankful this morning that god has a
[1:20:00] provided place for the believer a
[1:20:02] provided place for his word to manifest
[1:20:04] i say that's the place that i want to be
[1:20:06] this morning i want to say that's the
[1:20:08] place where things are happening
[1:20:11] you know i remember being out there in
[1:20:12] the world and
[1:20:14] and uh you know
[1:20:15] you they would they would have these big
[1:20:17] parties and these big scenes and you
[1:20:19] know you would go to it and there'd just
[1:20:20] be all this hoopla and to do and and you
[1:20:22] know that that the you know they'd put a
[1:20:24] lot of money into these things
[1:20:28] but there would come a time where that
[1:20:29] appointed time of that party would come
[1:20:32] to an end
[1:20:33] you know everybody would would have to
[1:20:35] go home but you know there was actually
[1:20:36] something called an after party
[1:20:40] and then if you if you made it to the
[1:20:42] after party maybe you you were thought
[1:20:44] of as somebody
[1:20:45] you know my if you got the invite to the
[1:20:47] after party because the party you know
[1:20:49] that that just hey you know they get
[1:20:51] started 10 11 12 1 2 3
[1:20:54] 4 but my you know there's the after
[1:20:56] party and they set the time and the
[1:20:58] appointed place and and you know so
[1:21:00] because the people don't they don't want
[1:21:01] the music to stop
[1:21:03] they don't want the dancing to stop it
[1:21:05] it's never enough there's this hunger
[1:21:06] and there's this craving and and now
[1:21:08] you've been out there uh uh uh blowing
[1:21:11] your brains away for four hours already
[1:21:13] it's like oh there's an after party
[1:21:15] where are we gonna go and then you go to
[1:21:17] the after party and you know but i want
[1:21:19] to say eventually the music stops and
[1:21:21] the and the dancing stops and you find
[1:21:24] yourself all of a sudden you're empty
[1:21:26] and what are you doing you're just
[1:21:27] looking for the next party you're
[1:21:29] looking for the next high but but maybe
[1:21:32] you can't relate to that maybe you've
[1:21:33] been raised in church and
[1:21:35] maybe you've never got out into the
[1:21:37] things of the world and by god's grace
[1:21:39] that is true but i want to say that
[1:21:41] maybe you can't relate to to being out
[1:21:43] in the world and looking for the next
[1:21:45] event and looking for the next venue and
[1:21:47] looking for the next rush and looking
[1:21:48] for the next high and looking for the
[1:21:50] next thing that'll that'll that'll lift
[1:21:52] you up and and looking for the next
[1:21:54] excitement only to be let back down and
[1:21:56] and then it sounds like you go higher
[1:21:58] and then you go even lower you go even
[1:21:59] higher you're going even lower and you
[1:22:01] just feel like you're constantly craving
[1:22:03] you're constantly seeking there's
[1:22:05] something you're trying to fill a void
[1:22:06] inside and maybe you can't relate to
[1:22:08] that but maybe you've been certain that
[1:22:10] sitting in a church pew and you go from
[1:22:12] church service to church service and you
[1:22:15] go from camp to camp and when the music
[1:22:17] stops at camp when the dancing stops in
[1:22:19] the church service when the preacher
[1:22:21] stops in the pre-and then the church
[1:22:22] house when the music stops at the end of
[1:22:24] service and you go out the door and you
[1:22:26] go back to living your own life that
[1:22:28] doesn't stop
[1:22:31] because you find yourself when you're
[1:22:33] together with god's people and you're in
[1:22:35] the house of god and maybe in your camp
[1:22:37] and the cat means you feel like that's
[1:22:38] where everything is happening
[1:22:43] that's where the music is that's where
[1:22:44] the atmosphere is
[1:22:47] but i want to invite you this morning
[1:22:51] i want to invite you this morning to
[1:22:52] come to calvary
[1:22:54] i want to invite you this morning to be
[1:22:55] identified with your sacrifice
[1:22:59] that your sins might be forgiven
[1:23:03] revelations 3 19 would say as many as i
[1:23:06] love i rebuke and chasten be zealous
[1:23:09] therefore and repent i say there ought
[1:23:11] to be a zealous repenting in the house
[1:23:14] of god this morning for our sins and for
[1:23:17] our iniquity for the lust of the flesh
[1:23:20] the lust of the eye and the pride of
[1:23:22] life oh we get so lifted up as if we
[1:23:25] have no sin but if you say that you have
[1:23:28] no sin you are a liar and you will
[1:23:30] remain in your sin and you are blind but
[1:23:33] if you recognize that you are a sinner
[1:23:36] and that you need the grace of god and
[1:23:38] you need to be identified with a
[1:23:40] sacrifice that was nailed to calvary and
[1:23:43] you'll be zealous this morning and you
[1:23:45] repent for your evil deeds you'll repent
[1:23:48] for your iniquity and you'll ask god to
[1:23:50] come oh hallelujah
[1:23:53] oh you say brother matthew you don't
[1:23:54] know my past
[1:23:57] if you knew what i've done and where
[1:23:58] i've been
[1:24:00] if you knew the condition i was in well
[1:24:03] i'm glad you mentioned it
[1:24:06] i'm glad you you mentioned it you know
[1:24:08] that the devil's trying to pour it on
[1:24:10] you right now
[1:24:11] but i want to ask you is there anything
[1:24:13] too hard for god
[1:24:15] is there anything
[1:24:18] too hard for god
[1:24:22] for
[1:24:23] we are living in the hour
[1:24:26] of great trial
[1:24:29] we're living in a great hour of
[1:24:30] suffering
[1:24:32] well we're living in an hour where the
[1:24:34] world is pressing in all around us
[1:24:37] but ii timothy 2 12 would say if we
[1:24:39] suffer
[1:24:41] we shall also reign with him
[1:24:46] if we deny him
[1:24:48] he also will deny us
[1:24:51] if we believe not yet
[1:24:53] he abideth faithful he cannot deny
[1:24:57] himself i'm so thankful
[1:24:59] that there is a part of god
[1:25:01] that is on the inside of me that when i
[1:25:04] had denied him when i had walked away
[1:25:07] from him there was a predestinated seed
[1:25:09] that was part of him and he could look
[1:25:12] past my condition he could look past my
[1:25:14] sin and he would say though you've
[1:25:16] walked away son though you're living in
[1:25:19] sin there is a part of myself that i
[1:25:22] have placed in you by the wedding band
[1:25:24] of predestination and i cannot deny
[1:25:28] myself no matter what you've done no
[1:25:31] matter how far you've gone no matter how
[1:25:34] lost you feel you are i don't care what
[1:25:36] you've done you are a son you are a
[1:25:39] daughter of almighty god and satan is
[1:25:42] out to sift you like we but jesus has
[1:25:45] prayed for you and he had your name put
[1:25:47] on the lamb's book of life before the
[1:25:49] foundation of the world and you are part
[1:25:52] of jesus christ there is a portion of
[1:25:54] you that god cannot deny
[1:25:59] oh
[1:26:00] hallelujah
[1:26:02] oh we just need to come to that place
[1:26:05] of a repenting heart
[1:26:09] but we go through trials we go through
[1:26:11] sufferings
[1:26:14] you know believers are always put to the
[1:26:15] test
[1:26:18] every son that cometh to god
[1:26:21] must be tested
[1:26:23] must be chasing must be child trained
[1:26:27] now i want you to think about this a
[1:26:28] little bit because we're many of us are
[1:26:30] in different stages of our life and and
[1:26:32] i i tell you for us that i've been at it
[1:26:34] a little bit a while we need to be
[1:26:36] careful that pride doesn't uh puff us up
[1:26:39] and we start to think we're somebody
[1:26:41] because you know you look at abraham
[1:26:44] abraham in genesis 12 god had called him
[1:26:47] and said hey get the out of my country
[1:26:49] i'll show thee a place that i've given
[1:26:51] unto you
[1:26:54] his name was abram
[1:26:56] he comes out
[1:26:58] you'll be a father of many nations he
[1:26:59] shows them the land
[1:27:01] he changes his name
[1:27:04] he changes his body
[1:27:07] he gives them the promised son
[1:27:11] but then we find out in our bible here
[1:27:14] that in genesis chapter 22 verse 1
[1:27:17] it says and it came to pass after these
[1:27:19] things that god did tempt abraham
[1:27:22] so here abraham he is he has been
[1:27:25] walking and believing god by faith so
[1:27:27] much so that he's his name has been
[1:27:29] changed he's actually met god and and
[1:27:32] he's his body has been changed
[1:27:36] they've actually received the promised
[1:27:38] son
[1:27:39] but you find that abraham even in this
[1:27:42] place in his walk with god
[1:27:45] that god is going to tempt he's going to
[1:27:48] test abraham
[1:27:50] you would wonder in yourself why would
[1:27:52] god be doing this here's a mature a son
[1:27:55] of god who stood the test who stood the
[1:27:58] trial he stood the adversity he stood
[1:28:01] the markers and the scorners and he
[1:28:03] believed there being his wife being
[1:28:05] barren and there being no life within
[1:28:08] him he stood there upon the promised
[1:28:10] lord saying i know that we're going to
[1:28:12] have a baby and he stood there by faith
[1:28:14] and god rewarded his faith and there he
[1:28:17] changed his body he received the
[1:28:19] promised son and now
[1:28:22] does that mean it's all over
[1:28:26] no
[1:28:28] no every every believer is tested
[1:28:32] because there's an attribute
[1:28:34] there's a quality
[1:28:36] there's a word
[1:28:38] there's a life that god has placed in
[1:28:40] you and there is a purpose of the father
[1:28:44] to bring that into manifestation
[1:28:46] and he says and it came to pass after
[1:28:48] these things that god did tipped abraham
[1:28:51] and said to him abraham and he said
[1:28:53] behold here i am
[1:28:56] he said take now thy son thy only son
[1:28:59] isaac whom thou lovest
[1:29:02] and get thee into the land of mori and
[1:29:04] offer him there for a burnt offering
[1:29:07] upon one of the mountains which i will
[1:29:10] tell thee of so now god has called
[1:29:12] abraham and he's saying look there's a
[1:29:14] there's a specific place
[1:29:16] that i want to take your son your only
[1:29:19] son that you love us and there's a place
[1:29:21] that i want you to take them and
[1:29:23] actually offer him up for a sacrifice
[1:29:26] get you up into the mountains and i'll
[1:29:28] show you where that place is
[1:29:31] see there was a place
[1:29:33] that was ordained for abraham to meet
[1:29:35] god and take him at his word and you
[1:29:37] just think about this what was happening
[1:29:40] you say that brother matthew what are
[1:29:41] you what are you what are you wanting to
[1:29:42] point out i want to say that god was
[1:29:45] proving his word through abraham
[1:29:49] god was proving his word through abraham
[1:29:54] now and i think about it when satan came
[1:29:56] up before god
[1:29:59] and he said what have you been up to
[1:30:00] i've been going to and fro through the
[1:30:02] earth
[1:30:03] and i'm seeking like a lion whom i might
[1:30:05] devour
[1:30:06] and what does god do he says have you
[1:30:08] considered my servant job
[1:30:12] well you know if i was sitting on the
[1:30:13] sideline and i happened to be job i'd be
[1:30:15] like wait a second
[1:30:17] hold him
[1:30:18] up you know i've been things have been
[1:30:21] going okay
[1:30:23] but you see god said have you considered
[1:30:25] my servant job and what did he say
[1:30:29] he said there is none like him
[1:30:32] an upright man
[1:30:35] perfect in his generation
[1:30:38] and what did he do he left the trials he
[1:30:41] let the adversity come because it was in
[1:30:43] the trials it was in that adversity that
[1:30:47] there was a there was a part of god that
[1:30:50] was in job
[1:30:51] look it wasn't abraham holding on
[1:30:54] it was god in abraham holding on it
[1:30:57] wasn't god in job holding and it wasn't
[1:31:00] job holding on it was god in job that
[1:31:04] was holding on so when he said have you
[1:31:06] considered my servant job watch what he
[1:31:09] said
[1:31:10] now listen he said he is he is a perfect
[1:31:13] man
[1:31:14] he's he said have you considered there's
[1:31:16] none like him
[1:31:18] well god's not a liar
[1:31:21] i said god is not a liar when he says
[1:31:23] something he means and so when he said
[1:31:26] have you considered my servant job there
[1:31:29] is none like him in all the earth he is
[1:31:31] a perfect man and he's upright in his
[1:31:33] generation that was the word of god so
[1:31:36] no matter what satan could throw at job
[1:31:39] there was nothing that could destroy the
[1:31:42] word of god nothing could change what
[1:31:45] the judge had already spoken regardless
[1:31:48] of what job did
[1:31:51] regardless of his faults regardless of
[1:31:53] his failures the king of kings the lord
[1:31:56] of lords god almighty had already spoken
[1:32:00] have you considered my servant job a
[1:32:04] perfect man there is none like him
[1:32:09] oh i got some good news for you did you
[1:32:12] know he's already spoken on your behalf
[1:32:15] he's already spoken i want to tell you
[1:32:18] here in satan's eden
[1:32:20] oh he's come before the father and he
[1:32:22] says what have you been up to building
[1:32:24] your satan's eden and your kingdom and
[1:32:27] all this nonsense and tommy rock and
[1:32:29] hate and evil and your kingdom that's
[1:32:31] what you've been building what have you
[1:32:33] been doing and he could look at that
[1:32:35] devil say have you considered my bride
[1:32:38] [Applause]
[1:32:39] there is none like her
[1:32:42] she is perfect she is upright in her
[1:32:45] generation no matter what you throw at
[1:32:48] her no matter what you do she will not
[1:32:51] deny me she will not back down she will
[1:32:54] not stand down why because i have spoken
[1:32:57] on her behalf she is perfect
[1:33:02] oh hallelujah
[1:33:04] what did the prophet of god say in the
[1:33:06] god of this eagle age he said the
[1:33:08] purpose of this evil age is to prove to
[1:33:11] satan come on somebody he said the
[1:33:14] purpose of lady isaiah and the
[1:33:16] wickedness that you see around is to
[1:33:19] prove to satan that you're not like that
[1:33:21] eve
[1:33:22] you're not going to go spoil your skirts
[1:33:24] you're not going to go sell yourself to
[1:33:26] unbelief why because you're perfect you
[1:33:29] are the perfect unadulterated bride of
[1:33:32] jesus christ not because of what you
[1:33:34] said not because of what i said but
[1:33:36] because the king of kings the lord of
[1:33:38] glory has descended with an open book in
[1:33:42] our generation and he has called your
[1:33:44] name he said you're sinless you're
[1:33:46] spotless you're my bride you're perfect
[1:33:49] there's none like you in all of the
[1:33:51] earth

[1:33:53] hallelujah
[1:33:54] why don't you praise the lord why don't
[1:33:56] you give him glory god has already
[1:33:59] spoken on your behalf
[1:34:02] oh hallelujah why
[1:34:04] because you are the place
[1:34:06] of the manifestation of the word that
[1:34:09] has been spoken in our generation and
[1:34:11] now it's coming into materialization and
[1:34:14] a people that have gathered themselves
[1:34:16] together under the revealed word of the
[1:34:18] hour
[1:34:20] oh i tell you what yeah i get a little
[1:34:22] excited
[1:34:24] i start to shout a little bit
[1:34:27] i might scream i might stop and i might
[1:34:29] snort but at least i'm snoring for god
[1:34:32] at least i'm snorting for jesus at least
[1:34:34] if i can make a breath if i can make a
[1:34:36] snort if i can make a stop if i can lift
[1:34:39] my hand if i can shout i'm going to do
[1:34:41] it for his glory
[1:34:43] oh and everything you do in word or deed
[1:34:48] do all
[1:34:49] in that name
[1:34:51] the only name the name that's above all
[1:34:54] names
[1:34:55] the name of the lord
[1:34:56] jesus christ the place that he put his
[1:35:00] name
[1:35:01] oh praise the wonderful name of the lord
[1:35:07] what is god doing
[1:35:09] he's proving his word
[1:35:11] in you
[1:35:14] have you considered job
[1:35:16] have you considered abraham
[1:35:18] have you considered my bride
[1:35:21] oh hallelujah because there is a a
[1:35:23] predestinated place
[1:35:25] that god wants to manifest his word and
[1:35:27] that is in the bride of jesus christ
[1:35:31] oh hallelujah i'm not going to give up
[1:35:33] church i'm not going to back down
[1:35:36] why i'm crucified with christ
[1:35:38] nevertheless i live
[1:35:40] yet not i
[1:35:42] but christ that liveth in me
[1:35:46] it's not to him that that runeth
[1:35:48] or to him that will but it's unto him
[1:35:51] that god
[1:35:53] has shown his mercy oh what great mercy
[1:35:56] what great love he has shown unto us in
[1:35:59] this day that we would be called his
[1:36:01] bride
[1:36:02] oh praise his wonderful name
[1:36:04] so here in our our little setting here
[1:36:08] here abraham you know he's passed the
[1:36:11] test
[1:36:14] he's been doing good but god says hey
[1:36:16] abraham
[1:36:18] i got another test for you
[1:36:20] i got another trial
[1:36:22] you know i mean if i was thinking if i
[1:36:24] was abraham i'd be like
[1:36:26] really
[1:36:28] haven't i done pretty good so far
[1:36:31] but god has more that he want to
[1:36:33] manifest in your life
[1:36:35] i don't care where you are at right now
[1:36:38] young people to the youngest to the
[1:36:40] oldest there is more word that god want
[1:36:43] to manifest in your life
[1:36:45] and we could take an example here in the
[1:36:46] scripture now because here god is
[1:36:48] telling abraham who's come through all
[1:36:50] these trials and he's believed and he's
[1:36:52] actually he's actually been with with
[1:36:54] god and his name has been changed and
[1:36:57] he's received a body change he's
[1:36:59] received the promised son and now he say
[1:37:01] hey abraham take your promised son now i
[1:37:04] want you to go into a a prepared place
[1:37:06] that i'm going to meet you the way
[1:37:08] you're going to sacrifice your son i'll
[1:37:10] show you that place so now there he goes
[1:37:13] and here he says in in verse 7 it says
[1:37:15] in isaac
[1:37:16] spake unto abraham his father and said
[1:37:18] my father.
[1:37:20] he said here i am my son he said behold
[1:37:24] the fire and the wood
[1:37:27] but where is the lamb for a burnt
[1:37:28] offering
[1:37:30] daddy we've done this before
[1:37:33] this ain't the first time we've offered
[1:37:35] a sacrifice
[1:37:38] but there's one thing that's missing
[1:37:42] they've been going around and gathering
[1:37:43] all the wood they've been gathering all
[1:37:45] the stones
[1:37:46] there ain't no lamb in sight
[1:37:49] there ain't no sacrifice in sight
[1:37:52] the prophet would dramatize how during
[1:37:54] that time there wouldn't be nothing no
[1:37:56] nothing around on that mountain there's
[1:37:58] no water there at that time i mean
[1:38:00] they've been picking up rocks and
[1:38:01] building fires every little uh living
[1:38:04] creature that had been around them guys
[1:38:05] out there in the wilderness they were
[1:38:06] gone
[1:38:09] and now here isaac is saying hey
[1:38:12] dad
[1:38:14] we got the altar
[1:38:17] we got the wood
[1:38:20] but where is the lamb for a burnt
[1:38:22] offering
[1:38:24] and abraham said my son
[1:38:28] god will provide himself a lamb
[1:38:31] for a burnt offering
[1:38:33] so they went both of them together and
[1:38:35] they came to the place
[1:38:38] which god had told him of
[1:38:41] notice he came to the place
[1:38:43] which god had told him you know many
[1:38:45] times we want to make our own place
[1:38:48] we want to make our own way
[1:38:50] we want to take our reasoning we want to
[1:38:52] take the scriptures and the quotes we
[1:38:54] want to mold it together we want to we
[1:38:55] want to make our career and we want to
[1:38:57] make our decisions we want to make where
[1:38:59] we're going to live and where we're
[1:39:00] going to go and the way we're going to
[1:39:01] do things but you know maybe god has a
[1:39:03] provided place for you maybe god has a
[1:39:06] certain plan and a certain route that he
[1:39:09] wants you to go in life but you keep
[1:39:11] trying to make your own way and you keep
[1:39:13] wondering why it's so hard and every
[1:39:15] door keeps getting shut on you and you
[1:39:16] keep trying to push down the door and
[1:39:18] maybe you fight you push your way in
[1:39:19] there and it only lasts for for a few
[1:39:22] months maybe it'll last for six months
[1:39:24] you find out well that's not where you
[1:39:25] want to be and then you go over here and
[1:39:27] that doesn't work out and these doors
[1:39:28] are constantly closing maybe you ought
[1:39:30] to find out that you're trying to make
[1:39:32] your own way but god has a provided
[1:39:34] place for you that if you would just get
[1:39:37] past your own ideas and get into the
[1:39:39] word of god and start seeking the holy
[1:39:41] spirit to lead you and guide you into
[1:39:43] all truth and all righteousness you'll
[1:39:45] find yourself walking in the perfect
[1:39:48] will of the lord with a liberty to know
[1:39:50] that god is with you he's the one that's
[1:39:52] opening the doors he's the one that's
[1:39:54] closing the doors why because you're
[1:39:56] walking with him and you know that
[1:39:57] you're doing everything that he told you
[1:39:59] according to the word that you can stand
[1:40:01] there like abraham say god i've come to
[1:40:04] the place you told me to come and here i
[1:40:07] am lord i've put the altar up i broaden
[1:40:10] the word lord and i've brought my only
[1:40:12] son and i'm standing now lord
[1:40:17] i'm standing now lord
[1:40:19] waiting for your next command
[1:40:23] with everything he'd believed for
[1:40:27] the very vindication of his faith
[1:40:30] god has wanted him to lay it on the
[1:40:31] altar
[1:40:35] god even reciting back to abraham
[1:40:37] letting abraham know i know
[1:40:39] i know how much this means to you
[1:40:41] abraham
[1:40:42] i know you love isaac
[1:40:45] i know you love me
[1:40:47] take your only son
[1:40:50] and they came to the place which god had
[1:40:51] told him
[1:40:54] and abraham built an altar and laid the
[1:40:56] wooden order
[1:40:57] and bound isaac his son
[1:41:00] and laid him
[1:41:02] on the altar upon the wood
[1:41:05] here abraham
[1:41:08] a father
[1:41:09] of many nations
[1:41:12] here isaac
[1:41:15] the promised son
[1:41:17] maybe if we're to be spectators this
[1:41:19] morning
[1:41:21] you know
[1:41:22] there goes abraham and isaac
[1:41:25] there they are
[1:41:27] they're saying they're hearing god talk
[1:41:28] to them again
[1:41:29] what are they doing this time
[1:41:32] you know the amount of insanity
[1:41:36] think of it now
[1:41:38] this isn't a fairy tale
[1:41:40] this happened
[1:41:44] the same god that's called you the same
[1:41:45] god that has spoken to you
[1:41:48] it's the same god that spoke to abraham
[1:41:50] the same god that provided him his son
[1:41:53] and now he's standing there
[1:41:54] there's isaac laying on the altar and i
[1:41:57] i would think what do you think is going
[1:42:00] through
[1:42:01] isaac's mind
[1:42:03] as he's laying there
[1:42:06] on the altar
[1:42:09] and i was thinking i know that
[1:42:11] isaac being a perfect type of the lamb i
[1:42:14] speculate he didn't even say anything
[1:42:16] but imagine in his mind him saying
[1:42:18] father
[1:42:21] you said god's able
[1:42:23] to provide himself a sacrifice
[1:42:27] said me lord why
[1:42:28] why am i here i i don't understand i
[1:42:31] don't understand the trial i don't
[1:42:32] understand this isn't how i i thought it
[1:42:35] was going to go i
[1:42:36] my daddy told me how you how you met him
[1:42:38] lord you come down and lord how you
[1:42:41] changed his name and you changed his
[1:42:43] body and you brought forth the very
[1:42:45] promised son and i'm i'm i am the very
[1:42:48] manifestation of your promised word lord
[1:42:51] why am i on the altar of sacrifice i
[1:42:53] don't understand lord
[1:42:56] why i'm going through this trial i don't
[1:42:58] understand why i'm going through this
[1:43:00] situation i want you to know it's
[1:43:02] because god is wanting to prove his word
[1:43:05] through you there is a place of
[1:43:07] manifestation that god is wanting to
[1:43:10] show you who he was and it was there in
[1:43:13] that place of impossibility it was there
[1:43:16] in that hour of despair it was that
[1:43:18] place of manifestation if i could say it
[1:43:21] like this it was in that place of
[1:43:23] revelation
[1:43:24] that all of a sudden abraham had reached
[1:43:26] back his hand and he was going through
[1:43:29] with the camp commandment of the lord
[1:43:31] and he said abraham stay thy hand
[1:43:36] oh and there as abraham oh he was being
[1:43:40] obedient to the word of god he'd come to
[1:43:42] the place that god had showed him he was
[1:43:44] going through with the word of god and
[1:43:46] there he took his hand back to to follow
[1:43:50] through on the commandment of god he
[1:43:52] said abraham
[1:43:55] oh if god would have waited one more
[1:43:57] second
[1:43:59] if god would have made it five more
[1:44:01] seconds but i want to tell you god is
[1:44:03] always on time
[1:44:05] he's right on time in your hour of
[1:44:07] despair and your hour of calamity i
[1:44:10] don't care what it is it was in that
[1:44:12] place of manifestation that abraham knew
[1:44:15] him as jehovah jairo my provider god is
[1:44:20] more than able to provide you a
[1:44:22] sacrifice this morning no matter what
[1:44:24] you're going through no matter what your
[1:44:26] trial is i want to tell you he's still
[1:44:28] jehovah jireh what are you talking about
[1:44:31] brother matthew the same jehovah jireh
[1:44:33] that provided abraham a ram is the same
[1:44:37] jehovah gyre that spoke squirrels into
[1:44:39] existence it's the same jehovah joy that
[1:44:42] descended with an open book in hand and
[1:44:45] called your name by the spoken word of
[1:44:47] god it's the same jehovah chirag that is
[1:44:50] here this morning jehovah chara speaking
[1:44:54] words of life into the pride of jesus
[1:44:56] christ that you are an invincible army

[1:46:11] sacrifice
[1:46:12] not the part
[1:46:14] of being
[1:46:16] a type of christ
[1:46:18] but i can identify with a part of being

[1:46:23] and laid on an altar to die there in my
[1:46:26] sin and if it wasn't effective god oh

[1:46:41] of the world and i was tied up oh i was
[1:46:43] going to die it just seemed like at no
[1:46:46] time that sin and the penalty of sin was
[1:46:49] going to come down and take my life but
[1:46:52] jehovah jireh he said i am gone i have
[1:46:55] provided a sacrifice you don't have to

[1:49:18] to provide himself a sacrifice
[1:49:22] the only thing i know to do there's two
[1:49:23] laws

[1:49:27] and if i disobey him it's death anyways
[1:49:30] did you hear me
[1:49:31] you're so worried about preserving
[1:49:33] yourself

[1:49:35] job you're so worried about trying to
[1:49:37] preserve your relationships
[1:49:40] i'm talking to somebody now
[1:49:42] but if you hear what god is telling you
[1:49:44] to disobey the word is death anyways
[1:49:50] but to obey him is life
[1:49:52] here there was two laws
[1:49:54] that was set before abraham
[1:49:56] the law of disobeying the word and
[1:50:00] certain death
[1:50:01] come into the household or the law of
[1:50:04] life and the prophet of god said
[1:50:07] oh hallelujah he would pick that up and
[1:50:09] say when when he came to mary and martha
[1:50:12] he would say to themself oh jesus if you
[1:50:15] would have been here
[1:50:17] if you would have been here my brother
[1:50:19] lazarus wouldn't have died

[1:51:32] resurrection and she approached him with
[1:51:34] sweetness and humility
[1:51:37] said yes lord
[1:51:39] and when she had that right approach to
[1:51:41] him
[1:51:42] when she had that right respect unto the
[1:51:44] word
[1:51:46] that's when he said where'd you lay him
[1:51:50] the prophet of god said things were
[1:51:51] ready to spark then
[1:51:53] things were set in order it was nothing
[1:51:55] but drama then where'd you lay them
[1:51:57] i am the resurrection where's the place
[1:52:00] of manifestation that i'm going to call
[1:52:03] forth the dead and they're going to be
[1:52:04] made living where is the place of
[1:52:06] manifestation i am the resurrection the
[1:52:09] i am the resurrection is standing here
[1:52:12] this morning and his voice is going
[1:52:14] forth to call those which were dead unto
[1:52:17] life you were in dead denomination and
[1:52:20] dead unbelief in his word you were dead
[1:52:23] in sins and trespasses but god oh
[1:52:26] hallelujah by the divine promise have
[1:52:29] manifested his word in the end time and
[1:52:31] the voice of the seventh angel which was
[1:52:34] none other than the mighty angel coming
[1:52:36] down and putting one foot on the land
[1:52:38] and one foot on the sea i am the bread
[1:52:41] of life that cometh down out of heaven
[1:52:43] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:52:46] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:52:48] mouth of god this is the shout of

[1:52:56] a shout what is the shout oh it's the
[1:52:58] bread of life i am the bread that cometh

[1:53:18] your sin come out of your unbelief come
[1:53:21] out of your complexes
[1:53:25] oh does somebody identify
[1:53:28] with the word of the hour
[1:53:31] oh praise his wonderful name
[1:53:33] jehovah jireh my provider
[1:53:36] oh my praise his name
[1:53:39] hallelujah
[1:53:40] look you ain't got to go looking for it
[1:53:42] somewhere out there
[1:53:44] i'll start running around and
[1:53:46] trying to find
[1:53:47] something more
[1:53:48] everything you have need of is right
[1:53:50] here this morning
[1:53:52] jesus christ is here do you believe it
[1:53:56] jesus christ is here
[1:54:00] by faith
[1:54:01] he's just as here as if the prophet was
[1:54:04] here
[1:54:05] or what do you need to see a corporal
[1:54:06] body
[1:54:09] that's not how you see him
[1:54:12] because the word was made flesh and
[1:54:15] stood there in front of the sadducees
[1:54:18] and pharisees and they were blind
[1:54:23] oh but if you can just surrender to the
[1:54:25] law of faith
[1:54:26] and reach out and touch the lord
[1:54:29] oh praise the lord
[1:54:39] we'll just continue on by his grace
[1:54:43] so in the second verse here he says thou
[1:54:45] shalt therefore
[1:54:47] sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy
[1:54:49] god
[1:54:50] of the flocks of thy heard in the place
[1:54:52] which the lord shall choose to put his
[1:54:54] name there
[1:54:55] he says now you you can't you your
[1:54:58] sincerity and all that you want to
[1:54:59] confess
[1:55:00] you just can't take it to a methodist
[1:55:02] altar to a baptist author or to a
[1:55:04] pentecostal altar but there is an altar
[1:55:07] somewhere that he has chose to put his
[1:55:09] name in it
[1:55:11] and he would meet you in that place
[1:55:13] now if you get everything running just
[1:55:15] right it's going to run everything's set
[1:55:17] in order if there's a short in that wire
[1:55:20] the light won't come on because it's
[1:55:22] been grounded and then when you take one
[1:55:24] of god's word
[1:55:25] or on on one of his places and in your
[1:55:28] heart have selfish motives it'll ground
[1:55:30] the power of god right there
[1:55:32] you're the prophet now
[1:55:35] if you have your own if your own heart
[1:55:37] have selfish motives it'll ground the
[1:55:39] power of god right there
[1:55:42] if you do it it's because you want to be
[1:55:43] smart you want to be different from
[1:55:45] somebody else or something
[1:55:47] right there it's grounded it'll blow the
[1:55:50] fuse you're wrong you've got to come
[1:55:52] with sincerity with all your heart your
[1:55:54] motives and your objectives placed right
[1:55:56] on god
[1:55:57] he says then search for his place
[1:56:01] find where he said
[1:56:03] and bring it there
[1:56:06] if we confess our sins
[1:56:09] first john 1 9
[1:56:12] if we confess our sins he is faithful
[1:56:14] and just to forgive us of our sins
[1:56:16] and to cleanse us from all
[1:56:17] unrighteousness
[1:56:19] search for the place
[1:56:21] find where he said it
[1:56:24] and bring it there
[1:56:26] there's a provided place for you this
[1:56:28] morning
[1:56:29] you ain't got to do this on your own job
[1:56:31] didn't have to do it on his own abraham
[1:56:33] didn't have to do it on his own isaac
[1:56:34] didn't have to do it on his own but
[1:56:36] there was a word that was spoken
[1:56:38] concerning him and if you could just
[1:56:39] search and find that place where he said
[1:56:42] it and just take it there oh isaiah 53
[1:56:45] said he was wounded for our
[1:56:46] transgressions he was bruised for our
[1:56:48] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:56:51] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[1:56:54] healed look take your burdens unto the
[1:56:56] lord and leave it there he said come
[1:56:58] unto me all ye who are heavy laden and i
[1:57:01] will give you rest you know that word
[1:57:02] means come unto me oh you are heavy
[1:57:05] laden with your spiritual obligations
[1:57:08] with your rituals and this routines of
[1:57:10] you trying to manifest the message on
[1:57:12] your own come unto me oh you are heavy
[1:57:14] laden and you're burdened by trying not
[1:57:17] to cut your hair you're trying to dress
[1:57:19] holy you're trying to match up you're
[1:57:21] trying to make yourself look like a
[1:57:23] believer and you're constantly
[1:57:25] struggling but he's saying come unto me
[1:57:28] all you who are struggling all you and
[1:57:31] come unto me and i will give you rest
[1:57:33] because when you surrender with some
[1:57:35] sincerity unto me i will come into you i
[1:57:39] will deliver you and it will no more be
[1:57:41] you living but it will be myself living
[1:57:44] in you and through you manifesting my
[1:57:47] word because you are the place that i
[1:57:50] have chosen to manifest my word
[1:57:53] oh hallelujah
[1:57:56] oh search for the place
[1:57:58] where he said it
[1:58:00] bring it there
[1:58:02] the prophet of god would say this he'd
[1:58:04] say i'll meet them in one place
[1:58:07] the place i put my name
[1:58:10] that's in jesus christ
[1:58:12] that's where god put his name that's the
[1:58:14] only place he'll meet you
[1:58:16] and it's christ
[1:58:17] it's the word
[1:58:20] it's growed from the feet the thighs
[1:58:22] and now it's in the head fixing to go
[1:58:25] manifesting in full measure the bride as
[1:58:28] same as the groom
[1:58:31] maybe i should read that again
[1:58:33] it's now in the head fixing to go
[1:58:35] manifesting in full measure the bride as
[1:58:39] same as the groom look christ the word
[1:58:42] is manifesting his full measure in you
[1:58:46] the same as the groom
[1:58:49] that's the place of manifestation not
[1:58:51] another place the place where he put his
[1:58:54] name in his name is his word
[1:58:57] now we'll end going down this line here
[1:59:01] the prophet isaiah said in isaiah 7 14
[1:59:08] he said therefore the lord shall give
[1:59:10] you a sign
[1:59:12] behold a virgin shall conceive
[1:59:15] and bear a son
[1:59:17] and shall call his name emmanuel
[1:59:20] so that mary was the place of
[1:59:22] manifestation
[1:59:24] because the word was found in her
[1:59:27] the prophet said a virgin shall conceive
[1:59:31] and she did
[1:59:33] the word said god said through the
[1:59:35] prophet a virgin shall conceive
[1:59:38] and she did and mary was found conceived
[1:59:42] by the holy ghost and that was a sign
[1:59:47] that the word had now taken on flesh and
[1:59:50] was being manifested
[1:59:52] the portion of that word that mary was
[1:59:54] to play in it which was the portion of a
[1:59:57] virgin shall conceive
[1:59:59] and she did
[2:00:01] it was a sign
[2:00:03] and in the face of all the critics and
[2:00:05] in the face of all the scoffers
[2:00:07] look the bible even says joseph being a
[2:00:09] just
[2:00:10] man he was like man i mean
[2:00:15] i mean come on all of us know that
[2:00:18] there's there's only one way this works
[2:00:20] mary
[2:00:22] i know you got some crazy story
[2:00:26] okay you you
[2:00:28] you got pregnant by an angel
[2:00:32] i mean that's that's a hard one
[2:00:35] especially if you're the guy that's
[2:00:37] supposed to marry her
[2:00:38] and she's pregnant with another man's
[2:00:40] baby
[2:00:41] that's a hard one
[2:00:44] it's one thing to have somebody ask for
[2:00:46] forgiveness and repent and say i'm sorry
[2:00:47] this happened that happened but they're
[2:00:48] sticking to their story no joseph
[2:00:51] no i'm telling you i went out i was
[2:00:53] going down to the wash and i was going
[2:00:55] down there and an angel appeared under
[2:00:57] me and said hail mary thou are highly
[2:01:00] favored amongst women
[2:01:03] and you are going to that which is going
[2:01:05] to conceive in you is going to be of the
[2:01:07] holy ghost and she said i said joseph
[2:01:10] i even told the angel how can these
[2:01:12] things be and he said the holy ghost
[2:01:13] will overshadow you
[2:01:15] and his name will be called emmanuel
[2:01:18] i mean you talk about a a hard spot for
[2:01:20] joseph to be in
[2:01:23] but joseph being a just man he was as he
[2:01:25] thought upon these things
[2:01:28] god came to him by a vision and said
[2:01:30] fear not joseph to take mary to be thy
[2:01:33] wife
[2:01:34] for that which is conceived in her is of
[2:01:38] the holy ghost and you shall call his
[2:01:40] name jesus oh it was a divine revelation
[2:01:44] that came unto joseph and a divine
[2:01:46] revelation that came unto mary and it
[2:01:49] was a sign that prophecy was being
[2:01:52] fulfilled
[2:01:57] just kind of
[2:01:59] getting close to where we maybe need to
[2:02:02] end the prophet goes on to say in
[2:02:05] paragraph 210 and god's provided place
[2:02:07] we're trying to bring this down to the
[2:02:08] place where you're living
[2:02:10] down to the place and manifestation of
[2:02:12] the word in you
[2:02:14] that you can see yourself in the message
[2:02:15] that you can see yourself in the bible
[2:02:18] just like uh god visited abraham
[2:02:22] just like god visited mary just as god
[2:02:26] visited joseph
[2:02:27] god has visited you god has visited the
[2:02:30] bride and this generation and god has
[2:02:32] spoken to you
[2:02:36] he says
[2:02:37] but we must find where he put his name
[2:02:41] for in his it is his only provided gate
[2:02:44] amen glory watch where did he put his
[2:02:46] name
[2:02:48] in his son
[2:02:49] so now here's joseph and mary and the
[2:02:51] very thing that has been conceived in
[2:02:53] them is the word made flesh where god is
[2:02:56] putting his name
[2:02:58] and in paragraph 2 13 he says jesus said
[2:03:01] i came in my father's name
[2:03:03] and you received me not
[2:03:05] you want the scripture on that saint
[2:03:07] john 5 43 he said i came in my father's
[2:03:10] name and you received me not then the
[2:03:12] father put his own name which is jesus
[2:03:14] in the son
[2:03:16] notice that the father put his own name
[2:03:18] and jesus which was the son and and that
[2:03:21] and he's the way
[2:03:23] he's the door he's the house he's where
[2:03:26] god chose to put his name
[2:03:28] god never put his name in me
[2:03:31] he never put his it in the church he
[2:03:34] never put it in the methodist baptist
[2:03:36] catholic but he put it in christ the
[2:03:39] anointed emmanuel and the name is the
[2:03:42] word because he is the word amen what is
[2:03:46] he then
[2:03:47] the word interpreted is the
[2:03:50] manifestation of the name of god
[2:03:53] the word interpreted is the
[2:03:56] manifestation of the name of god i want
[2:03:58] to say the word interpreted is the name
[2:04:02] of the lord jesus christ that's god's
[2:04:04] chosen place of worship under the
[2:04:07] revealed word of the hour
[2:04:10] oh jesus said this people draw nigh unto
[2:04:13] me with their mouth and they honor me
[2:04:15] with their lips but their heart is far
[2:04:17] from me why because they were blind to
[2:04:20] the manifestation of the word among them
[2:04:23] i said they were blind to the
[2:04:25] manifestation of the word among them the
[2:04:27] place that god had chosen the place of
[2:04:30] manifestation was in jesus christ the
[2:04:33] place that he chose to place his name
[2:04:36] and that was the interpretation of his
[2:04:38] word a virgin shall conceive and she did
[2:04:42] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[2:04:44] among us and he did
[2:04:48] oh my but second corinthians 3 14 would
[2:04:51] say but their minds were blinded
[2:04:55] for unto this day remain at the same
[2:04:57] veil and taken away in the reading of
[2:04:59] the old testament
[2:05:00] which veil is done away in christ
[2:05:04] watch this but even unto this day
[2:05:07] when moses is red the veil is upon their
[2:05:09] heart when the new testament is read the
[2:05:12] veil is upon their heart when the voice
[2:05:14] of the sound if seventh angel goes forth
[2:05:16] the veil is upon their heart
[2:05:18] nevertheless when it shall turn to the
[2:05:20] lord the veil shall be taken away i want
[2:05:22] to notice you now what speaks to my
[2:05:24] heart he says but unto this day when
[2:05:27] moses is read the veil is upon their
[2:05:29] heart nevertheless when it
[2:05:32] shall turn the lord i want you to oh my
[2:05:34] goodness praise god what was malachi 4 5
[2:05:37] it was the turning of the heart he said
[2:05:41] behold i will send you elijah and what
[2:05:43] was he to do he was to turn the heart it
[2:05:48] was to take away the veil even so as it
[2:05:51] was in the days of the revealing of the
[2:05:53] son of man what was it it was the taking
[2:05:56] away of the veil
[2:05:57] the mighty god unveiled before us the
[2:06:01] word interpreted is the manifestation of
[2:06:05] the lord jesus christ oh hallelujah what
[2:06:08] did he say what was it when they took
[2:06:11] the picture out there on february 28th
[2:06:14] when the prophet picked that up he said
[2:06:16] what is it he said turn it to the right
[2:06:19] that's our lord up there this day
[2:06:22] this scripture is fulfilled and
[2:06:25] finishing out the quote the prophet
[2:06:26] would say flesh and blood has not
[2:06:29] revealed this to you but my father which
[2:06:32] in heaven has revealed this to you who i
[2:06:35] am
[2:06:36] and upon this rock
[2:06:38] watch this now
[2:06:40] and upon this rock i will build my place
[2:06:43] of worship
[2:06:46] upon this rock
[2:06:48] i will build my place of worship and the
[2:06:51] gates of hell can't shake it down oh
[2:06:55] hallelujah he
[2:06:56] that believeth in me
[2:06:58] the works that i do
[2:07:00] shall you do also
[2:07:06] where is the manifestation of the word
[2:07:09] greater works shall you do because i go
[2:07:12] unto the father
[2:07:14] where is the word now being manifested
[2:07:17] the word is being manifested in the
[2:07:18] bride
[2:07:20] oh if the musicians would come we'll
[2:07:21] finish down this line
[2:07:24] oh hallelujah
[2:07:37] praise his wonderful
[2:07:38] name
[2:07:40] flesh and blood have not revealed this
[2:07:42] to you
[2:07:43] it's a revelation
[2:07:45] you can try to walk people through it
[2:07:47] you can try to show it you can tie the
[2:07:49] scriptures you can tie the quote you can
[2:07:51] show them the pictures you can tell them
[2:07:52] about 1933 you can tell them about 1950
[2:07:56] you can tell them about february 28th
[2:07:57] you can tell them about march you can
[2:07:59] tell them about the seals you can tell
[2:08:00] them what god did for you but if the
[2:08:02] veil remaineth upon their heart
[2:08:05] but if that veil
[2:08:07] oh if god would ever take it away and
[2:08:09] god had a provided way
[2:08:12] by the seventh angel messenger
[2:08:15] that by the sounding of the seventh
[2:08:17] angel message that was what god had
[2:08:20] prophesied that was the manifestation of
[2:08:22] the word to take the veil away from your
[2:08:24] heart
[2:08:29] if we can just focus on this last quote
[2:08:31] here
[2:08:32] [Music]
[2:08:35] oh hallelujah just
[2:08:37] if we can just give our attention real
[2:08:38] quick as they play softly
[2:08:42] god had a certain place he met abraham
[2:08:45] and there abraham worshipped
[2:08:50] [Music]
[2:08:55] oh we got so much to be thankful for
[2:08:57] [Music]
[2:09:03] all down

[2:23:14] lord even as brother matthew said and we
[2:23:16] were fellowshipping yesterday and
[2:23:18] walking maybe down memory lane lord
[2:23:20] there's things that you allow in our
[2:23:21] life for a purpose
[2:23:23] lord sometimes we may question in our
[2:23:26] minds or our certain situations and
[2:23:28] decisions that we made and places we've
[2:23:30] moved and the family that we may be a
[2:23:32] part of
[2:23:33] lord but when we have faith and we even
[2:23:35] as even as he spoke about abraham when
[2:23:37] we know that you've spoken to us about
[2:23:39] who we are and what we're supposed to be
[2:23:42] lord it allows those questions just to
[2:23:44] fall and fade away we know that you have
[2:23:47] a purpose and that you call us out from
[2:23:48] situations and family circumstances lord
[2:23:51] and you want us to hear your word and be
[2:23:53] a part of this elected bride lord and as
