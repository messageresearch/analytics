[25:35] if we could
[25:37] just lay
[25:40] ourselves at your feet and humble
[25:43] ourselves to your Mighty hand and know
[25:49] that we're safe in you
[25:51] and that you just take care of all
[25:56] things we just ask that you bless our
[25:58] little time of fellowship tonight those
[26:02] that have come out to the house of the
[26:04] Lord we just ask you to bless them and
[26:08] be with us now father as
[26:12] we look at your word and long for your
[26:17] fellowship we ask these things in jesus'
[26:20] name amen amen let's turn in our Bibles
[26:23] to First John and
[26:33] just want to read a few scriptures uh
[26:37] out of First John a couple in the uh
[26:40] third chapter and a couple in the fourth
[26:43] chapter and and um just uh so if you
[26:47] have that those two chapters in there we
[26:50] want to read in First John 3 and 18
[27:00] and he says little children let us not
[27:04] love in
[27:07] word neither in
[27:10] tongue but in deed and in
[27:14] truth and hereby we know that we are of
[27:20] the truth and shall assure our hearts
[27:26] before him
[27:29] now you see that's a great scripture
[27:32] right there because this this is what
[27:35] we're pressing to a lot of people don't
[27:38] have confidence in their
[27:41] relationship they don't have confidence
[27:43] in in in in what God's done for them you
[27:47] know that he's really forgiv you ever
[27:49] told somebody they say well I'm sorry
[27:52] and you don't know whether they're sorry
[27:54] or not it's like saying I'm sorry but
[27:56] you're waiting for the vengeance
[28:00] you know what I mean yeah you know so uh
[28:04] but that you might be assured that you
[28:07] have this assurance I it's just such a
[28:10] beautiful thought John is showing he
[28:12] says hereby we know that we are of Truth
[28:17] and shall
[28:18] assure our hearts before him for if our
[28:23] hearts condemn us God is greater than
[28:27] our heart
[28:28] and knoweth all things beloved if our
[28:32] hearts condemn us not then we have
[28:35] confidence towards God and whatsoever we
[28:39] ask we receive of him because we kept
[28:44] his Commandments and do those things
[28:48] which are pleasing in his sight and this
[28:53] is his Commandment that we should
[28:57] believe on the name of his son Jesus
[29:01] Christ and love one another as he gave
[29:06] us
[29:08] commandment oh uh uh isn't that good
[29:12] over in the
[29:14] fourth uh
[29:17] chapter ye are of God little
[29:21] children and have overcome them because
[29:25] greater is he that is in you
[29:29] than he that is in the
[29:31] world they are of the world therefore
[29:34] speak they of the world and the world
[29:37] heareth
[29:38] them we are the CH we are of God he that
[29:44] knoweth God heareth us and he that is
[29:49] not of God heareth us not hereby know
[29:54] we we here hereby know we the spirit of
[29:59] truth and the spirit of air
[30:04] beloved let us love one another for love
[30:10] is of God and everyone that
[30:14] loveth is born of God and knoweth God he
[30:20] that loveth
[30:22] not God for God is he that loveth not no
[30:28] knoweth not God for God is love and this
[30:33] was manifested the love of God towards
[30:36] us because that God sent his only
[30:41] begotten son unto the world that we
[30:45] might live through him herein is love
[30:51] not that we love God but that he loved
[30:56] us and sent his son to be the
[31:01] propitiation for our
[31:03] sins beloved if God so loved us we ought
[31:09] also to love one another no manath seen
[31:14] God at any time if we love one another
[31:19] God dwelleth in us and his love is
[31:24] perfected in US amen and and then the
[31:28] 17th verse herein is our love made
[31:33] perfect that we have boldness in the day
[31:37] of judgment because as he is so are we
[31:43] in the world Heavenly Father we ask you
[31:47] to bless your word to us in Jesus
[31:49] precious name we pray amen you may be
[31:54] seated I just thought to uh
[31:58] read some of these scriptures because I
[32:01] I I just think that uh in my heart's
[32:04] desire is that we really come to that
[32:07] place that we know how
[32:10] important um love is and uh um you know
[32:16] Matthew uh shared a quote and uh Matthew
[32:20] that one that you shared with me today
[32:22] at lunch uh when love projects uh
[32:26] Sovereign Grace takes hold do you have
[32:29] that there when you find it let me know
[32:31] I just uh I'd like to have him read that
[32:35] for us and and so if if we can
[32:39] understand from whence our strength
[32:43] comes
[32:44] and
[32:46] uh
[32:49] so you
[32:51] know how can I say this just right
[32:54] because I I I'm trying to get away from
[32:57] negative ity and being critical you know
[33:00] what I mean because I don't think it
[33:02] produces any fruit just to blast this
[33:06] and blast that so it's it's it's not
[33:10] pointing out the air but sometimes uh uh
[33:15] an err is because there's a part of the
[33:19] truth left out of it you understand uh
[33:23] what do they say the best lie is
[33:26] 99% true truth and and so the importance
[33:31] of the uh love of God is is to the
[33:36] believer and the and where the power
[33:39] comes and so you know when man begin to
[33:44] preach they begin to preach that the
[33:46] power of
[33:47] God came from an outside force in other
[33:52] words you were you were there and then
[33:55] the power of God came down and anointed
[33:59] you and they they uh begin to preach
[34:03] that you needed this anointing and this
[34:07] anointing uh man Through the Ages begin
[34:10] to preach that this is what was
[34:13] important to the believer and so when
[34:16] the prophet of God came to the church if
[34:19] you listen to his messages when he
[34:21] started in the beginning he was he
[34:23] talked a lot about Union it didn't
[34:26] matter whether you are Baptist thepress
[34:28] it none of that mattered if you could
[34:30] just love one another but as they begin
[34:33] to proceed they begin to come to the
[34:36] place where uh they begin to
[34:40] inject uh their own ideas and when they
[34:43] begin to inject their own ideas then the
[34:46] prophet of God begin to speak out
[34:49] against the lie that that they were
[34:53] putting upon the people and he was
[34:56] trying to get them back back to the
[34:58] place that where it all started and
[35:03] that's why I believe when he came and
[35:04] preached that great message called uh uh
[35:09] God's provided place of worship and he
[35:12] brought us back to the
[35:15] experience of what it means to be born
[35:18] again amen and and what it really means
[35:21] to where that the where that it becomes
[35:26] generated and it becomes generated when
[35:29] your heart's changed because you've
[35:32] accepted the sacrifice that he's made
[35:34] for you and and then your heart doesn't
[35:38] condemn you because God so loved us so
[35:42] when John starts going through the
[35:43] scripture here he says now brother we
[35:46] have this fellowship with God because
[35:48] God so loved us that he gave his only
[35:51] begotten son and so when you begin to
[35:54] move to the place that that you feel
[35:57] that it's something that's generated
[36:00] from outside that comes down upon you
[36:04] and and then then that that was
[36:06] something that begin to happen and then
[36:08] people begin
[36:10] to have all kinds of experiences and all
[36:14] kinds of emotional outcomes and they
[36:17] begin to look for what was from the
[36:20] outside but but we understand from the
[36:22] word of God God works from the inside
[36:25] out
[36:28] and when a man's heart when he can come
[36:30] to the place that that he has that love
[36:35] and he can project that love did you
[36:37] ever did you find that Matthew I thought
[36:40] it was the one that was in uh uh God's
[36:43] word I'll just quote it uh but B says
[36:46] when when love projects Sovereign Grace
[36:50] takes
[36:51] hold you are saying when the love is
[36:54] there and the love projects we don't
[36:58] have the power to change things but love
[37:01] creates an atmosphere in which God can
[37:04] work and when he sees you you know when
[37:08] he sees that your heart's burdened for
[37:11] somebody or you're longing for somebody
[37:14] or you're praying for somebody and you
[37:17] project that love the prophet of God
[37:19] said that love is what obligates God to
[37:23] heal amen he don't heal just because he
[37:27] has to heal but but something's got to
[37:30] move him you understand something's got
[37:33] to call him on the scene and you can't
[37:36] sit there and try to call God on the
[37:38] scene you know I've been to meetings
[37:40] where they they say God I command
[37:43] you to do this and and and they they'll
[37:47] point and they'll say Lord go there and
[37:51] and do this and and they don't
[37:53] understand that don't move God but you
[37:56] get a cont right heart you get
[37:59] somebody's heart who's bleeding someone
[38:01] who's burdened for somebody and then
[38:04] when that love when they project that
[38:06] love Sovereign
[38:09] Grace another words Sovereign Grace
[38:12] means the grace that only God
[38:15] has and what does grace do Grace changes
[38:21] the inevitable outcome of a
[38:24] circumstance if you're standing right
[38:26] here and there's a truck coming 70 M an
[38:30] hour and and it the inevitable outcome
[38:34] of you getting hit by that truck going
[38:37] 70 miles an hour is you're going to be
[38:39] in pretty sad
[38:43] shape but
[38:46] Grace comes and he changes the
[38:51] outcome and then you hear a testimony
[38:54] that truck came and it struck me going
[38:56] 70 miles an hour and I cut out of it
[39:00] without a
[39:03] scratch what was that that was Sovereign
[39:08] Grace you know something happened to me
[39:10] and I should have
[39:13] been but Sovereign Grace in other words
[39:16] what should have been isn't the result
[39:19] of what happened because Grace took
[39:22] place Grace is called on to the scene
[39:26] when people love one another it's not a
[39:29] power that you pull out of the
[39:31] sky it's not something the music brings
[39:35] it's something that an experience brings
[39:38] because you've been there you've been
[39:40] through it you've felt it you know what
[39:43] it's like to be lost you know what it's
[39:46] like to be
[39:49] sick when the prophet of God that little
[39:51] blind man in Mexico come up he looked at
[39:54] him he had his little hat in his hand he
[39:56] said I looked at him I thought if my
[39:59] coat would fit him or if my shoes I
[40:02] looked at my foot and so all of a sudden
[40:05] he's looking at at the situation and and
[40:09] and his love starts to project he said
[40:12] this could be my daddy this is
[40:15] somebody's father you you understand he
[40:18] got himself in the
[40:24] condition he he he placed him self he's
[40:29] involved in self and to too many now
[40:34] we've got to the place we take whatever
[40:37] happens whatever comes by whatever blows
[40:41] through but that's not taking control of
[40:45] the circumstance that's not creating the
[40:48] atmosphere that's not creating the
[40:50] condition Sons and Daughters of God they
[40:53] create the
[40:56] condition they take control of the
[40:59] atmosphere love is what controls the
[41:02] atmosphere now they have power over
[41:05] those Spirits now they have power
[41:07] because power apart from character is
[41:10] satanic and there's only one character
[41:13] that God has that God is
[41:16] love when you want somebody well just
[41:20] because you want to see a
[41:22] miracle you know what you'll get you'll
[41:25] get a fake miracle
[41:28] but when you want somebody well you know
[41:30] the prophet of God said that you have to
[41:31] have a reason you want to be
[41:35] well I've seen mamas get healed from
[41:38] cancer because they wanted to raise
[41:39] those babies they didn't want to leave
[41:41] their husband raising those babies alone
[41:44] they didn't want to they they just they
[41:47] just couldn't they couldn't bear the
[41:49] thought and they went to the throne of
[41:51] God and it wasn't Lord I want to be
[41:53] healed it was Lord I I don't want to
[41:56] leave my husband to raise these children
[41:58] you gave me these kids I want to raise
[42:01] them I'm not going to let this cancer
[42:03] take me and love to hold love moves God
[42:09] there's nothing that moves God more than
[42:12] to have genuine love and I'll tell you
[42:15] you got to perfect
[42:19] love love Don't Come
[42:22] Easy you got to go through the Hall of
[42:24] critics before you go to the hall of
[42:27] name you know I I know what it's like to
[42:30] be criticized to think that you're not
[42:32] Spirit-filled to think that you don't
[42:35] you don't have God moving in you that
[42:37] the spirit don't God but I've seen God
[42:39] move
[42:42] Devils I've seen babies come to life in
[42:45] [Music]
[42:47] wombs God's got a history when love
[42:51] strikes the power of God
[42:53] comes but if it's not genuine from your
[42:57] your heart's desire because the love of
[43:00] God is beaten in
[43:02] you it's
[43:04] temporary but you get something that's
[43:08] Eternal I've seen lots of Miracles but
[43:11] there's only one thing that moves me
[43:13] more than anything I'd love to see a
[43:15] soul pass from Death un life I love to
[43:19] see someone at at the altar Hellbound
[43:22] and then come to know that him and his
[43:25] power and the glory of his Resurrection
[43:28] that's what moves
[43:30] you that's what life's about and you can
[43:34] impart
[43:37] that I love what we read earlier we have
[43:41] declared unto you what we've heard and
[43:45] seen that we might have
[43:47] Fellowship one with another and with the
[43:53] father so so this is not a a small
[43:59] matter that we're going down the road J
[44:03] John said here it's not love in the
[44:10] tongue and in word we're not preaching a
[44:13] message about love oh love Love's the
[44:17] Capstone we're talking
[44:19] about faith is a
[44:23] substance right so if faith is a
[44:26] substance and faith comes from love then
[44:29] love has to be a substance it has to be
[44:33] something that you can feel that you can
[44:36] know that is as real to you as something
[44:40] something that takes hold of you
[44:42] something you have and something you can
[44:45] recognize when it
[44:49] works how many's ever had the love of
[44:52] God just take over you and all of a
[44:54] sudden you got compassion you got love
[44:57] you know it's him you know he's there
[44:59] give me that kind of love and I'll show
[45:02] you power give me that kind of love and
[45:05] I'll show you Victory you can get on
[45:08] your pedestal and you can shout all you
[45:10] want but genuine love is what
[45:14] conquers that's the Conquering power
[45:18] that's where God's Vindicated and it
[45:20] ain't in four
[45:23] walls it's in your everyday morning you
[45:27] know when you want love you want love in
[45:29] the morning you want love when you wake
[45:32] up you want to approach your day with
[45:34] him on your mind your brother on your
[45:37] mind lost souls on your mind with the
[45:40] commission on your mind I've been called
[45:43] to go into all the world and spread the
[45:46] gospel Lord give me a heart for
[45:51] that we're tired of building churches we
[45:55] want to build the kingdom
[45:59] that's what we want to build we want to
[46:02] build the kingdom I'm for any brother
[46:04] that's wanting to build the
[46:07] kingdom you know you people say I want
[46:09] the I can you imagine if every Church in
[46:12] this town even the other message
[46:14] churches of this town all came
[46:18] here well you'd be in trouble if they
[46:21] got here
[46:24] early cuz You' have spent all your money
[46:26] building it and they would possess
[46:32] it can you
[46:34] imagine I don't want everybody else
[46:39] there I don't want everybody's believer
[46:42] everywhere let I want other brothers to
[46:44] have people being doing work they can
[46:46] reach people I can never reach I want
[46:49] everybody praying for the sick everybody
[46:52] telling them about
[46:55] Jesus I just like to
[46:57] run through a few of the statements that
[47:00] we listened to this
[47:02] morning and and I hope this morning by
[47:05] listening to what we listen to you
[47:07] understand why it's so important to play
[47:10] the tapes because the prophet of God
[47:12] said the trouble with the church is they
[47:14] got secondhand
[47:15] religion and here everything we believe
[47:20] everything we stand for came from a
[47:22] mouth of a prophet and then so many of
[47:25] us won't even play his voice in our
[47:29] church don't tell me you're feeding on
[47:31] it you're feeding on man's
[47:34] interpretation but when you can hear it
[47:37] from The Source then you can bind your
[47:39] spirit and that Spirit and the scripture
[47:42] tells us to try every
[47:45] Spirit what are you going to try it by
[47:48] I'll tell you what you try it by in this
[47:50] day you try it by the voice of Luke
[47:53] 17:30 Revelations 10:7 and Malachi 4
[47:58] that's the voice that judges this
[48:02] generation you know
[48:05] assuredly that this is what he said Paul
[48:08] said be followers of me as I am of
[48:12] Christ I believe they preach the same
[48:14] message don't
[48:16] you I love what this
[48:20] says and so we we talked to that he says
[48:23] now the Holy Spirit feeds on
[48:29] music what do you
[48:32] mean the Holy Spirit feeds on music the
[48:35] Holy Spirit feeds on
[48:38] personality the Holy Spirit feeds on
[48:42] Style
[48:44] no the Holy Spirit feeds on the
[48:52] word what attracts the Holy Spirit
[48:59] now there's a rain that falls on the
[49:01] just and there's a rain that falls on
[49:03] the
[49:05] unjust but that seed hungers for that
[49:10] word it that's what it feeds on the Holy
[49:14] Spirit feeds on the word it's looking
[49:17] for that word it's looking for something
[49:20] that they can grab that they knows real
[49:22] that they can stand on and it'll hold
[49:25] true in their life lives and they don't
[49:28] they don't have to be
[49:30] afraid
[49:31] right what's the biggest problem of the
[49:34] church we heard this morning
[49:37] fear they have confidence this is what
[49:40] we just read if you have confidence
[49:42] towards
[49:44] God and your heart condemns you not then
[49:48] you can ask what you will you don't have
[49:51] to worry about what you're asking your
[49:55] your motives are pure your objectives
[49:57] are pure you have confidence that he
[50:00] hears you because there's no sin in your
[50:06] life you know you I I we're we're here
[50:09] tonight the a lot of people are camped
[50:13] out and and got their their popcorn and
[50:16] they're hoping for a chief and or or the
[50:20] Eagles well the real eagles are
[50:25] here this is the winning
[50:28] Eagles right here he amen and in about
[50:32] in about three hours uh from now that
[50:36] that thing will be over with and and
[50:39] they'll have glory for a couple weeks
[50:42] and then everybody talks about next
[50:47] year oh who won it can anybody tell me
[50:50] who won number 14 what are they on now
[50:53] 56 or something like that
[50:58] it's
[50:59] ridiculous it's so temporary it's so
[51:03] carnal you know you you it we're we're
[51:07] missing
[51:09] it what we're missing is what God's
[51:11] given us just let's just I'm going to
[51:13] read just some he says the Holy Spirit
[51:15] feeds on the word and he
[51:18] said and they are listening to the radio
[51:21] they go to church and so forth because
[51:23] they are longing for that Fellowship
[51:27] around the word so in other words you
[51:30] can start to tell when God's done
[51:33] something for somebody you ever get
[51:35] around people now they don't want to
[51:36] talk about the word they don't want to
[51:38] sit in there and talk about the seals
[51:40] you sit down and talk about what God's
[51:42] doing everybody's out of the
[51:44] room you know what I mean they're not
[51:47] into that we got service we had a great
[51:50] time but they don't want to Fellowship
[51:52] around the word they don't want to talk
[51:53] about salvation they don't want to hear
[51:55] the quotes they don't want to talk about
[51:57] the Prophet The Prophet's not important
[51:59] anymore they're separating the message
[52:02] from the messenger they're trying to
[52:04] replace brother Brandon with the Holy
[52:05] Spirit you'll never replace the prophet
[52:08] of God with the holy spirit because that
[52:10] was the Holy
[52:12] Spirit that's right it was the spirit
[52:15] manifesting himself in our generation in
[52:19] flesh just like he did to the Gentiles
[52:22] so he'd have a pure path to judgment
[52:27] oh
[52:29] uhuh well I want to Fellowship about
[52:32] that have Bible studies and get around I
[52:36] love them little boys that were they'd
[52:37] get together and sit around there you
[52:39] walk in there eight nine 10 12 year olds
[52:41] all sitting in the circle having a Bible
[52:44] study
[52:45] Hallelujah I wanted to join it myself
[52:48] but I was afraid they too smart for
[52:51] me that's what I'm talking about what's
[52:53] happening to the church it's dying
[52:56] it's dropping dead right before your
[52:59] eyes it's leaving the voice of God it's
[53:03] leaving the leadership of the prophet of
[53:05] the hour and and now they're out there
[53:07] fussing and arguing one another won't go
[53:10] to one another's camps and all that
[53:12] stuff they're dying why are they dying
[53:15] we left
[53:19] Calvary we forgot what he paid for us we
[53:23] forgot what he did for us and I hope
[53:26] everybody in here has the experience of
[53:29] knowing the loving forgiving hand of the
[53:32] Lord because that's the only thing that
[53:35] changes your
[53:37] attitude I thank God I I I'm not I don't
[53:40] thank God for my sins but I thank God
[53:43] that he saved me from where he saved me
[53:45] because I there's not a man that I look
[53:47] on that I don't believe God can
[53:53] help I don't care how what shape they
[53:56] are
[53:57] in I always thought in my heart you know
[54:00] brother BR said he was scared of that
[54:02] bull he said I started out he says I was
[54:05] scared at first then something happened
[54:09] I always thought if I'd had to look at
[54:10] one of those MS13 guys you know you ever
[54:14] seen some of them guys all tattooed up
[54:16] and never been they look
[54:19] scary I was just wondering if I could
[54:21] come face to face with a couple of those
[54:23] scary
[54:24] guys and they're scary
[54:28] and then that love could hit
[54:30] me then I could say guys I I I I mean
[54:34] you guys look
[54:37] scary and maybe that's why you do it and
[54:40] you forgive me you know that I I'm kind
[54:44] of oldfashioned and and everything but
[54:47] if you guys would just hear me out I'd
[54:50] like to tell you about the love of God
[54:54] that can forgive you of your sins
[54:57] oh wouldn't that be lovely wouldn't that
[54:59] be without it burned in your heart
[55:02] people don't hardly testify anymore they
[55:04] don't go out to the lost they go to
[55:06] church after church trying to aost
[55:11] toite let's have
[55:13] converts I I'm happy for anybody who'd
[55:16] move here I'm not I'm not condemning
[55:18] that but I'd rather have
[55:20] converts that's what made our
[55:22] congregation was people getting
[55:24] converted off the street
[55:28] com un to the
[55:29] Lord that that's what that's the
[55:32] foundation of every church is not passed
[55:35] down from family to family it's birthing
[55:38] the Lost into existence and every single
[55:42] one of you has a testimony don't let
[55:44] your past keep you from
[55:47] testifying don't let your present moment
[55:50] failures keep you from telling the truth
[55:53] because the truth is what sets people
[55:55] free he says here it says may God help
[55:59] us tonight to realize how we can have a
[56:04] perfect
[56:06] Fellowship how we can realize we all
[56:09] need to come what is a realization
[56:13] what's our word for
[56:14] realization
[56:17] Revelation to have a revelation of how I
[56:21] can have fellowship with God you've got
[56:23] to have fellowship with them cuz if if
[56:26] you're in Fellowship you'll know when
[56:27] he's here you'll know when he's coming
[56:31] my friends know what I'm going to do I
[56:33] call you friends you know the hand of
[56:37] the Lord you know how he's moving you
[56:38] know the spirit of the Lord you know
[56:40] what direction it is I think the trouble
[56:43] with this message today is people don't
[56:44] know where they're
[56:47] going one person thinks this doctrine's
[56:49] going to get them there another person
[56:51] thinks this doctrine's going to get
[56:53] another person thinks this blessing's
[56:55] going to do it another person persons
[56:56] think this is anointing there's only one
[56:58] thing that's do that does it is if
[57:01] you've been and you've
[57:06] died you got to
[57:08] die and if you die and you rise up in
[57:12] the love that saved you and that's the
[57:16] love that you've taken in your heart
[57:19] it'll keep you
[57:22] forever and I I guarantee you I've done
[57:24] things that God's Got every bit of right
[57:27] to take me off the book but he made me a
[57:32] promise and God keeps his
[57:36] word he started the work and he'll
[57:39] finish it so we got it there's a
[57:43] realization and no matter where Storms
[57:46] Come whether you're right or wrong you
[57:49] can still have Fellowship that's right
[57:54] think of that whether you've
[57:58] done
[58:00] right or
[58:02] wrong can you imagine being in such love
[58:05] that you've done something wrong and you
[58:08] go to him and say Aba father I'm sorry I
[58:13] can't be without
[58:14] you I remember one time I had a close
[58:17] friend he was a buddy to me we did
[58:20] everything together we hunted we did
[58:22] everything and one day I said something
[58:25] and I did didn't mean to say it it I I
[58:28] understood how he took it I didn't CU he
[58:31] was in a circumstance and I made a
[58:33] comment and it broke that
[58:37] Fellowship you know what I mean
[58:40] and and I I didn't know what was going
[58:43] on years later I realized it and and all
[58:46] you can do is is go back and say you
[58:49] know I was wrong I'm sorry I didn't mean
[58:51] it I I want that Fellowship back I don't
[58:55] want nothing in between us I I love you
[58:58] you understand and that's the way it is
[59:00] with the lord it's no no good to run
[59:03] around in shame he already knows what
[59:05] you've done he knows what you've done he
[59:08] knows what you're going through he knows
[59:10] what your weakness is he died for you
[59:13] when you were yet a sinner why don't you
[59:15] talk it over with him Lord my mind's
[59:18] messed up I get all defeated I I got I'm
[59:22] hot as a a a Irish firecraft
[59:26] ER and that's pretty odd I know I'm
[59:31] Irish you know help
[59:34] me he won't turn you
[59:37] away Lord let let let this work out for
[59:41] me I've had so many failures please let
[59:44] this time let me do things right he
[59:47] won't he won't leave you or forsake you
[59:50] so this is what he says he says no
[59:52] matter of the storm you still have
[59:54] Fellowship the only way you can can have
[59:56] Fellowship is as your love
[1:00:01] perfects a amen and it isn't that uh
[1:00:06] what we we just LED no no man hath seen
[1:00:09] God at any time but if we love one
[1:00:12] another God dwelleth in us and his love
[1:00:16] is perfected in
[1:00:22] us I I never thought of it Lord perfect
[1:00:26] your love in me how do you get how do
[1:00:28] you have to how does your love get
[1:00:30] perfected you have this trouble and you
[1:00:33] love through it this person offends you
[1:00:37] and you forgive them this situation
[1:00:39] Rises up and maybe somebody took
[1:00:43] something from you or or or or or stole
[1:00:47] from from you I just had a a riffer that
[1:00:50] I really liked the guy and I liked his
[1:00:52] family and he went and took a job from
[1:00:54] me and I was supposed to do and and and
[1:00:57] and and and just did it and you know and
[1:01:00] and and he called me back and I and I
[1:01:03] talked to him about it I said Jose man
[1:01:05] that wasn't right he said man David it
[1:01:07] says I like you I'm sorry I did that oh
[1:01:09] I hate it when somebody says they
[1:01:12] sorry cuz they got me
[1:01:15] then you know what I mean I mean I don't
[1:01:18] have a thing to say after that you can't
[1:01:20] even be mad I said okay all right I I
[1:01:24] I'll give you a chance we'll do
[1:01:26] something to make up for
[1:01:27] it sometimes things are worth more to
[1:01:30] you than the other thing I hope people
[1:01:34] mean more to
[1:01:39] you you know I just I just really do and
[1:01:42] I'll tell you something I don't care if
[1:01:43] people criticized because I know who
[1:01:45] loves
[1:01:46] me I know where I come from I know what
[1:01:49] he's done for me and I know the prayers
[1:01:52] that he's heard
[1:01:56] I have confidence CU I'll guarantee you
[1:01:59] I didn't save myself I did not come to
[1:02:03] the knowledge of Jesus Christ Jesus
[1:02:05] Christ knocked me down and then when I
[1:02:09] was dying in suicidal he showed up to
[1:02:13] tell me he loved me and you can just
[1:02:16] rest assured so we so Love's
[1:02:19] perfected and he
[1:02:21] said and he said don't never forget me
[1:02:25] if I don't see you no more remember this
[1:02:30] that my theme is love covers it all I
[1:02:36] believe in the redeeming love of Jesus
[1:02:41] Christ amen don't you don't you don't
[1:02:45] you just believe that a amen and then we
[1:02:49] we heard what he said listen just a
[1:02:51] moment I'd rather have a church that
[1:02:54] knows nothing about any spiritual gift
[1:02:59] and just be so in love with each other
[1:03:05] with Christ I'd rather have that than
[1:03:08] every spiritual gift operating in the
[1:03:11] church now that might sound hard in a
[1:03:15] Pentecostal group but I would rather
[1:03:17] have it where there is gifts they'll
[1:03:22] fail where there are gifts they'll bring
[1:03:26] confusion where there is gifts they can
[1:03:29] be
[1:03:31] questioned but where there is love it is
[1:03:37] perfect you can't question
[1:03:40] love when somebody loves you you just
[1:03:44] can't question it you know
[1:03:47] it that's what happens to marriages they
[1:03:50] get doub in one another they get
[1:03:52] questioning they don't talk it out they
[1:03:55] something comes in and pretty soon they
[1:03:58] they don't understand why they're not
[1:04:00] connected got to get back to perfect
[1:04:03] love perfect love cast out all fear he
[1:04:07] said but where there love is perfect is
[1:04:09] that right and if you had perfect love
[1:04:13] you'd have perfect gifts that's right so
[1:04:17] work first with
[1:04:19] love that brings fellowship and
[1:04:23] fellowship brings gifts
[1:04:26] that's what happened to the
[1:04:28] church they didn't get the love first
[1:04:32] they didn't get the
[1:04:33] Capstone you want gifts every single
[1:04:36] gift's in you the gifts are in the
[1:04:38] church God can move on those gifts any
[1:04:41] time it don't prove
[1:04:43] nothing every gift's operating in every
[1:04:46] other church out here but a perfect gift
[1:04:49] is run by perfect
[1:04:51] love so we just want to go over some of
[1:04:55] these things
[1:04:56] and and I I like what he said here he
[1:04:58] said that the only hope an alcoholic a
[1:05:00] drug addict has is the blood of Jesus
[1:05:04] Christ is that right am now in in the
[1:05:08] beginning man had
[1:05:10] Fellowship first we realize if we can
[1:05:14] have fellowship with God we've got to
[1:05:18] realize we can have fellowship with God
[1:05:21] do you realize that God will talk to
[1:05:24] every single one of you
[1:05:26] he will have a personal appointment with
[1:05:30] you just like if you came into my office
[1:05:33] and sat down and we had a
[1:05:37] chat you know just like I I I my buddy
[1:05:41] uh uh you know JJ we he he come up and
[1:05:45] and and I said what are you doing now oh
[1:05:47] he says I'm doing body work you know and
[1:05:49] I my mind goes body work yeah good I
[1:05:52] wreck my truck all the time and he
[1:05:55] showed me pictures we're fellowshipping
[1:05:58] we're talking about what he's doing how
[1:06:00] he wants to be a body man and everything
[1:06:02] there goes your helper and uh so you
[1:06:05] know and I I think well praise God just
[1:06:09] think you can have that with
[1:06:12] god with the creator of Heaven and Earth
[1:06:16] how good is that anybody tell me how
[1:06:18] good that is that's good don't you like
[1:06:22] to have God said so God told me bam said
[1:06:25] was common that men used to talk to
[1:06:29] God it was common for men to see God it
[1:06:33] was common for them their lives to be
[1:06:36] instructed by God that's where we need
[1:06:38] to get back
[1:06:40] to it all stems from having a born again
[1:06:43] experience at
[1:06:45] Calvary many of people have had hands
[1:06:48] laid on them and had a experience and
[1:06:51] had the Holy Spirit touch them but you
[1:06:53] tell me how the prophet God said you
[1:06:56] could have the Holy Spirit every day of
[1:06:58] your life and still go to hell what's
[1:07:03] missing you know what's
[1:07:05] missing the
[1:07:09] blood the
[1:07:11] Forgiveness the
[1:07:14] experience of his Divine
[1:07:19] forgiveness he said he said if we
[1:07:22] realize we can have fellowship with God
[1:07:25] then don't worry God will take care of
[1:07:29] the rest of it but fellowship with God
[1:07:32] the first and original Fellowship that
[1:07:34] human beings ever had was with God he
[1:07:39] say every Christian Longs for Fellowship
[1:07:43] but after all you don't have to go
[1:07:45] anywhere but to Calvary he said I read a
[1:07:49] story of a man who spent a lifetime
[1:07:51] nearly going high into the hills going
[1:07:54] it by lakes and hunting for a spot for
[1:08:00] Fellowship but after all you don't have
[1:08:03] to go anywhere but to Calvary that's the
[1:08:07] only way there is a way and there's only
[1:08:11] one way that you can go to
[1:08:15] Fellowship he he says there's a way
[1:08:18] there's only one way that you can go to
[1:08:21] Fellowship he said and he talking about
[1:08:24] job he says but think he's closer to you
[1:08:28] than his door his door is your heart and
[1:08:32] he so close tonight he's closer to you
[1:08:37] than your right arm is he's a
[1:08:40] part of
[1:08:43] you anybody look for the glasses on
[1:08:45] their
[1:08:47] face anybody ever look for the glasses
[1:08:50] on their head I remember I had a pair of
[1:08:52] glasses on my head and I had a pair of
[1:08:55] glasses es in my hand and I reached in
[1:08:57] my pocket and put a pair of glasses on
[1:08:59] my
[1:09:00] face of course the people was thinking
[1:09:03] there was something spiritual going on
[1:09:06] but it was just that I couldn't tell the
[1:09:08] beginning from the end you know what I
[1:09:10] mean but I appreciate the love and
[1:09:13] everybody covering for
[1:09:15] me you you know what I mean
[1:09:18] but he he's part of you he's right in
[1:09:24] there he put he put a part of himself in
[1:09:27] you the seed of God all he wants to do
[1:09:30] is germinate it and and and so I just I
[1:09:34] think I'll just close with this this
[1:09:37] evening because this is so he
[1:09:40] says he says he he can he's a a part of
[1:09:45] you and if we can only
[1:09:48] realize that he's here and how he wants
[1:09:52] to have fellowship with us his heart is
[1:09:56] greater for Fellowship than ours are and
[1:10:02] the reason he makes us that way is
[1:10:06] because we're offspring of his and
[1:10:10] that's what makes us long for Fellowship
[1:10:14] don't you understand what the beauty of
[1:10:16] that is there's the
[1:10:19] Redeemer and the
[1:10:21] redeemed and when the Redeemer and the
[1:10:24] redeemed come together and they become
[1:10:28] one it's the beautiful
[1:10:32] picture remember he was a
[1:10:35] Healer but until he healed somebody
[1:10:38] healing and the Healer had to come
[1:10:42] together the
[1:10:44] deliverer and the one that needed
[1:10:47] Deliverance so the deliverance and the
[1:10:51] deliverer come together the sick and the
[1:10:54] Healer come together the the the lost
[1:10:58] and the Savior come together that's the
[1:11:03] love
[1:11:04] story that's the love story is when God
[1:11:09] all that he is and what you are and they
[1:11:12] come
[1:11:14] together and and that's what he prayed
[1:11:16] father may they be one as we are one
[1:11:19] when they come
[1:11:21] together and now once you've been healed
[1:11:24] you pack
[1:11:26] healing you got healing you pack it with
[1:11:29] you once you've been saved you pack
[1:11:32] salvation once you've been delivered you
[1:11:34] pack Deliverance you never
[1:11:42] forget I have two boys that are healed
[1:11:44] by
[1:11:50] cancer they won't they won't they'll
[1:11:53] testify of it
[1:11:56] but the doctor said this is the way it
[1:11:58] is get you know you know how the doctors
[1:12:02] are you you think they're writing you a
[1:12:05] prescription to get better
[1:12:08] uh-uh like that that's a Doom's message
[1:12:11] here take this until you get worse and
[1:12:14] then I'll give you something else to
[1:12:15] make you
[1:12:16] worse oh they got healed Hallelujah you
[1:12:20] think you'll ever tell them God ain't a
[1:12:23] Healer no because now they're one
[1:12:27] they're packing it you ever had the love
[1:12:30] of
[1:12:31] God you'll pack it amen if you've ever
[1:12:35] been to Calvary you'll have what caused
[1:12:39] Calvary you ever been there you'll get
[1:12:42] why he did it in the first place you'll
[1:12:45] have it you'll possess it it'll be a
[1:12:48] part of
[1:12:50] you and we could go on because I got
[1:12:55] pages of of underlying things and and
[1:12:59] and statements that just came out of
[1:13:01] that 30
[1:13:05] minutes I don't know if you're listening
[1:13:08] on live stream or where you are but I
[1:13:10] would encourage you to talk to your
[1:13:13] pastor about playing The
[1:13:17] Voice the Divine voice the voice of God
[1:13:25] to the flock it's life and it's life
[1:13:29] more abundant and the prophet of God
[1:13:31] said he said I love the holy spirit
[1:13:34] because it was the spirit that healed me
[1:13:37] it was the spirit that saved
[1:13:39] me it's it's what it is you say what is
[1:13:43] the spirit the spirit is God and what is
[1:13:48] God love you cannot have the Holy Spirit
[1:13:53] without having Divine
[1:13:56] love that was the motive God so loved
[1:14:00] his people he said I will not leave you
[1:14:04] comfortless but I personal pronoun will
[1:14:09] come again and I'll be with you even in
[1:14:13] you till the end I will not forsake you
[1:14:17] but I'll send you another comfort and he
[1:14:19] shall lead you and guide you in all
[1:14:22] truth and righteousness oh what is
[1:14:26] it brother McGary what is the Holy
[1:14:29] Spirit what was he given for it's the
[1:14:31] love of God that the love of God his
[1:14:36] love for you will be with you every day
[1:14:40] and you'll know I don't have to
[1:14:43] fear I don't have to be
[1:14:46] afraid cuz if God be for me who can be
[1:14:50] against
[1:14:51] me you can talk about anything but
[1:14:55] without love without Divine
[1:14:59] love it
[1:15:02] profiteth nothing though I speak with
[1:15:05] the men the tongues of men and angels
[1:15:08] though I have all gifts though I have
[1:15:11] all things and I have not charity it
[1:15:13] profiteth me
[1:15:16] nothing I remember one time when and and
[1:15:21] and we know that brother Billy Paul has
[1:15:23] gone on to be with the Lord I'm sure
[1:15:25] sure that shocked a lot of people
[1:15:27] because they thought California had to
[1:15:29] sink first no everything in God's word
[1:15:32] is eternal it was thought in the
[1:15:35] beginning it's a thought in the end we
[1:15:37] don't put the calendar together God
[1:15:39] interprets his word by what bringing it
[1:15:42] to
[1:15:43] pass but we were talking about the time
[1:15:47] that brother Brandon was behind the
[1:15:49] curtain and he was waiting to come onto
[1:15:52] the platform and and
[1:15:56] I said Billy I said he I said remember
[1:15:59] when your daddy was uh the guy got up
[1:16:03] and said that uh brother Brandon was
[1:16:08] gone you know and course he told me he
[1:16:11] says you know who that was don't you he
[1:16:13] told me about it and everything he I
[1:16:16] said why didn't he come out there he
[1:16:18] said he would never kill that man's
[1:16:23] influence and and when you see people
[1:16:26] killing one another's influence it's
[1:16:28] murder I don't care it's
[1:16:32] murder it's
[1:16:33] [Music]
[1:16:36] murderous and it's
[1:16:40] contagious and you know why he didn't go
[1:16:42] out because if he went out that wouldn't
[1:16:46] have just affected that man it would
[1:16:49] have affected everybody in that place it
[1:16:51] would have affected the purity of his
[1:16:53] message it would
[1:16:56] affected he made preparation remember
[1:16:59] those two kids that were in the audience
[1:17:02] that he could have
[1:17:03] smoted but what what
[1:17:06] happened he said I forgive
[1:17:09] you could you imagine if he would have
[1:17:11] smoted
[1:17:13] him it would have rewrote the whole
[1:17:17] story love is my
[1:17:20] theme the redeeming blood of Jesus
[1:17:24] Christ covers all just think of it I
[1:17:28] thought why didn't he go out he said
[1:17:30] he'd never do
[1:17:32] that he'd never hurt
[1:17:35] people he said you couldn't tell who his
[1:17:38] enemies were and who his friends
[1:17:41] were I thought Lord you got to be
[1:17:44] kidding me I knew exactly what I would
[1:17:47] have
[1:17:48] done I would have flown out from behind
[1:17:51] that curtain said liar
[1:17:56] you know liar liar pants on fire nose is
[1:18:00] longer than a telephone wire then they
[1:18:02] would say look who's
[1:18:08] talking you don't have to
[1:18:10] worry he's got it he's in
[1:18:14] control let's get love back into the
[1:18:17] church let's pray for everybody I'm glad
[1:18:20] there's different churches I'm glad
[1:18:22] there's different doctrines
[1:18:25] but I I just I it doesn't
[1:18:29] matter you know let me take care of let
[1:18:32] the love of God be shed abroad in My
[1:18:36] Heart by the Holy Spirit and maybe uh
[1:18:39] we'll we can we can just go through so
[1:18:42] many of these quotes how he talks about
[1:18:44] preparation and I wanted to talk about
[1:18:47] that tonight prepping you know being
[1:18:50] prepared for every circumstance but we
[1:18:53] we don't have time
[1:18:55] so anyway Lord bless you tonight for
[1:18:57] coming out and I know it's getting cold
[1:18:59] and and it's it's hard to believe we
[1:19:02] still have a little bit of winter ahead
[1:19:04] of us huh we might have an ice storm or
[1:19:07] something but as soon as we have a
[1:19:10] beautiful day we're going to have the
[1:19:13] Pavilion uh dedication service our nice
[1:19:17] new Pavilion and and have uh set up some
[1:19:22] tables outside and have a it's a
[1:19:24] beautiful thing and and uh we have some
[1:19:28] nice lights to shine on the grass but
[1:19:31] the lights are so powerful the neighbor
[1:19:33] called me and said somebody left the
[1:19:35] lights on last night he said you got
[1:19:37] anything going on over there he said my
[1:19:40] so I I I run over here and his house was
[1:19:42] lit up like a football field I'm so
[1:19:45] thankful he called me first instead of
[1:19:47] the
[1:19:48] police but we we'll have
[1:19:51] fellowship and then we're we're having a
[1:19:54] dinner old
[1:19:55] people so uh so someone said that they
[1:20:01] wanted to know if you had to be married
[1:20:04] 40 years before you could come to the
[1:20:07] dinner well that would be maybe me and
[1:20:10] lesle anybody else in here been married
[1:20:13] 40 years oh well we got so there'll be
[1:20:15] three of us there we might as well just
[1:20:18] go over to uh Bobs and have dinner right
[1:20:22] but if you so it's it's not it's not for
[1:20:26] uh uh uh being married over 40 years is
[1:20:31] nowadays you probably couldn't find
[1:20:33] anybody in a nominal church that stuck
[1:20:36] it out that long you know especially
[1:20:38] because they have divorce programs and
[1:20:41] divorce Wednesday night and remarried
[1:20:44] singles you know what I mean and and
[1:20:47] then they got books you can read and
[1:20:49] check it off and then you put your stuff
[1:20:51] in the computer and they they match you
[1:20:54] I'd rather be matched by God wouldn't
[1:20:57] you I know what it's like to be matched
[1:21:00] by God Amen God got mine to me and just
[1:21:05] she dialed the wrong number and and uh I
[1:21:08] opened my mouth and I told her if I ever
[1:21:10] meet you I'll change your life to ever
[1:21:13] you know God held me at my word and so
[1:21:15] every day her life's brand new I'll
[1:21:18] guarantee you so she don't know what to
[1:21:21] expect but praise God you know what I
[1:21:24] mean that the way you want it isn't it
[1:21:27] isn't it huh yeah I I I can look back at
[1:21:31] different couples you know and I'm just
[1:21:33] grinning Madden Heidi I
[1:21:37] mean I'm just gonna say it that if you
[1:21:40] get mad at me that's okay but you know
[1:21:42] Matt come to the message and and that's
[1:21:45] not who Heidi
[1:21:48] married you know what I mean she wanted
[1:21:50] to know who's this guy you know all all
[1:21:55] of a sudden Matt went from just being a
[1:21:57] good old guy you know she used to bail
[1:21:59] him out of jail and all that stuff you
[1:22:01] know what I mean and and and and now
[1:22:05] he's uh he's just turned religious on
[1:22:08] her you know what I mean and
[1:22:10] she's wondering what's going on you know
[1:22:13] he just stuck with it you know what she
[1:22:15] done one day she he went and got one of
[1:22:17] them books he was
[1:22:18] reading and she started reading it amen
[1:22:22] I still have it as Vivid in my mind
[1:22:25] as it can be she finally stood up and
[1:22:27] said you know I can't fight it anymore
[1:22:29] this is the truth God knew what he was
[1:22:31] doing he had it all planned out from the
[1:22:34] beginning there's nothing going to break
[1:22:36] that he just knew
[1:22:38] it and that's how he
[1:22:40] is amen I like it when God does
[1:22:43] something do you believe you still can
[1:22:45] move
[1:22:47] amen I don't want him to move for power
[1:22:51] sake I want God to move for love sake
[1:22:55] I want our
[1:22:58] love call the power of God on the scene
[1:23:04] I don't have to prove God created the
[1:23:06] heavens and earth I don't have to prove
[1:23:09] God's A Healer I want to have a heart
[1:23:12] that wants healing and Jesus looked upon
[1:23:15] him and he had
[1:23:17] compassion he said get me a fish get me
[1:23:21] a loaf of bread
[1:23:24] I I want to have that when he come a
[1:23:27] pass and and those demons were there and
[1:23:32] he had
[1:23:33] compassion on them he didn't have to
[1:23:37] cast those demons
[1:23:39] out but he
[1:23:40] did and they didn't even want him in
[1:23:43] their
[1:23:45] country
[1:23:47] anymore but that's what we want
[1:23:50] church so you want to say brother McGary
[1:23:53] what are you talking about
[1:23:57] after the seven Church ages a statue of
[1:23:59] a perfect man you'll see a little line
[1:24:02] that says holy spirit a lot of them got
[1:24:06] that
[1:24:06] far and they went into gifts they went
[1:24:10] into discernments they went into
[1:24:13] everything but there's one step above it
[1:24:17] and that's Divine love and without
[1:24:20] perfect love you will not be there and
[1:24:23] that's the
[1:24:24] word of the Lord so let's press for the
[1:24:28] higher calling the higher Mark let's let
[1:24:31] the love of God be shed abroad in our
[1:24:34] heart by the Holy Spirit God bless you
[1:24:36] would you pray for me Tuesday I go in
[1:24:39] for my eye surgery as many of you know I
[1:24:42] went blind in my uh right eye and uh I
[1:24:47] remember just uh in fact I was standing
[1:24:50] right on this Pulpit about a year ago
[1:24:53] when I went blind in my left
[1:24:55] eye and I all of a sudden I went blind
[1:24:58] and I we called the doctor and he
[1:25:00] thought I had a stroke in my eye and we
[1:25:03] went to the doctor and he looked in
[1:25:04] there and blood had I broke a vessel and
[1:25:08] and it filled my eye with blood Well's
[1:25:10] happened on this side so they're going
[1:25:12] to go there and they stick three
[1:25:15] needles in my eye and I told them put me
[1:25:18] in never Neverland amen I want to
[1:25:21] experience the Rapture I want him to
[1:25:24] give me enough juice that I'm in the
[1:25:26] Millennium you know what I
[1:25:28] mean cuz I I I want to wake up in a you
[1:25:32] know next
[1:25:34] Thursday anyway and so they they stick a
[1:25:37] camera in your
[1:25:39] eye they stick a
[1:25:41] laser in your eye and they stick a
[1:25:45] suction tube in your I just want you to
[1:25:49] experience misery and Joy Company you
[1:25:52] know what I mean so I really want you to
[1:25:54] know what I'm going to be going through
[1:25:55] you know what I mean so uh it might
[1:25:58] cause you to fast in the morning but so
[1:26:02] then they they draw all the blood out
[1:26:04] and all the fluid in your eye they draw
[1:26:06] it all out then they take the laser and
[1:26:09] they find the little places is bleeding
[1:26:12] and then they they burn all those and
[1:26:16] then they pump new fluid in your eye and
[1:26:20] then eventually that fluid goes into
[1:26:22] your body and is replaced with natural
[1:26:24] fluid and you can see again so when I
[1:26:28] can finally really see then I can really

[1:38:04] for me to enter into prayer it's a it's
[1:38:06] a time for all of us to enter into
[1:38:08] prayer right now there's things on your
[1:38:10] heart there's people who are not
[1:38:13] here and as he's promised us we don't
[1:38:16] ask because we don't if we don't trust
[1:38:18] him we won't ask but I believe he loves
[1:38:21] us enough and he's shown you his love
[1:38:23] and and there's a Salvation that you
[1:38:25] possess there's a healing that you
[1:38:27] possess and what a precious audience
[1:38:29] that's been gathered here tonight and as
[1:38:32] we pray think of those who are not here
[1:38:34] that Grace would interject they wrote
[1:38:37] their testimony tonight they're not here
[1:38:40] there was testimonies being spoken but
[1:38:42] when Sovereign Grace projects that's
[1:38:44] right it rewrites the
[1:38:47] testimony let's just go
[1:38:50] before gracious Heavenly Father we're
[1:38:52] not relying on any any other testimony
[1:38:54] than that of Calvary father for the
[1:38:57] blood that rewrote our lives and Lord
[1:39:00] those who were once Sinners and doomed
[1:39:03] father Your Love projected and it
[1:39:05] apprehended us and now we can claim you
[1:39:07] as our savior the one who touched Our
[1:39:10] Lives father and when we were going one
[1:39:12] way you changed us father and that Grace
[1:39:14] has met us every morning Lord there's
[1:39:17] things that we do that would destroy our
[1:39:19] confidence father but renew our hearts
[1:39:21] in you and the power of Calvary and Lord
[1:39:24] You're un immutable you have not changed
[1:39:27] and your love for us has not changed
[1:39:29] father that's right so Lord we're
[1:39:31] speaking Lord that your grace would
[1:39:33] apprehend those that have yet to know
[1:39:35] you father Lord that you'd brood out
[1:39:37] over that seed father that you'd Quicken
[1:39:39] it to life and Lord that their desire
[1:39:41] and their heart's desire would be
[1:39:43] gathered in your presence to testify of
[1:39:45] the goodness that touched their lives
[1:39:47] Lord that healing would be manifested
[1:39:49] even now father for those who need your
[1:39:51] healing touch Lord that those who have
[1:39:53] gone astray that you as the seeking
[1:39:55] savior that leaves the 99 and goes to
[1:39:57] the one would go and seek that which is
[1:39:59] lost father Lord that your Holy Spirit
[1:40:01] could touch them where they're at right
[1:40:03] now father for Lord in your light father
[1:40:07] Darkness has to flee Lord this is our
[1:40:09] confidence father that your love has
[1:40:11] conquered all lord it's not even in our
[1:40:14] ability Lord but our trust in you Lord
[1:40:16] and your love for us is what has raised
[1:40:18] our faith up father to ask these things
[1:40:21] Lord and we'll be careful to give you
[1:40:22] the praise the honor and the glory Lord
[1:40:25] as we go from here father may you the be
[1:40:28] the meditation of our heart yes Lord the
[1:40:30] very heartbeat that we have may it be to
[1:40:33] you Lord continue to brood over this
[1:40:36] word that we've heard be with our pastor
[1:40:37] we ask that you keep them in the surgery
[1:40:39] father you'd guide the hand of the
[1:40:41] doctor Lord that where there would be
[1:40:43] the need of uh Sovereign Grace father we
[1:40:47] ask for it Lord we're dependent upon you
