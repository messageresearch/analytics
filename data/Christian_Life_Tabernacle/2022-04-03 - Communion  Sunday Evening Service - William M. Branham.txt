Description:
Sunday Evening Service 
April 03, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

finish the work father and we rejoice in that this evening we ask you to bless our communion service tonight in jesus precious name we pray amen amen if you have your bibles let's open just for a quick uh a reading of a scripture in the gospel of saint john and the very first chapter of john and we're just going to play like i said just 10 minutes of a tape tonight so we want to have some word with our evening service so in the gospel of saint john the first chapter it says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and in him was life and that life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you you may be seated we're going to play just a little portion of the message tonight as we reviewed a little bit this morning as we uh have come down and brother and makes this statement and i want to point it out before we listen to it because he's going to talk about the abstract and there's a difference he's explaining between just a title d in an abstract deed which brings it all the way back to the original so it's kind of like in a way when you get saved you get the title deed of your salvation but when that quickening power comes that's the abstract to that title d so it's been taken back to the beginning so if you just put up there on the board brothers if you would a paragraph of 240 and we just read this and then we will just point out how beautiful he explains he says now notice this quickening power zoe and uh we know that uh he i gave them eternal life eternal life comes from the word zoe which moves it through you and then quickens their even their minds so this quickening power zoe is god and it proves new he says the power of zoe bringing the word the mind that was in christ was in you then so just think that the mind that was in christ was in you then i'm trying to show you that you when you raised up so he's trying to show us when we raised up so we always are looking forward to a resurrection right but i mean this is such so beautiful he says but i'm going to show you when you raised up that's what i'm trying to show you you know because we're in this religious struggle but he's trying to take it beyond that and he says i want to show you something i want to show you when you got raised up when were you raised up now here we come how many years after the lord i guess 2020 years or something i guess if our calendars are right but he's going to say we raised up way before we got here beautiful okay and this is what he says i'm trying to show you that because i'm trying to show you that when you raised i'm trying to show you when you raised up when god raised jesus from the dead he raised up you also when god raised jesus from the dead he raised up you also and also quickened to life with him you are now quickened to life he said although then you were but an attribute in his thoughts but god saw all in him at the finish see when god looked down upon the body so what god saw what was in his mind the attribute he saw the finish of it so we don't see the finish of it you know we see the rough thing and the clay but god sees the finish remember michelangelo he had a vision in his mind and he worked towards that vision until it was perfected and then when it was so perfectly matched the image that he had he said speak he was so inspired and and that's what god is doing he knows what he's bringing forth and remember he's got the power to transform it so even though in our spirits we're still calling for it the reason we're calling for it it's a deep calling to a deed and so he will provide he will perform he will not fail he will not lose a one nothing can pluck you out of the palm of my hand and just listen to how beautiful this goes and then he'll make a statement in here that that jesus how he died as a man so let's just listen to this 10 minutes and then the brothers right towards the end of it they can prepare the communion we'll have communion and foot washing but just look here at how that he sees you and not how you see yourself and then you'll take courage god bless you as we listen to our messenger this quickening power is zoey bringing the word the mind that was in christ within you then i'm trying to show you that you when you um raised when god raised jesus from the dead he raised up you also and also quickens your life with him you are now quick in the life although ben you were but an attribute in his thoughts but god has saw all in him at the finish see when god looked down upon the body the spirit left him in the garden to get something he had to die a man remember friends he didn't have to do that that was god god anointed that flesh which is human pledge and he didn't if peter went up there as god he never died that kind of death didn't kill god but he didn't have to do it but remember he went there with you in him see god had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when god looked down upon the body of christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed that one body see they are one same same word the same word spoke of the groove speaks to the bride well how can the bride come and fail to manifest everything was promised of him and the groom come and he wouldn't be the bride but when he did everything even to prove it by raising himself up from the dead afterwards then don't the bride have to do the same thing has to be exactly what the word said should be in these last days don't you have to return to the military don't you have to be manifested like wasn't the days of sodom don't the world have to be just exactly like it is isn't these things a perfect identification of the word of god made known to us my friends i know i'm keeping a long time 15 minutes just for dinner but maybe i'll get sued by them but notice looking here what a perfect thing it is i don't know when to see he can't see look notice this but god foresaw the bride in the groom hallelujah see to save his wife like adam he had to go with her i didn't know what he was doing eve didn't know what she was doing but adam walked out with his wife see and jesus took his wife's place and became sin for her remember he became you he stood your punishment that you might stand in his place he stood in your place that you might stand in his place what a love what a fellowship how can we do not how can we do anything but love him friends uh to stay on our hours but let's move on with it like uh the pentecostal experience today and the coming of the holy ghost in this last days as promised is like the abstract to a title these days see now you can get a title sure you can get a title to a place but that's still gonna say it's yours no sir somebody way back energy come in and put a claim on it but when you get an abstract that shows that everything is ever against it is struck off coming back from the foundation is that right and when a man has said that he believes the word and then when the holy spirit comes it is the abstract to the title and that gives you permission when you have that abstract that every bit of that belongs to you and everything's on it belongs to you amen and that gives us the abstract when the holy ghost comes upon this title knee that god saw back on her for the foundation of the world and put a name on the book of life but was born to a man and woman and subject to sin and guilty of sin but when i believed on it i received the deed but when the holy ghost come it was the abstract that everything against me whether my mother done it my father done it my grandmother done it like a little epileptic childhood praying for a few minutes ago to come to you from the grandparents therefore if she fell down and upon the time i said but when the abstract has come it struck off omitted everything i'm uh abstract foreign and as sure as the spirit that raised christ from the dead i have an abstract deed that i'm part of that body with the abstract of the holy ghost making that body of word lit up just exactly like it did in here let's be promised the abstract all my sins are struck out all your sins are structured by the blood of jesus christ and the holy ghost has come as an abstract to the title deed that god give me by grace by foreign amen oh my what scared us no wonder he said fear not amen i'm he that was dead and alive again and i'm alive forevermore had the keys of death and hell don't worry about nothing even going to hurt you beautiful let's go right quick now the abstract title the death is settled everything against it has been struck off glory i may act silly but i feel good oh an abstract deed do you realize what that means you realize what that means coming here he says you realize that what that means there is nothing can take it away from you i i didn't i'm sorry brothers i didn't mean to shut you off amen i am a holder amen what a deed i have now cashed in on my beneficiary of his death burial and resurrection he became me that i might become him now he became a sinner that i might become a son amen and hold the abstract deed for these signs shall follow them that believe see the abstract deed but you know over here in paragraph of the brothers go prepare for communion he said over here in paragraph 243 i believe and when a man has said that he believes the word and then when the holy spirit comes it's the abstract to the title and that gives you permission when you have the abstract that every bit that every bit of that belongs to you and everything on it belongs to you amen and gives us the abstract when the holy ghost comes upon this title deed now when did god see that title deed to this title deed that god saw back yonder before the foundations of the world and put its name on the book of life he said though you come through your parents or whatever okay if it's it's and that's what we're communing with tonight we're communing with the understanding i just i just feel kind of so bad for people that are out in in the nominal church world because they they so miss uh the the gospel from the standpoint they they feel that i've got to believe and i've got to do this and i've got to do that and then he said but nobody can come unto me unless the father draws them and he says i've come to redeem my own my sheep know our voice what we've done is we've found ourselves in a world that we don't belong in and that's why we have so much trouble we're in the world but we're not of the world and now he's bringing us back through the spark of the revelation through the sheep offering he's bringing us back all the way back to the beginning of our inheritance and our existence and what we really had title to in the beginning so we're going back i loved how brother branham says it he says we're going back to eden back to eden exactly that's what it is and so if it's just beautiful understanding that along with this great message along with this great move of the spirit of god is him bringing to you the understanding of how secure you are in him from the beginning and that's just so beautiful i know we worry sometimes because we look at ourselves and and we hear it the talk about the holy spirit and we question ourselves whether we have the holy spirit or not but if you're entitled to that deed if he gave you the deed he will give you the abstract and he makes the statement he says you just go ahead and be baptized and he said watch the spirit of god come down and pick you up and put you where you belong so so you know fear not little flock it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and all things that he does he does well so as we have communion now we'll uh oh let's stand and open our bibles and i thought communion falls such in line with the scriptures because the scripture says that first he took the bread which is the word and then he took the wine which was the stimulation of revelation so like one represents the word and the other represents the quickening power and those two coming together puts you in communion with the lord for i have received of the lord that which i also delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take heat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eateth this bread and drinketh this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat carry one for another if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come amen let us all pray together our gracious heavenly father lord we have the bread unleavened bread that represents being not mixed with anything for a little 11 leaveneth the whole lung and father we realize that this is life and that you you are the word and the word is meat indeed father it makes us grow into the statue of a perfect man and we take this communion knowing and remembered of the great price that you died father our messenger just told us you died the man you didn't have to do it but you did it for us and we fellowship with this father knowing that your great purpose is to bring us back to what we were supposed to be in the very beginning when our hearts are thrilled that our names are on that great hook and a father of this wine this cup line that represents your blood father the life that was in the body return back upon the believer father annoying that word and bring it to a resurrected christian a new creation in christ jesus father granted this great work that you're doing the great deliverance nature performing in us the great coming forth father of who that we really are father we ask you to continually bless us through our struggle as we go forward with you your grace is sufficient for us your strength has made perfect and weakness we're grateful for it and we ask you to bless it now in jesus
