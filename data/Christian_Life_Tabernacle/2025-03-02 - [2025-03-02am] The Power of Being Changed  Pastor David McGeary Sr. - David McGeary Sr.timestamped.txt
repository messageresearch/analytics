[54:49] great amen amen let's just bow our heads
[54:52] our gracious father
[54:57] Lord just to think that you so loved us
[55:01] that you paid the price for
[55:05] us Lord and then you opened your word to
[55:08] us that we could live and and we are so
[55:11] grateful for that we ask you to bless us
[55:15] this
[55:15] morning as we Fellowship around your
[55:18] word father we ask you to
[55:21] bless the visitors that may be among us
[55:24] father
[55:27] and all that have come together father
[55:29] they're all your children you know what
[55:31] they have need
[55:33] of and we certainly ask you to touch
[55:36] them that they could walk out and in
[55:38] their hearts say it was good to be in
[55:41] the house of the Lord we ask you to
[55:44] bless us now in jesus' name we pray amen
[55:49] amen God bless you let's open our
[55:52] scriptures and we'll read just a
[55:55] scripture and and then uh we'll uh uh
[56:00] sit down and read some more
[56:02] scriptures okay so uh I i' like to start
[56:06] with John uh 1 John 4 and
[56:10] 17 1 John 4 and 17 and this is uh uh
[56:16] kind of
[56:18] our our theme or if I could say it this
[56:22] way this is our
[56:24] goal um so
[56:26] I think EV every Christian uh should
[56:30] have something that they're striving for
[56:33] uh don't you believe that you know if
[56:36] you don't have something you're striving
[56:38] for then you're you're still but we
[56:43] found out one thing from the word of God
[56:45] that there's no still you're either
[56:48] going forward or you're going backwards
[56:51] so uh uh so that we think it yes it says
[56:56] and and this is what it says in St John
[56:58] uh 4:17 herein is our love made perfect
[57:03] that we may have
[57:05] boldness in the day of judgment because
[57:10] as he is so are we in this world Amen
[57:17] May the father bless his word this
[57:20] precious name we pray amen you may be
[57:22] seated let's just read that next verse
[57:25] for comfort there is no fear in love but
[57:29] perfect love cast out all fear because
[57:33] fear hath torment and he that fearth is
[57:37] not made perfect in love we love him
[57:42] because he first loved us
[57:46] amen amen so we just want to continue on
[57:50] in in the word of the Lord and uh this
[57:54] morning if I uh
[57:56] the what I'd like to entitle this the
[58:00] power of being
[58:02] changed the power of being changed and I
[58:06] thought uh brother Davey uh preached uh
[58:09] Wednesday night such a subject right
[58:12] down along these same lines and it
[58:14] really was a blessing to me and I felt
[58:17] bad for brother Tim this morning because
[58:19] the family was sick but uh he's our
[58:22] Sunday super uh school superintendent
[58:25] and you just saw a pretty good idea of
[58:28] uh all that he's taking care of back
[58:31] there so I want to give a shout out to
[58:33] him he should certainly be proud of all
[58:36] the Sunday School teachers and all their
[58:38] coordination for our young people we
[58:41] have a promise right if we teach them in
[58:43] the way that they'll go you know what I
[58:45] mean and you show them the way they'll
[58:47] return back to it and and uh that's what
[58:51] our desire is for each of our children
[58:55] because I don't know why they just seem
[58:58] to uh uh at that certain age you know I
[59:03] don't know if it's on their 13th
[59:05] birthday or or whatever it is you know
[59:08] they just got that desire to have their
[59:11] own independence and go out and you know
[59:15] we want to keep right on top of them you
[59:17] know CU we don't want them to be like we
[59:19] were you know what I mean so uh so maybe
[59:24] sometimes we get a little hard and
[59:27] a little rigid but we do have a promise
[59:30] that that God gave them to us we gave
[59:33] them back to him and he'll take care of
[59:36] them so uh we are really proud of our
[59:39] Sunday school children well you know um
[59:43] I guess a lot of what's
[59:46] uh
[59:47] transpiring in the things that I'm
[59:50] preaching
[59:52] are maybe a lot of it motivated because
[59:55] of the things that I'm uh personally
[59:59] going through in my life I'm uh I I know
[1:00:04] that I'm I'm going through uh a a cycle
[1:00:10] or a certain time in your life there's
[1:00:13] just periods in your life where things
[1:00:15] make
[1:00:16] changes and uh as you know uh my mother
[1:00:20] uh lived to the grand old age of
[1:00:23] 102 uh I remember taking her to Michigan
[1:00:27] uh when she was 101 years
[1:00:30] old and um so they kept trying to get
[1:00:34] her through
[1:00:37] security and um and they kept coming up
[1:00:41] on the computer she was one year
[1:00:45] old and um you know lesie was there
[1:00:49] saying well no she's not
[1:00:52] one you know she's a hundred and one and
[1:00:57] they wouldn't let her
[1:00:58] through and uh I thought maybe they
[1:01:01] thought she's a
[1:01:02] terrorist but uh she was trying to
[1:01:04] deceive them you know to get in there
[1:01:06] and do something so back they went and
[1:01:10] back they went and finally somebody
[1:01:12] there came and and walked her through
[1:01:15] you know but nobody wanted to make a
[1:01:19] decision you know what it me nobody
[1:01:21] wanted to take on any
[1:01:24] responsibility and uh
[1:01:26] uh just uh simple things uh I I I and uh
[1:01:32] so we're in the process now of selling
[1:01:36] my mother's house so I've had to make a
[1:01:39] few trips to California to sell my
[1:01:43] mother's house and I realized that I'm
[1:01:46] coming to an end of an eror in my
[1:01:52] life that that when
[1:01:56] and you know we went out there and we
[1:01:58] just sat around the house you know me
[1:02:00] and my brothers and sisters we all grew
[1:02:03] up there and we would we would go over
[1:02:09] uh all kinds of thoughts in our mind how
[1:02:12] can we keep this house and and we don't
[1:02:14] want to let it go and you know but you
[1:02:18] know we we can't live in two places you
[1:02:21] know and I think well you know maybe I
[1:02:23] could retire and just move out to San
[1:02:27] Diego and just live in my mom's house
[1:02:30] you know then of course my brother says
[1:02:33] well yeah give me my part and you can do
[1:02:36] that you know
[1:02:37] I I thought we'd all just keep the house
[1:02:40] you know and and so I realize that
[1:02:45] that when that
[1:02:50] transpires that whole world is gone to
[1:02:54] me
[1:02:56] uh I lost my father and it and I
[1:03:00] remember
[1:03:02] uh all the connections that uh I had I
[1:03:06] remember in my life I always knew uh
[1:03:10] even though I was you know 50 years old
[1:03:14] I I always knew in my heart I could go
[1:03:17] to my dad you know what I mean if
[1:03:20] something uh I had a financial situation
[1:03:23] or something or I got in some bad
[1:03:26] trouble I knew my dad would be there for
[1:03:28] me and I remember going down the road
[1:03:31] and realizing that wasn't there anymore
[1:03:34] for me
[1:03:45] and I remember the day and I
[1:03:48] just stopped and I looked up and I
[1:03:52] said I'm so glad I still have you my
[1:03:55] heaven L
[1:03:56] father you know what I mean and I lost
[1:03:59] my Earthly connection but it brought me
[1:04:01] closer to my heavenly
[1:04:05] connection and I I I knew I still had a
[1:04:09] father God used that father for a season
[1:04:13] to give me that Comfort but now that
[1:04:16] that was gone I had to go to another
[1:04:20] place to find that Comfort to find that
[1:04:23] peace you know to to find that security
[1:04:27] and and I I believe that that there's a
[1:04:31] reason that all these things has
[1:04:34] happened I mean I my mother lived long
[1:04:38] Beyond normal and you normally go
[1:04:41] through these things a lot earlier but
[1:04:44] uh just going through th these things
[1:04:46] and and a lot of things have been
[1:04:49] transpired transpiring in me physically
[1:04:52] uh with my age and and so I realized
[1:04:56] that there there there's a lot of
[1:04:58] changes taking place in me and it's
[1:05:01] brought me
[1:05:03] to uh that message God's power to change
[1:05:08] that God's power to transform and that's
[1:05:12] what transformation is it means to
[1:05:15] change something from what it
[1:05:18] is to something
[1:05:21] else and as we as we begin to preach on
[1:05:28] um this
[1:05:30] subject um we realize that all
[1:05:34] creation is based on
[1:05:37] change it's it's based on change and so
[1:05:42] let's just go back while you're seated
[1:05:45] and read a a few more uh uh scriptures
[1:05:50] found in Romans the eth chapter and uh
[1:05:55] uh
[1:05:56] Romans 8 is a great chapter to
[1:06:00] continually go back and read to fortify
[1:06:06] yourself and uh uh uh make strong your
[1:06:10] foundation because this is what we're
[1:06:13] built on and it's got great uh
[1:06:16] scriptures in here like for the carnal
[1:06:19] mind is death but the spiritual mind is
[1:06:24] life and peace
[1:06:26] so uh uh so we want to draw this
[1:06:29] contrast there's a spiritual mind
[1:06:32] there's a carnal
[1:06:33] mind right and so we always have these
[1:06:38] two every Revival has
[1:06:41] twins every uh the garden there was
[1:06:44] twins Jesus and Judas Jacob and Esau you
[1:06:49] go all down through the time you will
[1:06:51] always see right or wrong good or evil
[1:06:54] light and dark Ness you know uh sin and
[1:06:59] and righteousness you know fear and
[1:07:02] faith love and hate it there there's
[1:07:05] always a two things side by
[1:07:10] side and if you could use that thought
[1:07:14] two
[1:07:16] opinions there's two ways of looking at
[1:07:19] things two paths to
[1:07:22] take you know we sing that song I
[1:07:25] believe there's two paths that you can
[1:07:28] take one by sight and one by faith so we
[1:07:34] have these two great paths we have these
[1:07:37] two opposing forces we have these two
[1:07:41] things and it's always it always uh lies
[1:07:46] there and the the worst place a person
[1:07:52] can be is to be halted between two
[1:07:56] opinions you understand like halt you
[1:07:59] know if a guy if you're walking on a
[1:08:01] military base maybe Philip and some of
[1:08:04] our old Soldiers remember this brother
[1:08:07] Jerome if somebody said Hal what did you
[1:08:10] do yes sir yes sir you
[1:08:15] stopped you know cuz if it was a
[1:08:19] Watchman you know he he had a
[1:08:23] rifle you know I worked in some top
[1:08:26] secret areas in the government uh when
[1:08:29] they were designing the moon rover and
[1:08:31] when they were testing the the U2 plane
[1:08:35] the one that flew and took things and I
[1:08:38] worked in the photo lab that developed
[1:08:40] the the the Spy films and everything and
[1:08:44] they told us if somebody says
[1:08:48] halt immediately
[1:08:51] stop and so if and that's what if you
[1:08:55] you say halted that means you got you're
[1:08:59] Frozen between two
[1:09:03] opinions okay so you're
[1:09:06] paralyzed and therefore if you become
[1:09:09] paralyzed you're not moving you're not
[1:09:12] going for uncertainty does that to you
[1:09:15] you know which voice is Right which path
[1:09:18] is right and and you come there it it's
[1:09:22] like uh sitting at a restaurant with
[1:09:25] somebody that can't make up their mind
[1:09:27] what to eat you know you know just order
[1:09:31] something and if you don't like it we'll
[1:09:34] buy something else but at least get my
[1:09:36] order in you you know what I'm saying so
[1:09:39] okay I want you to get that established
[1:09:42] in your
[1:09:43] mind that the
[1:09:46] poison is to be
[1:09:49] stopped
[1:09:51] right okay so he he makes this little in
[1:09:55] the sixth verse one is and but the
[1:09:59] spiritual mind is life and peace but the
[1:10:02] carnal mind is imity against God for it
[1:10:06] is not subject to the law of God neither
[1:10:08] can it be and then we read down the 11th
[1:10:12] verse it says but if the spirit of him
[1:10:15] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:10:18] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:10:23] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:10:25] also Quicken your mortal bodies by his
[1:10:29] spirit that dwelleth in you therefore
[1:10:33] brethren we are debtors not to the flesh
[1:10:38] to live after the
[1:10:40] flesh so we have two spirit man right
[1:10:44] and we have Spirit man we are not
[1:10:48] debtors to the
[1:10:51] flesh we owe
[1:10:53] nothing to to the fleshly man we owe
[1:10:57] nothing to the carnal
[1:11:00] mind we owe
[1:11:02] nothing
[1:11:04] to carnal thinking or the
[1:11:08] world now the world wants us to think
[1:11:11] that we owe them something they like to
[1:11:13] think that they're providing for you but
[1:11:16] let me tell you what the spiritual mind
[1:11:18] says I've never seen a righteous man beg
[1:11:23] bread you know
[1:11:25] the father look consider the lies of the
[1:11:28] field how they neither toil nor nor
[1:11:31] snare or or or spin or so consider them
[1:11:36] the birds of the air and yet the father
[1:11:38] taketh care of them aren't you so much
[1:11:41] greater than they are and so you you you
[1:11:45] have to understand that you can't get
[1:11:48] stuck in between two opinions you can't
[1:11:51] get stuck under two Pathways this is is
[1:11:55] an hour more than ever that you've got
[1:11:58] to move
[1:12:00] forward and it said
[1:12:02] so uh for if we live after the flesh you
[1:12:07] shall
[1:12:08] die but through the spirit if you
[1:12:11] mortify the Deeds of the body you shall
[1:12:14] live for as many as are led by the
[1:12:19] spirit of God they are the sons of
[1:12:23] God You' got to choose
[1:12:26] whom you're going to
[1:12:28] serve the prophet said you choose this
[1:12:30] day who you're going to serve but as for
[1:12:33] me in my house we're going to serve the
[1:12:37] Lord well you don't make that choice if
[1:12:40] you don't fully believe in the
[1:12:43] benefits Satan got Eve to Halt between
[1:12:47] two
[1:12:48] opinions what he
[1:12:51] said and what God Said
[1:12:55] and that battle is still going on today
[1:12:59] Satan uses the same tactics on every
[1:13:02] believer that he used on
[1:13:07] Eve God says something he SS something
[1:13:12] else and he tries to paralyze you
[1:13:16] between those two thoughts and they're
[1:13:20] so close sometimes together that you
[1:13:24] will waste in
[1:13:25] eternity trying to
[1:13:29] uh trying to decipher
[1:13:34] it we're trying to make sense out of it
[1:13:37] trying to fit it
[1:13:40] together so we don't want again we want
[1:13:44] to not be
[1:13:45] stuck he
[1:13:47] said for we have not received the spirit
[1:13:50] of bondage again to fear
[1:13:59] but ye have received the spirit of
[1:14:02] adoption whereby we cry ABA
[1:14:06] father the spirit itself bearing witness
[1:14:09] with our spirit that we are the children
[1:14:14] of God and if children then heirs Heirs
[1:14:19] of God and Joint hires with Christ if so
[1:14:24] be that we suffer with him that we may
[1:14:27] also be glorified together for I reckon
[1:14:30] that the suffering of this present times
[1:14:33] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:14:36] glory which shall be revealed in
[1:14:38] US amen and then we could drop down to
[1:14:41] the 22nd verse it says so we we see in
[1:14:46] that verse that there's suffering and
[1:14:48] there's heartaches and there's trials
[1:14:51] because we have these two worlds that
[1:14:55] that we live
[1:14:56] in I I believe I I been I tried to put
[1:15:01] it in a visual form for us by saying we
[1:15:04] have two
[1:15:06] puzzles right and the and there's in in
[1:15:10] these two puzzles there's two pictures
[1:15:14] and I could put it like this way there
[1:15:16] were the puzzles were pictures of
[1:15:20] Eden one puzzle was the
[1:15:25] God's Eden the other puzzle was Satan's
[1:15:30] Eden and they both had
[1:15:34] pieces but what happened was is
[1:15:38] that the piece puzzle pieces got mixed
[1:15:44] together and and everybody's been and
[1:15:47] only one picture was
[1:15:50] presented and that was Satan's
[1:15:53] Eden but now in our
[1:15:56] day the seals were open the Mysteries
[1:16:00] were uh made known and the prophet of
[1:16:04] God put it this way he says now God's
[1:16:06] mindful of us again so he chose in this
[1:16:11] day to reveal H the first Eden to us and
[1:16:17] let us know that we are not pieces of
[1:16:23] Satan's Eden but we are pieces of God's
[1:16:28] picture his
[1:16:31] Eden so we we understand that there's a
[1:16:35] battle between that because we are born
[1:16:38] in sin came is shaped iniquity came in
[1:16:41] the world speaking lies our flesh has
[1:16:46] contact through five senses and
[1:16:49] emotional sensus is to this world but
[1:16:53] God gave us a six s
[1:16:56] which was
[1:16:59] faith that we could believe what he said
[1:17:03] because the Bible is a book of
[1:17:06] promises and if you if
[1:17:09] you if something's promised to to
[1:17:13] you then you hope for
[1:17:16] it hope isn't
[1:17:18] bad you look for
[1:17:21] it you you're in expectation
[1:17:25] of its
[1:17:27] coming but if you
[1:17:32] doubt and you doubt that that promis is
[1:17:35] to
[1:17:36] you and you doubt that that promis is
[1:17:39] for
[1:17:41] you that's all satan needs to
[1:17:49] do to get you to miss it to get you to
[1:17:54] stop
[1:17:56] and not go forward into the
[1:18:02] promise not take the promise and let it
[1:18:05] change
[1:18:07] you and so he says he goes on he says
[1:18:12] for now we know the the whole creation
[1:18:15] granth and travaileth in pain together
[1:18:19] till now and not only they but ourselves
[1:18:25] also which have the first fruits of the
[1:18:28] spirit even we ourselves grown within
[1:18:32] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[1:18:35] wit the redemptions of our
[1:18:39] bodies so you got to see the early
[1:18:41] church is is
[1:18:44] suffering through all the anxieties and
[1:18:48] pain of living in this Eden longing for
[1:18:54] that chain so much that they even cried
[1:18:57] out even so come quickly Lord
[1:19:04] Jesus and they begin to question where
[1:19:07] is the sign of his coming where is his
[1:19:11] appearing see they're always trying to
[1:19:13] get you uh to reason always trying to
[1:19:18] get you to consider always trying to
[1:19:20] hold you in that middle ground
[1:19:25] what
[1:19:26] if that's what Satan said
[1:19:29] surely you won't
[1:19:33] die
[1:19:36] considered
[1:19:38] reason and if he can get you in that
[1:19:41] spot of reasoning then he stopped
[1:19:48] you you can't go forward
[1:19:56] and and so let's just finish real quick
[1:19:59] he said he says for we are saved by
[1:20:06] hope but hope that is seen is not hope
[1:20:11] for when a man seeth why does he yet
[1:20:14] hope for
[1:20:16] it but if we hope for that what we see
[1:20:21] not then do we with patience
[1:20:25] wait for
[1:20:29] it oh that's a sermon right there hold
[1:20:33] on be certain of God if he promised it
[1:20:38] you can hope for it and if you have hope
[1:20:42] then you'll wait with patience for it
[1:20:45] amen they work
[1:20:48] together likewise the spirit also
[1:20:51] helpeth our infirmities for we know not
[1:20:54] what we we should pray for as we ought
[1:20:57] but the spirit itself maketh
[1:20:59] intercession for us with groanings which
[1:21:03] cannot be uttered for he that searcheth
[1:21:06] the heart knoweth what is the mind of
[1:21:10] the spirit because he maketh
[1:21:13] intercession for the Saints according to
[1:21:17] the will of God and we know that all
[1:21:21] things work together for a good to them
[1:21:24] that love God to them who are the
[1:21:30] called we read that sometimes and we
[1:21:34] say uh you know all things work together
[1:21:37] for the good to them that are called or
[1:21:41] you know but just just uh it it's so
[1:21:45] beautiful he says we know that all
[1:21:47] things work together for the good to
[1:21:50] them that love God to them who
[1:21:56] to them
[1:21:59] who are you
[1:22:02] who I'm
[1:22:04] who
[1:22:11] Amen to them who
[1:22:14] are
[1:22:15] the
[1:22:18] called according to his
[1:22:21] purpose for whom he did for know
[1:22:25] he also did
[1:22:27] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:22:31] image of his son that he might be the
[1:22:37] first fruits among many
[1:22:41] Brethren amen I wanted to continue
[1:22:43] reading but we'll stop there this
[1:22:47] morning so we realize that the calling
[1:22:51] of God had a purpose and the purpose
[1:22:54] purpose is that we be
[1:22:57] conformed or
[1:23:00] transformed into the image of his
[1:23:05] son now let me say this Satan does not
[1:23:08] want you to stop
[1:23:13] believing okay he doesn't care if you
[1:23:17] stop
[1:23:18] [Music]
[1:23:20] believing but what he wants to stop
[1:23:25] and he wants you to stop
[1:23:29] transforming he wants you to stop
[1:23:32] changing he you know he that that's what
[1:23:36] that he wants to stop so he doesn't want
[1:23:40] to stop you from believing he doesn't
[1:23:43] want to as we preached last uh Sunday he
[1:23:48] doesn't care if you
[1:23:50] recognize but we want to go beyond
[1:23:53] recognition
[1:23:55] so in other words there's a
[1:23:59] purpose of our
[1:24:01] election or if we could say that there's
[1:24:04] a purpose that the seed of God is in us
[1:24:09] and so we know that God put everything
[1:24:12] in
[1:24:12] us to be
[1:24:16] successful everything that you need to
[1:24:19] be successful is in you
[1:24:25] and a few Sundays ago we ministered
[1:24:28] that there we found out that all the
[1:24:33] keys to success remember the two Edens
[1:24:37] so Satan wants you to be successful in
[1:24:40] his Eden God wants you to be successful
[1:24:44] in his
[1:24:45] Eden they both have
[1:24:50] power if you can have a carnal mind
[1:24:55] you can be very
[1:24:58] powerful in this present
[1:25:01] world they're all talking now about oh
[1:25:06] you know who's smart and who's not and
[1:25:09] Eline musk is the smartest man in the
[1:25:12] world let me tell you if you've accepted
[1:25:15] the Lord Jesus Christ you are a whole
[1:25:18] lot
[1:25:22] smarter right
[1:25:26] you know they they want to shoot a man
[1:25:29] to
[1:25:32] Mars they can have
[1:25:36] Mars the only Mars I ever wanted was in
[1:25:39] a little
[1:25:41] rapper do they still make the old Mars
[1:25:48] Bar come
[1:25:51] on what man calls great God calls
[1:25:59] foolish I I'm going to I'm going to blow
[1:26:02] past
[1:26:03] Mars and Saturn and every other place
[1:26:07] I'm going to a land Beyond a river I'm
[1:26:10] going to a supernatural Kingdom I am an
[1:26:13] original
[1:26:15] astronaut you know I I am not even of
[1:26:18] this world I'm just so joury down here
[1:26:22] that God might manifest all his
[1:26:24] wonderful attributes in me and and I I
[1:26:28] I'm just I'm sorry uh I don't have a a
[1:26:33] need to build a kingdom
[1:26:37] here but
[1:26:40] Satan he wanted a kingdom is that right
[1:26:45] this is this is what this is how the uh
[1:26:49] prophet of God described that uh like
[1:26:53] this he said
[1:26:54] uh see if I can find that the
[1:26:57] statement real quick I always have these
[1:27:00] statements and then when I go to look
[1:27:01] for them I can't find them so uh that's
[1:27:05] part of that age difficulty that I'm I'm
[1:27:08] telling you about so
[1:27:12] uh well anyway brother BM says that uh
[1:27:17] but Satan wanted to start start his
[1:27:20] edting so he he came down and and he's
[1:27:25] he's wanted to build his
[1:27:28] Eden is that right so he he since he
[1:27:32] couldn't
[1:27:33] create he could only deform or pervert
[1:27:38] so he took every
[1:27:41] principle for
[1:27:43] success and remember we went through
[1:27:45] them in the scripture we we give what
[1:27:48] they said was a principle for success
[1:27:51] and then we go over and find that
[1:27:52] scripture in the word of God
[1:27:55] but one's using it for one
[1:27:58] Kingdom and one's using it for the other
[1:28:02] one is taking the glory for himself the
[1:28:05] other is giving the glory to the Lord
[1:28:09] and so that's what Satan did is he came
[1:28:12] down here to build his Eden that he
[1:28:15] might exalt himself oh I just wish I
[1:28:19] could uh find that uh
[1:28:24] statement because the prophet of God
[1:28:26] puts it so uh
[1:28:29] beautifully uh in the word of
[1:28:32] God here he says so Satan's purpose from
[1:28:36] Eden was to make his own
[1:28:39] Eden to exalt himself above so the stars
[1:28:44] of God would worship Him Sons would
[1:28:49] worship him and he has absolutely
[1:28:52] carried it out now
[1:28:54] and when he's done this he brought it
[1:28:58] into the
[1:29:01] church so that was his purpose is to
[1:29:05] build an Eden and so we found out that
[1:29:08] God put
[1:29:09] everything in his
[1:29:12] son to be
[1:29:14] successful but when he created you he
[1:29:17] didn't create you in your full
[1:29:21] Perfection he put a seed in you
[1:29:25] and that seed in you the whole
[1:29:29] law of
[1:29:31] creation is
[1:29:35] transformation the plan of creation was
[1:29:39] seed to
[1:29:41] fruit seed to
[1:29:44] maturity that was how that God placed it
[1:29:48] and so we see even in Civilization right
[1:29:52] from horse and buggy to walking to horse
[1:29:55] and buggy to to a carriage to a car uh
[1:30:00] to plane to Rocket and on so all those
[1:30:06] things are always
[1:30:10] here but as civilization
[1:30:14] grew
[1:30:16] and
[1:30:18] man uh begin
[1:30:20] to want to be more
[1:30:26] successful they begin to
[1:30:29] search and they they they looked at
[1:30:32] science and they look at
[1:30:35] civilization and they looked at
[1:30:37] education and Satan be to build his
[1:30:43] Eden he begin to he begin to uh uh these
[1:30:50] these
[1:30:51] characteristics that God had put in man
[1:30:55] man begin to tap on those things but use
[1:31:00] them for the wrong
[1:31:02] thing but what we understand is we
[1:31:05] understand that that
[1:31:08] the the
[1:31:10] whole
[1:31:12] picture of
[1:31:15] creation is
[1:31:19] change is transformation
[1:31:24] right have you ever seen a a tomato what
[1:31:28] they call a
[1:31:30] set it's a little
[1:31:32] teeny
[1:31:35] dinky thing that comes in a little cup
[1:31:40] and you can go buy them in
[1:31:43] trays I probably maybe the Tomato
[1:31:46] Farmers amongst us anybody grow
[1:31:50] tomatoes nobody grows tomatoes
[1:31:56] I'm glad I got a friend that grows
[1:31:58] Tomatoes cuz he brings us some of the
[1:32:00] best
[1:32:01] tomatoes but you put out it's a little
[1:32:04] square thing and you put it in your
[1:32:06] house and it grows and it gets bigger
[1:32:08] and you take it out well it didn't
[1:32:13] start you didn't start with
[1:32:17] tomatoes but when you put that little
[1:32:19] seed in the ground you looked at that
[1:32:23] and you believe there was tomatoes in
[1:32:27] that now can you imagine looking at this
[1:32:30] little twig and say look at my
[1:32:34] tomatoes but they're
[1:32:37] there the prophet of God said every
[1:32:40] fruit that that tree would ever bring
[1:32:43] forth was in that
[1:32:50] seed everything everyone was in there
[1:32:53] and and that seed had within itself the
[1:32:58] power to transform itself from what God
[1:33:03] created it to be to carry out the
[1:33:07] intentions of and purpose of what God
[1:33:10] put
[1:33:13] there it didn't have to go
[1:33:17] outside God provided the water he
[1:33:19] provided the Sun and provided the Earth
[1:33:23] he provided everything for that seed to
[1:33:28] go he put all that into place before he
[1:33:31] put the seed there now that seed has
[1:33:35] within
[1:33:36] itself the
[1:33:38] power to
[1:33:42] transform into what God wanted it to be
[1:33:47] is that right so we we understand that
[1:33:51] that's that's what the the the great
[1:33:55] understanding is of the
[1:33:57] believer now Satan knows that about
[1:34:02] you so he's not trying to keep you from
[1:34:07] believing he's trying to keep you from
[1:34:13] changing from
[1:34:16] transforming to move into that
[1:34:20] fruit that you're supposed to bear
[1:34:25] and and have you ever walked through a
[1:34:28] bunch of tomatoes as they begin to
[1:34:33] mature all kinds of things start showing
[1:34:35] up on them have you ever seen one of
[1:34:38] them big
[1:34:40] fat I I don't know what they're called
[1:34:42] they potato worms or whatever they are
[1:34:46] they're big ugly gigantic fat
[1:34:50] little cat uh caterpillar
[1:34:54] creatures some of you
[1:34:57] know they show
[1:35:00] up and and little MIT show up and little
[1:35:05] holes start coming in the leaves and and
[1:35:08] grasshoppers come and it goes through
[1:35:11] all kinds of
[1:35:15] suffering but it doesn't say oh I got a
[1:35:18] great big caterpillar sucking on me a
[1:35:21] great big slug a great Big Worm I'm
[1:35:24] going to quit producing
[1:35:30] Tomatoes it doesn't say oh my tomato
[1:35:33] plant isn't perfect and every leaf isn't
[1:35:36] perfect and and and everything isn't
[1:35:40] exactly the way that it should be I
[1:35:43] guess I'm just not going to produce
[1:35:45] Tomatoes it'll produce
[1:35:49] Tomatoes I don't care how bad it looks
[1:35:56] the journey the plan of
[1:35:58] creation is from seed to
[1:36:05] fruit and that tomato plant will
[1:36:10] struggle through every one of those
[1:36:12] sufferings through every one of those
[1:36:15] challenges it'll continually work
[1:36:18] towards producing that tomato because
[1:36:22] that's what it was created to
[1:36:27] do and Satan's trying to do in type to
[1:36:33] try to do everything he can do to keep
[1:36:35] that thing from producing
[1:36:41] Tomatoes just think of it if you can
[1:36:46] understand that everything that's going
[1:36:49] on in the world the natural is a type of
[1:36:52] the spiritual
[1:36:55] every struggle every challenge
[1:36:58] everything that you meet and you battle
[1:37:01] is because of these two
[1:37:05] Edens because Satan is trying to put
[1:37:10] into us and stop
[1:37:14] us from
[1:37:17] transforming into the image of his son
[1:37:24] because there there's
[1:37:27] power with
[1:37:33] change
[1:37:36] overcoming really is the
[1:37:41] change it's almost a change that takes
[1:37:44] place in your
[1:37:51] mind it it you you know when when you
[1:37:55] overcome you you come down see if I can
[1:37:58] find that one I had it marked but my
[1:38:01] little thing fell out of my
[1:38:10] book oh I can just preach to you you
[1:38:12] guys can go home and read it you already
[1:38:15] read
[1:38:16] it right what did the prophet of God say
[1:38:19] he said if you think this world is good
[1:38:22] and you and you like the Fashions of the
[1:38:25] world and you like the things of this
[1:38:27] world and you like this Kingdom and you
[1:38:30] like the science and you like the
[1:38:32] civilization he says your thinking is
[1:38:37] wrong that's right and that's where the
[1:38:41] battle is the battle is to get us to be
[1:38:44] halted between two opinions stuck
[1:38:47] between two voices to to one is to uh uh
[1:38:53] and Satan is is still telling us if you
[1:38:55] do this if you do this if you be like
[1:38:58] this if you do this you'll be
[1:39:01] successful I hear so many people say I
[1:39:04] need to be a better businessman I need
[1:39:07] to go take business classes I need to
[1:39:10] find yourself
[1:39:12] success no you
[1:39:16] don't you tell me one
[1:39:19] thing that education can do that Faith
[1:39:30] can't tell me one
[1:39:36] thing he said all things are possible to
[1:39:40] them that
[1:39:41] believe I will not leave you I'll not
[1:39:44] forsake you but I'll be with you even in
[1:39:47] you till the end I'll keep
[1:39:50] you a Shepherd looks after his flock
[1:39:55] he keeps things out of your life that's
[1:39:57] not good for
[1:40:00] you I remember a man sat down with me
[1:40:02] one time he said brother mcgar I've been
[1:40:06] spiritually blessed here I said I'm glad
[1:40:09] brother I'm I got married here I raised
[1:40:13] my children here but I've never had
[1:40:15] financial
[1:40:21] success so I'm going to
[1:40:25] move to where I can be financially
[1:40:31] successful I said why would you want to
[1:40:33] do
[1:40:35] that don't you know the love of money is
[1:40:38] the root of all
[1:40:40] evil don't you know it's harder for a
[1:40:42] rich man to enter the Kingdom of
[1:40:47] Heaven don't you know that he who builds
[1:40:50] his treasures up here is attached to
[1:40:53] those treasures and tries to protect
[1:40:56] those
[1:40:57] treasures and he doesn't want to lose
[1:41:00] them don't you know that's
[1:41:03] poison to your
[1:41:06] mind we don't need more
[1:41:09] education we don't need no more
[1:41:12] money we need more
[1:41:18] faith we need to take God at his word
[1:41:25] and Satan will do everything he
[1:41:31] can to
[1:41:33] transform
[1:41:34] [Music]
[1:41:36] belief into
[1:41:39] Power that's what he's trying to
[1:41:45] stop he's glad you believe William Mary
[1:41:47] and Brandon was the prophet of God he's
[1:41:50] glad that you believe that he fulfilled
[1:41:53] Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 and Revelations
[1:41:58] 10:7 he knows that he did
[1:42:05] that he's not opposed to
[1:42:09] that he's opposed to the
[1:42:13] effect that that will have on
[1:42:16] you if you allow it to transform you
[1:42:24] Satan's afraid of your
[1:42:32] change because as you
[1:42:37] grow and as you
[1:42:40] change your possibilities
[1:42:49] increase you take baseball
[1:42:53] you can look at a great baseball player
[1:42:57] today one
[1:43:00] time he was out there as a
[1:43:04] peeeeeee
[1:43:09] player you know out in the Outfield I've
[1:43:11] seen them throw their glove out and sit
[1:43:14] down and draw circles
[1:43:16] and and the parents are going get up get
[1:43:20] ready
[1:43:27] they got girl showed up for game in a
[1:43:30] ballerina
[1:43:39] Tootsie that that if
[1:43:42] that
[1:43:44] person had the talent in them the talent
[1:43:48] was
[1:43:49] there but it had to change
[1:43:53] and as it got
[1:43:56] older it
[1:43:58] changed and as it changed the
[1:44:01] possibilities became
[1:44:03] greater he saw better he ran quicker he
[1:44:06] did that he grew into all those
[1:44:11] things and all he had to do was fight
[1:44:14] through the
[1:44:16] opposition fight through the injuries
[1:44:19] fight through the Mind battles fight
[1:44:21] through the pain but if he had that
[1:44:24] ability in him it was always
[1:44:28] there you have the ability in you to be
[1:44:32] like
[1:44:41] Jesus that's our
[1:44:48] goal
[1:44:51] look okay Satan is always
[1:44:55] going to accuse
[1:44:59] you he's the accuser of the
[1:45:03] Brethren he's always going to point his
[1:45:05] finger at you he's always going to bring
[1:45:07] something up he's always going to bring
[1:45:10] to your remembrance things that you did
[1:45:14] it's what he
[1:45:16] does he always is going to accuse you of
[1:45:20] being a sinner
[1:45:23] of being
[1:45:24] short of being
[1:45:27] why because if you
[1:45:30] change the world around you
[1:45:35] changes when you change what you
[1:45:37] perceive
[1:45:42] changes it's like the first day on a
[1:45:45] job you don't know where anything is you
[1:45:48] feel out of
[1:45:49] place you're looking for something to do
[1:45:53] nobody's really got time for
[1:45:56] you now you just don't say nobody loves
[1:45:59] me I'm going to quit this
[1:46:03] job you'll be looking for a job all your
[1:46:06] life you got to what grow into the
[1:46:11] job you find your place you get an
[1:46:15] understanding of how things work and
[1:46:17] every time you get you get a a change
[1:46:23] that whole job changes for you and the
[1:46:27] possibilities change for you and then
[1:46:29] you're saying I can do this and pretty
[1:46:32] soon you're saying I can run this
[1:46:34] company and pretty soon you're saying I
[1:46:36] can start my own
[1:46:39] company because

[1:46:45] you changes the world around you
[1:46:53] you understand that change in your
[1:46:56] heart change in your nature changeing
[1:47:00] your mind will change the world that
[1:47:04] you're living
[1:47:08] in it'll change
[1:47:12] everything as you
[1:47:15] transform things around you transform
[1:47:25] as

[1:47:29] more like
[1:47:32] him you get more to the place the works
[1:47:36] that I do shall you do
[1:47:41] also as you
[1:47:44] change and become more like him the
[1:47:48] possibility of the
[1:47:50] supernatural becomes more real to
[1:47:57] you cuz all
[1:48:01] creation was built on
[1:48:04] change it started from void and dark and
[1:48:08] he moved upon it and changed
[1:48:11] it and then he divided he changed it he
[1:48:15] changed night and day everything is
[1:48:17] change change transformation
[1:48:23] and if God ever does one thing one way
[1:48:26] he has to continually to do
[1:48:30] it so it never was I'm going to accept
[1:48:34] the Lord Jesus as my savior and I'm
[1:48:36] going to step up and now I'm born saved
[1:48:38] sealed and
[1:48:41] everything you're in seed
[1:48:46] form and you're
[1:48:49] growing the word's in there but the
[1:48:52] spirit's what quickening
[1:48:55] it the quickening of the spirit is not
[1:48:59] an anointing
[1:49:05] feeling the quickening of the
[1:49:08] spirit is not an
[1:49:11] Enlightenment the quickening of the
[1:49:13] spirit is a change to your
[1:49:19] nature and as you change the the world
[1:49:23] changes around
[1:49:25] you here's this person over
[1:49:28] here and I guess JJ this is your seat so
[1:49:33] this is nothing personal but I can't
[1:49:35] stand this
[1:49:37] guy I don't like the way he plays I
[1:49:41] don't like the way he sits I don't like
[1:49:43] the color of his hair I don't like those
[1:49:46] big beautiful brown eyes I don't like
[1:49:48] those bushy
[1:49:49] eyebrows just can't stand them
[1:49:53] my goodness how did he get on the
[1:49:54] platform and I'm the
[1:50:01] pastor
[1:50:03] oh but you let the spirit
[1:50:05] Quicken something in your
[1:50:10] heart and all of a sudden JJ
[1:50:16] changes did JJ
[1:50:21] change no my whole world
[1:50:27] changed I come
[1:50:30] out the door over there and I come over
[1:50:33] here and uh of course Joy's not with us
[1:50:36] I I I come up here and I thought my
[1:50:38] goodness
[1:50:39] gracious man this guy's dressed sharp
[1:50:42] today you know he's going to have an eye
[1:50:46] of a lady on him pretty
[1:50:51] quick fact he might might just have
[1:50:53] somebody in mind already maybe he knows
[1:50:56] they're watching this
[1:50:59] morning your world

[1:51:20] same nothing has ch changed but
[1:51:23] everything has
[1:51:27] changed your whole
[1:51:30] world
[1:51:33] changes and with change comes
[1:51:42] power you understand that God has the
[1:51:46] power to make the change but when the
[1:51:50] change is made
[1:51:53] you are indued with the power that made
[1:51:58] the
[1:52:01] change do you understand that when the
[1:52:04] change takes
[1:52:06] place in that fruit the life that came
[1:52:10] up from that tree now that life has gone
[1:52:14] into the fruit the power that brought it
[1:52:18] from seed to fruit is now in the
[1:52:25] fruit that's why Satan don't want you to
[1:52:30] change he knows God's got the power to
[1:52:37] transform but he knows if you let that
[1:52:42] power change
[1:52:46] you now you possess the power that

[1:53:00] spirit of God you possess that spirit
[1:53:02] that changed you

[1:53:13] fighting we're fighting against powers
[1:53:15] and principalities and spiritual
[1:53:19] wickedness in high places you know what
[1:53:22] we're fighting against we're fighting

[1:54:06] written on the Lamb's Book of
[1:54:09] Life did you know
[1:54:12] that before there ever was a star in the
[1:54:15] sky God knew
[1:54:16] you he knew
[1:54:19] you he saw the color of your hair
[1:54:24] or the color of the sides of your
[1:54:28] head he saw every bit of it the statue
[1:54:32] would come in the shape you would be
[1:54:33] here he knew you
[1:54:39] van and then in his thinking he planted
[1:54:45] you right the word that produced the
[1:54:48] seed the seed was in the word and the
[1:54:51] word spoke and it came to play but he
[1:54:54] didn't put you here in the form that he
[1:54:56] saw you he put you in your great great
[1:55:02] grandfather is that right and he went
[1:55:05] and got your great great grandmother and
[1:55:08] arranged for him to meet your great
[1:55:10] great grandfather and they me and then
[1:55:13] your parents meant and then here you are
[1:55:16] God orchestrated all that to get you

[1:55:33] predestination you're not saved from
[1:55:36] this

[1:55:42] lie that said that you're not the Sons
[1:55:45] and Daughters of God you always were the
[1:55:49] sons and daughters of God
[1:55:54] but the lie was you never can make it
[1:55:58] you never can
[1:56:01] mature you were born in sin I'm going to
[1:56:06] keep
[1:56:08] keep
[1:56:10] uh showing you all your failures all
[1:56:14] your
[1:56:15] faults all your
[1:56:18] misery I'm going to get keep keeping
[1:56:20] your eyes
[1:56:23] and all your doubts and all your fears
[1:56:26] CU if you
[1:56:28] ever get a hold of the
[1:56:33] fact that you're a
[1:56:36] predestinated child of
[1:56:40] God and you accept that
[1:56:44] change Satan's got
[1:56:51] trouble when when you finally stop and
[1:56:54] say Satan get behind
[1:56:58] me you are a liar you are the father of
[1:57:03] all lies and there's no truth in
[1:57:08] you when you're
[1:57:11] ready to sit back and say I'm ready for
[1:57:14] the changes that God wants to make in my
[1:57:19] life because if he starts making those
[1:57:22] changes in my
[1:57:24] mind in my
[1:57:28] spirit I will be
[1:57:31] empowered with the changes that he makes
[1:57:35] in
[1:57:41] me and now I'll start spreading that
[1:57:46] abroad listen to what he said
[1:57:52] he says now the word there is not Earth
[1:57:57] it's the Greek word Cosmos which means
[1:58:01] the world's
[1:58:05] order if we love fashion of the
[1:58:10] Earth the world and we love the trends
[1:58:14] of the day if we think this is a
[1:58:18] wonderful
[1:58:20] time and oh
[1:58:22] we have all these things if you think
[1:58:26] that it's because your thinking is
[1:58:36] wrong it's perverted by the
[1:58:39] devil for if we love the world's order
[1:58:43] and the things of this present world
[1:58:47] it's because the love of God is not even
[1:58:50] in you remember that oh god look what
[1:58:55] we're looking
[1:58:56] into I want to stop here just a few
[1:58:59] momentes he's going to tell a story like
[1:59:02] Satan at the
[1:59:04] beginning when he come into the Garden
[1:59:07] of Eden he could not dig up those
[1:59:15] seeds
[1:59:17] hallelujah what God has planted he will
[1:59:20] water day and
[1:59:26] night he'll do
[1:59:29] it Prophet I'm so glad that God's
[1:59:32] mindful of us
[1:59:35] again he had to seow the
[1:59:38] word he had to wait for we grew up to
[1:59:42] the
[1:59:43] place that we could understand that
[1:59:46] God's got a change for
[1:59:50] us and we've been hoping for that
[1:59:53] change we call it the rapture we call it
[1:59:56] the translation but that is going on now
[2:00:01] he's
[2:00:02] translating
[2:00:04] you changing you and empowering
[2:00:11] you right
[2:00:14] now he's got to start creating the
[2:00:17] change in his church the change of their
[2:00:20] thinking the change of their desire the
[2:00:24] change of their hope the change of their
[2:00:26] strength the change of their
[2:00:29] Reliance he's got to get the fear
[2:00:37] out what happens if I don't get a job
[2:00:40] what happens if you don't get a
[2:00:44] job God will take care of me now if
[2:00:48] you're a lazy
[2:00:50] bum you know I mean you won't take any
[2:00:55] job you go home and dream of a $50 an
[2:00:59] hour job instead of walking down to
[2:01:01] McDonald's and cooking french fries will
[2:01:03] shame on you go to
[2:01:06] McDonald's cook french
[2:01:10] fries you might just be in there cooking
[2:01:12] fries and some guy say Hey you come here
[2:01:14] you walk yes sir he says what are you
[2:01:17] doing here cooking french fries well you
[2:01:20] know I'm looking for a job
[2:01:23] but instead of being a bum I I'm just
[2:01:26] praying and asking the Lord Jesus to
[2:01:28] give me a job and I'm going to testify
[2:01:31] to these people while I'm here I'm going
[2:01:35] to be happy I'm going to be thankful for
[2:01:38] what I got I'm going to be thankful for
[2:01:40] my
[2:01:41] health and he said well I got a
[2:01:45] job you want to come work for me yes sir
[2:01:49] I do
[2:01:52] I'm going to give my two weeks
[2:01:54] notice I'm going to take enough showers
[2:01:56] to wash all this french fry out of
[2:01:59] me and I'll be there in the job what
[2:02:02] happened why did we quit believing in a
[2:02:05] god like that why did we quit believing
[2:02:07] in the Supernatural why do we quit
[2:02:10] believing that our lives got ordered by
[2:02:12] the Lord what's happened to
[2:02:16] us why did we become afraid of
[2:02:20] change he couldn't dig up them
[2:02:23] seeds he could not destroy
[2:02:28] them but he sprayed them with
[2:02:32] poison and it deformed the seed and it
[2:02:35] didn't bring forth the right corn form
[2:02:38] he deformed The Original
[2:02:40] Seed well what are we going back to
[2:02:43] spoken word is the Original Seed we're
[2:02:47] returning back to the original seed and
[2:02:51] if we turn back to the original seed we
[2:02:54] return back to the original Fruit and
[2:02:56] God's here to transform us back into the
[2:03:03] original but the original is
[2:03:06] nothing like we got in our
[2:03:11] minds or in our
[2:03:15] possibilities we've got to start
[2:03:18] changing
[2:03:24] because there's power in
[2:03:29] change when you change you start seeing
[2:03:33] him for what he
[2:03:36] is when you put Faith where fear is
[2:03:42] where you put love where doubt
[2:03:47] is you become empowered
[2:03:51] that was the alarm to tell me to
[2:03:59] stop you can't be
[2:04:02] afraid of
[2:04:05] change tonight's
[2:04:09] communion maybe some of you live a long
[2:04:13] ways I understand that you can't make it
[2:04:17] back we've tried to provide the
[2:04:18] fellowship
[2:04:20] hall my homes have available if you need
[2:04:23] to
[2:04:29] stay but there's a lot of people that
[2:04:31] only believe in one
[2:04:34] service
[2:04:36] fine a lot of people won't come
[2:04:40] back but my question is what's keeping
[2:04:46] you gas
[2:04:51] Old-Timers used to put a gallon in gas
[2:04:54] and drive to a meeting 300 miles
[2:05:00] away did that
[2:05:05] die
[2:05:07] no people got to where they didn't want
[2:05:09] to take the
[2:05:14] chance they just couldn't believe it's
[2:05:19] them that God could do it for if he did
[2:05:23] it for anybody else he'll do it for
[2:05:31] you I know a man that left his State
[2:05:35] left his job left his home and
[2:05:39] everything just to come so he could have
[2:05:47] communion and he got in town with no
[2:05:49] work no money couldn't pay his rent
[2:05:53] couldn't do nothing broke as a hound
[2:05:57] dog and the only thing Satan sat on his
[2:06:00] doorstep every day saying boy did you
[2:06:02] make a
[2:06:03] mistake you
[2:06:07] fool you gave all that up for
[2:06:14] communion oh we don't want to sacrifice
[2:06:17] we don't want to make change but let me
[2:06:20] tell you something the Sheep sheep and
[2:06:22] the goats are being divided the Rapture
[2:06:26] is a
[2:06:27] change it's the greatest change and the
[2:06:31] Hope we've been looking for you've got
[2:06:34] to make the changes along the
[2:06:39] way maybe you just might this
[2:06:42] afternoon
[2:06:47] consider what changes you have to make
[2:06:51] in your
[2:06:52] thinking about
[2:06:55] communion and about the house of the
[2:06:57] Lord and about the church and about the
[2:07:05] body because if you don't
[2:07:11] change you're going
[2:07:18] backwards and we've got to understand we
[2:07:21] can not be
[2:07:24] afraid of changing our hearts changing
[2:07:28] our Spirits changing our thinkings
[2:07:32] changing the way we are God is
[2:07:36] fixing to
[2:07:39] change his
[2:07:42] church man has come up with anointing
[2:07:45] substitutes they've come up with
[2:07:47] blessings they've come up with refilling
[2:07:50] they come up with a moving of the Holy
[2:07:52] Spirit that's all good but God's looking
[2:07:55] for a deeper
[2:07:57] change he's looking for this inner man
[2:08:01] he's looking for this fruit he's looking
[2:08:04] for a deep change within the change of
[2:08:07] our heart the change of our mind the
[2:08:10] change of our
[2:08:14] nature the Chang is on brothers and
