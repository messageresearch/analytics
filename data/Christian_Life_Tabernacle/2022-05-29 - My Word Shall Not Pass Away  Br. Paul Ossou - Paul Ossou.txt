may you open it for us father may you reveal it to us in the name of the lord jesus amen as we're still standing up i'll try to read it directly in english god deuteronomy 26 verse 5 to 9. he says in and and thou shall speak and say before the lord thy god a syrian ready to perish was my father and he went down into egypt and sojourned there with a few and became there a nation great mighty and populous and and the egypt egyptians evil in threaded us and afflicted us and laid upon us laid upon our has hard bondage and when we cried unto the lord god of our fathers the lord heard our voice and looked on our affliction and our labor and our oppression and the lord brought us out of egypt with a mighty hand and with an outstretched harm with a great terribleness and with signs and with wonders and he had brought us into this place and had given us this land even the land that flows with milk and honey let's open in matthew verse 20 chapter 24 and the verse the 35th verse that we all know heaven and earth will shall pass away but my words shall not pass away amen amen that's why i may have [Music] i thank god for each and every one of you i thank you all for all the attention you'll give you give towards my family my little family when i'm not around i certainly appreciate it and i pray that the lord may bless each and every one of you that may the lord bless our pastor david bless leslie my sister leslie tusaki travail and all the people that work in around him it was a little bit difficult i was telling but billy this afternoon [Music] i don't plan my preaching in advance you please most times i i i it's when i pray when i study when i i try to find the mind of the lord this morning after the wonderful service we heard this morning at the end brother billy came to me and said if you we're going to go say hi to brother david and when he got there he looked at him and said he's gonna he's gonna preach this afternoon stop it if you see it and when i came when i went home i prayed the lord and when i opened my bible i came across the scripture in deuteronomy and the lord placed all my heart some things say something small that i would like to share with you [Music] um i had gotten it from matthew chapter 24. and i want to i title it my words will shall not pass away and i believe it was a great blessing for us this morning the sermon that was preached this morning it was a really great blessing where we understand that everything is uncertain everything that's in the world is uncertain there's only one thing that's certain it's a word of god and there's only one place where we could be sure the bible is telling us about the children of abraham father these children of abraham in the flesh where once they arrived in the promised land under the first certain shoes god asked them to do certain things and in deuteronomy 26 god was talking to them about the first fruits but in bringing that first fruit god asked them to pronounce those words that we read that was supposed to bring them to remembrance of who they were who was abraham uh uh he was a pagan a syrian he was a syrian king god yes we were like these incapable people who had failed in the things of the world by god by his grace god and he called us like he called abraham and he made and he gave a promise to abraham he said words to abraham when abraham didn't have a child in posterity god promised him that it will have her posterity and god told him about his children being in bondage and god even determined how long they were going to be in bondage when abraham didn't ever have a child god pronounced those words the children of israel they found themselves in in slavery in egypt when the time determined by god came to pass jesus god came and he brought him out by these mighty hands on his true design on the shelf with using a a man of flesh to fulfill that promise and god brought the children of israel out of egypt to bring them into the promised land [Music] a land that was flowing with milk and honey but god wanted the children of israel for them to see the goodness of god in that that's why when we read here it's god who's asking them to speak this word what abraham said what we [Applause] every time we think about what god has done for us when we think about what god has pronounced for each and every one of us and how that god brought it to pass certainty we are going to continue to be certain but if we forget the things that god had done we will not never be certain of that god says in question and answer on genesis it says now look don look back in the old testament when you see the plague falling they were in egypt and god was bringing his people out of the promise and israel never received one plague she used to come to play just as the plagues avocado before it went is no storm was there no lightning was there no killings no killing of cattle was there and everything they had was preserved in goshen is that right it's the type of the church that's going just before the tribulation the same way that god fulfill his word with the children of israel we too are in exodus but in this exodus complete the shows he knows that promised us god has fulfilled the things that he promised in this time god has already sent us our moses god has already revealed to us all his word when the world is shaking about all the things that's happening around the world when the world is being hit by all the things the plagues and everything that's happening we know that god promised for his people for you and i ila he already spoke those words that those plagues are not about us that when god will hit the earth israel that israel israel's spiritual spiritual israel is going to be put to the side that god [Music] before the tribulation can come up on this earth let's just say people are caught up in the things that's happening around the world there's those that are saying oh that's the beginning of tribulation that that tribulation will not start talking as long as you and i are here on earth but the job for me because god promised that before the tribulation is fully here on earth that he will take his bride away but what god wants second loser is that we be certain that we are part of this bride all that the devil is doing is to bring us to a place where we become uncertain they want you to ask your questions should i am i really a son of god do all the things that's happening is that really am i really a son of god i pledge allegiance if god called you in this message the scripture says that no one comes to me unless my father has called him first calculus regardless of your failures regardless of your your failures [Applause] to bring you to perfection confess that you may confess those things not to believe the things that the devil is telling you not to tell you what the world not to believe what the world is presenting to you it's uncertain one thing is certain it's the word of god i heard about it he said i want to stay in [Applause] will never pass the devil is nothing but a scarecrow he's a bluffer he wants you to to be caught up in some type of fear do you believe that you can't move forward he wants you to see with a natural eye evolution we are going to stay or remain in what that which is intellectual but god wants us to be certain of him but to know that everything that he said he's able to bring it to pass yeah look at the children of israel they came out of egypt with a mighty hand god showed them great miracles [Applause] how that god came and he annihilated the egyptians and of something and when they came out jealous god told them that he was taking them in a promised land he told them he was bringing them to a land that flows with milk and honey they get into the wilderness regardless of everything that they have seen as a miracle regardless of all the power that was displayed before the same god when the egyptians came closer in certain temples he came and he stood between the children of israel and the egyptians on the side of egyptian was completely dark on their side there was light but when they get into the wilderness when they came before the temptations we know how that god took us out of the world into this message but some things when some temptation comes about the same god who makes the devil can make you believe because that that god becomes incapable we are insulting but there's one thing that god cannot do and that's to fail it don't match you and that same god who brought us into this message he's the same god who's able to take us to the promised land regardless of what comes in our way calculated regardless of how hard the trials are yeah look at the children of israel when they come into the world and ask joseph what explore recipes uh joshua sends them to go and explore the land they went and explored the land they saw it that it was a land that was flowing with milk and honey we are all convinced because of message that this message is the truth we are all convinced because the message that jeremiah that is this message it's god himself who preaches some the same as the children of israel had to prove that that land was flowing with milk and honey but it was in that land just like the same way in our everyday lives it was two groups of people it was 10 of them on one side they saw the milk and the honey but their eyes were focused on the sons of anak may have a desert but there were two others they saw the milk and the honey love and their eyes were only fixed on the milk and the honey why but they caught this okay because when they left egypt they told them that this land it was a land that was flowing with milk and honey everything that they didn't tell him in the world it wasn't the problem that may be the sons of animals they may be whatever there is [Applause] because his word will never pass away when these things begin to discourage the people joshua and caleb they said shut up you know that god told us that in that land that there was milk and honey that was flowing did you see the milk and the honey that was flowing yesterday [Applause] it says now there are many that pretend to be in there there are there are many that are wearing themselves out they are ruining themselves trying to live right and trying to press him i i don't know about that merciful but if there are in there it's just as easy to live a christian life as it is to live any life basketball because you are in christ and nothing else but so nothing else but so full of the holy ghost leading you and why sure you you you'll make mistakes and fall if you feel the fault you you will believe that that same god is still faithful for me god everything that he promised down in the promised land he's talking about everything that he promised more it's the rapture that i may fall short of living i'm gonna stand up i'm not gonna remain down because i have a promise but you can't stay down please gonna papa ferdinand and sycamore because no more than you can make a sticker corn of of sycamore tree vulnerable one of the greatest curses on the church today is fear everybody is scared to death it's what's going to happen the only question we have gelatin as god said it see we if it's yes then that's good enough for us then we go forward with him because we are certain that if he said it he's gonna hold his word he will keep his promise he will he will go with us until the end and everything is that everything that's outside of what he said has no place in our lives because his word will never pass away but god wants us to be like joshua and caleb and no doubt in your life there's mountains there's the sons of annex god said if you say to this mountain and brother is commenting on that and saying it says in reality it's not you that is saying but when you are in christ it's god who's saying it for you do so what you are fair all that you have to do is to believe the consumer demand that when god asks me to pronounce this he himself will take care of the rest [Applause] that's [Applause] he was still on the wheelchair because but he was continuing to testify that by his stripes i went into the prayer line the bible told me they came because everybody knows you're still on the wheelchair because again but when you says everywhere that god heals you it's it's bringing a bad name he looked at him it says if you were in the same condition that i am right now you will not try to take away the only hope i have the toothless that by all means it's by his stripes said again that i was here and when he said it he stood up on the wheelchair he began to walk why because he believes that your heaven and earth pass away but the word of god will never pass away regardless of the situation you're going through regardless of your failure you take a part of the world your fault that is telling you that you are strong you get your feedback that is telling you that you are a son and the son of god that he tells you that you're a son of god that you hold on to that and god himself will bring the past the rest because he's capable he is faithful everything what god has asked of us is to be certain of him to believe there's nothing impossible to god we can also say that nothing is impossible to them not believe because we believe the word uh the sons of god manifested um paragraph 21. it is it says now now shows can fall about the first thing that paul started thinking we started out to tell to tell the people it says remember this is to the church not the outsiders it's a mystery and it's a riddle to him the enigmatic it says it never never able to understand it it goes on top of his head he does not know more about but to the church for you and i me but for the church [Applause] but god's word shall never pass away but the man that's outside of canaan knows nothing of it he let him call her i don't say that the man that's in it even in in egypt he's not a good man until he has come over into the possessions ella [Music] [Applause] [Applause] and we are led by the spirit let's physically feed your son country palace sons and daughters of god are led by god promised them a natural land where they were flowing milk and honey and god fulfilled that do nothing in our exodus god promised a spiritual language and that that land has nothing but the word of god and that land is nothing but the message and what that israel was never blessed when they were outside of the promised land the biggest blessing that we can receive is when we remain in the world is when we abide in the message is when we we abide in our promised land because there we are sure that heaven and earth will pass away but the word of god will never pass away from myself my brother my sister regardless of your situation regardless of the difficulties that you are in your work let's believe that the word the god who bless you in this message he's able to take you all the way through the rapture he's the only one who's capable okay no man is capable of we saw it when we said who's worthy who's worthy person no one was found worthy but it's god himself by his grace by his goodness by his love to give us access to the promised land when we go back into that exodus for me god promised that he gave them that land but when [Applause] they had [Music] [Applause] the promise is only given to the overcomers to be an overcomer for combat you have to fight it's just secondly something and god knows that we are in the fight the the the advantage that we have to come back that it's in this war whatever what kind of weapon it was to give us a second end that weapon the most powerful one is the word of god with the word of god we can we can overcome under every circumstances that's why this word will never pass away we can take a lot of testimonies in the word we can take job in whom god himself gave testimony he looked at satan and said have you considered my servant joe oh it says every time i read that you should be so confused i i feel heaviness i asked myself a question can god ask satan on my behalf and the same question if you looked at my servant there's no there's no man on earth like him but this man who was uh who was perfect this man who believed god god placed him in trials a trial a different a difficult trial it was in a horrible trial any uh a trial that none of us would want to have what would it what did job do he said god gave us and god takes away blessed be the name of the lord amen job remain firm with the word of god satan went back to god he says he he's continuing to believe because you give him a good health but then i i i set up a limit for you he allows satan to come up to death be sure that god is giving him a limit you cannot cross the slimmer i am not authorizing you to go past this point and god wants to see us resist like job and when job stood firm god gave him a vision he says i know come on my redeemer liver that even if the worm eat off of this flesh but i'll see god face to face it says but not the eyes of the others but my own eyes will see god the the three hebrew children they had their own habits but but damn they were believers they knew that the heaven and earth will pass away but the word of god will never pass away when the world under which they were living brought them to try to worship something that was not in the word festival what did what does the devil do oftentimes he's very smart he will try to bring you it will bring you to do something that's not scriptural it's him that's doing it and when he finished doing it he comes back he's the male 1 he comes and stands in front of you you see what you did just stop praying tell him it's not me that did it jesus i am a son of god god i can once again i can come back oh in the kitchen scriptures coming to me zechariah i believe it's zechariah the third chapter uh excuse me i'm trying to find it verse 1 let's start from verse 1. it says an issue and he showed uh he showed me joshua the high priest standing before the angels of the lord and satan standing at his right hand to resist him and the lord said unto satan the lord rebuked thee o satan even the lord that had chosen jerusalem rebuked thee it is not the is not this a brand plugged out of the fire now joshua was clothed with a filthy garment and stood before the angels and he answered and speak unto those who stood before him saying saying take away the filth the filthy garment from him and unto him he said behold i have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee and i have closed thee with a change of raymond reinman and i said let them set up set a fair minister upon his head so they set a fair minstrel upon his head and clothed him with the garments and the angel of the lord stood by and the angel of the lord protested unto joshua saying that saith the lord of hosts if thou will walk in my way if thou will keep all my all keep my chain my charge and now shall also judge my house and and shall also keep my courts i will give thee places to walk among those that stand by we can stop right here we see there is joshua was standing there with filthy garments we were saying as in the type that joshua was in sin and satan presents himself before god for accusations so he can accuse joshua but what did god say it says oh i i reprimand your satan i'm gonna reprimand you or and god came and he took away the filthiness of joshua so he can make joshua his servants then the enemy will try to accuse you why you take the word because joseph say i am a son of god jesus i am a daughter of god god says it means he's able to bring us to perfection how is he going to do it they asked them to worship a strange god and it's certain that when if they had done it that the enemy was going to come you see what would you you you you just uh uh he's not going to hear you anymore but there's three hebrew children they said heaven and earth will pass away but his word will not pass away the the king asked them it says who's going to deliver you from my wrath he was he believed that he was the most powerful but our god is the most powerful he said our god will deliver us and as we're taking them to the furnace that the fire coming out of the furnace it came and it destroyed everyone that was taking them then it takes us away from god but the word of god when we take it every word when we anchor into the word god will anchor to us god will testify of his greatness god will testify of his power and he will never never leave us let's all stand he hold he keeps his promise he never misses his promise the bible tells us the whole bible is only made out of promises is there's a there's a promise according to your your need your condition the improvement of functionality obviously there's a promise based on your your need [Music] god wants you to hold on to that that you'll be certain did you of god get you swapped that you don't be in uncertainty that you believe that that god is is faithful that that god is capable yeah okay let's pray our grace is father we thank you lord for your grace and your mercy lord father your word is true we're so thankful to be serving this kind of god and who never fails as who walks with us and lead us and who's made himself real made himself known unto us and father i pray that tonight if there be any need represented lord that we be assured as we heard your word go forth that you are a certain god and you are god who makes this promise come true and you are god who says one thing and will never let it go by the wayside and will stand until it comes to pass and you said that heaven and earth will pass away but that your word will never pass away and we are standing only here because your word is true lord we ask lord but father that as our brother preached that your word may just touch our heart tonight lord and father that he may answer the
