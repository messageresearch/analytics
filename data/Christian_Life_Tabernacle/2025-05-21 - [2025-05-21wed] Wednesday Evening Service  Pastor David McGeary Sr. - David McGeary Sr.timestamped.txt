[0:00] [Music]
[2:07] Heat.
[2:26] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:35] [Music]
[3:22] How do you
[3:27] explain? How do you
[3:33] describe a love that goes from east to
[3:38] west and runs as if as it is wise?
[3:45] You know all I
[3:49] hope. Lord, you know all I
[3:55] fear. Words cannot express the love we
[4:01] feel, but we long for you to
[4:07] hear. Oh, and listen to our
[4:13] hearts. Hear our spirit
[4:18] sing. A song of praise that
[4:23] flows from those who have
[4:29] redeemed. You will use the words we know
[4:34] to tell you what an awome God you are.
[4:41] Words are not enough to tell you of our
[4:45] love. Listen to our
[4:50] heart. Oh, and if words could fall, I
[4:55] pray from this lips of mine.
[5:01] But if I th
[5:05] and I will still run out of
[5:10] time. So if you listen to my
[5:15] [Music]
[5:16] heart, Lord, every bit will
[5:22] sing. Thank you for the life. Thank you
[5:26] for the truth. Thank you for the
[5:32] way. Also listen to our
[5:39] hearts. Hear our spirit
[5:44] sing. A song of praise that
[5:49] flows from those who have redeemed.
[5:55] [Music]
[5:56] We will use the words we know to tell
[6:01] you what an awesome God you are. Oh,
[6:07] words are not enough to tell you of our
[6:12] love. Listen to our
[6:16] heart. Amen. That's what we desire
[6:19] tonight as we gather in his presence is
[6:21] for him to hear our hearts. Amen.
[6:24] Brother Matthew, if you could just come
[6:25] and open our service in prayer.
[6:30] [Music]
[6:46] Amen.
[6:48] Amen. It's good to see Sister Raquel
[6:50] with us. Amen. I believe he had the
[6:53] surgery
[6:54] already. Not yet. So, we're going to
[6:56] continue to pray for her. I I know they
[6:58] were going for some test or things, but
[6:59] there's many needs. Maybe an unspoken
[7:01] prayer request. You want to just have an
[7:03] uplifted hand. God sees that need. You
[7:05] know, uh some of us, we have scheduled
[7:07] procedures, but we're looking to the
[7:10] great physician who can move on the
[7:11] scene and the doctors can give a clean
[7:13] bill of health. Amen. Let's just
[7:14] approach them. Lord Jesus, we're just
[7:16] thankful that we can be gathered
[7:18] together once again, Lord, and with our
[7:20] brothers and sisters of like faith, just
[7:22] to be able to sing songs of Zion and to
[7:24] give you praise, Lord, for truly you're
[7:27] worthy, Lord, and you're worthy of so
[7:28] much more. But Lord, we we just want to
[7:31] allow the things of this world just to
[7:33] fall to the wayside, Lord, as we've
[7:35] maybe been in our jobs or just at the
[7:37] house doing chores. And many times we
[7:40] become encumbered with those things. But
[7:42] Lord, we want to sit at your feet and we
[7:45] want to listen and hear what you would
[7:46] have to speak to us tonight. Lord, we're
[7:49] so privileged to live in this hour
[7:51] during this age to know that in the
[7:54] moment, in a twinkling of an eye, we can
[7:55] be changed. We're not waiting for
[7:57] another messenger. We're not waiting for
[8:00] some future prophecy to be fulfilled to
[8:02] give us rapturing faith. But Lord,
[8:04] you've already sent us Malachi 4:5 and
[8:07] opened the book, Lord, that could
[8:08] produce everything that we have need of
[8:10] right now in this hour that we're now
[8:12] living in. And we believe this
[8:14] predestinated moment tonight is just
[8:16] another opportunity to take a step
[8:18] closer to that final change, Lord. And
[8:20] we just ask that you would just come and
[8:22] take complete control, Lord. You see the
[8:24] uplifted hands and the the hearts and
[8:26] the needs of your people, Lord. We just
[8:29] ask that you would move in a
[8:31] supernatural way, Lord, in the service.
[8:33] Father, may we just start to enter into
[8:35] worship, Lord, a true worship, not just
[8:37] a a religious obligation or duty, but
[8:40] Lord, to enter in by faith, Lord, as
[8:43] touching the sacrifice, Lord, to know
[8:45] that you made a way for us to come in
[8:47] and have communion with you again. That
[8:49] we're not just serving a God a far off
[8:51] somewhere, Lord, but you're right here
[8:53] in our midst where two or three are
[8:54] gathered. You're present here with us.
[8:56] And you said, "I'll be with you even in
[8:58] you, Lord." We're so thankful to be
[9:00] living in the hour of the fulfillment of
[9:02] those promises. Lord, we just commit the
[9:04] singing of the songs to you, Lord, the
[9:06] preaching of the word. We commit to you
[9:08] and just ask that you just take control
[9:10] in Jesus Christ's name. We ask all these
[9:12] things and commit it to you. Amen.
[9:19] May God bless you. Welcome everyone in
[9:20] the house of God. May you turn around
[9:22] and welcome someone tonight. Amen. So
[9:24] good to be gather in his presence.
[9:51] Gore.
[9:54] [Music]
[10:05] Amen. Let's sing. Are you washed by the
[10:08] blood? By the water of the word. Amen.
[10:18] Oh, do you know what it is not to have
[10:23] one guilty feeling? Not to wonder where
[10:27] you're going when you
[10:30] die. Oh, not condemned of the past. Not
[10:35] afraid. Oh,
[10:36] I hold in store. I know the reason
[10:43] why
[10:46] Jesus when you go out the water cause my
[10:51] faith. You believe in what you
[10:55] heard. It's not
[10:58] impossible dream. Oh, you can start
[11:02] over. Heat. Heat.

[30:16] Lord. Amen. Commit yourself into his
[30:19] hands. Let us pray. Our gracious father,
[30:21] we ask you to bless us this evening as
[30:24] we come together.
[30:27] Lord, we always just look for a little
[30:31] boost in the middle of the week. Father,
[30:34] we ask that you would bless us tonight
[30:36] and boost us. Just give us a little bit
[30:38] of encouragement as we just spend a few
[30:41] moments with you. We ask it in Jesus
[30:44] precious name. Amen. Amen. Lord bless
[30:48] you. I guess you notice we made a little
[30:51] change. Uh I hope you like it. Uh we
[30:55] haven't painted it yet. So we're picking
[30:59] paint color and so uh if you want to
[31:03] suggest a color, you're welcome to do
[31:06] that. Probably won't use it, but you can
[31:10] at least say you had a chance. Now we
[31:13] we're down to about three colors. Uh so
[31:17] some people think it should be
[31:19] darker, some people think it should be
[31:22] lighter.
[31:23] So, we have a color that's a little
[31:26] darker than the panel and darker than
[31:30] the wall and one that's uh a little
[31:33] lighter than the panel. But anyway, if
[31:37] we don't like it, we'll just repaint
[31:40] it. Right? That's a good thing about a
[31:43] Christian, isn't it? You can always go
[31:45] back to where you left them. You can go
[31:48] back where you found them, you know? And
[31:50] people say, "Well, how do I get back to
[31:52] the Lord?" just go back to where you
[31:53] left them. If you sit down, you pray
[31:55] about it, you think about it, you'll
[31:57] find your way back there and he he'll
[32:00] definitely be with her. Let's open our
[32:02] Bibles and turn to the book of
[32:06] um Peter in the first chapter and we'll
[32:10] start it uh
[32:17] uh with the fifth verse and read through
[32:20] the eth
[32:22] uh ninth
[32:24] verse. And it
[32:27] said talking of us here, he says to
[32:31] inheritance incorruptible and defiled
[32:34] and that fadeth not away reserved in
[32:38] heaven for you. So, and now this is
[32:43] you who are kept by the power of God
[32:47] through faith unto salvation, ready to
[32:52] be revealed in the last time, wherein ye
[32:58] greatly
[33:00] rejoice, though now for a season, if
[33:04] need be, you are in heaviness through
[33:08] manifold tempt ations. So in other
[33:12] words, don't let it throw you. All
[33:14] right? Um that the trying of your faith
[33:18] being more precious than of gold that
[33:23] perish, though it be tried with fire, ye
[33:27] might be found unto the praise and honor
[33:30] and glory at the appearing of Jesus
[33:34] Christ, whom having not
[33:37] seen, ye love. In whom though now you
[33:42] see him not yet believing you rejoice
[33:47] with joy
[33:49] unspeakable and full of glory re
[33:53] receiving the end of your faith even the
[33:58] salvation of your souls. Now let's just
[34:02] read that eth verse again slowly. whom
[34:08] having not seen. How many qualify? I
[34:13] do even to the messenger of the hour. I
[34:16] I I'd never sat in one of his meetings,
[34:19] but when I heard that voice, I I
[34:22] remember just as about 16 years old, I
[34:26] remember I was in my dad's car. We had
[34:30] an old Ford station wagon pulling out of
[34:33] my driveway when they announced that
[34:37] Evangelist William
[34:39] Brandom
[34:42] died for some reason. I can't explain
[34:45] why, but I just broke down, started
[34:48] crying. How did I know? You know what I
[34:52] mean? that one day I would understand
[34:55] that that
[34:57] would come back to me. And remember we
[35:01] preached a little bit about this
[35:03] recognizing your call. That was God way
[35:07] back then knowing that he would call me.
[35:10] He
[35:11] said whom though you have not seen him
[35:15] seen him not yet believing and ye
[35:19] rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
[35:24] glory. Now here's why you're
[35:27] rejoicing with joy unspeakable. Why
[35:30] you're full of glory. Receiving the end
[35:34] of your faith, even the salvation of
[35:38] your soul. you've received it. Let's
[35:41] pray. Father, we ask you to bless your
[35:44] word to us in Jesus precious name we
[35:47] pray. Amen. Amen. Lord, bless you. We we
[35:51] spoke a little bit uh Sunday morning uh
[35:57] uh uh to you about uh recognizing
[36:03] uh your call. And again, we wanted to
[36:07] say uh not using that word as uh what
[36:12] your vocation might be or what uh what
[36:17] what duty you might have to do or uh the
[36:20] purpose for what you said, but
[36:23] recognizing the fact that God reached
[36:26] out to you and spoke to you. And we know
[36:30] that God does the drawing. So you you
[36:33] you can actually sit and remember when
[36:37] it was that God pulled on your heart,
[36:42] when it was that that he reached out to
[36:45] you, when he dealt with you, whatever
[36:48] circumstance you were in, how that he
[36:51] brought people in your life to bring you
[36:54] to the knowledge of the the truth. And
[36:58] all this was guided by the hand of the
[37:00] Lord. uh you know he even said that you
[37:04] it just seems to us like we just
[37:07] stumbled into it. It just came across
[37:10] our path. But for him he he had
[37:15] orchestrated every bit of it and planned
[37:19] it how that he was going to draw us. And
[37:22] and can you imagine somebody living
[37:24] through life thinking that they were the
[37:27] ones that made the choice? I chose to
[37:32] serve God. It was my decision. No. No.
[37:36] That's not what my Bible says. My Bible
[37:38] says, "You didn't choose me. I chose
[37:40] you." Amen. I was lost,
[37:44] but he found me. And And so, uh, we
[37:48] talked about that. And we talked about
[37:51] if you can recognize your
[37:53] calling then you can recognize that he
[37:57] called you to a
[37:58] ground. You understand ah inheritance.
[38:02] He he he called you to a place to live.
[38:06] Uh he called you to a a a way of
[38:09] thinking, a way of talking, a way of
[38:12] living. And you've got every right to
[38:15] possess that ground. That's your ground.
[38:19] You You have the the title deed to it,
[38:23] the abstract. Uh, I've built some houses
[38:26] and and sold them and I I bought some
[38:29] homes and bought property. And the first
[38:33] thing you do, you go to a title company
[38:36] and they search the the land uh to make
[38:40] sure that there's
[38:43] no leans against it, no nothing owed on
[38:48] it, nothing uh uh no other ownership
[38:53] claim and and that this is the property
[38:58] that it says it is. I had a friend one
[39:01] time that he walked out on a nice piece
[39:04] of property and he was walking around
[39:06] the piece of property
[39:08] and and he walked up there and all of a
[39:11] sudden a guy pulled up in a pickup truck
[39:13] and he said, "What are you doing on my
[39:16] property?" He said, "No, sir. This isn't
[39:20] your
[39:21] property. This is my
[39:23] property. I just paid for it."
[39:27] Well, he got involved in what we called
[39:29] a failed
[39:31] flip. So, somebody went and sold the
[39:34] property to him, got his money, and then
[39:37] was taking his money to run back over
[39:40] and buy it from the original
[39:44] seller and try to make some money in the
[39:49] in the in between. It's not uh well that
[39:54] the seller ended up in
[39:56] jail, but the buddy was out the money
[40:00] because he didn't check to see if the
[40:05] ground
[40:07] was free
[40:10] from any encumberments. Didn't have a
[40:13] false owner. Well, let me tell you, the
[40:16] ground of the Lord Jesus Christ is free
[40:18] ground. Amen. and it he was the owner
[40:22] and he passed the ownership to that land
[40:27] to us. So we we have a right to walk on
[40:31] that land. We have a right. We have the
[40:34] mineral rights. We have the all the
[40:39] benefits of the land. Everything that's
[40:41] on that land is ours. In fact, he put it
[40:45] this way. We're joint heirs of that
[40:48] land. Our name is on the ownership of
[40:51] that land just like he is. It's not lent
[40:55] to us.
[40:57] It's not a privilege. It's not a lease.
[41:01] We have hunters, you know, you'll you'll
[41:04] go pay for a lease and they'll say for
[41:06] one year you for $1,000 you can go lease
[41:10] this land. You can go on that land. You
[41:14] can use that land. You can hunt on that
[41:17] land. that you'll never own that land.
[41:19] No. When you get this land, it becomes
[41:23] your
[41:24] land. Now, if you don't choose to live
[41:27] on it and you don't choose to walk there
[41:31] and you don't choose to to live in that
[41:35] land and you choose to live someplace
[41:38] else, then you're not having any of the
[41:42] benefits of it.
[41:45] And why would you want to live in a
[41:47] land? That's what the prodical son did.
[41:49] He left all the blessings of his
[41:51] father's house and tried to walk in
[41:54] other blessings for a while. But he
[41:56] never lost his inheritance.
[42:01] He just had to get to the place where he
[42:04] was miserable enough to come back. And
[42:07] what did the father do? killed the
[42:09] fatted calf, threw the robe back on him,
[42:12] rejoiced because he which was lost is
[42:15] now ens. And that's what the scripture
[42:17] says that there's more rejoicing in
[42:20] heaven over the the one last soul that's
[42:26] returned because that's what it's all
[42:28] about is about the goodness of God. So,
[42:31] we talked about the land. And and we
[42:34] read this statement
[42:36] and he says, "The works that I do shall
[42:40] you do
[42:41] also." Why? Because now we're both
[42:45] walking on the same land. We're both
[42:48] walking in the I in in the same
[42:51] dimension, in the same realm. Do you
[42:54] know you can walk in the same realm, in
[42:56] the same dimension, as the Lord Savior?
[43:00] That's your
[43:01] promise. That's what you And I'm just
[43:04] gonna lead to a few things and then not
[43:06] be too long. But he said that
[43:10] is that is the
[43:14] assurance when we see a group of people
[43:17] sitting together and those signs
[43:19] manifesting themselves. It's the
[43:22] assurance that the abstract is there to
[43:26] vindicate that property of God.
[43:30] Amen. So when we see the blessings, we
[43:33] see the goodness of God, the fruits of
[43:35] the spirit, the the the uh uh all the
[43:40] benefits that come with of the statue of
[43:43] a perfect man, that you know that you're
[43:47] in his realm, you're in his property,
[43:51] that the property that you're in and
[43:53] you're on is God's. Every son of God
[43:57] whose name is written in the lamb's book
[43:58] of life has a right to walk in that
[44:01] land. We just live below our
[44:04] privilege. And and so uh he says and
[44:09] that's what he said. So we so we are
[44:14] Easter. Amen. What is Easter? The
[44:17] resurrection. We are the honor. We are
[44:22] the the what Easter was all about. It
[44:26] wasn't about just him raising. It was
[44:29] about him paying the price, taking the
[44:32] whole burden of death. And and we don't
[44:35] die.
[44:38] You say, "Oh, I'm going to die." No, I'm
[44:40] just getting rid of this thing that's
[44:43] wrapped around me that just starts
[44:46] aching more and more. You know, I walked
[44:49] up the steps today. Uh they'll put a
[44:52] paint sample up here to look at it and
[44:54] my shoe come off and I fall down. And in
[44:58] fact, you could come right here and see
[44:59] my knee prints. Look at they're they're
[45:02] right here. One's right here and one's
[45:04] right here. I'd show you my knees, but
[45:07] this is
[45:08] church, but I showed it to the brothers
[45:11] in the back. And I fell flat on my face.
[45:15] And I thought, I know how to walk up
[45:18] steps, you know, and and then and Leslie
[45:21] comes to me, "Oh, you shouldn't be
[45:23] carrying wood." I said, "Lesie, they're
[45:25] only this big, you know, it doesn't have
[45:28] anything to do with I I know that I have
[45:32] another body waiting for me, right? I've
[45:37] received as as Peter said here, he he
[45:40] says, I I receiving the end of your
[45:44] faith and even the salvation of your
[45:47] soul. I receive it. I fall on my face. I
[45:51] praise God.
[45:54] Thank you, Lord. Why? Cuz I got another
[45:58] body. And every day my heart beats. I'm
[46:00] one day closer. And I thank God for
[46:03] that. So, we just want to build off of
[46:06] this to to today because I'm I'm talking
[46:08] about the
[46:11] joy joy
[46:13] unspeakable and full of glory. And I
[46:16] want to I'm just I'm I'm building to
[46:18] make a real small point.
[46:21] He said, he said,
[46:27] uh, he says, or if we, if we are
[46:31] ordained on that ground, if we are
[46:34] ordained to be on that ground like the
[46:37] eagle walking in the chicken nest, he
[46:41] was ordained to fly. He was ordained to
[46:45] eat fresh kerrion. He was ordained,
[46:48] that's where he was ordained to live.
[46:50] Now, where he was
[46:51] living didn't matter.
[46:55] You understand? Because he was ordained
[46:59] to live there. And because you're
[47:02] ordained to live
[47:04] there, God cannot ordain you to be
[47:07] somewhere and not have you be there.
[47:12] He can't put your name on the lamb's
[47:15] book of life and then not get you in
[47:18] condition.
[47:22] Because the scripture says if he begins
[47:25] a work in you, he will finish it till
[47:28] the end. You say when did he begin the
[47:31] work in me? Before the foundation of the
[47:35] world. He knew the color of my hair or
[47:38] the no hair. He knew the my stature I'd
[47:41] be in. He He knew everything about me.
[47:44] He saw me then. Amen. And because I was
[47:48] his bride, he put the wedding band of
[47:53] predestination on me then.
[47:56] Saying to me, I am going to fulfill my
[48:00] thoughts in you.
[48:04] It doesn't matter what ground you fall
[48:06] on. It didn't matter what ground that
[48:10] that seed of God fell in. He was going
[48:12] to seek that seed out. He was going to
[48:15] find that seed. He would look to that
[48:18] seed till he found what his and he would
[48:21] make a way for that seed to come in. And
[48:25] that's what what he's
[48:28] done. He said he said if you are
[48:31] ordained on that ground, the Holy Spirit
[48:34] is here to find you.
[48:38] I like that. And when it finds you, you
[48:43] recognize its
[48:46] call. And we wanted to emphasize that
[48:50] because you got to settle that
[48:53] question. And so we we just want to lay
[48:56] that in for a couple services uh just to
[49:00] really anchor our our hearts. Uh he you
[49:06] You know the hour you're living in. And
[49:09] we know that, right? We know we're at
[49:11] the end time, right? You know, you know
[49:15] the uh you know the hour you're living
[49:17] in. You know that these things are
[49:20] supposed to
[49:21] happen quickly. You're raptured up to
[49:26] meet it. And now you're sitting in
[49:28] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Oh,
[49:32] what a promise. What a heavenly father
[49:36] who would give us these things.
[49:41] All right. Cuz we're talking about joy
[49:44] now.
[49:45] So we we know that
[49:52] uh if
[49:54] I I wrote some notes, which I usually
[49:57] don't do, but I'm getting so old I don't
[50:00] even know how to turn my pages. Oh,
[50:02] well, I know they were here somewhere.
[50:06] All right, I guess I'll just have to let
[50:09] me
[50:11] [Music]
[50:13] see. Not that
[50:15] sermon. Not that
[50:18] sermon. I know they have
[50:21] it. What do you
[50:24] do when you can't find your notes? You
[50:27] know what you do? You just might have to
[50:30] preach.
[50:32] And you know that's what I tell all the
[50:34] brothers. I say you know don't don't
[50:37] become captive to your notes. So know
[50:40] your
[50:41] sermon before you preach it. Make sure
[50:45] you've lived it before you preach it.
[50:49] Make sure that you don't have to take
[50:51] what uh whatever thought it is. you know
[50:55] that he'll speak to you like like we
[50:58] know like brother Andrew is going off to
[51:00] preach this weekend uh for a meeting.
[51:02] You know, we'll keep him in prayer that
[51:04] the Holy Spirit just quickens the word
[51:07] to him that's in his heart. Matthew's
[51:09] fixing to go preach a a camp, a family
[51:12] camp, young people uh camp. I think it's
[51:15] family or young people camp. And we just
[51:17] believe the Holy Spirit will be be with
[51:20] him. So we want it to go beyond
[51:22] intellect,
[51:24] right? So, we know in talking about what
[51:29] we're going to talk about just for a
[51:31] moment is that Satan hasn't changed,
[51:36] right? He uses the very same tactic.
[51:40] Many of you know this is a a quote or a
[51:43] statement. He uses the same tactics that
[51:46] he used on Eve in the garden. He uses
[51:49] them on you.
[51:51] And you say, "Well, why would he do
[51:53] that?" because they were so effective.
[51:57] And that's what he is. He's a beguiler.
[52:02] He's a deceiver. He's a liar. He he
[52:06] draws such a a false picture. Have any
[52:09] of you heard some of the statements uh
[52:12] that the the new uh pope has made? You
[52:16] know, oh, he's talking about that we're
[52:18] at the end time. We we need to get
[52:21] ready. uh we need to be more sincere
[52:24] towards Christ than we've ever been. And
[52:27] now here's these Protestant leaders all
[52:29] over saying, "Praise God, we have a
[52:33] pope that reads the
[52:39] Bible." What a
[52:43] deception. That's the
[52:46] Antichrist. That's the mark of the
[52:48] beast.
[52:50] We know that they'll all be gathered up,
[52:53] but now he comes speaking the language.
[52:57] You, you know, and and Lesie was German.
[52:59] She said, I couldn't believe it. You
[53:02] would think he'd been reading message
[53:06] books. What's he going to appear as?
[53:09] Angel of light.
[53:13] And people are embracing him, not
[53:17] recognizing and seeing who he is. So he
[53:21] hasn't changed. You know what that whole
[53:24] message is? Come join us. Surely you
[53:28] won't die.
[53:30] That's right.
[53:32] Oh, surely what he says has to be truth.
[53:36] No, the whole thing's a lie. Wow.
[53:40] It's the mother harlot. That's right.
[53:42] The mother of every organization and
[53:45] every
[53:46] denomination and and the whole nickelian
[53:49] spirit and the whole conquering of the
[53:52] ley. The the whole thing is
[53:55] absolutely a
[53:57] total deception.
[54:01] And you wait. It won't be long until him
[54:05] and our president will be good buddies
[54:07] and the world economy. They're calling
[54:10] it the golden age. The last golden thing
[54:13] I remember is the golden
[54:18] calf.
[54:20] Right? And that's because God hasn't
[54:23] changed. Satan hasn't changed.
[54:26] And why would I say golden calf? Because
[54:30] the the the redemption of
[54:34] Israel is a perfect type of the
[54:38] redemption of the believer. That's
[54:41] right.
[54:44] And I I listened to a a tape. It's
[54:46] called the redemption a redemption in
[54:49] completeness of joy. And we want to just
[54:52] talk on that thought just a moment. So,
[54:55] Israel just like us, they were they were
[55:00] uh they were bound by task masters. And
[55:04] the scripture says they called unto God
[55:07] by reason of their task masters. Now, we
[55:11] weren't in slavery maybe to
[55:15] uh a taskmaster or a whip building
[55:19] brick, but we were in slavery to the
[55:22] economy. We are in slavery to getting a
[55:25] job. We are in slavery to depression. We
[55:29] are in slavery to alcoholism. We are in
[55:32] slavery to drug use. We had all these
[55:36] task masters on our life. All these
[55:39] burdens on our life, all these uh
[55:42] depressions and and you
[55:45] know you almost driven to the place that
[55:49] you didn't want to live anymore. Right.
[55:52] You didn't know what was happening to
[55:54] your life. You were tore up
[55:57] and you could have been raised in a good
[55:59] home. Yes, sir. And all of a sudden, you
[56:02] find yourself in the midst of doing
[56:05] whatever you're doing, as good as it as
[56:07] you are. And you ask yourself, what am I
[56:10] doing this for?
[56:15] Because that's how
[56:17] that he he dealt with your heart.
[56:22] and started calling you and working on
[56:25] you. I had a man tell me the other day,
[56:28] he said, "I smoke two packs of
[56:29] cigarettes. I don't know if he said for
[56:31] 10 years." He looked at me, he says, "I
[56:33] don't know how I did
[56:36] it." Now, that's just the
[56:41] opposite. You know, I I can't believe I
[56:44] even did that.
[56:46] You know, people were alcoholics and
[56:50] everything, but they were saved by the
[56:54] blood.
[56:56] So, redemption came through the blood,
[56:59] just like
[57:01] Israel. It didn't
[57:03] matter how how many plagues hit, how
[57:07] many things, Satan just kept hardening
[57:10] his heart, hardening his heart. So,
[57:12] finally, he said, "I'm going to send the
[57:14] death angel.
[57:16] Right. It just death. You reject putting
[57:21] the
[57:22] blood on the the little post of your
[57:26] heart
[57:28] and it's death,
[57:32] right? If you if if you if you say that
[57:36] if you call the Holy Spirit in this hour
[57:39] be
[57:40] elabub, there's no forgiveness for that
[57:43] in this life or the life to
[57:47] come. And so to
[57:50] reject God's provided way, there's no
[57:53] salvation outside of it. God only meets
[57:56] us under one ground and that's under the
[57:58] shed blood. And Jesus said, "I am the
[58:01] way, the truth, the life. No man come
[58:04] unto the father, but by me. No
[58:06] firstborn."
[58:08] And the firstborn represented carrying
[58:11] forth the birthight.
[58:14] And the birthright will not be carried
[58:17] further without the blood. And that's
[58:19] the trouble with the Pentecostal church
[58:22] and churches today. They're trying to
[58:24] carry the birthright forward without the
[58:27] blood.
[58:31] They had to eat the lamb, which is a
[58:34] type of eating the full word of God.
[58:38] And they had to put the blood on
[58:41] display.
[58:45] So you they had to step
[58:48] out and
[58:50] identify their faith. Every believer's
[58:54] got to identify himself.
[58:58] He had to stand right up there. They got
[59:01] up there. They boldly put the blood out.
[59:04] And there was one big
[59:07] question. Can you imagine Satan saying,
[59:10] "Oh, what happens if he don't
[59:12] come? You've just marked yourself a dead
[59:15] person. The Egyptians are going to come
[59:18] here and they're going to slay every
[59:20] single
[59:21] one who has that mark of blood on them."
[59:26] And isn't that what the world says
[59:28] today? They'll slay you thinking they're
[59:32] doing God a
[59:34] service. They'll backbite you at work.
[59:37] They'll undermine you. They'll take the
[59:40] littlest, teeniest thing to kick your
[59:42] job out, steal your retirement, do
[59:47] anything. Think you're not strange
[59:51] at the fiery darts of the enemy or the
[59:54] trying of your faith. But they had to
[59:57] identify because redemption for Israel
[1:00:01] came through the blood.
[1:00:06] And they identified with the blood and
[1:00:09] the death angel came through and
[1:00:11] everybody who was in under that blood
[1:00:15] was saved.
[1:00:17] Oh, can you imagine that morning when
[1:00:22] they woke up and they were
[1:00:25] alive and all of Egypt was
[1:00:29] wailing crying.
[1:00:31] Little boys were crying because their
[1:00:34] brothers have died. Their their fathers
[1:00:37] were were dead, their grandfathers,
[1:00:40] their pets, their cows, everything. It
[1:00:43] was miserable. And I'll tell you, once
[1:00:46] you come out of the world under the
[1:00:48] blood, you realize how miserable living
[1:00:52] in the world is. It's miserable.
[1:00:57] No happiness, no joy, no peace, no
[1:01:00] security, no future.
[1:01:04] You know, everybody everybody crying. I
[1:01:06] if I go have coffee with some old guys,
[1:01:08] they'll sit back, "Oh, my 401k went down
[1:01:11] 1,800 points."
[1:01:13] I said, "Praise God, my salvation just
[1:01:19] grew. Store not your treasures up where
[1:01:22] the thieves can break in and steal
[1:01:25] them." And they
[1:01:27] will. They'll steal
[1:01:30] them. But so you you you had to
[1:01:33] understand that redemption for Israel
[1:01:36] was through the blood.
[1:01:39] Our redemption was through the blood.
[1:01:43] Israel was called to put the
[1:01:47] blood on their doorstep and when they
[1:01:50] put the blood on their the pillars of
[1:01:54] their door. So they they put the blood
[1:01:56] and then when the death angel passed
[1:01:59] they were redeemed but that opened the
[1:02:02] door for them to start traveling on a
[1:02:06] different ground.
[1:02:09] They were now going forward,
[1:02:13] right? But what
[1:02:15] happens after a little
[1:02:19] while? The old task
[1:02:22] masters, the old
[1:02:24] smoking, the old drinking, the old
[1:02:28] games, the old lusting, the old
[1:02:30] backbiting, the old bitterness, all the
[1:02:33] old grudges. They all try to come back.
[1:02:38] Right? That's a scripture. He says when
[1:02:41] you clean your house and you get rid of
[1:02:44] them, that devil goes out and finds
[1:02:46] seven
[1:02:48] more and tries to regain
[1:02:52] entry. So he comes back at
[1:02:56] you. Here he
[1:02:58] comes. He comes
[1:03:01] back trying to give just just like he
[1:03:04] does with every believer. He comes back
[1:03:08] and and he accuses you. Oh, you're not
[1:03:11] gonna
[1:03:12] escape. He tries to put fear in you. Oh,
[1:03:17] I'm afraid I'm going to go back. I'm
[1:03:20] afraid I'm going to fall. And then you
[1:03:23] just start living in such deprivity, so
[1:03:27] worried. You know, I I I I get the I I I
[1:03:31] do good and I quit for a while and it
[1:03:33] comes back on, man. and I do good and I
[1:03:35] quit for a while and and then here I am
[1:03:38] again. And and you you try with all your
[1:03:41] strength and all your might and
[1:03:44] everything you can, but you just can't
[1:03:47] get rid of that
[1:03:52] taskmaster. Now, you were
[1:03:55] redeemed. You're out of
[1:04:00] Egypt. You're free.
[1:04:03] Not only did you go free, but you took
[1:04:06] riches with you, joy, peace, happiness.
[1:04:10] You were you were
[1:04:11] excited. You were on fire. But oh my.
[1:04:15] Then you get out there. And here they
[1:04:18] come. Here's Israel now. They got the
[1:04:21] mountains on one side. They got the army
[1:04:24] on the other side. They got the water in
[1:04:27] front of them. And now they want to know
[1:04:30] what am I going to
[1:04:32] do? All these task masters have
[1:04:36] surrounded me again. And now they're
[1:04:40] back where they need a
[1:04:43] redemption. But how's he going to redeem
[1:04:45] them this time? By
[1:04:50] power. Redemption by power. How's he
[1:04:54] going to do it?
[1:04:56] He's going to open up a
[1:04:59] way to cross over
[1:05:03] right on the journey to the promised
[1:05:07] land.
[1:05:09] Once they got past that, it was only a
[1:05:12] few days journey.
[1:05:16] So here they are.
[1:05:20] All those task masters, all those
[1:05:23] memories and and the devil's right
[1:05:25] there. What
[1:05:29] if? What
[1:05:33] if? What if? I always say this, ands,
[1:05:38] if, buts, and wise are all Satan's
[1:05:43] lies. That's a little saying I carried
[1:05:45] with me. Another little saying I carry
[1:05:48] in my heart. Where there's any, there's
[1:05:54] plenty. That's just kind of God I
[1:05:56] believe. But here they were. It looked
[1:06:01] impossible. And that's the way it is
[1:06:03] with
[1:06:04] us. It's impossible to get rid of the
[1:06:07] task masters. But what did he do? He
[1:06:10] opened up the water.
[1:06:13] Right? And that was a type of the
[1:06:16] promise through water baptism of the
[1:06:18] Holy Spirit.
[1:06:21] And so off they went. And what did that
[1:06:25] power do? The power came down and and
[1:06:29] Satan comes after you and and and and
[1:06:33] fear sets in and and all of a sudden
[1:06:36] what does he do? He closes up
[1:06:39] the sea and
[1:06:42] destroys all your tasks, master.
[1:06:45] Hallelujah.
[1:06:47] Yes, sir. Just think of it.
[1:06:52] Now you're on the bank.
[1:06:56] You've climbed up out of the water.
[1:06:59] You're on the
[1:07:02] bank. Everything's behind you.
[1:07:06] You look there, no more armies of Egypt,
[1:07:09] no more nothing.
[1:07:12] So what what was the
[1:07:16] completeness of their redemption? Now
[1:07:19] they were redeemed from Israel.
[1:07:25] Now their only enemy was themselves.
[1:07:31] But what did they do? I I I I just I
[1:07:35] I'll read a statement here. It's
[1:07:39] paragraph 98, I believe, in and uh in
[1:07:44] redemption, redemption and completeness
[1:07:47] in joy. That's the way Miriam and them
[1:07:50] did. Looking back down, they saw all
[1:07:54] them old things that they once done was
[1:07:59] all dead and gone.
[1:08:02] Amen. That's that's what you do. You're
[1:08:04] not afraid of smoking no more. You're
[1:08:07] not afraid of drinking no more. You
[1:08:09] don't want to hurt anybody anymore.
[1:08:13] The taskmaster's dead.
[1:08:18] I'll guarantee you none of them dove
[1:08:21] back in to the Red Sea, seeing if they
[1:08:24] can find somebody that whooped them, if
[1:08:26] they could revive them again.
[1:08:31] They didn't sit back and say, "Oh, that
[1:08:33] poor devil."
[1:08:38] I I I should have looked it up because
[1:08:40] it's one of my favorite things. He said,
[1:08:43] and I I I wish I I I used to have it
[1:08:46] memorized, but he said, "The Egyptians
[1:08:48] that you see this day, you shall see no
[1:08:51] more."
[1:08:54] That scripture is just so good. I don't
[1:08:57] know if you can find it real quick and
[1:08:59] throw it up there, but but that that's
[1:09:02] what he said. This day don't fear
[1:09:06] because these people who tormented you,
[1:09:09] this day you shall see them no more. No
[1:09:11] one knows that scripture
[1:09:14] anybody. Exodus 14:13. All right. Exodus
[1:09:18] 14:13. Let's just read that.
[1:09:23] Did you know, brother Rem said he tried
[1:09:25] to read the book of Exodus at least once
[1:09:28] a
[1:09:32] week?
[1:09:34] Exodus
[1:09:36] 14
[1:09:41] 13. All
[1:09:43] right. Exodus
[1:09:46] 14. All right. Okay. Exodus
[1:09:54] Exodus
[1:09:56] 14:13. And Moses said unto the people,
[1:09:59] "Fear not. Stand still, and see the
[1:10:03] salvation of the Lord, which
[1:10:07] he and see the salvation of the Lord,
[1:10:10] which he will show
[1:10:12] you today. For the Egyptians whom you
[1:10:16] have seen today, ye shall see them again
[1:10:21] no more forever. Woo!
[1:10:25] Hallelujah.
[1:10:26] No more No more nicotine fits. No more
[1:10:30] alcohol shakes, no more drugs, no more
[1:10:34] hatred, no more fear of seeing the
[1:10:37] bully. Nothing. They're They're gone.
[1:10:44] That's the Holy Ghost. That's the ground
[1:10:47] of the believer.
[1:10:49] He don't have to keep fighting those
[1:10:51] things. He don't have to resurrect those
[1:10:53] things. He possesses the gates of the
[1:10:56] enemy. He says, "Get behind me, Satan.
[1:11:02] You're not going to lose
[1:11:06] because you go back to the fact." What
[1:11:09] did they go back to? the fact the blood
[1:11:12] was at the door
[1:11:14] and he redeemed us.
[1:11:18] Then they got back, the taskmasters come
[1:11:21] back at them. And what did the Lord do?
[1:11:23] He come down in the whirlwind in the
[1:11:26] pillar of fire. And what did he do? He
[1:11:28] redeemed them again, but this time by
[1:11:32] power.
[1:11:36] Gave him the power to overcome.
[1:11:41] So, and here they are. They climb up on
[1:11:44] that
[1:11:45] bank and they realize it's over.
[1:11:50] It's over. Yes, sir. They're not going
[1:11:53] back to Egypt cuz Egypt's no more.
[1:11:59] They're not going They're not turning
[1:12:01] around.
[1:12:04] They ain't turning back.
[1:12:06] Will you sing that song? I won't go
[1:12:08] back.
[1:12:09] I'm not going to go back. I've come too
[1:12:12] far. I'm not going back. They didn't
[1:12:13] even have Egypt to go back to.
[1:12:17] But just watch a little while.
[1:12:20] They climbed up on the
[1:12:23] bank. And and I was
[1:12:26] reading. They done seeing God accept the
[1:12:30] blood, done seeing his power in divine
[1:12:33] healing standing between them. come
[1:12:37] through the Red Sea, were baptized with
[1:12:40] the spirit, walked on the other side,
[1:12:42] just having a good time. They they
[1:12:46] they didn't care what all the
[1:12:49] organizations thought about it. What a
[1:12:52] perfect type is today of the believer
[1:12:55] who will dare to step out.
[1:13:01] Got to step out on the ground.
[1:13:05] God promised that he would supply their
[1:13:07] every need. He promised he would supply
[1:13:11] our every need. He never told them,
[1:13:14] "I'll make a way of healing. I'll make a
[1:13:17] way of this. I'll make a way of that."
[1:13:19] He said, "I'll be with you." Hallelujah.
[1:13:23] And that's what he said to us. I'll be
[1:13:26] with you even in you till the end of the
[1:13:29] world. That's all I have to say. You
[1:13:33] don't have to argue this, that, or the
[1:13:37] other. If he's here, that satisfies me.
[1:13:42] Divine healing is here. Power is here.
[1:13:47] Everything he was, he is now.
[1:13:51] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:13:54] and forever. You can take your theology
[1:13:57] and drown it with with it, brother. I
[1:14:01] believe Jesus Christ is the same
[1:14:02] yesterday, today, and forever. I'll be
[1:14:05] with you even in you till the end of the
[1:14:08] world.
[1:14:11] And there they came out and he was with
[1:14:14] them. And they had a little basket of
[1:14:18] bread on their head, was all eat up and
[1:14:22] gone. Didn't have anything. They went to
[1:14:25] bed a little hungry. The next morning
[1:14:27] they got up and bread was laying all
[1:14:29] over the ground. Hallelujah.
[1:14:35] Miriam grabbed her tambourine and
[1:14:37] dances. Moses lifted his hands and sung
[1:14:39] in the spirit. What were they?
[1:14:43] Their salvation was completed in joy.
[1:14:50] that that's when your salvation is
[1:14:53] completed. When you know your
[1:14:55] taskmaster's gone, you know you're not
[1:14:58] going back. That world is dead to you.
[1:15:03] You don't even want to go back. That's
[1:15:05] right. Amen.
[1:15:08] But you
[1:15:10] know and then they started on the
[1:15:13] journey you know and that that is
[1:15:17] just see if I can find another statement
[1:15:20] out of this message that it is is just
[1:15:23] so wonderful.
[1:15:31] Uh he
[1:15:35] says so you know so you know they went
[1:15:39] up and you know their journey then
[1:15:41] things got get tough. They started to
[1:15:44] loathe the bread. They started get they
[1:15:46] had bitter water on and on and
[1:15:51] on and they
[1:15:55] forgot that they had redemption.
[1:15:59] The God that put the death angel is
[1:16:03] still the same. The God that destroyed
[1:16:06] their enemy is still the same. And now
[1:16:09] they forgot. When David came up against
[1:16:12] Goliath, what did he do? He remembered
[1:16:14] the lion. He remembered the bear. He
[1:16:17] went back to every deliverance. He went
[1:16:19] back to his calling. He went to back to
[1:16:22] his anointing. He went back and
[1:16:24] associated with everything that God had
[1:16:27] done for him. And the joy of the Lord
[1:16:30] filled his heart.
[1:16:35] And when
[1:16:37] David got down,
[1:16:40] he never went back and said, "Lord, save
[1:16:42] me.
[1:16:43] He said, "Restore to me the joy of my
[1:16:48] salvation
[1:16:52] because that's where your redemption was
[1:16:54] completed
[1:16:56] was in joy.
[1:17:00] They were so
[1:17:02] happy to come
[1:17:04] out. We know Egypt
[1:17:08] types the
[1:17:11] uh world
[1:17:12] He
[1:17:15] said, he says, Moses just cut it
[1:17:18] down and threw it in the water and
[1:17:21] changed the whole thing. Good sweet
[1:17:23] water. Now when they come against one of
[1:17:27] your bitter waters or some another like
[1:17:30] that, there's a tree tonight spiritually
[1:17:34] speaking hanging over in
[1:17:37] Galatha or the world tonight that
[1:17:41] sweetened any bitter waters that ye may
[1:17:45] may be led by. That's right. The Calvary
[1:17:49] will sweeten any experience.
[1:17:55] Just think, no matter how what a hard
[1:17:57] time you're going through,
[1:18:01] no matter
[1:18:04] how things set in, I know I've got
[1:18:07] another body.
[1:18:11] I know there's another land beyond the
[1:18:15] river.
[1:18:17] I cannot let these
[1:18:20] things rob
[1:18:23] the
[1:18:24] completeness of my redemption because
[1:18:28] redemption is completed in joy. And he
[1:18:33] said and he says that's right. Calvary
[1:18:36] will see sweeten any experience. Many
[1:18:40] times we get into hard places and wonder
[1:18:43] how
[1:18:46] how did I get
[1:18:49] here? So I shut my eyes sometimes and I
[1:18:53] think yonder on
[1:18:55] Galatha where my redeemer bled and died
[1:19:00] for my life. Then my trials seem so
[1:19:05] little.
[1:19:09] See he redeemed
[1:19:11] it by the blood.
[1:19:14] He redeemed
[1:19:16] it by power. Yeah. And now he completes
[1:19:21] it with joy unspeakable
[1:19:25] and full of glory looking towards the
[1:19:28] end of the faith and the salvation of
[1:19:31] your soul. What did our prophet just
[1:19:33] said? I just closed my
[1:19:35] eyes and I think there was someone that
[1:19:38] died for me.
[1:19:40] He
[1:19:41] said, "And then my trial seems so little
[1:19:44] I just throw
[1:19:46] aside and walk on. It makes sweet. It
[1:19:51] sweetens every experience I ever had."
[1:19:55] He always sweeten it when I come to my
[1:20:00] waters of Mara.
[1:20:03] Now we're about to catch them now over
[1:20:07] in the wilderness after all those great
[1:20:11] signs and wonders. The revival had
[1:20:14] quieted down. And the first thing you
[1:20:17] know when the revival quieted down, they
[1:20:21] forgot all
[1:20:23] about the
[1:20:27] miracles. The greatest miracle Yes, sir.
[1:20:31] in my life is when Jesus Christ met me
[1:20:34] on that
[1:20:36] rooftop and when I wrote
[1:20:39] Romans chapter
[1:20:42] 1 and I knew he loved
[1:20:47] me. Everything else that's the only
[1:20:51] place that God meets a believer is under
[1:20:54] the shed blood.
[1:20:57] That's the only place the death angel
[1:21:00] passes.
[1:21:02] Redemption by the
[1:21:04] blood. And then he smites every one of
[1:21:08] your task masters, gives you a new
[1:21:11] nature, takes the desires away. They
[1:21:15] didn't come out of there
[1:21:17] with
[1:21:19] power, some extra special power. You
[1:21:23] know what power they had? They had the
[1:21:25] redemption of the blood, the redemption
[1:21:28] by the power of the elimination of their
[1:21:30] task masters and a promised land that
[1:21:33] they that was theirs to walk to.
[1:21:38] Now they were free to live in every
[1:21:42] promise.
[1:21:45] And that's what he said he'd be with us.
[1:21:48] And if he's with us, he'll do what's
[1:21:51] best for us. And he goes on, he
[1:21:55] said, he says, and and they just just
[1:22:00] like the people today, they forgot what
[1:22:02] God did last year, what God did at the
[1:22:07] meeting out here at the high school. You
[1:22:10] forget all about it. See what God did
[1:22:13] and you just forget about it. Now
[1:22:15] notice, and because they begin to argue
[1:22:18] with one
[1:22:21] another, what's starting to happen? The
[1:22:25] joy is starting to
[1:22:34] erode. You know, the Baptist and the
[1:22:36] Methodists, our church is biggest and
[1:22:38] and they just on and on they go. That's
[1:22:42] when the desert when his lives out in
[1:22:46] the desert began to murmur, murmur, and
[1:22:50] complain. What I tell you, I tell you,
[1:22:55] when that old pastor was here, that old
[1:22:58] preacher that preached the old time
[1:23:00] religion like that, I you know, and and
[1:23:03] all of a sudden, what starts to happen?
[1:23:06] We start to complain.
[1:23:09] complaining and
[1:23:11] murmuring robs you of the
[1:23:15] completeness of your redemption.
[1:23:19] Your redemption is completed in joy. You
[1:23:23] go home and listen to the tape. You can
[1:23:25] take that down
[1:23:31] now. Oh, it's harder than I thought. I
[1:23:33] thought you just pressed the button.
[1:23:34] There you go.
[1:23:36] I'm learning these things
[1:23:40] slowly. You know, it's
[1:23:43] hot. People start complaining, "Oh, it's
[1:23:45] so hot. It's so hot." You know, why
[1:23:48] don't you just say, "Praise God for air
[1:23:51] conditioning. Oh, this nice cold glass
[1:23:54] of water is so refreshing. Oh, shade
[1:23:58] tree, I just love you." and you go put
[1:24:01] your arms around the tree and you thank
[1:24:04] God for the leaves and and and you're
[1:24:07] just so you know you're not going to
[1:24:09] murmur about the heat. Oh man, it's hot.
[1:24:12] Oh man, it's hotter in hell. Praise God.
[1:24:15] I'm not going to hell. I didn't mean
[1:24:17] that the way you took it.
[1:24:21] I'm not going to a place that's hotter
[1:24:23] than this.
[1:24:26] Praise God. I ain't going there. This
[1:24:27] heat ain't nothing compared to that. All
[1:24:30] of a sudden you you remain in the joy.
[1:24:33] If you remain in the joy, you remain in
[1:24:37] the
[1:24:38] completeness of your redemption. You
[1:24:41] remain under the blood. You remain in
[1:24:44] the power. You remain on the ground.
[1:24:47] That's right.
[1:24:48] But you know, if you start murmuring and
[1:24:50] complaining, the prophet of God said the
[1:24:52] Holy Spirit just flies back, finds a
[1:24:55] little limb, and just waits till you
[1:24:58] settle down.
[1:25:03] So watch
[1:25:08] yourself. Monitor
[1:25:13] yourself. You know, I'll wear a monitor
[1:25:15] on me that lets me know what my levels
[1:25:18] are. And you know, I'm sitting on an
[1:25:21] airplane and when that thing goes off,
[1:25:24] it goes off. Of course, it went off in
[1:25:27] the plane and I said, "Oh no, we lost an
[1:25:32] engine." And then I looked over and
[1:25:34] said, "Are you
[1:25:38] saved?
[1:25:42] Our salvation's complete.
[1:25:47] Our task masters are gone.
[1:25:50] The Egyptians we see, we see no more.
[1:25:55] And now the only thing he can do is rob
[1:25:58] us of the
[1:26:00] joy of our
[1:26:02] redemption. And what
[1:26:04] happens if if our joy isn't on display?
[1:26:09] Nobody wants what we have.
[1:26:13] We have no evidence
[1:26:15] that we're redeemed
[1:26:18] because redemption is completed in joy.
[1:26:24] We We don't need to be miserable.
[1:26:29] You say, "Well, brother McGary, you
[1:26:30] don't understand. I have zero money in
[1:26:34] my bank account." Right? Well, he said
[1:26:38] the righteous won't beg bread.
[1:26:42] So, if you don't have no money in your
[1:26:44] bank account, I suggest you go turn
[1:26:47] every stone.
[1:26:51] In your life,
[1:26:54] but we just go borrow money.
[1:26:58] We run to the church and we borrow
[1:27:02] money, you know, and and and so,
[1:27:06] brother, can you lend me this? Can you
[1:27:08] lend me that? And and we say, "Oh, sure,
[1:27:10] brother. Uh, here, I'll lend you the
[1:27:12] money." And then we never pay it back.
[1:27:16] Or or we we turn our tithing into a loan
[1:27:19] payment.
[1:27:22] Or we put money in the offering and
[1:27:24] think that does it.
[1:27:29] Don't leave the ground.
[1:27:33] Stay stay in the power.
[1:27:37] Don't let the taskmaster come in. Stay
[1:27:39] in the power of of your redemption.
[1:27:44] Don't let those say that's why the
[1:27:46] scripture says, "Owe no man anything."
[1:27:48] That's right.
[1:27:52] And I'm not talking about house bill or
[1:27:54] car
[1:27:55] payment. It means don't get in a
[1:27:58] situation where you're not going to pay
[1:28:00] back what you
[1:28:04] borrow. Of course, I just write it
[1:28:08] off because I go back to Calvary and I
[1:28:11] think of all that he forgave me and I
[1:28:14] think, Lord, this there's probably
[1:28:15] something I forgot to repent of.
[1:28:20] I go back to what the prophet of God did
[1:28:22] when they tore his fence
[1:28:23] down. You just close your
[1:28:26] eyes and you go back to Calvary
[1:28:30] and you
[1:28:31] see that the death angel passed you. You
[1:28:35] have eternal life. And you think about
[1:28:38] that. I've got eternal life. The death
[1:28:41] angel has passed me by.
[1:28:46] And then I think about my task masters.
[1:28:49] They're not going to come get me no
[1:28:51] more.
[1:28:53] I'm free.
[1:28:56] And I'm not worried about cocaine. I'm
[1:28:58] not worried about smoking pot. I'm not
[1:29:01] worried about shooting up. I don't care
[1:29:03] anything about it. I have no desire for
[1:29:06] it.
[1:29:09] I don't care about ball games.
[1:29:13] I just don't care.
[1:29:15] I I don't that doesn't bother me. If
[1:29:18] someone wants to go watch a game, that's
[1:29:21] fine. It's just that I I that doesn't
[1:29:25] that's not in me anymore.
[1:29:28] And I rejoice in that.
[1:29:31] It's not condemnation. It's not accusing
[1:29:35] you.
[1:29:37] I don't care if you like the Cowboys or
[1:29:41] not, you know, or this team traded this
[1:29:44] team and this guy went here and
[1:29:47] everybody's falling apart and then
[1:29:48] someone comes up and he says, "Dad, it's
[1:29:51] all
[1:29:52] rigged. The whole thing's rigged. All
[1:29:55] sports is rigged. All All this is
[1:29:58] rigged. Everything's rigged." And I just
[1:30:00] think back, it's Yeah, it's rigged. But
[1:30:03] then my heart beats inside. So is my
[1:30:05] salvation.
[1:30:07] Hallelujah.
[1:30:09] It was rigged before the foundation of
[1:30:11] the world. That he wouldn't lose a one.
[1:30:16] And we go back and we restore our
[1:30:21] joy. Don't let anything rob you of the
[1:30:27] completeness of your redemption.
[1:30:30] Don't let
[1:30:33] sickness, you know, Satan says, "Well,
[1:30:35] you're going to die." No, no, Satan,
[1:30:37] wait a minute. No, no. If if if this
[1:30:41] cancer gets me, alls it is to me is a
[1:30:44] house remodel.
[1:30:49] If if this cancer is going to go on,
[1:30:51] it's just going to remodel this flesh.
[1:30:54] Going to update it to a young
[1:30:57] body, I'm not going to let my joy go
[1:31:01] because my salvation is completed in
[1:31:06] joy. And that's what they
[1:31:09] did. They
[1:31:11] lost their joy. They forgot everything
[1:31:16] that God did and they murmured and their
[1:31:19] complained and alls it did was
[1:31:23] prolonged their
[1:31:25] journey. And that's all Satan is trying
[1:31:28] to do is keep us here longer and
[1:31:34] longer so he can have more
[1:31:37] chances to deceive
[1:31:39] us. And now he's got a nice little rosy
[1:31:44] American in there that sounds like he
[1:31:48] reads the
[1:31:51] Bible. Oh, he's just such a good man.
[1:31:56] He's got two
[1:31:58] forks and on his head, two horns on his
[1:32:01] head. He's got a forkid tail and he
[1:32:05] carries a
[1:32:07] pitchfork. He's the diabel.
[1:32:13] That's bottom
[1:32:14] line because my Bible tells me that
[1:32:18] Satan appears as an angel of
[1:32:22] light. So, the world's going to get
[1:32:25] crazy, but our redemption has already
[1:32:29] been won.
[1:32:31] And the completeness of our
[1:32:34] redemption is joy.
[1:32:37] I give you peace. Jesus said that
[1:32:42] surpasseth all understanding. I give you
[1:32:45] joy and we can rest in that. You say,
[1:32:51] "Well, I don't have joy." Go
[1:32:54] back to your
[1:32:57] calling. Go back to the blood that kept
[1:33:02] the second death away from you.
[1:33:06] Go back to the task masters that have
[1:33:09] come out of your life. And don't fear
[1:33:12] the future. He who started a work in you
[1:33:15] will complete it till the end. And that
[1:33:18] gives
[1:33:20] me
[1:33:21] joy. Amen. God bless you tonight. Pray
[1:33:24] for our brothers as they get ready to go
[1:33:26] out and minister.
[1:33:29] Uh, if anybody wants to look at the
[1:33:31] colors that we'll put up there, I'll
[1:33:34] I'll put them out here. And if you want
[1:33:37] to and I I'll I'll number them one, two,
[1:33:40] and three. And you can pick a
[1:33:43] color. And then I'll look at them and
[1:33:45] pick a
[1:33:48] color. And I know you're saying, why do
[1:33:51] you care what color it is? You don't
[1:33:53] look at it.
[1:33:56] But I just might have eyes in the back
[1:33:59] of my
[1:34:00] head. So you always got to be careful.
[1:34:04] Be happy. You love them. Amen. God bless
[1:34:07] you. Let's stand this evening. A
[1:34:10] wonderful tape if you want to listen to
[1:34:12] it. Uh uh uh complete
[1:34:17] uh redemption incompleteness of
[1:34:20] joy. Uh
[1:34:23] 1954. And uh I 3:30 I believe great
[1:34:29] great sermon. It really inspired me and
[1:34:32] I I was thinking on joy. I wanted to
[1:34:35] preach on joy and the Lord just
[1:34:38] quickened me to go listen to this and it
[1:34:41] really was a blessing to me. So let us
[1:34:43] bow our heads. We'll get Billy to come
[1:34:45] and close the service and uh dismiss us
[1:34:48] in prayer tonight. Heavenly
[1:34:52] Father, it's so wonderful to be a
[1:34:56] Christian, Lord. and not the deception
[1:34:59] of the Christian of the
[1:35:01] world, but to know what hour I'm living
[1:35:05] in. knowing I've been chosen for a
[1:35:09] resurrection and a
[1:35:12] rapture. That I have a new
[1:35:15] body. Oh Lord, that nothing's going to
[1:35:22] keep. Just nothing can pluck me out of
[1:35:26] the palm of your hand.
[1:35:28] And as my love grows for you, Lord, and
[1:35:32] you continue to show your love for
[1:35:35] me, the things of the world just get
[1:35:39] cold. And I realize I can't make it
[1:35:42] without you.
[1:35:46] Father, I'm sure I could probably live
[1:35:48] alone
[1:35:50] and in my own world, but I love to be
[1:35:53] around the
[1:35:55] saints, other people that you've
[1:35:58] bought, that you've
[1:36:01] delivered, to see the smile on their
[1:36:04] face, the joy in their
[1:36:07] heart. So happy that they know that
[1:36:11] their lives are in the palm of your
[1:36:14] hand.
[1:36:15] in all their hearts desires for their
[1:36:18] loved ones, their offspring, for people
[1:36:22] that they have a burden for to get
[1:36:26] saved. I can know assuredly that you'll
[1:36:29] give them the desire of their heart.
[1:36:34] Lord, let us not
[1:36:37] forget
[1:36:39] yesterday and all the
[1:36:42] goodness. How you called us, how you
[1:36:46] destroyed our
[1:36:48] taskmaster. How we danced on the shore
[1:36:51] of
[1:36:51] redemption. How happy we
[1:36:54] were. How we shouted amazing grace. How
[1:36:59] sweet the
[1:37:00] sound. Lord, that burden and heaviness
[1:37:05] was so
[1:37:07] heavy and it just seemed to be so
[1:37:13] lifted. Oh, Father, restore unto us our
[1:37:18] joy. We ask it in Jesus precious name we
[1:37:24] pray. Amen. What's the name of that
[1:37:27] song? I like that.

[1:37:33] [Music]

[1:45:41] Amen. You feel joy tonight in your
[1:45:44] heart. We have nothing to be sad about.
[1:45:47] Amen. Let's just bow heads. Gracious
[1:45:49] father, so thankful for your word
[1:45:52] tonight, Lord. And father, I can
[1:45:54] certainly say from my own heart that I
[1:45:57] feel joy. I feel happy, Lord. And
[1:45:59] father, your word removes depressions.
[1:46:02] Your word removes the cares of the
[1:46:04] world. Your word just cleans us off, oh
[1:46:06] God. And what a fountain of life that we
[1:46:09] have that we could drink from, Lord, and
[1:46:11] be renewed every single day, Lord. And
[1:46:13] Father, no matter what's going on, Lord,
[1:46:15] your word always has the answer to what
[1:46:18] we have need of. We're so thankful for
[1:46:19] that, Lord. And and Father, I pray may
[1:46:22] we drink more of this fountain. May this
[1:46:24] just bubble up in our hearts every day
[1:46:27] that Lord, even as we heard, that your
[1:46:29] joy may be in display every moment of
[1:46:31] our lives, Lord. And forgive us, Lord,
[1:46:34] where we've gone wrong. And Lord, that
[1:46:36] we may be reminded tonight as we heard,
[1:46:38] Lord, that your joy that you give us is
[1:46:41] eternal, Lord. There's nothing that can
[1:46:42] happen in this world, Lord, that can
[1:46:44] bring us to the place where the devil is
[1:46:47] trying to attack us that we should
[1:46:49] remember always that you are with us and
[1:46:51] you're walking with us. That's the
[1:46:53] promise that you made that you'll not
[1:46:54] only be with us but even in us until the
[1:46:57] end. Father, bless us as we go out of
[1:46:59] here. Lord, that we may go out of here
[1:47:01] victorious people and know that the
[1:47:03] victory is not even overcame today, but
[1:47:06] it was already given to us since the
[1:47:08] foundation. Walk with us every step of
[1:47:10] the way, Lord. Those that couldn't be
[1:47:12] here. Father, I pray for every single
[1:47:14] one of them, Lord. May you guide them
[1:47:17] and lead them, oh God, and bring them in
[1:47:19] that same joy, Lord, that we as a body,
[1:47:22] Lord, we as a together we may experience
[1:47:24] of that joy that you promise we'll have
[1:47:26] every day, Lord. Bless our pastor, Lord.
[1:47:29] And Father, I pray that you touch his
[1:47:31] knees and just make him well, Father.
