Description:
Sunday  Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
January 25th, 2026
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Are you there? Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. This is where you are. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Everywhere. Are you Do you care? with a wild. Heat. Heat. Here are Do you remember? Heat. Heat. Are you alive? you feel? Heat. Heat. the world. He Our heat. Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. Good morning. Let's stand this morning and approach the Lord in prayer. and certainly welcome everybody online. It's like the first COVID service we had when the government shut down our churches and I remember uh we of course next door and the police showed up our first service to count to make sure we didn't have any more than 10 people. But uh they allowed us to have a few more and uh and that's when we started our streaming and uh so we welcome all our streamers this morning and uh we're happy we have this service and uh there's many others that uh churches are closed down and they let us know that they're joining us this morning. So, we welcome uh those of you who are fellowshipping with us this morning because your churches are not open. Uh we uh certainly know how that feels and but we don't want you to forget that uh uh your church still needs your support and uh if you don't have service, set your offering aside, set your tithing aside so it doesn't become a whole lot. That's for all the churches, all those of you that are viewing in from other states and other places. Uh don't forget that the expenses continue to go on. And so make sure you help support your local assembly. So let's approach the Lord as one body. Those that are visiting with us this morning, uh our local assembly that's streaming, the handful that's here, looks like the upper room, about 12 of us or so. So, we're so wonderful for that. Let us pray. Our gracious heavenly father. Your loving kindness to us is unmeasurable. your fervent desire, Father, to bring us back to where we've come from. reveal yourself to us and have fellowship with us. Is it's something we can't comprehend that you would want to walk with man and love man and have fellowship with us, Father, with such the great sinners that we are. And yet you so loved us, you gave your only begotten son that the blood would be an eternal covering for our failures. And Lord, we have no righteousness to offer you. All of our righteousness is in your son, Christ Jesus. And we're here to exalt him this morning and lift him up. Father, we ask that your spirit would move within our hearts and the joy of the Lord would be our portion. And we never become discouraged or have doubt that you will not leave us nor forsake us, but that you'll be with us even in us till the end. Father, we may we never fear or doubt that you know exactly what we have need of even before we ask. and that you promised us to supply our every need. Father, may we never fear or doubt your undying love for us. And Father, we can't even begin to express our gratefulness. And we wonder, Father, at all that you've done on our behalf. And we worship you this morning. Heavenly Father is many are at home snowed in, iced in, Father, and they're joining us. May we feel the unity of your spirit this morning. May we feel the eternal presence of your word, how it's remained the same from the beginning of time to this very morning. And may the joy flood our souls to know that you have chosen us and that you call us your children and we can call you father. Thank you, Lord, and bless us this morning with worship in your word. For we ask it in the precious name of our Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you. We'll turn the service to Brother Billy. Lord willing, we'll be back next Sunday to minister. I'm just battling a little pneumonia, but uh we'll be able to go forward. God bless you, Brother Billy. Sometimes it's multitudes. &gt;&gt; That's exactly &gt;&gt; Sometimes a handful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With a grateful heart, give thanks to the holy one.

If you could count brothers and if you could just come and take these things before the church Lord, once again we just approach your throne of mercy and grace, Lord, and we're thankful that we can gather in a place of worship, Lord, a place that you can put your name in, Lord, a place of escape, a place of peace, and that's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And so, as maybe there were not needs read before you, but you're the discerner of the heart. Lord, you're the one that needs knows all the needs. And I pray this morning that you would visit every need. Lord, we know your Holy Spirit is right there next to to the believer is in the believer, Lord, as a matter of fact. And anything that we have need of, we can just touch the hem of your garment. We don't have to ask. All we have to do is just have that small seed of faith, as small as a mustard seed. If we could just believe like that, Father, then all things are possible. Oh, it's all things are possible to those that believe. We want to be believing children this morning, Lord, claiming the promises you've given us. Lord, may you bless the ones that are home and the ones that couldn't come. May you reward them, Lord. We know it's not easy to drive on these roads, but there's been a sacrifice that has been made behind the scene so the word could go forward. Father, Lord, may you reward that. May you just bring, Lord, your anointing upon us this morning. May you use the vessel, Lord. May you speak to your bride. It's not a matter of the quantity, it's a matter of the quality, my Lord. Lord, and we just that we trust that this morning, your will would be done. And that we would just be, Lord, able to just be molded by your word, Lord. Dressed in your glory, Father. Lord, just being able to be risen up in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. That word that will never fail, Lord. The word that would always lift us up. The word that would always heal our heart. The word that would always take us out of a condition, Lord. the word that would always just put us in the place where you want us to be. Lord, I ask that you would just be able to have your way this morning. Bless the ones that made the sacrifice to come. May this just draw from you and pull upon the word. May you bless the ministry. Bless all the musicians, Lord. Bless the song leader. Bless everything that has part in this place. And we just love you. We just thank you. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. You are the healer. Healer of my heart. Maker and God of all. We are the broken vessel in your hand. You looked beyond my hurt and made me whole again. Healer of the broken pieces.

As you pray, let's just Lord Jesus, thank you. &gt;&gt; Lord, you said there were two or three are gathered in your name. Lord, that you'd be right here in our midst. And Lord, we're so thankful that you are not a man that you would lie. But Lord, there might just be of a few of us gathered here this morning. Lord, you're right here present with us. And Lord, for those that are gathered with us on the streaming, Lord, you're with them right there in their home. Lord, for you said, I'll be with you even in you until the end, Lord. So, we're just looking that you would come, Lord, in our humanity and in our mind, Lord. There would certainly be much negativity and things to discourage us and to hinder the service. But Lord, you're greater than all. Lord, how great you are, Lord. You're you're greater than anything in the world. You're greater than our doubts. You're greater than our fears. You're you're greater than our complexes. You're greater than our failures, Lord. You're greater than everything, Lord. And you said, "If I be lifted up, I will draw all men in, Lord. We just want to lift you up this morning." him. We invite you to come, Lord, in in a powerful way, Lord, for that you would meet a need and speak to somebody's heart, Lord. Father, we are not looking what man can do, but Father, we're looking past the veil and we're looking past the humanity this morning, Lord. And I'm asking, Lord, that you would come and do what only you can do, Lord. That you would just take the bread of life and you'd start to break the word and you'd speak to our heart, LORD. MAYBE THERE'S A LOST soul somewhere. Maybe somebody's trying to find their way and and they don't know who THEY ARE. LORD, MAY SOMETHING BE SAID, SOMETHING be done that would open their eyes, Lord, that that seed would be quickened, Lord. Maybe somebody's been pressing the battle for many years and they've come into A HARD SPOT AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE THE NEXT move or make the next step, Father. But I'm asking that the power of the Holy Ghost would come and anoint your word and quicken that word to their heart, Lord, that they could step out in faith, Lord, and claim the victory. We love you, Lord. We just commit ourselves to you. Ask that you come now and just have your will and way in the service. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. We'll just ask you to turn in your your Bibles. And we'll just be reading out of Luke 15:11. Amen. I just felt maybe to come down to uh to ground level here. And uh just feel a little bit more connected with you. I know in in small settings many times um that helps quite a bit because uh you you get maybe a little bit further away from the people and you feel a little bit more uh uh disconnected and so I feel if we can we if we can feel connected here we'll feel a little bit more connected through the stream anyways. So I say let's just have church. &gt;&gt; Amen. you know, I I don't know what's going to happen. And I I tell you what, part of me uh I I thought, well, I'll just play a tape, you know, I mean, I'll just play a tape and and uh we'll get the word and, you know, we'll we'll we'll we'll done well, but you know, I'm just I'm thankful we have a pastor and he felt led to have church and he felt led to ask me to preach and so I'm going to preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm glad you came here to pull because we know one thing that uh you're the one that operates the gift. And so sometimes it's in the small gatherings, you know, there's less there's less uh there's less baggage and less weight. You know, there's less to pull through. But hey, we'll just see what God God has in store. And if it's not maybe for somebody right here, we we pray God would go to those that are streaming online. So we're we're thankful that you've gathered with us and just pray that God would be your portion. So reading out of Luke 15 and and verse 11, Luke 15 and 11. And it says, "And he said, a certain man had two sons, and the younger of them said to his father, father, give me the portion of goods that fallth to me, and he divided unto them his living." And not many days after the younger son gathered alto together and took his journey in into a far country. And there wasted his substance with riotous living. And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in the land. And he began to be in want. And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country. And he sent him into his fields to feed the swine. And he would have fain have filled his belly with the husk that the swine did eat. and no man gave unto him. What a condition that this this son had found himself in. Isn't that something that he's in the pig pin now and he's going to be fighting with a with a pig over over some just husk that's been thrown out and no one will give unto him. What what a what a what a a miserable condition for a son of God to find himself in. And he says in verse 17, "And when he came to himself," he said, "How many hired servants of my father have bred enough to spare, and I perish with hunger? I will arise and go to my father, and I will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and no more worthy to be called thy son. Make me as one of thy hired servants." And what did the father do? Did he did he did he tell him? You know, you know what? You're not even worthy to be my son. No. He said he arose and came to his father. But when his f when he was a great far off, oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; His father saw him. Amen. Do you know what it's like for the father to see a far off maybe way out there in some type of condition, you know, and he and he had compassion and ran &gt;&gt; and fell on his neck and kissed him. Amen. You we just ask a blessing on the reading of the word. you may have your seat. Um, also just as I was in the back um there, I would I would feel that, you know, there's not too many uh there's just a few of us. So maybe maybe maybe this might be the time to be longer. I don't know. You know, hey, we there ain't nowhere to go. There ain't nothing to do. We're snowed in. So, uh, so I I say, let's just take our time. As I was there in the back, why don't you just turn over me within your Bibles to Luke 12? And this just as I was sitting back there uh just meditating on maybe how the Lord would go in the service uh and thinking of this son I I've been uh feeding on spiritual amnesia and certainly um what the if I could say the glasses I've been looking through I was listening to that is certainly within what our pastor has been preaching on about character and how he preached on on on unused promises and I I the way I've been looking through this a lot of that is in the spiritual amnesia of not recognizing who we are or what we have. Therefore, we never take advantage of or never manifest our character or or never move into the promises of God because uh there's something hindering us from having access or claiming or walking into it. A and and this might seem like a a hard hard press or tied together, but Luke 12 and 15. Is everybody there? Amen. I can't hear the Bibles turning at home, but I'm sure everybody at home got their Bibles out and and you're all supercharged and ready for service. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. I I'll give you a moment to turn there, too. But I'm just reading out of Luke 12 and verse 15. And it's picking up in the story where where Jesus is given the parable and he says and he said unto them take heed and beware of covetedness for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possess. Thank God. And he spake a parable of them saying the the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentiful. And he thought within himself saying what shall I do because I have no room where to bestow my fruit. And he said this will I do. I will pull down my barns and build greater and there will I bestow all my fruit and all my goods and I will say to my soul soul. Have you ever done that? I I will Matthew you you just you're doing good. That's a great idea. You know you you just got it all. You know what? I'm a message believer. Come on. &gt;&gt; He says, "Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years. Take thine knees, eat, drink, and be married." I mean, hey, we're going in the rapture. We've received a prophet. I mean, let's take it easy. &gt;&gt; We can't miss it. &gt;&gt; I'm predestinated. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God said unto him, "Thou fool. This night thy soul shall be required of thee. Then who shall those things be which thou hast provided? A and it just struck me as I as I was I was just thinking about this and you know here in this moment this prodal son he came to himself and and maybe just looking at this other story in that moment here he thought well you know what I I'll just I'll just say unto myself so I'm I'm going to take it easy and and and and something that maybe for a title this morning I just want to title this living in the moment. living in the moment and just taking out of the text when it says uh that the prodical son he came to himself and brother Brandon would say this in the story uh he he he mentions at the very end of spiritual amnesia he starts to talk about how that soldier boy and and how he was on the the train and and they got shocked from war and they had spiritual amnesia and these guys they didn't know who they were they were I mean the bombs going off and maybe the trauma and everything that they saw they actually had an amnesia where they did not even know their name. They didn't know where they were from. And they came into a condition where no doubt they might not even know how to talk. They just stare at the wall. And and and and it shows this uh gives this picture of how the these soldiers they came to a place and they stopped and maybe there were some getting off or or they had to pick up some and they let these soldiers out for for a little a little break there. and a and and they would watch the soldiers and one of them he said he he he he got he got to to he he got to looking around and brother Brandon would say this in spiritual amnesia in paragraph 164 said they watched one young fellow there he got out and began to look around at that water tank. He looked all around over the hill and he he rubbed his face and he studied and he looked again and he seen that water tank. He looked all around at the station and he started walking &gt;&gt; and instead OF THE GUARDS STOPPING HIM, he followed him and he went up over the hill and down a little path and he turned to the right and went up over another hill and he come to a little log cabin and he looked and coming out on the porch, an old man with a cane in his hand come out and throw his arms around him. He said, "My son, I know you would return. They told me YOU WERE DEAD, BUT I know you would return." And the boy come to himself. &gt;&gt; His amnesia left him. &gt;&gt; HE COULD IDENTIFY WHO HE WAS. HE KNOWED THAT WAS HIS FATHER. &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET OF GOD WOULD SAY THIS, "OH SOLDIER OF THE CROSS THAT'S BEEN SHOCKED WITH SO MUCH TRAINING." &gt;&gt; OH, look at how he lays that in. HE SAYS, "THAT'S BEEN SHOCKED WITH SO MUCH TRAINING." I I SAY SOMETIMES WE'RE SHOCKED WITH WITH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE MESSAGE. I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS QUOTE FIT AND THAT QUOTE FIT AND I'M GOING TO BINGE LISTEN TO THE PROPHET. I'M GOING TO LISTEN TO ALL THE SEVEN SEALS and I'm going to listen ALL THE WAY TO CHRIST THE MYSTERY OF GOD REVEALED AND I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO THE HEBREW SERIES. Oh my, I'm going to start with faith AS A SUBSTANCE 47. I'M GOING TO LISTEN ALL THE WAY TO 65 BECAUSE MAN, I GOT TO FIGURE THIS THING OUT. And then YOU TRY TO TIE, OH, THIS IS WHAT BROTHER BRANDON MEANT AND THAT WHAT'S BROTHER BRANDON MEANT. AND THEN AND THEN YOU START OFF IN THIS TRAIL LIKE, MAN, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT BROTHER BRANDON MEANT IN YOUR FELLOWSHIP. And then all a sudden another quote JUST TOTALLY TEARS DOWN YOUR WHOLE idea that you had. And you're like, "Okay, well that's not what this is what, brother Brandon MEANT." AND THEN THEY YOU START TO TRY TO EXPLAIN AWAY EVERYTHING YOU THOUGHT, but you're you're EXPLAINING AWAY QUOTES THAT YOU WERE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU YOU I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I WHAT I BELIEVE. AND THEN YOU GET INTO A PLACE WHERE YOU YOU START GETTING DISCOURAGED THAT YOU DON'T FIT IN AND I YOU KNOW I MAYBE I ain't catching up and I ain't in tune and and ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GET TO A PLACE YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL. YOU MIGHT BE STARTING TO GET a little spiritual amnesia. Well, it really don't even matter. Why do I even listen to the tapes? Why do I even listen? And then you, if you're not careful, a little more amnesia, you'll start setting in just like, well, maybe I'm just a Christian. But training will do it. Help me out now. &gt;&gt; Come on. Train. He says training. SO MUCH TRAINING. SO MANY SHOCKS OF DENOMINATION and creed and things of the world. Why don't you just step off for a few minutes and go to looking around at the Bible? &gt;&gt; Do we even do that anymore? &gt;&gt; Do do we even go to looking around in the Bible? Do we take our time and sit down and break out the Bible and say, "Lord Jesus, I want to look around a little bit and I want to find out more who you are, more of who I am, Lord. Give you give me some ammunition today. &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to quench some fiery darts of the devil. I I want to be victorious, Lord. And I know it's through your word." &gt;&gt; Go to looking around in the Bible. might wander around and you might find yourself identified here in the word as a believer one of these days. He says you might not know him. You may come to yourself like the prodical son did and find yourself you might find your identification in the words of God. I I just want to say that that the word of God is your identification. &gt;&gt; The word of God is your everything. The word of God is it's your all and all. I mean, I it's your guide. It's your I it's your it's your leader. It's your shepherd. It's it's your absolute. It's your guarantee. The the word of God is everything. I mean, it's it's everything that you ever had need of. I mean, it's it's I don't know what else you're looking for, but I I I say it it's all that you need. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say that's where I want to find my identification. That's where I want to find my absolute. That's that's where, you know, I I I want to put all of my hope and all of my trust. I WANT TO PUT IT INTO the word of God. AND I AND I KNOW THAT THE letter kleth, but it's the spirit that giveth life. I want that word to become alive in me. You know, I that that word strikes me, you know, a guarantee. You know, SO MANY TIMES YOU YOU MIGHT GO BUY A CAR OR YOU GO BUY SOMETHING AND AND SOMEBODY'S ALWAYS WANTING TO SELL YOU SOMETHING. You say, and they want to give YOU A GUARANTEE. &gt;&gt; WELL, I GUARANTEE you that you know that this thing will last for 10, 20 YEARS. WELL, I GUARANTEE you it probably won't if you keep using it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I think maybe the guarantee is is that they know a percentage of people will never take you up on the guarantee. &gt;&gt; You know, SOMETHING SAYS, "I GUARANTEE THIS FOR FOR FOR 20 YEARS, you know, AND IT BREAKS AFTER WE COME ON. I I'VE I'VE BOUGHTEN SOME RAKES AND SHOVELS AND THEY GOT GUARANTEES, you know, and the I you know, at least at least SOME OF THEM HAVE A WARRANTY, &gt;&gt; you know, but it don't last too long. AND NOT MANY PEOPLE GO BACK AND TAKE UP ON THE WARRANTY, &gt;&gt; MAN. So many PEOPLE GIVE A GUARANTEE AND YOU KNOW IT AIN'T guaranteed for nothing. I guarantee you that this last some people some people guarantee I'll do this and I'll do that. Well, you know what? You find out that man really can't guarantee much. &gt;&gt; I know one thing I can do is I can guarantee you that I'll fail you. I will let you down. I will make a promise. I will. Right. THAT'S ON THE HUMAN SIDE. BUT OH GOD, IF WE COULD EVER BE SO SURRENDERED TO THE HOLY Ghost that he can take control of our lives that we're that word that we're BELIEVING IN COMES FLESH in us and then therefore we can be an extended hand, we can be living in the moment, WE COULD BE CHRIST HAND EXTENDED. &gt;&gt; And just laying that principle in there, you know, THAT THAT WE WE MIGHT FIND OUR IDENTIFICATION in the word. And and I just want to pick up second Peter chapter 1, if you'll turn there with me. Amen. Maybe everybody got their coffee and you know, they're they're settled in and and uh you know, I I I'm I'm sure uh there's not anything else going on in in the house and you're focused and in tune. Praise the Lord. We can we can get on here and see how many people are streamed in and watching and hallelujah. Praise the Lord. I hope you're warm and not cold and and everybody here, you're doing well. Praise God. All right. Second Peter 1 3. Are are we doing okay? &gt;&gt; All right. According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue. Aren't you so thankful for that? My my what a promise. whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that we might just sit around, &gt;&gt; that we might just pat ourselves on the back. That we might say, "I've arrived. &gt;&gt; I might say to myself, soul, I'm doing pretty good. I can take it easy." No. that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. You know, you know, uh uh uh uh so many times we just want to look at all the the all the mountain tops, but you know, HAVING DIVINE NATURE HAS A lot of valleys a and and I just where I would just kind of uh uh bring back to our remembrance, you know, our pastor was preaching on unused promises and he was he he referenced this scripture how that it's by these promises that we are made partakers of divine nature. And if we are IF WE ARE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE and manifesting the promises that that give us and make us partakers of divine nature, then we're leaving the divine NATURE AND CHARACTER OF GOD UNDISPLAYED. &gt;&gt; AND I tell you, that should be the heart's cry of the believer in the day and hour that we're living in is we want the message of the hour to become so flesh in us that IT'S THE VERY DIVINE nature and character of God THAT IS THAT HAS COME AND TABERNACLED HIMSELF IN OUR LIVES. AND DON'T FORGET THE TITLE. I'M TALKING ABOUT LIVING in the moment. That every moment is an OPPORTUNITY THAT THE DIVINE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF GOD MIGHT BE EXPRESSED IN YOUR LIFE AND your situation. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE WASHING DISHES, sweeping the floor, if you're going to work. You know, EVERYTHING WE DO OUGHT TO BE DONE UNTO THE LORD. YOU KNOW, I I ALWAYS REMEMBER, YOU KNOW, I HAD A JOB WORKING at McDonald's when I was 15 years old. And and you know, and and and and I you amazing to me, it takes 10 people now to do the job, but one person did. I I mean I ran the register. I I did the lobby. I wiped down the tables. I changed out the trash. You know, MCDONALD'S TOLD ME HOW TO TIE A TRASH bag around a trash can. You know, those things are very useful. I say if you AIN'T GOT A JOB, GO TO MCDONALD'S. THEY'LL PROBABLY HIRE YOU. IT'S A GOOD place to work. But you know, SO MANY TIMES WE LET PRIDE GET IN FRONT. MY SOUL SAITH TO MYSELF, I SHALL NEVER WORK AT MCDONALD'S because &gt;&gt; you never know that might be a good career for you. Right. &gt;&gt; I mean, we sometimes we just GET TOO MUCH PRIDE IN OUR WAY. BUT I SAY IF GOD MAKE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU AND TO GIVE YOU A JOB, YOU MIGHT FIND A SOUL. YOU MIGHT GET THE LA, HEY, THAT LAST ONE MIGHT BE THE COOK AT MCDONALD'S. LET'S GO HOME. LET'S GET OUR PRIDE OUT THERE. QUIT SAYING TO YOUR SOUL, I I YOU KNOW, I YOU KNOW, I'VE DONE WELL. NO, I TELL YOU WHAT, WE OUGHT TO UH LEAVE THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE BEHIND BEHIND and press towards the mark OF THE HIGH CALLING OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Where were we? Divine nature. We we we want TO MANIFEST THAT DIVINE NATURE IN in everything that we do. And we want to be living in that moment. and every moment whether whether it's a job at McDonald's or or whether it's listen I remember I worked at McDonald's there and and you know I'd be having TO GET IN UNDER YOU KNOW under the uh climb into the bench and there's some dirty nasty cheeseburger crunched down with ketchup all over in the corner of the wall and I could just skip it but you KNOW I ALWAYS THOUGHT WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEBODY'S WATCHING ME I ALWAYS HAD THAT THOUGHT &gt;&gt; I I wasn't even, you know, I AT THE TIME 15 THAT is right around, you know, where really I GOT A LITTLE SPIRITUAL amnesia uh in this message. You know, I I've I've mentioned it before where when you get uh when you get caught between two opinions, you lose your reason. You know, I don't want to get into all that, but one day I USED TO TELL EVERYBODY WHY I DIDN'T do everything. And and then one day they asked me, "Why don't you do do it?" And I gave the wrong answer. I said, "Well, it makes you cough." And I said, "Well, that was THE WRONG REASON." &gt;&gt; NO, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WE DON'T DO BECAUSE WE'RE A CHRISTIAN. THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS WE DON'T DO BECAUSE WE'RE A BELIEVER. THERE ARE CERTAIN PLACES WE DON'T GO CUZ WE'RE A BELIEVER. THERE'S CERTAIN MUSIC WE DON'T LISTEN TO BECAUSE WE'RE A BELIEVER. AND I SAY THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME YOUNG PEOPLE WHO GOT A BACKBONE ENOUGH WHEN YOU'RE HANGING out with a youth group and they're listening to Tik Toks and INSTAGRAMS AND ALL THESE THINGS. THAT OUGHT TO BE SOMEBODY WHO WHO WHO AIN'T GOT SPIRITUAL AMNESIA THAT SAYS, "I KNOW I'M A SON AND A DAUGHTER OF GOD AND I GOT TO DISPLAY THE DIVINE NATURE OF ALMIGHTY GOD AND SAY, "BROTHERS, SISTERS, I DON'T THINK WE OUGHT TO LISTEN TO THAT. I I KNOW IT'S FUNNY. I KNOW IT'S A GOOD LAUGH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T THINK IT'S PLEASING TO OUR LORD. I SAY THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR EACH ONE OF US TO DISPLAY THE CHARACTER, THE DIVINE NATURE OF ALMIGHTY GOD, &gt;&gt; you know, and and and AND WITH THAT THOUGHT IN MY MIND, YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO? I' it would help me to do my job better. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, I was like, you know what? I'LL GO THE EXTRA MILE. I'LL RE I'LL CLEAN IT UP. YOU KNOW, CUZ IF SOMEBODY'S WATCHING ME, WELL, I DIDN'T I DIDN'T KNOW THERE IN THAT SPIRITUAL REALM THAT I HAVE A HEAVENLY FATHER WHO'S WATCHING ME. HE'S WATCHING ALL OVER MY LIFE. AND IT COULD BE IN THE VERY LITTLE THINGS OF REACHING A LITTLE BIT FURTHER JUST TO PICK UP A LITTLE BIT MORE. YOU LITTLE KIDS. OH, MAYBE NOT TOO MANY OF YOU HERE, BUT HOPEFULLY YOU'RE STREAMING ONLINE AND YOU AIN'T OUT MAKING SNOWMANS. I WANT TO TELL YOU, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN PICK UP THE TRASH FOR YOUR MOMMY AND DADDY, YOU YOU YOU YOU CAN YOU CAN TRY TO HELP THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE OH, I WANT TO TELL YOU, IT'S SUCH AN AWESOME THING WHEN YOU'RE LITTLE KIDS. I CAN TELL YOU, THEY CAN BE 5 YEARS OLD, 6 YEARS OLD, SEVEN YEARS. I DON'T CARE. THEY BE 14 OR 15. YOU KNOW, THEY CAN HELP THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE HOME. YOU YOUNG KIDS, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN HELP CHANGE THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE HOME. MOMMY AND DADDY COULD BE HAVING A HARD TIME. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THE PRESSURE AND THE BILLS AND AND THEY'RE WONDERING HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PAY THE RENT AND ALL THESE THINGS AND THE KIDS ARE ARE FUSSING AND FIGHTING. OH, I SAY THERE OUGHT TO BE A 12YEAR-OLD OR A 14-YEAR-OLD SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT, MOMMY? EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. I KNOW GOD IS IN TOTAL CONTROL. I'VE NEVER SEEN THE RIGHTEOUS FORSAKEN OR BEGGING." I WANT TO TELL YOU, GOD WANTS TO EXPRESS THE DIVINE NATURE OF ALMIGHTY GOD IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US. I DON'T CARE HOW YOUNG YOU ARE. YOU MIGHT BE FOUR, YOU MIGHT BE FIVE, YOU MIGHT BE 10, YOU MIGHT BE 60, YOU MIGHT BE 80. BUT I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S PEOPLE THAT HAVE COME IN CONTACT WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND FIRE AND THEIR LIFE IS SO SOLD OUT, LOCK, STOCK, AND BARREL THAT THE HOLY GHOST AND FIRE IS JUST OOZING OUT THROUGH THEIR LIFE IN OUR 13 YEAR OLDS AND OUR 15 YEAR OLDS AND THEY CAN EXPRESS THE DIVINE NATURE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, I say, LORD JESUS, HELP US IN THE I'M TALKING ABOUT LIVING IN THE MOMENT, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; Let's live in the moment right now. &gt;&gt; Let's have church. AMEN. &gt;&gt; LET'S THANK GOD FOR HIS GRACE AND FOR HIS MERCY. SAY, "OH, GOD, I WANT THAT DIVINE NATURE living in me." &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just laying a LITTLE BIT OF A FOUNDATION to work towards a a point by the help of God. You know, we're such a small group. We can even have an intermission maybe. You know, tell the people at home because, you know, they're taking intermissions like all the time. You know, up and down. Hey, it's all right. We're going to have church. &gt;&gt; You know, I've been there. I've streamed. I've done both. I've got my suit on and my tie and I sat down and I amened and I've done that and then I I've done it where I didn't get all suited up and you know I'm sure we have a mixture this morning but that's okay. The important thing is that we're hearing the word of God &gt;&gt; and faith comes by &gt;&gt; hearing the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's what we want to do is we want to hear the word of God and we want to put that word of God into action and we want to manifest the the the the attributes and the character of almighty God. So we're talking about living in the moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when this prodal son he came to himself just think about this now here here is this prodal son and now he's had spiritual amnesia. Now, I don't know if any of you have been in a in a in a pig pin before, but maybe I don't know if you ever gotten stuck in any mud, but just think about a dirty, stinky, rotten, smelly uh huh pig pin and it's it's all muddy and and and oh, it just stinks and it's foul and you you've been trying in that mess to to eat on some old corn uh uh husk and everything. And all of a sudden, in that moment, he realizes, "What am I doing?" &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He looks at his condition. &gt;&gt; He's muddy. He's stinky. &gt;&gt; But when HE COMES TO HIMSELF, WHAT DOES HE SAY? YOU know what? I'm going to go home. And in that moment, YOU KNOW WHAT HE HAS TO DO? Living in that moment, he doesn't say, "Well, you know what? I don't look like a son. I don't smell like a son. No one would even think that I'm a son of a father like that. &gt;&gt; But you know what he had to do? He had to start to walk out &gt;&gt; of his condition. &gt;&gt; He had to start to walk out of that pig pin. And a lot of times we find ourselves in a mess. &gt;&gt; And in the moment we made a mistake that got us there. &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU THERE'S ANOTHER MOMENT. AND that moment IS WHEN YOU COME TO YOURSELF AND YOU SAY YOU I'M A SON OF GOD. I SAY THAT'S THE TIME TO START WALKING OUT OF THAT SITUATION. WALKING OUT OF THE PIG PIN. START WALKING OUT. COULD YOU IMAGINE? HERE HE STARTS WALKING OUT OF THE PIG PIN AND HE GETS OUT OF THERE. NOW HE'S WALKING THROUGH THE FIELD AND AND MAYBE THE MAN THAT HIRED HIM SAID, "HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?" HE SAID, "I'M GOING HOME TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE." YOU FATHER'S HOUSE. HE'S LIKE, "YEAH, MY FATHER'S HOUSE, MAN." I mean, like he got a a million of what you got. &gt;&gt; I don't even KNOW WHY I MEET YOU. OH, MY FATHER OWNS A CATTLE ON A THOUSAND HILLS. You You mean you're TRYING TO TELL ME YOU HAVE A DADDY THAT'S RICHER THAN ME? You don't You don't look like you could have a daddy RICHER THAN ME. YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAD A FATHER LIKE THAT, YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER GOTTEN YOURSELF IN THAT SITUATION. I tell YOU WHAT, DON'T YOU DON'T YOU ALL YOU GOT TO SAY IS, "HEY, IF YOU EVER NEED HELP, I WANT TO TELL YOU I GOT A FATHER THAT CAN HELP YOU." YOU JUST KEEP WALKING. &gt;&gt; LIKE THAT LIKE THAT THAT THAT LIKE THAT SOLDIER BOY. HE SAW THE WATER TOWER. YOU KNOW, JUST STAY ON THE PATH. JUST KEEP WHERE ARE YOU GOING, BOY? WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? WHY DON'T YOU COME ASIDE? COME HERE. YOU KNOW YOU'RE OUT OF THE PIG PIN NOW. YOU DON'T NEED TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK THERE. WE GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR YOU. I DON'T STOP. KEEP WALKING. KEEP GOING. THE WORD IS YOUR GUIDE. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I YOU MIGHT NOT LOOK LIKE A SON. YOU YOU MIGHT NOT SMELL LIKE A SON. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But you're a son and daughter of God. And in one moment YOU MIGHT HAVE MADE A BAD DECISION. IN ONE MOMENT YOU MIGHT COME TO YOURSELF AND REALIZE I'M IN A PIG. BUT I WANT TO SAY IT'S WHAT YOU DO LIVING IN THE MOMENT. &gt;&gt; Where are you GOING TO SET YOUR AFFECTIONS? WHAT DIRECTION ARE YOU GOING TO GO? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO LAUNCH? ARE YOU JUST GOING TO STAY THERE AND HAVE A PITY PARTY? OR ARE YOU GOING TO SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M TIRED OF BEING IN THE PIG PEN. &gt;&gt; I'M A SON OF GOD. I AIN'T GOING TO STAY HERE ANYMORE. WHERE YOU GOING? I'M GOING HOME. &gt;&gt; SHUT UP, DEVIL. I AIN'T I'M GOING HOME." WELL, YOU CAN'T GO BACK THERE. YOU SMELL. I DON'T CARE. I'M GOING BACK TO MY I'LL LET HIM TELL ME WHAT I SMELL LIKE. &gt;&gt; Some of US WANT TO CLEAN OURSELVES ALL UP AND MAKE OURSELVES CLEAN ENOUGH FOR GOD. YOU CAN'T DO IT. YOU CANNOT GET CLEAN ENOUGH TO WALK INTO HIS PRESENCE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN COME INTO HIS PRESENCE AND HE'LL WASH YOU. HE'LL CLEAN YOU. HE'LL HEAL YOU. HE HE'LL CLEAN YOU ALL UP. HE'LL LOVE YOU. HE'LL PUT A ROBE ON YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We're talking about living in the moment, sir. &gt;&gt; I say keep going. STAY ON THE PATH. AND JUST THINKING ABOUT THAT, RIGHT? YOU KNOW, uh uh uh uh what was it? HE WAS COMING TO HIMSELF. AND I BELIEVE THAT that that there's a SEED ON THE INSIDE OF EVERY BELIEVER and and and and that and God is wanting THE WORD TO COME AND the spirit to come and and anoint that seed and quicken that seed and and BRING IT TO LIFE AND IT SPRING UP and start to manifest itself. &gt;&gt; And I believe that he wants to do that in every day. that I I DON'T WANT THIS SERVICE THIS MORNING JUST TO just to be a service where we did our duty. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; All right. Let's let's get let's get home cooking. MAY MAYBE IT'S US RIGHT HERE. MAYBE IT'S ONE OUT THERE. But but but I DON'T WANT TO JUST PAT MYSELF ON THE BACK AND I SAY, "OH, SO I'M A MESSAGE BELIEVER, BUT LORD, IN THE MOMENT, in every day, every hour, I want to express your divine nature. I I want your character to be on full display. AND MANY TIMES WHAT WE FIND OUT WE SHOULD BE COMING DOWN TO THE FINETUNING, THE FINE HONING. WE OUGHT TO BE MATURE uh sons AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. WE OUR LIVES WE WE SHOULD WE WE'RE JUSTIFIED. WE'RE SANCTIFIED. WE'RE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. AND NOW WE'RE MOVING INTO ALL THE PROMISES OF GOD. THE THE CAPSTONE IS SETTLING DOWN UPON OUR LIVES WHERE OUR ACTIONS ARE HIS ACTIONS. We're coming into adoption, RIGHT? WHERE MY THE STEP I TAKE IS THE STEP HE WANTS ME TO TAKE. THE WORD THAT I SAY IS THE WORD THAT HE WANTS ME TO SAY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Do we get it right every time? &gt;&gt; See, I'm talking about living in the moment. &gt;&gt; And many times we'll feel an uncction of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You know, call so and so and see how they're doing. I I I usually if it's positive &gt;&gt; and and will further THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND HELP SOMEBODY OUT, THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT'S GOD. BUT THE OTHER THOUGHT IS WELL YOU KNOW THEY probably are busy &gt;&gt; and many times in the I'm TALKING ABOUT LIVING IN THE MOMENT &gt;&gt; MANY TIMES WE DISMISS the uncction. &gt;&gt; Many times we're WE'RE WE'RE SOMEWHERE AND SOMETHING IN US YOU FEEL IT WELL enough &gt;&gt; and I the ONLY ONE SAYS I I SHOULD TELL THEM THAT GOD SENT A prophet &gt;&gt; and AND IT'S BUILDING UP. YOU KNOW, YOU YOU'RE WANTING TO DO IT AND AND AND AND YOU YOU feel like, okay, and then something happens, SOMETHING CHANGES, LIKE, WELL, I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. AND THEY GO &gt;&gt; and then you feel disappointed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Maybe. Was that the Holy Ghost? Was that GOD WANTING TO EXPRESS HIS CHARACTER? WAS THAT THE DIVINE NATURE WANTING TO shine out and witness and minister? &gt;&gt; I'm talking about living in the moment. Amen. &gt;&gt; Help me out now. So, Brother Brandon would say this, "What was the Holy Ghost given for?" HE SAYS, "THE HOLY GHOST WILL FOLLOW GOD'S word to the letter." And and a preacher behind THE PULPIT THAT AIN'T GOT GRACE ENOUGH TO PREACH IT. I DOUBT HE'S GOT IT. THAT'S JUST EXACTLY WELL, THAT'S WHAT THE HOLY GHOST is for. It's to give to give uncction to the preacher. It's to give holiness to the group. IT'S TO SET THE CHURCH IN ORDER. IT'S TO BRING A unity of spirit. It's to unite us together with power. IT'S TO UNITE US TOGETHER WITH LOVE. BROTHERLY LOVE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; But sometimes we don't get it right. Is it too loud for y'all? &gt;&gt; Is it all right? &gt;&gt; It's loud. It's louder now with 20 people than it is with 400. &gt;&gt; But that's all right if it ain't too loud for you. WE DON'T ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT. &gt;&gt; BUT THEN NOW I'M TALKING ABOUT LIVING IN THE MOMENT. You're living in the moment and you make a bad decision &gt;&gt; now. YOU CAN TRY YOU CAN STAY IN THAT moment &gt;&gt; and just waddle around in your in your bad decision &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; but I WANT TO SAY YOU GOT ANOTHER moment &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; now. I just want to LOOK AT AN EXAMPLE in scripture real quick. Just thinking about living in the moment. I I MEAN JUST UH MAYBE IF YOU'LL TURN IN YOUR BIBLES to to Matthew 16. We just have a little Bible study here. enjoy ourselves in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Is that Is anybody warm? &gt;&gt; Is it Is it warm in here? It's too warm in here. That That is Is it too warm in here? This is the only time we can ever do this. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Cuz I am warm. Hallelujah. We're warm, brother. Now, everybody, this is the one time you can touch the thermostat because you're at home. Hallelujah. All right. Matthew 16. Was it that where we're at? Okay. I did plug it in here. Matthew 16 and 17. Now, let's just look at this. I was just thinking about Peter, right? Says, "And Jesus answered and said unto them, blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah, for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto you, but my father which is in heaven. And I also SAY UNTO THEE, THOU ART PETER, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it, and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. &gt;&gt; I say Peter must have been a flying high. Maybe Peter looked over at James and John and said, "Uh-huh. Told you. I mean, Peter, you know, I mean, come on. You know, that must have felt good. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I mean, he got it right. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; How and OH, YOU TALK ABOUT BEING VINDICATED. &gt;&gt; Here's the son of MAN TELLING HIM &gt;&gt; YOU GOT THE right revelation. &gt;&gt; And I want to You want TO KNOW HOW YOU GOT THE RIGHT REVELATION IS WHEN YOU HAVE THE REVELATION of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And any revelation outside of that is the wrong revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And here the SON OF MAN IS TELLING HIM, "WHO DO YOU SAY THAT I AM?" HE SAYS, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." AND HE SAID, "PETER, FLESH and blood didn't reveal that to you." Even even, it's amazing what revelation is because it goes beyond the flesh. &gt;&gt; But he was he was making SURE THAT WE UNDERSTOOD. IT WASN'T ABOUT YOUR CALCULATION. It wasn't about what you witnessed. IT WASN'T ABOUT SEEING THIS PICTURE OVER HERE. AND IT WASN'T ABOUT, OH, YOU KNOW, I SAW THE PICTURE OF THE CLOUD IN 1950 and and and then then they they TOOK ANOTHER PICTURE IN IN FEBRUARY 28TH AND AND I HEARD THIS TESTIMONY AND I HEARD THAT TESTIMONY AND I SEEN ALL THESE MIRACLES AND YOU KNOW, BY ALL OF THAT I KNOW. NOPE. &gt;&gt; NOPE. &gt;&gt; The only way you know is is if it's given to you to know. &gt;&gt; I'm starting to feel a LITTLE GOOD THIS MORNING CUZ IT AIN'T ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU CAN CALCULATE. IT AIN'T ABOUT HOW MANY MESSAGES YOU CAN LISTEN TO. IT AIN'T ABOUT HOW MUCH MATERIAL YOU CAN GATHER TOGETHER. IT AIN'T ABOUT VINDICATING the message. You think WE WERE PUT HERE TO VINDICATE the message intellectually by WHAT WE COULD FIGURE OUT AND WHAT WE CAN LISTEN TO. THE ONLY WAY WE CAN VINDICATE THE MESSAGE IF IS IF WE SAY I BELIEVE the message AND THAT WORD THAT WE AMEN BECOMES FLESH IN YOU. AND NOW THE WORD THAT WAS PREACHED THROUGH A VINDICATED PROPHET HAS TAKEN ON FLESH IN YOUR BODY. AND NOW YOU ARE THE VINDICATION. YOU ARE HIS VICTORY BECAUSE NOW THAT WORD HAS TAKEN ON FLESH IN A MANY MEMBER BRIDE BODY. &gt;&gt; BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT IT HAS TO be a revelation. &gt;&gt; And here Peter in that MOMENT I MEAN MY hallelujah the seven seals are revealed. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW HE HE GOT THIS HE'S FLYING HIGH right &gt;&gt; and now then verse 20. Are we okay? We have we we doing all right. &gt;&gt; THEN HE CHARGED HIS DISCIPLES THAT THEY SHOULD TELL NO MAN THAT HE WAS Jesus Christ. From that time forth be he he began to show unto his disciples how that he must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised up again on the third day. And Peter to James. Hey guys, you hearing this? Our our Lord, our Christ, they're not going to surely they're not going to kill you. Matter of fact, you know, I'm on the mountaintop. I got the revelation. Lord, you don't you don't you don't got to look at this 22. Then Peter took him and began to rebuke him. &gt;&gt; And that's what happens sometimes if you're not careful on the mountaintop. &gt;&gt; He might forget your place. &gt;&gt; And he began to REBUKE HIM, SAYING, "BE IT FIRE FOR ME, LORD. THIS SHALL NOT BE UNTO THEE." &gt;&gt; Maybe he looked at Peter and James again and went, "Uh-huh. Come on. our Lord, the Messiah. This is we know he's going to totally expunge the Romans and and he's going to give us back to the kingdom and he called us and and there's no way he's going to go far be it from you, Lord, to fulfill what you've come to fulfill. &gt;&gt; Uhoh. Does that happen in our own lives through trials and difficulties and and molding of character and the expression of the divine nature? We come into trials and we come into situations and we try TO REBUKE THE TRIAL WHEN GOD IS WANTING the trial to BRING OUT A CHRISTLIKE CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; LOOK, if if if you if you live if you live in the moment WHEN I AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS it has TO BE THE HOLY GHOST living out through you. It has to be a surrender TO THE HOLY GHOST. IT HAS TO BE ANCHORED IN THE WORD OF GOD. WHEN YOU DON'T FEEL IT, WHEN YOU CAN'T UN EXPLAIN IT, WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO LOSE YOUR MIND, THERE THERE'S SOMETHING DEEPER, A DEEP SETTLED PIECE IN THE SOUL, THERE'S A REVELATION LIKE JOB THAT CAN SAY, "THOUGH HE SLAY ME, YET I'LL TRUST HIM. I KNOW THAT I'LL STAND ON THE EARTH AND I SHALL SEE MY REDEEMER." WHY? BECAUSE YOU GOT A REVELATION. THAT'S HOW YOU LIVE IN THE MOMENT IS BY REVELATION. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And Peter wasn't living by that re revelation. Now &gt;&gt; what WHAT DOES JESUS GO TO SAY? HE TURNED UNTO Peter and said, "GET THEE BEHIND ME, SATAN. &gt;&gt; Thou art an offense unto me, for thou savorest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men." &gt;&gt; You talk about once you're on the mountaintop and now you being in the gutter. He wasn't look HE WASN'T LOOKING AT JAMES AND JOHN GOING, "UH-HUH." WAIT, WHAT? What'd he say? I I'm tell I'm I'm I'm leaving church. I'm out of Did you hear what the pastor said about me? &gt;&gt; I'm out of here. I'm telling you. You talk about THE EMBARRASSMENT. ONCE HE'S UP THERE on the mountaintop, once he's feeling good, you I got the I GOT THE REVELATION. HALLELUJAH. GOD SENT A PROPHET. IT'S THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. I'M GOING IN THE RAPTURE. HALLELUJAH. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE SETTING OUT AND AND YOU'RE WANTING TO TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT AND SAY THE RIGHT THINGS AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE REBUKED. &gt;&gt; OH, OUCH. GET BEHIND ME, SATAN. IF YOU HAD THE HOLY GHOST, YOU WOULD NEVER DO A THING LIKE THAT. YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER ACTED LIKE THAT. AND AND and oh my, ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU KNOW, YOU YOU FAILED AGAIN AND YOU MET YOU'RE BACK IN THE PIG PIN. &gt;&gt; I tell you what, now all of a sudden, Peter in this moment, &gt;&gt; he's no longer on THE MOUNTAINTOP. HE'S HE'S REBUKED. HE he he he's low down and did he did he just say Satan? And I don't know about YOU, BUT I I TRY TO PUT MYSELF in this situation. &gt;&gt; This was an open rebuke. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And Peter, maybe he was I don't know, BUT PETER MIGHT, LIKE I SAID, HE PROBABLY WAS FEELING PRETTY GOOD about himself. You know, &gt;&gt; I got it right. Hallelujah. I got the revelation OF THE HOUR. AND SOMEHOW HE GOT TO A PLACE WHERE HE WOULD ACTUALLY REBUKE the Lord. HERE THE LORD'S TELLING YOU, HEY, THIS IS WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, I'LL JUST LAY THIS IN THERE, THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US A FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY. GOD HAS GIVEN US A PASTOR. AND IT'S TO LEAD, it's to guide, IT'S I IT'S IT'S BY THE UNCCTION OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL IF YOU SIT ON THE WORD OF God &gt;&gt; and you think you got a way and you GOT THIS OR THAT, YOU YOU'LL FIND OUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN ONE MOMENT YOU'RE GOING TO BE FEELING PRETTY GOOD IN THE NEXT MOMENT YOU'RE GOING TO BE REBUKED. I CAN TELL YOU MANY times I I you know growing up and and and and uh you know hear hearing the word come forth and and and you know and a BROTHER A BROTHER WOULD SAY SOMETHING AND YOU KIND OF GO LIKE I REMEMBER WITH MY brother Aaron you know he'd be PREACHING AND HE WOULD SAY SOMETHING AND I learned just WAIT CUZ I GUARANTEE HE GOING TO BACK IT UP WITH a quote. He's g right. AND EVERY TIME I maybe hear something, I'd be like, "Huh?" And then lay it right in there, quote, scripture, quote, word, and I'm like, "Okay, THERE IT IS." YOU KNOW, IF YOU IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, IF YOU SIT, YOU TRY TO SIT BACK LIKE WE GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT. I WAS HAVING SOME FELLOWSHIP WITH WITH OUR PASTOR HERE, I BELIEVE LAST NIGHT WITH brother David and and and and BROTHER UH DAVID WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW uh uh uh uh well, now I'm talking about my dad. So, Pastor Brother David Dad and uh he SAID, "YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE THEY'RE THEY'RE listening when they listen to the word, they're listening for you to vindicate what they know." &gt;&gt; He he called them vindicators. So then everything that you say AND YOU DO IS JUST GOING TO VINDICATE THEM and what they already know. Just like one time, I BELIEVE MY DAD, I I BELIEVE IT WAS MY DAD, HE WAS WITNESSING TO SOMEBODY AND HE STARTED TO TELL HIM ABOUT MALACHI 4:5 AND LUKE 17:30 AND HE AND HE AND HE WAS LAYING OUT ALL THE SCRIPTURES AND ALL THE GUY SAID, "GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH." AND MAYBE MY DAD AND THEY'RE SAYING, "MY GOODNESS, HE'S REALLY CATCHY." HE GOES, "I'VE NEVER HEARD A BETTER DESCRIPTION OF MY MINISTRY IN ALL OF MY LIFE." a vindicator. BUT I SAY WE OUGHT TO COME TO CHURCH in the moment. Living in the moment, Lord, speak to me. This is a house of correction, LORD. LORD, MAYBE I DON'T SEE EYE TO EYE WITH THE BROTHER, LORD, BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT HE IS A BROTHER IN CHRIST. I DO BELIEVE THERE'S a gift there. AND AND LORD, MAY I LOOK PAST THE VEIL THIS MORNING, LORD, MAY YOU SPEAK TO ME IN MY LIFE AND SPEAK TO ME IN MY CONDITION. I WANT TO TELL YOU, A LOT OF TIMES WE DO THE CHURCH AND WE DO OUR FAMILY A LOT OF DISSERVICE WHEN WE DON'T SUPPORT THE MINISTRY. BECAUSE LOOK EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO TO ELISHA AND ALL THEM KIDS. I BELIEVE IT WAS 40 KIDS THAT GOT WHY WERE THEY MAKING FUN OF ELISHA? I WONDER IF IT DIDN'T START IN THE HOME. &gt;&gt; I wonder if them kids weren't MAKING FUN OF ELISHA BECAUSE OF THEIR PARENTS. AND A LOT OF TIMES THE THINGS WE TALK ABOUT IN OUR HOME, &gt;&gt; you better BE CAREFUL. THIS THIS JUST HAPPENED UH RECENTLY. UH SOMETHING WAS BEING SAID IN FRONT OF MY daughters that that that would would would WOULD BREAK the the uh uh um what what's that? The influence of a ministry for them. I WE GOT TO BE CAREFUL. WE MIGHT NOT SEE EYE TO EYE WITH EVERYBODY, BUT I SAY THERE OUGHT TO BE SUCH A BROTHERLY LOVE THAT THAT WE GOT TO GET OVER OUR LABELS AND GET OVER uh being vindicators and well, THEY DON'T DO IT THE WAY WE WE DO THINGS. SO, SO YOU KNOW WHAT? WE JUST WON'T HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH THEM. SHAME ON YOU. THAT'S A REBUKE IN THE NAME OF THE LORD. THANK YOU, LORD. &gt;&gt; WE SHOULD BE WE WE SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH BACKBONE AND HOLY GHOST ABOUT US TO BE ABLE TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER AND AND QUIT LABELING EVERYBODY AND LABELING THEM THIS AND LABELING THEM THAT. AND THEN NOWADAYS, YOU KNOW WHAT? I TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. I WENT ON A TRIP HERE RECENTLY ON BUSINESS AND AND UH YOU KNOW, they gave me an electric car and I told them I didn't want an electric car. if you are if you get anything out of this service, IF YOU EVER TRAVEL AND THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A RENTAL CAR, DON'T LET IT be electric. And one brother in the back says, "Amen." AND GUESS WHAT? HE GUARANTEED ME. You you you will get 250 miles. And I said, "Well, you know, I really, you know, sir, I want a gas car." But and the only reason I was dealing with dollars because Avis the only thing they had for me was a 15 passenger van. So if YOU GET ANY REVELATION out of the service, IF YOU GOT A CHOICE BETWEEN A 15 PASSENGER VAN or a little electric sedan, take the 15 passenger gas vehicle. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Take the name of Jesus with you. We've had a successful service. &gt;&gt; BUT SURE ENOUGH, he gave me the guarantee. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I'M LIKE, WELL, WELL, I'm only going 70 miles. OH, YOU'LL GET 250 MI. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? You don't even have to put gas in that thing. If you if you return this thing with 10% battery, you don't have to charge it. Well, what do you got gas? LIKE, WELL, WE'RE PRETTY MUCH OUT of everything. And then the other stuff we have is a big upgrade. All right. All right. I'm in Ohio. It's cold electric vehicle. So, I do a little research and Okay, fine. I'll take the electric vehicle. And I tell you, I get in this electric vehicle and starting it, you don't know if it's started or not. You don't know where to start it. You don't know where you're hitting the button. And you start driving that you don't know if you're dragging somebody under their car or if that's what an electric vehicle sounds like. So, it's two degrees outside and you're jumping out and you're looking under the car and YOU'RE TRYING WHAT IS THAT? I GUESS THAT'S WHAT ELECTRICAL VEHICLES DO. SO, I FINALLY LIKE, WELL, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO GO BACK IN, BUT IT'S 12:30 at night and I'm like, I got class in the morning at 8:00 AND I MIGHT AS WELL JUST GET ON THE ROAD. I GOT A GUARANTEE. &gt;&gt; SO, I GET ON THE ROAD AND I'M DRIVING AND AND AND YOU know what? That thing didn't have 100% battery when I started. Had 80%. But I doing the math, 80%. If I got back, I should be fine. It's saying right there, well, I got, you know what? you know, I mean, it doesn't say I got 250 mi, but it says I got about a 180 mi, 170 mi, and and I'm thinking, well, I'm 70 80 miles there, and you know, at least I can charge somewhere in in the meantime, but I GOT A GUARANTEE. AND I GET ON THAT ROAD AND I'M DRIVING, and I tell you what, they they when THEY FACTORED THEIR 250 MPH, THEY DIDN'T TELL ME THAT'S IN PRIME CONDITIONS GOING downhill with a breeze. AND I'M WATCHING 180, 160. I'M NOT EVEN TO MY destination and I GOT 40 MILES LEFT. AND I'M PULLING IN. WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE FOR A MINUTE. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GOT here and how we're going to get out of here, but we'll we'll GET THERE. AND SO I I'M I'M PULLING UP AND I'M LIKE, "OKAY, NOW IT'S 12:30, 1:00 AT NIGHT. LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS TRY TO CHARGE A battery in the morning to get to my class. I don't want to be stranded out in Ohio. It's 5 degrees out here." So I pull up to his ch charging port. I find a charging port. I drive five minutes. I drive 5 miles or 5 minutes. I find this charging port. It's freezing cold. I plug that thing in and I'm watching it and I'm like, it sure doesn't seem like it's doing anything. Maybe I need to turn it off and sit here and freeze. So, I charge this thing for 40 minutes and I'm like, I'm done. It's 1:00, 1:30. I got to class. At least if anything, I can get to the class in the morning. And I start to drive back and I realized I accomplished one thing. I got enough charge to cover the five miles it took me to get back to the hotel. I was right back where I started with an hour less time. And when I plugged that thing in, it said, "Your car will be fully charged at 11:30 a.m. Look, I can't sleep in my car. I got to go to class." But I TELL YOU WHAT, THAT'LL HAPPEN. THAT'LL THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN IN IN GUARANTEES. &gt;&gt; You know, it did not work out the way that I wanted it to work out. All right. &gt;&gt; So, however we got here, if anybody doesn't know, just don't get an an electric car. You want a gas car. &gt;&gt; But I tell you what, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PETER ONE TIME ON THE MOUNTAINTOP. HE AND THE NEXT MOMENT HE he he's in the gutter and and uh you know, SOMETIMES I I WE WERE TALKING ABOUT, you know, uh uh uh you don't want to make FUN OF OF MINISTRY. YOU could be in a place TO WHERE UH YOUR YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER MIGHT BE IN A PLACE WHERE THEY NEED DELIVERANCE. And if you've been discouraging OR LABELING, YOU BETTER FIND OUT YOU MIGHT HAVE AFFECTED THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THE MINISTRY. I say IT'S WE AS PARENTS, WE SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL IN HOW WE TALK ABOUT one another &gt;&gt; because then we get attitudes and WE GET COMPLEXES. AND AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S EXACTLY UH uh uh what Revelations 3:19 SAID. IT SAYS, "AS MANY AS I LOVE, I REBUKE AND CHASEN. BE ZEALOUS, THEREFORE, and repent." Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're wrong, what should you do? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Repent. &gt;&gt; Brother Brad, I'M EVEN TALKING ABOUT THAT'S WHAT THE WORD SAYS. IT SAYS, "BE ZEALOUS." THEREFORE, HE SAID GOD IS CALLING for another zeal. And what is that zeal to say? I'm wrong. &gt;&gt; And and when I'm talking about living in the moment, if I can say IT LIKE THIS, OKAY, I'VE MADE A DECISION. I've had an attitude. I've done SOMETHING THAT WAS WRONG. IN THAT MOMENT, I've done something or now I've BEEN MADE AWARE OF SOMETHING THAT I GOT TO repent for. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do in the moment? Now, &gt;&gt; NOW YOU HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT. NOW, YOU CAN JUST SAY, "LORD, I'M SORRY. LORD, FORGIVE ME. BE ZEALOUS. THEREFORE, REPENT." YOU KNOW, SAY I'M WRONG. MAKE IT RIGHT. BROTHER BRANDHAM said in the church book, HE SAID HE KNOWS HOW TO ENCOURAGE US IN THE RIGHT MATTERS AND discourage us in the wrong matters. He said, "We can learn a lot about HOW TO RUN OUR FAMILIES AND RUN run our churches and and just to kind of work work towards a close." Peter was always getting himself in trouble, but he had a revelation. &gt;&gt; But he was always getting himself in trouble. But he had a revelation. &gt;&gt; But he he was always getting himself in trouble. Does that sound famili? I don't know about you, but I I feel like Peter a lot. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, you preach and uh God, you know, we have powerful meetings and and and and my and then, you know, it's like a lot of times they say, you know, you you you feel like a mouse preparing. You you feel like a lion preaching and you feel like a worm when you're done. You know, just give me my the darkest, deepest hole to crawl into and I don't want to see the sun for 10 days. You know, and it's in those times if you're not careful, you get a little amnesia. uh you know, you know, you start to feel a little bad and you start to feel this and that, you know, and and and but but we want to be zealous, therefore, and say, "I'm wrong." And Peter, you know, he's up on the mountain top, down the valley, up on the mountain, down the valley. And and but he had a revelation, and I JUST WANT TO POINT THIS out uh as we we try to move towards a close by the help of God. But the one thing that I love about Peter is he did have, who do you say that I am? And I want to tell you if if if something in your soul has been quickened that you know that that the message of the hour is the truth and that God s sent a prophet a and you know THAT THAT'S GOD'S PROVIDED way in the end time that that there is a promise for the age, right? We are we have been given great and PRECIOUS PROMISES THAT WE MIGHT BE PARTAKERS OF DIVINE NATURE. And I believe we've seen divine nature on display through a vindicated prophet WHO WAS A BROTHER JUST LIKE YOU AND I WHO HAD problems who was up on the mountain was down in the valley. HE WAS A SINNER SAVED BY GRACE. HE HE HE WAS A LIAR. He was a thief. &gt;&gt; Maybe not a thief but he was a liar. He lied right. He tried to take his own I believe I got that right. You know what I'm trying to say. But he he he but HE WAS A SINNER. WHAT WAS IT IN THAT? IN ALL OF THAT, he was called to express the divine nature of God. And in some moments, he got it wrong, but in other moments, it was a surrendering and allowing the Holy Ghost to move out into his life. And Peter, my just YOU THINK OF PETER, PETER'S up and down. Now, look at this. And I just I I just want to th you can grab your Bibles and turn with me to John 21. I just this just come to me here before we come out to the platform. And and you can think of Peter. I I if we had time you could preach uh many services on it, but think of Peter how with this revelation he denied the Lord three times. &gt;&gt; A and I think the grace of God and how uh the scripture it just it just melts it melts my heart. If you turn into John 21:17, but just think of of of Peter. I know I'm saying it over and over. Maybe that's so somebody can at least get it once. But he he has the revelation and it's this this revelation that the the gates of hell shall not prevail and whatever you bind in earth shall be bound in heaven. And now he he as as the Lord's been taken away. He you know I'll never leave you. I'll never betray you. And now you know he says before the crows three times you'll betray betray me three times. And uh could you imagine in the moment each time he he denied the Lord you know maybe he you know in that moment in the pressure that's a lot of times what happens in the moment in the pressure in the mo living in the moment he denied him living in the moment he denied him living in the moment he denied him and all a sudden the it it crows and that's when oh no &gt;&gt; I did it I I I purposed in myself how many times have you purposed in yourself. I'll never do it again. &gt;&gt; Lord, I will never look at that again. I'll never say that again. I'll never have that attitude again. &gt;&gt; How many times I'll never get upset my wife. I I'll never have a temper tantrum again. &gt;&gt; I'll never lash out her again. I'VE HEARD HER ONE TOO MANY TIMES. I'LL NEVER DO THAT AGAIN. And then you do it again and YOU COME TO YOURSELF AND IN THE MOMENT. But I say that's in that moment is when you say, "God, forgive me. Lord, I know there's a power. &gt;&gt; I know there's A HOLY GHOST. I KNOW THERE'S A DIVINE NATURE, Lord Jesus, that you can burn that temper out of me. YOU CAN BURN THAT ATTITUDE OUT OF ME. LORD, I MIGHT HAVE FALLEN THREE TIMES OR FOUR TIMES, BUT LORD JESUS, I KNOW THERE'S A NATURE that you're wanting to produce IN ME &gt;&gt; TO EXPRESS TO MY WIFE AND TO MY CHILDREN AND TO MY CO-WORKERS AND TO MY CHURCH AND TO A DYING WORLD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; LORD, MAY I LIVE IN THE MOMENT THE way you want me to live. &gt;&gt; And in John 21:17, maybe I'm catching the story just right. This is where I we'll just back up a little bit. This is a wonderful story where uh you just you just love Peter and his zeal. I believe this is a story. I didn't go back and look at it, but man, when they and I and and I love it. Uh because Well, let's just read. We'll see what happens. Everybody feeling okay? &gt;&gt; I I don't know if there's any restaurants you're going to be able to go to. So, we might as well just keep coming and dining right here. &gt;&gt; Let's just read this real quick. Everybody at home, you feeling okay? You got your second, third cup? Drink one for me. Okay, everybody will. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right, let's just see where we're at. We'll just do a little Bible reading maybe verse four. But when the morning was come, Jesus stood on the shore. But the disciples knew not that it was Jesus. Then Jesus said unto them, "Children, have ye any meat?" They answered him, "No." And he said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the ship, &gt;&gt; and you shall find." &gt;&gt; Yes. and they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw in the multitude of fishes. Therefore the disciples whom Jesus loved said unto Peter, "It is the Lord." &gt;&gt; Now when SIMON PETER HEARD THAT it was the Lord he g his fisher's coat unto him, for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea. I tell you what, that's what coming in the presence of the Lord will do to make you put on clothes. Hey, we have testimony of the prophet them blanket natives in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; And I find it strange. We say we believe the message of the outer and our clothes are just getting tighter and tighter and our heels are getting longer and longer. &gt;&gt; All right, we'll just move on. I'm not trying to go there. And the other disciples came in a little ship, for they were not a far off, but as it were 200 cubits dragging the net with fishes. And as soon then as they were come to the land, they saw a fire of coals, and the fish laid there on the bread. And Jesus said unto them, "Bring of the fish which you have now caught." Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land and of the great fishes 150 and three. And for all there was so many yet was not a net broken. Do y'all know why it was 153 fishes? &gt;&gt; I don't either. Jesus saith unto them, "Come and dine." And none of the disciples dursed. Now watch this. Jesus saith unto him, "Come and dine." And none of the di disciples dured ask him who art thou. Now why would the scripture say that? Because it was no longer by a physical appearance. &gt;&gt; What you KNOW YOU KNOW GOD AND MORPHE WHAT IS HE DOING? HE HE'S ALWAYS HE HE HE VEILS HIMSELF TO UNVEIL HIMSELF. He he he he he it's God and morphe. And now I IT'S IT'S BY DOING SOMETHING FAMILIAR. IT IT GOES TO SHOW IT WAS A REVELATION THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING BY THAT WELL HIS PHYSICAL APPEARANCE because the scripture says none of them dured asked who it was because they knew that WHAT HE DID YESTERDAY WHAT HE WAS DOING TODAY WAS PROVEN THAT IT WAS HIM. They didn't have to look at him and AND BY A PHYSICAL APPEARANCE AND SAY, "WELL, YOU LOOK LIKE THE same guy." NO, BUT HE WAS DOING THE SAME THINGS THAT HE DID BACK THERE. AND I'M SO THANKFUL BY REVELATION THAT GOD SENT A VINDICATED PROPHET AND I CAN LOOK PAST THE VEIL AND KNOW I DON'T HAVE TO wonder who it is. I KNOW THAT IT'S THE LORD JESUS CHRIST THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER VINDICATING THAT HIS WORD IS THE SAME. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, HE WANTS TO DO THE SAME THING in each one of you. HE WANTS YOU TO TAKE ON THAT DIVINE NATURE THAT WHEN PEOPLE WOULD COME IN CONTACT WITH YOU, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO GUESS WHO IT IS. THEY'D SAY LIKE I I BELIEVE THAT'S THE LORD. &gt;&gt; And Jesus cometh and taketh the bread and giveth them fish likewise. This is now the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples. After that he was risen from the dead. So when they had died, Jesus was sim dined. Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? Oh, could you imagine? I bet his heart was racing. I mean, I I tell you that. But but I say that's sometimes that's where we just got to get us to a place where you're no longer saying, "Oh, soul, I got it figured out." But you just get to a place where I've I've tried here and I've tried there. And you know, he says, he saith to him, "Yay, Lord, thou knowest I love thee." He said unto them, "Feed my lambs." He saith to him again the second time, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Remember he denied the Lord three times. And here the Lord, I believe it's no coincidence that the Lord has given him three opportunities. And he says, "Thou love me, he saith unto him, Yay, Lord, thou knowest, I love thee." He saith unto him, "Feed my sheep." And he saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jodas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, "Love thou me." He said unto him, "Lord, thou knowest all things." &gt;&gt; I believe that sometimes the place we get to serving the Lord. We don't understand why we're going through things, we don't understand the heartache, we don't understand the pain, we don't understand why things I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I let the Lord down, why I couldn't GET THE VICTORY. BUT ONE THING, LORD, I know you know I love you, &gt;&gt; Lord. WHERE WOULD I BE IF IT WASN'T FOR YOUR GRACE? WHERE WOULD I BE IF IT WASN'T FOR YOUR MERCY? &gt;&gt; He said, Lord, he said UNTO HIM, LORD, THOU KNOWEST ALL THINGS, THOU KNOWEST THAT I love thee. Jesus, Jesus saith unto him, feed my sheep. Verily, I say unto you, that when thou young, thou girdest thyself, and walkest, whether thou wouldest, but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall girth thee, and carry thee whether thou wouldest not. then spake he signifying by what that spake he's signifying by what death he should glorify God. I say that's how we glorify God is in dying daily. If you want to glorify the Lord Jesus we have to die daily that he might live out through us. And this is what I want to focus on as we move towards a close. He says and when he had spoken this he saith to him follow me. And I just that just struck my heart to think that through all of the mistakes through through the mountain tops in the valleys through denying them three times and here he coming and and giving them a three opportunities to to tell him that that he that he that he loved him. I was just thinking, you know, he he's a friend that that stickketh closer to a brother. AND WHEN YOU'VE MESSED UP AND WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMS LIKE IT'S GONE THE the wrong way, his love never changes. &gt;&gt; I want to say he's still calling. And after all of this, I thought it was so wonderful where it just it made me think of of of the very when it first all started WHEN JESUS CAME BY THE BANK AND SAID, "Follow me." And here, after all those years of maybe getting things wrong and thinking he had it all figured out here, the Lord's coming by and say, "FOLLOW ME." I WANT TO TELL YOU, I DON'T CARE HOW FAR YOU'VE GONE. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE IN a pig pin. I don't care IF YOU'RE A PRODICAL SON AND YOU STINK AND YOU'RE WRESTLING ON A CORN HUSK. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS. I BELIEVE THE MASTER IS STILL CALLING. COME AND DIE. FOLLOW ME. FOLLOW ME OUT OF THE PIG PIN. FOLLOW ME OUT OF THE SITUATION. JUST GET ON THE PATH. JUST LOOK AT THE WATER TOWER. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS. &gt;&gt; Brother Vanham said this, "And how can I overcome?" He said, "He stood one day on Mount Transfiguration." He said, "Verily, I say unto you that some of that you stand here shall not taste death until you see the kingdom come in its power." It was foreshadowed. It it it a as we've been through it mount transfiguration and the Bible said the kingdom of God is within you. So this is a kingdom people that profess that this is not their home. THIS IS NOT OUR HOME. I WANT TO SAY LOOK IN ONE MOMENT he did the wrong thing. In one moment he made a MISTAKE OF EVERYTHING. JUST LIKE EACH ONE OF US WE DID THE WRONG THING. BUT I WANT TO SAY YOU HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT. Don't give UP JUST BECAUSE YOU FAILED. DON'T GIVE UP JUST BECAUSE YOU MADE A BAD DECISION. I SAY YOU GET BACK UP BECAUSE YOU CAN. YOU GET BACK UP BECAUSE YOU'RE FORGIVEN. YOU GET BACK UP BECAUSE HE MADE A WAY FOR YOU. AND YOU GET BACK UP NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE LIVING IN THE MOMENT OF YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT. BUT YOU GET BACK UP BECAUSE GOD HAS GIVEN YOU ANOTHER MOMENT. ACCORDING TO 1 CORINTHIANS 15:51, BEHOLD, I SHOW YOU A MYSTERY. WE SHALL NOT ALL SLEEP, BUT WE SHALL BE CHANGED. FOR IN A MOMENT, IN A TWINKLING OF AN EYE, AT THE LAST TRUMP, FOR THE TRUMP SHALL SOUND, AND THE DEAD IN CHRIST SHALL shall raise incorruptible, AND WE SHALL BE CHANGED. I WANT TO TELL YOU, I'M LIVING THIS MOMENT FOR THAT MOMENT. I AM LIVING for rapture. I AM A KINGDOM PEOPLE. THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS WITHIN ME. I CAME FROM GOD AND I'M GOING BACK TO GOD. I MIGHT HAVE FAILED IN THIS MOMENT, BUT I'M GOING TO REPENT AND GET BACK UP AND SAY, "LORD, I'M SORRY BECAUSE I'M NOT LIVING FOR MY FAILURES. I'M LIVING FOR RAPTURE. I'M NOT LIVING FOR MY FLESH. I'M LIVING FOR JESUS CHRIST." AND IN ONE MOMENT WHERE I GOT IT WRONG, HIS GRACE AND MERCY IS HERE THAT I CAN GET IT RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS. THANK YOU, LORD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; LORD, help me to live in the moment. &gt;&gt; Like you want me to live. &gt;&gt; Brother Benham said his THOUGHTS IN JUST ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES. HE SAID HIS thoughts is the Christian of today. The thoughts before the foundation of the world. Now brother Brandham says this in identification. He says he came as a redeemer and to redeem anything is to bring back. &gt;&gt; Maybe 10 minute more minutes. We'll just see what the Lord has. Is that okay? We all right? &gt;&gt; You there at home, you can get up. You can stretch your legs. You can do everything you've already been doing. And for you that are here, we'll just we'll just plug a little bit longer. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; We Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. I You KNOW WHAT? I FIGURE I JUST MIGHT AS WELL uh uh deliver my burden. &gt;&gt; All right. We'll just keep pressing. Brother Brandham says this in identification. He said he came as a redeemer and to redeem any Oh, we only got one service today. Hallelujah. We always get a little more extra time when we got one service, right? &gt;&gt; All right, I'm feeling better now. He came as a redeemer and to redeem anything is to bring back. Amen. Bring it back. IT WAS GOD'S THOUGHT. You &gt;&gt; think little you, little me. &gt;&gt; No one IN THE WORLD COULD TAKE MY PLACE. NOBODY CAN TAKE YOURS. GOD'S GOT A PLACE FOR ME AND NOBODY CAN TAKE IT. HALLELUJAH. AS MUCH AS YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE MY PLACE, YOU DIDN'T GIVE IT TO ME. &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE IT TO ME AND IT'S MINE. AND NOT ONLY DID HE GIVE ME A PLACE HERE IN LADYIA TO MANIFEST HIS DIVINE NATURE, HE GAVE ME A PLACE IN THE RAPTURE. HE GAVE ME A PLACE AT THE MARRIAGE TABLE. I WANT TO TELL YOU, THERE'S A MARRIAGE TABLE. AND I GOT A RESERVATION. &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad my reservation ain't like man's reservation. We make a reservation and WHEN THE SNOW DAY COMES OR WE ALL GET ICED OUT, WE CAN'T MAKE IT CUZ THE FLIGHT COULDN'T GET OUT. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH ICE, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH FIRE, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH CONDEMN CONDEMNATION, IT DON'T MATTER HOW MANY ARROWS THE DEVIL TRIES TO SHOOT MY WAY. I GOT A PLACE. I got a revelation and I'm going to be there. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I GOT A PLACE. WHERE ARE WE AT? &gt;&gt; Nobody can take your place. You being a CHRISTIAN AND FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT, GOD AND BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD SEEN YOU AND KNOWED EVERY feature that you got. &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS COME TO BRING YOU BACK. That's what Jesus was here for. The redeemer. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE HUMAN BODY TO BRING YOU BACK. THAT HAD TO COME TO BE A HUMAN AS A REDEEMER TO DISPLAY HIS ATTRIBUTES AS SAVIOR COME TO REDEEM YOU AND BRING YOU BACK FROM WHERE YOU WERE FROM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; When you receive eternal life, there's only one FORM OF ETERNAL LIFE. THAT'S GREEK word Zoe. Is that right? &gt;&gt; ZOEY, GOD'S own life. So you &gt;&gt; being a son, YOU BECOME PART OF THAT LIFE. SO THE LIFE THAT'S IN YOU NEVER DID begin and it never can end. &gt;&gt; Think of it. It can't end because anything that's eternal never began. OH, DON'T &gt;&gt; DON'T LET THAT BE SOME IDEA. &gt;&gt; GOD, quicken that. THAT'S A REVELATION THAT YOU ARE ETERNAL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, THAT'S WHY THE GATES OF HELL CAN'T PREVAIL OVER YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE PART OF GOD. YOU'RE A PART OF THE REVEL. YOU ARE THE REVELATION IN THE END TIME. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S GOD. FOR YOU WAS IN THE THOUGHTS FROM THE ETERNAL AND NOW IT'S expressed here. in a human being for his glory. Jesus came to redeem THAT BEING THE SON, the fullness of God had to come and and become that. THE SINLESS CHARACTER OF GOD DID THAT THAT HE MIGHT REDEEM THESE OTHER THOUGHTS THAT WAS to come to him to make a wife. &gt;&gt; So, as we just take a little time here towards the end, forgive me. I I I just I want to lay this in there. What kind of character then you know we rejoice in that you know uh uh we she is him and and and all the things but WHAT KIND OF CHARACTER WHAT KIND OF NATURE WHAT KIND OF HUMILITY WHAT WHAT WHAT KIND OF ACTION WHAT KIND OF CHARACTER IT IT'S HIS life right she is him that it's GOING TO BE HIS LIFE HIS DEMEANOR HIS CHARACTER HIS ATTITUDE &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; living out IF I COULD SAY IT LIKE THIS AGAIN LIVING IN THE MOMENT LOOK AS HE EXPRESSES OURSELF IN OUR VESSELS. WE DON'T ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT. BUT THERE'S A PREDESTINATED SEED IN THE HOLY GHOST RIGHT INSIDE THAT CATCHES THAT. IT SAYS NOW IN THAT MOMENT I GOT IT WRONG, BUT NOW let's make it right. &gt;&gt; And that's what Jesus said in in Matthew 7:20. He said, "Whereby their fruits you shall know them." Now I'm going to move through these quotes quickly. In the hidden life, Brother Brandon says this. And the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness, gentleness, patience, meekness, temperance. fruits of the spirit. God knows today um what the holiest people need and also the Calvinists all of them needs today is more fruit of the spirit. &gt;&gt; More lives to prove it. We've had many testimonies but as the old saying is your life speaks so loud I can't hear your voice. &gt;&gt; We are written epistles of God read of all men. Brother Von made a statement as I was listening and looking into hidden life. He says, "Too many of us are playing in the courts." &gt;&gt; Yeah. We we we come and, you know, we're in the outer courts, we're in the inner courts. But I say there ought to BE A DEEP DESIRE TO GO in &gt;&gt; in into behind the veil and have a hidden life with Jesus Christ where where you speak to God and God speaks back. &gt;&gt; Where where when the curtain comes down, it blocks out all the noise. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All all the distractions and everything THAT'S TRYING TO TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE PROMISED word of the hour. You get in there and it drops behind you and it's soundproof. That's right. It's just you and God alone. It's a hidden life and and and and um just the scripture says give all diligence to add to your faith. So it's a constant growing and unfolding into the capstone of love and in the per in the in the statue of a perfect man. He says so when you surrender your complete being then the Holy Spirit just pours through you in these virtues. Then you're a living tabernacle. Then the people look out and say, "That's a man full of virtue, knowledge. He believes the word, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, full of the love of Is it is it amazing how now, brother Brandham, he has to lay it in many times, you know, uh, these signs shall follow them that believe." And that's one of the things that we know because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. But also look how he comes around here now to the character and he's shown these are the things. SO IT'S NOT BECAUSE MANY WILL SAY TO me on that day, "Have we not prophesied my name and casted out devils and done all these marvelous things?" He'll say, "Depart from me, you workers of iniquity. I never knew you." What is that? Knowing what to do and not doing it. &gt;&gt; And one thing we know that we have to have with the Holy SPIRIT IS WE HAVE TO HAVE VIRTUE, KNOWLEDGE, TEMPERANCE, PATIENCE, GODLINESS, brotherly kindness, full of love of the Holy Ghost. See, there he is walking around. What is it? a stature that unbelievers can look at and say, "There's a Christian. There is a man or a woman who knows what they're talking about. You've never seen a kinder, sweeter, godlier person. &gt;&gt; You're sealed. A SEAL SHOWS ON BOTH SIDES. &gt;&gt; NOW, this will preach." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of us might be able to show on one side. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But he SAYS WHETHER YOU'RE GOING OR COMING, you see the seal just the same. There you are. Oh, it it's a lot. It's easy to show brotherly love and brotherly kindness. Brother Cosman, come on over to my house for dinner. Come on over. We have our little fellowship and our kids get along and everybody gets along and oh but but wait till the uh uh uh you feel like your kid got PICKED ON OR YOUR FRIEND GOT uh uh left out or or or this family didn't invite you over and and and you know your heart feels broke and you're not in FELLOWSHIP WITH THIS PERSON AND THAT person and and and OH YEAH, YOU YOU TH THOSE THINGS CAN CAUSE DEEP wounds &gt;&gt; because YOU KNOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THOSE OF THE HOUSEHOLD OF FAITH THAT WE WE SHOW THE MOST LOVE TO. BUT IT'S THOSE OF THE HOUSEHOLD OF FAITH THAT CAUSE US THE BIGGEST HURT. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; But it it's in those moments where where it's one thing to show the seal of God coming, but what about going? WHAT ABOUT ON THE OTHER SIDE WHEN IT'S WHEN IT HURTS and when it's it's nasty and it and things ain't right? I say that there's THE TIE. WE WE GOT TO SHOW THE HOLY GHOST. WHETHER WE'RE ON THE MOUNTAINTOP OR WHETHER we're in THE VALLEY, I TELL YOU WHETHER YOU GOT THE REVELATION AND YOU'RE RUNNING THE AISLES OF THE CHURCH AND YOU'VE HAD A WONDERFUL SERVICE, BUT I WONDER ABOUT WHEN YOU GET BACK TO WORK ON MONDAY AND AND YOU'RE BACK THERE WITH THE HOME AND AND THE HOME IS A WRECK AND AND EVERYTHING IS ISN'T GOING THE WAY IT SHOULD BE AND THERE'S AN ATTITUDE IN THE HOME AND AND YOU SNAP OFF AT YOUR WIFE. COME ON, BROTHERS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE TIME TO SHOW THE TOKEN. THAT'S THE TIME TO SHOW THE HOLY GHOST. YES. &gt;&gt; TAKE YOUR LITTLE SWEET WIFE WHO'S BEEN SLAVING AWAY FOR YOU AT HOME AND AND YOU THINK THAT YOU'VE DONE YOUR WORK FOR THE DAY. NO. WHY? WHY DON'T YOU COME HOME AND SHOW THAT SEAL BOTH COMING AND GOING? &gt;&gt; It's just the same. There you are. See, when a man or a woman possesses this, then the capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God, which is the Holy Ghost. Then the word coming from here manifests itself. Each one of these being see and it makes this complete being a tabernacle of the living God. a walking living example of Christianity. Is that your heart's DESIRE TODAY? WHAT CHRIST WAS, these people are because his life is in here. They are in Christ and their life is dead and hid in Christ through God and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Look, his character has never changed. What what what what what it does what it did in him, it does in us. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. It's I even what it did in the disciples, it does in us. What the Holy Ghost did in them, it does in you. And I say, what about the moment in the hour that that we're now living in? We we could go through how John 14 SAYS, "YEAH, A LITTLE while and the world seeth me no more, but ye see me because I live, ye live also." Oh. Oh, what an hour that we are now living in that this capstone revelation takes on flesh in you. And it's not, oh wow, uh uh uh something off over the rainbows. No, it's a hidden life of God expressing himself in you. So we come back to our text so we can bring this to a close. In Luke 5:17, it says, "And when he came to himself, he was always a son. He was in his father's house. And you know, he thought he could take some revelation out on his own and he thought maybe he could go make a way for himself. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; You know, and he found out that he got into a hard time and and he got into a place of spiritual amnesia. And brother Benham says this in spiritual amnesia. He says, "Now this amnesia, we're told it because it caused you to be to a place where you cannot identify yourself." Now, it's an unusual thing. It don't happen too often, but the cause from shock is something. Remember we talked about the soldier boy, right? It's somebody that don't even know who they are. You find it from wars and sometimes soldiers get it. And I just want to say that church splits will cause it. Family situations and trauma, sudden loss. I I I've seen good men have a a a tragic loss in their family or or good good my I mean you you feel LIKE YOU COULDN'T PUT NOTHING ON THEIR LIFE AND AND JUST a powerful MAN OF GOD AND SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THEIR marriage and all of a sudden they no they no longer are even a shell of themselves. They they there is no longer any identity in their life that they're even a believer. THAT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED, SOME WAR, SOME TRAUMA, SOME SHOCK HAS TOTALLY ROBBED THEM FROM THEIR IDENTIFICATION OF WHO THEY ARE. THEY GOT SPIRITUAL AMNESIA. AND I PRAY that one day, &gt;&gt; the spiritual amnesia will break, there's some good men that I LOVE &gt;&gt; THAT THEY'VE WALKED AWAY. NOW, SOME PEOPLE, I TELL YOU THIS, THEY WHEN THEY TAKE ON AN antichrist spirit and try to tear down the message, well, that's a bad place to be. We have scripture for that. Uh, I mean, uh, that's bad. But some people the the the the losing a loved one OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY WALK AWAY, I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT ANYMORE. And and they go out in the world and sin. What is it? It's spiritual amnesia. And and I just want to say that look, WE WE ARE NOT ABSOLVED from that. &gt;&gt; Some some of us, WE GO THROUGH HARD THINGS. I SAY SHAKE OURSELVES. I'M GOING TO DELIVER MY BURDEN. I'M RIGHT TO WHERE I WANT to be. AND MAYBE IF YOU CAN TUNE IN FOR A LITTLE BIT OR COME BACK AND CATCH IT a little later, MAYBE WE JUST SHAKE OURSELVES FOR A MOMENT. I I'VE WORKED TO THIS POINT. AND I'VE BEEN TRYING TO LABOR TO THIS POINT UH TWO SERVICES NOW. SO BY GOD'S GRACE, WE'LL JUST DELIVER IT. AND AND AND SO I AND THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN ON MY HEART IS AS I LOOK AT WHAT THIS MESSAGE CAME TO PRODUCE AND AND I feel like I DON'T EVEN FIT INTO THE MESSAGE ANYMORE. PEOPLE LISTEN TO THINGS THEY SHOULDN'T LISTEN TO AND DRESS THE WAY THEY SHOULDN'T DRESS AND I WONDER IF WE AIN'T GOT A BAD CASE OF AMNESIA. &gt;&gt; WHAT CAUSES IT? CHURCH SPLIT, SITUATION, TRAUMA, SUDDEN LOSS. HE SAYS SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET IT. ANOTHER THING THAT CAUSES IT IS WORRY. He said worry will cause it. HE SAID WORRY HAS NO VIRTUE AT ALL. HE HE SAID JUST SKIP WORRY AND ACCEPT FAITH. YOU KNOW THE THE WORRY it you know what it means? It means to afflict with mental distress or agitation to make anxious. Now I believe this is for somebody. I believe somebody is within shooting distance whether you're sitting in this building or you're out on the airways. Worry, listen to this. Worry is to harass by tearing. I I'm sure it's another definition of worry out in nature or something like that, but it makes a real good spiritual type. It says to harass by tearing, biting, or snapping, especially at the throat. Worry is an a vicious attack on your spiritual life. Worry is an a vicious attack &gt;&gt; to keep you from functioning like a child of God. WORRY WILL CAUSE YOU TO FORGET WHO YOU ARE. WORRY WILL START YOU TO WORRY THAT YOUR SON WILL NEVER BE SAVED. WORRY WILL CAUSE YOU TO START TO DOUBT IF THEY'VE CROSSED the line. Worry will start to get YOU TO MOVE OFF THE PROMISE THAT YOU'VE BEEN STANDING ON. GOD, YOU GIVE THEM TO ME. And there ain't no devil in hell that can take them. &gt;&gt; But all of a sudden, YOU KNOW, IT'S NATURAL TO WORRY. MOTHERS WORRY, PASTORS WORRY. BUT WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WORRY DON'T COME IN IN A WAY WHERE IT STARTS TO CAUSE THEM AMNESIA TO WHERE IT'S JUST CONSTANTLY NIPPING AT YOU AND MAKING YOU WELL MAYBE I WON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS OR MAYBE THEY FEEL YOU KNOW YOU KNOW SATAN COULD GET INTO YOU AND JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY DIDN'T SHAKE YOUR HAND OR OR SOMEBODY DIDN'T INVITE YOU OVER OR FROM SOME SITUATION YOU GOT LEFT OUT AND IT WAS TOTALLY INNOCENT AND YOU DIDN'T GET INVITED TO THE BABY SHOWER AND NOW YOU'RE STARTING TO WORRY THAT you said SOMETHING AND DID SOMETHING YOU SHOULDN'T DO AND NOW IT'S nipping at your NECK AND IT'S NAGGING AT YOU AND YOU'RE STARTING TO NOT FEEL LIKE YOU FIT IN THAT CHURCH. YOU'RE STARTING TO LEAVE EARLY. YOU SEE PEOPLE IN THE PARKING LOT AND YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU WANT TO GO JOIN THEM. YOU'RE STARTING TO GET A LITTLE WORRY AND YOU START TO QUESTION, WELL, MAYBE I DON'T EVEN FIT IN HERE ANYMORE. MAY MAYBE GOD'S DEALING WITH ME TO MOVE AND GO TO ANOTHER CHURCH AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE ALL WORRIED AND YOU START TO LOSE YOUR IDENTITY THAT YOU BELONG TO THE FAMILY. &gt;&gt; HELP ME PREACH A little this morning. &gt;&gt; Worry will get you to a place that you have amnesia. But the PROPHET OF GOD SAID THIS. He said, "You must be identified somewhere. You must show your life shows tonight where you are identified. You are identified either in Christ or out of Christ. You are not a halfway. There is no such thing as a drunk sober man." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no black white bird. You're either saved or you're not saved. &gt;&gt; Come on, help me out a little bit. You are A SAINT. YOU ARE A saint or a sinner. one or the other. AND YOUR SPIRITUAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS GOD'S WORD IDENTIFIES you exactly where you're standing. Well, even when that prodal son came to himself, it didn't so matter where he was physically standing. But in his heart, he knew who he was. So in that moment, all he HAD TO DO IS START WALKING. I'm a son of God. I'm a daughter of God. I I in this moment, I choose to to go back to my inheritance. I CHOOSE TO GO BACK TO WHERE I came from. And there ain't no devil. There ain't NO SICKNESS. THERE AIN'T NOTHING THAT CAN STOP ME. WHY? BECAUSE I AM A SON OF GOD AND I AM HEIR TO ALL THINGS. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I like how the prophet OF GOD SAYS, "LET'S JUST SKIP WORRY." &gt;&gt; Can Can I Can I get a witness THIS MORNING? LET'S JUST SKIP WORRY AND ACCEPT FAITH. YOU OUT THERE ON THE AIRWAYS, LET'S JUST SKIP WORRY. YOU'VE BEEN WORRYING A WHOLE LOT, BUT I'M HERE TO TELL THAT OLD SPIRIT OF WORRY, DEVIL, THAT OLD SPIRIT OF ANXIETY, I AIN'T GONNA WORRY NO MORE. I'M JUST GONNA SKIP WORRY AND ACCEPT FAITH. CAN YOU SEE THE WATER TOWER THIS MORNING? I WANT TO TELL YOU, IT'S CALLING YOU. I SAY STAY ON THE PATH. DON'T STOP. IT'S CALLING YOU. IT'S LEADING YOU. IT'S DRAWING YOU. &gt;&gt; FIRST JOHN 5:4 SAYS, "FOR WHATSOEVER IS BORN OF GOD OVERCOMETH THE WORLD." Don't worry, I'm not going to preach all afternoon. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. FIRST JOHN 5:4, FOR WHATSOEVER IS BORN OF GOD OVERCOMETH THE WORLD, AND this is the victory that overcomemeth the world, &gt;&gt; even our good attendance &gt;&gt; because we made it out on a snow day. &gt;&gt; Hey, don't let the devil condemn you because you didn't show up this morning. &gt;&gt; He'll do it. Now, if you get convicted, that's a different thing. But right, don't get it confused. DON'T DON'T CONFUSE CONDEMNATION with conviction because the devil, he'll take the most simplest things. Oh, I should have been there. And get you to start worrying. NO, WE'RE GOING TO SKIP THAT, RIGHT? WE'RE GOING TO ACCEPT FAITH BECAUSE FAITH IS THE VICTORY THAT WHAT OVERCOMETH the world, even our faith. So, just laying this in. We're on the home stretch here. So, everybody ramp up your engines. We're going to make this last round. Are we okay? &gt;&gt; Spiritual amnesia. HE SAYS, "YOU'VE GOT TO BE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. YOU'VE GOT TO BE BORN OF GOD. AND GOD IS THE WORD. AND WHEN I BECOME PART OF MY FATHER, I BECOME ALL MY FATHER. WHEN YOU BECOME PART OF GOD, YOU BECOME GOD IN FULL. &gt;&gt; GLORY. Take that, oh, you dumb old devil. IN ONE MOMENT, I MESSED IT ALL UP. BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT, HE'S CALLING ME HIS SON. HE'S TELLING ME I'M GOING TO MAKE IT. HE'S TELLING ME YOU'RE GOING IN A RAPTURE. AND I CHOOSE TO SKIP THE WORRY. I CHOOSE TO I CHOOSE TO SKIP THE CONDEMNATION. I AM GOING IN A RAPTURE. WHY? BECAUSE WHEN I BECOME PART OF MY FATHER, I BECOME ALL MY BOO DEVIL. STEP BACK. WHEN YOU BECOME PART OF GOD, YOU BECOME GOD IN FULL. HIS WHOLE WORD. YOU BELIEVE ALL OF IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELU. I'm feeling pretty good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WOO. WHAT A PROMISE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; But he says this spiritual amnesia. What if you didn't know your name or what it was &gt;&gt; and you couldn't identify yourself? You couldn't claim your inheritance. &gt;&gt; You didn't even know it was there for you. That's what our our pastor when he was preaching uh unused promises, he mentioned that story about my coworker. You remember there there was an inheritance for them, BUT SOMEHOW that inheritance was unknown and somebody tried to lay claim to that inheritance. WHAT WAS AMAZING IS MY COWORKER RAPHAEL, HE FOUND $500,000 cash and he gave it to HIS BOSS. WELL, HIS BOSS SAID, "FINDERS KEEPERS." WELL, he started notice noticing the money bands in the truck that he was cleaning for his boss. And uh he he HE THOUGHT THAT RIGHT. SO, he went and told the homeowners. And the homeowner said, "Hey, I HEARD Y'ALL FOUND $500,000 IN MY HOUSE." And he was like, "Well, finders keepers." IT WAS MY HOUSE. I BOUGHT THIS HOUSE AND AND WHEN I SIGNED the contract, it said asis. So, then they sued the they went to lawsuit. Well, then the people who sold the house found out that in the house that they sold was $500,000. &gt;&gt; So they said, "You know what? That was our house and that's our money." So it all went to the court. But you know what the court ruled? HE SAID THE THEY SAID THE MONEY WAS TECHNICALLY MISLAID, not abandoned. So it rightfully belonged to the original heir. I SAY THERE IS A PROMISE AND THERE is inheritance. THERE'S THINGS THAT WE THAT GOD HAS LAID UP FOR US THAT WE WE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IT'S AVAILABLE. AND NOW GOD HAS SENT A MESSAGE AND HE'S STARTING TO DO THE READING OF THE WILL. AS WE HEARD BROTHER COSMAN SAY ON SUNDAY, THERE'S BEEN THE READING of the will. WHAT IS GOD WANTING TO DO? HE'S WANTING TO SHOW YOU YOUR INHERITANCE. &gt;&gt; He's wanting to SHOW YOU YOUR PROMISES. WE HAVE UNUSED PROMISES. I SAY, LET'S NOT FORGET WHAT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR CAME TO PRODUCE. &gt;&gt; The character &gt;&gt; and the nature of Christ in the individual. Brother Brandon said, "If the word is in you, you and the word are the same." &gt;&gt; All the word is, you are. This is out of spiritual amnesia still. Amen. If I'm living in this generation, if the musicians would come, what this portion of the word has promised for FOR THIS GENERATION, I'VE GOT TO BE THAT. If I'm going to BE A CHRISTIAN, I'VE GOT TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH ALL THAT THE BIBLE PREACHES AND stands for. &gt;&gt; Look, this message is, what is IT DOING? IT'S TO TAKE AWAY THE AMNESIA. It's to REVEAL YOUR IDENTITY TO PRODUCE A CHRISTLIKE CHARACTER, A HIDDEN LIFE. WHAT THE WORD HAD PROMISED FOR THIS GENERATION. I GOT TO BE THAT. &gt;&gt; ALL THE word is you are. AND I BELIEVE WE SEEN THE WORD. THE FULLNESS THAT THE WORD came to PRODUCE IN A SHEATHWAVE LIFE THROUGH A VINDICATED PROPHET WAS TESTIFYING OF ALL THE WHEAT SEED COMING UP IN THE FIELD. MAMA, THAT'S ME. I AM CALLED TO BE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. THIS IS BRIDE TIME. THIS IS SEA TIME. THIS IS EAGLE HOUR. THIS IS THE BRIDE AGE. THIS IS ADOPTION TIME. THIS IS GOING OVER INTO CANAAN TO POSSESS THE WHOLE LAND. THIS IS THE AGE OF THE OVERCOMER. GIVE ME MY MOUNTAIN. WE ARE WELL MORE ABLE TO DO IT. LET'S GO OUT. COME ON, CHURCH. LET'S GO OVER AT ONCE. GIVE ME MY MOUNTAIN. HALLELUJAH. I AM GOING IN A RAPTURE. BUT BEFORE I GO, I'M GOING TO TAKE AS MANY AS I CAN WITH ME. I'M GOING TO EXPRESS THE DIVINE NATURE OF ALMIGHTY GOD TO EVERYBODY I CAN LIVING IN THE MOMENT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Prophet of God would say this. Just thinking of adoption now as it'll be our last quote maybe, but we're closing quickly. Forgive me. Brother Brandham says this in adoption. says, "NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT babies anymore. Now that you're not desiring the sinc milk milk of the gospel, right, we're we're in Hebrews 6 now. &gt;&gt; You know, we're let's go on into perfection." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't need to lay down all the fun, right? WE DON'T NEED TO BE BABIES. We're not being pandered around. We don't need the sincere meal milk, right? We're ready for strong meat &gt;&gt; because strong meat belongs to what? Those who are full age. WE SHOULD BE A FULL AGE. HE SAYS, "NOW, NOW THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE BABYED ANYMORE, THAT NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT DESIRING THE SINCERE MILK OF THE GOSPEL, THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE BABYED AND PATTED AND PERSUADED TO COME TO CHURCH. NOW THAT YOU'RE really fully matured Christians, you're ready to eat strong meats now. You're ready to come into something. Hallelujah. Grant it, Lord Jesus." HE SAID, "YOU'RE READY TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING THAT'S deep and rich. OH, WE'LL GET INTO IT DIRECTLY. AND OH, IT'S been hidden since the foundation of the world." He said, "Now that you've COME INTO THIS, I'M ADDRESSING THIS TO YOU. NOT TO THOSE WHO HAVE JUST LEFT EGYPT, NOT TO THOSE WHO ARE STILL ON the journey, BUT TO THOSE WHO ARE in the promised land THAT HAS RECEIVED THE PROMISE." HOW MANY'S RECEIVED THE PROMISE OF THE HOLY GHOST? OH, AREN'T YOU GLAD THAT YOU'RE IN THE LAND OVER HERE NOW EATING THE OLD CORN? HALLELUJAH. EATING THE STRONG THINGS OF GOD AND GOT A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING. Your spiritual mind is all unmuddled UP. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHO HE IS. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE IS. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU'RE GOING. YOU KNOW EXACTLY ALL ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW IN whom you have believed AND ARE PERSUADED BECAUSE HE IS ABLE TO KEEP THAT WHICH YOU'VE COMMITTED UNTO HIM AGAINST THAT DAY. HALLELUJAH. There is a people, A BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHO HE IS. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU'RE GOING. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU CAME FROM. YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT. WHY? BECAUSE THE CAPSTONE OF GRACE HAS COME DOWN, SAYING, "GRACE, GRACE, COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE, AND BE YOU NOT A PARTAKER OF HER PLAGUES." &gt;&gt; You are not IN EGYPT. YOU ARE NOT IN THE WILDERNESS. YOU ARE IN THE PROMISED LAND. YOU ARE IN CHRIST. Let's all stand. Ephesians 1:9 says, "Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to the good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself." Hallelujah. Aren't you glad you're part of that purpose? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you're when you become your father, you become all your father? All the word is you are in this moment. I say amen. I say Lord, I want to live it in every moment. Lord, I just don't want to say amen in the church and my life, not say amen at work. Will you let God deal with your heart right now? May maybe maybe you're at home right now and you're streaming and your your marriage is all tore up. Maybe just one of you is serving the Lord and your spouse is tearing you down and making you weaker and weaker and you've gotten spiritual amnesia and you don't know who you are. Oh God, would you go to him? Lord, may they be like that prodal son and come to themsel and in the moment say, "You know what? I'm not going to worry about how I smell in the muck. I'm just going to start walking back to my father's house because I'm a son of God." You see, the prophet of God said in the breach, he said, "The seven seal holds the mysteries of the book." And until we can see what those seven seals as sealed in, we're only presuming things. So many times, saints, we're just presuming because, as I've told you this morning, upon my little message this morning of God hiding in simplicity. You see, we are sure to miss this thing unless it is absolutely genuinely revealed by the Holy Spirit and vindicated the same. Now, I want to say in one sense that's history, but in another sense that has to be personal and you're sure to miss it unless this message is genuinely revealed by the Holy Spirit to you personally and vindicated in your life. Is that your heart's desire, Lord Jesus? Lord, I just want to thank you for the opportunity, Lord, to stand in your presence, Lord. I thank you for your grace to preach your word this morning, Lord. And I thank you for the grace of the listener that would sit and pull on the word. And Lord, I believe that we can see you standing amongst us the same yesterday, today, and forever. And Lord, we want to live in every moment by allowing your Holy Spirit to live out through us. And Lord, as we just read this quote, Lord, I I want this message not to be just some idea or some covering because your prophet said, "We're sure to miss it unless it's absolutely genuinely revealed by the Holy Spirit and vindicated the same." Lord, I know part of that is history that it's already been revealed. It's already been vindicated, but that's to the age. Lord, what about to the individual, Lord? You said we could never pray for more revelation. We couldn't pray too much for revelation, Lord. I say maybe maybe collectively as a body, we could start praying for more revelation, for more love, Lord. And for as this our pastor's been ministering on unused promises and the character, Lord, that this divine nature would just be expressed more and more abundantly in us. Lord, we don't fit in like the world. We're not like the world. We're a peculiar people. We're we're odd. We're different. Lord, it just makes me think of the classes I had in Ohio that Lord, I told the instructor in front of everybody. And I said, "I'm an oddball. I'm different." Well, you I' I'd appreciate it if you you you didn't use that language. And Lord, they were respectful and I never heard I never heard one word that was off. Lord, I I believe that was pleasing to you, Lord. But we're not called to fit into the world. We're called to be different, Lord. And we're different because we're your sons and your daughters, and you've given us an ear to hear. You've given us a seed that that word would come into manifestation. Lord, I just commit the people to you now, Lord. And as we would just sing a song of worship and praise, Lord, may your word just be watered in. I pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Let's just sing this song. Help me sing it and lift them up. I have not to praise you near enough. I have nothing. Oh, I am nothing without you. Oh, and all my love for me is all your love to cover me. Brother David, if you want to come, the world will see that I have nothing. without. Let's sing that second verse. Oh, and take my voice and pour it out. Let us sing a song of mercy I found. Oh, for I am nothing. Oh, I have nothing without you. Oh, and all my soul me all the world will see that I have nothing without you. Amen. We have the capstone, the love of God shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit. That's the goal. I appreciated something that David Jr. said Wednesday night. He said, "People don't see your doctrine. They don't know you by your doctrine. They know you how you treat them. And people know if you love them or not. That's right. &gt;&gt; And that they just know it. You know, they know if you respect them or not. And they might not be conscious of it, but in their subconscious that love of God creates a atmosphere and it affects people. You can go into strange neighborhoods and strange places and if you love people and you love God and you respect them, it generates &gt;&gt; a respect. It creates an atmosphere and it takes an atmosphere for life to be born and people are are born. When they the word of God comes in the atmosphere, it it it'll it does something for people. And that's why I think that Jesus said that they'll know you are my disciples by your love that you have one for another. And I I just think that was so brilliantly spoken about, you know, they don't know you by your doctor. They don't know you, but they know you by what comes out of you. And the prophet of God says that works is faith expressed. If you believe the word of God, then you're going to live like it's the end time, you know, and it's it's just a wonderful cycle of of the love of God being shed and our hearts and eyes being opened and and and just growing in in the things of God and walking with him and that as he penetrates you and permeates you, then your cup overflows. And uh and I think that's the greatest thing that can happen in this day is that our cups overflow with the love of God to all people. And and I like if you always look in the mirror, I've always been able to look at my past and say, "If God could save me, he could save anybody." You know, if he could open my eyes, he could open the eyes of anybody. I don't need to prejudge. I don't need to to label or anything. If I would just so let my light shine amongst men that our good works would glorify the father in heaven. And if I be lifted up, I'll draw all men. Nigh and you. The simplicity of the gospel is a wonderful thing. Uh, I know this is kind of a cold season. We're only going to have one service today and it's it's uh going to be cold for a few days. Uh, Wednesday night, even if we just have to get a small streaming crew together, we'll have service Wednesday night. But if you're uh feel it's too cold to bring your family out or it's too treacherous to drive, then uh don't feel any obligation to come out to the house of the Lord and uh put on a tape and or uh uh just spend that time that Matthew spoke of getting down where you shut the doors and it's you and him alone and just spend time with him. And if we do that, we certainly will grow in the in the gospel. Uh next Sunday morning, if the Lord would grant me the strength, we want to minister out of the message the oddball. And uh so you might uh we've been talking with the brothers about that different places about the oddball. And so if you want to listen to that tape before next Sunday, um it it would be good. So it was nice to have Cosman with us today. The trouble was you came all the way to Texas and got the same weather he has in Romania. So you know if you might as well have the same weather if you have the same gospel, &gt;&gt; right? So we thank the Lord for that. So uh we will have service this Wednesday. Keep tact of your emails. We may only have one service next Sunday depending on what the trend is, but it's going to be cold. So, let your spirits be warm that people can be blessed by you. Certainly do that. Let's bow our heads as we close. Our father, we've heard today of the many things that we forget. Father, that sometimes our hearts and our minds cause us to believe that our trials and tribulations are greater than you are. or the weakness in our flesh beats us down to the place that we don't feel any longer worthy of your love. But yet in your word, you said, "Well, we were yet sinners. You loved us. You didn't love us because of what we've done. You loved us because we're your children. And even as a mother has undying love for her child, your love is even greater than that. And we thank you for that, Father. And our desire is that we as individuals are capped with that love. That that love becomes the fountain of our strength, becomes the melody in the words that we speak. It becomes the mind by which we reason that love becomes the motivation behind the things that we do. And father that you so loved us and you said it was freely given to us. You freely gave your love to us. Father may we freely give our love to others. May we look on every man's need as greater than our own. That this mind that was in Christ Jesus may be in us. Father, that we be truly representatives of the love that you have. For God is love and our Lord and Savior was an expression of that love. And many told us, he said, "The works that I do, you shall do also, cuz I'll not leave you comfortless, but I'll be with you, even in you till the end." Father, we know we're near the end, and we ask, Father, that you be with us more than ever. Bless those that have come out today that join in with us. We so appreciate it. Our musicians, Matthew bringing the word of the Lord. Our deacons that came out, Father, just here and those of you that are with us online. May you know that he loves you and that with him all things are possible. Take courage, be strong, be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed. For I, the Lord thy God, are with thee so wherever thou goest. Lord, may these great words of Joshua 1:9 be our strength for this upcoming week. Guide us through the storm. Father, give us wisdom concerning our church schedule. Father, give us wisdom concerning driving and traveling. We ask that you would grant it to us in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. Amen. There's no service this evening. Uh for those of you that are looking for your tithe and authoring receipts, they're in the library in alphabetical order in an envelope. You can be sure to take that. uh if the amounts aren't correct on it in any way, we can make adjustments for you. So, we just trust that you love the Lord. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Go in peace this morning. Amen. Crazy. Oh. Heat. Heat. Around the moon. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Oh, you
