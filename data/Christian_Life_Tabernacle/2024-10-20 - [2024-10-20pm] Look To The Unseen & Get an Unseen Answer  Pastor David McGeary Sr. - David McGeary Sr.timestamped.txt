[29:14] Sunday night I'd throw myself a birthday
[29:17] party H that way you can be sure that uh
[29:22] you're not
[29:23] forgotten no but what we I I just uh you
[29:28] know I I kind of like that scripture
[29:30] that always touched me so much is that
[29:33] the Lord would rather see you love one
[29:35] another than even himself so we just and
[29:40] and I should say it like this only those
[29:42] that are here tonight are
[29:47] invited that's the way to do it isn't it
[29:50] no but so what we'll do is we'll just
[29:53] maybe start somewhere around 4:00 and
[29:55] we'll just have a dinner barbecue
[29:58] uh some ribs and some chicken and some
[30:03] sausage and some sliced beef
[30:07] and sounds
[30:10] terrible no we we really uh would trust
[30:14] that it all come out so we we'll do that
[30:16] next Sunday and I don't need any
[30:19] shirts I don't need socks I don't need
[30:22] pants I don't need nothing in fact I
[30:25] think I'll bring stuff and you could
[30:27] take it
[30:28] out of my closet and everything so uh
[30:32] just if you if you just come and have a
[30:36] good time love one another and just
[30:39] Fellowship one to another that would be
[30:41] great and someone said well isn't that
[30:43] awful close to have barbecue for our
[30:46] meetings and I said man that's a full
[30:48] three weeks away anybody in Texas eats
[30:52] barbecue at least every other week so we
[30:54] should be fine so uh we hope yall can be
[30:58] be there and uh and certainly enjoyed
[31:01] that uh thank you all for coming out to
[31:04] um sister janette's uh um I don't know
[31:08] what you call it we would call it in my
[31:10] day awake you know basically is what it
[31:14] was but uh I was fellowship with some of
[31:17] the brothers and so you know these are
[31:21] all the people were there from Sister
[31:24] janette's life the way she grew up well
[31:26] five years ago she got ConEd converted
[31:28] to this message you know what I mean and
[31:31] so you know when we walked in then all
[31:35] of a sudden she saw all her Associates
[31:37] you know and you could see the eyeballs
[31:39] rolling brother Tim said man you walked
[31:41] in there and the eyeballs were just
[31:42] rolling you know look oh it's those kind
[31:44] of people you know all long hair and
[31:47] dresses and and everything but aren't
[31:50] you glad you're one of them amen and and
[31:55] I I just thought I I just thought that
[31:58] is just so uh wonderful that uh uh those
[32:03] you know that we were there for her and
[32:07] and so they know one life but we know
[32:10] another because that's what we have we
[32:12] have a transforming God he takes
[32:15] something that's one way and he makes it
[32:18] into something else you know the greator
[32:21] you know the great transition of God
[32:24] from one thing to something else and and
[32:27] that trans transition has a path and
[32:30] people can't understand it and you meet
[32:32] people along the way they see you in a
[32:34] certain time of your life you know and
[32:37] that's what they remember you as and
[32:39] then they'll hold that image of you in
[32:42] your mind their mind you know what I
[32:44] mean they just think this is the way
[32:46] that you are but you know we don't care
[32:51] what people think we are we want to
[32:53] become what he said that we could be and
[32:56] so that's what we're are pressing the
[32:59] mark for so uh I I could look across the
[33:02] room and see that different people had
[33:05] different times different images
[33:07] different understanding and and uh I I I
[33:12] think that the best part about it is is
[33:14] we got the final picture you know we got
[33:17] what God had in mind you know of course
[33:20] they had a picture of her when she had
[33:21] her hair cut and then she never cut her
[33:24] hair you know what I mean the day that
[33:26] she heard about this message and we
[33:28] baptized her I think this morning I said
[33:31] at 8 uh five or something but she was
[33:34] like 82 she about 5 years ago and uh she
[33:38] never looked back and she'd always say
[33:41] to me oh I wish I had have known that
[33:43] sooner I wish I had have known that
[33:45] sooner you know but I I I I like the
[33:49] 11th Hour worker remember the 11th Hour
[33:52] worker picked the same fruit that
[33:54] everybody else picked and he got the
[33:56] same wage that every other and so I'm
[34:00] happy she got in on on the labor of the
[34:03] Lord and so God richly loves you and and
[34:07] I'm I'm sure that it's a blessing I want
[34:10] to fellowship tonight I uh every now and
[34:13] then I I just like to evangelize you
[34:16] know what I mean and uh and uh you know
[34:20] being a pastor is a j o but uh uh
[34:24] evangelizing man that's piece cake you
[34:27] know so uh every now and then you just
[34:30] want to preach so I'm just going to
[34:31] preach something off the top of my head
[34:34] and but from my
[34:35] heart you know what I mean you say oh
[34:38] you can't do that way I got scripture
[34:40] for it I took no thought of what I was
[34:42] going to
[34:43] say you know what I mean and that's in
[34:46] the Bible all right so uh uh if if you
[34:51] have any questions about what I preach
[34:53] talk to Billy you know he can figure it
[34:56] out and straighten it out so
[34:58] uh we just uh we just want to enjoy the
[35:02] Lord and and uh uh I know you're looking
[35:06] around and figuring that if this is a
[35:08] ice cream night or not but we got too
[35:11] too many so
[35:15] so so no we just we'll just Fellowship
[35:20] around the word of the Lord and uh I I I
[35:25] I heard now
[35:26] that little Natalie's birthday's coming
[35:29] up and and and I got to thinking she
[35:31] she's 16 years old I remember when she
[35:35] was no bigger in this box of Kleenex you
[35:39] know what I mean and the grace of God
[35:41] just bloomed her up into a big young
[35:43] lady amen so uh well you wouldn't
[35:46] believe it but Caleb bill was about half
[35:49] the size of this box of Kleenex he's a
[35:51] giant you know so don't tell me that God
[35:54] can't do the
[35:56] impossible amen he's a good God and we
[36:00] really love him amen let's go ahead and
[36:02] stand up and read a Bible
[36:04] story and uh just trust that the grace
[36:08] of God will uh just do you know
[36:10] Christians ought to be happy yes sir you
[36:13] know uh I know I know maybe the the
[36:15] message this morning was a little flat
[36:18] and a little straight but uh you know
[36:21] that's the way God made it he he made it
[36:24] so that you would hear from him
[36:28] and and not have secondhand Revelation
[36:30] that that's what hurts the church you
[36:33] know it's the the gospel because people
[36:35] didn't go to the Lord and get and hear
[36:38] it for themselves they they it's like
[36:41] you remember ever play that I guess they
[36:43] call that game charade you know where
[36:45] you talk to one person on one end and
[36:48] and you said you know the butcher
[36:51] barbecued the pig and then when you get
[36:53] down to the other end after it goes down
[36:57] it says the neighbor uh you know the
[37:01] butcher said his neighbor was a pig you
[37:03] know what I mean and it it gets all all
[37:06] me messed up you know what I mean so
[37:08] there's only one way that you can keep
[37:10] it straight is keep it straight for
[37:13] yourself because though we hear the same
[37:16] word God wants that word to have an
[37:19] effect on you personally and and it and
[37:23] then then he can reflect himself through
[37:26] you that's how he can use your
[37:29] personality your nature your being that
[37:33] you are the statue that you're in that
[37:36] he can use that because you're hearing
[37:38] from him directly and you're carrying
[37:41] out his instructions so let us read this
[37:45] little story here and I I I just like
[37:48] the end of this story because it's so
[37:52] different
[37:53] than what you normally would think would
[37:58] happen Okay so we want to hold that
[38:00] thought what we normally think would
[38:03] happen and so my little title is look to
[38:07] the Unseen and get an unseen answer so
[38:12] let us read it says here in the eth
[38:14] verse it says then the king of
[38:17] Syria wared against Israel and took
[38:21] counil with his servant saying in such
[38:24] and such a place shall be my
[38:29] camp and the man of God sent unto the
[38:33] king of Israel saying beware that thou
[38:36] pass not such a place
[38:40] for H there the syrians are come
[38:44] down and the king of Israel sent to the
[38:48] place which the men of God told him and
[38:52] warned him of and saved himself there
[38:56] not once nor twice twice therefore the
[38:59] heart of the king of Syria was s
[39:03] troubled for this thing and he called
[39:07] his servants and said unto them wil thou
[39:11] not show me which of us is for the king
[39:15] of Israel and one of his servants said
[39:18] none my Lord O King but Elijah the
[39:22] prophet that is in Israel tth the king
[39:26] of Israel the the words that thou
[39:28] speaketh in thy bed chamber Hallelujah
[39:31] aren't you glad we had that kind of
[39:33] prophet amen Same Spirit Hallelujah and
[39:38] he said go and spy where he is that I
[39:42] might send and fetch him and it was told
[39:47] him saying behold he is is UN
[39:51] indan therefore sent he hither horses
[39:56] and chariots a great host and they came
[40:00] by night and compassed the city about
[40:03] amen God bless you let's go ahead and be
[40:05] seated we can finish the rest of the
[40:09] story and when the Servants of of of the
[40:13] man of God was risen early and gone
[40:17] forth Behold a host come pass the city
[40:20] both with horses and chariots and his
[40:23] servant said unto him alas my master
[40:28] how shall we
[40:31] do and he answered he said fear not for
[40:35] they that be with us are more than they
[40:39] that be with them yes sir and Elijah
[40:43] prayed and said Lord I pray thee open
[40:46] his eyes that he might see and the Lord
[40:49] opened the eyes of the young man and he
[40:53] saw and behold the mountain was full of
[40:56] horses and Chariots of Fire round about
[41:00] Elisha and when they came down to him
[41:04] Elisha prayed unto the Lord and said
[41:07] Smite this people I pray thee with
[41:11] blindness and he smote them with
[41:13] blindness according to the word of
[41:16] elishah and Elisha said unto them there
[41:20] is
[41:21] not this is not the way neither is this
[41:25] the city follow me and I will bring you
[41:29] to the man whom you seek but but he led
[41:34] them in to
[41:38] Samaria and and it came to pass when
[41:41] they were come un Samaria that elishah
[41:44] said Lord Open the Eyes of these men
[41:48] that they may see and the Lord opened
[41:52] their eyes and they saw and behold they
[41:55] were in the midst of Samaran
[41:58] and the king of Israel said unto Elijah
[42:01] when he saw them my father shall I smite
[42:05] them Smite shall I smite them and he
[42:09] answered Thou shalt not Smite them
[42:12] wouldest thou Smite Those whom thou Hast
[42:15] taken captive with thy sword and with
[42:19] thy bow but set bread and water before
[42:23] them that they may eat and drink and go
[42:27] to their master and he prepared a great
[42:30] Provisions for them and when they had
[42:33] eaten and drunk he sent sent them away
[42:37] and they went to their master so the
[42:39] bands of the syrians came no more to the
[42:43] land of Israel Heavenly Father we ask
[42:46] you to bless your word amen what an
[42:51] unlikely
[42:52] outcome and you know that just not the
[42:55] way that we would think that something
[42:59] should uh come to pass you know what I
[43:03] mean here's your enemy they've been
[43:05] pursuing you and you would think shall
[43:07] we Smite him shall we Smite him you know
[43:10] he says no don't do that he said feed
[43:14] them set a feast out before him give
[43:17] them Provisions give them water and so
[43:20] what they ended up with if I could say
[43:23] it this way is they they look to an
[43:25] unseen God
[43:28] that's what they did now they looked to
[43:30] they looked to the Unseen and they got
[43:33] an unseen answer and what I mean is by
[43:38] an unseen answer uh we could we could uh
[43:42] say it this way you know is I I I never
[43:45] saw that
[43:47] coming in other words it wasn't
[43:49] something that you would think of
[43:52] doing or that you would P perceive to do
[43:57] you wouldn't sit back and say oh this is
[44:00] the logical thing to do so these guys
[44:03] want to kill you well make them stronger
[44:06] you know give them food uh make them
[44:10] comfortable why you wouldn't do
[44:13] that I mean it doesn't make no sense it
[44:16] doesn't make no uh have any logic to it
[44:20] it doesn't have any
[44:23] uh understandable outcome you you
[44:27] wouldn't think that that would be the
[44:28] outcome of you feeding your enemy that
[44:33] they would leave and never come no more
[44:36] but they got an unseen answer something
[44:40] that they would have never seen
[44:42] themselves something they wouldn't have
[44:44] perceived themselves something they
[44:46] wouldn't have understood the themselves
[44:48] they got an answer from God that was
[44:51] totally different they they could have
[44:54] said I would have never seen that coming
[44:58] but because they went to an unseen God
[45:01] they got an unseen
[45:04] answer and so you would think
[45:08] that you know if you wanted an answer
[45:11] and and you you wouldn't go to somebody
[45:16] that nobody
[45:18] sees right if you wanted a military
[45:21] answer you would go to the
[45:23] strategists you would go to the military
[45:25] man you would go to the general I mean
[45:28] that would be the place that you would
[45:30] go you wouldn't go to an unseen
[45:34] source that nobody would even think
[45:39] existed or what do you go to you go to a
[45:42] a
[45:43] doctor right or a
[45:46] counselor I mean these these are things
[45:48] that you could see these are logical
[45:51] places that you go to get answers these
[45:54] people make money uh having answers
[45:57] anwers you know you know you would think
[46:00] that a drug counselor is somebody that
[46:02] really wants to help you so you come in
[46:05] you say I'm a drug addict the first
[46:07] thing they say do you have
[46:11] insurance well you want to know right
[46:13] then you're going to find out that if
[46:15] you run out of money you ain't getting
[46:19] well in fact they charge you so much you
[46:21] want to go get use more
[46:25] drugs you know what I I mean because
[46:27] they're looking to something they can
[46:30] see and what if you look to the scene
[46:33] you're going to get an answer that you
[46:36] expect you know go to rehab talk to
[46:39] other drug people you know when you feel
[46:42] down call your counselor and we'll walk
[46:45] you through it you know but if you look
[46:47] to the Unseen you're going to get an
[46:49] answer that you wouldn't
[46:53] expect and so the people go to it you
[46:55] know jobs people people uh I don't know
[46:58] what they call people that you know uh
[47:01] if you need a job you know you go to A A
[47:04] head hunter or something right you go to
[47:07] somebody and say uh I need a job you
[47:10] know what I mean or and you want to get
[47:11] a reference and you want to go to indeed
[47:14] you know what I mean and a lot of indeed
[47:17] really should be I
[47:21] don't you know what I mean but you know
[47:24] that's the
[47:25] course that's that's the scene
[47:28] course you know what I mean you know
[47:31] that's what You' think you would do but
[47:34] they you wouldn't think someone would go
[47:35] to the Unseen God how are you going to
[47:37] get a job I'm I'm going to go pray to
[47:40] the Unseen
[47:42] god well you might get a job totally out
[47:45] of your
[47:46] field you might get a job you never did
[47:50] before you something might come up to
[47:52] you that you totally
[47:54] unexpected why because if you go to the
[47:57] Unseen Source the Unseen God you're
[48:00] going to see get an answer that's unseen
[48:03] by everybody
[48:05] else but it's real to
[48:09] you because that's the way that that God
[48:12] does things he it's not an answer we saw
[48:15] coming I never thought I'd be where I am
[48:18] today you know I just prayed about it
[48:21] and I went to this place and this guy
[48:23] come up to me and said you know well
[48:25] here I you you don't qualify you know
[48:28] you don't have no schooling you don't
[48:29] have no degrees you don't have nothing
[48:32] but uh if you go to class and you pass
[48:34] the test I'll hire you why that's
[48:39] ridiculous totally
[48:42] ridiculous but I like
[48:44] God he can do the most ridiculous
[48:48] things you you know what I mean he he
[48:51] make he he he just make a
[48:54] way he he'll do things
[48:57] that that you you wouldn't expect but if
[49:01] you take an expected
[49:04] route and if if you if you take a carnal
[49:08] route right then then you're going to
[49:11] end up with something that's carnal that
[49:14] makes
[49:15] sense that fits into things but God's
[49:19] not interested in fitting you into the
[49:21] world he's interested in being your God
[49:25] he's interested in doing for you
[49:27] exceedingly and abundantly above what
[49:29] you can ask or think he's interested in
[49:32] proving to you that if you look to the
[49:34] supernatural he'll give you a
[49:36] supernatural answer if you look to the
[49:38] Unseen you'll get an answer that nobody
[49:41] else could see you that you never even
[49:43] saw it coming you didn't even know how
[49:46] it could work that
[49:47] way and whoever thought that feeding the
[49:51] enemy would keep them from ever
[49:54] coming that's an unseen
[49:58] answer but the reason it was unseen is
[50:02] because they sought an unseen Source
[50:06] they sought an unseen
[50:08] God and and we could go down through the
[50:11] scriptures and and and and and look at
[50:14] it we could look at
[50:16] Joshua we could we could look at the
[50:18] stories you know uh Joshua he he was
[50:23] they were going to get
[50:25] destroyed the enemy was coming they were
[50:28] they finally got the enemy to flee and
[50:30] they knew oh if they can
[50:36] regroup they'll they'll form back their
[50:39] ranks and they'll gain strength and
[50:43] it'll cost us casualties if we have to
[50:46] fight again so God
[50:49] Joshua looked up for an unseen to the
[50:54] Unseen and he got a unseen answer who
[50:58] would ever thought to stop the
[51:01] sun to stop the
[51:04] moon whatever you want to believe stop
[51:06] the Earth from spinning around it don't
[51:08] matter all I know is everything
[51:13] stopped
[51:15] why we wouldn't expect that that's not
[51:18] the answer that we would look
[51:21] for it's not even the answer that that
[51:24] we would we would come up with we would
[51:26] come up with well let's outflank them to
[51:28] the left or let's let's pursue this
[51:31] group and and then uh we'll send spies
[51:34] and we'll go from group to group we to
[51:36] come up with all kinds of
[51:40] ideas but it wouldn't be one that we've
[51:44] seen it wouldn't be one that we would
[51:46] see coming it wouldn't be one that we
[51:49] thought we could put our finger
[51:51] on no it would be something unseen
[51:56] in other words it would unseen to
[51:59] us I never I never saw that coming I
[52:03] never thought he'd do it that way I
[52:05] never thought that that would be my
[52:07] solution it'll it w it never will be
[52:10] something that you figure
[52:11] out because God likes being Supernatural
[52:15] for you he likes he likes doing things
[52:19] for you that are that are above the
[52:22] ordinary that are above what man can do
[52:25] God likes to set himself apart because
[52:28] his word calls for total separation for
[52:31] unbelief if you look to the Unseen then
[52:33] you want an unseen answer you want an
[52:37] answer that's identified in the
[52:40] Unseen I don't want a caral answer
[52:45] sir you know I don't want to go to the
[52:47] Lord and say Lord I really need
[52:48] deliverance and have God say take two
[52:51] asir and go to
[52:54] bed well
[52:57] anybody could tell me
[52:59] that but what
[53:01] happens he he spoke to your heart and
[53:05] said you you want to get rid of that
[53:07] headache why don't you read your Bible
[53:09] 10 more minutes every
[53:13] day what reading is what gives me a
[53:20] headache that's why I quit reading my
[53:23] Bible in the first place and God's
[53:25] answer is you ain't reading long
[53:29] enough pray for 10 minutes read your
[53:32] Bible 15 minutes longer your headache
[53:35] will go away well that's unseen I never
[53:38] saw that coming I wasn't expecting that
[53:41] answer but you know what the prophet of
[53:43] God said he said a son and daughter of
[53:45] God will know when God speaks my sheep
[53:48] hear my voice that's what he said you'll
[53:51] know it's God you don't have to worry
[53:54] whether it's God or not you're sheep
[53:56] you're called to hear the shepherd's
[53:58] voice if you look to him he will give
[54:01] you an answer it may not be the answer
[54:04] you expect and in fact it may be an
[54:07] answer that only works for
[54:11] you how many people that have I met in
[54:14] my life that are drinking wine for their
[54:16] stomach
[54:21] sake grab an old bottle one what are you
[54:24] doing oh the script says drink wine for
[54:27] your Su I'm tell you buddy that that
[54:30] wasn't for you I didn't see your name on
[54:33] the end of that
[54:36] scripture you know what I mean that that
[54:39] that wasn't that wasn't that scripture
[54:41] at
[54:42] all I mean where did you come up with
[54:44] that that's
[54:45] [Music]
[54:48] man-made and an unseen answer is not
[54:51] man-made if man could come up with it
[54:53] there's no new thing under the sun right
[54:56] it's just it's a just a Twist on the
[54:59] same old thing you you know what I mean
[55:02] but when God does something it gets
[55:05] [Music]
[55:06] unseen and it may be just for you but
[55:09] you know it's him and you're not you've
[55:12] heard his voice and you're not afraid to
[55:14] hack on it and that's what happens with
[55:17] God we you mean we're going to go feed
[55:19] these
[55:21] guys and they'll never come again and I
[55:25] think well they must have F them poison
[55:28] no he says you don't you don't kill your
[55:33] captive God captured
[55:36] them God's who brought them there God
[55:40] was who put them it blinded
[55:43] them and put them into the
[55:46] hand of their enemy and their enemy
[55:50] showed
[55:52] mercy and did the right thing and the
[55:55] result was one that they never would
[55:58] have expected and and the the the same
[56:02] with with Joshua I said he stops the sun
[56:06] we wouldn't have thought that you know
[56:09] Moses wouldn't have thought when he went
[56:11] down there and and and he felt pretty
[56:13] good about it and he went down there and
[56:15] threw his stick down and and all of a
[56:18] sudden his stick turns into a c he's
[56:20] standing
[56:21] there feeling pretty
[56:24] good and then they come up do the same
[56:28] thing and all he's got to do is look to
[56:31] the Unseen
[56:32] God you know and then you know his his
[56:36] serpent eats the other ones up he goes
[56:39] to
[56:40] Pharaoh you know and and so he goes to
[56:44] God God says send fleas send flies and
[56:47] you know I I enjoyed that movie The Ten
[56:49] Commandments because every time that
[56:51] Moses done something Pharaoh come up
[56:53] with some scientific answer to explain
[56:56] it all the way you know I just got to
[56:59] thinking about
[57:00] frogs man they had frogs everywhere in
[57:04] their beds in their
[57:06] cupboards I mean
[57:09] everything I mean frogs and Li and and
[57:15] oh that's the water turned oh that was
[57:17] the mines up there and the mines killed
[57:19] the fish and the fish bought dead fish
[57:21] bought the Flies and the frogs come out
[57:24] of the water to eat the Flies all
[57:27] figured
[57:28] out right they could they could they
[57:31] could they could
[57:32] see
[57:34] something in all that so all those
[57:37] things they they they could see how it
[57:39] happened you know what I mean oh that I
[57:42] can see that I could see that I could
[57:44] see that but when when Moses said let
[57:46] the death angel come through the camp
[57:49] that's something they didn't see coming
[57:52] that's something that they couldn't
[57:53] explain how the firstborn every first
[57:56] first born would
[57:58] die they didn't even see the type of
[58:00] Christ and the type of the sacrifice and
[58:03] they they were totally oblivious but
[58:06] what was it it was an
[58:08] unseen answer because they looked to the
[58:10] Unseen and they got something that they
[58:13] totally didn't expect they never saw
[58:15] that
[58:16] coming who had ever thought that putting
[58:20] Blood on the doorpost will keep the
[58:24] death angel away
[58:26] Whoever thought of putting the shed
[58:28] blood of the Lord Jesus on your life
[58:31] would keep the death angel away that by
[58:34] applying the blood you could have
[58:36] eternal life who ever thought of that
[58:39] that why man couldn't see that coming
[58:41] you could do all the works in all your
[58:43] life and it wouldn't Merit anything if
[58:45] you can do one thing for your salvation
[58:48] Jesus Christ died in vain but just to
[58:50] think the applied blood gives somebody
[58:53] eternal life Hallelujah that's unseen
[58:57] you can't figure that
[59:00] out but you look to the Unseen you'll
[59:04] get an unseen answer you know
[59:09] David you know he's facing a
[59:13] giant man giant looks at him and says
[59:16] I'm going to take this little stick and
[59:18] I'm going to take my Spear and I'm going
[59:20] to put you up on this little Branch over
[59:22] here and I'm going to have the birds eat
[59:24] your eyes out
[59:26] David looks to the
[59:30] Unseen he looks to you know and that's
[59:33] the thing he's
[59:35] unseen so they didn't know that David
[59:39] had a unseen power behind him he had a a
[59:44] force and and a power and and a a
[59:50] counselor and a prince of peace and a
[59:53] mighty God that was standing behind him
[59:57] that they couldn't see they couldn't see
[1:00:00] what was in David's Corner they couldn't
[1:00:02] see what David had on his side because
[1:00:05] he's the Unseen amen if if if if they
[1:00:10] would have seen that God they would have
[1:00:12] never uh even went up against Israel the
[1:00:16] prophet of God said if they would have
[1:00:18] seen who Jesus Christ really was they
[1:00:20] would have never crucified
[1:00:23] him but it's hid
[1:00:28] just think the Unseen
[1:00:30] source that you go to for every problem
[1:00:34] and every solution not everybody even
[1:00:37] knows he
[1:00:40] exists they might think he's
[1:00:43] somewhere but you have the you go to the
[1:00:45] Unseen God not unseen to you because
[1:00:49] your eyes have been
[1:00:52] open but it's
[1:00:54] unseen they they can't believe David's
[1:00:57] going to this Source David goes up and
[1:00:59] says I'm going to chop your head
[1:01:01] off son are you kidding
[1:01:05] me Saul even said get my armor on him
[1:01:10] you know some people you know they
[1:01:12] always want to downplay the Bible they
[1:01:15] said well Saul just was going to use
[1:01:17] David as a decoy and come up behind the
[1:01:20] back of them you know and he's going to
[1:01:22] send David out to distract the giant so
[1:01:25] they could kill everybody else God don't
[1:01:28] need no
[1:01:30] decoys amen he's got the power they just
[1:01:34] can't see it and so David sought the
[1:01:37] Unseen what did God tell him to do get
[1:01:38] five
[1:01:40] rocks take your sling
[1:01:42] shot and you're going to throw this rock
[1:01:45] up there and it's going to go through a
[1:01:47] guy's 2inch thick brass
[1:01:50] helmet and kill
[1:01:53] him where did that come from
[1:01:57] didn't come from military
[1:02:00] Scholars it didn't come from the book of
[1:02:03] how you defeat seven foot
[1:02:05] Giants by general you know whatever his
[1:02:09] name might be he didn't come from that
[1:02:12] it came from an
[1:02:14] unseen Source you seek the
[1:02:18] Unseen you'll get an unseen answer
[1:02:22] you'll get an answer that you never
[1:02:24] could have dreamed of you never never
[1:02:26] could have thought of that's our trouble
[1:02:28] is we try to think up the
[1:02:31] answers we got a program of how God can
[1:02:35] go about getting it
[1:02:38] done Lord I need this certain thing if
[1:02:41] you do this and you'd do that well if
[1:02:43] you're going to look to the Unseen don't
[1:02:46] look for a seen
[1:02:48] answer because he don't work God works
[1:02:50] in mysterious ways he W Works in ways
[1:02:53] Beyond finding out he Works in ways that
[1:02:56] you can't put your mind on how did this
[1:03:01] happen well I never saw it coming I
[1:03:04] never thought this could happen I never
[1:03:05] thought I could this would take place
[1:03:08] why because you went to the Unseen and
[1:03:12] you got an
[1:03:13] unseen
[1:03:15] answer do you know
[1:03:18] Daniel you know he prayed to the
[1:03:22] Unseen off in the line then he goes
[1:03:26] who knew what would
[1:03:28] happen he got an unseen answer because
[1:03:31] he looked to the Unseen who thought that
[1:03:34] the Lion's
[1:03:35] mouths would
[1:03:37] be I mean I I wouldn't have wrote the
[1:03:39] story that way I would have said they
[1:03:41] threw him in the den and Daniel with
[1:03:45] much
[1:03:46] learning looked around the cave and he
[1:03:49] saw a stick and he saw a stone and he he
[1:03:54] set it up that he set this trap up where
[1:03:58] he put the Stick Over The Stone and then
[1:04:01] he covered it up and when the lion come
[1:04:04] the stick come up and knocked them in
[1:04:06] the head and slay the lion now that's
[1:04:11] what we to come up
[1:04:12] with we had to come up with a seen
[1:04:16] answer so an answer that we could see an
[1:04:20] answer that we could comprehend but who
[1:04:23] would have ever thought that all of a
[1:04:24] sudden God was would stop the mouths of
[1:04:26] the
[1:04:27] lion that's not the end of the story he
[1:04:30] didn't stop the mouths of the lion he
[1:04:33] just stopped who the lions were going to
[1:04:37] eat he just changed the menu that's the
[1:04:40] only thing that
[1:04:41] happened amen they had ordered Daniel
[1:04:45] and they got fed some
[1:04:48] spies you see that that's all that
[1:04:51] happened the lions were still
[1:04:53] hungry but the Unseen God God changed
[1:04:56] the menu hey man there's something new
[1:04:59] for dinner boys and it ain't
[1:05:05] Daniel sure that's what that's what's so
[1:05:08] good about it if you look to the Unseen
[1:05:12] you're going to get an unseen answer an
[1:05:14] answer you never thought of an answer
[1:05:16] that you couldn't put your finger on an
[1:05:18] answer that you could have do it and he
[1:05:20] we heard this morning he wants to answer
[1:05:23] you
[1:05:25] he wants you to seek him he wants you to
[1:05:30] go to him and lay it before him and and
[1:05:34] and have them give you the answer that
[1:05:38] you would have never seen yourself and
[1:05:42] nobody else would have ever seen
[1:05:45] it you don't know what God
[1:05:48] does we just trust
[1:05:51] him you know I mean uh you know a
[1:05:58] Gideon I mean my goodness Whoever
[1:06:00] thought you I mean look those stories
[1:06:02] are
[1:06:03] unbelievable get
[1:06:05] torches and
[1:06:08] pots
[1:06:10] really who would have figured out which
[1:06:13] great General would have figured out
[1:06:16] that if you take a a torch and a pot and
[1:06:21] a
[1:06:22] trumpet that the Army would kill
[1:06:24] themselves
[1:06:29] you never want a pastor to come to the
[1:06:31] platform with a torch a pot and a
[1:06:34] trumpet because you know he's about
[1:06:36] tired of the congregation you know what
[1:06:39] I mean no you wouldn't have come up with
[1:06:42] that answer you would have never thought
[1:06:44] that it would happen that way would you
[1:06:46] no you wouldn't think that God would go
[1:06:48] to bat for you in a way that doesn't
[1:06:50] make any sense but he looked to the
[1:06:53] Unseen and he got an answer
[1:06:56] there was a
[1:06:58] route not not with a army of Israel not
[1:07:01] with 30,000 not with 10,000 with
[1:07:07] 300 that is an unseen
[1:07:10] answer one that nobody else would have
[1:07:12] come up with but the results were
[1:07:15] results that nobody would expect and
[1:07:19] that's the kind of God we serve this is
[1:07:22] the kind of place that he's wanting the
[1:07:25] Church to come up to he's wanting the
[1:07:28] church to climb that ladder of faith not
[1:07:32] with trying to look back over events and
[1:07:36] try to
[1:07:38] revive an answer from days gone
[1:07:42] by and we listened to that in the quote
[1:07:45] this morning he says they're always
[1:07:46] looking back to another age and going
[1:07:49] back no I'm going to examples but the
[1:07:52] examples are to tell you that that
[1:07:55] unseen answer exists for you in the day
[1:07:59] that we live in and in the circumstances
[1:08:02] that we are in now that we can get an
[1:08:04] unseen answer for today because he's the
[1:08:07] same yesterday today and
[1:08:10] forever and that's where he wants us to
[1:08:13] rise up to in
[1:08:15] faith that we too can look to the Unseen
[1:08:20] and then watch God do something a
[1:08:22] miracle that's just beyond
[1:08:26] anything we could have ever thought of
[1:08:30] happening totally
[1:08:32] unseen totally not prec
[1:08:36] comprehended because we look to the
[1:08:38] Unseen we got an unseen answer and the
[1:08:42] the answer will be something that nobody
[1:08:43] else has ever seen before I've never
[1:08:46] seen that
[1:08:48] before when that boy received his sight
[1:08:52] they said never before have we seen in
[1:08:55] is Israel that one that was B born blind
[1:08:59] receives this
[1:09:01] sight why because they had contacted the
[1:09:06] Unseen and that's what you have to see
[1:09:08] you have an unseen power that walks with
[1:09:12] you you have if God be for you who can
[1:09:15] be against you you have an unseen power
[1:09:18] that that that is standing behind you to
[1:09:22] fulfill your desires and the things that
[1:09:26] you look to him to do because he said
[1:09:29] come unto me and I won't cast you out he
[1:09:32] didn't say I'm going to give you an
[1:09:33] answer that you might be able to
[1:09:36] comprehend he says no I'm going to do
[1:09:38] for you something unseen something
[1:09:42] special just for you something tailored
[1:09:45] just for you just for your
[1:09:47] need and we've got God where he's he's
[1:09:50] he's we got him category these are the
[1:09:53] things he does well we got demons today
[1:09:57] that I don't know where they've come
[1:09:59] from but we've got a God that can defeat
[1:10:02] every single one of them how he does it
[1:10:05] he can do it any way he wants to and
[1:10:07] it'll be a way that we don't expect
[1:10:10] because God works in unexpected
[1:10:15] ways and I there's a message titled that
[1:10:20] I wish I could quote it better to
[1:10:22] you but it's it's God working in
[1:10:28] un un
[1:10:30] unexpected ways doing the UN
[1:10:35] accept unacceptable not acceptable
[1:10:39] unexpected ways that we never would
[1:10:42] expect that he would work he would work
[1:10:45] we just go down through you know
[1:10:48] Samson who ever thought that you could
[1:10:51] take a
[1:10:53] dried draw bone of a
[1:10:56] donkey and kill a thousand
[1:10:59] Philistines why he looked to the
[1:11:02] Unseen and he got an answer they didn't
[1:11:05] expect it here they come and here's a
[1:11:09] guy standing with a dried up old job
[1:11:16] on they thought
[1:11:20] lunatic that's what they thought this
[1:11:23] guy is a Luna
[1:11:26] kick he needs to be eliminated from the
[1:11:29] face of the Earth what we'll do is we'll
[1:11:32] stick a thousand Spears in
[1:11:34] him you know what I mean and we'll fill
[1:11:37] him so full of so many
[1:11:40] holes that there won't be enough of them
[1:11:43] left for
[1:11:45] anything and here he is you know that
[1:11:47] old long hair down there you know and in
[1:11:49] the scripture we think Samson is a great
[1:11:51] big guy he's a little skinny Ruddy guy
[1:11:56] you know what I mean if a little old
[1:11:57] skinny run guy there with a
[1:12:00] jobble come on boys I've looked to the
[1:12:04] Unseen and I got an answer in my hand
[1:12:07] that you would never expect you never
[1:12:10] saw this coming you would have never
[1:12:13] perceived that this would work you would
[1:12:15] never understand that this this is
[1:12:18] what's going to come to pass that I'm
[1:12:20] going to knock you
[1:12:22] all no they didn't expect them to pack a
[1:12:25] gate out the city
[1:12:28] too because that's the kind of God we
[1:12:30] serve and until we could start getting
[1:12:33] our
[1:12:35] hearts lifted
[1:12:37] up and know that if God before us who
[1:12:41] can be against us and start expecting
[1:12:44] the supernatural to come in ways that
[1:12:47] the world would never understand we're
[1:12:50] always going to be living short of the
[1:12:53] glory that God wants to manifest in
[1:12:57] us and that's what he says if you read
[1:12:59] in Hebrews 511 he talks about that God
[1:13:03] we're not don't despised we're not
[1:13:05] discouraged you know trotten down we we
[1:13:08] we don't have hope that Christ might be
[1:13:10] manifested in our
[1:13:13] bodies this is this is a great thing you
[1:13:16] know
[1:13:18] finally they cut his hair off they pluck
[1:13:21] his eyes
[1:13:22] out but they he got a hold of those
[1:13:27] pillars once more
[1:13:29] Lord once more amen they were mocking
[1:13:33] God you think they expected
[1:13:36] him to tear down that
[1:13:41] building which architect do you think
[1:13:44] designed a
[1:13:46] building that a blind guy could walk
[1:13:52] up and tear down
[1:13:58] what great
[1:14:00] Builder built a building that a little
[1:14:04] skinny blind
[1:14:06] runt could pull
[1:14:09] down tell me you think they hesitated
[1:14:13] twice to tie him
[1:14:17] up they were Mak a sport of him laughing
[1:14:20] me he said to those case just put me
[1:14:22] between the twoo pillars
[1:14:25] and he reached out and felt those
[1:14:27] pillars you think anybody was
[1:14:29] afraid you think they sat back and said
[1:14:32] oh you better watch out Samson's fixing
[1:14:35] to care tear down this whole
[1:14:39] building no you think they designed it
[1:14:42] that building that two pillars would
[1:14:45] take it
[1:14:46] down no we design buildings if you take
[1:14:50] a wall out the whole place don't fall
[1:14:53] apart you take take two studs out of a
[1:14:56] wall if it falls down you better look
[1:14:58] for
[1:15:00] termites
[1:15:02] no they built that thing right they
[1:15:05] built that thing strong it stood for
[1:15:08] years what was the problem they were
[1:15:10] dealing with the
[1:15:13] Unseen there was an unseen God that was
[1:15:16] going to give an unseen answer an answer
[1:15:19] they didn't expect that's right and he
[1:15:21] wasn't looking for a military host he
[1:15:24] wasn't looking look for an architect he
[1:15:26] didn't seek an architect how can I tear
[1:15:29] this building down he didn't go to the
[1:15:31] contractor and say where's the weak SP
[1:15:33] spot he didn't he didn't go to a seen
[1:15:38] Source he went to an unseen source and
[1:15:42] he got an unseen answer and he got
[1:15:45] results that nobody expected because he
[1:15:48] went to an unseen
[1:15:50] God
[1:15:52] Amen that's just the way it is
[1:15:55] you take Shadrach mhach
[1:15:59] Abednego
[1:16:01] amen who ever thought oh King live
[1:16:06] forever we wish you
[1:16:08] well they never ate his
[1:16:11] food and they never got
[1:16:15] sick they were honest Whoever thought
[1:16:19] three teenage boys would come to be
[1:16:22] running the Affairs of the king why why
[1:16:25] because they look to the
[1:16:27] Unseen they kept God's word they rose up
[1:16:31] into places that that we wouldn't even
[1:16:35] think was
[1:16:36] possible could you imagine the
[1:16:39] jealousy around them the
[1:16:43] criticism that everything's going right
[1:16:45] for them and they can't figure out why
[1:16:49] how come these boys pull this
[1:16:52] off they don't eat nothing but
[1:16:56] vegetables you know they don't eat all
[1:16:58] this they don't eat no pork they don't
[1:17:01] have bacon for breakast they don't they
[1:17:03] don't they don't take none of the King's
[1:17:05] food they they they they they wash
[1:17:09] everything you know they don't dress
[1:17:11] like everybody else and yet these guys
[1:17:14] are running the Affairs of the
[1:17:18] king and they they they were
[1:17:22] jealous I'd be jealous too
[1:17:27] and so they tried to trap
[1:17:30] him think of
[1:17:32] that if you don't bow down they trick
[1:17:35] the king got Daniel in the lion stand
[1:17:38] trick the king lit up the furnace seven
[1:17:41] times hotter in they go but they were
[1:17:46] looking for the Unseen God now if I
[1:17:50] would have wrote that
[1:17:51] story I would have wrote it like this
[1:17:54] opened the furnace
[1:17:57] doors and the clouds began to grow in
[1:18:00] the sky and the sky grew dark and all of
[1:18:04] a sudden you could feel the pitter
[1:18:06] patter of the rain and the ground began
[1:18:10] to flood and the water Rose quickly from
[1:18:13] all the ground and down the streets it
[1:18:15] came and it funnel right down into the
[1:18:19] doors of the furnace and quenched it
[1:18:27] I'd be a better Bible writer than those
[1:18:29] guys
[1:18:30] right or how about a wh
[1:18:34] went came down and sucked all the fire
[1:18:37] out and it blew out in the sky out into
[1:18:42] the
[1:18:42] sky oh yeah but you know something you
[1:18:46] could imagine
[1:18:49] that sure you could imagine a way it
[1:18:53] could happen but you would have never
[1:18:55] come up with them going into the
[1:18:58] fire and there being a fourth man in
[1:19:01] there already uh-uh no you couldn't have
[1:19:04] come up with that because that come from
[1:19:06] an unseen source that come from somebody
[1:19:09] that's looked to the Unseen and got an
[1:19:12] answer that was unseen to every other
[1:19:15] man except for them that believed and
[1:19:17] who was it behold there's one like the
[1:19:19] Son of God standing in the midst of the
[1:19:22] fire Hallelujah that's who we got
[1:19:24] standing with we got an unseen answer
[1:19:27] when we seek after an unseen God Amen
[1:19:31] and that's the kind of
[1:19:33] faith and
[1:19:36] security and hope that he wants the
[1:19:40] church to have I can look to the
[1:19:45] Supernatural and I'm not going to be
[1:19:47] able to understand what he's going to do
[1:19:50] and he doesn't have to tell me what he's
[1:19:53] going to do but he will do something
[1:19:57] that identifies himself as being the god
[1:20:01] of every circumstance in every situation
[1:20:05] so don't ever
[1:20:07] fear you need work look to the
[1:20:10] Unseen you need peace look to the Unseen
[1:20:14] don't look to the medicine
[1:20:17] cabinet you know what I mean don't F
[1:20:20] don't don't say oh doc I need some
[1:20:22] proac I need some
[1:20:25] valum I need this I need that you know
[1:20:29] if you look to the Unseen i g see if I
[1:20:31] can find this statement I think I'd like
[1:20:34] to read
[1:20:35] it it's pretty
[1:20:42] good he he says
[1:20:49] this he said Jesus died and he climbed
[1:20:53] in the ramp part hearts of glory and he
[1:20:56] said in he the heavens of Heavens there
[1:20:59] ain't nothing going to bother you His
[1:21:02] Eye Is on the Sparrow and I know he
[1:21:05] watches me and he watches you then when
[1:21:10] there come if there should come a
[1:21:13] cyclone or something to disturb one of
[1:21:16] these little ones why she they had
[1:21:19] better not she would pick up you know
[1:21:22] he's talking about the Eagles he'd pick
[1:21:24] up
[1:21:25] uh up a coyote in her hand and she would
[1:21:28] paw and carry him to several thousand
[1:21:31] feet and just turn him loose he he he
[1:21:34] would disintegrate in the air nothing's
[1:21:37] going to bother them little ones she is
[1:21:40] going to see to it nothing's going to
[1:21:43] bother you don't be scared to take God
[1:21:47] at his word just relax and have faith
[1:21:51] and believe he watches over you he'll
[1:21:55] disintegrate anything that tries to
[1:21:58] bother you oh it might attack at you but
[1:22:01] it can't harm you for all things he
[1:22:05] permits it it could do nothing else for
[1:22:08] it works together for the good to them
[1:22:11] that love the Lord no harm can come to
[1:22:16] you amen it might look like it's going
[1:22:19] to harm
[1:22:21] you but there's an unseen
[1:22:25] force that walks with you there's an
[1:22:29] unseen power that Goliath didn't know
[1:22:33] David
[1:22:34] had that the king didn't know that
[1:22:37] Shadrach abish abedo that they didn't
[1:22:40] know that Daniel had it they didn't know
[1:22:42] that Gideon had it they didn't know that
[1:22:46] Samson had it they just didn't
[1:22:50] know if they would have they wouldn't
[1:22:52] have
[1:22:55] and that's the same way it is Satan
[1:22:58] don't believe you got an unseen power
[1:23:01] but we don't believe what he believes
[1:23:03] anyway why because he's a
[1:23:05] liar and there's no truth in him and if
[1:23:08] he don't believe it well that's all the
[1:23:10] better for us then our unseen power can
[1:23:14] work so tonight I I just think that God
[1:23:18] so wants you to have
[1:23:22] confidence that he'll take care of you
[1:23:25] that he'll disintegrate everything he'll
[1:23:28] take everything he'll work it together
[1:23:30] for the good he'll no matter how bad it
[1:23:34] hurt no matter how difficult it was it
[1:23:37] wouldn't happened unless the Unseen God
[1:23:41] allowed it and the result in the answer
[1:23:44] is going to be something that man never
[1:23:47] expected you know I think there's going
[1:23:49] to be a lot of people in heaven that if
[1:23:51] it was up to us we'd have put them in
[1:23:54] hell
[1:23:56] but God can do things that you can't
[1:23:57] even believe possible let's just look to
[1:24:01] the Unseen and leave everything else in
[1:24:04] his hands God bless you tonight amen
[1:24:08] [Applause]
[1:24:19] go amen let's all stand let's sing that
[1:24:22] song the Unseen hand
[1:24:25] amen it's one guiding all every step of
[1:24:28] the way
[1:24:38] amen I believe it's
