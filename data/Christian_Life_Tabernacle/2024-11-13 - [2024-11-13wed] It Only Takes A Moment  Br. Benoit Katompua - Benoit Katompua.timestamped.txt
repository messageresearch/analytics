[22:34] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[22:35] Christ
[22:38] amen I
[22:41] uh Billy kind of put me on the spot
[22:45] but uh so I was I turned in
[22:51] a a testimony to give a testimony during
[22:55] the meetings and when it didn't happen I
[22:58] was just like you know well maybe it was
[22:59] for
[23:00] me but
[23:03] uh brother Billy asked me to to give it
[23:06] and so I'll just share but I'll just
[23:09] tell
[23:11] you I could have a testimony for the
[23:14] past two days three days since the
[23:17] meetings have happened I mean it's just
[23:19] the Lord has just really been dealing
[23:21] with my heart and it's been it's been
[23:24] very
[23:25] special uh
[23:28] uh me and another brother worked
[23:30] together a lot and I kind of told him
[23:33] you know the Lord's really been dealing
[23:35] with me and and
[23:38] uh it it's really something that's
[23:41] really hard to admit to people when you
[23:45] have something like this on you but this
[23:48] has been probably something I've been
[23:50] dealing with for 30 years and uh it's
[23:53] just a negative Spirit you know and a
[23:56] complaining spirit always finding
[23:57] something wrong wrong with what's going
[24:00] on or how your life is going or you know
[24:02] why does everything got to be like this
[24:05] or like that and well I just I just came
[24:08] out and asked the Lord you know hey
[24:10] Lord I I need you to deal with this
[24:13] because this is something I've been
[24:14] dealing with a long time and I'm just
[24:16] tired of it and so the Lord even before
[24:20] the meetings happened he had already
[24:22] dealt with it and then when I came to
[24:24] work Monday of course the Devil he's
[24:27] going to bring everything
[24:29] and so it it started again and I and I
[24:32] was just like you know what I'm not
[24:33] going to get caught up in it and I
[24:36] prayed before I went to work and and
[24:40] this morning I even took a little extra
[24:42] time set it aside and just Lord I just
[24:47] need you to deal with it and help me I
[24:49] said you know you be in total control
[24:52] and so he's really he's really stepped
[24:55] in and helped me to overcome this and
[24:57] and I'm really
[24:59] looking forward to what he has because I
[25:00] feel like it gave me back my joy I felt
[25:03] like I lost my joy and and I I feel like
[25:05] he gave me that back and uh I
[25:09] uh
[25:11] so I did write a little something and
[25:14] I'm not a writer but I did write a
[25:15] little something because it it just
[25:17] really struck my heart
[25:20] and uh it
[25:22] wasn't it was just in the moment and
[25:25] I'll just share it and I wasn't going to
[25:27] do this but but it it kind of goes along
[25:30] with what I've been dealing
[25:32] with and it this involves all of us but
[25:38] it says God has called a special people
[25:40] a group of
[25:42] Believers uh the bride of Christ to
[25:45] overcome at every turn the deception
[25:48] that has been put on the World by Satan
[25:52] himself we know that by the word of God
[25:57] we cannot be deceived
[25:59] for we are the bride of Christ The
[26:01] Living Army of God and shall win and
[26:04] overcome by the word of God which is our
[26:06] food for the
[26:08] hour Satan we hope you are listening for
[26:12] all we will not be
[26:16] defeated you are a defeated Foe and we
[26:18] will rise up in Victory because of the
[26:21] word of God says so and then this
[26:26] scripture that that I I just it I just
[26:29] happened to cross it that morning when I
[26:32] was reading and it just went so well but
[26:36] and so it says there is one B this is uh
[26:40] Ephesians
[26:41] 44 there is one body and one Spirit even
[26:45] as you are called in one hope of your
[26:47] calling one Lord One Faith one baptism
[26:50] one God and our father of all who is
[26:54] above all and through all and in you all
[26:58] but unto every one of us is given Grace
[27:02] according to the measure of the gift of
[27:04] Christ wherefore he saith when he
[27:08] ascended upon high he led
[27:11] captive captivity captive and gave gifts
[27:14] unto men now that he ascended what is it
[27:19] but that he also descended first into
[27:22] the lower parts of the earth he that
[27:24] descended in the same also that ascended
[27:27] up far above all Heaven that he might
[27:30] fill all things and he gave some
[27:34] Apostles and some prophets and some
[27:36] evangelists and some pastors and
[27:38] teachers for the Perfection of the
[27:41] Saints for the working of the ministry
[27:43] for the edifying of the body of Christ
[27:46] and that's that's us amen and then this
[27:49] is just to finish off what I was writing
[27:51] so and it says so Satan you know that
[27:54] the
[27:55] word you know the word so for that what
[27:59] it's worth take this the word of God and
[28:03] go crawl in your fiery hole in Ephesians
[28:06] 4 4-6 and that's
[28:09] [Applause]
[28:14] it
[28:16] amen the word of God is our weapon amen
[28:19] when it comes to you use it chop him
[28:22] piece by piece and just cast him out
[28:25] tell him you don't have a place here
[28:27] amen that's that's how we overcome
[28:31] amen I bless your

[28:43] all to give you

[34:08] amen if thank you musicians if you were
[34:14] to turn your Bibles with me to John
[34:17] chapter
[34:24] 8 we'll start in the first verse
[34:28] we read to the
[34:35] 11th if you're there say
[34:39] Amen the scripture
[34:41] reads Jesus went unto the Mount of
[34:44] Olives and early in the morning he came
[34:46] again into the temple and all the people
[34:49] came unto him and he sat down and taught
[34:52] them and the scribes and
[34:55] Pharisees brought unto him a woman
[34:58] taken in adultery and when they had set
[35:01] her in the midst they say unto him
[35:03] Master this woman was taken in adultery
[35:06] in the very act now Moses and the law
[35:09] commanded us that such should be stoned
[35:12] but what sayest
[35:14] thou this they said tempting him that
[35:17] they might have to accuse him but Jesus
[35:19] stood down stooped down and with his
[35:22] finger wrote on the ground as though he
[35:25] heard them not so when they continued
[35:27] asking him he lifted up himself and said
[35:29] unto them he that is without sin among
[35:32] you let him first cast a stone at her
[35:36] and again he stooped down and rode on
[35:37] the ground and they which heard it being
[35:40] convicted by their own conscience went
[35:42] out one by one beginning at the eldest
[35:44] even unto the last and the El the last
[35:47] and Jesus was left alone and the woman
[35:50] standing in the midst when Jesus had
[35:53] lifted up himself and saw none but the
[35:55] woman he said unto her wom you know I I
[35:59] I I want us to put ourselves in this
[36:02] situation with the things you've
[36:04] committed it may not be adultery it may
[36:06] be adultery but now you have Satan who's
[36:11] the accuser of the Brethren and he's now
[36:13] bringing it before Jesus and said well
[36:15] your word says that the wages of sin are
[36:18] death well these people have sinned so
[36:21] what sayest thou and Jesus speaks and
[36:24] put your name there he says
[36:26] women where are are thine accusers had
[36:29] no man condemned thee she said no man
[36:33] Lord and Jesus said unto her neither do
[36:35] I condemn thee go and sin no more may
[36:39] the Lord add a blessing to the reading
[36:41] of his word you may be
[36:50] seated try my best
[36:56] to just
[36:58] there's so much here that uh the Lord
[37:01] had been dealing with me
[37:04] about
[37:06] uh a while ago on a job
[37:09] with brother Tommy went down to Houston
[37:13] working on a house down there and we had
[37:15] a great
[37:16] conversation about the word and and how
[37:19] often times people question themselves
[37:22] they they question where they're at in
[37:24] life they question the things that God
[37:26] has done for them they misidentify
[37:30] Christ in their life because of the
[37:32] mistake that they make they misidentify
[37:35] who they are because of what they see in
[37:37] the mirror and as we got to talking the
[37:41] Lord had been dealing with me about a
[37:43] subject it only takes a moment and we
[37:47] understand the importance of
[37:49] moments Webster would say a moment is a
[37:51] brief period of time another definition
[37:54] being importance in other words gravity
[37:57] serious weight Veil prominence
[38:01] significance you know we know that it
[38:03] says in a moment in a twinkling of and I
[38:05] we shall be changed so there's power in
[38:08] a moment something takes place when a
[38:11] moment happens a prophet would preach in
[38:14] another sense from that time speaking of
[38:18] a a specific moment in time that
[38:20] something took place that changed the
[38:23] course of your
[38:24] life we want to be real uh uh
[38:28] sober in and thinking about moments in
[38:30] the way that the Lord dealt with
[38:32] me a moment stands
[38:35] alone you may not understand the moment
[38:38] you may receive the revelation of it
[38:40] later on but it
[38:42] doesn't diminish the value of that
[38:46] moment and often times the Lord will be
[38:49] doing something for you he'll move on
[38:51] your behalf he'll show you something and
[38:54] you don't catch it then
[38:58] the closest example I could give to you
[38:59] for example is if you're a parent and
[39:01] you've got kids and they're stubborn and
[39:03] they don't listen I was one of them you
[39:07] you say something over and over and over
[39:09] and over again it's the same thing they
[39:11] don't get it then finally someone says
[39:14] the exact same thing not that they added
[39:17] anything or took away anything but they
[39:19] said exactly what you said and for some
[39:21] reason an aha moment takes place like
[39:24] well I caught that wow I've never heard
[39:26] that before
[39:28] but but you have your entire life but
[39:31] sometimes you miss what God is doing it
[39:34] isn't until you look back and say wow
[39:36] this were just small instances in time
[39:39] that led up to this exact moment this
[39:42] specific hour where God was going to do
[39:44] this thing give you the Revelation for
[39:46] this specific
[39:48] thing the devil loves to disturb you
[39:51] when you have a powerful moment with God
[39:53] if we were to list down some moments
[39:55] that you that you have one of them would
[39:57] be
[39:57] when you get the new birth it's a
[40:00] trouble for a lot of people knowing that
[40:02] do I have what it is that I claim that I
[40:04] have this experience of a new birth do I
[40:07] have it right and what the devil will do
[40:10] is rather than just letting you believe
[40:13] or just plat flat out saying you don't
[40:16] have it he's gotten Smart in this hour
[40:19] he'd rather give you something else as a
[40:21] substitute for proof for you that you've
[40:23] got something when in fact the very
[40:25] thing you're anchoring on was never
[40:27] proof given to the church right you say
[40:29] well I've shouted well I have it that's
[40:32] not it well I've spoken in tongues well
[40:34] I have it well that's not it see all the
[40:36] devil can do when God gives you a moment
[40:39] is he'll bombard your mind with who you
[40:42] are according to his kingdom and if
[40:45] you're not careful then you'll be
[40:47] listening to what he says of you and
[40:49] you'll miss the very moment God's trying
[40:51] to do something for you but we want to
[40:54] be real calm in our spirit we want to be
[40:56] STI
[40:57] and not miss anything right sometimes
[41:00] when you're too loud you'll miss the
[41:02] still moment that's happening before
[41:05] you sometimes when you get too busy you
[41:09] miss the leadership of God there's
[41:11] moments that take place in our life
[41:13] every single day if we're not careful
[41:16] we'll get too occupied and we'll miss
[41:18] that God's trying to do something for us
[41:21] rather than get into the moment and say
[41:24] Lord what is it that you would have for
[41:25] me in this hour in this time we'll say
[41:29] well no you know I've got this bill I've
[41:30] got this to handle I've got that the
[41:33] Lord will be trying to in a service tell
[41:35] you if you want the Holy Ghost claim it
[41:37] it's yours and right in that moment
[41:40] something inside of you says oh I want
[41:42] that Holy Ghost I want to just draw so
[41:44] close to it let me grab a hold of it and
[41:46] then right in that same instance because
[41:48] the spirits are twins right the you have
[41:51] the spirit of God that comes and he's
[41:53] pulling you to him and then the Devil
[41:55] comes well now in the same moment
[41:57] see we often think that it starts when
[41:59] you leave the door but he plants a seed
[42:01] when you're sitting down that says when
[42:03] you leave nothing's changed this is just
[42:06] a workup this is just excitement this is
[42:08] nothing that's profound you've been
[42:10] you've been here before you've heard
[42:11] this before it hasn't changed you before
[42:14] so how is it going to change you
[42:16] now you got we have to be really careful
[42:19] at the tactics of the devil right we
[42:21] know in this time that it's our promise
[42:24] to be able to know the two Spirits
[42:26] within the framework of the church
[42:29] discern them both it's it's good to just
[42:32] it's good to know but now you have to
[42:34] understand well how do I go with the
[42:36] right one how do I stay away from the
[42:38] wrong one the spirits are right there
[42:41] going together they're
[42:43] twins so you thinking on that and and
[42:46] looking at a moment and and and and
[42:48] trying to put
[42:51] myself in in the mind frame that I was
[42:53] in because I caught myself missing many
[42:55] moments I caught myself missing a lot of
[42:59] opportunities I
[43:03] I that Devil's good but I caught myself
[43:07] missing a lot of opportunities we we we
[43:10] we had gone out to eat one time uh I
[43:12] think our pastor have preached a
[43:14] powerful moment about being um being
[43:17] really sensitive to the voice of God and
[43:21] me and brother Tommy had gone out to eat
[43:23] somewhere for lunch and I I saw this
[43:27] this blind man and it it wasn't just
[43:30] that he was blind but it was almost as
[43:32] if somebody took a spoon and scooped his
[43:35] eye out and it was melted so there was
[43:38] no reignment of eyes there and you you
[43:41] see
[43:42] that and it started to work on me that's
[43:45] the first thing I saw when I walked into
[43:47] that restaurant was that blind man and
[43:49] we just got done listening to a prophet
[43:52] speak and saying if you've got the word
[43:55] and the Lord moves on your heart
[43:57] act but rather than acting I Justified
[44:02] myself well he doesn't have any eyes how
[44:03] is I could pray for him but that's
[44:06] that's too big of a miracle that's
[44:08] something too great why would God do
[44:10] that with me but failing to remember
[44:14] that it's got nothing to do with you
[44:17] everything to do with him if you say and
[44:20] speak his word he's the one that moves
[44:23] it's not you we're so fixated on wanting
[44:27] it to be
[44:29] us we we could look for an example at
[44:31] Joshua Joshua in the Bible the great man
[44:34] who told the son stop where you are how
[44:36] many of us have stopped the
[44:39] sun he drew his sword Amen brother
[44:42] Matthew he drew his sword out and said
[44:46] are you for us or the enemy what man
[44:49] with courage
[44:51] that's you saw what happened with with
[44:54] the river The Parting of it you you see
[44:57] all the things that took place in
[44:59] Joshua's life yet such a powerful man
[45:03] Drew no power from himself but he was
[45:06] given a promise the scripture said the
[45:09] words that I gave to my servant Moses
[45:12] take those words live on those words
[45:16] meditate day and night on those words
[45:20] see it's not because a prophet goes off
[45:23] the scene that now because I can do
[45:25] signs and wonders that I not have a
[45:27] voice lord it's the same message that
[45:30] that Prophet preached the power is still
[45:33] the same if you want to stop a son if
[45:36] you want to speak to a storm it's not
[45:38] your own strength it's not your own
[45:39] might but it's his word that does it our
[45:43] task is get in the word take the word
[45:46] apply the word he moves on the word he
[45:50] didn't ask you to move on it he just
[45:52] asked you to believe in its
[45:55] Simplicity and thinking on the this
[45:57] moment as I was there at the restaurant
[45:59] and and I see this the blind man and I I
[46:02] I start now doubting the very word I
[46:05] just heard I got excited in church I
[46:09] loved hearing that oh i' I've got the
[46:11] power to speak the
[46:13] word at my word not because I've been
[46:16] made somebody but because the brides
[46:18] been given thus sayeth the Lord I could
[46:21] have said something to him and prayed
[46:23] for him I don't know what God would have
[46:25] done but I psyched myself out before
[46:30] ever doing
[46:31] anything and that Aid at me because how
[46:35] many times do we see a
[46:37] burden that somebody has a struggle a
[46:40] pain something serious and we're so
[46:44] fixated on our troubles what we've got
[46:48] going on that we can't take a second and
[46:51] say you know what I'm going to deny
[46:53] myself and live for the others let me
[46:56] inter in for them you know in fact you
[46:59] entering in for somebody else will cause
[47:01] God to move on your behalf but you can't
[47:03] just be Focus focused on what you got
[47:06] going on that you can't see what God's
[47:08] trying to do in others
[47:10] lives I realized in that moment I said
[47:13] Lord I missed it I missed that
[47:17] moment I don't know what God would have
[47:19] done but we serve a
[47:22] God who proves his word it doesn't
[47:26] change
[47:27] it Remains the Same if he saved then and
[47:30] he healed then if the blind saw then
[47:33] they see now and they will see in the
[47:36] future his word doesn't change we're the
[47:39] ones that change and then we try to
[47:42] change his word to fit what we think oh
[47:47] I don't have a great enough years in the
[47:50] message and preaching this word I
[47:53] couldn't say nothing to that person man
[47:56] I just started leaving last week what
[47:58] good is my word going to do for that
[48:00] person they have a serious need let me
[48:03] go get this 50 plus year veteran to say
[48:06] something I'm sorry who baptized Paul
[48:10] was it
[48:12] Peter we would call it a
[48:15] nobody what did ananas do not not ananas
[48:18] is Safar but what did he do what was his
[48:22] story outside of baptizing Paul where
[48:25] else did you hear his name
[48:28] don't belittle your significance in the
[48:30] kingdom of God somebody who just got
[48:33] saved yesterday has got the same Power
[48:37] by the word as the one that's been in
[48:39] this message for 50 years your task with
[48:43] believing the word and speaking the word
[48:46] not understanding or comprehending how
[48:47] it will come to be just say what he said
[48:51] and he moves on your behalf and it
[48:54] wasn't for the lack of understanding
[48:56] that I had for the lack of examples that
[48:59] I've had of God doing miraculous things
[49:02] I I trust we've all heard the testimony
[49:04] of brother Brandon with the young lady
[49:05] that was blind and he's praying for her
[49:08] and you see these two twinkles little
[49:10] little look like little stars coming
[49:12] down and they stop he goes wait a minute
[49:14] brother Brandon for forgot to ask you
[49:16] what color eyes you wanted and he speaks
[49:19] the word and she gets the ey she asked
[49:21] for we've seen the Miracles we've seen
[49:24] the example of what being in a moment
[49:26] looks like coming off of a plane well I
[49:29] got to be here I got to be there but
[49:31] trusting and I'm going this way I'm
[49:32] going to take a left I'm going to take a
[49:33] right hello Parson how' you know I was a
[49:35] Parson see our Prophet was an example
[49:38] for us of how to live in a moment right
[49:42] denying yourself it was a sacrifice he
[49:45] made being away from his family being
[49:48] away from his loved ones that didn't
[49:49] come with no cost it pained him to be
[49:54] away from his little girl
[49:57] but yet he had to to bring us this
[50:00] message and we think we can live in a
[50:03] present moment with Christ with anything
[50:06] less than a
[50:08] sacrifice let's not miss the moment of
[50:11] what God's trying to
[50:14] do we we we touched on the times
[50:17] that where you have the struggle with
[50:20] the Holy Spirit Well do I have it do I
[50:23] not it was I want to say years of
[50:27] battling in my mind and it's not just
[50:30] the young people that deal with this but
[50:32] even the older ones that fight
[50:35] questioning do I have it do I have it do
[50:38] I have it do I have it you can't start
[50:41] you you can't move forward till you
[50:44] answer that question so the devil's only
[50:47] objective if he can get you to
[50:50] misrepresent the moment you had with God
[50:54] then you'll never come to the revelation
[50:56] of what what he's done for you and once
[50:58] you forsake what he's done for you he's
[51:01] got you don't let the devil rob you of
[51:04] the joy of your
[51:06] salvation your the joy of your salvation
[51:09] comes from you believing he saved you if
[51:12] you didn't believe he saved you you
[51:14] couldn't be joyous there' be no reason
[51:16] to be
[51:21] joyous Jesus Christ is the high priest
[51:23] of your
[51:25] confession what you you speak what you
[51:28] say he moves on so if God gives you a
[51:32] moment in its Simplicity and say if you
[51:35] receive his word you receive
[51:37] him right then grab a hold of it don't
[51:42] wait till you get this person's got to
[51:44] lay hands on me no the word went forth
[51:46] the word spoke take a hold of it grab it
[51:50] then amen the prophet of God says in the
[51:53] sermon
[51:55] faith Works say faith Express paragraph
[51:58] 186 I want to tell you something now
[52:01] work on that pulsation that spur of A
[52:04] Moment Like Joshua did like Mary
[52:07] Magdalene all those just that moment
[52:09] when something is revealed to you grab
[52:11] it hold it that spur of a moment yes it
[52:15] was revealed to him he went to meet
[52:17] those thousand Philistines now what do
[52:19] you think when those Philistines said
[52:20] now look coming there that little shrimp
[52:23] only about 4ot and a half tall to begin
[52:25] with with seven little curls hanging
[52:27] down his back like Mama's Little
[52:29] see come along there with a Jawbone of a
[52:32] mule and look at us what a great Army we
[52:35] are isn't that ridiculous but what was
[52:38] he doing he was expressing to those
[52:40] Philistines what had been revealed to
[52:43] him by God he grabbed the Jawbone and
[52:45] took off because that's what he put in
[52:48] his hand he put that in his hand that's
[52:51] what he believed he could do it and by
[52:54] doing so he was expressing to those
[52:56] Philistines what God had put in his
[52:59] heart to do John the Baptist expressed
[53:01] his faith by his works and when he said
[53:04] there stands one among you now just
[53:06] think of that St John I got the
[53:08] scripture St John 126 see he said they
[53:11] said you say the Messiah is coming why
[53:15] he said man what's the matter with you
[53:17] we've been looking for him for a
[53:19] thousand years he said he's standing
[53:21] right among you now Hallelujah so is he
[53:24] tonight amen see so whatever need you
[53:27] came into this door with right now
[53:30] you've been told he is here tonight will
[53:33] you grab a hold of the moment and say
[53:36] Lord I've got this desire I've got this
[53:40] ask I've got this burden Lord take
[53:43] control right now if you hold to it you
[53:46] don't need nothing else but I believe
[53:49] amen I believe I believe I believe will
[53:52] do more for you than I've done a hundred
[53:54] prayers of hundred sermons I've done a
[53:57] hundred Good Deeds how many people did I
[53:58] pay lunch for okay I paid for a thousand
[53:59] people's lunches this year that's all
[54:02] good but if you don't have the belief in
[54:05] the word what good is the
[54:09] works I want us to I want us to hold
[54:11] this in our minds in in in this in this
[54:14] uh sermon works as Faith Express brother
[54:16] is describing because often times unless
[54:19] you you look deeper into a story you
[54:21] only
[54:23] catch I I I guess I would say what's
[54:25] presented to you but a prophet would
[54:27] come and then Enlighten you a bit more
[54:30] it always fascinates me that a prophet
[54:32] could say I can see Amos standing there
[54:35] with a white beard bald stroking through
[54:37] his beard like how did he see that I
[54:41] don't I don't read that when I read my
[54:43] Bible but when that Prophet is reading
[54:45] it and he's telling you I can see oh I
[54:47] wish I could see what he saw but you
[54:49] know he told me what he saw and he said
[54:52] that I was the sinless bought purchased
[54:55] bride of Jesus Christ
[54:56] there was no fault in me no mistake in
[54:59] Me God Don't Make Mistakes when he
[55:01] called you he gave you everything you
[55:03] needed to be able to fulfill the calling
[55:06] when he elected you it's not because you
[55:08] merited it he made you
[55:12] dust in this story brother bam would say
[55:15] that that Jawbone didn't lose a
[55:20] tooth now how many of you have broken a
[55:24] bone it's really not that hard to break
[55:26] break a bone with the right fall at the
[55:29] right time right angle it's not that
[55:32] hard people break bones all the time but
[55:35] you have to understand what he was
[55:36] fighting against the armor the
[55:38] Philistines had was one inch
[55:44] thick one inch thick this is what they
[55:47] taught us in school for an inch but I
[55:48] got bigger hands so I don't know but
[55:50] we'll call this an inch the armor was
[55:52] one inch thi and he's got this Jawbone
[55:55] and he SL La all those
[55:58] Philistines when a prophet says he
[56:02] grabbed the Jawbone because that's what
[56:05] he put in his hand what's been placed in
[56:08] your hand for a weapon you don't have a
[56:13] Jawbone what have you been given the
[56:15] greatest weapon God could ever give you
[56:18] his word how can you not do the same
[56:21] thing with every Philistine in your own
[56:23] life take the word slay him
[56:26] he didn't have one in armor he bows down
[56:30] to the word of Jesus Christ speak the
[56:32] word you've been given
[56:35] Authority the prophet of God says in the
[56:37] conflict between God and Satan now let
[56:39] me say something of you Christians down
[56:41] here don't you never stop one second for
[56:44] the devil paragraph
[56:45] 83 don't stop to reason it out when you
[56:49] start to reason it the Devil comes right
[56:52] in you cannot reason God you cannot
[56:57] understand God you've got to just
[56:59] believe God see I can't explain God
[57:03] nobody can I can explain many things but
[57:06] the only thing I just believe it because
[57:10] he said so now there's none of us can
[57:12] explain it don't try to explain it so
[57:17] when God gives you a revelation of
[57:19] something it doesn't matter what
[57:21] condition you find yourself in you could
[57:24] be indicted tomorrow for prison it
[57:27] didn't matter you know the circumstance
[57:29] you know what you're going through think
[57:30] of the most drastic one if the word said
[57:34] you're free don't explain how you'll
[57:36] become free amen just take what the word
[57:39] says and let God move what's imposs what
[57:43] to you seems like can't be done to God
[57:46] everything is possible it's always
[57:48] fascinated me the word impossible
[57:51] couldn't be spelled unless you had I am
[57:53] in the beginning of it so I yes
[57:56] impossible really means I am possible so
[57:59] if you've got the I am then all things
[58:01] are possible so what's impossible to you
[58:04] what's hard what's taking so much time
[58:08] you've got the word yes don't miss the
[58:11] moment grab a hold of it when God speaks
[58:15] something to you in your circumstance
[58:17] don't just wash it and say I've heard
[58:19] this before I've heard this before I've
[58:21] heard this before so what act amen
[58:25] imagine if Samuel when he was in there
[58:29] sleeping you call him Samuel Samuel
[58:32] imagine if he would have said you know
[58:33] I've heard this two times now it's been
[58:34] nothing I'm just going to leave it alone
[58:37] what would have
[58:38] happened he had to move he had to ask
[58:42] are you calling me he said I'm not
[58:44] calling you but the next time you hear
[58:46] that call you answer you say Lord here I
[58:50] am that's what we've been tasked it's
[58:53] not how many times you've heard the same
[58:55] thing over and over again well I've
[58:56] heard repentance preached 100 times well
[58:59] I've heard this preached this many times
[59:00] well I've heard this you take it every
[59:03] time it's preached it'll bless you the
[59:06] word is in season never out of season
[59:10] the only thing that's out of season is
[59:12] us we're the ones that think we're too
[59:14] good for a simple message oh I want I I
[59:17] give me the Mysteries give me something
[59:19] great but the ministry of forgiveness is
[59:22] so far forgotten of us do we not
[59:25] remember the sinful life we used to live
[59:28] the death we merited because of our
[59:31] Lives forgiveness is the least thing we
[59:34] want talked about we don't want to hear
[59:36] forgiveness then we got to do
[59:39] it we'd rather hear I'm a blessed people
[59:42] I've got power I've got strength I've
[59:43] got all this stuff but if you don't have
[59:47] love what do you
[59:51] have it's it's it's I
[59:53] I Lord I didn't want to go this way
[59:56] way forgiveness for the
[1:00:00] believer to me is an anchor am how can
[1:00:05] you go to God and repent and make things
[1:00:09] right when people come to you people do
[1:00:12] wrong to you and you're so set in your
[1:00:14] ways well if you don't come say sorry to
[1:00:16] me I'm just not going to accept
[1:00:18] it God forgave you before you committed
[1:00:21] the sin when was the sacrifice made
[1:00:24] before the foundation of the world
[1:00:26] how dare
[1:00:28] us to demand somebody to come and
[1:00:31] apologize to us he's done how many
[1:00:34] things wrong to me oh that brother just
[1:00:35] rubed me the wrong way he looks at me he
[1:00:38] said all these things about me man she
[1:00:40] just gossips every time I'm around her
[1:00:41] she says this every time I'm this see
[1:00:43] the identification of the devil was the
[1:00:45] accuser of the Brethren don't be caught
[1:00:48] with the same identification don't
[1:00:50] accuse the Brethren you're called to
[1:00:52] lift up the Brethren speak positivity
[1:00:55] Speak Life
[1:00:56] your words have power get the negative
[1:00:59] tongue out of your
[1:01:01] life speak only positivity people Harbor
[1:01:06] hurts for years and years and
[1:01:10] years and can't seem to move on to the
[1:01:13] level of
[1:01:14] forgiving to say Lord whether they ask
[1:01:16] it or not I've been waiting for years
[1:01:18] for them to apologize they haven't said
[1:01:20] anything nevertheless I forgive him Lord
[1:01:24] on my account remove it Lord I don't
[1:01:26] want them to be condemned for it I've
[1:01:28] settled it on their behalf when we get
[1:01:31] that kind of attitude in the church then
[1:01:34] somebody can walk in who does who may
[1:01:36] just not look like us we may just not
[1:01:38] like how they talk or how they present
[1:01:40] themselves but you've got the same love
[1:01:42] Christ had and you can forgive them
[1:01:45] where are your
[1:01:47] accusers they are none but we we've got
[1:01:52] accusations accusations I mean we've got
[1:01:55] list of
[1:01:58] accusations it's easy to forgive
[1:02:00] somebody for something that they've done
[1:02:03] we now need to learn to forgive and
[1:02:05] forget not to hold what has happened
[1:02:09] against them move on you heard it this
[1:02:13] weekend a Believer ought to be
[1:02:17] unbothered but we get bothered by
[1:02:20] everything the simplest thing well I
[1:02:23] think this water belongs here well the
[1:02:25] left side not a fan of it right side
[1:02:28] looks better and that will bother us so
[1:02:31] much to the point it changes our
[1:02:34] attitude it changes how we're just I'm
[1:02:36] just to to be mad
[1:02:37] today I want it
[1:02:39] here how old are we imagine how we look
[1:02:43] like it's like when your kids are
[1:02:44] arguing about a toy and you're like are
[1:02:47] you
[1:02:47] serious I could go buy you another one
[1:02:50] what are you arguing about but they
[1:02:51] don't want another one they want that
[1:02:53] toy you give them something else no they
[1:02:56] want that the moment the other kid wants
[1:02:58] the new toy now he says no I want that
[1:03:01] toy and the old toy loses its
[1:03:04] value what is happening to us what are
[1:03:07] we
[1:03:08] doing that we've gotten so
[1:03:12] low I I I I got to thinking on this with
[1:03:15] the power of
[1:03:16] confession when you wake up in the
[1:03:18] morning remember it's a moment
[1:03:20] everything is a moment when you wake up
[1:03:23] give God a moment amen when you go to
[1:03:26] sleep give him a moment find some time
[1:03:28] throughout the day give God a moment we
[1:03:30] wake up in the
[1:03:31] morning how many of has this happened to
[1:03:34] just this past week this happened to me
[1:03:37] we're not too big to admit we are needy
[1:03:41] people we need more of God in our life
[1:03:43] every single day I woke up and for some
[1:03:46] reason it was just going to be a bad
[1:03:51] day because I said
[1:03:54] so I had a moment moment and a chance to
[1:03:57] choose between having a good day and a
[1:03:59] bad day I spoke a bad day and somehow
[1:04:02] everything that happened was
[1:04:06] bad power of the tongue have you not
[1:04:09] been given the right to create your
[1:04:11] atmosphere speak what you will have you
[1:04:14] not been given thus sayeth the Lord and
[1:04:16] you're going to speak negativity I'm
[1:04:19] just going to have a bad day today what
[1:04:20] if you never have another bad day till
[1:04:22] the Rapture
[1:04:24] comes that's my heart's desire
[1:04:27] regardless of the circumstance I don't
[1:04:29] want no bad day none
[1:04:33] whatsoever oh but what happens when that
[1:04:35] devil just throws it on you that day
[1:04:38] when that person that always irritates
[1:04:40] you just does a little bit more than
[1:04:41] usual that
[1:04:43] day that employee you don't like the
[1:04:46] boss you don't like the person you're
[1:04:49] living with you don't like
[1:04:53] sometimes what happens then do you look
[1:04:56] on that and say I'm not going to bite
[1:04:59] I'm not taking that I'm going to apply
[1:05:01] the token in my home at my job
[1:05:03] everywhere that I'm at if there's
[1:05:05] somebody that's going to be happy it's
[1:05:06] going to be me if there's somebody
[1:05:08] that's going to be smiling it's going to
[1:05:09] be me if there's somebody that they
[1:05:11] won't understand why I'm always happy
[1:05:13] let it be me the prophet said a Believer
[1:05:15] should be the most joyous person on the
[1:05:18] earth where's your
[1:05:20] joy you're going to make a Rapture
[1:05:23] there's so much to be happy for
[1:05:26] don't choose to be sad don't choose to
[1:05:29] be depressed so oh so what that bill
[1:05:32] can't be
[1:05:35] paid I it eats at us and bothers us and
[1:05:38] it'll change our complete mood we don't
[1:05:40] want to talk to nobody we just want to
[1:05:42] be alone as if that's ever solved
[1:05:44] anything for
[1:05:46] anybody come to the house of the Lord
[1:05:50] sit down enter into the service and you
[1:05:53] watch if my God's Not faithful he said
[1:05:55] he' to be
[1:05:57] faithful and if he says something he's
[1:06:00] not in the business of taking back his
[1:06:02] word so we shouldn't be either if you
[1:06:05] speak under enthusiasm or excitement
[1:06:09] that I'm going to trust in God we hold
[1:06:11] yourself to that word and trust in him
[1:06:14] even if it's the last moment the last
[1:06:16] second hold to the faith hold to your
[1:06:20] confession never let your actions speak
[1:06:24] different from your confession don't say
[1:06:26] I'm this and walk that way no say what
[1:06:29] you will and walk in that path imagine
[1:06:32] if Abraham would have said well I
[1:06:34] believe I'm going to have a
[1:06:36] child and never got
[1:06:42] prepared what he would I'm
[1:06:46] I'm the red light will be right there
[1:06:49] there'll be two cars in front of you the
[1:06:52] right lane is open you have no business
[1:06:54] going to the right lane cuz you're
[1:06:56] turning left but somehow in your heart
[1:06:59] you say I can get there and speed up and
[1:07:01] pass these two slow and get in front of
[1:07:03] them and I can make that turn before
[1:07:04] them what are you rushing
[1:07:07] to where are you going fast
[1:07:12] nowhere I just today I got cut off
[1:07:16] driving here to church and the guy that
[1:07:18] cut me off was so mad he let me hear it
[1:07:20] with this horn y we met at the light
[1:07:25] what is it
[1:07:28] gained what's we'll be in
[1:07:31] line oh that's a long line man I don't
[1:07:35] want to wait in that
[1:07:36] line hey let me go and talk to that
[1:07:38] person let try to get let me see if I
[1:07:39] can cut if I can get in front these are
[1:07:43] small things but they add up to big
[1:07:46] things these small things are only a
[1:07:48] reflection of how we are with the
[1:07:50] kingdom of God the prophet said the
[1:07:52] nature types the spiritual if you can't
[1:07:55] wait on Simple Things how can you wait
[1:07:58] when God gives you a promise he's going
[1:08:00] to give you your son he's going to give
[1:08:02] you that spouse he's going to give you
[1:08:04] these things how can we expect to have
[1:08:07] the patience and the waiting for the
[1:08:08] great things if we can't have it for the
[1:08:11] Small
[1:08:12] Things Lord help us the prophet of God
[1:08:15] says in the com between God and
[1:08:17] Satan don't reason paragraph 87 don't
[1:08:21] reason don't try to reason it it hasn't
[1:08:24] got no reasonings you just believe it
[1:08:27] you don't reason a thing because
[1:08:29] remember the only way that you can
[1:08:31] accept God Is by faith not by reasons
[1:08:35] not by
[1:08:36] understanding not able not by
[1:08:40] understanding not able to explain you
[1:08:42] don't explain nothing you believe
[1:08:44] something not what you feel Jesus never
[1:08:47] said did you feel it he said did you
[1:08:49] believe it that's right you just believe
[1:08:52] what God Said I can't explain it to you
[1:08:55] how could the greatest miracle that I
[1:08:57] could think of is a man who just like
[1:09:00] take a pig and tell that pig you know
[1:09:02] you're no more a pig you're a lamb and
[1:09:05] he becomes a lamb see that would be hard
[1:09:08] to believe well it's the same thing
[1:09:10] takes place when you become converted
[1:09:12] from a sinner to a Christian see it
[1:09:14] changes your own opinions it changes
[1:09:17] your own will it changes everything
[1:09:19] that's in you and it brings you into
[1:09:21] another life and gives you another
[1:09:23] spirit that bears forth another record
[1:09:26] see then your old life has to die and
[1:09:30] the new one has to be born again and the
[1:09:34] blood and then see you're nor more the
[1:09:37] creature you was at all that's when you
[1:09:39] become behind the blood fortified with
[1:09:43] the word don't try to explain nothing
[1:09:45] just believe it and go on Lord I believe
[1:09:49] savior raise my faith in thee till it
[1:09:52] can move a mountain see Lord I believe
[1:09:54] for all my doubts are buried in the
[1:09:58] fountain all the devil tries to do is to
[1:10:02] get you to
[1:10:04] raisen get you to think you'll be in the
[1:10:07] midst of a situation in the midst of a
[1:10:10] moment rather than accepting what God's
[1:10:13] doing you'll take what the devil's
[1:10:15] putting in your
[1:10:17] ear we do this all the time a minister
[1:10:21] somebody will say it could it didn't
[1:10:23] have to be a minister
[1:10:25] you could be at work and the coworker
[1:10:27] says man are you feeling okay no I'm not
[1:10:31] well by his stripes you're healed I
[1:10:33] guess it's oh yeah you know he's not a
[1:10:35] Believer so I'm not going to take that
[1:10:36] anyway he like's what's he got to tell
[1:10:38] me what does he
[1:10:40] know don't disregard the vessel that
[1:10:43] gives the message truth stands alone
[1:10:45] regardless of who gives it if it's truth
[1:10:48] amen it doesn't matter who says
[1:10:51] it don't reason don't think just accept
[1:10:57] be in the moment our Prophet give us an
[1:11:00] example of what it looks like to be in a
[1:11:02] moment when he received the vision of
[1:11:05] the boy being raised in Finland he saw
[1:11:07] it beforehand when he saw the signs of
[1:11:11] that Vision now being manifested oh he
[1:11:14] said now it's just drama Hallelujah I
[1:11:17] can sit back this is going to meet its
[1:11:19] expected end because he saw it before
[1:11:23] now a prophet stands and says he saw you
[1:11:25] With Victory he saw you with power he
[1:11:28] saw you overcoming all things and rather
[1:11:31] than receiving what he told you you're
[1:11:33] now trying to understand how it'll be
[1:11:35] how can it come I've been struggling
[1:11:37] with this I've been fighting with that
[1:11:39] did a prophet not speak over you is he
[1:11:41] not the Seer for the age can he not see
[1:11:44] further than we can so if he spoke those
[1:11:47] things about you it's high time we took
[1:11:49] it and grabbed the moment and said Lord
[1:11:52] you said that about me that's me you you
[1:11:55] said that nothing could hold me that's
[1:11:57] me you said that I could overcome all
[1:12:00] things not some things all things that's
[1:12:02] me you said the spirit of lust gotten a
[1:12:05] hold on me that's me you said the spirit
[1:12:07] of Gossip got a hold of me no not no
[1:12:10] more that's me see the prophet of God in
[1:12:12] this sermon we talk he's talking about
[1:12:14] uh somebody will tell you well you
[1:12:16] believe in Divine Healing there's no
[1:12:17] such a thing and he said our response as
[1:12:19] a Believer should be not for you but for
[1:12:21] me there is go on they say oh I got the
[1:12:24] baptism on the H ghost what even is a
[1:12:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't
[1:12:27] believe in that not for you but for me
[1:12:28] there is go on we don't have to stop
[1:12:31] every time and reason with him and try
[1:12:33] to justify what we
[1:12:35] believe you're the believer you're
[1:12:38] called to believe it take it and walk
[1:12:40] with
[1:12:43] it the prophet of God says in a little
[1:12:46] bit lower in paragraph 94 in the same
[1:12:48] sermon the conflict between God and
[1:12:50] Satan now we find out Eve losing the
[1:12:52] battle she got from behind the word
[1:12:55] raised up on top of the trench and say
[1:12:57] you don't say so is that the truth she's
[1:13:00] lost right there see before that
[1:13:03] anything that the devil was saying the
[1:13:06] serpent would say she would say but we
[1:13:08] were
[1:13:09] told we were told we were told we
[1:13:12] shouldn't do this we shouldn't do this
[1:13:13] we should so the devil got
[1:13:16] slick and he presented her in a
[1:13:18] different
[1:13:19] way and rather than obtaining the same
[1:13:22] confession she had she responds you
[1:13:26] don't say so is that the truth see she
[1:13:31] questioned she's lost right there well
[1:13:34] you know we don't teach that over at our
[1:13:36] church we believe in what he said here
[1:13:39] yeah but listen dear you know better
[1:13:41] than that your own Common Sense would
[1:13:43] tell you that's not right why I heard
[1:13:45] them people just cry and cry what they
[1:13:48] crying about see now own Common Sense
[1:13:51] would show you that you're just worked
[1:13:53] up they're emotional see if you stop to
[1:13:56] listen to that you've lost the
[1:14:00] battle Lord help
[1:14:03] us he
[1:14:08] says if you're going to what the lord
[1:14:10] gave the promise and you can believe it
[1:14:14] it changes the whole program this is the
[1:14:17] power of a moment when God puts you in a
[1:14:20] moment in an opportunity I believe
[1:14:23] anytime you come into contact with the
[1:14:25] word it's a moment you have two options
[1:14:29] given to you I'm going to take what's
[1:14:31] being spoken to me and I'm going to live
[1:14:33] by it or I'm going to walk out worse
[1:14:35] than I came in that's not something I
[1:14:37] said that Prophet said you never come
[1:14:39] into His presence remaining the same you
[1:14:42] either leave Better or Worse we want to
[1:14:44] be on the side that leaves better so
[1:14:47] when God gives us a promise of something
[1:14:50] it's our task take it believe it it'll
[1:14:53] change the entire
[1:14:59] program I won't be much
[1:15:04] longer Satan has another tactic that he
[1:15:07] loves to
[1:15:08] do like he did with Jesus he'll bring to
[1:15:11] you
[1:15:13] scriptures to try to justify why that
[1:15:16] moment isn't for you well your heart
[1:15:19] condemns you so you can't pray yeah you
[1:15:22] this that's just not going to work for
[1:15:23] you man you yeah your conscience is
[1:15:26] against you that's not going to work
[1:15:28] well one John 20 tells me that if my
[1:15:32] heart condemns me that God is greater
[1:15:34] than my
[1:15:36] heart well if he's greater than my heart
[1:15:38] my heart no longer condemns me so
[1:15:40] whatever I have need of I can now ask I
[1:15:43] can boldly come before him and make my
[1:15:48] ask in Revelation 12 we see that the
[1:15:50] devil is the accuser of the brethen
[1:15:52] Brethren his sole desire is to call you
[1:15:56] by your sin in hopes you accept it then
[1:16:00] he can rob you of the joy of your
[1:16:02] salvation that's his sole tactic if God
[1:16:06] wants to bless you with something
[1:16:08] remember that thing you did yesterday
[1:16:11] you can't have that
[1:16:13] blessing you fell short of Grace
[1:16:15] yesterday it's not going to work yeah
[1:16:17] I'm
[1:16:19] sorry and we just in that moment we're
[1:16:21] about to grab it about to grab it he
[1:16:23] says that and we just H you know what
[1:16:24] you're right I I I can't get a hold of
[1:16:27] that that's that's That's too great for
[1:16:30] me I i' I've I've sinned too much my
[1:16:33] past is too bad I I can't grab a hold of
[1:16:36] that word it's it's it's a little bit
[1:16:39] higher than I can handle at the
[1:16:42] moment that's not what my Bible
[1:16:45] says my Bible says he called you elected
[1:16:49] predestinated you died for you before
[1:16:52] you ever committed a sin before you ever
[1:16:55] fell all the things you've done he knew
[1:16:58] you do yet he still thought you were
[1:17:01] worth dying for if that kind of a God
[1:17:05] can think that about you how much more
[1:17:08] you when you find yourself in that place
[1:17:10] where he gives you a promise and the
[1:17:12] Devil comes up you cast him down you say
[1:17:16] those things may be true in the flesh
[1:17:18] but we walk not after the flesh but we
[1:17:20] walk after the
[1:17:22] spirit you don't have to accept the
[1:17:26] other moment that God wants that Satan
[1:17:28] tries to give you take the moment God's
[1:17:31] wanting to give you accept his moments
[1:17:34] walk in his as we said before there's
[1:17:38] it's
[1:17:39] twins it's so close if you're not
[1:17:42] careful you'll miss it the story of the
[1:17:45] W of the woman that got delivered from
[1:17:47] dancing that got delivered from
[1:17:49] clubbing and here she's been given a
[1:17:52] moment she's walking by say well let me
[1:17:55] just pop my head in just for a moment
[1:17:58] just for a second just to see you know
[1:18:00] what she maybe she thought I'm going to
[1:18:01] testify to them I'm going to tell them
[1:18:04] what God's done for me don't be foolish
[1:18:07] don't go into the Devil's Playground
[1:18:09] thinking you won't come back with
[1:18:11] bruises I don't care how Holy Ghost
[1:18:13] filled you are you'll come back with
[1:18:16] bruises if you're not careful be very
[1:18:18] sober in everything that you do but in
[1:18:21] that story it fascinates me you've got
[1:18:23] two options there then he gives another
[1:18:25] story that's a parallel a brother that
[1:18:27] got saved from cigarettes and he buys
[1:18:30] him cigarettes and gives him the
[1:18:32] cigarettes and he doesn't smoke it but
[1:18:35] this in this story she receives
[1:18:37] deliverance from those things but she
[1:18:39] walks right back into the thing that got
[1:18:41] her there in the first place and she
[1:18:43] completely lost herself what about us
[1:18:47] when God wants to grant us a
[1:18:49] moment let's not miss it it'll take you
[1:18:53] further than you want to go going on
[1:18:56] that other side excuse
[1:19:01] me it'll take you further than you want
[1:19:04] to go if you take the other option but
[1:19:07] rather let's take the moment that lines
[1:19:09] up with the word let's accept a moment
[1:19:12] that is a echo of what it is we claim we
[1:19:21] believe I I I think
[1:19:25] I think it's good practice for the
[1:19:27] believer when the devil reminds you of
[1:19:30] your past of your mistakes of your
[1:19:35] failures and shortcomings right in that
[1:19:38] moment rather than wallowing and
[1:19:41] accepting it remind him of his
[1:19:44] future don't let him be the only one
[1:19:46] that gives reminders you ought to be
[1:19:48] following behind him everywhere he goes
[1:19:51] reminding him you may get me now but I
[1:19:54] got you
[1:19:55] there's something waiting you there's
[1:19:57] something waiting you for me oh there's
[1:19:59] a home in glory there's a mansion for me
[1:20:02] but for you you have an expected end
[1:20:04] it's been laid out in the Bible an
[1:20:07] everlasting fire you'll be burned in you
[1:20:09] with all those of your kingdom remind
[1:20:12] him for a change who he is that'll put
[1:20:15] him in his place it'll get you out of
[1:20:18] that circumstance where you're thinking
[1:20:20] negatively of yourself put him in his
[1:20:22] place and you're in the right place
[1:20:25] the problem is you put him at the same
[1:20:27] level as you he's not he wanted to be at
[1:20:31] the same level as you God said no God
[1:20:33] thought you were worth being at the same
[1:20:36] level as he is oh Lucifer how thou
[1:20:39] exalted itself you want to be amongst
[1:20:41] the
[1:20:42] stars but he was cast down but
[1:20:45] you where I am you may be also I go and
[1:20:50] prepare a place for you there's a
[1:20:52] mansion my father holds a house on a
[1:20:54] thousand Hills you've got all these
[1:20:56] promises in the city where the lamb is
[1:20:58] the light you'll sit and reign with him
[1:21:02] you are
[1:21:05] him don't allow him to have power in
[1:21:10] reminding you're the one that's called
[1:21:13] to remind him who you are know ye not
[1:21:18] that I am the Son of God do you not know
[1:21:21] that I'm a daughter of God
[1:21:25] mothers remind him on your knees the
[1:21:28] prophet of God says when a mother gets
[1:21:30] down to pray it's greater than any
[1:21:32] prayer of a minister of a
[1:21:35] pastor you've been given a certain power
[1:21:39] to get down and
[1:21:40] intercede utilize it remind him of the
[1:21:44] authority you've been given he has to
[1:21:47] back down when the words presented to
[1:21:49] him don't allow him to rob you of your
[1:21:53] moment don't miss the moment God could
[1:21:57] have given you his Spirit years
[1:22:00] ago and you misrepresented what he done
[1:22:04] for you and accepted what this devil
[1:22:07] said and you lose the thing he gave
[1:22:10] you don't never let him Rob that for
[1:22:17] you brother brandom says in this sermon
[1:22:24] coming to a close
[1:22:28] here the Seal of the
[1:22:30] Antichrist paragraph
[1:22:34] 27 I I want you to put yourself in the
[1:22:40] equation whether it's the holy ghost
[1:22:42] that you're struggling with or it's a
[1:22:44] promise God has given you place yourself
[1:22:47] in the
[1:22:48] story The Prophet said if you find
[1:22:51] yourself somewhere find a story that is
[1:22:54] your circumstance in the book and call
[1:22:57] upon the same God that moved in the
[1:22:59] story you read Because this is a living
[1:23:02] Bible it's not a dead Bible it's not
[1:23:06] just a book but there's life in it you
[1:23:10] can only draw life from it if you open
[1:23:14] it you can't draw life from it
[1:23:17] closed you have to open it and read eat
[1:23:24] then you
[1:23:25] become so whatever promise whatever it
[1:23:28] is your personal situation is tonight
[1:23:31] you know it I don't he knows you take
[1:23:35] this example that the prophet's going to
[1:23:37] deal with the young man about and you
[1:23:39] claim it for
[1:23:42] yourself he says a young man came to my
[1:23:44] house not long ago sat on a porch I felt
[1:23:48] sorry for him an old beat up Chevrolet
[1:23:51] truck and he said brother brandom I want
[1:23:53] to talk to you and I said all right what
[1:23:55] is it he said I come from Indianapolis
[1:23:58] he said and my wife went down to the
[1:24:00] church to the Pentecostal people and she
[1:24:02] got the spirit now I'll just say it the
[1:24:04] way he said it she got the spirit said
[1:24:08] we did go once in a while in a
[1:24:10] Presbyterian church and he said she got
[1:24:12] the spirit she was very happy she come
[1:24:15] home and told me all about it and wanted
[1:24:17] me to go down and get it and I said now
[1:24:19] look honey you go wherever you want to
[1:24:23] I'll work and make the living but I'm
[1:24:25] not the religious type he said you go
[1:24:27] anywhere you want to that'll be all
[1:24:30] right she said well you ought to come
[1:24:33] down and get happy with us said we have
[1:24:36] the greatest time and said she really
[1:24:39] was a changed person and said brother
[1:24:40] brandom said that went on for about two
[1:24:44] years we quit playing cards I didn't go
[1:24:47] out to the parties with her like I used
[1:24:49] to said everything stopped said I just
[1:24:51] come home she'd go to church and I'd sit
[1:24:54] around and read lead read a library book
[1:24:57] or go down to the lodge or something and
[1:24:59] said one day I'd made a cell in the car
[1:25:01] lot and I come in I put my cat on said
[1:25:05] it was summertime said I put my cat on
[1:25:07] to go out cuz some ladies out there said
[1:25:10] on the road back said I hung up my coat
[1:25:12] and when I did I said I wonder if I gave
[1:25:14] them the keys and I reached down in my
[1:25:17] pocket and I pulled out a little piece
[1:25:19] of paper and it had wrote on it where
[1:25:23] will you spend ET eternity said I just
[1:25:26] laid it down turned the fans on and said
[1:25:28] I picked it up again I couldn't get away
[1:25:31] from it where will you spend eternity oh
[1:25:34] when we first met this message when you
[1:25:37] first heard this message and you for
[1:25:39] some reason you just couldn't shake it
[1:25:42] you you it was the perfect moment for
[1:25:45] you to receive it because a lot of us
[1:25:48] was born in this message and from birth
[1:25:51] we heard and heard and heard and heard
[1:25:53] but one day day something happened was
[1:25:57] this ain't this is no longer Mom and
[1:25:58] Dad's message but this is
[1:26:01] mine there's something in here for
[1:26:04] me he
[1:26:06] said and said I'm 40 years old I got to
[1:26:09] settle that thing that's right I just
[1:26:12] had to turn that work over to someone
[1:26:14] else and went home to seek God said I
[1:26:17] went to a famous Minister well it's Mr
[1:26:20] Graham is who it was Billy Graham and
[1:26:22] said I went to this meeting and he said
[1:26:24] all that wants to receive Christ stand
[1:26:26] up well said that I did and he said
[1:26:30] except Christ now as your personal
[1:26:32] Savior and it'll be settled said I
[1:26:34] talked to some of the men there who told
[1:26:36] me that's what I had to do well said I
[1:26:39] did the best that I could but said
[1:26:41] brother
[1:26:42] Brandon it wasn't settled said I met up
[1:26:45] with some Nazarene people and said they
[1:26:47] taken me back in a room and told me
[1:26:49] unless I got happy enough to shout that
[1:26:51] I wasn't Sanctified yet and said I
[1:26:53] stayed in there and all all of us prayed
[1:26:54] together till it sounded like one person
[1:26:56] praying said I did get happy and shouted
[1:26:59] and said they told me it's all over now
[1:27:02] and said I thought it was then I went
[1:27:04] out and still it wasn't all over notice
[1:27:08] how he's describing it in the atmosphere
[1:27:11] then he went
[1:27:12] out I was in church these blessings were
[1:27:15] given to me all these things were told
[1:27:16] about me I accepted all of them but then
[1:27:18] I went
[1:27:19] out I want us to grab a hold of that
[1:27:22] said I sold all my car said I wasn't
[1:27:25] worth nearly a half a million dollars I
[1:27:27] sold my car a lot all of my cars said
[1:27:30] the only thing is God is just old beat
[1:27:33] up car trying to give it to preachers
[1:27:35] and so forth where I can find peace to
[1:27:38] my soul he said I want to find the Lord
[1:27:43] and he said then finally I finally run
[1:27:46] into the Pentecostal people they told me
[1:27:49] if i' asked them if I've ever spoken in
[1:27:51] tongues and told them no they said well
[1:27:53] you haven't got until you speak with
[1:27:55] tongues said they taken me back and
[1:27:57] prayed pretty half pretty near half the
[1:27:59] night in a little tent out behind the
[1:28:01] big tent and said then I spoke in
[1:28:03] tongues and they said now you've got it
[1:28:05] but said brother
[1:28:07] brandom I didn't have it and said then I
[1:28:10] went down the street Porter to Dallas to
[1:28:11] the voice of healing said they had all
[1:28:13] their boys up there and said they tried
[1:28:15] to do me good and they couldn't and said
[1:28:18] they told me you was a prophet to come
[1:28:21] see you and you tell me surely that I
[1:28:25] had crossed the separating line and
[1:28:27] there was no hope for me if I had done
[1:28:29] all this and still didn't have it and I
[1:28:34] said well brother I want to tell you
[1:28:36] something I said I'm not a prophet
[1:28:39] that's what people say but I said that I
[1:28:42] said I'm just his servant but now you
[1:28:46] don't need a prophet to straighten you
[1:28:52] out did we read the same thing
[1:28:54] you don't need a prophet to straighten
[1:28:57] you out you just need the word of
[1:29:00] God and I said what Mr Graham told you
[1:29:04] is the truth and what the Nazarene
[1:29:06] people told you is the truth and what
[1:29:08] the Pentecostal told you is the truth
[1:29:11] and yet it's not the
[1:29:13] truth and what the Pentecost is the
[1:29:15] truth and yet it's not the truth to
[1:29:16] shout to raise up your hands to speak
[1:29:19] with tongues is not receiving
[1:29:22] Christ receiving Christ is receiving the
[1:29:25] person of the Lord Jesus Christ then
[1:29:29] these other things take place after that
[1:29:32] now you could do all those
[1:29:35] things still didn't have Christ yet he
[1:29:38] said well brother brandom where can I
[1:29:40] find him I said I want to ask you
[1:29:43] something let's go back to your story
[1:29:47] and he walked up and said well what do
[1:29:48] you mean I said you said that that day
[1:29:52] when you come in pick the up that piece
[1:29:54] of paper something struck you and you
[1:29:58] said oh I want to seek God I said from
[1:30:02] up to that time you were going this way
[1:30:05] down the road and then you turned this
[1:30:08] way what did it I said what changed your
[1:30:12] opinion what come into your heart that
[1:30:15] made you one time not care for God and
[1:30:19] something come in to make you go to
[1:30:21] loving God what done it oh I love how
[1:30:24] our Prophet explains these things what
[1:30:27] done it he said well I don't know I said
[1:30:31] before the could be a creation there has
[1:30:34] to be a Creator to create the creation
[1:30:38] God came into your heart right there
[1:30:42] when you looked at that piece of paper
[1:30:44] he said you mean I've had it all along
[1:30:47] do you know what that'll do to somebody
[1:30:49] that's been looking for the Holy Ghost
[1:30:51] for years and years and years and years
[1:30:54] and then you hear a prophet say you've
[1:30:55] had it all along oh the joy you would
[1:30:58] have in that moment I tell you that's a
[1:31:01] reason to shout that's a reason to get
[1:31:03] excited because the word is it's a
[1:31:07] nature change I used to desire these
[1:31:10] things and want to walk these ways but
[1:31:13] all of a sudden for some reason I want
[1:31:16] to go this way you know I may stumble
[1:31:18] and fall I may make mistakes but I'm
[1:31:21] pressing towards this side of things I'm
[1:31:23] moving in this direction and anytime I
[1:31:27] don't like that rout I want to go here
[1:31:29] what's drawing you to that side this
[1:31:32] isn't happen chance this isn't an
[1:31:34] accident it's not your self-will your
[1:31:37] self-will would only get you to the
[1:31:39] border and it'll get too hot for you and
[1:31:41] you'll go back to where you're
[1:31:42] comfortable but when something pul the
[1:31:45] prophet tells him you never looked for
[1:31:47] God before this time that's right you
[1:31:50] didn't desire the things of God all of a
[1:31:52] sudden you now desire the things of God
[1:31:56] well let a prophet finish it he said
[1:31:59] before there could be a creation there
[1:32:01] has to be a Creator to create the
[1:32:03] creation God came into your heart right
[1:32:06] there when you looked at that piece of
[1:32:08] paper he said you mean I've had it all
[1:32:10] along I said certainly brother and he
[1:32:14] jumped out there and began to scream and
[1:32:16] cry that will settled what is it he said
[1:32:22] do you want to pray for me oh
[1:32:25] you just you were just told you have
[1:32:29] him do you want to pray for me brother
[1:32:32] brandom says what's the use of praying
[1:32:34] for
[1:32:35] you you don't need any prayer the truth
[1:32:39] has made you
[1:32:41] free how
[1:32:43] often is the word spoken over the pulpit
[1:32:47] on your specific
[1:32:49] situation rather than grabbing a hold of
[1:32:52] that moment saying this is mine you say
[1:32:55] I just need this person to pray for me
[1:32:56] and then I'll get
[1:32:57] it we're not significantly impressed by
[1:33:00] the word
[1:33:01] anymore we read here earlier up he said
[1:33:04] you don't need a prophet to straighten
[1:33:06] you out what you need is the word of God
[1:33:09] if the word says you got it you have no
[1:33:12] need of anything else that's the
[1:33:14] Breakthrough knowing that the word
[1:33:18] belongs to you what he said is yours
[1:33:22] it's not that person that this no it's a
[1:33:25] personal revelation it's to you but you
[1:33:28] have to grab it you got to get a hold of
[1:33:32] it what's the use of praying for you you
[1:33:36] don't need any prayer the truth has made
[1:33:38] you free see oh
[1:33:42] Hallelujah if the musicians would
[1:33:45] come it it it just moved on my heart
[1:33:49] heavy to want to understand why I always
[1:33:54] miss
[1:33:56] moments why I can never seem to catch
[1:33:59] what God's trying to do for me in the
[1:34:02] instance in which he's doing it and I
[1:34:04] came to the conclusion it's because I'm
[1:34:06] not impressed by the
[1:34:09] word I'd rather something else than that
[1:34:13] word then I found a problem in my
[1:34:16] members that problem was if the word no
[1:34:20] longer had the final say what did
[1:34:24] Faith's final resting place is on the
[1:34:27] word of God everything comes back to the
[1:34:30] word everything dovetails to the word
[1:34:33] salvation word healing word Deliverance
[1:34:37] word everything comes back to the word
[1:34:42] so if I've got the word I have no need
[1:34:45] of anything else I can be at peace
[1:34:49] knowing you've given me the greatest
[1:34:51] weapon ever known to man and at time
[1:34:53] bomb a hydrogen bomb has got nothing on
[1:34:57] that word of God you could drop an
[1:35:00] atomic bomb in this building if God said
[1:35:03] we would all be untouched don't phase by
[1:35:07] what science says that bomb does it's
[1:35:10] the separation of atams and then it
[1:35:11] creates an explosion and it
[1:35:12] disintegrates you in its instance you
[1:35:15] can't be disintegrated you're an eternal
[1:35:17] being the prophet of God said if I die
[1:35:21] don't say I died I didn't die
[1:35:24] I'm living eternally you just don't see
[1:35:26] me but I'm somewhere
[1:35:28] else that's our promise as Sons and
[1:35:32] Daughters of god let's not miss
[1:35:35] moments let's be in the moments when the
[1:35:39] word says something let's get used to
[1:35:42] grabbing a hold of what the word says
[1:35:45] and not let go let's be like Jacob I'm
[1:35:49] not letting you go till you give me a
[1:35:51] blessing
[1:35:53] right now not because I say it because
[1:35:57] the word says it if you had enough Faith
[1:36:00] whatever problem you walked into that
[1:36:02] door with you wouldn't leave with it but
[1:36:04] it's according to your faith if you
[1:36:07] believe that God will move on that word
[1:36:09] it'll do it for you don't question it
[1:36:12] don't think about it you say right now I
[1:36:15] heard what God Said my condition is
[1:36:17] tough I don't understand it how am I
[1:36:19] going to get out of it Lord you didn't
[1:36:21] call me to understand it when I get out
[1:36:23] of that door I'll be
[1:36:25] different all circumstances are changed
[1:36:28] he said it's a program changing
[1:36:31] moment every service is a program
[1:36:34] changing moment don't be in the habit of
[1:36:37] missing service now you're in a
[1:36:40] different moment when you're not here
[1:36:42] you don't want to be in that moment that
[1:36:45] only has one end the prophet say a
[1:36:47] believer's places in the house of the
[1:36:49] Lord come diligently every time their
[1:36:52] doors are open you watch God move on

[1:49:55] people take they build upon excitement
[1:49:59] they call it a moment they buildt upon
[1:50:02] shouting upon screaming and they went
[1:50:04] and the meeting was so exciting
[1:50:06] energetic and they they and that
[1:50:08] foundation will never last don't build
[1:50:11] upon what's happening out there build
[1:50:13] upon What's Happening Here what did the
[1:50:16] word say to you what is it that touched
[1:50:18] your heart I I love that he said he
[1:50:21] looked at that piece of paper
[1:50:23] he couldn't get away from it am but he
[1:50:25] missed the moment to realize that that's
[1:50:27] when it happened oh
[1:50:30] God we we we come to church you know
[1:50:33] sometimes and I love it because people
[1:50:36] come in and say well it's another
[1:50:37] Wednesday it's another Sunday it's
[1:50:39] another Wednesday no these are moments
[1:50:43] these are time where you never know the
[1:50:46] water will may be moving in the spirit
[1:50:48] will strike and you receive what you've
[1:50:50] been praying for it's moment we have to
[1:50:53] to have an attitude and an open heart to
[1:50:56] say God I'm hearing the word just strike
[1:50:58] my heart and let let I I I may not hear
[1:51:01] everything that said but I just want
[1:51:03] something to strike my
[1:51:05] heart and not begin to be it become
[1:51:08] something that starts right there that
[1:51:10] can build up to whatever God wants to do
[1:51:13] we don't want to miss moments we don't
[1:51:15] want to get into the habit and just you
[1:51:18] know you see everything that's going
[1:51:20] wrong oh that song we didn't sing it
[1:51:22] right we didn't do this by doing that
[1:51:25] you are missing at the
[1:51:29] moment uh that really spoke to my heart
[1:51:33] that really stuck my heart I said God I
[1:51:35] don't ever want to get caught in
[1:51:37] anything except your word and once you
[1:51:40] speak it as simple as it is I'm taking
[1:51:43] it no matter what because once I take it
[1:51:47] I'm giving you something that you can
[1:51:49] come and magnify amen
[1:51:54] let's not miss it let's be careful let's
[1:51:57] be reverent let's be let's pour

[1:52:01] kind of mindset let's let's be the they
[1:52:04] have the right attitude the right
[1:52:06] everything so that when the word is
[1:52:08] spoken it's landing on the ground that's
[1:52:11] been prepared because you never know
[1:52:13] when that moment is when the word is
[1:52:15] speaking because remember the scripture
[1:52:18] says an entrance will be ministered unto
[1:52:20] you it's an entrance that God has given
[1:52:23] us that we can get into the kingdom that
[1:52:26] we can have access into that Kingdom but
[1:52:29] if we miss it because we are distracted
[1:52:31] because how many how many messages am I
[1:52:34] receiving and oh I hear a baby cry over
[1:52:36] here and I saw that one
[1:52:38] move enter into the moment and let God
[1:52:43] make that moment a reality that's the
[1:52:46] desires of my heart tonight I so enjoyed
[1:52:49] it I I just I just feel like this is the
[1:52:52] time of meaning I could just shout and
[1:52:54] scream Hallelujah because I felt like
[1:52:57] that's the kind of moment I'm looking
[1:52:59] for God don't let me miss it don't let
[1:53:01] me go from now on missing it because I'm
[1:53:05] distracted I'm thinking about what's
[1:53:06] going to happen after service about that
[1:53:08] about no let me just focus and
[1:53:11] concentrate and know that it's in a
[1:53:13] still Small Voice sometimes it's even
