something keeps holding me God bless [Music] you uh J I'm not a preacher I wanted to just give a testimony a testimony the testimony of my life how that God has used me in this message of the end [Music] time uh this testimony we'll have about six different parts I'm going to speak about my youth I grew up in a family I I was a um oring [Music] child um in that family I didn't get a chance to know my mom [Music] we're going to pray [Music] yeah celest Heavenly [Music] Father we thank you so much for this opportunity you've given us you are our God you worked with the prophet in this same [Music] time you also worked with Believers in this end time we ask that you may come on the scene at this [Music] moment we also ask that the testimony will give let it be a blessing for your children [Music] let it not be something someone will glorify himself but this is to prove that you are alive and well bless each and every one of [Music] us bless your children who are [Music] sick we asking the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] amen have your seats as I started to say I'm not a preacher I'm just a a a child of God a Believers like you to stand here to speak it's not given to everybody it's a grace of God as you can see I'm not a preacher I don't know the the procedures but I'm a Child of God I can say something what I want to say to you is a testimony that God can use anybody when we believe through the message of the end [Music] time we didn't have the mindset of trying to verify everything or check everything in on the internet it was something that we found that we could hold we could hold on to it was our last hope we didn't have hope in the world we are we were not born in Rich families or families that were known among men personally myself when I was young when I was going to the primary school I didn't even have clothes uh Society didn't accept me because I was very skinny even the family under which I was leaving I was really not looked at as the child of that family that means the message to me was something that gave me hope it it transformed me I didn't have any other preoccupation as others do all I did was to pray God because because I had found comfort in the message that's why I believe the message of William Bram uh uh back then when we found the message we will go and print it out we will print it out in many copies and we will give it to brothers and we will uh give it out to brothers and everything that the prophet will say will say Amen to it even if we didn't understand what he was saying we'll just say Amen to it examp as an example the the the one of the messages that attracted me to the message was who's this who's this MC it's it's a it's a really message that's very difficult to understand we believed it because we when we saw the pillar of fire we knew that it was God as I was saying the from my youth I was really a child who was rejected from society when we found the message we found out it was something that I could really hang on to that's why God really used us because we didn't have time to go verify to check whether it was true or not I grew up in religion such as I was Baptist but if you look at what was happening in the choir or the preacher it was terrible things there was friendship or between the the I guess dating between people in the choir it was contrary to the word of God that's why when we found the message of the hour we found something that we could hang on to deeply now for that reason we never had to verify or even doubt upon the message and that was the reason why God used [Music] us I will try to just take few points because every all the things that God has done in my life they are amazing things that even myself could not understand I'll start with my youth I I grew up as an orphan in a big family we were about nine I was very skinning when it was time to eat it was the the strongest who would eat the most when I'll try to put my hand into the bowl others will hold my hand and they will try to pinch me I was asking why the were my brothers I didn't understand now at the age of 12 that's when I started to try to understand what was going on I would come back from primary school it was about 1 100 p.m. 1:30 p.m. okay so where I live they would build houses with uh they would put like trees and then they'll put uh uh bricks in between and then they'll put cement uh on top the one I was calling my sister he was really not my sister but we were going together in a family yeah she asked me if I can go and and fetch some water it was a distance about six 7 Kil and at the age of 11 imagine a little child a little kid with a a gallon uh 20 lers uh uh uh container right and I said at this time I said I just came from school I am hungry can you give me something to eat before I go fetch water they were cooking beans she took spoon of beans she put in a in a a small bow and she gave me she told me to go and get water when I went out of the house the one who was supposed to be my father he had a hammer in his hand he thought that I stole the beans and he took the hammer and he hit me in the head and here there's a there's a scar and there was blood spilling I ran when I ran I felt like my head was about to fall off at that time I didn't know the message I I ran into the bush I felt like my head was about to fall off I I had a a long uh black T-shirt and I tried to to cover it I felt like my heart was about to get out of my chest where I went to hide and I said it was about 1:30 p.m I fall and I fall I I dropped and then I fall asleep that's when the Lord came and talked to me I was not a Christian when he came and visited me it was as if I was in a dream they came three of them the three people the one I could call uh the the the doctor he started working on my wounds I really loved school I I already I I was already feeling like my head was about to fall off I said that means I will never go to school when the doctor came those three were Angels one had a a plate they had like a plate in his hand like a serving plate the other he had like cartons of things to to try to take away the blood and the one that I would call the doctor he started to touch me on the shoulder like a good doctor he said and yeah I was what was amazing he knew what what I was thinking because at that moment I was thinking that here I am I wouldn't be able to go to school and he started telling me don't be afraid you're going to go to school and you're going to be very smart and I said how is it possible because when I touch my head I feel like it's it's split in two he said I'll be with you no no I said no I'm not going back home because the one I thought was my father who did this to me is going to kill me he said this I will be with you I will protect you and you're going to go to school and you will you will succeed he started to to give me love like a good doctor what what really touched me was his hand when he touched me with his hand I felt the [Music] peace I felt something I cannot explain and from that time that person has always been with me because when I went back home he gave me this Spirit of [Music] forgiveness the the the the person that I thought was a father who G who hit me with a hammer I I I I felt the the part of my the forgiveness was automatic but the the grandmother who taking care of me I say that because I started to try to investigate if they wanted to split or or to divorce because at that time the one I was calling Mom it started telling him you know that my daughter passed away and he and and she left behind this child how can you beat the child to this point that's when I understood that I was not his child but I was his his daughter's child then from that time the man that I called the doctor he started revealing to me a lot of things I could see in the family who who was uh who had witchcraft even in the village if someone had witchcraft I could I when I go to sleep I can see that in the vision the one that I was calling my older brother it was a it was a very U brutal man when we went to school with him he was uh he would uh take stones and throw away at Mary stature because at the time they home in Africa that the the Catholic Church they built statute of Mary and all of the uh uh Crossroad points where there's traffic light they placed different statues at different places until now they have those even now and I I would tell him the one I was I would call my older brother I'll said I saw the the Witchcraft of someone I saw it at such tree and we're going to go there because it was very brutal and we're going to try to remove those trees and we're going to find it and that brought me a lot of trouble in the the place I was living in but the man who said that I'll be with you he was always protecting me I was not vulnerable to uh Witchcraft and that's what it caused all of those people that were practicing it to find out who who I really was I didn't know the message of the hour at that time and then we'll get to the second Point how did I get to the message of the hour in 1998 1988 89 uh they were doing um they were they trying to identify everybody uh we were selected as young people of the the location I was living in who knew how to read and write and we were able to identify people we were we were doing a competition of signatures I I wanted to have a signature that was the most complicated than all than everybody I had a friend whose mom was selling bananas and and peanuts in schools he had a the message that we call who's this MDC and I saw the signature of of the Prophet I said this is a good signature that no one can imitate that's how I believe the message I took the message I read the first verse when brother Bram was praying that prayer it captured me I memorized it when I would go to church when they asked me to pray I would pray like brother Bram was praying and when I would say keep us under the blood of Jesus that was it wasn't something that was said in Baptist Churches the blood of Jesus they had no understanding of what that means and I wanted to know who that person was I I imitated his signature that's how I came to to know what the message of the Y was I was I was going to school with a brother [Music] I will keep his identity because he works with the army of in cono is someone great in the Army in Congo yeah so going back the man who told me that I the one I called Doctor Who told me you will be smart I was I I studying commercial things and administration there was uh no one able to to complete the accounting exam but I was able to do it when I would try to give answers to my schoolmate that brother that person would not allow me I asked him why you don't teach in cheat in school that everyone in school they knew that if I gave them an answer that they were going to pass but that Brier would not let me do that I wanted to know why I asked him a question I said everyone in this class they take the answers that I give them why you don't want to take it and but him he if he if he would take for him to give his paper back blank he would do it he told me that he was a Christian I'm a Christian I told him aren't we all Christians he said I believe the message of Bram I remember the the the message that I had come in contact with because it was written William Marian brandham and I asked him I said I want to know where you go to church at he invited me to church I went to church when I got into the church oh my goodness it's an atmosphere that I never felt in any other church at that time when you get into the church as a sinner the the deacons you could be easily found it was it was very fearful that's why I loved the message and now there there was no day that the church was gathering that I will miss uh back home in Africa we were meeting on Wednesday on Thursday and Friday it was an occupation we continue to gather together everything that the prophet will say we will say Amen even if we didn't understand it we will say Amen we never argue the message of the Prophet even if it was difficult we will say because the prophet said it we accept it we will understand later that's how God started to work with us because Us in Africa when we pray God we go to to our knees and we can pray God 30 to 40 minutes that's how God used us it wasn't because we were smart or we had something special but it was that way I will get on the third section third part I'll get on the fourth part how that God protected us against Witchcraft and the Witchcraft it was a member of the family because when I believe the message of BR Bram my whole family they say that this child is enter into the uh uh magician religion every because everybody was Catholic it was the the family religion if you were to be a Baptist that was acceptable but the message of William Bram you could not you shouldn't touch it they kicked me out of the house I didn't have clothes I have probably two shorts they put it in the bag and they threw it go go go on those to those churches that you go the Church of magicians so when we preach here we say the seed of of God when you have the seed of God there's nothing that can stop you I went I felt like even though I was being kicked out at the house but I had the message I continue to believe through the message of brand my brothers with the love of Brothers they took me in their house I grew up [Music] there correct and I I became a Christian I'm not pretending to be the best Christians but I was my my life was correct it was a life that was different from other kids because when I look behind all all of the generations the older brothers the one I called the older brothers they they entered into [Music] criminality others were thieves they they they they behave they behaved themselves in the worst way possible but I was a very humble child because of this message that's how God kept me until 1994 I continue to believe the message there was a genocide in Rwanda yeah that place I'm going to try to to to to U watch what I disclose yes because the genocide that took place in Rwanda in 1994 it it wasn't because the tribe was hating each other it was in international politics it was it was manipulated by great International communities and at that time what I did to to save children it was not of My Own Strength it was the strength of God I was able to infiltrate the camp of the enemy I saved about 175 kids they were they were kids of soldiers and that almost cost me my life because when the the general realized that they were missing about 175 kids he wanted to know who did it among those that are called children it was kids uh between 9 and 17 years old among those children there was one who had a friend and the girl was not allowed to to cross the border because she was uh she was from Rhonda she started crying she said she said said they took my husband and it was that girl who who told them about me and then he said that it's me who did all of this and the general paid $3,000 in in in 1995 it was about a lot of money 96 it was a lot of money it was a lot of money he gave it to soldiers he said I want you to find me this man uh uh [Music] LLY this Doctor Who told me that I'll be with you he was telling me what was happening in the other Camp I could see things when I went when I go to sleep I could see things play out they sent a lot of soldiers to come find me I I ran I tried to run I they they couldn't find they couldn't see me but I know I was thinking they could see me I was wondering how how is it possible that I went by that road that that way but they didn't see me it was a lot of soldiers they they couldn't find me so I ran to the other side and I went to stay in the camp in the uh refugee camp and they continue to try to find me and the Lord told me he said take the take the phone I called him because I could even see his phone number I called him I said I told him I said I know you paid $3,000 to find me but now I know where you live I know address I could tell him his address I could tell him the road where he was living he was very terrified to see that he was looking for me and now I'm telling him that I'm going to I'm going to come find him where he lives he was so terrified that night he's a he was a general he ran away he ran away that night and he went to another place I I I I didn't have any ability to do him anything but I just used that tactic it's God who gave me that tactic and that at that time I understood that our God is a mighty God he can do all things he can use anybody he can use you only if you commit yourself in his hands you you you keep yourself you keep yourself from sin God can use you even the little child now I'm going to get to where how did I get to the US I'm trying to summarize certain things because at that time I was the the the most wanted man but they were not able to find me where I went to hide in the camp I continue to pray I continue to pray I told God I I can't it's hard for me to continue to hide every time I feel like I'm tired is there no way for you to save me from this circumstance I started to go pray up the mountain it was a very dangerous place it's a place where the genocide took place in a in in a great numbers a certain morning I went to pray I was praying in the cave it was from uh uh 5:30 till uh uh 400 p.m. people were looking for me in the camp they thought that I was killed because my my my my my my children they were saying that our dad went to pray but he's not come back and the people mobilized themselves so they can look for me when I was coming they started screaming they didn't know where how where I was now everybody knew that I was going to pray over there there was a a woman who was praying in the camp she was a Pentecostal they have this uh the gift of Prophecy or Vision uh she called me she told me do you know that where you go to pray there's a lion who lives in that cave I said I didn't know he said if you will see him and until that time I had not seen a lion maybe I've I've seen them just in the book every day I went to pray I would think oh I'll see the lion today and I was getting ready to see the lion and I went for about 3 weeks I didn't see anything and a certain morning it was about 5:30 in the morning it was still dark I was going up the hill the mountain The Voice told me look I Look to the side I didn't see anything I didn't know look what even what that meant I continued when I got to a certain place I I smell it was like a smell of blood I looked about uh six M where the benches I saw something laying under the mountain it was a lion I was standing here and the lion was right there I couldn't run back and I couldn't continue to walk because the lion in The Village every time the lion came to the Village the whole village will run away but I I stood there I was so terrified [Music] but I had this belief this Faith because I knew I came to the mountain to pray I just said Lord Lord God protect me uh save me I stood there and I looked at the lion face to face the lion looked at me I looked at him I saw the lion come out and he turned around and he went away I continue my way when I got to the m to the top of the mountain I started praying When you pray if you have not gotten out of your own body you don't know how to pray I prayed that day I prayed I I didn't even know what time it was I was looking I would see my own body on the knees it it's like I was I was floating in the air and I was looking at my own body I I got into the the unction I prayed I prayed I prayed when I got out of there I had a a a a telephone I opened my phone I saw Miss calls un the unac United na High commission for Refugee United Nation High commission for Refuge the the uncr started calling me from the morning until that time they told me that I was selected that so that I could be uh uh displaced and and put and sent to Finland I told them I don't want to go to Finland I wanted to go to the US because I wanted to come see the graveyard of BR that's the reason why I came here but people told me in the camp you you are crazy when they select someone to go to Europe it's Joy but you refuse to go to Finland I said I didn't want to go to Finland I wanted to go to the US so I can visit uh brother bram's tomb they changed the decision it's to tell you this God he can answer at the desires of your heart if you are you are honest with yourself and with God he changed that I came to the US I am in the US when I came to the US I didn't have a way to travel and go to Jeffersonville I don't know how God arranged everything the same woman who told me about the lion being in the uh uh where I was going to pray she was also brought it here in United States she lives here in Texas she called me we we know that you you you you prayed a lot when we were in the camp we want you to come here and to to help us start the work of God I came here in Texas but the one who believe this [Music] message it's hard for you to go and gather with him people because everything that we preach there it's the it's Baby's food I Tred to find the message I found this church I came here in 2016 I I I used to sit on the back benches there the sixth B come Brother David and when Brother David was here preaching the voice was telling me he said look look at brother brandham I looked at Brother David I saw in him the image of brother Bram I I'm I forgive me if I sound like a fanatic I that's how I saw it if you have not seen it yet I don't know I saw in him the image of brother Bram I I'm just telling you few things that really touch me in life but there's a lot of things that God showed me brother when I saw Brother David when I when I saw the image of Brother David the image of brother Bram through Brother David I when I saw the image of brother brandham through Brother David I told my family we have to move to Texas Women's uh excuse the expression sometimes their faith could be based on material things we were so blessed here the one who was my wife at the time she didn't want to move because we we had so we were we were so blessed she refused she said no I won't move any PL I don't want to move she gave a lot of [Music] reasons but the thing that attracted me the most is was the the the the vision to see the the image of brother bam me Brother David I I I I forgot about it I I forgot about the church I said now I have to go back to [Music] Africa but because there was a lot of people that needed my help because there were there was a lot of offerings over there and I said I could help them that's how I went back when I would sleep I would finish in this I had a dream I had a dream about this church that's being built here I saw it I saw the dimensions I saw that it was a church with balcony I I told God what if I what if I to with that church why are you showing me this I'm not a member of that church why are you showing me this church uh miraculously I find myself here working in the church that I never imagine could imagine it would happen Brother David is my witness the first day when we when we got into the building I asked him a question why did you build a small church he looked at me he didn't answer it I I I realized that I offended him because it's a great work that he's doing I probably should have congratulated him but when I was looking at him in the eyes ashamed I was feeling ashamed but now there's about a month or two he he said here the phone call that he's getting a lot of phone calls from different side of the country that he built a small church so I felt my heart
