[14:41] as a special if he could come at this
[14:42] time amen amen it's good to have him
[14:45] back in his family I know they traveled
[14:47] to Nigeria uh for the funeral so it's
[14:49] certainly glad that they're back
[14:58] amen God bless you
[15:00] Church um please uh if you can spare me
[15:03] just five minutes to give this testimony
[15:06] uh like you were saying I I went for my
[15:09] father-in-law's funeral um it's been a
[15:12] long time since I've been back there
[15:14] almost 13 years um and um when that
[15:18] happened you know this year has been a
[15:20] good year I don't want to say any other
[15:22] thing than that I have to be optimistic
[15:24] about it um and so when it happened and
[15:27] we had to go for the funeral
[15:30] uh a whole lot of things started
[15:32] happening you know people will talk
[15:35] dreams prophecies um I think my African
[15:38] Brothers will will brothers and sisters
[15:40] will know how it is back home it's no
[15:43] different in America but you know
[15:45] there's some other things that you have
[15:46] to be careful about and so a whole lot
[15:49] of things started coming in friends
[15:51] would say please do this please don't do
[15:53] that please don't do this and so it
[15:55] started creating fear in my mind and I'm
[15:58] going with every body I mean my mom my
[16:01] my my my kids my wife um so that put a
[16:04] lot of stress and burden on me um daily
[16:08] I we hear people even people back home
[16:09] would call me and say I had this dream
[16:11] and that that that I was like okay
[16:13] there's a problem uh and and so in my
[16:16] mind I just sat down and said okay what
[16:18] do I need to do I just went to God and
[16:20] talk to God about it and there's only
[16:24] one thing I asked him I said oh Lord I
[16:26] want to go with every single one of my
[16:29] family and I want to come back with
[16:30] every single one of my family the same
[16:32] way that I took them there I want to
[16:33] bring them back the same way and that's
[16:35] the thing that I asked them yeah I slept
[16:37] I had a dream I'll grant you your wish I
[16:40] was like okay it looks so when everybody
[16:43] keep kept on talking after that I just
[16:44] didn't listen my goal was I was going to
[16:47] take them there and bring them back well
[16:49] the day arrived that I was supposed to
[16:50] go two almost 2 three hours I got to the
[16:53] airport before my flight well they
[16:55] looked at my flight itinerary and
[16:57] whatnot and said oh you came in late you
[17:00] cannot travel I was like this is weird
[17:03] they had to delay me for two days they
[17:05] sent me back home with a whole lot of
[17:06] loads and whatnot they was like go back
[17:08] home I went back home I stayed home for
[17:11] two days when I got back home they
[17:13] called me I have uh I call them my sons
[17:15] they're my brother-in-law but here
[17:17] they're my they're my sons um and when I
[17:20] got home they called me American Airline
[17:22] called me and said well I'm sorry one of
[17:24] your son is not going to be able to
[17:25] travel I was like why and they said his
[17:27] passport expired
[17:29] uh but what I understood was even if his
[17:32] passport expired it could still travel
[17:34] because Nigeria will accept an expired
[17:36] passport but the thing is when you get
[17:38] back home you have to renew it before
[17:39] you leave the country I try to explain
[17:42] my way through it but they wouldn't
[17:43] accept me um my wife was like okay he's
[17:46] not going to go he's he's going to be
[17:48] the only one that will stay at home out
[17:50] of eight of us so one person I was like
[17:53] now could that couldn't sit well with me
[17:54] I went back to what I asked God I said I
[17:56] said I was going to go with everybody
[17:57] and I was going to come back with
[17:59] everybody and that same day I just kept
[18:01] on calling I wouldn't sleep I just kept
[18:03] on calling every single Airline every
[18:04] one of them kept on telling me the same
[18:06] thing no he cannot travel and at some
[18:08] point in time I just sat down prayed
[18:11] again called the same airline that I've
[18:13] called previously and I said well he's
[18:15] got to travel he's a Nigerian he just
[18:17] got to go and they were like yes I was
[18:19] like no you kidding me I just called you

[34:12] thanks amen sister Martha has a special
[34:16] amen if she could come at this time
[34:37] God bless
[34:39] you um I was GNA I had originally
[34:43] planned to come up here and share a
[34:45] little testimony before I sang um and
[34:49] then I got a little bit discouraged but
[34:52] then when brother Mark David came up
[34:54] here and he gave his testimony it gave
[34:56] me some encouragement so I'm going to
[34:59] share
[35:01] um earlier at work this week um I had a
[35:06] client I I'm a caregiver so um I went to
[35:10] a client's
[35:11] home and um when I arrived I found him
[35:16] in bed his wife had told me he hadn't
[35:19] eaten all
[35:20] day um he was very weak his vitals were
[35:26] out of whack when I took them and um
[35:30] quite frankly I thought he was going to
[35:31] die that day um he also thought he was
[35:36] going to die and so you know I'm sitting
[35:41] in there with him I'm taking my vitals
[35:43] writing notes down and he starts telling
[35:46] me um the hospice group that he belongs
[35:50] to which family members to call and
[35:52] stuff um in the event that he does pass
[35:55] away and uh
[35:58] um I looked at him and I was like um Mr
[36:02] Fernandez you're not going to die today
[36:05] and he just kind of looked at
[36:07] me um in confusion a little bit he was
[36:11] real out of breath his oxygen levels
[36:13] were really low so he and he lost a lot
[36:15] of color he looked like um a dying man
[36:20] and I thought to myself I could pray for
[36:22] him and um God could heal
[36:25] him um but then the devil starts talking
[36:30] and he's like um you haven't lived the
[36:33] best life and you know just discouraging
[36:36] and stuff but then um I remembered I was
[36:40] listening to the church and its
[36:43] condition and um I'm going to
[36:48] read the
[36:50] first few paragraphs paragraph 11 12 and
[36:55] 13
[36:59] um and brother random says and remember
[37:02] the word is God God is no more than his
[37:06] word and we're no more than our word and
[37:09] if we make course now you and I in a
[37:13] different stance since we both can we
[37:15] can say oh I'll do a certain thing we
[37:18] mean that in our heart but circumstances
[37:21] can arise that we can't we can't do that
[37:25] what we said we would do but God can't
[37:27] do do that because he's infinite and he
[37:29] knows everything and everything that
[37:32] ever was will be or so he can't make a
[37:35] statement L he knows he can back it up
[37:39] and Abraham when he was 100 years old he
[37:42] called those things which are not as
[37:44] though they were now I'm saying this as
[37:47] encouragement to those that's going to
[37:49] be prayed for the sick Abraham called
[37:52] the things that were not as though they
[37:53] were counting that he who made the
[37:56] promise was was able to perform or keep
[37:59] that which he had promised now when God
[38:02] told Abraham when he was
[38:05] 675 and Sarah was
[38:07] 65 that they were going to have a baby
[38:11] why it was altogether impossible and he
[38:14] believed that and looked for the baby
[38:16] and counted the baby as good as being
[38:18] there for 25 years before the baby ever
[38:21] came and Abraham was 100 when the baby
[38:24] was born and Sarah was 90 because he
[38:26] believed him
[38:28] and he called the things which are not
[38:29] as though they were now that to the sick
[38:33] and Afflicted to be prayed for no matter
[38:36] what your troubles are whether you're
[38:39] what kind of disease you got how bad off
[38:42] you are when you accept Christ his word
[38:45] then you call the things which are as
[38:47] though they were not if they're contrary
[38:50] to God's word now God said prayer of
[38:53] faith shall save the sick well if God
[38:56] said that that settles it it then let's
[38:58] put our mind's hopes and act as though
[39:00] it's already done that's just already
[39:03] finished when we accept it so I
[39:05] remembered that quote and um I prayed
[39:09] for
[39:10] him and um a couple hours later he was
[39:15] up and he was moving and he was eating
[39:18] and I didn't see him a couple of days
[39:20] after but um when I went back on Friday
[39:23] I found him in good condition walking
[39:25] around joking around with his family and
[39:28] so I wanted to thank God for
[39:30] [Applause]
[39:39] [Music]
[39:46] that sometimes I
[39:50] Fall to my knees and
[39:53] [Music]

[47:46] something is holding
[47:48] us that we're in the palm of your hand
[47:51] and nothing can pluck us from it father
[47:55] that you promis that if you started the
[47:58] work in us that you would finish it
[48:01] though we get discouraged and we look at
[48:03] our lives
[48:06] and and we feel that we might be a
[48:09] failure and that it doesn't seem like
[48:12] we're going
[48:13] anywhere but yet
[48:16] father you have it all planned out
[48:19] for and you said you wouldn't lose a one
[48:23] and you have a time and a purpose for
[48:25] everything
[48:27] and father we just ask this morning that
[48:29] we can trust in that that our hearts
[48:32] would be lifted up that we could find
[48:36] ourselves in your word and find your
[48:40] word in us we ask you to bless each need
[48:43] this morning each person each problem
[48:47] father there's nothing impossible for
[48:49] our God we ask you to bless us now this
[48:52] morning in jesus' precious and wonderful
[48:56] name we pray pray amen amen as you're
[49:00] turning in your Bibles to the Romans the
[49:02] 8th chapter uh I'd just like to make a
[49:06] just a couple of announcements uh uh so
[49:10] we're we're trying to uh keep the a fore
[49:15] U as free as possible uh uh for of
[49:21] Safety and Security reasons so after
[49:24] service if you'd like to visit and
[49:26] fellow Fellowship uh just go down the
[49:28] hall out of the forer into the
[49:31] fellowship hall and you can visit in
[49:34] there and uh so just feel free to move
[49:37] your fellowship into the fellowship hall
[49:40] I think that's why we call it the
[49:42] fellowship hall it's not the fellowship
[49:45] for year it's the fellowship hall so
[49:49] please go there and and fellowship there
[49:51] and also we we would uh ask you that you
[49:55] don't sit in the four here during
[49:57] service so uh I know that children
[50:01] nowadays are restless and uh and that's
[50:06] because of the technology today kids are
[50:10] have grown up looking at a tablet or a
[50:13] phone or uh you know you see parents
[50:17] take their kids out to eat and their
[50:19] kids are and they don't they have
[50:21] electronic
[50:23] babysitters but uh we don't uh we don't
[50:27] uh believe in electronic babysitters we
[50:30] believe that uh spare the rod and lose
[50:34] the child so you got to train your
[50:37] children to sit in church and uh so uh
[50:41] don't sit in the for year and so if your
[50:45] you have to take your child out uh give
[50:48] it what it wants and then give it what
[50:50] it needs and then bring them back into
[50:53] church okay so we want to do that and
[50:57] also uh we have
[50:59] Construction in the uh back here in the
[51:03] back we're still working I you can see
[51:06] the forers coming together back there
[51:09] and the uh uh uh Pavilion so uh just be
[51:15] careful there's construction material
[51:18] and all that so uh we just try to be
[51:21] careful there so let's turn in Romans
[51:24] and uh just have a little bible
[51:27] uh time this morning in the
[51:29] scriptures and uh we're going to read
[51:31] several
[51:32] scriptures in the Book of Romans so uh
[51:36] we're just going to uh read one and then
[51:39] sit down and just have a little bible uh
[51:42] fellowship and go through the scripture
[51:45] and then share our thought with you this
[51:48] morning
[51:50] amen uh let's read Romans 8 And1
[51:58] I'm sure we all all love that it's good
[52:01] to have the fry hose with us this
[52:03] morning uh congratulating Lucy now she
[52:07] can look after me and take care of me
[52:10] check my blood pressure and make sure
[52:12] I'm doing good he says but if the spirit
[52:15] of him that raised up Jesus from the
[52:20] dead dwell in you he that raised up
[52:25] Christ from the dead dead shall also
[52:28] Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit
[52:33] that dwelleth in you therefore brethren
[52:38] we are debtors not to the flesh to live
[52:43] after the flesh for if we live after the
[52:46] flesh you shall die but if you through
[52:50] the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the
[52:54] body ye shall live
[52:57] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[53:01] God they are the sons of God for we have
[53:07] not received the spirit of bondage again
[53:10] to fear but ye have received the spirit
[53:14] of adoption whereby we cry ABA father
[53:19] the spirit itself bearing witness with
[53:22] our spirit that we are the children
[53:27] of God and if children then join heirs
[53:32] Heirs of God and Joint HS with Christ if
[53:36] so be that we suffer with him we shall
[53:40] also be
[53:41] glorified together for I reckon that the
[53:45] suffering of this present time are not
[53:48] worthy to be compared with the glory
[53:51] which we shall be revealed in us our
[53:55] heavenly father we ask you to bless the
[53:58] scriptures to us this morning in Jesus
[54:01] precious name we pray amen God bless you
[54:04] may be
[54:14] seated I I love these uh scriptures in
[54:18] Romans and we'll just uh uh take a
[54:21] moment and just read down uh together
[54:24] again uh some more scripture as we were
[54:27] reading and so it it says here he says
[54:31] for the earnest
[54:33] expectation of
[54:35] creation waiteth for the
[54:38] manifestation of the sons of
[54:42] God now that just think of that great
[54:45] thing that that you know sometimes we
[54:48] think we're all alone or we're not part
[54:50] of something but whole
[54:54] creation is is
[54:56] has its place and Paul will go on to
[54:59] explain how even creation itself is in
[55:03] bondage and and it's waiting for the
[55:08] manifestation of the sons of God and
[55:11] every time it talks about sons of God
[55:14] sisters don't think that just means the
[55:16] brothers and you can get away with
[55:18] murder you know it it means all of us
[55:21] that we're all the Sons and Daughters of
[55:24] God we're all God's Offspring and so uh
[55:28] uh it and being that creation knows that
[55:33] and it's waiting for this
[55:37] manifestation of the sons of God for for
[55:40] them to be made known and and it there's
[55:44] a difference between being made known
[55:46] and being manifested and we're just
[55:49] going to try to share a small thought
[55:51] with you this
[55:52] morning
[55:54] uh I don't know if this is too
[55:58] close I I I'm getting a lot of ring and
[56:01] it says uh it says for the creatures was
[56:05] made subject to vanity not
[56:09] willingly but by reason of him who have
[56:12] subjected the same in
[56:15] Hope because the creature it itself also
[56:20] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[56:24] corruption into the glorious Liberty of
[56:29] the children of
[56:31] God now you notice the these these
[56:35] things are tying together how it's he's
[56:39] talking about the children of God that
[56:42] we might know uh that we're the children
[56:45] of
[56:46] God would just think of the peace that
[56:49] that brings and what it is that God's
[56:53] Desiring uh for us and and we we we find
[56:58] out that we're born in sin shap in
[57:00] iniquity we come into the world speaking
[57:02] lies the flesh Wars against the spirit
[57:06] the spirit against the flesh you you you
[57:09] have full knowledge of all the things
[57:12] that you've done wrong all the things
[57:15] you think all the things you say and and
[57:19] so when you do an analysis of
[57:22] yourself you come up with one conclusion
[57:28] sinner you know what I mean and uh but
[57:33] yet he he stands back and he says well
[57:36] well you were yet a sinner I died for
[57:40] you I purchased you so your
[57:43] righteousness wasn't part of the picture
[57:47] so we want to kind of redraw uh redraw
[57:51] our approach this morning of how that we
[57:54] want to go forward how we want to go
[57:56] forward in our lives how we want to live
[57:58] our lives of what it is in our hearts
[58:02] that we want to accomplish and the
[58:05] fellowship that God wants to bring us
[58:08] into with him because one of the reasons
[58:12] that we were created in the first place
[58:14] that God might have Fellowship he wanted
[58:17] to share himself he wanted to have
[58:20] Fellowship he wanted to have preeminence
[58:22] he wanted to reveal himself and he
[58:25] wanted to take take us back to where we
[58:27] were in the beginning so you know he he
[58:31] didn't just uh uh uh excuse
[58:35] me he didn't just uh put us down here
[58:40] like little mice in a maze and say
[58:43] figure it
[58:44] out and uh if you get through the Maze
[58:48] and everything good for you and if you
[58:50] don't uh you'll perish that was never
[58:53] his intention in the first place
[58:57] but his intention was to have fellowship
[59:01] with you and and because of of when when
[59:06] Adam and Eve fell the whole world came
[59:10] subject to their sin they went through
[59:13] the cycle of life and
[59:15] death they they when winter came they
[59:19] went through the cycle they died their
[59:22] fruit was taken and so they're they're
[59:25] into a bondage and and I can't sit here
[59:29] and say that whether I know that
[59:33] uh whether plants have feelings or or or
[59:37] this and I know people talk to plants
[59:39] and they grow you know what I mean and
[59:42] and and other people they do everything
[59:44] and the plant dies you know I'm not
[59:47] trying to say I got know anything about
[59:49] a psychic connection or anything like
[59:52] that but the scripture says that when we
[59:55] came fell and came into the bondage they
[59:57] did
[1:00:00] also you you know what I mean so they
[1:00:02] left they left the condition that they
[1:00:06] were in the same as we did so you know
[1:00:11] with God it's all tied together because
[1:00:14] it's all within the framework of the
[1:00:17] father he is he's the Creator and maker
[1:00:20] of all things and everything fith and
[1:00:24] jointhe
[1:00:26] it and it's it's it's all perfect you
[1:00:29] know what I'm saying and and uh I'm sure
[1:00:33] that uh the father is longing for the
[1:00:36] day that he can restore everything back
[1:00:40] to the way that it is that he will
[1:00:43] cleanse all the sin off of this Earth
[1:00:45] and and tear down all the scars that man
[1:00:49] has put on it and bring it back to its
[1:00:53] uh natural beauty again so there's a
[1:00:57] great anticipation not only in uh our
[1:01:01] hearts and our lives but in creation
[1:01:05] itself and and I wish I could explain
[1:01:08] that I wish I could tap into that more
[1:01:12] you you know and I know there's
[1:01:14] religions that try to tap into the
[1:01:17] energy of the world and and they have
[1:01:20] these little pyramids you go sit in and
[1:01:23] and and if you cross your legs just
[1:01:26] right and put your hands up just right
[1:01:28] you get get some kind of uh energy you
[1:01:32] know what I mean I'm glad I don't have
[1:01:34] to rely on that I'm glad I have the
[1:01:36] spirit of God to give us energy you know
[1:01:40] what I mean so that they they know that
[1:01:43] there's something out there that holds
[1:01:46] it all together they they they
[1:01:49] understand there's uh Body Energy
[1:01:51] there's whole uh religions and medical
[1:01:55] Sciences where they take needles and
[1:01:57] they stick them all over your body you
[1:02:00] know what I mean and I always thought
[1:02:02] they stuck those needles cuz if you get
[1:02:04] stuck by enough needles what hurt you
[1:02:07] before doesn't hurt you anymore you know
[1:02:10] it it shrinks in your memory but they
[1:02:13] they they they have a word for it I'm
[1:02:16] not sure I have the word right I think
[1:02:18] it's called Kai or something like that
[1:02:21] they believe that that gets your body's
[1:02:23] energy flowing and through you and and
[1:02:28] there's people that believe that if you
[1:02:30] put your body in a certain forms you
[1:02:33] know and they they contort and they they
[1:02:36] call it yoga or or or or some they do
[1:02:40] some dances you know what I mean
[1:02:43] and
[1:02:46] and and and you know and they think wow
[1:02:49] you know now they're in
[1:02:51] Harmony and in peace and so what I'm
[1:02:54] just trying to point out there couldn't
[1:02:56] be such an effort towards something if
[1:02:59] there wasn't something in there that
[1:03:02] they they're trying to
[1:03:05] unlock but just think by the grace of
[1:03:08] God those who walk after the spirit and
[1:03:11] not after the
[1:03:13] flesh the they found the
[1:03:17] secret do you understand to really what
[1:03:21] that they're looking for they're
[1:03:23] searching what they're searching through
[1:03:25] is through a carnal mind they're
[1:03:28] searching for the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:30] Spirit where God's spirit connects again
[1:03:35] with
[1:03:36] man and that's what it says if the same
[1:03:39] spirit that dwelt in Jesus Christ that
[1:03:42] was the spirit of God come down veiled
[1:03:45] in flesh connecting with man and showing
[1:03:49] man that there's a God that has power
[1:03:52] over all Heaven and Earth
[1:03:55] and no wonder Jesus said if you had the
[1:03:58] faith you could say to this mountain and
[1:04:00] be moved or this tree be plucked up and
[1:04:03] planted and so here's all kinds of
[1:04:05] faiths and all kinds of religions and
[1:04:08] all kinds of Sciences looking for really
[1:04:11] what is the basis of all Christianity
[1:04:15] which is the union of God's spirit and
[1:04:18] man's Spirit through the blood of Jesus
[1:04:21] Christ coming together and man coming
[1:04:24] together again the price of sin being
[1:04:28] paid for by the blood of the lamb and
[1:04:31] now God through that blood by his own
[1:04:36] justification can allow his Spirit to
[1:04:40] make contact with your spirit and you
[1:04:44] don't have to do anything
[1:04:46] amen but
[1:04:49] believe amen and accept
[1:04:52] it so so uh we we we there's a
[1:04:59] reality in the fact that the the
[1:05:01] scripture goes on if we read that let us
[1:05:04] just read on it says
[1:05:09] uh for the earnest expectation of
[1:05:12] creation waiteth for the manifestation
[1:05:15] of the sons of God for the creature was
[1:05:18] made subject to vanity not willingly but
[1:05:21] by reason of him who hath subjected the
[1:05:24] same in Hope because the creature itself
[1:05:28] also shall be
[1:05:30] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[1:05:33] un the Glorious Liberty of the children
[1:05:36] of God for we know the whole creation
[1:05:39] granth and travaileth in pain together
[1:05:43] until
[1:05:47] now you
[1:05:49] know when you start seeing your part in
[1:05:52] everything you're not as insignificant
[1:05:54] as Satan would make make you out to
[1:05:58] be you are a part of a a a a beautiful
[1:06:05] plan of God and nobody can take your
[1:06:11] place nobody can take to take your spot
[1:06:14] you've got a a spot to play in it you've
[1:06:17] got a a role that that that is your
[1:06:22] place that you must participate in to
[1:06:26] make it all work our our messenger talks
[1:06:29] about the fine watch and how sometimes
[1:06:32] it's the smallest spring or the smallest
[1:06:35] gear or the smallest wheel that that
[1:06:38] whole clock is depending on and without
[1:06:42] that part of it it won't keep perfect
[1:06:45] time and without your part it it it
[1:06:49] won't keep perfect time and and what the
[1:06:52] gospel is trying to do is trying to
[1:06:54] encourage to you to uh if I could use
[1:06:58] this expression forgive me if it's wrong
[1:07:00] but to get into the
[1:07:03] game you know to get into the
[1:07:06] program to find your position and your
[1:07:10] place that that the significant part
[1:07:14] that you play will be
[1:07:17] played and the scripture encourage us is
[1:07:20] don't compare yourself with somebody
[1:07:23] else only fools compare themselves eles
[1:07:26] one to another so you've got to find
[1:07:29] that place in your life that you're
[1:07:35] participating in the Eternal plan of
[1:07:39] God and that's where we want to move to
[1:07:43] because uh we we don't want to be an
[1:07:46] educated church we don't want to be a
[1:07:50] church that's built on the knowledge uh
[1:07:54] of things only
[1:07:56] and just that our doctrines are right
[1:07:59] and our baptisms are right and and all
[1:08:02] and these things all right but we want
[1:08:04] to move on to a
[1:08:06] [Music]
[1:08:08] Perfection and so uh if there if the
[1:08:12] world's
[1:08:13] groaning and
[1:08:16] travailing for the
[1:08:18] manifestation of the sons of God then I
[1:08:22] think we can place ourselves and
[1:08:24] understand that that the the scripture
[1:08:27] even speaking of it wants to manifest
[1:08:31] the Sons and Daughters of God he wants
[1:08:34] the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus
[1:08:37] to be in
[1:08:40] us and not in the form of
[1:08:45] religion religion's a
[1:08:47] covering religion's a veil so what we
[1:08:51] what we end up doing is we end up taking
[1:08:54] Church
[1:08:56] and religion and our teachings and we
[1:08:59] wrap ourselves in it and and it becomes
[1:09:03] like a suit and we say well you've got a
[1:09:06] very fine suit
[1:09:08] on you got a nice suit a nice tie you
[1:09:12] know your shirt started you you you
[1:09:15] really look
[1:09:16] good and the outside looks
[1:09:20] good you know what I mean but we we
[1:09:23] don't want the inside to be rotten and
[1:09:27] God doesn't work from the outside in he
[1:09:29] works from the inside
[1:09:31] out so he he's trying to deal with our
[1:09:35] hearts he's trying to deal with what's
[1:09:38] in our spirit uh and he he wants to have
[1:09:42] fellowship with that and so it's not a
[1:09:46] covering that we're after we're after
[1:09:50] that
[1:09:51] Wellspring of Living Water that spring
[1:09:56] up within us that that we know that we
[1:10:01] are the children of
[1:10:05] God as Paul he as he he he said here for
[1:10:11] the spirit itself Bears witness with our
[1:10:15] spirit that we are the children of
[1:10:20] God so what does he give you his spirit
[1:10:23] for
[1:10:27] he gives us his
[1:10:29] spirit that it'll bear witness with our
[1:10:34] spirit what happened the first time you
[1:10:36] heard the gospel the first time you
[1:10:39] heard the gospel there was something in
[1:10:41] you that we call a
[1:10:44] seed or a part of God that God put in
[1:10:48] you uh that something in you that you
[1:10:52] didn't have in your mind but you had in
[1:10:55] your spirit that when you heard the
[1:10:58] gospel it it quickened in you it
[1:11:00] identified in you it it brought you
[1:11:03] under conviction it it opened your eyes
[1:11:06] you felt some form of contact from
[1:11:10] something super natural to your
[1:11:16] nature but it wasn't your carnal nature
[1:11:19] or your sinful nature it was contacting
[1:11:23] it was contacting the part of life that
[1:11:26] God had in
[1:11:28] you and all of a sudden you felt oh that
[1:11:31] convicts me or that's true or you went
[1:11:34] home and you pondered it out and you
[1:11:36] studied it and and and it it it made an
[1:11:40] effect on
[1:11:41] you and that's because God wants to have
[1:11:44] that Fellowship to he he's wanting us to
[1:11:47] come to the place that we have
[1:11:52] confidence that we're the sons and and
[1:11:56] Daughters of God and I thought that's
[1:11:59] why the enemy tried to fear Martha away
[1:12:02] from giving that
[1:12:05] testimony
[1:12:08] because she she prayed and that prayer
[1:12:11] produced a
[1:12:13] result and we'll move into that
[1:12:16] thought look he says that he says and
[1:12:21] not only they but ourselves
[1:12:27] not only they but ourselves also which
[1:12:33] have the first fruits of the spirit even
[1:12:37] we ourselves grown within ourselves
[1:12:40] waiting for the adoption to with the
[1:12:43] Redemption of our
[1:12:47] body for we are saved by
[1:12:52] hope but hope that is seen is not hope
[1:12:57] for what man seeth why does he yet hope
[1:13:00] for
[1:13:03] it now isn't really if we just take a
[1:13:06] moment what are we all waiting for the
[1:13:12] Rapture right we're all
[1:13:15] hoping right for the Rapture we're
[1:13:19] hoping it comes tomorrow we're hoping it
[1:13:21] comes the next day okay slowly but
[1:13:25] surely all of us are realizing this
[1:13:28] world doesn't have anything for
[1:13:32] us you know and and and you know all the
[1:13:36] people that all of a sudden they think
[1:13:39] they're they're they're so excited that
[1:13:42] oh we got a new president and the
[1:13:44] world's going to be better no it's
[1:13:50] not it might go down the tubes a little
[1:13:53] slower but it's going down the
[1:14:00] tubes it just it it just changes its
[1:14:08] mask I I mean it it's it and
[1:14:13] remember the love of money is the root
[1:14:18] of all
[1:14:22] evil and and money is able to buy things
[1:14:28] money's able to do
[1:14:31] things and and the corruption behind it
[1:14:35] is
[1:14:37] is
[1:14:39] unspeakable how people change their
[1:14:42] morals for a
[1:14:44] dollar they change friendships over
[1:14:47] money people are jealous over money
[1:14:51] money's it's it it the love of of money
[1:14:56] produces more things when you hear
[1:15:00] someone stand up and say let's make
[1:15:02] America wealthy
[1:15:05] again and you say oh boy more
[1:15:10] money oh boy more
[1:15:14] sin more root of evil in my
[1:15:19] life you know less
[1:15:21] sacrifice less
[1:15:23] giving you know it it'd be real good if
[1:15:27] we all ran out of food for about a week
[1:15:30] and we could learn to fast and
[1:15:32] pray huh wouldn't it be tell me how much
[1:15:36] you'd be on your knees if you didn't
[1:15:39] have a next meal so and what happens is
[1:15:42] are we going to put our
[1:15:44] hope in a president are we going to put
[1:15:47] our hope in our
[1:15:49] country can you so you maybe you got one
[1:15:52] political thing and you think a
[1:15:54] everything's better well there's people
[1:15:56] of another persuasion that thinks
[1:15:58] everything's
[1:16:02] worse I'll tell you I'm I'm glad I'm
[1:16:06] counting on one thing and that's the
[1:16:09] prophecy of God's
[1:16:12] word my hope is built in nothing less
[1:16:16] than Jesus Christ and his
[1:16:20] righteousness that's what we're built
[1:16:23] in that that that's what that's what
[1:16:25] we're seeking after that's what we want
[1:16:29] in our lives that's what we want our
[1:16:31] contact to be that if the that that we
[1:16:36] our total
[1:16:37] hope and our our total rest is for as
[1:16:42] many as are led by the spirit of God
[1:16:45] they are the sons of God that that's
[1:16:50] what our hope
[1:16:53] is our hope is in the leadership of the
[1:16:58] spirit of God in our
[1:17:02] lives don't let life just push you down
[1:17:07] the
[1:17:09] road don't don't let
[1:17:11] circumstances uh unfold and just because
[1:17:15] they unfold in a certain way uh just
[1:17:18] because something happens or there's a
[1:17:20] change in your
[1:17:22] life that doesn't mean that God's done
[1:17:25] with you or he won't lead you or he
[1:17:28] don't have something else for
[1:17:31] you sometimes we have to go beyond the
[1:17:34] camp sometime we just can't set up our
[1:17:37] our get our lives in such a place where
[1:17:40] we're in such a routine and everything
[1:17:43] is just is so uh uh uh ordered for us
[1:17:48] that we we only wait for the uh
[1:17:53] leadership of the Spirit when we come
[1:17:55] into some form of desperation and so now
[1:17:59] we're we're looking for answers and not
[1:18:02] leadership we're looking for solution
[1:18:05] and not leadership we're looking for
[1:18:08] Relief and not leadership but the real
[1:18:11] children of God the real sons and
[1:18:14] daughters of God are led by the spirit
[1:18:17] of God so he give you his spirit I will
[1:18:21] not leave you comfortless but I'll come
[1:18:23] again and I'll send you the comforter
[1:18:26] and he shall lead you and guide you into
[1:18:29] all truth and
[1:18:33] righteousness so what we are this
[1:18:36] morning is we're a body of Believers led
[1:18:40] by the spirit of
[1:18:42] God and Our Gospel is if you haven't
[1:18:46] received the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:49] then check and see for the formula have
[1:18:52] you repented of your sins
[1:18:55] have you been baptized in the name of
[1:18:57] the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:19:00] of those
[1:19:03] sins you say well what's the remission
[1:19:05] of sins the water's not going to wash
[1:19:07] the sins off you but along with it comes
[1:19:10] the Revelation that those sins are
[1:19:13] forgiven by the blood of the
[1:19:18] Lamb you know you've done the
[1:19:22] formula you know your sins are forgiven
[1:19:26] given and you don't have to keep
[1:19:28] confessing your sins over and over again
[1:19:30] that's how the Catholic Church makes a
[1:19:35] fortune go confess your
[1:19:39] sin confess your sin go in there and
[1:19:41] confess your sin again and again and
[1:19:43] again and again oh Father I've sinned
[1:19:48] these are my
[1:19:49] sins and you think he says well you know
[1:19:53] something if you go be baptized in the
[1:19:56] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:19:58] receive the Holy Ghost there be no
[1:20:00] desire in you for
[1:20:04] sin you wouldn't be beating yourself
[1:20:07] trying to do penants for the the the
[1:20:10] flesh the scripture just told us if you
[1:20:12] you bring your flesh under
[1:20:15] subjection you know your flesh Wars
[1:20:17] against your spirit you know your
[1:20:20] natural tendencies and and that's where
[1:20:22] sin starts it starts in youres FH and
[1:20:25] every man's drawn away by by the spirit
[1:20:28] of Lust by it it draws him
[1:20:31] away and it starts in your mind but you
[1:20:33] don't want it to go to where it's
[1:20:35] conceived and then Pro produces the
[1:20:38] fruit of sin but if you do sin and you
[1:20:42] confess your sin he's faithful and just
[1:20:44] to forgive
[1:20:47] you but you don't want to remain in that
[1:20:50] cycle you can come above that cycle
[1:20:55] and you come above that cycle is when
[1:20:58] you start placing your life into the
[1:21:01] leadership of the Holy Spirit and you
[1:21:04] sit down and you pray for that
[1:21:06] leadership you set yourself aside for
[1:21:09] that leadership you get into the place
[1:21:11] where you're looking for that leadership
[1:21:14] you're looking that your spirit's right
[1:21:16] you're looking that your attitude right
[1:21:19] you cleanse Yourself by the washing of
[1:21:21] the water of the word of God huah
[1:21:26] and you
[1:21:27] participate in
[1:21:33] Christianity Christianity is a way of
[1:21:41] life if I could say it like
[1:21:44] this and I I just say this not to be
[1:21:47] funny or a joke but to to to let it
[1:21:50] understand when a person files of
[1:21:53] follows a DI
[1:21:55] diet that diet becomes the way of life
[1:21:58] for
[1:22:00] them I man a man he's on the carnivore
[1:22:05] diet all he does is eat
[1:22:11] meat it's all he
[1:22:13] does meat meat meat
[1:22:16] meat would you have for breakfast steak
[1:22:20] what do you have lunch steak what do you
[1:22:23] have for dinner Mar
[1:22:26] steak well it's a way of
[1:22:31] life and there's vegetarian diets and
[1:22:34] there's there's this type of diet and
[1:22:37] that type of
[1:22:38] diet and what is a diet it's something
[1:22:41] that controls what you're eating because
[1:22:43] of what you're eating has the effect on
[1:22:46] on your body well the natural typees the
[1:22:49] spiritual how about get into a spiritual
[1:22:52] diet amen
[1:22:56] a a spiritual
[1:22:58] lifestyle a
[1:23:00] spiritual uh a a a spiritual uh
[1:23:06] pattern as the scripture says lay for
[1:23:08] yourself a pattern of good work show
[1:23:10] yourself to be approved study that you
[1:23:13] might show yourself to be
[1:23:17] approved so it it's a
[1:23:21] participation of the believer it's not
[1:23:24] sitting back and saying we
[1:23:26] believe that Malachi 45 came that God
[1:23:30] sent a pillar of fire
[1:23:32] and and and that's the Fulfillment of
[1:23:36] these
[1:23:40] scriptures what that Ministry came for
[1:23:42] was to restore us back to the life
[1:23:47] pattern of our fathers to the
[1:23:51] diet of our fathers to to the
[1:23:54] revelations of our fathers that's why we
[1:23:58] pray for Revelation more than anything
[1:24:00] else pray for Revelation if I to ask the
[1:24:03] question this morning not being a critic
[1:24:06] but as your pastor wanting the best
[1:24:08] things for your life and I said how many
[1:24:10] of you last week prayed for
[1:24:22] Revelation well how does God
[1:24:25] lead he leads by
[1:24:29] Revelation he leads by revealing
[1:24:33] himself if we have a man-made pattern of
[1:24:36] righteousness that's
[1:24:39] religion and if you get a certain amount
[1:24:41] of people following a certain pattern
[1:24:44] with a certain mindset that's a
[1:24:47] denomination you say well how could he
[1:24:50] say that this won't denominate because
[1:24:52] the individual elect Ed bride prays for
[1:24:58] Revelation they seek for
[1:25:02] leadership Lord what would you have me
[1:25:05] to
[1:25:08] do I better move because I want to get
[1:25:10] to my
[1:25:12] sermon and
[1:25:15] so and let's just read down it
[1:25:19] says he says likewise the spirit also
[1:25:22] helpeth our infirmity
[1:25:27] look at the Spirit now this is all about
[1:25:30] the spirit does this the spirit does
[1:25:32] that the spirit's our answer the
[1:25:33] spirit's our reason the spirit is what
[1:25:36] lets us know we're the children of
[1:25:39] God I hope we can understand how
[1:25:41] important it is to come in contact with
[1:25:44] the spirit of
[1:25:47] God and anybody can come into contact
[1:25:50] with the spirit of God Jesus said suffer
[1:25:53] the little children
[1:25:56] little children when you know
[1:25:58] something's wrong to do and you feel
[1:26:02] it that's the spirit of God making
[1:26:04] contact with
[1:26:06] you it Pricks your
[1:26:09] conscience likewise the spirit also help
[1:26:11] with our infires for we know not what we
[1:26:14] should pray for as we ought but the
[1:26:18] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[1:26:22] with groanings which cannot be
[1:26:25] and he that
[1:26:26] searches and he that searches the hearts
[1:26:30] knoweth what is the mind of the spirit
[1:26:34] because he maketh intercession for the
[1:26:37] Saints according to the will of
[1:26:45] God we can't leave Christianity out of
[1:26:50] the
[1:26:53] message the the message is
[1:26:57] Christianity with all the false Doctrine
[1:27:01] all the
[1:27:02] humanism taken out of
[1:27:05] it all the understandings of God that
[1:27:09] are
[1:27:11] man-made it's a a
[1:27:14] purging the pruning of the tree getting
[1:27:18] rid of the Trinity ideas getting rid of
[1:27:20] the man-made evidences of the Holy
[1:27:23] Spirit getting rid of the the the the
[1:27:26] false doctrines of of eternal hell and
[1:27:30] and all these things that eventually as
[1:27:33] you try to grow they Cloud the
[1:27:37] mind and so the the the best thing to
[1:27:40] win the battle in the mind is the word
[1:27:43] of
[1:27:44] God and the word of God was presented in
[1:27:48] this day the Mysteries and the seals
[1:27:51] open totally exposing the son of
[1:27:55] predition which came in and mixed all
[1:27:58] kinds of man-made religious ideas into
[1:28:01] the framework of the
[1:28:03] scriptures and yet our messenger cried
[1:28:06] out to the say back to the
[1:28:11] word back to the
[1:28:13] scripture back to what it
[1:28:18] says and we find out that it's important
[1:28:22] for the church to be led of the spirit
[1:28:26] of
[1:28:27] God not a
[1:28:31] movement not an anointing that falls on
[1:28:35] a a body of Believers in the form of
[1:28:38] emotion those things are
[1:28:41] fine but this individual leadership
[1:28:44] comes down to you your very personal
[1:28:48] relationship with
[1:28:50] him and your
[1:28:56] search for that
[1:29:01] leadership your search in your
[1:29:04] heart for that
[1:29:07] leadership whether it be by
[1:29:10] fasting fasting is not a bad thing to do
[1:29:14] but you do it
[1:29:16] privately you do it as an
[1:29:20] individual you don't you don't uh tear
[1:29:24] your clothes and I'm fasting you know no
[1:29:27] you you wash your face you you you
[1:29:31] stay you you know it's a private thing
[1:29:34] going on because you're thirsting and
[1:29:35] you're hungering for the things of
[1:29:38] God you want God to lead
[1:29:42] you you need an answer from the Lord you
[1:29:46] want to let him know that you're sincere
[1:29:49] about the answer it's a relationship
[1:29:52] it's a fellowship it's a life could I
[1:29:54] say it this way it's a spiritual diet as
[1:29:58] part of your diet it's part of what you
[1:30:01] do you know okay and and so we've never
[1:30:05] believed in taking
[1:30:07] fasting out of a believer's life amen
[1:30:11] we've never believed in taking prayer
[1:30:14] out of the believer's life getting alone
[1:30:17] in the closet we've never wanted to
[1:30:20] substitute
[1:30:22] study for pray pray or intellect for
[1:30:28] revelation we understand that God wants
[1:30:30] to deal with us and so I just want to
[1:30:34] move real quick now and come to my
[1:30:43] scripture and we
[1:30:45] know he says and he that search the
[1:30:48] hearts knoweth that in the mind of the
[1:30:51] spirit because he maketh intercession
[1:30:54] for the Saints according to the will of
[1:30:56] God and we know that all things work
[1:31:00] together for a good to them that love
[1:31:03] God to them who are called according to
[1:31:07] his
[1:31:09] purpose now when you read that scripture
[1:31:13] that's one of the scriptures that's
[1:31:14] taken out of context almost more than
[1:31:17] any other
[1:31:19] scripture all things work together for a
[1:31:21] good
[1:31:24] well that's true but tie it in with
[1:31:27] seeking the will of the Lord being led
[1:31:29] by the spirit of
[1:31:31] God the groaning in your
[1:31:34] heart your position in your
[1:31:37] place now you understand how all things
[1:31:40] work together for a good they all work
[1:31:43] together for a good when you get the
[1:31:45] leadership of the Lord in your life
[1:31:48] they're not going to work for a good if
[1:31:50] they don't G they don't do anything on
[1:31:53] your have to lead
[1:31:59] you you got to be
[1:32:02] led I mean it there's no condemnation
[1:32:06] here this morning we're studying the
[1:32:09] scripture we're just going through the
[1:32:11] scripture we and you know the I could
[1:32:13] read a lot of quotes and but I don't
[1:32:16] think that I need to back everything I'm
[1:32:19] saying up this morning with a a quote we
[1:32:23] we understand that this is the things
[1:32:25] our messenger taught now this is what
[1:32:27] I've been trying to
[1:32:29] reach for whom he did
[1:32:32] Forno he also did
[1:32:37] predestinate amen Now isn't that the
[1:32:40] thing that always makes us
[1:32:42] happy when you talk about your name
[1:32:44] being written on the Lamb's Book of
[1:32:47] Life okay we like
[1:32:50] that I like being
[1:32:52] predestinated that takes a lot of
[1:32:54] pressure off
[1:32:56] me if I wasn't predestinated and I was
[1:32:59] trying to get in I'm My Own
[1:33:02] righteousness and then I find out my
[1:33:04] righteousness is as filthy rags I'm in
[1:33:09] trouble but he gave me his spirit that
[1:33:14] if I would be led by that
[1:33:17] spirit that I'd be called the sons of
[1:33:19] God and that Spirit would lead me to the
[1:33:22] place where I knew I was a child of
[1:33:28] God so I I want to settle that in my
[1:33:31] heart I'm not fighting to be a child of
[1:33:34] God I am a child of God I am
[1:33:38] predestinated I was
[1:33:41] forn how many know you are forn amen
[1:33:45] you're not a surprise to
[1:33:49] God your failures aren't a surprise to
[1:33:53] God for when you were yet a sinner he
[1:33:55] died for
[1:33:57] you so that's not a surprise he's he's
[1:34:01] trying to
[1:34:03] accomplish something
[1:34:07] else God doesn't do anything without a
[1:34:13] purpose so he's trying to
[1:34:16] accomplish something in
[1:34:20] you and he can't do that you're flesh
[1:34:24] will not do that your flesh will not
[1:34:29] accomplish what God intends for you to
[1:34:33] accomplish so he gave you his
[1:34:39] spirit and that by that Spirit you would
[1:34:42] be able to accomplish what it is that
[1:34:46] God had for you to
[1:34:50] accomplish that's why the flesh Wars
[1:34:52] against the spirit
[1:34:54] and the spirit against the flesh that's
[1:34:56] why the carnal mind is an enity with God
[1:34:59] but the spiritual mind is
[1:35:06] life and we already said that each of us
[1:35:09] has a
[1:35:13] purpose and this is what he says this
[1:35:15] just go on for for whom he did Forno he
[1:35:20] also did
[1:35:22] predestinate to be
[1:35:24] conformed to the
[1:35:27] image of his
[1:35:30] son to be conformed to the image of his
[1:35:37] son that he might be the
[1:35:40] firstborn among many Brethren and then
[1:35:45] of course we also know he says
[1:35:49] moreover whom he did predestinate
[1:35:53] then he also
[1:35:55] called and whom he called then he also
[1:35:59] Justified and whom he justified then he
[1:36:03] also glorified what shall we then say to
[1:36:08] these things if God be for us who can be
[1:36:14] against
[1:36:16] us
[1:36:18] amen
[1:36:21] now with all that as a Foundation just
[1:36:24] give me a few minutes to share with you
[1:36:27] what's on my
[1:36:32] heart he wants to bring us into the
[1:36:34] image of his son amen so we know in the
[1:36:40] beginning this is what we
[1:36:43] understand
[1:36:45] that that
[1:36:47] God uh
[1:36:53] God had within him
[1:36:57] attributes and
[1:36:58] characteristics what that he
[1:37:01] was and he wanted a way to
[1:37:06] express
[1:37:07] those
[1:37:09] attributes and what that he
[1:37:13] was and to share himself and have
[1:37:19] Fellowship uh and we're not going to go
[1:37:21] into the threefold purpose of God but
[1:37:24] you know those things many of you have
[1:37:27] read
[1:37:28] that and so we we see
[1:37:33] here in the
[1:37:35] scriptures that the reason that he
[1:37:39] predestinated man was that he could take
[1:37:43] that man and conform him into the image
[1:37:47] of his
[1:37:49] son is that right that's what he's
[1:37:52] looking to do yeah then when Jesus was
[1:37:56] here he he he was letting the church
[1:38:00] know that he was going to go pay a price
[1:38:04] in Calvary for them because he was only
[1:38:07] going to meet a man under the shed blood
[1:38:10] in other words God only meets a man who
[1:38:14] has been to the blood and confessed his
[1:38:18] sins and accepted the pardon for those
[1:38:22] sins amen
[1:38:24] cuz God cannot unite himself with doubt
[1:38:28] and
[1:38:29] fear we just read that we are not built
[1:38:32] in fear we're not established that that
[1:38:35] fear might again reain in our hearts but
[1:38:38] that we know that we're the children of
[1:38:41] God so we we've got to we we want
[1:38:45] to have that place so he wanted to bring
[1:38:49] us into the image of his son he knew we
[1:38:52] were Sinners he died for that he paid
[1:38:54] the price and now he's going to give his
[1:38:58] Spirit to lead that man as we just
[1:39:02] talked about by his Spirit the spirit
[1:39:04] maketh intercession the spirit does this
[1:39:06] for us the spirit does that for us by
[1:39:09] the Spirit by the spirit then he comes
[1:39:11] down he says all that he
[1:39:14] forew he
[1:39:16] predestinated to be
[1:39:18] conformed into the image of his son
[1:39:24] so God had characteristics he had
[1:39:27] attributes he had things that he wanted
[1:39:32] to uh put on
[1:39:35] display and
[1:39:38] share and so he began to
[1:39:42] prophesy he began to sh shadows and
[1:39:45] types in the Old Testament Moses began
[1:39:48] to do works that he did Elijah began to
[1:39:52] do works but finally
[1:39:54] that perfect Son of God was come and
[1:39:59] manifested In the
[1:40:01] Flesh and he paid the
[1:40:04] price of
[1:40:08] unbelief he paid
[1:40:10] it now his sons and his daughters no
[1:40:15] longer had to pay that price as Matthew
[1:40:20] preached which we have in prayer because
[1:40:22] he's in India now with brother Daren and
[1:40:25] and so we we understood that there came
[1:40:28] a time when that price was paid and
[1:40:31] Through the Ages then uh this Jubilee
[1:40:35] year that whoever was in bondage could
[1:40:37] go
[1:40:39] free and that's why we could teach the
[1:40:41] Sabbath how he's the lord of the Sabbath
[1:40:44] and and how that we went through we're
[1:40:46] in the seventh age so the seventh age
[1:40:50] the church was the final age that could
[1:40:52] go free from the powers of sin and death
[1:40:57] and actually come back to the place
[1:40:59] where they could become the Sons and
[1:41:02] Daughters of
[1:41:05] God now God has a
[1:41:09] purpose
[1:41:11] so in
[1:41:15] him he was a
[1:41:18] Creator and we we saw him manifest
[1:41:21] creation we saw all the things that God
[1:41:24] did for the creation the power he gave
[1:41:27] Adam and Eve to rule over the Earth and
[1:41:33] and we
[1:41:35] we understand those things we don't want
[1:41:37] to go back through serpent seed or any
[1:41:40] of those things but God also had
[1:41:43] attributes that man in his Garden of
[1:41:47] Eden
[1:41:49] condition couldn't
[1:41:55] reflect Adam never could get
[1:41:59] sick Adam never needed
[1:42:02] Deliverance Adam never needed
[1:42:05] salvation Adam never needed Grace Adam
[1:42:10] never needed
[1:42:13] Mercy he didn't need any of those things
[1:42:17] so all those attributes of God were
[1:42:21] unknown
[1:42:23] he still had
[1:42:24] them but he had no way to express
[1:42:31] them
[1:42:33] now by
[1:42:35] predestination in the Lamb's Book of
[1:42:38] Life you sitting here this morning are
[1:42:42] the direct
[1:42:43] descendants of
[1:42:48] Adam you're the children of
[1:42:51] Abraham amen
[1:42:53] not the natural children of Abraham but
[1:42:56] you're the spiritual Seed of Abraham
[1:42:59] you're the seed of Faith you're the seed
[1:43:03] of
[1:43:05] Revelation you're what God had in his
[1:43:08] mind in the
[1:43:10] beginning you're the names that were put
[1:43:14] on the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:43:17] foundation of the
[1:43:19] world wouldn't it be wonderful if you
[1:43:21] could start looking at our elves this
[1:43:24] way I like what our messenger said they
[1:43:28] said well we're all Americans he said no
[1:43:31] I'm not an American I'm a Christian
[1:43:34] Living in
[1:43:40] America I might have
[1:43:44] come through my father and
[1:43:48] mother but my place wasn't with the
[1:43:53] vehicle by which God brought me here my
[1:43:57] place was with what he had in his mind
[1:43:59] of me in the beginning so just think
[1:44:03] this morning don't look at yourself as
[1:44:05] being from this Walk of Life from That
[1:44:07] Walk of Life you just came from those
[1:44:10] walks of
[1:44:12] life you came from those walks of life
[1:44:15] to come to the place that you recognize
[1:44:19] that you're the children of God you're
[1:44:21] the Royal seed of Abraham you're the
[1:44:25] descendants of Adam and
[1:44:31] Eve the children of
[1:44:34] God you were made that the first Adam
[1:44:38] was a gave a natural but the second Adam
[1:44:41] was a quickening spirit so he quickened
[1:44:45] you to what that you were in the
[1:44:49] beginning now that's what we are
[1:44:55] but I want to express to you this
[1:44:56] morning something about
[1:45:00] attributes you are the attributes of God
[1:45:04] how many have ever heard that you're the
[1:45:07] attributes of God you're the attributes
[1:45:09] of God
[1:45:16] why and he wants you to
[1:45:19] be the
[1:45:21] image of his son to be conformed into
[1:45:25] that
[1:45:28] image The Works that I do you shall do
[1:45:32] also and I want to remove man's carnal I
[1:45:36] I can't do it but I trust the spirit
[1:45:39] will help us the carnal idea of what
[1:45:43] that means and how that it works it's
[1:45:46] not a
[1:45:48] Reimers or a duplication of the works
[1:45:52] that he did
[1:45:53] it was the spirit that was in him the
[1:45:57] attribute that was in him that produced
[1:46:00] that result so you can't have the result
[1:46:04] without having the
[1:46:08] attribute it's a
[1:46:10] copy it's an
[1:46:14] impersonation but you have the
[1:46:17] attribute because you are the
[1:46:21] attributes now now here's what I want to
[1:46:24] say about an
[1:46:26] attribute an attribute is not
[1:46:30] manifested until there is a
[1:46:38] recipient I'm a
[1:46:41] Healer no I'm not a Healer but I just
[1:46:45] don't take that out of
[1:46:50] context God's A Healer
[1:46:54] but until there's
[1:46:58] somebody that's a recipient of that
[1:47:01] attribute that attribute is not
[1:47:05] manifested so I was
[1:47:10] sick God came and healed
[1:47:13] me now I was once sick but now I'm well
[1:47:19] I now am the
[1:47:21] manifestation of that attribute
[1:47:24] therefore I am that
[1:47:27] attribute made
[1:47:29] flesh because it's not
[1:47:32] manifested until there's a recipient of
[1:47:35] it and when the recipient of it now he
[1:47:39] becomes the possessor of that
[1:47:43] attribute I was
[1:47:47] saved God was a
[1:47:50] savior God was a savior
[1:47:53] when he was dwelt
[1:47:56] alone as the great Fountain of Light am
[1:48:00] but that attribute never could be
[1:48:03] manifested until there was a
[1:48:06] recipient of that
[1:48:11] salvation and you say well how do you
[1:48:13] know God's a
[1:48:16] savior I am that attribute manifested
[1:48:23] I am that attribute
[1:48:28] manifested we know what the fruits of
[1:48:30] the spirit are they're in Galatians we
[1:48:33] know what Peter says the statue of a
[1:48:35] perfect
[1:48:36] man all those things lay
[1:48:43] dormant if we if we would just look at
[1:48:46] them let's go ahead just take a moment
[1:48:47] we'll just take a quick moment and we'll
[1:48:50] just read it really really quick
[1:48:53] Galatians
[1:49:04] 5:22 but the fruit of the spirit is
[1:49:08] love joy peace longsuffering gentleness
[1:49:13] goodness Faith meekness Temperance
[1:49:15] against such there is no
[1:49:17] law let's turn over to Peter
[1:49:45] and this is another Peter says besides
[1:49:48] this give all Dyan stad your faith
[1:49:50] virtue do your virtue knowledge to your
[1:49:52] knowledge Temperance to your Temperance
[1:49:54] patience to your patience godliness to
[1:49:57] Godliness brotherly kindness to
[1:49:59] brotherly kind kindness charity and if
[1:50:02] these things be in you and ye abound
[1:50:06] they make you that you should neither be
[1:50:08] baren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of
[1:50:11] our Lord Jesus Christ now so we
[1:50:16] understand now that an attribute all
[1:50:18] these all the fruits of the spirit love
[1:50:22] patience meekness Temperance all the
[1:50:24] statue things of the Statue of a perfect
[1:50:27] man all the things that they they sit
[1:50:34] void until there's a
[1:50:37] recipient you can
[1:50:40] love but until you have somebody to love
[1:50:44] or that love is projected to somebody
[1:50:48] then it it it remains unknown
[1:50:53] you understand it's not
[1:50:56] manifested it hasn't formed an
[1:50:59] image it just sits
[1:51:04] there healing just sits there until
[1:51:08] there's somebody that needs
[1:51:10] healing Deliverance just sits there
[1:51:13] until there's somebody that needs
[1:51:17] deliverance and so these
[1:51:20] attributes they're never they're not
[1:51:23] manifested or displayed until there's a
[1:51:29] recipient of that
[1:51:31] attribute
[1:51:35] forgiveness you can't
[1:51:38] forgive until there's something to
[1:51:43] forgive now here we
[1:51:46] are the sons and daughters of God is
[1:51:50] that right the children children of
[1:51:53] God that's who we are the direct
[1:51:57] descendants of Abraham whether you've
[1:51:59] come to the realization of it or not
[1:52:02] doesn't mean that that's not who you are
[1:52:05] you're just still in the struggle you're
[1:52:07] still in the mental battle you still got
[1:52:09] to read your Bibles and hear and grow
[1:52:12] until you can come to the place that
[1:52:14] that question is answered and God is not
[1:52:17] going to forsake you he'll deal with you
[1:52:21] he'll work with you he'll he'll speak to
[1:52:23] you he'll train you he'll do whatever
[1:52:27] he's got to do to bring you to the place
[1:52:30] that you conform to the image of his
[1:52:33] stun and as many as he loves he
[1:52:39] chastises but what he's bringing us
[1:52:43] to he's bringing us to the
[1:52:47] place where there are the image of his
[1:52:51] son where we we have the fruits of the
[1:52:53] spirit we have the gift of the spirit we
[1:52:56] have his spirit and his nature but that
[1:53:00] spirit in that nature is not manifested
[1:53:04] until there's a
[1:53:08] recipient amen until I show
[1:53:13] Mercy Mercy is not
[1:53:16] manifested till I show
[1:53:20] forgiveness forgiveness isn't man
[1:53:24] ested until I show
[1:53:29] Grace he never gave us the gifts of the
[1:53:32] Spirit the fruits of the spirit the
[1:53:36] attributes of the
[1:53:38] spirit so we could possess them he gave
[1:53:42] them to us that we could manifest
[1:53:45] them because we can't be in the image of
[1:53:48] his son until the attributes that we
[1:53:53] have and we possess as his sons and as
[1:53:57] his daughters have a
[1:54:00] recipient
[1:54:04] amen we've got to come to the
[1:54:07] place where we forget the idea that our
[1:54:11] Doctrine is saving
[1:54:12] us what saved us was that all he fornew
[1:54:17] he
[1:54:18] predestinated and he predestinated to
[1:54:21] conform into the image of his son that
[1:54:24] he that they could say the works that I
[1:54:26] do you shall do also because you're my
[1:54:30] sons you possess the same attributes and
[1:54:34] those attributes will only be manifested
[1:54:37] when you have a recipient for
[1:54:42] him in other words you've got to show
[1:54:46] somebody love you've got to show
[1:54:49] somebody Mercy you've got to show
[1:54:53] somebody forgiveness you have got to
[1:54:55] pray for somebody you have got to to uh
[1:55:00] show Grace to
[1:55:06] somebody show me your faith without your
[1:55:11] works and I'll show you my faith by my
[1:55:16] Works don't just tell me you have the
[1:55:18] attributes of
[1:55:20] God Who is the
[1:55:22] recipient of the attributes that you
[1:55:27] possess each one of you God has placed
[1:55:31] in your own
[1:55:33] world nobody can take your place and
[1:55:37] you're
[1:55:39] surrounded by all types of circumstances
[1:55:42] and people and all kinds of conditions
[1:55:46] and all kinds of things that are totally
[1:55:48] irrevelant to your salvation
[1:55:54] totally irrevelant to the fact that
[1:55:56] you've already got your place secured in
[1:55:59] heaven and your name's on the Lamb's
[1:56:01] Book of Life and nothing can put it on
[1:56:04] and nothing can take it off that's not
[1:56:06] the issue the issue is the attributes
[1:56:10] that you have finding a
[1:56:15] recipient so you can
[1:56:18] be the manifested
[1:56:22] little

[1:56:48] recipient and now we're fulfilling the
[1:56:51] works that I I did shall you do also not
[1:56:55] a duplication of the
[1:56:58] miracle the miracle was the result of a

[1:57:09] make you understand the attribute had a
[1:57:12] recipient the recipient received that
[1:57:15] attribute and that attribute produces
[1:57:18] Deliverance It produced Grace It

[1:57:23] this is what he said listen what he says
[1:57:26] he and it's so
[1:57:29] beautiful see if I find
[1:57:34] it he said to be conformed in the image
[1:57:38] of his son that he might be the first
[1:57:40] porn first born among many
[1:57:45] Brethren among many Brethren it's from

[1:57:58] live you say he lives in me if he lives
[1:58:02] in you and you have the same Spirit he
[1:58:05] has in you that Spirit quickens your
[1:58:08] mortal body not just to the Rapture but
[1:58:12] it quickens it to the attribute that you
[1:58:15] possess that that attribute that you
[1:58:18] possess finds a
