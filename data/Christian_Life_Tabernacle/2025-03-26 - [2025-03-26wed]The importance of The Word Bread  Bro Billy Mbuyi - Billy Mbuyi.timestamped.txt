[17:28] right now, just lift your hands. Oh, and

[20:31] believe that tonight
[20:33] as we get ready
[20:34] to give the requests and the
[20:39] prayers. I got a testimony in my hand
[20:42] here. Brother Tommy writes, "Thank you
[20:45] for your prayers. The MRI came back
[20:49] clean." That's good news.
[20:52] That's the kind of God we serve.
[20:55] If you come into his house tonight and
[20:57] you have something on your heart, I
[20:59] don't know what it is. Your neighbor may
[21:01] not know what it is, but God knows what
[21:03] it is. Raise it up to him by the
[21:05] uplifting of your hands and trust that
[21:06] he sees the hand and he will meet the
[21:10] need. We'll ask brother Chris to come
[21:12] and pray for these and may the brothers
[21:17] bring the tithes and offerings. Please
[21:18] come up as well.
[21:33] [Music]
[21:36] Let's just pray
[21:38] together. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're
[21:40] so thankful to have the opportunity to
[21:42] approach you this evening, Lord. Father,
[21:45] we thank you, Lord, that Lord, you're so
[21:48] faithful to your word and your promises,
[21:50] Lord. Father, that we have a testimony
[21:52] tonight of a clear
[21:55] report. Lord, we just come before you
[21:57] with many needs. Lord, every raised hand
[21:59] here tonight, Lord, God, we want to lay
[22:02] it upon your word and upon your promise,
[22:04] Father, knowing that you're faithful to
[22:06] everything that you said. Yes, Lord.
[22:09] Whether it's financial, Lord, maybe it's
[22:12] marital, Father, sickness in the body,
[22:15] Lord, those who need work, Father,
[22:18] there's a promise for each need that we
[22:19] have need of, Lord. There's a character
[22:21] to be molded. Lord, there's a patience
[22:23] to be gotten. Lord, I pray, Father, that
[22:26] tonight, Lord, by the preaching of your
[22:28] word, whatever needs that's in here,
[22:31] Lord, Father, you would reveal it to
[22:33] your
[22:34] children, God, that you'd make it
[22:36] personal to them, Lord. Father, that you
[22:38] would drive away the fear and the
[22:40] complex, Lord. Our unbelief or doubts,
[22:43] Lord. God, every need that's here, Lord.
[22:46] Drive away the circumstance, Lord. Fix
[22:48] our eyes upon your word and upon your
[22:50] promise of what you said, Lord. God,
[22:53] give us faith to hold on to it, Lord.
[22:55] Father, knowing that you'll bring it to
[22:57] pass. Lord, you promised that if we
[22:59] called upon your name, we in our house
[23:01] would be saved. You said anything that
[23:04] we lay before you asking in your name,
[23:05] you would do it, Lord. Father, so each
[23:08] one checking their motive, Lord, knowing
[23:10] that it's pure, Father, and in your
[23:12] word, Lord, we just ask it, Lord, in the
[23:14] name of Jesus Christ. Lord, and we'll
[23:17] give you thanks. We'll give you glory,
[23:18] honor, and praise, Lord. Father, we know
[23:21] we're un undeserving, unworthy, Lord.
[23:24] There's nothing that we can do to merit
[23:26] it, Lord, but trust in your word. And
[23:28] so, we ask for that faith tonight, Lord.
[23:31] May it just be lifted up. We commit all
[23:33] these needs into your hands, the tithes
[23:35] and offerings. Lord, we even hold the
[23:38] Mava family before you Lord, her sister
[23:40] hearing, Father, that the doctors say
[23:43] she has cancer, Lord. But Father, if you
[23:45] can give a clean report testimony
[23:47] tonight, Lord, you can give another one,
[23:48] Father. We just take you with the same
[23:51] promise, Lord. Father, we thank you. We
[23:53] love you, Lord. Commit this evening into
[23:56] your hands, Lord. In Jesus name we pray.
[23:57] Amen.
[24:27] I sing that song all my life. You have
[24:29] been
[24:38] faithful. I love you,
[24:43] Lord, for your mercy never fails me.
[24:49] Oh, and all my
[24:52] days I've been held in your
[24:57] hand. From the moment that I wake
[25:01] up until I lay my
[25:05] hand. Oh, I will
[25:08] sing of the
[25:10] goodness of
[25:16] God. All my life you have been

[33:34] are worthy in all aspects, oh God. And
[33:37] Father, to think about the lamb who took
[33:39] the book of life. And Father, our names
[33:42] were in there, Lord. And even as we
[33:44] stand here, Lord, Father, we we're
[33:46] worshiping you, not the God of history,
[33:49] but the God of reality, Lord. And
[33:52] father, we can see the effect of why the
[33:54] lamb took the book of life manifested
[33:57] every day in our lives, Lord. And
[33:59] Father, we are beneficiaries of that
[34:01] life, oh God, when you took that book
[34:04] and you began to call out our names,
[34:06] Lord, and you brought us from sins into
[34:09] the kingdom of light. Father, we are
[34:12] here to give glory to your name. Amen.

[34:22] Because you took the book tonight. We
[34:24] want to commit what we are to you and
[34:26] invite you in this service, Lord. We
[34:29] know that you've given us your word for
[34:30] us to eat and be strengthened by it,
[34:34] Lord. And we gather here so that every
[34:36] need that's represented in this body
[34:38] tonight, Lord, may you just come by the
[34:41] way of your word and speak to it, Lord.
[34:43] Father, that we may get stronger
[34:45] tonight, that we may be nourished by the
[34:48] word of God and go out of here better
[34:50] than the way we came. Father, you have
[34:52] not left us alone. And you promise in
[34:55] your word that I'll be with you, even in
[34:56] you until the end. And we can say
[34:59] certainly tonight that Lord, you've made
[35:01] that promise true, Lord. Tonight, we
[35:03] commit what we are into your hands,
[35:05] Lord. And no doubt we've come from work
[35:08] and various places and tired in body.
[35:11] But Lord, for one moment, we just want
[35:13] to put our tightness aside and focus on
[35:15] you, Lord. And father, you are the
[35:17] eternal word of God that we live by. And
[35:20] we want to just call upon your name that
[35:22] you may come and strengthen us by your
[35:24] word. Once again, we we worshiped you in
[35:27] songs and now we want to go to the word.
[35:29] Lord, we pray that you give us grace and
[35:31] mercy, Father, that we may speak the
[35:33] things which you have revealed to us. We
[35:35] love you and we commit the whole service
[35:37] into your hands. In the name of the Lord
[35:39] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. So

[35:46] welcome you tonight. Let's just open our
[35:48] Bibles tonight.
[35:50] And
[35:52] and in Matthew chapter uh 13, we're
[35:56] going to read verse
[35:58] 24-30. Um
[36:00] uh very familiar scripture reading. Man,
[36:03] I trust you're happy to be in the house
[36:05] of God tonight.
[36:06] [Music]
[36:07] Amen. Matthew 24 uh uh 13 and 24, he
[36:12] says, "And another parable put it forth
[36:14] unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven
[36:17] is likened unto a man which swed good
[36:20] seed in this field." But
[36:23] while men slept, his enemy came and saw
[36:27] teared among the wheat and went his way.
[36:31] But when the blade was sprung up and
[36:34] brought forth fruits, then appeared the
[36:36] tear also. So the servants of the
[36:40] household came and said unto him, "Sir,
[36:43] didn't thou sow good seed in thy field?
[36:47] From whence then had the te it teared?"
[36:52] He said unto them, "An enemy has done
[36:55] this." The servant said unto him, "Wilt
[36:58] thou then that we go and gather them
[37:01] up?" But he said, "Nay, lest while ye
[37:05] gather up the tears, ye root up also the
[37:08] wheat with him." It says, "Let both grow
[37:12] together until the harvest. In the time
[37:16] of the harvest will ye say to the
[37:19] reaper, "Gather ye together the
[37:22] tear and bind them in uh bundle to be
[37:27] burned, but gather the wheat into my
[37:30] garner." Gracious father, we ask you
[37:32] bless your word to us in the name of
[37:34] Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. God bless.
[37:36] You may have your seats.
[37:42] [Music]
[37:46] Uh, I was
[37:49] just trying to figure out a way to
[37:52] approach this and and perhaps just from
[37:56] what our pastor has been preaching
[37:58] um just about uh the way forward being
[38:03] the bread of life and I will
[38:06] probably just give a title to focus your
[38:10] mind.
[38:12] Um and and the theme perhaps just to
[38:15] help us. Um I want to call it the end
[38:18] time seed word. Uh but my my really my
[38:23] theme is the importance of the word
[38:25] bread. The importance of the word
[38:29] bread. We if you perhaps just away from
[38:35] a way to start this. Um, I was thinking
[38:38] about even as as believers of this
[38:41] message that are gathered here tonight,
[38:44] we understand the word of God said we
[38:45] live by the word. every word of God that
[38:49] proceed every word that proceedth out of
[38:51] the mouth of God. And we understand that
[38:54] and the prophet will make an
[38:56] illustration um and use the natural uh
[38:59] man and it will say that we we we can uh
[39:03] look at nature, we can look at ourselves
[39:06] even we can look at trees and and
[39:08] understand that uh we feed we have to
[39:12] eat in order for us to survive. Um if
[39:15] you don't eat you will die. uh life with
[39:18] itself within its own definition is a
[39:21] struggle to keep life you have to eat
[39:24] and and within the food that we grow in
[39:27] the ground within the food that's grown
[39:30] and the the whether it be the fruits or
[39:32] the animal and everything we eat we find
[39:34] out that within that there's the
[39:37] nutrients and God build it to be that
[39:39] way by the way so we can eat the the the
[39:42] the vegetables we can eat uh the the
[39:45] fruits we can eat animals, we can eat
[39:48] those things and within that we can find
[39:50] the ingredients that will sustain this
[39:53] natural man. And we find out that if you
[39:56] don't eat, you die. So we eat and we
[39:58] find the supplements that that we need
[40:01] in order for us to eat and and sustain
[40:03] the natural man. And I can say often
[40:06] time you can many times people will even
[40:09] buy supplements because if you don't eat
[40:11] all of the vitamins you need your body
[40:14] will start to show certain symptoms.
[40:16] Why? Because you are missing a certain
[40:18] vitamin. You'll buy supplement in order
[40:20] for you to get that and eat it and then
[40:22] so you can get so you can get what you
[40:25] need in order for you to grow. So we
[40:27] find out spiritually is no different.
[40:30] And so because Barburn will use that. So
[40:32] I'll say the the revealed word of God
[40:35] that we have received, God has packaged
[40:38] it to have all the nutrients that we may
[40:40] need in order for us to live
[40:42] spiritually.
[40:44] And and and I want to just stress on
[40:46] that and I I I'll say just from my own
[40:49] heart that is becoming more and more a
[40:53] reality to me more than ever before. You
[40:57] know, men looks for excitement. And man
[40:59] looks for something a shiny object. Men
[41:02] looks for something that is attracted
[41:04] attractive. And I want to say this, you
[41:06] will not find what you're looking for in
[41:08] the attractive things. You need to focus
[41:11] on the word bread that's been given unto
[41:14] us. And I want to say within that word
[41:16] bread, God has put all the supplements,
[41:19] all the nutrients enough for you to get
[41:22] what you need. If you need healing
[41:24] tonight, there's a vitamin H for healing
[41:27] in there. If you need deliverance,
[41:29] there's a vitamin D. And if we're going
[41:32] to go in the rapture, we need the
[41:34] vitamin R for us to eat it, for it to
[41:36] for us to go in the rapture. It's in the
[41:39] word of God that we have received. It's
[41:42] not outside of the Bible. It's the
[41:44] revealed word of the end time. And that
[41:48] is very important because if we the what
[41:52] what the enemy comes with and I realize
[41:55] is to to try to uh uh protect the word
[42:00] that has been revealed unto us and begin
[42:03] to group it in a certain way that would
[42:05] attract your attention almost to make it
[42:08] seem like one part of it is more
[42:10] important than the other. The whole word
[42:13] of God is important to the believer.
[42:18] And and that's how men comes with the
[42:20] doctrine and one will run this way, one
[42:22] will run that way. They put more
[42:25] emphasis on one thing as if that is
[42:27] important than the other. No, we need
[42:30] all the vitamins. We we need in other
[42:32] word we as we gather here, our goal is
[42:36] rapture, but we know that God also
[42:39] promised us healing in this body as we
[42:41] move along. We we heard it. I love how
[42:44] uh uh Bel even put it last Sunday as he
[42:47] was talking and that it's so important.
[42:49] We realize that the believer the the
[42:52] natural things the healing that can
[42:55] happen in this flesh is important but
[42:57] the focus is the rapture because we can
[43:00] get healing and die. We we we eat but we
[43:03] will die in this flesh but what we would
[43:05] receive from God is eternal life that
[43:08] will never pass away. So therefore, the
[43:11] word of God is there to supply as we go
[43:14] along the journey and everything we have
[43:17] need of is in there. And and as
[43:19] believers, I I want to say this, it's
[43:22] important that we fell in love with our
[43:24] word and we eat it every day.
[43:28] Not not on occasion, not not just when
[43:31] we are sick, but every day you eat. So
[43:33] you are built up because the word is
[43:36] given to you. I want to say this and uh
[43:39] perhaps just jumping forward now. It's
[43:41] not just given for you for your defense.
[43:44] It's given for both defense and offense.
[43:48] When when something will rise, you have
[43:50] to have the word of God inside of you
[43:53] that you can speak so the enemy will
[43:55] stop. You don't wait until something
[43:58] happen then you run to the word. Oh,
[43:59] what can I use? No. God wants us to be a
[44:02] household of faith that is built up in
[44:05] the faith of the word of the hour, the
[44:07] faith of the end time. And the only way
[44:10] we could be built is by eating of the
[44:12] word of God.
[44:15] That that that's that was the
[44:16] instruction of the angel to John and
[44:19] said, "Eat of the book and you shall
[44:21] prophesy." It's not given for us to
[44:24] contemplate or or to study so we can
[44:27] gain some intellectual. No is given.
[44:30] Remember brotherham said this the end
[44:32] time message will overcome the end time
[44:35] challenges. So when you face ch I don't
[44:37] care what the challenge is tonight. I
[44:40] don't care whether it's natural
[44:41] spiritual whether it be finance the word
[44:44] the revealed word and the reason why I
[44:46] want to be putting focus in that is
[44:48] because there is a specially given word
[44:52] in the end time the entire revealed word
[44:55] of God. Because remember the same
[44:57] prophet will say the word that was given
[44:59] in the time of Noah, the time of Moses
[45:01] will do you no good. But it's the entire
[45:04] reveal of this hour that will produce
[45:06] what God wants it to produce.
[45:09] So it becomes very important that as
[45:11] believers of the message, we focus on
[45:14] that. Whatever the challenges I'm
[45:16] facing, whether I need healing, when I
[45:18] need the Holy Spirit, whatever I need,
[45:20] the focus is I need to eat the word of
[45:23] life, the bread of life, and the bread
[45:26] will produce what I have need of. The
[45:28] same way the natural process works, God
[45:31] has made it so that the spiritual
[45:33] process will produce the same thing. It
[45:36] will not fail. Why? Because God never
[45:38] fails. He lay out the natural process so
[45:42] a believer could look at the natural
[45:44] process and know the same God who lay
[45:46] out the natural process will bring forth
[45:48] the spiritual process.
[45:54] So we read the
[45:56] scripture and remember it says this is
[46:00] until the the master will say let them
[46:04] both grow together until the harvest
[46:07] time. And I know a pastor has been
[46:09] laboring from the standpoint of the
[46:12] harvest time and and I just want to come
[46:14] and I thought that this this is so uh it
[46:18] goes such so in parallel and the message
[46:21] in the message but preach the seed of
[46:23] discrepancy and and we'll just see how
[46:26] those goes together. He speaks in verse
[46:28] two it says I'm sorry paragraph 2 he
[46:31] says did you notice gather the ter first
[46:34] and bundle them up. Now reading this,
[46:36] there was something strange that came to
[46:38] me while I was sitting up on the top of
[46:40] the Catalina Mountains the other night.
[46:43] It says in prayer and I thought where
[46:45] could I gather a word that I could that
[46:48] that I could use for this and I wanted
[46:51] to speak on
[46:52] tonight. It said and I went down and I
[46:55] find a word I find the word of
[46:59] discrepancy. So um I go to the
[47:02] dictionary and looked and the word
[47:03] discrepancy means sowing
[47:07] discord or being contrary. So again
[47:12] because he would use even uh within here
[47:16] he I don't know if I'll have time to
[47:18] read it all but he would speak how he
[47:21] would even have a vision of of what
[47:24] exactly what this is. So because in my
[47:27] mind when I always thought about the
[47:29] scripture I would think uh that the
[47:31] master came and saw the seed and then
[47:34] the enemy came in the same field. Now
[47:36] remember it's in the same field. It's
[47:38] not a different field in the same field
[47:40] and I thought he would plant the other
[47:42] next to it. But bam says no he planted
[47:46] right on top of what what the master
[47:48] planted.
[47:50] Right on top of what the master planted.
[47:53] That's where the enemy is trying to do
[47:55] his work. Right where God is placing his
[47:57] seed, that's where Satan wants his seed
[47:59] to be also. So he said describing. So
[48:03] something contrary. And it says as
[48:05] Webster will say sewing discord discord
[48:09] something different. In other words,
[48:12] it's something that the master didn't
[48:14] plant. It's something that the master
[48:17] didn't want in the field. the enemy
[48:18] comes and does it being contrary to
[48:21] what's already uh what's already been.
[48:25] So I thought it says the text tonight I
[48:27] called it the seed of discrepancy and I
[48:29] trust that the Lord will bless his word
[48:31] now um as we approach it. So when we
[48:35] speak about the seed of discrepancy
[48:38] uh uh there's it by the very definition
[48:42] when we say discrepancy it means that
[48:45] you you you you have to already have uh
[48:49] the very definition of what the original
[48:52] was in order for you to describe what
[48:55] discrepancy is. So you you if there was
[48:59] nothing in the ground and the only seed
[49:01] that was sown was the enemy's seed they
[49:04] you couldn't say that that that's the
[49:07] seed of discrepancy. The only reason why
[49:10] it's called a seed of discrepancy is
[49:12] because there was already an original
[49:14] seed that was planted there by the
[49:17] master. And and I want to I want to say
[49:20] this when when the master is planting
[49:22] his seed, he's planting it for a purpose
[49:25] and he's planting it waiting for the
[49:27] harvest to produce something that he
[49:29] knows what is supposed to be. The master
[49:32] is not confused. In other words, the
[49:34] master didn't uh uh uh plant uh apple uh
[49:37] seed and waited for him to get oranges.
[49:40] The master whatever he planted, he knew
[49:43] what it would produce. He knew what he
[49:46] planted. He was confident in his own
[49:48] seed that he planted that it will
[49:50] produce what he wanted it because
[49:52] remember the law of the seed is what a
[49:54] seed is planted therefore the fruits
[49:56] will be the same so that there will be
[49:58] no confusion. So there has to be the
[50:02] original first with a purpose in mind
[50:05] with a goal and objective in order for
[50:08] us to call the other a discrepancy or
[50:11] something different. The discrepancy is
[50:13] a deviation from the original purpose.
[50:19] A deviation from the when when man is no
[50:23] longer doing what God intended for him
[50:25] to do. When man is no longer operating
[50:28] in the manner that God intended him,
[50:31] that's a deviation from the original
[50:33] purpose. When man is finding himself in
[50:36] sin and trespass and and the things of
[50:38] the world and lovers of pleasures more
[50:40] than God, that's a seed of the script.
[50:43] That was never the intended p purpose of
[50:46] the creation of
[50:47] man. And God planted in seed in order to
[50:52] reproduce himself. And the devil came in
[50:54] the same ground, the same field, the
[50:57] same person. and and uh forgive me uh
[51:00] perhaps I just want to for the sake of
[51:02] illustration uh remember the scripture
[51:05] says in Genesis that God came and he
[51:08] labored for seven he came and he planted
[51:10] and it created he created and the
[51:12] scripture says and after six days after
[51:15] uh he created man and the seventh day he
[51:17] rested so when he was resting that's
[51:20] when after that so you can take this
[51:23] scripture and overlay it with what
[51:25] happened in Genesis and realize that
[51:27] it's the enemy me that came and saw
[51:30] something that God didn't sow in the
[51:32] beginning.
[51:34] And it says the devil planted another
[51:37] seed that God didn't plant in order to
[51:39] deform the seed that was planted. The
[51:42] seed that the that seed of the enemy
[51:45] plant that that seed that the enemy
[51:47] planted in the field is referred to as
[51:49] the seed of discrepancy is something
[51:52] that God did not plant. something that
[51:56] um that that is planted in order to
[52:02] hinder to fight against the original
[52:05] seed word that God
[52:08] planted. And but let me just say this,
[52:12] that's why it's so important as
[52:14] believers of this message to properly
[52:18] identify ourselves, who we really are.
[52:21] Because I believe the word of of the end
[52:23] time has done that for us. God is not
[52:26] the author of confusion. And I feel like
[52:29] sometimes we run into that same
[52:31] confusion within our own self. God
[52:33] didn't create you a liar. He didn't
[52:35] create you a sinner. He didn't create
[52:38] you with with the the all kinds of
[52:41] things and the liar and the sinner and
[52:43] all those things. When God created you,
[52:45] he created you perfectly. When God
[52:48] thought about you in the beginning, you
[52:50] were perfect in his sight. Whatever you
[52:53] find yourself today is the seed of
[52:56] discrepancy. It's the enemy that did
[52:58] that.
[53:00] Don't Don't ever attribute that to
[53:02] yourself. understand that the enemy
[53:05] planted something that was never
[53:07] original.
[53:11] And and I think you say, "Why? Why do
[53:14] you say that?" Because I and I believe
[53:16] that's the battle we run into. It's our
[53:19] everyday battle. Every time we look at
[53:21] the man in the mirror, we automatically
[53:24] look at him as ourselves. Oh, I'm a liar
[53:27] and I'm this and I do that. Let me say
[53:29] all those things. We can track it right
[53:32] back into the garden of Eden where Satan
[53:34] saw his own seed. Let me say all those
[53:37] things you have inherited it from your
[53:39] natural parents. You have inherited it
[53:42] from a nature that came from the devil.
[53:44] All those things you've inherited it by
[53:46] the new by the birth by the natural
[53:48] birth that you came in through sin. But
[53:51] your true nature that God created you
[53:53] with is the seed. Let me say this. If
[53:57] God is holiness, then he cannot create
[53:59] out of him something that is sinful.
[54:03] Come on. If God is righteousness, then
[54:06] out of him cannot something that is
[54:08] unrighteous come forth. Why? When he
[54:11] created you, he created you in his own
[54:13] image. And if you are in the image of
[54:15] God, then you have to be perfect like he
[54:18] is.
[54:19] What whatever is happening with you is
[54:22] the seed of discrepancy.
[54:28] So God didn't make you he didn't plant
[54:32] sickness in your body.
[54:34] He didn't plan
[54:36] frustration. He didn't bring temper and
[54:40] lust and and and everything that we find
[54:43] oursel and somebody does this and then
[54:45] you lose it. Th those are the attribute
[54:48] of the flesh. The attributes of what
[54:52] happen when sin comes in. But God has
[54:55] placed a seed inside of you so you can
[54:58] feed that seed and overcome the things
[55:02] of the flesh. And that's why I said that
[55:05] it's becoming uh at least to my heart
[55:09] more clear why is it so important that
[55:12] we eat of the word bread. The the the
[55:15] the seed inside of you is not made to
[55:18] live by education or by civilization or
[55:21] by the things of the world. If you feed
[55:24] it the things of the world, it will die.
[55:27] Or at least, let me say this, it will
[55:29] not produce what God intended it to
[55:31] produce. The only way it can come to
[55:34] maturity, the only way it can produce
[55:36] another God is for you to feed it the
[55:39] original pure word of God. That's why
[55:42] the word is so important to a believer.
[55:45] Why? Because the word the pure word of
[55:47] God will produce a pure believer.
[55:52] The the challenge with life is we we've
[55:54] let men educate us into Christianity and
[55:57] we've let people uh come and give us
[56:00] explanation and intellectual
[56:01] understanding and therefore we find
[56:04] ourselves not overcoming and we ask why
[56:06] because we've gone away from the
[56:08] original.
[56:11] The only thing that can produce a true
[56:14] Christianity is the word of God in its
[56:17] purity.
[56:19] Amen.
[56:22] It's part of the seed that the enemy
[56:24] planted in the garden from the beginning
[56:27] that's been manifesting in mankind.
[56:34] So just as we can
[56:37] identify the seed of discrepancy itself
[56:40] in the
[56:41] mankind, we also as believers have to
[56:45] identify the seed that God planted in
[56:48] us.
[56:49] It's not a seed of
[56:52] discrepancy
[56:53] that will have a tendency or the the the
[56:58] seed of discrepancy doesn't have a
[57:00] desire to worship God.
[57:04] No, the the seed of discrepancy doesn't
[57:08] look for more of God. The seed of
[57:10] discrepancy doesn't say, "Oh, I can't
[57:13] stay home. I have to be in church."
[57:15] The seed of discrepancy doesn't say I
[57:18] need to hear the word of God so I can
[57:20] grow. The seed of discrepancy says is
[57:24] anything that's contrary to what God
[57:27] spoke. Anything. And I want you to say
[57:30] whether it's 99% or 100% fault, it's the
[57:34] seed of discrepancy. Amen.
[57:38] It's not the seed of discrepancy that
[57:41] that would take a human and and it will
[57:44] wake him up and say, "I want to go to
[57:46] church." That's not the spirit of
[57:47] discrepancy. The word says, "My sheep
[57:50] hear my voice. Another they will not
[57:52] follow." Why? What? That thing in you
[57:56] that that hungers for the true word of
[57:58] God, that hungers for the manifestation
[58:01] of God, that part of you that is in you
[58:04] that tells you that I uh when you hear
[58:07] the word of God and something within
[58:08] your heart that lifts up and say, I want
[58:11] what I'm hearing to become a reality in
[58:13] my life, that's the seed of God in you.
[58:16] In fact, says the only reason why you
[58:19] receive the word of God is because you
[58:21] have the spirit of God in you.
[58:31] He
[58:34] says, "So, we
[58:37] know that there's going to be a battle
[58:40] going on in the flesh and your flesh
[58:43] will tell
[58:44] you you're not going to make it.
[58:50] You are hypocrites and you don't have
[58:53] the Holy Spirit. Now I'm talking about
[58:56] daily
[58:58] battles. You know when you think you've
[59:00] made progress, your flesh will work up
[59:02] the next time and just let you know you
[59:04] have made zero progress.
[59:09] When you think you've gotten a
[59:11] revelation and the next you'll find out
[59:12] that the flesh will stand up and said,
[59:14] "I thought you said you got a
[59:16] revelation.
[59:20] But you see, to me, the very existence
[59:23] of the battle shows that there is
[59:25] something that's contrary.
[59:28] Yes, sir. And I want to say this, the
[59:31] opposition is built in order to run away
[59:34] those that don't qualify. Without the
[59:37] opposition, you wouldn't know those that
[59:39] are or those that are. Because with
[59:41] that, when the opposition come, those
[59:43] that don't that are not called will run
[59:45] away. But those that are called will
[59:47] stay there. They will fight the
[59:49] opposition. They will continue to fight
[59:52] until the very end. Why? Because they
[59:54] something. What you testifying is not
[59:57] what comes from your mind. Is what comes
[59:59] directly from the word that's spoken out
[1:00:02] of the seed.
[1:00:08] I I'll be terrified if my flesh told me
[1:00:10] that I was a Christian.
[1:00:13] I'm just being honest. If I woke up and
[1:00:16] my flesh told me, "Oh, you are such a
[1:00:18] good Christian. Oh, Bobby, I'll think
[1:00:21] something is terribly
[1:00:24] wrong." Why? Because then there won't be
[1:00:27] any opposition. God has made it so that
[1:00:30] when when things don't go right and when
[1:00:32] when you start sweating, when you start
[1:00:34] to get nervous about a situation and
[1:00:37] when you think you have no way out and
[1:00:38] when you think you boxed up, something
[1:00:41] within your heart rises and say, "I'm
[1:00:43] looking towards the promise that made.
[1:00:46] I'm looking towards the word that's been
[1:00:48] given to me and speak the word and move
[1:00:50] forward."
[1:00:52] That's how a believer walks. He walks by
[1:00:55] the word of God and he lets the word of
[1:00:57] God manifesting itself every day in his
[1:01:02] life. I if it wasn't for that we
[1:01:05] wouldn't be gathered here.
[1:01:07] Every one of us here gathered here
[1:01:09] tonight has an experience of when you
[1:01:11] thought it was going to be the end. When
[1:01:14] you thought you were boxed in, when you
[1:01:16] thought there was no option, when you
[1:01:18] thought there was no way out, but the
[1:01:20] seed word of God believed that there was
[1:01:22] an option for you to get out. And now
[1:01:24] word, because you believe, you receive
[1:01:27] the promise of what you were believing
[1:01:29] in. That's right.
[1:01:32] The prophet will continue on. Let me
[1:01:35] just read uh in
[1:01:36] [Music]
[1:01:38] Matthew that same verse, that same
[1:01:40] chapter uh 13 and and and
[1:01:45] 20 20 uh uh 13 and 36. It says, "Then
[1:01:49] Jesus said unto uh send a multitude
[1:01:52] away, and went into a house, and his
[1:01:55] disciple came unto him, saying, now this
[1:01:58] is after he has spoke of the parable. So
[1:02:01] now his disciples are coming to him and
[1:02:04] saying what is that parable that you
[1:02:06] spoke mean so he can give them a
[1:02:08] meaning. And he said uh he said unto his
[1:02:11] disciples saying declare unto us the
[1:02:13] parable of the tear in the field. He
[1:02:16] answered and said unto them he said uh
[1:02:18] he that saw the good seed is the son of
[1:02:21] man. It says the field is the world the
[1:02:24] world and the the good seed are the
[1:02:27] children of the kingdom but the tears
[1:02:29] are the children of the wicked one. The
[1:02:31] enemy that sow them is the devil the
[1:02:34] harvest is the end of the world and the
[1:02:36] reapers are the
[1:02:38] angels. And then it says and therefore
[1:02:40] the terrors are gather and burn in fire.
[1:02:43] Uh so shall it be in the end of the
[1:02:46] world. uh uh in the end of this world,
[1:02:49] the son of man shall send forth his
[1:02:52] angels. And then it says, "And they
[1:02:54] shall gather up gather out of his
[1:02:57] kingdom all things that offend, and them
[1:03:01] which do iniquity, and shall cast them
[1:03:05] in into a furnace of fire. There shall
[1:03:07] be whailing and and nashing of teeth,
[1:03:10] and then shall the righteous shine
[1:03:13] forth. as the son in the in the kingdom
[1:03:16] of the father who who who has an ear let
[1:03:20] him hear um let him hear the prophet now
[1:03:23] talks about this and he says that that
[1:03:25] now it says that's Jesus giving the
[1:03:28] interpretation of the parable himself
[1:03:30] and therefore we know uh we know then
[1:03:33] what the interpretation means and now as
[1:03:36] we approach this this swer the seed the
[1:03:39] the reapers uh the the the reaping Now
[1:03:43] of the interpretation it says then I
[1:03:45] believe that Jesus was speaking here you
[1:03:47] of the parable uh uh in this day but was
[1:03:51] meaning it to be in the end of the world
[1:03:55] or the end of the age. So the the
[1:03:59] prophet is now saying the the very
[1:04:01] parable that Jesus is speaking even
[1:04:04] though he spoke it in the time that they
[1:04:06] were living in but the very application
[1:04:09] of it will not be either until the end
[1:04:11] of the age or until the end of time as
[1:04:14] we are living in. It says which is this
[1:04:16] day. And I believe that this little text
[1:04:19] tonight is a very um appropriate is very
[1:04:23] appropriate for the hour that we are
[1:04:26] living in because Jesus distinctly said
[1:04:29] in here the gathering will be at the end
[1:04:32] of this world. That's when the end will
[1:04:35] be the gathering of the wheat and also
[1:04:37] the gathering of the tear burning them
[1:04:40] to take it into the wheat uh into the
[1:04:43] kingdom. And I believe it was this way.
[1:04:46] It says, "And another scripture led uh
[1:04:50] uh leads me to believe this way." I
[1:04:52] believe it's written down here in
[1:04:54] Matthew 24 and 24 where he says it says
[1:04:57] talking about the uh the the the seed
[1:05:00] the seed of discrepancy. Jesus says that
[1:05:03] the two were so uh would be so close
[1:05:07] till they would deceive the very elect
[1:05:09] if it were possible. Almost exactly the
[1:05:11] same. So in another place, it says in
[1:05:15] another place in the scripture where
[1:05:17] it's written that the rain falls on the
[1:05:19] just and the unjust.
[1:05:24] But Ram will talk about it the
[1:05:26] experience that he had with the
[1:05:28] Pentecostals. and he will talk about I
[1:05:30] believe he was in uh Indiana Mishwalker
[1:05:34] if I'm not mistaken where he went to a
[1:05:37] convention and and that's where he saw
[1:05:39] the two men speak in tongues and and he
[1:05:42] said that he heard and and he came to
[1:05:44] the meetings uh he saw them speak in
[1:05:47] tongue um uh as he was attending and I
[1:05:50] believe it was two days later or so he
[1:05:52] came and he was asked to preach and
[1:05:54] after he preached he began to look for
[1:05:56] this man so he can meet them And he said
[1:05:59] when he heard them speak in tongue, he
[1:06:00] went uh in the corn field after that
[1:06:03] because he got himself away. He went and
[1:06:06] he studied his Bible and find out that
[1:06:08] what they were speaking and the things
[1:06:10] they were doing were was perfectly
[1:06:12] scriptural. So he went when he met the
[1:06:14] first man said that the first man was
[1:06:17] absolutely a a genuine believer. But
[1:06:21] when he met the second one, he find out
[1:06:23] that this man
[1:06:25] was was an hypocrite. He was married to
[1:06:28] one wife and and and and and was was
[1:06:31] living with another had children with
[1:06:33] him and everything. And he said after
[1:06:36] that he got him confused and and he said
[1:06:39] uh two years later I believe the prophet
[1:06:41] will say he uh he would go and he was
[1:06:44] praying up on uh a certain place and he
[1:06:47] had a vision uh that came and uh where
[1:06:50] he was praying and his Bible opened up
[1:06:52] to Hebrews chapter 8 and and and then he
[1:06:56] says this. It says uh you open up in
[1:06:58] scripture uh Hebrews chapter 6 actually
[1:07:01] verse 8 it says and the scripture that
[1:07:03] was quoted is was by which uh uh the
[1:07:07] bearers dawn and breathe uh and and
[1:07:10] briars and and and rejected uh in his
[1:07:13] sight unto curse whose end is to be
[1:07:16] burned. And he said, "Then I saw a
[1:07:18] vision of two men and one running uh he
[1:07:21] went into the world of the the curve
[1:07:24] curvature of the earth and he went and
[1:07:26] he saw seed and the other one came and
[1:07:28] he saw right on top and they came both
[1:07:30] and they they saw seed and and he said
[1:07:33] one was uh dressed in white and he came
[1:07:35] and he saw the other one looked horrible
[1:07:37] and they came and they saw the seed." So
[1:07:39] it says here it says they both came up
[1:07:42] together. when it did, both was thirsty.
[1:07:46] And it says because um because a rain
[1:07:49] was needed and each one looked like uh
[1:07:52] it was praying and in his uh little head
[1:07:56] and in his little head bent over and he
[1:07:59] send it says, "Lord, send rain and send
[1:08:01] rain and the great cloud came up and the
[1:08:04] rain fell upon both of them." It says,
[1:08:06] "And when he did, the little wheat
[1:08:09] jumped up and began to praise the Lord.
[1:08:12] Praise the Lord. And the little wheat
[1:08:14] jumped up right the same. And the and
[1:08:16] the other one jumped right out the same
[1:08:19] and said, "Praise the Lord. Praise the
[1:08:20] Lord." And the vision was interpreted.
[1:08:23] The rain falls on the just and the
[1:08:26] unjust. The same spirit can fall in the
[1:08:29] meeting. Brother Bam says, "And
[1:08:31] everybody rejoicing in it, hypocrites
[1:08:34] and Christian, and all together."
[1:08:36] Exactly. Right. But what it says, what
[1:08:40] is it? It says by the fruit they shall
[1:08:43] they by the fruit by the fruit they are
[1:08:46] known. See that's the only way it could
[1:08:50] ever be
[1:08:56] known. And I thought that's a sobering
[1:08:59] thing
[1:09:01] because we we don't want to just be
[1:09:04] those that will jump. And I'm not saying
[1:09:06] jumping there's anything wrong with
[1:09:08] that.
[1:09:09] I the the true word of God will produce
[1:09:13] the fruits of God.
[1:09:15] The true word of God will produce what
[1:09:18] God intended it to
[1:09:20] produce. And then it says then you see
[1:09:23] now since uh since uh the wild oats and
[1:09:28] wild wheat and the grain sometimes
[1:09:30] impersonate the genuine domestic grain
[1:09:33] so close that it will deceive the very
[1:09:35] lack. I think we are living in a timely
[1:09:37] age when these things should be preached
[1:09:41] on and talked about.
[1:09:50] And let me say
[1:09:51] this, if we need a rapture, we need to
[1:09:55] be careful that we are only feeding on
[1:09:58] the word that was given to us. Amen.
[1:10:01] We we we don't need some demonstration
[1:10:04] of something or or somebody's
[1:10:06] intellectual understanding. But is now
[1:10:10] giving a warning to the church and
[1:10:11] saying that the enemy at the end time
[1:10:14] will be so religious that it will it
[1:10:17] will come to a place that it will be so
[1:10:19] close that it will deceive the very
[1:10:21] elect if it was possible. He will come
[1:10:23] with sign and wonders. It will come with
[1:10:25] all things. In fact, the prophet said he
[1:10:27] can impersonate all the uh the spiritual
[1:10:31] gift and he said you have to be so
[1:10:34] careful that if you are not paying
[1:10:36] attention to what is it that they're
[1:10:38] preaching, what is it that they're
[1:10:40] saying that he said that you're going to
[1:10:42] miss it. Now in fact now is saying that
[1:10:45] and the only one who can tell you what's
[1:10:48] true from what's false is the angel of
[1:10:50] the Lord.
[1:10:54] Let me just read it. Paragraph 19. It
[1:10:56] says, "Now notice in verse 41, the two
[1:10:59] were so close in the last day, if you
[1:11:01] could put it there, in the last day that
[1:11:04] he didn't they didn't he could not
[1:11:06] depend on some some certain church to
[1:11:09] separate them." So the church cannot
[1:11:12] separate it for you. You can't say, "I'm
[1:11:14] just coming to church then I'll get it."
[1:11:16] No, that's not what it takes.
[1:11:19] It says the he says it says it cannot
[1:11:22] separate them for separate them say the
[1:11:25] Methodist or the Baptist or the
[1:11:27] Pentecostal to separate them. He says he
[1:11:30] sends his angel to separate them. An
[1:11:33] angel is is coming to bring the
[1:11:37] separation the se the segregation
[1:11:40] between the right and the wrong and no
[1:11:43] one can do it but the angel of the Lord.
[1:11:46] So let me say this. The only way for you
[1:11:48] to know what the air is today is to
[1:11:51] listen to the message of the hour.
[1:11:56] The only way for you to know how am I
[1:11:58] going to walk? What is God's requirement
[1:12:00] in the end time? What is it that I need
[1:12:02] to do is to listen to the word. And let
[1:12:05] me say this, the only way you can go
[1:12:07] into the rapture is to eat the word of
[1:12:10] God tonight. Yes sir.
[1:12:12] Now remember will say part of this angel
[1:12:16] when he will come the first thing he
[1:12:18] will do he will tie all the loose ends
[1:12:21] and the things that were left out. He
[1:12:23] will do all of those things. But the
[1:12:25] other part of what he was going to do is
[1:12:27] for him to reveal the mystery truth that
[1:12:30] were hidden. And the prophet will say in
[1:12:33] those mystery truth that's where you're
[1:12:35] going to find your rapturing faith.
[1:12:40] So we we don't want to take the word of
[1:12:42] man because the word of man will lead us
[1:12:44] astray. We want to make sure that as we
[1:12:47] come to church, as we come and whether
[1:12:49] we come to church or whether we home, we
[1:12:52] are falling in love with the revealed
[1:12:54] word of the hour that will produce what
[1:12:57] God wants it to produce in our lives.
[1:12:59] Amen.
[1:13:02] The the the the the problem with people
[1:13:05] the church and us today as an individual
[1:13:08] even the prophet will say I wonder if we
[1:13:10] are sufficiently impressed with the word
[1:13:12] in our midst. People will be impressed
[1:13:15] with people jumping up and down whether
[1:13:17] be the word or not the word they're not
[1:13:19] they they are not focused on the content
[1:13:22] they are focused on the delivery.
[1:13:26] The more I scream, oh, the more it's
[1:13:28] good. Now, it doesn't matter whether you
[1:13:31] scream or don't scream. The question is,
[1:13:34] is it the revealed word of the hour?
[1:13:40] God didn't make us all the same. He made
[1:13:42] some to be uh uh more uh uh enthusiastic
[1:13:46] than the other. But if there's one thing
[1:13:48] we need to stick on is that we all
[1:13:50] receive the word of God that will
[1:13:52] produce what God wants to produce in our
[1:13:54] lives.
[1:13:56] So he
[1:13:59] said, "But the angel of the
[1:14:02] Lord, sorry I'm running out of time, but
[1:14:05] he
[1:14:07] said he's the he's the one that is going
[1:14:11] to tell which is right, which is
[1:14:16] wrong." God said he will send his angel
[1:14:19] in the last time in the last times
[1:14:22] gather. It says no angel down through
[1:14:25] the uh down through here but but the
[1:14:28] angel at the last time and you will
[1:14:31] gather together. We know that this is
[1:14:34] the coming of that this is the coming
[1:14:37] harvest time. Now he says now an angel
[1:14:40] is actually interpreted as a messenger
[1:14:43] and we see that there is a seven angels
[1:14:46] of the seven churches now. It says now
[1:14:50] and through the church ages. So God as
[1:14:54] this angel come, he comes and he reveal
[1:14:57] the mystery truth which will come and
[1:15:00] will produce the rapturing faith. This
[1:15:02] angel and and he will come and and and
[1:15:06] he's the only one who will give you the
[1:15:09] very word of God for you to eat and
[1:15:12] mature into what God wants you to do.
[1:15:19] is the only one who has
[1:15:22] received the word that the angel of
[1:15:26] revelation chapter 10 when is
[1:15:29] descending. That book is given only to
[1:15:32] the seventh earthly messenger in order
[1:15:35] for him to give you and then for you to
[1:15:37] eat.
[1:15:41] And that seed word of God in you cannot
[1:15:45] grow by anything except that word.
[1:15:52] And the reason why I'm trying to connect
[1:15:54] this is
[1:15:55] because I we we live in a time where the
[1:15:59] the people I don't know what the motive
[1:16:02] is but people want uh to be known you
[1:16:06] know they will come and and and each one
[1:16:09] has their own doctrine their own
[1:16:10] presentation and and they will come and
[1:16:13] they will put emphasis on this and you
[1:16:15] know as our pastor was saying and some
[1:16:17] will come and say Oh, it's the gift. And
[1:16:19] some will say, "Oh, it's the bride
[1:16:21] coming and it's this." It's the entire
[1:16:24] revealed word of God. It's the seven
[1:16:26] course meal that we've been presented
[1:16:28] with. We eat what we have need of. You
[1:16:31] don't you don't eat vitamin H when you
[1:16:34] need vitamin D. You go in there and you
[1:16:37] eat of the vitamin that you need in
[1:16:39] order for you to be strengthened. But
[1:16:40] you're not going to eat one vitamin and
[1:16:42] live out the other. You want to eat the
[1:16:44] whole word of God. When the lamb was
[1:16:46] given, it was to eat the whole lamb.
[1:16:53] If the first rapture or if I'll call it
[1:16:56] the first exodus, they had to eat the
[1:16:58] whole lamb and live
[1:17:00] nothing. We have to eat the whole lamb.
[1:17:04] We have to eat the whole book. And
[1:17:07] that's the only way we can produce the
[1:17:10] very son of God.
[1:17:19] But what I'm going to
[1:17:23] say, it says, notice, I believe
[1:17:26] paragraph 20. I'm not sure if it's the
[1:17:28] same message. It says, notice who said
[1:17:32] that the soul worry. He also said that
[1:17:35] the soul was the son of God.
[1:17:38] who went forth and sow and the enemy
[1:17:40] came behind
[1:17:41] him which was the devil and he saw the
[1:17:44] seed of the the seed of discrepancy
[1:17:46] behind uh the sew a right uh the behind
[1:17:49] the sewing of the the right seed. It
[1:17:52] says, "Now
[1:17:53] friends, that has happened
[1:17:56] throughout through every church age
[1:17:59] since we've had the word."
[1:18:02] Exactly. All the way from the beginning,
[1:18:06] it started the very same
[1:18:08] thing. It says, "Now, he said the seed
[1:18:11] of God, the word of God, Jesus says it's
[1:18:15] certain. It's a certain place." It said
[1:18:17] that the word is a seed. Now I want you
[1:18:22] to follow this. And every seed will
[1:18:26] bring forth of its kind. And now if the
[1:18:31] Christian, the child of God, the the the
[1:18:34] children of of the kingdom has become
[1:18:37] the seed of God, then there must be the
[1:18:41] word of God. Amen. I want you to think
[1:18:45] about that.
[1:18:46] The word of God manifested in this age.
[1:18:50] They are the living one. They are living
[1:18:53] in for the promised seed of the age of
[1:18:56] that age. God gave his word to the uh at
[1:19:00] the beginning and each age has had its
[1:19:03] seed its its time its promise. Now Noah
[1:19:08] Noah came on the scene. He was the seed.
[1:19:12] It was the seed of God. the word of God
[1:19:16] for that age. When Moses come, he could
[1:19:19] not be with Noah's message. It wouldn't
[1:19:22] work because he was the seed of God at
[1:19:26] that time. Then with Christ, when Christ
[1:19:30] came, he could not come with Noah or
[1:19:33] Moses age. He w he says it was it was in
[1:19:37] his time. It was his time. A virgin a
[1:19:41] virgin to conceive and bring forth a
[1:19:43] son. he would uh uh he would be the uh
[1:19:46] the Messiah. It says now we've lived
[1:19:50] through
[1:19:51] Luther, Wesley's age, Methodist age, all
[1:19:55] down through the ages and the
[1:19:57] Pentecostal ages. And each age is given
[1:20:00] a promise of the word and the people of
[1:20:04] that age, the manifest that that
[1:20:07] manifest that promised word is the seed
[1:20:11] of that age.
[1:20:13] Let me say this. You are the word of
[1:20:15] this age. You are the promise of this
[1:20:18] age. You say how the prophets say that
[1:20:21] they shall be an overcomer in this age.
[1:20:24] You are here because that word is coming
[1:20:26] into
[1:20:27] manifestation. You are here because
[1:20:30] remember the seed is not called to
[1:20:32] remain seed but is called to bring into
[1:20:35] manifestation. So if God said there will
[1:20:37] be an overcomer, somebody has to eat the
[1:20:40] word. Somebody has to be called out from
[1:20:43] denomination. Somebody has to be called
[1:20:45] out from sin. That word has to come into
[1:20:49] manifestation. So when we eat of the
[1:20:51] word, when we came, when he brought us
[1:20:53] out of sin, when he cleans us from our
[1:20:55] sin, what is he doing? Is showing unto
[1:20:58] you. So you will know that you are the
[1:21:01] seed of in this age. Why? Because you
[1:21:04] are becoming the manifestation of what
[1:21:06] was spoken of.
[1:21:11] But it's not the flesh. He has nothing
[1:21:13] to do with the
[1:21:16] flesh. You think in the state that you
[1:21:19] were in that if someone came and he told
[1:21:22] your flesh and said, "I'm going to get
[1:21:25] you out of sin," the flesh was going to
[1:21:26] say, "Yes, do
[1:21:30] that." The flesh was enjoying it.
[1:21:35] The seed was miserable. Right? The seed
[1:21:38] kept asking question. The flesh was
[1:21:40] there and partaking of the things of the
[1:21:43] world and all of that, but the seed was
[1:21:45] miserable. So God brings his word to
[1:21:48] pass or God uh uh uh uh he he he takes
[1:21:52] his own word and he brings it to pass.
[1:21:55] Now he has to do it for you so you can
[1:21:58] know his word is a reality. So God
[1:22:01] cannot say there will be an overcomer at
[1:22:03] this age and we are here all in sin and
[1:22:06] say oh yeah that's true. No somebody has
[1:22:09] to manifest the word. Somebody has to
[1:22:12] show that the word is true. Somebody has
[1:22:14] to show that this word will come to
[1:22:16] pass. Let me say this. It's the same
[1:22:18] word that brought you out of sin. It's
[1:22:21] the same. Why did he bring you out of
[1:22:23] sin? He's not going to take you and make
[1:22:25] you a Christian overnight and and you go
[1:22:27] to a rapture the next day. No, he has to
[1:22:30] take you through the stages so you can
[1:22:32] know that what you have received is the
[1:22:34] truth. What is it? It's the Holy Spirit
[1:22:38] working and bringing the word of God
[1:22:40] into manifestation into your life. Amen.
[1:22:44] So you would know the benefits of what
[1:22:47] it is to eat of the word of God.
[1:22:53] I feel like sometimes we forget the very
[1:22:56] benefit of that word.
[1:23:00] Our conversion came by hearing somebody
[1:23:04] speak. But Ram says you you heard
[1:23:07] somebody even I I remember sitting there
[1:23:09] you hearing the word and and you were
[1:23:12] probably not even paying
[1:23:16] attention. I don't even remember what I
[1:23:18] was hearing. But I didn't know what I
[1:23:21] was hearing until I went somewhere else
[1:23:23] and heard something else. I said, "This
[1:23:26] doesn't sound like it. That sounded a
[1:23:29] lot better." Amen.
[1:23:34] What was it? It was the word spoken.
[1:23:37] That word contacted the seed and he
[1:23:40] began to bring the seed into maturity.
[1:23:43] He began to bring the seed into birth.
[1:23:45] What was he doing? He was showing you
[1:23:48] that the word, my word, is a reality. My
[1:23:52] word will provide you the nutrients. My
[1:23:55] word will give you the vitamins. My word
[1:23:57] will give you everything that you have
[1:24:00] need of so you can be the giant that can
[1:24:03] overcome sin.
[1:24:06] But but what I'm saying it talks about
[1:24:08] Jesus. He says he came and he said it is
[1:24:11] written. Now this is the most gifted man
[1:24:14] that there was on earth.
[1:24:18] the most gifted man that there was on
[1:24:21] earth. He could point his finger and and
[1:24:24] cause the enemy to disappear if he
[1:24:26] wanted to. He could speak a word and the
[1:24:30] whole place will change and he could
[1:24:32] even as the devil was tempting him. But
[1:24:34] brother said he knew that there will be
[1:24:37] others that will come like him. They may
[1:24:40] not be gifted as he was. And he knew the
[1:24:43] only thing that he could give them is
[1:24:45] the word. Why? Because if they can use
[1:24:47] the same word, they will overcome.
[1:24:50] And he looked at the devil and he says,
[1:24:53] "It is written." Now, my question to you
[1:24:55] is, where was he written? That's right.
[1:24:59] What was he quoting? He was letting the
[1:25:02] devil know the original intention of
[1:25:05] what God created men for. I'm here to
[1:25:08] represent that. Man was not made to be
[1:25:12] under your rule. made was not made to
[1:25:14] fall by you. It is written. In other
[1:25:17] word, before I can show up here, there
[1:25:20] was a decision made up in heaven. There
[1:25:22] was a word that was spoken and I'm here
[1:25:25] to represent that word. So when you say
[1:25:27] it is written, you are quoting the
[1:25:30] original word, the original intention
[1:25:33] that God wanted with his word.
[1:25:39] Satan perverted it by education, science
[1:25:43] and others. Now we say when we say the
[1:25:46] word we can't see far past our
[1:25:50] hands. When we
[1:25:52] speak in our
[1:25:54] mind we are seeing the conversion just
[1:25:58] of our circumstance that we are
[1:26:01] in. That's not going to work. What? When
[1:26:05] you speak the word, you are calling for
[1:26:08] the authority of God, the original plan
[1:26:11] of God that was in the beginning to come
[1:26:14] and be manifested in your life.
[1:26:17] It's not just so you can overcome a
[1:26:19] temporary circumstance. It's so that you
[1:26:22] can summon. You said, "I'm finding
[1:26:25] myself this before this circumstance,
[1:26:27] and I know that God said it is written
[1:26:29] in his word, and I can quote that Bible.
[1:26:32] I can quote that word and see the same
[1:26:35] intention that God had in the beginning
[1:26:38] come and be
[1:26:42] manifested. The prophet will say that's
[1:26:45] why he told us he said the word of God
[1:26:47] will overcome the devil under any
[1:26:48] circumstance any place.
[1:26:52] Why? Because whatever circumstance you
[1:26:55] are in, that word will come and be there
[1:26:57] and come and be manifested for what God
[1:27:01] spoke it to
[1:27:02] be. The living word of God, the bread of
[1:27:06] life. If the musician could
[1:27:09] come, the original
[1:27:12] intention of God speaking and us walking
[1:27:15] into that
[1:27:23] manifestation. I've always marveled
[1:27:26] about Jesus
[1:27:32] and the very God of creation himself.
[1:27:39] He didn't have a place to lay his
[1:27:42] head. He was so
[1:27:46] reliant on
[1:27:48] God that he didn't have a
[1:27:51] house. He didn't know what his next meal
[1:27:54] was going to be. He knew that the proud
[1:27:57] father will
[1:28:02] provide. But yeah, we are and we have
[1:28:06] jobs, we have cars, we have savings.
[1:28:08] Something will happen and oh my savings
[1:28:12] is going to go away. The stock market is
[1:28:14] going
[1:28:16] down. Oh, how am I going to pay my
[1:28:20] bills? He perfectly laid himself in the
[1:28:24] word every bit of what he was.
[1:28:29] Now the prophet said that the only
[1:28:31] difference between him and Nazi says now
[1:28:33] he had an understanding because he
[1:28:35] didn't bapt bypass the theophony. He had
[1:28:38] the original intention of God within him
[1:28:40] and he knew that God will keep his
[1:28:43] word. But we bypass that to be tempted.
[1:28:46] But in the end time the original mind
[1:28:48] has been revealed to us.
[1:28:52] So we have no excuse.
[1:28:57] We saw one walk among us who didn't care
[1:29:01] where what's going to happen and who
[1:29:03] didn't care whatever circumstance he
[1:29:05] found himself in. Who knew that the
[1:29:07] father will take care of it no matter
[1:29:09] what. He came and he showed us the first
[1:29:11] fruit. The first fruit not of the one
[1:29:13] that came from heaven but one that was
[1:29:15] born from sin. So we can look and have a
[1:29:21] representation. Yes sir.
[1:29:25] confidence in the word.
[1:29:29] God cannot speak a word and see that go
[1:29:32] in vain. And I'm not speaking I believe
[1:29:35] when I say the word, we constantly think
[1:29:37] about the pages of this. I'm talking
[1:29:39] about you. I'm talking about God's
[1:29:42] desire to see things happen. I'm talking
[1:29:45] about what God purposed in his mind to
[1:29:47] happen.
[1:29:49] This is just a record of the things
[1:29:51] which he said. And one of them that he
[1:29:53] said that he will have an overcomer at
[1:29:55] the end time. That's why he could stand
[1:29:57] up and say when the weakest Christian
[1:29:59] when he gets on his knees the whole hell
[1:30:01] trembles.
[1:30:03] Those are not uh uh great sounding words
[1:30:07] so we could just claim them. Those are
[1:30:10] the reality of the living God into the
[1:30:13] life of a believer. Hallelujah. Those
[1:30:16] are not buzz words so we can hear and
[1:30:19] say, "Oh, I've heard that before." No,
[1:30:22] that is a promise. That is the reality
[1:30:24] of God. That is God in action.
[1:30:34] But it can only
[1:30:35] come by the bread word of
[1:30:39] God. Not by
[1:30:41] imagination, not by
[1:30:43] feelings, but by the word, seed word,
[1:30:47] bread word. I'm eating it. And as as as
[1:30:51] much as the natural will produce, as
[1:30:54] much as the spiritual will also produce,
[1:30:57] I can wake up. It doesn't matter whether
[1:31:00] I feel I'm in heaven or I feel like I'm
[1:31:03] standing before the devil himself. As
[1:31:05] long as his word is in my heart, I know
[1:31:08] I will overcome
[1:31:12] because his ne his word will never fail.
[1:31:15] He said if Jesus will go to the cross
[1:31:19] over a backsliding prophet promise and
[1:31:22] he will knew that God will not keep his
[1:31:25] righteous one in hell or he will not let
[1:31:28] corruption touch his body. How much more
[1:31:31] we that have seen the resurrection of
[1:31:33] Jesus Christ. You say we've seen the
[1:31:35] resurrection. Yeah. You are the very
[1:31:37] proof of that resurrection.
[1:31:40] Let me say that without that
[1:31:42] resurrection you couldn't live right.
[1:31:44] You couldn't talk right. We are the very
[1:31:47] proof of that resurrection. Why? Because
[1:31:49] we see it manifested every day.
[1:31:55] And he didn't stop there. He came and
[1:31:58] gave you the very book. It says every
[1:32:01] promise in the book is yours. You saw me
[1:32:04] speak, now you speak.
[1:32:07] The problem with men is we constantly
[1:32:10] look for human leadership. You know, we
[1:32:13] want somebody to be there and to be the
[1:32:15] one doing the speaking and we'll just
[1:32:17] what? No, that those times are over.
[1:32:20] That was in the seven church ages. In
[1:32:22] the end time when he came and he
[1:32:24] revealed himself, he changed the
[1:32:26] leadership from that to the leadership
[1:32:28] of the Holy Spirit where God himself
[1:32:31] will lead you in your heart will talk to
[1:32:35] you and take this word and make it a
[1:32:37] reality to you.
[1:32:43] He doesn't want us to get excited to
[1:32:45] some some men's teaching
[1:32:48] after you've gotten all the
[1:32:50] intellectuals. You walk away exactly the
[1:32:52] same way you came. What good is that
[1:32:55] for?
[1:32:56] But the seed
[1:32:58] word, bread word will produce what God
[1:33:02] promised it will produce. Let's not
[1:33:04] stray away from it. Let's hold it in
[1:33:07] high regard. Let's not get tired of it.
[1:33:10] Let's eat it every day. And I guarantee
[1:33:13] you as you eat naturally and it will
[1:33:16] produce, this spiritual bread will bring
[1:33:18] himself to come to pass. Let's all
[1:33:20] stand.
[1:33:31] [Music]
[1:33:35] Man, I trust it was something said that
[1:33:37] would encourage your heart tonight. Then
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:33:46] [Music]
[1:33:50] I don't know about you,
[1:33:56] but my heart is just not looking for
[1:33:58] excitement
[1:34:01] anymore. The days of excitement have
[1:34:04] come and gone.
[1:34:06] The days of the thunder is come and
[1:34:09] gone. And the day of the strong wind is
[1:34:12] come and gone. And we live in the day of
[1:34:15] the still small
[1:34:16] voice. It's years. So he himself can
[1:34:19] lead his church. And and I don't want to
[1:34:22] get caught in anything except his own
[1:34:24] word. Him speaking. He said that angel
[1:34:28] will come and he will show you the way.
[1:34:29] And he will come and he will tell you
[1:34:32] what would be right, what's going to be
[1:34:34] wrong. I don't want to be caught up in
[1:34:36] anything. I want to just eat the bread
[1:34:38] and let it walk. Eat the bread and let
[1:34:41] it be manifested. Eat the bread and let
[1:34:43] it lead me. I want to see within my own
[1:34:46] body, my own flesh, my own spirit. I
[1:34:49] want to see that word continually
[1:34:52] manifested. That's my heart desire.
[1:34:54] Let's just bow our
[1:34:55] heads. Our gracious
[1:34:59] father, we're so thankful for all that
[1:35:02] you do for us, Lord.
[1:35:07] Lord, you said that men shall not live
[1:35:10] by bread alone, but by every word that
[1:35:12] proceeded out of the mouth of
[1:35:16] God. Lord, and tonight we came here, I
[1:35:19] believe we were gathered here to just
[1:35:22] hear you speak through us and that
[1:35:23] bread.
[1:35:25] And Father God,
[1:35:28] and I could just speak for myself
[1:35:31] sometimes. I'm so hungry, Lord.
[1:35:35] [Music]
[1:35:36] And father, hungry for the manifestation
[1:35:39] of what you promised, Lord.
[1:35:43] And and I just don't want to be caught
[1:35:45] up with within the understanding of
[1:35:48] men's intellect, but I want that reality
[1:35:50] of the word that you promised to come to
[1:35:52] pass.
[1:35:56] I pray tonight Lord as we gather here
[1:35:59] Lord
[1:36:00] and perhaps spoken with the intention
[1:36:03] that we should keep our focus only on
[1:36:05] what you said you would do Lord
[1:36:08] [Music]
[1:36:09] and with the intention Father that if
[1:36:12] you made a promise you're going to keep
[1:36:15] it with the intention that the scripture
[1:36:19] says you will hear today behold is here
[1:36:21] behold is there it says don't
[1:36:26] know that you promise just as the sun
[1:36:29] will rise and it sets that's the same
[1:36:31] way you will do with your word oh God as
[1:36:34] sure as we see you manifested within the
[1:36:37] natural things that you will do it in
[1:36:39] the spiritual
[1:36:41] also father I pray that you move us by
[1:36:44] your spirit and fill us with your holy
[1:36:47] ghost oh God that we may walk by the way
[1:36:49] which you have provided Lord forgive our
[1:36:52] shortcomings ings if we find ourself
[1:36:54] astray from the place which you've
[1:36:57] called us Lord and that we may focus on
[1:37:00] one thing only Lord and that is which
[1:37:02] that which you have promised Lord we
[1:37:04] commit everything to you Lord and I pray
[1:37:07] father even for those requests that we
[1:37:09] write tonight and and if there be any
[1:37:12] sick among us Lord I pray that you may
[1:37:14] just go by the way oh God and Father
[1:37:17] touch them and heal the body and the
[1:37:19] spirit that they may know that your word
[1:37:21] is a reality oh God, you promise that
[1:37:24] you will interpret your word in the
[1:37:26] hearts of the believer by bringing it to
[1:37:28] come to pass. And our desire is to see
[1:37:31] you manifested every day and bringing
[1:37:34] your word to come to pass. Lord, we love
[1:37:37] you tonight. We commit everything we are
[1:37:38] to you. We remember our pastor, Lord,
[1:37:40] and we pray that you just touch his
[1:37:43] body, Lord, and make him well. And Lord,
[1:37:45] restore his strength. And Lord, we
[1:37:48] remember all of those that couldn't be
[1:37:50] here, Lord.
[1:37:51] Father, our heart's desire as your
[1:37:53] children is always to walk in the way
[1:37:55] that thou has
[1:37:57] made to live the life that's worthy of
[1:38:00] the gospel that we have
[1:38:02] received. We thank you and commit
[1:38:04] everything that we are and ask this in
[1:38:06] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:38:09] Amen. Amen. Let's just sing now.

[1:40:11] [Music]
[1:40:12] came back living in Jesus for there was
[1:40:18] power in his
[1:40:22] [Music]

[1:48:14] Hallelujah. Ask brother Daniel to come
[1:48:16] and pray for us. Close out the service.
[1:48:26] Let's bow our
[1:48:28] heads. Heavenly Father, Lord God,
[1:48:30] believe we can all truly say, Lord, it
[1:48:32] was a blessing to be in your house of
[1:48:33] worship this evening, Lord, to hear the
[1:48:35] words of life that were given, Lord, and
[1:48:37] just the words of encouragement, Lord,
[1:48:39] telling us that, Father Lord, that what
[1:48:41] we see right now is not who we are, Lord
[1:48:43] God. But, Lord, the word that was spoken
[1:48:45] about us, Lord, is what we will be,
[1:48:47] Father Lord. And it won't be by us, but
[1:48:48] it will be by you, Lord God. By your
[1:48:50] power and by your might, Lord. And I
[1:48:52] just pray that, Father, we take the
[1:48:54] words that we heard tonight, Lord. And
[1:48:55] we don't just let it sit in the pew or
[1:48:57] just stay in the sanctuary, bro. We take
[1:48:59] it and and apply to our lives, Father
[1:49:01] Lord. And that we put it within
[1:49:02] ourselves, Father, and live it every
[1:49:04] single day, Lord God. That Lord, we
[1:49:06] would overcome day by day, Lord, and
[1:49:08] fulfill the word day by day, Lord God,
[1:49:09] and take the word in its entirety, Lord
[1:49:11] God, and just apply it to our lives. I
[1:49:14] pray and ask that you would just bless
[1:49:15] us as we go out of here, Lord God. That
[1:49:16] your word would stay with us. That your
[1:49:18] spirit would linger around us, Lord.
[1:49:20] That Lord, even when we throughout the
[1:49:22] rest of this week and we come back
[1:49:23] Sunday, that Lord, we would have
[1:49:24] testimonies to tell each other and just
[1:49:26] wonderful fellowship with one another.
[1:49:27] Lord, I pray and ask that your word
[1:49:29] would just take manifest and take
[1:49:31] prereeminence in our lives every single
[1:49:33] day. That you're the first thing in our
[1:49:34] minds and in our hearts, Lord. That we
[1:49:36] continue to serve you with all that we
[1:49:37] have. I just commit this to you and our
[1:49:39] Lord God and just bless each and every
[1:49:41] heart that gathered and that was able to
[1:49:43] listen in as well. We commit to you now
[1:49:44] in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:49:47] Hallelujah.
[1:49:51] Let's sing this song. The song of this
[1:49:53] missile. My hope is
[1:49:56] built on nothing
[1:50:00] less than Jesus
[1:50:03] blood and righteousness.

[1:50:28] built on

[1:50:36] blood and
[1:50:41] righteousness, I dare not
[1:50:44] trust the sweetest praise.

[1:52:18] Savior and through the
[1:52:23] sword. He is
[1:52:27] Lord, Lord of all. His oath, his
[1:52:31] covenant. Oh, when his old days
[1:52:36] come and let his
[1:52:41] blood for
[1:52:44] me the welling
[1:52:49] flame all
[1:52:52] around my soul give way.
