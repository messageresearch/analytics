[37:45] &gt;&gt; and u if you don't mind I just want to
[37:47] if you can guys could please brothers
[37:49] put the first Corinthian I want to read
[37:51] for you
[37:52] &gt;&gt; because when you when you read
[37:54] &gt;&gt; and you you just visuals you can put on
[37:57] your heart
[37:59] &gt;&gt; and that was that will be the to be the
[38:01] moral for this church for our body and
[38:03] their love of God.
[38:06] Their love of God, you know, so so many
[38:10] times we you know we just try to say it
[38:13] and we just try to you know uh uh figure
[38:16] out how to we can you know travel how we
[38:19] can do and so many times we are so many
[38:22] confusion in this world. So I want to I
[38:25] want to say a illustration which I want
[38:28] to understand how how the humanity they
[38:32] are how we can see. So that illustration
[38:34] say a man has a very very big house
[38:39] and uh with a twotory 10 bedrooms in a
[38:44] very beautiful morning when the sun is
[38:46] up somebody knock on the door.
[38:49] So when he opens the door,
[38:52] he saw Jesus Christ on that door. And
[38:56] Jesus says say, "Hey, are you willing?
[38:59] Do you want me to come inside of your
[39:00] house?" You say, "Yes, Lord." Lord
[39:03] Jesus, I want you. I want be, you know,
[39:05] at my house.
[39:07] And uh he said, "I have the best room on
[39:10] my house. I will offer you their room
[39:13] for you." Okay. The second day, somebody
[39:17] else knock on his door.
[39:19] So when he go to open the door,
[39:23] he was another one. He doesn't ask him
[39:26] to go to come in. He doesn't he he was
[39:30] not a gentleman. He just forced the door
[39:33] when he saw the person the Satan on that
[39:35] door. He was pushing back. He doesn't
[39:38] want it to be there, but he forced it.
[39:42] So after a while he fight with the you
[39:45] know Satan and he closed the door and he
[39:49] said wow what I'm fighting for my Jesus
[39:53] is in my house
[39:55] &gt;&gt; why I'm what I'm doing
[39:57] &gt;&gt; why what I'm fighting he went up and say
[40:01] Lord Jesus I just fight right now I
[40:04] Satan come to my door and say I'm sorry
[40:07] I can't do nothing for you you give me
[40:09] one room only
[40:11] &gt;&gt; you Give me one room. Oh, you want more
[40:13] space? Yes, I want more space. Okay, I
[40:15] give you the second level. All All is
[40:18] yours. Second day again.
[40:21] This evil spirit is coming every day to
[40:24] bother you.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; Okay. So again, he's fighting. He's
[40:27] fighting. He He's closing that door
[40:29] finally. And he's remember again, oh
[40:32] Jesus is in my house. Okay. Run again.
[40:35] Lord again this coming to my house. I
[40:38] fight for that. Why you don't help me? I
[40:41] can't. I can't. You are the owner.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; You You You give me just the second
[40:47] floor. You want more?
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, I want more.
[40:52] &gt;&gt; And the man takes it, give the keys.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; That's our heart.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; My illustration is to understand how
[41:00] much you are willing to give from your
[41:03] heart, from your life. He to be your
[41:07] owner. You have to sell out yourself.
[41:11] And when the Satan come the third day to
[41:13] his house, he tried to go to the door
[41:16] and open the door. Say, "Oh, I don't
[41:17] have the key anymore."
[41:20] &gt;&gt; I don't have the key. I can't open the
[41:22] door anymore.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus went to the door and
[41:26] opened the door, they able say, "Oh, I'm
[41:29] sorry. I'm in the wrong house."
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; That's the power of God.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; That's the way how we depending on God.
[41:39] That's the way how we offer our heart.
[41:42] If we just put him in one room upstairs,
[41:46] it's not going to help us. If just think
[41:49] about it, we just have in our mind, oh,
[41:51] I have Jesus somewhere in that room, so
[41:53] I'm saved. Oh, I give him the whole, you
[41:56] know, the whole second floor. I'm saved.
[41:58] I'm okay. No, we have to sell out
[42:01] everything what is in us. We have to
[42:03] give the we have to give him the key of
[42:06] our heart, our life and everything has
[42:09] to be dependable on him.
[42:13] That's the way you know. So we just you
[42:16] know I I don't want to be long but I
[42:18] just want to read this moral for this
[42:22] church. The love is the most important
[42:26] in our life in our family in our
[42:29] community in our church. Not only words
[42:32] that you can't declare how much you want
[42:35] it.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; You love a person, you love somebody if
[42:38] you don't prove their love.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; Doesn't have any anything to do.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; The words is just
[42:46] &gt;&gt; words.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Action is telling more than what we
[42:50] speaking, what we telling about
[42:52] something.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; So when we love each other, we forgive
[42:56] each other. We give everything what we
[42:59] have for for the for your brother for
[43:01] your sister. We pray for them.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; If you remember when I start first to
[43:06] pray to preach when God was here, I have
[43:09] three question to the church. Do you
[43:12] remember?
[43:15] So I don't want to give names but God is
[43:18] working and I know 100% God will working
[43:22] continue you know like continuous.
[43:25] So he's on he's working he's preparing
[43:28] our soul he's preparing our he's molding
[43:31] us every day every day he's molding us.
[43:34] So if I'm not okay so let's let's read
[43:38] together or I I I read though I speak
[43:42] with the tongues of men of an angel
[43:46] &gt;&gt; and I have no charity I'm become
[43:49] sounding brass
[43:50] &gt;&gt; or a tinkling symbol.
[43:57] And though I have the gift of the
[43:59] prophecy and understanding all the
[44:02] mystery and the knowledge, and though I
[44:05] have of all faith so that I can remove
[44:08] mountains and have not charity, I am
[44:13] nothing.
[44:16] And though I best bestow all my goods to
[44:20] feed the poor, and though I give my body
[44:23] to be burned and have not charity, it
[44:27] profited me nothing.
[44:30] Charity suffer long and is kind. Charity
[44:34] is a not charity bounded not itself is
[44:40] not puffed up.
[44:44] not behave itself unseemly seeking not
[44:49] her own. It's not easily provoked,
[44:53] &gt;&gt; thinking naive.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Can you listen that?
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Rejoined not in inequity, but re
[45:01] rejoiced in the truth.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Beareth all things, believe all things,
[45:09] hope all things, endure all things.
[45:13] Charity never fail. But what whatever
[45:17] there be prophecy, they shall fail.
[45:22] Neither there be tongues, they shall
[45:25] cease.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Where there be knowledge, it shall
[45:29] vanish away.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; For for we know in part, and we prophecy
[45:34] in part.
[45:36] But when that which is a perfect
[45:40] &gt;&gt; is come then that which is in part shall
[45:45] be done away. Amen. God bless you my
[45:49] brother. Uh I bless you in the name of
[45:52] Lord Jesus Christ and u
[45:56] I want to appreciate every every love
[45:58] every prayer which you guys doing for
[46:00] us. And uh I I'm I said I will be part
[46:05] of body of Christ in in us. So the the
[46:09] Bible said like a sign we are a brother
[46:13] and sister. You will love each other.
[46:16] That's the proof. That's the proof. We
[46:19] are the apostle. We are the you know
[46:22] God's kids if we love each other. God
[46:25] bless you brother. God bless you.
[46:30] [Applause]
[46:35] Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's all stand.

[46:39] time. Amen. Key of F. Let's sing that
[46:43] song. To know what it's like. Amen.

[50:57] [Music]
[51:07] Gracious father,
[51:10] where else could we go?
[51:16] The only place safe
[51:18] is in the mighty rock.
[51:21] [Music]
[51:22] Father, hide us in the cliff of the
[51:24] rock.
[51:25] [Music]
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Encamp your angels about us and help us,
[51:32] Lord. We pray.
[51:35] We want to stay, Father, in this word.
[51:39] We want to stay in the spirit of the
[51:42] capstone, the love our brother spoke.
[51:46] Lord, we want to have it to all that we
[51:48] come in contact that the love of God may
[51:52] be shed abroad in our heart by the Holy
[51:55] Spirit,
[51:57] Father, that we be a burning light that
[51:59] the people would know that no matter how
[52:02] dark it is, we have hope
[52:06] because we have someone that laid his
[52:09] life down for us.
[52:11] And we just ask, Father, that this
[52:14] evening as we
[52:16] fellowship with our brother and let him
[52:19] know we'll be praying for him and ask
[52:22] you to bless his endeavor, Father, that
[52:26] he would prosper and be in good health,
[52:29] Father, as you're leading him in this
[52:32] great direction.
[52:34] Father, we want him to know that we go
[52:37] with them. Though we're absent in the
[52:40] flesh, we'll be ever present in spirit.
[52:43] We ask you to be with us this evening
[52:46] now in Jesus precious and holy name we
[52:50] pray. Amen. And amen. God bless you. May
[52:54] be seated this evening. We won't be long
[52:58] because we don't uh we want to have our
[53:01] little time of fellowship together. But
[53:04] so I thought what I would do is share
[53:07] with you my schedule
[53:10] uh that's lying ahead for us and then u
[53:14] you can keep us in prayer as we take our
[53:18] journey and then I'd like to share some
[53:21] scriptures uh what is been on my heart
[53:25] for uh this trip and for this year. So,
[53:31] we leave Tuesday
[53:33] um the 29th of July around 5:00 and we
[53:39] uh fly to Paris
[53:41] and then we have a hour and 50 minute
[53:44] layover in Paris and then we fly to
[53:48] Kenasa and we arrive Wednesday the 30th
[53:53] about 6:00 pm
[53:55] and then the 31st is a down day for us.
[53:58] So we'll try to adjust
[54:01] to the time uh there. And then uh Friday
[54:06] uh morning August 1,
[54:09] we preach the morning service in
[54:13] Kenshasa at brother Amy's uh dedication
[54:16] service. And then uh Saturday a 3rd
[54:23] uh or no Saturday August 2nd we preach
[54:27] the evening service and then Sunday
[54:31] August 3rd whatever part that we play in
[54:34] the dedication
[54:36] and then uh Monday morning which is
[54:40] August 4th at 12:50 a.m.
[54:44] So, if you can put that together, that's
[54:46] it. 10 to one. Now, I didn't know
[54:51] I I thought I was leaving like
[54:55] Monday night to me is Monday night, but
[55:00] 050
[55:02] is Monday,
[55:04] but it's real early Monday. In fact, I
[55:07] don't think you can get any earlier than
[55:09] that. But anyway, so obviously we're not
[55:13] going to go to bed Sunday night, so we
[55:16] have to get to the airport. And then we
[55:17] fly Monday morning at at 12:50 a.m. Uh
[55:23] we fly to Harrari by way of
[55:26] Johannesburg.
[55:27] And then we arrive in Johannesburg
[55:30] Monday, August 4th at 11:57.
[55:35] And then uh so we'll settle there. And
[55:38] then Tuesday, August uh 5th, we preach
[55:42] for brother uh Amos. And then Wednesday
[55:46] the August 6, we fly to Vic Falls and
[55:50] we'll have fellowship and service with
[55:53] believers there. And then uh Thursday,
[55:58] August 7th, we fly to Balo.
[56:01] And then Friday, August 8th, we preach
[56:04] the evening service. And Saturday,
[56:08] uh August 9th, we preach Saturday
[56:11] evening. And then Sunday, August 10th,
[56:15] uh we preach uh uh Sunday morning and
[56:20] Sunday evening. And then Monday the
[56:24] 11th, we fly back to Harrari and preach
[56:28] uh uh to for brother uh Godwin uh Monday
[56:34] evening. So I'm going to preach for
[56:37] Bongai's uncle and sister Esther's dad.
[56:41] And uh so I got to cover my bases. You
[56:44] know how that that goes. And then uh so
[56:48] Wednesday then we fly from Johannesburg
[56:50] to Paris and my good friend Billy over
[56:54] here is trying to get me services in uh
[56:58] Paris and in Belgium. So whatever he
[57:01] lines up, I'll take care of that. He
[57:03] said, "Well, you got to go preach in
[57:05] Belgium." I said, "Why won't I preach in
[57:06] Belgium?" He says, "Because I've got
[57:08] friends there."
[57:11] So, we'll probably preach in Paris and
[57:14] Belgium and then probably try to get
[57:16] home around the 19th or 20th. Uh I was
[57:21] going to try to stretch it to September
[57:23] so my prophecy would come through, but
[57:26] uh that we're not we're not going to do
[57:30] that. But anyway, so we've got about 11
[57:33] services, 12 services, and uh you know,
[57:37] just to uh just really express to you
[57:42] what's on my heart and uh what it is, I
[57:46] think the best way to do that is let us
[57:48] stand and turn in our Bibles to uh
[57:53] uh
[57:57] Exodus the 14th chapter.
[58:01] and start with the 10th verse. And
[58:08] this is in Exodus. And the people have
[58:10] come out. And we know that Israel is a
[58:15] type of the church.
[58:18] And so you can look at this personally.
[58:22] You can look at it from from the
[58:24] standpoint of the church. But I think
[58:27] that that we can see uh where we are and
[58:32] the battles that we face. And so it says
[58:35] this, "And when Pharaoh drew nigh
[58:39] because now the children of Israel has
[58:41] left, they've come across and now
[58:43] they've reached the the Dead Sea and I
[58:47] mean not the Dead Sea, they've they've
[58:48] reached the um the Gulf there, that
[58:52] river where they're going to cross. And
[58:54] when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of
[58:57] Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold,
[59:00] the Egyptians marched after them, and
[59:04] they were sore afraid, and the children
[59:07] of Israel cried out unto the Lord.
[59:11] And they said unto Moses, because there
[59:15] were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken
[59:19] us away to die in the wilderness,
[59:24] wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us,
[59:29] to carry us forth out of Egypt?
[59:33] Is not this the word that we did tell
[59:38] thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone
[59:42] that we may serve the Egyptians, for it
[59:46] had been better for us to serve the
[59:48] Egyptians than that we should die in the
[59:53] wilderness.
[59:55] And Moses said unto the people, "Fear ye
[59:59] not, stand still,
[1:00:02] and see the salvation of the Lord, which
[1:00:06] he will show
[1:00:09] to you today. For the Egyptians whom ye
[1:00:14] have seen today, ye shall see them again
[1:00:19] no more forever."
[1:00:23] And the Lord shall fight for you, and ye
[1:00:27] shall hold your peace.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said unto Moses, "Wherefore
[1:00:34] criest th out unto me? Speak unto the
[1:00:39] children of Israel
[1:00:41] that they go forward."
[1:00:45] Heavenly Father, we ask you to bless
[1:00:48] your word. Amen. You may be seated.
[1:00:55] I think we all can say that
[1:00:59] uh we certainly know what it is to have
[1:01:03] that Egyptian devil pursue us. He'll try
[1:01:07] to fight us in our body to make us sick.
[1:01:10] He'll try to fight us financially.
[1:01:14] He he'll he'll always try to make it out
[1:01:18] that it would have been better if we
[1:01:19] would have just stayed in the world and
[1:01:23] and serve God than than going out into
[1:01:27] the wilderness. And you know, the
[1:01:29] Christian journey is a lot like a
[1:01:31] wilderness because it it's it's not
[1:01:34] attached to anything. It's a separate
[1:01:37] like our brother was saying, it's a
[1:01:39] separate life. It's a a a sellout. When
[1:01:42] they left Egypt, you really realize that
[1:01:45] they plundered the place. You know what
[1:01:48] I mean? The Egyptians, their firstborn
[1:01:51] were slain. The the the
[1:01:55] uh the children of Israel took their
[1:01:57] jewelry, they took their gold, they took
[1:01:59] their trees, they took everything, their
[1:02:02] seeds and everything. They were so
[1:02:05] vexed. They were so happy to get rid of
[1:02:08] them, you know. And that's kind of what
[1:02:10] it is when a believer prays through and
[1:02:13] really gets the spirit of God and he's
[1:02:15] got the love of God burning in his
[1:02:17] heart. You know, the the devil just
[1:02:20] wants, you know, he's almost as glad
[1:02:22] that you're not around, but let you cool
[1:02:25] off a little bit. You know what I mean?
[1:02:28] Then he starts pursuing you and he
[1:02:31] starts pursuing you and he comes after
[1:02:33] you. And and and I always love this
[1:02:35] because, you know,
[1:02:39] Moses said to him, he said, 'The Lord
[1:02:40] will fight for you. If he called you
[1:02:43] out, he'll fight for you and he'll keep
[1:02:47] you because he said all the father hath
[1:02:49] given me will come and that he won't
[1:02:52] lose one. And he said, if I started a
[1:02:54] work in you, I I will finish it. And our
[1:02:58] motive and objective in going to these
[1:03:01] services uh you know being invited, but
[1:03:05] you know, I want to go there. I'll
[1:03:07] preach the same thing there that we
[1:03:10] preach here because the my the heart of
[1:03:14] my desire is that we go forward.
[1:03:18] You you know what I mean? That we quit
[1:03:20] crying and we quit, you know, always
[1:03:24] fussing about the devil and worrying
[1:03:27] about how bad things are and and all the
[1:03:30] trials are and all the confusions and
[1:03:33] everything. uh we can come to that place
[1:03:36] that you know what God made a promise of
[1:03:38] a land and we can hold that land. We can
[1:03:42] hold to that place.
[1:03:44] That's our inheritance.
[1:03:46] That's what he spoke. And and I love
[1:03:50] that because I always like this part two
[1:03:53] because he said, "The Egyptians that you
[1:03:56] see today, you shall see no more
[1:03:59] forever." You know, I always put that
[1:04:02] scripture there. why there's no eternal
[1:04:04] hell. You know what I mean? Because that
[1:04:06] old devil, he's not going to be hanging
[1:04:09] around. You know, he's not going to be
[1:04:11] where he can rise up. He's not going to
[1:04:13] be where he can we can be in our
[1:04:15] remembrance when he's he's going to be
[1:04:18] eliminated. He's going to be
[1:04:20] annihilated. He's going to be out of our
[1:04:23] thoughts, out of our lives, never to
[1:04:25] tempt us anymore, ever to battle us
[1:04:28] anymore. and and that's worth making the
[1:04:31] journey for
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; because it hasn't even entered into the
[1:04:35] hearts of men the things that God has
[1:04:38] prepared for them that love him. And and
[1:04:41] we've got to go forward. I I think
[1:04:43] that's all around the the the world. The
[1:04:47] bride has got to start rising up above
[1:04:51] petty differences uh above uh things
[1:04:56] that are so insignificant and and the
[1:05:00] the great ability that man has to divide
[1:05:04] instead of unite. This message really
[1:05:07] was a uniting sign. It was a It was a a
[1:05:11] sign that we had something to unite
[1:05:13] with, something to join ourselves to,
[1:05:16] something that we could become one with,
[1:05:19] that we could enter into a union. And
[1:05:22] entering into that union, we we would
[1:05:25] now have we would have a fellowship that
[1:05:28] where he would say, "I will fight your
[1:05:30] battles for you."
[1:05:33] and and oh the power that comes on the
[1:05:36] church when they let God make the way
[1:05:40] for you.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of times you feel like
[1:05:43] you're in a desert.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; You know, when you come up against the
[1:05:46] Red Sea and you come up against it seems
[1:05:50] like an unpassable obstacle and Satan's
[1:05:54] just pressing in on you. It's almost
[1:05:56] like time's running out. If you don't
[1:05:59] make a decision right away, if you you
[1:06:01] don't hurry up and do something, you
[1:06:04] know what I mean? You're going to be
[1:06:05] swallowed up by the enemy. You're going
[1:06:07] to be he's going to fall upon you and
[1:06:11] and and take everything you have and
[1:06:13] take everything that uh that you've
[1:06:16] worked for. And it just seems like it it
[1:06:19] he just is right there to come. And they
[1:06:22] were marching. They were pursuing them.
[1:06:24] and and they came up against this great
[1:06:27] spot
[1:06:29] and yet the word of the Lord was
[1:06:33] preach speak to the people
[1:06:36] that they can go forward and that's what
[1:06:40] our our desire is if we could say that
[1:06:44] is not to speak to the people not to
[1:06:47] talk to them about great mysteries and
[1:06:50] great things but for to let them
[1:06:52] understand that God will fight their
[1:06:54] battle battles
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; that he called them out that that that
[1:06:59] we're not a religion.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; We're a people. And this is another part
[1:07:06] of our body. The people there are
[1:07:09] believers just like we are. They have
[1:07:11] families. They have children. They have
[1:07:14] struggles. They have battles. But yet
[1:07:16] all of us are in this together.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Every single one of, it doesn't matter
[1:07:21] what your personal challenge is. I can
[1:07:24] stand there based on the word of God,
[1:07:26] the message why Christ speak, many other
[1:07:29] places and say go forward because God
[1:07:32] will fight your battle. If you have the
[1:07:35] courage to go forward, if you have the
[1:07:38] courage, I'm going to stay with the
[1:07:40] word. I'm not going to I'm not going to
[1:07:43] back away from my pursuit of perfection.
[1:07:47] I'm not going to back away from my
[1:07:49] pursuit to do what's right. I'm not
[1:07:52] going to compromise. I'm going to hold
[1:07:54] strong to to that endeavor that I
[1:07:57] started out with. And you know, we
[1:08:00] started out with joy and here they are
[1:08:02] at the river with fear.
[1:08:06] Now fear robs you of your joy. It robs
[1:08:10] you of your hope. And all they could all
[1:08:13] that they could say was it would have
[1:08:16] been better if we would have stayed
[1:08:18] there and served sin than die out here.
[1:08:24] And I say that's a lie.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; If it could only enter into our hearts
[1:08:30] the things that God's got prepared for
[1:08:33] them that love them. if we could ever
[1:08:36] come to the spot that we that we know
[1:08:39] that just across that river. And what
[1:08:43] did he do? He told him, "You stretch
[1:08:45] forth with your rod and and depart the
[1:08:48] sea that the children of Israel will
[1:08:51] walk across on dry land." And then he
[1:08:54] said, "I'll harden the heart
[1:08:57] of that enemy and he'll try to go where
[1:09:02] it was only ordained for you to go."
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; And I think that if if we could be like
[1:09:09] the children in in Israel and understand
[1:09:12] our path forward has been ordained for
[1:09:15] us.
[1:09:17] It's ordained for us. And God will help
[1:09:20] us fight the battles that we have to
[1:09:22] fight in order to achieve that which he
[1:09:26] has ordained for us. His word isn't
[1:09:30] spoken in vain. He didn't call you in
[1:09:33] vain. He didn't take you from wherever
[1:09:35] you were. He didn't even give you the
[1:09:38] parents that he gave you in vain.
[1:09:40] Everything with God is a beautiful
[1:09:43] planned purpose.
[1:09:46] And you don't have to be afraid. You
[1:09:49] don't have to. You got to know that if
[1:09:50] there's a promise across that river,
[1:09:53] then there's a promise across that that
[1:09:56] great sea that that there's a promise
[1:09:59] across there that God is able to perform
[1:10:03] that which he promised
[1:10:06] and that he'll make a way. He'll part
[1:10:08] your seed. I I think we sing that song,
[1:10:12] right? you uh if go speak to the
[1:10:15] mountain. He said if it doesn't move,
[1:10:16] God will have you fly over it. You know
[1:10:19] what I mean? But we we go in the wings
[1:10:21] of faith. And so you when when you see
[1:10:26] so many of the people,
[1:10:29] they they're they just are fighting
[1:10:32] against the age we're in. They're
[1:10:35] fighting against the spirits we're in
[1:10:37] there. that there's a fear that and it
[1:10:40] lies within the hearts of the people
[1:10:43] that they're going to be overcome
[1:10:46] by the trials. They're going to be
[1:10:49] overcome by the finances. They're going
[1:10:51] to be overcome by this. They're going to
[1:10:53] be overcome like that. It's like a gloom
[1:10:56] and a darkness that just wants to press
[1:10:59] in on the people. And and I just want to
[1:11:02] be able to be a voice that says there's
[1:11:04] a path forward. And this word is the
[1:11:07] path forward. And this message is the
[1:11:10] path forward for the believer. It will
[1:11:14] lead us and guide us through every dark
[1:11:16] spot that there is. It's our way
[1:11:19] forward. And and so we can speak to the
[1:11:22] people that they can go forward. And and
[1:11:26] that's the hope. uh you know,
[1:11:30] you go to a place and preach and you get
[1:11:34] one service and you're preaching in
[1:11:36] English, maybe it's translated in a few
[1:11:39] different languages. Yeah. You're not
[1:11:42] going to change everybody's thinking.
[1:11:44] But if you can put something in their
[1:11:47] heart that that that
[1:11:51] co causes them to want to go and pursue
[1:11:56] what they're entitled to, then then
[1:12:00] you'll see a great blessing on the
[1:12:02] people. And and that's our heart's
[1:12:05] desire is we don't have a message. We
[1:12:08] don't have a message. We we believe
[1:12:11] Brother Brandham's message. Amen. That's
[1:12:14] what we preach, you know, but we what we
[1:12:17] hope that we can do is that we can stir
[1:12:21] up their hearts by way of remembrance,
[1:12:26] their pure hearts, that they can that
[1:12:29] they can take courage and they can take
[1:12:31] hope and that they might know by these
[1:12:34] exceedingly great and precious promises
[1:12:37] that we are partakers of divine nature.
[1:12:41] And if if just that little salt gets in
[1:12:45] the heart of the lowliest defeated
[1:12:49] believer
[1:12:51] and that one person gets lifted up, it's
[1:12:55] worth 10,000 world.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; And so as I go,
[1:13:02] uh I trust that that uh that you'll pray
[1:13:06] for us. I I I don't know how many
[1:13:09] services that is. It's probably 11 or 12
[1:13:12] services that we'll have. Uh but you
[1:13:15] know uh I remember when I got I was
[1:13:21] ordained to preach and the uh brothers
[1:13:24] came around and they laid their hands on
[1:13:27] me. As they prayed, they they spoke one
[1:13:31] word. They said, "Lord, let him be spent
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; for the gospel. let every bit of his
[1:13:38] candle be burnt. And and that that's
[1:13:43] what I want. I'm not worried about uh
[1:13:46] getting tired because the if you wait
[1:13:49] upon the Lord, he renews your strength.
[1:13:53] The thing that I want to do is I just
[1:13:55] want but with your prayers to break any
[1:13:59] obstacles, any any suspicions,
[1:14:04] any questions about motive and objective
[1:14:08] that the love of God can be shown forth
[1:14:12] and that the people the the the people
[1:14:15] that the lowliest of the people can be
[1:14:18] lifted up by God's word and And if the
[1:14:22] Lord would have us pray for sick, I
[1:14:25] believe God will heal the sick.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; So we just want to be 100%
[1:14:32] just willing and
[1:14:37] to speak without fear or without favor.
[1:14:42] um not to lean to our own understanding,
[1:14:45] not to come up,
[1:14:47] not to try to interpret the word, not
[1:14:50] try to take it out of season and
[1:14:52] misplace it, not to try to join uh uh
[1:14:58] quotes and things together like a patch
[1:15:00] quilt. You know what I mean? That it it
[1:15:04] won't stand the stretch. But just to be
[1:15:07] able to present what the prophet of God
[1:15:10] said and say, "This is what he said."
[1:15:13] And have it be in season for their need.
[1:15:17] Every elected predestinated seed can
[1:15:22] grab a hold of the voice of this age.
[1:15:27] They're ordained to hear it. and you
[1:15:30] can't be ashamed to say what he said and
[1:15:35] stand there. So if you'll pray for us on
[1:15:38] this trip uh that uh the Lord will give
[1:15:42] us strength, he'll give us wisdom. Uh
[1:15:46] you know I I I take all my book. So, I
[1:15:49] started, you know, I I'm I can't use a
[1:15:52] computer um because I touch it and it
[1:15:55] disappears
[1:15:56] and I don't know how to f find it, you
[1:15:59] know. So, I use the book. Well, I
[1:16:01] started going through the books. I want
[1:16:03] to take this book and I want to take and
[1:16:05] then I started taking and pretty soon I
[1:16:07] had was taking all of 65 and all of 64.
[1:16:12] And then I thought, well, I'll just get
[1:16:14] my red books cuz they have a lot of
[1:16:16] message in and you you you can't take
[1:16:19] it. But you you know, you find out
[1:16:22] there's a theme that just runs through
[1:16:25] all those threads. Recognize what God's
[1:16:29] done.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Recognize the fulfillment of the
[1:16:33] scripture that God promised Malachi 4:5.
[1:16:37] He promised the ministry of the son of
[1:16:40] man. He's actually was standing there
[1:16:44] performing what he promised.
[1:16:47] And if you could see that and see that
[1:16:50] that promise has been made real to you
[1:16:54] and brought out of history and so that
[1:16:58] promise has become alive, then you know
[1:17:01] that every other promise in the book
[1:17:04] also can come alive for you.
[1:17:07] And that's what he he was trying to do
[1:17:10] was to restore back the faith to the
[1:17:14] believer by opening the believer's eyes
[1:17:18] to see the word for our day made flesh.
[1:17:25] Now we heard about the word
[1:17:28] being made flesh. We have heard,
[1:17:32] but now we've seen.
[1:17:37] We've heard the stories and now we've
[1:17:40] met the people. We've saw them. We've
[1:17:43] shaken their hands. We've talked to him,
[1:17:46] had dinner with him, had dinner with the
[1:17:49] people that saw the angel that were
[1:17:52] called out, that were healed, and so
[1:17:54] many things. We are compassed with such
[1:17:56] a great cloud of witness that this is
[1:18:00] true that it's so worth living for. and
[1:18:04] and you don't want to turn your eyes
[1:18:08] away from what God provided for you to
[1:18:11] live by
[1:18:13] and and substitute that with man-made
[1:18:17] creeds, doctrines or churches because
[1:18:20] this is personal
[1:18:22] to each of us that you can live and and
[1:18:26] for us here personally and for
[1:18:31] uh the the elected in the countries that
[1:18:36] we're going to. I hope that we can all
[1:18:39] have the same hope and the same faith
[1:18:42] and be baptized by the same spirit and
[1:18:46] realize that we're one body and and
[1:18:50] that's the most uh beautiful part. So,
[1:18:54] so keep us in prayer and uh and of
[1:18:57] course as our brother, we're going to go
[1:19:00] uh have the little ice cream and a
[1:19:02] little time of fellowship and you can
[1:19:05] greet him and and uh say uh that you'll
[1:19:10] see him in Arizona and then you can go
[1:19:13] out there. Prescott's a beautiful place.
[1:19:16] Uh Matthew, you live in Prescott close
[1:19:18] to there a little bit. It's not exactly
[1:19:22] the deep Phoenix, but it's a little
[1:19:24] higher, a little cooler. Uh there's
[1:19:27] churches on both sides. I don't know if
[1:19:30] there's a church in in uh Prescott
[1:19:33] anymore, but uh you always can find a
[1:19:36] place to worship the Lord. Amen. So, we
[1:19:40] we pray for the Stephans as they head uh
[1:19:43] to Arizona. And uh we've had, you know,
[1:19:48] uh like any church, you have new people
[1:19:53] come and and and
[1:19:55] old people go and and uh one day, one by
[1:19:59] one, we'll cross the portal to dwell
[1:20:02] with the immortal. But I believe we've
[1:20:04] got a lot of good young preachers here
[1:20:07] and brother Billy, brother Matthew and
[1:20:09] Davey and Andrew and Ben and Paul and
[1:20:12] that I I'm sure one of these men that
[1:20:15] you will find that you can trust to uh
[1:20:19] lead you forward with if the Lord ever
[1:20:21] takes us. And if not, God will provide
[1:20:24] for you. So just remember, we're not
[1:20:27] attached to a man. We're attached to a
[1:20:30] word. Amen. We're not attached to an
[1:20:33] interpretation. We're attached to the a
[1:20:36] voice and we're attached to the tapes
[1:20:39] that brought the voice. And that's our
[1:20:41] ultimate. And that's our absolute. And
[1:20:44] everybody's got to have an ultimate.
[1:20:47] They've got to have the decision maker
[1:20:50] in your life. And so, you know, I think
[1:20:54] that I I would hate to think that if I
[1:20:58] built the house and I died, the house I
[1:21:01] built fell apart.
[1:21:04] That wouldn't be a very good builder,
[1:21:06] would it? You'd hate to walk up and
[1:21:08] knock on the door and say, "You better
[1:21:10] move. I built this house 15 years ago,
[1:21:13] but I'm fixing to die." No. If it's
[1:21:17] built right, it'll go on. If your
[1:21:20] heart's right, he said he would never
[1:21:23] leave you nor forsake you. But he'd be
[1:21:26] with you, even in you till the end. I
[1:21:29] hope I come back,
[1:21:34] but if I don't, I'll see you on the
[1:21:36] other side.
[1:21:38] Amen. Amen. So let's stand together this
[1:21:41] evening and the musicians can come and
[1:21:56] we'll sing a
[1:22:01] I don't think it's a sad song but we'll
[1:22:04] sing it to our brothers until we meet
[1:22:08] can
[1:22:10] at Jesus feet and we'll sing that form
[1:22:13] and then we'll we'll say a a a
[1:22:17] word of prayer uh here and u
[1:22:22] uh for our little uh time of fellowship
[1:22:25] and then we can go next door and we'll
[1:22:29] just start the first word. God be with
[1:22:31] you. Amen.
[1:22:34] Oh God
[1:22:36] be with you till we meet
[1:22:42] again.
[1:22:44] By
[1:22:46] his counsel guide uphold

[1:26:50] be with you till we meet our
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, that's our prayer. God be
[1:26:58] with you. Till we meet again. Let's
[1:27:00] pray. We're going to bless the the what
[1:27:03] we have over there and and I hope that
[1:27:06] it's
[1:27:08] that you like it just real well. And uh
[1:27:12] if you don't like it, eat it anyway.
[1:27:15] Let's pray. Our gracious father, Lord,
[1:27:18] we're taking this little time to thank
[1:27:21] our brother for the service that he gave
[1:27:26] us. Father, the meals and the
[1:27:29] hospitality you show.
[1:27:32] Father, now he's going to enter into
[1:27:35] another
[1:27:37] form of work, another opportunity.
[1:27:40] Father, another way to serve you,
[1:27:44] Father. We just ask that you just
[1:27:49] carry every burden for him, Father. And
[1:27:52] when things get heavy,
[1:27:55] may he remember that you promised never
[1:27:57] to leave them nor to forsake them, but
[1:28:01] that you'd be with them even in them
[1:28:04] until the end. Father, may their light
[1:28:07] shine that people could take hope and
[1:28:10] know that there's a true kingdom and
[1:28:13] that there's a true love and a true word
[1:28:17] that defies all the negativity of this
[1:28:21] world and shines like a great light that
[1:28:25] in this generation there was a man that
[1:28:27] could turn on the light and we could see
[1:28:31] in this dark time. We ask you to bless
[1:28:34] them, Father. This ice cream and
[1:28:38] fellowship that we're having, we ask you
[1:28:40] to bless it, Father. May we receive it
[1:28:43] with thanksgiving as we go now, Father,
[1:28:47] and to have this time of fellowship. We
[1:28:49] ask you to bless each heart and each one
[1:28:52] dearly in the wonderful name of the Lord
[1:28:55] Jesus. Father, I pray that you will put
[1:28:59] it upon the hearts of the church to pray
[1:29:02] for Lesie and I. Be mindful,
[1:29:06] Father, of the times that we have to
[1:29:09] minister, Lord, that you would get us
[1:29:12] out of the way and that the truth of
[1:29:15] this word would be what the people see.
[1:29:19] Father, that they wouldn't connect it to
[1:29:21] a personality, but they would connect it
[1:29:23] to the voice that spoke it originally.
[1:29:27] We ask you to be with each heart now and
[1:29:29] trust that we enjoy it. Help our brother
[1:29:32] in his efforts to move. Father, give him
[1:29:36] grace and strength and prepare the path
[1:29:38] before him. In the wonderful name of the
[1:29:41] Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:45] God bless you. Go ahead and go over for
[1:29:47] fellowship. Lord be with you there.
[1:29:50] Amen.
