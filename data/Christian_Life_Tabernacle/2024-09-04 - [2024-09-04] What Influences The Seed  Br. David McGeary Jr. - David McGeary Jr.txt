running after you [Music] just go before Him Father we want to thank you for drawing us here tonight Lord we know your grace Upon Our Lives as what has made this moment possible father and you as a faith faithful husbandman is rooted out over us and have cultivated us that we would desire to be in your house and to be amongst Believers and to draw nigh un you father it's truly a work of your hands and we thank you for for it thank you for bringing our brother Joseph and family back to us father and Lord the gift he has it's always been special to us father we just now want to commit this service to you each portion of it each ourselves and the hearer The Listener Lord by your grace would you come and minister to your people not that we would have ability not even if we could discern the need would we be able to meet it father but you're the only one who desires to have the preeminence with your people so we pray in all things that would be done that you'd receive the glory and our hearts would be drawn closer to you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen if you have your Bibles and you'll turn with me I'm going to do a couple of scripture readings and uh I just want to thank the Lord for even how he just confirms his word to us and lets us know that uh we we're in the the right way there is a scripture that was on our hearts and we didn't even um understand its its positioning and then the Lord just in in the context of it brought it all together and it's little things like that that uh can give us a confidence because we don't have any ability of ourselves but if you would turn with me um we're going to read in Matthew Chapter 13 starting at verse 16 says blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear for verily I say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them and in Revelations chapter 1 and verse three would also Alo also Echo this blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand Revelations 22 and 7 Jesus Christ Christ speaking said behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the Saints of the prophecy of this book and for a final reading we'll just turn to Galatians chapter 3 and verse 13 through 14 says Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every man that hangeth on a tree that The Blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith God bless you I ask the Lord to ask the blessing upon his word and you just have your seats we uh want to just turn back to Matthew 13 and 16 and 20 as what we would be fellowshipping on would seem uh maybe a little disjointed the way the Lord laid it on our heart but it really has to do with the blessing that's on the seed but for a title um I want us to just to capture the theme of it even though it may not be apparent there but I want that your thought process to be influenced by this influenced into action okay so everything that we're kind of fellowshipping on the the thing that impressed one of the things that from the weekend that really affected me was just even in one sentence it was placed it said to receive the word for your day is to be able to put it into action so we're not just sympathizers with something we don't just you know say I believe and and then that's somehow ascribed to us but it to truly receive a revelation to truly receive something it will uh put you into action so we're just hopefully you'll you'll find uh that that through what we're fellowshipping on but what we were looking at is what are the things that influence the seed so you as a child of God and what you would bring forth in your life and ultimately what is being influenced is going to be based on what the seed that's in you because from the very beginning one of the when the scripture tells me blessed are your ears for they hear I think blessed are ears because you understand that spoken word is the Original Seed you understand from a prophet's view how God could predestinate a seed and a vessel to receive it and you be the recipient of that and how there could be an amen even in you to to Echo back to the word of God it's because the word of God has to produce of its kind in your life so in that principle we just started to research and what are the things that influence a seed and and now even if you Google things you know AI does the the assist and it's really amazing you're not just stuck with web page hits but it's going to formulate this intelligence where you get this you know awesome answer so we just started to research a little bit on what are the things that influence a seed so the invisible things of God are clearly made manifest in the visible things around us we know that God in nature has declared laws and things and principles that you can better understand what it is that can make you be more fruitful in the seed of God in your life because it's I believe it's swn there and what are the things that are going to impact it so you would find that several environmental factors influence a seed they're going to be temperature light water oxygen soil PH salinity and the depth that the seed is buried and I can understand right now the spiritual minds and just thinking wow this is amazing because God has an appointed time and he he he has constructed your life and all of those things are going to map to certain things that you could say well you know what I I I'm in a hostile environment you know some of us maybe be in a in a in a baby environment you know the the salinity the alkalinity all those things but certain seeds are are conditioned for the soil that they're going to find themselves in God has prepared those seeds for the ground that they're swn in because he has an appointed time for them to come to life and I was just really uh excited and fellow in looking at this so uh there's other things that could influence it and they called them disturbance events so disturbance events could be uh flooding and tillage so something disturbs the ground maybe it's a maybe it's a a a a uh when a bunch of cattle take off and they do a stampede or or you know just natural things that somehow churn the soul and disturb the soul give the right condition for the seed to be quickened and one of the things that I thought of in that and brother brandom even in the in the in the one of the uh sermons influence or God's power to transform he talks about the seed in World War I and how the the field had been completely destroyed the bombs it was all burnt out and they looked and they rolled one stone back and yet there was a flower that was protected but it brought my mind back I remember being up in Canada and they were a poppy a red poppy and if if many have ever seen that it's not a tradition we have it here in the States but they have it amongst our allies I think in Australia and it was made uh popular up in Canada because during World War I as that you know the the type of warfare it was and the the shelling and just the death it was it it literally turned the soil in these European fields and places where they were not used to seeing flowers bloom in those fields but as the War was happening red flowers started to come up and it was even perceived that I would say men were even more spiritual then but those seeds had been sewn there over the years and were setting in that fi dormant and when the war came they started to see a foliage they had never seen really in that intensity spread out amongst those fields and they marked it as a as a symbol of blood they said those flowers those red flowers were upon the graves of men and it was symbolic God declaring their blood was crying from the earth and the and just that condition of War caused a seed that was laying there to come forward and the most if if you will barbaric of situations somehow there's this declaring of a life and a beauty and there's always that contrast with things but the that uh poppy today is still worn as a remembrance to those soldiers and you may think even in your life that you're going through something that doesn't look good but I I I believe that because the seed of God is there even the most traumatic of situations and circumstances God's going to bring forth a beauty out of it that you don't even understand is there there's other things that influence a seed and one of them is the intrinsic factors now that's just the that's that's a scientific word of saying uh the natural ability of the seed or the just the inate uh the inherent characteristics of the seed they're just belong to it naturally they those things uh could be how much food it has built up and in its store those intrinsic factors of a seed are going to allow it to uh come to life in a situation and I just you know to me I look at it and when brother brandham speaks God's power to transform he talks about the power to transform is in the seed itself so one of the things you have to have confidence in is what God has placed in you it inherently has the ability to be German it has the life in it he didn't put in you a seed that cannot be quickened he put in you a seed that the the only thing that can be quickened is the SE germ of God by the word of God it's built in it inherently and God's power to transform starting in paragraph 64 says and everything's under control to bring forth of it kind now remember to bring when he put the seed in the Earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was his transforming power now God put the seed in there with the potentials that it would be what he said it would be and as long as it stayed in the right category it could it could be just exactly what God said it would be it had to be that way because had made it that way and he made a channel that's that if if anything that stays in its channel in the line of the word it will have to bring forth exactly like the word said it would it cannot move from there it's Channel just exactly right so with everything in the trust in his own son that it would be that way then God said it's all good so just rest and each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the species that I desire it to be that's what it must be because I have given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be God has never changed just the same today as he always was then God is determined to do something he'll do it nothing is going to to stop them he'll do it Hallelujah the work that he started in you was was a determined work and nothing is going to stop it sometimes you just have to sit back and recognize the seed of God that's in you and glorify God for it because it's not that notice that this is now an inherent quality it's not dependent on anything else it it is standing alone saying the power to transform is within the seed itself amen so God is going to look out over that seed and make sure that it come it's quickened now because the seed is so and Satan understands these principles the guy's been around a while he understands that he cannot do anything about the seed the predestinated nature of the seed and that the seed's going to bring forth of it its kind he can't stop that but what he what he what he does even what he did with Eve his pattern is to try to get there first and do something one of the things they say that that impacts seeds is pre-treatment I know myself I ordered some centipede grass and it came purple I mean I was like what's going on here well that's pre-treated seed they they' uh put a coating on it that kind of would give some fertilizer that would break down so as I sewed it it would uh have a chance to embed in the earth and and they pre-treated this seed so it would increase its rate of germination and allow for a better product well uh you know that there's also other preconditions and pre-treatments that are done but one of the things I think of is as God put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world you've been pre-treated to germinate okay he he he he wanted to make sure of it so much that he coated you with the blood of Jesus Christ with the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and he said nothing can pluck them out of my hand you are pre-treated seed of God you I would say it's 100% germination rate with this pre-treatment there's never been a seed that hasn't germinated that's right they're still trying to duplicate that in the world right they want they want 100% germination rate so they they pre-treat now Satan's got his counterfeit one thing he wants to try to do is do something that'll stunt your growth he wants to pre-treat you put a poison on you he wants to do something that's going to precondition your mind so that when the word of God is coming forward to Quicken you you've got a preconceived idea there's been something that stunned it and you know there's a lot of things that in this day and age that really that gateway to your heart to your mind to to make the word of God effectual he is vying for that more now than ever before and the way he does that is he'll do that by presenting you moral causes and he tries to make things more uh uh absolute than the very word of God why it's true because I've seen it on Tik Tok right so he presents you an alternate truth an alternate something that that tells you this is the way things are and you become preconditioned so that when the word of God comes you're already weighing it against other data points that you know I mean they're they're important by the way and that's just because the Satan understands that the betting ground of your mind he's got to precondition it the best he can to try to keep that seed from coming to life so guard your heart with all diligence guard your mind with all diligence in it are the issues of Life those that's the very place where the seed can be quickened and and the only thing the devil can do is try to stunt it deform it and prevent it from being germinated and preconditioning is a is his tactic so so recognize when he in you know many times people would come up in the line with in in brother bram's Ministry and he would recognize the condition they were in was because something that transformed in their life sometimes as simple as a dog scaring them and he would say the reason this happened is is because this offense happened and don't think that Satan isn't trying to do things to bring hurt to bring harm because he wants to unsettle you he wants to make you nervous he doesn't want you to have confidence in the seed that's in you and that's all tactics that he has so when something happens sometimes the greatest thing you could do is recognize where it came from that's the devil it doesn't have to be I'm going to deny its its effect on me I'm and now that I recognize the source I can deny it I don't have to let it go any further I don't have to let it go to seed Satan what you meant for evil I'm I'm blocking you you're done now another pre-treatment they do they do with seeds is is they they pre-wash it with water they'll soak it soaking allows for the germination to be uh accelerate the germination so you'll find and many gardeners they say you know soak the seeds before you plant it that's going to help it and how we want to be Washed by the Water of the word just as much as as the world would taint us there's a word that can wash and cleans us and and and allow us to be germinated by the cleansing by the washing of the water of the world word amen another thing that impacts and influences a seed is timing and brother Brandon and one place would talk about he I believe he was in Finland and he talked about uh people being out with lamps and lanterns during the night tilling the field because you know they didn't maybe have natural means of irrigation they knew the rain was coming they knew the season was right and if they didn't sew the seed in its time in its season they wouldn't have a harvest so there was there's an urgency to timing okay that and that's another thing that you have to realize young people there is an urgency to timing the longer you go on the harder things brother Brandon would talk about your while your heart's tender you give your heart to the Lord you give it to the things of God you incline your heart to the things of God because as the season goes on the ground gets harder there's going to have to be a little more tealing there's going to have to be more work there's going to have to be things done to make that seed it be right and we know God will do it but timing is important and and and I yeah brother Billy a time appointed of the father timing is important um and that is we we God operates in Seasons just the same way he deals with the church he deals with the individual we would recognize that there is a there's a growth that we have and there's a season to things and timing is important um as we mentioned Galatians 4 1 timing appointed of the father I I found this Psalm to be encouraging it's Psalm 31:14 and 15 but I trusted in thee oh Lord I said Thou Art my God my times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of my enemy and from them that persecute me and I like that because he says my times it was not just it was he understood that there was times of life there's times of season but all of his times we the thing that we understand that man has an appointed time an appointed time to die we understand that there's times for thing and the most solemn one we say well God can't take me before my time but I also want you to understand that God has an appointed time with you there has to be a time where you and him have an appointment that you know God for yourself and and and he becomes real to you that is an appointed time and if you haven't had that time it's an appointed time because he doesn't have another way of qu in the seed there's not another way than having an appointment with Jesus Christ and it doesn't we're not putting a definition on what that appointment is but there comes a time where that he becomes real to you and you know him personally and that it's not your mom's religion it's not your dad's religion everybody else could lose their religion but you can't be lost because he spoke to you and if for some reason every body else sto to know him you can't fail but know him because he's revealed himself to you that's that's what I'm talking about that's an appointed time now the growing conditions affect germinations and that brought me back as in I really felt impressed the scriptures we read you say what did what did it where did we go how did we get to sewing how did we get to seed but when when you look at Matthew 13: 16 this is what precedes the parable of the swer and we won't necessarily go through it but that's where the same chapter is where Jesus talks about the the mustard seed and what it would produce but in verse 18 He says hear ye therefore the parable of the swer and we know that the word of God that is sown in your life there's I would say go back and read it but what I want to tell you is is blessed are your ears because they could hear and the word of God has been sown and that the conditions of your heart are described when he talks about the field so you know it tend you you know as Adam was given we spoke on this before Adam was given a commandment to to uh in even after the curse but to till the field to manage the field to have dominion over it us as daugh Sons and Daughters of God we've been given dominion over this flesh you've been given dominion over your heart to keep it and when you see the cares of Life come in I that you have a an obligation to lean on the Lord I I found myself even on Monday you know a lot of times after after meetings I usually have never come but I just maybe it was the weather it was rainy but I just felt low I just felt like a depression almost came and moved in and and I I had to recognize encourage myself and you know what this is like that Revival effect C things have been washed out now there's now I could feel like maybe a little emptiness now's my time instead of satisfying myself or satiating my you know I'm going to go play a game I'm going to do something to make myself happy I'm going to go read the news I'm going to go watch the replays of the Rangers coming back and beating the Yankees yay um I'm going to go you know I found that that saw that in the barber chair today um but uh but so I didn't do that but uh you what I did is I went back and I started listening to what I heard over the weekend because I knew I knew then when I was listening my heart was rejoicing it was encouraging me but what was it about all of a sudden finding myself in a condition where I had to guard my heart and incline it to the things of God because I was susceptible as a person to to needing a comfort to needing something and that is the place instead of going to your default Behavior which we all do I mean I'm not you know I'm not throwing stones here that it's not going to break my glass house but it's very easy to go look and and just find something because it's become this easy and it's I just had the to pause and say Lord I don't want to neglect what you did for me this weekend I want to go back and look and and go back over it and and allow that seed to be fertile in my life I don't want the the temporal Pleasures all of a sudden to pluck it away I don't want the cares of this life that's a daily thing where you have to end the ground that's in your life that that influences the seed in your life in the also in the power of transformation this is in paragraph 237 it says and we talked about the word of the the word of predestinated you see that stumbles so many of them it's God's word and he used it for We Are predestinated by the word of God and it is in that we when we were in your predestinated why it has to happen because it's that God chose you because he knowed what you would do from the beginning and don't let the devil spray you with education and poison and stuff like that you have to be modern you have to be this you don't have to be nothing but Sons and Daughters of God and if you're born by the word you do notice that spray if you take a seed a good seed and you spray it it'll kill it and when you spray the denominational stuff over the top of you it'll ruin the influence of the original word if they tell you you have to do this why the other girls do it and the other men do it don't you believe that it'll ruin God's influence of the word upon you you know that our text says don't be conformed sprayed but be transformed the seed that's in you people of today act like they don't even believe that there's a God did you know that it it you know that's that's becoming more and more you're scoffed at for believing in God it's mocked it's mocked openly it it's it's something that is becoming more and more real just having the stand and the decency that you believe God is is a principle that is is mocked openly brother brandom addresses it people of today act like they don't even believe there is a God did you know that they act like that now I don't want to call them fools but they act like it because Psalms 14:1 said the fool hath said in his heart there is no God you shouldn't call a person a fool but they certainly act like they are because they don't they don't act like there is no God the word is just ignored I don't want to ignore the word that that's the the it's always that taking heed to yourself that you always have to pause you know Jesus Christ taught us the principle behold the moat in your own eye before you behold the sliver in the other anything that is applicable outwardly is applicable inwardly and there has to be a place where you find you know application to yourself and say Lord there's probably times I've ignored the word and the effect that the word has had David even prayed for the iniquity he knew not what we want is revelation we want isab that we can see there's places that the word has to be more effective in my life and I have to understand that maybe it's by a lack of knowledge that the word is not being applied because I'm ignoring where it can be got a lot of text here don't want to get lost and may skip ahead here but brother brandom goes on go back and if you could even just read and on in that the power of transformation brother brandom addresses several things he talks about being in the rental house and turning on the television and seeing what has become an influence in the churches with modern Ricky and rietta singing a song and and you recognize the admonishment is to take heed to the influences that can creep in in the name of Christianity and influence you and and change you from declaring the seed that's in you he goes on and talks about how Cain could not down in paragraph 245 just skipping ahead says Cain was such a person religious indeed certainly but he had the wrong seed in him and therefore it brought forth the serpent seed Satan had hissed out this seed of Eden and this brought forth a Cain he put his poison on it Cain knew the perfect will of God just this week and that really struck me it I always looked at uh ishmail and how he was put underneath the tree and how he cried and God heard the cries of the lad I I tell you there there is an if you can look how God is so good to those who are even from without the promise we we should have our eyes of understanding open there's this all things have been made new if God in his grace could show Cain the right way how much more a Son of God inclining his heart and saying God show me the way show me the truth open my eyes give me Revelation of this day what you've done in in God on the premise of being just will open your eyes to the truth and then seed of God humbles himself where I I tell you what there isn't a time where the word of God is not going to be open to you and it not bring correction not bring a calling not bring something that says woes me I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell amongst the people who are unclean you don't you can't have a revelation from God God and and it not condemned the flesh but it but it's going to tell you who you are as a son and the SE Gene of God that's in you and that's the life churn that that's the travail of the seed but pray God that he opens your eyes of understanding paragraph 248 don't you all when you're talking you women you girls you wearing long hair and they say why you got long hair see why do you wear your skirts how long they do you you go talk to them they kind of give you the shoulder isn't that right see they know they know that's right if there if there isn't a lady in them see they know that's right but you see they can't humble themselves to it you're preaching a gospel and just as a brother may be able to give words of exhortation I tell you what when they when the when modesty is put on display when righteousness and Holiness is put on display it is a testimony and they know better there's something in them that knows better they look at it it preached life to them and instead of humbling themselves to it there's an the the re the reaction is the same that Cain had he slew his brother what do they want to do they want to kill the influence instead of being brought into the influence and having that affect them in a good way they're they're going to try to kill the influence old fogy you know even though they recognize there's a true virtue in it that they're going to stigma ize it they're going to put something on it to put a reproach and there's many thing I even think of you know that the that that story of the train and the and the girl coming back from college and there her mother is she's was scarred because she she ran in and she saved that child's life and she was scarred and marred that that girl could be beautiful but because of the friends she was with stigmatized wow her own mother it influenced her reaction so instead of receiving the very person who loved her and gave herself for that she could live she would turn a cold shoulder to it that's the effect and the influence that Satan can have in your life if you allow influences to come in the very thing that can save you the very thing that can help you you'll Harden your heart to it when it's the very grace of God beating out and crying for you and how much heartache it could save them from and they don't even recognize it so one of the things that can Quicken and affect a seed is fire thank God for the Holy Ghost and Fire now fire the reason you say what is it about fire that is that's needful for C certain kinds of seed well heat can crack the seed coat and allow for water to come in and Trigger germination this is needed where there's hard seeds so you know what sometimes the fire's got to be turned up a little hot sometimes there just has to be a little bit of cracking sometimes everything just needs to go wrong sometimes you need to be found on your back saying God help me I don't know what's going on but there's some heat going on because God's germinating a seed Hallelujah sometimes the heat is a good oldfashioned Revival service where the Holy Ghost is being poured out and someone gets a little con ition that's another kind of heat you know but there's there's a heat that can crack the hardest of shells and I pray I'm thankful that God knows how to apply the heat he'll he'll he'll crack the hardest shell heat and fire causes smoke and they have found that chemical compounds of a smoke can surround and help a seed germinate well you get a couple of people on fire for God you get a couple of people with a little bit of Holy Ghost smoke around them that can cause an effect a chemical reaction on an atmosphere around some seeds around them that can cause those seeds to go germinating so smoke you know if all smoke no fire well you know what praise God for smoke smoke can help a seed germinate sometimes a little emotion a little smoke can help us he germinate it's just the way the Lord works and he'll get heat shock so the rapid so they the seeds have a way of germinating sometimes they freeze them sometimes they but there's something that that tells the seed that it's time to germinate and they could you could rapidly apply heat eat and it will shock the seed into recognizing that it's time to germinate and sometimes you have to recognize when God's knocking on the door it's a shock there's something going on was that you know whose voice am I hearing but the that temperament and that ability to be shocked the world prays on it but that's actually supposed to cause a reaction spiritually where you look to God and I I've seen this and you know I I love it when something shocks somebody and usually the very first thing they do is they look to the authority figure in the room and how they're going to react because that's where their confidence is that's what they look to but shock causes somebody to go to something that they have confidence in when you're when you're shocked what are you run to just evaluate your life and what is it that your your tendency is to go to when you're shocked and I pray that you're running to the arms of Jehovah that there hasn't been anything that's influenced you and the seed of God in you to have you be going to places that are just keeping that seed dormant because the the power and the seed's there to tra be transformed but if you don't allow God to Quicken it then they'll just lay dormant in the exposition of the seven Church ages brother Brandon would say it is not that the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it's the word or the seed that is it way back too far back for the human mind to grasp the Eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated Romans 913 and neither was born and neither had done good or evil see it was thought and that thought became expressed and God brought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed Jacob alone had the seed that is why he had respect to the birthright and the Covenant of God if you are true seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you in the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age when God determines to do something he will do it this this we're not now dealing with a petty God God's a good God that's destroyed if you look at the very beginning each seed must bring forth of its kind and there's a day and age and a manifestation for the word for its day that declares what the seed was we cannot in our day declare the fruit for another day and then claim to be predestinated seed for our day right you can't you have to receive the it's for your age for your day it's it's time specific that if you take that out then you cannot be convinced and concerned about what you got everybody else could build their own boat and it's going to weather the storm there's a lot of good churches and orphanages out there they're doing a lot of good works they believe in Jesus Christ and they've they've got a form of godliness and they're okay because they're going to float they'll withstand the test of this age have any of them I I every single one of them the ones that you thought thought had a standard don't have a standard and you can tell me you're going to be a Son of God and stomach that that you're going to sit and join yourself to something places that tell you to put your name on their book to be a member you're going you they've got you know you got a fellowship card and and brother brandom cried out so much against it but that denominational thinking we can't join ourselves to it I know that there's good people in there but the we have to have confidence in the seat of God that'll call them out and if you don't believe you have any part in that then you won't be calling and and they in any true seat of God is is looking for a way of escape from those those pest houses they they they have no truth in them they're Antichrist they're false ways of an antichrist is a false way of Salvation And when you understand that they're presenting a false way of salvation you should be convinced and concerned you should know that we've received a word that has set us free that's called us out it's the eagle cry it's something that's called us with the heavenly vision to know recognize our day and its message in back in the power of transformation 275 that's what the church call is today is I counsel thee to come to buy me Sav for your eyes that you might be Anointed with my Sav and that you'll see let the Holy Spirit come upon any person that's truly got something down there a healing comes from inside you know if you just recognize how blessed you are that that all of this is because God deposited something in you that when the Holy Spirit does call when the word does call it causes an effect in you that we should be so thankful for not not a not a piousness but just really thankful that God's done that for you let the Holy Spirit come come upon a person that's truly something down there a healing comes from inside let that healing come from the spirit that's in you it is a genuine Spirit anointing the genuine seed it can't do nothing but bear a son and daughter of God but the genuine Spirit can come upon a CLE bird seed and the rain can fall Upon A CLE bird and that will make it live just the same as it falls upon a weak wheat and makes it live but by their fruits you know them see where a fruit we are a fruit tree of God bearing his word hallelujah the word of God is bore out in your life it is just manifested inherently it is there it is planted what God God's determined to manifest we don't have to enter into his rest I'm telling you all you have to do if that whatever the condition of the seed is in your life he has the ability to transform to Quicken and to bring that seed to manifestation and I love when the spirit's poured out and it brings that seed to maturity but there could be other conditions that we can that the Lord can use but I pray that we we are seeking the rain we're letting the spirit saturate Our Lives we're letting it become quickened CU it will bring out what's already in there that he's placed in there and just looking at the influence upon the seed you can't uh help but you know when brother Brandon preaches influence he talks about Uriah and z in in Zachariah and one of the things that struck me about Uriah is he was and I you know I could get names wrong but uh Uzziah thank you um but one of the things that he was influenced by was Zachariah so early on in in in in his Reign he was really a great king you look at him in the things he accomplished uh in being in Israel ourselves we we we went down to El lot what down in the in the coast and he rebuilt that City and the in the books would go through and and really speak in in in Chronicles of the things that that he had done what Uzziah had done and if you want to turn there I think we got a little time we'll try to we'll try to hurry but 2 Chronicles 26 says then all the people of Judah took uzzi who was 16 years old and made him King in the room of his father amesia and built and he built eloth eloth is it sets down on the tip of Israel right there in the where the I believe it might be the Red Sea that comes up beautiful place it it's contrast there's Jordan over here and it it was a Oasis just an oasis so he rebuilds a great City and He restored it to Judah and after the King slept with his father 16 years old he began to Reign and reigned 50 and2 years in Jerusalem his mother's name was jeulia of Jerusalem and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord according to all his father uh amesia did and he sought God in the days of Zariah who had understanding in visions of God I would say we have the privilege of being in the day of a prophet who had visions and understandings from God and with that instruction and and leaning to that understanding we can do that which is which is pleasing to God we have the ability we know the things which are how what you know what how precious it really is to understand that certain things are an Abomination to God to have this word restored in its tress to to be able to walk in a way of Holiness that is pleasing to him when others are are crawling on their knees whipping their backs doing all sorts of things because they believe in somehow it's pleasing to God and we've been given things that we know are a great value to him and things that are an Abomination to him and it's because we've had a prophet who was able to see a vision and even a vision that could even say get back in line these are not Mysteries to us they're not in in the vision of the preview of the Bride it's very astounding the things that he sees in that those are things that we all should be seeking the Lord and knowing for our day and understanding this is the if you seek the prophet's advice those are things you should all know and and are given to you to know because he sought God in the days of Zechariah but what what happened is he he got lifted up he tried to assume a role that were not was not his and this is after many mighty Deeds there was things accomplishments Tower rebuilding towers of Jerusalem there's a lot of things that he could look at and if you will he could encourage himself but you have to recognize that pride is a very evil thing the one thing that should always be happening is as the word comes as we identify who we are it's not to make ourselves great but it makes us less and it makes him greater it's all be it's not about the bride the church it's us it's us it's us but there should be something in us that's saying ABA father it should be something that's looking up in great it's we can only as the moon reflect his light there's nothing that we're ascribing to ourselves that gives us Glory or stature or status but the more we see of him the Lesser we become and and that's just a that's one way that Satan's going to try to influence the seed right is going he'll get you lifted up we're not seeking after a supernatural offer you come out of meetings you come out of things and you you feel like you want to see something Supernatural but the very most important thing that you could see is that your heart is now inclined to the things of God and the word of God and you're wanting to see the word of God minister to your life and become more effective but if you want to do something Supernatural if you're wanting to do something that can give you more status as a super chis super duper I came out of the weekend feeling pretty super duper and then I fa myself on Monday I wasn't so super duper matter of fact the devil's buffeted me in my flesh he's a liar you know I that's but where's my confidence it's in the seed of God that he's placed in me that what God has started in me he's going to finish I'm not resting on the any super duper I'm not resting on anything my works I'm not resting in my ability to go spread some incense and get lifted up but I am content with the word of God that's been provided to me by a prophet and and go read 2 Chronicles chapter 26 if if you're just catching little pieces and don't know what I'm talking about you can read a school book you can read that chapter of the Bible um but he he becomes in a fall and he's smitten with Leprosy and the other thing that that is astounding to me is so here's a prophet he could receive instruction from a prophet but then when the ministry comes and tells him don't do this he doesn't listen to the ministry now I would have to assume that if if if if if the prophet was there and him having the confidence in the prophet and the prophet could have actually apprehended him and stopped him I believe he would have listened to the prophet but for some reason there was an an idea that he had that the ministry could not correct him and he would not receive the correction from the ministry when they tried to tell him don't do this even though the they were preaching the exact same thing this was an ordinance they had received it wasn't contrary to the prophets it was absolutely according to the prophets but he could not receive the instruction from the priest from the ministry from the Levites and we should never think that God has stopped his work if we're not not perfect there's a perfecting of the saints that God is still doing through a five-fold Ministry and that is something that is still in operation that is still working and we want to be sensitive to the way the Lord would use it because it's all Jesus Christ and if it's not Jesus Christ we don't want it but one of the things that was that you could say was an influence and brother brandham and in just closing just finding a place to close seeing someone else's fault was actually impactful upon one of the greatest prophets Isaiah brother brandom said that caused him to recognize that he could not rest his confidence in man that he he be he all of a sudden realized a shock something happened and sometimes that happens where we recognize that we can't have confidence in man and I I tell you it can have the same benefit for us that it had for Isaiah it can ca us to to seek God and recognize that we need to have a holy ghost experience for ourselves that'll keep us that'll purify us to cleanse us to let us to and the experience you must have is one that you recognize that you need cleansing that you need sanctification that you need the filling of the holy spirit so that you could say Lord send me there's there's there's a result of a true experience with the Lord and it can transpire all at one time but at the end of it you're going to be Sanctified and set aside for service you're going to be cleansed out burned out you're going to have your mind settled and you're going to be able to say Lord touch my lips with your holy coal Purify Me So there could be something of real virtue that could come from my life no longer David McGary but the very effect of a touched life in my life brother Brandon would say an influence of another just the effect of in ver uh chapter paragraph 190 remember it was when Isaiah made his confession that he was wrong he had been altogether wrong he had been leaning upon his Creed see leaning upon the man a manmade aair he' saw a king that was a great man he was a religious man but he saw that all men will fail see but when he changed that and he looked up and he saw a vision who God was and then he said I want to confess I'm wrong them old Creeds won't work no more because they're all dead and filed see there's Le they're leprosy stricken but I've seen the glory of God made manifest a Creed can't manifest that a Creed can't see say it that way a Creed can't do it that way it takes Christ to do it that way and as soon as he saw that he saw he said now I've been altogether wrong Lord and then come the cleansing then come the commissioning oh my it was then that he would he cleansed Isaiah and that is when I look at this message this was Jesus Christ there's nothing else could declare it this way could vindicate it this way and there's a standard and a calling that this message has called us to that we can no longer say I'm satisfied with anything less than Perfection I want to be a fully manifested Son of God I want to have complete Dominion I cannot wait till the translation this body when we finally as Sons and Daughters of God step out and and take our flight where death itself is is placed under our foot and we take a body change that is the message that was delivered to us in power in demonstration with what no man can do nothing else out there declares it that's the effect that it should have on us if the musicians can come we'll just find a place to to stop if you are true seed if you are truly baptized with the Holy Ghost you will esteem his word above your necessary meat seed of discrepancy God planted his seed and his seed is Christ where God decided to put his name look he is the only way of Escape he's the only true potentate he's the only true God none besides him I am God and God Alone he said Jesus said this is the Commandment hear ye oh Israel I am the Lord your God just one God I am he why do you look to another another will come I come in my father's name and you receive me not but another will come in his own name and you will receive him and they do and they did it at NAA are you a Christian I'm a Baptist are you a Christian I'm a Pentecostal are you a Christian I'm a Methodist another name let's not be guilty but when it comes to the name of Jesus Christ they walk just as far from it as they can they don't want nothing to do with it for he is the word and the word declares itself notice the only way of Escape he is the rose of Sharon the Bible said he was every title in the Bible of God belongs to Jesus Christ he was the alpha the Omega the beginning the end he was that which is and shall come the root The Offspring of David both root and offspring of David the Morning Star the rose of Sharon the lily of the valley the alpha the Omega the father son Holy Ghost all in Jesus Christ he was the full manifestation of Jehovah God made flesh to dwell amongst us exactly what he was he was the Rose of Sharon what what they did do to the Rose of Sharon they squeeze it out mash it out and get the perfume out of it it's a beautiful rose has to be squeezed down to get the perfume from the rose that was a beautiful life there's never been a life like it but it had to be squeezed out on Calvary sea they took the anointing of the Rose of Sharon they put it upon Aaron and he had the anointing with that to go in before the Lord in the Holy place in the Holy Veil he had to be Anointed with the of Sharon to go sprinkle The Mercy Seat each year and that anointing must be upon him a sweet smelling savior unto the Lord packing the blood of the lamb before him after he had also sprinkled the lamb preganat and the Bells around his garments he'd walk a certain step plain holy holy holy unto the Lord notice he's the rose of Sharon the sweet smelling savior the anointing upon his people the anointing upon his people that's you you've been sprinkled with the rose of Sharon with the life of Calvary that's been meshed out it's a sweet selling smelling Savor under the Lord that's the perfume that should be in your life an identity with the crush smitten life of Calvary not another identity not another influence notice he's the Rosa sharing the sweet smelling savior the anointing upon his people you cannot come before him with any Creed with any other thing but the anointing with the rose of Sharon the word he is the lily of the valley the lily of the valley means something to me when I was in high school I'd lost friends acquaintances to Opium to overdose to addiction and I'd often tell them about the real lily of the valley I knew what it was was because a prophet told me now you know how they get the opium you get opium you take a Lily and squeeze it out you get the opium doctors use it in their Laboratories take a man that's nervous and flustered a woman she feels she's going to go crazy she's walking the floor and screaming she's in hysterics a doctor will take a little of this Lily opium and push it into her arm or vein somewhere or his and they'll quiet down it's all over for a while but as soon as that opium dies out here they come again worse than there was but I tell you friends that's only a type of the Gen one opium from the lily of the valley that I know of he is the lily of the valley he was squeezed out on Calvary he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed and in that that squeezing out of the flowers he was a flower he was the greatest flower that ever growed was the lily of the valley the great Rose of Sharon now he hanst night spanning between Heaven and Earth I believe he was that time rather to take away the sin of the world and bring healing back to the world and the Bible said that he's the same yesterday today and forever God bless you let's just stand the same seed that produced Jesus Christ at Calvary they would look at that final result which was a life being squeezed out and they would deem it failure and I tell you the world may not esteem the testimony of Christ in your life very much but to God it could be the very sweet smelling Rose of Sharon and to others and what you go through it could be the very comfort and the Very balm that could take someone that would have been lost and bring life let's just go before him and pray Heavenly Father we thank you for the seed that you've deposited in US Lord as you've given us to be husbandmen and stewards of our hearts and the ground that you've planted the seed ask that you'd give us wisdom Lord to know how to cultivate it to keep the things away from it that shouldn't be there Lord and we want to thank you for the things you do in our life to Quicken that seed Lord maybe there Hard Times Maybe it's turbulence maybe it's a little fire father but we know you're working all things to the good to manifest that which you've deposited Lord and it must bear forth what you've planted Lord we have confidence in you and your word we're not resting in the confidence of the things we could show outwardly or do with our hands but our very confidence is in the seed that you've planted in US Lord and truly only you can glory in that because we didn't plan it you you planted it Lord we've just come to recognize what you've deposited in us so allow us to do our part father I just pray that your bride that sits here Lord that each one would be blessed for having been in your house Lord minister to them and meet the need we pray as we give in your word in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen are you playing anything Brother Joseph what is it my ears ain't working all I want to see is Jesus amen let's sing that together the time is near whereever everything that I hold dear will lay before the holy consuming fire all my works and all my deeds and every prayers and all my needs will lay before the holy consuming fire and all I want to see [Music] is all I want to see is Jesus [Music] shineing through me bir and self Afflicted pain and everything that I thought came will lay before the holy com to me fire words are not know in his name Healing Hands the touch the lamb will lay before the holy [Music] consuming fire oh all I want to see is Jesus Oh and all I want to see is in in me all I want to see is Jesus Shine through me and you're say well down oh my [Music] PR one oh well done well done oh my face for one [Music] all I want to see is Jesus Oh and all I want to say is in me all I want to see is [Music] Jesus sh through me Hallelujah blessed are your eyes for they can see blessed are your ears because they can hear what is it the Master's seed in you you know I was thinking about it as our brother was speaking often time we think oh it's the seed of God in us and don't forget the seed was there before the body could be that's right but before this body can come into flesh the seed existed before so it's not necessarily that the body owns the seed it's the SE that owns the body it's the seed that will take the body under subjection oh my it's how did you come to church the seed brought you here it's not your body that said well I have a seed I got to go to church no the seed said we're not going to stay home we're going to church whatever the seed has need of God drags it whatever wherever you are if it's time that the sun is G now remember it's the Sun that brings the seed into maturity it's the drawing power of the word of God when the word begins to draw it says it doesn't matter if the seed is under a rock it doesn't matter if you P concrete on top of it it doesn't matter it it will find the crack somewhere it's going to show up and I'm thankful because this Christianity it's not something that you produce on yourself oh I got to be a Christian I got to be no somehow something inside of you is saying you're going to live a Christian Life you're like I did this I fell here I done this I went don't worry about it you're going to live a Christian Life why because there there's a seed inside of you it's made to only be drawn by the power of the word it's made to only be anointed by the spirit of God so it could produce what God wanted it in the beginning it's his work like our brother was saying I love it the that if you take a seed it has the ability to to get water in it the fire every the nutrients and everything now the rock doesn't have the same ability or rock you can only hit it up and cool it down it will hear the same word and get hard and then after word it gets cooler but a seed will take it and it will drink the word and it will drink the word and and sometimes it doesn't look like you're like all this water we've been pulling we we're pouring we don't see anything but just give it a little while just be patient just wait a little while all of the sudden you'll see the ground cracking up and something begin to show up and then a Shute will put up here a little leaf over here why the seed is coming into maturity it's being drawn by the power of the word it's drinking of the word and they will produce it and and I want to say this I I love what our brother said our confidence is in that seed without that seed we are nothing without that seed we are wasting our time but with that seed we are everything we we read it over there it says he put the power in that seed to bring forth everything that God predestinated for that seed to bring so the desire of my heart tonight is God just let me drink of the word let let me drink like the prophet will say the farmer all he has to do is just pour water and it says the street seed has to drink more than its own portion and then it burst open so for this flesh to to go away it will take you drinking and drinking and drinking gallons and gallons of the word not by your phone but the word our brother said we have tendency to you know we spend eight hours and we go where did my time go by what did I do with my time no put the phone aside drink the word take your Bible drink the word put on a message drink the word drink today drink tomorrow before you even know it it will start showing and I thought it was so in line with even what our pastor was saying when when when he was talking to your young people here the problem we don't keep hold of what we have is the lack of of drinking is the lack of reading the lack of listening the lack of praying if you listen to the word every day you add prayer to it you add the reading and the listening it will produce the Christian because it's made to only do that that's the nature of the seed it has in it the power of transformation amen if it's your heart desire tonight to do that just lift your hand up to him and let's ask him that father we we want to produce this word and we hear it what a Believer is supposed to be and all of that and we know we can't produce in it our own self all we know is is the power of the sun that's calling forth for that to come and all we know is to take that word and to drink it the prophet said that the Sheep he says he cannot produce Wool by itself but all it does is by the eating of the herbs and the eating and everything that he eats the the grass the more grass he eats and eats he said all of the sudden that wool will come out Lord let us just drink of your word let us be just be comfortable coming to church and drinking and drinking and not worried about tomorrow not worried about how am I going to get rid of this problem that problem how am I going to overcome this and overcome that let me just focus on one thing and that is to drink of your word let me just worry about one thing I can't change everything but one thing I can do is to drink of the word Lord I will just drink of your word and you will take care of the rest I'll just take your word and you will take care of my battles I'll just take of your word and you will take care of everything else
