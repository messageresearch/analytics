Description:
Pastor David McGeary
Christian Life Tabernacle
March 10, 2024
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and let's all stand and sing that this [Music] morning the away stood cross the EM of suffing and oh and that cross oh where the dear s f to the world of sers was slain oh so a CH CH all right oh until my trop is last I lay down oh and I will cling to the old [Music] right and exchange it let's sing that second verse as invite brother Mike this morning oh and all oh I saw this by the world and aous attraction for me for the Lamb of God oh and left his glory above to be to dark [Music] Cal so I CH the all oh until my tropies at last down oh and I will cling to the old rug and and exchange it s for [Music] a lord Jesus once again we thank you for all that you do Lord the hand you have Upon Our Lives Lord the way that you guide our steps that you ever given us your word that we may be able to see our way in a dark in a dark time father Lord we thank you for this another time to gather together Lord to hear from you Lord we pray that you would speak to each one of us according to your word Lord are the very bread of life that we depend upon feed upon Lord we pray Lord that your presence would be here as you promised it would Lord may all things be done according to your will Lord I pray that you would meet every need Lord Lord that you would make yourself known Lord that the service would be done according to your will we pray these things in Jesus name amen you may be seated I'm going to read in Psalm 70 this morning if want to go ahead and turn there I don't know about you but uh as you listen to you know the messages that brother Brandon preached preached over the years you begin to recognize you know the patterns for how he did things now I'm sure some of you have picked up on that as well you know the manner in which he worked the way he handled something maybe the spirit in which he would perform something you know and just as the Lord used his words the words that he spoke to minister life you know the spirit of the Lord that was in him caused him to do things in a certain way to demonstrate that life at work you know one of the things which brother brandham did nearly 200 times over the course of his ministry that as we have it recorded was there would be times he would begin to pray and he would just simply say in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God I take every spirit in here under my control for the glory of God how many of you remember that you know often this was before he'd be a prayer line when you know he would be facing all kinds of infirmities or Spirits burdens that people had you can go and listen to yourself I I counted nearly 180 times but you have one that stood and put things in their place you know as I listen to this you know the question that we should ask was this a prophet exercising a prophetic gift and taking a position that only a prophet can do or was this a Son of God doing what a grown-up Son of God should be doing you know there are certainly things that brother brandom did which were part of his office that his commission is a prophet things that belong to that role but the life which he was demonstrating was son life a mature son taking that word putting it to his lips and putting it to work in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God I take every spirit in here under my control for the glory of God you know Jesus said something toward the end of his ministry it was in Matthew 28:18 he said this all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth all power in Heaven and Earth that means that nothing else and no one else has any power except to Those whom he gives it and then in Luke 2439 he instructs his disciples behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tar ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high in John 14 he calls this the comforter and that when he the comforter shall come verse 20 at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you and in Luke 10 he tells his disciples behold I give unto you not just my prophets Power To Tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you and then we had one come and show us the approach how to do that very simply in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the son of God I take every spirit in here under my control for the glory of God you know this was on my my mind as I was reading Psalm 70 there's you know as with many other Psalms David is in prayer asking for the help of the Lord but as he's praying say very makes an interesting statement in verse two he says this let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul let them be turned backward and put to confusion that desire My hurt and notice this is not a question he's not asking let them be you know two things stuck out to me as he prayed that first he's speaking to them that seek after his soul not there not his body not his finances not his job not his physical condition but all those enemies that are coming after his soul to try to take that something we all have aimed at us each day as Believers but the second thing that struck me was what he prayed for not just Lord help me and deliver me but he took it a step further may all those that seek my soul be put to shame may they be confounded turn them back and put them to confusion you know I thought of James in James 4 as I was reading that and he he was instructing us ye ask and receive not because ye ask a miss that you may consume it upon your lusts you know and certainly it's a clear instruction not to be in prayer for carnal fleshly things but beyond that I wonder how often when I pray I'm focused more on my fleshly outcome than on the spiritual reality Lord help my body to feel better give me the strength help my work to be successful help my words to be a blessing help me to overcome this and have strength for that help me to be more faithful good things but still fleshly things but I wonder how many times instead if I would pray Lord let those things which are coming after my soul be confounded May their efforts be confused turn them back frustrate the work that they would try to do against me or in the name of Jesus Christ the son of God I take every spirit in here under my control to the glory of God I wonder if there are things I should be asking for that I'm not am I living below my privilege am I asking a Miss are there things I struggle with waiting in faith for deliverance where I could instead be praying May that thing that seeks my soul be turned back may it be confounded May its efforts be confused and put to shame that the efforts of the enemy in my life would be frustrated notice David wasn't asking here he was declaring let this be you know often when we think about you know taking control of spirits in prayer we often think of great prayer lines that it requires Great labor and great effort and intense prayer that if we can have the right number of preachers pray long enough and hard enough that we can have deliverance and there are times for that but when an example of mature maturity was set before us a simple statement of faith standing on the word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I take every Spirit under my control to the glory of God and he wasn't asking he was declaring which frankly is what prayer of faith looks like let's go ahead and stand this morning you know certainly we do need the Lord's help you know and then we'll read here in verse 5 as David says I am poor and needy make haste to help but there's a declaration here that the work of the enemy against him would be frustrated would be confused would be turned back you know I wonder if it's a underutilized tool in our Arsenal that if we're not careful we defer that to the ministers and the prophets to do instead of taking that for ourselves you know but if all power is given unto him and then he has endued us with power from on high then every believer to whom the comforter has come can make that same declaration and like David like brother brandom we're not asking all right let's go ahead and read Psalm 70 together this morning make haste oh God to deliver me make haste to help me oh Lord let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul let them be turned back Ward and put to confusion that desire My hurt let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say aha Aha and let such as love thy salvation say continually let God be magnified but I am poor and needy make haste unto me oh God Thou Art my help and my deliverer oh Lord Make No ter amen amen I trust you happy to be in the house of God this morning amen you may have your seats amen amen oh there are people almost everywhere those hearts are all of oh with a find of Pentecost which gives 10 man CLE oh it is

desire on your heart and need in your life might seem impossible but with him all things are possible if you can just believe take a moment in your heart to just think that he's all powerful he's the creator of Heaven and Earth there's nothing that is impossible for him and just commit it into his hands and believe that he hears you this morning our precious father we come to you this morning because we believe that you are and that you're a rewarder of them that diligently seek you we've come here this morning Father there's certainly other places we could be but there's a hunger in our heart for eternal life a hunger in our heart for joy and peace that surpasseth understanding there's a desire in our heart for the words of eternal life that you alone possess so we've come this morning though we love one another though we long to fellowship with one another but father this morning we've come that we might feel your presence and hear your voice that we might be blessed in contact the Supernatural and Lord only you can grant that we could work as hard as we could work we could work it up we could do everything but father you alone are in control of your presence you go where you want to go and so we're calling on your name that you might walk in our presence this morning that you might touch our needs this morning Father that we could walk from this place with joy in our heart and truly say he lives he's the same yesterday today and forever and I've touched the Hem of His Garment I alone personally can testify that he's risen from the dead may be that be each of our portion this morning we ask it in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning let's turn in our Bibles uh like to welcome any visitors that we have this morning may the Lord be your portion this morning and and uh we just want to try not to be long but uh also just try to uh touch on the Simplicity of the Gospel how many believes God's hidden Simplicity amen the more complicated it gets the farther away you're getting from God you know conspiracy theories and and all these uh things that man always tries to come up with they're trying to put all the pieces of the puzzle together and the puzzle is very simple it's the word of God amen amen and and by his grace he's allowed the scriptures to be printed but man could come up with all kinds of interpretations but his presence and his Spirit interprets the word to you so that's what our our great hope is this morning that each of us will have a personal touch let's turn to the gospel again and Paul writing to the Corinthians 1 Corinthians the 13th chapter and we also have been reading uh this chapter along with uh the gospel of St John the 17th chapter The Lord's Prayer in the garden for his church and and so we just want to think over these things again and and as we read these and you know I'm not a very good reader so you fill in the blanks for me but this is what you want to be asking yourself as each one of these characteristics are are read or being spoken ask yourself do I possess that okay do I have this is is this alive in my life and then if it's not we'd like to raise the question do you want this to be in your life and that and then the next question would be how do I get this in my life and so uh without trying to be complicated this morning and and and um we just want to read very simply and this is uh Paul going and we talked a little last week how the church started emphasizing on the wrong thing not the thing that they were emphasizing was wrong but they were putting too much emphasis and therefore moving it out of its proper place so you understand what I'm saying something can be right and good and and stand alone but if it gets moved out of its proper place or it gets more evidence and recognition put on it than what it was given to be put on it then it becomes out of balance and that's our desire is to really be in balance as Christian so he says here's though I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol so it wasn't the speaking in tongues that was wrong but if it isn't in its right place and with the right motivation it becomes noise and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing so one is measured by God and one is measured by man amen one gives God the glory the other gives man the glory so he says and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing now those are some pretty strong things I mean we would think that every single one of these would be momentous in itself and worthy of great admiration ation and uh a great acknowledgment of God I laid my life down I was burned at the stake I prophesied I know all things you know and we think that that should account for something Paul says without love it accounts for nothing it's nothing if it's not placed right and motivated right and he says now he's going to explain because you could have all these things up here that we just talked about and not possess the virtues that follow charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vth not itself is not puffed up amen does not behave itself unseemingly seeketh not her own is not easily Prov voked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things wow I've just heard seven eight nine things I need to work on charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkling but when face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as also I am known now abideth faith hope charity of these three but the greatest of these is Charity may the Lord add his Blessing to his word in jesus' name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated I I certainly believe that there's uh something about being a Christian or why that we're Christians or even that we have the name Christian is because there's an association with being Christlike amen I I would I would uh take that that would be the whole uh motivation of why that we're here this morning uh I mean I I know we're a a a a poor people if you would look across the land today uh we would be considered uh what would be referred to as a a poor congregation you know I walked through the lot and I didn't see any brand new Mercedes I didn't see you know any uh uh lotuses or or you know know nice uh hot cars uh I saw a few cars that are a few years old you know but but we don't put our emphasis on that I mean the value of our wealth is is not measured by worldly things the value of our wealth is measured by our faith amen so where God's come to the poor of this world who are rich in faith who who who be believes in a God that can do all things that nothing is impossible for him we're not relying on a uh intellectual conception or relying on our understanding of mysteries and knowledge to be what uh allows us to become Christlike so you can't know your yourself into becoming Christlike you you can't gather enough knowledge to make you live like the Lord Jesus and isn't that our goal we want to be Christlike we want to be like him he he when we read his story when we see the things that he's done we see the Miracles that he he uh performed we see the way that he reacted with Sinners how that he discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart in other words how he got right to the heart of the matter how he dealt with people where that they were really at and and he wasn't deceived or moved by pretentiousness or or by outside appearance he he he was there was something about him that that really caused him to really care about the people that he came in contact with we can could go through story after Story and Parable after Parable and every single one of the stories the the I love the story of the Good Samaritan and and we know that's a reflection of him and how that he's dealing with Sinners and how that the people that came down the road how each one of them discerned uh the situation here was a man beaten on the road and one man just drove by he was busy and another man didn't want to get involved with the situation but here came one that everybody else would consider a sinner and he stops and not only does he stop and render aid but he he goes the extra mile and he takes him to an end and he gives the man money and says take care of this man and I'll stop by on my way back and if I owee you anything I'll take care of it now he didn't know that man that man didn't know him there was nothing that he would gain at all from helping that man there was no motive there was no objective there was nothing uh uh uh there to to uh cause him to do that except that there was something inside of him that wanted to do right and wanted to do good and and at the bottom line of that what that man possessed was charity he possessed love he saw a need he knew he could do something about it and he went the extra mile oh look the story that we often hear uh about the the lady that was in the funeral possession for with her son and the that possession came down and she was wailing and crying it was her only son it was all that she had and she came across the path of of of the Lord and death and life came in Conflict they they came there and he was moved upon and and he stopped the posession and and he his desire was to her and her need I'm sure he saw the whole circumstance like I'm sure he saw the future I'm sure he saw the past and and he he was motivated by something that was inside of him to stop that possession and to look upon that lady and said daughter would thou like to receive thy son and and he raised her up and and he and the Lord Jesus brought her son back to life amen you know you never hear the rest of the story what that man went on how his life went on what she went on you know the whole story but I would say that their life was impacted their life was changed now we're all drawn to those stories and when when a man hears those stories Ries and he hears those works that Jesus did feeding the 5,000 feeding the 3,000 meeting the woman at the well talking to Nicodemus in the tree casting out Devils going to the pool of Bethesda isn't there something inside of you that says I'd like to be like that I'd like to have what he had that's the kind of that's the kind kind of person that I want to be and then when you hear his teachings and he says you know when someone smites thee in the cheek turn also to another if somebody offends you uh and even to 70 times in one day forgive them 70 times and can you you you realize that he is preaching a life amen that we don't have that's right there's a sharp contrast between this man and Mankind that's there was something if I could say this Supernatural amen about him that there was a difference about him I mean the kindness the the love the charity the meekness the humbleness uh uh just how he himself was moved upon that he wept when his friend died that that when he T when that Centurion came to him he he never vanished himself he never looked uh at himself and raised himself up that Centurion came to him he said master I I control many men I can say you go here and you go there and they do it now Jesus didn't say yes I'm like that right on brother no why him he says Master just speak the word and look what he did he never took the glory for that he said I've never seen such faith in all Israel he lifted that man up he gave that man the acknowledgement he gave that man the praise it was his faith your faith has done this you know that's marvelous I I I haven't even seen this in Israel and this is a Roman soldier and and and it moved him and and what was it that he possessed that allowed him to be like that now you say well he was God I I I want to stop a moment and remind you that he was a man like in US tempted in every way that we're tempted I I I would say that he was what he was because he was the love of God God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son he was a the gift of God to us he he was there to to show us the way and we know that there was a sharp contrast between human nature and the nature of God I would say that this was the the first time though there was shadows and glimpses of this life through prophet prophecy there was a prophet one time that was a great prophet and one day some children came and and mocked them and called them old Baldhead you know and mocked what he did and made fun of them you know why they were doing that because that's what they heard at home that's what they saw their parents was doing that's the things that they were saying and going on you know one one thing you might say things but I'll tell you something your children will tell on you it'll show up in their attitudes it'll show up in the way that they do things it'll show up in uh in a lot of things and so here they come up to this prophet and they start mocking him and the prophet curses him and a she bear comes and slays them now a lot of people says oh that was God no that was an angry Prophet God honored his prophet's words just like he honored Moses's prophet's word so we saw glimpses and shadows of this nature in men that sought after God all down through time men were hungering for God they were trying to be Christlike if I could say that or please God through a set of rules through a law don't do this don't do that don't do this don't do that we were fellowshipping the other day my boys and I and and uh the scripture was brought up that if Israel would have kept the law and done everything that the law said to do the outside kingdoms would have looked at Israel and accounted that to them for wisdom that's right they would appear to been very wise very orderly very smart and and they would have gained the respect so we saw that we've never had a nature like this walking in the presence of men in flesh you understand that this this was a a uh uh the works that he did the words that he spoke not just his Works he even said if you can't believe my words believe me for my works for they testify of who that I am so the very works that he was doing was showing that the things that he was speaking was truth amen and people marveled and so no man ever spoke like this man could you imagine been there when he gave the message on the uh The Sermon on the Mount we've call it I've been to that place where they say that this is where he sat and spoke and there's a hill that goes out and down at the bottom of the hill was the trading route that they took and down along the Sea of Galilee and and he sat up on that hill and he began to teach the the things that he taught blessed are the meek blessed are The Peacemaker people are hearing these things what are they hearing they're hearing somebody preach a different nature they're hearing Supernatural thinking they're they're hearing thinking and a way a man can think if he's free from sin and free from unbelief how a man can act how he can treat others if he's free from the nature that he was born with so we're told that we're shaped in sin born in iniquity and come into the world speaking lies you will lie when the truth sounds better you're nature will lie children will lie for no reason you know I mean they could have cookie on their face and a Oreo cookie in their hand and mama say Johnny did did you did you get a cookie no Mommy well who did it I don't know I don't know there used to be a cartoon when I was a kid it was called I don't know it was you know this I don't know person that's doing all this stuff you know taking the toys out of the closet who took the toys out of the closet I don't know did it and and it's in our nature so this is what I I want to just establish for a moment this morning we have a nature by birth that's contrary to God and that's why we have the terminology and Jesus said you must be born again and it's a necessity if I could say it this way for uh that nature our human nature our carnal mind and our carnal reactions that's got to die and we know and I I want to try to keep it simple to to reach as many levels of Christianity as I can this morning but we know that we got that nature that that wasn't the nature that Adam and Eve had in the beginning in the beginning Adam had the same nature that Jesus had amen he was a son of God so he got his nature from his father is that right I mean that pretty basic I know the world tries to teach everybody that it was an apple you know well if people realize that they're naked by eating an apple I say let's start passing out apples instead of Bibles you know it's absurd but if if they they didn't come to this realization and we talked about this and I won't go into this in depth I hope you try to listen to the sermons as they come and build it in your own life but we understood by the law of the seed that everything has to come forth of its own kind and if Satan was going to build the kingdom he had to have something that would reproduce itself that's right you understand because there there there was a law that every seed would come forth of its kind so he knew that he had to somehow interject his thinking his nature his seed into the human race in order for the human race to bring forth after his kind and so if if Satan would have never fallen and Adam and Eve would have never left the garden we all would have been born into the garden that's right that's we wouldn't have civilization out here we wouldn't have downtown Dallas and la and and the Eiffel Tower and the and all these what great things that man calls a Chie ments no we would have been born and grew up in the garden now can you think of that and because we're the Sons and Daughters of God that's where we're wanting to go back to is Back to Eden we want to go back to where we belong and where we came from and we're in a terrible detour down here and that detour was caused by sin it was caused by Eve allowing that seed of Satan to come into her life thinking that she would gain power and knowledge to become like God she believed Satan's lie as God's truth therefore she was beguiled and and and and she said well the Satan Satan lied to me and then when she brought this to Adam Adam had a choice he could have divorced her right then and she would have perished but Adam had that attribute in him you understand cuz he was a Son of God and and Eve was his you understand Eve was his it was bone of his bone flesh of his body it was a part of him his feminine part now was in her and there was a part of him that couldn't forsake her couldn't leave her he had so when when when when the when the death sentence was upon her because the there the day you eat thereof is the day you die so he knew that the death sentence was upon her but because that was his he had a promise he said I'll put enity between thy seed and the Serpent's Seed and it was based on that promise that he went out knowing that God would redeem him and now he was going forth and we begin to see the pollution of the seed there was Cain and Abel Abel was Adam's son Cain was Satan's son twins every Revival produces twins produces two kinds two natures and there it was there she was laid out out there and Adam trusted that that one day that enity would come between those natures and finally that one that was free from that nature showed up and it was Jesus Christ the second Adam amen the Son of God we could follow all the history I don't know why it took God so long but it wasn't long to God a day like a thousand years is but a day to God be patient on God he's always on time so it it he comes down to the great this great spot and all of a sudden he shows up the second Adam free from sin now tempted but free he didn't have the nature that man had he had the nature of God he had the love of God because God is love so that that's what he possessed he possessed a pure unadulterated Divine love amen in fact the scripture itself expresses it that God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son and the son himself said I do nothing unless the father reveals it to me I only do that which the father tells me to do these are not my works but they're The Works of the father that dwelleth in me who among you can find any evil in me or sin in me show me what I've done and when they finally came to the very thing that they thought that he had done that was worthy of death it was that he said that him and the father were one you blaspheme because you say before Abraham was I am oh Hallelujah there was that life back with us now that's what we want just to go down this morning just a little bit with you on some ABCs what is ABC always believe Christ we also refer to that as basic simple things that are the foundation for everything because you can get way off Way Off Track and religion you've got to remember religion is a covering religion covers up what you don't possess you've got to wrap yourself in something so nobody can see what's really on the inside but we're not interested in fixing the outside God works from the inside out we want to fix that heart we want the mind to be in us that was in Christ Jesus we want to think like he thinks we want to walk like he walks we want to talk what he how he talks and then the question is how can we become like this I'm I am stuck with n by Nature with desires of the Flesh in fact the scripture said that this nature that I was born with that I got from Adam and Eve it rules this member that's right so much so I do things that I wouldn't even want to do as you know uh that as I grew up I I I had a temper and and an out of control temper is a form of insanity where I would get so mad at the littlest things that I would become irrational I would say things do things throw things yell scream break things you know I'd break you if I could just you you just sit back and say this kid's insane but it was in my nature I don't know how it came there well I could I could track it all the way back to the devil I could honestly say the devil made me do it though I will say this a lot of us do stupid things that Satan wouldn't take any credit for but I'm I have this nature that it's uncontrollable it's Springs up it causes me to go after things do things say things repeat things uh that are totally totally unedifying don't help anybody don't even help me you know gossip never helps anybody but you know who gossip hurts more than the person that's being talked about is the person that's gossiping you gossip you lose all credibility you you you you lose the trust of those that are around you you you lose the respect of those that are around you and it takes one word the tongue is an unruly member and bitter and sweet can't come forth from the same Fountain no matter how much you're pressed to talk about somebody or to State your case or to make sure that everybody knows your side of the story may I say this peace be be still be still God will fight your battle if you're right God will take care of it truth will prevail you don't have to defend yourself you don't you don't have to put such a great effort out to for everybody to hear your side of the story because I guarantee you you invite you give your side of the story you're inviting somebody else to give their side of the story and when they give your their side of the story you won't look so Rosy pink they will slander you they will cover you with mud they would point out faults that you didn't think anybody else saw don't get into it don't fall for it don't don't don't become instant marriage counselors and instant financial counselors believe me you're basing everything and every decision that you're making on hearsay if you would take it back to this 13th chapter and the scripture says speaketh no evil vanishes not takes no re doesn't rejoice in iniquity you would stop in your tracks right there say I'm sorry friend I'm not going to go down that road that's my brother that's my sister God knows God will take care of it he's in control so we find out we've got a nature and we definitely [Music] need a nature change praise the Lord and therefore Jesus says You must be born again and what we refer to many times is as being borned again as receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit now there's two types of Christians there's the Christian that believe reads this word believes what it says and with everything in him tries to keep and obey the rules you say brother McGary is there a reward for that I would say yes it's a good way to live live and it produces benefits and then there's a Christian that does that but is Born Again hallu is Born Again words there's a Christian that has received the Holy Spirit and and I I just want to tck on this fundamentally real quickly this morning I've already already been longer than I wanted but we know there's a need for us to be free from the nature that we have okay so being a Christian isn't controlling your nature though we do all that we can to bring our body and subjection we do that by wisdom in other words if you touch the fire what happens you get burnt you should be able to know that without a move of the spirit that's right you should know the Bible says two don't walk together unless they agree that we don't keep company with Sinners right we don't have the appearance of evil all those things you can do and we should do and it's our reasonable service to do those things and that gives the appearance of Christianity but it doesn't mean that you've been born again it means that you recognize what's right and you're doing everything you can to bring yourself under subjection to the word of God and be a good person that's admirable and I believe if a person does that that will it will lead them to the New Birth because they'll get thirsty and they'll come to the point one day they'll find out though I want to do that which is good I do evil that's right when I do what I want to do that's right I do what I don't want to do and they find them eles in that place and the Lord knew that so he said I'll not leave you comfortless but I'll come again and I'll be with you even in you I'd like to read a statement if you don't mind and this is from what is the Holy Ghost and it simply says this upon this place we wish to approach the subject which I think is the outstanding subject of today amen and I think it's become a great confusion in the church what the Holy Ghost is and what the evidence of it is and what how we know that we have it and so if it's a requirement then naturally we want the requirement and our human nature would be to produce the requirement ourself so if you know it's like if I could say this it's like coming up with a fake ID you've all been raised right but I wasn't so if I wanted to go to a concert I'd Forge a ticket you know we get fake driver's license and everything what would we have to do we'd have to fake our identity we'd have to pretend we knew something we didn't you know come up well I'm with the band or I'm with the team I pulled up one place and the guys thought we were the ESPN broadcasters they open the gate for me and they parked me in the spot and open the door and I'm up with ESPN wo this is pretty good and something inside of me said liar liar pants on fire so I simply walked out of there before I showed up on Nation TV and went to my little place to watch the person that I wanted to talk to we don't want fake okay we don't want religion we don't want a false front we we don't want everybody to think we are something we're not we want to be real we want to be genuine so it's a great subject of today how many would say it's a a great subject of today a question and in every generation comes up to this question so I mean you know I'm 75 years old this year October 27th so you don't forget I've battled all these questions do you think they go away every time that I do something I don't want to do you don't think Satan's right on my shoulder saying you don't have the Holy Ghost well I I settled it I just simply say to him ABA father amen right he's faithful and just if you sin you confess your sin it goes before you we cry ABA father because he's just and faithful to forgive us I don't go rebuild my Christianity over one mistake I settle it I settle it the flesh Wars against the spirit the spirit Wars against the flesh these are two country he says upon the the I think the most outstanding subject of today of the word what is the Holy Spirit now listen to this because this is very beautiful what is it is it an anointing that falls from the sky and gets on you and you feel it and it causes you to uh dance or speak in tongues or prophesy Paul stopped for a moment and he said you can do all these things that's right and it's nothing that's right so the holy spirit is something you understand it's not a myth it's not an anointing it is a substance it is a reality it is a POS possession it's something you can know that you've got it has an everlasting effect that's why in the scriptures it's re referred to as a seal until the day of your Redemption when you've got the Holy Ghost you've got it it don't come it don't go it don't leave now you may grieve it away but I'll guarantee you it'll be on that limb calling to you calling to you calling to you to come under repentance it'll make you so miserable you'll find a closet someday and you'll beg for its return Hall cuz you can't live without it you can't live without it amen amen so what we're just going to Simply say these few little things I have taken the subject in line like this you cannot come and receive the Holy Spirit unless you know what it is a lot of people want the Holy Ghost they go to a meeting the preachings of Evangelistic everybody's there they're fired up and the presence of the Lord sweeps through the place and people start falling out in the spirit I'm not against any of those things I've done those things I've probably spoken tongues more than you all that's a quote and you want that that you say I want that well that's not what it is it may be an effect of it it may be a result it may be a rain falling it may be momentarily but it's not what it is to be born again it's not what it is to have the Holy Spirit so can until you know what it is you can't receive it unless you know what it is and you cannot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you so even after you know what it is you've got to know it's given to you A lot of people want it but they're still wai in the balance of whether it's for them whether they're worthy whether they should get it what's it going to do they know it's real I know what that is and I believe I know what it is but you can't receive it until you think it's for you most people that's where he stops them and that's why we spent such a a time last week expr in to you justification until you totally realize you've never did it in the first place you will not be able to go on with God until you know your sins are forgiven and that Jesus Christ paid the price for your sins and the chastisement of of your peace was upon him and by his stripes you're healed you must know it for those you that this is paragraph 22 it says unless you know what it is and you canot receive it if you know what it is unless you believe it's given to you and it's for you so it can be offered until you accept that part of it and then you cannot know whether you've got it or not unless you know what results it brings think of that I wondered why the prophet of God so early built this Foundation into his ministry now I personally believe it's the wisdom of God that that Ministry was totally in the hands of God and God was building a message he was laying it Brick by Brick Stone by Stone he was introducing to the church F storing food in the storehouse knowing that it would be called upon according to need so there there's there there's milk in this doorhouse there's meat in the storehouse you can't always be preaching T-bone steaks your babies will die you know you got to have a full gospel and the scripture says unless you become like Little Children You shall not enter the kingdom of God some of us neglect the child in us the youth in US of the word of God we we come to some imagination that were theolog and we understand all Mysteries and and and we know the seals and we know predestination and we know the great Union and and we studied it all and then the very Simplicity of Charity and good works and laying a pattern of Good Works in our life is gone and what are we we're tinkling symbols we're sounding brass and what we've got vanishes away in other words it vanish away means there Comes A Time is not useful can you imagine walking up to a person lying sick and say I want you to know the first horse rider no I like that Soldier remember that little boy you know when the lightning was flashing and and and Mama coming in the room and the boy was all scared and he he he and she says oh son don't worry she says Jesus will take care and he says mama I I like Jesus In the Flesh you know the guy that was dying on the battlefield and the chaplain come up and the old Catholic chaplain come up and knelt down he said hell Mary uh Mother of God full of grace and he said wait a minute he says I'm dying I don't want no secretary Hallelujah get me to the main guy is that when un let you know the results it brings so if you know what it is and who it is and what action it brings when it it comes then you'll know what you've got when you got it see that's just would settle it right he says now I said brother jeffes if you sent me down to turn off your oil well and I didn't know nothing about it I'd probably blow it up I might turn the wrong key and or start the wrong motor I'd have to know how to do it before I did it and that's the way with receiving the Holy Ghost you've got to know what you're coming for and how to receive it and what it is I want just going to read a few things I just want to settle this kind of Simply this morning this is paragraph 53 now before we read it i' just like to say a few uh commenting words here what is the Holy Ghost it's a seal what is the Holy Ghost it's a covenant it's an agreement hallelujah it's a covenant it's a seal so it's all these things right what is the Holy Ghost it's a sign it's a sign it's a seal it's a covenant you can study each one of those things out what is the Holy Ghost then it's the spirit of Jesus Christ in you that sums it up amen it's not an anointing outside and with the presence of Jesus Christ comes everything that Jesus is he's unchanging he's a deliverer he's a savior he's he's a a a a a a Healer and a counselor he's the Prince of Peace he's the Mighty God so where he is all his attributes are hallelujah it's not one little outpouring here and one little outpouring here the holy spirit is the spirit of Jesus Christ in you now what does that Spirit do what did we just say it was it's a nature it's the nature natur of God it's the personality of God it's God himself was in human form in Jesus Christ he paid the price of Calvary he went and told them go in the upper room until you're endued with power from on high what was Jesus's power it was his nature it was the love that he possessed for the world Amen it was his recognition of Satan at every one of his tricks you say his power no his power was in the word it is written it is written it is written his power was his nature right true and that's why Paul says you can do all kinds of mirac Miracles you can do all these things but if you don't have the nature of Jesus Christ it's unprofitable there's people that heal for money you want to get in certain people's prayer lines let's say you wanted brother Benny Hinn to pray for you you say do people get healed in his ministry of course they do when they fall out is it real sure it is but they're not going to let you walk up on that platform unless you're invested unless you're expecting something to happen that's right you get pre-qualified so they come and they talk to you and they want you to give a seat offering are you willing to give $10,000 to this ministry or $5,000 to this ministry or 2,000 or are you willing you believe enough in this that you would plant something in it and and sure they they've given they're expecting they they've they've covered their bases and they go up and they get touched or they fall over or they get healed and what does it do it profits them nothing what good does it do if a man gains the whole world and loses his soul what is the prophet and I'm not talking prophetic prophet as in a prophet messenger I'm talking Prophet as in a a gain what is the prophet of Christianity it's the resurrection it's the Rapture what good does it do you if you miss that if your body's not quickened well what if you have all the recognition and all the spirituality and everybody thinks you're great and everybody loves your personality and and and and you you you you've you've laid hands on the sick and you've done all these great things and and he'll come and say I never knew you in other words there was no identity of myself in you praise the Lord there was nothing I could connect with you did all these things but you did them on your own valtion you did them by your own understanding and and you say well I got results you know what he'll say to you I'm true to my word that's right amen God's already healed if someone gets you to accept your healing you've accepted your healing you can give that man all the credit you want but the credit goes to Calvary amen that's where the credit goes cuz it's a finished work he said a little while said Jesus and the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I will be with you even in you till the end of the world and and so we we find out that we we fail to stay with the basics the holy spirit being born again is a change of nature you got a nature from your natural birth I don't care how saintly and godly your parents are Lesley is one of the most Godly women I've ever met she just she she remembers people's birthdays you know she reminds me every day this is this brother's birthday this is this brother's birthday I'm sitting in my heart saying what do I care the old guy's just getting older and we're all going to die anyway and what difference that made she no no you this guy's been faithful to you you you call them and let him know you know and and you know and and if she reads her Bible Every Morning has her devotions sits down listens to a tape gets out in the backyard probably knowing she has to pray me through so if I don't do something disastrous and as Godly as she was she produced three Renegade boys I'm a witness if you if you want me to vindicate that statement I got to list this long so we find out that it's not something that's passed on okay it requires a what a birth a birth to be born again means to have a change of nature how do you know you have it what is the result of the spirit of Jesus Christ coming in you it changes your nature it changes the way you think it changes the way you treat people it changes the way you talk and you notice it you know the difference it takes the tempter from the inside dwelling to the outside trying to get back in to where you did things by the the Natural Spirit of man instinctly you just do it you wouldn't think it through there was no check in you you just did it you didn't like somebody you just did it you cursed you cursed you told lies you you done you lusted after this you lusted after that you had you no regard for your soul and then maybe a word come by you or the spirit begin to call on you and all of a sudden you started to realize there's something wrong with this guy and this isn't taking me nowhere maybe you even heard the wages of sin as death and maybe you became conscious of a life after however God dealt with you there came a time that you begin to realize the life in the nature you were living was terrible hu and you wanted to be different and you wanted to receive something different so what is it that you want to receive so we know this by teaching I'm just not going to go into it but you can have the anointing of the Holy Spirit and never have your nature changed you can have the Holy Spirit on you every day of your life and still go to hell it's not the anointing that we're interested it that comes and go as God's permits but it's the nature change that we must have we must become new creatures in Christ Jesus we start putting away carnal things we put away the carnal mind we put away carnal thinking we bring this flesh under subjection we have a new nature a new spirit there's something else living inside of us and it's summed up in a very simple scripture two scriptures would would you turn to uh John 13 I think it's verse 6 and I'll turn this down and the the the scripture is simply if the same spirit that dwelt in Jesus Christ dwell in you it will Quicken your mortal bodies thank you Lord now we all want to go forward with God isn't really what we want to become into that Perfection when that which is perfect is come we we wanted we want to that's where we're what we're going to we can study the church all the way down Through the Ages can't we and and and we can we we follow the spirit up through Luther up justification up through sanctification up to the Holy Ghost and now we're coming to a Capstone and he says this he said in paragraph 4 now the spirit of God has worked under justification it is in the last days performing and doing the very same things that it did when it was in Christ what is it the church in Christ has become one that's right the bride and the bridegroom have become one amen their natures and desires have become one what is the whole secret of marriage it's the wife's desire is towards her husband not towards social living not towards Freedom not towards being the kind of wife that she wants or what she thinks her her desire now becomes towards your husband they become one that's what she's made for now she got a different program that guy's better off on the roof because there'll be no peace can you imagine a church this desires not to him it's not to be like him it's not to be for him but it it comes to teach their Doctrine to teach their Creeds to teach their do dogmas to collect their money to further their program to get more members to build bigger buildings to have greater influence to have some great big show that makes it look like God's with us look at all this God's with us God's here God's there no one thing counts one thing only you must be born again I didn't say Anointed The Mystery of this day is how you can receive the nature of Jesus Christ without sensation your nature changes all the things that you were all of a sudden you don't want to be did did your outside body change no it's going to get changed but your Nature's changed your outlooks changed your thoughts have changed you're a new creature in Christ Jesus you live by the word your ear is inclined to his word you pray if you start down the same road that Spirit that's in you Christ in you he checks you amen amen the very word of God says pray to him who's within you he that is in you is greater in the world Lorden we first of all got to break this idea that the holy spirit is something that's on the outside it's something that's in US it abides in US it lives in us it's him Christ in US is the hope of glory and if the same spirit that was in in him the same nature that was in him being you it will also Quicken your mortal body Hallelujah and you say oh birming you make it so dry I'm not making it dry I'm making it simple you get the nature of Jesus Christ in you and you watch The Joy bell ring you watch the smile on your face you watch how you treat people you when you watch when that old nature Rises up you say down boy you say Aba father forgive me Lord I didn't mean that that's right that nature in you corrects you of sin it corrects you of unbelief it leads you and guides you into all truth and righteousness you know you've had a nature change you know what it is you know what you're expecting when you get the Holy Ghost you're expecting for these lust these desires of the world these hatress these males these envies You're Expecting those things to go away you don't get the Holy Ghost with oh hope I get the Holy Ghost and I hope this goes away no you know it's for you you know that spirit's for you you know he died that you could have it and when you get down on your knees you're asking that the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ the mind that was in his mind come in you and you become a tabernacle of the spirit of the Lord Jesus and and it makes you different it makes you say you're sorry I've had to go to people write letters say I'm sorry I done wrong forgive me here's the only thing I can do to make it right thank you I wish I had have never done it you think that's me I'll guarantee you you're lucky you ever get apologize for me I'll guarantee I'll figure out some way to make it your fault but the spirit of this age is repentance the Spirit of him in you demands you to make things right and say you're sorry you can have all the malice I tell the brothers all the time you know guys work for me I don't know whether they're working for free or whether they're paying you know if I if I forget to pay you something write me an invoice come to tell me you owe me money you know if you Harbor bitterness you go to hell and I'm free of the money it only better fits me in a root of bnet suril many I'm talking about getting back to being Christians I'm talking getting back about living about Jesus I'm talking about every day that's what you think about am I Christ like am I a daughter of Christ am I a Son of God is his Spirit living in me you know the prophet of God said I'm going to paraphrase it but he he said I'm tired of all this super duper religion you know what he said repent right if you're living right and doing right and concentrating on being like Jesus these Works shall follow you they're automatic they're not not produced by anointing they're produced by the love that's shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit you care enough for somebody you pray for him you care enough for somebody you want him free from the bondage of Satan you know that Satan can be defeated because it was defeated in you you know he lives and you know he lives in you Christ in me the hope of glory this is what he's saying say he says under Pentecost the last days he says he says they connect together the last link shall go through the sky shouting up will come Wesley Luther all the rest of them back in those days there he that's the first will be last and the last will be first and there will be coming in the resurrection we're at the end time listen that's what the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost by justification see just a light shadow of it the Holy Spirit by sanctification a little deeper shadow of it the Holy Ghost by baptism of it a deeper Shadow now the Holy Ghost by the restoration of its very person being in here that's when it's perfect amen when that invisible Union between the Christ and bride and they become one did you find that scripture the one that says it was St John 13:6 yeah I I you might be able to jump jump to it but I I'll see if I can find it the one I'm looking for is simply this it says I give you a new commandment I used to know all these scriptures by heart I just can't believe that I'm I'm failing the scripture says I give you a new commandment yes here it is St John 13:34 I I told you I always go a verse or two back listen to this a new commandment I give unto you that ye love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another where does that come from it comes from the love of God Amen being shed abroad in Your Heart by the holy spirit it's Christ in you loving now I would love to go on but I'm going to close CU I would just love to go back into sanctification and I'll save this quote if you would like to go read it at home and and then uh it's in the invisible Union of the Bride paragraph 262 all the way if the musicians would come you know all the way to 270 and I'll just read this little thing that he says you're a virtuous bride of of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless sons of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he Washed by the Water of his own blood that becomes flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated in the bosom of the father before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of God Called Love he says you stand completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to you church as we go off the air just in a minute you are standing if you're standing on God's word and with God's word word every amen every jot every tit where are you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them suckers and get get out here in the wheat where you can get ripe before the sun I hear the coming combines you're standing completely Justified like you never did it in the first place Hallelujah how do you know you have it until you know what result you know what result it brings you walk away from your past you walk away from that Old nature and you lift your hands up you say I'm free I know I've been a Christian a long time and I've probably been down more wrong roads than right if all the times I had to tell the Lord I'm sorry it would fill this room and the building next door and ever and ever there's never one thing I'll forget I'll never forget the chains that I was in when I was in that hippie State under the influence of drugs and under the influence of Satan and the bitterness and the hatred that I had in my heart I was so full of [Music] hate I could slit your throat and not drop a tear you might not see that in me now but I wanted to join the Hell's Angels defi Society one day he came he didn't seek me I didn't seek Him He sought me one day he came I never read a book The Bible I was raised a Catholic we didn't read the Bible and I open this book to Romans chapter 1 and I started reading truce Breakers Inc continent despisers of them that are good man with man woman with woman doing those things with ours and I'm sitting there and and that was my condition I was all those things I was in terrible shape I was running with perverts and drug addicts and and I had no no control over my life I totally lost it I was under the bondage of addiction I couldn't find a drop of love in my heart for anybody I found myself hours and hours and days and days living in a house with my shades drawn dark listening to every kind of perverted music I could find to find some sort of meaning in life and I remember when those guys were all there I was in this room and I had the iron Horsemen Hell's Angels rock musicians and everybody in that room and the big garbage party you could think of and they were all inv inviting me to join him and something come over me and I remember I just shook there shaking with chills the the evil that was surrounding me I I could see demon faces on people and I remember I got so cold I had an old gas oven and I I I uh put down the oven door and I turned on the oven and I got up on top of it trying to get the warmth from the oven to get me warm and I remember I stepped off and I walked into my room and I fell on my knees and I said God help me I don't know what I am but I'm not this that's all I said I'm not this this is not what I am it's not what I want to to be cuzz I didn't know where to go and a guy out of mockery told me why don't you read the Bible and I did and I read Romans chapter 1 and I Heard a Voice and a voice started reading that chapter to me and I sat there and I read it and I listened to this voice read every word to me and I bowed my head and I said I want this Spirit Lord to come into my life now remember I'll never forget a little girl was riding her bike down the street down this little Hill and she lost control and 10 minutes earlier I had have laughed called her a stupid little bratty snot-nosed kid you got exactly what you deserve and all of a sudden I sprung up I cared for her I ran off the jump down and ran up to her bike and my hair's all long and curly I got beard my eyes are Beady you know and I said dark are you all right like the scared her to death but something happen you know he gave me a promise that he'd never leave me nor forsake me and I've had one goal ever since and that's that John 1334 you put it up again a new commandment I give you a Commandment that you love one another as I have loved you and I remember how he loved me am and I'm never going to forget that if I fail he's never forsaken me he's never left me am I perfect no do I want to be yes do I want to overcome yes because it's given to the Overcomer but I don't want to forget the very ABC is that he gave me an opportunity to have a new nature and too many of us are walking away from that nature for Doctrine for theology I don't want to be at battle with the world I don't want to be at battle with anybody else in this message there's only one thing I long for anybody that they can know the joy of having Jesus Christ come in their heart and life [Music] there's nothing like it let's stand this morning with every head bowed every heart to the Lord you ask yourself this [Music] morning what's ruling in my mortal being What [Music] Spirit has control this morning is it my old grumpy human [Music] nature and you would say Lord I I really want your spirit I want your Holy Spirit your Holy Spirit not the Holy Spirit or a holy spirit but your Holy Spirit to live in my heart to control my thinking I want to surrender my desires to your will or maybe you've been aw for him this morning and you'd like not lift your hand to me my eyes are closed and my hand is up and you'd like to lift your hand and say Lord I'd like to get back on track I would like your spirit and your nature to come take your Abode in me I want to forgive others as you have forgiven me I want to lay a pattern of Good Works in my life The Works that you do Lord I want to do those works in the life that I live in I want to be more like you Lord I I want to be free from my frustrations my anger my bitterness I want to leave this old man behind and I want to be born again I want to be really born again I want to have a new me a new nature I want to sit in Heavenly places in you Christ Jesus I don't want to be governed by rules and doctrines Lord I want the life that I've seen in display even in this age living in the first fruit the Sheep wave offering father I want that love that [Music] nature I don't want a substitute I want the real thing Lord I want the love of God shed abroad in my heart this morning Lord and you paid a price at Calvary that I could have this spirit and I believe Lord that you died for me and that this spirit is for me it fits the desire of my heart it is for me it was given to make me whole I was designed to receive it it was made to fit the person I am it's for me and Lord I know I could live happier and Freer with that Spirit living in me and I'm asking you this morning without sensation without some outwardly thing for the whole world to see but that you would come and dwell in me Lord and I'm sorry for the things that I've done and said the things that I'm watching the things that I'm reading the things that I'm listening to and Lord I know that if you would take your abod in my heart that I would lose the desire for those things my old man has a desire for those things Lord but I'm asking today that I could become born [Music] again that you would give me the birth of your nature and Lord if I could just walk in that maybe down life's Road I'd be worthy of a gift or two but let me start on the foundation which can none other can be laid than that which is laid which is Christ Jesus in this last day living in people father I ask that you would grant that for those that have asked it I'm not ashamed father to admit that I need more of you I get wore down and grumpy and and I don't want to be like that Lord I get forgetful and maybe I hurt people Lord I don't want to be like that but if you renew yourself in me make me more aware of the importance of your presence in my daily and hourly and present tense actions that Christ could live and radiate and the love of God could be shed abroad in My Heart by the Holy Spirit I ask that for myself and for all those that raised their hand this morning that we could return back to what we built on the love of God in Christ Jesus our lord [Music] amen amen oh spirit of God your word in heart my whole be unto my life spirit of God move and empty vessel I want to be so that you can [Music] me is that your desire I lift my hands and surrender lay it all on the altar I don't want to

here how many believe that he's got His Garment laid out over the congregation this morning that if you want to touch it you can touch it there's something that made that possible for us to have the nature we have and to have this nature go away and his nature come in and that was the blood of Jesus Christ God meets every believer under that blood if you're faithful to confess your sins he's faithful and just to forgive them there's no Christianity built on Doctrine built on Creeds all Christianity is built on the love that he had for us I give you a new commandment that you love one another as I have loved [Music] you a love that caused him to lay down his life that's what he's done for you let that nature be on us watch your world change watch your bank account not bother you
