[22:17] that we certainly are in perilous
[22:23] times so many
[22:26] voices so many unur
[22:30] certainties but there's been one
[22:32] constant that's never changed and that's
[22:35] the great North
[22:37] Star it's your word father that has
[22:40] endured Through the
[22:43] Ages has
[22:45] guided man through every phase of
[22:50] civilization from horse and buggy to car
[22:53] to plane to
[22:56] Rocket no matter where science goes no
[22:59] matter where education goes no matter
[23:02] where civilization goes your word is the
[23:05] one thing that guides your elect to
[23:09] their Eternal
[23:10] destination we ask that that word would
[23:12] bless us this evening we ask these
[23:15] things in Jesus precious name we pray
[23:19] amen if you have your Bibles let's just
[23:22] open it up to the uh scripture that
[23:25] we've been studying from and uh and in
[23:30] the Book of
[23:32] Revelations the 3D
[23:35] chapter
[23:42] and in the 20 first
[23:48] verse Revelations 3 and
[23:52] 21 to him that
[23:55] overcometh will I grant to sit with with
[23:58] me in my
[24:00] throne even as I also overcame and sat
[24:06] down with my father in his throne he
[24:11] that hath ear to hear Let Him hear what
[24:14] the spirit saith unto the churches
[24:17] father bless your word in your precious
[24:19] name we pray amen amen God bless you may
[24:22] be seated nice to be in the house of the
[24:24] Lord this evening we've been uh
[24:29] listening and we'll finish up uh this
[24:31] evening with uh the message uh how can I
[24:38] overcome and we know that
[24:41] overcome uh to overcome something means
[24:45] there has to be an obstacle or there has
[24:48] to be uh uh some obstacle trying to keep
[24:53] you from achieving your goal so you it's
[24:57] something that's going to rise up that
[25:00] you have to deal with that you have to
[25:04] get past that you have to overcome it
[25:08] because it's trying to overcome you so
[25:11] it's a automatic battle set right before
[25:14] you and you didn't Institute that so
[25:18] it's not something that you brought upon
[25:21] yourself it's something that has been
[25:24] placed in your path it's an obstacle if
[25:27] you're driving down the road and there's
[25:29] a tree Laying across the road and you
[25:32] want to go down further down that road
[25:35] well you'll have to overcome that
[25:37] obstacle to go any farther because the
[25:40] purpose of that obstacle is to stop you
[25:44] from proceeding on your journey to where
[25:47] you're going and this is uh what is uh
[25:51] granted here so we see in the framework
[25:54] of of what is uh written here he says
[25:57] him that overcometh I will grant to sit
[26:01] with me in my father's Throne so we know
[26:04] what that what the goal is because we
[26:08] know what it is we have to overcome so
[26:11] he says if you overcome this is your
[26:14] reward and that's what we're going to
[26:16] listen to tonight is the rewards of the
[26:19] ages so we realize that what we're
[26:22] overcoming is uh well the enemy is the
[26:27] obstacle that we have to overcome
[26:30] remember he comes up with all kinds of
[26:33] different
[26:34] tricks he comes up with different things
[26:37] to get you off course different things
[26:39] to slow you down different things to
[26:43] make it difficulty but it's not the
[26:45] thing
[26:46] itself that's the is our enemy or what
[26:51] we have to overcome we have to overcome
[26:54] the person that's putting it there so if
[26:57] you're walking down down the road and
[26:59] and all of a sudden this obstacle comes
[27:02] up in your way you're not really dealing
[27:05] with the obstacle you're dealing with
[27:07] the person that put it there and if you
[27:10] know you have power over him then you
[27:13] know you have power over his works and
[27:17] so you just move that obstacle and
[27:20] that's why the prophet of God said this
[27:22] he said to overcome means to recognize
[27:26] Satan in every one of his tricks so it
[27:29] doesn't matter what trick he puts up
[27:31] there it doesn't matter what thing he
[27:35] poses before you you've got to recognize
[27:38] it as being something that's trying to
[27:41] keep you from obtaining your goal so one
[27:45] of the things he tries to do is to
[27:49] get take our vision from us from what it
[27:53] is that we're living for what it what it
[27:56] is we're trying to obtain pain where it
[27:59] is that we're trying to go so we're just
[28:02] not we're just not uh trying to live a
[28:05] daily life and and take it one day at a
[28:09] time so to speak and and and no we're on
[28:12] a
[28:13] journey we're trying to get somewhere
[28:16] we're trying to prepare for something so
[28:19] we we we don't want and so that's what
[28:21] tton does he's he's he's always
[28:24] traveling to uh he's always doing what
[28:27] he can to keep us us from uh uh getting
[28:30] farther and then so I like what the the
[28:33] messenger he he makes this statement I
[28:36] was going to I had it marked here see if
[28:38] I can I can find it
[28:42] uh but he he makes the statement he says
[28:45] it's not it's not it's the Overcomer is
[28:49] he who finishes it's not a lot who
[28:52] starts but it's but it's if if you
[28:54] finish and that's the that's the
[28:57] important thing is to finish he said he
[29:00] says not not he that starts he that
[29:05] finishes many start the race but there's
[29:08] only one finishes it there'll be many
[29:12] churches start many groups of people but
[29:16] there'll be one group finished and
[29:19] that's the Overcomer so the to over to
[29:23] come means to
[29:24] finish you know and so it's not just
[29:28] just one obstacle it's every obstacle
[29:31] it's every battle that's what it is
[29:33] because you've got your goal set you
[29:36] know it is where you're going you know
[29:38] what it is that you're living for you
[29:40] know what it is that you you're trying
[29:42] to obtain and you're trying to achieve
[29:45] and you know the condition you've got to
[29:47] be in to to be ready because the bride's
[29:49] made herself ready so when you begin to
[29:53] you get uh you get the the picture of it
[29:57] is you you he wants to get you out of
[30:02] focus he wants you know another we we
[30:05] quit we we we quit looking all the way
[30:09] down the road now remember he talked
[30:11] about the boy on the bicycle he says
[30:13] what's your secret he says I keep my eye
[30:16] on the prize I keep my eye on the road
[30:20] and the end of the road the end of the
[30:22] board the end of the path and that that
[30:25] keeps me from going this way or that way
[30:27] now that sounds so simple but we just
[30:31] went through he he began to talk about
[30:33] the three tricks and the different
[30:35] things that Satan's doing so you've got
[30:37] to understand that you got an enemy
[30:39] that's going about like a roaring line
[30:41] always trying to get you to fail to keep
[30:44] in your memory that there's a heaven to
[30:48] gain we we we were
[30:51] purchased not just to live a good life
[30:53] here but we were purchased to go back to
[30:58] what we were in the beginning so it's
[31:01] not to finished so then and we I just
[31:04] want to bring up this little point
[31:07] in he
[31:10] said he said no we he he mentioned to us
[31:13] that we're born defeated so we couldn't
[31:16] do it on our own right he paid the price
[31:18] for us he he got he he he gave his life
[31:22] and he says and he talking about your
[31:25] birth he says and that birth can never
[31:27] bring you to life because you're born
[31:30] defeated and you're born in a def
[31:33] defeated World amongst defeated people
[31:36] amongst defeated Creeds defeated
[31:38] denomination you've got to come to a
[31:42] victory some
[31:47] way he says just like the Lily and you
[31:50] remember this from last night uh last
[31:52] time we played it he talked about the
[31:54] Lily being in the bottom it's got to
[31:57] come to the victory
[31:58] some way and I like what he says here
[32:00] now I think that's overcoming that's
[32:04] that once in sin once did things that
[32:08] was wrong but don't worry about it
[32:14] now once did things that was wrong then
[32:18] why look back into the pond
[32:22] again you can't look back you know what
[32:25] I mean he said God by
[32:29] his predestination see has brought this
[32:32] seed of life and it's pressing itself
[32:37] see coming to light and now on top of it
[32:41] all it has
[32:43] overcome it doesn't Express itself down
[32:46] there it's getting up to express itself
[32:50] neither did you in your sin and adultery
[32:55] and everything you lived in you didn't
[32:58] Express
[33:00] nothing just think of that you didn't
[33:03] Express nothing but there was a seed
[33:07] there and it's got a chance to press
[33:11] itself into the light and now you in the
[33:16] presence of Jesus with the sun light s
[33:19] so n light it brought you
[33:22] out what you brought you out you really
[33:26] was in the beginning see what I mean you
[33:30] saw the light and you bloomed out so in
[33:33] other words he talking using the little
[33:35] as example it had to press its way
[33:37] through the mud it had to press its way
[33:39] through the water it had to press its
[33:41] way through the weeds it had to it had
[33:43] to keep pressing it has to keep
[33:45] overcoming but one day it
[33:47] blossoms and so that's what we got to
[33:50] understand don't look back look forward
[33:52] know that there's something that we've
[33:54] that we're obtaining notice that there's
[33:56] going to be obstacles in our way and the
[33:59] Overcomer doesn't get defeated he
[34:01] doesn't stop believing that there's a
[34:04] reward he doesn't stop believing that
[34:07] he's been paid for if Satan can get you
[34:10] to look at your own worth you're
[34:13] done if you can get to look and think
[34:16] that you got some ability to make it
[34:19] you're done but you've got to know one
[34:21] thing he that is in me is greater than
[34:23] he that is the world what he put in me
[34:27] is greater I'm not overcoming by myself
[34:30] I'm Overcoming By The Grace that he put
[34:33] in me and if I keep pressing that battle
[34:37] see we we we take that and we turn it
[34:40] into a
[34:41] Doctrine and then it just becomes a
[34:44] Creed and it's just something we believe
[34:47] no it's not something we believe every
[34:49] day I'm in a battle I got to press the
[34:52] Mark I got to leave those things which
[34:55] are behind got to press for a high
[34:57] calling I got to recognize Satan in
[35:00] every one of his tricks every time he
[35:02] tries to get me off course I've got to
[35:04] make sure I'm off course and I got to
[35:06] keep pressing it and now so we're going
[35:09] to pick up right there and now he's
[35:11] going to talk about the reward of the
[35:14] Overcomer so we know why we're
[35:18] overcoming why do I want to overcome
[35:23] this why do I want to get the
[35:25] victory over this
[35:28] now salvation is
[35:30] free you're not rewarded with eternal
[35:33] life you always had eternal life eternal
[35:37] Life's a gift of God this any man should
[35:40] boast but if you do certain things if
[35:44] you read the scriptures certain thing
[35:46] things Merit
[35:49] results they Merit benefits C you know
[35:53] if you do certain things you you you
[35:56] know it produces a result sin has a wage
[36:01] Works has a wage and so you you you've
[36:05] got with them that that it's this this
[36:08] pressing for this reward that we know we
[36:10] can't overcome ourselves but we know
[36:12] there's something in us he that is in US
[36:15] is greater so there's something in me
[36:17] the Lily didn't know what it was when it
[36:19] was in the bottom of the muck but it
[36:22] just kept striving because there's
[36:24] something in it and that's what we we
[36:26] want to realize that that's that part of
[36:28] us that's an overcomer so God placed in
[36:33] us it's to to the Overcomer to the
[36:36] Overcomer to the Overcomer so it's not
[36:39] you don't get out of the
[36:42] battle you face the battle every day and
[36:46] one day our Victory will be tremendous
[36:49] so we're going to pick up uh right there
[36:52] where almost where we left off the other
[36:55] uh the other night
[36:57] on uh uh I think we we're going to start
[37:02] at paragraph uh I think uh somewhere
[37:06] around 138 or 36 or something like that
[37:11] uh if you have your books and uh and
[37:15] we're going to pick up right right in
[37:16] there I think we stopped at paragraph
[37:20] 142 I believe the other day so we're
[37:22] just going to back up a paragraph and uh
[37:26] yeah and then he we're going to going to
[37:27] pick up where he starts the third great
[37:29] assault of Satan so Satan's the who we
[37:33] got to overcome and I believe that the
[37:36] Lord will help us overcome every time so
[37:39] God bless you as we listen to the last
[37:41] 30 minutes of this uh message how can I
[37:45] overcome and this is a good book to keep
[37:48] around and delve into and study every
[37:52] now and then and don't forget you're in
[37:54] the battle you're in a battle I
[37:57] Christian they want to preach
[37:58] Christianity nowadays is boy once you
[38:01] get in it's all joy and happiness yeah
[38:04] it is joy and happiness but we still got
[38:08] that guy and one day we're GNA put him
[38:11] in the Lake of
[38:12] Fire where he belongs you looking
[38:15] forward to that day I am God bless you
[38:17] as we listen to our
[38:20] messenger old true servant ever tries to
[38:23] show himself off of with God's power if
[38:26] he does he loses right then third great
[38:31] Assa Satan offered to Forfeit this
[38:34] Kingdom to
[38:36] him he did Satan said see these Kings of
[38:40] the world these are
[38:42] mine I'll do with them whatever I want
[38:45] to I'll forfeit them to you but you
[38:48] remember he was trying to get him to
[38:50] Forfeit it without the
[38:52] cross if he did we'd be
[38:55] lost he could have touch the the
[38:58] kingdom but he must follow the he must
[39:01] come back he was tempted to do it
[39:03] now death a hard thing he was tempted to
[39:09] take his Liberty and be the king of the
[39:13] earth without the cross but if you did
[39:18] his subject for to die Satan would have
[39:20] gladly made that proposition with him
[39:22] but he said get behind me sat he's
[39:25] getting done he come and suffered and
[39:29] took the hard rugged route he took the
[39:32] route of persecution he took the route
[39:35] of death are we this morning willing to
[39:37] do take that same route that he taken
[39:40] are we willing to die are we willing to
[39:43] give ourselves up to God for all the
[39:46] world and things to serve for him now he
[39:50] failed to do it willingly to to Forfeit
[39:53] it Satan was to him but he didn't do it
[39:56] though Jesus was tempted he overcome for
[39:59] us
[40:03] he he endured all
[40:05] Temptations for me and for you see he
[40:09] could have took it right then but what
[40:11] did he take the other rout for so that
[40:14] we could come be with him and if he paid
[40:17] such a price as that then how little
[40:20] would we
[40:22] be not to take it am when you remember
[40:26] there's nothing here
[40:28] anyhow right if you live a 100 years why
[40:30] you go to come to mental in your mind
[40:32] gone all crippled up and roll and shaky
[40:36] that's where you're going that's right
[40:37] and that's the end of it you come now
[40:41] overcome the pain how do you do it by
[40:43] the word amen what the word says you do
[40:46] walk humble live before Jesus he endured
[40:49] all things for you and I he is our
[40:51] example how to overcome our evil
[40:54] generation as he overcome his evil gener
[40:57] a remember when he come to the Earth
[40:59] there just as much unbelief or more than
[41:01] there is at anytime it didn't bother him
[41:03] a bit when they called him a devil
[41:06] instead of God when they called him
[41:07] everything that could be done it didn't
[41:09] bother him a bit he had one objective
[41:11] mind the father keep the word the word
[41:14] is God he had one

[59:11] sick people evil spirits went out of
[59:14] there and great Miracles were done now
[59:18] you're the same Lord Jesus today Paul
[59:22] preached this word and wrote this word
[59:25] the same word that we're trying to
[59:27] follow because he took the Old Testament
[59:30] and patterned it and showed that it was
[59:32] a type that all of the Old Testament was
[59:36] a perfect type of the
[59:38] news oh Lord may we follow that example
[59:43] we see our Lord what he did and we

[59:58] go when he sounds a trumpet we believe
[1:00:02] it that the bride will go forth at that

[1:00:37] easily beset us that we might run with
[1:00:40] patience the race is set before us Paul
[1:00:42] spoke this our heavenly father over
[1:00:45] there in the book of the Hebrews that we
[1:00:48] should lay aside every weight in that
[1:00:50] 12th chapter that he spoke this after he
[1:00:54] had already showed by example back there
[1:00:57] those who did go on those who did not go
[1:01:00] on those who luk warmly followed those
[1:01:03] who followed up in the front those who
[1:01:06] lered behind all he showed the examples
[1:01:09] then he turned and said let us lay aside
[1:01:11] every way every little teeny thing that
[1:01:15] besets us that we might run with
[1:01:17] patience the race that set before

[1:12:03] our way to keep us from living for that
[1:12:06] keep us looking for that keep that for
[1:12:08] me no matter what the bills are no
[1:12:11] matter what the trials are he's coming
[1:12:13] to catch me away I'm going to leave this
[1:12:16] place one day I I don't have to be
[1:12:18] burdened by it I'm not going to let it
[1:12:21] drag me down he paid for me I'm going
