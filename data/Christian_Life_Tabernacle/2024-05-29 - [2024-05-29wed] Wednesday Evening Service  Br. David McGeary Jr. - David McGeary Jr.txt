strength from day today it will never lose power let's go before gracious Heavenly Father what a purchase price what Calvary has done it's power hour shall never fade it's purchased us lord it's provided an entrance by which we come tonight into your presence Lord to gather at your table to Feast with you Lord and we want to give you all the praise and the glory Lord we don't want to take that price that was paid and counted as no effect Lord but whatever it is that would try to hinder us from entering in it's been a finished work at Calvary lord it's not our worthiness it was the worthiness of the price that was paid father we deem that sacrifice now worthy Lord and we lift you up and glorify you for what you've done Lord and we now just Commit This service to you that it would not be man that speaks father we didn't come here to hear the words of man that will fill but Lord as your children we've gathered to hear from you lord your word is what delivers it sets free father and it's by that you break the bread of life to us and it molds us into the image of what we ought to be Lord so we just now commit each one into your hands that you would anoint the hearer that you'd anoint the speaker Lord the things that you placed upon our heart father that they could Faithfully be delivered that You' allow us to just carry in your word Lord and feast at your table we ask all these things in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen while you're standing if you turn in your Bibles with me to John the 14th chapter we'll read in the we've been made uh possessors of all things we have an inheritance in Christ Jesus and you know if the one thing that would be on my desire that I feel that the Lord's impressed on my heart that we want to understand what our inheritance is and our uh position in Christ assures our possession okay so everything that he accomplished at Calvary we are the inheritors of that and that is all things and this the the This Promise of what Jesus Christ was what was manifested was the very promise that was given to Abraham I this is a proved promise it's the promise that you shall possess the gates of your enemy um so we're going to try to stret just Faithfully lay a foundation read some scriptures and not get too far ahead because I feel that uh you know if you're established in the word of God it's not going to fail so you want to know that by which you're fighting how you're making your claim and I I know with this message it's restoring a faith that this is the unfailing word of God we don't read it as an allegory we don't read it as uh uh you know that is uninspired this inspired but we know that it is Faithfully inspired word of God and we can use it because it is effectual in us because we have faith we take the word of God and uh we can use it as a sword and if you see the word of God not God not being profitable then we want the faith so we have strong Hands of Faith to use the word of God so I as we would just I want to turn over to John 17 and uh verse 8 this is the commission this is Jesus again once again speaking he says as thou sent me into the world even so have I also sent them into the world so we're we're now we we have a commission as Jesus Christ was sent now we're being sent also so we have a reference now we can look back at Jesus Christ and has he was in the world so are we he he didn't take us out of the world but he's but now as he was sent into the world so we are now sent into the world and that's important because Christ is our example if there was a situation that he was faced with and how he responded it's that's how we respond uh that's a very simp that's a very fundamental of Christianity right is Jesus Christ the very Life of Christ if that's dwelling in you then the works that I do you shall do also and all of the works right it's not just Beatitudes but it's it's the power and demonstration of the lord we we're not cutting anything out it's all of it it's the soft answer it's the turning the other cheek it's being silent it's it's laying your life down all of it um Genesis turn with me over to chapter 14: 18- 24 this is the the promise that we have where we're receiving it from um in chapter 14 ver 18 says and mzc king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abraham of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth so right here we're getting in the Book of Genesis this is one of the first places you're going to see where even though we know God this should be simple comprehension that he created All Things by him are all things made but this is now a a a a pronunciation of possession he's the possessor of heavens and earth and blessed be the most high God who hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand and he gave him tithes of all and the king of Sodom said unto Abraham give me the persons and take the goods to thyself and Abra Abraham said to the king of Sodom I have left I have left of my hand unto the Lord and most high God the possessor of heavens and earth that I will not take from a thread even from thy Sho latch and that I will not take anything that is thine lest thou should say I have made Abraham Rich the separation as a that that we see is one that we don't even uh we don't want to say that we've been prospered by the world world or the things of the world you know brother Matthew I was so blessed by it he talked about when you lose your reasoning when you lose your position in Christ you become powerless right we're not holding to this world's or the world's Goods it has not prospered us anything that we have we give God the glory for but the possession we have we're air to all things and that that may not be seen here so that we're our faith is not claiming a possession because we we have uh something tangible that we're saying you know possessions 9/10 of the law um but believe it or not everybody on this earth except the Bride of Jesus Christ is squatters right you own it there's a new heavens and a new Earth it's purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ those things that are not Eternal they're going to pass away and they may claim that they have ownership now but you own it because you're heir to it now you may not possess it just yet but by faith I possess it so don't think that just because uh you you that you're not a possessor of it that you're not aired to it just because something has made a counter claim to it because we're going to as we Lord willing go through this we're going to recognize part of your inheritance as a Seed of Abraham is that you get to kick the devil off of your possession you have the privilege of casting down Satan because your position is in Jesus Christ and he's Lord of all he he's under your foot so by God's grace we want to establish where our position is and if we understand our position there isn't any place in the body of Christ where Satan isn't under your foot amen it it is it's such an an assurance that we can now in faith confront the enemy because he's making a false claim he right now in this building that because of the god wanting to receive glory and be pleased by your faith he's allowed the waser he's allowed an enemy to be able to come and Buffet you and he's made you more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus our part is to cast them down I'm not sure which verse I left off in Reading there but um he he basically says I'm not going to be take anything of the world I'm not going to profit by it I'm not going to even so you can't even say you've you've given me a lace of my shoe the latch of my sandal none of this none none of my possession none of my being none of my substance I'm going to say has come from the world or has been given to me by anything that youve profited me right the favor that we have is of God anything that we have is by the grace of God because we know that if not for the grace of God tomorrow we wouldn't even have a breath to to take right and we on that same basis we know that Satan can't take us before our time right the boldness that we have we we we should be bold our faith is a Burly Faith you know we don't have a problem confronting the enemy and say you can't take me before my time we none of us should be timid about that we don't tempt the Lord thy God we don't cast you know we're not going to go cast ourselves out the height of a of a cliff and say Satan you can't take me before my time but we know by his grace he's ordering our footsteps and as we walk in the will of the Lord and we've placed ourselves in the palm of his hand that Satan cannot harm us we don't want to be outside of that position amen this is uh wonderful book book of Ephesians it's a it's our modern book of of exodus in uh chapter 1 veres 15- 23 if you want to turn with me there wherefore I also after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him we cannot underemphasize the importance of Revelation it is revelation that'll allow us to have a firm understanding of our position in Christ that the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of his glory and his inheritance in the Saints it is something I like the way that's phrased his inheritance in the Saints so we're part of his his Heritage and his inheritance what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the works of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ Jesus when he had raised him up from the dead and set him at the right hand of in Heavenly places far above all principalities and power and might and Dominion in every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come that he hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church let's just say all things all things okay I let we can't enumerate it all but he's put all things underneath the Christ Jesus's feet now that's an authority that Satan's willing to allow you to give he's conqueror he's Lord of all he's been whipped by him he tried to you know when he was went to hell he took the keys to his own house he's willing to admit Jesus I know he's he's willing to admit that okay but what he doesn't want you to realize is that you're in Christ because as soon as you realize you're in Christ he's under your foot he's under your foot your boast isn't even in you I I'm not I I was unworthy I I I I wasn't me I I didn't make a way but I could tell you I could testify to you right now bless God I I if you know what it's like to come into the presence of God and what that victory was there ain't one person here who can't experience the divine presence of Jesus Christ by the victory of calvary oh Hallelujah and now it's not just now I I believe that the the outpouring of the Lord will change you you will not be able to leave the presence the same you will beyond a shadow of a doubt know that he's real he he it will cleanse you it will wash you you will know what what it is to know the love of God but it's not just an outward anointing but it's the promise that he would be with you even in you so when we're talking about how as Christ was in the world you know you just look at how Jesus Christ established his his own Ministry he says it's not I that doeth the works but the father that dwelleth in me amen right we're not making a boast and we're not doing anything that Jesus Christ didn't do we're simply saying it's Christ that liveth in me it's not I that doth the work but he promised that he'd be with me he promised he would be in me as he sent Jesus Christ right so he sent us and he didn't send Jesus Christ to be lower than anything was there anything that Jesus Christ didn't conquer is it anything on you know he was tempted in all man that's the that is we were fellowshipping I I was in the uh I couldn't get out of my driveway yesterday it about five different people ended up one after another was almost comical um kept coming by and we just Fellowship probably just one after the other but the thing that I always find that I'm trying to witness to people is is you know we understand the tress of the godhead we understand that Jesus Christ was God we don't have a trinitarian thinking and one of the the main things that caused the whole trinitarian Doctrine to be established is they were confounded with the humanity of Jesus Christ it's a the deity of Jesus Christ and God being dwelling in flesh that could be no Beauty and that we would desire him that he could sleep that he could hunger that uh that but here is a man and I do believe that when they went to wake Jesus Christ up in the boat they were going to ask him to Bell water okay they were do do not care that we're dying can you please put some skin in the game grab a rope grab a bucket you know we're tending for our lives here get with the program man right and and that was a fair assessment okay like help me out please that's right and they're asking him to help I I I think in a you know in a kind way maybe do you not care we're about to die so but then when he stands and he says peace be still they say what manner of man we we got the man part down but what manner of man is this that even that the winds and the Sea obey and I I'll tell you what manner of man is this as the sons of God that we could that it's let there be a squirrel and there's a squirrel that says storm go back to where you were and we're standing now as sons of God where we can speak the rain on the brother's crop we as sons of Abraham say Satan give it back no more there's got to come a point of of anger right there you know it it says the scripture actually says to be anger without I believe wrath you know it doesn't say don't be angry you know but there can be a righteous anger Satan that's enough that's enough you know you go back through the Old Testament you know hey you're about to take my crop for the last time and he takes a an ox gourd and just start slaying people see and it was it was a now how could he do that there was a promise that was given to Abraham that said that was his land okay so now I hope by the scriptures we've read we've got all things heavens and earth all right so the things that are even to come the things that we don't even see I don't care if it's some a uh demon out there in a spiritual realm you can't see him he's defeated okay there's principalities there's evil there's there's things that wickedness that work in high places and I don't care how big it is and and think about this I love the song our brother Ryan Hayes wrote you know it it doesn't matter how big it it is the grace of God is greater it's always greater and anytime time the devil starts lifting something up you can just start getting excited because it's like I don't care how big you make it God's greater so as soon as he did his great job telling you how great your sin was he just magnified the price paid at Calvary what a price thank you Lord now the Poss possession is is an interesting thing you know we would say that uh your position is your it it demonstrates uh what you're in possession of right if you're talking about lands you know we're talk if you're thinking of just this come to me the the war in Ukraine um you would say that depending on where the Russian army is in Ukraine you would say they're in the possession of that land right that now Ukraine would say you may be in possession of that land but you don't have claim to it um that's my sovereign land and you don't belong here and so they're fighting a natural land for something that while the enemy is in possession of it they're saying you don't have a right to it and we're going to we're going to take it back right so when you understand that the importance of position but it's not everything that's that is uh something CU we possess things in a truthful position in Christ Jesus that's the only Eternal position is in a perfect word but what the false claim is from the enemy is is he will try to take possession of something that is not his and that is where the fight is at and what are you fighting for possession okay and it's because he's taken a position that he needs to be driven out from okay so as you you see this the children of Israel coming out of Egypt they have the Holy go you know it's a holy ghost that they cross over Jordan and now they're going to take possession of the land they had to fight for every inch of it and that's the you know the thing that seems to be is uh we want to just some for some reason just say I've got it there's no fight well I'm I'm secure in my eternal salvation okay but I also want to put the devil under my foot and if I've got complete victory in my life I want that cup to start overflowing you know it I'm not content was seeing the devil take up positions in my brothers and sisters life when I could see the influence of them in their life that he's destroying them that that he's doing things and they don't belong to him so we have a way of warfare that we're going to go and fight the enemy and it's not by power not by might but by my spirit sayith the Lord we want to know that we have an effectual part that we play in prayer in the word of God where we create atmospheres where things change I uh think of this I kind of joke with my brother Matthew he was in the world and uh I would go into his room was that's right and he would be out and the God had gotten a hold of my life and I would get in his room and I would pray through on his bed I would just get in there and I'd let the presence of God come down I would walk out it was milky white I was like boy when he walks in that room he ain't going to know what hit him you know what I mean now I was believing he wasn't serving the lord then there's some rough that was at the old house at 916 McCurry he was wasn't serving the lord when we moved into for the 1 15404 Shirley way so just from that reference you know I there may have been a tering there may have been a time but look what the Lord's using him for now right so we there is a weapon of warfare and it is effectual and we can testify to the grace of God in our lives let's just read a little bit from our Prophet this is the deed of Jesus Christ this is back in 49 he says but that is the the god the Creator living in you and giving you all the power and your impos possession of anything that he had so it is in you to abstain from Evil to do good to shun evil to flee to righteousness to turn away from temptation all malice hatred Strife envy and so forth turn away from it and for that take him for from your heart if you will receive him Embrace him and love him and hold him in your heart and love him I can tell you the church together in that kind of power has the power to bind the heavens kill the sick Open the Eyes of the blind Hallelujah the deaf speak the dumb speak the deaf hear the walk and the blind see why it's recognizing the power of God into your heart that there he is the deity you know that seems to be a buzzword you know people don't want to accept deity well if if you can't accept that Jesus Christ was deity then you'll never accept deity in you because he's in you and if Jesus Christ is in you deity and it's but the devil doesn't want you to recognize that now there's a difference in that we understand that the blood vessel of Jesus Christ was deity that was a created blood vessel that was God but you got to understand what the new birth is I mean don't negate the the new birth to something else other than the life of Jesus Christ and deity because that is De if you if you don't understand that that's God in you and that's deity you're not putting the devil under your foot and and that's what the devil wants to do is negate your experience and tell you that it's that the authority that you have in Jesus Christ you know that this uh the scripture when it talks about a son differeth nothing from a servant that that son has Authority you understand he has Authority as a son not even being fully placed he's a son he's differing nothing from a servant but he's still a son so that's why you can have sometimes uh things that seem confusing but you know we want to mature and be fully properly placed and be robed in his righteousness and be proper sons of God because a sinner that is you know when you're in the world you're a son you just haven't recognized your position and what you're heir to okay so anybody here here who is a sinner that's Desiring there's something in you that's saying I don't want to be this way I don't want to be a sinner that's because you're a Son of God and what the devil doesn't want you to know is what the authority of a son is and what you're air to he's under your foot and so when the water's troubled when the Lord's moving you want to press in and ask for a revelation of what it means to be a Son of God you know you want to be born again you want to be filled with the Holy Ghost you want to recognize that the devil's under your foot and that that's an experience that's a revelation but you know what I want more Revelation I want a revelation of a body change right I want a revelation upon Revelation I want revelation and I want revelation through eternity it's going to take Eternity for him to unfold himself to me and I'm and I want more wherever we're at we're going to want more it's going to otherwi there won't be an eternity it were it's going to go on forever just fellowshipping with you let's uh believe we just read in Ephesians uh5 let's turn to Ephesians chapter 2 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins where in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom we also had our conversations in time past and the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others but God who is rich in Mercy for the great loveed wherewith he hath loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ amen by Grace ye are saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen we're in Christ our position is in Christ Christ the devil can't get to you in Christ if you're in Christ where's Satan he's under your foot this seems rather academic but we're here to tell Satan you can't have it you can't have my joy you can't have my peace you can't have my family everything that I'm air to in Jesus Christ that he's been that's promised to me by this word is mine all things even the things I can't understand with my mind that and it's not up to me to comprehend with my mind I cannot comprehend the heavens but I'm a possessor of all things the the grace that has been given to us all our part is to believe that that is the Simplicity of Our Gospel is it as many as that he gave power to become the sons of God who believed on him our gospel hasn't changed now we believe that the power of Jesus Christ separates us from sin we don't have a powerless confession we don't we're not in the world partaking in the things of the world and then claim that we're his right because a true profession causes a separation there's a there's a a life that causes a difference that you yourself now know it's no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me and that virtue that comes out of a believer in his life has that's a communion with him when you see I didn't even know that I could respond that way but that's exactly what the word says to do thank you Lord for keeping me in that situation thank you for protecting me and you you you drink up and you push out you you you you take in the word of God he quickens it to you and it's they abiding in your heart and you don't even know when the point of time it's going to come out but because you've been reading your Bible because you've been praying because you've been meditating upon the things of God because it's in your thinking to be quickened what what happens you're faced with the situation and Christ is put on display and you can go I into a communion with him a Thanksgiving and a fellowship with him around the things that he's done in your life amen so as Jesus said this is in Christ is the mystery of God revealed paragraph 455 and as the father has sent me so I send you Jesus said now watch the father that sent him went to him to vindicate him right for he was the word and the same Jesus that sends you goes with you and in you to vindicate the same God as the father has sent me and I live by the father so I'll send you and you live by me me what is he he's the word you live by the word oh how I'd like to take a text on that and preach now for about a couple of hours on it see on that how he was notice the father that sent me went with him the father that sends Jesus that sends us goes in a little while and the world sees me no more but ye shall see me personal pronoun I the person Jesus will be with you even in you to the end of the World The Works that I do ye shall do also now go back and see what he's done and then see what you do then compare yourself right so he he was our perfect example and he conquered death hell sin and the grave he was tempted in all manner as we were and he overcame and it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the son of man and as the days of lot when a modern Billy Graham or Robert went down into Sodom and preached to them sodomites and blinded their eyes see with the gospel one Angel stayed back a messenger with Abraham and the elected group and that kind of sign did he do and what did Abraham call him Elohim God manifested in flesh Jesus showing that he himself God in him will be manifested in his bride in the last days you know we fellowshipped on what was the image that that Abraham or that Adam was made in it was Spirit it was Eve was in Adam there's an immutability of the Bride of Jesus Christ and it they're saying the same thing you go to 22:17 Revelations the spirit and the bride say come there's not a separation of Jesus Christ and his bride they're they're they're one that's been declared all throughout the Bible that a man and wife they come together they cleave to one Eve was in Adam spiritual being he took Eve out but what was it when Adam looked this is bone of my bone flesh is Flesh of My Flesh Christ at Calvary when his sight is pierced you have water blood spirit the same same natural order of the birth talking about speaking to a bride being taken from the the side of Christ we are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh we are the Bride of Jesus Christ which means he's present here confirming his word to be the same all we have to do is take the word of God and chop the Satan's head off with it you've been given a position of authority and imagine you talk about taking possession the the scripture talks about as a bridegroom coming forth from his chamber he's you now if you can catch the image of that I in my mind I I've seen you know you you see these very majest have you ever seen a you know probably it's probably a two-ton Bowl you know them Spanish bowls they're just they're just all muscle and and they blow in their nostrils just go you know and I I've seen these elk out in the woods and they're just they're just all bowed up and they're like okay the bridegroom our Heavenly bridegroom coming forth from his chamber that's right to take a bride you know do you imagine anybody's like there not that there's even an invitation but speak now forever hold your peace the devil doesn't want to get in between that man our Lord Jesus Christ and his bride because if he does he's going to get plowed over and that you have a bridegroom coming forth from his chamber and our minds haven't seen Gusto but this is someone who's intent on taking a possession and there is nothing that's going to stop him from taking that possession okay God let that anointing get on us we've got to recognize there's a possession for us to take as the as God's representation here on Earth as his bride just as he's doing something he's reflecting that in his bride we're not meant to be content letting Satan squat on our land we can't be it it's a it's not pleasing and it's a false claim and he needs to be kicked out and you know when you when you recognize your I I love the the just the ministry lately and and how you have a discovery when someone recognizes that they own something or what the value is or what the possession is and that's really what happened in this day right the ministry that we've received is one that's declared us to be the Spotless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ and it's placed Us positionally by the opening of the seals we recognize who we are that's right so it's it's it's not a um it's not a work that we we've done ourselves but we're resting in something that has been delivered to us just like the promise was given to Abraham his part was to believe it and then the Simplicity to walk into it and then there was a time where his faith was tried and let's just um you know let's I don't think I ever got there let's turn to uh Genesis chap 22 verse 17 um we'll read a little before it and just understand uh what what had transpired for Abraham to receive the blessing is when he's going to offer up his son I having received the promise knowing that he'd received him one from the dead and God was able but this is the uh I I'll back up to verse 14 and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Gyra as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out Out of Heaven a second time and said by myself have I sworn sayith the Lord for because thou Hast done this thing and Hast not withheld thy son thy only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies we are called to possess the Gate of our enemy and we have a our Heir is this promise we are the Seed of Abraham we are the faith we have been made partakers of the faith of Abraham because we've received the promise we had a a promise come to us in this day and being mixed with faith in those that heard it we are just we've had an angel come to us and make a covenant and we've we just happened to believe it there's an end time bride Hallelujah she's she's robed in his righteousness you mean I never did it in the first place astounding claims there David you uh you look mighty human to me but there's a faith that's starting to cast down yes sir amen and say you know what the love of God is greater and I know the love that which he loved me I can understand what it means to be his bride I'm starting to understand what it means and it and and I'm not and because I understand what it means to be his bride I don't want Satan to to claim what that he's got a a shoe latch on my foot I don't want any stigma of the world I don't want to be Satan's poser you know we is that that a term anybody even uses anymore you know we were we were uh probably want to be skateboarders ourself and we had this term that we used on anybody that was trying to write a skateboard and couldn't skate we called him a poser it was just a term we used well you ain't really a skater you're just a poser right and you're you're not the real thing you're just a poser well anytime you allow the smut of the world to come on you Satan's making an accusation he's like yeah they're really not a Believer they're just a poser but when you start to understand the love wherewith he loved you you start to say you know what Satan I ain't going to do that because I don't want you to even try to say I'm going to avoid the very appearance of evil I'm not in bondage to you I don't have to do that you're under my foot you know I I'm not subject to that and that's the thing that Satan just wants to think that you have to sin right he just he just wants you to think you have to but when you recognize that your life is hid in Christ it's no longer you that lives but Christ that lives in you and that he through you can do the Greater Works that's just dirt it the things that you once took pleas pleasure and are dung there is a new birth experience where all those things just become equated to you recognize them for the fodder that they are you realize that the end of those things is death and you've tasted of eternal life and it's the greatest thing that you could ever partake in and you don't want anything but that to Reign and have supreme authority in your life and that experience is to be had you know it is an inexhaustible Fountain and uh I uh I trust that each person here has experienced the the the presence of the Lord and I will say this to whatever degree you've experienced the presence of the Lord there's a greater degree to experience it and I say that for myself Lord I want more I I want to I want to I want to you know the uh the things that are on my heart were kind of fellowshipping out of the the the sermon that uh possessing all things and we had uh just kind of found the sermon almost a little before we re the service not realiz realizing that some of the very things are on our heart we in here and we just want to take our time we have a little time I believe we can Fellowship on this this is um possessing all things I believe it's in 62 and this is in paragraph uh 58 says in other words if I'd apply it today I'd say the church could sayl here's my brother he's laying here stricken with cancer he's stricken with tuberculosis he's got soand so I lay hold of the promise it's my possession you've told me so amen there you are then you can go after the enemy the devil and Slaughter it just the same as Abraham slaughtered the Kings and brought back his possession amen I like that it's to the believer yet Abraham had a right to the promise and the promise was his yet he had to fight to possess it amen there you are the very believer today yet we're air to all things and we're air to every spiritual blessing every physical blessing every blessing in the Bible promise yet you have to fight every inch of it that's the way God's got it set up it's the way it's all always been that way and you have to fight to possess what you know is your own so the very first thing and what I've tried to establish is it's yours by God's promises by his words by his word it's yours there's nothing that you haven't been given Made air to and now you fight and there's and you have to now now you make just imagine there's different maybe ways that we fight you know I could understand that you know our worst enemies ourselves and there's a holding and in our own uh beings and subjection and and knowing how to possess our own beings and there that's that could be a fight of Mastery where you hold your but but there's also the understanding that there's an adversary and there's an enemy and there there's a devil that there's to to be withstood and he's to be fought and it how do we fight him is it a gun show you know it it we know that we don't I it's not we're going to not Flex our spirituality we're not going to go to the devil and be like you know it's been three weeks since I've last sinned and you have no right to me I it sounds funny but he wants us to approach and based off our worthiness he he doesn't want us to use the true weapon of our word Warfare which is the word of God and when you take this message this is the word of God and and there this is the authoritative thus sayith the Lord word of God that puts Satan in his place and declares him defeated and it put it on display there was nothing that would come up before our Prophet that he could not cast out and cast down that's right and and and he would even and he would go at Great Lengths to try to teach people that hey that Devil's not going to stay here he's got to go now your faith you're going to have to believe when he comes back around but standing on the authority of being a Son of God he taught us what that means the devil doesn't have a right he doesn't have a place he can't even stay there and he even said hey man sometimes I probably got in trouble for telling the devil to go when God was using that for a purpose but that's because the authority of a son is absolute and when we recognize the authority we have as Sons I mean the devil gets scared so the he doesn't want you to recognize the authority you have as a son and the position you have in Christ because you're going after what belongs to you and when you recognize the power of possession that it belongs to you and that becomes a you start to let it marinate a little bit you know you you ever kids are amazing mine mine we don't even act like children sometimes when it comes to the things of God we don't even want to sit there and go mine well unless she comes with babes I mean maybe you need to get a little bit of mine in there and be like wait a second that's mine that's mine that's mine and that's maybe all you can do is just say mine mine mine you know eventually it'll work I mean you ever seen a parent that's just give it to him just give it to him doesn't matter what the right thing to do is doesn't matter if it's theirs or not give it to them because I need peace there's a little bit of wisdom in that the unjust judge right but you know this is uh you know the Lord reflects himself in amazing ways but we do we want to have a little bit of a m in there there has to be a little there should be an edge to the believer I'm not giving place to the devil amen and I'm not going to glorify his claim and and not only do I not want to lift the devil up and give him any power that he does not have that's not doe him any Authority any honor I'm not going to give him anything that that's his desire is to be lifted up above the sons of God and I get it you do a really good job but you're not going to have place in my life but more than all more than my desire to not lift you up I don't want to dis discredit the price of Calvary and the completed work that Jesus Christ did I'm not going to discredit the victory that was one I'm not going to discredit the power of the Resurrection I'm not going to discredit that death hell and the grave have been defeated in Jesus Christ that's my boast as Christians what are we declaring the Resurrection Life how do you know he's alive he's living in me and and how do I know that that I'm not entangled in the things of the world Amen this is a paragraph 83 in the same service he says oh my how I like that Believers promise you say what's that got to do with us to every believer the believer's promise is eternal life the believer's promise is life joy peace longsuffering gentleness patience fruits of the spirit Divine Healing a dozen things I got wrote down here nearly that is in your possession it belongs to you but you cannot have it until you fight for it it's yours and everything that seen every temporal thing that's seen belongs to me God give it to me because through Christ he gave it to me so our boast Christ has done it all the thing all and things unseen belongs to me amen I like that what you can see like Divine Healing so forth like that that's good we appreciate that but the Unseen and I like this now science can probe around here and say well let's see let's take the this man you said he was healed let me take him down and examine him let's see me see what happened and you say you had a tumor once sir yes right there well let me give a scientific research and see if that just didn't sink in and didn't go away I I I really appreciate that cuz science will come up with an explanation when God supernaturally delivered the now science is not saying it was a work of God they're going to testify by what they could see and you say you were once blind and now you see how I do how do I know that let me scientifically look and see it now they could Pro around on that and yet I'm air to that too amen everything physical and when I'm not air to the things that it can't seen where science can't probe amen unseen things amen I'm air to that yes sir the things that can be seen I'm air to that the actual Earth I'm Heir you're an heir every believer is an heir he's an heir to it all right then the things unseen possessor of what heavens and earth amen all things you believe believe that amen all things now uh just the page before I I recommend you go back and read this service listen to it but uh you know I I just looking at it here on the page he talks about dancing in the spirit and he says and brother Bram talks about uh well I'll just read it You' seen one time I used to think about dancing in the spirit see somebody standing dance in the spirit now I've seen the mockery put on it but I've seen the real thing too amen so I come to find out why could people dance in the spirit well I never seen one yet get out of the way I never seen one act immorally I always see it just as decently in order and sweetness and even Sinners run to the Altar and get saved when it's going on well I wonder why it was and I come to find out it's victory David danced before the Lord when the ark was brought back to its resting place and I could go on but I'm going to tell you something hey how many sister people know Sister L well you know I I've been around a little bit I used to go over to Louisiana and stay with Brother David buts when he was a bachelor I remember Sister L play playing the flute on the platform and at brother Tim's old church out there in the woods and you know her testimony of a sister she's just one of the you know I she a very softspoken you know even when I got around my wife's family kind of reminded me of when I first met her you know it you kind of we talk us Irish a little loud and run into some people are softspoken and you you realize you got to kind of adjust your ears and listen a little bit and I don't mean to I'm talking about Julia's family but uh sister Lana is just very humble sister very sweet and I would say just the nature of Christ and that's not someone you would expect to go dancing around the church you know I might have some little Irish Groove and think I've got something and go jump around um and I could maybe do something after my nature or after but when the spirit of God moves and there's true Victory there's a real Victory and there's a real dance and it isn't carnal and I I get moved when I think about that there should be victory in the camp not put on but there's nothing wrong with it when the Lord gives a victory and we shouldn't mock it there's mockery but there's a real thing and uh that's a testimony I I just moved by that I hope she doesn't mind but I know that what the Lord did was heal her of cancer and when the re Revelation struck they have a you know they they got that X-ray and it's got cancer eating up her body and now without any evidence the victory strikes and she recognizes she's healed and she just it happens she's running around the church Victory and I pray that there's victory in the camp amen and if the Lord Le you know if he leads you to dance that's wonderful but it's something to be understood our Prophet marveled at it right but he understood what it meant this is a we'll try to finish it up here paragraph 97 same sermon and you an heir to to bradam tapel no I'm an heir to All Things both seen present future to everything I'm an heir to it and every sin and wickedness has been put under my feet by the grace of Jesus Christ he rose on Easter morning triumphed over death hell in the grave and made me an heir and said wait Yonder and I'll give you the promise and his anointed authoritative servant said the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are a far off even as many as our Lord Our God shall call I'm an heir amen let's just have the musicians come we're an heir to All Things Saints and as air we have to take possession you know even one day is you know the Lord terries as we take a body change that's going to be something that we're taking a possession of I'm now air to it he's promised me a new body though this Tabernacle but though this be dissolved he's got one waiting for me we understand that that is a promise and I'm aired to it but you know that we've got to take possession of it there's a fighting there's a contending and the Victory is all his it's a victory that he's one maybe we could uh play that song uh he of Salvation purchase of God born of his Spirit washed in his blood this is I think maybe that's this is my story but that's an ultimate Victory one day we're going to step out we're going to take a new body and we've got a foretaste of that now it's beating in my heart I I I've received an Earnest that I'm not going to always have to deal with this this flesh the the Life In Me Is So real saints and it moves and it has its being and the communion it has in the word is so real but there's things now that we've been given to take possession of that's in the realm of the scene some of its sickness some of it's just habits you know me I I I feel convicted about I it may sound trivial but I you know my my yard's a wreck my shed's dirty and I've got to there's going to be an act of taking possession of that and saying I'm not content with this stain this way this is not a representation as a Christian that I want to have and there's going to be an act yes of throwing the junk out of cleaning the shed out and I'm going to have to take these hands and these feet and I'm going to have to possess my body and my being in 1 Thessalonians 4:4 and you could read before and after but it says that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor Lord let us possess these vessels with the Authority that's been given to us as sons of God you gave a Adam dominion over the air and you've given me dominion over this flesh you've been you've given me dominion over my home you've given me dominion and I'm and I know it might be a fight I know that it's going to take a little bit of effort but I'm not going to allow other atmospheres to rule in my home it might be a fight may be not a comp physical confrontation it's not who has the loudest voice but I'm going to start setting an atmosphere you might just walk in the home and I'm going to be on my knees praying when you walk in the front door I'm just going to have having to have a sermon plan you're you know we're going to have to limit the screen time you're not going to play that movie and you know no this is a place that I have [Music] dominion this is my atmosphere that my Lord pleased to dwell in and I'm not compromising it there is nothing we have to give to the devil right I don't even care if you got in someone else's car you have the authority over that atmosphere there is no place that you as a son and daughter of God don't have dominion none we can go through testimony after testimony of God coming on the scene I don't care if it's a lion's den the Lions didn't have the ultimate Authority on the atmosphere it was the son of God you could be at school you could be in University recognize the authority that you [Music] have your Messiahs the word of God in your hands in your mouth is more powerful than you even realize let's just stand [Music] together just go to him in [Music] prayer and as you're thinking of things I hope that the Lord's quickened to you that there's a there's an intent now I'm going to go take possession of what's mine as a Son of God by The Authority as a Son of God and by the his promised word I'm taking his prom promises and I'm taking possession let's go before him gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for the word that you've given us Lord your promises are true Lord and I felt in my heart that you wanted me to just Minister that you've given us great and exceeding promises and you want us to fight for them Lord Lord you want us to fight and believe that all things are possible Lord we don't have a passive Faith Lord but our our faith is active lord it's taking action to declare what we believe is to be that it is true and Lord we ask that you would just grant Revelation father that your spirit could Quicken to each one Lord that you're The Keeper of the Covenant you swore by yourself because you could swear by no greater that your word cannot fail Lord and when we stand on that word without any evidence it pleases is you you said that without faith it's impossible to please God so Lord we'll thank you that we could have the opportunity to stand in a position to please you Lord that we're not resting in anything else besides what you said and that you said so Lord for Faith truly is the evidence of those things that are not seen father and it calls those things which are seen as though they are not Lord move and have your perfect way we pray precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen just sing that together blessed [Music] assur oh Jesus is m

Satan wants that he wants you to start compromising you know after you fought and you start avoiding punches and new things and no we are the army of the Living God you know what I mean we we don't need to let any ground go we need to possess every ground you know I thought you know if Caleb was here what he what would he tell us you know what would he tell to us and just tell us what what what are you guys doing and you know you guys are not close to my age and you're giving up already and and you look tired and you look exhausted no the word of God is supposed to make us look younger and

I'll just continue to pray until no I'm going to fight I'm going to take over I'm going to take what belongs to me and and I'll say this you know I've always thought about this message you think about that we we forget he's given us all things but the reason he wants us to fight for it is because he wants us to have the fellowship with him so we can taste what it means to win a victory so this is not just something that's given on the platter where you come and and because if you get it that way you'll be scared to lose it now what is said he said okay come on up I I have fought and I've already won I just want you to come on with me now and I will be with you I would win inside of you and yet we all compromising here and let it this go and let it that go you know it's like the devil
