did you say hey the family does anybody know isaac man coming up dude hey i'm pulling your family i love being a part of a family we we the only way we're gonna make it is as a family so you might as well get to know your brothers and sisters because we're gonna be spending a long time with them i don't even know what we're singing but praise god that's the name of the song sir are we about to sing a song i don't know we got it you gotta do something you know we'll start singing it let's go let's go all right praise the lord there's a land that is [Music] by we shall be [Applause] for sure

just the first five minutes hallelujah hallelujah we're gonna lose our minds [Applause] hallelujah praise god amen brother trevor we're gonna invite brother trevor this time the coming sing for us amen well my wife um said she really felt it on her heart to tell her tell a little testimony so i've learned you know if you get a godly wife and the holy spirit speaks to her well just lean on that sometimes so i'm gonna let her like my kids they didn't have a chance because you know they're a lot like me and so i knew what they were up to usually and if i didn't know what they were up to the holy spirit spoke to their mama and they just didn't ever have a chance so anyway go ahead sweetie so yeah this is way out of my comfort zone so bear with me but so um maybe this is for a sister i have no idea i really don't but i've learned to yield when god says do something so i was raised in a christian home i was raised in a message home both my parents came in well before i was born so that's all i knew i got saved when i was young i was baptized at eight but it was always this is what i was taught i do this because it's what my parents said never was mine until later when i was in my late teens about 19 i went to some youth meetings with some friends um they all went looking for boyfriends i was like well i need the holy ghost before i get a boyfriend so i'm going looking forward to sorry so anyway so i went with with the purpose of getting the holy ghost and i was determined not to leave until i got it and god gave it to me later that same year i got my boyfriend too so [Music] glory so i guess my point in this is sisters just get the holy ghost god will send you the right man and you know almost 21 years later i have no regrets so god will send him to you just get the holy ghost first well my daughter told me that this is our theme song she's like well we gotta sing our thing sing our theme song i'm like what's our theme song and she said well it's it's this song how can it be and i think i'll read a quote from the church age book um i don't know somewhere in there around the bridge area and we just we just thank god that we've been justified you know as though you've never done it and the song says how can it be because if we think about it what god has done for us it shouldn't have happened but by his grace by his amazing love to us foreign [Music] i am guilty ashamed of what i've done what i've become these hands were dirty i'd dare not lift them up to the holy one [Music] you plead my course you ride my rose break my chains you overcome you gave your life to give me mine you say that i am free how can it be how can it be i've been hiding afraid i've let you down inside i doubt then you still love me but in your eyes there's only grace now [Music] you break my trees you overcome you gave your life to give me mine you say that i am free how can it be [Applause] how can it be [Applause] now consider this since it is the blood of god it is perfect blood and if the perfect blood is loosing us from the power and bondage and defilement of sin then the losing is perfect and complete there is now therefore no condemnation who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justify it who is he that condemneth it is christ that died there it is his death gave us the blood the blood has loosed us there is now no condemnation how can there be you can make me new from his death i will rise with you oh the grace reaching how can it be how can it bring [Music] you break my chains [Music] [Applause] how can it be how can it be [Applause] i was guilty ashamed of what i'd done what i'd become these hands were dirty but now i lift them up to the holy one [Applause] i was told to do two or three so when a brother invites you down and then he tells you to do two or three you know what you do you do two or three how many are uh how are you just having a good time in the lord tonight amen he's worth all of our praise and all of our glory i've been enjoying the singing and one day when heaven was filled with his praises one day when sin was as black as could be jesus came forth to be born of a virgin dwelt among men my example is he the word became flesh and the light shined among us his glory revealed living he loved me dying he saved me buried [Music] one day he's coming a glorious day from glorious days one day they led him up calvary's mountain one day they nailed him to die on a tree suffering anguish [Music] stretched out on a [Music] my one day he's coming on glorious day [Music] one day the grave could conceal him no longer one day the stone rolled away from the door then he arrows over death he had conquered now he's offended my lord evermore [Music] [Applause] rising [Music] [Applause] glorious day [Music] one day the trumpet will sound for his coming one day the skies with his glories will shine a wonderful day my beloved one ringing [Music] glorious day o glorious day glorious day [Music] [Applause] okay so i i started singing this um song and it's just been a blessing to quite a few people particularly in the times of that thing which must not be named among us for the last 14 months um you know but people just you know they had a hard time and um and so this song you know i told our church i said you know it's good that we have these things sometimes because sometimes life just gets so easy and sometimes life just gets so good and it can tempt us to just get complacent maybe just feel like hey it's all right if god didn't come for another 10 years that's all right because you know stock market's been performing at about 12 percent every year for the last little while and the 401k looks all right the house is comfortable and things is going well but sometimes these things happen and we are reminded that this isn't our home sometimes that's good but sometimes things gets overwhelming and we just need to also a reminder that this isn't our home but there's one that we're going to and it's coming soon and so well we're almost home tonight i believe that with all my heart you disappointed are you desperate for hell you know what it's like to be tired and only a shell of yourself you start to believe you don't have what it takes and it's all you can do just to move much less finish the ring but don't forget what lies ahead almost home brother it won't be long soon all your burdens will be gone with all your strength sister run on your free hold up your head keep pressing on we are almost home this road will be hard [Music] we win in the end so take joy in the journey even when it feels long oh find strength in each step knowing heaven is cheering you on we are almost home brother it won't be long soon all your burdens will be gone with all your strength sister run on your free hold up your head he press [Music] almost home almost [Music] i know that the cross has brought heaven to us but make no mistake there's still more to come when our flesh and our bone are no longer between where we are right now and where we're meant to be when all that's been lost is made whole again when these tears and this pain no longer exists no more walking we're running as fast as we can consider this our second way no it won't be [Music] gone with all your strength sister run on your free hold up your head keep pressing [Music] almost home we are almost home so i just want to say god bless you it's been wonderful to be here in these meetings and to be a part of it and thank brother david of course and

between us how high the mountain i could not climb in desperation i turn to heaven and spoke your name into the night then through the darkness your loving kindness door through the shadows of my soul the work is finished the end is written jesus christ my living hope who could imagine so great mercy what heart could fathom such boundless grace the god of ages stepped down [Music] the cross has

promise your buried body began to breathe set me hallelujah hallelujah [Music] jesus christ o jesus christ [Applause] amen amen amen you know satan just got his ears stomped up stop i can't i can't take it no more i can't wait till these people leave amen well satan i want to leave and guess what i know how to leave i do follow the word of god for the hour right it'll make us ready to leave and we've got everything we need to leave amen and we're just going to feast on it and feast on it till we get so spiritually that we just float right out here hey man you know i you know i've been kidding john all week because he's trying to put me in the grave all week but he don't know there ain't no grave that could hold this body down you know and so that's okay but i'm going to win one way or the other because the dead in christ shall rise first [Applause] so uh i'll tell them you're coming amen man and if he comes before you go i'll go with you okay man i'm looking for i'm looking forward to go with it do you realize what a wonderful time we had this evening i mean people somewhere are totally confused because they've heard english they've heard spanish they've heard french they've heard zim that's why he i don't know all the stuff they heard you know what i mean people sing and and and rejoicing and everything but you know jesus made one of the greatest statements that always stuck with me he said it's freely been given freely gift and he said if you've ever tasted of the good things of god you're obligated to share it with somebody else and and you know i know it's always hard for uh you know students and people that go to school because we have a lot of friends that love the lord and they do love the lord and they try to serve god the best way they can and we're not saying that there's not a place for them but this is a rapturing message this is more than a salvation message this is a message that's given to a people that are going to be taken up before judgment and and so it's it's so special and to think that god's blessed you enough to let you hear a message that's going to save you from the wrath and it's not god's wrath it's the wrath that the world's pouring out upon themselves they can't sustain the madness that they're going about they're losing their minds they're trying to make everything fit they're destroying the earth but you know we have one that looked down from heaven and put our name on a book before there ever was a star in the sky and he said before it gets that to that place i will not suffer my bride to go through that trouble and so the privilege that you have and i don't think there's any greater joy i've i've seen miracles i could go for hours seeing the things that i've seen the lord jesus do the miracles the the healings but there's been nothing that thrills my soul more than to see somebody cross the river of death from death to life and and go from sure destruction to eternal life and glory and there's nothing that will ever give you joy like sharing this message with somebody and having them receive it and so our whole weekend has been about making sure that we have the holy spirit that we have the spirit of the lord and we know the spirit of the lord is love for god is love god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son he so loved you that he gave you his son and if that spirit that was in jesus christ dwells in you we know that he'll quicken your mortal body bring your bodies under subjection and aren't you thankful for that that you don't have to do it i i would i still struggle to die daily and i struggle to bring this body under subjection and to turn away the lies of the enemy that's a daily struggle but i am so glad that i have somebody that has me in the palm of his hands and that nothing can pluck me out and i think this weekend we've decided that we're going to go with them all the way we're going to pay the price we're not going to recant we're going to stand true our testimonies are going to shine we're going to trim our lamps but it doesn't do us any good if we can't find that last one he's out there somewhere he's out there somewhere now i think he's in dallas fort worth or she's in dallas fort worth and i think we ought to go find them we ought to go on the highways the byways we got to go over we're not ashamed [Music] we tell everybody that we know we pass out books we give out tapes we sit down we talk with them we open the bible with them at school if you know somebody's suffering you pray with them amen and somebody's going to know that jesus christ is alive that he's the same yesterday today and forever and his last manifestation on this earth is in his bride she's the last one that can bring the true lord jesus to this world think of how important you are thinking of what it is that you possess so quit listening to him because i'm sure he quit listening to you tonight satan went to try to find the loudest honky tonk he could to get away from what was going on here tonight but you want to know something we're going to chase him we're going to make melody in our heart we're in the grocery store we're going to sing when we're on the job we're going to whistle but we're going to testify and we're going to let our light shine and we're going to hold our candle up and so the lord can know where we're at and across this dark world they'll be burning lights amen of the oil that's in the lamp shining out in every true believer you know satan tried to break us up he tried to separate us but the love of god keeps drawing us closer and closer and closer and he becomes more real to us and more real go make him real go make them real in the world that you live in nobody can take your place i'd like to talk to everybody in dallas fort worth but i can't do it but we all can do it and i just pray that this weekend that you heard the call to join the army to join the commission to be part of those that go into all the world and preach the gospel it's not given to preachers it's given to everyone that's ever touched the hem of his garment they have something to share they got something to testify about something to tell the world about tell them about your jesus they want to hear they're starving to hear they're hungry to hear they don't even know there's such joy of this exists you ever had one of those guys pull up next to you in one of those cars that's got those things boom boom boom and the windows are shaking you know and you know you look over there and you really know what he's trying to do he's trying to blow up his life's so miserable that that he's trying to get out you know y'all just bow your head and say lord god don't say send a policeman i i love our policeman i want you to know that but have him send an angel his way to let him know that there's something greater than all these things if you love me keep my commandment what was this commandment going to all the world
