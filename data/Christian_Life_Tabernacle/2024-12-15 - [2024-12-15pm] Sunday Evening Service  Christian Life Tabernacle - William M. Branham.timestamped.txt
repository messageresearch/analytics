[18:24] we want to listen to uh it's it's about
[18:28] 46 6 minutes long it was preached in
[18:32] January 9th 1958 in Chicago it's called
[18:36] the called out and and it's just a
[18:42] good uh
[18:44] reminder that we should never forget our
[18:48] ABCs we should never forget really that
[18:53] we are called out and uh I think that's
[18:57] uh
[18:59] that's a blessing to be called out so we
[19:02] haven't been called to conform but we've
[19:04] been called to become
[19:06] separate and the the
[19:09] gospel hasn't changed and and the man
[19:14] has changed the gospel but the gospel
[19:17] hasn't changed it's still the same word
[19:21] of God that it's always been and it
[19:24] hasn't changed and so what we'll do is
[19:26] we we'll just uh uh start uh the tape at
[19:31] this time and and uh brother Matson Bose
[19:35] introduces brother brandom brother
[19:37] brandom just makes a a quick greeting
[19:41] and then uh he reads the scripture so
[19:44] just be about two minutes and then we'll
[19:47] sit down after he reads the scripture so

[19:59] God bless you and we're so happy to have
[20:01] you with us let us
[20:03] pray oh Lord we are grateful to thee for
[20:07] the privilege of coming out again
[20:09] tonight to worship thee and we would ask
[20:12] that your presence would bless us all
[20:16] and may we tonight have the privilege of
[20:20] seeing you win souls to the kingdom of
[20:25] God bringing back those sheep that's
[20:28] gone on
[20:29] astray oh Eternal and blessed God speak
[20:33] to us through Thy word like never
[20:36] before and give us the desire of our
[20:39] heart to see the children born into the
[20:42] kingdom then heal the sick and Afflicted
[20:46] get Glory out of the service as we
[20:49] commit ourselves unto thee for we ask it
[20:52] in the name of thy holy and beloved
[20:56] Child Jesus amen
[20:59] may be
[21:04] seated I was so happy this afternoon to
[21:08] learn that a little help is on the road
[21:11] for me that
[21:14] brother Tommy Osburn my good brother and
[21:17] friend is to arrive here now with this
[21:20] picture black gold for Saturday night I
[21:23] believe it is and then he will also uh
[21:26] help in Sunday afternoon brother Tommy
[21:29] will be preaching and praying for the
[21:31] sick so I know you will enjoy this great
[21:36] servant of the Lord Brother uh Tommy
[21:40] osbor and now tonight if the Lord
[21:44] willing um I have two Bibles and I don't
[21:48] want to preach both of them through but
[21:51] I had one text or one scripture I wish
[21:54] to read in one and then a text in the
[21:57] other
[21:59] in the book of St Luke's gospel the 17th
[22:04] chapter and beginning with the 20 six
[22:07] verse we read
[22:09] this and as it was in the days of
[22:13] Noah so shall it be also in the days of
[22:18] the son of
[22:19] man they did eat they did drink they
[22:24] married wives they were given in
[22:27] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[22:30] into the ark and the floods came and
[22:33] destroyed them
[22:36] all likewise
[22:39] also it was in the days of lot they did
[22:43] eat they drank they bought they sold
[22:49] they planted they
[22:51] build but the same day that lot went out
[22:55] of Sodom it rained fire and Brimstone
[22:59] from heaven and destroyed them
[23:03] all even thus shall it be in the day
[23:07] when the son of man is
[23:10] revealed and now by the way of uh text
[23:15] so I read that to have a
[23:18] context in the Blessed scriptures in
[23:22] Genesis the 19th Chapter and the 22nd
[23:26] verse it reads this way
[23:29] Escape thee hither for I can do nothing
[23:34] till thou comes
[23:37] tither now I would like to take for a
[23:39] subject tonight if the Lord would permit
[23:42] it that way the called
[23:47] out last evening it was laid upon my
[23:52] heart to speak on the subject of the
[23:56] handwriting on the wall
[24:00] and the
[24:01] Lord did bless
[24:04] us and not only did he bless us but he
[24:08] furthered his kingdom by letting us read
[24:12] his
[24:13] word and to let the Holy Spirit reveal
[24:18] to us the things that's so close at
[24:22] hand and in doing so we
[24:26] type the Great modern Babylon with the
[24:30] great modern
[24:32] America and we found that in this nation
[24:36] of ours
[24:38] today we found ourselves in the same
[24:42] kind of a fix that they were in when
[24:46] they had a handwriting on the
[24:49] wall then we also found out that we have
[24:54] a handwriting on the
[24:56] wall and the same conditions Marley
[25:01] speaking they were drinking wine with
[25:05] the ill famed women in those days called
[25:09] concubines and today call well movie
[25:13] stars and so
[25:15] forth they were in their class then but
[25:18] now they're just scattered all
[25:24] everywhere sin is like a EG that's been
[25:27] broken in a
[25:30] saucer and sin would be the yellow in
[25:34] the
[25:34] middle I believe it's called the
[25:37] Yoke and when you go to picking in that
[25:41] Yol it scatters all over the
[25:45] egg and that's the way sin
[25:48] is you just going to commercializing it
[25:53] and uh
[25:54] and fixing it up and making it look
[25:57] pretty and giving it another name you
[26:00] scatter it through
[26:02] everywhere that's what sin has did in
[26:06] this great lovely nation of
[26:10] ours it has been
[26:13] glamorized I mean
[26:16] glamourized sin has become
[26:20] glamour years ago they used to have old
[26:23] Charlie
[26:25] Barleycorn a horrible looking creature
[26:28] with his hat pulled down over his ears
[26:32] and look like some prehistoric animal
[26:36] that was the Charlie Barleycorn of a few
[26:40] years
[26:41] ago today he's all polished
[26:45] up he's in what they call a bumper and
[26:49] he's popular in a lot of so-called
[26:52] Christian ice
[26:54] boxes right but he's the same old evil
[26:59] demon
[27:01] right it used to be
[27:04] that sometimes
[27:07] Grandma for a toothache should smoke an
[27:10] old cane
[27:12] pipe but oh how popular that devil has
[27:19] become
[27:20] daughter
[27:22] mother and the little children even
[27:25] smoke and it's popular
[27:29] but it's sin just the
[27:33] same it's just hid under another
[27:39] name it used to be
[27:43] wrong
[27:45] for people to
[27:48] gamble they had places like of ill Fame
[27:52] where such things went on saloons where
[27:56] respectable people did
[27:59] attend and women used to when they would
[28:02] come down the street where there was a
[28:05] saloon that pass on the other
[28:10] side but
[28:12] today she puts her foot on the
[28:15] bar let some little babysitter take care
[28:19] of her
[28:20] children and she's become a butterfly
[28:24] instead of a
[28:25] mother she's more popular
[28:29] gambling it used to be in the dens and
[28:33] Dives of the low
[28:36] underworld has become that every time
[28:39] company comes they get out the cards and
[28:41] go to playing it's still
[28:46] sin God will make you pay for your sin
[28:51] he hates
[28:52] sin because he's a holy
[28:56] God and the holy God cannot tolerate
[29:03] sin if he could have stood sin he would
[29:07] have stopped the whole thing when the
[29:09] first sin was
[29:12] committed but sin requires
[29:15] death and they that do such is dead
[29:19] already in sin and
[29:22] trespasses I know that
[29:25] hurts but that's what I mean it to do
[29:29] is the
[29:33] hurt we seen that through them great
[29:37] evils we see a sweep of the oncoming
[29:41] judgments for this
[29:43] country for God
[29:46] cannot let us get by with sin he could
[29:52] not be a righteous God and let us live
[29:55] the way we're living without making us
[29:57] pay pay for
[30:00] it as I have said before I say again if
[30:04] the god of Heaven lets us get by with
[30:07] what we're doing you to be just would
[30:10] have to resurrect Sodom and gomorra and
[30:13] apologize to
[30:15] him for distra and for we're just as bad
[30:19] as they
[30:20] were maybe
[30:25] worse and now anyone
[30:28] who has the slightest bit of real spirit
[30:32] of God in them can feel the hot blast of
[30:37] the oncoming
[30:39] judgment in your spirit you can
[30:44] discern and know that there is something
[30:48] fixing to
[30:51] happen the whole world is
[30:55] quivering the little Nations the big
[30:59] Nations for in the hands of
[31:04] bolix communist ungodly bloodless
[31:09] heartless Cults lays the power to send
[31:13] this world to its ashes in one minute
[31:19] time just the mercies of God being
[31:23] longsuffering is also a hold in
[31:26] it we can be become Russia's satellite
[31:29] before in the
[31:31] morning and yet we don't notice
[31:34] it we just go right on and they don't
[31:38] know what all this nervous condition's
[31:43] about when the world has become a
[31:47] neurotic even the
[31:50] psychiatrists themselves are having
[31:52] nervous
[31:56] breakdowns the natural will never be
[31:59] able to interpret the
[32:02] supernatural neither could The Magicians
[32:05] and the astrologers ever read the
[32:07] handwriting on the wall it put the
[32:11] spirit fill man to do
[32:17] so those astrologers could not read
[32:19] unknown
[32:21] tongues they had not the gift of
[32:25] interpretation to know the supernatural
[32:29] therefore they didn't know what it was
[32:31] all
[32:32] about that's what the world is today
[32:35] theyve Dilly DED along in the things of
[32:39] rock and roll parties and big Shin digs
[32:43] in their churches and cold farmal
[32:47] sermons on the flowers and so forth and
[32:50] the gospel has been
[32:52] neglected right and they know nothing
[32:55] about the supernatural
[32:58] you can speak to them on this all
[33:02] together message that should be taught
[33:05] everywhere of the coming of the Lord and
[33:08] they laugh at
[33:11] it it's the most needed message in the
[33:17] land but the spiritual
[33:21] people the Born
[33:24] Again knows that something's fixing to
[33:28] happen and they're happy about it
[33:32] because it's the coming of the Lord
[33:35] Jesus the second time for his
[33:39] church but the
[33:42] unsaved they don't know what it's all
[33:46] about it seems to be a supernatural
[33:50] move I had the privilege just the last
[33:54] couple years of having one of the
[33:58] greatest meetings the Lord ever let me
[34:01] have in Bombay
[34:05] India and just before getting there I'd
[34:09] studied much of their
[34:11] Nation found out that the mids of
[34:15] Persians that took Babylon from belto
[34:19] cure their tribes settled up there and
[34:23] called the Hindus
[34:26] today and then when I was reading in
[34:30] their paper and I had the clipping of it
[34:33] yet today something that was
[34:37] startling when I read something that
[34:40] seems to have a spiritual significance I
[34:43] like to keep
[34:45] it for God never moves unless it means
[34:50] something and I was
[34:52] reading that where they said in their
[34:55] paper
[34:57] that just had a great earthquake that
[35:00] shook a great part of their country you
[35:03] read that in your own American papers
[35:05] about two years
[35:07] ago and it was said for about two or
[35:12] three days before this earthquake struck
[35:16] a great strange thing took
[35:21] place that all the sheep and the
[35:25] cattle that used to hang around around
[35:28] the
[35:29] walls in India instead of having fences
[35:32] they have
[35:34] walls and their barns Are Made of Stone
[35:38] many of them and where the cattle would
[35:41] stand around in the shade of the
[35:46] wall all the cattle and the Sheep tuck
[35:50] off to the middle of the
[35:52] field and the little
[35:55] birds that had their nest up in the Coes
[35:59] of the barns flew
[36:01] away out into the
[36:05] forest before the earthquake happened
[36:08] because the walls would fall on
[36:12] them there was no one to drive them
[36:16] out there was no literal sign to show
[36:20] that there was an earth quake
[36:23] coming but being that God takes care of
[36:27] his own
[36:30] they had a feeling they was impressed by
[36:34] the Holy Spirit to get out way from the
[36:39] trouble and it seems to me that man who
[36:43] are made in the image of God feeling
[36:47] this great pressure coming on should go
[36:49] to
[36:52] safety but they don't do it they won't
[36:56] listen
[36:58] though the warning voice of God speaks
[37:02] day after day right night after night
[37:07] but man desires to live in
[37:15] sin you know it's later than we
[37:21] think people thinks they got plenty of
[37:24] time but the scriptures declares it's
[37:27] later than we
[37:30] think Jesus said as it was in the days
[37:35] of Noah and the days of
[37:39] lot so shall it be in the coming of the
[37:43] son of
[37:47] man let us see what taken place in the
[37:51] days of the coming of the destruction
[37:55] and judgment in the days of Noah and in
[37:59] the days of
[38:02] lot they were both
[38:06] affiliated with the third
[38:10] destruction Jesus said just as it were
[38:14] in those days so will it
[38:18] be when the son of man comes the third
[38:23] the second
[38:24] time it'll be just like was
[38:29] Dan and we're taught that in the days of
[38:33] Noah and not only at that time but in
[38:36] the days of
[38:38] lot as Junction
[38:41] times and every time before judgment
[38:45] comes to the Earth God sends Mercy
[38:52] call just before the days of the anti
[38:56] luian
[38:58] destruction God sent a prophet to the
[39:01] Earth
[39:03] Enoch and he sent an
[39:06] angel and he sent a
[39:08] message and he did the
[39:12] supernatural but what did man
[39:15] do they eat they
[39:19] drink they
[39:21] planted they build they rejected the
[39:26] called of the
[39:29] message though the message that each of
[39:33] those men both lot and Noah their
[39:37] message consisted of
[39:39] this
[39:41] grace mercy and
[39:44] deliverance
[39:46] right
[39:48] Grace God's mercy to the
[39:52] people was presented through Grace and
[39:57] Deliverance was presented to the people
[40:00] but they turned it down that's right
[40:04] what did we find them
[40:07] doing laughing
[40:10] scoffing making
[40:12] fun Maring wives living in
[40:16] adultery building
[40:19] planning look at the building program
[40:23] today and let me say something something
[40:27] right here
[40:29] also look at the advancement in the
[40:32] scientific world right now I say this
[40:37] not to
[40:39] scandalize neither do I say it to hurt
[40:43] feeling I only said because it's the
[40:48] truth but those kind of works comes from
[40:52] the other
[40:55] side the sons of
[40:59] King become great Builders and great
[41:03] scientists The Temper Iron and Metals
[41:06] and build and the great scientific world
[41:10] was a very religious world but come from
[41:16] Kain but the lineage that come from SE
[41:21] were poor humbled peasant type who
[41:25] believed God
[41:29] and when the prophet preached they
[41:32] received it when the supernatural was
[41:35] done they received it yes and when
[41:40] Deliverance was offered they receiv
[41:43] received it and the other side perished
[41:48] in the judgments of the Lord
[41:52] God they thought because they were smart
[41:57] that they could just live with any woman
[42:00] they wish
[42:01] to because they were smart they could
[42:05] drink and it was nobody's
[42:09] business but God hates
[42:13] sin yes and he will not let it go
[42:20] unjudged and the very thing that
[42:24] destroyed the unbeliever
[42:27] tuck the believer to
[42:31] safety it was the Waters of
[42:34] judgment that destroyed the unbeliever
[42:38] and it was the same Waters that packed
[42:41] Noah to
[42:44] safety and it's the gospel
[42:47] message that will destroy the unbeliever
[42:51] that'll take the church in the Rapture
[42:54] before the Judgment ever strikes
[42:59] they will be safely carried
[43:03] through Jesus said go ye into all the
[43:08] world and preach the gospel to every
[43:13] creature and when this is
[43:16] done then the end time shall be right
[43:21] when the gospel has reached the
[43:24] world our blessed blessed savior said
[43:29] then the end shall
[43:32] be now he never said when you passed
[43:35] tracks over the world or when you sent
[43:39] Bibles over the
[43:40] world or when you have sent missionaries
[43:44] over the world but when this gospel has
[43:48] been
[43:50] preached what is the gospel
[43:54] then Paul said the gospel came came to
[43:57] us not in word
[43:59] only but through the power and the
[44:03] demonstrations of the Holy Spirit the
[44:07] Holy Spirit making the word
[44:12] manifest for if you follow the very next
[44:15] verse when he said go ye into all the
[44:19] world and preach the gospel to Every
[44:23] Creature he said these son shall fall
[44:27] follow them that
[44:30] believe lo I Am With You Always even to
[44:36] the end of the world to manifest himself
[44:41] the same yesterday today and
[44:46] forever most
[44:48] time when we try to bring this
[44:54] message our words seem to to the world
[44:58] as like just Lots did to his kin
[45:04] folks it seems to be that we were
[45:07] mocking to them are their Idle
[45:12] Words Their pastors either byass this
[45:17] great message of
[45:20] Deliverance or try to explain it out
[45:23] into
[45:24] another generation to come
[45:28] but the facts of it is that the angel of
[45:32] the Lord is present to confirm the word
[45:36] and manifest the power of the Holy
[45:41] Ghost and these signs
[45:48] follow they tried to
[45:50] Mock and they said to lot well they just
[45:54] made fun of lot
[45:57] his own Kindred and lot was a just
[46:01] man the Bible said that their sins vexed
[46:06] his righteous Soul
[46:09] daily to see the
[46:12] perversion and this nation is loaded
[46:16] with
[46:17] it the misusing of the human
[46:22] body when it's on the Rampage alcohol
[46:26] ICS dope
[46:28] things teenage juvenile delinquency just
[46:33] like it was
[46:35] then and Men mock at
[46:38] it and when they see the supernatural
[46:42] signs of the Lord God they try to say
[46:45] that we're mocking
[46:50] religion someone said not long ago wrote
[46:53] me a letter some great doctor of
[46:59] divinity and he said Mr brandham get
[47:03] next to yourself you're trying to
[47:07] impersonate the Lord
[47:10] Jesus said you're only making them
[47:14] mock how little this poor decrepit man
[47:19] knew that it's not a man can do that
[47:23] it's the sign of the end time
[47:26] and he's fulfilling
[47:31] it but they mocked that lot oh don't
[47:36] listen to him the man's
[47:39] crazy how could this great place be
[47:44] destroyed how could Sodom and
[47:48] gomorah the greatest City on the KNN
[47:52] Earth how could it be destroyed with
[47:56] fire in
[47:58] Brimstone they say today how could the
[48:02] world be burnt
[48:04] over how could the world be
[48:08] destroyed my most beloved
[48:12] brother the same word of God that spoken
[48:16] into existence says she'll go out of
[48:19] existence by the same way it was spoken
[48:22] by the word of the Lord amen
[48:27] that is
[48:30] true God be merciful to this poor
[48:36] miserable blind wretched naked
[48:42] Nation did not the bible say that you
[48:45] say I'm riched and increased in Goods I
[48:48] have needed nothing and know not that th
[48:52] miserable wretched blind and naked and
[48:55] don't know it
[48:58] what a pitiful
[49:02] condition I want you to notice something
[49:05] just for a moment that comes to my
[49:09] mind Before Destruction of Sodom and
[49:14] Gomorrah we find that God's had a
[49:17] prophet up on top of the
[49:20] mountain by the name of
[49:23] Abraham and he had given him a prop
[49:27] and he was willing to take the hard way
[49:31] and preach the real true word than to
[49:34] live in
[49:36] sin and was just before this great
[49:40] destruction taken place that the angel
[49:44] of the Lord met
[49:47] him I want you to watch now Noah's time
[49:52] it was
[49:53] water Sodom and gomorra it was
[49:57] fire and we're taught by God's most holy
[50:02] word that this time it'll be fire right
[50:08] right I
[50:10] notice the scriptures
[50:14] speaking Sarah around the hundred years
[50:18] old Abraham 90 and9 years
[50:24] old then Sarah would be 80
[50:28] n so many years ago had ceased to be
[50:33] with her as it is with
[50:36] women but yet Abraham held on for he
[50:41] knew that God was able to keep his
[50:45] promise he was faithful he stayed by the
[50:50] word the word that God had spoken to
[50:55] him that's how Angels appear to people
[50:59] it's when you stay by the word not by
[51:03] manmade theology but by the word thus
[51:08] sayeth the Lord that's when the Angels
[51:13] appear Abraham stayed by the
[51:18] word and while he was sitting under the
[51:22] oak one day he saw three men coming
[51:27] up and he was
[51:30] spiritual for he know that God was still
[51:36] God and as these men begin to
[51:40] appear Abraham run out to meet them and
[51:44] said s stop in just a
[51:48] moment and let me fetch you just a
[51:51] little water to wash your feet and we'll
[51:54] make a little cake and then you refresh
[51:58] yourself then you can be going for this
[52:01] cause you have come oh wish I had time
[52:04] to go into those
[52:06] words for this cause you have
[52:10] come and so when the little meal was
[52:14] made
[52:15] ready and Abraham stood watching these
[52:19] men
[52:20] eat the angel had his back turned to the
[52:24] tent
[52:27] the Bible said his back was to the
[52:32] tent and Sarah was on the inside of the
[52:38] tent what's the nature of this
[52:41] Angel bringing the last message Before
[52:50] Destruction he said Abraham I'm going to
[52:54] keep my promise to you
[52:57] yes I love that that's our Father
[53:02] God I'll keep my promise to
[53:07] you just about the time of life
[53:11] according to the time of Life about the
[53:13] next 28
[53:15] days I'm going to visit you and that
[53:20] baby that you waited for these 25 years
[53:24] you're going to have it
[53:28] poor little
[53:30] Sarah kind of weak in
[53:33] faith but in them days the circumcision
[53:36] of the man brought the woman in also for
[53:40] only the circumcision could be
[53:42] recognized before God and the female
[53:45] could not be circumcised therefore the
[53:48] husband was the atonement for her
[53:50] because they are
[53:52] one Abraham's Faith helped Sarah at that
[53:56] time
[53:57] Sarah back in the
[54:01] tent behind the
[54:04] angel when the angel said Sarah will
[54:07] have the
[54:09] baby Sarah in her heart not out
[54:14] loud in her heart she
[54:19] laughed and the angel with his back to
[54:22] the tent looking Abraham in the face
[54:24] said why did Sarah
[54:28] laugh what kind of a telepathy is
[54:34] that in the
[54:37] tent Discerning her
[54:40] thought behind him don't you see how the
[54:44] scripture makes that
[54:47] plain that was the last warning message
[54:51] Before
[54:52] Destruction open your eyes
[54:57] behind him in the tent not out loud but
[55:02] in her heart and the angel of the Lord
[55:07] discerned what she
[55:11] did what did she
[55:13] laugh and she was called forth and she
[55:16] was trembling she said I didn't laugh he
[55:18] said oh yes you did
[55:22] laugh that was the angel bringing the
[55:26] light CH message before fire fell from
[55:30] heaven Jesus said as it was in the days
[55:34] of Sodom and
[55:37] gomorah so will it be in the days that
[55:41] the son of man is revealed from Heaven
[55:44] Hallelujah that's
[55:47] right you see the
[55:49] message when the son of man is revealed
[55:53] from heaven now when this Angel went to
[55:56] s
[55:58] and begin to speak his
[56:00] message to a man they mo at him and
[56:05] laughed at him and they would not
[56:09] receive the
[56:10] message neither do they do it today it's
[56:15] the very same thing that's right and
[56:18] they won't believe
[56:21] it there's only one thing left that's
[56:25] judgment
[56:28] but
[56:30] notice the Bible said they'd be like
[56:33] that in second Timothy 3 the Bible said
[56:38] that they will be in the last days the
[56:40] spirit speaks
[56:43] expressly that's directly not to that
[56:46] day but to the last
[56:49] day man shall be
[56:52] heav high
[56:54] minded lovers a television uh things of
[56:58] the
[57:00] world that's goes in with
[57:03] it lovers of the world more than the
[57:08] lovers of
[57:10] God truce Breakers and false
[57:16] accusers and despisers of those which
[57:20] are
[57:22] good you say that's atheist brother
[57:25] renam that must be communist that's
[57:28] American so-called
[57:32] Christians having a farm of
[57:35] godliness but denying the power the
[57:39] supernatural of the Gospel from such get
[57:44] away from their
[57:46] walls from such turn away for this is a
[57:51] sort that goes from house to house and
[57:54] with societies and so forth silly women
[57:57] captive with sin taken away with divver
[58:00] lust well all kinds of parties and my
[58:03] church does this and we have so much
[58:05] time but no time to seek the holy ghost
[58:09] in the notion and minds of
[58:12] God they
[58:15] denied no
[58:18] time but I want you to
[58:21] notice
[58:22] lot and also oh notice
[58:29] Noah before any rain could ever
[58:34] fall before one drop of
[58:38] marure come from the oncoming clouds of
[58:44] judgment as we read last night and I
[58:48] believe truly by the gospel we see the
[58:51] handwriting on the
[58:53] wall anybody I believe that was mentally
[58:57] balanced could see that we have just a
[58:59] few hours
[59:01] left and maybe this is the last one but
[59:06] before one drop of water of judgment
[59:09] fell Noah went in the
[59:12] [Applause]
[59:15] ark and did not Abraham say to the angel
[59:19] would the judge of all the Earth make
[59:21] the innocent suffer with the guilty
[59:26] certainly not the judge of all the Earth
[59:29] will do
[59:32] righteous and
[59:35] notice before there was even one Speck
[59:39] of
[59:39] fire that come from the
[59:42] skies lot was taken out of
[59:47] Sodom Jesus said as it was in the days
[59:51] of Noah and in the days of lot so will
[59:55] it be in in the coming of the Son of
[59:59] God and if the handwriting's on the
[1:00:04] wall if the time of judgment is at
[1:00:08] hand how close is the rapture of the
[1:00:15] church how close is it
[1:00:19] tonight think of
[1:00:21] it Noah went into the ark for safety
[1:00:27] lot came out of
[1:00:30] Sodom one came out the other went
[1:00:34] in what is it the type of when it's
[1:00:38] conglomerated together it's a type of
[1:00:42] the church coming out of the world for
[1:00:45] safety and going into the Ark of Christ
[1:00:49] to go to
[1:00:50] Glory one come out the other went in
[1:00:57] one come out to keep from being
[1:00:58] destroyed with the world the other went
[1:01:01] into the Ark of Safety and Christ is the
[1:01:04] Ark of
[1:01:06] Safety and remember
[1:01:10] before that the
[1:01:12] judgments of hail fire and
[1:01:15] darkness swept over
[1:01:18] Egypt Israel made her way to Goan where
[1:01:23] there was light
[1:01:26] and Egypt was left to wonderand in the
[1:01:29] darkness that's right men and
[1:01:33] women listen to me
[1:01:35] now before you're left on this Earth of
[1:01:41] misery and caner here in sin run to the
[1:01:46] light as hard as you can
[1:01:49] go the light Christ Jesus and accept his
[1:01:54] message of Mercy
[1:01:59] hurry said the
[1:02:00] angel and Escape tither for I can't do
[1:02:05] nothing till thou has come
[1:02:08] out judgments cannot
[1:02:11] come Russia's got the missile that'll
[1:02:14] put on us on our
[1:02:16] knees and so our scientist says that we
[1:02:19] are five years behind
[1:02:22] them it'll be five years before we can
[1:02:26] catch up to where they are
[1:02:28] now our little spudnik fizzled about
[1:02:31] three foot off the
[1:02:34] ground theirs made trip after trip
[1:02:37] around the
[1:02:39] world what is it speaking to us God
[1:02:43] saying to his church come
[1:02:46] hither for I can do nothing till thou
[1:02:50] has come
[1:02:52] hither God waiting for his church to
[1:02:56] break down their denominational bearers
[1:02:58] and come together for a real outpouring
[1:03:01] of the Holy Spirit to lift her to
[1:03:06] Glory I can do
[1:03:09] nothing until thou comes thither waiting
[1:03:13] for us to come
[1:03:16] together Jesus said when the son of man
[1:03:19] is revealed from
[1:03:22] heaven let me close by saying this
[1:03:27] that the son of man is now being
[1:03:31] revealed from
[1:03:34] heaven will it come after a while
[1:03:37] brother bandham it is
[1:03:40] now and I hope I won't have to make this
[1:03:44] so
[1:03:46] personal of this own
[1:03:48] meeting but that your spirit within you
[1:03:52] that's give you by God can read what I'm
[1:03:55] talking about
[1:03:58] the son of man has already come from
[1:04:03] glory and is revealing himself for the
[1:04:07] past few years to his church in
[1:04:12] Mercy showing them his great presence
[1:04:16] doing the same things that he did when
[1:04:19] he was here on Earth revealing himself
[1:04:22] like he did to
[1:04:23] Abraham before the destruction he has
[1:04:27] come now in Mercy revealing himself to
[1:04:31] the church it's being laughed at and
[1:04:33] scof that the next time he reveals
[1:04:36] himself it'll be in
[1:04:40] judgment on the world and the Nations
[1:04:44] that's forgot God and send their way of
[1:04:48] Grace their day of Grace rather
[1:04:52] away because they have forgotten God and
[1:04:55] and they're doing the same thing that
[1:04:57] they did to the angel of the Lord back
[1:04:58] there mocking and making fun of it
[1:05:02] right but he sure now in Mercy he will
[1:05:07] come in judgment upon the Nations and
[1:05:12] while he is being revealed in Mercy oh
[1:05:15] hurry ye
[1:05:16] hither run quickly
[1:05:19] children get away from these
[1:05:22] manmade Babylonian theological w walls
[1:05:26] of unbelief in cold
[1:05:29] formalism run away from man-made
[1:05:32] theology get out in the middle of the
[1:05:34] feeling God's grace and there scream for
[1:05:37] Mercy for it is his blood of his own son
[1:05:41] that gives the mercy to
[1:05:44] us get away from this old world of Doubt
[1:05:48] get away from your superstitions accept
[1:05:51] God's message of Mercy Hallelujah and
[1:05:54] his message of deliverance and flee to
[1:05:57] the middle of his grace and there scream
[1:06:00] oh Jesus thou Son of God have mercy on
[1:06:05] me for the walls of these man-made
[1:06:09] doctrines is going to crumble and perish
[1:06:12] with the unbelieving world for they that
[1:06:16] believe not perish with those who
[1:06:19] believe not the world of unbelief perish
[1:06:23] with those who believe not
[1:06:26] but righteous lot was taken out and so
[1:06:29] was Noah yes think of it while we pray
[1:06:33] just a
[1:06:40] moment wasn't that a great
[1:06:43] reminder huh puts things back into
[1:06:47] perspective you know what what what we
[1:06:49] believe the son of man the son of man is
[1:06:52] here now he said and you he said well
[1:06:57] people sit back and ask and they say
[1:06:59] well why hasn't he come yet God can do
[1:07:02] nothing till you run
[1:07:04] hither you you understand he's waiting
[1:07:07] for us to manifest and like we talked
[1:07:10] about this morning uh there just so many
[1:07:13] beautiful things he says
[1:07:17] he he said you you know I like what he
[1:07:20] said he said the same God that spoke the
[1:07:23] world into existence you know people say
[1:07:25] well how is it how's the world going to
[1:07:27] be destroyed the same way it came into
[1:07:30] existence the same way it's going to go
[1:07:33] out of existence by the word of God you
[1:07:36] know man just thinks he can outsmart God
[1:07:39] that just I I don't know poor pathetic
[1:07:43] things that we are huh God's got it
[1:07:46] exactly in control you also notice he
[1:07:49] made a statement I thought was
[1:07:51] tremendous he said that the angel of the
[1:07:54] Lord appears where men are trying to
[1:07:58] follow the word of
[1:08:01] God you know what I mean so just picture
[1:08:04] this in your
[1:08:05] life if if and you know what the angel
[1:08:09] of the Lord did it brought the super
[1:08:11] natural so if you're doing your best to
[1:08:14] be a Christian like we talked this
[1:08:15] morning is not possessing the a
[1:08:19] attributes that we're after it's using
[1:08:23] the attributes is what that we're
[1:08:25] wanting to achieve to have the faith I I
[1:08:28] I love Martha's testimony because the
[1:08:31] man was sick and she say caregiver and
[1:08:34] and she the faith moved on her and she
[1:08:37] finally got down and prayed with him and
[1:08:39] said you're not going to be sick today
[1:08:42] you're not going to die today you're
[1:08:44] going to be well I'm going to pray for
[1:08:46] you well that man now became the
[1:08:49] recipient of the attribute that she had
[1:08:53] within her that she knew God was a
[1:08:55] Healer
[1:08:56] and now something Supernatural happened
[1:08:58] the man got up and was doing well well
[1:09:01] we know the man's at the end of his time
[1:09:03] but just think he got a taste of the
[1:09:08] supernatural because somebody was
[1:09:10] willing to take an attribute and the
[1:09:14] love that was in their heart and to to
[1:09:19] press that love forward that there would
[1:09:22] be somebody to receive it and and and I
[1:09:26] I just thought it was good I hope I not
[1:09:28] embarrass her in any way but the first
[1:09:31] thing Satan tried to do was to play it
[1:09:33] down to play her down to to play the
[1:09:36] situation down to talk you out of it
[1:09:39] that's what that's what Satan always
[1:09:41] tries to do talk you out of it but he
[1:09:45] can do nothing till we come
[1:09:48] hither and and so we know we're in the
[1:09:51] day of the son of man we know we're in
[1:09:53] the day of the fulfilling of the word so
[1:09:56] what's he waiting on he's waiting on us
[1:09:59] to get back to the faith that was once
[1:10:02] delivered to us not get away from it but
[1:10:05] get back to it get back to it to I mean
[1:10:08] I just thought this I I really enjoyed
[1:10:10] that and if if we wanted to stay or if
[1:10:14] you can go it's called it's called the
[1:10:17] message is called the called out and
[1:10:19] then he
[1:10:21] demonstrates the secret of the knowing
[1:10:24] and the calling out out of the secrets
[1:10:26] of the heart and he said I hope that you
[1:10:29] can see it and you know what took place
[1:10:32] people would come up before him they'd
[1:10:34] come up before him he would take he took
[1:10:36] them by the hand and he could show them
[1:10:39] by what was going on in his hand what
[1:10:42] they was and then it came to the time
[1:10:44] that he actually didn't even they didn't
[1:10:47] even have to take him by the hand
[1:10:50] sometimes he would still take them by
[1:10:51] the hand it never left that that they
[1:10:54] could see something naturally you know
[1:10:57] he says look at my hand you see the
[1:10:59] bumps they can see the bumps he says you
[1:11:01] see the bumps go away you're well amen
[1:11:04] but he would also just come up and say
[1:11:06] You're such and such you're from such
[1:11:07] and such place and and you've got this
[1:11:11] wrong with you I see a doctor standing
[1:11:13] over oh you've got this problem you've
[1:11:15] got that problem then he would just turn
[1:11:17] out in the audience and go right down
[1:11:19] the road you know one time there's a
[1:11:22] bunch of unbelief in the building he
[1:11:23] just started one side of the Pew and
[1:11:26] went right down every single row all the
[1:11:28] way
[1:11:30] down you can't you we serve a
[1:11:33] supernatural God
[1:11:35] church amen we're not going to get out
[1:11:38] and fuss and fight with this Doctrine or
[1:11:41] what this church is doing or or where
[1:11:43] they're going that's not what we're
[1:11:45] called to do we're called to make the
[1:11:48] Lord Jesus live in our lives and what's
[1:11:51] been freely given to us we freely give
[1:11:54] to others and if we seek to do the word
[1:11:57] of the Lord the angels of God are en
[1:12:00] camped about them that fear them they're
[1:12:03] camped about the righteous and you'll
[1:12:06] see the supernatural in your life
[1:12:09] working and God will do for you
[1:12:11] exceedingly and abundantly above what
[1:12:14] you can even ask or or think it's just
[1:12:18] it it it's just the way it is and and I
[1:12:22] like that little thing about Sin being
[1:12:25] like a yolk on an egg you you poke it
[1:12:28] you know what I mean and it just runs
[1:12:30] everywhere and and isn't that simply
[1:12:33] what they've done today they've made sin
[1:12:36] glamorous they did they've idolized the
[1:12:40] the the rainbow movement I think they
[1:12:44] call it and they have parades and they
[1:12:47] have days set aside and and that's all
[1:12:52] the handwriting on the wall for us let's
[1:12:54] don't forget get the handwriting on the
[1:12:57] wall let's don't forget it let's don't
[1:13:00] let it numb us
[1:13:02] down you know and and and and create a
[1:13:07] fear in us where we won't stand up for
[1:13:10] the things that are our Christianity and
[1:13:12] for the power of
[1:13:14] God they want to create an atmosphere
[1:13:17] where Faith can't work and if Faith
[1:13:20] can't work we can't work and if we can't
[1:13:23] work we can't get ready and and the
[1:13:25] bride's made itself ready so I I really
[1:13:28] hope you enjoyed the the tape tonight I
[1:13:31] thought it was spectacular I don't know
[1:13:33] if many of you have heard that tape or
[1:13:36] or or it's it's just kind of one of
[1:13:39] those that contains so much you know

[1:16:42] to let you know all that so amen let's
[1:16:45] just bow our heads and have word of pray
[1:16:46] our gracious Heavenly Father what a
[1:16:50] wonderful message we heard as our
[1:16:53] messenger was
[1:16:56] bringing to the
[1:16:58] church and introducing them to the
[1:17:02] promise of the son of man in this last
[1:17:08] day that the signs and
[1:17:11] wonders that were being performed were
[1:17:15] promised from the
[1:17:18] scriptures brother bm's Ministry wasn't
[1:17:21] built by
[1:17:22] him by his faith or
[1:17:27] by his nature or his Spirit it was built
[1:17:30] by the word of God prophesied and
[1:17:33] fulfilled and brought to
[1:17:37] pass and Lord we saw as the ministry
[1:17:40] went
[1:17:43] that it was a sign of the son of man
[1:17:46] given before the oncoming
[1:17:49] judgment and then father we begin to see
[1:17:53] as it was in the days of the the voice
[1:17:55] of the seventh angel that the mysteries
[1:17:58] of God would be
[1:18:00] revealed father then we saw the ministry
[1:18:03] went to open the seals
[1:18:06] and reveal the church age messengers of
[1:18:10] the
[1:18:10] age and the spirit of each of the ages
[1:18:14] and how that Spirit came up through the
[1:18:19] church and father we've seen so much has
[1:18:22] been open to our hearts
[1:18:26] and it's father that we could understand
[1:18:28] that we are the called
[1:18:31] out and as this tape said tonight the
[1:18:34] called
[1:18:35] out those who could read the handwriting
[1:18:38] on the
[1:18:40] wall who could see the sign of the
[1:18:44] time were the called
[1:18:48] out those that could recognize the
[1:18:51] supernatural
[1:18:55] that God was
[1:18:58] separating by calling forth the people
[1:19:01] that they could recognize that father
[1:19:03] the called
[1:19:04] out and father may we with
[1:19:09] humility and a contrite
[1:19:12] spirit recognize
[1:19:15] ourselves as being the called
[1:19:17] out with humility
[1:19:20] father and
[1:19:23] graciousness and meekness and kindness
[1:19:26] and gentleness
[1:19:28] father accept our
[1:19:33] election that you've chosen us and
[1:19:36] elected
[1:19:38] us and father that we have a
[1:19:43] duty to go into all the
[1:19:47] world and preach the
[1:19:52] gospel to manifest the attrib Utes
[1:19:58] father father if we have goodness in our
[1:20:01] heart May there be someone that can
[1:20:05] receive the goodness that we have to
[1:20:08] offer the kindness that we have to offer
[1:20:12] father may you come alive in your
[1:20:16] church father many people say it's the
[1:20:19] bride coming of Christ but maybe really
[1:20:23] it's the bride coming to
[1:20:26] Christ is what we
[1:20:29] need and father we just trust that that
[1:20:32] would be our example bless us tonight
[1:20:35] and thank you for this day father bless
[1:20:39] those that couldn't be here father for
[1:20:41] work or for whatever reason father if
[1:20:45] there any be sick we just ask that you
[1:20:48] would quickly Lord
[1:20:50] Jesus
[1:20:52] bring strength and
[1:20:55] and health to them Father that they
[1:20:57] might be about your business father we
[1:21:01] pray for Matthew and F Daran as they're
[1:21:04] in
[1:21:04] India father and they're they're
[1:21:07] traveling and father seven and8 hour bus
[1:21:11] rides just that they can meet with
[1:21:13] different ministers that have never
[1:21:16] heard of this message before and
[1:21:19] introduce the message we ask that you
[1:21:22] would Grant it to them father in your
[1:21:26] precious and wonderful name we pray amen
[1:21:31] and amen so we just ask those blessings
[1:21:34] this evening you know I believe India
[1:21:37] think I don't know if it has twice the
[1:21:39] population of China but it's about 1/4
[1:21:43] of the area so it's a lot of people a
[1:21:46] lot close together and if you want to
[1:21:49] get an idea of travel there just take
[1:21:52] your phone and Google India train rides
[1:21:57] and India bus
[1:21:59] rides and you'll see people sitting on
[1:22:03] top on the
[1:22:05] back out the window in
[1:22:08] everywhere
[1:22:10] and you know they it ain't they don't
[1:22:13] have what's called First
[1:22:15] Class you know what I mean they they
[1:22:18] have I don't know what they have but and
[1:22:22] I I'm not saying it's just a very very
[1:22:25] very densely populated country but
[1:22:29] that's good because there's a lot of
[1:22:31] people that can hear the gospel and
[1:22:34] everybody deserves an opportunity to
[1:22:36] hear the gospel so I I I I appreciate it
[1:22:41] because what they're doing they're going
[1:22:43] there to meet with the
[1:22:44] ministers and and if those guys can
[1:22:47] catch the Revelation then they'll spread
[1:22:50] and it'll grow and who knows maybe the
[1:22:53] last ones there yes right so if we make
[1:22:56] ourselves ready they make their selves
[1:23:00] ready we'll go out of here and that's
[1:23:03] what we're all about so Lord bless you
