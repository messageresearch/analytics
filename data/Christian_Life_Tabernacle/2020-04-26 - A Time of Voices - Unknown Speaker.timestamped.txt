[38:10] precious name we pray amen amen
[38:14] I love that song that's one of my
[38:18] favorite songs in it I just can't help
[38:21] but tell the testimony when I was a
[38:25] younger man I moved from California to
[38:31] Montana because I heard the message
[38:35] called choosing of a bride and when I
[38:38] heard brother Branham prophesy about the
[38:42] destruction of California that there
[38:46] would be a time that would come that it
[38:49] would go under the sea well I didn't
[38:52] know where when that time was so I
[38:55] didn't want to be there and so we packed
[38:59] up and we moved to Montana now this was
[39:03] a California hippie moving up to one of
[39:06] the coldest places in the world and I
[39:09] had never seen snow but we went there
[39:12] because it was the least populated state
[39:15] in the whole Union and we wanted to just
[39:20] get away from it all you know I was in
[39:23] my early 20s and and so we went up there
[39:29] and I got a job in a lumber mill
[39:32] stacking lumber and so the lumber would
[39:36] come and it would go through a saw and
[39:40] it would be cut into eight foot lengths
[39:43] in ten foot lengths and twelve foot
[39:46] lengths and 16 foot links and we used to
[39:51] call it the the chain and that so that
[39:55] the lumber would come out and it would
[39:57] be marked and then it we cut into
[39:59] lengths and then there would be men
[40:02] standing in a line and they would take
[40:05] the lumber off by hand and stacked it in
[40:08] a pile so one guy he would be
[40:12] charge of all the boards that were maybe
[40:15] two by twelves by 16 and and another day
[40:21] and he would have two piles of boards
[40:23] and another guy would have two piles of
[40:26] boards and so there'd be about six eight
[40:28] guys on this great big line putting the
[40:32] lumber in their piles and when they got
[40:35] done forming one of those stacks of
[40:38] lumber like you see in the lumber yard
[40:40] then the jaw forklift driver would come
[40:43] and take it and haul it away well I was
[40:47] working at the very last end I was the
[40:50] last guy out of eight guys and I begin
[40:54] to sing this song what a day that will
[40:59] be when my Jesus I shall see when I look
[41:03] upon his face all and I just remembered
[41:07] I just got this stack in that lumber and
[41:10] singing that song and I stacked my
[41:12] lumber then I went up and before I knew
[41:15] it I was stacking the lumber of the guy
[41:18] in front of me and I'd stacked his
[41:21] lumber and then I walked back and
[41:22] stacked my lumber and then I went up and
[41:25] I started a stacked in lumber and before
[41:28] it was over everybody was looking at me
[41:32] I was stacking lumber for six guys what
[41:37] we're going up and down that chain with
[41:40] tears in my eyes thinking oh what a day
[41:43] it's going to be a glorious day when I
[41:46] shall see Jesus and we stacked lumber
[41:48] and I stack number and pretty soon there
[41:50] was no more lumber coming and I I guess
[41:55] I could say I finally came to and
[41:58] everybody was staring at me like what
[42:02] are you doing
[42:05] you know I'm sure some of the guys
[42:08] thought he wants my job
[42:09] no I didn't want that didn't want to be
[42:12] there
[42:13] you know but it was just such a
[42:16] miraculous thing I I'll never forget the
[42:19] feeling and the experience of what that
[42:22] was to me to be caught up in this
[42:25] and I'll tell you what you can do if you
[42:27] ever get caught up in the spirit is
[42:29] wonderful amen let's turn in our Bibles
[42:32] we don't want to be long but this
[42:36] morning I mean this evening but we do
[42:39] just want to bring a small thought or if
[42:42] I could say it this way something to our
[42:45] attention that we we should be aware of
[42:50] you you know and I I think that's always
[42:54] a good thing to Peter said it you know
[42:58] that what we need to stir up our minds
[43:01] and make us aware of what's going on you
[43:06] know a person that's aware of things do
[43:09] you ever get these I picked these I
[43:13] guess they're kind of emails and stuff
[43:15] you know or or scam alerts or whatever
[43:19] you call it that they want to make you
[43:21] aware that if somebody ever calls up and
[43:25] tells you that they're the IRS the IRS
[43:28] doesn't send you emails you know what I
[43:31] mean they don't send you they don't deal
[43:34] with you that way and and or they prey
[43:38] on old people a lot of times and so you
[43:42] know it's a good to be aware of what's
[43:44] going on so we want to talk a little bit
[43:46] about that that just a few moments this
[43:49] evening maybe we be out of here in 20 15
[43:52] minutes but just to kind of make us
[43:54] aware of the place that we are and the
[43:58] things that are going on so let's turn
[44:00] in our Bibles to the Gospel of st. John
[44:03] and the tenth chapter
[44:13] and this into this great teaching the
[44:20] Lord Jesus said you can just read this
[44:24] all the way through and it would be
[44:26] wonderful but we just wanted to talk
[44:28] just take the first five verses this is
[44:33] very verily I say unto you he that
[44:38] entereth not by the door into the
[44:44] sheepfold but climbeth up some other way
[44:48] the same is a thief and a robber my Amen
[44:58] there's one provided way and that's the
[45:01] shed blood anybody that tries to enter
[45:04] into the sheepfold some other way
[45:07] besides coming through Calvary's a thief
[45:10] and a robber but he that entereth in by
[45:14] the door is the Shepherd of the Sheep to
[45:22] him the porter openeth and the sheep
[45:25] hear his voice and he calleth his own
[45:30] sheep by name and leadeth them out and
[45:36] when he putteth forth his own sheep he
[45:41] goeth before them and the Sheep follow
[45:44] him for they know his voice and the
[45:50] stranger will they not follow but will
[45:55] flee from him for they know not the
[46:00] voice of strangers Amen father bless
[46:06] your word to us in your precious name we
[46:09] pray amen amen
[46:12] may be seated we notice in the scripture
[46:15] it certainly told us that that my sheep
[46:18] they hear my voice and I just wanted to
[46:23] just read
[46:25] very few statements this evening and and
[46:28] talk to us a little bit and to talk
[46:32] about that we have we have reached the
[46:37] condition and if I could say it this way
[46:41] and a time in our country and in this
[46:48] world and and the situation that were in
[46:53] they've we're kind of in a place that
[46:57] that nobody really knows what's going on
[47:01] now I would like to advise the world
[47:05] that there is somebody that knows what's
[47:07] going on
[47:09] Amen but if I could say it right that
[47:12] that we're in the age or the condition
[47:16] is right or I might say it this way the
[47:20] time is right for a lot of voices I mean
[47:26] I've never seen a time I I like to
[47:30] sometimes listen to Rick the radio on
[47:32] and I can't listen to people and talk
[47:35] Shore or listen to somebody and I've
[47:38] never heard a time of being so many
[47:42] voices now I don't know about next
[47:46] Sunday I've been told that April 30th
[47:50] it's all lifted and that we can all come
[47:53] back I've been told I've got a phone
[47:56] call and someone said okay you know I
[47:59] hope you have wisdom because you're
[48:01] gonna have to pick 50 people and and
[48:07] then someone else told me says no it's
[48:10] going to be half of what your church can
[48:14] hold and and then somebody else said no
[48:20] it's going to be extended and then
[48:22] somebody else said no as long as you're
[48:24] six feet apart and somebody said you're
[48:27] gonna have to have a temperature machine
[48:29] out front I think maybe we're older old
[48:32] ordering temperature machines so we can
[48:35] take your temperature before you
[48:38] to church why wouldn't it be wonderful
[48:42] if we could be able to discern who had
[48:46] the Holy Ghost amen you'd say well who
[48:49] would get in the church then the people
[48:52] that don't have it they would be the
[48:54] first amen Ezra just remember if the
[48:58] sick that needs a physician but then I
[49:01] can't just invite certain people because
[49:04] then people would say well he thinks I'm
[49:07] sick and need the Holy Ghost you know
[49:10] what I mean but probably if you think
[49:12] that way you do but when I'm saying have
[49:15] you ever heard a time that there's so
[49:18] many voices the seasons right for voices
[49:23] if it's a the time has been set up that
[49:29] there's going to be so many voices so
[49:32] many solutions so many ideas and and and
[49:39] you know what a time it is it what
[49:44] voices do is voices pull people apart
[49:49] amen I heard this I heard that I heard
[49:52] this I heard that and it's just a time
[49:56] that we've come and we found ourselves
[50:00] in a place of total chaos you know I
[50:06] heard I heard someone say that well
[50:09] brother such and such as preaching that
[50:11] the bride won't get the virus well I a
[50:18] man I don't believe that Bridal getting
[50:20] the virus I believe this whole sinful
[50:23] body can get the virus
[50:25] amen milk this body is not what the
[50:28] bride is anyway the bride is that word
[50:30] seed that has come to life that just it
[50:34] has taken over this body but we don't
[50:37] judge things by that what a voice what
[50:41] kind of voice is that you know the soul
[50:45] I've never seen a time so I just wanted
[50:49] to notice that Jesus
[50:51] spoke here that there would be a time
[50:54] that there'd be a lot of voices of a lot
[50:56] of stranger that and the sheep they know
[51:01] the voice of their master
[51:06] he says the master goes before them
[51:10] amen think of that the master goes
[51:13] before his sheep and they know his voice
[51:16] and another they will not follow now
[51:22] brother man preached this message in
[51:26] 1963 called the voice of God in the last
[51:31] days and when I begin to listen to it it
[51:36] never struck me so much as it it did in
[51:42] this present circumstance have you ever
[51:45] realized that when maybe a certain
[51:48] thought comes on your mind or the Lord
[51:51] quicken to something to you or you see
[51:54] something and you start to go back and
[51:56] you read in the Word of God and you
[51:58] start listening to messages it seems
[52:01] like brother branham's talking about it
[52:03] all the time it just seemed like all
[52:06] he's talking about his voice is always
[52:08] talking about his confusion always
[52:10] talking about this end time and yet it
[52:14] was there all the time but all of a
[52:17] sudden things changed and our focus
[52:20] changes um and when your focus changes
[52:25] you begin to look in certain directions
[52:28] you begin to listen for certain things
[52:31] you're trying to find something to set
[52:34] your bearings by I've been out on the
[52:40] dark ocean and I've seen it when you
[52:44] there's it's dark out there and there's
[52:46] not a star the clouds have set in can
[52:51] you just hear it laughing and there's no
[52:54] place that grab your bearing but the
[52:57] minute those clouds try to break there's
[53:00] one star there came in the morning star
[53:04] the know
[53:05] or star and it doesn't matter where you
[53:07] are there's a little triangle in the the
[53:11] sky of three stars that comes together
[53:14] and at point and a man couldn't me in
[53:17] the woods one day yep he was my guy he
[53:21] said if we get separated and we get lost
[53:23] just remember you see that triangle that
[53:26] triangle always points east
[53:29] that's East so it doesn't matter how you
[53:33] feel it doesn't matter where you think
[53:37] you are okay it doesn't matter what you
[53:44] suppose that was set by God and that
[53:49] always points the same way and that has
[53:53] not changed since it was put there in
[53:57] the beginning in other words you can
[54:00] count on that you can't count on your
[54:03] senses you can't count on what you feel
[54:06] you can't count on what you hear but you
[54:09] know that ceased and then he laid out
[54:12] the math and he says okay we're here if
[54:17] that star points east you go in that
[54:20] direction you will hit this road and
[54:24] when you hit this road you turn right
[54:28] and you walk till I find you it's all
[54:33] they had to do right no questions I had
[54:39] an absolute I had an absolute and when
[54:44] you've got an absolute then you have
[54:48] something that you go by something that
[54:52] that determines you know he told us that
[54:56] there would be a lot of voices a lot of
[55:01] voices and have you ever seen a time
[55:03] I've never seen a time of so many voices
[55:06] there's so many opinions okay so many
[55:11] thinking what is this what it isn't what
[55:14] it is what it will do what it won't do
[55:17] amen are you
[55:18] Aysen they called asymptomatic or
[55:21] something like that
[55:22] in other words you could be somebody
[55:24] that doesn't have it but you're a
[55:26] sprinter so I'm going to I'm going to
[55:33] put on my gloves and my mask and just in
[55:36] case you're a spreader if some people
[55:40] are going to die and some people aren't
[55:42] going to die and some are going to be
[55:43] sick and some aren't going to be sick
[55:45] and the whole world is going to do this
[55:47] and the whole world is going to do that
[55:49] then there's a whole another great big
[55:51] voice out there that
[55:52] oh we've overreacted who we shouldn't
[55:55] have done this and we shouldn't have
[55:57] done that we shouldn't have shut down
[55:58] the economy and there's another wall if
[56:00] we didn't we'd all be this and it's germ
[56:03] warfare and you know the Communists gave
[56:07] us this disease in another place no it
[56:10] came from a bat and you know what I mean
[56:12] and my goodness someone sent me a little
[56:16] thing that showed up bat in a bat
[56:20] sandwich okay I mean what-what a time
[56:28] you understand it but yet here God in
[56:32] His infinite wisdom in knowing the
[56:35] beginning from the end tells us he says
[56:40] and he sends us a message called the
[56:43] voice of God in the last days in other
[56:50] words there will be a voice in the last
[56:54] day there there will be an absolute
[56:58] there will be something to direct this
[57:01] and guide us so I think it's important
[57:03] that we see that the that the time is
[57:07] right now I don't know if you've had the
[57:10] opportunity yet to go but I thought I
[57:14] would just turn over in and read this I
[57:21] believe it's in it's from Psalms 37 I
[57:27] don't know if I have the the exact the
[57:29] verse but it's on the our song
[57:32] of the week and anyway it says if you go
[57:39] back and read it it talks about how that
[57:41] the Lord that the Lord will be our
[57:45] portion that if and I think the link is
[57:48] Christian life Psalms dot blog spot.com
[57:54] I don't know what a blogspot is but
[57:57] anyway I think that you can go there and
[58:00] press on that and it talks about bread
[58:03] and brother Mike's talking in this he's
[58:06] talking about how people have started
[58:09] making bread like they've never made
[58:11] bread before they've rediscovered making
[58:15] bread you notice something that I've
[58:18] noticed even around my neighborhood
[58:20] family sitting together outside kids
[58:24] playing in the street riding their
[58:27] bicycles things that used to be be
[58:31] common and can now we're coming into a
[58:34] time that that we understand that the
[58:38] Word of God tells us that the righteous
[58:40] will not bake bread but the Lord will
[58:46] supply our need so we don't have to beg
[58:51] a voice you understand when I say when I
[58:56] beg 'voice we don't have to find
[58:58] somebody to listen to somebody we can
[59:01] put our confidence in somebody who will
[59:04] take care of us he's still Jehovah Jireh
[59:07] Amen the Lord our God will supply us as
[59:11] a sacrifice he's still our provider he's
[59:15] still the one I think it's so amazing
[59:18] that what a a preview you know we never
[59:24] recognize how things come to pass but
[59:27] this is a plague a pandemic which is a
[59:32] plague you know you don't want a say
[59:36] plague because it becomes a biblical
[59:39] proportions well we're in a biblical
[59:43] proportion spiritual
[59:47] Kancil but you just it shows you when a
[59:52] plague comes it's not anything like we
[59:55] have imagined in our mind here goes man
[59:58] and man it's gonna look the voices start
[1:00:03] coming out and what are they going to do
[1:00:05] they're just going to throw money at it
[1:00:08] and throw money at it throw billions of
[1:00:11] dollars the first hundred billion don't
[1:00:14] work we'll send another hundred billion
[1:00:16] and there's all these people on the news
[1:00:19] saying go get the money from the
[1:00:21] government go get the money from the
[1:00:23] government from yourself run from your
[1:00:26] children people they don't know how a
[1:00:32] way to go it's the condition is ripe for
[1:00:40] voices if man is set up to where they
[1:00:47] were looking to hear something they're
[1:00:49] there they're listening to what they
[1:00:53] want to hear amen
[1:00:55] but we know that there's been a voice
[1:00:59] provided something that we can stay
[1:01:02] tuned I just want to read a few little
[1:01:04] statements because I thought this
[1:01:06] scripture was was just so wonderful in
[1:01:12] in the the scriptures found there that
[1:01:20] it's just very averse into you he that
[1:01:23] entereth not by the door into the
[1:01:26] sheepfold but climbeth up some other way
[1:01:30] the same as a thief and a robber but he
[1:01:33] that entereth in by the door is the
[1:01:36] Shepherd of the sheep and the porter
[1:01:40] openeth and the sheep hear his voice and
[1:01:46] he calleth his own sheep by name and
[1:01:50] leadeth them out amen can help that the
[1:01:54] sheep know his voice now listen to what
[1:01:58] brother Branham said here is
[1:01:59] we just read this what American needs is
[1:02:03] a voice of the prophet of God who could
[1:02:08] stand up and condemn Hollywood and
[1:02:12] condemn these things in the name of
[1:02:15] Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost Church
[1:02:19] will take over too much confusion see
[1:02:24] too many voices of contrasts against it
[1:02:30] too much confusion too many voices so we
[1:02:35] ought to be aware we are now at a time
[1:02:38] that there are going to be a lot of
[1:02:42] voices a lot of voices the church its
[1:02:48] voice each one wants more members the
[1:02:52] Baptist wants it all the Methodist wants
[1:02:57] it all the Presbyterians we all have
[1:03:01] these and the Catholic looks like it's
[1:03:04] going to take it all and they will
[1:03:07] that's exactly the voice of God out of
[1:03:11] this Bible they will rule but the Most
[1:03:15] High God shall finally rule the Saint
[1:03:20] shall take over one day the Bible said
[1:03:25] so they will take over amen that's
[1:03:29] because that's what the voice tells me
[1:03:32] how about it friends buy your way out do
[1:03:38] whatever you want out
[1:03:40] that's exactly if - like when the Lord
[1:03:42] sat there and Satan offered them all
[1:03:44] this stuff to get them out of their
[1:03:47] trouble I'm going to get you out of your
[1:03:49] small business trouble I'm going to get
[1:03:51] you out of your wages trouble I'm going
[1:03:53] to get you out you know many are the
[1:03:55] afflictions of the righteous but the
[1:03:58] Lord delivereth them out of them all
[1:04:02] amen we will take over one day we're
[1:04:07] gonna rule this it's going to be
[1:04:09] designed and remodeled
[1:04:13] just the way we wanted he said I go to
[1:04:17] prepare a place for you amen he said I
[1:04:21] didn't go prepare a place for myself he
[1:04:23] said I go to prepare a place for you
[1:04:25] that where I am you may be also
[1:04:28] if it wasn't true I wouldn't tell you
[1:04:30] but if it's true I will come again and
[1:04:32] receive you that you may be where I am
[1:04:35] also what a what a beautiful promise
[1:04:38] what a voice to have comfort you what a
[1:04:43] voice to be able to trust in what a
[1:04:46] voice to have assurance in what a voice
[1:04:50] you can trust not economic disaster
[1:04:57] because the song told us the righteous
[1:05:01] they won't make bread the Lord will
[1:05:04] supply all our needs now which voice are
[1:05:07] you gonna listen to I like that little
[1:05:10] song we sing is what you believe is what
[1:05:12] you'll be amen this is we just read such
[1:05:17] an awful lot of voices then there are
[1:05:23] the voices of false prophets
[1:05:25] that's a terrible voice amen who calls
[1:05:29] himself a prophet a prophet of course is
[1:05:33] a preacher the modern word prophet
[1:05:38] absolutely means a man that preaches
[1:05:42] under inspiration
[1:05:45] he said now that's an awful voice that's
[1:05:52] an awful voice a man that preaches under
[1:05:55] the inspiration okay and I know I've
[1:05:59] shared it with you this is just for our
[1:06:00] church but how many times have you heard
[1:06:04] me say in my heart don't get caught up
[1:06:07] in the inspiration listen to what's
[1:06:12] being said listen to be what we not how
[1:06:17] it's being said but what is being said
[1:06:20] many times I've expressed this somebody
[1:06:25] will read
[1:06:26] quote out of a message and they'll read
[1:06:30] it with such inspiration they'll place
[1:06:33] it in a certain situation in a certain
[1:06:38] context and and they'll say it with like
[1:06:41] such an anointing and such powerful of
[1:06:45] expressions and everybody will scream
[1:06:49] and shout and wave their hands and start
[1:06:51] running around and everything but you
[1:06:53] sit down in a building and play that
[1:06:55] same exact tape where brother branham
[1:06:59] makes the same statement that they read
[1:07:02] and nobody budges
[1:07:05] not even at hand
[1:07:08] his went up because they heard a voice
[1:07:16] the voice of inspiration
[1:07:20] that's an awful voice I just read it now
[1:07:26] there's a prophet people that's preached
[1:07:28] under inspiration
[1:07:30] that's an awful voice because the
[1:07:34] inspiration he says the modern where
[1:07:37] prophet means a man that preaches under
[1:07:39] inspiration and there's a man who stands
[1:07:42] and calls himself a prophet and denies
[1:07:45] the Word of God and denies the truth of
[1:07:48] God there are so many voices you know
[1:07:55] that's why God gave us the voice of God
[1:07:59] in the last day he gave us an absolute
[1:08:02] he gave us something that we can find
[1:08:05] our hope in and not be moved a man just
[1:08:13] a moment ago anyway he says so many so
[1:08:18] many confused things what so many
[1:08:25] confused things the people get up and
[1:08:30] they don't know the word and they say
[1:08:34] things and maybe it sounds very
[1:08:37] reasonable
[1:08:39] I mean ISM is a very reasonable thing
[1:08:43] everybody the same there's no more
[1:08:48] capitalists they're all coming this did
[1:08:52] you ever stop to think that's a false
[1:08:57] revival a false revival we are at such a
[1:09:08] place where there's so many voices that
[1:09:13] somebody's going to offer a false
[1:09:17] revival what a what a condition what a
[1:09:22] time we're in see we don't want to walk
[1:09:25] into what's coming up in front of us
[1:09:26] blind we don't want to be listening to a
[1:09:32] voice that catches our attention we
[1:09:35] don't want to be tickled by some form of
[1:09:38] inspiration we want to be steadfast that
[1:09:43] we know there's a voice of God my sheep
[1:09:46] know my voice another they will not
[1:09:49] follow the Shepherd goes out before he
[1:09:53] sheep and he knows them by name and they
[1:09:56] know his voice what a fellowship but
[1:10:02] that we're in what a beautiful thing
[1:10:04] he says communism is it's a false
[1:10:07] revival and where did he and where did
[1:10:13] he pattern it all after Jesus says the
[1:10:17] two spirits would be so close it would
[1:10:21] deceive the very elect 'add if possible
[1:10:24] and everything the devil's got is a
[1:10:27] perversion of what God created sin is
[1:10:33] righteousness perverted a lie is the
[1:10:37] truth misrepresented the truth miss
[1:10:46] represented a person can tell you the
[1:10:49] truth and it be a lie
[1:10:53] Wow boy that tells me I need a voice I
[1:11:00] don't just need any voice I need the
[1:11:04] voice of God in the last days I need
[1:11:07] something that's really secure he said
[1:11:12] he says a lie is the truth memory
[1:11:17] adultery is an act that God ordained us
[1:11:21] to perverted all unbelief is the
[1:11:25] perversion of belief do you have to deny
[1:11:29] the truth in order to take the
[1:11:32] perversion see straighten out these
[1:11:36] voices know this to the messenger
[1:11:41] talking does so he's telling us
[1:11:43] something straightened out these voices
[1:11:47] did these voices straight in your life
[1:11:52] recognize them understand that their
[1:11:55] voices straighten out these voices
[1:11:58] because you can't let these voices start
[1:12:01] influencing your thinking you can't let
[1:12:03] them create fear in your heart about the
[1:12:06] economy you can't let them create fear
[1:12:08] in your heart about life they can't
[1:12:11] create fear in your heart what you're
[1:12:13] gonna do tomorrow
[1:12:14] you know what the bride's going to do
[1:12:16] tomorrow exactly what God's foreordained
[1:12:19] them to do because the footsteps of the
[1:12:21] righteous are ordered by the Lord what's
[1:12:27] what we're going to do we're going to
[1:12:32] follow after him we're going to stay in
[1:12:36] the truth well we're not going to be
[1:12:41] moved so he's telling us we need to
[1:12:44] straighten out these voices in our lives
[1:12:47] don't let people start putting fear in
[1:12:49] your heart don't let people start trying
[1:12:52] to describe to you what the future is
[1:12:54] going to be they don't know what the
[1:12:56] future is going to be they say it's
[1:12:58] going to recover I don't care if it
[1:13:00] recovers or not somebody's got hold of
[1:13:03] me I'm in the palms of someone's that I
[1:13:06] can't be plucked out of a myth III don't
[1:13:10] fear though I walk through the valley of
[1:13:12] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[1:13:15] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[1:13:19] ok the Shepherd goes before us he
[1:13:24] promised he would he says and he knows
[1:13:28] us by name and they hear my voice and
[1:13:33] the voice of a stranger they will not
[1:13:36] follow it can yet he warns us that this
[1:13:40] is the time the conditions right it's
[1:13:43] rising up we see it everywhere voice
[1:13:46] after voice after voice after voice and
[1:13:49] nobody in agreement if I'm not mistaken
[1:13:53] that's what confusion is straighten out
[1:13:59] these voices test them by the word and
[1:14:03] see if it's true oh how we could go on
[1:14:08] and on on these voices of today but our
[1:14:14] time has passed but so many voices that
[1:14:17] people don't know what to do so many
[1:14:23] voices the people don't know what to do
[1:14:26] we know what to do pray and read our
[1:14:31] Bible every day those who wait upon the
[1:14:36] Lord shall renew their strength it came
[1:14:39] in like I said this morning amen we're
[1:14:42] fellowshipping in place not sheltering
[1:14:46] in place we're not hiding we're not
[1:14:48] hiding in our homes we're hiding in the
[1:14:51] cleft of the rock hey man it so he says
[1:14:59] so many voices so many voices the people
[1:15:02] don't know what to do the Methodists
[1:15:04] look will finally hear a Baptist
[1:15:06] preacher and they'll go over there and
[1:15:10] they'll say they're a while and then
[1:15:13] they'll go to the Lutheran and the
[1:15:15] Pentecostals they have a different group
[1:15:18] and one will run to
[1:15:20] one and one to the other and back and
[1:15:23] forth it shows you you're not stable
[1:15:29] hear his voice here it is wrote on paper
[1:15:38] the voice the voice will be confirmed if
[1:15:42] it's the truth Amen what a what a
[1:15:47] beautiful thing another word when these
[1:15:52] voices are moving your emotions they're
[1:15:55] moving your thoughts they're creating
[1:15:58] confusion they're creating suspicions
[1:16:02] they're creating wonderment I don't know
[1:16:07] if I'll have a job I don't know if I'll
[1:16:08] be able to pay my rent what David gets
[1:16:13] that bad will turn these pews together
[1:16:17] and we'll make beds we'll get a barbecue
[1:16:22] and we'll take care of one another we'll
[1:16:26] feed one another we'll do what we can
[1:16:29] hey man but we will survive because if
[1:16:33] God be for us who can be against us it
[1:16:39] shows when these voices and this is I'm
[1:16:43] telling you this is the age the seasons
[1:16:46] ripe it's a time through voice after
[1:16:50] voice after voice to start pouring in
[1:16:55] well I'm sure that everybody out there's
[1:16:59] got the answer can I tell you nobody out
[1:17:03] there's got the answer Jesus says I am
[1:17:07] the way the truth the life no man comes
[1:17:10] unto the father but by me
[1:17:14] so it shows you're not a stable and so
[1:17:22] how do you get stable here his boys you
[1:17:31] know what they here means
[1:17:33] that doesn't mean just dip the tape in
[1:17:35] your ear go about doing everything so
[1:17:38] it's just like background music it means
[1:17:41] sit down like we talked about this
[1:17:44] morning take this opportunity that he's
[1:17:47] placed us in put on the Word of God
[1:17:50] because this is the voice of God to us
[1:17:53] in this generation the voice of Malachi
[1:17:56] 4:5 that's been promised the voice
[1:17:59] that's got the message to turn our
[1:18:01] hearts back sit back and listen and hear
[1:18:05] the voice another one's here means to
[1:18:07] understand here means to receive
[1:18:10] revelation here means to have somebody
[1:18:12] speak to you and reestablish the
[1:18:15] leadership of the Holy Spirit in your
[1:18:18] life not go on what you think is
[1:18:21] leadership what you think is emotion or
[1:18:28] hope or stimulation but have a steadfast
[1:18:34] revelation and understanding this is the
[1:18:38] voice of God in the last days you have
[1:18:43] got to come to a place either brother
[1:18:45] brems of false prophet or he is the
[1:18:48] prophet because he said I am the voice
[1:18:52] of God to you I know you resent that but
[1:18:58] I am the voice of God to you that's
[1:19:02] either false or it's true and the
[1:19:06] question is you will not be able to halt
[1:19:10] between two opinions very long it will
[1:19:16] manifest when you no longer are sure
[1:19:22] it's the voice of God if if someone
[1:19:28] could get you to doubt and create a
[1:19:33] confusion then you've left that voice
[1:19:36] for another voice all on that voice will
[1:19:41] sound good to you for a while but pretty
[1:19:44] soon you'll find that you've drifted
[1:19:45] farther far
[1:19:46] they're from the truth and it won't be
[1:19:48] long that you'll be leaning on your own
[1:19:51] understanding providing your own
[1:19:54] protection
[1:19:56] providing your own future providing your
[1:20:00] own plan for survival why do I want to
[1:20:03] take my plan for survival when God's got
[1:20:06] a plan of survival for me if I could get
[1:20:11] in union with this Holy Spirit if I
[1:20:13] think it under the power because the
[1:20:16] scripture says you can say to this
[1:20:17] mountain didn't be moved you can say to
[1:20:19] this plant be plucked up can you imagine
[1:20:22] if I had the faith not a faith but the
[1:20:25] faith restored in me and my heart turned
[1:20:29] on God that the works that I do he said
[1:20:32] you shall do also what greater thing do
[1:20:36] I need in my life other than him but you
[1:20:45] gotta straighten out the voices you've
[1:20:48] got to become stable a stranger they
[1:20:54] will not follow they're not going to
[1:20:58] follow a stranger they know they're
[1:21:01] stable they're stable sheep okay he's a
[1:21:06] it's his hear his voice and he goes on
[1:21:12] he says you know many people I thought
[1:21:18] this was thing he says the church world
[1:21:21] don't know what to do the political
[1:21:25] world is in chaos you know I know the
[1:21:30] church world don't know what to do they
[1:21:32] don't know what to do with this idea of
[1:21:34] everything's being shut down you know
[1:21:38] we're just still having church you know
[1:21:42] what I mean the congregation is shrunk
[1:21:43] but hope we got a promise wherever two
[1:21:47] or three are gathered there I'll be
[1:21:49] there so we know he's here and we know
[1:21:52] you out there are listening and you know
[1:21:56] some people think well it's not the same
[1:21:59] online you can pull online if that's
[1:22:03] what God forbade it too you can sit
[1:22:05] right there this evening sitting there
[1:22:08] watching this old bald-headed great
[1:22:10] bearded man redo you what the prophet of
[1:22:13] God said and the Holy Spirit came
[1:22:16] quicken and give revelation because if
[1:22:20] the Holy Spirit doesn't sit between the
[1:22:22] ear of the hear and the mouth of the
[1:22:25] speaker quickening the word and making
[1:22:28] it a life we're dead and there's if it's
[1:22:32] here then its atmosphere you're feeding
[1:22:35] on and not word but the words the truth
[1:22:44] no matter where you are it's true in a
[1:22:48] prison cell it's true at a funeral it's
[1:22:53] true at a wedding it's true in the
[1:22:56] hospital it's true no matter where
[1:22:59] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[1:23:02] word will not pass away he said they
[1:23:07] don't know everything seems to be in
[1:23:09] chaos would anybody agree with me that
[1:23:15] this is one of the most chaotic times
[1:23:18] it's the most chaotic time ever seen my
[1:23:21] life okay and I was around in the 60s
[1:23:25] when the civil rights movement was going
[1:23:27] on I was around in the Vietnam War time
[1:23:31] when the Vietnam War was going on I've
[1:23:34] never seen any one thing affect so many
[1:23:37] people and put so many people into chaos
[1:23:41] as the chaos were in now everything
[1:23:45] seems to be in chaos fellows running
[1:23:49] from here someone else rising up some
[1:23:54] jacket some coat when I was in Rome they
[1:24:00] got 19 different vindicated nails that
[1:24:04] was drove in Jesus hands 19
[1:24:12] indicated yes and there's only three but
[1:24:21] yet they've got the record that 19
[1:24:26] different nails now what difference does
[1:24:30] it make who has the nail Christ never
[1:24:37] left us nails to worship Him he left us
[1:24:41] the Holy Spirit by his words these signs
[1:24:46] shall follow them that believe they will
[1:24:50] have I love this Jesus Christ never left
[1:24:56] us nails to worship Him he left us the
[1:24:59] Holy Spirit by his words these signs
[1:25:03] shall follow them that believe they'll
[1:25:06] have the original nail hey man who's got
[1:25:12] the nail you know who's got the result
[1:25:15] of Calvary who's got the that what the
[1:25:17] nails really were they're working or the
[1:25:20] Holy Spirit on the believer amen these
[1:25:25] signs show that's the original nail
[1:25:27] these signs shall follow them that
[1:25:29] believe they'll belong to a denomination
[1:25:32] I started he started none see how the
[1:25:36] voice is contrary
[1:25:38] oh my I'm telling it he gave us a voice
[1:25:47] he gave us a voice four times like these
[1:25:52] that's a song that that I think the
[1:25:56] first time I ever heard it was by George
[1:25:58] Beverly Shea in times like these we need
[1:26:02] a Savior in times like these we need the
[1:26:06] voice of God 19 different nails amen but
[1:26:15] these signs shall follow them that
[1:26:17] believe in my name they shall cast out
[1:26:20] devils there's the word they shall speak
[1:26:24] with new tongues
[1:26:25] take up serpents that would not harm
[1:26:28] them if they drink deadly things it
[1:26:31] would not bother them if they lay hands
[1:26:34] on the sick they shall recover and you
[1:26:38] watch these things plus all the rest of
[1:26:41] the scriptures put together now this is
[1:26:45] what we ought to be contending for that
[1:26:48] kind of faith that kind of assurance now
[1:26:53] that only will confirm it not at all
[1:26:57] there there's where we Pentecostals get
[1:27:03] on the wrong road did Jesus say many
[1:27:07] will come to me in that day and say Lord
[1:27:10] have I not done mighty things in your
[1:27:14] name
[1:27:14] have I not prophesied in your name have
[1:27:17] I not done all these things in your name
[1:27:20] and Jesus said depart from me you
[1:27:23] workers of iniquity I never knew you do
[1:27:26] you see my brothers and sisters my
[1:27:29] brothers why I'm so condemning and
[1:27:33] indicted this generation you might speak
[1:27:37] with tongues like men and angels you
[1:27:39] might dance in the spirit all around the
[1:27:42] church that has nothing to do with it
[1:27:45] I've seen mohammedans dance around like
[1:27:48] that I've heard the doctors witch
[1:27:52] doctors camps in seeing witches stand up
[1:27:55] and speak in tongues and interpret it
[1:27:58] and tell exactly what's going to happen
[1:28:02] and it happened that way I've seen
[1:28:05] pencils rise up and write in unknown
[1:28:09] tongues and only one there could read it
[1:28:13] and was the devil you can't base your
[1:28:16] eternal destination upon some sensation
[1:28:20] Satan can impersonate any of those
[1:28:24] sensations if to know Christ
[1:28:30] something's changes in your life watch
[1:28:35] your life and pattern it with
[1:28:39] the word see see where you're at
[1:28:43] take inventory certainly and that what
[1:28:51] we're talking about taking inventory
[1:28:55] yeah am I in tune with the voice do I
[1:29:00] understand that there's a voice that's
[1:29:04] been sent
[1:29:05] no man is never the same you may hear in
[1:29:11] your ears
[1:29:12] a voice speaking but when you hear in
[1:29:16] your heart the voice speaking see then
[1:29:20] you're hearing you do not see with your
[1:29:25] eyes you look with your eyes and you see
[1:29:32] with your heart you see something I just
[1:29:37] don't see it you mean you don't
[1:29:41] understand it you do not hear it with
[1:29:46] your ears you hear it with your heart
[1:29:49] many times your ears here's the true
[1:29:52] voice of God and it falls off of you
[1:29:55] like water off the duck's back but when
[1:29:59] you really hear you hear with your heart
[1:30:04] and that's the beautiful thing that the
[1:30:10] voice of God does it comes and it turns
