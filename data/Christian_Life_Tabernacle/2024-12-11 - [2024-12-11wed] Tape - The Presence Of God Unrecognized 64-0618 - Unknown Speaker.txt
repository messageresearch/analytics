just come and pray for the needs and then give you a testimony tonight amen man after that the brothers that are taking the offerings if you can [Music] come praise the Lord I wanted to give a a short testimony tonight about uh the goodness of God and and how good he's been um I won't go into a lot of details because I I want you to think that I'm a really nice person um um over the last six years um how I got here uh I was at brother I I attended brother Bill's ivish church and uh and the youth would come up every year for the uh the camp meeting and I I met a guy in the parking lot and we we begin to talk and fellowship and he said something to me and I can't tell you what he said but he said something to me and we shook hands and left I don't know his name I don't know his face I've been looking for him ever since I've been here I guess he doesn't go here anymore but anyway um I went back to work and I started praying I started praying about uh just coming here and I and I told the Lord I said um well send a witness so uh so I went about my job and and and God sent a witness uh my good friend who's not saved at the job uh you know uh we were working one day in the warehouse and she said well Jer why don't you bid on that job in Dallas and I could have fell out on the floor and um and I felt that that was God and that's all that I needed so I began to uh go through the process of of trying to come here and I I beid it on that job and I for a year and a half they kept turning me down I was over qualified for the job they just wouldn't give it to me for some reason I just didn't like me or something about me uh if you spend time with me you may get that way too but anyway um um so I went to work one day and I decided to quit and I decided to retire I saidwell I'm not going to I'm not coming here so I'll just retire and so you know I got a coffee in my hand and I I just decided to quit so I called my boss and I told him I'mma slide my ID under your door and I'mma quit today my last day turning in my retirement papers cuz I'm old enough to retire and I'm just going to hunt and fish every day so I did that and I got in my car in the middle of the day and I left and I was on my way home well on the way home my boss called me and he said what are you doing I said I'm retiring I I had enough of fedexes and I'm I'm just going to you know do it anyway he refused to take my um retirement and which I didn't understand so I quit my job and before I got home home I had my job back he made a phone call to the hiring manager here and she said um he called me back and said you still want that job is yours I don't know what he told her uh but anyway she gave me the job and that led the process for me coming here uh in the process now you got to think that I'm really dumb because I I I transferred in the middle of Co that was really bright right and so anyway so in in the mid of coming here I I uh uh I got covid really bad and and I'm over I'm over the age you know they said on the television you know if you're over 60 don't even come to the we're crosing everybody so you don't even need to come to the hospital so I'm at home dying because I can't go to the emergency room and and um it got really bad and it got so bad that I I literally thought I was going to die so at that particular day I decided Well uh I'm going to die at work you know what I'm saying because no no no no no I'm thinking right so I go to work because see you there's Double Indemnity if I if I die on the job they'll pay me double my life and so that would take care of my family right so I don't know how I made it to work now they have this little thing you know where they uh do your temperature when you come in I'm sick I'm sick I don't know how I got to the job I don't know how I got to streaming but anyway they put this little thing on my head and it's green they let me in I'm knowing a going to turn me around right so it's green so I go to work I go in the job and then I go back in the warehouse in a quiet place and I pray and I said Lord U they're going to find me back here you know so I lifted my hands up to God and I did the sentence prayer to make sure I was okay and and and uh at that particular point I was so weak I couldn't even stand up and I was starting to fall and I figured I was just going to fall fall on the floor and somebody would find me eventually now before I hit the floor I got strength I don't know where it came from I went down and I came back up I looked around I said well I guess God don't want me either so uh I went on back to work so that was the end I'm I'm feeling good I'm eating you know I I can't remember I remember walking in my dog and I was so weak that I just laid on the ground I'm sitting there holding the lease I'm looking up and the dog is licking me and he's just walking all around but I couldn't even get up because I was just that was where I was but anyway to make a long story short and I'm I'm trying to make it short um I ended up here and and me and my boss we don't get along at all and so I couldn't come to Wednesday nights because uh I'm the low man on the totem pole so I have to everybody bids and whatever they have left but that's what I get so I could never be able to come to church on Wednesday night because that so for the last four years I haven't been here and but miraculously in the last six months God has moved three people for one reason or another another and I'm here on Wednesday night because that's my schedule I'm off on Wednesday night and I thank and praise God I don't know what God is doing I know why I'm here and I can't tell you that um but I know God is going to do it because I've gone through so many obstacles in order to be here and the most important thing that that I can share with you is the importance of family if you I have a son that has taught me how to pray I only have one kid and I thank God he didn't give me more than one because Jasper is um um he's my best friend and he's my biggest enemy and and then I don't understand people that have children and their hearts AR burdened for their children the children are out there doing whatever they doing it and they seem to be content and there's no burden or there's no passion in your heart for your children that you brought into this world but my greatest desire is to see uh uh God do something for the Clayton family uh and for some reason he's going to do it here and I don't understand that but just like Abraham sometimes God has to take you away from your family and bring you to a place that you don't know anybody you know cuz I first met with Brother David I told him I've never heard you preach I'm sorry I've never seen your church I just met one of your members and they said something that kind of pricked me in my heart and based on the testimony uh I'm here but so when you hear me praying crying out for Jasper uh he's the love of my life um U and I don't want to leave here until Jasper's okay you know I can't leave here till he's okay and if you have children you should be the same way you shouldn't want to go to heaven and leave your children in a mess cuz my my boy's in a mess but I but he's mine he's my mess and I thank and praise God for it let's look to God In Prayer Heavenly Father we we come Lord God tonight in the precious name of Jesus always Lord God we're reaching out to families Lord God Jesus Lord God we have children Lord God that don't know you and the pardon of their sins Lord God there are none another mouth to feed but you have given us a soul to lead Lord Lord God and I pray and ask in the name of Jesus that you would continue to minister and move by your Mighty power Lord God Heavenly Father we praise you and we magnify your name we believe that this day this hour was ordained by you that it was for a purpose that through our suffering Lord God that someone else might find Hope Lord God as we assemble together with those of light precious Faith Lord God we continue to trust you and praise you and magnify your name we are so grateful and so thankful for your word Lord God how you ministered and moved in such a mighty way we know that you are a Healer and a deliverer Lord God for the brother with cancer Lord God the same God that Lifted Me Up he can lift you up Lord God if only we would believe and Reach Out And Touch the hymn of your God those who are families have been torn apart because because we have not done what we are supposed to do as men oh if we would only confess our faults he is faithful and just to forgive us of our fault and to cleanse us from all righteousness I remember when Cosman was preaching his sermon Lord God of how Lord God being a good Hunter brother briman was but he was lost Lord God so many times we're lost Lord God we we've lost our families and we don't know how to reach out but the Bible says if we would be faithful and just and confess our faults he is faithful and just to cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord God heavenly father I failed as a father Lord God to lead my child to Calvary TR but I pray even now Lord God that you would restore my soul lord God as we lift up our hands to you Lord God reaching for that wine Lord God that lead to home Lord God I pray in the name of Jesus Lord God oh that you would just Reach Out Lord God and meet the needs of our children Lord God all the that have gone astray Lord God bring them back into the fold Lord God father we ask and pray in Jesus name we want want to say we love you Lord

hallelujah amen that's our Firm Foundation that's our way our trust lies amen man we're going to be listening to a tape the Pres presence of God unrecognized Amen we'll start from uh I believe paragraph 6 that's where the text is read and and right after the text is read we'll uh go on and and and sit down amen the brothers if you could just play that amen tonight is the presence of God unrecognized last night we were talking of Jesus being the same yesterday today and forever and see that he was the same yesterday day forever now his presence if he is the same is unrecognized let us read then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered saying Master we would see a sign from thee but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seek after a sign and there shall be no sign given unto it but the sign of the Prophet Jonas for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth the man of Nineveh shall rise in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas is this year and the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it or she came from the uttermost parts of the Earth the year the wisdom of Solomon and behold greater than Solomon is here the unrecognized presence what could these people be thinking of God has always it's been that way every time he comes when Jesus was here the first time he said uh you you whiten and you garnish the walls in the tombs of the prophets and you put them in there see something happens and it passes by and God hides it from the eyes of wise and prudent and reveals it to Bab such as will learn Jesus thanked the father for doing such see it goes right by the people and they don't know it for instance you Catholic people here tonight do you remember a few years ago Jon of Arc in France the little lady that was really she led the Revolutionary in France but she was really a a servant of Christ what did your church do to her burner at the stake as a witch because she seen visions and was spiritual the Catholic church burned her as a witch at the state because she was spiritual in seen Visions a few years afterwards they found out that that woman was a saint so of course you done great Penance you dug up those priest body that condemned her and burned her and thr him into the river of course that you done great pentant for that for digging up this priest's body now in the days of the prophets what happened they did the same thing they didn't recognize them till they had done come Ministry had finished took out of that the elected and then after they were gone they recogniz that they had been a prophet among them Jesus he came to the Earth that endowed within him was the father God I am my father a one my father dwelleth in me it's not me that doeth the works but my father and if I do not the works of my father believe me not now if you notice when he came about one one 90th of the world knew that he is even on Earth Earth at that time and yet the savior of the world and then they never recognized who he was even the church or no one else heart until they crucified him buried and rose on the third day before they ever knowed who he was it comes in and goes out and people does not recognize it until it's passed and they because that it never fits their theology it never fits the time of the day you see what it is they're always living in a glare of another age always the reason they didn't accept Jesus because they were living in the glare of the law and when Jesus came was not contrary to the law but come to fulfill the law well they couldn't accept him because his message wasn't exactly the way they had it all created out and it was called then traditions and they he didn't come according to the Traditions he didn't keep their traditions and really he up set it and tore it up and and done things that was contrary to it in so much as they thought he was breaking up the churches and they couldn't receive him because of his message and we all know today that he come exactly in the line of God's prophecy amen but they didn't know it then and it could happen again and we wouldn't know it I imagine if he had actually appeared tonight it would be so contrary to what we got all figured up on our charts and in our schools and things that be very few would recognize what was going on he said it would be how he come now Jesus being there so scripturally identified by the scriptures and the scribes and Pharisees of that day could not recognize him why didn't they why didn't they do it because they had it figured out some other way that's where Jesus told him search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me see now he come exactly with the scriptures but they had to figured out maybe that if he would come uh uh the Messiah would probably do what Moses did or what an Noah did Bill him an arc or something else but we reason he come the way he did they hadn't figured out in the scriptures with their traditions did not teach them so the people were so confused they didn't know what was going on wonder if that could happen today I wonder if it could be different than what our Traditions has taught us and it could come and something had passed through and we never even know until it's already passed and then it's over that's just about the way it'll come do you know when John the Baptist came on the scene that have been predicted all the way from the book of Isaiah hundreds of years about 800 years Isaiah prophesied a think before the coming of Christ did you know John came exactly the way Isaiah said he would come he come exactly the way Malachi said he would come and even the apostles didn't recognize it one day in Matthew 11 John was in prison and the apostles uh some of his disciples went over to ask Jesus was he the one or or should they look for another now notice Jesus did not uh give them a book of how to behave themselves how to behave himself in jail or how to conduct his character he said stay around and watch what happens and go show John the things that you seen happened that was the evidence that the he was that word and I remember the word always comes to a prophet we all know that God does nothing without showing it to His prophets that's the reason the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ is the full fullness of Christ right here before it's the book now he'll have to send one someone to confirm that book reveal it open the seals and so forth but as far as any farther revelation of Christ is already recognized right here he's the fullness of this of the Revelation I know no never does it fail but the word comes to the prophet look at John standing in the water predicting the prophet that the Messiah was right then among them he said there's one standing among you now that you don't know he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire now remember he was standing right among them the Bible said so and they didn't recognize it one day when Jesus came walking down John recognized him he said Behold the Lamb of God the takes away the sin of the world now watch before he was recognized by anybody he came to the prophet he was the word John was a prophet I remember my old Baptist teacher told me said you know what happened said Jesus baptized John I said I don't think so he said sure John was never baptized he come preaching baptizing nobody was worthy to baptize him Jesus baptized him I said I don't know him one day while in studyed the Holy Spirit revealed it like this see watch he walked out of the water he said why comest thou unto me I have need to be baptized to thee Jesus said suffer that to be so watch but thus it is becoming to us behooving us that we fulfill all righteousness John being a prophet knowing the word the sacrifice he was must be washed before presented then he was baptized John baptized him because it's becoming to us that we fulfill all righteousness yes the word came to the prophet in the water and then when he was baptized still the people and the Holy Spirit came down not everybody saw it John saw it the angel of the Lord can be right here tonight and maybe one person see it no one else that light that star that come over every Observatory where they the wise man followed no Observatory knows anything about it no one else saw it at all but those wise men because it was far them to see it amen they saw it it was real to them when the light the pillar of fire smokee Paul down on the road to Damascus he recognized that he was in the presence of God now that Hebrew would have never called any other Spirit Lord besides he know it that was the same Pillar of Fire that led his people out of the Wilderness he said Lord who are you Saul Saul while persecutest thou me he said I'm Jesus Jesus said I come from God and I return to God he was that that fire that was in the burning bush that led Moses through the Wilderness and he returned back to that and now here he was on the road down to Damascus it was stricken down and all the man was with him they never saw that pillar of far and it was so so real to Paul to put his eyes out and he had to be led down to the street called straight in Damascus he was blind ananas a prophet down there saw in a vision went laid hands on him and he received the Holy Ghost and the scales fell from his eyes and he could see again it was so real to him to put his eyes out and yet none of the rest of them recognized it being there could see it so so is it tonight there's somebody sitting right there can bring God on the scene when the other don't know nothing about it amen recognizing God Jesus when he was here on Earth and had fully perform the sign that the Bible said that he would do but they didn't recognize it because it wasn't according to their tradition for that age he wasn't to come and do what Moses did he was to come and be born of a virgin and he according to Deuteronomy 18:15 he was to be a prophet and exactly he did those works and signs the Jews always sought signs they were taught to never to depend on intellectual speeches the Jews know better than than that the Greeks taught that but not intellectual speeches but upon signs show us a sign these people want said Rabbi or master show us a sign they want to know and he had already showed them the sign and they wanted a different kind of sign but he could only do the sign of that age so does he today this pouring out of the Holy Ghost is a sign of his appearing amen even in this age as he promised they want a sign and he had given the scriptural sign but they wanted a different sign that's where so many people today is going to be confused you know the Rapture might take place and just think of the sadness of it let me go back to word Jesus or John sent his disciples over to see Jesus if he was the Messiah or not that hour he done many things when he returned back the disciples to tell John what they had seen Jesus Jesus said to those sitting there said what went you out to see in the wilderness what went you out to see when John was preaching did you go out and see a man clothed in white Raymond and so forth or or soft raymen said they are the in King's palaces they bury the dead and kiss the babies and marry the young and so forth that they don't know the handling of a two-handed sword said what did you go out to see then a reed shaking with any wind somebody some group will offer him a little more money and he'll go over to this one and instead of going in the calling of the Lord not John somebody could twist him around and say we'll give you more if you'll uh deny this and take this not John he said what did you go out to see than a prophet he said I say unto you more than a prophet and if you can receive it this is who who the prophet said behold I send my messenger before my face which will prepare the way and that was Malachi 3 where he did it one day the disciples asked and said why did the scribes say that Elias must first come Jesus said he's already coming you didn't know it and they understood that it was John the Baptist those elected Apostles still couldn't see who he was that was the Elijah amen now look you know the the coming of the Lord is going to be a secret coming he said there'll be two in the bed and I'll take one and leave one that's where the the night is two in a field I'll take one and leave on you know there's so many people disappear every day off the face of the Earth and nobody can account for one of these days it might be that people might say well you mean the tribulation of things on us now I thought the church used to go before the tribulation they don't realize and understand that the Rapture could take place and they know nothing about it it's a secret going of the church amen and think people go right on preaching saying they believe they're getting saved and adding in the church and building churches and going on just like they did in the days of Noah and so forth and not know it and the rapture done past it's already happened and you didn't know it there hundreds of people disappear from the earth and people know nothing about where they went through they can't account for it somebody was going somewhere they never hear from them no more and that could be the Rapture I tell you friends just because that we are members of the church or something like that that doesn't mean too much to us you better buckle up that armor amen you better take that whole word of God and hold on to it and quit this Hollywood acting around here it's got right into the church and it's a shame but Hollywood glows just makes a bright light and the church today is trying to compare with Hollywood Christ is not in Hollywood Christ is in the individual Hollywood glow Hollywood glares while the gospel glows with humility God in in these great fine fancy places and all this stuff that we see he comes in in humility in form of meekness and gentleness pass right through and if you're acquainted with the word you'll see it he that has an eye to hear Let Him hear what the spirit sayth to the churches thing now now today which was identified he identified himself properly to the Believers that they them who were looking for it look at Peter and Andrew look at Nathaniel no question in his mind look at the woman at the well there was no question but these Pharisees a few days before where our textes tonight saw him do that and then called him be Alba a devil The Works have been done they had to answer their congregation so the only thing they could do would call it a evil spirit be elah was a devil like a fortune teller or something and anyone knows that fortune telling is of the devil and they was comparing where he was the word that know the secret of the heart and and proving he was that Prophet that was to be raised up to us in this day the Redeemer prophet and when he did that the church in that day declared him to be be elub you see what he was he said you're blind leading the blind amen they won't come in neither will they let them it's under him come in what we want to do today is find out the truth we've got to know the truth is he the same is he here fulfill what he promised to fulfill amen search the scriptures and find what he's supposed to do today that's the reason that John Wesley or Martin Luther couldn't go on with Wesley's message they organized it that's as far as he could go along come Luther out a Catholic church and he they is a crank to them but he had the message of justification because it was a word of God a promise then they after his death they organized the Luther organization then what happened it got all cuddled up again and according to the scripture there's got to be another church age raise and when it did the Philadelphia Church age raise John Wesley what it happened kept coming Westward all the time and when it happened there was the church age and John Wesley raised up but Luther could not receive it because his already organized to justification he could not accept sanctification then when the wesle organized the way they did and the little branches went off which did Along come the Pentecost message of the restoration of the gifts none of them can move there's already organized now the pitiful part of it is the Pentecostal so organized look at the day we're living in what's promised for this day where are we we've moved on up the pillar of fire moves and the children of Israel move with the pillar of fire or they went back to Egypt we've got to move with the word and today we're getting so slothful the church is getting so whirly and so indifferent and so their mind so muddled up with television and we love Susi and some of these old things and staying home that shows where the people's hearts are you can tell them these things are wrong and they think you're crazy what is it lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God oh the greatest pleasure I know of is to be to pray until I can realize that I'm in the presence of God and recognize it I think that ought to be the thrill of the church is the presence of the Holy Spirit seeing the god that made the promise standing among us feel his presence and see his word and see it Vindicated it ought to give Faith to make cripples walk blind see death here dumb [Music] speak I stood in South Africa where had some 200,000 people at the Durban Racetrack and when they seen one time that happened like that after explained it to them just a little a mile farm and they seen one thing take place of that revealed and 25,000 people was instantly healed at once they had taken seven van loads trucks as long as mere six and 18 wheelers like that and piled them full of old crutches and things heathens that didn't know which is right and left hand the next day Mr Sydney Smith the mayor of Durban called me and said go to your window out towards the Indian Ocean you'll see something you never seen there was the police escort coming down with seven of those big b loads with hundreds of people walking behind it the day before was in the stretchers and Cs and carriers that they had singing only believe all things are possible a week before that they were in war with one another native war and there they was walking arm in arm hand in hand hallah why they recognize the god of Heaven had appeared before them in the form of his word we inter lectual Americans set they'll raise in the day of the judgment and condemn this generation for what we've seen reminds me of a woman in Louisville Kentucky not long ago had a little baby walking around in the 10 cent store and she was doing little things trying to get it to notice a little baby kept staring straight out and finally she picked up a little bell anything that would ought to track the atten of a little fell about that size and she shook the Bell and the little fell just stared right straight in front and she begins screaming and fell over and some of the people come to help her she said oh no it can't be it can't be said what's the matter said the doctor said the baby was better said what's the matter with the baby lady said well it took a spell about 6 months ago that just sits and stares no matter what it is ought to attract attention of that baby it won't attract its attention it just set some stairs the doctor told me he thought it was better and I brought it down here to pick up little gadgets that ought to attract that child and it doesn't he still sits and stares that's the way the church is getting yes God shook every promise in the Bible before them still we just sat and stare looking what show me his time and it's going on all the time right around us bringing the presence of God it ought to illuminate us God made a promise he stands by that promise yes sir after Jesus had so proven his Messiah sign that he was that Messiah yet face of all that show us a sign see they didn't recognize they were staring Straight Ahead them it wasn't in them to believe you as my old southern mother used to say you can't get blood out of a turnup because there's none there still didn't recognize him so blinded by their Creeds and and and so forth that they had that they they never knew the scriptures of the promise because the Creeds had covered it up their Creeds and traditions of that day had covered up the scripture promise if they had been taught according to the scripture that that was supposed to be the sign that followed the Messiah how many believe that he come in his right sign sure he did he come according to the promise but they have been taught a Creed we believe in this and we believe in that all of them believe in God all of them the today we Americans especially we think that we're going to be excused because we build big churches and have fine pastors and things remember if that was so God's unjust if he takes us in like that for Cain and Abel the two first worshippers outside of Eden they built an altar to the Lord both of them made sacrifice both of them offered gifts both of them prayed but one was right and the other was wrong notice we must have the truth and the truth is God's word all always now the same today people become so blinded to say I say are you are you a Christian or I belong to certain certain things see that don't have nothing to do with it I ain't got nothing against that but that's not what I'm trying to tell you belong to any church you want to your brand don't make any difference I was telling a pastor this morning up in Colorado used to ride around up and so forth and I used to sit there with my leg across the saddle like that and the troubles River uh her Association grazes of troubles from River Valley then you got up the top of the valley you got the the East and West F all the cattle from here up and the association grazes the West Fark and and the group that I was with Graz the East Fark then they had the drift fence there to keep the cattle off the private property and up into the mountains to the summer and we'd round the cattle up four or five different brands eight or 10 different brands on the river would round up her cattle in the spring take them up there and I used to sit there my leg across a horn of the satellite we got all the cattle is all branded and everything starting to back up on the pasture and the ranger stood there he was counting them as he went through and I noticed there's all kinds of Brands Mr Grimes had a the uh the the Diamond Bar and just above us had the turkey TR we had the old tripod and his different brands went through there but the the ranger didn't notice the brand he noticed a blood tag in the ear there was nothing could go on that pasture to keep the breeding ass Association they their cattle true to the breed nothing could go on there but a third Brad Herford it had to be tagged in the ear by the blood Mark that's the way it'll be at the Judgment he's not going to ask me if I was a a Methodist Baptist Presbyterian what brand I have won't mean nothing to him it's nothing but a born again bloodborn Christian of the blood of Jesus Christ that'll be what will go in nothing less than that will go in now we want to remember remember that now now when he's not recognized his power is all is always not revealed when he's not recognized no matter how much God standing present you've got to believe it that's all like the woman with the blood issue all them people passing mind all them stand up saying there goes the rabbi that's the guy that claims to be a Prophet this is the fanatic and all such as that but what happened this little woman had an issue of blood and she had heard about him and when she come down there regardless of what anybody said she recognized who he was and she said if I can only touch His Garment see and when that genuine faith in God became a positive thing to her what did it release it released his power to heal her it touched him in such a way he turned around and told her what was wrong with her and said your faith has saved you what did Faith other stand there might been sicker than she but you see she recognized his presence she know that was her opportunity if we could only do that tonight people if we could only realize that he's appearing to us in these meetings for one purpose that's to release our desires that we have in him to us but we've got to recognize his presence and now how you recognize his presence is when the promised word for this age is made manifest not the promised word of Moses age or any other ages the promise of the word for this age now we find out he went right on in j a little fell up there with a dead daughter she he believed what he said was the truth now remember he was a priest and he was forbidden because it' been strictly told anybody that associated with him would be put out of the synagogue well whether he was put out or where he wasn't he was satisfied that God was present in Christ and that was the word amen what did it do it released to him the resurrection power that was in him amen forth a girl that was dead and laid out because he recognized that God was in Christ and his presence was in his house but in the city where he was brought up at that same power was ining in the city where he was brought up at but they never recognized him his presence to them didn't mean nothing maybe some fanatic where is these things they tell me that you do so and so let me see you do them here haven't you heard that if there you bunch of Pentecostals and you people if you believe in Divine Healing here's some so over here let me see you heal him that's that same old Evel the same one said if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread the same old devil when he had his eyes covered up he hit him on the head with a stick and said now passor stick one to the other and said tell us who hits you and we'll believe you if you're a prophet you never you don't clown for anybody amen same one when he was on the cross said if thou be the Son of God come off the cross and prove that you're the Son of God he could have done it they paid him the greatest tribute he ever had there but they didn't know it they said he saved others himself he can't save if he would have saved himself he couldn't have saved others he gave himself so he could save others they didn't recognize the presence of God that s now it releases the power to heal and what it'll release the power to open your eyes to recognize him or blind your eyes so you'll never recognize it what opens the eyes of one close the eyes of the unbeliever but the city they didn't have no confidence in him at the Pharisees house he invited him down at Simon a Pharisee and he made a great supper and Pharisee wanted to proed to him he was no Prophet so he was back there toasting with his glasses and his goblets and all the fine perfumes in the house and Jesus had got in past the foot wash flunky and had sat down here and dirty the stink of the the field on him where the animals have been along the path and his garments that's the reason they wash feet in them days and you see the first thing when you're invited to a to a h home there in Palestine when they wore those sandals the first thing they did was to wash your feet and then give you something to walk on their carpets the great Persian rugs and things was beautiful the next thing they done they they give you some in your hand and it it's got out of a little apple it's found way in the mountain a rose Apple after the rose is gone it leavs the apple and fine perfumes and they they rub it over their face and that direct raise of the Palestinian sun is horrible and you see that cre an older and and then when you do then the host comes to the door and he kisses them on the neck and makes him welcome how did them flunkies ever let Jesus get by without washing his feet or or giving him oil to anoint himself or even kiss him welcome but there's a little prostitute out on the street all them religiousness there now the whole company did not recognize him and a little woman of ill Fame she looked in through the perhaps the gate and she seen him sitting like a Wallflower that's the way he is today amongst a bunch of religionist too a Wallflower unwelcome unwanted filth dirty Holy Roller they call him some kind of a a person that is in the right mind a fortune tell or mental telepathy or some kind of an evil name but Jesus I'll get to it in a few minutes said speak a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven you but when the Holy Ghost has come to do the same thing one word will never be forgiven you but there that little woman seing needed service and she rushed in real quickly went and got an albaster box full of oil probably bought it with the money from her prostitution well what was it she might have thought he is a he is a prophet but I remember another woman in my fix or another character like mine she had the opportunity she recognized him and she was forgiven up there at the well of SAR last night we talked of it and if I can only get to him I know who he is I'll do him a service if the rest of them I don't care what they do I'll do him a service I'll recognize he's the son of God she running she got real close to him and she felt so guilty that's a way a real penitent sinner feels in his presence guilty and the tears begin to fall and she trying to hide him it dropped on his feet she was go to anoint him but the tears dropped on his feet and she began to wipe him and and crying and and with her hands and and his feet was all getting mused up with the dirt that was on it and and if you want to really believe it with the stink of the animals off the trail every one walked the same Trail and there it was the stink on him sitting there and her tears was dropped on his feet and she was trying to wipe him off and she had an old towel what is a woman's Beauty and honor is her hair that's the reason many of you women today cut it all off that's wrong she she tuck her hair and begin to wash the his feet and wipe him her the her pretty hair taking the stink off of him upon herself bearing his reproach oh my that's when you recognize who's in your presence our sisters would have to almost stand on their head to get enough hair to do that so we there she washed his feet and wiped him with the hairs of her head and she kissed his feet and there old Simon standing back there said oh I can just see him blow up he didn't recognize who he was said I told you he wasn't a prophet if he was a prophet he' recognize what kind of a woman that is around him Jesus never moved a foot he just watched her and she was scared then after he got through she doing this service to him he looked over said Simon I've got something to say to you you invite ided me here you brought me here in other words a trump up his sleeve you want to show me off you want to prove that I wasn't what I am and you when you brought me here you should have had my feet washed but you never you should give me oil to anoint my head but you didn't you never kiss me welcome and this woman ever since I've been here has washed my feet with her tears and wiped him with a with her hair and constantly has kissed my feet since I've been here I have something against you Simon then he turns to her I can just imagine seeing her stand there in her big pretty eyes all stained up in her face wor that grease and and dust off the road on her face and she thinks now have I done wrong have I done wrong he said and I say unto her her sins which are many are all forgiven amen hallelujah hallelujah God what was it she recognized she recognized her opportunity see she did it she did him a service the Pharisees didn't do it she saw it and she recognized his presence and what did it do it washed what did it release to her forgiveness released to her forgiveness of her sins what did it do also it also released the power of God to show to them unbelievers that he was a prophet he know who she was amen it also released joy and power and eternal life it released that but the one who calls a great huge nail to be droven them precious feet he never recognized the presence of God in him he also wanted to do some cheap trick for him some entertainment that's what the world wants today is a bunch of entertainment don't want the gospel they want to be entertained and S pilate said uh I'd like to desire some miracle from him or something like that bring him up here right in the presence of God and turned it down because what that he appreciated the the opinion of the public more than he appreciated having the opportunity to be in the presence of God what happened the woman was forgiven and given eternal life but he lost his mind and went insan and committed suicide by Drowning himself up in Switzerland now car so carried away with the popular opinion of that day that he was a BL just a make belief it wasn't really nothing to him he what did he do he forfeited it he fored his opportunity in the presence of God he could have been forgiven yes he said I have power to crucify you I have power to release you he said you have no powerless it comes from my father he ought to have known if he had know the scripture and him being a Jew should have known that but you see the Traditions had got him taught down that's way it is today if he had only been taught right if a man had would have believed what the scriptures had said but his tradition got him off of it same as it is today people will take the real gospel where the Holy Ghost is coming in the power and glory of God releasing sinners from sin and making them free and baptizing them in the Holy Ghost and Healing The Sick and showing signs and wonders and people walk away H you know what my church please that's nonsense see you're forfeiting you're selling your birth rights amen another Esau so many get the same opportunity today to stand in his presence as they did then and still because of popular opinion they turn it down standing in the presence of God I wonder friend tonight if we people who are Christians in his presence and are sick if we don't turn down the opportunity to be healed but just believing him will you claim to believe him don't recognize really his presence what he promised to do today Vindicated by the promise for the day Jesus was rebuking that generation for not believing his Messiah sign we see here he was rebuking him calling him a be Ela they wanted him to do the sign of Moses maybe open the Red Sea they did want him to do the sign of David take the throne in the government but the no scripture said that he would do that he was to be a prophet he's coming the kingen he was to be Prophet then and he done the sign that God said he would do in them days and they still was wanting him to do some sign that please them and I just wonder if we're not looking too farward ahead for something that's right by us wonder if it could be the same way if we could pass by our opportunity remember as the old types the types can never break the last sign According To Jesus he said as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the days when the son of man not Son of God now when the son of man is being revealed look at here where it's setting today friends I could tell you some things here it's not right for me to tell you but it would startle you I want to ask you a little question while we stop before we continue on with this service just a few minutes I wonder if I could ask you this anyone knows that the world positionally everything's setting in order for his coming earthquakes in diverse places the moon spitting out red blood or red volcanic all over covering it as Jesus said watch for that sign in the last days see a roar man's heart failing for fear and perplexed of time distress between the Nations look at the perversion on the move today look at it a far 30% increase in California of homosexuals natural affections already lost amen amen if the musician could come and what a sobering thought then am is right by yes and we don't see it because the expectation is different because they're not looking for him according to the promise that he's made you know I love it how that he starts in from the beginning it will even tell you how even those that were the very elected one they missed it but the word always comes to the prophet so if you want to that's why when they ask Jesus a question he send them back to John he said go tell John all that you saw and everything and then come back with the conclusion why but bam says the word always comes to the prophet first if you want to know what God wants for your life what God wants to do what's happening in your time consult the prophet of your day because that's God's way of doing things and I love this when he said that the word always comes to the prophet and not only that that he only comes to those that are looking for him that's why we we we just can't play church we just can't come and and just say it's another Wednesday but is our heart beating for something are we looking are we in expectation to see God do something in our lives are we in expectation to see the promises that we've been made the promise of the Rapture remember he just said here not long ago he said there'll be those that are going to miss it they will come to church thinking they're being saved thinking everything is going on because it would happen and they wouldn't even know it why because they didn't understand what the coming was all about they didn't understand what the promise of their time was and they failed to realize because they failed to realize then when the promise is made known they couldn't see the Promise coming but those that were under the expectation those that received the whole word of God says it brought healing it brought Deliverance it brought peace it brought everything that we have need of if we can only receive him and the promise that he's made us he promised to give us everything that we have need of Amen let's all stand amen see bless it Assurance oh Jesus is oh what oh T of Glory oh

of God right he said he would keep us amen and I believe that God said that he would go before us in everything that we said and do when we go in his name and so I just was thinking as I was fellowshipping with the man on the job uh just before I came to church today you know it's been told us that if you would give someone at least a drink of water that could be something that can be reckoned to them what about a presence that is in each one of us we don't want to let that go unrecognized in our lives in our difficulties in the different things that we go through let's not fail to recognize that Christ is in you and there's people pulling dividends from the inside amen let's let's take our opportunity let's embrace it and let's watch God move amen I love it how it brought
