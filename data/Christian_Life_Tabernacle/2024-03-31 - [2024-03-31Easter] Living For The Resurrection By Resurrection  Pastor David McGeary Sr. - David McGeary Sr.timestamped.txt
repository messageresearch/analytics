[12:52] preeminence we pray in Jesus name amen
[12:56] let's go ahead and be
[12:58] seated
[13:00] happy
[13:02] Easter there is therefore now no
[13:07] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[13:10] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[13:13] after the
[13:15] spirit Paul wrote that in Romans 8 and
[13:19] it should be no more true to us today
[13:23] than
[13:25] ever he goes on to say that
[13:29] for they that are after The Flesh do
[13:31] mind the things of the flesh but they
[13:33] that are after the spirit the things of
[13:36] the
[13:38] spirit but ye are not in the flesh but
[13:41] in the spirit if so be that the spirit
[13:44] of God dwell in
[13:47] you he goes on to say and if Christ be
[13:50] in you the body is dead because of sin
[13:55] but the spirit is life because of
[13:58] righteousness
[13:59] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[14:02] Jesus from the dead dwell in
[14:04] you he that raised up Christ from the
[14:07] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[14:09] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[14:13] you you know here Paul in Romans 8
[14:17] speaking of a
[14:19] place that we can be by him where we're
[14:23] living not according to the flesh but
[14:26] according to the
[14:27] spirit we're going to read
[14:29] Psalm 91 this morning it was on my mind
[14:33] as I was reading that and you know this
[14:36] Psalm is one of my favorites and it's
[14:39] different than many of the other Psalms
[14:41] that you
[14:42] find it begins he that
[14:45] dwelleth in the secret place of the most
[14:49] high shall abide under the shadow of the
[14:54] almighty the secret place of the most
[14:58] high
[15:01] you know David speaks of a secret place
[15:03] in Psalm 27 he says in the secret of his
[15:08] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[15:12] me up upon a
[15:15] rock you know Psalm 91 is actually
[15:19] believed to be a continuation of Psalm
[15:24] 90 they were actually part of the same
[15:26] Psalm that over time got divided into a
[15:28] couple coup of chapters but Psalm 90 is
[15:32] actually a Psalm of
[15:34] Moses and it begins Lord thou H has been
[15:37] our Dwelling Place in all
[15:41] generations and then on in Psalm 91 he
[15:44] that dwelleth in the secret place of the
[15:48] most
[15:50] high the Lord told Moses in Exodus
[15:54] 33:21 behold there is a place by
[15:57] me and thou shalt stand upon a
[16:01] rock and it shall come to pass while my
[16:04] Glory passeth by that I will put thee in
[16:07] a cliff of the Rock Amen and will cover
[16:11] thee with my
[16:12] hand while I pass
[16:15] by notice in each time he says this
[16:18] David says in Psalm 27 he shall hide me
[16:23] in the secret of his
[16:26] Tabernacle and then here in Exodus 33
[16:29] I will put thee in a cliff of the
[16:33] rock you see the thing about this secret
[16:36] place this dwelling
[16:38] place is he alone can put you
[16:44] there you know when we read Psalm 91
[16:46] this morning it speaks of not just
[16:49] knowing about this
[16:50] place not just
[16:53] visiting but
[16:56] dwelling staying in this
[17:00] place this place that he describes to
[17:03] Moses there is a place by
[17:06] me and then one
[17:09] came just before Easter and said I go to
[17:13] prepare a place for you that where I am
[17:19] present tense there ye may be
[17:25] also a Dwelling
[17:27] Place a mansion in the house a cliff in
[17:32] the
[17:34] Rock notice the starting point for that
[17:37] secret place is always on the
[17:40] Rock in Psalm 27 David describes being
[17:44] hidden in that secret place but he says
[17:46] in verse 5 he shall set me up upon a
[17:51] rock in Exodus
[17:53] 33 the Lord tells Moses Thou shalt stand
[17:57] upon a rock and then he takes Moses and
[18:00] puts him in the
[18:03] rock you know
[18:06] and then one day Jesus came and said
[18:09] Upon This Rock will I build my
[18:13] church it always starts with The
[18:17] Rock you know from the very earliest
[18:21] times even from the days of Moses the
[18:24] Lord had his in his mind a secret
[18:27] place a secret secret Dwelling Place
[18:30] prepared by
[18:32] him and he that dwelleth in the secret
[18:36] place of the most high shall abide in
[18:40] the shadow of the
[18:42] almighty or as David says in Psalm 32
[18:46] Thou Art my Hiding
[18:49] Place not a future
[18:51] place but a present Dwelling
[18:56] Place you know often when we read Psalm
[18:58] 9 one it's a place we go to for
[19:01] encouragement when we're going through a
[19:03] trial or maybe we have a trouble and
[19:07] there's words of encouragement there for
[19:09] us we go to verse four that says he
[19:11] shall cover thee with his feathers and
[19:14] under his wings shalt thou trust and
[19:18] it's absolutely a promise to us in our
[19:20] hour of need
[19:22] but notice it's a Dwelling Place not a
[19:25] visiting
[19:27] place you know it's it's more than
[19:29] running to him for a place of Refuge
[19:32] when we need
[19:33] him it's a Dwelling Place a staying
[19:37] place an Abiding Place a constant
[19:41] condition of being in that secret
[19:45] place why is it I
[19:49] wonder that I have to be reminded so
[19:52] often of where he has placed
[19:55] me or treat as a visiting place
[19:59] he says in Psalm 9915 Thou shalt not be
[20:03] afraid for the terror by night nor for
[20:06] the arrow that flyth by day so if he has
[20:10] placed Us in this secret place and we're
[20:12] dwelling there why do we
[20:17] fear Jesus said in John 15:7 if ye abide
[20:21] in me let's
[20:23] dwell and my words abide in you ye shall
[20:27] ask what ye will
[20:29] and it shall be done unto
[20:32] you the secret
[20:35] place verse n because thou has made the
[20:38] Lord which is my
[20:41] refuge even the most high thy
[20:44] habitation there shall no evil befall
[20:47] thee neither shall any plague come nigh
[20:51] thy
[20:53] dwelling you know toward the end of this
[20:55] Psalm you'll notice when we read it the
[20:57] wording changes starting in verse 12 the
[21:01] man stops
[21:03] speaking and God starts speaking
[21:06] back God starts doing the
[21:09] speaking it's a conversation it's
[21:12] Fellowship between man and
[21:17] God in Exodus 33:11 it says that the
[21:20] Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a
[21:23] man speaketh unto his
[21:26] friend not just because he was a prophet
[21:29] but because he was in that secret
[21:33] place as we read Psalm 91 it says in
[21:36] verse 14 this is the Lord
[21:39] speaking because
[21:41] he hath set his love upon me therefore
[21:45] will I deliver him I will set him on
[21:48] high because he hath known my
[21:51] name he shall call upon me and I will
[21:55] answer
[21:56] him I will be with him in
[21:59] trouble I will deliver him and honor
[22:03] him the secret place of
[22:07] dwelling it's more than a place of
[22:09] Refuge it's more than a dwelling place
[22:13] it's a constant
[22:16] habitation it's a place where only he
[22:20] can place
[22:23] you but he said I go to prepare a place
[22:26] for you that were where I am there ye
[22:29] may be also let's stand this morning
[22:32] going to read Psalm
[22:34] 91 and the question as we celebrate
[22:37] Easter the whole reason for Easter was
[22:41] to go and prepare a place for
[22:44] you and the question is are we in that
[22:47] secret place that he has prepared for us
[22:51] do you desire to be in that secret
[22:56] place I go to prepare a place for you
[23:00] and if I go I will come again and
[23:02] receive you unto myself that where I am
[23:06] present tense there ye may be
[23:09] also let's go ahead and read Psalm 91
[23:12] this morning he that dwelleth in the
[23:15] secret place of the most high shall
[23:17] abide under the shadow of the Almighty I
[23:20] will say of the Lord he is my refuge and
[23:23] my Fortress my God in him will I trust
[23:26] surely he shall deliver thee From The
[23:28] Snare of the Fowler and from the noisome
[23:31] pestilence he shall cover thee with his
[23:33] feathers and under his wings shalt thou
[23:36] trust his truth shall be thy shield and
[23:38] buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the
[23:41] terror by night nor for the arrow that
[23:43] flyth by day nor for the pestilence that
[23:46] walth in darkness nor for the
[23:48] destruction that wasteth at noon day A
[23:51] thousand shall fall at thy side and
[23:53] 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall
[23:56] not come nigh thee only with Thine Eyes
[23:59] shalt thou behold and see the reward of
[24:01] the wicked because thou has made the
[24:03] Lord which is my refuge even the most
[24:06] high thy habitation there shall no evil
[24:09] befall thee neither shall any plague
[24:11] Come N thy dwelling for he shall give
[24:13] his angels charge over thee to keep thee
[24:16] in all thy ways they shall bear thee up
[24:18] in their hands lest thou Dash thy foot
[24:21] against a stone Thou shalt tread upon
[24:23] the lion and Adder the Young Lion and
[24:25] the dragon shalt thou trample under feet
[24:28] because Heath set his love upon me
[24:30] therefore will I deliver him I will set
[24:33] him on high because he hath known my
[24:35] name he shall call upon me and I will
[24:37] answer him I will be with him in trouble
[24:40] I will deliver him and honor him with
[24:43] long life will I satisfy him and show
[24:46] him my

[1:07:03] the last time I was here when I came on
[1:07:05] in
[1:07:07] February the first time I came into the
[1:07:13] church uh there was a sister who spoke
[1:07:16] English she spoke to
[1:07:21] me she was excited and she had a lot of
[1:07:24] compassion toward towards
[1:07:28] me she said when they announced about
[1:07:31] the surgery at
[1:07:34] church I prayed a lot for
[1:07:39] you I I saw a visional a
[1:07:43] dream that you were going to get out of
[1:07:47] it I was I was seeing
[1:07:50] you that you were going to be in good
[1:07:54] health and go back to your home and pre
[1:07:57] and preach the
[1:07:59] gospel uh it really touched
[1:08:04] me and effectively when I came I was
[1:08:08] sick I had about five different wounds
[1:08:11] at my lower
[1:08:13] stomach that was hurting
[1:08:19] me but as I right now I feel very strong
[1:08:22] I feel like I could
[1:08:24] jump
[1:08:29] I would like to sincerely thank the
[1:08:31] pastor for the opportunities given me
[1:08:34] and the other
[1:08:37] thing my eyes had problems with
[1:08:43] it my eyes were condemned
[1:08:47] okay uh with
[1:08:54] cataract
[1:08:56] uh there's a an eye doctor here in
[1:08:59] Bedford who told me that there's no way
[1:09:01] I can see you you need to to to have
[1:09:04] surgery for the
[1:09:07] Cataract uh June of last year I was in
[1:09:13] Denver the the the eye doctor over there
[1:09:16] said that that they were going to have
[1:09:19] me to have surgery in
[1:09:21] November that there's really nothing we
[1:09:24] could do just wait for the
[1:09:27] surgery I went to
[1:09:29] Turkey in August in
[1:09:34] September when the doctor examined
[1:09:40] me it said it's not a cataract that that
[1:09:44] requires a
[1:09:47] surgery just take the glass this glasses
[1:09:49] and that'll be
[1:09:51] it I took glasses but I was
[1:09:54] uncomfortable
[1:09:56] I couldn't even read my
[1:09:58] Bible but since I
[1:10:01] came when I opened my Bible
[1:10:04] here I started reading
[1:10:07] correctly and until now everything is
[1:10:14] fine so I'd like to show my
[1:10:18] Thanksgiving to my brothers and
[1:10:21] sister the ones that testify of a lot of
[1:10:24] affections to
[1:10:26] they came to visit
[1:10:30] me even some supported me
[1:10:34] financially may God bless you
[1:10:37] richly and I know the word is being
[1:10:39] preached
[1:10:41] here I really like brother David's
[1:10:45] position he keeps you in the
[1:10:47] message and the prophet tells
[1:10:51] us stay with this
[1:10:53] message it's only thing that works may
[1:10:57] God bless
[1:11:05] you let's stand this
[1:11:09] morning and let's open our Bibles to
[1:11:14] Philippians we just want to read a a
[1:11:17] portion um trusting that uh we'll try to
[1:11:22] uh not be too long this morning and many
[1:11:25] of you like to try to have Easter dinner
[1:11:27] and you've got guest and we surely want
[1:11:30] you to spend as much time with them as
[1:11:33] you
[1:11:34] can this is a a a a great uh chapter to
[1:11:42] me uh for a lot of reasons but I I feel
[1:11:46] that Paul in this chapter the
[1:11:50] 13th uh third chapter of
[1:11:53] Philippians kind of sum up uh the
[1:11:57] purpose of a Christian Life and uh we'll
[1:12:02] just say a few words on that and then
[1:12:04] we'll continue on this
[1:12:07] morning and we just want to pick up uh
[1:12:12] read from the 8th verse uh through the
[1:12:14] 14th verse and it says yay doubtless and
[1:12:20] I count all things but loss for the
[1:12:24] Excellence of the knowledge of Christ
[1:12:27] Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered
[1:12:31] the loss of all things and do count them
[1:12:35] but dung that I may win Christ and be
[1:12:39] found in him not having my own
[1:12:44] righteousness which is of the law but
[1:12:48] that which is through the Faith of
[1:12:50] Christ and the righteousness which is of
[1:12:54] god by
[1:12:56] faith that I may know him and the power
[1:13:01] of his
[1:13:02] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:13:05] suffering being made conformable unto
[1:13:10] his death if by any means I might obtain
[1:13:14] unto the resurrection of the Dead that
[1:13:18] is not as though I have already
[1:13:22] obtained neither were already per
[1:13:25] perfect but I follow
[1:13:28] after if that I may
[1:13:31] apprehend that for which also I am
[1:13:35] apprehended of Christ Jesus Brethren I
[1:13:39] count not myself to apprehended but this
[1:13:43] one thing I do forgetting those things
[1:13:47] which are behind and reaching forth unto
[1:13:52] the things which are before I press
[1:13:56] toward the
[1:13:57] mark for the prize of the High Calling
[1:14:02] of God in Christ Jesus let us therefore
[1:14:06] also as many as be perfect be thus
[1:14:10] minded and if
[1:14:12] any ye be otherwise minded God shall
[1:14:16] reveal even this unto you you may be
[1:14:24] seated
[1:14:30] I believe that's the High Calling of
[1:14:34] every
[1:14:35] Christian is to strive for the
[1:14:40] resurrection and I believe that's what
[1:14:42] Paul was saying here that I live my life
[1:14:46] for the resurrection that I might obtain
[1:14:49] the resurrection he said not that I've
[1:14:51] already obtained it but I I I press
[1:14:55] towards it that I might apprehend it and
[1:14:58] and this morning that's what uh I just
[1:15:01] have a little thought I'd like to leave
[1:15:04] for Easter with you uh something that uh
[1:15:09] might carry uh with you the days of your
[1:15:13] lives that you're here and I I wanted to
[1:15:16] title this living for the
[1:15:19] resurrection by the
[1:15:21] resurrection living for the resurrection
[1:15:24] by the the
[1:15:25] resurrection and you know uh you know
[1:15:29] Resurrection means to restore to life
[1:15:34] and uh so you know like if I was to ask
[1:15:37] you a Bible quiz this morning uh how
[1:15:41] many people know how many resurrections
[1:15:43] there were in the
[1:15:48] Bible
[1:15:50] Well it's commonly spoken
[1:15:53] 10 not that have already happened and
[1:15:58] possibly three more that are to happen
[1:16:02] and some people count the resurrection
[1:16:05] of Israel as being a resurrection but
[1:16:08] there was 10 uh
[1:16:12] resurrections in the scripture 10
[1:16:15] resurrections in the scripture how many
[1:16:19] uh
[1:16:21] people were
[1:16:23] Resurrected
[1:16:26] nobody
[1:16:28] knows and we'll explain that in just a
[1:16:32] little bit but what we want to talk
[1:16:35] about this morning with you just for a
[1:16:39] moment is that Resurrection changes
[1:16:43] things
[1:16:45] yes and that is
[1:16:50] the what Changed History what changed
[1:16:53] man what changed religion
[1:16:55] which changed the direction of and
[1:16:58] course of human beings has been
[1:17:01] influential all through time was the
[1:17:05] resurrection
[1:17:07] we uh in our lives
[1:17:11] uh we are confronted with all of us are
[1:17:15] confronted with one thing in common and
[1:17:19] that is
[1:17:20] death and death is
[1:17:23] a is just something that we've always
[1:17:27] approached as being the
[1:17:31] finality or the end of the matter uh you
[1:17:35] know if you take uh somebody that's uh
[1:17:40] that has died or somebody that is dead
[1:17:43] uh we mark their memory and possibly we
[1:17:48] Mark the time that they were born and
[1:17:50] the time that they passed away the years
[1:17:54] that they've spent
[1:17:55] uh here in life but we always feel that
[1:18:00] that death and man has always looked at
[1:18:02] death is that well this is the end that
[1:18:06] uh that a person lived this long and and
[1:18:10] that was their life and and uh we we
[1:18:14] said goodbye to them and we went through
[1:18:16] a period of mourning and then we would
[1:18:19] have to set our our hopes back on the
[1:18:22] life that we had to live our survival
[1:18:25] our
[1:18:26] everyday uh toils and snares that we
[1:18:30] have to deal with and and and just the
[1:18:33] burden of life knowing that we too would
[1:18:36] come to this place and it was always a
[1:18:40] question in man it was a question in Job
[1:18:44] that what what happens uh the flower
[1:18:47] Withers away things come and go the sun
[1:18:50] sets and goes but what happens to a man
[1:18:53] and then one day was revealed to job
[1:18:56] that though the skin worms eat my flesh
[1:18:59] yet I'll see God and and that's the hope
[1:19:03] of the
[1:19:04] Resurrection is that this life is not
[1:19:07] the end of
[1:19:09] us it's not the end of the matter it's
[1:19:13] not the it's not the final conclusion
[1:19:16] and until man had resurrection that was
[1:19:19] one thing that man could never overcome
[1:19:22] he could never overcome death as I I I
[1:19:26] wrote I think probably the most helpless
[1:19:29] uh uh person we would we would say and
[1:19:32] and uh I hope that I can say this in a
[1:19:35] matter of respect but we we would look
[1:19:38] that that someone that had passed away
[1:19:42] as being the most helpless person there
[1:19:45] is in other words they can't help
[1:19:48] themselves and you can't help them so
[1:19:51] they lying in the state of death or
[1:19:55] uh in that state that we would say that
[1:19:58] that that person is helpless I mean
[1:20:01] there's nothing can be done I mean even
[1:20:04] when they they called Jesus they ran to
[1:20:07] him quickly and said don't come you know
[1:20:10] it it it's all already over uh the Danel
[1:20:13] passed away so it's it's it's just the
[1:20:17] thought that person comes into that
[1:20:20] something has reached its final uh final
[1:20:24] destiny its final conclusion its final
[1:20:27] result that this is the way it is and
[1:20:30] this is the way it's going to be it's
[1:20:33] run its course and it's
[1:20:36] over and and that thinking and and that
[1:20:41] uh uh mindset and everything has helped
[1:20:46] people C cope with things for years all
[1:20:50] right this is just the way that it is
[1:20:52] and and uh nothing can be done and I've
[1:20:56] come to the end of the matter and uh I'm
[1:20:59] stuck in this situation and this is the
[1:21:02] way that it's going to be but Paul said
[1:21:05] that I I want to live uh by the power of
[1:21:09] the
[1:21:10] resurrection and and I just want to
[1:21:13] Fellowship just a little bit this
[1:21:15] morning with you about the power of the
[1:21:19] resurrection and and what that power is
[1:21:22] and what the ability and how far
[1:21:25] reaching uh the power of the
[1:21:28] Resurrection is because it's it's not a
[1:21:31] power of man it's got to come from a
[1:21:34] source of man it's got so a man can't is
[1:21:39] comes to the end of his limit and and
[1:21:43] our Nature by coming to the end of the
[1:21:45] limit we just begin to settle in and we
[1:21:49] begin to make adjustments and we begin
[1:21:53] to make change things and and position
[1:21:57] Things based on our conclusion of the
[1:22:00] matter so this is the way it is this is
[1:22:02] the way it's going to be I'm stuck with
[1:22:05] it I'm stuck in this position I'm stuck
[1:22:07] with this the rest of my life I'm going
[1:22:10] to live this way now I'm going to make
[1:22:13] adjustments to to live this way I'm
[1:22:15] going to plan to live this way I'm going
[1:22:19] to let this have the effect on me that
[1:22:22] now I'm going to think this way right so
[1:22:25] I I've just brought myself into
[1:22:28] subjection to the the
[1:22:32] situation so just like we would take
[1:22:35] death and we would think that this is
[1:22:37] the end of it and and we're just going
[1:22:40] to adjust by it and and that's why this
[1:22:43] morning that I I I'm saying living by
[1:22:48] the
[1:22:50] resurrection you know uh uh you live for
[1:22:54] it and as a Christian Paul says I live
[1:22:57] for the resurrection but to live by the
[1:23:01] resurrection and the the hope of the
[1:23:05] resurrection and that's what our hope is
[1:23:07] today as Christians we're living
[1:23:10] believing that death is not our final
[1:23:13] end it's not the end of the matter for
[1:23:16] us we have a hope as Christians and and
[1:23:19] Easter gave us that hope that Jesus
[1:23:22] Christ rose from the dead he he had
[1:23:25] taken death hell in the grave and he
[1:23:28] conquered it and through that we realize
[1:23:31] that there's life after death so many of
[1:23:34] us think of Resurrection as only being
[1:23:37] life after death so for the power of the
[1:23:41] Resurrection is the power to uh have an
[1:23:45] effect on us after death but what I just
[1:23:48] want to say to us this morning that
[1:23:50] there is a power of the Resurrection
[1:23:53] that lives yes there's a power of the
[1:23:56] Resurrection that can be in our lives
[1:24:00] and if we just walk through the
[1:24:02] scriptures and I I love Bible stories uh
[1:24:06] I I try to a lot of times put myself in
[1:24:09] the story you know if I was this person
[1:24:12] or I was this
[1:24:14] situation and and
[1:24:16] uh uh you know the first story of a
[1:24:20] resurrection in the Bible is in First
[1:24:23] Kings the 17th
[1:24:25] chapter and it it was the woman of
[1:24:29] zepher and we know the story Elijah came
[1:24:33] through that Coast in that time and and
[1:24:37] uh and he was living there and uh people
[1:24:40] would come to him with their
[1:24:43] problems and and he would tell them uh
[1:24:46] what to do a a a a widow and came to him
[1:24:51] one time and said uh uh you know
[1:24:55] I have a great debt to pay and I can't
[1:24:58] make this debt and they're going to take
[1:25:00] my son in the
[1:25:03] slavery and and so he told her he said
[1:25:06] well go get every vessel that you can
[1:25:09] get from all your friends gather as many
[1:25:12] pots and as many vessels as you can
[1:25:15] gather and and so he they she gathered
[1:25:18] up all the vessels and she poured them
[1:25:20] out and Elijah prayed and the vessels
[1:25:23] were filled with with
[1:25:25] oil and then he told her go sell the oil
[1:25:28] and and pay the the debt and then you
[1:25:33] and your son can rest the rest of your
[1:25:36] days of her life you know in a way she
[1:25:39] was resurrected from her
[1:25:42] debt from from the the effect that that
[1:25:46] debt was going to have on her life and
[1:25:49] what it meant to her to have her son go
[1:25:52] into servitude to uh wait possibly for
[1:25:56] him to labor as a slave until the Year
[1:26:00] of Jubilee that that that she was going
[1:26:03] to have to be set to live with that so
[1:26:08] that
[1:26:10] became a bondage to her or a chain to
[1:26:15] her just think of what it was to to have
[1:26:18] to sell her son into slavery because of
[1:26:22] the debt that
[1:26:25] she and her family had uh uh gathered
[1:26:32] and and and and created so now she's
[1:26:36] going to create the burden and her son's
[1:26:39] going to have to pay the consequence to
[1:26:41] it now think of that uh how would that
[1:26:45] make you
[1:26:46] feel and I'm I'm trying to get to
[1:26:49] something that's why that I'm trying to
[1:26:51] lay it out in this manner how how would
[1:26:54] that hurt you to to watch one of your
[1:26:57] children go away and labor because you
[1:27:01] didn't pay your
[1:27:03] bills well we would think right now that
[1:27:06] that's terrible but you know a lot of
[1:27:08] people don't realize the same thing
[1:27:10] happens when you live a life of
[1:27:12] sin you know your sins Vis are visited
[1:27:16] upon your children you know but so we
[1:27:20] look at and we we know the great story
[1:27:22] that that Elijah that there was he told
[1:27:26] the king it won't rain until I call for
[1:27:29] it and so he went up and the Ravens fed
[1:27:33] him and and uh so he he was he was being
[1:27:38] fed by raisins and uh By Ravens and then
[1:27:41] not raisins but Ravens uh so he he was
[1:27:45] fed and then the Lord told him get up
[1:27:48] and go to this widow's house so he comes
[1:27:52] to the gate and
[1:27:55] uh he says he says
[1:27:58] uh do you have anything to bring me a
[1:28:00] morsel bring me a some water and she
[1:28:03] looks at him and like you know like hey
[1:28:06] don't you know the
[1:28:10] circumstances like are you out of
[1:28:13] touch I mean I'm gathering two
[1:28:16] sticks I've got a little handful of meal
[1:28:20] and a little handful of
[1:28:22] oil and word going to mix This Together
[1:28:26] me and my son we're going to eat it and
[1:28:29] we're going to
[1:28:32] die basically good luck with the
[1:28:36] water but I'm talking about
[1:28:40] Resurrection Resurrection changes things
[1:28:43] amen and he says to her he says to her
[1:28:46] he he he says no first you take that and
[1:28:50] go make me a
[1:28:53] cake and I'll eat it and he said thus
[1:28:56] saith the Lord the The Crucible won't
[1:28:58] one dry and the meal Barrel won't be
[1:29:01] empty amen and we we know that through
[1:29:05] the time of the famine that he dwelt he
[1:29:08] lived there and he dwelt there and one
[1:29:12] day that boy became
[1:29:15] sick and he
[1:29:18] died now there's a lot of great stories
[1:29:22] and and thoughts tied with these
[1:29:25] things and she came to him and she said
[1:29:28] oh what do I have to do with you oh man
[1:29:32] of
[1:29:33] God have you remembered my sins before
[1:29:36] the Lord and and brought this upon me
[1:29:40] what do I have to do with
[1:29:42] you and again he you know we know the
[1:29:45] story that he he looked at her and he
[1:29:48] thought you know this woman was
[1:29:50] compassionate to me she believed my word
[1:29:54] you know and a lot of times we get to
[1:29:56] thinking that our sins and our things
[1:29:58] visit back upon us if you are faithful
[1:30:02] and just to confess your sins they are
[1:30:05] thrown in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[1:30:08] to be remembered no
[1:30:12] more God doesn't hold Vengeance against
[1:30:16] you if you're
[1:30:18] faithful and you repent Hallelujah and
[1:30:21] you're just he forgiv that he's not
[1:30:25] sitting back waiting someday to find
[1:30:28] something to strike you with right and
[1:30:31] we know that he gathered the child up
[1:30:34] and took it up to the room and and laid
[1:30:36] on it and the child came back to
[1:30:39] life you
[1:30:41] know there's a lot of things that stop
[1:30:44] us and keep us in bondage and guilt a
[1:30:48] lot of times is one of them remembering
[1:30:51] the past is one of them looking back on
[1:30:54] the past so the very God that spoke life
[1:30:58] to her and fed her and kept her through
[1:31:02] the drought the minute that she got in a
[1:31:05] child in a place where she lost her son
[1:31:08] and a new burden came on her life right
[1:31:12] all of a sudden she went back and
[1:31:14] visited all that she had done
[1:31:20] wrong that's what Resurrection
[1:31:22] does Resurrection he took that child
[1:31:26] back and brought that child back to life
[1:31:29] the prophet did and that resurrected
[1:31:33] changed things and surely she said
[1:31:38] surely I know that thou art a man of God
[1:31:43] and that she lived in
[1:31:45] paganism that's what she was they were
[1:31:49] pagans you know a lot of times we Fe we
[1:31:51] only judge people and we only judge the
[1:31:53] goodness of God based on whether someone
[1:31:57] agrees with our beliefs that's politics
[1:32:01] there's no politics in Christianity
[1:32:03] God's God God is love God's a good god
[1:32:07] he's merciful on whom he wants to be
[1:32:10] merciful to he extends his love be
[1:32:13] beyond measure to to people God don't
[1:32:16] hold
[1:32:19] grudges and we see that the power of the
[1:32:22] Resurrection changed that
[1:32:27] situation I don't know what kind of
[1:32:29] situation you're
[1:32:31] in but I'm telling you the power of the
[1:32:35] Resurrection The Resurrection is not
[1:32:37] future tense the resurrection is living
[1:32:42] power Paul said that I might serve him
[1:32:44] that I might live by that I might
[1:32:47] participate in the power of the
[1:32:50] resurrection and I hope that each of you
[1:32:53] this morning would realize that that's
[1:32:55] what was imputed to us yes that's what
[1:32:58] was given to us is the power of the
[1:33:01] Resurrection that we as Believers can
[1:33:04] hold the power of resurrection and
[1:33:08] Resurrection changes
[1:33:12] things oh we always looking to the
[1:33:16] Future and we're always looking to the
[1:33:19] past but it's so hard for us to really
[1:33:23] re recognize what it is that's present
[1:33:26] with us because he said if the same
[1:33:29] spirit that was in Christ Jesus and what
[1:33:31] did Jesus say in John I am the
[1:33:34] resurrection and the life what was the
[1:33:37] spirit that was in Jesus it was
[1:33:40] resurrection and life I am the
[1:33:43] resurrection and
[1:33:46] life it's not something that's past
[1:33:50] tense it's something that's future tense
[1:33:54] it's not just a belief in an
[1:33:57] event but it's actually something Paul
[1:34:00] said that I can
[1:34:02] apprehend I I I I I I press to it I want
[1:34:07] to live by it I want to I want to uh uh
[1:34:10] take hold of it I want it to be what
[1:34:13] causes me to live the way that I live
[1:34:17] that I'm living for Resurrection not
[1:34:20] only future but present tense amen I
[1:34:24] guess one of the most famous
[1:34:26] resurrections is the shite
[1:34:30] woman and you know the great
[1:34:33] story The Prophet would travel by her
[1:34:36] her place and she was a a lady of well-
[1:34:39] means and her husband and and so they
[1:34:42] would invite him in for
[1:34:45] bread never
[1:34:48] hurts to do something good for somebody
[1:34:52] to go the extra mind
[1:34:54] to invite them in for
[1:34:57] some bread for a meal to share what you
[1:35:03] have with them your good will your good
[1:35:06] intentions some kind word uh something
[1:35:10] to help somebody along the way you know
[1:35:13] when the person does those type of
[1:35:15] things those things return back cast
[1:35:18] your bread upon the Water it won't
[1:35:21] return void you know don't live in a
[1:35:24] selfish little world of belief that I
[1:35:27] hope someday that I got get out of here
[1:35:30] if you're living for the resurrection
[1:35:33] live by the resurrection live by the
[1:35:36] power of the Resurrection if you're
[1:35:39] trusting it to to resurrect you and take
[1:35:42] you from the grave or take you in a
[1:35:45] Rapture then certainly you it ought to
[1:35:48] be something you can trust to live
[1:35:52] by something that you can take hold of
[1:35:55] and possess the the the the one of the
[1:35:58] first signs of Resurrection Life is the
[1:36:00] lack of
[1:36:04] selfishness why live for something you
[1:36:06] know is going to
[1:36:10] die why don't you live for something
[1:36:12] that's you know is going to change
[1:36:15] you that that's where that's where we
[1:36:17] get focused we get focused on building a
[1:36:20] career we get focused on having nice
[1:36:23] things we get focused on getting better
[1:36:25] cars and and and and what that we can uh
[1:36:29] accumulate to to make us we get to where
[1:36:32] we worry about our elderly years so we
[1:36:35] invest in the future of this life and
[1:36:38] this body so when it gets old and it
[1:36:41] can't work it can still eat and still be
[1:36:44] comforted and maybe if you don't have
[1:36:46] good children you might find a nice rest
[1:36:49] home to uh to stay
[1:36:52] in oh my
[1:36:55] now I'm not preaching this because I'm
[1:36:57] selfish but I think if you can take care
[1:36:59] of your parents you take care of
[1:37:02] them of course I want my kids to hear
[1:37:08] that but but you
[1:37:10] do you know what I mean you you you you
[1:37:14] do all that you can
[1:37:17] do but we we invest in that but a lot of
[1:37:20] times we W invest in in life itself so
[1:37:25] we know this shoe might woman she built
[1:37:27] a little she built a little Hut and a
[1:37:29] little place and and for the prophet and
[1:37:32] and he come by and he was good and one
[1:37:34] day the prophet looked at Gaz and said
[1:37:36] you know this lady's been really good to
[1:37:41] us you know what can we do for her you
[1:37:46] know she's got a lot of money she's well
[1:37:49] off and L said well she doesn't have a
[1:37:52] child and and the prophet told her he
[1:37:54] said you know he said by the time of
[1:37:57] life and season you'll be holding a
[1:37:59] child you know what she said to him
[1:38:02] don't lie to
[1:38:04] me don't lie to me don't give me false
[1:38:08] hope don't let me try to believe and
[1:38:13] hope and long for something that I've
[1:38:15] longed for all my life in other words
[1:38:18] Prophets You don't know how much burden
[1:38:20] I
[1:38:22] bore the reproach that I had to Bear not
[1:38:26] having a child all that I went through
[1:38:30] and now you're going to say that don't
[1:38:31] lie to me don't give me false
[1:38:36] hope no do this he said no you're going
[1:38:39] to have the
[1:38:41] child you know God that that's one thing
[1:38:45] about resurrection power it's hope
[1:38:49] Beyond
[1:38:51] hope it it it's power beyond every
[1:38:56] present tense circumstance she said my
[1:38:59] husband's old we're
[1:39:01] old well she must have forgot that
[1:39:04] that's how she got there being a a
[1:39:08] Jew because God dealt with some old
[1:39:12] people the Faith of Our
[1:39:15] Father so you see
[1:39:18] Resurrection is is that that's what she
[1:39:21] was dealing with she was dealing with
[1:39:23] resurrection power the the power to
[1:39:27] change the
[1:39:29] circumstance and so she went from not
[1:39:32] having a child to having a child and
[1:39:35] then after the child came of years he
[1:39:37] was working in the field and he fell
[1:39:43] dead you know he didn't throw her hands
[1:39:45] up in
[1:39:48] Despair and she knew that the power that
[1:39:53] gave her that child that resurrection
[1:39:56] power that gave her that child that that
[1:39:59] power could raise that child from the
[1:40:01] dead she saddled up and she went and she
[1:40:05] found the prophet and she brought him
[1:40:07] back and the child lived because
[1:40:10] Resurrection changes things Resurrection
[1:40:13] is present
[1:40:15] tense this is what I want to just lay
[1:40:18] deep in our soul this morning
[1:40:20] resurrection power can be lived by you
[1:40:23] can live by the power of the
[1:40:26] Resurrection you can live to know that
[1:40:29] there is a power that can change
[1:40:31] situations even
[1:40:35] death if you're dead in your trespasses
[1:40:38] and sins you're dead in your finances
[1:40:41] you're dead in your relationship in fact
[1:40:44] it just you see no life there at all
[1:40:47] Resurrection changes
[1:40:50] things
[1:40:52] Hall right it's something that can be
[1:40:55] lived by
[1:40:59] yes we've turned it into a
[1:41:02] future we've turned the resurrection
[1:41:05] into Star Trek one day we're going to be
[1:41:08] beamed
[1:41:11] up I'm not saying I'm saying it's
[1:41:13] something that's here yes sir sir it
[1:41:16] lives in The
[1:41:18] Believer it's a quickening
[1:41:21] power it'll Quicken you Paul said this
[1:41:24] is what I apprehend for this is what I
[1:41:26] live for I live for the resurrection
[1:41:29] that higher calling but I live for it by
[1:41:32] the power of the
[1:41:36] Resurrection oh I I it just the the the
[1:41:40] power is
[1:41:41] present it's something that is
[1:41:46] possessed and now when you have a
[1:41:48] possession of something is something you
[1:41:50] own is something you have amen
[1:41:54] we have separated the resurrection from
[1:42:00] ourselves it's not a carrot on a
[1:42:04] stick and this is what Paul's trying to
[1:42:06] say I I I'm I'm not perfect but I I
[1:42:10] pressed for
[1:42:11] protection I I I I haven't been
[1:42:15] resurrected but I live by the power that
[1:42:19] res can resurrect
[1:42:21] me so if something that Paul realized he
[1:42:25] said I've ran a good race I fought a
[1:42:28] good fight I go to get the crown that
[1:42:30] waits for
[1:42:34] me he knew he sat in Heavenly places in
[1:42:38] Christ Jesus he knew he possessed the
[1:42:42] presence of the Lord and in that
[1:42:46] presence you cannot say that you have
[1:42:49] the Lord Jesus and not say you have
[1:42:51] resurrection power cuz he said I am the
[1:42:55] resurrection and the light I will not
[1:42:57] leave you comfortless I will come again
[1:43:00] and be in you not even in you but with
[1:43:03] you all the way to the end Resurrection
[1:43:07] is something that God has given the
[1:43:10] believer it's a token it's a it's a paid
[1:43:14] fair you don't get up in the line and
[1:43:17] say oh I'm can I get on the bus can I
[1:43:21] get on the resurrection train can I get
[1:43:24] on the ship to Zion all the types and
[1:43:28] songs that we've sang about it you know
[1:43:30] this Train's Bound for Glory you know
[1:43:32] all those things you don't get up there
[1:43:34] and say okay do I get in no the believer
[1:43:39] goes up there and we she he's got the
[1:43:42] token he's got the fair he possesses
[1:43:45] I've Got The quickening Power I've got
[1:43:47] the right to get on this I got a right
[1:43:49] to participate why cuz I have it amen
[1:43:56] I've been living by
[1:43:57] it so I hope for something and not live
[1:44:02] by
[1:44:06] it
[1:44:09] or live as
[1:44:12] if you're
[1:44:16] there looking for vocabulary to express
[1:44:21] but you take the
[1:44:23] the dead soldier the dead
[1:44:26] man they're fleeing from their enemy so
[1:44:29] they take this guy and they throw him in
[1:44:30] the grave of of
[1:44:35] Elijah that power never leaves
[1:44:38] you what do you think is going to
[1:44:42] substain you and what life are you going
[1:44:46] to have when you go to the other
[1:44:51] side you think you're getting a new
[1:44:54] life our messenger taught us the only
[1:44:57] thing that will take with us is our
[1:45:03] character you get a new
[1:45:07] body you don't get a new life cuz those
[1:45:11] that are in Christ Jesus they never die
[1:45:14] they never taste the second
[1:45:19] death they have the
[1:45:21] life so when they throws it in there
[1:45:24] there it was and boom he comes back to
[1:45:27] life because it wasn't something that
[1:45:30] comes and
[1:45:32] goes once you get it it stays with
[1:45:35] you it'll correct you when you're
[1:45:39] wrong it'll make a way for you when
[1:45:41] there's no way to be
[1:45:43] made it'll do for you exceedingly in
[1:45:46] abundantly above what you could ask or
[1:45:50] think in fact what is the holy spirit is
[1:45:54] the spirit of Jesus Christ the
[1:45:57] resurrection and the life Christ is
[1:46:02] resurrection and and so we we have those
[1:46:05] three great uh
[1:46:09] resurrections in the Old
[1:46:12] Testament and then the next Resurrection
[1:46:15] in the scriptures is Gus's
[1:46:19] daughter and I love this story because
[1:46:22] it seems
[1:46:24] seemingly everybody had given up right
[1:46:28] you know but Jesus
[1:46:32] never oh don't come don't bother the
[1:46:35] master the danzels passed
[1:46:38] away and everybody's crying and and uh
[1:46:43] you know in in certain
[1:46:45] cultures
[1:46:47] uh they they have a belief that uh if
[1:46:52] you were a good person people would
[1:46:56] be
[1:46:58] sorry that you passed away but if you
[1:47:02] were a bad person everybody would be
[1:47:05] glad you were
[1:47:07] gone so to save somebody's
[1:47:11] reputation they they would hire
[1:47:14] professional
[1:47:17] mourners and they would sit outside the
[1:47:20] house and and wait
[1:47:24] and what they whail and and cry and
[1:47:27] Carry On You know I I always was afraid
[1:47:31] that if I'd pass away someone would come
[1:47:33] by and say that's the nicest thing he
[1:47:35] ever did to
[1:47:36] me but uh but they would they would
[1:47:40] mourn you know and Carry On and the more
[1:47:43] you mourned the more it meant that was a
[1:47:45] good person and that was a good person
[1:47:48] you know I would rather have somebody
[1:47:51] rejoice because they knew that I had
[1:47:54] resurrection and
[1:47:56] life the scripture says we don't mourn
[1:47:59] as others mourn having no
[1:48:02] hope and yet I know we carry on
[1:48:04] traditions and people just you know they
[1:48:08] they weep because they want to show
[1:48:09] everybody that that's a good person I
[1:48:12] just think it's such a better testimony
[1:48:14] for a Christian praise God they've gone
[1:48:16] to be with the Lord thank you Jesus for
[1:48:19] taking my brother my sister home to
[1:48:21] where that they live the resurrection I
[1:48:24] saw the resurrection in them now what
[1:48:26] they've always wanted what they were
[1:48:28] living for they finally United with it
[1:48:31] and they've gone home they have they're
[1:48:33] not testing the grave we we laid this
[1:48:35] whole coat in the grave but they had a
[1:48:39] new one waiting for
[1:48:42] them so you know they they had had given
[1:48:45] up and and Jesus walked in and and just
[1:48:52] spoke to her and and it was over and and
[1:48:57] and that story it is so
[1:49:01] wonderful to
[1:49:02] me look the messenger shed some light on
[1:49:06] that that I I never knew until I read it
[1:49:10] he said the reason he could call her
[1:49:11] back is he knew her name was on the
[1:49:14] Lamb's Book of
[1:49:16] Life he went back there and found
[1:49:21] it and so he we ask her to come back
[1:49:24] what did Resurrection do it changed that
[1:49:27] whole situation
[1:49:30] amen so Resurrection changes
[1:49:35] things Resurrection changes
[1:49:40] things so if you have Resurrection you
[1:49:43] can what change
[1:49:46] things the next Resurrection we know in
[1:49:49] this I love this story I love them all
[1:49:52] but I've always like this story and it's
[1:49:55] the young man of uh of uh uh a nan ni I
[1:50:03] a an I guess a nan or n Jesus had just
[1:50:08] been preaching so now he's headed to the
[1:50:11] city of Nan or ni Ian however you
[1:50:15] pronounce it and he's got a great big
[1:50:18] crowd with
[1:50:19] him and so he's coming with a multitude
[1:50:22] to the people a large crowd draw the
[1:50:25] picture here comes Jesus and he's got a
[1:50:28] crowd of people Rabbi Master you know
[1:50:31] people uh shouting accolades and and
[1:50:35] people uh calling out uh uh for him to
[1:50:40] do things for him and reaching out and
[1:50:42] touching the Hem of His Garment and and
[1:50:44] so he's coming this movie and in in in
[1:50:47] coming out of the city is a
[1:50:51] widow and she's just lost her only
[1:50:55] son and she has a
[1:50:58] multitude of
[1:51:00] people with
[1:51:03] her she's
[1:51:06] sorrow her
[1:51:08] future is
[1:51:11] uncertain no doubt her son must have
[1:51:14] provided for
[1:51:16] her some way or held her status it was
[1:51:21] whatever it was she lost what would be
[1:51:24] considered her greatest possession would
[1:51:27] be her
[1:51:29] child and here though they come and
[1:51:33] she's coming out and he's coming in and
[1:51:37] the scripture says that Jesus had
[1:51:39] compassion on
[1:51:41] her he felt for
[1:51:45] her the resurrection power has
[1:51:49] compassion
[1:51:51] amen when Jesus looked out at the
[1:51:54] multitude he had compassion on
[1:51:58] him that was resurrection power that
[1:52:02] multiplied those
[1:52:05] fishes brought that bread back to life
[1:52:08] back to life back to life back to
[1:52:11] existence over and over again because he
[1:52:14] had compassion now he comes and here's
[1:52:19] life and here's death
[1:52:24] and one's coming out of the city one
[1:52:26] wants to go into City they were on a
[1:52:28] collision course right death and
[1:52:32] life they're going to meet
[1:52:36] yes something's got to give
[1:52:42] right and just like the messenger said
[1:52:44] he said if you
[1:52:46] take a good man and a bad woman or a bad
[1:52:51] man and a good woman something's got to
[1:52:55] give one's going to go one way and one
[1:52:58] was going to go the other I'm so glad
[1:53:01] that Resurrection has power over
[1:53:07] death he reached out he touched the Paul
[1:53:10] Bearer and he said young man
[1:53:14] arise and he sat
[1:53:18] up think of
[1:53:20] it how hopeless was that situation for
[1:53:25] that that mother
[1:53:28] right everybody had drawn the
[1:53:32] conclusion that this is over right this
[1:53:35] is the way it's going to be we're going
[1:53:38] to take him we're going to bury him
[1:53:40] she's going to mourn the rest of her
[1:53:42] life she's going to be a widow but
[1:53:44] that's not the way it is when you meet
[1:53:47] Resurrection Resurrection changes things
[1:53:51] amen
[1:53:53] and there's no
[1:53:55] circumstance yes sir every single one of
[1:53:57] these things we read would have been a
[1:54:00] hopeless circumstance in the eyes of
[1:54:05] men it would have been unobtainable
[1:54:09] unreachable uh no way possible in other
[1:54:12] words live with it right but when
[1:54:15] there's Resurrection around you don't
[1:54:17] have to live with the way that things
[1:54:19] are cuz Resurrection changes things
[1:54:24] yes it has the power to bring death to
[1:54:31] life to bring life into things that are
[1:54:36] dead hope to the
[1:54:40] Hopeless strength to the
[1:54:44] weary I just love that
[1:54:47] because when those two paths
[1:54:51] crossed
[1:54:53] and there's compassion
[1:54:55] involved now if there's not compassion
[1:54:57] he would have stood back with
[1:55:02] respect no doubt a gentleman he would
[1:55:05] have hushed everybody like we do or we
[1:55:09] used to do in this
[1:55:11] country when a funeral possession would
[1:55:15] come down the road we'd all pull
[1:55:18] over we'd all turn our lights on I see
[1:55:22] more and more people just drive
[1:55:25] by no
[1:55:31] respect but that was the end of that
[1:55:33] funeral
[1:55:36] possession no longer was it a funeral
[1:55:39] possession no longer was it a a a
[1:55:43] journey to the Grave I wonder what kind
[1:55:47] of evangelist he was for the
[1:55:51] kingdom I wonder how many people he went
[1:55:53] and led to the Lord because he had
[1:55:57] tasted
[1:55:58] Resurrection I was dead but now I live I
[1:56:03] was lost but now I'm found I was dead in
[1:56:07] trespasses and sin I was dead in habits
[1:56:11] I I was dead in in fear I was dead in
[1:56:14] depression I was dead in all these
[1:56:17] results but Resurrection meant me now I
[1:56:21] can testify by now I I'm not just only
[1:56:24] living for the resurrection but I'm
[1:56:26] living by the Resurrection The
[1:56:29] Resurrection that took place in me yes
[1:56:32] and may I say this what's been freely
[1:56:34] given freely
[1:56:36] give
[1:56:38] yes you have the ability if you have
[1:56:42] Resurrection to change
[1:56:46] things the life that's in
[1:56:49] you can bring people back back from the
[1:56:55] dead not only literally is the power
[1:57:00] that we have what he gave us he gave us
[1:57:05] eternal life what was eternal life
[1:57:08] eternal life was the doorway through
[1:57:11] death that's
[1:57:13] right oh
[1:57:15] death where's your string sting oh grave
[1:57:19] where's your
[1:57:20] Victory is has
[1:57:24] none it has none we could just go down
[1:57:28] through we we we talk Lazarus we know
[1:57:33] Lazarus three days dead I don't know how
[1:57:36] many days this boy was
[1:57:41] dead but it don't matter time does not
[1:57:45] affect
[1:57:47] Resurrection I don't care how long
[1:57:49] somebody's been alcoholic I don't care
[1:57:51] how long they've been a drug addict I
[1:57:54] don't know how long it been they've been
[1:57:56] possessed by by Spirits it doesn't
[1:57:59] matter Resurrection has no time frame
[1:58:03] Resurrection could come at any time any
[1:58:06] place that there's compassion there to
[1:58:09] use it yes
[1:58:12] sir you'll never have success trying to
[1:58:15] use the power of the Resurrection for
[1:58:18] any other purpose other than Divine love
[1:58:21] power apart from character is
[1:58:26] satanic but if you could live
[1:58:30] by what God done for
[1:58:33] you resurrecting you it's become so
[1:58:38] simple nowadays people just say well do
[1:58:40] you believe that Jesus Christ is your
[1:58:41] savior yes I do do you believe you're a
[1:58:44] sinner yes I do oh you're
[1:58:48] saved go live the best life you can well
[1:58:52] that's good I would rather somebody live
[1:58:55] like that but he's offered
[1:58:59] us the same power that quickened him and
[1:59:05] raised him from the dead that same
[1:59:08] Spirit can dwell in you that's so not
[1:59:10] only can you live for it so you have a
[1:59:13] person that accepts Christ as their
[1:59:15] savior they accept that they're a sinner
[1:59:18] you know they say the sinner's prayer
[1:59:20] and now they're saved they go put their
[1:59:22] book they're living for the
[1:59:26] resurrection but they're not living by
[1:59:28] the resurrection because if you're
[1:59:30] living by the resurrection you're doing
[1:59:33] the works of the resurrection and Jesus
[1:59:35] Christ says the works that I do you
[1:59:38] shall do also because you're living by
[1:59:40] the resurrection not for the
[1:59:45] resurrection and if you really want to
[1:59:47] make sure you have it live by
[1:59:51] it yes cuz your life will testify of
[1:59:55] it it'll
[1:59:58] testify if you believe that you possess
[2:00:01] something that can change things so we
[2:00:04] we we see this great
[2:00:06] Lazarus and then I said to you that
[2:00:09] nobody
[2:00:10] knows how many people were
[2:00:15] resurrected because we know at the
[2:00:18] crucifixion the graves opened and many
[2:00:21] appear years that's
[2:00:24] right the
[2:00:27] testimony that the price had been paid I
[2:00:31] love that song this morning then Sunday
[2:00:34] morning came and everything
[2:00:39] changed amen you we we were forgiven
[2:00:43] Sinners on Calvary that's right that's
[2:00:46] what the best we could hope for right as
[2:00:49] that our sins but on Sunday yes we
[2:00:52] became inheritors of the Resurrection we
[2:00:57] became recipients he said you go into
[2:01:00] the upper room and you wait until you're
[2:01:02] endued with resurrection power till you
[2:01:05] have the power from on high to change
[2:01:08] things Peter had that didn't he he had
[2:01:11] that resurrection of Life what's the
[2:01:13] first thing he does he goes down there
[2:01:15] and he says oh Silver and Gold Have I
[2:01:17] None but that which I have I have
[2:01:20] Resurrection I can can change this
[2:01:23] circumstance
[2:01:25] yes this can be changed I can make a
[2:01:28] difference here I want to make a
[2:01:31] difference here he had compassion he
[2:01:34] said I don't got silver I but boy I've
[2:01:37] got something that's even better
[2:01:40] Hallelujah I got
[2:01:42] Resurrection I was in the room when when
[2:01:45] the very spirit that quickened Jesus
[2:01:48] Christ and raised him from the dead and
[2:01:50] I I saw him with my own eyes I saw CU
[2:01:53] then I went and I did what he said and
[2:01:56] that same life came back on me and I
[2:01:58] have that
[2:02:01] yes and it wasn't given to me for me it
[2:02:07] was given to me to live by
[2:02:10] it and now I'm going to live by the
[2:02:13] resurrection oh if he was living for the
[2:02:16] resurrection he would have said man
[2:02:19] don't
[2:02:19] worry one day
[2:02:22] Jesus will come back and you'll get your
[2:02:25] legs back and and you won't have to beg
[2:02:28] anymore this is our
[2:02:32] hope I'm tired of that dead church right
[2:02:37] because it doesn't
[2:02:39] represent a church living by the
[2:02:43] resurrection it represents a church
[2:02:45] living for the resurrection Peter didn't
[2:02:48] live for the resurrection he lived by
[2:02:52] the
[2:02:53] resurrection and he raised that man
[2:02:58] up we know
[2:03:00] that that great
[2:03:02] Saints at the crucifixion
[2:03:06] unnumbered but we saw the power of it it
[2:03:10] could even went and preach to the souls
[2:03:12] that were in prison that power of
[2:03:14] Resurrection spans
[2:03:17] time it's greater than every
[2:03:20] circumstance what do you think we had
[2:03:23] demonstrated to us in this day
[2:03:27] right we had a
[2:03:30] man born like any other
[2:03:34] man testimony had a
[2:03:38] temper fought ran from God but one
[2:03:44] day he meant yes he heard that old
[2:03:50] harmonica playing Adam Where Art Thou
[2:03:53] and he gave his heart to the Lord and
[2:03:56] then he doesn't just live for the
[2:03:58] resurrection he lived by the
[2:04:00] resurrection and what was he trying to
[2:04:03] show the church that the faith that was
[2:04:06] once delivered to the
[2:04:09] disciples would be restored in this day
[2:04:12] it would go from people living for it to
[2:04:16] people living by it living with the
[2:04:20] power using the power The Works that I
[2:04:23] do shall you do also why because the
[2:04:26] power that to change things now is
[2:04:29] within the believer and I'll just finish
[2:04:32] these last two then of course we know
[2:04:34] Matthew 28 1-6 was the resurrection of
[2:04:41] Jesus that's what we're celebrating
[2:04:44] today Follow by that was the
[2:04:46] resurrection of Tabatha or
[2:04:49] dorus and then we know the young man
[2:04:52] that fell asleep during church so for
[2:04:55] all of you that fall asleep in church
[2:04:58] there's still
[2:05:02] hope now you might get struck
[2:05:07] dead but we'll raise you
[2:05:11] up will
[2:05:13] we can
[2:05:15] we yes and we could read many other
[2:05:19] stories uh through this
[2:05:22] scriptures and we know there's future
[2:05:25] resurrections resurrections of the
[2:05:27] Rapture of the church resurrection of
[2:05:30] the righteous to the throne resurrection
[2:05:32] of the wicked so but we're talking this
[2:05:36] morning about a church that lives by the
[2:05:42] resurrection when a person dies and man
[2:05:45] feels that's the end of the
[2:05:48] matter many times we construct monuments
[2:05:53] we construct
[2:05:54] markers something to be remembered by
[2:05:58] but a lot of people they strive for a
[2:06:02] legacy in other words and they say well
[2:06:05] what's his legacy he what's his
[2:06:10] legacy a legacy is a longlasting
[2:06:17] impact after someone's passed
[2:06:20] away
[2:06:22] so it's what things do they do in life
[2:06:25] that causes
[2:06:27] changes in the future that's what they
[2:06:30] call a
[2:06:31] legacy presidents they try to do things
[2:06:34] that they'll leave a legacy something
[2:06:37] that they did in their Administration
[2:06:39] their time as president that affected
[2:06:42] the lives of people for years to
[2:06:46] come and that's all that men could hope
[2:06:50] for is a Legacy is something to be
[2:06:53] remembered
[2:06:55] by some effect that they
[2:06:59] had but Jesus's Legacy is not a legacy
[2:07:03] of
[2:07:05] remembrance it's not a legacy of
[2:07:08] remembering what that he
[2:07:11] did he did this he did this all the
[2:07:14] stories we read all the healings that we
[2:07:17] could go
[2:07:19] through we could sit back and say Jesus
[2:07:21] healed the blind Jesus healed the sick
[2:07:25] Jesus raised the dead praise the Lord
[2:07:27] for all the things that he did he did
[2:07:30] this he did that and and we would be
[2:07:32] talking about about his
[2:07:36] memory and all that he did and we could
[2:07:39] worship
[2:07:41] him for all that he did right and he
[2:07:45] deserves to be praised for all that he
[2:07:48] did there's never been a man among us
[2:07:51] like that
[2:07:52] but yet he himself said I go to the
[2:07:55] father and I'll send another comforter
[2:07:56] I'll send the power of the Resurrection
[2:07:59] that the works that I do you can do also
[2:08:01] even greater more Works than this will
[2:08:03] be done than I was able to do here
[2:08:06] because I'm leaving you a
[2:08:10] legacy and my legacy is not what I did
[2:08:15] but it's what I'm going to do through
[2:08:20] you you are the
[2:08:23] Legacy the
[2:08:26] impact the
[2:08:28] long lasting
[2:08:32] results of the
[2:08:35] Resurrection is
[2:08:39] you the
[2:08:41] life of
[2:08:44] Resurrection living in
[2:08:46] you you are showing the
[2:08:50] impact
[2:08:52] and the results of the Resurrection are
[2:08:56] present tense in you
[2:08:58] now that that you possess that power you
[2:09:02] have that quickening and because you
[2:09:05] have that quickening you can live by it
[2:09:08] and you can do the things that he done
[2:09:10] whether it's go the extra mile to give
[2:09:14] your
[2:09:16] coat to to feed the hungry visit the
[2:09:19] Widow and their afflictions
[2:09:22] all the things that we could list the
[2:09:25] good works and and the thing but even
[2:09:28] greater than that it's the ability and
[2:09:31] the power that God has given you to
[2:09:35] change
[2:09:41] circumstances you have a
[2:09:44] friend that's in
[2:09:46] bondage they're dead do you know that
[2:09:49] you have something that changes change
[2:09:54] that you can make a
[2:09:59] difference in that day at
[2:10:03] Calvary the messenger of this age
[2:10:06] William brandham told his church because
[2:10:08] his message was to restore the faith of
[2:10:12] the children back to the fathers was to
[2:10:16] once again remind the church that the
[2:10:20] power of the Resurrection ction lives in
[2:10:23] them that they now can do and change
[2:10:27] people's
[2:10:28] lives they can confront circumstances
[2:10:32] that people are absolutely helpless
[2:10:36] in there they can't help
[2:10:39] themselves the death of sin has wrapped
[2:10:43] its bondage around them and they have no
[2:10:45] way to become
[2:10:48] free but
[2:10:50] you
[2:10:52] are carrying
[2:10:56] something if it means anything to
[2:11:01] you if you're living for
[2:11:05] it why don't we live by it you can come
[2:11:09] in
[2:11:10] contact and speak the words of
[2:11:14] life and make a
[2:11:18] difference if you are in bondage to
[2:11:22] morning or you've been burdened with
[2:11:25] something all your life you lived maybe
[2:11:27] a several months or uh at a time and
[2:11:31] then the sin would so easily beset
[2:11:35] you comes on you again and you find you
[2:11:38] seem like you're finding yourself back
[2:11:39] in the same old place the same old M
[2:11:42] mind
[2:11:45] battle you got to know what it
[2:11:49] is that gives you the
[2:11:52] Victory and it's the power of the
[2:11:56] Resurrection that I might know him in
[2:11:59] the power of the Resurrection not that I
[2:12:03] might know him by history not that I
[2:12:06] might know him by works but I might come
[2:12:09] to know him and have fellowship with him
[2:12:14] in the
[2:12:16] power that brought me
[2:12:19] life and the power
[2:12:21] that brought me Deliverance in the power
[2:12:24] that brought me freedom in the power
[2:12:27] that took away the sin that so easily
[2:12:30] beset me that I might know him in this
[2:12:35] power that's what we're
[2:12:39] celebrating we're celebrating the
[2:12:41] church's God's gift to the church that
[2:12:46] they too can become possessors of
[2:12:49] resurrection power
[2:12:51] and that they too can use this power to
[2:12:55] carry on the impact and the existence
[2:12:59] and the longterm effect of what that it
[2:13:03] was that he's done so I say this morning
[2:13:09] let's
[2:13:10] live by the power of the
[2:13:14] Resurrection I don't care what it is I
[2:13:17] give it we could have applied
[2:13:19] circumstances to every single one of
[2:13:21] these stories but it didn't matter what
[2:13:25] the circumstances was cuz the power of
[2:13:28] the Resurrection doesn't deal with
[2:13:30] circumstance it deals with Victory and
[2:13:33] life Resurrection means to bring back to
[2:13:37] life to bring the drug addict back to
[2:13:40] life to bring the alcoholic back to life
[2:13:42] to bring the adulterer back to life to
[2:13:45] take people in the conditions that
[2:13:47] they're in and bring them back to life
[2:13:53] that was God's Gift not only will it
[2:13:57] Quicken your mortal body but it'll have
[2:13:59] the legacy of living that Christ in me
