Description:
What Is Your Rally Cry: A Voice That Matters
Br. Andrew Bohannon
Wednesday Evening Service: March 3,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

house of the lord tonight amen why don't you have your seats for just a moment that'll be it thank you very much just wanted to share a few things on my heart before we went to the word you know we're living in a day where there's so much pressing you you know there's there's pressures on every side and something that um it became like a vision in front of me we you know we we fellowship once a month at the brother's breakfast and uh brother had something on his heart and um the the message that we fellowshipped around was the unity of one god in in one church and there was so much that spoke to my heart in that message and something that um kind of came out of it one brother that was passing through testified because he's a nurse and he said something to the effect that you know when there's when there's sickness in the body there's different parts of the body that respond to to the need and and you know you know god is so real you know he allows the natural to declare something in the spiritual and so as i as i saw something there you know and i identify in you know because it's not about religion you know we don't come here to get knowledge to you know thump people with truth you know but it's about the the very christ coming into our hearts and actually making what he said live amen we're just surrendered vessels and getting glory giving glory unto god and and something that he had said you know and and just because he's a nurse and just speaking from the heart something quickened in me and then to think that you know just feeling you know about eight months ago we were thinking about selling our house and we started looking and um you know it just it came on us to go ahead and put the house on the market in december and uh we were pressed um you know the house sold quickly and and you know buying and selling a house is no joke you know i don't know i could really feel for um anybody with sympathy now if they've ever experienced even just moving let alone uh buying and selling and um i just i really thank the lord for him just making it so plain about the response of the body and and i really wanted to thank you from my heart and and the help that we received from the body our family i just i don't know what i'd have been able to do without you all each one of your prayers and you know we just feel pressed but you know i just something that's on my heart i just wanted to share that with you and and just wanted to give glory to the lord for his body working and operating in love amen the the the prophet of god said that the the divine love would only be in operation with the redeemed with the chosen and and i am a witness that god is alive and well amen praise the lord why don't we stand we'll just um i have a a a request uh my step-brother miko he's going to visit um my uh my aunt rosemary they'd pretty much given her up she's had multiple strokes she's you know um she's been good to me my brother my my stepbrother he's a younger brother his name's mikko he's he he's looking at the the bible as some fiction novel and and some childhood story that couldn't be trusted and and of course he went to college and he's part of a fraternity and things like that but i just believe that in times of stress in times of duress and times of emergency in times when someone's going to meet the lord that's when things can dig down and that's what i'm i'm praying tonight and if if you have a request on your heart why don't you just make it known and let's pray together precious heavenly father lord no doubt many prayers have gone up to you already lord and and surely we've heard the prophet say we could sing too much lord we can talk too much but we can never pray too much and father right now you know the needs of our heart before we even ask lord we pray that you use circumstances pressures of life and when someone would pass lord you even use situations like that lord to draw us to something that's eternal lord we pray god that you would bless each heart here lord the the word that goes forth tonight lord we pray that you would minister to the body that it would be an encouragement as we commit this service to you we thank you and we praise you and we commit it all to you in jesus christ's name amen amen if you have your bibles i invite you to turn to john chapter 16. i remember it was it was in march 3rd 19 years ago i i was working at exhibit group and i wasn't seeking the lord and uh matter of fact i was running from the lord and i was at work and instead of eating lunch i was doing some no good with brother tommy and i was going back to work and uh i got a phone call from my mom and my mom said that my grandma was actually going to go into the hospital she was having shortness of breath and this was in 2002. and you know we left the truck instead of eating lunch we you know we just did other things and even in that intoxication something happened after i got off the phone with my mom there was another voice that spoke and said that my grandmother wouldn't leave that hospital alive and you know that that voice put me in action wasn't a praying person you know and but there's something about the voice of the lord that moves a person it gets you into action amen and and tonight being 19 years from that time you know it's the lord speaking to our hearts doing for us what he promised amen and i'm just i'm encouraged because you know after the lord spoke to my heart i was able to experience some things where i don't have a regret about her passing i was able to you know share with her my heart and let her know how much i loved her and appreciate her life and how much it meant to me and you know and and and i asked her if she had ever placed her confidence in the lord jesus christ death for her soul because she's catholic but her you know her testimony was is that she's catholic because she watched notre dame football on saturday you know and she watched the parade on whatever day they make the parade down there or whatever so you know it's just one of those things that gives you a great consolation amen so we just trust that god will bring life out of death amen in john chapter 16 we'll start in verse 1. he says these things have i spoken unto you that you should not be offended they shall put you out of the synagogues yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he is doing god a service and these things will they do unto you because they have not known the father nor me but these things have i told you that when the time shall come you may remember that i have told you of them and that these things that i said not unto you at the beginning because i was with you but now i go away for him that sent me and none of you shall ask me whether goest thou but because i have said unto these things these things unto you sorrow hath filled your heart nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you that he is and when he is come he will repeat reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because i go unto my father and you see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will lead you into all truth and he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that are of the father hath are have are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you a little while and ye shall not see me again a little while and ye shall see me because i go unto the father then said some of the disciples among them what is this that he said unto us a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and you shall not see me and because i go to the father they said therefore what is this that he saith a little while we cannot tell what he saith now jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto him do you inquire among yourselves of that i had said a little while and you did not see me and again a little while you shall see me verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall turn into joy amen a woman when she is in travail has sorrow but her hours come but as soon as she is delivered of child she remember no more the anguish for the joy of the man that is born into the world and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again in your heart shall rejoice in your joy no man taketh away from you and in that day you shall ask nothing verily i say unto you verily verily i say unto you whatsoever you ask in the father in my name i will give it unto you amen and then right there in verse 24 hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full amen trust the lord will add a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seeds amen so as we were going through the um the the brothers breakfast and and even the different sermons that have been preached it's been a number of months since i've stood before you and so we feel a little nervous we just want to try to somehow relax ourselves and just trust the lord will have his way you know there's there is a uh a phrase that that came across as as brother david was uh ministering this last weekend about being a a one-man denomination and and and pulling out of the sermon about the two evils you know how that they had made things that weren't god's and then they started taking from a broken cistern and it made me think about you know because of the natural parallel and the spiritual you know we're in a battle okay we didn't we're not here in a picnic and so you know the the the warfare that we fight it's real and it's between life and death amen so if tonight if if there is somebody here tonight that is unaware that the devil's he's chasing after you you know it's it's one of those things that um you know because so many things press us you know we have to find a way to encourage ourselves you know there's so much pressing it there's so much against you you have to find something that becomes a theme something you pattern your everyday experience something you go to to draw strength from amen and so the the thought came to me what is your rally cry you know what what people have is they have what's called like a slogan if they're going to go for politics or if they're going to put some kind of uh gathering together what they want you to know is that you know this is the thing that will cause you to to motivate or to take action something that you put before you that gets you moving you know something that's like a vision that you put before you that you're walking towards and something that people can rally around and so whenever they they put this forward it's to cause a response in you amen so you know it's like this uh if if there's if there's some kind of disease that's bombarding the masses as a whole and they're saying well uh we can prevent the spread of this by you know you know somehow quarantining or restricting it but all the while if that causes your battle crying to not be heard amen we're we're facing a battle where an enemy is so deceiving that he'll take some things that seem good that actually are are not good for the kingdom i mean how how are we going to actually share the gospel with somebody when you see i mean the enemy he's he's done his best to try to to to try to naturally cool us off you know like where we feel like we can't even talk without did i get some germs on you you know and then then you kind of feel like oh am i a spreader or am i you know these kind of different things but you know it's like um praise the lord you know there's there's a a natural goal that the enemy and and the world has and then there's a goal that god has amen there's two kingdoms there's two powers and they're they're in conflict with one another amen and so whenever you think about you know the battle cry and and you know what is your rally cry i just think about how that you know an experience that i had you know i said you know coming up you know i i realized that christ died for me and that and that all of my sins was on me but when i realized and heard the gospel then i received the gospel amen and then i realized you know christ did it all amen and so it brought my soul to a resting place and you know then then you know you you you can you can camp out on that yes you know what i mean you so so what happens is now god wants to guide you and teach you into all truth and righteousness you see sometimes we get to where we get the doctrine and then it changes us and the burden of sin is gone but now god wants to send us to further truth but we're still camping out you see we're just kind of holding serve right just you know i'm good you know and yet god's nudging on your heart he's tugging on you and saying i got more for you there's there's more in the word i've got higher heights to come to amen and so i just share this experience with you to encourage you you know i accepted the lord for my my sin and and and to be my savior and and one day you know about three years you know into learning how to die out to myself the lord quickened the scripture i think i wrote it down here i just want to share it with you because you know there's there's a process you know that we're going through and it's an adoption process amen but the scripture says this i believe it's in matthew he says now um it's matthew 6 i believe it is he says now and it's the lord's prayer let's just go to it that way i can just pull right down on it in matthew 6 everybody feeling good amen god is good she says it says take heed that you do not your arms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is in heaven he says therefore when you do with thy noms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of man barely i say unto you they have their reward but when thou doest thy names let not thy left hand know what the right hand doeth thine oh that thine all may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly and when thou prayed thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are that for they they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the street that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have the reward but thou when thy prayers enter into thy closet and when thou has shut the door pray to the father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly but when ye pray use not vain repetition as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard by their much speaking amen and this is just a wonderful prayer he says be not therefore like and unto them for the father knoweth what you have need of before you even ask after this manner therefore pray ye our father which is art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as it is in heaven amen and then it says down in verse 15 he says but if you forgive not the trespasses neither will your father forgive you your trespasses amen and so that that as as i had had felt the burden of sin lift i was walking daily in the grace of god feeling good you know how the lord does he you know when the burden of sin leaves and oh everything's new i mean the birds are singing you know i mean you could hear i mean the ocean crashing and you're 100 000 miles away or whatever but it's just everything's good you know and then this comes around and and i realized you know maybe i had put a period on the end of my experience you know and and there's a thing you know i had things unforgiveness in my heart and i said wait a minute how is it i know the lord forgave me because the burden of sin is gone but wait a minute there there's a voice now this is what i want to so the thought that i have is what is your rally cry but now as a sub thought now a voice that matters see i want to hear the voice because his voice matters amen and so as he spoke to my heart he said now if you don't forgive others their trespasses your sins are i said whoa well this is a serious matter oh my but i have a right i have a right to be mad at this person because they did me wrong this was in direct uh response to an injustice that had for years all my life a disservice and abandonment not caring for responsibility but now the scripture says that when he comes he was going to reprove the world of sin amen so now god is wanting to take you and he's wanting to take me and he first wants the the christ in me to reprove this world of sin so that the very christ the hope of glory can now be expressed out for others amen so so my dad who i had unforgiveness in my heart i had never met my dad him and my mom separated when i was one so i thought i had the right but little did i know as a little lamb i had to shear off my rights and here he comes with his pruning shears and he started quickening the word how important and that voice that really matters amen the spirit of truth now is walking through every heart every situation and he's wanting to quicken this word to you right now amen that's the way he does we're coming up higher he said he wants to show us greater things amen praise the lord praise the lord the scripture says in john 18 we'll just turn there the encounter was with pilate in in verse 37 chapter 18 verse 37 pilate therefore said unto him art thou the king then jesus answered thou says that i am the king and to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth and everyone that is of truth heareth my voice amen i thank the lord for that yes amen i thank the lord for that everyone that is of truth heareth my voice amen if there's a rally cry that's going to rise up in the camp of the lord jesus christ redeemed amen i hear his voice amen that voice matters amen when the world's going on and they have their purposes and they have their causes and different things there's a people that says there's a voice that matters amen this voice actually transforms people who are lost and destitute but then they realize there's a fountain of living water there's a bank of heaven that they go draw dividends from and there's mercy he's rich in mercy amen thank the lord that i'm not what i ought to be but i'm definitely not what i used to be amen praise the lord we're fighting for truth in the midst of chaos and deception you see the things that are going on in the land today you know i was i was thinking about uh something that brother branham said in a message forgive me for getting my phone but this is the this is where i'm getting the message out of it's uh the unity of one god he says now and this struck me he says now in in paragraph 27 of the unity of one god in one church it was preached in december 21st 1958 he says now they built a tower which i doubt the modern science could to build today with all their machinery and things because they were united together they had one mind one soul one purpose one motive one objective that's build a tower so high that if god ever took a notion to destroy them again they would run them right up into the heaven with him and there'd be no way that they could keep him from doing it or he could keep them from doing it as they thought and we find out then that they organize themselves together and we find them again completely out of the will of god amen and just think about how that you know that same you know system it's it's it's a repeat it's a perfect repeat if you can see the pattern and the parallel i was digging through the church age book there's so much there's just no i might have to paraphrase but you think about the nimrod and how they satan wanted to be worshipped and and see he wasn't satisfied with just being worshipped in forms and and and and ceremony he he wanted he actually when when they raised up the the tower of babel then they begin to offer up idols and and you know worshipping uh the cree the creation the sun so then they started typing out father son and holy ghost and then they got to a place where even you know they they worked out to where it was the reincarnation through a through through a woman and so much so that they put the serpent around the sun and and now they actually started worshiping satan and didn't even know it and the the devil and deception so slickly he had he had coupled the the the child and the woman but eventually the woman now began the one that they was the adoration in worship so so the king supposedly was reincarnated in a son an immaculate conception wha what you know the devil he saw he saw what was going on he heard he heard the devil i mean he he heard uh the prophecy in the garden i'll put enmity between her seed and the woman's seed he heard it he's trying to always be in front but you know the devil the spirit of air by the word of god you can know and he's working in deception so you think about how that now they're raising up they're unifying and and it was the first time that they had because before there was only one god you know and they all worshiped the one god but now as they were rising up nimrod confusion he was the interpreter of the gods and then he began to share all his doctrine and teaching that there's more than one god there's more than one way my and then they began to make like the priest became like the military force their doctrine my and you think about how it is today you know you know we're looking i mean the rally cry for us you know is is the faith of our father is being restored you see the the enemy he he all he has you know if you look at their rally cry it's science civilization and education they're they're gonna unite all together and and in the numbers oh we'll we'll make stuff happen you know in a parallel look think about in that day how they through their science which brother brown said we couldn't even duplicate they had access to some kind of power and you think you look you can see it in the news article nasa the spacex they know a fire is coming but god has a provided fire and holy ghost see we're not trying to make the world a better place to live it's got to be renovated and a new heavens and a new earth where christ will come and reign in righteousness so you think about how that through their science now they're you know that that tree of knowledge is is now resulting in death again you know many people are falling into the trap of believing that lie that somehow the fire is not going to fall they they just begin to sit back and rest and relax you know and i just thank god for the pressure you know there's there's situations in life that you if you chose it if i chose it i would say i do not want that pressure i do not want that test i do not but it's through the various trials and temptations that we experience that the christ in us could manifest amen it's it's the the squeezing out that brought christ out amen he was bruised for us amen and so that we can be healed that we can be saved we can be delivered amen and now it's your time the rally cry is it's your time jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen he wants to use your redeemed flesh amen he wants to squeeze the christ out of you so whatever situation whatever circumstance that you're falling in you can't seem to take it praise god there's something in you that you can depend on there's a fountain flowing from within amen now the the thing is is to learn how to walk in the spirit to hear his voice now there's so many voices i mean this thing's like a constant it'll keep you up at night but there's a voice that matters amen makes the difference and it's typically an unseen difference amen you know there's there's a slogan that brother branham had said and i had put it up at my desk for a number of years and after we were packing it up i kind of revisited it and it's a real simple slogan and i think it's it's it's edifying because there's times where you're pressed and you need to encourage yourself in the lord he said this he says now he says do right act right and you'll turn out right simple you do right act right you'll turn out right amen and it's just simple i like it i like it because it's so simple amen now there's another slow slogan that brother branham spoke of and you know whenever i refer to uh china you know that's that's the bamboo curtain right and when you think about russia they're the iron curtain and now there's a purple curtain and now and i said watch that one because there's deception in that one and you see about the recent manifestations in the natural there was a woman in purple you see she was standing there and and you know there there's got to be flares and fireworks going off in the the heart of the believer that says now i realize there's a union going on and it's going on behind the scenes i am not deceived by the wicked ways of the enemy i have another voice that's making a difference amen that ecclesiastical power that military power now they're uniting and they will cause a forcing but praise god there's a people that has heard the voice of the resurrection they won't have to go to the great tribulations amen praise the lord brother brahm made this statement in this message called god keeps his word you know now now watch just a minute no not to be prejudiced just sit still and listen let the holy spirit bring it to you now today we got in the condition like it was in ahab's time well whatever the woman said that's what ahab did now even in the church they worship women not long ago my righteous ignatian was brought up in mexico when i seen a little poor no note of her rather coming down crawling for miles on hot rocks and as the father walked along with baby in his arms and two of them and one of them following along the mama and her crying and hiding off the height off of her knees pulling her hands through the rocks and crying and everybody looking at her she had went up to some statue of some dead woman that supposed to be a saint and they didn't i didn't say this critically i say this in light of god's word it's absolutely unadulterated spiritualism the bible says there is no intercessor there is no other mediator between god and man but the man christ jesus if the early church was catholic then why had they changed when the early catholic condemned it and this catholic accepts it it's a woman's world the spirit and the slogan is today and that's true that's exactly right amen so you think about how that even then i mean now think about the deception you know if we're going to be effectual witnesses for other people that are in denominational i mean these are this is shackles i mean can you imagine as you know if i told you you had to walk this on your knees in your hands to be right with god i mean there's people that are carrying this practices out and they're even offering indulgences for future sins you can go and pay money and and you can just indulge and you can just go and pray some our father and hail mary and your conscience will be sued my goodness we there's got to be a rally cry for truth there's brothers and sisters in those denominational ranks we must go and share the truth with them that that will set the captive free amen i know we're not all preachers in the sense of behind the pulpit but we're all preachers we have a message you see sometimes where we get caught up though is when we're just sharing doctrine you see it's just a theology or a religion but let it be a life first amen let it be the witness of the spirit there's something about that man that i just get around him and i just start feeling good when i feel bad you know there's something like it's shedding off of me there's a pressure that i feel from the world but then i start fellowshipping with that brother and all of a sudden there's a refreshing that comes what is it about this person there is like there's like an aura around you what's going on oh my oh my thinking about you know certain doctrines and i heard about this thing and speaking of the worship you know i i said like this you know true worship is to to emulate yourself after so so there is a true worship that the bride of jesus christ gives to christ amen so when i speak of the worship of a woman don't take your mind just to the negative there's there is a pollution and a filth i i heard of this milk grotta oh my goodness people actually there's cases in the catholic church and people they try to point to it and say this is vindication vindication that they're right and so like over a thousand people who had incurable diseases supposedly the virgin mary had oh my goodness that there's like powdered milk on the ground that people if they can go and touch the the powdered milk then they can be well because it comes from the virgin mary that that just you know thank god we're not deceived you know the the questions and answers brother branham he was questioned they tried to pin him down he said you know there's people that go to the witch doctor and they say why is it that a third of 30 of the people that go to the witch doctor get healed why it's simple god honors faith they had the right approach they took the approach and their faith made it move god honors faith even if it's not in his word my but think about those who do honor his word and take his word they're going to take a body change hallelujah they hear his voice and that voice is going to bring him to a resurrection amen anything that serves god's purpose will receive a resurrection let's let's press to make that our rally cry i'm serving his purposes i have come into the world to serve his purposes and to put just like my lord did you know he he fought deception with truth and it it broke the shackles to the to those who needed deliverance the redeemable amen praise the lord you know i just one of satan's ambitions was to try to let's say muddy the waters so he'll he'll make polytheistic gods make confusion and then it tries to smear who god is and try to put a cloud over mysteries so that people will not inquire because it's just it's too muddy my but that's there's a voice a final voice to a final age amen take courage take courage yeah i just think about something that i've heard and you know that that bamboo curtain recently they made a a renewed deal it was last last last year and just trust the lord will help me share this next part it you know we got some brothers that are doing mission work in china and you know that that's very dangerous dangerous work and you know it's it's the enemy's job to bring deception and to try to make people afraid to stand for truth and now they have made agreements to to with the with the purple curtain with rome they've made an agreement and now um you know it's they're they frown on religious liberties because as a dictatorship they have to have control and so now they have agreed to allow the catholics in but now this gospel that they're sharing is actually stating that jesus christ was guilty of a murder and a sinner think about this think about how they turned things in into a lie so now i mean you think about the persecution for christians before i mean they're they're going to drag you in and think they're doing god a service and you know that's knocking on america's door so so you know we're not we're not afraid what man can do to us you know we we know without a doubt god's promised a body change and he's gonna declare the power of the resurrection in a body in the face of his enemy we have a table spread hallelujah i just think about you know i just wanted to encourage you you know they they even call it the reconciliation deal i mean the this missionary was sharing this and i just thought you know what a devil what a devil to car lord a murderer and a sinner you know that you know it's just one of those things that you know we just want to take courage just going to share a few more things with you just to encourage you you know we're we're pressed on every hand and yet the enemy he's going to come in like a flood but god promised to raise up a standard against it there's a voice that's going to come from within that's going to lead us and guide us he's going to in that very hour he's going to give you the word and you're going to just repeat it as he gives unction you're just going to move forward in faith believing lord as i have need of it here it is unction this is a wonderful statement brother branham made in a message called looking away to jesus he said in revelation 13 plainly explains the lamb come up out of the earth and the other beasts come out of water thickness and multitude of people this lamb come up where there is no people a lamb represents a religion the lamb of god and remember it spoke like a lamb it was a lamb and then after a while it received power and spoke like the dragon and exercised all the the power of the dragon that before him the dragon is rome always so don't you see rome denominations a mark protestant denominations image unto the beast making power that'll force all protestants like a union they'll have to be in the council of churches or you won't be able to have fellowship well it's practically that way now you can't go to church and preach unless you have a fellowship card or some identification now on persons like ourselves we're going to be cut out of all of that all together that's exactly because they won't be able to do it it's it's tightening and when the time comes when the time comes and the press comes to a place where you'll press out then watch what i'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third pull when you see an absolutely a total loss to the total loss but it will be for the bride and the church amen so when the persecution comes watch that third pool amen there's going to be a slogan you know when you have needs and you're going you're sick or if you need a job ask god's here to hear you he's here to encourage your faith he's here to perform his good word towards you we have to grow up and learn how to accept the word of god because what we're coming to we're going to stand in the face of our adversary and put him under our feet watch i'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch that third pull watch that third pull his unfailing words of promise brother branham said this in 1964 on january 20th he says now i might encourage you to believe now that great gift others have tried to explain it and say how it's done that it can't be explained just wait it will not be in operation so perfectly now wait until the council of churches begin the persecution on then when it happens praise the lord praise the lord he's dropping in i mean the the faith that is in you is going to live to put you're going to see some things persecution don't fear it don't fear it the never failing presence of jesus christ is with you wherever you go he is the one performing his good word in you you just don't be ashamed and stand there in the face of it just like moses he came to the place where he says now i can't do anything and god spoke and he acted that's the same for you god's going to speak in your hour of need he's he's the same he's faithful amen that's a rally cry he's faithful he's never changed he's always been there for me he's always been there for you he's never failed you once he can't fail and he can't lie praise the lord we're going to go ahead and try to close i got just one last thing i wanted to share with you we can invite the musicians to come this is uh you know it's like people have all these causes and things that they they encourage themselves every day it becomes a slogan or a theme or a rally cry of their lives and you know it motivates them you know and and so i say this brother branham made this statement in revelation chapter four number three preached in 1961 on january 8th he said this he says now god speaking to the church reflecting himself through seven spirits when the true anointed of god speaks it's the voice of god amen take courage tonight there's a voice that matters it's when you're in tune with the spirit of god when you speak god speaks amen god wants to so position you that it's thus saith the lord that voice matters to reject it is to remove the candlestick voices the voice of the seven church ages over in the corner the voices speaking with thunder and lightning nowadays we're so well we don't believe in saying hell in the pulpit oh mercy sobl my we need men of god men who won't hold back now everybody can't be a preacher but you got a voice if you can't preach the the people a sermon if you're a preacher you're called to preach pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon let your sermon be lived it's a voice of god that will bring reproach to them who reject it they say no one can put a finger on his or her life now i want this to be a slogan for my life i want this to be a banner a vision they're sweet living if there's ever a man of god it's that man that woman see lives his sermon don't try to preach them if you're not called to be a preacher you'll get mixed up anyhow and mess it up you'll get people tangled up and they won't know well you'll ruin your them and yourselves too just live your sermon the preacher is called to preach his and live it too and if you can't live it then stop preaching you're supposed to live your sermons all right now here was voices oh how we need in bedford thousands in jeffersonville how we need thousands of live voices the thunder of god thundering out sweetness and holiness and purity undefiled lives walking around the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians that's the thunder against the enemy i mean we don't have to worry about some great theology just a sweet undefiled life oh my lord let it be tonight unblemished oh god you know our desire [Music] the devil don't care how much and how loud you are hollering the devil don't care how high you can jump or how much you can do this and shout but what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as he could be and move right on oh my that throws him around that's the thunder that shakes the devil oh my just like well you say if he could preach like billy graham or oral roberts or somebody some great influential speaker he'd be oh no sometimes the devil just laughs at that he pays no attention to that nothing you get all the theology you want to in all the sermon training and the devil just sits back and laughs at that but when he sees that life look at those disciples down there the manic child that day with come out of him devil come out of him devil come out of him devil the devil just sat there now ain't you making a pretty shame of yourself now you see what you're doing jesus told him he commissioned you to cast me out not one of you could do it but brother when he sees him coming one walking quietly oh my he didn't even have to say nothing the devil was already scared right then he knew he had to leave right because there was a life not only a sermon but a life come out of him oh my that done it quickly he knew what he was talking about he knew what he was doing amen praise the lord why don't we all stand i just trust the lord will encourage you you're that tree of life you have the risen savior dwelling inside of you he's speaking through you making the difference in your life making the realities of the christ that's in you so that you can go and carry out the commission there's there's souls that are represented in the lamb's book of life that your life we have an obligation to go and tell you know take these mass off i'm i'm in the face of the enemy i'm gonna stand here on this truth despite the persecution despite my mind trying to persecute me amen praise the lord why don't we bow our hearts in our heads heavenly father lord god we so appreciate your presence lord we
