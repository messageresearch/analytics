Description:
Study of Acts Chapters 24-28
Br. George Smith
Sunday Evening Service: September 20,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

further into the word of god this evening so george god bless you good evening it's good to be back in the house of the lord tonight this evening and uh god has been good to us give you health let you breathe that you see the beautiful sunshine and so tonight we're going to try to finish up the book of acts and we never can't get away from the unfailing realities of the word of god it's real and it never fails when all this beautiful texas is going to be ashes they'll still be the word of god let's pray father we thank you this day for your grace to us we thank you that we can be here and to enjoy your word we pray that you speak directly to each one father all we're trying to do is make christ real to the people bless them help us to speak the truth we ask in jesus name amen so you may be seated open your bibles to acts chapter 24 but you know the that quote that we started with this morning knowing that you are my responsibility and on my hands for the gospel i'll always want to keep you writing the pages of this bible that was brother branham's ministry and um first corinthians 1 18 by the foolishness of preaching because what we do here what you enjoy is foolishness to a lot of people you know they completely look over ephesians 4 chapter chapter 4 verse 11 and 12. but in galatians 1 and 8 paul told us very specifically god has given me the revelation i gave it to you and if anybody if i come back next week with a better revelation god you know don't listen if an angel drops out of heaven and gives you something different so there's one of our key scriptures that if it's different leave it alone now you're not going to change people i've tried doesn't work you got to leave them alone the best we can hope for is maybe a mutual respect um that uh i don't preach about you you leave me alone we'll meet you at the finish line so that's all we can hope for but um we're going to preach again from brother branham's absolute which is the scripture and in chapter 23 of acts we had uh we had paul in prison remember or he's he's under heavy guards in um caesarea they took him down there with 470 soldiers remember and so he uh says they left him bound but you know kind of protective custody and so uh in chapter 24 we have the fact that five days later it says that um here in chapter 24 verse one and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with certain orator that means a lawyer named tertullius who informed the governor against paul so they came down in mass you know they're with their great um uh lawyer and we're gonna tell this governor exactly who this character is see and here he comes with his entourage in verse two he flatters the government with great words we have enjoyed the great peace and prosperity due to your wonderful planning and we're so thankful but we have a little situation sir this man so they invented some accusations which remain amounted to name calling the same thing we got going on today they have no basis but because we hate him we're gonna make up stuff you know and so he's telling the governor how that this man profaned our temple now the governor could really care less about their religious problems that's y'all's problem you know and so we grabbed him because he profaned our temple and uh we were going to judge him according to our laws uh-huh how's that beating him to death that was the way they were going to solve it and but your man the commander took him from us with great violence oh yeah remember he simply rescued him out of their hands and so uh he thought it best that you yourself judged this case and all the jews said amen yeah you're right mr trudeau so we agree so we have paul on trial for his faith here in chapter 24 and um he's standing before an angry arrogant religious high council and the roman governor in caesarea in the years about 57 a.d so governor felix gives paul the nod permits him to say his peace okay 24 10 then paul after that the governor had beckoned him unto to speak answered and said for as much as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation i do the more cheerfully answer for myself in other words you you know our whole situation here in israel because the thou mayest understand that there are not yet 12 days since i went up to jerusalem for the worship and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues nor in the city in other words i'm perfectly innocent 13 neither can they prove the things wherever they now accuse me okay but this i confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy that's the way i worship the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets i believe the entire scripture not just a few choice pieces of what moses said okay verse 15 and i have hope towards god which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both the just and the unjust and herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offense towards god and toward man in other words live honestly now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation and offering whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple neither with multitude nor with tomo you know causing no upset but ought to have been here before thee and object if they had against me so these guys didn't even show up to trial they're over jerusalem causing the scene they didn't come down verse 20. or else let these same here say if they have found any evil doing it with me while i stood before the council except to be for this one voice that i cried outstanding among them touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question for you by you this day well there's where he touched the wrong key the governor was not so interested in the fine points of the religious law of the jews now that's y'all's problem he was simply protecting god's man of the hour from death by the hands of the most religious people on the planet sadducees and pharisees they knew it all and they had the pedigree and the attitude to prove it yeah we had john the baptist he said oh you generation of snakes dangerously moving amongst the crowd you know jesus said blind leaders of the blind and many other things in matthew 23 and now paul is on trial for his beliefs in chapter 24 verse 14 through 21 that we just read and so now governor felix having a better understanding of the way of christ because you know he's had some history with the jews and he granted an injunction and he said well i'll tell you what we'll do this when the chief police comes down we'll review the how we'll review the case again goodbye have a nice day and a problem so far verse 23 um and he commanded the century and to keep paul and to let him have liberty and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come to him so he was he had a nice place to stay guys can come and see him and so forth and so then a few days later governor felix and his wife drusilla invited paul over for lunch and asked him more about the christian faith he'll get into talking and paul didn't hold back you can read it yourself he expounded to them regarding righteousness holiness judgment that is coming and there was such an anointing present that the government was fearful and he trembled you know he was moved by the power of god through the words of a gospel preacher but he put it off like a lot of people today you can go now i'll call you you know when it's more convenient i've got a lot of things to think about today in other words i have other priorities okay so let me tell you something it's never a more better right time than right now when god speaks don't think that you've got tomorrow there's a lot of people on the way to the hospital right now that won't see the sunrise you don't have no i you have no guarantee that you go out there and start your car you know and so um god knows when is right and he expects you to answer at that time you see there's a time when it's the right time now i'll give you a small story of last you know a long time ago when the the film the ten commandments first came out was 1955 okay and so some people told brother branham about it and he thought well that'd be a good idea sounds good so he took his family which would have been 1955. joseph wasn't born yet so we got the two girls and his wife the four of them they went to a small theater in new albany a little bit bigger than this congregation here and so he's you know film comes on the ten commandments and of course it's four hours long but um they're watching and when the you know when the pillar of fire comes on the screen it's so perfect brother bram jumped up and took his hat off because he thought it was a real thing oh yeah oh it's film okay so he sits back down well they see the whole film and then they're on the way home now rebecca was very very sensitive person you know she was very sensitive to spirits and at that time she would have been nine years old and so they're going home after a four-hour film which you know they didn't go to movies or something brand new and so she's crying well honey what's the matter you know daddy took you to movies but dad didn't you see and so she had seen in the film where moses said now all this on the lord's side come with me and you know these people are coming across and they're going with him but she wasn't watching them she's watching these other people that waited another half a minute and they fell in the pit you know and they were trying you know in her way looking at it and she said well it wasn't fair dad means people trying and he said well let this be you know like we would say a teaching moment when god shows you something you do it you don't wait around take a vote and see if grandma agrees and all this no you go get with it so that's what happened here you know he put it off well in our story here the governor sent for paul on a regular basis it says and they had we'll say limited fellowship but we never read about the government governor actually accepting christ or being baptized he'd just like to talk about it oh we got friends like that we got family i like to talk about it and debate the issue well you know now get with it you know and at each meeting guess what he was really hoping that because he allowed paul to have these visitors at each meeting that he had with paul he was expecting paul to bring him some cash yeah it says that right there in your bible that each meeting he would bring a bribe okay you're looking at me like i'm crazy verse 26 he hoped also that money should be given him of paul that he might loose him wherever he sent for him the more often and communed with him clear back there it wasn't invented in mexico it wasn't invented in africa way back there so this went on for two years from 57 to 59 a.d so then the governor's term you know came to an end and um another one was going to take his place but felix being a politician he left paul in prison in order to please the jews and make himself look good yeah you see with some people you probably don't know any but i do it's all about appearance no substance all about appearance you know but you see god demands a correct order of priorities and with the believer jesus christ always has first place never forget jesus christ is the redeemer of mankind william branham is the restoration prophet that you just happen to live in the same time frame you know so anything that comes between you and god is called an idol we have an entire study on idols images and idolatry yeah okay moving along to chapter 25. so in 25 1 and when festus was come unto the province that's the new governor after three days he ascended from caesarea up to jerusalem now um i put in there ascended up to ascend it means going up because jerusalem is at 2 300 feet above sea level caesarea is on the seaside you see and usually when you read in your bible the people went up to jerusalem they came from the east side from jericho because in in what like 25 miles it goes up 3000 feet or better so always going up to jerusalem anyway verse 2. then the high priest and the chief of the jews informed him against paul and you know besought him and they desired favor against him that he would send for him to jerusalem laying weight in the way to kill him so they're still after him now i'm sure that these 40 guys they probably got hungry right yeah they probably didn't keep their promise because time is going on he was in prison down there for two years so uh but they're still wanting to kill him so the first order of business you know with the new governor the religious authorities brief the new governor about this prisoner with a sinister plan now sir with all due respect please bring this sorry preacher up here to jerusalem so we can take his head off you know um so the new governor says in verse 4 um no he will remain he'll remain in my jail in caesarea i will take care of him so after 10 days he returns to the nice seaside home and they have the trial okay verse 7 of chapter 25 let's see here and when he was come the jews which came down from jerusalem stood around about and uh laid many and grievous complaints against paul which they could not prove sounds like news today right a bunch of nonsense i can't prove um okay we're going to go down through um where we have here we're down through um verse 14. now wait a minute we're in 25 yeah verse here now 7-12 and so while he answered for himself neither against the law or the jews neither against the temple or against caesar have i offended anything at all said paul but festus willing to do the jews pleasure but you know do them a favor answered paul and said will thou go to jerusalem and there be judged by these things before me got a question here then paul said i stand at caesar's judgment seat when i ought to be judged or out to be judged to the jews have i done no wrong as thou very well knowest for if i be an offender or have committed anything worthy of death i refuse not to die but if there be none of these things wherever they can accuse me no man can deliver me to them i appeal to caesar now this comes out of his own you know reasoning god already spoke to him said you will be a witness to me in rome well he just got his ticket signed when festus then fest is when he had conferred with the council answered you appeal to caesar the caesar yoga buddy we'll be glad to get you off our hands out of here so king agrippa came to welcome the new governor of hestus and rehearsed the whole story with him and in verse 22 then agrippa said unto festus the new governor i would also like to hear this man myself tomorrow can you can you arrange that oh sure search yeah yeah we'd like to hear it for myself okay so verse 23 through the end of the chapter and on the next day when agrippa was come and beatrice with great pomp and you know entered into the palace of the hearing and the chief captains you can imagine all the stuff that's going on you know paul was brought forth and festus said king agrippa and all men which are here present with us uh you see this man about whom all the multitude of the jews have dealt with me both of jerusalem and also here crying that he ought to not to have not to live any longer but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself hath appealed to augustus caesar in rome i have determined to send him but i have nothing to write i have no letter to send with him wherefore i have brought him before you and especially um before theo king agrippa that after examination um i might have something to write in other words you could give me some clues what i could put in this letter for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not with all to signify the crimes laid against him so he knew it was all sham he knew it was all a bunch of accusations but hey you want to go see caesar fine but i got to send a letter with you okay and so are we going to chapter 26 then agrippa said unto paul thou are permitted to speak for thyself then paul stretched forth his hand and answered for himself i think myself happy king agrippa because i shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused by the jews especially because i know you to be an expert in all the customs and questions which are among the jews wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently so now king agrippa which was appointed directly by rome listens to paul as he tells his entire story from verse 2 all the way down through verse 23 with lots of details we're not going to read the whole thing but we're going to look at verse 14 and when we were all fallen to the earth okay he's telling about when he was going to damascus and fell down the dust and everything he said i heard a voice speaking unto me saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and i said who aren't you lord and he said i am jesus whom thou persecutest but rise and stand up on thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister now he was not a minister he was an agitator he was putting people to death but god's grace reached down for him so no matter who you are or what your past is today you can turn the corner if you accept the grace of god because right here i'm going to make you a minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen and those things which i will appear unto thee deliver thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom i send thee so i'm sending you to the gentiles that had never happened before verse 18 to open the eyes and to turn them from darkness to light now these people thought they were in the light they were quoting their prophet perfectly without an ipad without a cell phone they read and they memorized that's how they knew the law of moses but they were in darkness they thought they were right they had memorized everything moses said but they were in the dark but i'm going to send you paul bring him to the light um comma and from the power of satan are you kidding me the power of satan we memorize the prophet's words it happens it's happening today from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in meat okay um verse 19 whereupon o king agrippa i was not disobedient until heavenly vision i obeyed everything god said i was totally converted and i did what he said verse 22 having therefore obtained help of god i continue unto this day witnessing both the small and great saying none other things than that which the prophets and moses did say should come i'm preaching to you the word of god they don't believe even though they memorized it look i know a person far away you don't know him probably but this person told me 20 years ago that she had heard every recording eight times and i'm thinking why do you have this temper to fight a buzz saw if you've heard everything so it's not a matter of what you've done it's whether you've been converted from the inside out you know and all he's doing is preaching what moses said you know verse 23 that christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should show light unto the people and to the gentiles all that's in moses writings you know but they couldn't handle the manifestation they just want to repeat you see look at 24 and as he thus spake for himself festus said with a loud voice paul you're beside yourself much learning has made you mad but paul said i'm not mad most noble festives but i'm speaking forth the words of truth and soberness for the king knows of these things before whom also i speak freely for i am persuaded for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this thing was not done in a corner now friends this that we call the truth the message it wasn't done in a corner it's being projected far and wide around the world in many languages there's a man in mexico right now that has baptized more people than paul than peter baptized on the day of pentecost things are happening yeah oh yeah so reading on down kanga grip i believe is now these the the prophets i know that you believe then agrippa said paul almost not persuaded me to be a christian i mean i'm that close you know and paul said i would to god that not only thou but also all that hear me this day we're both almost and all together such as i am except for these chains that i've got on you know so um verse 30 and when he had thus spoken um the king rose up and the governor and bernice and they sat with him and when they were gone aside uh they talked among themselves saying this guy has done done nothing worthy of death or of these bonds these chains then said agrippa and defestus this man might have been set free at liberty if he had not appealed to go to caesar he asked for it away he goes so at the time of paul's trial there in caesarea it was not a crime to be a christian when standing before a roman court they all agreed that paul was innocent but after spending two years in the prison there he was sent to rome to the supreme court and his journey to rome was not a pleasure cruise it was full of problems okay and we're going to cover this in the next few minutes here because this is the end of the study but um our brother was facing a very uh long voyage to rome today it's a four-hour flight but then all they had was a boat and it all depended on the winds and which way they were blowing and so forth and this is late autumn of 59 a.d now the merchants kept an eye on the weather and um they knew when was the most favorable winds favorable times you know just like right here the weather can change so this ship that they're on could have been 100 feet long it was all wood carrying up to 300 tons of grain from the middle east to rome okay after mid-september the sailing gets dangerous so they greatly discourage sailing from november 12th till march 10th and they were carrying mediterranean grains to rome the grain dealers over there were waiting for the shipment and so they took along some prisoners they stopped for a day in sidon which is lebanon today and paul was permitted to go into town see the saints okay and then they tried to proceed but the winds were contrary took more time then they came to a place in southern turkey called myra and all the prisoners were put on another boat that sailed for many days in bad weather and they finally came to the island of crete now this is all in your bible i'm not making it up so 27 verse 9 let's see here now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because of the fast was now already passed paul admonished them and he said sirs i perceive that this voyage will be with great hurt in other words we're in for it and much damage not only of the lading of the ship but also of our lives nevertheless the centurion believed the master of this owner of the ship more than the things which were spoken by paul so lots of bad weather so we get to verse 18 and we being exceedingly tossed with the tempest the next day they lightened the ship what do you think that means they're throwing the grain out that's gold no they're gonna get paid when they get there so they're pitching this stuff out because they don't want to sink um verse 19. and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship yeah all the you know what makes it work they're getting serious uh it's looking bad for everyone in verse 21 and after a long absence paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs we should have hearkened unto me he should have hearkened to me and not have loosed from crete and to have gained this harm and loss now i exert you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but only the ship in other words we're going to lose this boat but nobody's going to get hurt for their stood by me this night an angel of god whose i am and whom i serve and he said fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar and god hath given thee all them that sail with thee wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i believe god that it shall be even as it was told me how be it we must we must be cast upon a certain island now he doesn't say where but it is uh you know an island they're coming to but when the fourteenth night was come in other words two weeks later as we were driven uh as we were driven up and down in uh adria about midnight the ship men deemed that they're drew near to some country and they sounded and found it 20 fathoms and when they'd gone a little further they sounded again there were 15 fathoms then fearing lest we should fall upon the rocks they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for day so this is all happening in the night and as the shipment were about to flee out of the ship when they had let down the boat unto the seed of the lifeboat under color as though they would have cast anchors out of the four ship paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers except these abide in the ship you cannot be saved in other words we've got to stick together you guys go off on your own too bad so the soldiers were cut off on the ropes of the boat and let her fall okay goodbye lifeboat and while they're while the day was coming on paul besought them all to take me saying this day is the fourteenth day that we have tarried continued with our fasting and we've not eaten anything so let's eat the stuff we have amen and therefore i pray to you take some meat and for this is for your health for there shall not a hair fall from the head of any of you wow and when he had thus spoken he took bread gave thanks and they began to eat and they were all a good cheer and took some meat 37 and we were all in the ship 200 score that's 276 people this is no little band of renegades that's a crowd it's three times what's here tonight or more 276 people and when they had eaten enough they were they lightened the ship and cast some more stuff off you know and then the wheat into the sea and when it was day they knew not that they didn't know where they were but they discovered a certain creek with a shore in which they've mined it and you know thrust the ship in there and when they had taken up the anchors committed themselves to the sea in other words let it go however it can go and 41 falling into a place where two seas met they ran to the ship ground and so now boom we're into the sand the waves are beaten on the ship and the soldiers council was to kill the prisoners lest any of them should swim out and escape but the centurion willing to save paul kept them from their purpose and commanded that um they which could swim should cast themselves into this first in the sea and get the land and the rest some on boards have broken off with the ship and so it came to pass that they escaped all safe to land okay so they're they're doing what they can to get to land that we can't sail no more ships in the stuck and um so in the last chapter here when they escaped they knew that the island was called melita and the barbarous people showed us no little kindness in other words they were very nice to us maybe these people come from nowhere and they've never you know they're just barbarians and they're very nice to us and so um they made a fire and received us and because of the present rain you know because of the cold and when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks so paul isn't just sitting there waiting for everybody to do things so he's in there with them helping get some sticks for this fire because you got 276 people plus the soldiers now the barbarians of the uh of the island and they're all you know kind of having a time there together so he's out there helping gather some sticks and um so in these sticks that he's gathering a snake comes out and grabs onto his arm now if you know if he ever been snake bit i haven't but it sounds like it's pretty bad and so um he gathers these uh sticks and when the barbarians saw that the venomous beast hung on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man's a murderer whom though he had escaped the sea vengeance vengeance is going to get him you know and so he shook off snake into the fire felt no harm how be it when they looked and saw that he wasn't swollen or fell down dead but after that they looked a great while and saw no harm they changed their minds and said oh he's a god you know 30 minutes before he's a murderer and now he's a god see how people can change in the same quarters of the um in the same quarters were possessions of a chief man of the island whose name was publius who received us lodged us for three days courteously yeah all 276 people i was like that crowd to come to your house you know and um it came to pass that the father of publius lay sick had a bad bad sickness paul entered in prayed laid his hands on him and healed him and when this was done others also which had diseases in the island came and were healed who also honored us with many honors and when we uh departed they laded us with many great things and uh after three months we they're there three months wow uh we found a ship going to alexandria and um they went on on their way well let's see here 14. when we found brethren okay so that they they came to um the uh area of of uh you know coast where rome was up up in the land a little bit uh we found brethren and we desire to tear with them days and so we started traveling towards rome and from thence when their brethren heard of us they came to meet us as far as the appian way still there and the three taverns wentz uh paul saw he thanked god and took courage okay so paul is going on his way towards rome okay and he's under house arrest for two years there during this time nero had a lot of problems with this government so from first timothy 1 and from romans 15 it's reasonable to think that paul was released and traveled as far as macedonia and also to spain he was later rearrested according to the historian eusebius and paul then was beheaded outside the city walls in public in the year 67. the actual details of the end of paul's life are unknown but there's a very beautiful church paul outside the walls we've been there many times and we have you know the letters that he's written throughout his ministry to his children in the gospel and they are a pirate part of the bible and if i ever get invited back we'll get into some of those letters so if you have time and nothing else to do some evening you can order a film from christian book distributors called paul apostle of jesus christ it's very factual it's very intense not for little children but it's the same thing we're talking about paul apostle of jesus christ and that's what it says on his tombstone so may god bless you thank you for your patience with me and uh we trust we can come back sometime soon there's a lot of places to go a lot of people in need but remember that anything different from what paul and william branham taught is seed of discrepancy just that simple no time to play games no time to well let's see if we can get along no seed of discrepancy and we're not in organized religion we're into scripture so may god bless you thank you i like holding swords that's wonderful i mean you enjoy that amen you know it's funny isn't it that i think too many times we speed read our bible you know instead of just taking a verse and looking at all that's in there and and you know and just take it in and you know i enjoyed that because you know as brother george talked about that time you know we saw that there was a political climate there was an economic economical climate there was many things going on all around and but yet the gospel still had its plan and its course and god was still making a way and you know that's amazing right you get arrested you get put on a boat go through a great big gigantic storm everybody survives you get on an island and then a healing campaign breaks out you know people are getting converted people are getting uh saved and you know in we believe that this is a restoration message you know and and that's that's what we leave out we we want the revival but we don't want the shipwreck you know what i mean we we want the we want to see all the mighty uh works done but we don't realize that that uh power apart from character is satanic you don't you don't understand that character comes from the fiery furnace of affliction you know you earn that character character is something that's earned you know what i mean it's something that that you come up against situations and you choose the christian way of doing things you cruise that you choose the christian attitude you choose a christ-like approach you take the humble side you you give up your rights and and you weigh the situation and you find out that it's uh it's not worth the argument or the fuss you know if you if many people uh in this age that we live in they want to sue everybody and you know so you get all upset in your spirit in everything and you run down to an attorney and peace and if he's attorney worth anything the first thing he'll sit there and tell you it's not worth the money you're gonna spend okay are you mad enough to spend thousand dollars and then people sit back and say well it's the principle no you know what i mean it it's not you know what i mean it's the ego and and so you you see that all down to this brother george is reading this at dc paul taking the humble side taking the humble side you know now if it would have been david mcgeary the story would have read like this david mcgary's upon the island and he escaped [Music] he ran for his life he hid in the barn you know what i mean he was out of there you know the first night the storm came he jumped overboard you understand but paul stuck with it you know as he was reading i said look at paul he's he he went to the next step and he went to the next step and he went to the next step he was being led of the spirit of the lord and you know and and that's part of the story he as he went through that the thing that struck me this morning is everybody's telling them don't go don't go don't go and they were speaking the truth you know this awaits you this awaits you but there must have been something else that was leading him that was moving in his heart and he stayed true to that you know what i mean and that's part of the character that was developed in him when you can stay true to something that's within your heart and not be swayed by all the opinion of the day or the spiritual movement of the day and you notice how brother george entitled it preaching from brother branham's absolute so that word was the absolute to paul even though people warned him what was ahead and the truth of what was ahead didn't deter him from what was in his heart and that's part of the character to be true to what's inside of you and we all believe the seed of god is in us and we believe that seed that was placed in us was placed in our heart because we were a part of the father in the beginning that's right and we're we are a part of that word and we were in his thinking and therefore he had and were an expression so he had a thought of us he knew what he called paul for when he met him on the road to damascus he knew he'd been wrong and didn't he say you'll find out the many things that you have to suffer for my namesake and so the whole god's plan totally unfolded in paul's life just the way it was predestinated that it unfold in paul life even until his end where he said i fought a good fight i run a good race now i go to receive the reward that waits for me the crown of righteousness that is laid up in heaven for me and and so i i i just think that when you think of that and and as brother george said that part of what i wanted to bring was to make it real to you you know and so it's no good to have religion which i think is the curse of denomination is to take religion out of our life and place it out here as a history and never see a living christ in our life every day in circumstances and situations and we're up so yeah we have a sickness that comes in to our assembly that happens but we also have a people that raise up in prayer you know we have trials and and and and tribulations but we have people that stand up and in a good spirit and a good conscience they don't trash their experience they don't trash their church they don't trash their life because they're going through a time of tribulation and trial they praise the lord all the more and you know and and so we see this character that's really being built in this book of acts so what we see is we see character and that's the only thing we'll take with us is our character so you know and that and peter writes don't think it's strange i mean look at all these trials and tribulations that paul went through you know i like par i like the parts of paul's life where he's on land and everything's good and he's having the meetings and fellowship but that was the smallest part of his life most of his life this guy was in prison you know he's in ships and wrecks and traveling and in bonds and everything you know i know everybody wants to be an apostle but they don't want to be a paul apostle you know if you know everybody wants to be a missionary and then that's where you get your suitcase you buy your first class ticket you fly somewhere and you stay in hilton and then you go to four or five meetings that are all designed and set up and they feed you and everything and now that's a new missionary no i'm sorry you know what i mean you can see the character that we need so when you get in your life and you hit in your situation god put you in your life where you're at the job you're in the circumstances you're in the trials you're in some of which we've brought upon ourselves some come upon us because of poor decisions some come upon us because of testing but remember some come upon us that because that we could be a witness that people can look upon our trial and see that you went through this trial with a smile you went through this trial with hope you went through this trial calling upon the name of the lord and therefore your candle is set upon a hill that it shines at light that all men can see your good works and glorify the father which is in heaven so you know you know in one place you sit back and you think well this is just simply going through the scriptures no there's a lot deeper revelation unfolding but tell you something you'll never hear it if first of all you don't open your heart to it and look for it you say is that scriptural seek and you shall find it knock and it shall be open unto you you know i pray for i sav that thou may see us so you know we've got to have that thirst and that hunger just say no wait a minute god sent brother george here and i feel he's led of the lord and and the the door opens for him and now he's been he's going to speak something to us you've got to sit back and say what's in that for me you know what's being said why what what because god is hidden in simplicity and revealed in the same and then you start reaching out and the more that you draw nigh unto him he'll draw an eye into you the more that you pray to have your eyes open the more you'll see the more you knock the more it'll be open to you and and and you understand these great uh these great lessons are to bring that character of christ in your life let this mind be in you that was also in the lord jesus amen that the works that i do you shall do also and this is what we want is we want that christ like life in our lives because of the same spirit that dwelt in jesus christ dwell in your mortal bodies it shall also quicken you and that's what we want we want to be quickened so understand in order to be quickened you've got to have character and in order to have character you're going to have to have testing and it's more precious than gold so you look at paul in the great ascension that he made it to become a writer of the new testament that was if i could say that acknowledgement and that esteem that's placed upon him as being the first church age messenger and the writer of the new testament was not given without a price and he was willing to pay the price in order to fit the reward and even with our own messenger you know his testimony to come to that place where he could take that position it didn't come without a price amen so you know you may not have to pay a price but you should always be willing to pay it that's up to god to what test that he wants to put you through but no matter what it is always open your heart and be willing and to take whatever comes your way take it with a christ-like spirit and with hope and with testimony on your lips that you're in the palm of god's hand and nothing can pluck you out so god bless you so what we're going to do is we're going to have billy come and and we're going to have moses sing some more songs and if if i can't get moses to move over here i'm going to wear him out when he's here amen you know i i'm hoping that i can get moses someday and sit down and visit with him and i know he feels a little call in his life and someday i'd like to have minister to us and just share some of the word and the things that are on his heart and uh and uh so billy if you'd come and you can just i'll put the management of brother moses into your hands and uh and we just hope that we just have a wonderful time don't don't you love it when moses sings in about 25 different languages so maybe we can set a a guinness book of world records the most language is saying in one song in the service but anyway we love you moses we love what you the spirit we feel from you the worship that we have brothers and sisters god bless you and i we won't be with you next week and i'm going to missouri with brother george and we don't know what's exactly ahead it might be one service might be two services but some of the believers are going and we're going to have good fellowship there and you'll have good fellowship here so we just trust that you're blessed this coming
