amen amen amen sister Jima has a special if she could come at this time is she here for um I was pretty nervous about sharing this song today it's a song the Lord put on my heart um sometime last year I've shared it once and um there's this Psalm Psalm 40 that kind of convicted me about sharing it here at church as well um I waited patiently and expectantly for the Lord and He inclined to me and heard My Cry he brought me up out of a horrible pit out of the myy clay and he set my feet upon a rock studying my footsteps and establishing my path he put a new song in my mouth a song of praise to our God many will see in fear and will trust confidently in the Lord blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust and does not regard the proud nor those who laps into lies many oh Lord my God are wonderful are the wonderful Works which you have done and your thoughts toward us there is none to compare with you if I would declare and speak of your wonders there would be too many to count sacrifice and meal offering you do not desire nor do you Delight in them you have opened my ears and given me the capacity to hear and obey your word burnt offering and sin offerings you do not require then I said behold I come to the throne in the scroll of the book it is written of me I Delight to do your will oh my God your law your law is within my heart and the verse that really um pushed me to sing this song was you have put a new song in my heart and so here it is [Music] [Music] I will open your word I will trust and Obey I will cast on my cares you care for me you quiet my soul you soften in my heart you heal my body renew my spirit You Are God Alone from Before Time began you are seated on your throne you are worthy to be praised so I give you all my praise I give you all my worship I praise your Holy Name You Are God Alone sorry I'm really nervous and my hands are shaking But You Are God Alone from Before Time began you are seated on your throne you are worthy to be praised so I give you all my praise I give you all my worship I praise your Holy Name You Are God Alone I will open your word I will trust and Obey I will cast all my cares you care for me you quiet my soul you soften my heart you heal my body renew my spirit You Are God Alone from Before Time began you are seated on your throne you are worthy to be praised so we give you all our praise we give you all our worship we praise your Holy Name You Are God Alone thank [Applause] you hallelujah amen let me say this his love for us is more than we can ever understand amen and he knows he says my sheep hear my voice when he calls out you will hear amen amen man we have some announcements and request uh where the griver rights we want to thank the Lord Jesus for another year in the life of our son uh David Abraham is a great miracle in our lives uh uh in our lives that the Lord Jesus Christ has given amen certainly want to wish David happy birthday amen is such a wonderful and happy boy if you ever seen him around amen but Joel writes God bless you brother and sisters uh uh baby Mia was released from the hospital yesterday and said thank you all for your praise amen hallelujah the god of Miracles amen amen another brother jel writes please pray for my brother uh my brother el el edalo uh he's traveling to Mexico today that may God be with him uh the entire way so we just want to keep him in prayer and and I know that uh many are not here today and but an Neville text me and the family that uh they had a sick baby and they couldn't make it but a Beno I was trying to have him lead songs this morning because I still didn't feel like I recovered and I called him and it was out completely and not feeling well and I know but Tim Sal is not well and there's so many that are not well and some are even here so we know we just want to ask that the Lord will reach out and touch your body and touch those that are sick and make him well amen it's a promise to the believer amen that he's he he was shed he he shed his blood for our sins and and it came in the scripture says that it's by his stripes that we are healed and we can stand and say that God touch our bodies if you have a need upon your heart just lift your hand out to him this morning and amen he knows what you have in your heart and he knows the desires and but Matthew if you could just come and take these needes before the church and so good to see him back him [Music] amen the brothers that are taking the offerings if you can also be ready amen [Music] amen let's just go before the Lord Lord we just take this time during the service to bring the tithes and offerings before you Lord we thank you that you've given us an opportunity to give back lord you gave all yes and you ask just a little Lord of these Earthly things that you've blessed us with to show our love back to you so Lord we thank you for this opportunity to give Lord and we know that when we give with a loving heart and obedience to your word Lord we could never outgive you Lord may it just become a greater Revelation in our heart Lord of what it truly means to give and we know Lord that you'll take these tithes and these offerings and Lord you'll use it to further your kingdom and Lord those that don't have or those that feel the strain Lord may they just fully surrender to you and your word and know that just like that lady who gave the might she gave the greatest Lord even though it looked like she gave the least but you recognized and you saw it Lord and so you wrote of her and she was blessed so Lord we commit those tithes into thy hands Lord and also as we come before you Lord there's many needs and spiritual and physical but father when you went to Calvary and you said it is finished Lord and we can look into your word and know that by your stripes we are already healed we've been taught Lord to want to have a purpose for healing Lord I think of certain ones that are sitting in our mid Lord they've been believing for certain promises Lord and think of Hannah how she purposed that Lord you'd give her a child and her purpose was that that child would be given unto you Lord all of the healing and everything that we're believing for we give it unto you father for a wellbody we'll serve you with all of our heart Lord for our lost loved ones that'll come into the kingdom Lord that they'll give you all of their heart Lord there's many needs Lord and we all by faith want to start walking into that well body father not to just be well to serve the world Lord but to be well to be a great witness Lord to be well to further your kingdom Lord we're not believing for Natural Things Lord we're believing for the supernatural Lord that you would have your will and your way Lord for we know that Divine Healing is just the earnest of the body change Lord and soon and very soon we're going to be changed in a twinkling of an eye Lord to meet you in the air Lord so may we start living for that father may we wake up with that purpose upon our heart a purpose of serving you Lord a a purpose of of giving all to you being a true lamb that's led by your spirit Lord I think of uh brother Joe Green a minister who's had a heart attack Lord you've already moved on the scene and he's stabilized but yet Lord we lift him up before you again Lord we just love you father we're looking for a great move lord of the supernatural in our midst this morning not something that that could be gauged by the senses Lord but something that's gauged by Faith Lord that this mind would be in US Lord that we can we can move into a realm into the supernatural into Heavenly places which is our position father where we can possess all things Lord for we know that this is the hour of the Overcomer this is the hour of the bright age Lord and may we just believe for it all Lord knowing that you've made it all available to us Lord we pray and just give all things to to you now thanking you giving you the praise Lord may may we just even start to praise you now for the manifestation Lord may we start to praise you now for the healing may we start to praise you now for the the prodical sons and daughters that are coming home may we start praising you now for the healing of our brothers and sisters may we just start watering the word with our praise and say thank you Lord thank you for healing my body thank you for bringing my brother and my sister home thank you for giving them the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus thank thank you for confirming your word Lord thank you for meeting us here

from God how rich how the ch oh Father Lord you first loved us that's why we love you Lord you had us in your heart and in your mind ever before there was a star and you loved us and you claimed us and you said this is mine father you brought us here that we could come to know you and love you and serve you and be what you would have us to be father may we just become so humble in that love that you have father May the love of God be shed abroad in our heart by your Holy Spirit we ask each one this morning Father that you would meet their particular need their particular challenge father that you would stand with them in battle for we have an enemy that goes about like a roaring line that seeking whom you may devour but we have this promise that he who is in US is greater than he who is in the world we ask you to bless the people this morning in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen God bless you we uh as you open your Bibles uh it it turn uh to Ephesians the fourth chapter uh we do have a couple uh small announcements um that we'd like to make if um um and uh so some of the things that uh we want to do if you would help us now we we we need your help so that uh you got to realize that so um if you could come when you come to church you know come in as far as you uh can to the front and sit and uh fill in any spots that you can do and and help us um um so just make it easier and uh for that and uh for everybody so we'll give you that and also um what we want to do is we want we don't want to have any eating in this uh building so mothers if you want to give your children cookies or peanut butter sandwiches or hot dogs or in church uh go over to the fellowship hall so the fellowship hall will be open for uh feeding children so so like in the nurseries don't don't feed your kids and that we have a nursing nursery for nursing mothers but when your kids are old enough to eat and chew and then go over into the uh uh Fellowship Hall they'll have a table set up over there you can go in there and if you want to sleep um no more sleeping in the fouryear so if you uh come and you need to take a a nap during service if you would go over to the forer I mean over to the fellowship hall and you can uh lay your head on the table and sleep over there I think that's a wonderful [Music] compromise don't you so you can still come to church and sleep I I think that's great I think that's as kind and as gentle now now George Smith he said he'd throw a a level at you or something but I I won't call you out or nothing so you just cooperate you come to church and I really don't want to be in here it's I'm really tired so I would rather lay down I said well praise God just go next door and lay your head on the table and and and there you said I I want to eat I'm go next door and eat that's what it's there for we put it there for you and I think that's wonderful so if you would do that if you would help us in that that way we can keep uh the house of the Lord uh uh for worship and and the word of God so let's just read this uh uh this verse in uh Ephesians the 4th chapter and um and and this uh just kind of rose up on my heart here just a little bit ago but uh it fit in with the some of the things that I'm been on my heart it says I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called great scripture so that's what we're all here striving to do this morning is to walk worthy of the Gospel is your life worthy of the Gospel with all liness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love I want you to notice there again the unity the forbearing one another one another you're going to find out there's a lot in the word of God about one another forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace peace so we see that there is a Unity of the spirit so we see there there's Unity there is one body one Spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling so we all have one hope of our calling uh one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all somebody told me that proof that Paul was a dexon and in you all so but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ and he says and wherefore he said when he ascended up on high he led captive captivity and gave gifts unto men Our Father we ask you to bless us in your precious name we pray amen you may be seated this [Music] morning my a heart's desire if I could uh Express that you know somebody was talking me to the other day and um they were uh they made the comment they said uh brother McGary you're a Visionary and uh I didn't know what that that meant or what they they were saying and uh because I'm not one to have like what people would think of Visions you know what I mean so ma automatically in my thinking I would think that you have a vision you know what I mean but what they what they say is simple is that some people can look at something and visualize and see something in its place like I can take a set of blueprints and it might be just lines and everything but I can actually visualize it or I can see it or I if I when we uh built this building uh we knew what we wanted to accomplish we could see what it was going to look like what it was going to be like what we tried to do so that's something that you have in your heart you're you're you're made that way uh and some people they they can draw things and you know what I mean and so they can put it in visually um but you you just have that and so you find out that your life is driven by you you see a picture in front of you what that it is you want to build what that it is that you want the result to be and you can see the result ahead of you and you're driven to uh the accomplishment of that result so uh it's becomes a drive in you you look and you know you see a piece of property and and cuz I'm a builder and I said that you know I want to build a house here and I got what it looks like and I sit down with the guy and we draw it and I said put this here this and we want this and and it's just it's very Vivid to me and very real and in my heart you know I I was thinking that the last uh year just the other day uh we finished uh with the little building in the back and we finished with the uh Pavilion now alls we have is just a couple little sidewalks to build and and and we're done and the vision of the building is complete so I thought well you know there's not much to build eventually I like to put in a fire nice fire pit in a fireplace and and another little place you know and and and that's down the road but now we've accomplished this and my vision then I I noticed my vision was turning to no longer the building but a vision of the inhabitants of the building what is it that we want to be uh what is the desire uh that we have uh for the body of Believers what body do we want to be what is it what is it that that uh your the vision that I have and and uh that's driving me and I begin to uh begin to be so moved to the fact that uh first of all I want our characteristic to be that we love one another amen that that uh there's something that I believe that God is is Desiring and that he wants uh uh for the church and I'd like to just uh maybe uh read this to you because it kind of expresses the vision that I have so there's something that I see in the word of God and I want it for us I want us to be this kind of people I want us to be this kind of church I want us to have this kind of atmosphere this kind of care one for another and I want it to be the the the love and the care that's from the word of God and I want us to really be established in the scriptures and in the word of God to have scripture and to have uh they have the the substance of the word of God and and for above that we want to be a people of faith and without faith is impossible to believe God and we just don't want a couple of people having faith we want everybody to have faith we we we want to be one body one mind one God above us all one God in us all you know and and uh with this care one for another with this a feeling apart we don't want anybody to feel for any instance that that they're not a part of the body because of their age because of their look because of their background we preached a sermon in Africa called the Journey of the seed and we wanted the people to understand it doesn't matter where you come from or or or the ground that's not what's important it's the seed that what was important and and so it could be in any kind of ground so your background might be terrible that doesn't keep you from being a part of the body you know you you you may uh not be the most uh I don't even know how to say it because you know people are so body orientated anymore you know what's beautiful and what's not and all this but we don't want looks to to be able to determine you to be a part of the body we want our part of the body to be because our hearts are in one mind and one Accord with one calling and and with one goal and we we talked about that last week a little bit about how that uh that uh uh teamwork had all these qualities then we talked a week before about success in the individual has all these qualities and we found out every single one of those is in the scripture because the body was something that God had instituted you understand so you're you're you in order for you to really please God you have to be the institution that God made you as an individual and follow the scriptures of success for your individual success and then God poked that individual members in particular put them in a body and then that body has got the function together with one Accord we have to come in the right Spirit we've got to come in the in one Accord believing that that we're hearing the word of God believing and and and having faith and and so the this Unity that the Lord is that the vision that's on my heart so we've built the building now we have a vision for the occupancy we couldn't really work on the occupancy until we had the building to put the occupancy in to to to work on and and I need working on so this isn't just you this is us you understand it's not uh it's not uh we only have one I am you know the rest of us is we are yeah and so this is what he is and so this is what the prophet of God is and this is just one little statement out of the message um uniting time and sign but he said God is uniting his bride she is coming together from the East and the west from the North and South there is a uniting time and that's on right now what she uning for the Rapture Hallelujah that's right right so we what's what is the one hope of Our Calling The Rapture amen what is our vocation to help one another make it right amen God's getting her ready yes sir uniting what is she uniting with with the word for all the heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away she's uniting herself with thus saith the Lord regardless of what any denomination or anybody else says she's uniting herself she's getting ready well you know we've always thought of getting ready I've got to get ready I've got to get ready you know well you know how that is but how about he said she is getting herself ready we are getting ourselves ready we as a church so what our vision is is we want to be a ready Church a ready people that there be no sissons among you no divisions among you no bitterness among you no gossip Among Us no big eyes or little ears but in one mind in one spirit and one Accord they all came together and when they got there they were endued with power from on high and and so and and we're going to talk about faith and we're going to talk about power that that's what we want to have we want to be a church of faith and power that's our vision but there's a way to get there and she's made herself ready and so he's uniting her and putting her on a course and she said she she's getting ready why she is the bride that's right and she's United herself with her bridegroom and the bridegroom is the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and the church and the bride and the word is becoming one until every word itself is working out the works of the bridegroom okay now this isn't a me challenge see we've always made it a a a you challenge you get yourself ready you you you you you and everybody's doing their own thing and and there's no you know that's not the beauty of it the beauty of it is when we as a body unite ourselves with the word and we are all of us in here together performing the desire of the bridegroom that's your takes makes it beautiful don't it and this is so he says it he says word itself and is working out the work of the bridegroom amen you see it the uniting not no more join the church not no no more of this but flee from everything and tith to Jesus Christ see it's the uniting time God uniting his bride together bringing it back to just exactly uniting the words of his promise right so I mean that's a great vision now we want to absolutely delve in and that's what we've been doing for the last week this is a vision of people that love one another care one for another have their hearts and Minds on one another so our our question now is how do we get there how do you have that Unity how how do we come in to that a place where when you walk into the church you're not walking with complexes you're not feeling you're being judged uh you're you're you you you you're not wondering about what people think you're not wondering if you're a part I mean it's it's even better than a having a a ticket to an event you know we we we like classical music I couldn't tell you A C from a d but I loved going to classical music I love to watch the orchestra brother Ram talked about the orchestra and you I had tickets for a long time and I knew where my seat was and I could walk in that front door of that place my shoulders back I'm a member of the symphony Society of Fort Worth I have tickets well I had to pay for those tickets okay so just to be honest I bought the right to do that but somebody else bought the right for us to do it but I could walk down and take my seat and sit right there and enjoy every bit of what was being presented and I could stand up at the end and go bravo bravo how could sit in there and be moved to tears why I had a right and that's our goal we don't want to leave any one behind we don't want anybody to don't feel that they're a part of this we want everybody to know they're called everybody to know they're elected and everybody to know that they've been ued with power from on high and this scripture keeps rolling through my heart and my life and it's found I I think it's St John 5 and 24 course I'm I'm not I should have it memorized by now but it says herein is the love of God made perfect as he is so are we in this world not so am I so are we now can you imagine every single one of us caring one for another members in particular fitted and joined together no no doubt if you had a bad week you know I got a place of Refuge I got a body of Believers I'm going to get there I'm going to walk in the church and I'm going to make my spirit right father forgive me I'm going to cry ABA father I'm going to confess my sins and he's going to be faithful and just to forgive me and I can place myself under the blood of the Lamb cleanse from all righteousness I can get in the spirit and say Lord I'm here to pull I'm here to push I'm here to be there for my brother and sister I'm here to cor to uh uh have the right atmosphere and to be a contributor to the body of Christ we want to get rid of these things you know we don't want you know we don't want people coming to the house of God and sitting down and then after word say you know the brother didn't even recognize me oh I didn't well the reason I didn't is probably because somebody above me didn't amen when you come in here with that kind of attitude or that kind of atmosphere if you get under conviction it's not he's putting me under conviction he's stepping on my toes well maybe your toes are too long maybe you need a pedicure you know what I mean so you don't say oh he said you say Thank you Lord I Want to Be Right right every son and daughter is chastised thank you Lord I know brother doesn't know me he he doesn't know me from anybody else this is you talking to me Lord okay this everybody in here loves me everybody else is is remembers that they were saved from sin also that's what he says it says if you don't have these things you forgot that you too once were saved from sin and and and we don't we come out of our shells we come out of our own individual Little Lives of just trying to pay our bills and and we start to come to the place that we we understand our life and the part of the puzzle that we are a part of is bigger and above this world and God placed you where you are for a purpose that's right and and it's imperative for the Fulfillment of the word of God for the preparation of the Rapture for us to come into this Unity when one with another don't count yourself out so that's my vision and we want to start pursuing that road of a church that's in Union with one another and every member is filled with the power of the Holy Spirit and they have the faith to use it and so we want to play for you this morning uh 15 minutes just 15 minutes out of the message perfect faith and we're talking about a condition of the called to deciples hallu okay so these men were elected and chosen okay then that's what the scripture says you didn't choose me I chose you so anybody who's in here and you think you're in here by your own free will really it don't work that way right you know it might be for some but but for the elect you understand they they're the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord so if God leads you someplace else if you were to leave this body to go someplace else I would want you to be everything in that body that you were in this body that's right so wherever you were you represent the unity that you have in Christ Jesus so our election is sure and the scripture says make your election sure okay this is where we find the disciples in this story they prayed for a leopard and nothing got done and the bo the father brought the child to Jesus and said your disciples couldn't do it and the reason they couldn't is they were in a condition so it's not the question today whether he can we all know he can can that's right how many understand that there's nobody in here that doesn't believe that God can do anything we believe that but it's not that he can he wants to get the he can to the you can okay that's what and he wants you as an individual to know that that is your God given right not earned but he elected Chosen and given and he departed gifts unto men he led captive captivity captive and he gave gifts unto men so this this is where we're picking the story up G and the prophet of God of the next 15 minutes is going to talk about positioning he's going to talk about faith he's going to talk about a few little things and then we just going to just go just a little bit out of here and and let's start rising up I I I think it might be in here that he makes this statement right uh in the beginning uh see if he if this is the one but there's a place that he says the church has got to pull itself up by its bootstraps amen so God bless you this morning uh uh let's go forward and this is where I wanted to be last week and I know I got a I I started trying to cover a few things but I'm back on track so enjoy this uh next 15 minutes as we uh uh listen to our messenger trying to build in US perfect faith that we can be a perfect Church in perfect unity and God bless you I I want you to get this now we the church has got to lift itself in the power of God how we're too close to the end now and I believe the church is in condition where we can teach it a little deeper things and rub some of this make belief out see you get into something real see it's got to be something that you know if you say U uh brother brandom uh that isn't a light yet I know it's a light how do you know it's I'm looking at it well how do you know you could be wrong my sight has always declared to me that that was life see and that's the reason I believe those Visions because it's always declared to me the truth because it comes from the word amen then if he says it that settles it now when it's declared like that there's no more Guess Word it's going to be then you hear it th fath the law see because it's it's Beyond in human thinking it's up into the reals of the Lord's thing but you're standing here just as a Vine just as a branch producing the fruit that's in the vine see God uses man and man only God doesn't use Machinery God doesn't use groups of man God doesn't use organization God uses individuals always now Faith is the substance and by it we understand all those things to done it's not a it's not a inag ination it is a substance especially perfect Faith that's what I'm talking on tonight getting to perfect faith it is not an imagination now other that people come say oh I got all Faith oh I sure have or you stand here for this see see your your very actions prove that you haven't got what you're talking about see if you had Faith then what you stand the prayer line for see what do you do these things for see if you had perfect Faith you'd look right straight at God and believe it and walk away you would you would have no need of coming into a prayer you'd have no need of these things because your faith is done made it so am see what would be the use for me saying I got to put a shirt on I got a shirt on how do you know you got a shirt on well I see it feel it and I know it's there well that's just how real that when perfect Faith takes the whole there you don't need no more praise God it's already done you know it hallelujah how do you know it Faith tells me so amen that's it see do you get it now what I mean that's perfect Faith now other words I'm venturing out well I'll go the Bible say call the Elders let them know pray over I know I'll go and you said well I'm going to be he see you're making yourself if don't watch how you go to make yourself just just worked out then when he pass you you say oh I I still don't feel see there he was you didn't have faith your genuine faithful do it right there your your genuine faith will make it so real to you that look at that little woman with the blood issue she said if I can we're going to stop for a moment uh the books didn't line up so we're going to go back and find uh where that it is that we want to start okay so we can can follow it through cuz if he's going to be way ahead of me and uh then I'm really going to be stuck you know what I'm saying because uh but so we'll just we'll just we want to get it right and uh uh get it so uh I I sometimes uh some of the books don't line up in the paragraphs so it's not the brothers in the back's fault so uh I think Gary's back there with the book and he's going to get them U uh to the right spot on on the tape so anyway one of the things that we want to entitle our sermon this morning is untapped resources so uh that's where uh the where that we're going is with untapped resources the things that are available to us that were not using and uh so just to jump ahead while they're getting ready uh to say it this way so uh we know that all things are possible that's that's what that we want to understand is that all things are possible and and uh uh and uh so he he makes this statement in Hebrews uh if we could just read this in Hebrews uh uh 5 and and uh uh 14 he says he says he in 13 He says for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he's a babe that's right right but what this is where we're wanting to go but strong meat belongeth to them that are full of age right even those who by reason of the use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil for by the reason of use have their senses exercised so did you did were you able to find that spot so you you've got it right where so uh I didn't hear then wait till I get my book back so I can U make sure that uh it it follows along I I'm still blind in one eye so you're going to have to bear with me for a while it the paragraphs line up with David okay they line up I did it's my fault then all right so uh this is what I wanted to make sure I want to get this now the church has got to lift itself up in the power of God we are too close to the end now I believe the church is in condition where we can teach it little deeper things and rub some of this make believe out and get in get into something real and and so uh we wanted uh we definitely wanted to to uh lay that in there and then this is another quote right before we'll just pick right back up where they were you guys bear with me he says now faith is based on forgiveness and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see Apostolic times moving among us and that's what we all hunger and it's just Ling right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it we want it to to we want it such a flow that it will help it'll be a help to us and flow out to others okay so yeah you forgive me for the interruption the Lord forgive me uh for the interruption and but I never want to interrupt the prophet so uh thank you brother it's my fault God bless you I want you to get this out we the church has got to lift itself in the power of God how we're too close to the end now and I believe the church is in condition where we can teach it a little te things and rub some of this make belief out see you get into something real see it's got to be something that you know if you say um uh brother brandom uh that isn't a light yet I know it's a light how do you know it's a light I'm looking at it well how you know you could be wrong my sight has always declared to me that that was life he and that's the reason I believe those Visions because it's always declared to me the truth B it comes from the word amen then if he says it that settles it now when it's declared like that there's no more guess where it's going to be then you hear it thus sayth the LA see because it's it's beyond the human thinking it's up into the Realms of the Lord's thinking but you're standing here just as a Vine just as a branch producing the fruit that in the vine see God uses man and man only God doesn't use Machinery God doesn't use groups of man God doesn't use organization God uses individuals always now Faith is the substance and by it we understand all those things to done it's not a it's not a imagination it is a substance a especially perfect Faith that's what I'm talking on tonight getting to perfect faith it is not an imagination now other just people come say oh I got all Faith oh I sure have well you stand here for see see your your very actions prove that you haven't got what you're talking about see if you had Faith then what you stand the prayer line for see what do you do these things for see if you had perfect Faith you look right straight to God and believe it and walk away you would you would have no need of coming into a prayer life you'd have no need of these things because your faith is done made it Soul see what would be the use for me saying I got to put a shirt on I got a shirt on how do you know you got a shirt on or I see it feel it and I know it's that well that's just how real that when perfect Faith takes a hold there go you don't need no more praise God already done you know it hallelujah how do you know it Faith tells me Soul amen that's it see do you get it now what I mean that's perfect Faith now other words I'm venturing out well I'll go the Bible say call the Elders let them know pray over I know I'll go and and you said well I'm going to be he see you're making yourself don't watch how you go to make yourself just just worked out then when he pass you you say oh I I still don't feel see there you was you didn't have faith your genuine faith will do it right there your your genu faith will make it so real to you that look at that little woman with the blood issue she said if I can only touch the border of His Garment I'll be made well and as soon as she did it she said she felt within herself that her blood issues stop she actually believed it and when she touched it to prove that stop stop Jesus turned and said who touched me that's perfect faith and that same perfect Faith tonight will touch Jesus Christ just as it did then the woman come with a perfect faith for that time now now we see at first the disciples didn't have this perfect Faith they didn't have it because they had Christ walking with him but then afterward Christ was in that amen and so you see it's hard then I have this perfect faith without the Holy Spirit it has to bring it it does now you say the disciples didn't have perfect Faith No or they had an epileptic child there that they were trying to cast this devil out of him and they couldn't do it and the father seen Jesus coming and he said we have brought my son to to your disciples and they could not cure him see and afterwards the disciples asked Jesus saying why could not we cure him and Jesus said because of the lack of faith am of your unbelief that's right because of your unbelief that's I remember they had the power Jesus had given them power to heal the sick to raise the dead and cast out Devils just a few days before that yeah they had the power but not the Fai to use the power now there's the Brandon Tabernacle there's the church the bride today the holy spirit is here with the power amen but you haven't got that Faith to mve it amen see what I mean amen amen it takes Faith to move it here I got a shell that I hand loaded I know what it you by Ballistic like the word but I've got to fire the gun the fire has to get to the powder the powder's got the power but got to have the fire to light it off and the same thing that pow is in the Shell but it needs ba to charge it and throw it out that's what it takes see perfect Faith to ignite the power of the Holy Spirit which we have now since he's come upon us amen Faith to ignite the seed great things is to the faith something that presents it to you with a heart full of joy you walk into the sick room knowing exactly what you're going to say walk in there and know what's going to happen something's already been revealed and you know it you walk in in the name of Jesus Christ rise up from there just say the Lord there you are that's perfect Fai if there' be 10 million people standing there say it wouldn't happen you know it's going to Happ many because you know it it's going to happen regardless what anybody else says you're the one got the faith good you imagine Joshua he called the Elders of Israel together and said uh brethren we are the Servants of the Lord I would like for you to say ask the Lord if to be all right if uh if he give us a little more sunlight see and hold a son a little while no he had need of it without prayer without anything he had need of it and he just commanded the son he said stand there I have need and I'm in the service of the Lord and he sent me over here to do this job and I'm doing the best I don't know how the enemy is routed and they're out in here if I let if sun goes down they'll get together and cause me more trouble so stand still as soon you hang there amen he man she hung there for 24 hoursall now if the world's turning it holds it up and the sun stay in the place and it don't run what happened then amen that's right now you make yourself an Infidel if you say this and then if you don't you show do fo of science cuz they say the world stop and drop now what if you say God's word's not right then you're inent but it happened that's the main thing I don't know the mechanics of it but it happened I don't know the mechanics of the Holy Ghost but I know it fell on me I can't tell the mechanics of it but I know the blessings of it that's all I care to know about is the blessings of the Holy Ghost and mechanics Hew say that's his secret this boy cannot be healed because the disciples had power Jesus gave them power to heal all manner of sickness to cast out Devils to cleanse the lepers and to raise the dead yes amen he gave them power but they didn't have faith to operate the power that they had and then they questioned Jesus and said well now why couldn't we do it now remember they had the word and the Word was flesh thing and the word told them I give you power amen amen I give you power and they had the power but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in that amen see what I mean yeah but Jesus had it he was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen amen said oh bring in here how long will I suffer yet he had Faith with his power how did he he said I can do nothing in myself why he relied upon what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word and he had faith in God who made him the word he was God the word and it was in him that giving Faith because he understood his position he known what he was because the scripture had said he was it and you're every scripture Tien to prove that he was exactly what the script scure said he would be and he knew what he was therefore he relied upon what God had made him amen and if he did that then can't we rely upon what God made us as Believers these signs shall follow them that believe Hallelujah he had faith and what he was and if you are a Believer you have faith in what you are you are believer and if you got faith in God the Bible says over here and if our U if our hearts condemn us then we can't have faith but if our hearts don't condemn us then we have faith we have confidence towards God if you want to read that found St John 3:21 I got the scripture written down there now notice St I mean 1 John 3:21 uh notice if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence towards God but as long as you're doing things that's wrong you can't have confidence towards God so you see you can you automatically know that you're wrong you automatically put yourself back here a sinner by knowing that you're wrong but when your heart don't condemn you and you know you are a Believer and there's nothing between you and God you can ask what you will and know that it'll be given amen because it's the word that's given to you just like it was to those dis time now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are amen have faith in what the word says you are and Jesus had faith in the word of God that said what he was it is written of me didn't David in the Psalms and the prophets and all of them speak of him I am the bread of life that come from God out of Heaven amen I am the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden I am all these things I am that I am and he knew with that perfect faith that he was the anointed Messiah that the spirit of God was upon on him he said now I myself do nothing but it's my faith in God and God was in him the word made manifest and when the word of God comes in you it's made manifest or you are a Believer see and a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you you like that am I like when you I like teaching before the how to what faith really is knowing who he was without a shadow of doubt he knew he was the son of God he knew it for the word identifi the word of God identified who he was he said if I do not the works of my father then don't believe me but if if I don't do them Works don't believe me but if I do then believe the works for they are the Manifest word promise or if you can just wake up to that a minute you see the word itself identify who you are and he said who can condemn me of sin in other words who can show me that my life and my Works don't fulfill exactly what Messiah should do nobody can say nothing for he was and he had Faith to believe that whatever he said it would happen then he turned around and said the works that I do shall you also a little while the world seeth no more yet you shall because I'll be with you even in you take no thought what you shall say for it's not you to speak it's that father that dwelleth in you he's one does the speaking and it's not me it's the father that dwelleth in me he doth the work see what I mean now the identification of a scripture Christian these words said Jesus these sign shall follow them that believe now how can you call yourself a believer of people and deny those words am how can you call yourself a Believer and deny any of this world you can't do it you're not a Believer therefore SS can't follow because you just accept what you want to believe and let the rest of it you want don't believe it but you got to take the whole thing and believe that's amen and when you truly believe not make believe but really believe then these signs follow them that believe oh could you compare Christians today with them Christians of Longo how them disci walked in the power of the spirit moved by the Holy Ghost to go just a prisoner as I preached on the other night a prisoner to the word and will of God he couldn't even move until God moved would you like to see a church rise like that it's going to it's got to come not trying it's it's on this road now I believe for the word identified identified himself what he was and the same word identifies us see if a man loves me he keeps my Commandments and if he says he loves me keeps not my Commandments that's all of them he's a liar the truth not even any you say well I don't believe well then that you're just not a Believer that's all if the Bible said so that makes it right amen Eternal what the Bible says is the truth no did you all digest all that and believe every word of it well then go in the Rapture that's pretty good okay simple that we just just this is what he said and he said he said oh could you compare a Christian today day with them Christians of long ago right and what are we to be returned back to the Faith of Our Father the confidence Jesus told them you have not chosen me I have chosen you they had confidence in that Silver and Gold Have I None but that which I have I give to you they have confidence in that they accepted their position they accepted who that they were and they accepted what that he had done for them it wasn't based on any of themselves is that was based on what he said and and then he just so this is where we're headed he says Longo how them disciples walked in the power of the spirit moved by the Holy Spirit to do it just a prisoner as I preached the other night a prisoner to the word and the will of God he couldn't even move until God moved him wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that amen wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that I would you know all of us start applying the token to our homes all of us starting apply the token all of us up get up in the morning and start our there with prayer all of us reading our Bible making Melody to hymns and songs in our heart you you know what I mean letting the joy of the Lord fill our lives you say wait a minute you know it it just seems anymore that our our gospels become so negative it's all about struggle we don't care about struggle we're Overcomers it's given to him that over comes let the struggles come right we've got the strugg Le solver you know think it not strange at the fiery darts of the enemy think is not strange when since when did we get to the place that we need the bed of ease to be our Vindication Samson he he all of a sudden a thousand Philistines show up oh the Phil are upon you he just grabbed whatever he could get a hand on right and believed God and went to slay in Philistines and when one of those Philistines shows up in your life step back and say you Philistine I had a brother that knocked one of you out you old Goliath I had a brother that knocked one of you out I am a part of the word of God I am the Church of the Living God I've been called of this hour to knock you out well Satan knew that he had a long range plan the prophet of God said Satan had a long range plan on you he threw his hooks in you maybe when you were a child got an addiction on you got a complex on you got a temper on you got to mess with your brain well you know people that don't have what we have go to psychologist they go to psychiatrist they go to the medicine cabinet they do everything that they can and I say do it but if you ever come to the place and you're laying on that couch and all of a sudden it Dons on you wait a minute that's a devil and I'm a Son of God and in my father's house are many mansions I'm going to get out of this couch even a servant in My Father's House lives better I'm not going to be under this no more I'm going to go to my father and I may say father will you receive me and what did he do he restored him back as a son with full power and authority and a robe this is what he said wouldn't you like to have a church rise up like that it's going to going back it's got to come is that right it's on the road now well it might have taken us 20 years to get here because we've tried everything to produce it instead of letting it happen and his time in his season by his word We've ran after this movement We've ran after this movement we've tried to call down this anointing and we've tried to call that down anointing we've tried to produce we tried to produce we tried to produce but the Sheep Bears wool so they had the power right so we understood that they they had the power but they didn't have the faith to use the power you think that we have the power let just talk about power for just a second there's a lot of definitions of power but one of the definitions that that I like let me see if I can find it right here quickly power is the cap capacity or ability to directly influence the behavior of others and the course of events that's what power is power has the ability to affect the course of events power has the ability to affect the behavior of others when that epileptic came up to Jesus and and was casting his uh self in the fire when the demons came up when leprosy came up the he had the power to change the course of that event or the he had the capability of influence the behavior of the person now just think of that power apart from character is satanic right but Power with character real power with character really to affect someone's life or the course of events for the right purpose by exercise of discernment knowing the difference become of Good and Evil by reason of exercise that you can actually know that you can have an effect on a person's life now that's the kind of Faith he's talking about Faith Masters every circumstance it Masters the circumstance it doesn't matter what the circumstance is Faith activates the power to change the course of events amen that's what it is now he's you say well he said individual it is individuals it's you have got to have your faith your power you've got to to to possess it and then you take what you are and the Holy Spirit fits and joins you to together with other believers of like Faith because if two or three of you agree on any one thing it'll come to pass so now it becomes it becomes the the the recognition that you've got the power well it's a whole lot of difference if you don't know you've got the power first of all you've got to to know you've got the power before you can find the faith to use it you can't have faith to try to move something you don't believe you have I don't care what it is see the first thing that Satan does he says power is is all you know all things are possible right so the first thing we think is sickness demon right we don't think about daily circumstances in our lives we don't think about the ability the the power to master Mass Master every circumstance to be aware of it just to be aware of it right to be aware oh this person I'm going to go visit this person and you know maybe you got an interview man this guy's a he's a real Hornet's Nest praise God you're aware right right what do you know about hornets nests you don't poke the Hornets Nest let them Buzz around thank you Lord be still thank you Lord know that I'm God right you're in control that's right God's with me I don't have to compromise I don't have to change if God wants me to have this job I'll get this job if it's my heart's desire the Lord said he'd give me my heart's desire that's right all these other things you master the circumstance but you've got to know that you've got the power to do that Jesus knew he had the power but do we know that we have the power I'll just read some quick scriptures here to you and these are uh just to let you understand that the disciples and and our fathers before us they believed Timothy said for the God hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind that that's our description he said but he said acts 1 and8 but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samar and the utmost parts of the earth Philippians 4:13 I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me not we don't even do the little things we've got so bigm minded and so spectacular that we don't even let faith and power work in our daily life we should be living by the power of God we live by faith we live by trust we live by what every word of God that proceedeth out of his mouth that's what we live by we we're not called to be afraid of the paycheck we're not called to be afraid afraid of the society we're not called to be afraid of the government we're called to believe yes sir in fact even above that we've been chosen to believe faith is our inheritance we're joint hires with him but we just just for a little bit this morning morning we'll close quickly so he he goes on to say here he says I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthened me enemy and nothing shall be any means hurt you nothing by any means will hurt you oh my goodness can you actually think all of a sudden you all the camps of there's chariots and kings and armies all around you and you look up and say oh Master what are we going to do open his eyes Lord open this boy's eyes there's more with us than is with them Glory amen and the boy's eyes get open and there's Chariots of Fire everywhere well I know if he would have been like me I'd have sat back and wait for the battle right but God works in what mysterious ways they just walked right through them unrecognized see faith just walks it believes the these things it's it's all about you he died for you it's about you being his son and his daughter it's why the prophet again says you know someone asked me what the other day says did I offend you and I I just simply say if you offended me you know it I don't have to know it for it to be off fence we don't we don't if I stole from you and you never found out right did I still steal if I never miss it well I guess he didn't miss it I guess it's mine no you you know if you do wrong he said you know if you've done wrong and you know if you've done wrong you can't have confidence well aren't you glad that he gave us away confess your sins go to the Lord cry ABA father and he confess your sins and he'll be what faithful and just to forgive them right there's no need burying something when there's something to fix it I I I remember having a a problem I just I couldn't figure out what it was so I I went to the doctor and the doctor noticed something oh you've got this little thing here I said oh and they said here put this and it fixed it you know I just thought how long did I deal with that not understanding what an easy fix it was why bear the conviction why bear the shame why don't you just go to the altar because God has a chosen place of worship it's under the shed blood make it right healing is based on forgiveness if someone offends you if your spouse offend you if your husband offend you if you've done wrong in your life you've done wrong in your marriage get together repent forgive one another because healing is based on forgiveness faith is based on forgiveness you can't have faith until you're convinced that he's forgiven you and he died for you not that he died for sin I'm sorry Jesus died for me amen amen well I was yet a sinner wait a minute I wasn't even born yet but while I was yet a sinner why he knew what I was he knew where I had been he knew what I would do he knows my weakness he still knows my weaknesses but praise God he who is in me is greater I can't overcome I've been chosen to overcome I've been elected to overcome I am a what Overcomer who's it given in this age to the Overcomer I will grant to him to sit with me in my father's house to sit with me in my table and we'll Su together you've got an Avenue to make it right power first Corinthians 4:20 for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power the kingdom of God is the ability to affect the course of events and the lives of those around us that's what he raised the church up for go into all the world and get these Devils yes sir off of my children go into all the world and let them know that they that by my Stripes They're healed and those that believe shall be saved I don't ask God in the morning Lord give me a list of who I should witness to today because I don't want to have no failures H go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature and those that believe shall be saved I have the power to do that yes prophet of God said in that day at Calvary the church has the power to impart eternal Life religion and denominations has taught God's people throw it on him throw it on if he wants it done he'll do it no let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus that you thinking not of yourself but of the well-being of the person that's why the church is motivated by love and love and faith work together so in other words we say I want to have faith but what I want to have faith but Faith activates the power so do I have the power power once I come to the established fact that the word of God has given the believer the power they have the C capacity and the ability to make a difference in people's lives to change the atmosphere to change the attitude and to change the outcome prophet of God says these things in C I went into the house and the wife was all upset and I said honey sit down I'll do the dishes change the what whole atmosphere and thus change the course of events no need getting upset yeah I I'm Irish it's real easy for me to get upset and frustrated I find out though if I bite my tongue things turn out better now my tongue's been awful sore lately but you know wisdom is a better part of valor it's that and God hath both raised up the Lord and will also raise us by his own power finally my Maran be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore I would rather glory in my infirmities that the power power of Christ might rest upon me this power is yours Jesus identified himself where in the word is that right he read the scriptures and said that's me the little boy looked in the mirror and he said Mama that's me are you looking in the scriptures this morning and saying that's me or is there a question now the only question we heard the prophet raise up is that you're either doing something wrong you've done something wrong and it's become a block to you but he said if you'll confess your faults that's right he'll be just and faithful to forgive you don't want to go create a fake religion I know churches where the pastor's been divorced and remarried and his congregation is full of people who are divorced and remarried and if a person go in one church if they get divorced and remarried where do you think they go they move up right there you don't have to live like that right right you read marriage and divorce we made mistakes Lord I made a mistake it's all over I'm never going to do it again and go on live like a Christian live a Christian Life don't live in the past have faith in other words faith comes from one place and one place alone and that's the word of God that's the only place that faith comes from if there's no other place that faith comes from I just want to read it to you real quick just as just to lay it down is he says he says and it comes to you by hearing the word of God and that alone Faith cometh by hearing the word of God and that alone Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God that puts it back to where your faith then is not in some individual it's not in a man who is that individual you who is the man you it's not in an organization it's not in a group of people it's in God because God is the word and your faith is in God faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word the only place you're going to get Faith is by listening to what that word says that's it power Ephesians 3:20 now unto him that is able to do exceedingly and abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh where he's going to do all these things but he's got an accordance how is he going to do it we we've oh forgive me and then you can all go home and pray for me that I get my mind back all this time we've been well he'll do it he'll do it I'm going to wait here till he does it till he does it wait a minute that's not what we just heard we heard that now it was in them now the spirit was in them now the power was in them he's going to do all things is that right he's going to do all things according to the power that worketh in us the power is there it's been given to us right we got to settle that right this can be accomplished this can be done now I need something to rise up in me that is going to make the power that's in me go to work and change the circumstance faith has got to have a resting place and the only place they get that faith is from the word and once it's the word it you now have the power but now you have the word that gives you the authority to activate the power remember the policeman he stands up in front of the car he can't stop that car raising his hand but he stops the car by what the power and authority that's been given him why do you cast out the devil by the power and authority that was given to you by the word of God he can't sit out in front of that car and said does my uniform fit is my badge on right you don't have time you got to it's got to be instantaneously that's not right I can't have that in my life get out of here take your hand pray for somebody we've got the power we've got the power Colossians 1:11 strengthen with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience in land longsuffering and joyfulness Luke and behold I send the promise of the father upon you but tar in the city of drw until you are endued with power from on high he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength and what is exceedingly greatness of his power towards us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power he hath a mighty arm strong in hand and high is thy right hand find me Brethren farewell be perfect be of good Comfort be of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you that your faith should not stand in wisdom of man but in the power of God okay read it more and more and more we've got the power now we've got to start lining the things up we've got to line our life up we've got to build our faith to activate the power I love this statement and I better invite the musicians because if I don't I won't stop he says and when the word of God comes to you it makes manifest you are a Believer and a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you the believer is the faith in God that moves in you do you believe God can do all things amen do you believe there's anything too hard sir for God do you understand what he's trying to say when you believe and you know it's the word of God that word activates the power that's in you you don't sit there like a bump on the log saying I'm not going to do a thing no faith acts if not you just become a hearer of a word and not a doer of the word you see it in the word of God you know that that Authority's been given to you because you've identified your life as a Believer like Jesus did the deciples finally realized that they were called they went to the upper room they had that experience they knew that was the word of God and they stepped out and said Silver and Gold Have I None but that which I have the power that he gave me the authority that he gave me I am going to exercise that power and authority because I'm confident that I am a son and daughter of God and I've been given the commission from the father to exercise this power that I have and then the church every member in the church starts to rise up in the faith different burdens on different Hearts different motive different but everybody's got a sheet of music that God's playing in one beautiful sympy Symphony and what sa Faith do Faith creates an atmosphere Faith creates Unity and you say faith in the word of God the word of God is the thought of God sitting next to you you are the word you are the attributes of God power without character is for oneself power power with character is the mind of Christ it's about others recognizing your position to help others make a difference in other lives recognizing your position to help others and make a difference in other people's lives oh my God gave you that power he gave you the power to make the difference we'll go back and go back over more in the days to come that each one of us can finally sit down without a shadow of and doubt and say I am a Son of God I come from God I go to God remember the prophet of God said if he said you have you have faith you don't need to come in the prayer line let's stand [Music] together you say you have a need this morning we have a [Music] baptism I think brother yeah brother Thiago yeah your daughter Miriam you going if you guys will come around to get ready we're going to have a baptism if you need to go we certainly understand if you'd like to stay with us that's fine [Music] we we're happy to pray if you have a need and that's just to join our faith with your faith but if you believed that God was going to answer that prayer then you should be able to take it right where you're sitting do you understand the power that he's wanting the church to come [Music] into one by one Believers right where they're at they've touched the Hem of His Garment that's what he said and to prove that he touched the Hem of His Garment he turned around and said who touched me how many times in the prayer line in the discernment did you see brother Braham said who did he touch who did she touch they had already activated the faith that God could confirm they had already been touched they already touched the thing and God called them out and let them know you've your named such and such you touched the Hem of His garment this is what you're a we're asking for thus saith the Lord maybe they had a question Lord what's wrong with me I've been feeling so bad I I I I I've been to the doctors I don't know what it is Lord touch me help me and the prophet of God said oh the doctor said it was this but it's not this is what it is he's still here we don't need the discernment to be the Believers we've got the word of God that discernment has led the church astray into following after all kinds of gifts all kinds of foolishness all kinds of stuff when all the time the kingdom is within you and your faith comes from the word of God and if you know he's a Healer this morning you can take Hebrews 138 and you can say I believe that and that scripture is going to activate the power that's in me that I will be healed by by the power of His might that dwelleth in you that's the church that's the church that every member in particular stands up and supplies the need of the other you say I need a job quit whining Lord It's Your will that I work I want to support the church I want to give to the poor I I want to be productive I want to bear fruit create for me a job oh [Music] God I have a right for a job I could go through story and story about people that are in jobs that they're totally unqualified [Music] for but guess what they do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens them Lord I don't know how I'm going to do it but with your grace and your help I'll make it through I've never seen the righteous beg bread will you join with me could you put that song up whatever they're saying [Music] there's two roads this morning that you can take one's by sight and one's by the word of God faith is the evidence of things desired and hoped for but not yet seen faith is the faith is that part of you that sees that word and that word is so real to you it becomes an Absol substance it becomes your reality and you say this is what's going to come to pass because God Said [Music] So how he'll do it I don't know I'm not looking for the how I'm looking for the product and I believe we can have it this is all of us don't count yourself out don't sit in the back and don't be involved don't think about your paycheck don't think about your problems think about everybody else sitting in this building that's counting on your prayer that's counting on your life that's counting on your love and let's join together and one Accord in one mind and one spirit and
