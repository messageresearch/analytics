[1:09:10] phones and then it's in five different
[1:09:13] languages so I don't know yeah there it
[1:09:17] is right up there great so you got it
[1:09:20] all right let's stand this morning and
[1:09:23] um
[1:09:30] I'd like to read a couple scriptures
[1:09:32] this morning
[1:09:34] um and uh we'll we'll make references to
[1:09:38] other scriptures but um our first
[1:09:42] scripture is found in uh 2
[1:09:52] Corinthians and the fifth chapter
[1:09:59] and the 18th and 20th
[1:10:24] verse I like the 17th verse so we have
[1:10:27] to read that one too of course you know
[1:10:29] how I am I I just keep backing up and
[1:10:32] then we'll get to Genesis one and it
[1:10:35] says therefore If any man be in Christ
[1:10:40] he is a new creature old things are
[1:10:43] passed away behold all things are become
[1:10:48] new and all things are of God who hath
[1:10:52] reconciled us to himself
[1:10:55] by Jesus Christ and hath given to us the
[1:11:00] ministry of
[1:11:02] reconciliation to Wi that God was in
[1:11:05] Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:11:09] himself not imputing their trespasses
[1:11:13] unto them but hath committed unto us the
[1:11:18] word of
[1:11:21] reconciliation now then we are
[1:11:24] ambassadors for Christ as though God did
[1:11:28] beseech You by us we pray in you Christ
[1:11:34] dead be ye reconciled to God Amen and
[1:11:39] let's turn over to
[1:11:42] Colossians the first uh chapter of
[1:11:46] Colossians and
[1:11:49] uh and the 20th verse 1 and 20 in
[1:11:53] Colossians
[1:12:04] and it says and having made peace
[1:12:07] through the blood of his cross by him to
[1:12:11] reconcile all things unto himself by him
[1:12:16] I say whether they be things in Earth or
[1:12:20] things in heaven our heavenly father we
[1:12:23] ask you to bless your word in Jesus
[1:12:26] precious name we pray amen amen God
[1:12:29] bless you you may be seated this
[1:12:36] morning
[1:12:40] um I got up this morning and this
[1:12:43] thought just came to me this morning and
[1:12:46] I I really didn't have time to maybe sit
[1:12:50] down and put it into a uh a
[1:12:56] form of a sermon uh if I could say it
[1:13:00] that way uh I got up this morning I
[1:13:03] don't know probably somewhere around
[1:13:07] 5:00 and I just felt
[1:13:10] to take this uh message uh in his
[1:13:14] presence and I so I I went out and and
[1:13:18] sat on the couch and turn on the lamp
[1:13:21] and I started reading about his
[1:13:26] presence and uh you know it's a it's a
[1:13:29] it's a lovely book of course I I've
[1:13:32] never heard a sermon that wasn't lovely
[1:13:35] that didn't have something in it that uh
[1:13:39] dealt with my heart uh uh it just seems
[1:13:44] like God's word has a way of speaking to
[1:13:47] you no matter from what way that it
[1:13:50] comes from what direction it comes in it
[1:13:53] it just it is just something about it
[1:13:57] and so
[1:13:59] uh uh brother Bram was talking about the
[1:14:02] presence of God and and uh how powerful
[1:14:06] it is he he talked about men that were
[1:14:10] in uh under the anointing and and the
[1:14:14] effect of the presence of God and he
[1:14:18] talked about finny and how finny was a a
[1:14:22] an evangelist and and and uh finny went
[1:14:27] uh was uh preaching and he had a Revival
[1:14:32] that was do and so he'd been in great
[1:14:36] prayer uh for the Revival and he was
[1:14:40] speaking in an
[1:14:41] auditorium and it didn't even have uh
[1:14:45] microphones or uh Acoustics so he was
[1:14:48] there to uh test the Acoustics to uh
[1:14:51] maybe feel the rebound or how that the
[1:14:54] sound would go with and so he' been in
[1:14:57] much prayer so he just slipped up
[1:15:00] without anybody knowing to the
[1:15:03] microphone and he said uh repent or
[1:15:08] perish and the anointing was so strong
[1:15:11] on him that there was a worker that was
[1:15:14] up in the uh uh balcony that when he
[1:15:19] heard that the the presence of the Lord
[1:15:22] was so strong that he got down and he he
[1:15:25] got on his knees right there on the spot
[1:15:28] because of the presence of the Lord and
[1:15:32] he he he talked about even in his own
[1:15:34] meetings and and I I've talked with
[1:15:37] people that were in brother Ram's
[1:15:39] meetings
[1:15:41] and and of all the the things that they
[1:15:44] would tell me a lot of these men didn't
[1:15:48] receive his message the way that we've
[1:15:50] received it and understanding that it
[1:15:53] was a word that was delivered to a bride
[1:15:56] they just look at them as as maybe
[1:15:59] another Ministry or uh or as a a prophet
[1:16:04] but not in the sense that we would feel
[1:16:07] that he was a prophet to the age with a
[1:16:10] message to an elect people but they all
[1:16:13] spoke one thing in common and it was
[1:16:16] that that there was a uh when he when he
[1:16:21] was about uh uh his life and uh uh even
[1:16:26] when he was preaching that there was a
[1:16:29] strong presence of the Lord with him
[1:16:33] that that in his meetings the presence
[1:16:35] of the Lord would come down so strong
[1:16:38] that people would actually get out of
[1:16:41] the prayer line and go to the altar
[1:16:43] before that they would come into that
[1:16:45] presence and the present was so strong
[1:16:48] that there would be no uh no secret of
[1:16:52] any heart was withheld that all things
[1:16:55] were exposed in the presence of God and
[1:16:59] he was talking about the power of the
[1:17:02] presence of God and and and how that
[1:17:05] things change in the presence of God
[1:17:10] once that you come into His presence you
[1:17:12] never leave the same and we know that
[1:17:16] and we would always hope that when you
[1:17:19] come into the presence of God that you
[1:17:21] would leave better that it would draw
[1:17:25] you to be ever more closer to him that
[1:17:29] you would realize that there's another
[1:17:31] being there's another uh life there's
[1:17:34] something Beyond this present world that
[1:17:38] we live in and that there's a a power
[1:17:41] somewhere that's holding all this
[1:17:43] together you know the the very fact that
[1:17:46] people think some star bumped into
[1:17:50] another star and
[1:17:52] created creation is is is I uh I find it
[1:17:56] foolish you know there there had to be
[1:17:59] somebody that could orchestrate it in
[1:18:01] fact Paul says that this way he says the
[1:18:03] invisible things of God are clearly seen
[1:18:07] in the visible things around us for
[1:18:09] nature itself itself speaks of his glory
[1:18:13] the first Bible was written in the stars
[1:18:16] and the sky in all creation I I don't
[1:18:19] know how a person can wake up in the
[1:18:21] morning and have the breath of life and
[1:18:24] realize that this life is that we have
[1:18:28] is is not a a plant life or an animal
[1:18:32] life but it it's it's a life that that
[1:18:35] has to come from somewhere you know it
[1:18:39] it it couldn't come from a lower form
[1:18:42] you know what I mean it had to come from
[1:18:45] above this if it it had to be something
[1:18:49] above what we are even for us to be what
[1:18:53] we are and so the great uh presence of
[1:18:57] God is uh uh something that uh just he
[1:19:02] began to talk about and I I began to sit
[1:19:06] there and think and then he began to
[1:19:08] speak
[1:19:09] about about
[1:19:12] uh the Great Men of the Bible Moses and
[1:19:16] uh uh uh Abraham and John and and the
[1:19:22] effect uh when they came into the the
[1:19:24] presence of the Lord that John fell as
[1:19:28] he was dead and and mo Abraham bowed
[1:19:32] down before the Lord and and we know
[1:19:35] Moses he he trembled and feared and that
[1:19:39] he came into the presence of the burning
[1:19:42] bush and all down through ages people
[1:19:46] that come into the presence of God uh
[1:19:49] were uh if I could say this
[1:19:52] numbed uh
[1:19:55] I wouldn't even imagine I I I know that
[1:19:58] I felt the presence of the Lord the
[1:20:00] anointing of the
[1:20:02] Lord and by the goodness of God and
[1:20:06] that's sort of what I began to think
[1:20:08] about you know I maybe not in the way
[1:20:11] that John did or these men uh felt but I
[1:20:15] I was grateful that I know there's a
[1:20:17] Lord and I I I I I can feel his presence
[1:20:22] aren't you glad you can feel the
[1:20:23] presence of the Lord
[1:20:25] do don't you know that when he comes
[1:20:28] around and you can sense that presence
[1:20:31] that that's a time to become reverent
[1:20:35] it's a time to be respectful okay it
[1:20:38] doesn't matter who's there but when you
[1:20:41] know he's there he becomes the uh the
[1:20:44] guest of honor he becomes the focus of
[1:20:47] our attention he's the most important
[1:20:50] thing that there is when he's there he
[1:20:53] is it he's what he's what we live for if
[1:20:57] is that presence and and if if you've
[1:20:59] been through dry spells and you've been
[1:21:01] through times of trial and Times of
[1:21:04] struggle you know what a refreshing
[1:21:06] season it is when that wind of the Holy
[1:21:09] Spirit blows by you and you just feel
[1:21:11] that Grace and that peace come around
[1:21:15] you and and you're thankful and if
[1:21:17] you're outside of that presence and
[1:21:19] you're maybe not living right well you
[1:21:21] know when that presence comes many times
[1:21:24] it brings conviction or or or it makes
[1:21:28] you feel uh I don't know the vocabulary
[1:21:32] to express it but you just kind of feel
[1:21:35] a conviction you you you you sense
[1:21:38] something hey I'm not right I uh CU
[1:21:41] there's something here and I I I always
[1:21:44] say it like this sometimes it just feels
[1:21:46] like you're totally
[1:21:48] exposed you know I've sat in services
[1:21:50] and the word of God's went out and
[1:21:53] convicting my heart and correcting me
[1:21:56] and and I just would sit there and think
[1:21:58] that everybody in that building is
[1:22:00] looking right at me every eye on that
[1:22:03] building's on me everybody in there
[1:22:05] knows he's talking about me uh you know
[1:22:08] you just feel like you're just put right
[1:22:11] up on the screen and the they say say
[1:22:14] they're
[1:22:16] sinner you know and and uh uh and
[1:22:22] it's it shakes you down to the core but
[1:22:26] afterwards you're so thankful because
[1:22:29] there's a peace that comes when you're
[1:22:31] able to go make things right and and I
[1:22:34] think it's beautiful to know that if God
[1:22:37] before you who can be against
[1:22:41] you and as as we just was
[1:22:45] uh uh just listening to the prophet and
[1:22:48] reading and and thinking about this
[1:22:51] great presence I just begin to uh just
[1:22:55] think about the fact that that here it
[1:22:58] was these men of old they looked far off
[1:23:02] to God and and there was a a
[1:23:07] fear that they had of
[1:23:10] God I mean they they were they were if I
[1:23:14] could say this they they lived lives
[1:23:18] that they didn't want to offend God in
[1:23:21] any way and they they fear the wrath of
[1:23:25] God that God at any time would turn his
[1:23:29] wrath towards them they pleaded in their
[1:23:32] prayers Lord let not your wrath fall
[1:23:35] upon me Lord let me please you that that
[1:23:39] I find favor in your sight they it it
[1:23:42] meant something to them to uh uh have
[1:23:46] favor with God and be right in the sight
[1:23:51] of God because they felt there was
[1:23:53] consequence es if if they weren't you
[1:23:56] know it's hard to believe that we live
[1:23:58] in a society now of no
[1:24:01] consequence you can go into a store you
[1:24:03] can steal something no consequence uh
[1:24:06] you can uh you know people run red
[1:24:09] lights now because uh they feel if they
[1:24:12] don't get in the wreck there's no
[1:24:14] consequence there's there's no fear of
[1:24:16] punishment there's no there's no fear of
[1:24:20] of any
[1:24:22] retaliation or anything that
[1:24:24] would come it it just kind of things
[1:24:27] have just kind of got away but as I read
[1:24:30] and listened to him I thought he talking
[1:24:32] about that Old Testament those those
[1:24:34] people uh walked uh uh in timidness you
[1:24:40] know wanting to keep the law because the
[1:24:43] the by the law that they they knew that
[1:24:47] this law is what kept them from
[1:24:49] displeasing God and and they were under
[1:24:52] that burden
[1:24:54] you know what a what a relationship I
[1:24:57] just thought of of the relationship that
[1:25:00] they had with God how that that you
[1:25:03] walked you know and you made sure that
[1:25:05] you washed your pants just right and you
[1:25:07] dressed just right and you did this just
[1:25:10] right you just wanted to make sure that
[1:25:13] that you didn't offend him in any way
[1:25:16] and nowadays people just take his name
[1:25:19] in vain they just spew it out of their
[1:25:21] mouth with no regard at all okay they
[1:25:25] they speak the name of the Lord Jesus in
[1:25:28] every slate and every way they use it as
[1:25:31] exent Mas and and everything and you
[1:25:35] just see that there's such a distance uh
[1:25:38] from any realization that there even is
[1:25:41] a God and the scripture tells us and
[1:25:44] they wrote to us he says no longer
[1:25:46] wishing to retain God and their
[1:25:48] knowledge that God gave them over to a
[1:25:50] reprobate mind and we see the
[1:25:53] reprobation in our country today because
[1:25:56] our country turned away from keeping
[1:26:00] God we used to be one nation under God
[1:26:04] and now they want to take it off the
[1:26:05] money they took prayer out of the school
[1:26:07] they take Bible reading they don't let
[1:26:09] Bibles in their Library uh you know uh
[1:26:13] that they they they call they want
[1:26:17] diversity well there's no diversity with
[1:26:20] God there's no variance in God
[1:26:25] you know God's the
[1:26:27] same and he's still the creator of
[1:26:30] Heaven and Earth and the scripture even
[1:26:33] tells us that they begin to worship the
[1:26:35] creature more than the Creator so the
[1:26:39] consciousness of God has just uh slipped
[1:26:44] away from man they're not conscious of
[1:26:46] them they're not conscious that he's got
[1:26:49] requirements they're not conscious that
[1:26:51] he's in control there's not
[1:26:53] consciousness at all that he holds their
[1:26:57] Destiny in his hands man thinks he holds
[1:27:01] his own destiny but he doesn't hold his
[1:27:03] own destiny one day at a judgment he'll
[1:27:06] they'll find out whose hands they're
[1:27:08] really
[1:27:10] in amen I I don't know if it was moody
[1:27:14] or one of the great preachers or
[1:27:16] Spurgeon or one of the great preachers
[1:27:18] preached a message called sinners in the
[1:27:21] hands of an Angry God
[1:27:25] and and just think about that how how
[1:27:28] would you like to have God's Wrath
[1:27:31] turned unto
[1:27:33] you oh my I sat there and I I I just
[1:27:38] begin to look at this great attitude
[1:27:40] that that that these men had towards God
[1:27:44] and and the fear that they had towards
[1:27:47] God and and and then in my heart I begin
[1:27:50] to think well Lord I don't why don't I
[1:27:54] feel that
[1:27:56] way you know why aren't I
[1:28:01] afraid of
[1:28:05] God and I I said I said I'm not afraid
[1:28:08] of
[1:28:10] God and I know he's I know he's the
[1:28:14] creator of all
[1:28:15] things I know that he's that with just a
[1:28:21] a a thought
[1:28:24] he can do away with the
[1:28:27] world that that there's there's there
[1:28:31] there's nothing that he can't do the
[1:28:34] scripture only says there's one thing
[1:28:36] that God cannot do and that's
[1:28:38] lie because he's
[1:28:41] truth and and there's no variance
[1:28:43] there's no changing in them he's
[1:28:45] unchanging God and I I just thought
[1:28:48] there for a moment I was sitting there
[1:28:50] and and and it just struck my
[1:28:55] heart is that the
[1:28:59] reason
[1:29:01] that that's not
[1:29:03] my Approach To God is because of
[1:29:10] Calvary because there was a
[1:29:13] blood that
[1:29:16] reconciled me to the
[1:29:21] father that the fear that man had
[1:29:27] because the law let man know that he was
[1:29:30] a
[1:29:31] sinner now the great God that sat a way
[1:29:36] that wise men were afraid of because the
[1:29:41] the fear of God is the beginning of all
[1:29:45] wisdom but I realized that that
[1:29:48] something had taken
[1:29:50] place that man was that man was
[1:29:53] separated ated from God by sin because
[1:29:56] they had the sin mark on their lives
[1:29:59] they were born in sin they were shaped
[1:30:02] in iniquity they came into the world
[1:30:04] speaking lies their very nature and
[1:30:07] their very actions their very
[1:30:11] disposition their very personality was
[1:30:15] really contrary to everything that God
[1:30:19] was I mean man lusted they they they
[1:30:23] they C Ed they stole they killed they
[1:30:27] murdered they
[1:30:29] blasphemed uh they they were adulterers
[1:30:33] and and they were everything so God had
[1:30:35] every reason in fact one time God
[1:30:37] repented that he even made
[1:30:40] man and he took man and and and looked
[1:30:44] down upon him and and uh he said I'll do
[1:30:48] away with
[1:30:50] this and but yet he provided an ark
[1:30:54] he Pro provided US
[1:30:57] Safety as I I watched and I thought of
[1:31:00] that I thought how would my life changed
[1:31:04] if if that was the way
[1:31:08] that that I lived in a
[1:31:12] fear of the
[1:31:16] father and and
[1:31:19] that's a a thing that people have lost a
[1:31:23] lot of respect for
[1:31:26] fathers you know we you know I I always
[1:31:30] had a reverent fear I wasn't afraid of
[1:31:33] my father as we might count fear but I
[1:31:37] knew that he had the authority I knew he
[1:31:41] had the power to bless and to punish and
[1:31:44] I wanted to do right in his
[1:31:48] sight and I honored his office as my
[1:31:52] father and I was raised a Catholic and
[1:31:55] and uh so it it it didn't have anything
[1:31:58] to do with scripture uh I I my my dad
[1:32:02] certainly believed that uh uh you didn't
[1:32:06] believe in sparing the rod at all you
[1:32:08] know I don't know of if people spank
[1:32:13] their children anymore you should never
[1:32:14] spank your child when you're
[1:32:17] angry you know and you don't spank them
[1:32:20] to hurt them but it's a good way to send
[1:32:23] the
[1:32:24] message you know just say it that
[1:32:27] way so it brought me to this point and
[1:32:31] and won't be
[1:32:33] long this
[1:32:34] morning
[1:32:37] that Calvary
[1:32:40] changed the
[1:32:42] relationship between man and
[1:32:46] God it it to think that this this stain
[1:32:54] or this
[1:32:55] Scourge that was upon me as being a
[1:33:00] human that he became a kinsman redeemer
[1:33:05] he became
[1:33:06] man and and that God so loved us that he
[1:33:12] sent his only begotten
[1:33:15] son that through him we might become the
[1:33:20] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:33:25] you know from
[1:33:27] Creature to
[1:33:29] son to daughter uh that's what that that
[1:33:34] that's a great
[1:33:36] change that took
[1:33:39] place at
[1:33:41] Calvary and I thought leading up to
[1:33:44] Calvary I in my heart I thought you know
[1:33:47] Lord I I've got a different
[1:33:50] relationship with you because
[1:33:56] of the sacrifice that Jesus made on the
[1:34:00] cross that by his
[1:34:03] blood I was
[1:34:05] reconciled back to
[1:34:08] him I could I could resume resume my
[1:34:12] position again as son or daughter that I
[1:34:17] didn't have to remain away and far from
[1:34:21] him that I would just be
[1:34:24] uh a man that is filled with fear
[1:34:28] because of my weaknesses because of my
[1:34:31] uh inability to always be righteous that
[1:34:35] I have that I was governed by passions a
[1:34:38] and thoughts that drove me to do things
[1:34:41] that I never maybe even intended to do
[1:34:45] but but all of a sudden from that state
[1:34:49] that I'm in where I knew that at any
[1:34:53] time
[1:34:54] the wrath of God could come down and
[1:34:57] smoke
[1:34:58] me and that governed my life and then
[1:35:02] because of the sacrifice made at Calvary
[1:35:05] I was no longer in that state but now I
[1:35:08] was
[1:35:10] redeemed now I wasn't an
[1:35:13] outcast I wasn't an
[1:35:16] alien I I no longer was separated from
[1:35:21] him but I was renewed and reconciled
[1:35:24] with him again that I could cry ABA
[1:35:29] father that now I have a
[1:35:32] father and as the more I thought about
[1:35:34] that I thought Lord you know there's so
[1:35:36] many of us that really have not entered
[1:35:39] into that relationship with you as
[1:35:46] father a
[1:35:48] father and I began to just in my heart
[1:35:54] go through the
[1:35:55] scriptures and and scriptures started
[1:35:58] coming to me as soon as I sat there and
[1:36:01] I begin to realize wow that's what Jesus
[1:36:06] was
[1:36:08] teaching he was trying to change the
[1:36:11] relationship between man and
[1:36:15] God he was doing all that he could and
[1:36:18] he began to tell Parables and he began
[1:36:21] to tell uh uh preach sermons in
[1:36:25] everything and all all through these
[1:36:27] sermons what he was trying to do was
[1:36:29] he's trying to get the people to
[1:36:31] understand that that he he's your
[1:36:34] father not only is he your
[1:36:38] God that he should be feared but he's a
[1:36:43] a father that can that can be touched by
[1:36:46] your
[1:36:48] infirmities he's a father that hears
[1:36:51] your your prayers he's a father that's
[1:36:55] mindful of you he's a father that cares
[1:36:57] for
[1:36:59] you that it's not not the idea that he
[1:37:03] sits up there with his hands folded and
[1:37:05] he's got his eyes on you and boy you
[1:37:09] know he just waiting to send a strike of
[1:37:12] lightning now
[1:37:14] zap you
[1:37:16] know but he's
[1:37:20] actually looks at you as being
[1:37:24] begotten of
[1:37:28] him just think of
[1:37:32] that the
[1:37:33] gospel
[1:37:35] changed through the
[1:37:38] Lord he began to preach to us that God's
[1:37:42] your father God's your father and and
[1:37:45] and I I I thought as
[1:37:49] uh
[1:37:51] as what really he began to preach and
[1:37:54] the disciples begin to preach after him
[1:37:58] this this great theme begin to emerge
[1:38:01] out of all the scriptures and and and I
[1:38:05] again to see he says this thing is is
[1:38:07] not about something that's a far off but
[1:38:11] it's about something that's present a
[1:38:14] fatherson
[1:38:15] relationship and you know you go to a
[1:38:18] psychiatrist today and the first thing
[1:38:21] they want to do is lay you on the couch
[1:38:23] and say how did your daddy treat you you
[1:38:27] know every girl's got a daddy issue and
[1:38:30] and all that stuff and and and they just
[1:38:33] trying to figure it out you know what
[1:38:35] God settled all that at
[1:38:37] Calvary amen if you could ever come to
[1:38:40] that spot where you know the blood of
[1:38:42] Jesus Christ cleansed you from all
[1:38:44] unrighteousness and it restored you back
[1:38:47] to your relationship with your
[1:38:51] father that's what he came to
[1:38:54] do he came to take Sons and Daughters of
[1:38:58] God he that believeth on him he gave him
[1:39:00] power to become Sons and Daughters of
[1:39:04] God not
[1:39:06] Sinners not
[1:39:08] creatures not creation but they could
[1:39:11] actually have a
[1:39:13] relationship with a father you say well
[1:39:16] I'm an orphan you've still got a father
[1:39:19] Hallelujah I'm adopted you've got a
[1:39:22] father
[1:39:26] all kinds of situations children build B
[1:39:30] born out of
[1:39:32] wedlock single moms all kind we could
[1:39:35] that that's all those things thank God
[1:39:38] for
[1:39:42] Calvary because that price was paid to
[1:39:46] reconcile us it didn't keep one things
[1:39:49] out that weren't reconciled it didn't
[1:39:51] say this wasn't reconciled he he
[1:39:54] reconciled us with the father and
[1:39:57] reconciled all things unto himself and
[1:40:01] there he took it all on
[1:40:04] him so that he
[1:40:08] could bring to
[1:40:11] us the understanding and the
[1:40:15] Revelation that you are the children of
[1:40:21] God but we still live in so this such an
[1:40:26] idea that he's a far
[1:40:31] off that he's really not
[1:40:33] mindful that there's a Day of Reckoning
[1:40:38] coming and one day we'll have to
[1:40:43] answer and I thought
[1:40:49] Lord if I live like
[1:40:51] that I'm living below every
[1:40:55] privilege that you purchased for me at
[1:41:01] Calvary I thought of the the man that
[1:41:04] took the
[1:41:06] cruise he always wanted to go on a
[1:41:10] cruise and so he he saved up and he
[1:41:16] bought a
[1:41:17] ticket and he was on the
[1:41:19] cruise 10 day 14 day cruise don't
[1:41:23] remember how long it might be and he
[1:41:27] came uh finally to port and the captain
[1:41:32] would notice him standing at the front
[1:41:35] of the ship and looking out and maybe
[1:41:38] one day standing at the back of the ship
[1:41:41] and he would see him looking out and and
[1:41:44] but he never uh he noticed he never saw
[1:41:48] him at any
[1:41:50] activities and he never saw him go on
[1:41:54] Shore and he never saw him sitting at
[1:41:58] the dinner table and everything and so
[1:42:02] finally the captain being concerned made
[1:42:06] an effort to meet the
[1:42:07] man on
[1:42:11] the at Port of Call and as the man
[1:42:16] stepped off the plane he said sir could
[1:42:17] I speak to you and the man stepped over
[1:42:19] he said you know he said we pride
[1:42:24] ourselves in being the best cruise line
[1:42:28] there
[1:42:29] is and we have the greatest facilities
[1:42:33] and we try to provide the best
[1:42:35] entertainment and the best sightseeing
[1:42:38] and and everything and and I just want
[1:42:41] to know were you
[1:42:42] displeased with what we had to
[1:42:45] offer is is our reason did we not make
[1:42:49] food that you felt that you could eat
[1:42:52] and he looked at him he said sir he says
[1:42:55] I only had enough money to buy my
[1:43:00] ticket and the captain looked at me he
[1:43:02] said sir everything was
[1:43:05] included in your ticket it was all
[1:43:10] included but he failed to
[1:43:14] take
[1:43:16] advantage of what was
[1:43:20] purchased and I thought of Calvary I
[1:43:22] thought here here he purchased here he
[1:43:25] took me from the
[1:43:26] relationship that I had as sinner a God
[1:43:30] that I had to be afraid of and
[1:43:33] reconciled me back to the father made me
[1:43:37] a son
[1:43:39] again that I could cry ABA
[1:43:43] father that I didn't have to be
[1:43:46] distant but I could feel
[1:43:49] close and as we heard our messenger and
[1:43:52] even and them spoke he says it's our God
[1:43:55] that we could touch that we handled the
[1:43:58] Lord Of Glory God wanted to be
[1:44:00] tangible and when we don't enter into
[1:44:03] that relationship with him as him being
[1:44:06] a father then then he's he's a far off
[1:44:10] we hold him a far
[1:44:12] off instead of letting them come close
[1:44:16] and take our lives and correct us and
[1:44:18] guide us and and counsel us and and and
[1:44:22] bless BL us and protect
[1:44:25] us he's no longer
[1:44:29] father and I thought Lord I don't want
[1:44:31] to be have a God I want a
[1:44:36] father I need a spiritual
[1:44:39] father my natural father did all that he
[1:44:42] could for the years that God gave him
[1:44:44] but this journey takes a supernatural
[1:44:49] father I need I need that I need a close
[1:44:55] I need a guiding
[1:44:58] hand I can't be a
[1:45:02] loner I can't keep my
[1:45:05] feelings bottled
[1:45:09] up I can't just sit back and and
[1:45:14] wonder what's going to
[1:45:17] happen when he wants me to know that he
[1:45:21] holds my tomorrow
[1:45:25] that God if God be for
[1:45:28] you who can be against you and all
[1:45:32] through the scriptures I began to see
[1:45:34] that Jesus was preaching and trying to
[1:45:39] get the people to understand God's your
[1:45:43] father he's your maker even our message
[1:45:47] of this hour was the continual
[1:45:51] realization to try to get us to come
[1:45:54] back to an understanding that we are not
[1:45:58] alienated from
[1:46:01] God your name was you were in his
[1:46:05] thinking you were a part of him he gave
[1:46:08] you eternal life he put your name on the
[1:46:11] Lamb's Book of Life what basically he's
[1:46:13] trying to say he's your father he's his
[1:46:15] father crawl up in his lap put your arms
[1:46:19] around him say Happy Father's Day
[1:46:25] you don't have to walk far away from
[1:46:28] them you saywell I'm not doing too good
[1:46:31] yeah when I wasn't doing good I didn't
[1:46:33] like going to see my dad
[1:46:37] either but I was sure glad when they all
[1:46:39] got over
[1:46:44] with and
[1:46:45] just could you imagine
[1:46:51] living like
[1:46:56] a
[1:46:59] uh a bonds woman's
[1:47:04] child when you're
[1:47:07] heir to all
[1:47:11] things you're not
[1:47:14] Shu you're
[1:47:17] seed you're bone of his
[1:47:20] bone you're part of him
[1:47:23] how many times did you hear our
[1:47:25] messenger say you're a part of him
[1:47:27] you're a part of him in the beginning
[1:47:29] you're his word you're his you're his
[1:47:32] thoughts expressed you're the word
[1:47:35] you're Sons and Daughters of God and I
[1:47:38] just read a few scriptures
[1:47:41] and and I I like in the in first John uh
[1:47:47] just an example of some of the great
[1:47:50] things that were were spoken
[1:47:53] in the scriptures and I I believe it's 1
[1:47:55] John 1
[1:47:59] and3 he
[1:48:00] said that which we have seen and heard
[1:48:05] declared we unto you that ye Also may
[1:48:11] have fellowship with us and our True
[1:48:14] Fellowship is with the
[1:48:19] father so see so even John saying we
[1:48:22] declared the gospel unto you that you
[1:48:24] could have fellowship with us and our
[1:48:26] True Fellowship is with our
[1:48:29] father this this is what this is what
[1:48:31] he's saying this is a people that have
[1:48:35] come to be uh to the
[1:48:38] realization that that they have a
[1:48:42] father I'm not orphaned I'm not
[1:48:45] separated I'm not distant I'm not a
[1:48:49] part I am his offspring
[1:48:55] he's obligated to
[1:49:00] me he I like what David said Thou Art my
[1:49:04] God I was cast upon thee from my
[1:49:07] mother's womb I didn't have a choice
[1:49:09] you're my God and we can sit back not in
[1:49:12] fear anymore but with
[1:49:15] peace reconcile I give you peace that's
[1:49:18] her pathless understanding joy
[1:49:20] unspeakable and full of Glory Glory
[1:49:28] Hallelujah even if by
[1:49:31] shortcomings can anything separate us
[1:49:35] from the love of God Powers
[1:49:37] principalities swords Peril can anything
[1:49:40] separate us from the love of God through
[1:49:43] Christ Jesus our lord nothing amen
[1:49:48] nothing think of it this morning ask
[1:49:50] yourself
[1:49:54] and here's my father sitting there you
[1:49:58] know there's people that they haven't
[1:50:01] called their fathers in
[1:50:05] years they got they got
[1:50:08] some
[1:50:10] uh you know kick in their craw I think
[1:50:14] we say you know some little thing that
[1:50:20] that that
[1:50:21] separates them or or something and but
[1:50:24] just think of
[1:50:25] it he he took care of
[1:50:29] everything he said the path is clear the
[1:50:32] door is
[1:50:34] open I i' i' I've removed every obstacle
[1:50:39] you can walk right up into the face of
[1:50:41] the throne you can lift your hands and
[1:50:43] say Our Father which are in
[1:50:46] heaven that's what Jesus is teach how do
[1:50:49] we pray he his prayer like this our
[1:50:54] father I believe that's Matthew 6
[1:50:58] 9 and 13 somewhere in there he says the
[1:51:02] first thing I want you want to pray Our
[1:51:05] Father all of you everybody here us me
[1:51:08] you all together our father he's our
[1:51:11] father he's our
[1:51:14] father he you know I want to get this to
[1:51:17] you you know you're not a a people under
[1:51:20] the law you're not a people that's
[1:51:22] living in the fear of God you're not a
[1:51:24] people that's separated from God he
[1:51:26] begin to teach you and what was the Holy
[1:51:28] Spirit to do the Holy Spirit was to come
[1:51:30] and bring you into remembrance of all
[1:51:32] things that he
[1:51:34] taught and you go back and read the
[1:51:36] scriptures you will find that Jesus
[1:51:38] continually was trying to get the people
[1:51:41] to see that God is our father
[1:51:47] hallelujah our fellowship is with the
[1:51:50] father I believe in James
[1:51:53] uh James uh 1 and7 for example he says
[1:51:56] every perfect and GI gift comes from the
[1:52:02] father where does it come from where's
[1:52:05] all your blessings come from where's all
[1:52:07] the goodness come from we say
[1:52:13] God you know and I thought oh
[1:52:17] God you know God did this and God did
[1:52:21] that and and God everybody's got
[1:52:25] Gods but he wanted to take it above that
[1:52:29] thought
[1:52:30] process above that
[1:52:33] attitude above that distance and he
[1:52:36] wanted to make it more personal more
[1:52:39] full of love more full of blessing more
[1:52:43] full of Peace more full full of joy and
[1:52:47] he didn't want you to say oh oh oh God
[1:52:50] he said every good
[1:52:53] and perfect gift comes from
[1:52:55] God he wanted to be
[1:52:58] warmer than that more personal than that
[1:53:03] he said every good thing and perfect
[1:53:06] gift that's come into your life has come
[1:53:08] from your
[1:53:12] father it's come from your
[1:53:16] father not some from somebody off but
[1:53:19] somebody who's involved in your life
[1:53:22] every day who's there looking after you
[1:53:26] every day somebody who's present with
[1:53:30] you every day whether you recognize him
[1:53:33] or
[1:53:34] not in fact he tried to say it this way
[1:53:37] to us nothing can pluck us out of the
[1:53:39] palm of his hand if the father started a
[1:53:42] good work in you he'll finish it to the
[1:53:44] end the if the father okay the father
[1:53:48] does this the father does that the
[1:53:50] father's mindful the father cares for
[1:53:53] you the father looks after you Jesus is
[1:53:56] trying to get to the people you're his
[1:54:02] children and we still live if I could
[1:54:05] say this is all I'm just a nasty person
[1:54:08] who came to
[1:54:11] God and now I'm following
[1:54:14] God and that's
[1:54:17] true that would be the only relationship
[1:54:20] that we could establish from our side
[1:54:24] I'm just a sinner I'm no good I'm
[1:54:28] undeserving I I can do that I I I I all
[1:54:32] I could should be is a
[1:54:35] maid or a butler or a servant and then
[1:54:39] Jesus told the whole story and the
[1:54:42] parable about the prodal
[1:54:45] son and how that he squandered
[1:54:47] everything he was no good but what did
[1:54:49] he do he came to his father's house and
[1:54:52] his father sat there looking a far
[1:54:59] off because it was his
[1:55:03] son and he wouldn't
[1:55:06] allow a servant
[1:55:10] relationship or if I could say
[1:55:13] this a
[1:55:16] lore
[1:55:18] Fellowship than the fellowship of a son
[1:55:26] he proved
[1:55:27] it beyond measure he wanted to wipe away
[1:55:31] any
[1:55:33] doubt he killed the fatted
[1:55:36] calf oh what a type of
[1:55:40] Calvary he put the wedding garment on
[1:55:43] him he got the robe and put it on him
[1:55:46] and they called The Feast but you're he
[1:55:49] said my son which which was lost
[1:55:53] has returned he called him son even when
[1:55:55] his brother come he said wait a minute
[1:55:57] he said you all the things that you have
[1:55:59] are mind you've always been a blessing
[1:56:02] you do but look at
[1:56:05] it he was almost telling him he said
[1:56:09] son this is this your brother's my
[1:56:13] son and I love him the way that I love
[1:56:17] you and he'll always be my son and I'm
[1:56:21] not going to let them have a
[1:56:23] relationship with me less than that of a
[1:56:28] son or a
[1:56:30] daughter and I I hate the
[1:56:33] devil for depriving
[1:56:36] us because of our
[1:56:39] weaknesses from our fellowship with our
[1:56:43] Lord as
[1:56:47] children he put my name on the Lamb's
[1:56:50] Book of Life because I was the son of
[1:56:52] his
[1:56:54] thoughts I was the son that he knew
[1:56:57] would be here he knew the color of my
[1:56:59] eyes the shape of my form everything
[1:57:03] that I would be and before I even got
[1:57:05] here he put the wedding band of
[1:57:07] predestination on me and called me his
[1:57:11] own
[1:57:12] [Music]
[1:57:14] Hallelujah he's trying to move us in
[1:57:17] this
[1:57:18] hour he's been trying to move us from
[1:57:21] Rel religion he's been trying to move us
[1:57:23] from organization he's been trying to
[1:57:26] move us from Works he's been trying to
[1:57:28] move us into the Capstone where we know
[1:57:31] we have a relationship with him father
[1:57:33] and
[1:57:35] son that's what Jesus
[1:57:38] restored that as he
[1:57:41] is so are we in this
[1:57:45] world as he's a son I thought of this
[1:57:49] scripture he said here in Luke 12
[1:57:53] 32 he said fear not little
[1:57:58] flock first thing he said is fear not
[1:58:02] Don't Be
[1:58:04] Afraid Don't Be
[1:58:06] Afraid fear
[1:58:09] not perfect love cast out
[1:58:12] fear let me tell you his love for you is
[1:58:18] perfect it's undying and
[1:58:21] unseparable fear not little
[1:58:23] flock for which your
[1:58:27] father's your
[1:58:29] father's good pleasure to give you the
[1:58:33] kingdom he didn't say it it's God's good
[1:58:36] pleasure and I'm not trying to say that
[1:58:39] great name of God and but I wanted to to
[1:58:44] to say that's our
[1:58:48] approach
[1:58:50] distant far away
[1:58:52] not
[1:58:54] close not
[1:58:57] rejoicing not with joy and
[1:59:01] Thanksgiving I remember that my children
[1:59:04] sometimes if they got mad at me they
[1:59:06] would say oh I'm
[1:59:11] adopted yeah I said it's amazing that
[1:59:14] that we got you from a place that had
[1:59:17] big old noses
[1:59:23] you know and that
[1:59:25] that's
[1:59:27] no you can't get separated from God you
[1:59:31] can't get separated from God you're a
[1:59:33] part of them so why not enter into the
[1:59:37] relationship with
[1:59:39] him by natural there's many mothers that
[1:59:43] aren't
[1:59:45] mothers they're birthgiver
[1:59:48] there's many men that are are are are
[1:59:52] not fathers they're
[1:59:55] procreators but the father that we have
[1:59:58] is the father of
[2:00:01] light he's the father of every good imp
[2:00:04] perfect thing he's the Fountain of Life
[2:00:07] and the Fountain of
[2:00:10] Love he's all powerful
[2:00:14] Almighty he can do anything that he
[2:00:16] wants to do come I'll say this this
[2:00:19] morning my daddy can beat up anybody
[2:00:26] my daddy's the smartest my daddy's the
[2:00:29] best my daddy's the most intelligent my
[2:00:33] daddy's the most powerful fact my daddy
[2:00:36] created heaven and earth Hallelujah
[2:00:39] that's my
[2:00:41] [Applause]
[2:00:43] dad enter into that
[2:00:46] relationship that's what Calvary was for
[2:00:49] that's why he died that's why he nailed
[2:00:52] there on the cross and
[2:00:55] suffered that he can reconcile you
[2:00:59] back as
[2:01:02] children oh there's so many scriptures I
[2:01:04] could just go for
[2:01:08] hours showing you that Jesus kept
[2:01:11] teaching go read your scriptures read
[2:01:14] The Parables over and over again it's
[2:01:17] always this the
[2:01:19] father you were this way but the
[2:01:23] father you know the father will not
[2:01:26] leave you the father will finish the
[2:01:28] work the father will do this the father
[2:01:30] will do that the father you have a
[2:01:33] father and I sat there and I thought
[2:01:36] Lord
[2:01:37] God I would have never known
[2:01:40] that if
[2:01:43] Jesus didn't come and give
[2:01:46] isav that I could
[2:01:49] see a religious world
[2:01:52] building
[2:01:54] temples and buildings and Ministries to
[2:01:58] a
[2:02:00] God and where all God wants is his
[2:02:03] children
[2:02:06] back it's all he
[2:02:08] wants he wants you to come to his
[2:02:13] table you to come to his feet you to
[2:02:17] crawl up on his
[2:02:19] lap and say father
[2:02:28] I
[2:02:29] [Music]
[2:02:30] remember I think it
[2:02:32] was I don't remember it was David or
[2:02:35] Matthew you know I did one of those
[2:02:38] father things that's always not so smart
[2:02:41] I bought my kid
[2:02:43] slingshots well it didn't take long to
[2:02:45] take the neighbors window
[2:02:49] out so two of the boys got in a
[2:02:53] fight and so one of them took the
[2:02:56] slingshot and swung it of course the the
[2:03:00] handle stretched out and hit the other
[2:03:02] one in the head
[2:03:03] and you know hit him and so my
[2:03:08] dad yelled at him
[2:03:11] and I maybe spanked him I don't remember
[2:03:14] some sent him out of the
[2:03:17] room and

[2:03:27] anyway they shot one another they did
[2:03:30] all kinds of things you know but all of
[2:03:33] a sudden he comes back into the
[2:03:35] room comes down to the room you you know
[2:03:38] how you

[2:04:05] me and this morning I believe with all
[2:04:08] my heart I could go through messages I
[2:04:11] could go through quotes I could go
[2:04:14] through
[2:04:15] hours that
[2:04:18] all the gospel has been trying to do for
[2:04:21] for ages is get men
[2:04:25] back to their
[2:04:27] father to the
[2:04:29] relationship of
[2:04:31] father and you can't compare our Earthly
[2:04:35] Fathers as good as mine
[2:04:38] was he can never have done for me what
[2:04:41] my heavenly
[2:04:42] father has done for
[2:04:45] me my father is not here to
[2:04:48] honor today
[2:04:51] I believe God gave them to me he put a
[2:04:54] lot of Virtues I I could almost say it
[2:04:57] in this sense through the hand of my
[2:05:00] heavenly
[2:05:01] father my Earthly father passed on to me
[2:05:05] the ability to have built this
[2:05:08] building so my natural father is in all
[2:05:12] of
[2:05:13] this but all things were made
[2:05:17] possible by my heavenly father and today
[2:05:22] no matter what your life situation is no
[2:05:26] matter what your family situation is no
[2:05:30] matter how wronged you've
[2:05:33] been and whatever Misfortune has come to
[2:05:38] you by the sinful nature of
[2:05:42] man this morning you have a
[2:05:46] father a father that loves you
[2:05:51] a father that's never forsaken you and
[2:05:55] even this morning is still looking after
[2:05:59] you he's preparing a place for
[2:06:03] you that where he is you will be
[2:06:08] also and he's got all these great
[2:06:11] benefits and they come with the fair
[2:06:14] they come with Calvary so I just pray
[2:06:17] this morning that you would establish
[2:06:20] within your heart your
[2:06:24] relationship with God as your
[2:06:30] father he was willing to condens send
[2:06:34] and come down and become
[2:06:38] sin that he could redeem us
[2:06:43] back so we could stand and say
[2:06:47] father our
[2:06:49] father he says the f
[2:06:52] father knows what you have need of
[2:06:55] before you
[2:06:56] ask I want you if you just could see
[2:06:59] that theme in Jesus he never referred to
[2:07:03] him as far away he said your father
[2:07:07] knows what you have need
[2:07:08] of then he looked over him and he told a
[2:07:11] great story he said which one of you
[2:07:14] having a
[2:07:17] son and would
[2:07:19] ask for bread
[2:07:22] you would give him a
[2:07:25] rock and which one of you having a son
[2:07:28] if he asked for a fish you would give
[2:07:31] him a
[2:07:33] serpent he said if if your Earthly
[2:07:38] fathers will do good things for you how
[2:07:42] much
[2:07:45] more your heavenly father
[2:07:52] oh brothers and
[2:07:54] sisters and I can say this morning
[2:07:58] brothers and
[2:07:59] sisters because we have the same
[2:08:04] father no big eyes no little
[2:08:08] you we are not a
[2:08:10] religion we are a
[2:08:14] family and I looked at those people in
[2:08:17] the Old Testament and I thought oh they
[2:08:19] always had a god a far off
[2:08:22] but then Calvary came the price was paid
[2:08:27] and then he could say these
[2:08:29] words I'll be with
[2:08:32] you even in
[2:08:36] you and I thought
[2:08:39] hallelujah what a restored
[2:08:42] Fellowship the
[2:08:45] father in
[2:08:47] me and I in
[2:08:50] him father I pray that they may be one
[2:08:55] as we are
[2:08:56] one oh the
[2:08:59] joy of having a
[2:09:03] father and I'm glad that I got to meet
[2:09:07] my heavenly
[2:09:08] father and one day I'll see him in the
[2:09:12] flesh that which I know by Spirit one
[2:09:15] day I'll know face to
[2:09:17] face and what a glorious day that will
[2:09:21] be so I say to you

[2:10:27] said to the other you may have got hold
[2:10:29] of daddy but Daddy's got hold of me and
