prepared ourselves this morning Lord to be in a place that you can meet every need Lord God fill us through and through Lord hears our Cup today Lord God we lift it up before you that you may feel it Lord God and let us not only fear Lord God for us to have into our own bosom but Lord God that it may spill over lord God and reach throughout the world throughout the landlord God that some man woman boy girl may see that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forevermore Lord God Lord we dedicate every every part of this service to you Lord Jesus Lord and that you and your name that be lifted up Above All Things Lord bless the ministry Lord here and Lord all the laity as well Lord God Lord the children Lord the young man Lord God Lord let us all be examples Lord God of you today Lord and Lord and how you are you just bless us Lord God to be able to travel and make it here this morning Lord and Lord how you just orchestrated things in our lives Lord to put us in a place Lord God that you can give us the thing that you've promised us Lord we receive it all with joy today Lord God in your name we pray [Music] you may be seated as we invipara team sailor to read up songs and welcome to the house of the Lord he could have remained standing I pray it won't be long here but collect our thoughts and be concise uh what a beautiful day the Lord has made amen amen we need to be determined to rejoice and be glad in it you know this is a house of correction This House of Prayer house of worship but it's also a house that's been set aside and Sanctified where we've come before and receive what we have need of and brother Brown said more than one place that we get what we expect and you don't come expecting to get something from the Lord you're not going to get it if you come expecting to find something to criticize there will be plenty for you to criticize man we're going to read from Psalm 62 this morning and uh sort of the theme of what I have in my heart is expectation um an expectation is similar to Hope and proverbs 10 28 says the hope of the righteous shall be gladness but the expectation of the wicked Shall Perish so um We Believe very strongly in faith and even you know Paul said the just shall live by faith he was quoting the Old Testament when he said that you can find that in habeka the just live by faith and we do live by faith but the Bible also says we're saved by hope you read Romans 8 24 25 for we are saved by hope but hope that a scene is not hope for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for amen so I think to a certain degree that um even in the natural you expect something it's going to come to pass but spiritually we we find ourselves anchoring Our Hope and our faith in the word of God and that's a righteous hope and God will fulfill that hope amen so let's uh let's go ahead and stand and we'll read the the psalm together this morning you know when you get on a subject and you uh you start going through the scriptures and you realize that how much the the scripture dovetails one thought leads to another to another and they just lay exactly in line so whatever you have Nita if you just search the scriptures for in them we think we have eternal life and they are they that testify me the Bible says but they're going to give you something that you have need of and they're going to fulfill your heart's desire for your letter of the Lord so let's read Psalm 62 together and we'll focus there on the fifth verse says my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him amen blessed be the name of the Lord truly my soul wadeth upon God from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be greatly moved how long will you imagine Mischief against the man ye shall be slain all of you as a Boeing wall shall ye be and as a tottering fence they only consult to cast him down from his Excellency they Delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly see lie my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be moved in God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God trust in him at all times you people pour out your heart before him God is a refuge for us Selah sincerely men of low degree are vanity and and Men of high degree are a lie to be laid in the balance they are all together lighter than vanity trust not in oppression and become not Vain and robbery if riches increase set not your heart upon them God has spoken once twice have I heard this that power belongeth unto God also unto thee O Lord belongeth Mercy for thou renderest to every man according to his word blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] seated foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] cry [Applause] Friday I'm singing Glory Glory [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music]

God we didn't deserve this there's nothing that we can do to Merit this it's all Amazing Grace it's all his favor to us it's him coming and calling a people undeserving people the scripture says there's a man who organized a feast and they invited his friends and he called them and those and he said come to my feast and and each one send an excuse of why they couldn't be there oh I gotta I got married I need to do this so I got to attend to my sheep and I had a field that I need to work on and the Master of the House it says now all of those that were invited none of them will come to my Feast you go up in a byway and the highways and the lower part you find all that you can and bring them to my feast and that's the Gathering that we have this morning of the undeserving people he said my house will be full if that's why the scripture tells us that God will raise up the stones to be the sons of Abraham let's just buy our heads this morning our gracious father Lord It's Amazing Grace we come before you Lord this morning so thankful to be gathered in your house Lord father we is such an undeserving people every time we look and we try to understand the question why father we come shortened but one thing we know that if you give your word and you invited us Lord you provided a way that we could be the Lord and we pray this morning Father that you just come by our way and speak to us the words of Life Lord father the words that comes out of your mouth is with the very life that we need this morning Lord we don't need the thinking of man but we need your life to be extended to us be with us this morning Lord and father we remember our pastor this morning we pray for him our sister Leslie Lord and sister Leslie's sister father those that are afflicted out Alberto John and the passing of sister Gladys Lord we committed all into your hands and father we know that you have everything under your control father we commit all we are into your hands and invite you that you may come and take control that I got may not be the Gathering of men's but they will be the Gathering of the Living God with his people bless your people this morning we're so thankful to be here and we ask this things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen before we be seated to just bring you greetings for my pastor Brother David and I spoke with him this morning and he's doing well and the sister Gladys funeral will be here I'm sure many of you saw the emails the email that was sent certainly a difficult time I want to remember the family who want to pray for them and you know when things like this happen it just you know bring us into examination to really wonder what is it that we live for you realize as the scripture says here there's no continuing City we know that this life this Mortal life that we have one day will laid down whether it be by way of the translation of a body or by death either way this life will be laid down you know so if all this is all that we have then Paul said we are the most miserable of all but we know that that's not it we know that we have a body waiting for us that's the hope of a Christian to know that there's a body as the scripture says that Abraham was looking for a city whose building America was God so if you can reach out to the brothers when you can and just Comfort the family and we'll pray that God will just be with all of the situation and everything let's open our Bibles this morning let's open in uh failure for being a scripture this morning I trust you're happy to be gathered in the house of God Amen let's open uh first in Philippians chapter 2 verse 5 to 11. scripture says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus whom being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but he but he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross it says wherefore God also had highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven of things in Earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the father let us open our Bibles in First Corinthians chapter 2 we'll start from verse let's just start from verse 1 it says and I brought around when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you save Christ Jesus and save Jesus Christ in him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling he said in my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and power it says for your faith for that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God I'll be with we speak wisdom among them that are perfect it says yet the yet not the wisdom of this world no of the princes of the world that cometh to not but we speak the wisdom of God in mystery it says every even the thing the hidden things which God ordained before the foundation the the before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of the world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory but as it is written eyes and eyes have not seen no ear heard neither have they entered into the heart of man the things which God had prepared for them which love him now I want you now to focus on the verses that are following it says but God had revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the Deep things of God he says for what a man knoweth the things of of men save the spirit of men which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God it says now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might well we might know the things which are freely given to us of God which things are also we also we speak not in The Words which men's wisdom teach but which the Holy Ghost teachers comparing spiritual things with spiritual it says but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolished unto them neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned he says but he that is spiritual judges all things yet he himself himself is judged of no man for who have for who has the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him listen to this but we have the mind of Christ our gracious father we ask once again that you bless your word to us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have your seats this morning this morning for a few moments I would like to speak on our our identification at the end time and to kind of add a little more specific to it as we move along is I want to say that our identification needs to be a word based identification a word based identification but Barnum speaks about the time that we live in he makes a comment and he says that the evening time is the time of identification that he the scripture speaks in Matthew Chapter 13 you don't have to turn there or just summarize it it speaks about the parable of the sower how that master came and he sow seed and he sowed the seed on the field and they said that and then afterward afterwards the enemy came and he also saw seed in the same field and so the servants came into the master and they said it says Master you sow The Good Seed and yet behold while we were asleep he said the enemy came in he saw the tears on the field and then he asked that he asked them and they said should we go in and and start plugging out all their tears and everything the master looked at him he says no let it grow together let it to stay together let it be that way and he said but in the evening time it will come the time of identification when the seed will grow and it will produce the fruit will have the ability to come and look and know which one is the seed and which one is it there and the tail will be binded together to be burned and the seed will be put in the Garner so he speaks here to show us that the time for identification is not the morning time it's not the first age it's not the second age the time of identification the identification comes into plain view in the evening time at the time where what was sown in the beginning will have to manifest at the end time the time where the seed that was planted into the ground will come into manifestation with his works the time where the fruits will come forth and it will be seen and examined for what they are what random says again that it's important we realize that in it he says that the time that we are living in he says he says it's important that that we realize that we cannot do anything without identification especially with uh heightened security and the world that we live in today you know I remember back in the days you know when you had a computer or whatever anytime you put a a a password it was perhaps just the two or four letters and that was it you know you were put and then that was it you get access to whatever you need but because of the season and the time that we live in now your password is gonna be so long it can't be 40 anymore it has to be 16 or 24. now in fact people have moved away from password is what they call the passphrase a passphrase it means you put something that can remind you of something or you you change letters and all the and even after you have that you have to put what they call a second level Authentication like I thought I just put the password well you know they want to know who you are they want to know this they want to know and all of that is to make sure that you have been properly identified before you can gain access to what you need to be accessed to all of that is to preserve uh the things that have uh the the the information that is being put they want to make sure that if they let you through it's truly you it really belongs to you it's yours and I want to say this spiritually speaking is the same thing we live in the time where there is a group and the qualification of a bride and you cannot just gain access to it anytime you want it's just not given to anybody it's a group of people that have to pass the perfect identification in order for them to know who they really are in order for them to get access to the benefits that are behind that it's not just something the whole world can claim but when I'm says Jesus came and he gave his life for the world and and he came and he says he died for the sin of the whole world but they rejected him in fact it says when he comes back to the Church of the end time Jesus finds himself outside of the church and he says now he's no longer dealing with you as a church is no longer dealing with people as a church he's now going to the individuals why because the church had rejected him the church had built his own Dogma in understanding a denomination and they rejected the word of God and for that God is now dealing with you with as an individual what about him speaks and and I was thinking even uh uh this morning I began to think uh uh we we live in a time where everything has to be identified you you can't hide behind anything anymore if you try to hide behind you will be found out it's not time to be lukewarm I would say this morning it's not time to mix a little bit of a church and a little bit of of Christianity the scripture says it will vomit you out of his mouth if that's the way you are God is looking for people that are perfectly identified to the end time message that is given us it's not a time where we could say well I'll use the word when he suits me and I'll lose the world when I see that it works for me if you are that way this morning God will reject you God once is looking for a people that have given all that they are they want the word or nothing they want on Christ or nothing they're not interested in the mixing they're not interesting in being accepted by the world and and and good with the word world and everything and then come to church they're not interested in coming to church and going back it's a time where the true sons are Desiring the true manifestation of sons in the end time we are speaking of identification we could say we we we we live in a time when we look at the world around us people aspire to be uh like the great inventors it will want to be it used to be that we could save in the time of ramanam people looked at Hollywood star and they emulated them they wanted to identify with those people they wanted to be like them but yet today we have social media we have a great inventors like Elon Musk and Jeff bezo people look at those things and they want to live their lives and matching those people they want to do they want to be rich like those people they want to live and spend money like those people do even though they don't have anything they want people live and they work up in the mind they always emulate and try to be like something that's the mind of the world but we have read this morning that we the Church of God we have received the mind of Christ and the right of the end time his emulation is Christ identifying with him his emulation is he has received the word of God and nothing interests him what he wants is to see the identification of what the word said being manifested himself it's too late to be lukewarm this morning it's too late to try to figure out is it God or it's not God it's too late to try to find you will be left out this is the time where you have to sell out of everything you give out all that you have you'll die for the word you die and you are fully committed in order for you to see a result hi everyone there's no time to be a lukewarm or a Halfway Christian God doesn't take that he didn't provide his word his word has the power to make you what he desires for you to be this morning he's not giving us a half word as we heard it even has been preached just a couple of weeks ago throughout the services is that in this generation we have received the fullness of the word we have the mind of Christ with us to know what he wants done with the word we have received what was in the beginning that God was intending to do awesome now the scripture and I'll say this that the scripture tells us in Revelation chapter 22 and it says and and listen to this it says and he said unto me still not the saying of the prophecy of this book it says for the time is at hand this is the time for it it's not about back in the time past it's not the time oh just when the prophet was here no we leave it's a season it's not a day it's a season that we are living in this is the time and it says it says that he that is unjust let him be unjust till so this is not the time where there's a transformation to say well you know the world we can look at the world and say well the world will get better no that's not the promise of these this time it says he that is unjust will be unjust till it says and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still and he says and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his work shall be now I want to say this it's important you realize that the world is never going to get better all right there's not gonna be another gospel preached to the world so the world can be transformed and saved the scripture says the time is at hand where the world will continue to be in the situation that is in it will get worse and worse and worse but there's a people that have received the word of God where the scripture is telling us that he that is Holy let him be holy still in other words the message that will be preached to her will continue to keep her holy until the end time that message will continue to keep him holy every day so we can say this morning we are living in the time of identification where what God intended to do in the beginning what the whole program of God was about in the eve in the morning is now being manifested in the evening time this is the age of manifestation but when it says it's sea time it's the age of manifestation this is not the time to be here this is the time to be manifested and I want to say this we are not called to be Christians so we can hide in the closet while everybody is getting out of the closet we are living in a time where it's time for us to manifest what we were called to be foreign boldly and proclaim the word of God for what we have been called to be why because that's what God is expecting in the end time he didn't give you the word so you can be a somewhat of a or sacred question he gave you the word so you can be manifested in the world around you and the prophet tells us now let me read this we we listened to this when we were listening to God of this evil Age and and I hope I could bring this to your memory because they in fact this was part of my inspiration when I was looking at this he says now in uh the God of this evil age paragraph 56 it says the two Spirits it says one of them is God's holy spirit the other is the devil Spirit it says working in deception he says it says the people the people of the Earth are now making their choice now listen to this let me skip let me continue it says I'm making the choice the holy spirit is here calling out a bride for Christ he is doing it by vindicating his Word of Promise to her for this age showing that it is Christ and then he says if the finger's supposed to move and they say it's your finger will move if the food is supposed to move in his age the foot will move if the eyes is to see in this age the eyes will see it says the spirit of God has it grows into the full stature of God in the age that we are living in the Holy Spirit is here vindicating the message of the hour now let me say this the devil is calling out his bride too God is here to call out this bride people that were predestinated to be part of his kingdom people that were predestinated to be his representation in the end time and that's the time that God is is now sending his word to identify them and at the same time the devil is also calling out a people he's calling out by deception as the prophet tells us so he can call a bride for himself by error so she can manifest the things that he hears he says and and the spirit and the Holy Spirit is here doing that he doing this so that the people that believe that God that believe God will be called out in this chaos of the out of this chaos the devil and holy spirit is calling his church by error as usual it says by perversion of the word like he did in the beginning seed coming right back to the seed time again from Eden here it is again and I want to say this this morning let me say this this morning whether you you believe it or not or whether you you think it or not you are here making your decision on the same subject this morning you are here making your decision to your final destination whatever tells us he says it's the decision or the choices that we make every day that determines our Eternal destination yeah you you didn't just stumble in church this morning you decided to come to church this morning you decided to come here this morning and hear the word of God you made that decision you decide what you want to eat you decide what you want to drink you decide where you want to work you decide all of those things and I want to remind you this morning that those the combination of those decisions is that all together trying to show you where you are headed to that's why it's important we realize we there's no such thing as oh I'm just doing it and there's no consequences there's no such thing well I'm just gonna do this and and then forget about it and then I'll go the other way it's in that you make it's part of this something structure and it's leading you somewhere I believe this morning that God wants you to make the right decision he wants you let me say this you the the challenge that we run into is we have this double identification where we were born in sin and In the Flesh and all of those things and we know of those things but yet within us God has placed a seed which is a different identification from what the flesh is but yet we try to work by the natural thinking that that's the way God wants us to work and he's here by his word telling you that I want you to identify with a seed that I placed inside of you and make your decision based on the spiritual we just read it it says the natural man is not made to understand the spiritual things it's foolish says to him either the spiritual is foolishness to the Flesh and the flesh is uh foolishness through the spiritual but I said he said to you but you have the mind of Christ to understand what he wants to do when it's important that we really grasp this identification that the prophet is talking about and like I said it's important that our identification this this morning be a word based identification and not some man's made understanding about ourselves and what we think we we have to know within ourselves and if you don't it's important you pray for God to reveal this to you it's important that we understand that I believe this message because God chose me to believe it [Music] it's important you understand that I'm here this morning I'm sitting with this group of people from all over the world from all the countries from all over that I can never have been with under no other circumstance and the only reason I'm here with him is because God chose me to be here it's important when you wake up to put your shoes and to put your clothes to come to church and know that I believe this message because God let me know this message and because I've studied it it's not because my mother believe it my father believes it or somebody told me about it that's why I believe it now somebody may have told you about it but the true Revelation comes directly from God that's the kind of identification you need this morning otherwise it's all natural It's All Flesh and let me just say this before I can even move on anything that's flesh oriented will produce death anything that's flesh related will not take you anywhere anything that's flesh will only bring death but the identification the spiritual identification will bring God on the sea we we get caught up in a a flesh man and and a way of doing things in the flesh and you get sick or let me go get a Tylenol there this happen and you go but you forget that within that man there is a spiritual person that's waiting to be identified God is calling out every day and putting you in circumstances where he's wanting you to forget about the spirit the natural man and to focus on the spiritual men and say I may not understand it with my mind I may not be able to explain it with my mind but I know that there's a God in heaven who made his word available for him and that's what I believe this morning says he preached a message called Jesus keeps all his appointment Jesus keeps all his appointment and if he kept his an appointment in the first age it's the same God he's here to keep the evening time appointment of a group of people that he himself is calling out that he wants to manifest himself through them when you when you hear this message this morning it's not good enough for us to just gather and rejoice and say oh thank God for sending a messenger thank God what God is looking for is one person to stand up and say that's for me if you may not understand the unders you may not understand what the identification is but I want the identification to be a personal identification why do you believe it God placed Something in My Heart To Believe I I have seen it's gotten me out of trouble it's healed me from my sicknesses it saved me from Death it's gotten me out of my own trouble I've messed up so many times he kept doing it to me there's no way you can tell me something outside of that that's my identification I don't only know him by the word but I know him by the reality of him making himself known unto me oh I so enjoy the service on Wednesday because it's so important you realize God is moving you into another category Abraham was given the option oh his flesh gave him an option he says you can use that car look at you you are old you can't have a children all the symptoms were put together you passed the age and this is what happened there's never been under no he didn't have anybody to relate to to say well God give that one a child and on the old age I'm going to also have no all he had is a bucket full of symptoms of why he couldn't have a child and another side all he had is to believe the word of the Living God and Abraham had a choice to make all but he chose to believe the word of a living God and the word produced the son the word produced the son the word will produce a body change for you you don't have to look for it you just have to believe the word and let the word produce the body change foreign man has an identification we are our human identification is we give you a program you know in order for you to belong to a church we want you to write your name on the book we want you to pay your tithes and your offerings and and come and and tell us and you read the message you read the book and you read the Bible you are part of the Kingdom and and when we feel like that's not enough we begin to give you steps of what you should do oh these are the five steps in order to be pleasing to God this is what you need to do in order for you to be acceptable to God so what what that what happens is in the church denomination people move from one step to another they continue continually as the scripture says continually learning and never coming to any realization oh you know I did those I read those five steps in a practice I did all of them and nothing came well you know what I have the six step books over here yeah and and God and everything about God is always seemed to be a step uh more that you got to take and and you're going to just jump a little more and you didn't jump high enough you didn't do that's not the identification of the children of God let me just read here for a second before I move on all right now I'm talking about the true and the real true process of identification for the children of God in the end time now listen to what it says in in John chapter 15 and 16 it says ye have not chosen me I have chosen you so if you really want to get down to what identification is all about the first thing you got to realize is I didn't choose God the first thing you got to know is I didn't choose this I didn't make myself believe this message I had nothing to do with God I didn't choose religion God came and chose me God can have brought me out of my sin God came and saved me out of my worldliness God came and saved me because if it's your own identification it will fail you what about him says man likes to think that he saw he sought God you don't know how many churches I had to go before I found the message Church you don't know how much I have to give up before I could believe this message you don't know what I had to go through in order for Who and the honest is always on them they always says always that person like that will never get any further but it's a birth who understand I didn't want this I didn't choose this I didn't choose the family that I was going to be born in I didn't I didn't choose my parents I didn't choose my country I didn't choose where I came from and the same way that God did that he came back in the spiritual he chose you to be part of the Church of the end time without you doing anything to get it and you know what that does to you when you come to the end of your wits when you know you can't do it anymore the same God comes and he picks you up so he can bring you above oh I don't want something man-made I don't want my hands to be in there because every time I touch I mess up every time I touch it turn into some trouble but oh every time that God has come by he's always brought the answer so where the identification of men is always what is it that you can do to achieve what God desired I'll make an exception today where the identification of man is always what else can you do what else can you do the identification of God is I'm here because it wants me to be here and in fact I can even say that this morning we are no different from the people walking down the street right now no different no different at all Abraham was no different from any mortal on you know the only thing that made a difference was God calling out of his life foreign T we are nothing we will never amount anything more than his calling because that will always be the foundation under which we are built I'm here I'm fellowshipping with you because God has allowed me to be here in this Fellowship and any identification out of that will only bring a failure will only bring destruction will only bring a man's thinking but one of them says this in the message in the message Jehovah Jireh says he says no man can come to me except my father draws him it says and after the father has given and and and the father has given it to me and all that the father has given to me will come it says what are you scared about what are you afraid of what are we scared of what are we afraid of listen it continues on it says you say well maybe I'm just not the right kind of Christian it says how can you come to God without God calling you first and all that he foreknew he hath also called is that right all that he called he had also Justified is that right and all that he justified he had also past tense the prophet said glorified amen it says it's a finished work from the foundation of the world the identification of the end time it's a presentation of a finished work it's a presentation of the work that God has been Christ The Mystery of God revealed God is coming down and say I'm going to tell you now what I've been working on throughout all the church ages from the foundation of the world what I've been working towards all this time and I hit it through the devil and it took it I was in the body of Christ he came and he killed it and he thought I was the end of it not understanding that he was just bringing my fulfillment of the prophecy and the things that I wanted to do in the end time now it's coming in saying that all that I've been working on the Christ of the mystery of God revealed he is that I will have a bride in the end time of my own choosing he says don't you see you are living under your privilege and I just want to bring that out this morning we are living under our privilege by only identifying with the flesh that we carry every day we are living under a privilege when our first instant is always to come and and act out according to the flesh think according to the flesh examine the situation according to your mind and doing all of those things and and always always the flesh always I'll tell you this morning the world will accept you well brother Branham says and we rented this morning and I'll perhaps mention it he said let this mind that was in Christ be also in you it says that he taught it not robbery to be equal with God but when I'm says what it says he heads right after reading that statement he says he always believed the word he always believed the word so when we talk about the mind of Christ it's not some complicated things that we need to try to figure out or what is it that he wants to do what is he talking about the mind that was in Christ is that he always believed the word in fact in perfect Faith he says he believed what the word said about him he taught it beat in the flesh he taught it not robbery to be equal with God let me say this this morning Jesus was not hated because of his flesh in fact they were fine with the fact that he was the son of Mary oh they didn't have a problem with that when they got hungry and tired and all those things they didn't have a problem with that if he said it was the son of Joseph and Joseph uh taught him carpentry and how to make chairs and all those things that was never a stumbling block but the thing the scripture says that what they hated him for is that you that is a man you try to make yourself God you try to make yourself equal with God the world is not going to hate you if you dress like the world if you talk like the world if you eat the world food if you do what they do if you complain like they complain if you talk like they talk oh but the moment you put on your spiritual person your christ-like person that's when you'll have the problem awesome it's not the flesh that they hate it's that identification that dwells inside of you the seeds that has to identify with the word that God is sending this time that's what they hate whatever says in the message who it says to whom would we go he says he says something knocked at your heart you Rose up and you stood up to your feet and walked down here in the yard something draws you it says let me give you let me give you what the scripture says all that the father all that he foreknew he's called it says that was God calling you that was God calling you those who we call they also justify and those who justify yet so glorify them is giving you the the very identification of who you are in the word of God a word based identification a pastor talked about the five identification of the true church at the end time I'll say this this is the reason why often time you you see someone who who has listened to the message for for who's been in the message for 30 years 40 years and they come and they walk away and and someone who's been day in and day out and has claimed to have met the Living God they walk away the problem comes is people try to identify with a letter instead of letting the spiritual identification work within their lives people try to have big explanation for everything and they know everything that the messenger said and they know what it means and they know all of those things and and yet the life is less and less reflection of everything that they know oh I rather have a life full of redundification that my of identification and and full of the word that I cannot explain they come to the place where instead of letting the same spirit that wrote the word dwelling them and bring the same life my brother my sister what we need this morning it's not a lot of knowledge what we need this morning is the holy spirit making the little bit of word that we have heard the little bit of work that we have come in contact with let him bring that to life if all you know this morning is that Christ died for you ask him to make it alive to you if all you know this morning is Christ Is A Healer ask him to make it real to you we don't need the whole container so if I arrive D it is everywhere to be quickened everywhere to be made alive everywhere to bring the perfect identification so we can come into the image of the person we can say like brother Burnham they're telling you don't know your Bible but I know the author wear well because I have met him and I have talked to him in fact there's been things which I say unto you he's the one who told me about him someone can come and say you know when the problem talks about the woman at the well do you know it's the angel that told him about it it's the angel someone he says a lot of things oftentimes we think oh he just read the Bible he says this and says that some of the things I'm telling you they don't come by just some uh men studying the book and comparing scripture with scripture or just coming reading here and reading there and reading this the study Bible and this so it says what I'm telling you it comes by divine inspiration by divine revelation God is here manifesting his word to his people and that's what we heard in this generation it says so it is your spiritual birth I'll move on quickly after this it says you do things you don't understand when you are a little baby you come to the altar you give your heart your life to Christ he says you do such thing it's a strange thing you wonder why you eat you did it but after a while when you mature as a mature Christian you understand it it says there's something picked up you see why you had to do it it says your spiritual birth your natural birth types your spiritual birth it says how how it fitted it fitted you in this life as you grow everything fitted right in because you were made for that I don't know about you but this message just seemed to fit right in right in he says it wasn't it strange things that the night that you staggered into the mission tendon the meeting and all the little church somewhere on the corner and it says something the preacher the preacher preached on in certain subject and you felt right at the altar see God knew that and then he says before the foundation of the world it seemed strange to you it says why you did that then but now you understand it says you knew what happened it's so feeding to you in this life and it says and it will also be in the life that is to come let me say this when we talk about the Rapture or the change of body but one of them is telling us it's only a changing of Dwelling Places it's not the change of nature the nature the new nature we receive it while we're still here it's not oh you got all your worldliness and everything all of the sudden you get a body change and you are changed in your soul now your soul is changed while you are here the preaching of the word is here to clean your soul to perfect the character to bring you into the image of manifestation to bring you into that place when that change your body takes place it's only a change of Dwelling Places amen that's why it's important that we hear the word of God because it's the molding character the prophet tells us we won't take anything outside of our character we won't take anything the only thing we'll take over there will be our character now he says I want to just say this this morning it's the word of God that performs the identification the word of God identify the season under which we are living in to tell you that in the last days men will be it tells you about all that the situation or the man's condition will be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God hiding a high-minded they will hate each other there will be rumors of wars and Wars over here it gives you the perfect description of what type of identification they will have and the same word of God it comes to a group of people and it says that in the end time I will have a bride of my own choosing the scripture speaks about Philip and Nathaniel in John 1 and 14 it says that if Philip came and he came to Jesus and and he went and and after he had met with Jesus and he went and called Nathaniel he says oh he came and says I want you to come and and meet Jesus and he says oh could anything good come out of Nazareth he knew uh the reputation of Nazareth and all those things but Philip told him he says why don't you just come and see and the prophet tells us perfect answer it says just come and see for yourself and so Nathanael comes and as he comes before Jesus Jesus being the word looks at Nathaniel and says Behold a Jew in whom there's no guile the word identified exactly who he was and Philip looked at him that Daniel looked at him and says Master he says when have you known me it says before Philip called you when you were under the tree I I saw you before Philip called you when you were under the tree I saw you oh my brother my sister our calling is not just because when we were born I'm calling but when I'm texting right back in fact I'll read it here says the the identification at the end time is the returning to what was in the beginning is the returning or what God purpose for you to be when you come on Earth let me say that sin stepped in because of the way we were born we came and we forgot our true identification we were given the identification of the world your name is John and and this is the parents that you come in and this is the country that you come and all those things but in the end time when the world comes the identification is not returning you to your parents the identification is to return you right back to the purpose that God placed you on this planet for and I want to ask this morning what what is your heart desire for identification when you wake up in the morning when you consider your days when you consider your time when you consider the things that you are involved in what identification arises from your heart let me say this this the morning we we we get born in the world and I know we have to work in fact the world is set up in such a way you were born and you have to be educated for some 18 years and get a piece of paper and and call yourself an engineer oh I'm a doctor and I'm a lawyer I'm such and such and and it seems like we put more value in that identification more than what God has called us to be we contend to with our whatever job we have and the the the the the reaches we have in this world we we go around we have no problem say I'm a builder I'm such and such I'm a mechanic I'm this and I'm all of this and we have no problem but we have a problem saying I'm a son of God don't be conformed to this world be it transformed by the renewing of your mind let's let don't let your your the things and I'm not saying go quit your job and go do this go do that I'm just saying whatever you do let the identification that God has given you take priority over everything about you I thought about myself I said what if God was to ask me to quit my job I thought well it'll be interesting I'd wonder how he would talk to me my goodness he would have to shut everything up I mean it's like the light will have to shine and the doors will have to shut down I mean it would have to be a terrible thing it's kind of a mind we're like an ostrich our head is just this is what I got to do this is what I gotta do I got to make money I gotta do this I gotta do this I gotta pay the bills and then the more work you do the less money you make and the more money you make the more bills it comes it never works out I added hours to my job in fact you know I joke that I would make the same if I was working at McDonald's but that's our daily identification we constantly I mean we we there's always much to do than this time you know this oh I don't have time for that I don't have time for that because why we continually continually just being involved and the devil is pulling here pulling here you got two jobs no that's not enough you need a third one so you can pay that out of Bill and and then you got the third one no that's not enough because you can't say for vacation you get another one all of a sudden you drive yourself crazy neurotic age people don't have enough to be satisfied the only thing that will satisfy the soul is the revealed word of the hour let me tell you this morning identify with God and you will be happy with your life whether you make five dollars an hour or you make a million dollars an hour it's not about money it's about the proper identification your soul is not at peace it's not because of your job it's because of the wrong identification it's because you're constantly looking for happiness in the things that don't produce any happiness you get in god it don't matter what you have or what you don't have you know God will provide for you he says I never seen a righteous bad Bread have you ever tried that before have you ever had an experience of that before you try him and he will make his word a reality to you we run ourselves down you know talking with my father-in-law we're talking and I made a comment I said it's just the the world is getting in such a pressure that the body cannot handle this body is not made to do the amount of things that we make it do a day you know in the back in the days you know if I was going to come to visit you it was probably a whole day event you know if I would have to get on my horse or if I would have to walk or whatever I know there's no other place I'm gonna be I'm just going to go and we're going to spend time and I'll come back no now I can visit five people in the same day I'll go here I'll go here and then after that I'll go do my groceries I'll go do this I'll fill up my day to the Brinks foreign you do that you still got more to do how come I'm not satisfied I did so much can I not take the next day off no that's the world identification that's the world that we're living in never satisfy always seeking always wanting always looking but God has an identification for his people and we say this this morning uh the time is running out before before I could run out of time you know but if one of them says this they all that what God always had against Israel was the fact that they never wanted to identify only with God God called them to be God made him so he can be king over them guess what they wanted a worldly King we want to dress like the world we want to talk like them we want to be like hola either God provided for them they never in fact God fought their battle God placed them in the position where all the nations will know that the god of Israel is the real God God did all of that for them he was there providing to every one of us he gave them a land they never deserved he he drove after the inhabitants of those lands but guess what they still want it to be like other nations we want to sing like they sing we want to dress like they dress we want to worship we will bring other gods you know they have we only have one God they have multiple gods why don't we bring the other gods let's not be like that church let's be a single-minded person let's be his person a people whose heart is set on one thing I know I have to work I know I have to do this I know I have to take care of my family but all of this God I want everything I do to be in the identification that you called me to be if the church door opens God I want to have the ability to come to your house and worship you if I have a job that I have to work on Sunday I pray God that you give me the opportunity because I don't want to be a representation of the world I want to be your representation you give me that opportunity to do it you give me away you help me Lord God you provide for me a job that will let me come to serve you and let me say this this morning those that come here it's not because they are stronger than you are he says because they believe the word they have laid they know that if I go with doubt God will provide for me so I call upon you this morning to say God I want the same thing I I don't want to be Reliant in fact I don't want to just go and say well I quit my job because no I want to be inspired to do what you want me to do we want to be a people inspired we want to be a people revelated people that know God oh that's what the scripture the prophet said the people that know their God the people that understanding God those people will do exploit that's the message of the hour yeah and I asked you this morning do you know your God up in the Red Sea he's the God who stopped the sun it's it's it's scientifically impossible to stop the sun it doesn't make any sense but your god did it it makes sense to open the right sea but your god did it it doesn't make sea to try Jordan but your god did it it doesn't make sense that a person who's a drug addict who loves the word and tomorrow can wake up change your god did it foreign we are called to be progressing you cannot be born again and be here and then from then I'll begin to regress that's not the kind of God we serve it's a God who builds experience upon experience and who builds Revelation upon Revelation who builds liveliness upon liveliness no the scripture says in the Book of Judges chapter 6 I won't read it I was going to read it but the 100 we run out of time he speaks about Gideon now I want you to realize here before your identification comes it's the word that's actually giving you your identification without this message we don't know who we are we are lost just like the world is lost we don't have anything to present we have anything to preach without this message so watch this Gideon he's a coward Gideon he's here working in darkness or walking under a tree trying to hide the seed because the Mennonite came and they kept taking the seeds away is here scared but the angel showed up and says thou Mighty Man of Valor I'm sure Gideon turned around and said I don't think you're addressing to me if you knew what I was doing here you wouldn't call me a money man or Valor thinking right now you wouldn't call me a Manny Man or father now we know the nation of Israel they had seen against God and so God allowed for there for for them to be dispossessed of the Grain and they came in the trash all the fields and all those things it was God allowing them but yet he comes in that time where they were completely dispossessed and he raises a man called Giddy and he calls him Mighty Men of Valor all right brother and if I could it speaks again of Mary in Luke 1 and 28 it says and the angel came to her and say hail thou our highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed are thou among women the scripture says and she said unto him she said she was troubled and said and cast in our mind what manner of salutation it should be highly favored what have I done highly yeah it says Mighty Man of Valor now I want you to realize by believing what the angel told him by believing what the angel told Gideon it brought him to be to come the Mighty Men of Valor by Mary believing what the angel told her she became a highly favored and produced the son that was supposed to come she bear the son now it's supposed to come now before I say it let me just read it but one of them says it says if the Life of Christ lives in the person excuse me for a second The Life of Christ lives in a person they become identified with him it's Christ in you not a church member not a system but a resurrected power it's the Holy Ghost it's a token upon you that your life says Amen to every scripture the promise is written in there think of this it says and you are not yourself no more you are Christ you don't think your own thought you don't think you're taught you don't think your thoughts you say I think I have no thoughts coming the life that was in Christ is in you the mind that was in Christ is in you the work that Christ that that was the works that was in Christ is in you and Christ himself is in you you are dead your life is hid in God through Christ sealed in there by the Holy Ghost you are not your own that's what we are called to identify with and you probably have heard me read this but I will read it anyhow it says God is promising his word how that he will choose his bride in the last day did you know that he promised that he will do it by his original plan of choosing Christ of choosing the time choosing the season and it can't miss it on his bride because she is part of that word it says he can't choose it by a denomination when he didn't choose Christ by denomination he says did Christ come to a denomination did he come by a denomination no they rejected him well that's what the denomination done then when he chooses a bride can he come any other way how did how did he bring Christ here by the word of the prophets I tell you this statement is written in my heart they supposed to be things in the message when you hear it just brings the whole life of you it brings you alive it says by the words or for prophet he said is that right how will he bring his bride here by the word of a prophet how did he identify him when he came by a man with the spirit of Elijah upon him it came out of wilderness how will he identify his bride he says he promised in malachite for the same thing before he destroys the Earth like he was in the days of Sodom now let me skip some here I'll continue here he says he says he says it says the word the evening message must carry out the Evening result the evening message might show the evening seed not the morning seed evening seed is that right the Midway sea the Midway scene it's seed back there was the nomination it died perished but the evening message will show evening time light will show evening time results the evening time message Jesus time Midway message show the Midway result the beginning message show the beginning results make creation he made his own he he made his son in his own image in the Midway in the evening time he makes he makes a bride for it he says see what by his word he says how did he form the Earth how did he speak it into existence by his word he says how did these how how was his son the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh and dwell Among Us how will he take his bride by the word not by a new card not by some Theologian ideas but according to his word he will identify her don't put one thing or take it away one thing from it now live it the way it is he says so now here he is he's now showing us what a perfect identification is the identification is the prophet Messenger will come and will speak the word a virgin shall conceive and not what will travel out through wages and angels and it will come and dwell in the womb of Mary because she was a Believer and she will produce the Son and the word will come into manifestation said he said he did it the same when he made creation he did it when he did Christ and in the end time how will the Bride come he will use the prophet Messenger to come and speak the word not just to identify the wound the bride but to bring her into existence what a privileged people well that the Living God will come down and it will make himself known unto us that we could sit at the table and join and eat of the seven course meal that we will come this morning and say that I am a member in fact it says one place that I call you no longer church I'll call you bride it's specific designation why is he identifying you that way so you can take your position a church is just a church but a bride is a different identification thank you you know when you are single and when we get married responsibility changes you a single man cannot behave like a married man or a married man cannot be like a single person when you change because of the new designation your responsibility change the things that you do change the way you think change the way you walk change why because it's of the designation that you have received and the word is telling us today don't walk according to this flesh fight it with the spiritual representation you've been given stand upon the word and let your re-identification be a word pace don't let it be your own mind your own interpretation if God said it let him bring it to pass let him bring into pass if the musician could come this morning speaks about the young men with amnesia who had been the war and with all the traumas and everything that he experienced he became he had an Amnesia and and what they would do is they were called family members those that can identify and if the person can identify something they'll take him out and all the others they'll put them in an institution and they said that they put them on the train they were taking them on the way to the institution and then but then they made a stop somewhere so they can take a break and and then to let all this young men with amnesia out and those young soldiers and he said this young man got out of the train and and all of a sudden he just began to wander taking steps away from the others and and he began to walk a little Trail and they said one man came he was trying to bring him in the conductor the the men in charge said no don't don't touch him just let him go this let's watch him he began to take steps and take steps and take steps and and all of a sudden he met her right and he made a left and and it just seemed like he looked offense to kind of looked familiar he didn't have a way to grasp it but he just sounded good to him he just made sense to him he couldn't tell you well he until that time he didn't even know what his name was but he continued to follow and all of a sudden they saw a water tower he says wait a minute that that water tower means something to me he began to walk and he made and he made another left and another right and and suddenly He Came Upon across this yard and and they said the prophet said it says the father was there just waiting for him and he knew that he had a son and the son came and when he looked at him and all of a sudden he just clicked he recognized oh that's my son and that's my father and he came and he hugged them and everything taking him in a familiar pathway allowed him to come back to who is realization of who he really was my brother my sister that's what the word of God in the end time is doing it's just trying to take you right back from where you were in the beginning he talked to you about justification you heard something like you heard before you looked at yourself like the boy in the mirror you said oh I like some justification and he talked about scientification you say I want some of that and and he talked about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and said God I want to be baptized and I want to receive what I'm saying in the Bible I want to see I want to receive what I'm hearing from your scripture and all of a sudden you get the Holy Ghost it's not about what you wanted you come into the realization that this is what you always been and you are returning back to it don't let your identification be how much work you have to do to please God let your identification be this morning that something is calling me in my heart I don't understand it I'm just following the steps that God is putting in place in front of me says people read the Bible it says and the description of what a Christian being he said a Christian should not lie a Christian should not do this and lesson and they take the Bible and said I'm not gonna lie and I'm gonna do this today you'll end up a failure you will end up exactly where you started but oh let his Spirit come inside of you it will first show you the things that are in you that you don't want and it will start to work on it one by one it will take out the desires of the world you will no longer enjoy the things of the world you will no longer enjoy those things it will come in you and give you the strength to overcome those things if you have something you don't like this morning just lift your hand and say God your word says not to do it I'm still doing it I pray this morning that your spirit
