Description:
Sunday Evening Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
January 28, 2024
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

father father that we may come to know you and all that you would have to share with us we ask these wonderful things in jesus' name amen you may be seated tonight thank you we're going to have uh brother Cosman and brother Leon uh give us a little testimony of their trip that they have just got back from uh uh over in Romania and we just trust that the Lord continues to do uh great works there um you know I I was just thinking this uh after service this morning you know the how beautiful everything was laid out and you know brother brand made the statement he said that all these things are in their place just to prove that the message is timely that's so everything testifies of God's word you know just no matter how that you look around and you know it's we talked about the two eding of you know in the Garden of Eden the scripture said that Adam and Eve uh that they were veiled from the fact that they were naked that they didn't know that that they were unclothed in any way because they were veiled by the word of God that uh wasn't even there but isn't it strange that though in the first Eden God's Eden Adam and Eve uh were uh blind you know to the fact that they were naked and now we come over in our day and they're blind to the fact that they're naked they're blind miserable poor wretched and naked and don't even know it and and you know and so brother brand referred to it you know they they're out there taking their clothes off it's and it don't even bother them you know what I mean the poor sons and daughters of God they have to struggle with it but yet here it is those two great Edens run in parallel you know and the our greatest joy is is that we know that we're going back to the eating that we come from amen so uh if we just got to continue pressing the great Mark and everything just kind of an update on um our progress uh next door um so we got to this week coming up and if if we get all the help we got can get and everything falls together uh I would think by the end of next week we'd be pretty much done uh with the physical construction of it and the following week we should be able to put in our carpet and then the following week we should be able to have the pews in and then we'll call on about 50 sisters to go clean the whole place up because it's dusty and uh so if all those things go well and the city fathers will let us in uh that's the biggest hurdle you know is the city they always come up with something so we have we have have the occupancy inspection and then we have the Ada inspection and uh so that uh there's all kinds of handicap requirements we have to make and and um I'm sure that there's always something they want us to do and then uh there's the Fire Marshall inspection so we just have to get all all those little things right and and they always come along and they say make this door open this way and put this up higher put that lower and we read all the all the things we can read to make sure we do it right and so I bought some some little things and it said Ada approved you know in other words this is the Cs me out and then you you have the Ada person come up and they don't see it that way and so we just pray that we can get all that worked out and uh get it cleaned up they're supposed to turn the heat on uh maybe Monday uh get everything for our heat we'll have our heat on and our air conditioning on and then we're going to U um see about deciding whether we want to get it all cleaned up and move in there so we'll just play it by year uh everybody asked me when the first service would been I was trying to go for March 31st of that's Easter but we may be able to have a service before then so I just pray and we'll have to move the piano over there so we'll get a a piano moving company so the last piano moving company we had they dropped it so poor sister Rebecca she was standing back there filming and all of a sudden I heard this gasp and they had dropped her piano so that was a that was a pretty uh uh Dreadful thing but we'll try to get it all moved over so when we come to that spot what we'll do is we'll have one service here Sunday evening and then no service uh the Wednesday that we're moving and then if everything goes well we sh will have a service so that's where we are um we have some mats that we put out so if you go do start going in there wipe your feet um be real careful uh some kids crawled up under our electric lifts and we're playing on the lifts so parents um don't um let your kids play on any of the machinery and the only other thing we have to do is we have to pray for our sound people that they get all their sound in in time lots of prayers there for am for the sound person Mike's hiding it back uh but anyway we can do it huh amen Lord's been good to us and you'll I know we don't might need much room tonight uh we're going to feel like a big empty uh space over there uh maybe we can get our Sunday evenings up a little bit but you'll have plenty of room and and U we just trust it'll be a blessing and then we can start getting uh this together um I've got with brother Tim and uh Syer he's going to take care of our Sunday school for us and we're going to have a meeting with all the Sunday School teachers so we can understand all the technology uh that you want for Sunday schools so we're going to build some classrooms and then we'll have a place here that you'll be able to come to in between between Services um one of the things we're going to have to do is we're going to make some changes on some things there's no need to make changes now but we're going to try to make some changes in the order of things but we're going to have a lot of rules how many loves rules how many be believe that rules are made to be broken see yeah uh no so we're we have we don't have all the rules figured out you know who makes the rules don't you it's the people that do something crazy and then you have to come up with a rule you know so uh uh we want to have this to be a nice place that you can wait in between services and uh and I I think we'll probably allow you to eat if you clean up um and we'll have a little more of Fellowship area so you just pray for us uh everything that we're doing we're doing to make it easier uh for you and more beneficial to our our our kids so we can have some real good Sunday school have all the equipment and things that they need and we should have some pretty good uh sound over there um I guess they got all kinds of stuff you know that I never heard of before I didn't think we needed it all you know I I just thought we needed a microphone in the speaker you know what I mean but now they can make all the singer sound good and and uh uh they got special spotlights on me that uh somebody told me you're going to look awful white up there I said well I hope I can look Angelic okay you know what I mean so uh uh but anyway they got these big spotlights they're supposed to take all the Shadows off of you you know what I mean so I think I was blind now I got up there I really couldn't see so um but anyway it it's it's it's yours I I I I really want you to understand that that the church is in your name you know it's it's not in my name name you know I could have set it up that way where you know I own the buildings I own the property it was all in my name and but I didn't you know so it belongs to you so you can get rid of me and still have the building so that's just how we set it up because we want you to have the pride of ownership so let's just pray that we have a good week ahead of us that we can get everything in and uh we can get it cleaned up and then U uh everybody can start decorating or doing whatever you do in a church I don't know what you call it and we'll pray that the sound people get everything done and and maybe in a few weeks we can have a service anybody would like that you like a a little more space a little more space between pews a little soft softer pews the pews they have a special system now where all the spaces are numbered on the Pew and so everybody kind of has their space and then we have an electric shock so if anybody falls asleep we yeah and and or if we need the whole congregation to say Amen we we just we just press a button you know everybody thinks we ought to be be have a little more excitement so we're going to build in excitement you know build in excitement so uh we'll be able to uh have stimulation and uh now that's not true I I I I just wished it was true but uh so anyway it's been a long journey um then we'll start uh discussing with everybody so uh uh we appreciate all your help uh so sisters if uh you want to start coming and cleaning uh you can start cleaning step by step and if you want certain pictures or something you want you know so the if the sisters want to decorate your bathroom go ahead I don't care just don't paint the walls if we want to hang pictures and and whatever we don't care the nurseries will get the furniture we can talk about that so uh don't be afraid to give your ideas I've turned down lots of ideas so it doesn't affect doesn't offend me anyway whatsoever we hope we we're hope we're you're happy with the the colors we hope you're going to be happy with the carpet we hope you're going to be happy with the building and we we hope it's just going to be more comfortable uh for you to enjoy the Lord there's going to be more space so you can run a little bit and have room to come to the Altar and pray and and so we just trust that it' be a blessing to you amen so you love the Lord tonight amen I guess we You' been up here we might as well sing a song right so why don't we just stand we'll sing only believe as uh we turn the service back over to at Cosmic how many believe all things are possible he amen amen you know that's uh I was fellowshipping with a man today and he he gave me a testimony and then I'd like to share it with you he said you know Brother David he said when I grew up in my family uh uh he said my my mother prayed and he said the faith of our family was built in prayer she said when I he said to me he says when uh when any of us children got sick we didn't go to the doctor first and then prayed we always prayed first and he said because of it we didn't go to the doctor that often and then he said my my life situation changed and and I I was amongst people that the anytime they got sick they ran to the doctor and he said then one of my children became sick and and they were having a trouble and and they wanted to take him to the doctor take him to the doctor he said that wasn't the way I was raised so we tried the doctor and the doctor thinks he said finally he said I decided to go back to my roots amen he said and I prayed amen and he said it was all over then amen and and I I I hope that you understand my heart and my heart is that what was promised to us is that the Faith of Our Fathers would be restored and the Holy Spirit when Jesus sent the Holy Spirit not only did it UE them with power from on high but it brought to them remembrance of everything that Jesus taught amen and then when they were brought to the remembrance of what Jesus taught what Jesus taught the word is what empowered them amen so if for whatever lies ahead for us which we know the world's getting worse we are going to have to increase our faith amen we're going to have to move to the Realms of faith and so let's let's just pray that our faith can grow and that we can only believe amen our prophet's theme song oh oh believe only believe all things are [Music] possible oh believe all things are [Music] possible let's sing Lord I [Music] believe make it [Music] personal I believe all things are [Music] conable I Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible oh he said wherever two or three are gathered I'll believe Jesus is here oh [Music] Jesus [Music] Jesus is here all things are possible now I believe let's sing the fifth verse now I believe oh now I believe Hallelujah now I believe all things are possible now I I believe now I believe now I believe all things are possible [Music] now amen is the word of all praise tonight let's just bow our heads as we just Lord we pray before you this evening Lord we pray tonight that you would be among us Lord we just want to share our heart and the testimonies of what you have done for us Lord you are the same yes yesterday today and forever and you never change because you've predestinated a seed that would believe you upon your word that would never fade away that would never walk anywhere else but in your word and Lord we're here tonight just wanting to Fellowship around the word of God and to know what you're doing in our hearts Lord what good will it do to gain the whole world and lose our soul it's not even worth it Lord we just want to be in your image we want to be molded and we want to be the image of your Masterpiece father we want our faith to walk into that image Lord that you had in the beginning that the one that you had in the thoughts in the thoughts of your mind that's where we want to be and we want to be the true genuine expression of Jesus Christ because he was a sinless lamb a lamb without spot or wrinkle he was perfect and we overcome because he overcame and we're here tonight because he over came and we thank you Father we just thank you for your word we thank you for the testimonies we've heard so far and Lord the word this morning we've been so blessed Lord that you've identified our hearts and Lord the spoken word is the Original Seed because that's what was in the beginning when you spoke something you you you you provided evidence behind your word father and so we're standing here behind the evidence of your word that you are the same yesterday today and forever we commit this little time of Fellowship in your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you um let's just open with the scripture if you don't mind turning since we're standing let's turn to First John chapter 3 we won't be preaching tonight we're just going to share our heart and what the Lord is done for us while we were away and we need to be stimulated we need to be be motivated by the word of God because if there's no word behind it it doesn't produce life amen and when the word's behind it what happens is is now God fulfills his word in our life if we believe upon his word amen not pervert it not take one word away from it not add to it but just keep it simple keep it genuine and believe upon his word because he is the same amen let's just read 1 John chapter 3:18 to 24 amen it says my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence towards God I want to ask you tonight do you have confidence towards God because God is not a god of History God is not a god of 2,000 years ago that people preach God is a god of today amen and his word is life his word is peace amen so when your heart doesn't condemn you then we have confidence towards God amen amen and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight and this is his Commandment that we should believe on the name of the son Jes on his son Jesus Christ and love one another as he gave us the commandment and he that keepeth his Commandments dwelleth in him and he in him and hereby we know that which abideth in Us by the spirit which he gave what which he had given us amen God bless you you can have your seats we just want to I wanted to read this quote before we get started just to see what What God Says in his word because when God deals with his sons you know the sons of of God they're led by the spirit of God and the spirit brings them to the revealed word of the hour and gives them truth and the truth that that God reveals to a son or a daughter what happens is is now they're they're becoming the image that God is revealing to his son or to his daughter and it's it's only by the revealed truth of the hour there's no other way amen it's got to come by the revealed truth of the hour and just as Brother David was preaching this morning you know we have to to have faith amen amen faith is of God faith is of god brother Bram says this in perfect faith and I just want to read this because I want this to be the foundation we want to make sure that we he deserves all the glory it's not something that man's doing it's something that God is doing and it's his word that now is leading his children to look for that last soul yes amen and and and now the word also bring us maturity brings us into a faith that Jesus Christ had a faith that we were able to be restored to a faith that the prophet was able to come in our generation and restore it back to what it was in the beginning what was the faith in the beginning it was the pure genuine word of God not mixed with anything else amen and the word of God is pure amen Amen brother bam says in perfect Faith but as long as you're doing things that's wrong you can't have confidence towards God so now he's just he's just he's talking here I I don't know the paragraph in in the table but it says but as long as you're doing things that's wrong you can't have confidence towards God perfect Faith 1963 so you see you'll aut automatically know that you're wrong it says you automatically put yourself back there a sinner by knowing that you're wrong but when when your heart don't condemn you you know you are a Believer and there's nothing between you and God you can ask and and and it says you can ask what you will and know that it'll be given because it's the word word that's given to you just like it was to those disciples now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are amen is to have faith in what you are it says have faith in the in in what the word says you are amen I'm going to repeat that one more time it says to have faith it says have faith in what the word says you are and Jesus had faith in the word of God and said what he was it says it is written of me didn't David in the Psalms and in the prophets and all of them that speak of him says I am the bread of life that came from God out of Heaven amen I am it says I am the Tree of Life from the Garden of Eden I am all these things it says I am that I am and he knew with that perfect faith that he was anointed a messiah he says that the spirit of God was upon him he said now I myself do nothing but it's my faith in God and it says and God was in him and the Word was made man manest and when the word of God comes in you it's made manifest for you are a Believer see and a Believer is the faith of God that moves in you amen amen it says you like that I like it when it says I I I like teaching of I like teaching of where it says what faith really is it says no knowing who he was without a shadow of doubt he knew he was the son of God he knew it for the word identified it says the word of God identified who he was he said if I do not the works of my father don't believe me but if I do then believe the works for they are the manifested word promised praise God it says oh if you could just wake up to that yeah okay if you can wake up to that brother brandom talks about a subconscious in an individual waking up to the conscience of the individual the identity of the subconscious that's within you to the conscience that now you have in this flesh but if I do then believe the works for they they are manifested word promised oh if you could just wake up to that get it you see the word itself identified him who he was and he said who can condemn me of sin in other words who can show me that my life and my Works don't fulfill exactly what Messiah should do nobody could say nothing for he was then he had Faith to believe then whatever he said would happened then he turned around and said the works that I do shall you also a little while and the world seeth me no more ye shall it says yet you shall because I'll be with you even in you it says take no thought what ye shall say for it's not you that speaketh it's not you that speaks it's my father that dwelleth in you he's the one that does the speaking and it's not me it's the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works see what I mean it says now the identification of a scripture is as over scripture Christian these words said Jesus these signs shall follow them that believe now how can you call yourself a believer of people and deny those words how can you call yourself a Believer and deny any of this word see you can't do it you're not a Believer therefore science can't follow you because you just accept what you want to believe and let the rest of it says you don't believe it but you've got to take the whole thing and believe it amen amen and when you truly believe not make believe but really believe then the sign follow them that believe it says oh could you compare a Christian today with them Christians of long ago how them disciples walked in the power of the spirit moved by the Holy Ghost it says just a prisoner as I preached on the other night a prisoner to the word and the will of God he said he couldn't even move until God moved him wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that he says it's going to it's going back it's got to come that's right it's on the road now I believe amen that's the power of of this message in The Bride of Jesus Christ amen when we're all about the father's business and so as many of you know last year we were in Romania for quite a while we we were there for about 7 weeks we we first started with brother Matthew he was preaching in the youth meeting in Romania and we were there for four or five days and brother Matthew came back and me and my family stayed for a few weeks longer we were there for seven weeks and you know when the word of God when the message of the Hour really brings you to the revelation of Jesus Christ and all your soul wants to do is long for the ones that are lost when you see the revealed word of the hour when the message of the hour can take flesh then your your heart is no longer about you your your life is no longer to serve your own purpose but now is to go and and to preach the gospel to reflect the life of the hour and to go get the ones that are lost because there's a compassion there that God had placed into a believer's heart amen and that's his love and his love is there to redeem those that are lost those that are still out and so we're privileged people Saints we're just family tonight amen can we just amen we're we're just we're just testifying we're not preaching we're just testifying of what God's doing but Jesus Christ is the same and so when God deals with our hearts now there's a burning now there's a desire for us to be able to share this light that God has revealed to us when God reveal feels his word to us it's no longer for us to to retain but now is to be given because now out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Waters amen and the truth that's in you could now produce the life in that other in that other soul that may be thirsting for life amen and and so we were in Romania for 7 weeks we were we were just there with my family it was really a blessed that it it was a blessed trip it was it was really a testimony to have my family there you know that's that's where I grew up that's that's where my f that's where we're from and that doesn't doesn't make us Romanian citizens or American citizens we're all citizens of the heaven amen we don't we don't carry an identity In the Flesh even though we were born there we were born all over the world but we're here in Bedford Texas tonight right 156 16 17 different countries this is not something that man's done right this is not something that man was able to just put together because if man would have done this it would have been possible but God by a revealed word brought a seed out of all kinds out of all Nations and brought them together Under One Roof for a purpose and the purpose is is to reveal the life of Jesus Christ now in the bride amen she's supposed to reflect life yes and so when we go out we want reflect life we want to reflect this gospel we want to reflect this life and so we were on the road seven weeks we were we were just traveling and it was it was really a a blessed time to see my family my children enjoy really the uh the fellowship around the the other believers you know this message produces the same life Saints it produces the same exact love and the Capstone is divine love is a go of Love is a love now that you can you can reflect one to another how will they know that you are my disciples for the love that you have one for another you can't fake Divine love there's only one source of life that could give us Divine love and that's God because God is love amen and so we were there for 7 weeks and we come back it was really a a huge testimony while we were down there there the Lord had done so many testimonies we we had issues with our vehicle our some of our wires on our engine burned and and somehow we were able to drive 900 miles with the with the wires that were just when I got back and returned the vehicle to the rental place the guy looked at me and he says I don't know how in the world you made it here but this vehicle shouldn't even been driving your radiator should have been shouldn't have been blown up your your clutch fan should have been done you should have blown an then and I said you know what my friend I said I serve a living God I didn't have fear I didn't I didn't I didn't know what it was I was like Lord you know what it is I'm just walking forward in it we had AC we had I mean car was running great car was running great but you know that's God that's Faith that's not looking at the negative that's not looking at what the devil could throw your away now you're looking at the promise of God and when God gives a promise now it produces life amen so you know that that was a testimony for my family they were able to see God come upon the scene while we were together so we come home and you know God's just dealing with the heart and he's continuing to dealing with the heart and you know the the the trip that we took this time was was a more specific trip for me because God has been dealing with my heart for the past few months and to just sharing my heart and and to the people of Romania there's there's been a few there's been a few um Brothers out of the southern part of the country that just kind of started contacting us directly and we've been sharing our heart with them and you know they were in a process of you know brother Matthew knows and I believe um I don't know brother Andrew Made It by there but brother Matthew knows this they were they were gathering into a home they didn't have anywhere to they didn't have anywhere to to gather and but it didn't matter to them they they got a source of life and all they wanted to do is is not forsake the Assemblies of coming together so they wanted to gather together and so when we started you know the work down in Romania 3 four years ago God has continually just building it and building it and and so they they were able to receive a few donations and now they've they were able to raise a building uh there was a a donation that was even made from from here and and so it was it was for the benefit of the body there they were able to raise a building and now they're gathering in a building and now God is is giv them a place where they can gather together and they can they can have services and they can hear the word of God they can hear what the God is doing and so are we privileged Saints are we privileged Saints there's there's there's there's churches and there's other people that that that don't have the the what we have and we should be thankful to the Lord of what God has given us and and and so as the Lord's just been dealing with the heart in in a specific Direction I wanted I wanted God to do something for me on this trip it was very specific it was really something that I was looking forward to I was you know and and I didn't know how it was going to unfold we just prayed before the Lord and so as the Lord as the Lord just opened up the opportunity you know it's amazing how God just puts all things in order if we're just in prayer and expectation Saints you don't have to call you don't have to say anything all you have to do is pray and God makes all things come around behind the scene before you know it it's you're walking into the vision that God had for ordained for us to walk into because our life is not here to just live in this world but now is to reflect the life Behind These doors where the life of Jesus Christ could be manifest to a lost soul to a soul that's maybe in need to somebody that might have might have needed a comfort maybe somebody that needs an encouragement and that's what the bride does she carries life and she imparts life because she has life and the life is in the word amen and so you know as as we were praying the the um the the group down in the southern area here in in in the southern part of of the area next to the Black Sea had had just reached out and said you know we would like for you to come down and and maybe just hold some Services we really we we just got into this building we've just dedicated it a few months ago and and we want we want to just hold some Services God is really doing something down in this area and and and it's just been a marvelous work so I took it before the Lord of course you know uh we want to walk into the perfect will of the Lord and so we took it before the Lord and sure enough the Lord just gave us the confirmation and so my dad my my father brother brother Leon he he fell the pull to to join and and just be there and you know it's it's um it's a privilege to be able to carry the gospel you know into your own country you know I believe that sometimes you know being able to hear the propit in our language in English being able to read being able to understand and hear the voice of the seventh angel the one that quickens our soul the one that we're able to understand and catch the revelation of the truth it's important amen it's important and so and so to be able to carry that home and share that home you know for me it it it it was it was it was a testimony and so you know as as we as we the Lord put on our heart to go around these dates um we we had a few services that were scheduled we had a Friday night that was scheduled in the in the belie with the Believers down in karash which was a uh an hour away from this area here where this church is in kavod and so you know my heart was always there to to just Express you know the love of God you know it's it's so hard to try to live around a lot of wolves it's very hard to live around a lot of wolves when there's just a few sheep and they're scattered and they're trying to survive they're trying to feed they're trying to stay alive they're trying they're trying to to walk into the revelation of the message but there's always wolves that are dressed like sheep that walk amongst them that try to deceive the very elected if it would be possible and so sometimes our heart you know you you you want to go and pray the gospel so you can encourage the Bride of Jesus Christ and and and just you know show show you know the the the effort you know brotherly kindness and the love of God just being able to express and so we had a Friday evening in in karash and we were there with the Believers there and then and then and then Saturday and Sunday we were we were in this area um but you know God has done tremendous things it's it's hard for our eyes and our our words to describe what God's doing but God is Sovereign and he calls them by name he calls them by name Why by name because their name has been written in the Lamb's Book of Life and truly that's their true identity truly the word that was written there it was the word that was written in the beginning about them and it takes it takes the word of God to be able to to to reflect and bring those bring those seeds to life and so we were there and we had a we had a wond we had wonderful services and so as soon as the rest of the Believers in Romania heard that we were there of course they wanted us to pass by they didn't want to let us go they you know Romanian feed you as until you die and then they Fellowship you until you die it's it's just the way Fellowship is is around food so you just eat and you eat and then you Fellowship until you're literally you're you're you're you're done and so you know it was it it was it was it was great we had we had a good we had a good time but you know really um every one of them every church that we've went through we were we were able to start down in the South and then we were and then we'll show some pictures here in just a little bit but I'm just going to want to express what God's doing and then I'll invite my my father brother Stefan to come and and just Express his heart too but you know it's so important to express our faith because you know when we express our heart it comes from Faith to Faith now your testimony could be of your testimony really is life your testimony really is life because now it's no longer a word that's remained on paper or a quote that's remained in the message but now it's made alive in you and because it's made alive in you it has a power of Resurrection when you testify about it and so it it was it was such a beautiful testimony as God was just dealing with us but we were we were able to share our heart and go to BL brother Myers in clou and and and and then we were able to visit some brothers in in the northern part of the country by Amada and and and we ended up going to a few other services near Arad where brother Gabriel was at but you know God is doing something and he's preparing his bride he's getting her ready because she has to be dressed in that righteous garment that she has to carry she's dressed with the word of God and and so um I wanted to read the scripture as we just kind of come to a close and I I just kind of ask my dad to come but I wanted to turn to John chapter 5 and just read these few scriptures and I'll read one more quote but before we read here I wanted to just let you know this every church that we've went through they send their love and greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they truly they truly love the Lord and they loveed the Lord because they showed us how much they love the Lord by their expression and and you can you can you can see when when there's a life that's been changed and affected by the message of the hour and how we could influence a Believer but I wanted I wanted to I wanted to read this these few verses here and and just pay attention let us speak to your heart because the word of God is personal person Al amen it uncovers your identity amen and and so listen to what John chapter 5 we'll just read 19-32 and then I'll read a quote then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise for the Father loveth the Son and showed him all things that himself doeth and he will show him Greater Works than these that ye may Marvel for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will for the father judgeth no man but had committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father he that honth not the son honth not the Father which had sent him verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me had everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life amen verily verily I say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they shall and they that hear shall live for as the father had life in himself so had he given to the son to have life in himself and had given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the Son of Man Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice and shall come forth they it says they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation I can of my own self do nothing as I he I judge and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will but the will of the Father which ha sent me if I bear witness of myself my witness is not true there is another that beareth Witness of me and I know that the witness which he beareth of me is true am amen the witness that he Bears about his bride about his elect is true because they are the true unadulterated word of God Amen they believe nothing but the word of God and so we've been so blessed we've been so blessed to be able to take this power of transformation this resurrection that now had taken place and share it and be able now to to share really what God has done through the message of the hour I I'll say this Saints you know we have to be honest with ourselves there's a lot of there's a lot of things that and there's a lot of there's a lot of Expressions maybe that may not be true or there's a lot of ways that has even entered into the message of the hour and so brother brandham says how can you tell the true from the false he says check word by word word by word it's word upon word precept upon precept and that's how you'll know them it's by the word because there'll be nothing but the word of God Amen and if it's if it's hybrid if it's if it's mixed without faith it won't have the power if it's mixed with anything else but the word of God it won't have the power but if it's mixed with faith if it's mixed with with with with the true genuine spirit of God the truth it produces life amen amen listen to what brother brandham says in the power of transformation 1965 it says the transforming power of God that's taken us from the chaos of Science and education and the things of the world and the understanding of this modern day 65 no October 31st power of transformation and the things of the world and the under it says and the understanding of this modern day it says has transformed us now into Sons and Daughters of God and even death itself can never hold us in the grave it says will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye it says oh you means to say I it says I mean to say that that's the truth Jesus that word stood on the earth which was it says which was the word and it says the the one that was raised up that raised up Lazarus he said I am the resurrection and life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live amen and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die it says no there's no way to stop the Living Word of God it's got to rise again Hallelujah there's no way to stop the Living Word of God it's got to rise again and from out of this chaos watch what brother Bram saying here I love this quote and out of this chaos of this modern scientific Eden that we're living in of culture and of Science and education and all this modern stuff it says will rise praise God this robe of Flesh will drop and it says and rise and seize the Everlasting rise someday we'll go through it says we'll go through the air and all of this will be over for the word of God that's brought us from the modern thinking of our mind Transforming Our mind into the renewing of our hearts towards God and our Spirits it says that same spirit that spoke that has transformed us this far and it'll also it says and also will take us into his presence into his glory with the glorified body he's quoting Isaiah here it says they shall build houses they shall inhabit them they shall plant Vineyards it says in our s in in all our scientific search we plant the garden our sons come along to take the fruit from it and his sons come and takes the fruit from him and they plant and another one eats and they build and another one inhabits but it says but long will be the days of my servants they'll be there and their offsprings with them they'll build and another will not inhabit though plant and another and not another eat thereof it says what the very God the very Prophet that the word of God said a virgin shall conceived promised us this amen how do we get it we are potentially there right now see because God said so it has to be when he raised Lazar at there he said don't think this is strange for the hour is coming when all that's in the grave will hear his voice The Voice of the son of man and shall come forth some to shame and some to life it says what is it transforming transforming by the word of God making us Sons and Daughters of God and will also give us life in the world to come oh my what more can I say listen not to other things amen that should be a comfort for the Bride of Jesus Christ making us Sons and Daughters of God by the revealed word of the hour restoring us right back to where we were in the beginning like we heard this morning what a what a wonderful word Saints this message is not just quotes and the scriptures are not just verses that we read what you eat is what you become what you eat is what you express what you eat is what your nature produces and that is life it produces Divine love it produces patience it produces kindness it produces gentleness it produces God in flesh am amen it was God above us we heard it brother B brother Billy mentioned it this morning it was God above us same God never changes just three different attributes God above us God With Us and now he's God in us by the spirit that he foreordained for us to have only to receive the truth that's part of the spirit and this life is a privilege this life is a privilege to be able to share with others that don't have because the message is a person and this person is the restored bride of Jesus Christ today amen and she produces life she produces the promise like Sarah did she didn't hurry she waited and she manifested the promise because she was patient and believed upon the word of God so we've been it's been such a blessing to be able to go home and share this share this gospel with the believing Saints there and you know this message is what unites the bride together not only in Bedford Texas but I'm going to say worldwide because she's from All Nations from all kindreds she she she she's part of him she she knows she knows her mate she knows her husband and and it produces the same love and and so um I'm going to invite my dad to maybe come and share a few words and then we'll just go through and express you know some of the pictures that we have on on a on a few on a few slides and and just so you can see the the Believers there but truly the privilege and the honor goes to the Lord amen he he has the preeminence he is the life he is the truth he is the way he's showing us the way he's showing us he's showing us the direction to go and so God bless you we've we've truly been blessed we we couldn't have done it without your prayers without your support with all of the things that you've done for us and just know that you know a prayer does more than anything you could ever ask for amen because the devil the devil always tries to come against the word of God he always tries to come and and and and push and and and deceive and and and try to push you away and take away your confidence and put fear within you and and always trying to discourage you but there is a word that was given that produces life that overcomes that and the Bible says that perfect love casteth out fear and when you have him you have perfect love amen we just want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we sure missed you we love you and and we it's just I'm so happy to say that we're back home uh I want to read a quote from a message um leadership in 1965 um December 7th and then the paragraph would be uh 141 she and the word says this just as Moses it's called a nation out of a Nation Christ today is calling a church out of a church you see the same thing in type taking them to the Glorious Eternal Eternal Promised Land amen amen amen is the it's the Bride of Jesus Christ which is which were the ones that were uh chosen that was that was predestinated before the foundation of the world and their names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life and within all this you also find Romanians amen amen amen it was it was really a privilege for me to go on this little tour in Romania um it was my first time actually just going back home into my own country and and having fellowship with the mess such churches it was it was very different but I would like to say this that Christ he has his chosen there few but they have the unadulterated word of God amen amen you as as as you know or maybe you should know the the word is very tested in Romania for us here in the states is may be very easy uh the the word the word Christian yeah Christian everybody everybody's Christians everybody everybody claims to be Christians here but in Romania when you're talking about a Christian especially when you get into the message is very is very blamed it's it it it has it has a reproach it pushes it to the to the side you have to be very strong you have to be you have to have the foundation of faith and in the word of God and all the ones that come and all the Believers that come from from all of these religions Pentecostals Baptist they blame this word and if you don't have the strength or the foundation of the word revealed it' be very easy for you to go fall away but the revealed word of the hour which creates a a a a foundation into a heart nothing can nothing can take you nothing can what I would like to say is that the Fai and the people that carry this message they're very tried and therefore it's very important that you know the encouragement of the word and and and the fellowship that it's it's very important for these for these Believers I I would like to maybe just share a few words of what the Lord had had dealt with my heart while we were in in kavod in this area of kavod which is down by the Black Sea it's a it's a new church that just formed just just as he was expressing that you know there's just it's a new building that that the Lord just rose up there it's also right now still under construction they're they're down to maybe just almost lay the floor down on the ground and even if they didn't have no floor even if they didn't have all the conditions that were perfect they insisted that we would go and that we would host services and have Fellowship because they desired they desired to have Fellowship around the word of God that was within them that they desired and and the fact that we were there and they heard about us there was a lot of visitors that came and the Lord really worked in in a supernatural wondrous way uh Saturday evening we had a a uh church service I would like for you to understand it's very hard for me to explain in a world that's educated that's that's God all that they have need of the southern part of the country in Romania so in in in that region of the country christianis you know the Believers and christianism in that area there is is really tough they they're they're they're not really open so so much to the word of God because of the culture and and all and the idolatry that really had taken place in that in that era in that area there there's there's a lot of uh Witchcraft and a bunch of you know uh things that that that are not and in that place the Lord has has a seat to be pulled out God and God God has to work there he wants to pull that seat out we had a situation in a family that they weren't Christians and the husband he was he was a drunk and you know he he you know he he was very violent and did a lot of things that you know the drunk do Saturday evening we actually prayed for this family and we brought it before the Lord in that service and we said Lord let this family be saved I said Lord you you you can do all these things because we believe this thing and even the parents of this of this individual of the son and they said that if the Lord would do something with this family they would see that it would be the hand of God and Saturday morning when we had our Saturday morning service and the wife of this husband that that struggling with drinking she came to church it was a miracle because the husband never allowed her or give her the the the freedom to come to church and for that whole Community was a a miracle that she was able to attend the service as as a matter of fact actually she brought want her baby to have it dedicated before the Lord this is the Lord this is God this is God and and God works whenever he wants her however he wants and through whoever he wants he he works in a very strange way but he works the same he always confirmed his word he always confirmed his word word and he always stood behind his word even brother Bram himself says when those 12 Spies were sent to Kad Bara okay to inspect all all the land it was 12 of them 10 of them was only able to see what their eyes were seeing but only two of them they were able to see the promise of God and they were able to bring fruits the the the evidence they were able to bring the evidence the evidence that was in the land they were able to bring back they were they brought the evidence that the land existed that God that the one that God had promised them this is God brought the evidence before they could get into the land so they rece the promise that they see this is God a lot of times we look at at the things on the materialistic side and the things that are around us God and the message the Bible and the message says to rise up at another and and to soar like in Heavenly places we are eagles we have to rise above all the problems we have to rise upon all these things that these people do because we're the Bride of Jesus [Music] Christ and I would like to just close with this God is even working today and he's calling out all the ones that are that are elected to come out so that way that number would be able to be fulfilled I would like to read one more quote out of the same out of the same service leadership paragraph 167 and when uh and when an A man was born again through the word of go through the word of God predestinated unto life eternal the uh it says and when a man has been born again by the word of God predestinated to eternal life called de elected it will be the word of God on top of word word on word not a denominational C Creed and then a word and a Creed it says it won't work you can't have the living in it only one eternal life Jesus Christ the word amen amen amen that's right amen amen amen amen word upon word precept upon precept line upon line he's he's all of that he's the same amen we're just going to go through a few slides here real fast if brother Daniel just wants to put those pictures up there and then we'll we'll close but this is this is the church let me see if I can look in here um this is the church that just you know recently got built they dedicated it in December and like my dad was saying they they still don't have floors in there as a matter of fact while we were down there we were able to make a small donation and purchase their floors and so they're able to now install them but truly they really want to serve the Lord with all of their heart if they don't have a minister come through to preach they put a tape and they're under expectation and they listen to the word of God but they won't they'll they'll they'll they'll gather around the word because that's what gathers them around so this is this is in kavod this is in that area where my dad was talking about earlier brother the Stan about the lady wanting to come in if we can go to the next slide maybe I can uh this was this was right in the beginning before the service started on Saturday evening they don't they don't have W some windows inside they were trying to do a a baby's room in in there in the back that still don't have Windows and stuff and the bathrooms to the left one of them's finished one of them's not but you know know there's a lot of people that are are are really looking forward to gathering together in this building so wooding stove yes sir it's a wood burning stove it's the way of heat they had to burn wood to to produce and you know that does that it doesn't keep up much um but but um it was it was good um next slide this was Sunday morning they um after the morning service they they made made sarmal they made cabbage rolls and they made 500 sound like your mom we ate us go with yeah so so it was it was such a blessing it was really such a blessing you know the love of God just expressed in their in their life this this was this is Brother Yan right there pointing with the finger he's he's kind of the song leader there he's just trying to gather the people and come to service and and just and just keep the fire moving they're they're really just trying to stay alive for the for the Lord this is another brother here in the next slide this is my dad with the brother EA his name is eeka um he's from the church in karash they came Sunday morning to Fellowship um the next picture is a picture where we're at brother Yan's house this is this is brother yonut he uh he I didn't put the picture on here but um I didn't want to scare y'all but they uh ended up uh uh sacrificing a hog while we were down there just to feed us and so this is the fresh this is the fresh kill and and so it was good it was fresh we were just enjoying we were just enjoying the meal there it was such a lovely group we really had a beautiful time um next slide this is brother marus from CL he sends his greeting to every one of you um wonderful brother brother Matthew's been there brother Andrew's been there this is brother Mario sincl oh I'm sorry never made it to the South oh okay this is CL this is CL Matt wonderful uh they miss Aral they miss oural again so we ate cabbage roll again it was really good um wonderful people the brother to the left he he um you know he's been in the message a long time and and really he was he was taken into the other route of you know being deceived by so many lines in the message but the Lord really brought him back and it was such a testimony to see him it was just such a testimony him and brother marus uh the next slide is the brothers at bamar they send you their greetings and love and um this was after the Wednesday evening service we we took a service there and then they cooked for us you can tell this reminds me of Brother David one time me and brother Matthew were in Romania and he says you guys look like zombies we were tired me and me and Dad probably didn't we we couldn't sleep at night it was really tough just changing beds but you know God's good you do this because you love the Lord and and it's something inside of us that just likes to share the life um there next next this is a u this is um brother Christie we were going to a church that I haven't never been to yet this was the first time we've went this is a church in a town called bulgaro um a sweet little group that was there and really um the may shock you but this is just the way that God works the pillar of fire was there it was visible people had seen it it was a it was it was in the it was in that service and actually there was a sister that um came in very sick than that service she came in sweating she she came to the altar she said I don't know what's wrong with me something's going around we prayed for her and then as we were walking out of the church service maybe 30 minutes later she came to us and she said I don't know what happened but I'm Healed she was no longer sweating she was no longer whatever was going on Amen there was a word and that word was that by his stripes we are healed and that word was manifested amen so this was we ate right before we went to service this was brother Chris's house and from here we had 20 minute service and then that was the that service the next slide this is Dad this is uh brother Leon just saying his test testimony in in Arad this was on I believe Sunday morning and then the next slide is um we were just eating more food um after the service and and and Pepsi and cola um but that's just the way that Romanians like to share their love is to feed you amen next slide there was it was this brother's birthday here so we said celebrated his birthday while we were down there we sang him happy birthday we had such a good time next slide it was this is a brother Gabriel's home and then this last slide here I wanted to just say the testimony for brother Ivon many many of you might have seen him in the pictures that we've showed you before but brother Ivon was um in November November 4th he had a brain stroke and um he was carried to the hospital and he was in the hospital with no chance of living He um there was a few brothers that was texting brother Matthew and myself about praying for um for him and and you know I I believe that the whole the whole um the whole country was praying for him to get well and people from here and from other countries and out I tell you what you know as they were sending us videos and pictures this was the first time that I was able to see him but the Lord brought him back he speaks he can hear his conscience about everything um he's been a testimony for this for this church amen and and we had we had a service there Sunday night after the Sunday morning service at brother Gabriel's but we had a Sunday Sunday evening service at at his at his church chur and the Lord was really there he really moved upon the scene and spoke to our hearts it was really a supernatural service it was it was such a blessed it was such a blessed Fellowship we had together the next slide here was at his home he he brought us he cooked for us and his wife and we we just had we just had a a blessed time but that's what the message does he he he was sitting in his hospital bed reading the Bible he did didn't care he didn't he didn't care if he didn't remember he didn't care if he couldn't understand he was just sitting there reading the Bible listening to the message and the doctor says ma'am he told his wife there's absolutely no hope I'm sorry this is as far as we as doctors can go it's in the hands of the Lord this is exactly the way the doctor put it and at that point the sister said is that's when I felt comfortable like she said she said when they said that I said that brought a comfort to my heart because I know that at that point God had that last word and now he's the testimony of the last word and so God bless you we truly appreciate you and and all that you've you've been for us God bless you in Jesus Christ's name that's wonderful amen you know there's a place where the prophet of God made a mention I I can't I just have to paraphrase it but he talked about the early church and what they did with what they had he said what should we be doing with what we have because we have so much more than they do I'd like to testify haven't been to uh Romania to eat how do you say cabbage rollal samala but I've had the best Samara in the whole wide world right here in Bedford Texas so uh you you know uh I just want to testify to that because that is absolutely the truth and uh uh my Romanian neighbors have tried to kill me four or five times by feeding me to death but uh we're grateful for that you know what inspired me so much was the brothers that were in the area uh that um brother uh Stephan shared with us and I hope you understood what he said here in America everybody's a Christian it don't mean nothing to say you're a Christian you a Christian everybody's a Christian Catholics are Christian Baptists are Christian methodists are Christians everybody and the cowboy games are Christians we're Christians right we're a Christian Nation you you know and uh Christians drink beer and Christians do this and Christians do that Christians smoke you know it it doesn't matter but he said there to be a Christian is a reproach yeah because they hold a standard that's not watered down like America so when you have those Believers there and they're making a stand they're bearing a great reproach and I want you to see how far that they've gone and I I appreciated our brother uh bringing that message leadership by the leadership of the Holy Spirit those people in a very difficult environment built that church and gathered themselves together and and God's moving and uh uh you know I look forward uh to the time because uh as soon as we put this behind us we'll be able to reach out and help uh the missionaries all around and we've got some tremendous Brothers here that are on fire for the Lord that have been taught right raised right they have a a love for this message and an understanding of how important it is to stay with it amen now a lot of people hear the message but they they haven't come to the revelation of what it means to have an absolute amen you know to have the final amen the place that answers all the questions and so it it's not so much of going out and telling people that God had sent a prophet they know that they've sent a prophet they they they they've seen the pillar of fire they've seen the cloud they know the it's open but they don't always realize everything that's within it and how complete if I could use the word I don't have a better word in my vocabulary but what a complete packag amen what a a a complete allinclusive gospel this message is and you know and uh Matthew has had some tremendous opportunities uh here recently I don't know if they call that a podcast Matthew Zoom uh uh Zoom that's I like that word uh when I grew up Zoom meant you know you zoomed here and you zoomed there now it means you look everybody but they've been able to reach out to ministers uh in India of denominational ministers in India Matthew's been a sharing the gospel in uh India and uh some o opportunities are coming up to possibly go to a A yuban or how do you say that yuban close enough for an Irishman all right and so uh say it loud bistan bistan so I I know I slaughtered it just like I Slaughter your names but I'm saying when you have the right spirit and you you God is seeking those to worship Him in spirit and in truth that's what God wants and God will provide the word so that they can worship in spirit and truth so we just want to always uh uh grateful for the Lord to uh that uh we can go out and share with our brothers and sisters and I it certainly seems like as hard as it is the spirit's moving there in Romania and the brothers are going to overcome amen it's given to the Overcomer isn't it so we're certainly grateful for that to see me I hope it puts your heart on fire if if you have a burden that help that little group there and and you want to uh pray about it and and and uh give a offering to them I'm sure if you give it to Cosman he'll make sure it gets down there to those brothers and and we'll see what we can do or if you want just um mark it out on on an envelope or on an offering and just put for church and Romania and then uh we'll we'll match whatever you give and we'll put it together and we'll send uh something from our church down there to help them so any we we love the Lord do you love the Lord amen okay do you feel like there's something in your heart that you want to share this message with somebody it's been freely given freely give have confidence it it the word stands on its own and if you speak the word god to stand behind it you know there's he he won't fail the word will not fail that's one thing you you ask and the scripture says we have not because we ask not and we ask not because we're not sure in other words we don't believe that he'll do it and we don't want to have a wait and see attitude we want to be proactive if I could use that terminology Pro active Believers uh we want to speak the word we want to believe the word God can do nothing for us until we confess it first amen so so let's do it let's keep those that are sick uh in our prayers those that are needy in our prayers let's pray one for another and uh once again uh like brother Matthew said uh before our services on Sunday morning uh we'll put the prayer requests up on the uh screen here I and I guess we can put them on the screen uh so this we'll have them the prayer request up there and then then they'll have quotes that to build your faith and then you can take those burdens on your heart so don't forget if there's a prayer request that you'd like to have uh you can email it and we'll get it up there on on Sunday uh for for you so so you can pray so if you have a prayer request and you let us know then we'll definitely post it on our pre-service you can come in uh um and uh you we don't really have room for you to come to the altar now but you can come in and and sit look up and take a prayer request on your heart maybe read a scripture build your faith and pray for that that a person and like the brother told me he says we learn to know that God was real by the answered prayers in our home that's right and that's something that I thought was a wonderful wonderful explanation of how to raise a family amen we knew that God was real by the answered prayers in our home amen I hope that becomes Our Testimony that we know God is with this congregation by the answered prayers that he's given us amen God bless you tonight let's stand together if if you have an unspoken request and you'd like to lift your hand up to the Lord and we remember these brothers in Romania in prayer and if maybe you have something lying ahead of you this week that you would like to Lord to intervene I know we have some uh Believers that are looking for work uh we have uh uh uh financial needs uh within the framework of the church we have health needs uh within the framework of the church we have family needs within the fr framework of the church and so if you have just something on your heart that you'd like to bring forth before the Lord as we pray you just lift your hand to the Lord say Lord remember me Father remember this request I'm praying for uh uh this uh situation I'm praying for this particular person Lord I'm just asking that you would do uh exceedingly and abundantly above what we could even ask or think so let us bow our heads our gracious Heavenly Father we heard a wonderful testimony this evening of how that light and life follows your word and father how Believers are are thrilled when The Fellowship of The Gospel comes into their presence and that they can see that there's Believers that there's men and women that love the word of God lord and I know that in this age that we live in we believe that you brought forth a scriptural promise in our [Music] day and I know the world thinks it's foolish that we've heard a messenger from God lord and I know they label us a cult and they accuse us of following a man and but father you've opened our eyes to the scriptures Lord and we see beyond a shadow of the doubt it's the actual letters written on the pages that have come to life and manifested in flesh amen Lord we see the fruits of it we see the love that It produced and generate father we see the power of the promises of God coming to pass Lord and we know it's real amen and Lord because it's so proven and Vindicated Lord we gladly bear the reproach and you said in your scriptures if we're ashamed before man you'll be ashamed of us before the [Music] father but Lord if we confess you before man you'll confess us before the father Lord I'd like to testify that I'm not ashamed of this gospel I'm not ashamed of the Gospel you brought through the prophet messenger William brandom I'm not ashamed of it Lord because it's life and it's the power of God for salvation from this evil Wicked age that we live in Lord and I pray that we can always keep a Meek and humble spirit that Lord we won't be judgmental of those that you haven't opened their eyes as of yet but with love father we can encourage them along the wayen father that our lives would be salty amen that they might inquire of us what is this hope that you have of a resurrection thank you Lord Jesus and father that they would thirst for what that we have yes Lord and we want to see you in our lives and we want others to see you amen yes Lord Lord we want to Proclaim your name amen and as you bless our brothers I thought as by Brother Leon they said it's my first time to go back as a Believer hallelujah amen and to testifying to be with the Believers amen oh God bless his soul lord He blesses my heart that's why I love to hear him preach Lord so this week May [Music] we take control of the atmosphere L Lord might we go forth with a smile on our face with the love of God shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit may we stand up
