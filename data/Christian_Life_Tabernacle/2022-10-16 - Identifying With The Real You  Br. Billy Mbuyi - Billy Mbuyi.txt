Identifying With The Real You 
Br. Billy Mbuyi
October 16, 2022
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

it's nice to have my good friends Bill and Marcy with us today from Arizona brother bill came out of San Diego with me I don't know eons go so we were just happy to have him our offering this morning and also again our our condolences go out to brother Cosman at the loss of his a grandmother and brother Stefan the loss of his mother and their traveling we definitely want to keep them we took we took just about nine thousand dollars in offering this morning for the family um which I just appreciate the generosity poured out from your hearts many of you have asked if there's a way that you can uh give by credit card and we do have a some form of application online we have an app online I think if you go online there's a way to give your offering by credit card and we will take that and turn that into cash to give it to them so um I'm not very familiar with the app but you could talk to one of the trustees or deacons and they'll do your best I'm getting it here on my board technology oh there it is on your board too so there's a place you can go to online in this Christian Life Tabernacle and it'll have it a place where you can give offering just Market benevolence or or whatever and we'll know that what it's for amen amen Lord bless you do you love the Lord I think what's so marvelous is if we could ever grasp the love that he has for us everything that he does for us is because he loves us and it's always for our good and and when we go through difficult times he will guide us he'll Comfort us he'll be there he'll Supply our every need he certainly are all in all so we're so very thankful I'm uh I'm going to go immediately after service brother Adrian Martinez and I are heading down the family has arrived and they've asked us to come down this evening and pray for them as a family of course you know insurance companies are trying to get over there and have her sign papers and and they don't know what to do but we just trust they're under the care of the great Shepherd and that guilt whatever is said and done when it's finally said and done that they'll be taken care of so do you love them amen let's go back and sing that chorus one more time as we invite brother Billy to come and break the words of life amen oh thank you for the cross [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] like free [Music] when you bring things [Music] foreign [Music] of our heads once again our gracious father Lord so thankful to be gathered in your presence Lord father we want to just remember once again the family of Brother David father we just pray that you comfort them oh God no doubt this is a difficult time Lord but we know though you have everything under your control law that you may just watch over them and provide for the needs of the family Lord father God will gather here to hear your word Lord we're realizing this Natural Body Lord that this body will perish Father Paul said that if we only have hope in this world it says we are the most deceived or the most miserable people that we are on the face of the Earth but he says but if this body be dissolved we have another one already waiting we are so thankful that we don't live this life for this life but father you have another life waiting for us Lord that we may live for you Lord we ask father that you speak to our hearts even tonight father we're so thankful for what you spoke to us this morning but we gather again to hear from your throne therefore we ask that you just give us the words that would comfort our hearts and father words that will just give us strength to go out of hear father better people than what we came in we love you and commit everything into your hands and ask those things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you just let's open our scripture we're certainly happy to be gathered once again in the house of God let's read and uh open our Bibles in second Corinthians chapter five we'll start from the 17th verse it says therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things will pass away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who had reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and has given unto us the ministry of reconciliation to it that God was in Christ reconciling the will to himself not imputing the trespass unto them and had committed unto us the word of reconciliation it says now then we are ambassadors of Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ that be ye be reconciled to God for he had made him to be sin for us who known who know no sin that we might be made to righteousness of God in him I mean I saw the scripture we read last time Philippians chapter 2 verse we're going to start from 5 verse 5 to 11. it says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ whom being in the form of God taught it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon himself the form of a servant and was made in likeness of man and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of of the Cross wherefore God also had highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in the earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father father we ask you once again that you bless your word to us we ask it in Jesus name amen let me have your seats tonight certainly enjoy the word tonight this morning and uh certainly uh perhaps I believe you will be on the same lines of what was spoken this morning I just want to uh what was the things that are quick in my heart amen um I want to I know I was I spoke on identifying with the word last time I want to title this identifying with the real you and it's as identifying with the real you we as we said last time we we live in a time of identification and the time where identification is very important and we said it you couldn't do anything legal at least um whether it be driving going to the banks or or anything without proper identification you you everywhere you go you need to have a proper identification to be identified and says this is the age of identification he called it and and I want to say this just to kind of take the uh directions that I would like to go this tonight that identification is a process that requires something to match um you would think if we speak of identification perhaps me presenting some documents to you or giving you some piece of information in order for that to be identified to be true there has to somewhere that you can validate that if I say my name was Billy you would want to and I said I was born in Africa in Congo and I would give you information and for you to validate that that's what I am you would need some form of identification you'll need to see my birth certificate my driver license or something you need some uh if I would call it some uh um government document or some Source uh uh that could validate that you need something almost like an absolute that you wouldn't doubt you would go when they ask you for identification you can't take a piece of paper write your name and give and say this is my identification no they need they will ask you for a government issue ID because they trust the government and they know in order for you to get this it will have to be validated for you to be to have it in your hands it will have to be you so therefore we have to realize we cannot be Christians according to our own thinking we cannot be Christians according to our own minds or our own understanding or our own definition of what Christian is our Christian why we call ourselves when we call ourselves a Christian there has to be some defining uh identification that shows that you're a Christian we have to have an absolute and we know the absolute that we have received is the word of God we cannot be Christians according to our own understanding that's why we have churches all around the corner you go this way there's one you go that way there's another one what is it it's man's explanation of what a Christian should be and they have them uh according but when I'm saying some have a code of conduct on what it should Christians should do and what they ought to be and all of those things and they take those and if you fill up all those requirements therefore you are considered Christians men go into the Bible they they take their own understanding of the Bible and they come forth and they say this is what a Christian should be and I want to say this there's always two forms perhaps there are more but this is just uh if you allow me to kind of just go forward with whatever was on my heart there's two ways to be identified one of them is the identification that comes by the way of Conformity which is one who went goes and and he reads what a Christian should be in the Bible and they try to practice it by the best they can and try to follow what those things are but there's also another identification that comes by the transformation which means we have gathered here we receive the word of God and the word that we have received does the transformation inside of you to produce what God is looking for so we don't want to be a Christian that's just one that conforms and and wonder will just hear and say well I cannot be that how can I be that but what the prophet is telling us it's important that we are those people that are being transformed by the word of God by the power of God and by the spirit of God the purpose why we come to church is to hear the word of God but that's not the end of it you have to allow the spirit that spoke the word to come upon you and bring that word to come to pass oh I'll tell you this there's many of us that's been here you can testify how many times you've tried to be a Christian by yourself you hear God saying that you can't drink you can't smoke and you try to practice it and your practice will only get you as far you're doing when you're doing by Your Own Strength will only take you as far but when you get transformed by the word that you have received you will never thirst anymore like Jesus told the woman at the well and that's why we desire When We Gather here we don't want to be uh clones of one another we don't want to be those that will just hear and say well I'm gonna go try to practice but we want to be those that have gone through the power of transformation of the word that we have received so therefore we we we we know we can even I can say as we sit here we have been identified as a specific group of people in the end time we have not called to just say we have received the message we may not call to just say well I like the message or I Hear What I Hear or I like this I like that no we have been identified to play a specific role according to the word of the hour we have need not been called to be part of the Baptist or the Pentecost so the the Presbyterian and all we have been called to be a member of the bride and in order for us to fit that qualification we have to receive the word that brings those quality out of us yeah oftentimes people will go in the Bible and we'll go we'll read it says well you know the bride will be there said and everybody wants to say well I'm this I'm this but you have to allow that word that spoke that you have to allow the God who put the promise he himself to come and vindicate and bring the promise to you why is it important because it because as we sit here you cannot go away you don't know where you're going if if you don't if you don't know where you're going then everywhere is your destination but you have to know what is it that I'm looking for what is my direction what is it that has been shown to me what is it that has been revealed to me and I want to say this it's not by understanding it's by Revelation because I say this Revelation comes off in time there is lack of understanding in our part we look at it we know the prophet said it we don't understand it but we believe what the prophet said God is the one who brings the understanding God is the one who brings the light he's the one who makes the path what what if what we've been called to do is to walk upon the footsteps that has been laid before us with confidence knowing that the God who gave the word the God the same God will bring light in our path so we can understand where we're going otherwise we just have our own interpretation that we're walking by and and brother Branham speaks about this and as we speak about this identification he helps us so we know in what direction we were going he he speaks about um I'll just read it for the sake of understanding I just I was going to say it but I thought reading it will just give it a richer meaning he speaks about that the Chinese laundrymen how they would come to this country they didn't know how to read they didn't know how to write and he says oftentimes they'll take a piece of paper and tear it in too and then he says this whole Chinese laundroman he will used to come here in Arizona and California if you can project it is the uh uh the identified Masterpiece preaching December 5th 1964. he says this old Chinese Laundry man he used to come here to Arizona in California years ago he says they couldn't write one word of English he hardly knew it he says you will take your laundry to him you know what he will do he had a little piece of paper he says nothing wrote on it at all he said he would just tear it into uh the piece of paper and give you one piece it says when you come back that piece of paper had too much his piece of paper it says and he didn't get or you didn't get your laundry I said that's a whole lot better it says you can't you you could copy a name but you can't you you ain't gonna fool him there because that piece of paper has to match exactly with his piece of paper he says that's the way God made his Covenant too I want you to listen our experience is not to match some Creed some Dogma some church denomination it's to match the God's word so when we gather here the only piece of paper that we are interested in matching is God's word the only piece of paper or the only thing that we're interested in matching in what was what was in the beginning what was spoken about us the only thing we're interested in matching is what is it that I'm here to do and why am I placed here on Earth is to match what was spoken about me so I can match it he says you so they can match the word of God Jesus Christ right when you come to Christ then then Christ claims us he tore him into two at Calvary part of him he lifted up it says and he sits on the right hand which was his body the Spirit came sent back here to make the bride for him to make the bride for him so the bride is not made out of some other material some other understanding some other things the bride is made out of the same material as the bridegroom the bride is the copy or exactly made out of it's the same as Eve was made out of Adam so is the bright Indian time and now he says he says it says and um it says and that same experience that was in Christ has to be in US that same experience that was in Christ has to be in us and I want to say this when when Elijah was given the mantle of of Elisha when Elijah Elisha was given the mental Elisha he was told to drink it and to dress it exactly the way it was but when I'm speaking extensively on that he said he didn't it wasn't given so he can go and cut it upon according to his own specification which is what uh uh we find out happens most of the time people will take the word and and they will cut this off and they'll cut that offer or they will take only the peace that sounds to to be good for their men and they will take so they can justify their position and that one and this one but the word is calling us to a place where we take the whole word of God like we heard it this morning to believe the whole word of God and to know what is it where is he taking me because it's important as Believers we know where we're going how are we going to get there and what God has provided to get us there so he says he was he was absolutely he was absolutely so perfect till he pleased the sculpture and and inspired him so much until he smorted at Calvary he says oh my now we see him in the script as we see him as the scripture says God's Masterpiece we see him smitten stricken Afflicted of God there's a real Masterpiece as Angelo as Angelo Struck it that's that's what made it so here he is and now we it's bringing us to an understanding he has to match something he's bringing us into the understanding we are here to match something we are not here to make ourselves what we want to be we are here to match what God has spoken us to be in the same time now I as our pastor was preaching this morning I thought this uh if I could just for a moment this really uh spoke to my heart and I could just bring it uh to an understanding it's important and if we can just understand this for this moment it's important that we we know that we are anchored into the word of God yes we are it's important that that that we are helped to know our anchor is the word of God and and this is important even for young Christians because there's days where you walk up where you feel like you are an unbeliever there's days where you walk up you don't feel like this Mighty Christian that just went through a great meeting and that's on top of the mountain about to conquer the world there are days where you walk up you feel like the ranked sinner you feel like you're the worst person on the face of the Earth and that should not be your determination of what you are whether you are a Christian or not a Christian your determination has to be what God has promised what God has said a Christian should be and what you know he said in his word so as long as the word says you are a Christian then you have to believe that it's important as we come we say it's not because I shouted that's what makes me a Christian it's not because I I I would say oh I was quiet that's what makes me a Christian so it's not the sounding of being quiet it's not the screaming it's not yes it's not because of some external emotion you are a Christian because the word says you are a Christian and we want to be anchored into that I've said this before the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing oftentimes we get distracted in what the main thing is oh I shout it that means I got it no you didn't get it when you shouted make sure behind that shout there's a word that you are sending on and I want to say this it's also equally important that when these things are spoken we come into an understanding that God is in our midst and we are here we are born of the spirit of God we are born by the word of God and we are gathered here if God has done something for you if God has ever saved you if you know where he's gotten you from that is going to make you shout and praise him we don't want to be you know this uh of sour face Christians and the song leader comes here and there's afraid to look at your face because he doesn't want to offend you he's looking at the ceiling or you come and you feel like you don't want to worship God and your hands are like this no we want to be a people that are Gather in the presence of God we know how to praise him because let me tell you there's not a people on the face of the Earth that have been given the way to worship God like you have it's a position that nobody else has therefore when we come into the Assembly of God we have the right to worship him we have the right to praise him we have the right to show our affection for what he's done for us we don't want to hide it or come and say well if I shout don't tell me well I'm not I'm just a shark no that's not what we're saying this morning what was said is this morning was when you shout make sure you got it make sure your shout is to do that God and if you're in the midst where people are shouting if you feel it's not God don't do it do what God places in your heart to do if it's not God don't do it but if it's God who lift up your hands and worship him I'll tell you this let me say this for what is done for me I don't care where I am I don't care who's around me my heart wants to show my appreciation for him we can come and just be our formal and the songs are being sang and you're looking in the ceiling and not sure what you're thinking about perhaps your food at home when you when church is over or where you're going to go and what you're going to do right after the songs are finished and the service is over we can't be that way we have to be people that are in cage when I come I want to be a participant I don't want to be just a watcher I want to be one that comes in the middle and I want to show that this God has been good to me I want to show everybody to know this is a good god it's like testifying to somebody and you all beaten up you know God is good and I want you to believe anything I won't believe in that kind of God who's gonna be attracted to that kind of God but we are here have gathered as a living people of a living God what about them says one place he says we are the image of the Living God here representing him on Earth therefore we have the Liberty to know that I have been saved I'm not ashamed to say it but he has to be in the right identification so so we are here in the spiritual I'll say we are living in the time of identification what was in the beginning what was in God's mind at the beginning for this age is being manifested the spirit of God is here calling the elect out of the church out from the the um it says come out from among them and it's crying out it's the cry for the last hour and God is calling out his people for his namesake as the iniquity is filling up as the iniquity of the world is filling up God is here to call in elect for his name's sake now he says here in the message things that are to be oh I love this message I always feel like everything leads to things that are to be because what's it what's what's here now is what was promised was going to be and what we're going to meet in the presence is things that I promise to be there's nothing new Under The Sun It's God to begin with it's God in the middle it's God at the end the scripture says that God who was above us The God Who came and dwelled with us with Jesus that same God is manifesting himself in the end time according to his promise what was the promise of his manifestation in the end time he will manifest himself in his people Hallelujah it says this old listen to this he says this old Earth every preached in December 5th 1965 paragraph 106. it says this Earthly Tabernacle here you know what is it this body is like an old court that you wear it says a court that you once wear but now you have you have one so much better you don't use this anymore what do you do you hang it on the closet for you've got a better one you've got a better Court he says it's more it's more it says it's more up to that it's more up-to-date than the one you used to wear it says that's worn out what it says it says in this garment you are you are the inside of that there you are the inside of that dare it says that garment only done what he bore the image he bought the image it says but you don't need it anymore you are hung it up it's a rack now let me just stop here before I go because this is very important is warning as as he's identifying you is wanting you to know that you are not this court yes he's telling you you are not this court this body is not you in fact at one place he says we never met one another the real you is what's inside of you and the reason why that's important is because as I'm standing here we make a lot of mistakes and we make a lot of we do a lot of things and the the process of fixing it or understanding it is for you to understand that you have a flesh that's always going to fight you it's for you to understand that you are not the flesh you are what's inside of that flesh you know I would do something wrong and I will really go perhaps I'll sit down with myself I'll ask Billy is this really what you wanted to do is this really what you desire to have as an outcome the real me will say no I didn't mean to do that now I know I'm sounding crazy but that's the word of God the real you say that's really not the intention when I said it I didn't really mean to do that I didn't really mean to say that's important because now you understand the difference because when we want to get at the end it's for the real you to grow up and to conquer this flesh so he can bring this flesh to where it's obeying the word of God there you go but if you consider your flesh as you then you have a problem you have an endless problem that's going to fight you day in and day out but if you understand the real you is the predestinated you then you can say I have this court that's troubling me every day I'm gonna go in the spirit of God is going to anoint me so that I can overcome it when someone has an addiction at least from what I understand the first thing is he has to separate himself from his addiction he has to understand this is the addiction but this is not me this is something that's afflicting me if you just say well I'm addicted you're going to remain that for the rest of the life isn't verse says that he speaks he says when the spirit comes he will anoint your body and he says when the inspiration comes down it says the inspiration will come and it will cause your body to obey your confession but if your confession is that's what you are then it can't work what he wants us to do is to understand what the real you is and then he says here let me continue it says that's the way this body is he says you it's more the image of the Heavenly and then it says it's not you you are you are you are on the inside of that body you the spirit of God is on the inside of that body you the spirit of God is inside of that body if you were made in the image of God if you were made in the likeness of God you are the spirit of God that resides inside of that party why you need is to get a charge from Heaven what you need is to get a charge from the word for you to recognize your possession and take the flesh under the Dominion of of the spirit he says that what makes the outside comes into subject because the inside is pulling it it says see bringing it in line with the word of God your inside you yourself your being and I know our pastor has preached on this many many years ago I believe many many years ago speaking about uh understanding of the real you and I think it's something that we need to constantly be reminded of not this flesh I I'm battling this flesh every day I woke up this morning today because I came from some meaning you tell me I'm the best Christian there is the next day I walk up and he tells me I'm the worst Christian that is my latest mistake is my always my is always the thing that's going to bring me down and that's what makes happening let me say this Jesus said I came for the Lost ship of Israel in other words the Lord's sheep was your qualification to receiving the Redemption that he had to give the fact that you are a lost sheep made you a candidate for you to receive the blood the fact that you were lost made you a candidate for you to be saved so he can't turn around and say that you are not saved while at the same time calling you a sinner so the story is going to be straight in other words if you are a sinner it's God who made you perfect if there's anything good in you it's God who did it because we know within us as human there's nothing good it says this body is just an old court and someday what will you do with it he says you he says he was only in the Garment for a while this is like the Earthly garment this body your body he says your real self is on the inside of this old Court that he says that is called William Brennan or Susie Jones or whatever whatever it is see someday it will hang in the earth in a in a hole of the memory of you of memory of you you will put on it you will put it on Yonder in the grave and somebody will put it in the Tomb in the tombstone up he says here lies reference so and so and John so and so and so and so it says it lies right there as a memorial of you people just seen you in this whatever you was it says you're you're real you was on the inside of that but the court itself just bought the image of the heavenly Paul said as we bow the image of the Earthly so shall we bear the image of the heavenly and I say God is here in the mystery of the contrast it's important we understand that this flesh was given for us for us to express what God is the real you is to express itself in some ways and we know the manifestation has to come so the flesh was given for us to manifest the real you that's inside of you the flesh was given in other words you stand here you have a desire to please God you have a desire but that that manifestation has to be shown somehow and this flesh was given for that so we can manifest but does I of a true Christian is for us to come tonight is for us to kill the life that's in the flesh and have the light of the life of the spirit in US of the spirit of God come and be manifested for one of them speaks about the it speaks about the badge of skin how it would be taken and every life out of it will be beaten it says it will be beaten until there was no more life in it and then it would be taken so it can come and be covered for the holy of holies in other words what we desire is to kill this person this human this life that's in it that their own thinking their own way of doing what is what he wants to do where he wants to go to kill it so we can bring it in the image of God it says all people have you he says if you made your reservation to change quotes have you made your reservation for heaven remember you must have a reservation you can't get there without him I'm talking to you in a modern language now it says and you know if you if you've got that hotel it says and you know you know well you know what I'm saying so yeah we are and it's speaking it's important that we understand if we if this is not the real me if this is body is not the real me then I need to identify with the real me so I can bring it into manifestation and the real me is what he said a moment ago when we really said about the Chinese Laundry is what God had in his mind trying to protect it through the flesh is what God had in the beginning him trying to bring it in projection so he can come and be manifested in reality the true basis of identification is not based on what of people uh uh lying down uh rules that oh this is what you need to be if you only meet this requirement then it's you if you only do this that's you no but the real base of or desire to bring is the desire to bring an understanding of what you are or how where you come from and what you are placed here to do when we say I need I I want to be identified I want to come to their understanding of what I am is not to come into some understanding of some restriction there you go this is what you got to do if you feed this model then that's what that's what makes you what you are if you do this all then that's what makes you what you are that kind of understanding will always bring confusion because you will always need an update on what you need to do next like the Rich Young Ruler he says I've done all of this what do I need to do next I've done all of this what do I need to do next but when you come into the understanding of what God wanted to do and why he placed you here which is what we heard this morning it brings Clarity for you to know the purpose for your life for you to understand that I don't need someone to tell me or what I should or should not be doing I need to be inspired by the word of God moved by the word of God in order for me to get into action otherwise you lose it otherwise you you you you lose the understanding of what identification they want you to be the true identification is is clearly built upon the understanding that God is the one who's leading you he's the one who chose you he's the one who elected you is the one who placed you here and he's the one doing the leading the church is meant to be led by the spirit of God yes the churches the people that are inspired by the word of God that are moving and and fulfilling the word of God what has happened is many intellectuals have taken this message and they've brought forth their own understanding yeah yeah oh this is what this means and everybody follows oh this is what this means and then we have it every time we read that scripture we got to think about what that person said about the understanding that's not the way God leads his people he leads his people his children by his Spirit he reveals it to you it doesn't matter if you're the only one that sees it that way if everybody else is in a different way it doesn't matter as long as God who shows you you go forward with it and we want to build an environment where people are comfortable knowing what is it that God is showing me because often time it's the swap of intellect I take my inner life I give it to you you take yours you hand it back to me it's not what we desire we want God to move in our midst we want God to speak to us we want his word to be manifested in our midst now you know there are many that comes here that are not born again we need them to get into an atmosphere that we can create that the new birth can come upon them we don't want to take them and oh oh you are you you are you are a Believer do you believe what I just said okay that means well no that's not we want him to come in contact with God because when he meets the challenge you want him something within him not you you want him to be able to answer to the request it's important we be led by the spirit of God we come in contact with this God and say I'm here because you don't know what I have to go through you know oftentimes and I I want it down as you know people they they you have the denomination world or even you see it in the message you don't know what I had to do for this message you don't know what I had to give up you don't know hey you know this or that that's wonderful but it's for you it's not for me when the prophet himself says a Believer he says it's the Holy Spirit that's hunting for you I believe it's Easter seal or the rising of the Easter seal or uh one of those messages it says the believer it's the Holy Spirit the hunting for you making you uncomfortable looking and whatever life you were living in you were happy at it and then now you're no longer happy he's constantly he brings you right into the altar but when I'm says doesn't it fit he says now you look back everything fed you were somewhere somebody told you something that sounded strange you came into a service the preacher said something that didn't make any sense oh God is in the business of taking what doesn't make sense and make it sense to you don't be afraid of what doesn't make sense let him take that what doesn't make sense he will bring your answer to your heart it says here you well he says you sell you may have said I'm just not the right kind of Christian he says how can you come to God without God calling you first it says all that E4 news then he called is that right and all that he called he justified is that right all that he justified he had also called or already he had already past tense glorified him and he says it's a finished work from the foundation of the world we're not going to add anything to the program we're not going to add one thing to the program the program is already set is asking us to just follow it the program is already set is asking us to just glide on it the program is already said he just wants us to participate in it to know that this is the program it's not great Miracles here great Miracles here no it's the word what is the word saying oh I tell you my brother my sister he he says one place he says you you said well I shouted he says well you know everybody you can go to the ball game people are shouting you said I spoke in tongue he said well I'll tell you this I went to the muhammadan and all of them the Buddhist it says all of them they did the same thing if that's your base of measuring you obviously have done the wrong direction but if you would say well I did it because the word says it to do it if you would worship Him you say because the word says enter into his temple with Thanksgiving if you worship him because the scripture says lift up your hands and worship him if you would do it because the word says to do it then you would rip the benefit of what the word says right so he says it's all right he says God how can how can you come to God without him calling you first and already know the full call he also called is that right it says uh it's a Finnish work from the foundation of the world now he says to whom would we go it says as some kind something knocked on your heart you Rose up and you stood on your feet and you walked down the aisle and it says and something draw you and not it says now let me give you the scripture he says all that is for new then he also called he says that was God calling you now did you think that was God calling you absolutely not in fact you thought it was the strangers I remember just being a young man I went and uh the way I came into the message I was at my living with my older brother who was in the message and he took me to church and I went with him and I was there I would listen and you know people would be rejoicing and listening I would just sit there stealing everything and then after I left I went to another church um and and the the preacher will come up and preach and I'll sit there and I'm just like this sound a little bit different you know I was like you know it doesn't really sound like over there you know it's now if you gave me the Bible and said show me what you were talking about I didn't know I didn't know all I knew is something within me was not identifying with where I was in fact so much so that one day the preacher called me up he says can you remain behind after service and so he called me and he you know he's talking to me and says you know I see see your life you know it seems like something is you know special with your life and all I'm thinking is he wants me to stay here foreign all I'm thinking is he wants me to stay here and I'm going to run it right after this conversation it's the last time he's gonna see my face yes God talking to you calling you that's why the prophet said it only takes it's only after years it's only when you look back you begin to understand it's only after you look back you begin oh no wonder that person said this no wonder this happened here no wonder that person called me there's no one of this it's only after a time that all of those things begin to make sense what is it it was God calling God's calling on Supernatural God's calling and not human calling God's calling he comes and he does the calling not just the call he provides a place for you to worship him he works in both ends he plays a desire for you to be a Christian he sends a message that will hear and then within you when you hear that message you you want the message to become a part of your life what is it it's doing it on both sides he provides the calling and he answers the call and it's not change it he hasn't changed it today he's done the same thing and that's what the messenger is telling us it says let this mind be in you that was also in Christ and Prophet said he that he always believed the word I love it when he woke up in the morning he wanted to know what the word wanted him to do that day what is it that my father wants me to do in this day he wanted to know what is it that was written about him so he may walk in it and fulfill it at the age of 12 13 it was found in the temple with the with the with the high priest debating on the scripture he wasn't pointing the scripture about somebody else he was showing them exactly what the word said about him he was telling me well the scripture says he was to be born in Bethlehem look at here is that true he said yeah it says okay the scripture says a virgin shall conceive they said yes it says isn't a hint he said I'm he that's talking to you I think oftentimes we we stay in our right mind for too much I want us to get into the mind of Christ what is the mind of Christ is what the word says is what I will believe what the word says is what I want oh I love that we were listening the other day and I believe it's a perfect phrase where verbena made that statement he says a Believer it's the faith of God that moves in them that scripture that they just captivated my heart it's the faith of God that moves in them and I thought about how the prophet will say God is word when he spoke his word his word had his faith attached to it when he said let her be he said God believed his own word when he spoke it he spoke it he believed it and he came to pass you think when he spoke about you he didn't believe that he was going to come to pass you think when he spoke about you he had to come somehow and make it happen or think oh how am I going to bring this to pass the same faith that spoke the world into existence the same Faith spoke you into existence and that's not the end of it the end of it is whatever is moving within you it's his faith that's right Amen to bring his word to come to pass he did nothing except what the father showed him when he woke up in the morning he looked for the mind of God for that day what would you have me to do remember he said exactly what he did with Christ so is the bride we want this identification from the real you to come forth yeah I don't know about you but I'm tired of my own flesh I'm tired of my own thinking I'm tired of my own approach I'm tired of my own understanding of the scripture I want God to move in me and bring his word to come to pass I want when I woke up in the morning to be led by the spirit to do what I'm doing I don't want to just do it as a routine well this is what I do every day and everything I'll do that but until he moves in me I will take his word until he moves in me and causes me to do what he wants me to do the prophet says in the message identified with Christ it says how do you become identified with him say he said I'll say brother Branham now get to get he says you have to dress up like a Hollywood star or do some other things he says but how do you identify with Jesus Christ he says first you'll repent of what you already have done and then you identify yourself here in the pool it says no doubt but many but what many will be identified with him in a few minutes in the pool and identify with him in the baptism for for if we are buried in Christ we are identify in his death burial and Resurrection let me say this that formula has never changed you can't say I believe the message therefore I don't have to repent I believe the message therefore I don't have to be baptized I believe the message therefore I don't have to go through the stages I don't have to no you still have to be born again and that's the main problem we run into is we have had this word and many have taken it intellectually we speak about it we talk about it but yet we have never met a living God I'll tell you this I would rather meet the Living God and stand here and speak I know I want to meet the Living God who wrote the word and have his word become a reality to me more than anything men can offer because meeting the Living God will give you the revelation of what he said but if you take the word by yourself you're going to try to figure out this and figure out that and this doesn't match and and this all of that but when you meet him he's the author of The Bible if you don't understand it you lay it aside he will come and give you the revelation of it and that's what we desire we want him to give us the revelation of what he has spoken he said you identify in the poll and his resurrection it says that's the way you are baptized you go down into the water come back come back up to witness what we believe in death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ and if we if we be planted in his likeness in the in his death God gave us a promise that will be like him in the resurrection let me say this in all sincerity there's nothing that means more to us than the resurrection and that is his life living in us take everything take the seals take all of that give me Christ let me take the resurrection because the resurrection is a promise that when I go down I'll come back up let's not just become intellectual let's become Living Word of Christ walking on this Earth you become the gospel that's walking someone can look at you and say this is God I have seen God people looked at Birth and says we have seen God Walk In Our Generation oh I tell you if just a little bit that we know of this message if we can really take it with the hopeful revelation of what we know it's got to make us different people we don't need oh I need more and more just what we have just what we have received what we know what he has spoken is enough to change us I said and if the Life of Christ lives in the person they become identified with him this isn't a message of token it's Christ in you not the church member not a system but a resurrected power it's the Holy Ghost it's the token in you that your life says Amen to every scripture to the promise as is written in there it says and you are not of yourself no more you are Christ he says you don't think your own thought you don't think your own thoughts you say I think no more thoughts coming the life that was in Christ is in you the mind that was in Christ is in you the works that was that was in Christ is in you and Christ himself is in you you are already you are dead your life is hid in God through Christ sealed in there by the Holy Ghost you are not your own that's what a Christian is that's what we are called to be that's what we are we are dead to ourselves through our own thinking our own thoughts all we live is whatever pleases the Lord is what I will do like David and his servants he stood there and one day he said they and he felt like drinking the wall from Jacob's Well just that's all he had drink all the others everything was dirty one day he just felt within himself he said oh if I can just get a cup of that water again he didn't give a command he just said his wish and his servant took sword and drove two miles a couple of miles of Philistines of so they can get him that water for him to drink yeah yeah isn't that our desire tonight you know the scripture says a word that should be you know I I was going to entitle this the desire or the the the the God's desire for you I want that to be oh if we can only look at that and said that's what God desired me to be that only could be enough to drive to be your motivation no but we sparked through the scriptures we go through the crowds well is this God speaking or was this the prophet just speaking you know it was this his mind or was this God speaking to him when was God speaking with him when was he speaking by himself you will never get anywhere with that kind of thinking where have we got them to is that how we came in because we examine every word we examine everything and we knew this match and that match and that's how we came in no we came in because God moved upon us he drew us into him he saw he opened the message oh what a privilege so we can see him for he is and if that's the way we got in that's the way he's going to take us home it's gonna be him moving on this scripture moving on that scripture moving on this one until it fulfills the rapture right Amen in fact it says when you receive the new birth is the beginning of your rapture he says the element will build around that body that it believed the word you will believe you will build the the body around the element of that person that believes the word if we can only see that let's all stand perfect he says in marriage and the force he says and then the ceremony and that's when the bride or the bride takes the bridegroom's name she's no longer she's no longer she's no more than her own she takes the bridegroom's name it says and then after the church has a ceremony makes their promises then she texts the bridegroom's name she's no longer a church of the world she's the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ amen it says I don't mean by name I mean by birth by Nature the power of God by the revelation of the truth of the of of the the truth of God in in her heart it says she becomes a Christian Church the great Universal Apostolic Church uh Church of God she becomes a part of Christ when she does that it says listen to this Christ inject into her his own Spirit yes sir his own life and the Bible says to Adam and Eve you are no longer Twain but one and when a woman the church is married to Christ they are no they are no longer two they are one in Christ cry they are one in Christ it says Christ in you amen that's it it says his life has been brought into you then you become the bride the right is not by some Proclamation the right is by the life of the bridegroom coming into the bride the bride is not what we say we are is what the word says and the life of the word comes upon us and makes us walk the life of the Bride the life is what we are looking for yeah yeah the life is what we are planning for that's why he says I don't want to call our church I called you God why because he's bringing you into a different identification so now he could take his life and make it your life and your life becomes his life amen let's just bow he's our gracious father where could we go Lord it's you that has the words of Life father father When We Gather every day We Gather here Lord we know you have sent your messenger your messenger and you've sent us your word and it's to bring us into a certain manifestation and father that's what we desire more than anything we ask the night father that you may just once again Lord move Upon Us o God and make yourself a reality let your word we become so much word Lord that we are no longer as it's just you and you've made a way for us to go that way your Prophet says that you your word when you give us your word and I'm paraphrasing Lord is an invitation for us to receive your character and we want to receive the character tonight and say father give me that character because your Prophet told us we won't take anything out of this world except our character and we want to have a character that fit for that other place and therefore we ask father just move upon us let the word just shape us and mold us and bring us into the image Lord we are so privileged so thankful beyond measure but father tonight we want to see the fruits and the product of what you are doing walking with us leading us father taking away the things that desires of the world making yourself a real living God in our midst being lifted up out of history and making yourself a reality in your people the people of God is where the power of God is lead us or guide us Lord father that we may go out into the world and manifest you at the best way that you want us to we want to be real ambassadors and true ambassadors to you and we can only do it if you walk with us and your Prophet told us he said the way that you send Christ the god the way the same way that God sent Christ is the word that you're sending us the father that send him went in him and he said the father or Christ who's sending you he goes in you that's what we desire Lord go with us abide with us every day we commit ourselves to you and ask us things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] I hope we all understand we're never going to be able to do that without making contact and that's the question we all have to ask ourselves in our heart have I made contact with The Giver of the word not did I understand it but I didn't make contact with the life that's spoken and that's an everyday Journey there's not a one-time experience everyday life of making that contact foreign [Music] just shut everything out around you [Music] can you feel the spirit yes you can feel the spirit you can feel it moving you [Music] I want the spirit then spoken proud to touch me [Music] your place [Music] choose something special to reveal is [Music] [Applause] [Music] inside this house [Music] [Music] went out with that work God had faith in what he spoke do you said when he said let there be light he was wondering [Music] what light would be do you think when he saw your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and he saw you and he saw a perfect blood butt Christian you think he doubted what you would be he sent Faith with it knows he sent his word he sent his spirit foreign the word doesn't Quicken do you know that the word don't Quicken it's the spirit that quickens is the intention of what that word that was spoken as our brother just preached us that's what quickens you've got to make contact with that spirit the letter killeth but the spirit gives life and I think that's what our brother plea is we we want that Spirit to make contact with us foreign bogus doesn't take away from the real it's a matter of there's bogus doesn't matter if there's if there's false prophecy there's still true prophecy does it matter if there's emotions there's still true blessing so none of that that doesn't that that's not what we're talking about we're talking about a real genuine contact that was predestinated for you oh just think of it he had a relationship predestinated for me I want to grow in that don't you I want to look for the spirit behind the word I want to look for the life my brother so beautifully brought behind the word whatever this word is spoken I know there's a real living being a real life that you can make contact with even more than you could hug me the spirit's more real than this is because this changes those who have known me for a long time has known the changes but he's never changed to do all that you can this week to set aside some time just to make contact with him to let all the thoughts of the day go away just to be shut in with God go in that secret place and let the spirit of God move through you let it cleanse you think on all the good things he said it might make you shout Hallelujah might make You Weep sat in my living room the other day and I just sat there and I just thought of how good God was to me where I come from and just how good he was to me and just how good and everything I've got and okay and I know it was all from him I'm not educated I know all those things and I went over and I sat down with breakfast with brother Tommy as you know I just sat in my room at my corner of my house today and just thought how good he is he said you know Brother David I did the very same thing this morning at the same time I just thought of how good he is and if we would just do that well I'm not afraid of the spirit to move I want it to be the spirit amen and when the spirit moves I thought Billy put it so beautiful I want to walk out with a word attached to it because the anointing may go the feeling may go the blessing may go but he puts that word as an eternal sword for it I I just I got a song in my heart it's kind of like Beulah Land you know that song I'm kind of homesick [Music] aren't you and I I wanted I want to touch the I want to touch that life River I want to renewed in me that I know that it doesn't matter [Music] you remember how tough that was in the hospital I remember coming over and seeing you yes something inside you I knew that life was there God gave us I don't know how many more years but if I'd come to that River before the rapture life that causes the Raptors the same life that's going to take me over the river and we're going to have it now I like what our brother said he said well I want to be able to create the atmosphere of our expectation and our contact with the Lord that if somebody comes in our midst that God will be there to contact them it's going to take a lot of applying the token at home it's gonna take a lot of cleansing of our thoughts it's going to take sacrifice for one drink of that water or let me do whatever it takes because it's life is anybody else here home said I think he's trying to get us in Rapture and condition amen [Music] [Music] stupidness [Music] [Music] if you love me [Music] [Applause] God Jesus foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] to where my face [Music] [Music] I don't know [Music] [Music] am I Born shall be friends [Music] foreign [Music] would

much [Music] [Music] may I share a little something with you foreign told me words long if you notice when the Lord would have a parable or something to say he didn't mince words he didn't go around the block he didn't know it always was to the point there was a time in my life were I was we were raising a family and trying to develop a a practice and just a lot going on and in the church and so forth and I was praying to the Lord and I said Lord I just was like do you look a little closer to you I just want to be more like you and this is what he told me he said I can only be as close to you as you let me be [Music] say that again I being him can only be as close to you which is me as you let me be you know covert has kept us apart it has you know social distancing and can't shake hands you can bump elbows or fists or you know Satan has tried to separate us but you know nothing can separate us from the love of God we can always be as close to him as he can't separate us from him and
