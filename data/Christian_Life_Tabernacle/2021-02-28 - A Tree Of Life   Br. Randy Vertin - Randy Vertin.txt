in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] Amen Brother David King conu has a special man if you can come at this time amen God bless you s I actually uh I actually wanted to share a little testimony of something that has done for me lately you know we had a prayer line I believe two Sunday or three Sundays ago you know and uh deep within me I was struggling with giving uh social media a lot of time you know I felt like part of my life it was like I was leaving everything constantly in my phone and uh you know I was praying about it I was struggling a lot with that and then we came to the altar we prayed about it you know there was a a message I kept on going in my head where brother bham was talking about egyp the the Egyptians and the children of Israel where brother bham says the enemy that you once was serving one day will bow to you you know that he will be serving you you know I'm just grateful that uh God has helped me to take the tool that I once was serving you know now it's helping me reach out to other young people and bring the gospel to them and uh short test testimony to that is last night I went to bed like almost at 3:00 a.m. in the morning so we went live with uh you know my friend here brother Ben Ben and then we were just talking about the gospel reaching out to other people and then after that you know I had a call from a young man he was just like hey I was born and raised in the message but I've never taken it serious like just help me you know that made me really want to cry I was just like this has been my heart desire for the longest you know when I was ready to run away from the social media God took it as a tool to bring somebody closer to him so uh I hope the song I will sing will bless you it says the love of God you know it's great it's far you know we can't express explain it at time so sing with me if you will please the love of God he's greater far then tongues open can ever tell he goes beyond the highest stars and

[Music] [Applause] PR Our God PR amen praise the Lord we're witnesses that he's alive amen amen you can't be a witness of something unless you've seen it for yourself how many of you have seen Jesus Christ alive amen today amen we're just happy to be in the house of God let's just turn in our bibles if we could we'll just get right into the word to Genesis chapter 1 I know I really appreciate the word this morning I was telling Brother David in the back you know I F I felt in his shoes when he said when he listened to that message how he was seeing things in a whole almost like he'd seen it for the first time again that's the way I felt too this morning so certainly enjoyed that and just appreciate the word of God we're going to read out of Genesis 1: 26- 28 Lord willing we just maybe preach a message uh this morning or this evening I should say on uh if I give it a title it would be a tree of life a tree of life and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth and uh let's just also turn to Genesis chapter 3 just over a little bit and we'll go down excuse me to uh verse 14 and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life that I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel and let us also go to verse 22 of chapter 3 and the Lord God said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life amen let's bow our heads in word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we're just so grateful to you Lord Jesus and Lord if we were to look at ourselves as our pastor spoke this morning Lord it'd be so easy to to stumble upon each one of our own insufficiencies and our own faults and failures but Lord this evening we Look to You the author and finisher of our faith oh God we're looking at your Perfection Lord Jesus your Holiness your righteousness oh Lord Jesus we just ask tonight that you would come and speak to your bride Lord may you draw us closer into your bosom Lord to live more for you than we did the day before Lord Jesus to have more love for you Lord to increase Lord in brotherly kindness and faith and charity all these things that you've given to us Lord Jesus we just ask right now that you'd anoint the service Lord let your perfect will be done may we just fly up in into the heavens Lord on the Winds of the Holy Ghost Lord may we just set our wings Lord and let you carry us into the in the heaven heavenlies Lord and may you just speak unto us this evening father we just ask your blessing upon the reading of your word in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated if you just forgive me just uh you know I try just pray pray for me sometimes the Lord gives you an idea or a thought and you just pray Lord help me to maybe give it across the way he showed it to you but you know about supernatural things that you can't explain the supernatural so but you know what the Holy Ghost is The Interpreter so he'll he'll bring it to your heart the way the Lord would have it so I just really struck you know as we've been ministering over the last so many services on the work of the Lord and what the Lord's called us to in this hour and it's so easy to get caught up in our own faults and our own failures and to to lay in a if I could say an indirect way so many times we lay those things almost at the feet of the Lord because we think because things don't go the way we think they should that somehow the word of God has been made of none effect but if there's one thing I really just really spoke to me this morning that really kind of goes along with the idea the Lord put on my heart was that how our pastor spoke about being that one man denomination and and when I was thinking kind of on that when I was on the way home and getting ready for the service today and just thinking on these things something just really struck me at the how the scripture says because of the traditions of men you've made the word of God of none effect and so and and it just it came to my mind how even without thinking we so many times fall into that channel of tradition and and we become rigid when it comes to the ways of God yeah we we don't how brother brandom how he described if you remember that overgrowth and and that old dead burnt out forest and how they were all rigid and the wind would blow through they said it was a spooky oo why because the trees had been dead they had no life in them and so they couldn't do anything but just oh the days of Miracles has passed oh the word of God just doesn't seem to work the way that it used to oh I just don't see the the life of God being made manifest the way it ought to be but then when he could see the the little saplings that were growing up and how when the wind would blow over those little saplings he said the little leaves would flutter and their little branches would flop around and what was it they they were they were living they were flexible they could take the the spirit of God the anointing that God would bring to a person because remember a tree represents a person and how that that young flexible tree that had life in it could could flex and bend and move with the will of the spirit and just go wherever the spirit would lead but so many times we find maybe without even thinking about it we come to these traditions in our own minds because we just think well that's just the way it's got to be well maybe we've taken this tradition that well my family always did it this way well my dad always did it this way well this person always did it this way and this person always did it this way but unless that unless that comes back to the word it doesn't profit you anything and then in the end we might find ourselves coming to a place where we're so locked in we become a onep person denomination because we've gotten so many Traditions we've boxed ourselves into that we just can't break out of it but I I just I guess it just really struck me with that because I was thinking about this this kind of text a tree of life and how the lord gave a commandment see God's God's word is yeah and amen it's unchanging when God has says one thing one way it will always be that way he doesn't Veer to the left or to the right he's not a man that can make a decision one second and then say Oh I did it wrong I got to redo it no when he made a decision the first time that was the right decision and when he told Adam and Eve in the garden that at that point still their name being Adam being one and he said be fruitful and multiply replenish the Earth subdue the Earth have dominion over the Earth that's the command that went out of God's mouth and I'm telling you that there's going to be a people that are going to fulfill that word and I believe I'm looking at part of that people right now there is a people that are going to be fruitful there is a people that are going to multiply that are going to bring forth after their kind see God set forth the law in the Book of Genesis every seed will bring forth of its kind and no matter what the devil's tried to do in this age and throughout all the ages God's seed cannot be diluted God's seed cannot be hybrid it can't be hybrid with any you cannot mix the true word of God with anything that's right if it if it mixes with something else it never was the true word of God to begin with and even throughout all the church ages and we see those Riders going forth and how from the very beginning that nielan Spirit came and tried to twist the word well as soon as that word's been changed one iota it's no longer the word no matter how they could dress it up in their forms and their Fashions and that like our Pastor said it's nothing no matter what name they claim it's nothing but a Catholic spirit because it always goes back to Rome and I believe brother bradam tied that all the way back to Nimrod all the way back there it all goes back to Genesis that Gene chapter so God's seed can't be diluted and when he says he's going to bring forth of its kind it's going to bring forth of its kind so if that tree of life we're talking about a tree of life if the Tree of Life life was going to bring forth more see what's a tree a tree being a person remember brother brandom said these trees they were a type of people that's probably that mystery of the original sin being hidden in the Book of Genesis you're a tree you are a fruit tree and God having put it in even in the nature how we could see that every animal stays within that kind and they bring forth that's why the the world's version Evolution couldn't have happened anyway cuz God didn't say let every let every creature bring forth something mutated that'll bring forth something else mutated and bring forth something else mutated no he said brother brandham said God may have created it in an evolution he started with the lowest frog and then he went up to maybe a cat to a dog and and so far and then we get up to the and then he comes to the Pinnacle of a man and and and see how the devil would just take an idea of God and pervert it and make this this idea of well well we just started from a sludge and then we came up to an amoeba and then we just kind of all of a sudden that amoeba sprouted some legs and started hopping and then that thing just started doing this and doing that and here we are just a mistake a cosmic accident see and that's an anointing of the devil and there's no wonder why children in the schools today can't find meaning in their life when they're taught from the very beginning that you're nothing but a random sample of Adams smashed together over billions of years and there's really no reason for you to be here other than nature just said well blop here you are but God had a purpose for your life God has a reason for you to be here he's got a a mission just for you I don't care what how insignificant the devil tries to make you feel it does doesn't matter I tell you what when I if I had a you know I work in in the aircraft industry I'm an aircraft controller so I but I don't necessarily work directly with the airplanes mechanically but anybody that would one little screw out of place on that airplane and you better believe me they're going to be out it to fix it because every piece is critical every little part is important it doesn't matter how small the spring is in the watch you take that spring out it won't keep time right so is it with you as a part of the body of Christ you have a part to play that is so vitally important that even that without you we can't make it that's right there's no wonder why we got to keep seeking out that last seed because we can't make it without him and if we just sat back and rested in our predestination and just Bast in the bride Glory of I'm just so pred destinated meanwhile Souls languishing out in the world another seed as you once were out there somewhere without hope not understanding why they feel that there's something more for them that God is more than just an imagination or or just a little poof of smoke or a grandfatherly figure but he's a real living force that can change your life and without you to go out and seek why because you're his hands you're his feet you are his mouth peace you are and you are the light shining in the darkness in this day that God works through man and when I say man I I mean brothers and sisters man in general you got to be careful nowadays with the if you say man or woman and if you're not inclusive of everybody but we understand so God has called us to fulfill the scripture be fruitful and multiply replenish the Earth you're going to when now we're talking spiritually he want you to be fruitful he said I would above all things that you prosper and be in health God has a desire for you to have a life so prosperous not just in the natural but in the spirit that that your cup could overflow that that your life could overflow and spill over to your neighbor that doesn't know God that your life can overflow and spill over to your coworker that's searching for something but he's got to have someone to work through and that just happens to be you God's word can't be diluted it it can't be but see so many times the devil tries to turn our eyes put it put it in the mirror and look at all your faults and failures as if your failures are somehow going to stop the working in the program of God on it can't happen because God's word is immutable did not the prophet say unbelief does it hinder God no no sir it does not hinder God God's will will be done that's why Jesus said I'll teach you how to pray thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven and we know God's will is done perfectly in heaven and so will his will be done here on Earth but he wants to express that through a vessel he wants a vessel to express that through and it doesn't matter what your faults look like it doesn't matter what you think of yourself see we've got to stop thinking with our own brain and start thinking with the mind of Christ who saw you before the foundation of the world a perfect son or daughter of God in his presence standing before him faultless filled with the spirit of God covered by the glory of God in the Perfection of his son and you've got to start seeing yourself that way because otherwise you will always stop short of fulfilling the word of God because you'll always find an excuse to get out of it just like Moses God speaking with them face to face I sending you Moses what did he do he immediately turned his eyes from the burning bush not maybe not literally but inwardly he turned his eyes away from the very God Of Heaven in the burning bush speaking to him and looked at a mirror and all the devil magnified all of its faults well I can't speak so good well neither could brother brandom apparently I well I I'm a man slow at speech I can't do this I can't do that I've got these failures I've got this failure and and the Lord said it doesn't matter Moses it's not about you anyway but it's about the word of God being fulfilled you know the Lord really gave me I feel like a a revelation of something that that not not that I struggled with it in any way but I I don't know how many of you have ever heard the story of you know Abraham and ailec and you think about how Abraham says to Sarah just pretend you're my sister they're going to kill me you're beautiful I don't want to die really being a coward in that sense I mean let's just be let's just be honest about the situation being kind of a coward and wanting to run away said just pretend you're my sister all these things so she says fine I'll do it I'll save your life so he takes them and then he has the dream he says you're as good as a dead man I'm going to shut up all the wombs in your country if you don't restore him his wife and have him pray for you your country's gone your seed line's dead and I always kind of puzzled me because so many times I so see this is some of our problems so many times we put too much on a prophet and I and I'm not and I say that in this way because I used to public people say well it's because he's a prophet no it wasn't because Abraham was a prophet it was because and I heard it in the in that the message I'm probably going to read a few quotes from it restoration of the brid tree brother brandham said I don't have this quote in particular but brother brandham said that he said God had made the promise to Abraham that by Sarah the seed would come so he could not allow that vessel to be defiled because the word of God had to be fulfilled in that vessel so it wasn't anything even necessarily with Abraham himself but what did he say he said because I have sworn by myself to protect his own words God said you better restore her and Abraham just happened to be in the spot of the Prophet where he had could you imagine Abraham even that feeling when abic righteously could say you lied to me he says yeah I know and then had to Humble himself and say now could you pray for me and a could you imagine Abraham now there were I'm sure there were battles in his mind said oh Lord I know you gave me the promise but how could I being this cowardly deed that I did and yet what was it God honored his word god honored his word so it it's the it's the word that matters that what you think about yourself doesn't mean anything when he gave you a promise he's got to fulfill that word he will move Heaven and Earth before he he'll let a he'll let a word of his fall to the ground Heaven and Earth will pass away but his word would never pass away it's his word that he's holding to why he can't he can't do anything but that because he is his word and if he can't fail his word can't fail anything that tries to get in the way that includes you he will make sure that it works around so that it's word is fulfilled in you that's the grace of God that's predestination that's the love of God for you he wants you to be fruitful and multiply he wants you to go out into the highways into the B ways into the hedges he want and that could be that's at your workplace that's at when you go to the store that's even when that's when you come to church that that's when you go out for a walk with your dog or your family it it's wherever you are God is wanting to fulfill his word through you and it doesn't always have to be see we make it this this this great thing in the eyes of man oh you know Peter walking down the thing that say rise up and walk and just Miracles flying everywhere and shadows passing over people and people rolling off the graves and everything that's not what it is many times the work of God goes so unnoticed it goes so unnoticed you wouldn't even see it happening that's why he gave us these types that's why to let us know that even when we can't see it the law of God still stands the word of God still stands it doesn't matter what you see on the outside brothers and sisters it doesn't matter if the word has been spoken if you can pull together and believe it wherever two or three are gathered in my name I'll be there in the midst if any two of you if any if any of you agree as concerning one thing and you ask it in my name I will perform it if you can hold on to that that's a law amen that's a law God promised it I'm going to read this here from restoration of the brid tree he says now we have a law the law of life in us we don't only thing you have to do you're made and born and placed here in the body of Christ as Sons and Daughters of God you don't have to knck down to the devil we've got a law That's the Law of the Holy Spirit the only thing thing you know have to do is know how to let go and let God you keep fighting at it see and it won't never work when you let go and let God that's all if the fish said wait I'll catch my breath real good I'll breathe up a little oxygen in me and I'll see if I can go down no he does that he'll burst open see see that's what many times we try to do or if only I could just pray enough to to to witness to that person if only I could just listen to enough messages to get enough anointing on me where I could feel good about myself it's not about what you feel about yourself it's about what God said about you and then into what he said about his word see because if if you look for it you're going to get what you expect if you're constantly looking for reason to to sit down in the ditch and and be because that's the that's the age we live in it's so it's an age of negativity if we ever seen it before I heard that brother give the testimony about getting off the social media I mean it's just it's basically pure evil because they they Revel in the flaws of others it's what they it's what what happens that like Brother David said this morning they've got their Idols they and they just flat out they used to call them Stars fallen stars is more like it but now they just flat out call them Idols the American Idol that little singing show that they do oh I'm a I'm a football Idol I'm a basketball they just call them what they are now they don't even try to hide it but man they love it when when when one of these people they what do they do they build them up just to tear them down why because that's just how the devil works it doesn't matter well how much you gain in this world it doesn't matter how much fame or popularity you can get in high school cool because as soon as you do something silly all your so-called friends are going to be laughing at you just as much as everybody else if they're really your friends see what happens when you witness to them the Gospel of Jesus Christ and see e see if they'll stick with you then make a stand for God against all the garbage in the world and see if a real friend will stick with you then but I know a friend who sticketh closer than a brother Jesus Christ will stand with you no matter what yes amen sometimes you know you probably heard it all you ones that are in high school you know they talk about peer pressure you know there's such a thing as positive peer pressure too that's right hey brother you com to church hey you going to come to that Bible study maybe I'll put a little positive peer pressure on each other sometimes and that goes for all of us young and old it doesn't matter you know because there's some things it seems like even adults never grow out of you know I speak as a as as one of them I I'm pointing right here so we'll just keep reading here says the bird says I'll see how fast I can run down here and maybe I'll take off no he won't do it he'll fall down see he's got to know how to control no how that law can control him and the same way it is with us it isn't if we fight and Pull and hurry and oh if I don't get this if I don't get that that's not it it's to know that the law of life is in you am and you just let go and let God then he takes you to your healing takes you to the baptism of the spirit or anything that he's promised any claim that he's given is yours and by letting go and letting God now if you if the officer was going to going to take the fellow that stole your property was going to take him to court and you keep pulling him back well I don't know just whether he should do this or not he will never get him there just let him go that's the way you do let Satan just get away all the doubts and everything flee from your mind then God will raise you up good that's what we got to do is get out of our own way just let let go and let God I really like that in the the what we were Brother David was ministering and listening to and what we read about how so many times it's just and I'm paraphrasing how he just sometimes it's we just don't do the things that God tells us to do because it seems so hard we don't I think he's the way he said it was we don't give God the service that he's do he's done all these things for us and then he says go go pray for this brother and it seems so hard to do it come on he says oh maybe go uplift this person or go do this little thing or go do that little thing and then it seems like it's such a burden but that's about letting go and letting God am if you could submit when the Lord puts that on your heart when he gives you something to do being faithful in little then being faithful in much he says oh go pray for this person oh go talk to I'm using just natural things but these are the everyday things that we let slip and and if we could get to the point where in in our everyday little things we could just let go oh the remember I I know I've T spoke this before but oh the the the Lord puts it on your heart go maybe call that brother or sister and pray for him just puts it on your heart you have no idea what's going on but I like I said it ain't the devil anointing you to pray in the name of Jesus Christ for a brother or sister but we will reason our way into a figurate not how to get out of it oh well I just I had a bad day today I kind of had a bad attitude I I don't think you know that anointing wouldn't be there the way it should and you know they're you know they're going to hear it in my voice I'm having a bad day and you know to be honest I their life's probably really good anyway I don't need to talk to them oh they don't even want to talk to me anyway they're always so busy see how the devil likes to lie to you and all the while the Lord just say just let go let God just let me work through you right there the Lord is trying to say just this is my work I want for you to do right now little or big it doesn't matter and we're getting somewhere with that because when we see what God has called for each one of us in our in our just even our daily lives it's so much greater than you can imagin amen it's so much greater you you have been called to be a tree of life that's right you have been called to be a tree of you're not the tree of life but you've been called to be a tree of life why because God seed cannot be diluted when his seed was placed in you it's going to produce the exact same as the original because God doesn't do hybrids he doesn't do half and half have you ever thought about the fact that we've never seen a purebred human being did you know that we've never seen a purebred human being because according to the flesh it all got mixed up as soon as the guard of Eden and then after the flood when everything got messed up messed up after that that's why we don't we that's why know we no man after the flesh oh they want to run Bloodlines and do this and do that you know Israel can do that because that's for them they can know who's who because God's called that's even in the scripture that they would know who's who but we know no man after the Flesh and yet the devil always points that's the only thing he can point to because when when you have come into the Holy Ghost into the word and been separated severed by the word of God from the desires and the love of the flesh it has no hold on you you start to come to a revelation that's not even you to begin with that's not who you are but that's the only hold the devil has the scripture says that God condemned sin in the flesh if I can say it another way he trapped it in the flesh he sealed It Away In the Flesh and it's constantly trying to get out that's why you got to Die daily every day you got to seal him back up and say get behind me Satan kill that flesh put him back in the ground it's kind of interesting we know the numerologies and everything and how six is the number of man there's a reason why they bury him six feet under that's where man belongs that's where the flesh belongs put him under your feet s feed under every day but he's called you to be a tree of lifeall you are a tree of life whether you think so or not brothers and sisters you may not even see it yet it on you may not see it yet but you are why because you can't be anything other than what the original is you can't because God doesn't produce anything other than himself every seed will bring forth after his kind so if the first was deity was Perfection was a tree of life then his offspring will be Perfection will be deity a tree of life now oh brother that's going too far no I'mma chip off the old block I'm a part of my daddy I came from my daddy I'm going back to my father I I can't help it it's who I am it's who you are yeah many people would go too far oh I'm God I'm this and I'm that no sir you are that because he put it in you and everything that's why he said I am the vine you are the branches without me you can do nothing hallu if the if the if the brand if the if it abideth alone it doesn't bear anything but if it abides in the vine it'll bear forth much fruit so you are a tree of life yeah you may you may not haven't come into your season yet that's okay you're going to bloom soon enough you know every tree has its season you know every tree has a different number of fruits that it Bears it has a different type of fruit that it Bears it has a different part of the year that it Bears its fruit it has a different a different part of the world that it Bears its fruit in the different temperatures it's got to be under apples don't always necessarily bear fruits you know they say it takes a pineapple like a year or something or more to just to Bear one pineapple I I remember I talked to a to a guy at work and he was talking about planting asparagus it takes I think three years before you can even get one asparagus stalk off that thing before it's able to be eaten but brother once it thing's eaten you can cut that thing off almost every day and it just keeps growing and growing and growing and you got food for days so don't get discouraged enaged when when when it looks like oh Lord I'm just maybe not bearing the way out to I don't see as much as I should you just stay in the presence of the sun you just keep eating the word your season's coming hu your season's on its way God has a fruit that he wants to see out of your life that only you can [Applause] bear he's got a purpose for you you he's got a reason that you're here right now we're just shoveling we're just we're just watering it with the washing of the Water by the word we're just shoveling you know those trials that's just you know sometimes that's what did he say when the tree if a tree said what would you do what would the master do with the tree that didn't bear any fruit he said they try to they dig around it they dig a ditch around it and dung it they'd fertilize it you know sometimes you're stinky horrible smelling trials that's nothing but God digging a ditch around you putting some fertilizer on there Hallelujah sometimes those things you're going through the Lord says I desire that it bear much fruit sometimes he's got to get the pruning shears out and start slicing a couple branches off CU a few things maybe some poison ivy trying to glom on you come on now trying to leech itself off you're trying to leech the life off but the Holy Ghost will come with a two-edged sword and start slicing and hacking and as long as the life it's still in the roots it'll just start sprouting forth more fresh shoots that are flexible again that are free from those parasites don't you worry about it it's coming to pass the life was in the seed it doesn't matter what it looks like that's why you're so important because your life is a light and that seed needs light to J terminate when you're going about your day at work and you're just kind of forgive me for saying down in the dumps or you just kind of feel like I just I'm such a failure I can't how can I witness to anybody you got to let your light shine you're in a dark place we're in a dark hour and that light has even more of an effect you know the effect of light is magnified the darker it is what little light you think you got might as well be a giant Spotlight in this world that's right for the darkness that is here and how do you know that that light just even your life is a light you it doesn't even if you didn't say anything just your life has an atmosphere behind it has a power behind it has something behind it that someone would be uncover aable about and wouldn't even be able to explain why because it's a presence of God it's not about you it's about what you're packing it's about what you're carrying you know if you took if you took a big ball a uranium 235 what they use in the nuclear weapons stuff that baby in a suitcase you may not be able to see it but put a Geer counter up to it and that thing's going to go that's what it's like for you when you get around the devil sometimes when those when those people that you're working with they don't know know something's making them twitch and something's making them mad at you something's making them be nice to you even you don't even know but something produces something they can't see it they don't know why they doing it but there's something in you it produces a reaction and you just let that light shine you may not even see it because but all it takes it doesn't matter how deep in the muck and me it is I we'll read a quote about it here in a minute but how that seed could be buried under 30 feet of mud it could have Frozen brother Bram talks about how it could freeze and the pulp burst out and everything all it takes is that sun to shine on it one time and that baby will germinate it it'll germinate it can't that's life it can't stop it so how do you know that your light shining that one time wouldn't catch that seed that's way down deep in that person you never thought about oh no you know oh brother I didn't see nothing I've witnessed to so many people I've I've done this I've done that you don't even know what's going on behind the scenes because we are living by what we can see and well I didn't see him come to church and I didn't see him do you don't know what's going on in the inside remember our brother bandam talked about Reverend Lily that seed buried underneath down underneath the pond and then below the pond beneath the mud but all it took see nothing can stop that light those little light photons or whatever go shooting through the ground poof there's the life can't stop it you don't even see it but it's working you you can't you can't see nothing yet there oh there ain't no fruit there there ain't no life there you can't see it's working behind the scenes you don't don't worry about it it's going to do what the life was made to do because there's a law in that seed that it must bring forth and so that thing just starts to grow in it starts to push in it starts to grow in and pushing up pretty soon oh you still can't see anything oh it's out of the mud but now it's below 30 feet of water it just keeps on going just keeps on going keeps drawing in what it can and then pretty soon you see the flower on the surface and then it amazes us someone come to church that you never thought about that you witnessed to 5 years ago you didn't know that it struck the seed then and it's just been percolating it's been growing it's been churning little by little you didn't know what was going on behind the scenes it's but it's so simple but you got to let your light shine you've got to be out there it's like it's like how do we talk about that magnet brother brandom spoke of that's going through how it power up and it would start carrying all the junk and different things and carrying it off he's like oh my it's like that gospel magnet that's coming you know you're a gospel magnet too when you're walking through life you know yeah you you ever had you ever maybe witnessed to certain people and you could feel the pull you could see that there's something there you could almost see the Revelation catch but but then it's almost like something holding what's it they're bolted down still why because that magnetism is trying to pull them but they're pulled back by denomination maybe they're bolted down by a family or something something they just can't let go of yet you don't worry about it you don't worry about it because the light struck the seed and if it comes if that seed was on good ground it'll come forth and then there's some time you may be walking along again and not even know it and blink now all of a sudden somebody's coming to church mag ties right J say I didn't do anything that's right you didn't do anything you remember one sews one Waters but God gives the increase so many times you know we're just reaping we say oh praise the Lord I I got this guy that you know this this this guy off the street this brother the sister to come to church it's like well praise the Lord you don't even know you may hear a testimony beyond that what was happening behind the scenes for years before that time time of harvest came that's why it's so important you are a tree of life and and as a tree of life that we ought to be always ready to give of ourselves yes when someone asks that's why I just I was so praising the Lord for it how how we were talking about that artisian well because brother brandom dramatized it when that little artisian well had a little personality he says well what makes you bubble up so much what makes you do this and do that that's right and what was one of the characteristics of that well was that it let all the creatures just come up and drink freely whenever they needed it he said oh there's nothing like a cool drink of artisian well water he said we appreciate those things and that's what you are it said if you could take this word out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water and we got to be ready when someone comes don't even know they need a drink give them a drink that's don't even know that they're getting a drink and you don't even know what it's feeding down in their soul that's right we think oh it's got to come this certain way and this person's going to come the way I think they're going to because I they just seem to see it you don't know what God's doing behind the scenes we got to have so much more patience with with the with the will of God because we want to we want that microw wave thing just I want it to be done oh so do I don't get me wrong I'd love to snap my fingers and see my family all believe in this message but you know what they're coming anyhow they're coming anyhow it doesn't matter it doesn't matter where your loved ones at if they're below that 500 feet of mud that light could to strike the seed it may have already struck the seed and you don't even know what's going on behind the scenes just because you haven't seen the manifestation yet doesn't mean it ain't happening there you go there you go I like this in the restoration of the brid tree we'll just read a few more here he said now it's Easter time oh I like Easter yes sir but there's too much on Easter today about bunny rabbits and ducks and pink chickens I've never seen a pink chicken but and pretty hats and new dresses and that's not Easter Easter is the resurrection restoring to restore back it's God's restoring time you look out over the Earth God is restoring restoring what nature that's right he's restoring the flower he's restoring the leaves he's restoring the fruits of the field what is it God is restoring it's Easter means to bring it back what is it there's been a sentence a claim Easter claims are the flower now I want you to listen to this the flower claims it has a right to rise again oh I like that see you don't know we want to think that we know all that's going on inside the inside of someone that we're witnessing to her or family members but inside they don't even understand it I mean how many times maybe you could go back in your own life and see when the Lord brought you what was it that did it was it your great desire to serve God was it you just doing as much as you could no God it was almost like a light switch just turned off what was it God said it's your time Glory am the light struck the seed and there was a seed that said I have a claim to enforce here I got a right to rise again that seed that he placed before the foundation of the world said you know what I got a ticket I got a claim to a resurrection and it's time to redeem it's time to redeem that prize so don't you worry about it don't worry about it on your own time he says the flower claims it has a right to rise again and God law of nature pulls the Earth around and makes the law of God in nature bring forth an Easter a resurrection listen to that listen to that again he said and God's law of nature pulls the Earth around and makes that law of God in nature bring forth an Easter it's beautifully the return of the sun to restore what the winter killed while it was from the earth God sends the Earth back around the Sun as we're told from way back here the earth the earth went away from the sun went back out here that's the way the sinner does gets away from the S so n isn't that what winter is how many of you remember some of your your astronomical classes how when we have winter here it's because the Earth is farther away from the Sun and we're tilted away so the sun's Rays don't hit us as directly so we're colder that's all it is it's just a season you let the law of God work he says it got away from it but when this Earth begins to come back and when it's out there death strikes it it's winter we're just coming out of that now it kills every living thing it can kill out in Here and Now when the earth gets back around the seeds is laying in the ground they're frozen the pulps run out of them the and everything's gone but there's a little life preserved I'm going to say that there's a little life preserved don't you worry about your loved ones don't you worry about the ones that you've been praying for for all these years how cold and dark it looks I don't care if it looks like their life is exploded and everything's burst out there's a life preserved there's a life preserved in there and when the season comes cuz what was it it's working according to God's law yes sir when that when that Earth when that little vessel that person whoever it may be starts God starts to move move them just a little closer all of a sudden things start to thaw out a little bit all of a sudden the lights begin to shine and then all of a sudden this light strikes the seed sir you still may you still might not see it then those things are germinating beneath the surface you just give it time pretty soon it'll start you'll start to see the fruits of it you'll start to see that little Sprout come up you'll start to see it put forth leaves it's the law of God a little life preserved and as soon as the sun gets back in position with the Earth again then there is an Easter a restoration up comes the flowers again up comes everything all that the winter killed the sun restores all that Winter's death killed the son of life restores oh I like that and so is it now with the people all that the Winter's coldest of cold former religion killed out there the nearing of the Son of God in these last days coming to his church restores it back to life again I will restore sayeth the Lord see God restores his flowers his leaves his nature his seed of the earth and therefore we know then that God will restore also his habitation he will restore his Eden he will restore everything that death killed that's right Hallelujah now the only way that can ever remain dead is to let it lay in the wrong place but if it falls in the right place it's got to come back to life life again so God let us fall in the right channel for restoration so we've already we've already been see that's the predestination though that seed's already fallen on good ground so now all it needs to do is to bring its life forth that seeds I'm good ground I don't know about you but for the foundation of the world God planted a seed yes in that good ground you are that good ground and now all you got to do Let It Grow doesn't matter how cold it got doesn't matter what winter looked like and how desolate it looked sometimes it needs to get a little desolate like the scripture said this morning be desolate be grieved sometimes it needs to get that way so then we can really get to that point how brother randam said let go and let God where we're finally just say Lord I'm going to let the life do its work I'm not going to try to hinder it I'm not going to put man's hands to it see there was a reason in the scripture when they built an altar in the Old Testament in the beginning and the Lord told him he said don't even lift a man's tool upon it don't even lift your hammer on it don't lift the tool of a man on that altar why because it's not made to be touched by man get those denominational hands off my bride get those denominational hands off my people get man's ideas off that that's what we're doing if you start put your hand to it the tree will grow crooked let God's work do its thing oh you'll you'll see you'll see that tree maybe get uproot a little bit it's big storm came and shook it out a little bit man wants to go and put a steak in and tie it to it it'll pervert the tree but brother ramam said when those storms come if it's planted by the river of waters those storms and those shakings only come to make those roots grow deeper there's a purpose behind it but man would come and put their hands on it and pervert it don't even lift a tool upon it don't try to figure it out yourself don't try to make something happen you can't make it happen that's right you could take a person off the streets that wasn't born a born a child of God and educate him in every single word of this book but educate them in every word of this message and they'd still die a sinner and go to hell that's right but you could take a son or daughter of God that come from the garbage heap that look like nothing drug addled drunk apostate looking like garbage out there on the road running with women or men doing whatever but that light strike the seed once and it comes to life it's not about what you can do it's about the word of God and the Holy Ghost working through you that's we got to stop trying and when I say that we got to stop trying to force the issue to make it happen though in our own mind you just got to let the light shine don't make it complicated well I got to show them this scripture and I got to show them exactly if the Lord leads you that way sure but so many times we just get it locked in our head oh I got to I got to do this and I got to do that you don't have to do anything except yield to the spirit of God let that light shine we're not going to hold you much longer we'll close here in just a minute but you know you are you're that tree of life when when when when God sends someone your way to take of the Tree of Life to eat so they could be refreshed so that they could receive life you say brother well we can't do that yeah you know your Prophet called you little Messi you can impart eternal life it it's not see oh well that lifts us up too much no because it's not about you it's not about you it's about what's inside of you it's about the what you carry see the devil would come along oh you're trying to make yourself something I didn't make myself anything God made me who I am and I know that this outside person you see is garbage anyhow why why do I know that because in order to go back into his presence I got to let go of this and get a new one but there's something inside sir that's going to make the whole journey brothers and sisters they can't help it because we won't well oh man it he I I didn't put it there you didn't put it there so why do we keep thinking we can shove it into somebody else all of your desires can't force the issue that's right that doesn't mean there's it's bad to have that desire but if that's what you're relying on that it's misplaced rely on the word of God he promised it that's why you know when when the Lord revealed this message to me I had two brothers come and give me a Bible study on serpent seed and baptism and the entire Bible study was four scriptures and they had they had only seen this seen the truth of this message for about a week and they didn't know nothing either but when the light strikes the sea I couldn't explain it but I had to go back to my family I had to go I had phone calls from my former denominational pastor's wife try to tell me that this was a cult that this wasn't of God and I didn't know anything up here but there was something in here that was already anchored so deep that I had to tell her look I I don't know I don't know nothing about no cult I don't know nothing about nothing else the only thing I know is that what I see is in the word of God and I got to run with it I got to run with this thing and the Lord ain't disappointed he ain't he ain't disappointed nothing I've disappointed him many times but he ain't disappointed nothing and so is it with any of you you think oh I can do this and do yes we pray for our loved ones we get on our knees and we weep and we're going to cry out for them but you know what when all comes to it we drive a stake in the ground and say Lord your word said Hallelujah that it would bring to pass that's where we lay it because if your if your if your desires lay anything inside of you of what you can do well then you failed from the get-go because you're a failure to begin with In the Flesh oh my goodness why because it's it proves it's an anointing of the Catholic Spirit anyway because that's what the Catholic Spirit does convert or die and many times whether we think so or not we almost want to take people just believe it how can't you because why because when he's revealed it to you it's so obvious you can never see anything else but how could if the Lord has opened your eyes to see the sun and a blind man who ever never even knew the sun existed why can't you see the Sun come on and the poor blly man says well I don't have any eyes to begin with how can you be mad at the man why because it doesn't lie in your ability to do it anyway and see in that example it's easier for us to get out of the way because NE none of us can form eyes how much more in the spiritual you know now in the natural they're getting to a point if if the Lord were to Terry another 20 years I have no doubt they'll be able to plug in bionic eyes into a person's brain and make them see can only do at the hearing to an extent man will be able to counterfeit anything just about that God can do so if man is is working towards that but we would just put that off in the natural and say well of course I couldn't do it I can't create eyes then how could we ever put ourselves in a position where it's up to us to bring someone to to to make them accept life or not why because if the life is there and you Shine the Light and you're there to offer that drink of water you're there to offer life you're there to shine the light of the Gospel if the seed's there it will follow the law of God and it will come to pass it will come to life because it's the law that was placed in it didn't have anything to do with you get yourself out of the picture I want you to think about this as we close think about and I'm not going to turn to the scripture but we know it think of Mary and we we just had our our brother I can't remember the name preach a lot about Mary and all those things a few weeks ago when he came and think about Mary though she receives a promise you're going to have a son his you're going to call his name Jesus now I want you to think about this nothing in the natural what's special about Mary nothing there were many other virgins many other women many other devoted there may have been more there may have been many women that were more devoted than married I mean that's just a fact if you read the church age book right at the end brother brandom talks about the false and the true you know brother brandom said that the false will outshine the true in works and Zeal think about that the next time you think that just because someone on the outside is working like crazy that means anything it doesn't mean it's bad you know we can go too far off on the other side but see the the devil is always trying to make you look at the negative see you see someone out there on fire for God trying to do the work of the Lord and then what's the devil going to do he's going to be right there in your ear say you could never achieve that see how they're working for God you need to love God you need to do just what they're doing in order to do it because that's how the life would produce it well it produces it in them but that's not my calling maybe maybe I'm not called to that well then see what the devil see i' I've said this before but I'm going to say it again he's going to get you coming and going because now I'll say something like this out of the church age book The the false lot Shine the true and works in Zeal now the next time you see someone on fire for God and trying to do God a service and doing something wonderful for the Lord the devil's not going to be there saying oh you can't do it he's going to be like oh you don't want to be like that because that ain't nothing but serpent seed anyway that's the false see how he get you one way or the other so that's why we stick with the word we stay with the word and we say Lord I don't know what you have for that one I don't know what you have for this one but what do you have for me let me fulfill my part and you know what that's what Mary Did did she not she said let Lord be it unto me according to Thy word now I want you to think about this she had a life in her she was literally carrying the Son of God but that's a type remember a woman types the church but put yourself in this position now she didn't she wasn't anything special in that sense she wasn't out there doing anything she's just living her life doing what God called her to do which was let go and let God the Holy Ghost will overshadow you you're not going to have really a part in this other than being the vessel and you shall bring forth the son and shall his name Jesus and I love the way brother brandom dramatized it because remember now her cousin Elizabeth also had a had a seed but remember that seed was dead she still had a seed though I want you to think about how powerful how you can impart life you don't even see it you not even think you're doing anything special remember brother brandham dramatized and said they came together and they were meeting I believe Elizabeth was already six months pregnant but the baby hadn't even moved still born dead baby but she was promised she had a promise and she was standing on that promise now Here Comes Mary not even thinking anything see this is the wonderful thing I love about this is because it wasn't about Mary and it wasn't even about Elizabeth but it was about God performing his word because what did she do brother brandom kind of dramatized it and said he basically just kind of told her what had happened gave her a salutation and said Elizabeth you'll never believe what happened happen an angel came and told me I'm going to have a son without even knowing a man and you know what's going to happen I'm going to I'm when he's born I'm going to call his name Jesus and he said at the very mention of Jesus out of the the name the Mortal lips she said the Babe whooped within her uh leaped within her womb and she and then she goes on whence cometh the mother of my Lord and all these things but what was it she imparted life to that baby it's something as simple as a testimony she wasn't doing nothing but giving her testimony we think we got to go out there and preach a crazy sermon we got to we got to preach the house down we got to have people falling out of the aisles when the miracle happened just by her telling a testimony she came see but why did it work because Mary was a seed who has happened to be carrying a seed and Elizabeth was a seed who happened to be carrying a seed that hadn't been quickened yet and all she had to do was let her light shine all she had to do Elizabeth let me tell you what God did for me I don't know a lot of things I'm not a great philosopher I'm not a great priest or a rabbi but L but there's an angel that came to visit me I'm going to tell you what he told told me and what he showed me and what he did for me and just by telling that testimony brought life to a seed that was dead so is it with you you have to let your light shine you are a tree of life that's right and when people come to you looking for something you say I don't know what to give them just give them what you got that's why brother brandom could say just tell them how the candle got lit why because it took something as simple as a testimony to bring forth a John the Baptist how do you know that your testimony won't bring forth someone that's going to shake down something for the Lord you don't know that's right but the devil tries to oh it's got to be this great big thing it's got to be prayer lines a mile long and it's got to be healings and limbs coming back oh I believe that too I believe every bit of it I take all of it but it it but we we've gotten this we have to get to the little before we can get to the big so let's focus on the little things let's not leave the little things undone I hope this is all right I just it's just really on my heart because you know we've come to the point where you know just shining your light right now is such a powerful thing because it's in such a minority you know we were brother brother David was ministering this morning on on that denominational spirit and these broken sisters and I thought about it I said well that's nothing but the truth when it comes to e every individual's life because how Jesus could say he said I the vine you are the branches if you cut that vine off if you cut that Branch off the branch becomes stagnant it's dead it has no life and and so many times it's because if you want to so we our light needs to shine how how does it Shine you got to be in contact with the power source you got to be in constant contact with the power source and it's got to come to a place where as Jesus said I and my father are one and I would that they be one even as we are one see it used to be in the outer Court you would have the Sun that would come up and go down it would come up and go down they'd go through light and dark light and dark so we came a little farther and now they're in the the the the inner Court and they're in the Holy place where well there's some light shining but it's it's kind of more of a man-made light yeah they could shine a little bit here and there but how did brother brandom say it get a little smoky they need to do a lot of maintenance on it but see we are coming to a place where in that restoration of the brid tree where the the uniting time where you with your light and the power source are going to become one are becoming one where your light is always shining whether you know it or not and and why because that's that shakina of Glory the holy of holies that Holy Ghost Light that never stops shining day or night it doesn't need any cleaning it doesn't smoke anything up but it's an everpresent life all the time 247 when he speaks you follow his his his smallest thought is your greatest desire that's where he's bringing his people in this day and he wants you to be that tree of life if you take remember he wants to there there's there's almost there's two ways to stagnate right either you get cut off from the source or you refuse to let the source flow if the S if the if the Lord has poured himself his spirit in you but you don't do anything with it what's going to happen you're just going to stagnate you're just going to be never moving but that water that's always flowing we got to open up those channels and let them flow let that light shine let the water of life flow through you because he's looking for you to deliver it to others let's just all stand remember it could be something as simple as a testimony what's the Lord done for you that could bring life to that seed oh my let's just bow our heads oh Lord Jesus we just are grateful to you Lord Lord you've done so much for us Lord you've given us more than we ever deserved according to the flesh oh God if it were left up to us us we would have been just out in the world somewhere not knowing what to do or who we were but Lord you reach down your Mighty hand Lord and you opened our eyes filled us with your spirit Lord Lord we just ask right now oh God that you would help us to be willing yielded vessels to you lord lord when the devil would come in and try to point us out all of our faults so God may we just throw our faults underneath the blood and look to you the author and finisher of our faith Lord Jesus you are the one that that we look to Lord Jesus we're not Lord when you were on Earth even you told your disciples it's not I that do the works but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works and Lord if you could say that how much more should we be saying that lord it's not us that are trying to do anything but Lord you that dwell in US Lord you'll do The Works Lord help us to be willing yielded vessels help us to be a tree of life lord always willing like that artisian well to offer a drink of cool water to those that would be thirsty Lord that we would let our light shine that our lives would go out and be salty Lord and cause others to thirst Lord you'll do it for us Lord because it's in your word you promised it there's a law of that seed that's going to bring forth Lord may you give us patience Lord to endure to continue to press forward Lord and know that your word will come to pass Lord because it's not our ability Lord but it's your law it's your power lord lord your Holy Ghost is the one that enforces these laws lord it's not us that has to do it but Lord we just rest and we let you do it Lord Jesus we just ask right now that you'd go with each and every one as we go our separate ways Lord may we not be separated ated from that Source Lord that Holy Ghost Lord that fills us and energizes us to do your will Lord may it us and that the Holy Ghost we we just can become one Lord Jesus may you just go with us Lord this evening Lord all the needs that are in the hearts of your people Lord you knew them before the foundation of the world andure our sufficiency Lord to to fulfill all the things that we have need of we just ask you be with us now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you know just as the last little thing you know you know your life just by living your life you know being that salt how brother brandom talked about that salt's got a contact to preserve so as you're out there shining your light being salty you know just living your life for the Lord if he doesn't put it on your heart necessary to say something specifically all the time your very life in the way you carry yourself in the atmosphere you you possess will actually make others thirsty when they see all around you everything's falling apart in the world and the insanity that's going on and yet you can go into work smiling praising the Lord singing the songs of Zion you know brother brandom told the story about the slave that was the the son of a king you know that's us on this Earth uh we're not slaves in so much as that but maybe trapped in this flesh sometimes it feels like but you know there was something about that that man that carried himself in such a way that even those around him notice something about him and they had to inquire that's what we want to be have a life that's so salty that they don't have a choice but to inquire well why everybody else is this way but why are you this way cuz you're you're something different and whether you think so or not that Holy Ghost in you believing the word of this hour you're something way different you're something way different brothers and sisters you know so many times we keep our circles so tight here which is good that we don't even we and we have no concept of the way the world sees us oh brother and sisters believe me the world if you just live that life and you let the Holy Ghost flow they're going to they're going to be thirsty you're going to be sorry Sal Y and and you want to be that that River of flowing water flowing out that you can offer something to drink you could be a tree of life to offer life when they come asking amen we'll have our pastor come and how many of you love the Lord amen praise the Lord enjoy that this evening you know I think one of the most in important parts about letting our light shine is to entertain the presence of the Lord you know in too many times we we just run off or we close service but I thought this morning or this evening as brother Randy spoke I I thought of our our brother and sister uh mother Anette and sister Deborah were coming back from El Paso and the brother told me he said I was driving and I knew I had to get the gas and I passed this one I pass that one I I finally was led to this gas station or this place to eat and he said we were there eating and a couple come up to us and they asked us they said are you uh Apostolic and uh the brother said no but we're Pentecostals or we're Christians is what he said we're Christians and they talked a little while and the brother man gave them the card and and I text the man the other day and I said brother Driscoll I couple of my people met you and and uh they said that uh you might be interested in discussing the way that we uh serve the Lord and he texts me back he says yes I'm really interested I really want to get together and fellowship with you and and uh I you know and I just thought just the brother just driving through led by the Lord and the man wants to he said I'll call you later I want to sit down I want to talk and I thought my heart you know it doesn't matter whether he wants to convert me or I want to convert him God hallelujah he's in control how many feel his presence tonight I do and so I'd like I'd like to take a few moments for each of us individually as we worship and we sing a song just take a moment and let that artisian Wells bubble up a little bit let the spirit mellow your spirit and let the words that were spoke today settle in I'm going to let my light shine I'm going to let the spirit flow through me I'm going to spend a few moments to evening just worshiping the Lord and praising the Lord and letting his presence soaked in I'm not just going to run out I'm going to wait a minute at this feet just just going to sit here and see what he has to say maybe he'll reveal to me my healing yes maybe he'll speak to my heart and tell me which way to go or what attitude to change or what nature what better way I can be this Shining Light but nothing's going to happen outside of him would you just want to spend a moment in in his presence just letting it soak in let's just entertain him for a few moments this evening and let the Holy Spirit move through us let this word that our brother preached to us the tree of life that that maybe that life can move up from the sap that has kind of gone out of us and come back up and put for tender leaves and tender fruit bil

God's service to us but like we said when it comes for us to do a service sometimes it just breaks our pattern I I I don't care I don't want a pattern sir I don't want to run from the battle I don't want to seek safety I have safety I have it in the Lamb of God if God be for me who can be against me Lord put me in service put me in battle put your words upon my lips I don't have to take no
