price that we would have had to [Music] pay oh Father may we bring others to the acceptance of their forgiveness and a realization of the love that took their sins and their punishment upon him that by those stripes our chastisement was laid upon him and that by those stripes we are healed we ask that father in Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated um I I I certainly want to uh thank the person that left the note at my back door I uh they didn't leave their name on it but I I certainly uh appreciate them doing that and uh I would love for them to uh come talk to me that'd be wonderful I really like to uh um share those things and have a deeper understanding of those things but so God is uh really good um I I want to kind of build on what I'm done are they I I really believe they think I'm going to sing someday Tim if you'll sing with me I'll sing No we're safe okay thank you um um but we we we understood this morning that he doesn't want to be ashamed of us and we understood what would make him ashamed of us and then as we talked within the framework of the message we saw that God is calling for a people that will not be ashamed of him embarrassed and we realize that in every age God had a way that he did things and it was always contrary to the way man thought it would be but he reveals it to those certain people and they see it and they recognize it and when they see it and they recognize it they've received that Revelation from God and and that's what revelation does revelation is to see something that was previously hid and when something's hid from you and you don't know it exist you're only going to act accordingly to the things that you see right that reminds me of the of I think it was Gesa when when he said oh my goodness look at all these armies Master what are we going to do we're doomed where uh it's it's all over it can't get worse than this our pipes are froze for sure and he just was there and and uh and the great prophet said Lord open these boys' eyes there's more with us than there are with them and in an instant his eyes were open and he saw on the Hills all around the Angels were encamped about them do you know the angels of the Lord are encamped about the righteous and those that serve him but because he couldn't see and and he didn't have the the vision and the Revelation to catch the picture and that's why Revelation really is a gift of God because it allows you to see many people they they see brother brandom's Ministry and they believe that he was a a a great healer uh they talk about his gift all the time on television because they have to do something with it when the lady in the purple dress showed up yeah they were like what do we say and they talk about the visions and they talk about and they have all kinds of explanation for it but they never saw him as a deliverer of a message and therefore if they don't see him as a deliverer of the message they don't look for the message to speak to him but God has given you Grace and he's opened your eyes and he said blessed is he that hath ears to hear or understand what the angel said so that great that great gift that God gave you of Revelation to be able to see is a wonderful privilege and it should never cause us to have ill feelings to those that can't see that's right and and so we we want to uh talk so if you have your Bibles we're going to go through scripture by scripture uh St John uh the not not the Gospel of John but the epistle what we call first John 4 first John 4 and so we talked about being ashamed but now the scripture is going to speak to us and John is going to write to us the description of somebody that God is not ashamed of so in other words if you possess these things as we go through them that's what the father is not ashamed of um and you know I don't know if the person that left me the note is listening but these these uh two chapters will Ex really explain everything to you if you could get this in your heart it it's it's very marvelous now just to jump ahead uh this is just a little study so I want to go to the fifth chapter and the 13th verse and this verse gives you the understanding of why that John wrote this letter and it says these things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the son of God that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the son of God so the motive on it was he wrote this so we would have a way to measure and to judge that we have eternal life there's all kinds of tests that you take you know I I have to go have my blood checked and they run this great big list of test and then they tell me you know that this is out of balance and that's out of balance and this is too high and this is too low and and you know when you get done reading the report you think you might as well go visit the Undertaker you know but I believe that that nothing's going to happen until God's done that that I know and so I just trust in that I do my best brother Bram said it was our obligation to do everything that we could in our power to to get our help and then the things that are beyond our control we place into his hands so this is a a test it seems that it is but it's a test of the spirit it's a way you can really test yourself and so let's just read it together and verse by verse and we'll talk and make comment uh it said beloved believe not every Spirit but try by the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world and so he's saying many New Testament preachers many people are out there preaching things and I'll tell the one identification of the Antichrist spirit is it divides it doesn't matter if it divides by culture it doesn't matter if it divides by economy it doesn't matter if it if it divides by color it doesn't matter what it does the spirit of antichrist is the spirit of division FL it's the spirit of what's against Christ that's what Antichrist means it's anti or against Christ so it's against what the Lord is trying to do because God's trying to do something he's trying to accomplish something he we read this morning that he wants to represent himself in you and he said anybody that accepts him and been been saved is it has a the portion of God in them they're they're they're part of God and God wants to represent himself in a certain way if somebody C comes in my name or for example I give a recommendation to somebody that this is a a good a mechanic or a good painter I I don't they're they're going in my name they're saying uh uh Mr McGary uh uh said that you needed some work done and I recommend them and then I go over there and there's paint drips up and down the driveway and they Park their van in the driveway and there's a big old oil spot and and you go in and and and you find out that that you know there's runs and streets in the wall and and you think I recommended this person you know it it uh uh that that's not representative of the kind of work that I do so now we're asking ourselves are we representative of the kind of work that he does because we are what his workmanship so we're testifying this is the work I'm right here is the work that God has done so that's what he's saying try every Spirit whether or not they're preaching and bringing us to the quality of workmanship that is in Christ Jesus he's done the work he did the work at Calvary he did the work in the upper room and he's still doing that work so we read that this morning that the spirit there's many spirits out there many people that can bring but stay with it and see what it produces does it produce a division and let me tell you something what once you've been born again and the spirit of God is in your heart if someone doesn't believe your doctrine that doesn't move you a bit that's not the quality that we're after we we our heart is is if God's given us a revelation we want them to have that revelation we want to share what God's done for us you know we we never want to be those that cast on Devils you know we're supposed to cast Devils off unbelief off but so let's just read this is beautiful I I hope you enjoy going through the word of God it meant a lot to me he says hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confess us that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God now I I hope you listen this morning because that's what he said he said they're not ashamed of being identified with him I'm a Baptist I'm a Methodist I'm a presbyterian I believe in Jesus but what they're ashamed of is that he manifests himself in the flesh so any spirit that denies that Jesus Christ the nature the personality the thinking let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus let everybody look upon the needs of the other above themselves if they don't confess that he personal pronoun Lives In the Flesh and manifests himself not in teachings I'm a Baptist I'm a presbyterian I'm a Methodist I'm a Hindu whatever but doesn't confess that he can live his nature out through human beings that's how you know the true spirit that that's how you know that's the judge that you know the spirit of God if it's the spirit of God you know that by is it Christ in the flesh not in the mind not in the teaching not in the doctrine but in the flesh in other words just someone smites you on the cheek your answer is you smot a Son of God you're going to hell May the fires of judgment rain down upon you no you know it's God if you turn the other cheek it it's manifested in the very way you think in the very way you respond brother brandom said this morning you can tell whe whether they're ashamed or not or they believe the word beh of how they exercise it exercise means to put into action it doesn't mean to go lift weights or read your Bible in your garage and talk about it it means to put it in the practice so now he these are the things he wants us to know because it proves to us we have eternal life he says confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not now confess you you don't just confess something with your mouth your confession is really in your actions because a guy that tells you he's really there to help you and he's got while you're sitting there talking to you he's lifting your wallet out of your pocket his confession is not true but his confession is the fact that he carries out what he's talking about so it's not what people think oh if you confess that the Lord's come in the flesh you're saved well that's true if you're confession is I'm proving to you by my life and by my actions that he's come now we know he's got room for growth in all of us and he does have us grow as we go through experiences but he wants us to be sure that we're sure of our eternal life because what causes people to be ashamed is when they are not sure it is is not of God and this is the spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world so the spirit of antichrist is the spirit that says the love of God is not shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Ghost that's the spirit of antichrist that Christ hasn't come in the flesh we know that Christ is come in the flesh when the spirit and the love of God is shed abroad in Us by the Holy Ghost I mean the Christianity is not Jesus Christ came 2,000 years ago in the flesh Christianity is Jesus Christ has come in this flesh because I've been redeemed by the blood of the lamb and I bear or I carry as he said this morning or I walk in the testimony of the Resurrection how do I testify that he's resurrected how would anybody know he's resurrected because he lives in me he walks with me he talks with me he it's evident he's alive because he's alive in me now his nature and his love John's going to get into it any that is not a part of that that causes division or hatred or anything is not of God that's right that's right and we're only interested in one thing we are members of another kingdom we are members of the kingdom of God we're ambassadors of the kingdom of God we are not trying to straighten out this world we are trying to leave this world and this is the way you leave this is the spirit you have to have in you to leave if the same spirit that dwelt in Christ Jesus dwell in you it will Quicken your mortal body so anything that's not representative of that spirit is Antichrist that's what John's saying here listen it's beautiful go home and read it he said is already is already come and is in the world ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world okay you've overcome those things and the Antichrist spirit because greater is he that is in you that's what he's talking about confessing that he's come in the flesh that greater is he oh I'm going to get excited and I told myself I'm not going to get excited but greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world that's what I'm confessing I'm confessing that there's somebody else that's in me he's birthed me he's born again he forgave me of my sins and he's come and he's living in me and forgive me when my flesh Rises up I don't mean that oh my so greater is he now they that are of the world now don't I want oh I I use that word I want because my vocabulary is not big enough to find another word but I'm going to try to look in the dictionary you know when it says my desire is to share with you or if I could say this to fellowship with you in God's word he says now they are of the world therefore speak they of the world oh my yes yeah oh that's what they speak about they speak about social injustice they speak about wages they speak about the environment they they speak about this they speak about that that's what they speak about why because they're of the world and if they're of the world they're concerned about the world save the whales you know God hasn't lost one whale every whale that he wants on the other side will be on the other side you think there'll be whales on the other side I do there's going to be a horse there I know about there's going to be a dog there I know about so I love whales there ought to be a whale there that over there too the carnal it is so amazing that people get wrapped up and that's what it is Republican Democrat uh independent libertarian blah blah blah blah blah all the social justice issues all the the things of the world all how that people have betrayed one another and enslaved one another but did you know I was a slave I was I was a slave to sin I was a slave to drugs I was a slave to lust I was a slave to hatred but praise God I'm no longer a slave to sin all men were in slavery all men were in bondage you can go back through time you know I mean if it wasn't too long ago they million they murdered millions of cambodians they had a an ethnic cleansing of everybody that had an IQ above two they killed the doctors that was kind of a remark I guess nobody knows what a good IQ score is you know I think mine's about 178 so hey I think I'm smarter than 99% of the people in the world yeah because they don't accept God's word and if I can see the message and I accept God in my eyes that makes me pretty smart that's right you know cuz Einstein won't be there unless God realizes all right and and and so there's been a lot of things down through the they starved the Irish at one time when the Irish first came to this country they couldn't get work they were dogs spit upon and and and couldn't go into restaurants and couldn't eat they they they were forced into housing that was so wretched and so poor and kept in a certain part of of the city and stuff no they fought their way out but those are things of the world little children ye are not of the world ye are of God and so it says they that are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them that's why they're marching the world heareth them they speak of the world and the World heareth them we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God heareth us not hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of air now what will the spirit of Truth do it'll set you free from the things the world talks about right the reason some people are in the world and talking of the world is because they haven't been born again and and they see the hatred they see the social unjustice they see the starving they see these great problems that we have and they keep talking about them but John's going to share with us what the answer is he said now we know the spirit of Truth and air beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God God and knoweth God that's how we know what the spirit of Truth is and the spirit of air a man that walks in the truth loveth his brother that's right he loves all the children of God well tonight when the brother sang I I I was hearing English of course I knew the song but it was still wonderful to enter into fellowship and hear the words and unless he was singing a different song to the same tune but but you you see what we have to move into we have to move into the Capstone because God is love this this this is what he's going to cap his church about that love that repres if God so loved the world he sent his only begotten son so now we're moving into the Capstone Lord is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love so this is how he's going to identify us whether or not we followed him do are we following if we're going to follow him we have to follow him in the love wherein he loved us that's what we have to have that's what we have to possess is a love for our brother Rich poor whether they eat hot chilies or or they make something that's so hot it burns you alive you love them you don't care about their culture you don't care about their diet you don't care about where they come from that's right you love them you love them am I'll tell you the difference the love in a Christian makes them act uh a a a political or social issue makes you talk and that's how they're identified because they talk about the world and the world here a Christians borned of love and does the works of love and manifest the love of God here in is the love of God manifested that's what Jesus taught don't see don't don't see somebody that's hungry and go out and say oh it's so terrible people are hungry feed them if they're not clothed clothe them do what you can to manifest the love of God and then says so it's just beautiful let's just read I think you'll love it I love it he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love for for in this was manifested the love of God towards us this is the manifestation of the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him may I make put that in another terminology that we might live by him or that our life might come from him the only begotten son hearing is love not that we love God herein is love not that we love God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the perpetuation of our sins beloved if God so loved us we ought to love one another amen there now now we're talking about the spirit of truth and the spirit of air the spirit of truth knows God right it it loves God that that's the spirit of Truth this is how we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of air this is how we know the spirit of antichrist because remember anybody that rejects the spirit of God gets the mark of the beast so the men it that the spirit fell that put the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost the Antichrist Spirit fell the divide and talk about worldly things and all these political issues and social issues and economic issues that's the spirit but the spirit of God talks about God it loves God it shares God it shares the truth because that is the truth no man hath seen God at any time if we love one another God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in US you say what's God perfecting in us we all want to be more perfect what is the word perfecting what is God perfecting what is the church that we become mental Giants or love Giants right amen you know the scripture there's so many goodt scripture he says that that his love is perfected in US hereby know we that we dwell in him and him in us because he hath given us his Spirit okay what was his spirit that he laid his life down for us that he forgave us of our sins he bore our trespasses when he came across the people and he saw that they had no food he had compassion on them he went the extra mile when he meant a a a a a a woman that lost her livelihood because her son had passed away he raised them up let this mind be that was in Christ be in you that every person looks upon the need of others you know we want to always judge whether we have the spirit by some sort of manifestation but this is how you know you have the spirit if you have the spirit of God you you love your brother because that was what he was he said and and hereby we know that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us his spirit and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world wherefore who whoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in him and he in God and we have known and believed the love that God hath to us that's it do you know the love that God has has toward you this is what John saying that we may know that we possess eternal life that we can get the question answered once and for all whether we have the spirit or not whether we have life or not we have it because we know that he loveth us and and hereby whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in him and he in God and we know and believe the love that God have to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him that's what we're preaching that's what I was preaching this morning that's what I was talking about being getting carried away in something of the world because if you're born of God the love of God is in you that's your identification you don't have no hatred for nobody you have one thing in mind the only thing that matters to you is that that person you love possesses eternal life that's the life that means more to you than anything else here in is our love made perfect now what is he trying to do he already spoke up here earlier that that God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us now how are we going to know that that love is perfect he says herein is is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world you know I I I preach a sermon on being ashamed and someone writes me a note and they don't put their name on it I thought are they ashamed if they have the truth you're not ashamed of the truth you're not ashamed to come and put your name to what you believe and what you stand for that's right you're not ashamed be be identified you know I mean if if you don't feel my tie matches my suit and you want to tell me that put your name on it right don't leave me sitting here wondering that it's 300 people that that think my tie don't matter hatch if you don't think my time match is my suit if you're a Christian you'll go out and buy me one that does and if you don't have the money you will come to me and say brother mcgar I if I had the money I would get you a tie that matches that too but I'd really like to do that for you I'd be happy to give you the Mone I I'm just talking about are we ashamed that we can't put our name on our thoughts that if if we feel somebody's in air that that we won't share it with them or if you have something a word of advice you know uh the wonderful word of advice I received I'd like to thank you for it you know now I think I owe all of you so thank you all but here in Is This Love perfected that as he is so are we in the world there is no fear in love but perfect love cast out fear because fear hath torment he that fearth is not made perfect in love if you're still been out of shape over the world way the world treated you the way your teachers treated you the all the complexes you've had all the job JS that you couldn't get if you're still been out of all shape out of all those things I want to tell you as a brother I want to tell you as someone who's had the love of God expressed to him through the Forgiveness of sins that your love's not made perfect yet if things of this world still eat you up then you're not sure you're going to heaven let me tell you God is not going to waste his time fixing a world that he's going to [Music] destroy he's calling people out of this world and that's what he said this morning is when the calling out time comes to say that you're not a part of any of it Are you ashamed of that I'm not a part of it that's right I'm not a part of any social movement I'm not a part uh of any political party I'm not a part of any economical growth I'm not a part of it almost every dime I have is invested in this body of Believers but I'm filthy rich on the other side Hallelujah I got streets of gold I've got purly Gates no man layeth his treasures in this world but he put his treasures where the thief can't come in and take them who's the th the devil that robs you of your peace that robs you of your joy that robs you of your victory that robs you of your confidence that puts complexes on you fooy with that guy I'm tired of him man if you see him anywhere near me come tell me please cuz he sneaks up like a cat I can't do a cat as good as Jeff can do a horse let me know you know I wouldn't say that if I'm not getting to it in a minute it's right here in this books he that fearth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if any man say I love God and hateth his brother he is a liar any man that's got an ounce of bigotry an ounce of hatred an ounce of any of that doesn't know God and the love of God's Not in him you know if if we want to get rid of hatred and bias and bigotry out of the world lead somebody to the fountain that the love of God's in their heart because if they have any of those things they know not God and you're just barking down around [Applause] Trail as long as there's a devil there's hatred as long as there's a devil there's lying as long as there's a devil there's there's there's stealing because the fruit of the flesh are those things but where God is there's peace where the spirit of God is there's joy where the spirit of God is there's life and Liberty in Christ Jesus oh people don't serve the world or the leader of this world don't buy into his philosophies don't buy into those things the best thing you can do for any man in this whole world is introduce them to the Savior you're giving them freedom and liberty they're proud of their experience they're not ashamed of what God's done for them any believer that's been bought by the cross that's had their price paid for them they know what God's biding if you meet anybody I don't care what their denomination is where they come from if they know that love of God I'll tell you you'll wrap your arms around him and say isn't he wonderful get all these complexes there's not Bond or free male or free female but we are christs and he is God I'll tell you someone that's caught in that needs to be born again any man say I love God and hateth his brother he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love God whom he hath not seen hate and love don't abide together the Bible teaches us these two things don't abide together either it's him that lives in you or it's somebody else that lives in you remember God doesn't give options this fifth chapter whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God now what does that mean he that believeth see we have such a carnal thing that we keep looking back in history that Jesus is the Christ that means that Jesus is the anointing Spirit yes that that's the spirit that is anointing me that is the spirit that makes me think that is the spirit that makes me do that is the spirit amen that who that Jesus is the Christ is the right anointing is born of God and everyone that loves him that begot loveth him also that is begotten of him you know what beget or begotten means it means to produce everyone that loves him produces him and everyone that produces him has been produced of him in other words that's what our testimony is the testimony of the Resurrection The testimony of the Lord is the life that's in us has been produced by God that's the only life we stand for that's the only life we preach that's the only hope we have the only hope we have is the spirit of God that's been begotten in us oh my church we don't get sucked away is there a Christian Republican I don't think so is there a Christian Democrat I don't think so because a good soldier doesn't entangleth his things in the Affairs of the world that's not what we talk now I say vote your conscience that's fine whatever you think is best for you and for the country but that's not what we share we share him and him alone so those that are produced of God by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments wouldn't that be a sermon just going down through all the things Jesus taught us to do to feed the sick to visit the Father the visit the wi the the homeless the fatherless to visit the widows in their afflictions for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his commandment ments are not Grievous for whosoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the son of God this is he that o this is he that came by water and blood even Jesus Christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is true you want to know what's true you want to know what's right you want to know what's good you want to know what's holy get the spirit of God because that spirit's going to make you love your brother it's going to make you love your sister it's that's going to make you love them no matter where they're from or how rich they are or how poor they are or how smart they are I think some of the dumbest people in the world's got the best love of God I hope you put me in the category of some of the dumbest people in the world because I want to be dumb to the world because the scripture says to the world it's foolishness the wisdom of the world is foolishness to God and the wisdom of God is foolishness to the world this is what we're striving for church it says this is the spirit of Truth This Love that he's talking about that's the spirit of truth that is truth for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one in other words the father bore record of the word and the word bore record of the spirit they're one that's the record this is the record that's in order that these three are one not three different persons but one great witness and there are three that bear witness in Earth the spirit the water and the blood and these three agree in one if we receive if we receive the witness of men the witness of God is greater for this is the witness of God which hath testified of his son he that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness of him he that believeth not God hath made him a liar because we believeth not the record that God gave his son what was the record that God God gave his son that he so loved the world world that he gave his only produced son that's the only son he ever gave to die oh the only begotten of the father he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son Son of God hath not life these things I have written unto you that believe on the name of the son of God that ye may know assuredly without a doubt with with no reservation that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on in the name of the son of God and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he heareth us whosoever we ask we know that we have the petition that we desire of him not if we know he's heard us we know we haven't If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sinth not unto death there is a sin unto death and I do not say that we shall pray for it but all unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin unto death and a sin there there is a sin not unto death and you know that's we've been taught that if you see your brother in a fault you pray for him your very prayer might deliver him of that fault when you see your brothers in eror you go to that brother and you love that brother now there are sins unto death in other words confessing that the son of man has not come and that the spirit of God is be elub there's no forgiveness in this sin or the life to come when you see somebody doing that denying the truth and turning down the word of God you don't even pray for that person they've made their choice but the our fleshly sins we pray one for another we uplift one another we know that whosoever is born of God sinth not but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself and that Wicked one toucheth him not and we know that we are of God and the whole world lith in wickedness there's that word to me has two meanings in that the whole world lith it's a liar but it also the word means lith means prolonged stay it has a prolonged stay in wickedness you know when a a Christian if he makes a mistake or he unbeliev or he have sin he's quick to cry ABA father he doesn't lay there he doesn't stay in that prolonged condition he quickly makes it right but the world lies it doesn't tell the truth it doesn't have the love of God here in we know the spirit of error and the spirit of truth but it it has a prolonged stay in wickedness and we know that the Son of God is come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is truth and we are in him that is truth even in his son Jesus Christ this is the truth God and eternal life this is the true God the true life little children keep yourselves from Idols amen this is the spirit that each one of us needs to have no big eyes no little Jews an equal care one for another a love one for another undying spirit of God moving in our hearts towards all men here in they'll know that ye are my disciples when you love one another I want that love perfected in me and I'll know that love is perfect when as he is so am I and I hope that that that's our goal and I hope that's not what we're ashamed of we're not ashamed to have the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost God bless you brother Billy if you would come maybe if we would stand together I certainly can use more love and if I haven't had that love the way that I should then would you pray for me CU I hope it's not a sin unto death and would you pray that the love of God would be perfected in me because that's my heart's desire that we love one another even as he hath loved us and if you know your love if you've ever experienced it you know it it don't matter there's a lot of hatred in the land but if you know you're sealed in him you have pity because you know they don't know the father and they don't know God and try every Spirit whether it loves God whether it knows God whether it has the love of Jesus Christ shed abroad in its heart by the Holy Ghost that's how we measure our Salvation is by the love that's reflected in us can you love them that despise you that's the measure yes of Christianity can you turn your cheek to them that Smite you and call you names and are full of hatred that's the Perfection that he desires that we're not ashamed of I'm not ashamed to be anointed by Jesus Christ because it's the power of God un salvation I'm not ashamed to be identified with him and his lifestyle and the things that he does because I know that here in is the love of God that we know the love of God that He gave His only begotten son and that's my testimony as wicked and as mean and as cruel as this world is I can lift my hands and say praise praise God I'm saved from him he lives and because he lives we live also amen let's bow our heads our heavenly father Lord you haven't given me the whole world to Pastor I don't have a message for the world Lord but you've given me a flock here Lord and I don't want them to be church members I want them to be bride members in a love affair with you and Lord all that we can do is desire that the love of God is made perfect in this body and that this body has no malice no Envy no Strife no hatred no variances because those things are the fruits of the flesh but love peace patience long suffering gentleness [Music] kindness those are the fruits and the evidence that your spirit is here Lord I may not know many things that people go through but I know the answer to everything that man goes through and that answer is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever living in us I ask you to bless us father may we go back to these chapters in John and measure ourselves because these are the things that he wrote that we might know that we have eternal life and that we might know the spirit of truth and the spirit of air amen and that father that's my heart tonight that's my sermon the spirit of truth and the spirit of air for the spirit is truth we ask
