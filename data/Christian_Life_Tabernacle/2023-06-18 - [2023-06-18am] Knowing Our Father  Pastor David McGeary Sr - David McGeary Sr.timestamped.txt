[22:49] that's what we're thankful for this
[22:51] morning
[22:52] amen
[22:54] we're going to read uh
[22:56] out of Psalm 68 this morning
[23:01] it's applicable uh
[23:07] thank you
[23:07] [Applause]
[23:09] I wanna
[23:13] just exhort you and remind you this
[23:14] morning you know we saved the course
[23:18] forget about yourself concentrate on him
[23:21] and worship him
[23:23] sometimes it's hard to do we
[23:25] we rush about
[23:27] we work during the week
[23:30] we set aside things and say well I want
[23:33] to get to church on time and things
[23:38] always come up
[23:42] whether it be traffic or
[23:46] you know the sink won't turn off
[23:47] whatever it is
[23:49] uh we try to rush rush rush we try to
[23:51] put on our best clothes and we look in
[23:53] the mirror and make sure we've got
[23:54] everything just right the ties straight
[23:56] the the barrettes in the right place all
[23:58] these things
[24:04] we can lay all that aside
[24:08] just forget about yourself
[24:11] concentrate on him and worship him
[24:14] and we
[24:16] I believe there's a true beauty of
[24:18] holiness
[24:19] we can look around and say my
[24:21] I appreciate being in this congregation
[24:23] more than anywhere I'm at during the
[24:25] week there's not a place we'd rather be
[24:28] in the right here with
[24:30] with the majority of whom we're going to
[24:32] spend eternity with just think of that
[24:34] if you can't get along with people next
[24:35] to you here
[24:37] are you worthy of that place
[24:42] the Lord has Provisions I tell you we uh
[24:47] we're blessed
[24:50] in that we're at the very end of time
[24:52] when God is completely revealed himself
[24:58] I was reading in Exodus chapter 6.
[25:03] God spoke to Moses
[25:09] and said unto him I am the Lord
[25:12] my Bible says that's Jehovah
[25:17] he said I had appeared under Abraham
[25:19] Isaac and Jacob
[25:22] by the name of God almighty
[25:26] but by my name Jehovah was I not known
[25:28] to them
[25:31] he had things in store for Moses and the
[25:34] people that were in Egypt at that time
[25:38] became Jehovah to them
[25:41] what is God to you today
[25:44] what has he delivered you from he said I
[25:47] am he's a current God ever present help
[25:51] in the time of need whatever you have
[25:53] need of this morning he's here he's able
[25:55] to provide we just lay aside everything
[25:58] enter into a special place of worship
[26:01] where it's you and him
[26:03] and he's Duty Bound by his word
[26:06] to be here and to meet that need I fully
[26:09] believe that and the Bible says you were
[26:12] some you were Darkness
[26:15] not in darkness ye were Darkness and
[26:19] Light came and and light always
[26:21] manifests
[26:24] okay you can't hide from light it
[26:26] manifests all things
[26:29] amen so let's uh let's just stand
[26:35] we're going to read through the 19th
[26:37] verse
[26:39] you know and I I studied that Jehovah if
[26:43] you look in the uh the fourth verse
[26:47] says extold him that rideth upon the
[26:49] heavens by his name Jah
[26:51] j a h
[26:53] you know the strong concordance says
[26:55] that's a shortened version of Jehovah
[26:58] and but it's Hebrew and it goes back to
[27:01] the uh
[27:03] they call it a tetragrammatin I think is
[27:06] the uh the acronym j h w h which became
[27:11] Yahweh
[27:12] uh is God it's Jehovah God
[27:16] and I'm thankful
[27:18] he said there remaineth the rest for the
[27:21] people of God
[27:22] before the gospel was preached they
[27:24] didn't enter into rest because they
[27:26] mixed it with unbelief
[27:27] we don't want to have that unbelief this
[27:29] morning we want to enter into his rest
[27:30] we're here
[27:32] gather together on the Sabbath
[27:36] and that Sabbath was a type of rest
[27:39] it's not a holy day that we keep out of
[27:41] tradition it's his rest we come in here
[27:44] let's lay aside everything and rest
[27:47] rest on God's word amen to have his
[27:50] provision
[27:51] amen and we look uh
[27:55] let's see somewhere down here
[27:58] the Psalms 10 also
[28:00] speaks of fathers and he says that he's
[28:03] a friend of the fatherless
[28:07] we're going to read in here
[28:09] uh
[28:11] in verse 5 it says he's a father of the
[28:13] fatherless
[28:14] and the judge of the widows is God in
[28:17] his holy habitation and I like this
[28:19] verse God setteth the solitary in
[28:22] families
[28:24] you know you can claim to be a loner
[28:27] but you're not going to go by yourself
[28:28] there's a family of God and I'm glad I'm
[28:31] part of it let's just read together
[28:33] through the 19th verse Psalm 68 blessed
[28:36] be the name of the Lord
[28:39] let God arise let his enemies be
[28:42] scattered let them also that hate him
[28:44] flee before him as smoke is driven away
[28:47] so drive them away as wax melteth before
[28:51] the fire so let the wicked perish at the
[28:54] presence of God but let the righteous be
[28:57] glad let them Rejoice before God yea let
[29:00] them exceedingly Rejoice amen sing unto
[29:03] God sing praises to his name extol him
[29:06] that wideth upon the heavens by his name
[29:09] job and rejoice before him a father of
[29:12] the fatherless and a judge of the widows
[29:15] is God in his holy habitation God said
[29:18] at the solitarian families he bringeth
[29:21] out those which are bound with chains
[29:23] but the rebellious dwell in the dry land
[29:25] oh God when thou wentest forth before
[29:28] thy people when thou didst March through
[29:31] the Wilderness Selah the Earth shook the
[29:34] heavens also dropped at the presence of
[29:36] God even Sinai itself was moved at the
[29:39] presence of God the god of Israel thou o
[29:42] God did Ascend the plentiful rain
[29:44] whereby thou didst confirm thine
[29:46] inheritance when it was weary thy
[29:49] congregation hath dwelt therein thou o
[29:52] God has prepared of thy goodness for the
[29:54] poor the lord gave the word great was
[29:57] the company of those that published it
[29:59] Kings of armies did flee a pace and she
[30:02] that teared at home divided the spoil
[30:04] though ye have leaned among the pots yet
[30:07] shall ye be as the wings of a dove
[30:09] covered with silver and are feathers
[30:11] with yellow gold when the almighty
[30:14] scattered Kings in it it was white as
[30:16] snow and sound the hill of God is as the
[30:19] hill of Bashan a hill as high as a hill
[30:22] of beisham while leap year high hills
[30:25] this is the hill which God desire to
[30:27] dwell in yea the Lord will dwell in it
[30:30] forever the Chariots of God are twenty
[30:33] thousand even thousands of Angels the
[30:36] Lord is among them as in Sinai in the
[30:38] Holy Place thou has ascended on high
[30:41] thou has led captivity captive thou has
[30:44] received gifts for men yea for the
[30:47] rebellious also that the Lord God might

[50:45] we have we have the heavenly father our
[50:48] words cannot can never be able to
[50:50] comprehend that we her brother was
[50:53] saying the darkness was there but when
[50:55] the light came the darkness comprehended
[50:58] not it is the darkness is powerless when

[1:09:27] today
[1:09:29] Lord but we honor the father of all
[1:09:32] things
[1:09:33] and we ask you to bless us this morning
[1:09:35] in Jesus precious name we pray
[1:09:40] amen God bless you if you have your
[1:09:42] Bibles this morning Happy Father's Day
[1:09:45] to all the fathers
[1:09:48] um
[1:09:51] so we're we're always grateful for that
[1:09:54] good things that God does for us we want
[1:09:57] to turn to first John
[1:10:01] in our scripture reading this morning
[1:10:04] just the first few verses of First John
[1:10:08] and anyway we'll try to read there
[1:10:17] first John 1 and 1.
[1:10:21] first John 1 and 1.
[1:10:28] it says that which was from the
[1:10:30] beginning which we have heard which we
[1:10:34] have seen with our eyes
[1:10:37] which we have looked upon and our hands
[1:10:41] have handled the word of life for the
[1:10:45] life was was manifested and we have seen
[1:10:49] it
[1:10:50] and bear Witness
[1:10:52] and show unto you that eternal life
[1:10:56] which was in the father
[1:10:59] and was manifest unto us
[1:11:03] that which we have seen and heard
[1:11:06] declare we unto you
[1:11:09] that ye Also may have fellowship with us
[1:11:14] and truly our fellowship is with the
[1:11:18] father
[1:11:19] and with his son Jesus Christ and these
[1:11:24] things right we unto you that your joy
[1:11:29] might be full Heavenly Father we ask you
[1:11:33] to bless your word test this morning in
[1:11:36] Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless
[1:11:40] you
[1:11:48] you know I was thinking this morning you
[1:11:50] know that
[1:11:51] uh Father's Day really
[1:11:55] doesn't get the recognition that
[1:11:57] Mother's Day gets
[1:12:00] and uh but but that's okay you know our
[1:12:04] our mothers are kind of stuck with us
[1:12:07] and the hard Parts uh I'm not saying
[1:12:11] this to my credit I'm saying this to my
[1:12:13] shame but I didn't change very many
[1:12:16] diapers so
[1:12:18] um you know but Mom's always there you
[1:12:22] know what I mean but you know I I was
[1:12:24] also thinking about the difference how
[1:12:27] things change over time you know when we
[1:12:31] had Mother's Day it used to be tradition
[1:12:35] in our family that we always served
[1:12:37] mother breakfast in bed
[1:12:40] and uh I just were thinking on that
[1:12:43] today and I thought man she must have
[1:12:46] dreaded that because you know we bring
[1:12:49] in all the crumbs and everything and put
[1:12:52] the tray up in front of her and she
[1:12:54] would have to eat all that food that we
[1:12:57] ruined and she but she just sat there
[1:13:00] grinning and thanking the lord and
[1:13:03] everything and I I just thought on those
[1:13:06] things this morning how grateful I am
[1:13:09] Leslie's flown out to San Diego to
[1:13:13] take my mom back to Michigan to where
[1:13:15] she grew up and
[1:13:17] and to be out there and
[1:13:20] just kind of completing that great cycle
[1:13:24] of life and uh
[1:13:26] you know you realize that
[1:13:28] any day now that she could be taken from
[1:13:33] me you know
[1:13:35] maybe even while she's there
[1:13:38] and so I'm going to fly out next weekend
[1:13:41] to be with my mom
[1:13:43] up there with my cousins who I haven't
[1:13:46] seen very much and with my mom make sure
[1:13:50] she's good
[1:13:51] she has everything she needs and you
[1:13:55] know
[1:13:57] I often think about what
[1:14:00] brother Billy Paul told me one time and
[1:14:04] he said you know
[1:14:06] my dad called his mother every day
[1:14:10] and and I said wow that's wonderful and
[1:14:13] he said he said but you know he told me
[1:14:16] he said I should have gone seen her
[1:14:19] and you know some of those things just
[1:14:22] cut you sometimes because you don't you
[1:14:25] realize that you don't really give the
[1:14:27] honor and respect
[1:14:30] and you know one of The Commandments of
[1:14:32] God is to honor your father and your
[1:14:36] mother and there's a blessing that goes
[1:14:39] with that
[1:14:40] and the blessing that goes with that's a
[1:14:42] long life
[1:14:44] um
[1:14:46] you know I I feel sorry for
[1:14:49] many people they've they don't have
[1:14:52] fathers I mean they have fathers but
[1:14:55] they don't have fathers you know
[1:14:57] and you know the father
[1:15:00] is
[1:15:02] that definition
[1:15:05] covers uh
[1:15:07] a wide range of items
[1:15:12] and for so when we speak of a father
[1:15:16] naturally
[1:15:18] what our first thought is as one who
[1:15:21] procreates life
[1:15:23] or causes birth
[1:15:25] but the father goes the definition goes
[1:15:29] well beyond that
[1:15:31] it some of the definitions read like
[1:15:34] this I like some of these it's it's the
[1:15:37] original cause of
[1:15:40] so the if you are the father you're the
[1:15:44] original
[1:15:45] cause of
[1:15:47] so that's the father that we want to
[1:15:50] talk about this morning the one that was
[1:15:53] in the beginning in the beginning was
[1:15:56] the father
[1:15:57] I amen it means the original cause of
[1:16:01] the founder
[1:16:04] or the producer
[1:16:06] the author of
[1:16:08] uh uh so those are those are
[1:16:12] terminologies we use for the father we
[1:16:15] say the father of our country is George
[1:16:19] Washington I think they say I'm not sure
[1:16:22] on this but I think they say Thomas
[1:16:25] Edison the father of electricity or
[1:16:27] maybe Benjamin Franklin I don't know but
[1:16:30] but we call these people the the father
[1:16:33] of the railroad the father of this the
[1:16:36] father of this team engine you know I
[1:16:39] guess singer was the father of the
[1:16:41] sewing machine
[1:16:43] but he he's the original
[1:16:45] founder and we bestow honor on uh the uh
[1:16:53] a person that's a father or a founder
[1:16:58] and uh we we give them a a form of
[1:17:03] recognition maybe a plaque or uh
[1:17:07] something of of that but there's another
[1:17:10] uh meaning of father that I think is
[1:17:14] even greater
[1:17:16] than the one that found something
[1:17:18] because you can found something and
[1:17:21] abandon it
[1:17:23] you you understand you can start
[1:17:26] something and and and and then abandon
[1:17:30] it or have a change of heart
[1:17:32] our country today is cursed
[1:17:36] with so many single parents
[1:17:39] and
[1:17:41] and uh
[1:17:43] and uh and it comes from weak homes you
[1:17:47] know
[1:17:48] people and parents not sitting down with
[1:17:52] their children especially their young
[1:17:54] daughters and
[1:17:55] and expressing them the importance of
[1:17:59] keeping themselves and and tell they
[1:18:03] have marriage
[1:18:04] and you have so many fatherless
[1:18:09] children they have a father
[1:18:12] but they don't have a father in
[1:18:15] this form of the definition that we want
[1:18:19] to emphasize this morning they don't
[1:18:22] have a father that accepts
[1:18:24] responsibility
[1:18:26] so we're talking about a father the the
[1:18:29] attribute of a father
[1:18:32] is one that accepts responsibility and
[1:18:38] uh or if I could say it that or takes
[1:18:42] care of or raises something that they're
[1:18:46] going to Father it they're going to uh
[1:18:49] tutor it and teach it and Mentor it and
[1:18:55] guide it that's that's the kind of
[1:18:57] fatherhood that you have many people
[1:19:01] have had a their natural father but
[1:19:04] somebody else stepped up and took the
[1:19:08] the act of fatherhood
[1:19:11] and they should receive just as much
[1:19:14] honor maybe even
[1:19:16] uh more so maybe through life
[1:19:19] circumstances uh you were in that
[1:19:23] situation where you had a stepfather or
[1:19:27] maybe your father had passed on or maybe
[1:19:31] there was a divorce uh early in your
[1:19:34] childhood and you didn't uh
[1:19:39] you didn't have
[1:19:41] uh
[1:19:42] a father and maybe somebody came along
[1:19:45] and and
[1:19:47] of a venture mom and they stepped into
[1:19:51] that responsibility and you know this
[1:19:54] this is the world we live in today
[1:19:57] that's the reality of it we have many
[1:20:01] circumstances and many situations today
[1:20:04] that are are very difficult and we have
[1:20:09] to navigate through them and people come
[1:20:12] and and
[1:20:14] with all kinds of great uh things that
[1:20:19] have transpired but uh the this father
[1:20:25] in the natural may have stepped up into
[1:20:28] your life or or your circumstances and
[1:20:33] took care of you and took responsibility
[1:20:35] and and raised you and and and to me
[1:20:39] that's a great thing
[1:20:41] I honor that I I respect it I I hold it
[1:20:46] dear in my heart
[1:20:48] anybody's cool uh Mentor or father uh
[1:20:55] a lot of even times in communities and
[1:20:57] neighborhoods uh there might be a child
[1:21:01] in the neighborhood and maybe one of the
[1:21:03] neighbors just takes that kid under its
[1:21:06] arm and and talks a little bit about to
[1:21:09] them and maybe share some fishing or
[1:21:12] hunting stories or give them a little
[1:21:14] pocket knife to whittle or something
[1:21:16] somebody that expresses care or wants to
[1:21:20] teach somebody something who wants to
[1:21:23] Mentor somebody train somebody has that
[1:21:27] kind of love
[1:21:29] that goes out that great fatherly love
[1:21:32] that great attribute of God act and I
[1:21:37] love that when I see that attribute come
[1:21:39] through human beings because we're
[1:21:41] getting into such a Godless Society in
[1:21:44] such a time that people don't care for
[1:21:47] one another they don't they don't they
[1:21:50] don't take thought of the effect that
[1:21:54] their actions
[1:21:55] okay I have and the influence that their
[1:21:59] actions has
[1:22:01] uh bullying sometimes is what spoke a
[1:22:05] lot in school and and I guess they have
[1:22:09] nowadays they call an internet bullying
[1:22:12] where they can put chats out there and
[1:22:15] Echo whatsapps and that's apps and back
[1:22:19] saps and all kinds of zaps and apps
[1:22:22] about out there and and that can
[1:22:24] actually say things about people and
[1:22:27] they don't realize in the influence that
[1:22:30] they're having the hurtful things that
[1:22:33] are are are being said and so there's a
[1:22:37] great influence and I I appreciate
[1:22:40] anybody that takes the time to have
[1:22:42] positive influence
[1:22:45] you know just to stop by a child or so
[1:22:48] maybe and just say some nice thing to
[1:22:51] them you know how are you today or boy
[1:22:54] that's a good job or or something like
[1:22:57] that something that has a fountain of
[1:23:00] love that flows from it that's an
[1:23:03] expression of goodness and an expression
[1:23:05] of kindness something that'll help
[1:23:08] somebody along the way so many times I
[1:23:11] heard our Messengers say I just want to
[1:23:13] say or do something to help somebody
[1:23:15] along the way
[1:23:18] to be conscious of that and I think it's
[1:23:21] important that all of us even I I say
[1:23:25] this in a way to we would say to our
[1:23:30] sisters the attribute of motherhood
[1:23:33] which really fatherhood and motherhood
[1:23:37] are really the same thing
[1:23:40] but they just come from a different
[1:23:42] Source in a different part
[1:23:44] but they all play a role of influencing
[1:23:50] and
[1:23:51] and
[1:23:53] having an effect so the real father and
[1:23:59] motherhood that we're talking about is
[1:24:02] something that proceeds from somebody
[1:24:04] that goes out from somebody that they
[1:24:07] they're giving of themselves and so they
[1:24:10] accept responsibility
[1:24:14] and those are going to care for somebody
[1:24:17] they're going to raise and tutor and do
[1:24:21] those great things and
[1:24:24] uh when you you see that you you
[1:24:28] understand that
[1:24:30] as a Christian
[1:24:32] that's what we're joined to
[1:24:35] we're joined to our father as John says
[1:24:39] our True Fellowship is with the father
[1:24:43] is with the father
[1:24:45] and
[1:24:48] I I reflected back
[1:24:51] um
[1:24:52] maybe this would be a little personal
[1:24:54] this morning I mean not try to be long
[1:24:56] but
[1:24:58] I
[1:25:00] I was thinking back today
[1:25:04] about my father
[1:25:08] my
[1:25:09] Earthly father
[1:25:12] and maybe you can join in me in this uh
[1:25:17] maybe you can't I don't know
[1:25:21] but
[1:25:24] I realized how little I really knew
[1:25:28] about my father
[1:25:31] you know how really I I how little I
[1:25:35] really knew
[1:25:37] what that he went through
[1:25:41] the things that he experienced
[1:25:45] okay how he felt
[1:25:48] uh
[1:25:51] and you've got to understand that
[1:25:54] here's a person
[1:25:56] that's going to influence my life
[1:26:01] that's going to talk to me that where he
[1:26:03] takes me
[1:26:05] are going to be the things that I eat
[1:26:08] and the things that I like
[1:26:11] the things that he uh
[1:26:14] that he his viewpoints
[1:26:18] are going to be the viewpoints that he
[1:26:21] passes on to me
[1:26:23] if you were born in a certain home maybe
[1:26:26] of a certain political persuasion it's
[1:26:30] probably pretty certain that you come up
[1:26:33] in that persuasion
[1:26:35] if you're born in a religious persuasion
[1:26:40] it pretty much of an opportunity you'll
[1:26:44] come up in that religious persuasion if
[1:26:47] you were born in a Jewish Home and and
[1:26:50] you were raised that way and you prayed
[1:26:53] that way and you ate that way and and
[1:26:55] you were served that way that became
[1:26:58] your life if you were being influenced
[1:27:01] by the the founder of that in your life
[1:27:05] what what the original source of
[1:27:09] influence was to you and it molded you
[1:27:13] and it shaped you and it made you what
[1:27:16] you are
[1:27:18] and uh
[1:27:20] and I I I I sat there I thought you know
[1:27:24] hear my father uh had so much influence
[1:27:28] on my life but I wondered what made him
[1:27:33] and I remember I got glimpses my mom
[1:27:37] would begin to start to share it to me
[1:27:39] about my father and give me glimpses
[1:27:41] that my my father uh
[1:27:47] um
[1:27:49] parents separated at a young age
[1:27:54] and he was raised
[1:27:57] basically raised himself
[1:28:00] you know
[1:28:02] and
[1:28:04] he had to make himself
[1:28:07] he had to struggle you know I didn't
[1:28:10] know what those struggles were
[1:28:13] you know yeah he he didn't have a lot of
[1:28:17] clothes and a lot of shoes
[1:28:21] and a lot of those things and all those
[1:28:23] things had had a very tremendous effect
[1:28:27] on on what made him not being raised
[1:28:31] with the mom he had a dog
[1:28:34] that uh
[1:28:37] that was like his best pal you know that
[1:28:40] waited for him at school and and all
[1:28:43] those things as a kid that that raised
[1:28:48] up and and uh
[1:28:51] and so as I I thought about it and I I
[1:28:54] thought through it and I was thinking
[1:28:57] you know uh what
[1:29:00] how how little
[1:29:02] I really knew about him
[1:29:05] i i as growing up I I know that my my
[1:29:09] father and he uh
[1:29:13] he put himself through school graduated
[1:29:17] from school he was played football and
[1:29:20] and Lacrosse I guess and and
[1:29:25] put all those things for school and
[1:29:27] signed up for the Navy and I was working
[1:29:31] you know getting a job and doing to all
[1:29:36] those things and I just had these
[1:29:38] glimpses I know him as
[1:29:41] a person
[1:29:44] you don't understand that I called Dad
[1:29:47] that raised me and worked and and uh uh
[1:29:52] took me to work and because of the way
[1:29:55] that my dad was that he had to work and
[1:29:58] he had to labor and and he had uh do all
[1:30:02] the things that that he did that that
[1:30:05] would have an influence in an effect on
[1:30:08] me
[1:30:09] it's going to make my personality it's
[1:30:12] going to mold me and I I'm getting to
[1:30:16] something as I'm talking about my dad
[1:30:19] and each of you have yours or or some
[1:30:23] form of influence
[1:30:25] in your life
[1:30:27] but uh I remember my dad became a school
[1:30:32] teacher now I didn't know him as a
[1:30:35] school teacher I mean he was teaching
[1:30:37] school
[1:30:38] when I was born
[1:30:41] and he was a
[1:30:43] a
[1:30:46] man that was given to
[1:30:49] um
[1:30:51] human Justice and humans right causes
[1:30:55] I guess in a way that you might call
[1:30:58] them today he he had a form of activism
[1:31:02] about him and as a as a
[1:31:06] school teacher he saw a lot of
[1:31:10] injustices
[1:31:12] uh in the labor force and things of
[1:31:16] those things so my father founded
[1:31:19] the first teachers union
[1:31:22] in all of the
[1:31:25] country
[1:31:27] actually got organized teachers together
[1:31:31] for further rights of the teachers you
[1:31:35] know I never realized all that that
[1:31:39] he had done
[1:31:41] what that took what that meant what
[1:31:45] effort he put for that I remember that
[1:31:48] when I was a child he ran for to be a
[1:31:51] member of the school board because he
[1:31:54] didn't like the way the direction of
[1:31:56] education and he didn't like the way the
[1:31:59] administration controlled things and he
[1:32:02] wanted greater rights these are all
[1:32:05] parts of things that were in my father
[1:32:11] that were influencing me that I never
[1:32:15] really understood
[1:32:19] and then later on he left teaching I
[1:32:22] don't know why and he became an
[1:32:25] electrical contractor and was president
[1:32:27] of the electricians Union
[1:32:31] and
[1:32:33] I I don't want to go into the personal
[1:32:35] sides of those things but I began to
[1:32:37] look out and I have a source of
[1:32:40] influence in my life that has done all
[1:32:44] these great exploits and and uh
[1:32:49] founded things and ran for offices and
[1:32:53] all these things and and I thought how
[1:32:56] little I really know about him
[1:32:59] you know that personal
[1:33:02] uh I I A lot of times I think uh I would
[1:33:08] like to ask you more now and talk to
[1:33:11] them more
[1:33:13] you know what I mean found out more of
[1:33:15] the reasons and the causes
[1:33:19] you know uh
[1:33:21] what happened you know
[1:33:23] uh
[1:33:26] you know my mom and my dad stuck
[1:33:28] together a lot of marriages don't stick
[1:33:30] together
[1:33:32] today
[1:33:33] and it causes questions in our hearts
[1:33:36] and in our minds we don't know why those
[1:33:39] things and how I'd like this to sit down
[1:33:42] and and talk about what it was like in
[1:33:46] the depression
[1:33:49] you know well it was like how the
[1:33:51] changes have come how the things have
[1:33:54] gained this great the the person that
[1:33:57] has the most influenced on my life
[1:34:01] naturally
[1:34:03] how little I know really about and how
[1:34:07] little time I took to really draw close
[1:34:11] and and to consider his feelings
[1:34:15] what he went through in life what his
[1:34:18] struggles were what his Visions were you
[1:34:21] know to look at him as a man
[1:34:23] you know as a child you're always
[1:34:25] looking up and and you so much is just
[1:34:28] taken for granted
[1:34:30] you know you just take them for granted
[1:34:32] that's what Dad does he gets up in the
[1:34:35] morning and he goes to work every day
[1:34:37] you know you think why
[1:34:40] you know if you don't real you know we
[1:34:43] sometimes fall so short of giving
[1:34:47] respect because we don't know what the
[1:34:51] cause and of the of the respect should
[1:34:55] be
[1:34:57] yourself we don't know what he's doing
[1:34:59] so we really can't respect it the way he
[1:35:03] should
[1:35:05] but you know every day he'd get up and
[1:35:08] he'd go to work and he'd be in his
[1:35:09] office and bidding jobs and and doing
[1:35:13] all the stuff you know and and uh I
[1:35:16] never understood what all that took that
[1:35:18] was just what Dad did
[1:35:21] but what was motivating him what was
[1:35:23] doing it why he did those things those
[1:35:26] are all things now that my father's
[1:35:28] passed on
[1:35:31] but they're all things now I would have
[1:35:33] loved to have had fellowship with him in
[1:35:40] but I never even considered
[1:35:43] that that Fellowship was there for me to
[1:35:46] have
[1:35:49] you know if I'd have sat down and opened
[1:35:51] the door
[1:35:54] and and and
[1:35:57] just
[1:36:00] speak to him
[1:36:02] and of course now
[1:36:04] uh
[1:36:06] you would love to do
[1:36:10] that
[1:36:11] and if you have the opportunity now
[1:36:16] you know
[1:36:18] learn what you can learn
[1:36:21] I remember in my life I I I've always I
[1:36:26] I'm I've been a worker I just work
[1:36:28] that's because my dad took me to work
[1:36:32] he needed a Helper and I worked with him
[1:36:35] from
[1:36:36] all through school and all through the
[1:36:39] Summers no I enjoyed it you know what I
[1:36:42] mean he taught me electrical he taught
[1:36:45] me construction he taught me a lot of
[1:36:48] the things
[1:36:49] that I was in
[1:36:53] and I I sit back and I think now I said
[1:36:56] You know here I had this great influence
[1:36:58] in my life
[1:37:00] I had a person that my political views
[1:37:04] were
[1:37:06] no doubt influenced and and my tastes my
[1:37:11] Foods my culture where he raised me
[1:37:14] that I ended up where I raised in
[1:37:17] California and all those things have a
[1:37:20] great impact in how that now I sit back
[1:37:24] and how much I really knew
[1:37:30] about that man
[1:37:33] as a man
[1:37:36] how much
[1:37:38] what really made him tick and and
[1:37:42] what his motives were and what his of
[1:37:46] objectives were
[1:37:48] and I could never have that opportunity
[1:37:54] even though after many years now
[1:37:59] it's something that
[1:38:01] I long for maybe because I've come to
[1:38:03] that place of maturity
[1:38:07] I remember one time he called me
[1:38:11] unless they answered the phone and and
[1:38:13] he said to Leslie where's David
[1:38:16] he he
[1:38:17] and she said he's in the bathroom he's
[1:38:21] got the toilet off the because one of
[1:38:25] the kids stuck a hairbrush
[1:38:28] down the
[1:38:30] thing you know
[1:38:31] so I and I could just hear him laughing
[1:38:35] ah Vengeance he said
[1:38:38] you know now you know what comes around
[1:38:41] what goes around
[1:38:43] you know and then I realize those are
[1:38:45] things that I did
[1:38:47] you know uh
[1:38:50] we did
[1:38:52] how many times did I see those two legs
[1:38:54] sticking out underneath the car
[1:38:57] to fix it if all the struggle that he
[1:39:01] went through to survive
[1:39:03] and I looked at it now and I sit back
[1:39:06] this morning and I think you know how
[1:39:09] little I knew
[1:39:11] about the greatest influence
[1:39:14] in my natural life
[1:39:19] and I thought
[1:39:21] that was my
[1:39:23] father
[1:39:25] and now I I sit back and I think well
[1:39:28] you know something I have another father
[1:39:34] and he's my original
[1:39:36] father
[1:39:39] he was my first father
[1:39:42] in fact he used my great-grandfather
[1:39:48] my grandfather and my father to bring me
[1:39:53] here
[1:39:55] this this
[1:39:58] other if I could I just to say it in
[1:40:01] this light forgive the word
[1:40:03] but my other father
[1:40:06] my original father
[1:40:09] My real father
[1:40:11] the one that was the original cause he
[1:40:17] was the original cause of me
[1:40:20] my natural father he was the the method
[1:40:24] by which God by the union the scripture
[1:40:28] brother Branham tells us with mother
[1:40:30] brought us here and yet our seed was in
[1:40:34] our fathers and our fathers and our
[1:40:36] fathers back and and all those
[1:40:39] characteristics and attributes came down
[1:40:41] how many times have you looked at
[1:40:43] somebody said well you look like your
[1:40:45] mother you know I mean or you look like
[1:40:47] your father it's like teenagers they
[1:40:49] don't want to be identified so they go
[1:40:52] sit off by themselves you know
[1:40:54] and everybody's looking at them like
[1:40:57] I'm here by myself
[1:40:59] but yet they look just like their dad
[1:41:02] you know they look just like they're
[1:41:04] they're a mother you know the you can't
[1:41:08] separate yourself from that
[1:41:10] but so we have another father this
[1:41:13] morning
[1:41:15] my Earthly father has passed on
[1:41:19] and all the things and I trust that he's
[1:41:22] in the hands of God
[1:41:24] he wasn't a religious man
[1:41:28] uh
[1:41:30] he was a fair and just man
[1:41:32] but the prophet of God said all that you
[1:41:35] loved
[1:41:37] and all that loved you would be there
[1:41:41] and I I hold to the fact
[1:41:45] because my original father and my first
[1:41:49] father
[1:41:50] chose me to come through that path that
[1:41:54] there will be a blessing that lays up in
[1:41:58] Eternity for them
[1:42:01] whether they live in that City that's
[1:42:04] given to the bride but those that live
[1:42:07] on the outside and come to and fro that
[1:42:12] God that just God will give them a
[1:42:15] portion
[1:42:16] of that Kingdom
[1:42:20] I'm ashamed of all the things that I
[1:42:23] never recognized in all the efforts that
[1:42:25] my father put forth and all what he
[1:42:27] suffered and gave up
[1:42:30] the vacations he took us on
[1:42:34] my dad took a scheme
[1:42:36] and now I realize how expensive that was
[1:42:39] how much money he used to spend to take
[1:42:44] the skiing put us in a cabin to to do
[1:42:48] those things it the failure
[1:42:52] of my recognition
[1:42:56] and respect
[1:43:01] innocent
[1:43:04] it astonishes me
[1:43:07] maybe almost to the form that it almost
[1:43:11] a a form of of
[1:43:16] maybe not
[1:43:18] disrespect but just lack of appreciation
[1:43:21] their lack of knowledge
[1:43:25] but now that I look
[1:43:29] at my first father
[1:43:32] my original father
[1:43:34] the one that used my Earthly father
[1:43:38] to bring me here I thought you know I I
[1:43:42] don't want to not know him
[1:43:48] I want to know him
[1:43:52] okay Mark maybe I didn't have growing up
[1:43:55] and I got my own concerns and I I walked
[1:44:00] maybe past and missed the opportunity to
[1:44:04] honor my father the way I really should
[1:44:07] have honored him
[1:44:09] maybe to have the respect for him that I
[1:44:12] should have really had for him
[1:44:15] to give him the honor and the
[1:44:17] recognition that I should have really
[1:44:21] given them maybe I've passed that
[1:44:28] but I thought this father
[1:44:32] I want to know him
[1:44:36] my original father
[1:44:39] and I hope you can understand that my
[1:44:42] first father the one that was the the
[1:44:45] original cause of me
[1:44:49] and we know all about predestination and
[1:44:51] all about the thinking and all about
[1:44:54] where we are but take all that you know
[1:44:58] about your where you come from
[1:45:02] your name being on the Book of Life who
[1:45:05] you are who your original father is all
[1:45:09] the the words and definitions that you
[1:45:12] to describe to describe yourself as a
[1:45:15] child of God
[1:45:20] that's what we say this morning I am a
[1:45:23] child of God I have a father
[1:45:27] and he knows my name
[1:45:30] I have a father
[1:45:32] I have a father that was the cause of my
[1:45:36] natural father
[1:45:37] that's my original father
[1:45:40] and he has
[1:45:43] put me in a place
[1:45:47] that I claim to be his child
[1:45:51] and then the question comes back how
[1:45:54] well do I know him
[1:46:00] am I going to
[1:46:02] can I make the same mistake again
[1:46:08] well I made it in the natural
[1:46:12] can that same thing happen to me in the
[1:46:15] spiritual because I didn't make the
[1:46:18] effort
[1:46:19] I didn't take the time I was about my
[1:46:23] own business I had you know I didn't
[1:46:26] like some of the influences
[1:46:29] that he was putting on me as a teenager
[1:46:32] about being disciplined and what kind of
[1:46:35] crowds I should hang out with and and
[1:46:37] why I couldn't be lazy and all the
[1:46:41] things that he taught us that we
[1:46:44] rebelled against
[1:46:48] and I thought Lord I don't want to make
[1:46:50] that mistake this morning
[1:46:54] I want to know you
[1:46:57] I want a fellowship with you I don't
[1:47:00] want it to be just religion I want it to
[1:47:04] be personal
[1:47:05] I want to know you as you are
[1:47:10] I want to know you for what you are
[1:47:14] I want to know you for your attributes
[1:47:17] may I say it like this to you this
[1:47:20] morning I want to know you for your
[1:47:22] personality
[1:47:26] what I guess I can say I missed about my
[1:47:29] natural father is I never understood his
[1:47:32] personality but now
[1:47:35] I have an opportunity
[1:47:37] to know the personality of my original
[1:47:40] father
[1:47:42] my first father
[1:47:44] the one that deserves all respect
[1:47:48] because I'm trusting him
[1:47:52] for the soul of my natural father
[1:47:57] so how do we know
[1:48:00] Our Father
[1:48:03] we know our heavenly father through his
[1:48:06] word
[1:48:08] and his son
[1:48:11] we know him through his word for what
[1:48:15] that is
[1:48:16] I I don't I
[1:48:20] so if I'm going to know him
[1:48:24] and I'm going to take the time because
[1:48:27] my fellowship is in the father
[1:48:33] this is what he said our fellowship is
[1:48:36] in the father this morning we're here
[1:48:39] and we are here for one another maybe
[1:48:42] you came to see somebody maybe there's a
[1:48:45] certain sister here you just got your
[1:48:47] eye on and the main reason that you're
[1:48:49] coming to church is that your heart's
[1:48:51] just a twittering
[1:48:54] it's all right
[1:48:56] keep it on us keep it holy keep its pure
[1:48:59] don't do anything that would seem evil
[1:49:02] or have uh anything those that's the
[1:49:06] natural course of life I'm great for
[1:49:08] that
[1:49:10] maybe you're here because you just like
[1:49:13] the people
[1:49:15] it's the thing to do
[1:49:17] it's where everybody's going you know we
[1:49:19] have our community and we're all going
[1:49:22] to gab and talk and go out and eat and
[1:49:24] that's fine too I think that's wonderful
[1:49:26] that should be a part of it
[1:49:29] but our real Fellowship is in the father
[1:49:32] that's what we're hearing this morning
[1:49:34] I'm here this morning to say father I
[1:49:37] don't want to miss you
[1:49:40] because when I was in the flesh being
[1:49:43] growing up my fleshly man wasn't able to
[1:49:48] comprehend of the what my real Earth but
[1:49:53] my Earthly father was but now Lord I
[1:49:56] don't want my spiritual man to miss what
[1:50:00] you really are
[1:50:04] so I want to
[1:50:05] Our Father
[1:50:07] which heart in heaven
[1:50:10] Our Father this morning our fellowships
[1:50:13] in our father and I just thought
[1:50:17] to talk about what our father is
[1:50:22] and the scripture says that
[1:50:28] that he's
[1:50:30] he God Reveals His
[1:50:34] nature and his attributes and his person
[1:50:40] and his nature not only through his
[1:50:43] works
[1:50:44] but through his word
[1:50:48] through his name
[1:50:51] and we know some of the names of God we
[1:50:54] sang it this morning I thought it was so
[1:50:56] perfect Elohim
[1:50:59] Adonai
[1:51:01] right we know him as Jehovah
[1:51:05] Elohim refers to God as the omnipotent
[1:51:09] creator
[1:51:13] now this morning do you know him as the
[1:51:17] Creator
[1:51:18] of all things
[1:51:20] but when you think about them and you
[1:51:22] look out and you look at the stars like
[1:51:25] that little man on the boat talking that
[1:51:27] boy he said look around he's in
[1:51:29] everything that man knew him as the
[1:51:32] omnipotent Creator he saw the invisible
[1:51:36] things of God are are clearly seen by
[1:51:39] the visible things around us
[1:51:41] God wrote his Bible in the Stars he he
[1:51:44] becomes the US Elohim
[1:51:49] to know him
[1:51:51] in that attribute
[1:51:55] and have fellowship and that's my
[1:51:58] heart's desire
[1:52:00] for this
[1:52:01] my original
[1:52:03] father
[1:52:05] Jehovah
[1:52:08] the self-existing Lord
[1:52:12] who reveals himself
[1:52:15] Jehovah
[1:52:16] the self-existing standing alone
[1:52:20] no he had no father
[1:52:23] he was the father that's why we say our
[1:52:27] father he was the father
[1:52:30] and he's the self-existing one who
[1:52:34] reveals himself
[1:52:38] oh Jehovah when I say Jehovah what am I
[1:52:42] saying this great father God that I have
[1:52:44] it wants to reveal himself to me once
[1:52:49] they have fellowship with me make
[1:52:51] himself known
[1:52:53] one of the great principles that our
[1:52:55] messenger told us so we could get our
[1:52:58] eyes on the right thing
[1:53:02] you can know him this morning
[1:53:06] but not just know him as a guard God far
[1:53:09] off
[1:53:10] but you can know him as the god that
[1:53:13] wants to reveal himself here
[1:53:15] this morning you can know
[1:53:20] your original father
[1:53:24] you can personally know him
[1:53:27] know his purposes know his reasons know
[1:53:30] his wise
[1:53:33] you can be be close to him
[1:53:37] crawl up in his lap
[1:53:42] I thought even my natural I remember
[1:53:44] every night I'd crawl up in my Daddy's
[1:53:47] lap and he would sit there and Rock
[1:53:51] and sing songs to me
[1:53:54] you know
[1:53:56] way out in the West
[1:53:58] there was a little Nest you know you
[1:54:02] know and saying make he'd Sing Make the
[1:54:04] World Go Away
[1:54:06] and he'd sing those songs and rock us
[1:54:10] and he'd go to bed
[1:54:14] I want to sit in his lap
[1:54:17] My real father
[1:54:19] my original father
[1:54:22] it says
[1:54:24] ad and I
[1:54:26] the master
[1:54:28] and head
[1:54:30] of all things
[1:54:32] there's so many names of God but I just
[1:54:36] want to take just a moment quick moment
[1:54:39] this morning
[1:54:41] to go through
[1:54:44] the
[1:54:46] seven Redemptive names
[1:54:49] of Jehovah
[1:54:52] the seven
[1:54:55] manifestation
[1:54:57] characteristics of our father
[1:55:01] that he put on display
[1:55:05] so that we can know him
[1:55:09] and my question this morning is do I
[1:55:12] know my father in these attributes I
[1:55:16] just don't want to know of him
[1:55:18] I want it to become closer I want it to
[1:55:21] become more real I want to know that
[1:55:24] this is the god that's looking after me
[1:55:27] that's fathering me that's keeping me
[1:55:30] and training me and raising me that's
[1:55:33] responsible for me because a father
[1:55:36] takes on the responsibility and God is
[1:55:39] taking on the responsibility for your
[1:55:42] soul
[1:55:45] and sometimes that means chastisement
[1:55:49] and correction
[1:55:52] sometimes that means he's got to put you
[1:55:54] in a place
[1:55:57] to force us to sit down and realize I've
[1:56:01] got to take heed and take note
[1:56:05] if you keep finding yourself back in the
[1:56:08] same spot
[1:56:10] over and over and over again
[1:56:14] you need to take
[1:56:16] a good look
[1:56:21] at what are you missing
[1:56:24] from the father
[1:56:27] because he has you covered
[1:56:32] you understand that it's just we got
[1:56:35] such thick skulls
[1:56:38] I mean I do my thoughts goes
[1:56:42] thick that I just get so angry with
[1:56:44] myself that why is it so hard for me to
[1:56:47] learn a lesson
[1:56:50] so one of the great names of Jehovah
[1:56:55] if Jehovah Roy
[1:57:01] the Lord
[1:57:03] my shepherd
[1:57:07] it just
[1:57:09] you know in Psalms it says the Lord is
[1:57:12] my shepherd I shall not want. just to
[1:57:16] think about that my father is my
[1:57:19] shepherd
[1:57:21] and there is he's
[1:57:24] he's
[1:57:25] my shepherd
[1:57:27] do you know him as a shepherd
[1:57:31] do you know him when he's in intervenes
[1:57:34] in your life
[1:57:35] do you know him when he's guiding your
[1:57:39] footsteps do you know him when he's
[1:57:41] shutting doors and opening doors I mean
[1:57:45] how many doors does he shut we don't
[1:57:46] even realize it how many doors does he
[1:57:49] open and it just goes by us how many
[1:57:52] that we don't even understand that this
[1:57:55] great father is responsible for our
[1:57:58] lives he's influencing Our Lives he's in
[1:58:01] our lives he's dealing with us every day
[1:58:03] he promised he won't leave us nor
[1:58:06] forsake us that he be there with us and
[1:58:09] I think how I want to become conscious
[1:58:11] of that
[1:58:16] he's not going to change
[1:58:19] he's always going to be my shepherd but
[1:58:23] I can have fellowship with him knowing
[1:58:26] he's my shepherd being have a fellowship
[1:58:29] with the father be more aware of that
[1:58:32] attribute and and his presence in my
[1:58:35] life and give him respect and honor for
[1:58:38] it
[1:58:40] the scripture says he's Jehovah Jireh
[1:58:45] the Lord my provider
[1:58:47] isn't that beautiful
[1:58:50] and Abraham called the name of the place
[1:58:52] Jehovah jirei as it was said to his day
[1:58:57] in the Mount of the Lord it shall be
[1:59:01] seen
[1:59:03] Jehovah Jireh the Lord will provide
[1:59:06] as our brothers testimony this morning
[1:59:10] I want to know him
[1:59:13] in that attribute
[1:59:15] because he's a father
[1:59:18] he's there every day in my life with
[1:59:20] that attribute he's in there every day
[1:59:23] of my life providing
[1:59:27] ho
[1:59:29] I I gave somebody a gift a little while
[1:59:32] ago and they just took it stuck it in
[1:59:35] their pocket didn't even say thank you
[1:59:40] and I you know I was a little miffed
[1:59:43] at first
[1:59:45] and then I realized you know
[1:59:49] it's just issues
[1:59:53] you know the poor person's got issues
[1:59:57] you know he doesn't know how to say
[2:00:01] thank you
[2:00:03] and so instead of being upset I thought
[2:00:07] you know maybe ought to be
[2:00:10] just more in prayer
[2:00:12] because how how terrible it must be
[2:00:17] that you can't say thank you
[2:00:21] and then I realized that that was a lot
[2:00:24] to my problems
[2:00:26] it was just getting something I was
[2:00:28] thankful but I didn't know how to handle
[2:00:30] the emotion I didn't know how to say I'm
[2:00:33] thankful I I wasn't comfortable with
[2:00:36] that feeling
[2:00:39] and yet I've got a father
[2:00:42] that is a provider I want to get
[2:00:45] comfortable with receiving God's
[2:00:48] blessings
[2:00:50] I want to thankful it's a relationship
[2:00:52] God's pouring His blessings on us
[2:00:55] because he loves us
[2:00:57] you know and we can hardly accept it
[2:01:01] you know like it's got a string attached
[2:01:04] to it and we're suspicious
[2:01:07] of our very father
[2:01:10] that so loved us that he gave his only
[2:01:12] begotten son
[2:01:16] oh God
[2:01:19] I I want my whole relationship with my
[2:01:23] father
[2:01:24] to move to a higher level
[2:01:30] I don't want to miss it
[2:01:32] like I did in the natural
[2:01:35] and maybe you have a the opportunity and
[2:01:39] the natural to build that bridge back
[2:01:42] with your father build it back take the
[2:01:45] humble side
[2:01:54] I did a funeral one time and and
[2:01:57] I met a man and
[2:02:00] he was dying with cancer and
[2:02:03] his daughter had come down
[2:02:07] to take care of his son had come down to
[2:02:09] take care of his daughter-in-law was a
[2:02:11] Believer and the man gloriously came to
[2:02:14] the Lord
[2:02:18] and then when it came time for the
[2:02:21] funeral
[2:02:24] this man was a rascal
[2:02:27] he abused his children
[2:02:31] he
[2:02:34] he was was a terrible father
[2:02:41] and when the time for the funeral came
[2:02:44] Leslie was standing there with me and we
[2:02:47] knew something was wrong
[2:02:49] so finally they got enough courage to
[2:02:51] come up and say we don't want you to
[2:02:54] tell us all about what God did for him
[2:02:57] and all this he was a rat
[2:03:00] and I thought well wait a minute
[2:03:04] you know I didn't want to go into that
[2:03:06] they're just as ratty we're all ready
[2:03:11] but I remember the Lord come down I said
[2:03:13] you know
[2:03:15] maybe you had it hard
[2:03:18] and maybe he wasn't
[2:03:20] all that he could should have been
[2:03:24] and if God forgave them that's God's
[2:03:26] business
[2:03:28] amazing
[2:03:29] I can't change that I says but the one
[2:03:33] thing that you guys can change right now
[2:03:36] is you're still brothers and sisters you
[2:03:39] can still love one another you can still
[2:03:41] have Fellowship one with another and by
[2:03:43] the time that service is over they were
[2:03:45] all in the front bawling and holding on
[2:03:48] to one another why because they found
[2:03:50] out that they had a father
[2:03:54] a real father
[2:03:56] the original father that loved them
[2:04:00] and God is love and there's no variance
[2:04:04] in them in every good and perfect gift
[2:04:07] comes from the father above that's the
[2:04:10] father they needed to know
[2:04:14] and that's a father we got to know
[2:04:18] we call them Jehovah raphi
[2:04:21] the Lord my healer
[2:04:28] it says in Exodus
[2:04:31] lord said and if thou Wilt diligently
[2:04:34] hearken to my voice of the Lord thy God
[2:04:38] and we'll do that which is right in his
[2:04:41] sight and will give ear to his
[2:04:43] Commandments and keep his statutes I
[2:04:47] will put none of these diseases upon
[2:04:51] thee which I have brought upon the
[2:04:54] Egyptians for I am the Lord that he lit
[2:04:58] thee Hallelujah
[2:05:01] do you know him as that
[2:05:04] not just God's a Healer that he's got
[2:05:08] the power to heal
[2:05:10] but to know him in the fellowship that
[2:05:14] if I keep his Commandments and I live
[2:05:17] for him and I put him first that he's
[2:05:21] going to keep things from coming on me
[2:05:25] [Music]
[2:05:26] I have that relationship with them I
[2:05:29] have that fellowship with them I know
[2:05:31] him as that kind of God I have that
[2:05:35] fellowship with them
[2:05:37] Lord I live for you you protect me
[2:05:40] that's a good thing
[2:05:43] right
[2:05:45] I wonder if we start to understand how
[2:05:48] little that we're really in fellowship
[2:05:50] with our father and how little we really
[2:05:53] know him
[2:05:55] let's don't miss the opportunity our
[2:05:58] messenger opened the door for us in this
[2:06:00] age to have True Fellowship with our
[2:06:03] father
[2:06:06] Jehovah shalom
[2:06:09] the Lord my peace
[2:06:13] then get even built an altar
[2:06:16] there unto the Lord and called it
[2:06:18] Jehovah Shalom unto this day it is yet
[2:06:23] the Oprah of the
[2:06:27] I know how to say that
[2:06:30] aberration that's judges 6 and 24. he
[2:06:35] called it the Lord is my peace
[2:06:40] the Lord's a mighty shelter he's a rock
[2:06:44] that we can run into these are this is
[2:06:48] the god that keeps making himself known
[2:06:51] in these great attributes so we can
[2:06:55] understand that we can have fellowship
[2:06:58] with them
[2:07:00] that we can know him as the god that's
[2:07:03] our peace
[2:07:06] my peace I give you
[2:07:09] a peace that's her path understanding
[2:07:13] we can know him as these things

[2:07:23] and Moses built an altar and called the
[2:07:25] name of the place Jehovah nissai unto
[2:07:29] this day

[2:07:32] and the Oprah I don't know how to say
[2:07:36] that it's judges 17 15.
[2:07:39] Zach can you put that up there judges 17
[2:07:42] 15. not possible
[2:07:44] okay

[2:08:47] righteousness
[2:08:49] is there any good thing in us that any
[2:08:52] of us should boast no my father

[2:09:21] cleansing you and forgiving you of all
[2:09:24] unrighteousness every day every little

[2:09:35] making it right how many things has he
[2:09:37] made right in your life

[2:10:01] my original cause
[2:10:07] the one who orchestrated all my
[2:10:10] Generations in the past
[2:10:13] to come together
[2:10:15] to produce me
[2:10:17] the way that I am
[2:10:19] I oh I want to have that kind of
[2:10:22] Fellowship
[2:10:24] with the Lord don't you
[2:10:28] it says
[2:10:30] Jehovah
[2:10:33] Shama
[2:10:35] the Lord is there for me
[2:10:39] I was round about 18
[2:10:42] 000 measures in the name of the city of
[2:10:46] that day shall be called the Lord is
[2:10:50] there
[2:10:52] we have so many wonderful
[2:10:56] names
[2:10:59] of the father
[2:11:01] but all those names were just there so
[2:11:05] he could
[2:11:07] he could express himself
[2:11:10] that we could have Fellowship we we know
[2:11:13] him we know him through
[2:11:16] his attributes we know him through his
[2:11:19] name
[2:11:20] so we know him through his word in the
[2:11:24] Old Testament as the recept seven
[2:11:26] Redemption names of Jehovah that's why
[2:11:29] when brother Bosworth was arguing with
[2:11:32] brother best he looked at him he says
[2:11:34] brother best
[2:11:36] do the seven Redemptive names of Jehovah
[2:11:40] apply to Jesus Christ
[2:11:45] he had them right there because the
[2:11:47] scripture says he's Jehovah my healer

[2:17:21] a way for us and providing for us
[2:17:23] because he's the father

[2:17:39] the opportunity is there
[2:17:42] and maybe I miss the opportunity in the

[2:18:21] the life
[2:18:22] he's Christ
[2:18:24] the anointed
[2:18:29] how many people in life would long to
[2:18:33] know
[2:18:34] a great person
[2:18:37] or somebody who's famous
[2:18:41] oh you know I'd like to know maybe a a
[2:18:44] certain baseball star
[2:18:48] or something
[2:18:50] I remember Aaron my son Aaron he liked
[2:18:55] baseball and he had a picture of
[2:18:59] Julio Franco
[2:19:01] playing for the Rangers
[2:19:03] on his wall
[2:19:07] you know Julio Franco just the baseball
[2:19:09] player he just he held this bat real
[2:19:12] funny you know and and as a kid he just
[2:19:16] said you know I
[2:19:17] wouldn't it be nice to know
[2:19:21] Julio Franco
[2:19:23] and one day Ronnie took and Aaron went
[2:19:27] to a little baseball luncheon and Ronnie
[2:19:29] went over and mentioned to Julio Franco
[2:19:31] and Julio Franco came over and talked to
[2:19:34] Aaron
[2:19:35] Aaron told me he's a Christian Julio
[2:19:38] Franco said I'm a Christian and when
[2:19:40] Julio Franco would come into town he'd
[2:19:42] call Aaron up
[2:19:45] and they go hang out together
[2:19:47] and he'd go over to this room
[2:19:50] and talk to him and
