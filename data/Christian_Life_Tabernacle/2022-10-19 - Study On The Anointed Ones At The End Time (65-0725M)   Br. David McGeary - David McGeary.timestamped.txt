[26:50] drink from the Wellspring of life and
[26:53] understand our place
[26:56] we ask you to bless us tonight and help
[26:58] us
[26:59] in Jesus precious and
[27:01] holy name we pray
[27:04] amen and amen praise the Lord if you
[27:08] have your Bibles
[27:11] let's open up to the book of
[27:14] uh
[27:15] mark
[27:16] and read the last chapter of Mark and
[27:20] and we're going to play a little portion
[27:22] of the word of God tonight and
[27:24] and talk about some of the things in the
[27:28] word of God you know the word of God's
[27:30] our fountain
[27:32] it's everything you know the the
[27:35] greatest stimulation and even in the
[27:39] scriptures when it talks about the wine
[27:41] and the oil it says hurt not the wine
[27:43] and the oil he said that that was the
[27:46] stimulation
[27:48] of Revelation
[27:50] and I hope tonight that Revelation
[27:54] stimulates you
[27:56] because that that's what stimulates you
[27:58] the world is stimulated by a guitar riff
[28:01] and a beating of a drum or or some uh
[28:07] Sports Action but the bride is
[28:10] stimulated by the word of God that's
[28:13] what that's what stimulates the bride
[28:16] amen so let's just read this tonight it
[28:19] says and after he appeared 14th verse of
[28:23] the uh
[28:25] 16th chapter of The Book of Mark
[28:29] Mark 16 14. and after he appeared unto
[28:34] the 11 as they sat at meat
[28:38] and upgraded them with their unbelief
[28:41] and Hardness of Heart because they
[28:44] believed not them which had seen him
[28:47] after he was risen
[28:50] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[28:53] world and preach the gospel to every
[28:56] creature
[28:57] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[29:00] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[29:04] be damned and these signs shall follow
[29:06] them that believe in my name they shall
[29:10] cast out devils
[29:13] they shall speak with new tongues
[29:16] they shall take up serpents
[29:19] and if they drink any deadly thing it
[29:22] shall not hurt them they shall lay hands
[29:25] on the sick and they shall recover
[29:29] so then after the Lord had spoken unto
[29:32] them
[29:32] he was received up into heaven and sat
[29:36] at the right hand of God
[29:38] and they went forth and preached
[29:41] everywhere
[29:42] though
[29:43] the Lord working with them and
[29:46] confirming the word with signs following
[29:51] amen Heavenly Father we ask you to bless
[29:54] your word in the precious name of the
[29:57] Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen God
[30:01] bless you may be seated
[30:06] those are uh
[30:08] such wonderful words of promise
[30:11] but yet those very words are promised
[30:14] have caused me in lots of trouble
[30:17] because they they try to produce it they
[30:21] try to manufacture it but the source of
[30:24] it is the spirit of God Life in The
[30:28] Believer and we want to talk a little
[30:31] bit about that life because as you
[30:34] notice we've been playing different
[30:36] messages and and bringing up different
[30:39] uh things that the prophet of God
[30:42] brought to us showing us that we're at
[30:46] the end time remember here just a few
[30:49] weeks ago oncoming storm how the prophet
[30:52] mentioned when you see the lawlessness
[30:54] and you see this taking place and that's
[30:57] a sign of the end and and so we have
[30:59] different things around us that show us
[31:01] that we're we're closing in on the end
[31:04] time and along with the end time there's
[31:07] great things for the church and uh
[31:10] there's great things for uh
[31:13] uh the bride and yet there's terrible
[31:16] things for the world
[31:17] I heard a man talking about the City
[31:21] Philadelphia
[31:22] and I and he said man he says this is
[31:25] some of the best times ever in
[31:27] Philadelphia he said we have a baseball
[31:30] of undefeated football team and we have
[31:34] a baseball team in the series boy this
[31:37] is great and the other man said yeah he
[31:40] says been you got the worst crime in the
[31:43] in the country too so he says well it's
[31:46] the best of times and the worst of times
[31:50] well I'm not too worried about the worst
[31:52] at times I want the best at times what
[31:54] God's got for me
[31:56] and he's got something for us
[31:59] and I I think if our hearts could get
[32:02] hungry and we could understand where
[32:04] it's at and we could get anchored down
[32:07] on the right things and and you know and
[32:12] not chase the glitter
[32:14] not chase the shine but know where it's
[32:17] just anchored right in God's word you
[32:21] know and uh uh you know I'm not as young
[32:25] as I used to be I can't preach with the
[32:28] emotion that I used to preach with or
[32:31] with the excitement and energy that I
[32:35] used to preach with but I can tell you
[32:36] one thing I've learned a lot down the
[32:38] road
[32:40] I can tell movements and I can tell
[32:43] things it's saying and and I know when
[32:45] I'm on the spot and I know when people
[32:47] are pointing their finger at me and I
[32:49] know but you know what I've carried that
[32:52] cross a long time
[32:54] I the some of the a lot of the preachers
[32:58] even around this country today told me I
[33:01] was Antichrist when I said the mighty
[33:03] Angel setting his foot on the land and
[33:05] sea was in brother branham's Ministry
[33:08] and the son of man was the Fulfillment
[33:10] of the promises of the second coming of
[33:13] the Lord as the devil
[33:16] so I know what it's like to go through
[33:19] the pressure
[33:20] of not being and being misunderstood you
[33:25] know and and like they say you know that
[33:27] I'm against worship and I'm against that
[33:29] I've danced in the spirit more than you
[33:31] all
[33:34] I'll guarantee it
[33:36] I've been dancing in the spirit for over
[33:38] 50 years
[33:40] I've shouted
[33:43] more than you all
[33:45] I put on a tape I just shout down the
[33:48] road me and Ron Peterson one day were
[33:50] going on down the road listening to the
[33:52] message we got so excited we parked the
[33:54] car and got out and started running into
[33:56] counting circles just a praising God I
[33:59] still like to praise God hallelujah
[34:01] you're free to praise God if you ain't
[34:04] praising God it's because you got a
[34:06] problem there's no oppression here
[34:08] keeping you from praising God shout
[34:11] hallelujah hallelujah praise God anybody
[34:14] feel like speaking in tongues speak in
[34:17] tongues
[34:18] I'm sure that if you speak in tongues
[34:20] it's the spirit of God and there'll be a
[34:23] prophecy
[34:24] right behind it
[34:27] you know okay that's wonderful
[34:29] wonderful if I'm sorry we can't run
[34:33] around here because we're too crowded
[34:36] but in the canoe Church we're going to
[34:38] have 20 foot between the platform and
[34:41] the first row so you can run around
[34:44] and praise him and Shout God
[34:48] okay and and but
[34:52] I'm going to share a little something
[34:55] with you tonight
[34:57] okay
[34:58] and it's out of anointed ones at the end
[35:01] time
[35:03] we're gonna listen to 25 minutes of
[35:07] anointed ones at the end time now
[35:08] there's a lot of difference between me
[35:11] possibly and a lot of other people is
[35:14] that
[35:16] if you're going to hear it from me
[35:17] you're going to hear it from the prophet
[35:21] what separates conjunct my a lot of good
[35:25] friends in UPC Church tonight they're
[35:28] there speaking in tongues they're
[35:29] prophesying they're dancing and they're
[35:31] running around the spirit but what's the
[35:33] one thing missing
[35:37] the word
[35:39] so I'm going to read a couple statements
[35:41] play this tape and show you something
[35:44] that the prophet of God taught
[35:46] it's not to make
[35:49] you afraid
[35:52] it's to make you sure
[35:57] okay because what did we preach last
[36:02] uh I think it was uh Sunday I I think I
[36:06] I I called it uh the acceptance of your
[36:11] election
[36:13] the acceptance of your election that
[36:16] you've been elected for something
[36:19] different than what's going on
[36:23] the acceptance of your election and so
[36:27] I'd like to read a few statements to you
[36:29] before we go at uh further and uh
[36:34] and just so that uh it it would be a
[36:38] kind of a blessing uh to you to uh to uh
[36:45] my
[36:46] Pages stuck together here
[36:49] but uh
[36:52] okay this now we know without faith it's
[36:56] impossible to please God right so the
[36:58] greatest weapon
[37:00] that the bride has is what
[37:03] faith faith is connected with love
[37:07] doubt is connected with fear
[37:10] so pure love of God's word will produce
[37:15] pure faith
[37:17] this is what our prophet of God said
[37:21] he said blessed art thou Simon
[37:24] of Jonah
[37:25] Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this
[37:28] to you my father which in heaven has
[37:30] revealed it and Upon This Rock I'll
[37:33] build my church
[37:35] the true revelation of the word
[37:39] there is the true vine again
[37:43] Abel by faith
[37:46] Abel by faith offered a what a more
[37:50] excellent sacrifice
[37:53] that's what we want to do we want to
[37:56] offer a more excellent worship
[38:03] we want to offer a more excellent move
[38:08] of God we want to offer a more excellent
[38:13] and we can only do that by what
[38:16] by faith by the word
[38:20] okay he said you say it it it wasn't a
[38:25] revelation what is faith faith is
[38:28] something that's revealed to you
[38:33] that is not yet but you believe it will
[38:37] be faith is a revelation of the will of
[38:45] God
[38:46] fake is the revelation of the will of
[38:51] God now if I want to shout I want to
[38:54] shout because God has revealed to me
[38:58] what his will is now that's we're
[39:02] shouting about I know the will of God
[39:05] it's been revealed to me
[39:08] we already preached and listened to the
[39:11] prophet of God to explain about a
[39:13] manufactured Revival and which we talked
[39:16] that as sheep he doesn't have to produce
[39:19] wool he Bears wool so we we know what
[39:22] faith is Faith is a revelation of the
[39:26] will of God by Revelation because the
[39:29] will of God has been made known to you
[39:32] now
[39:33] there's the Holy Ghost
[39:40] that's the Holy Spirit
[39:44] now the question is what's what's this
[39:47] other
[39:48] it's going to be good
[39:50] I love it
[39:52] he said
[39:54] so faith is a revelation then I'd like
[39:56] to say this he he says this
[39:59] he says
[40:05] he and he says
[40:07] where
[40:09] whether we're Methodist Baptist
[40:12] Presbyterian or Pentecostal what more
[40:15] we're all the same
[40:18] we are not the same
[40:22] he says ye are a separate people
[40:26] holy unto the Lord dedicated to the word
[40:31] and the spirit of God to bear fruit of
[40:36] his promise of this day
[40:42] and you're not of them
[40:46] I know that's awful strong but that's
[40:50] the truth just the same dedicated to a
[40:54] service
[40:55] in this last day
[40:59] come out from amongst debt wow that's a
[41:04] pretty strong statement he said this he
[41:08] says and then over here he makes this
[41:09] statement every sign every Wonder
[41:12] anointed men prophesied all kinds of
[41:15] things going forth all kinds of sign all
[41:18] kinds of Wonders
[41:20] how you going to tell the difference
[41:25] watch the word for this hour
[41:29] that's how
[41:32] all right so every time something Rises
[41:36] up
[41:38] and the question Rises up the answer to
[41:42] the question is the word
[41:46] who has the word for this hour
[41:52] the messenger for the age has the word
[41:55] for the hour
[41:57] so I could sit here and explain things
[42:00] to you
[42:01] but how much better
[42:03] would it be to have the messenger
[42:07] explain
[42:09] so what we're going to do we're going to
[42:11] listen to 25 minutes
[42:13] point out a few things and understand
[42:17] we're not against anything
[42:20] we're only for the truth
[42:27] we're only for what's pure what's right
[42:31] and what's undefiled
[42:34] that's all that we want we want it to be
[42:38] God and Only God
[42:41] hate men and no restrictions
[42:45] you know feel free to come out and spy
[42:50] out our liberties uh in the Lord I hope
[42:54] that I've lived a real transparent life
[42:56] in front of you you're all oh you know
[42:58] what I drive you're welcome to come over
[43:00] to my house you know come in I've got
[43:03] nothing to hide I've got nothing to
[43:06] preach
[43:08] you know I'm we're all in the same boat
[43:11] we're following the message of the hour
[43:13] so if we could all just anchor into it
[43:16] and and listen and you know like and be
[43:21] be a participant in the ministry can you
[43:25] know if if you're gonna come Fellowship
[43:27] here listen to the tapes we play listen
[43:31] to what's trying to be said uh dig into
[43:35] it get involved in it okay let it just
[43:39] don't go in through a service go study
[43:41] it out
[43:42] because there there we're we're right
[43:45] down a Razor's Edge
[43:49] just like the deity
[43:51] you know brother Branham wasn't God but
[43:54] yet there was God right there
[43:56] very hard to tell it apart
[43:59] sometimes it was God
[44:01] and sometimes it was just the prophet
[44:04] but he lived such a close life to God
[44:07] that even his natural life was such a
[44:11] reflection of God
[44:14] it isn't that what we're promised to be
[44:17] little Messiah
[44:19] amen but we want our power to be what
[44:22] from the life that's in US
[44:26] so let's just listen this 25 minutes and
[44:30] and it's it's astounding what he's going
[44:32] to say
[44:34] and then we'll go study it maybe we'll
[44:36] study this message out
[44:38] a little bit but this is one of the
[44:41] masterpieces that the prophet of God
[44:43] preached the token was a masterpiece and
[44:46] this is a masterpiece so 25 minutes
[44:49] you're all capable of listening to this
[44:51] and and just stay with it he reads
[44:54] scripture she's laying down the
[44:55] foundation to what that he's saying and
[44:59] bringing it down to how do you tell the
[45:02] difference
[45:04] okay you can't tell the difference from
[45:08] the outside
[45:10] there's got to be something deeper than
[45:13] that so okay Brothers if you pick up
[45:15] brother Mike right there and if you have
[45:19] your phones and and you would like to um
[45:24] uh turn to it it's anointed ones at the
[45:28] end time
[45:29] uh just put it so you can't have no
[45:33] other things coming in at paragraph 15
[45:38] and we're going to go to 15 tips
[45:41] uh 15 to 21. he's going to talk about a
[45:46] lot of things he's going to talk about
[45:47] anointing
[45:50] you know what I mean anointing is a big
[45:52] word that's used now
[45:55] right but anybody can be anointed
[46:02] Joyce Meyers my favorite preacher
[46:06] they say she's annoying it
[46:12] you know what I mean
[46:14] and I can't deny it
[46:17] so there's got to be something deeper
[46:19] and richer and your chosen
[46:24] and elected
[46:26] for the deeper and richer things of God
[46:30] God bless you if you if you have your
[46:32] tablet your phone uh I guess nowadays
[46:35] you can look at it if you don't want to
[46:38] look at it there but God richly bless
[46:40] you just listen to this astounding first
[46:43] minutes of this message God bless you
[46:47] in the book of Saint Matthew
[46:50] pardon me
[46:52] 24th verse
[46:54] the 24th chapter or other beginning with
[46:56] the 15th verse I wish to read a potion
[46:59] of his word
[47:02] and
[47:03] when ye therefore shall see the
[47:06] abomination of desolation spoken of by
[47:10] Daniel the Prophet
[47:12] standing in the Holy place
[47:15] who shall readeth let him understand
[47:19] then let them which are in Judea flee
[47:23] into the mountains let him which is on
[47:26] the Housetop
[47:29] a housetop not come down to take
[47:32] anything out of his house
[47:34] you need to let him which is in the
[47:36] field return back to take his clothes
[47:40] and hold on to them that are with child
[47:42] and to them to give stuck in those days
[47:45] but pray ye that your flight be not in
[47:48] the winter neither on the Sabbath day
[47:51] for then shall be Great Tribulation
[47:55] such as was not since the beginning of
[47:58] the world to this time no nor ever shall
[48:03] be
[48:05] and except those days should be
[48:07] shortened there be no flesh saved but
[48:11] for the elect sake those days shall be
[48:13] shortened
[48:15] then if any man shall say unto you Lo
[48:18] here is Christ
[48:21] are there believe it not
[48:24] far
[48:26] there shall rise false Christ
[48:29] and false prophets
[48:33] and shall show great signs and wonders
[48:37] in so much that if it were possible they
[48:41] shall deceive the very elected
[48:44] behold I have told you before
[48:48] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[48:51] behold he is in the desert go not forth
[48:53] the holy is in the secret chamber
[48:56] believe it not
[48:59] or as the lightning cometh out of the
[49:01] East and shineth even into the West so
[49:04] shall also the coming of the son of man
[49:07] be
[49:08] far
[49:10] worse forever the carcass is there will
[49:13] the Eagles be gathered
[49:15] how far a subject
[49:19] I would like to take the 24th verse to
[49:22] emphasize on this verse for our Sunday
[49:25] school lesson this morning
[49:28] and listen close while I re-read this
[49:31] again
[49:33] for there shall rise false Christ
[49:37] and false prophets
[49:42] and shall show great signs and wonders
[49:46] in so much that if it were possible they
[49:49] shall deceive the very elected
[49:53] now
[49:54] our subject this morning
[49:57] or a text rather I want to take the
[50:01] anointed ones at the end time
[50:04] that's the
[50:06] subject that I wish to speak on or the
[50:09] text
[50:09] the anointed ones at the end time
[50:14] I believe that we are living in the end
[50:17] time I think most anyone that the
[50:21] scripture reader or even a believer
[50:25] knows that we are now
[50:28] at the end of the history of the world
[50:31] amen there will be no use of brightness
[50:34] because there won't be anybody to read
[50:37] it
[50:38] it's at the end of the time just when I
[50:42] do not know
[50:44] just how long it will be
[50:46] not even the angels of Heaven Nor is
[50:49] that mineral hour but we've been told by
[50:52] the Lord Jesus that when these things
[50:55] that we see now begin to come to pass
[51:00] than to lift up our heads for our
[51:03] Redemption is drawing now
[51:06] now what drawing thy means I do not know
[51:10] May mean as the scientist said the other
[51:14] day on the television speaking of the
[51:15] Great
[51:17] thousands of miles breaking the Earth is
[51:19] going to sink
[51:21] he was asked the question it could sink
[51:25] there that's Los Angeles the west coast
[51:27] and many of you seen how they followed
[51:29] it with radar went up juice broken below
[51:32] San Jose on across over into Alaska out
[51:35] through the eluthian islands about 200
[51:37] miles out into the sea and come back
[51:38] down into San Diego went around it
[51:40] behind Los Angeles and come up there a
[51:43] great pocket
[51:45] and all these earthquakes within Heaven
[51:47] is the volcanic hitting this great a
[51:51] holla Dipper like in their uh I can't
[51:55] call the name that they they called it
[51:57] however when that shakes that use these
[52:00] earthquakes we've been having for years
[52:02] on the west coast now
[52:05] it's cracked all the way around
[52:09] and the scientists said one the man said
[52:13] to the other That Could Fall In he said
[52:16] not good but it will
[52:18] said but not in our generation perhaps
[52:20] that in the next five minutes of the
[52:22] next five years
[52:25] we don't know just when
[52:27] this week was sent me a headlines in the
[52:29] paper a big hundred thousand dollar
[52:32] homes cricking and cracking the people
[52:34] moving away and they don't know how to
[52:36] stop it there's no way to stop it
[52:38] see God can do whatever he wants to and
[52:41] there's nobody can tell him how to do it
[52:43] you build homes you can make scientific
[52:45] things and God is a creator of science
[52:48] how are you going to stop him he can
[52:50] destroy the Earth this morning by fleas
[52:52] if he wants to you realize he can speak
[52:54] please into existence and to be 40 miles
[52:57] deep in a half hour's time see you know
[53:00] to eat people right off the ground he's
[53:02] God
[53:03] he just does as he will he's Sovereign
[53:06] in himself
[53:08] now seeing all this accumulation of
[53:12] evidence
[53:13] that the hour that we now live in
[53:17] I think it's a good thing to rehearse
[53:20] these things and to draw them out since
[53:23] the seals has been opened and find out
[53:25] the truth of these things as God has
[53:28] been so loyal to us with his grace to
[53:31] show us these things I want you to
[53:33] notice here in Matthew 24
[53:34] Jesus use the term of Christ the
[53:40] c-h-r-i-f-t-s Christ not Christ
[53:44] but Christ
[53:46] plural
[53:48] not singular
[53:50] Christ
[53:51] therefore the word Christ means the
[53:55] anointed
[53:57] one
[53:58] and then if it's anointed there will be
[54:02] not only one but many anointed
[54:07] the anointed one
[54:10] see and otherwise if he wanted to break
[54:13] it down so we would more or less
[54:15] understand it better you say in the last
[54:17] days
[54:19] there shall rise false anointed ones
[54:25] now that seems almost
[54:28] impossible see
[54:31] the terms of anointed but notice the
[54:34] very next words
[54:35] and
[54:37] false prophets p-r-o-p-h-e-p-s
[54:42] plural
[54:44] now anointed one is one with a message
[54:48] and the only way the mystics can be
[54:50] brought out is by one that's anointed
[54:53] and that would be a prophet
[54:55] anointed there shall rise
[54:59] false
[55:01] anointed teachers
[55:04] a prophet teaches what his message is
[55:08] anointed
[55:10] teachers but
[55:12] of anointed people with false teaching
[55:17] anointed ones Christ plural prophets
[55:22] plural
[55:24] and there is such a thing as
[55:28] up a Christ
[55:31] singular
[55:33] then these would have to be
[55:36] anointed ones that their prophecy of
[55:40] what they were teaching would be the
[55:42] difference because there are anointed
[55:44] ones
[55:46] 90 now it's a Sunday school lesson we
[55:49] want to to try to bring this to a real
[55:54] Showdown
[55:56] by the scriptures not for what someone
[55:58] else has said about but just reading the
[56:00] scriptures
[56:02] you may say how can this be
[56:07] would the uh anointed once what were the
[56:10] Christ
[56:13] c-h-r-i-s-t-s
[56:15] anointed
[56:17] Christ
[56:18] and false prophets
[56:23] anointed ones but false prophets
[56:27] Jesus said
[56:30] that the rain falls on the just and the
[56:36] unjust
[56:38] as someone might say to me uh do you
[56:41] believe it that anointing on those
[56:45] people means that it's anointing of the
[56:48] Holy Spirit yes sir
[56:51] the genuine holy spirit of God
[56:56] upon a person and yet they are false
[57:01] now listen close and see what he said
[57:06] they shall show signs and wonders
[57:09] in so much that we deceived a very
[57:12] elected
[57:13] if it were possible and they are
[57:16] anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit
[57:24] I know this sounds very foolish but
[57:26] we're going to take time and explain it
[57:29] by the word that's absolutely thus saith
[57:33] the Lord the truth
[57:35] now let's turn in our Bibles just a
[57:38] minute to Matthew the fifth chapter and
[57:40] begin with the uh the 45th verse and see
[57:46] now as we read for a few moments on
[57:48] these scriptures and then if we get to
[57:50] hear what we'll give you so you if we
[57:52] fail to read all of them then you get
[57:54] your Bible and and also you can read
[57:57] them as we leave here and you go home
[58:00] and and you read what the Bible says
[58:03] about it now to take our time to get a a
[58:06] basic fact because I'm making a
[58:09] statement here
[58:11] that's astounding how can the Holy
[58:15] Spirit
[58:16] anoint a false teacher
[58:20] but that's what Jesus said but happened
[58:23] now Matthew
[58:25] the fifth chapter the 40 uh fifth verse
[58:29] let's read now
[58:32] let's get begin a little behind it the
[58:35] 44th but I say unto you love your
[58:38] enemies bless them that curse you do
[58:41] good to them and hate you
[58:43] pray for them to despitefully use you
[58:46] and persecute you that ye may be the
[58:49] children of your father which is in
[58:50] heaven bar he maketh his son to rise on
[58:55] the evil and the good and sendeth Reign
[58:59] on the just and the unjust
[59:05] the rain comes upon the evil as same as
[59:09] the good now to follow this up to
[59:12] another prophecy pertaining to this
[59:15] may we turn out to Hebrews the sixth
[59:18] chapter for the next follow-up first on
[59:21] this word Paul bringing back to mind the
[59:24] same thing that Jesus said Paul speaking
[59:28] now while you're hunting it and you out
[59:30] in the broadcast get your Bibles near
[59:33] you in a piece of paper and look up this
[59:35] now Hebrews the sixth chapter Paul
[59:39] writing to the Hebrews showing them the
[59:41] shadows and the tights bring them from
[59:44] under Judaism into Christianity showing
[59:47] them how all the old things just
[59:50] foreshadowed the things that was to come
[59:54] I was speaking now Hebrews 6. therefore
[59:58] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[1:00:00] of Christ the h-r-i-f-t sangler
[1:00:05] let us go on to Perfection not laying
[1:00:08] again the foundation of repentance it
[1:00:11] works and of Faith towards God
[1:00:15] of Doctrine of baptism
[1:00:18] and of laying on of hands on the
[1:00:21] resurrection of the dead and of Eternal
[1:00:23] judgment and this will we do if God
[1:00:27] permits far
[1:00:30] it is impossible for those who were once
[1:00:35] enlightened and have tasted other
[1:00:36] Heavenly gift and were made for takers
[1:00:40] of the Holy Spirit I want to call your
[1:00:42] attention just a minute you notice that
[1:00:44] gift and not gifts
[1:00:48] for takers are not the Heavenly gifts
[1:00:50] but the Heavenly gift
[1:00:53] singer Christ singer gift Angler
[1:00:58] Heavenly gift and made were takers of
[1:01:01] the Holy Spirit and have tasted all the
[1:01:05] word of God
[1:01:08] tasted of what the word of God and the
[1:01:12] power of the world to come
[1:01:15] if they shall fall away to renew
[1:01:17] themselves again unto repentance seeing
[1:01:20] They Crucified to themselves the Son of
[1:01:22] God afresh and put him to an open shame
[1:01:25] for listen the Earth drinketh in the
[1:01:29] rain that cometh off upon it to bring
[1:01:32] forth herbs me for them by whom it is
[1:01:36] dressed receiveth blessings from God
[1:01:41] but that which beareth Thor's rowers is
[1:01:45] rejected and is nine to cursing whose
[1:01:49] end is to be burned
[1:01:53] I'll compare that with Matthew 5 24
[1:01:55] again notice
[1:01:57] Jesus said the rain and the Sun comes
[1:02:01] upon the Earth that God sends it to
[1:02:05] prepare
[1:02:06] the food and the things for the peoples
[1:02:09] of the earth and the rain is sent for
[1:02:13] the food the herbs
[1:02:16] but the Terriers weeds being in the
[1:02:19] field receive the same thing
[1:02:23] the same rain that makes the wheat grow
[1:02:25] is the same rain that makes the weeds
[1:02:27] grow
[1:02:29] how I had such a lesson on that one time
[1:02:31] when I first met the Pentecostal people
[1:02:35] and it was a great lesson to me I seen
[1:02:39] two men one never heard speaking in
[1:02:41] tongues before one spoken tongue other
[1:02:43] interpreted Vice Versi and would tell
[1:02:46] the truth
[1:02:48] say that there's many in here should
[1:02:50] repent tonight
[1:02:51] there's women and men both and people
[1:02:53] are raised up go to the altar
[1:02:55] I thought how glorious
[1:02:59] and then with the little gift of the
[1:03:02] Holy Spirit
[1:03:03] I talked to those man just you know how
[1:03:06] and the German just a little way to find
[1:03:08] out and one of them was a genuine
[1:03:11] Christian
[1:03:14] and he was a real determinant of Christ
[1:03:16] and the other one was a hypocrite
[1:03:21] and one of them the one that was a
[1:03:23] hypocrite was living with a black-headed
[1:03:27] woman running around with a blonde and
[1:03:29] had children by her
[1:03:30] was right there in a vision couldn't be
[1:03:32] denied
[1:03:34] and I spoke to him about it he looked at
[1:03:38] me and walked around the building
[1:03:40] now I was confused sure enough I thought
[1:03:43] of coming to Angels then I wonder if it
[1:03:45] was among devils
[1:03:47] how could this be I could not understand
[1:03:49] it and for years I kept my hands off of
[1:03:52] it in one day
[1:03:53] where George Smith the boy goes with my
[1:03:56] daughter we went yesterday up to the Old
[1:03:59] Mill place where I go to pray nature
[1:04:02] being in there a couple days the Holy
[1:04:04] Spirit brought this scripture back to me
[1:04:06] for the rain cometh off upon the Earth
[1:04:11] to dress it with herbs
[1:04:14] the thighs and thistles lived on that
[1:04:16] same rain
[1:04:18] and whose end is to be burned
[1:04:22] living by the same life-giving resource
[1:04:27] of God
[1:04:29] that are understood that by Jesus said
[1:04:32] by their fruits they are known
[1:04:36] now
[1:04:37] therefore
[1:04:39] the rain dropping down upon the natural
[1:04:42] uh vegetation of the Earth
[1:04:46] is a type
[1:04:48] of the spiritual rain which gives
[1:04:52] eternal life
[1:04:53] dropping down upon the church
[1:04:56] for we call it the formerine and the
[1:04:59] latter rain and it's a rain pouring out
[1:05:02] of God's spirit upon his church
[1:05:06] notice it's a very strange thing here
[1:05:12] see when them seed went in the ground
[1:05:14] however they got there
[1:05:16] they were Thorns to begin with
[1:05:20] but there are the wheat that went in the
[1:05:23] ground and the herbs were herbs to begin
[1:05:25] with and each herb producing itself over
[1:05:29] again shown that it was in the original
[1:05:31] beginning
[1:05:33] and they will deceive the elected
[1:05:38] if it were possible those are getting
[1:05:40] the same rain same blessing
[1:05:44] showing the same signs same wonders
[1:05:48] see
[1:05:50] they will deceive or shall deceive the
[1:05:54] elected if it were possible
[1:05:58] now Thorn cannot help being a thorn
[1:06:02] and neither can we help being a wheat
[1:06:06] it's what the creator of each one
[1:06:08] determined at the beginning
[1:06:11] that's the elective
[1:06:15] the same rain
[1:06:17] sun rises of a morning it spreads across
[1:06:20] the Earth
[1:06:21] as it had this early day that we lived
[1:06:25] and the sun same Sun it rises in the
[1:06:27] east as the same Sun it sets in the West
[1:06:30] and that sun is sent to ripen the green
[1:06:34] upon the Earth which our bodies are made
[1:06:36] from
[1:06:38] we are living by dead substance that's
[1:06:40] the only way you can live
[1:06:42] if something has to die every day so you
[1:06:45] live
[1:06:46] natural then isn't it true that if
[1:06:51] you're
[1:06:52] your body has to live by dead substance
[1:06:56] for Natural Life
[1:06:59] then you've got to have something die
[1:07:02] spiritually
[1:07:04] to save your spiritual life and God
[1:07:08] became material
[1:07:11] flesh and died that we might live
[1:07:16] there's no church no other thing in the
[1:07:19] world could save you but God
[1:07:21] that's the only thing that they live by
[1:07:24] now run the scriptures
[1:07:27] Jesus is the word
[1:07:30] in the beginning what's the word in the
[1:07:32] word is made flesh and dwelt Among Us in
[1:07:34] beginning what's the word and the words
[1:07:35] with God
[1:07:37] and the Word was made flesh and we'll
[1:07:40] dwelled Among Us and man shall not live
[1:07:43] by bread alone
[1:07:45] for the physical but by every word
[1:07:50] that proceedeth out of the mouths of God
[1:07:56] and you see we live
[1:07:58] by the word
[1:08:01] and that is God
[1:08:04] now the Sun comes across and brightens
[1:08:07] the grain
[1:08:08] I cannot write the
[1:08:10] all at once
[1:08:12] as it goes on maturing it constantly
[1:08:15] ripens until it comes to a full ear
[1:08:18] so is it today
[1:08:20] but the church it started in its infancy
[1:08:23] back in the Dark Age where he's under
[1:08:26] the ground it's grown now into maturity
[1:08:30] and we can see it perfectly
[1:08:32] how that God choose nature
[1:08:36] always you cannot disturb nature
[1:08:41] that's what's the matter today
[1:08:43] we're flying bombs and out there in that
[1:08:46] ocean breaking it and busting around
[1:08:48] with atomic bomb you're just breaking
[1:08:50] more of that dirt off all the time
[1:08:51] dropping into it
[1:08:55] you cut down the trees Farms will take
[1:08:57] you damn up the river it'll overflow
[1:09:01] you've got to find God's way of doing
[1:09:05] things and stay in it
[1:09:07] we've denominated people in the churches
[1:09:10] and organizations look what we got
[1:09:14] then God's provided way of it
[1:09:18] but you see he stands the rain not your
[1:09:21] subject on the just and the unjust
[1:09:25] Jesus tells you you're not in Matthew 24
[1:09:28] it would be a sign at the end time
[1:09:34] now if this sign is only to be known at
[1:09:38] the end time
[1:09:40] there will have to be after the opening
[1:09:42] of those seals
[1:09:45] it's a sign of the end
[1:09:50] that would be when these things happens
[1:09:53] it'll be at the end time
[1:09:56] it'll be a sign now so the elected will
[1:09:59] not be confused
[1:10:03] and these things
[1:10:05] you see it
[1:10:07] that has got to be revealed
[1:10:12] exposed
[1:10:14] notice both the wheat and the weeds live
[1:10:19] by the same anointing from heaven
[1:10:24] both of them Rejoice over
[1:10:27] I remember
[1:10:29] this referring back to this instance
[1:10:33] up there that day at The Greens Mill
[1:10:38] I I've seen that Vision come up
[1:10:41] and there was a great Earth and it had
[1:10:43] been all disc it up
[1:10:45] then I want to soar forth first
[1:10:48] I want to keep that before you what What
[1:10:52] Goes Forth first
[1:10:55] then what follows it
[1:10:57] and is this man with white on came forth
[1:11:00] around the earth sowing seed
[1:11:02] then behind him come a man
[1:11:05] guard close on
[1:11:09] look very sneaking slipping along behind
[1:11:12] him storing weeds
[1:11:14] and as this taken place
[1:11:18] then I seen both crops come up
[1:11:22] and as they come up one was wheat and
[1:11:25] the other was weed and there come a
[1:11:28] drought
[1:11:29] that one looked like both of them had
[1:11:31] their heads down just crying for rain
[1:11:34] then there come a great Cloud over the
[1:11:36] Earth and it rained and the wheat raised
[1:11:38] up and said praise the Lord praise the
[1:11:40] Lord and the weeds raise up in our
[1:11:42] praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:11:45] same results
[1:11:47] although I'm perishing both of them
[1:11:50] going away and then the wheat comes up
[1:11:53] and gets thirsty and because it was in
[1:11:57] the same field
[1:12:00] the same Garden
[1:12:02] the same place
[1:12:04] under the same spout
[1:12:07] dare come up wheat and they'll come up
[1:12:09] Terriers by the very same thing
[1:12:11] notice the same anointing water brings
[1:12:15] forth the wheat brings forth the weed
[1:12:17] the same Holy Spirit
[1:12:21] that anoints the church
[1:12:25] that gives them desire to save Souls
[1:12:29] that gives them power to perform
[1:12:31] miracles
[1:12:33] it falls on the unjust the same as the
[1:12:36] justice the very same spirit
[1:12:38] now you can't make it out of the way and
[1:12:41] understand Matthew 24 24. he said there
[1:12:43] shall rise false Christ
[1:12:48] false anointed ones Anointed with the
[1:12:51] genuine thing
[1:12:53] but be false prophets of it
[1:12:56] false teachers of it
[1:12:59] what would make a man want to be a false
[1:13:02] teacher something is true
[1:13:05] now we get down to the mark of the beast
[1:13:07] in a few minutes you'll see it's the
[1:13:08] nomination
[1:13:12] all teachers
[1:13:15] a false anointed anointed Christ but
[1:13:18] false teachers
[1:13:20] don't know where you can sit just like
[1:13:22] here some time ago I've quoted this I
[1:13:25] might quoted the calls were hooked up
[1:13:26] Across the Nation
[1:13:29] one day I was talking to a friend of
[1:13:31] mine where this is coming in this
[1:13:32] morning in Arizona
[1:13:35] and he had a citrus farm and he had a
[1:13:38] tree there which was an orange tree that
[1:13:40] was bearing grapefruits
[1:13:42] and lemons
[1:13:44] tangerine tangelo's
[1:13:47] I forget how many different fruits there
[1:13:50] was on that one tree
[1:13:52] and I said to the the man
[1:13:56] I said how is it
[1:13:58] what kind of tree is that he said the
[1:14:00] tree itself is an orange tree
[1:14:04] I said what as he got grapefruits on him
[1:14:07] why has he got lemons on it
[1:14:10] he said they're grafted
[1:14:12] into it
[1:14:15] I said I see
[1:14:17] well now I said now next year
[1:14:19] when that tree comes forth with another
[1:14:21] crop of fruit which the all right about
[1:14:24] the same time
[1:14:26] I said then
[1:14:28] it will bring forth all together oranges
[1:14:30] if it's a navel orange tree it'll bring
[1:14:32] forth The navelenges Wanted sir he said
[1:14:35] no sir
[1:14:36] ever grafted Branch will bring forth of
[1:14:39] this kind
[1:14:42] I said you mean that lemon Vine will
[1:14:45] bring forth the lemon out of that orange
[1:14:47] tree he said yes sir
[1:14:50] will the grapefruit bring forth a
[1:14:52] grapefruit out of that orange tree said
[1:14:54] yes sir
[1:14:55] that's the nature of
[1:14:57] the branches grafted into it
[1:15:01] I said praise be to God
[1:15:06] he said what do you mean I said one more
[1:15:09] question now
[1:15:11] will that orange tree ever bring forth
[1:15:14] oranges again he said when he puts forth
[1:15:17] another branch
[1:15:19] when it puts forth another branch
[1:15:22] not when one's grafted into it
[1:15:25] but they're all citrus fruit
[1:15:29] and they live off of the Citrus life
[1:15:32] that's in the citrus tree
[1:15:35] I said there you are
[1:15:37] the methodists will bring forth
[1:15:39] methodists every time the baptism
[1:15:42] reinforce Baptists every time the
[1:15:44] Catholic of rainforest Catholic every
[1:15:46] time
[1:15:47] but the Church of the Living God will
[1:15:49] produce Christ from The Roots the word
[1:15:52] every time if it ever puts forth another
[1:15:55] divine
[1:15:57] of its own
[1:16:00] now you can graft it in there you see
[1:16:02] every grapefruit lemon Angelo Tangerine
[1:16:07] whatever the citrus fruits they are
[1:16:09] every one of them can live in that tree
[1:16:13] but bearing thoughts witness of the tree
[1:16:16] living by the three
[1:16:19] it's it
[1:16:21] they are living and thriving on the
[1:16:24] genuine life that's in that tree
[1:16:27] now there's Matthew 24. 24.
[1:16:32] living by the same life
[1:16:37] but they wasn't
[1:16:39] right at the beginning they're bearing
[1:16:42] false witness of that tree
[1:16:45] it's a fine Street
[1:16:48] yet it's a citrus tree
[1:16:50] and they say this church this
[1:16:52] denomination
[1:16:54] is bearing record of Christ
[1:16:58] it's not a false baptism
[1:17:00] false witness of the word trying to say
[1:17:04] that the power of God was only for the
[1:17:06] disciples
[1:17:07] Jesus himself said go ye into all the
[1:17:11] world and preach the gospel that every
[1:17:14] prince of every tree you've ever bring
[1:17:16] forth
[1:17:17] every breaks that'll be in the tree
[1:17:21] and these signs shall follow the genuine
[1:17:25] branches
[1:17:26] where as long as it's a tree
[1:17:29] as long as it's putting forth branches
[1:17:31] to the end of the world
[1:17:33] in mundane they shall cast out devils
[1:17:36] speak with new tongues take up serpents
[1:17:38] drink daily things lay hands on the sick
[1:17:41] and they shall recover
[1:17:43] see the hour We're living
[1:17:46] do you want Jesus said remember this is
[1:17:48] at the end time not back under Wesley's
[1:17:51] back there
[1:17:53] now at the end time this is to take
[1:17:55] place
[1:17:57] and watch the scriptures let them
[1:18:00] testify
[1:18:01] Jesus said search the scriptures
[1:18:05] or in them you think or believe that you
[1:18:08] have eternal life and they are the ones
[1:18:11] that testify of me
[1:18:13] in other words
[1:18:15] if this tree ever brings forth a branch
[1:18:21] I am
[1:18:23] divine
[1:18:25] the tree
[1:18:27] we are the branches
[1:18:29] he that believeth the need the works
[1:18:32] that I do shall he do also thank John 14
[1:18:36] 12. now he that abideth in me he that
[1:18:41] him that was in my root
[1:18:45] at the beginning
[1:18:47] that's the reason Jesus was both the
[1:18:50] root and offspring of David
[1:18:53] he was before David in David and after
[1:18:56] David
[1:18:57] both root and offspring of David the
[1:19:01] Morning Star the rose of chandelier in
[1:19:04] the valley Alpha and Omega Father Son
[1:19:07] and Holy Ghost In the End dwells of
[1:19:09] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:19:14] both root and offspring of David
[1:19:17] ye that is the elected life
[1:19:21] the predestinated life that's in me and
[1:19:25] that he is the word
[1:19:28] from the beginning when he comes forth
[1:19:31] he'll bear my fruits
[1:19:34] Saint John 14 12.
[1:19:38] but others will live by the same thing
[1:19:40] call themselves Christians and believers
[1:19:43] not all that says lord lord well there
[1:19:46] is
[1:19:48] now this is to take place in being
[1:19:50] manifested in the last days when the
[1:19:53] mysteries of God should be finished as
[1:19:55] we'll get to a little later these trees
[1:19:58] the true vibe
[1:20:01] you like that Pearl
[1:20:03] uh a good
[1:20:06] Shake
[1:20:08] right
[1:20:10] so there's there's there's there's got
[1:20:12] to be there's got to be something
[1:20:16] so you've got remember what he said we
[1:20:19] read it earlier he says same sign Sam's
[1:20:22] wondered how do you tell the difference
[1:20:24] by the word
[1:20:26] so there's God you've got to judge it
[1:20:31] past
[1:20:33] uh
[1:20:35] what would appear to be the anointing
[1:20:39] you can't judge it by the anointing
[1:20:42] because the anointing's right
[1:20:45] remember Mary had the life
[1:20:49] but she wasn't matured
[1:20:53] now here's where the real thing that
[1:20:55] struck me he said this doesn't manifest
[1:20:58] itself
[1:21:00] till after the opening of the seals
[1:21:04] so it shows us that the life that
[1:21:08] they're grafting into is the word life
[1:21:11] or the message life
[1:21:13] that's it so a lot of things had grafted
[1:21:19] itself into the message
[1:21:23] and they're getting their life from the
[1:21:25] message
[1:21:28] they're getting their sermons they're
[1:21:30] getting their everything from it they're
[1:21:33] getting it from the message they got
[1:21:35] everything they're drawing their life
[1:21:37] from the message but now remember what
[1:21:40] he said he said if it's what they were
[1:21:44] in the beginning even though they
[1:21:47] grafted to it and they're drawing their
[1:21:50] life from it
[1:21:52] if they're if they're a legalist
[1:21:56] they're going to put forth legalism
[1:21:59] of the same life the same anointing
[1:22:03] everything's the same if they're
[1:22:06] Pentecostal
[1:22:08] and they're grafted in Pentecostal
[1:22:10] what's going to come out
[1:22:13] Pentecostal that's their fruit and then
[1:22:16] if if they're you know if they're real
[1:22:19] uh Grace Grace liberal and everything
[1:22:24] and that's what they Graft in that the
[1:22:26] Earth's gonna come out but the beautiful
[1:22:29] promise is if that tree ever puts forth
[1:22:34] another limbia it'll be Christ
[1:22:40] Hallelujah
[1:22:42] okay and so here we are part we're part
[1:22:46] of the same tree
[1:22:48] they're grafted in all around us
[1:22:56] and they're starting to put forth their
[1:22:59] fruit
[1:23:01] but what's the last one that puts forth
[1:23:04] his fruit
[1:23:06] is when it puts forth its branch
[1:23:10] and what's that Branch going to be it's
[1:23:13] going to be word
[1:23:15] so if we sit back and it looks like it's
[1:23:18] putting forth fruit if it's putting
[1:23:21] forth fruit and it's putting forth fruit
[1:23:23] and it's the same life in the same life
[1:23:26] but how do you know
[1:23:28] you can't go by the anointing
[1:23:32] you've got to go by the word
[1:23:36] so ask yourself
[1:23:39] which one has the word
[1:23:44] which one's playing the word
[1:23:46] which one has the prophet's voice which
[1:23:49] one has the quotes which one has the
[1:23:51] books
[1:23:53] oh
[1:23:57] Thorne can't help being a thorn
[1:24:01] but can't help what they are
[1:24:03] but you can't judge it by the anointing
[1:24:08] you say is that the life yes it's the
[1:24:11] same life
[1:24:14] it gets the life but but and and I'm I'm
[1:24:18] happy they're fruitful in fact I'm happy
[1:24:20] they're drafted in that's what a
[1:24:22] Christian wants he wants all the life to
[1:24:24] go everywhere go into all the world and
[1:24:27] preach the gospel
[1:24:29] but remember this
[1:24:33] life
[1:24:35] is going to be Christ
[1:24:38] now
[1:24:39] just just listen to this real close
[1:24:42] again I'd like to just bring this up for
[1:24:45] my just for the God's word here
[1:24:53] what he says he says
[1:25:04] he says and then he brings up he says so
[1:25:07] when when these things are grafted in
[1:25:10] what did he say they're doing they're
[1:25:12] they're bearing false witness
[1:25:18] their their
[1:25:21] part of the message but they're bearing
[1:25:24] false witness to the message so in other
[1:25:26] words the lemon that comes out
[1:25:29] the fruit of the lemon is saying this
[1:25:32] tree is lemons
[1:25:34] this is what the tree but it's very
[1:25:37] false witness
[1:25:39] and then the other one comes up and it's
[1:25:41] producing grapefruit and therefore you
[1:25:43] go up to it you say this P the
[1:25:45] grapefruit he said this grapefruit is
[1:25:48] the fruit of the tree
[1:25:53] all grafted into the same thing
[1:25:56] all getting the same life The Same
[1:25:59] Spirit
[1:26:00] so
[1:26:03] you've got to
[1:26:05] so we got to come to that conclusion
[1:26:08] it's the same life
[1:26:11] but one has a different maturity it's
[1:26:15] called for a different election it
[1:26:17] called for a different purpose
[1:26:20] and
[1:26:22] and listen he says and Jesus said go
[1:26:24] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:26:27] to every branch
[1:26:30] in every tree that'll bring forth fruit
[1:26:33] every branch
[1:26:35] that
[1:26:37] that'll be in the tree and these signs
[1:26:40] shall follow the genuine branch
[1:26:43] where as long as it's a tree as long as
[1:26:46] it's putting forth branches to the end
[1:26:49] of the world in my name they shall cast
[1:26:52] out Devils speak with new tongues take
[1:26:55] up serpents drink deadly things lay
[1:26:57] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:26:59] see the hour that we're living in that
[1:27:02] word understands on the do you notice
[1:27:06] that for laying on of his the laying on
[1:27:09] of hands the preaching of the Gospel the
[1:27:13] casting out of devils every single one
[1:27:17] of those has to do with works
[1:27:21] and not worship
[1:27:29] very very plain
[1:27:32] because we don't want he said the reason
[1:27:34] that this is preached to end the
[1:27:37] confusion
[1:27:39] do you understand so so with that when
[1:27:45] we start going we don't look for
[1:27:47] something that's generated
[1:27:50] by worship we look for something that's
[1:27:54] generated by the word
[1:27:57] and there's my excitement is caused by
[1:27:59] the word of God
[1:28:02] I I'm gonna I don't Witness
[1:28:06] when I'm uh
[1:28:09] I don't come into you and witness Christ
[1:28:12] to you
[1:28:14] brother I want to introduce the prophet
[1:28:16] to you
[1:28:18] I don't I don't need to introduce the
[1:28:20] prophet to you I don't need to introduce
[1:28:22] the baptism of the Holy Ghost to you
[1:28:24] where do you do that
[1:28:27] where he told you to do it
[1:28:29] go into all the world and preach the
[1:28:32] gospel that's where these signs shall
[1:28:35] follow but if the branch that's grafted
[1:28:38] in
[1:28:39] is taking the life
[1:28:44] in that life's a Pentecostal life or a
[1:28:47] Catholic life or a Baptist life or a
[1:28:49] Methodist life
[1:28:51] then that's the natural fruits they're
[1:28:53] going to produce but this message is
[1:28:57] producing little Messiahs
[1:29:01] people that can take the resurrected
[1:29:04] power
[1:29:06] and meet the devil and cast them out
[1:29:12] can meet The Sinner
[1:29:14] and introduce him to Christ
[1:29:19] the rain falls under just in the unjust
[1:29:22] so to end up the bottom finest you'll go
[1:29:26] through this later as we go through it
[1:29:28] later you'll find out the only thing
[1:29:30] that separates them
[1:29:33] one has elected
[1:29:36] seed word
[1:29:38] only the elected of Abraham
[1:29:42] can go
[1:29:44] can you criticize it no
[1:29:47] because if you criticize it you're
[1:29:49] criticizing the life
[1:29:51] it's the same life it's the same
[1:29:55] anointing
[1:29:58] but the believer runs after the word
[1:30:03] word first
[1:30:06] then signs follow
[1:30:09] the word first and it it it's it's a a
[1:30:14] strong subject
[1:30:17] and he he brought it in many ways I
[1:30:19] think we touched on it and see does not
[1:30:22] air with the shock
[1:30:23] it was hard for that for that shock to
[1:30:26] give birth to the seed because it was
[1:30:29] the same life
[1:30:31] it's the same life it's the same spirit
[1:30:34] it's the same baptism
[1:30:39] under the same anointing
[1:30:42] praise God
[1:30:45] if don't be afraid of the anointing it's
[1:30:49] the same anointing
[1:30:51] the same anointing that night lemon was
[1:30:54] the same anointing that anointed the
[1:30:55] grapefruit
[1:30:58] the grapefruit rejoices and draws life
[1:31:01] Hallelujah produces grapefruit the lemon
[1:31:05] rejoices and Praises God and draws lemon
[1:31:09] don't be afraid to draw life
[1:31:13] but if you're from the root
[1:31:18] right you're from the beginning
[1:31:21] they're in the seed and you were
[1:31:24] ordained and elected for this day to
[1:31:27] come forth up through that everybody
[1:31:29] being crafted in and fellowshipping and
[1:31:31] coming to life but your calling and your
[1:31:34] election is to put forth another Christ
[1:31:39] little Messiahs
[1:31:43] with the power
[1:31:45] of the Resurrection word by revelation
[1:31:51] stimulation by revelation
[1:31:55] I don't particularly like lemons
[1:31:59] unless you put two pounds of sugar
[1:32:01] with it then it's pretty good
[1:32:06] I like grapefruit again but you have to
[1:32:09] add a lot of
[1:32:11] sugar
[1:32:13] other ones I just eat off the vine we
[1:32:16] can eat it all
[1:32:17] but what God's putting forth
[1:32:21] you understand it
[1:32:23] it is not what was grafted in before
[1:32:29] that's why he said you are different
[1:32:33] you are the elected life and I close
[1:32:38] with this statement because he says he
[1:32:43] he that is the elected life
[1:32:48] the predestinated life
[1:32:51] that's in me
[1:32:54] you are the elected life
[1:32:58] the predestinated life he said that's in
[1:33:02] me the life that's in him
[1:33:06] if the Same Spirit
[1:33:08] that dwelt in him
[1:33:12] dwelleth in you
[1:33:15] it shall also Quicken your mortal body
[1:33:18] this is about rapture
[1:33:21] this is about this age after the seals
[1:33:25] the resurrected life
[1:33:29] not the anointing not the rain we we
[1:33:33] rejoice in the rain hallelujah praise
[1:33:36] God for the rain when the rain comes
[1:33:39] bless God
[1:33:42] when Revelation comes raise your hand
[1:33:45] shout there's nothing restricting you
[1:33:47] and limiting you from shouting in the
[1:33:51] name of the Lord who's talking about
[1:33:53] money that means
[1:33:59] we can speak in tongues
[1:34:01] we can prophesy
[1:34:05] it don't do you no good let's lay hands
[1:34:07] on the sick also
[1:34:08] let's cast out Devils Also let's take up
[1:34:11] deadly things false doctrines false
[1:34:14] teachings false attitudes false spirits
[1:34:18] and not let him harm us
[1:34:24] but let's go to what our life source is
[1:34:29] Our Life Source isn't the rain
[1:34:33] Our Life Source the sun because we've
[1:34:36] come into that maturity
[1:34:39] so don't be shaken
[1:34:43] When You See It grafted in
[1:34:46] fruits
[1:34:50] foreign
[1:34:54] and you say well we don't have that
[1:34:57] fruit
[1:34:58] but we've got the life
[1:35:04] what am I I'm predestinated produce the
[1:35:08] life that was in the root
[1:35:13] so don't be confused
[1:35:16] that's why he said if I got to preach
[1:35:19] this he said so there won't be a
[1:35:21] confusion he says because this was going
[1:35:25] to happen
[1:35:27] at the end time
[1:35:29] after the seals
[1:35:33] there would rise in a group that was
[1:35:36] anointed living off the same life
[1:35:40] it's a sign
[1:35:45] that were at the end
[1:35:48] or it's a sign because remember they
[1:35:51] both ripen about the same time
[1:35:56] so whatever they are they're putting the
[1:35:59] first how many notice that they weren't
[1:36:00] of this message to begin with
[1:36:04] right Todd pruned them off
[1:36:07] there will be a lot of things that's
[1:36:08] been crafted in but you don't have to
[1:36:10] worry about that if you're part of the
[1:36:13] root
[1:36:15] and then you were before
[1:36:18] Geary and after
[1:36:22] and you will be part of the Resurrection
[1:36:26] don't shake don't bring those criticisms
[1:36:35] you know I'm a hundred percent okay you
[1:36:39] want gifts go read exactly how the
[1:36:41] prophet of God said that gift should
[1:36:44] work
[1:36:46] when's worship to come worship comes
[1:36:49] after the word
[1:36:52] you get in the spirit
[1:36:55] the piano don't get in the spirit the
[1:36:59] organ don't get in the spirit the music
[1:37:01] don't bring the spirit you know what
[1:37:03] really brings the spirit to a real
[1:37:06] genuine son and daughter of God it's the
[1:37:09] revelation of Jesus Christ making
[1:37:11] something known to him that's what will
[1:37:13] thrill you
[1:37:16] that's why I could sit down and listen
[1:37:18] to any man that preaches this message
[1:37:20] and read these quotes and if the word is
[1:37:24] what excites me
[1:37:29] okay
[1:37:30] if music excites you praise God Shout
[1:37:33] Hallelujah
[1:37:36] don't don't look at me if you can't
[1:37:39] raise your hands and worship and dance
[1:37:41] if you've got something going on between
[1:37:43] you and God
[1:37:46] but I'm telling you I am not holding you
[1:37:49] down
[1:37:50] but if it's the word is present
[1:37:53] because then it's got to be genuine
[1:37:57] it can't be grafted in
[1:38:01] I don't want something that's grafted
[1:38:05] do you want to be grafted in or do you
[1:38:07] want to be genuine I don't think I'm
[1:38:09] grafted
[1:38:13] I mean I just raised the rank singers
[1:38:15] sinner
[1:38:16] a really ranked singer too
[1:38:20] but I I just want the life of what this
[1:38:23] voice
[1:38:25] is trying to create
[1:38:27] and he's trying to create people that
[1:38:31] aren't relying
[1:38:34] on any feelings any emotions or any rain
[1:38:39] because they're the fruit themselves
[1:38:44] and in them they have every single
[1:38:48] predestinated power was in them in the
[1:38:52] beginning
[1:38:53] and the Son and the word has brought
[1:38:56] that forth forth and now it's a
[1:38:59] manifestation as we read last week he
[1:39:01] said this is the maturity the
[1:39:04] manifestation of the full word of God
[1:39:09] in the beginning the word was made flesh
[1:39:12] and now flesh is being made being made
[1:39:16] word
[1:39:18] but stay in the word and ripen
[1:39:23] just because grafted in branches are
[1:39:26] coming to maturity
[1:39:30] don't let that question
[1:39:33] Where You Are
[1:39:36] we love them all
[1:39:41] I love any Christian brother
[1:39:45] I love them all I love the spirit move
[1:39:47] wherever it moves
[1:39:51] but
[1:39:53] my lot
[1:39:56] is to be the
[1:39:58] genuine
[1:40:00] branch
[1:40:02] that comes off the original word seed
[1:40:06] so
[1:40:08] feel free
[1:40:10] in the spirit
[1:40:12] but let the word
[1:40:14] be what
[1:40:15] matures you
[1:40:18] and makes you and mold you and stay
[1:40:22] where the word is and as he'll go
[1:40:24] through here if you want to jump ahead
[1:40:26] in this book you'll see how he
[1:40:28] continually talks about the word how he
[1:40:30] continually talks about the son of man
[1:40:34] how he continually talks about what was
[1:40:37] to come in this day to cause this tree
[1:40:40] to put forth a new branch so don't be
[1:40:44] critical of anybody we don't compare
[1:40:47] ourselves with nobody we're not trying
[1:40:50] to act be like anybody compare ourselves
[1:40:53] there's only one thing that we know is
[1:40:56] we have a voice
[1:40:59] a message
[1:41:01] a word
[1:41:03] as brother Billy bought so beautiful
[1:41:05] today's his birthday I didn't know if he
[1:41:07] made it tonight or not but uh brother
[1:41:11] Billy's birthday so everybody texted him
[1:41:13] and wish him happy birthday and call him
[1:41:17] and uh and we got him a present from the
[1:41:20] church to him
[1:41:21] and uh but
[1:41:27] don't you you just don't have to
[1:41:32] be in conflict
[1:41:34] with anything
[1:41:36] you can be at peace
[1:41:38] and his brother Billy said I thought it
[1:41:40] was so beautiful he said when the word
[1:41:43] comes it has a faith
[1:41:47] and an anointing with it
[1:41:50] to bring it to pass
[1:41:53] I thought that was so beautiful
[1:41:56] so beautiful where we've even heard
[1:41:59] where is the anointing we know it's the
[1:42:01] anointed word we know where where the
[1:42:05] gospel is the anointing is
[1:42:09] and so we can get the same anointing
[1:42:11] from the word because that's what's in
[1:42:14] your heart and I I honestly believe if
[1:42:17] we could have confidence in our election
[1:42:20] and accept our election and accept what
[1:42:24] our calling is even though the fruit
[1:42:26] looks good even though it's got the same
[1:42:29] life we wait until he puts forth that
[1:42:34] branch and that's the branch that we
[1:42:37] want we want to put forth the fruits
[1:42:39] that are identical to his fruits where
[1:42:43] it's our it's not measured by worship
[1:42:48] and the prophet of God said the time
[1:42:50] will come where the church is measured
[1:42:52] by their
[1:42:53] worship
[1:42:55] but we want to be measured by our work
[1:42:57] show me your faith
[1:43:00] without your works
[1:43:02] and I'll show you my faith by my words
[1:43:06] I want to go to that next level
[1:43:09] where everyone in here sisters
[1:43:13] brother
[1:43:15] when you see your loved ones and they're
[1:43:18] ill you can go up to them and lay hands
[1:43:21] on them you say can a sister lay hands
[1:43:23] on a sister and pray for him certainly
[1:43:30] that when you know someone's got a demon
[1:43:33] you can sit down to him I talk to him
[1:43:35] about the love of Christ the power of
[1:43:38] the resurrection and pray them through
[1:43:42] go into all the world
[1:43:46] it isn't assemble yourselves
[1:43:51] it's going to all the world
[1:43:53] and preach the gospel
[1:43:55] and you'll find out you're anointed for
[1:43:59] it
[1:44:00] you're called for it you're chosen for
[1:44:03] it you're elected you are
[1:44:06] the last branch that the tree puts out
[1:44:11] and it'll have the true fruits of the
[1:44:14] Gospel amen Lord bless you
[1:44:18] let's Stand Together
[1:44:21] let the word stimulate you
[1:44:28] let the word stimulate you
[1:44:31] amen
[1:44:33] let's sing a song
[1:44:38] I'll wait for my Oregon player
[1:44:53] now Joy that's not a violin is it
[1:44:56] now what is it called
[1:44:59] a viola
[1:45:01] we have a viola player
[1:45:05] say if that don't make us top class
[1:45:08] okay I I I I I don't know what does do
[1:45:12] you uh-huh and we have John on guitar
[1:45:15] there and Joseph on the base and Michael
[1:45:19] on percussions
[1:45:21] all we need is a song leader in that
[1:45:23] right
[1:45:25] but other than that anyway let's say I
[1:45:28] am thinking of a rapture
[1:45:30] amen is anybody else thinking about a
[1:45:33] rapture
[1:45:34] amen I've changed
[1:45:38] that thrilled my heart
[1:45:41] he says when you see this grafting in
[1:45:43] when you see the church living by the
[1:45:46] same life when you see him manifesting
[1:45:49] Christ under the same anointing he said
[1:45:53] praise God it can only happen at the end
[1:45:57] time it's a sign
[1:45:59] that we're at the end
[1:46:01] it's a sign that the church is coming
[1:46:04] into maturity it's a sign oh praise God
[1:46:07] that we're fixing to go amen oh I am
