[23:40] Heat. Heat.
[24:48] Good morning. Let's stand this morning
[24:51] and
[24:54] approach the Lord in prayer.
[24:57] and certainly welcome everybody online.
[24:59] It's like the first COVID service we had
[25:05] when the government shut down our
[25:08] churches and I remember uh we of course
[25:12] next door and the police showed up our
[25:16] first service to count to make sure we
[25:19] didn't have any more than 10 people.
[25:23] But uh they allowed us to have a few
[25:26] more and uh and that's when we started
[25:30] our streaming and uh so we welcome all
[25:33] our streamers this morning and uh we're
[25:37] happy we have this service and uh
[25:40] there's many others that uh churches are
[25:44] closed down and they let us know that
[25:45] they're joining us this morning. So, we
[25:48] welcome uh those of you who are
[25:51] fellowshipping with us this morning
[25:53] because your churches are not open. Uh
[25:57] we uh certainly know how that feels and
[26:01] but we don't want you to forget that uh
[26:05] uh your church still needs your support
[26:08] and uh if you don't have service, set
[26:11] your offering aside, set your tithing
[26:13] aside so it doesn't become a whole lot.
[26:16] That's for all the churches, all those
[26:18] of you that are viewing in from other
[26:21] states and other places. Uh don't forget
[26:24] that the expenses continue to go on. And
[26:27] so make sure you help support your local
[26:30] assembly. So let's approach the Lord as
[26:33] one body. Those that are visiting with
[26:35] us this morning, uh our local assembly
[26:38] that's streaming, the handful that's
[26:41] here, looks like the upper room, about
[26:43] 12 of us or so. So, we're so wonderful
[26:46] for that. Let us pray. Our gracious
[26:49] heavenly father.
[26:52] Your loving kindness to us is
[26:54] unmeasurable.
[26:59] your fervent desire, Father, to bring us
[27:03] back to where we've come from.
[27:07] reveal yourself to us and have
[27:09] fellowship with us. Is
[27:14] it's something we can't comprehend that
[27:18] you would want to walk with man and love
[27:20] man and
[27:23] have fellowship with us, Father, with
[27:26] such the great sinners that we are.
[27:30] And yet you so loved us, you gave your
[27:33] only begotten son
[27:36] that the blood would be an eternal
[27:38] covering
[27:40] for our failures.
[27:43] And Lord, we have no righteousness to
[27:45] offer you. All of our righteousness is
[27:47] in your son, Christ Jesus.
[27:50] And we're here to exalt him this morning
[27:53] and lift him up.
[27:56] Father, we ask that your spirit would
[27:58] move within our hearts and
[28:02] the joy of the Lord would be our
[28:04] portion.
[28:06] And we never become discouraged
[28:09] or have doubt that you will not leave us
[28:12] nor forsake us, but that you'll be with
[28:16] us even in us till the end.
[28:19] Father, we may we never fear or doubt
[28:21] that you know exactly what we have need
[28:23] of even before we ask. and that you
[28:26] promised us to supply our every need.
[28:31] Father, may we never fear or doubt
[28:34] your undying love for us.
[28:38] And Father, we can't even begin to
[28:42] express
[28:44] our gratefulness.
[28:48] And we wonder, Father, at all that
[28:50] you've done on our behalf.
[28:54] And we worship you this morning.
[28:59] Heavenly Father is
[29:02] many are at home
[29:04] snowed in, iced in, Father, and
[29:10] they're joining us. May we feel the
[29:12] unity of your spirit this morning.
[29:16] May we feel the eternal presence of your
[29:18] word,
[29:20] how it's remained the same from the
[29:23] beginning of time to this very morning.
[29:29] And may the joy flood our souls to know
[29:33] that you have chosen us
[29:36] and that you call us your children
[29:40] and we can call you father.
[29:44] Thank you, Lord, and bless us this
[29:47] morning with worship in your word. For
[29:50] we ask it in the precious name of our
[29:54] Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[29:57] Amen. God bless you. We'll turn the
[30:00] service to Brother Billy. Lord willing,
[30:02] we'll be back next Sunday to minister.
[30:05] I'm just battling a little pneumonia,
[30:08] but uh we'll be able to go forward. God
[30:11] bless you, Brother Billy.
[30:16] Sometimes it's multitudes.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; That's exactly
[30:19] &gt;&gt; Sometimes a handful.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; But he's the same yesterday, today, and
[30:23] forever.

[46:36] that. May you just bring, Lord, your

[46:55] Lord. Dressed in your glory, Father.
[46:58] Lord, just being able to be risen up in
[47:00] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. That
[47:02] word that will never fail, Lord. The
[47:04] word that would always lift us up. The
[47:06] word that would always heal our heart.
[47:08] The word that would always take us out
[47:09] of a condition, Lord. the word that
[47:11] would always just put us in the place
[47:13] where you want us to be. Lord, I ask
[47:16] that you would just be able to have your
[47:17] way this morning. Bless the ones that
[47:19] made the sacrifice to come. May this
[47:21] just draw from you and pull upon the

[58:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, and all will sing. How great,
[58:20] how great

[58:26] Amen. Hallelujah. As you pray, let's
[58:28] just Lord Jesus, thank you.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, you said there were two or three
[58:32] are gathered in your name. Lord, that
[58:35] you'd be right here in our midst. And
[58:37] Lord, we're so thankful that you are not
[58:39] a man that you would lie. But Lord,
[58:42] there might just be of a few of us
[58:43] gathered here this morning. Lord, you're
[58:46] right here present with us. And Lord,
[58:48] for those that are gathered with us on
[58:50] the streaming, Lord, you're with them
[58:52] right there in their home. Lord, for you
[58:54] said, I'll be with you even in you until
[58:57] the end, Lord. So, we're just looking
[58:59] that you would come, Lord, in our
[59:01] humanity and in our mind, Lord. There
[59:03] would certainly be much negativity and
[59:06] things to discourage us and to hinder
[59:08] the service. But Lord, you're greater
[59:10] than all. Lord, how great you are, Lord.
[59:12] You're you're greater than anything in
[59:14] the world. You're greater than our
[59:15] doubts. You're greater than our fears.
[59:17] You're you're greater than our
[59:18] complexes. You're greater than our
[59:20] failures, Lord. You're greater than
[59:22] everything, Lord. And you said, "If I be
[59:24] lifted up, I will draw all men in, Lord.
[59:26] We just want to lift you up this
[59:27] morning." him. We invite you to come,
[59:29] Lord, in in a powerful way, Lord, for
[59:32] that you would meet a need and speak to
[59:33] somebody's heart, Lord. Father, we are
[59:36] not looking what man can do, but Father,
[59:38] we're looking past the veil and we're
[59:40] looking past the humanity this morning,
[59:42] Lord. And I'm asking, Lord, that you
[59:43] would come and do what only you can do,
[59:45] Lord. That you would just take the bread
[59:46] of life and you'd start to break the
[59:48] word and you'd speak to our heart, LORD.
[59:50] MAYBE THERE'S A LOST soul somewhere.
[59:52] Maybe somebody's trying to find their
[59:53] way and and they don't know who THEY
[59:55] ARE. LORD, MAY SOMETHING BE SAID,
[59:56] SOMETHING be done that would open their
[59:58] eyes, Lord, that that seed would be
[1:00:00] quickened, Lord. Maybe somebody's been
[1:00:02] pressing the battle for many years and
[1:00:04] they've come into A HARD SPOT AND THEY
[1:00:06] DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE THE NEXT move or
[1:00:07] make the next step, Father. But I'm
[1:00:09] asking that the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:11] would come and anoint your word and
[1:00:13] quicken that word to their heart, Lord,
[1:00:14] that they could step out in faith, Lord,
[1:00:16] and claim the victory. We love you,
[1:00:18] Lord. We just commit ourselves to you.
[1:00:20] Ask that you come now and just have your
[1:00:22] will and way in the service. In Jesus
[1:00:24] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:00:26] Amen. We'll just ask you to turn in your
[1:00:28] your Bibles.
[1:00:30] And we'll just be reading out of Luke
[1:00:32] 15:11. Amen. I just felt maybe to come
[1:00:35] down to uh to ground level here. And uh
[1:00:39] just feel a little bit more connected
[1:00:40] with you. I know in in small settings
[1:00:43] many times um that helps quite a bit
[1:00:46] because uh you you get maybe a little
[1:00:49] bit further away from the people and you
[1:00:50] feel a little bit more uh uh
[1:00:52] disconnected and so I feel if we can we
[1:00:55] if we can feel connected here we'll feel
[1:00:57] a little bit more connected through the
[1:00:58] stream anyways. So I say let's just have
[1:01:01] church.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. you know, I I don't know what's
[1:01:03] going to happen. And I I tell you what,
[1:01:05] part of me uh I I thought, well, I'll
[1:01:07] just play a tape, you know, I mean, I'll
[1:01:10] just play a tape and and uh we'll get
[1:01:12] the word and, you know, we'll we'll
[1:01:14] we'll we'll done well, but you know, I'm
[1:01:17] just I'm thankful we have a pastor and
[1:01:19] he felt led to have church and he felt
[1:01:21] led to ask me to preach and so I'm going
[1:01:24] to preach.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm glad you came here to pull
[1:01:28] because we know one thing that uh you're
[1:01:30] the one that operates the gift. And so
[1:01:32] sometimes it's in the small gatherings,
[1:01:34] you know, there's less there's less uh
[1:01:36] there's less baggage and less weight.
[1:01:38] You know, there's less to pull through.
[1:01:39] But hey, we'll just see what God God has
[1:01:41] in store. And if it's not maybe for
[1:01:43] somebody right here, we we pray God
[1:01:45] would go to those that are streaming
[1:01:47] online. So we're we're thankful that
[1:01:49] you've gathered with us and just pray
[1:01:51] that God would be your portion. So
[1:01:53] reading out of Luke 15 and and verse 11,
[1:01:57] Luke 15 and 11. And it says, "And he
[1:02:01] said, a certain man had two sons, and
[1:02:03] the younger of them said to his father,
[1:02:05] father, give me the portion of goods
[1:02:08] that
[1:02:10] fallth to me, and he divided unto them
[1:02:13] his living." And not many days after the
[1:02:15] younger son gathered alto together and
[1:02:17] took his journey in into a far country.
[1:02:20] And there wasted his substance with
[1:02:23] riotous living. And when he had spent
[1:02:25] all, there arose a mighty famine in the
[1:02:27] land. And he began to be in want. And he
[1:02:30] went and joined himself to a citizen of
[1:02:32] that country. And he sent him into his
[1:02:35] fields to feed the swine. And he would
[1:02:36] have fain have filled his belly with the
[1:02:39] husk that the swine did eat. and no man
[1:02:43] gave unto him. What a condition that
[1:02:44] this this son had found himself in.
[1:02:47] Isn't that something that he's in the
[1:02:49] pig pin now and he's going to be
[1:02:51] fighting with a with a pig over over
[1:02:54] some just husk that's been thrown out
[1:02:56] and no one will give unto him. What what
[1:02:58] a what a what a a miserable condition
[1:03:00] for a son of God to find himself in.
[1:03:04] And he says in verse 17, "And when he
[1:03:06] came to himself," he said, "How many
[1:03:09] hired servants of my father have bred
[1:03:11] enough to spare, and I perish with
[1:03:14] hunger? I will arise and go to my
[1:03:17] father, and I will say unto him, Father,
[1:03:20] I have sinned against heaven and before
[1:03:23] thee, and no more worthy to be called
[1:03:26] thy son. Make me as one of thy hired
[1:03:28] servants." And what did the father do?
[1:03:32] Did he did he did he tell him? You know,
[1:03:33] you know what? You're not even worthy to
[1:03:35] be my son. No. He said he arose and came
[1:03:38] to his father. But when his f when he
[1:03:40] was a great far off, oh, hallelujah.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; His father saw him. Amen. Do you know
[1:03:46] what it's like for the father to see a
[1:03:48] far off maybe way out there in some type
[1:03:50] of condition, you know, and he and he
[1:03:52] had compassion and ran
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; and fell on his neck and kissed him.
[1:03:58] Amen. You we just ask a blessing on the
[1:04:00] reading of the word. you may have your
[1:04:02] seat. Um, also just as I was in the back
[1:04:05] um there, I would I would feel that, you
[1:04:08] know, there's not too many uh there's
[1:04:10] just a few of us. So maybe maybe maybe
[1:04:13] this might be the time to be longer. I
[1:04:14] don't know. You know, hey, we there
[1:04:17] ain't nowhere to go. There ain't nothing
[1:04:18] to do. We're snowed in. So, uh, so I I
[1:04:21] say, let's just take our time. As I was
[1:04:23] there in the back, why don't you just
[1:04:24] turn over me within your Bibles to Luke
[1:04:27] 12? And this just as I was sitting back
[1:04:29] there uh just meditating on maybe how
[1:04:32] the Lord would go in the service uh and
[1:04:34] thinking of this son I I've been uh
[1:04:36] feeding on spiritual amnesia and
[1:04:38] certainly um what the if I could say the
[1:04:42] glasses I've been looking through I was
[1:04:44] listening to that is certainly within
[1:04:45] what our pastor has been preaching on
[1:04:48] about character and how he preached on
[1:04:50] on on unused promises and I I the way
[1:04:53] I've been looking through this a lot of
[1:04:55] that is in the spiritual amnesia of not
[1:04:58] recognizing who we are or what we have.
[1:05:00] Therefore, we never take advantage of or
[1:05:02] never manifest our character or or never
[1:05:04] move into the promises of God because uh
[1:05:06] there's something hindering us from
[1:05:08] having access or claiming or walking
[1:05:10] into it. A and and this might seem like
[1:05:13] a a hard hard press or tied together,
[1:05:15] but Luke 12 and 15. Is everybody there?
[1:05:20] Amen. I can't hear the Bibles turning at
[1:05:22] home, but I'm sure everybody at home got
[1:05:23] their Bibles out and and you're all
[1:05:26] supercharged and ready for service.
[1:05:28] Hallelujah.
[1:05:29] Praise the Lord. I I'll give you a
[1:05:31] moment to turn there, too. But I'm just
[1:05:33] reading out of Luke 12
[1:05:37] and verse 15. And it's picking up in the
[1:05:39] story where where Jesus is given the
[1:05:41] parable and he says and he said unto
[1:05:43] them take heed and beware of covetedness
[1:05:45] for a man's life consisteth not in the
[1:05:48] abundance of the things which he
[1:05:50] possess. Thank God. And he spake a
[1:05:53] parable of them saying the the ground of
[1:05:55] a certain rich man brought forth
[1:05:57] plentiful. And he thought within himself
[1:05:59] saying what shall I do because I have no
[1:06:01] room where to bestow my fruit. And he
[1:06:02] said this will I do. I will pull down my
[1:06:05] barns and build greater and there will I
[1:06:07] bestow all my fruit and all my goods and
[1:06:09] I will say to my soul soul.
[1:06:13] Have you ever done that?
[1:06:16] I I will Matthew you you just you're
[1:06:20] doing good. That's a great idea. You
[1:06:23] know you you just got it all. You know
[1:06:25] what? I'm a message believer.
[1:06:28] Come on.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; He says, "Soul, thou hast much goods
[1:06:32] laid up for many years. Take thine
[1:06:34] knees, eat, drink, and be married." I
[1:06:37] mean, hey, we're going in the rapture.
[1:06:39] We've received a prophet. I mean, let's
[1:06:42] take it easy.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; We can't miss it.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; I'm predestinated.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God said unto him, "Thou
[1:06:51] fool.
[1:06:52] This night thy soul shall be required of
[1:06:55] thee. Then who shall those things be
[1:06:58] which thou hast provided? A and it just
[1:07:01] struck me as I as I was I was just
[1:07:03] thinking about this and you know here in
[1:07:05] this moment
[1:07:08] this prodal son he came to himself
[1:07:11] and and maybe just looking at this other
[1:07:13] story in that moment here he thought
[1:07:15] well you know what I I'll just I'll just
[1:07:17] say unto myself so I'm I'm going to take
[1:07:19] it easy and and and and something that
[1:07:21] maybe for a title this morning I just
[1:07:23] want to title this living in the moment.
[1:07:26] living in the moment and just taking out
[1:07:29] of the text when it says uh that the
[1:07:32] prodical son he came to himself and
[1:07:34] brother Brandon would say this in the
[1:07:36] story uh he he he mentions at the very
[1:07:38] end of spiritual amnesia he starts to
[1:07:41] talk about how that soldier boy and and
[1:07:43] how he was on the the train and and they
[1:07:45] got shocked from war and they had
[1:07:47] spiritual amnesia and these guys they
[1:07:49] didn't know who they were they were I
[1:07:50] mean the bombs going off and maybe the
[1:07:52] trauma and everything that they saw they
[1:07:54] actually had an amnesia where they did
[1:07:56] not even know their name. They didn't
[1:07:57] know where they were from. And they came
[1:07:59] into a condition where no doubt they
[1:08:01] might not even know how to talk. They
[1:08:03] just stare at the wall. And and and and
[1:08:05] it shows this uh gives this picture of
[1:08:07] how the these soldiers they came to a
[1:08:10] place and they stopped and maybe there
[1:08:11] were some getting off or or they had to
[1:08:13] pick up some and they let these soldiers
[1:08:15] out for for a little a little break
[1:08:18] there. and a and and they would watch
[1:08:20] the soldiers and one of them he said he
[1:08:22] he he he got he got to to he he got to
[1:08:24] looking around and brother Brandon would
[1:08:26] say this in spiritual amnesia in
[1:08:28] paragraph 164 said they watched one
[1:08:31] young fellow there he got out and began
[1:08:33] to look around at that water tank. He
[1:08:36] looked all around over the hill and he
[1:08:38] he rubbed his face and he studied and he
[1:08:41] looked again and he seen that water
[1:08:44] tank. He looked all around at the
[1:08:47] station and he started walking
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; and instead OF THE GUARDS STOPPING HIM,
[1:08:51] he followed him and he went up over the
[1:08:53] hill and down a little path and he
[1:08:55] turned to the right and went up over
[1:08:56] another hill and he come to a little log
[1:08:59] cabin and he looked and coming out on
[1:09:01] the porch, an old man with a cane in his
[1:09:03] hand come out and throw his arms around
[1:09:05] him. He said, "My son, I know you would
[1:09:08] return. They told me YOU WERE DEAD, BUT
[1:09:10] I know you would return." And the boy
[1:09:12] come to himself.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; His amnesia left him.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; HE COULD IDENTIFY WHO HE WAS. HE KNOWED
[1:09:20] THAT WAS HIS FATHER.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET OF GOD WOULD SAY THIS,
[1:09:24] "OH SOLDIER OF THE CROSS THAT'S BEEN
[1:09:27] SHOCKED WITH SO MUCH TRAINING."
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; OH, look at how he lays that in. HE
[1:09:32] SAYS, "THAT'S BEEN SHOCKED WITH SO MUCH
[1:09:33] TRAINING." I I SAY SOMETIMES WE'RE
[1:09:35] SHOCKED WITH WITH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
[1:09:37] THE MESSAGE. I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS
[1:09:38] QUOTE FIT AND THAT QUOTE FIT AND I'M
[1:09:40] GOING TO BINGE LISTEN TO THE PROPHET.
[1:09:42] I'M GOING TO LISTEN TO ALL THE SEVEN
[1:09:43] SEALS and I'm going to listen ALL THE
[1:09:44] WAY TO CHRIST THE MYSTERY OF GOD
[1:09:46] REVEALED AND I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO THE
[1:09:47] HEBREW SERIES. Oh my, I'm going to start
[1:09:49] with faith AS A SUBSTANCE 47. I'M GOING
[1:09:51] TO LISTEN ALL THE WAY TO 65 BECAUSE MAN,
[1:09:53] I GOT TO FIGURE THIS THING OUT. And then
[1:09:55] YOU TRY TO TIE, OH, THIS IS WHAT BROTHER
[1:09:56] BRANDON MEANT AND THAT WHAT'S BROTHER
[1:09:58] BRANDON MEANT. AND THEN AND THEN YOU
[1:09:59] START OFF IN THIS TRAIL LIKE, MAN, THIS
[1:10:01] IS EXACTLY WHAT BROTHER BRANDON MEANT IN
[1:10:02] YOUR FELLOWSHIP. And then all a sudden
[1:10:03] another quote JUST TOTALLY TEARS DOWN
[1:10:05] YOUR WHOLE idea that you had. And you're
[1:10:07] like, "Okay, well that's not what this
[1:10:09] is what, brother Brandon MEANT." AND
[1:10:10] THEN THEY YOU START TO TRY TO EXPLAIN
[1:10:12] AWAY EVERYTHING YOU THOUGHT, but you're
[1:10:13] you're EXPLAINING AWAY QUOTES THAT YOU
[1:10:16] WERE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU YOU I DON'T
[1:10:17] EVEN KNOW WHAT I WHAT I BELIEVE. AND
[1:10:19] THEN YOU GET INTO A PLACE WHERE YOU YOU
[1:10:21] START GETTING DISCOURAGED THAT YOU DON'T
[1:10:22] FIT IN AND I YOU KNOW I MAYBE I ain't
[1:10:24] catching up and I ain't in tune and and
[1:10:26] ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GET TO A PLACE YOU
[1:10:28] BETTER BE CAREFUL. YOU MIGHT BE STARTING
[1:10:29] TO GET a little spiritual amnesia. Well,
[1:10:31] it really don't even matter. Why do I
[1:10:32] even listen to the tapes? Why do I even
[1:10:34] listen? And then you, if you're not
[1:10:36] careful, a little more amnesia, you'll
[1:10:38] start setting in just like, well, maybe
[1:10:39] I'm just a Christian. But training will
[1:10:42] do it.
[1:10:43] Help me out now.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Come on. Train. He says training. SO
[1:10:47] MUCH TRAINING. SO MANY SHOCKS OF
[1:10:49] DENOMINATION and creed and things of the
[1:10:51] world. Why don't you just step off for a
[1:10:54] few minutes and go to looking around at
[1:10:56] the Bible?
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Do we even do that anymore?
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Do do we even go to looking around in
[1:11:03] the Bible?
[1:11:06] Do we take our time and sit down and
[1:11:09] break out the Bible and say, "Lord
[1:11:11] Jesus, I want to look around a little
[1:11:14] bit and I want to find out more who you
[1:11:15] are, more of who I am, Lord. Give you
[1:11:18] give me some ammunition today.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to quench some fiery darts
[1:11:23] of the devil. I I want to be victorious,
[1:11:25] Lord. And I know it's through your
[1:11:26] word."
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Go to looking around in the Bible. might
[1:11:30] wander around and you might find
[1:11:32] yourself identified here in the word as
[1:11:34] a believer one of these days. He says
[1:11:37] you might not know him. You may come to
[1:11:40] yourself like the prodical son did and
[1:11:43] find yourself you might find your
[1:11:46] identification in the words of God. I I
[1:11:50] just want to say that that the word of
[1:11:52] God is your identification.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; The word of God is your everything. The
[1:11:56] word of God is it's your all and all. I
[1:11:58] mean, I it's your guide. It's your I
[1:12:00] it's your it's your leader. It's your
[1:12:02] shepherd. It's it's your absolute. It's
[1:12:04] your guarantee. The the word of God is
[1:12:06] everything. I mean, it's it's everything
[1:12:08] that you ever had need of. I mean, it's
[1:12:10] it's I don't know what else you're
[1:12:11] looking for, but I I I say it it's all
[1:12:13] that you need.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; And I say that's where I want to find my
[1:12:19] identification. That's where I want to
[1:12:20] find my absolute. That's that's where,
[1:12:22] you know, I I I want to put all of my
[1:12:24] hope and all of my trust. I WANT TO PUT
[1:12:26] IT INTO the word of God. AND I AND I
[1:12:28] KNOW THAT THE letter kleth, but it's the
[1:12:30] spirit that giveth life. I want that
[1:12:31] word to become alive in me. You know, I
[1:12:34] that that word strikes me, you know, a
[1:12:36] guarantee. You know, SO MANY TIMES YOU
[1:12:37] YOU MIGHT GO BUY A CAR OR YOU GO BUY
[1:12:40] SOMETHING AND AND SOMEBODY'S ALWAYS
[1:12:41] WANTING TO SELL YOU SOMETHING. You say,
[1:12:43] and they want to give YOU A GUARANTEE.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; WELL, I GUARANTEE you that you know that
[1:12:47] this thing will last for 10, 20 YEARS.
[1:12:50] WELL, I GUARANTEE you it probably won't
[1:12:52] if you keep using it. Yeah.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; And I think maybe the guarantee is is
[1:12:56] that they know a percentage of people
[1:12:58] will never take you up on the guarantee.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; You know, SOMETHING SAYS, "I GUARANTEE
[1:13:04] THIS FOR FOR FOR 20 YEARS, you know, AND
[1:13:06] IT BREAKS AFTER WE COME ON. I I'VE I'VE
[1:13:09] BOUGHTEN SOME RAKES AND SHOVELS AND THEY
[1:13:10] GOT GUARANTEES, you know, and the I you
[1:13:13] know, at least at least SOME OF THEM
[1:13:15] HAVE A WARRANTY,
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; you know, but it don't last too long.
[1:13:20] AND NOT MANY PEOPLE GO BACK AND TAKE UP
[1:13:22] ON THE WARRANTY,
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; MAN. So many PEOPLE GIVE A GUARANTEE AND
[1:13:27] YOU KNOW IT AIN'T guaranteed for
[1:13:28] nothing. I guarantee you that this last
[1:13:29] some people some people guarantee I'll
[1:13:31] do this and I'll do that. Well, you know
[1:13:33] what? You find out that man really can't
[1:13:35] guarantee much.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; I know one thing I can do is I can
[1:13:38] guarantee you that I'll fail you. I will
[1:13:40] let you down. I will make a promise. I
[1:13:43] will. Right. THAT'S ON THE HUMAN SIDE.
[1:13:45] BUT OH GOD, IF WE COULD EVER BE SO
[1:13:47] SURRENDERED TO THE HOLY Ghost that he
[1:13:49] can take control of our lives that we're
[1:13:51] that word that we're BELIEVING IN COMES
[1:13:53] FLESH in us and then therefore we can be
[1:13:55] an extended hand, we can be living in
[1:13:57] the moment, WE COULD BE CHRIST HAND
[1:13:59] EXTENDED.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; And just laying that principle in there,
[1:14:02] you know, THAT THAT WE WE MIGHT FIND OUR
[1:14:04] IDENTIFICATION in the word. And and I
[1:14:06] just want to pick up second Peter
[1:14:08] chapter 1, if you'll turn there with me.
[1:14:11] Amen. Maybe everybody got their coffee
[1:14:13] and you know, they're they're settled in
[1:14:15] and and uh you know, I I I'm I'm sure uh
[1:14:19] there's not anything else going on in in
[1:14:21] the house and you're focused and in
[1:14:24] tune. Praise the Lord. We can we can get
[1:14:27] on here and see how many people are
[1:14:29] streamed in and watching and hallelujah.
[1:14:32] Praise the Lord. I hope you're warm and
[1:14:36] not cold and and everybody here, you're
[1:14:39] doing well. Praise God. All right.
[1:14:41] Second Peter 1 3. Are are we doing okay?
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; All right. According as his divine power
[1:14:48] hath given unto us all things that
[1:14:50] pertain unto life and godliness through
[1:14:52] the knowledge of him that hath called us
[1:14:54] to glory and virtue. Aren't you so
[1:14:57] thankful for that? My my what a promise.
[1:15:00] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:15:02] great and precious promises that we
[1:15:05] might just sit around,
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; that we might just pat ourselves on the
[1:15:10] back.
[1:15:12] That we might say, "I've arrived.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; I might say to myself, soul,
[1:15:17] I'm doing pretty good.
[1:15:20] I can take it easy." No. that by these
[1:15:23] ye might be partakers of the divine
[1:15:26] nature, having escaped the corruption
[1:15:28] that is in the world through lust. You
[1:15:30] know, you know, uh uh uh uh so many
[1:15:32] times we just want to look at all the
[1:15:33] the all the mountain tops, but you know,
[1:15:36] HAVING DIVINE NATURE HAS A lot of
[1:15:37] valleys
[1:15:39] a and and I just where I would just kind
[1:15:41] of uh uh bring back to our remembrance,
[1:15:43] you know, our pastor was preaching on
[1:15:45] unused promises and he was he he
[1:15:48] referenced this scripture how that it's
[1:15:50] by these promises that we are made
[1:15:52] partakers of divine nature. And if we
[1:15:55] are IF WE ARE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE and
[1:15:57] manifesting the promises that that give
[1:16:00] us and make us partakers of divine
[1:16:02] nature, then we're leaving the divine
[1:16:04] NATURE AND CHARACTER OF GOD UNDISPLAYED.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; AND I tell you, that should be the
[1:16:09] heart's cry of the believer in the day
[1:16:11] and hour that we're living in is we want
[1:16:13] the message of the hour to become so
[1:16:15] flesh in us that IT'S THE VERY DIVINE
[1:16:18] nature and character of God THAT IS THAT
[1:16:21] HAS COME AND TABERNACLED HIMSELF IN OUR
[1:16:23] LIVES. AND DON'T FORGET THE TITLE. I'M
[1:16:25] TALKING ABOUT LIVING in the moment. That
[1:16:27] every moment is an OPPORTUNITY THAT THE
[1:16:30] DIVINE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF GOD MIGHT
[1:16:33] BE EXPRESSED IN YOUR LIFE AND your
[1:16:35] situation. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE
[1:16:36] WASHING DISHES, sweeping the floor, if
[1:16:38] you're going to work. You know,
[1:16:40] EVERYTHING WE DO OUGHT TO BE DONE UNTO
[1:16:42] THE LORD. YOU KNOW, I I ALWAYS REMEMBER,
[1:16:44] YOU KNOW, I HAD A JOB WORKING at
[1:16:45] McDonald's when I was 15 years old. And
[1:16:48] and you know, and and and and I you
[1:16:50] amazing to me, it takes 10 people now to
[1:16:52] do the job, but one person did. I I mean
[1:16:54] I ran the register. I I did the lobby. I
[1:16:56] wiped down the tables. I changed out the
[1:16:58] trash. You know, MCDONALD'S TOLD ME HOW
[1:16:59] TO TIE A TRASH bag around a trash can.
[1:17:02] You know, those things are very useful.
[1:17:03] I say if you AIN'T GOT A JOB, GO TO
[1:17:05] MCDONALD'S. THEY'LL PROBABLY HIRE YOU.
[1:17:06] IT'S A GOOD place to work. But you know,
[1:17:08] SO MANY TIMES WE LET PRIDE GET IN FRONT.
[1:17:10] MY SOUL SAITH TO MYSELF, I SHALL NEVER
[1:17:12] WORK AT MCDONALD'S because
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; you never know that might be a good
[1:17:19] career for you. Right.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; I mean, we sometimes we just GET TOO
[1:17:23] MUCH PRIDE IN OUR WAY. BUT I SAY IF GOD
[1:17:24] MAKE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU AND TO GIVE
[1:17:26] YOU A JOB, YOU MIGHT FIND A SOUL. YOU
[1:17:28] MIGHT GET THE LA, HEY, THAT LAST ONE
[1:17:30] MIGHT BE THE COOK AT MCDONALD'S. LET'S
[1:17:32] GO HOME. LET'S GET OUR PRIDE OUT THERE.
[1:17:34] QUIT SAYING TO YOUR SOUL, I I YOU KNOW,
[1:17:36] I YOU KNOW, I'VE DONE WELL. NO, I TELL
[1:17:39] YOU WHAT, WE OUGHT TO UH LEAVE THOSE
[1:17:40] THINGS WHICH ARE BEHIND BEHIND and press
[1:17:42] towards the mark OF THE HIGH CALLING OF
[1:17:44] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:49] Where were we? Divine nature. We we we
[1:17:52] want TO MANIFEST THAT DIVINE NATURE IN
[1:17:55] in everything that we do. And we want to
[1:17:56] be living in that moment.
[1:17:59] and every moment whether whether it's a
[1:18:01] job at McDonald's or or whether it's
[1:18:02] listen I remember I worked at McDonald's
[1:18:04] there and and you know I'd be having TO
[1:18:06] GET IN UNDER YOU KNOW under the uh climb
[1:18:09] into the bench and there's some dirty
[1:18:11] nasty
[1:18:13] cheeseburger
[1:18:14] crunched down with ketchup all over in
[1:18:16] the corner of the wall and I could just
[1:18:18] skip it
[1:18:22] but you KNOW I ALWAYS THOUGHT WHAT
[1:18:23] HAPPENS IF SOMEBODY'S WATCHING ME I
[1:18:26] ALWAYS HAD THAT THOUGHT
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; I I wasn't even, you know, I AT THE TIME
[1:18:31] 15 THAT is right around, you know, where
[1:18:33] really I GOT A LITTLE SPIRITUAL amnesia
[1:18:35] uh in this message. You know, I I've
[1:18:37] I've mentioned it before where when you
[1:18:39] get uh when you get caught between two
[1:18:40] opinions, you lose your reason. You
[1:18:42] know, I don't want to get into all that,
[1:18:43] but one day I USED TO TELL EVERYBODY WHY
[1:18:45] I DIDN'T do everything. And and then one
[1:18:47] day they asked me, "Why don't you do do
[1:18:49] it?" And I gave the wrong answer. I
[1:18:50] said, "Well, it makes you cough." And I
[1:18:51] said, "Well, that was THE WRONG REASON."
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; NO, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS WE DON'T DO
[1:18:55] BECAUSE WE'RE A CHRISTIAN. THERE'S
[1:18:56] CERTAIN THINGS WE DON'T DO BECAUSE WE'RE
[1:18:57] A BELIEVER. THERE ARE CERTAIN PLACES WE
[1:18:59] DON'T GO CUZ WE'RE A BELIEVER. THERE'S
[1:19:00] CERTAIN MUSIC WE DON'T LISTEN TO BECAUSE
[1:19:01] WE'RE A BELIEVER. AND I SAY THERE OUGHT
[1:19:03] TO BE SOME YOUNG PEOPLE WHO GOT A
[1:19:04] BACKBONE ENOUGH WHEN YOU'RE HANGING out
[1:19:06] with a youth group and they're listening
[1:19:07] to Tik Toks and INSTAGRAMS AND ALL THESE
[1:19:09] THINGS. THAT OUGHT TO BE SOMEBODY WHO
[1:19:10] WHO WHO AIN'T GOT SPIRITUAL AMNESIA THAT
[1:19:12] SAYS, "I KNOW I'M A SON AND A DAUGHTER
[1:19:14] OF GOD AND I GOT TO DISPLAY THE DIVINE
[1:19:16] NATURE OF ALMIGHTY GOD AND SAY,
[1:19:18] "BROTHERS, SISTERS, I DON'T THINK WE
[1:19:20] OUGHT TO LISTEN TO THAT. I I KNOW IT'S
[1:19:21] FUNNY. I KNOW IT'S A GOOD LAUGH, BUT YOU
[1:19:23] KNOW WHAT? I DON'T THINK IT'S PLEASING
[1:19:24] TO OUR LORD. I SAY THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES
[1:19:26] FOR EACH ONE OF US TO DISPLAY THE
[1:19:28] CHARACTER, THE DIVINE NATURE OF ALMIGHTY
[1:19:30] GOD,
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; you know, and and and AND WITH THAT
[1:19:33] THOUGHT IN MY MIND, YOU KNOW WHAT I
[1:19:35] WOULD DO? I' it would help me to do my
[1:19:37] job better.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; You know, I was like, you know what?
[1:19:40] I'LL GO THE EXTRA MILE. I'LL RE I'LL
[1:19:42] CLEAN IT UP. YOU KNOW, CUZ IF SOMEBODY'S
[1:19:44] WATCHING ME, WELL, I DIDN'T I DIDN'T
[1:19:45] KNOW THERE IN THAT SPIRITUAL REALM THAT
[1:19:47] I HAVE A HEAVENLY FATHER WHO'S WATCHING
[1:19:49] ME. HE'S WATCHING ALL OVER MY LIFE. AND
[1:19:51] IT COULD BE IN THE VERY LITTLE THINGS OF
[1:19:53] REACHING A LITTLE BIT FURTHER JUST TO
[1:19:55] PICK UP A LITTLE BIT MORE. YOU LITTLE
[1:19:56] KIDS. OH, MAYBE NOT TOO MANY OF YOU
[1:19:58] HERE, BUT HOPEFULLY YOU'RE STREAMING
[1:20:00] ONLINE AND YOU AIN'T OUT MAKING
[1:20:01] SNOWMANS. I WANT TO TELL YOU, YOU KNOW,
[1:20:02] YOU CAN PICK UP THE TRASH FOR YOUR MOMMY
[1:20:04] AND DADDY, YOU YOU YOU YOU CAN YOU CAN
[1:20:07] TRY TO HELP THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE OH, I
[1:20:08] WANT TO TELL YOU, IT'S SUCH AN AWESOME
[1:20:10] THING WHEN YOU'RE LITTLE KIDS. I CAN
[1:20:11] TELL YOU, THEY CAN BE 5 YEARS OLD, 6
[1:20:13] YEARS OLD, SEVEN YEARS. I DON'T CARE.
[1:20:14] THEY BE 14 OR 15. YOU KNOW, THEY CAN
[1:20:16] HELP THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE HOME. YOU
[1:20:18] YOUNG KIDS, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN HELP
[1:20:19] CHANGE THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE HOME. MOMMY
[1:20:21] AND DADDY COULD BE HAVING A HARD TIME.
[1:20:23] YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ALL THE PRESSURE
[1:20:24] AND THE BILLS AND AND THEY'RE WONDERING
[1:20:26] HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PAY THE RENT AND
[1:20:27] ALL THESE THINGS AND THE KIDS ARE ARE
[1:20:28] FUSSING AND FIGHTING. OH, I SAY THERE
[1:20:30] OUGHT TO BE A 12YEAR-OLD OR A
[1:20:31] 14-YEAR-OLD SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT, MOMMY?
[1:20:33] EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. I
[1:20:35] KNOW GOD IS IN TOTAL CONTROL. I'VE NEVER
[1:20:37] SEEN THE RIGHTEOUS FORSAKEN OR BEGGING."
[1:20:39] I WANT TO TELL YOU, GOD WANTS TO EXPRESS
[1:20:41] THE DIVINE NATURE OF ALMIGHTY GOD IN
[1:20:43] EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US. I DON'T CARE HOW
[1:20:45] YOUNG YOU ARE. YOU MIGHT BE FOUR, YOU
[1:20:47] MIGHT BE FIVE, YOU MIGHT BE 10, YOU
[1:20:48] MIGHT BE 60, YOU MIGHT BE 80. BUT I WANT
[1:20:50] TO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S PEOPLE THAT HAVE
[1:20:52] COME IN CONTACT WITH THE HOLY GHOST AND
[1:20:54] FIRE AND THEIR LIFE IS SO SOLD OUT,
[1:20:56] LOCK, STOCK, AND BARREL THAT THE HOLY
[1:20:58] GHOST AND FIRE IS JUST OOZING OUT
[1:21:00] THROUGH THEIR LIFE IN OUR 13 YEAR OLDS
[1:21:02] AND OUR 15 YEAR OLDS AND THEY CAN
[1:21:04] EXPRESS THE DIVINE NATURE OF ALMIGHTY
[1:21:06] GOD.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; OH, I say, LORD JESUS, HELP US IN THE
[1:21:11] I'M TALKING ABOUT LIVING IN THE MOMENT,
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Let's live in the moment right now.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Let's have church. AMEN.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; LET'S THANK GOD FOR HIS GRACE AND FOR
[1:21:22] HIS MERCY. SAY, "OH, GOD, I WANT THAT
[1:21:25] DIVINE NATURE living in me."
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just laying a LITTLE BIT OF A
[1:21:29] FOUNDATION to work towards a a point by
[1:21:31] the help of God.
[1:21:33] You know, we're such a small group. We
[1:21:34] can even have an intermission maybe.
[1:21:37] You know, tell the people at home
[1:21:38] because, you know, they're taking
[1:21:39] intermissions like all the time. You
[1:21:41] know, up and down. Hey, it's all right.
[1:21:44] We're going to have church.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; You know, I've been there. I've
[1:21:46] streamed. I've done both. I've got my
[1:21:49] suit on and my tie and I sat down and I
[1:21:52] amened
[1:21:55] and I've done that
[1:21:57] and then I I've done it where I didn't
[1:21:59] get all suited up and you know I'm sure
[1:22:03] we have a mixture this morning
[1:22:06] but that's okay. The important thing is
[1:22:07] that we're hearing the word of God
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; and faith comes by
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; hearing the word.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's what we want to do is we
[1:22:15] want to hear the word of God and we want
[1:22:17] to put that word of God into action and
[1:22:19] we want to manifest the the the the
[1:22:22] attributes and the character of almighty
[1:22:24] God. So we're talking about living in
[1:22:26] the moment.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when this prodal son he came to
[1:22:30] himself just think about this now here
[1:22:33] here is this prodal son and now he's had
[1:22:36] spiritual amnesia. Now, I don't know if
[1:22:39] any of you have been in a in a in a pig
[1:22:41] pin before, but maybe I don't know if
[1:22:43] you ever gotten stuck in any mud, but
[1:22:44] just think about a dirty, stinky,
[1:22:46] rotten, smelly uh huh pig pin and it's
[1:22:49] it's all muddy and and and oh, it just
[1:22:51] stinks and it's foul and you you've been
[1:22:54] trying in that mess to to eat on some
[1:22:56] old corn uh uh husk and everything. And
[1:22:59] all of a sudden, in that moment, he
[1:23:01] realizes,
[1:23:03] "What am I doing?"
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He looks at his condition.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; He's muddy. He's stinky.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; But when HE COMES TO HIMSELF, WHAT DOES
[1:23:14] HE SAY? YOU know what? I'm going to go
[1:23:17] home.
[1:23:20] And in that moment, YOU KNOW WHAT HE HAS
[1:23:22] TO DO?
[1:23:24] Living in that moment, he doesn't say,
[1:23:26] "Well, you know what? I don't look like
[1:23:28] a son. I don't smell like a son.
[1:23:32] No one would even think that I'm a son
[1:23:35] of a father like that.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; But you know what he had to do? He had
[1:23:39] to start to walk out
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; of his condition.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; He had to start to walk out of that pig
[1:23:47] pin. And a lot of times we find
[1:23:49] ourselves in a mess.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; And in the moment we made a mistake that
[1:23:53] got us there.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU THERE'S ANOTHER
[1:23:56] MOMENT. AND that moment IS WHEN YOU COME
[1:23:58] TO YOURSELF AND YOU SAY YOU I'M A SON OF
[1:24:00] GOD. I SAY THAT'S THE TIME TO START
[1:24:02] WALKING OUT OF THAT SITUATION. WALKING
[1:24:06] OUT OF THE PIG PIN. START WALKING OUT.
[1:24:09] COULD YOU IMAGINE? HERE HE STARTS
[1:24:10] WALKING OUT OF THE PIG PIN AND HE GETS
[1:24:12] OUT OF THERE. NOW HE'S WALKING THROUGH
[1:24:13] THE FIELD AND AND MAYBE THE MAN THAT
[1:24:15] HIRED HIM SAID, "HEY, WHERE ARE YOU
[1:24:16] GOING?" HE SAID, "I'M GOING HOME TO MY
[1:24:19] FATHER'S HOUSE." YOU FATHER'S HOUSE.
[1:24:21] HE'S LIKE, "YEAH, MY FATHER'S HOUSE,
[1:24:22] MAN." I mean, like he got a a million of
[1:24:26] what you got.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; I don't even KNOW WHY I MEET YOU. OH, MY
[1:24:30] FATHER OWNS A CATTLE ON A THOUSAND
[1:24:32] HILLS. You
[1:24:35] You mean you're TRYING TO TELL ME YOU
[1:24:37] HAVE A DADDY THAT'S RICHER THAN ME?
[1:24:40] You don't You don't look like you could
[1:24:41] have a daddy RICHER THAN ME. YOU KNOW,
[1:24:42] YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAD A FATHER LIKE THAT,
[1:24:44] YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER GOTTEN YOURSELF IN
[1:24:46] THAT SITUATION.
[1:24:47] I tell YOU WHAT, DON'T YOU DON'T YOU ALL
[1:24:50] YOU GOT TO SAY IS, "HEY, IF YOU EVER
[1:24:52] NEED HELP, I WANT TO TELL YOU I GOT A
[1:24:54] FATHER THAT CAN HELP YOU." YOU JUST KEEP
[1:24:55] WALKING.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; LIKE THAT LIKE THAT THAT THAT LIKE THAT
[1:24:58] SOLDIER BOY. HE SAW THE WATER TOWER. YOU
[1:25:00] KNOW, JUST STAY ON THE PATH. JUST KEEP
[1:25:03] WHERE ARE YOU GOING, BOY? WHAT DO YOU
[1:25:04] THINK YOU'RE DOING? WHY DON'T YOU COME
[1:25:05] ASIDE? COME HERE. YOU KNOW YOU'RE OUT OF
[1:25:07] THE PIG PIN NOW. YOU DON'T NEED TO GO
[1:25:09] ALL THE WAY BACK THERE. WE GOT A LITTLE
[1:25:10] SOMETHING FOR YOU. I DON'T STOP. KEEP
[1:25:12] WALKING. KEEP GOING. THE WORD IS YOUR
[1:25:14] GUIDE.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; I YOU MIGHT NOT LOOK LIKE A SON. YOU YOU
[1:25:20] MIGHT NOT SMELL LIKE A SON.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; But you're a son and daughter of God.
[1:25:27] And in one moment YOU MIGHT HAVE MADE A
[1:25:29] BAD DECISION. IN ONE MOMENT YOU MIGHT
[1:25:31] COME TO YOURSELF AND REALIZE I'M IN A
[1:25:32] PIG. BUT I WANT TO SAY IT'S WHAT YOU DO
[1:25:34] LIVING IN THE MOMENT.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Where are you GOING TO SET YOUR
[1:25:37] AFFECTIONS? WHAT DIRECTION ARE YOU GOING
[1:25:39] TO GO? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO LAUNCH? ARE
[1:25:41] YOU JUST GOING TO STAY THERE AND HAVE A
[1:25:42] PITY PARTY? OR ARE YOU GOING TO SAY,
[1:25:44] "YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M TIRED OF BEING IN
[1:25:45] THE PIG PEN.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; I'M A SON OF GOD. I AIN'T GOING TO STAY
[1:25:47] HERE ANYMORE. WHERE YOU GOING? I'M GOING
[1:25:49] HOME.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; SHUT UP, DEVIL. I AIN'T I'M GOING HOME."
[1:25:51] WELL, YOU CAN'T GO BACK THERE. YOU
[1:25:53] SMELL. I DON'T CARE. I'M GOING BACK TO
[1:25:54] MY I'LL LET HIM TELL ME WHAT I SMELL
[1:25:56] LIKE.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Some of US WANT TO CLEAN OURSELVES ALL
[1:25:59] UP AND MAKE OURSELVES CLEAN ENOUGH FOR
[1:26:01] GOD. YOU CAN'T DO IT. YOU CANNOT GET
[1:26:03] CLEAN ENOUGH TO WALK INTO HIS PRESENCE.
[1:26:05] BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN COME INTO HIS
[1:26:06] PRESENCE AND HE'LL WASH YOU. HE'LL CLEAN
[1:26:09] YOU. HE'LL HEAL YOU. HE HE'LL CLEAN YOU
[1:26:12] ALL UP. HE'LL LOVE YOU. HE'LL PUT A ROBE
[1:26:14] ON YOU.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; We're talking about living in the
[1:26:19] moment, sir.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; I say keep going. STAY ON THE PATH.
[1:26:24] AND JUST THINKING ABOUT THAT, RIGHT? YOU
[1:26:26] KNOW, uh uh uh uh what was it? HE WAS
[1:26:29] COMING TO HIMSELF. AND I BELIEVE THAT
[1:26:30] that that there's a SEED ON THE INSIDE
[1:26:32] OF EVERY BELIEVER and and and and that
[1:26:34] and God is wanting THE WORD TO COME AND
[1:26:36] the spirit to come and and anoint that
[1:26:38] seed and quicken that seed and and BRING
[1:26:40] IT TO LIFE AND IT SPRING UP and start to
[1:26:43] manifest itself.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; And I believe that he wants to do that
[1:26:47] in every day. that I I DON'T WANT THIS
[1:26:50] SERVICE THIS MORNING JUST TO just to be
[1:26:52] a service where we did our duty. That's
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; All right. Let's let's get let's get
[1:26:57] home cooking. MAY MAYBE IT'S US RIGHT
[1:26:59] HERE. MAYBE IT'S ONE OUT THERE. But but
[1:27:01] but I DON'T WANT TO JUST PAT MYSELF ON
[1:27:03] THE BACK AND I SAY, "OH, SO I'M A
[1:27:05] MESSAGE BELIEVER, BUT LORD, IN THE
[1:27:07] MOMENT, in every day, every hour, I want
[1:27:11] to express
[1:27:13] your divine nature. I I want your
[1:27:15] character to be on full display.
[1:27:18] AND MANY TIMES WHAT WE FIND OUT WE
[1:27:20] SHOULD BE COMING DOWN TO THE FINETUNING,
[1:27:22] THE FINE HONING. WE OUGHT TO BE MATURE
[1:27:24] uh sons AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. WE OUR
[1:27:27] LIVES WE WE SHOULD WE WE'RE JUSTIFIED.
[1:27:29] WE'RE SANCTIFIED. WE'RE FILLED WITH THE
[1:27:31] HOLY GHOST. AND NOW WE'RE MOVING INTO
[1:27:32] ALL THE PROMISES OF GOD. THE THE
[1:27:34] CAPSTONE IS SETTLING DOWN UPON OUR LIVES
[1:27:36] WHERE OUR ACTIONS ARE HIS ACTIONS. We're
[1:27:39] coming into adoption, RIGHT? WHERE MY
[1:27:41] THE STEP I TAKE IS THE STEP HE WANTS ME
[1:27:43] TO TAKE. THE WORD THAT I SAY IS THE WORD
[1:27:45] THAT HE WANTS ME TO SAY. AMEN.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Do we get it right every time?
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; See, I'm talking about living in the
[1:27:54] moment.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; And many times we'll feel an uncction of
[1:27:57] the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; You know, call so and so and see how
[1:28:02] they're doing. I I I usually if it's
[1:28:05] positive
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; and and will further THE KINGDOM OF GOD
[1:28:10] AND HELP SOMEBODY OUT,
[1:28:12] THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT'S GOD.
[1:28:15] BUT THE OTHER THOUGHT IS WELL YOU KNOW
[1:28:17] THEY probably are busy
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; and many times in the I'm TALKING ABOUT
[1:28:22] LIVING IN THE MOMENT
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; MANY TIMES WE DISMISS the uncction.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Many times we're WE'RE WE'RE SOMEWHERE
[1:28:31] AND SOMETHING IN US YOU FEEL IT WELL
[1:28:32] enough
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; and I the ONLY ONE SAYS I I SHOULD TELL
[1:28:35] THEM THAT GOD SENT A prophet
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; and AND IT'S BUILDING UP. YOU KNOW, YOU
[1:28:40] YOU'RE WANTING TO DO IT AND AND AND AND
[1:28:42] YOU YOU feel like, okay, and then
[1:28:44] something happens, SOMETHING CHANGES,
[1:28:46] LIKE, WELL, I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. AND
[1:28:47] THEY GO
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; and then you feel disappointed.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Maybe. Was that the Holy Ghost? Was that
[1:28:55] GOD WANTING TO EXPRESS HIS CHARACTER?
[1:28:57] WAS THAT THE DIVINE NATURE WANTING TO
[1:28:59] shine out
[1:29:01] and witness and minister?
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about living in the moment.
[1:29:05] Amen.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Help me out now.
[1:29:08] So, Brother Brandon would say this,
[1:29:10] "What was the Holy Ghost given for?" HE
[1:29:12] SAYS, "THE HOLY GHOST WILL FOLLOW GOD'S
[1:29:14] word to the letter." And and a preacher
[1:29:17] behind THE PULPIT THAT AIN'T GOT GRACE
[1:29:19] ENOUGH TO PREACH IT. I DOUBT HE'S GOT
[1:29:21] IT. THAT'S JUST EXACTLY WELL, THAT'S
[1:29:23] WHAT THE HOLY GHOST is for. It's to give
[1:29:27] to give uncction to the preacher. It's
[1:29:28] to give holiness to the group. IT'S TO
[1:29:30] SET THE CHURCH IN ORDER. IT'S TO BRING A
[1:29:33] unity of spirit. It's to unite us
[1:29:36] together with power. IT'S TO UNITE US
[1:29:38] TOGETHER WITH LOVE. BROTHERLY LOVE.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; But sometimes we don't get it right. Is
[1:29:49] it too loud for y'all?
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; Is it all right?
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; It's loud. It's louder now with 20
[1:29:54] people than it is with 400.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; But that's all right if it ain't too
[1:29:58] loud for you. WE DON'T ALWAYS GET IT
[1:30:01] RIGHT.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; BUT THEN NOW I'M TALKING ABOUT LIVING IN
[1:30:04] THE MOMENT. You're living in the moment
[1:30:05] and you make a bad decision
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; now. YOU CAN TRY YOU CAN STAY IN THAT
[1:30:10] moment
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; and just waddle around in your in your
[1:30:14] bad decision
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; right
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; but I WANT TO SAY YOU GOT ANOTHER moment
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; right
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; now. I just want to LOOK AT AN EXAMPLE
[1:30:21] in scripture real quick. Just thinking
[1:30:22] about living in the moment. I I MEAN
[1:30:24] JUST UH MAYBE IF YOU'LL TURN IN YOUR
[1:30:26] BIBLES to to Matthew 16. We just have a
[1:30:29] little Bible study here.
[1:30:32] enjoy ourselves in the presence of God.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Is that Is anybody warm?
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Is it Is it warm in here? It's too warm
[1:30:44] in here. That That is Is it too warm in
[1:30:46] here? This is the only time we can ever
[1:30:48] do this.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Cuz I am warm.
[1:30:54] Hallelujah. We're warm, brother.
[1:30:57] Now, everybody, this is the one time you
[1:30:59] can touch the thermostat because you're
[1:31:00] at home.
[1:31:03] Hallelujah.
[1:31:05] All right.
[1:31:07] Matthew
[1:31:09] 16. Was it that where we're at?
[1:31:12] Okay. I did plug it in here. Matthew 16
[1:31:14] and 17. Now, let's just look at this. I
[1:31:17] was just thinking about Peter, right?
[1:31:20] Says, "And Jesus answered and said unto
[1:31:22] them, blessed art thou, Simon Barjonah,
[1:31:25] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[1:31:27] unto you, but my father which is in
[1:31:29] heaven. And I also SAY UNTO THEE, THOU
[1:31:32] ART PETER, and upon this rock I will
[1:31:35] build my church, and the gates of hell
[1:31:36] shall not prevail against it, and I will
[1:31:38] give unto thee the keys of the kingdom
[1:31:40] of heaven, and whatsoever you bind on
[1:31:42] earth shall be bound in heaven, and
[1:31:43] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[1:31:45] shall be loosed in heaven.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; I say Peter must have been a flying
[1:31:48] high.
[1:31:50] Maybe Peter looked over at James and
[1:31:52] John and said, "Uh-huh.
[1:31:54] Told you.
[1:31:57] I mean, Peter, you know, I mean, come
[1:32:00] on. You know, that must have felt good.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; I mean, he got it right.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; How and OH, YOU TALK ABOUT BEING
[1:32:07] VINDICATED.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Here's the son of MAN TELLING HIM
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; YOU GOT THE right revelation.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; And I want to You want TO KNOW HOW YOU
[1:32:14] GOT THE RIGHT REVELATION IS WHEN YOU
[1:32:15] HAVE THE REVELATION of the son of man.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; And any revelation outside of that is
[1:32:21] the wrong revelation.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; And here the SON OF MAN IS TELLING HIM,
[1:32:25] "WHO DO YOU SAY THAT I AM?" HE SAYS,
[1:32:26] "Thou art the Christ, the son of the
[1:32:28] living God." AND HE SAID, "PETER, FLESH
[1:32:31] and blood didn't reveal that to you."
[1:32:33] Even even, it's amazing what revelation
[1:32:35] is because it goes beyond the flesh.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; But he was he was making SURE THAT WE
[1:32:40] UNDERSTOOD. IT WASN'T ABOUT YOUR
[1:32:41] CALCULATION. It wasn't about what you
[1:32:43] witnessed. IT WASN'T ABOUT SEEING THIS
[1:32:45] PICTURE OVER HERE. AND IT WASN'T ABOUT,
[1:32:47] OH, YOU KNOW, I SAW THE PICTURE OF THE
[1:32:49] CLOUD IN 1950 and and and then then they
[1:32:51] they TOOK ANOTHER PICTURE IN IN FEBRUARY
[1:32:53] 28TH AND AND I HEARD THIS TESTIMONY AND
[1:32:56] I HEARD THAT TESTIMONY AND I SEEN ALL
[1:32:58] THESE MIRACLES AND YOU KNOW, BY ALL OF
[1:32:59] THAT I KNOW. NOPE.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; NOPE.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; The only way you know is is if it's
[1:33:07] given to you to know.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; I'm starting to feel a LITTLE GOOD THIS
[1:33:12] MORNING CUZ IT AIN'T ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU
[1:33:14] CAN CALCULATE. IT AIN'T ABOUT HOW MANY
[1:33:16] MESSAGES YOU CAN LISTEN TO. IT AIN'T
[1:33:18] ABOUT HOW MUCH MATERIAL YOU CAN GATHER
[1:33:20] TOGETHER. IT AIN'T ABOUT VINDICATING the
[1:33:22] message. You think WE WERE PUT HERE TO
[1:33:24] VINDICATE the message intellectually by
[1:33:26] WHAT WE COULD FIGURE OUT AND WHAT WE CAN
[1:33:28] LISTEN TO. THE ONLY WAY WE CAN VINDICATE
[1:33:30] THE MESSAGE IF IS IF WE SAY I BELIEVE
[1:33:32] the message AND THAT WORD THAT WE AMEN
[1:33:34] BECOMES FLESH IN YOU. AND NOW THE WORD
[1:33:37] THAT WAS PREACHED THROUGH A VINDICATED
[1:33:38] PROPHET HAS TAKEN ON FLESH IN YOUR BODY.
[1:33:41] AND NOW YOU ARE THE VINDICATION. YOU ARE
[1:33:44] HIS VICTORY BECAUSE NOW THAT WORD HAS
[1:33:46] TAKEN ON FLESH IN A MANY MEMBER BRIDE
[1:33:48] BODY.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT IT HAS TO be a
[1:33:52] revelation.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; And here Peter in that MOMENT I MEAN MY
[1:33:59] hallelujah the seven seals are revealed.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW HE HE GOT THIS HE'S FLYING HIGH
[1:34:05] right
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; and now
[1:34:10] then verse 20. Are we okay? We have we
[1:34:13] we doing all right.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; THEN HE CHARGED HIS DISCIPLES THAT THEY
[1:34:16] SHOULD TELL NO MAN THAT HE WAS Jesus
[1:34:18] Christ. From that time forth be he he
[1:34:21] began to show unto his disciples
[1:34:24] how that he must go unto Jerusalem and
[1:34:28] suffer many things of the elders and
[1:34:30] chief priests and scribes
[1:34:32] and be killed and be raised up again on
[1:34:35] the third day.
[1:34:38] And Peter
[1:34:40] to James. Hey guys, you hearing this?
[1:34:45] Our our Lord, our Christ,
[1:34:48] they're not going to surely they're not
[1:34:50] going to kill you.
[1:34:52] Matter of fact, you know, I'm on the
[1:34:54] mountaintop.
[1:34:56] I got the revelation.
[1:35:00] Lord,
[1:35:02] you don't you don't you don't got to
[1:35:06] look at this 22.
[1:35:08] Then Peter took him and began to rebuke
[1:35:11] him.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; And that's what happens sometimes if
[1:35:15] you're not careful on the mountaintop.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; He might forget your place.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; And he began to REBUKE HIM, SAYING, "BE
[1:35:24] IT FIRE FOR ME, LORD. THIS SHALL NOT BE
[1:35:26] UNTO THEE."
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Maybe he looked at Peter and James again
[1:35:29] and went, "Uh-huh.
[1:35:33] Come on. our Lord, the Messiah. This is
[1:35:38] we know he's going to totally expunge
[1:35:40] the Romans and and he's going to give us
[1:35:42] back to the kingdom and he called us and
[1:35:44] and there's no way he's going to go far
[1:35:46] be it from you, Lord, to fulfill what
[1:35:47] you've come to fulfill.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Uhoh.
[1:35:53] Does that happen in our own lives
[1:35:55] through trials and difficulties and and
[1:35:57] molding of character and the expression
[1:36:00] of the divine nature? We come into
[1:36:02] trials and we come into situations and
[1:36:04] we try TO REBUKE THE TRIAL WHEN GOD IS
[1:36:07] WANTING the trial to BRING OUT A
[1:36:08] CHRISTLIKE CHARACTER.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; LOOK, if if if you if you live if you
[1:36:15] live in the moment WHEN I AND WHAT I
[1:36:17] MEAN BY THAT IS it has TO BE THE HOLY
[1:36:19] GHOST living out through you. It has to
[1:36:21] be a surrender TO THE HOLY GHOST. IT HAS
[1:36:23] TO BE ANCHORED IN THE WORD OF GOD. WHEN
[1:36:25] YOU DON'T FEEL IT, WHEN YOU CAN'T UN
[1:36:27] EXPLAIN IT, WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO LOSE
[1:36:29] YOUR MIND, THERE THERE'S SOMETHING
[1:36:30] DEEPER, A DEEP SETTLED PIECE IN THE
[1:36:32] SOUL, THERE'S A REVELATION LIKE JOB THAT
[1:36:34] CAN SAY, "THOUGH HE SLAY ME, YET I'LL
[1:36:36] TRUST HIM. I KNOW THAT I'LL STAND ON THE
[1:36:38] EARTH AND I SHALL SEE MY REDEEMER." WHY?
[1:36:41] BECAUSE YOU GOT A REVELATION. THAT'S HOW
[1:36:42] YOU LIVE IN THE MOMENT IS BY REVELATION.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; And Peter wasn't living by that re
[1:36:49] revelation. Now
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; what WHAT DOES JESUS GO TO SAY? HE
[1:36:55] TURNED UNTO Peter and said, "GET THEE
[1:36:58] BEHIND ME, SATAN.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Thou art an offense unto me, for thou
[1:37:03] savorest not the things that be of God,
[1:37:08] but those that be of men."
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; You talk about
[1:37:14] once you're on the mountaintop
[1:37:17] and now you being in the gutter.
[1:37:19] He wasn't look HE WASN'T LOOKING AT
[1:37:21] JAMES AND JOHN GOING, "UH-HUH."
[1:37:24] WAIT, WHAT? What'd he say?
[1:37:27] I I'm tell I'm I'm I'm leaving church.
[1:37:29] I'm out of Did you hear what the pastor
[1:37:30] said about me?
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; I'm out of here. I'm telling you. You
[1:37:33] talk about THE EMBARRASSMENT. ONCE HE'S
[1:37:35] UP THERE on the mountaintop, once he's
[1:37:37] feeling good, you I got the I GOT THE
[1:37:39] REVELATION. HALLELUJAH. GOD SENT A
[1:37:40] PROPHET. IT'S THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:37:42] I'M GOING IN THE RAPTURE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:44] AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE SETTING OUT
[1:37:46] AND AND YOU'RE WANTING TO TO DO WHAT'S
[1:37:48] RIGHT AND SAY THE RIGHT THINGS AND ALL
[1:37:50] OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE REBUKED.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; OH, OUCH. GET BEHIND ME, SATAN. IF YOU
[1:37:55] HAD THE HOLY GHOST, YOU WOULD NEVER DO A
[1:37:57] THING LIKE THAT. YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER
[1:37:58] ACTED LIKE THAT. AND AND and oh my, ALL
[1:38:01] OF A SUDDEN, YOU KNOW, YOU YOU FAILED
[1:38:03] AGAIN AND YOU MET YOU'RE BACK IN THE PIG
[1:38:05] PIN.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; I tell you what, now all of a sudden,
[1:38:09] Peter in this moment,
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; he's no longer on THE MOUNTAINTOP. HE'S
[1:38:12] HE'S REBUKED. HE he he he's low down and
[1:38:16] did he did he just say Satan? And I
[1:38:19] don't know about YOU, BUT I I TRY TO PUT
[1:38:20] MYSELF in this situation.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; This was an open rebuke.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; And Peter, maybe he was I don't know,
[1:38:28] BUT PETER MIGHT, LIKE I SAID, HE
[1:38:29] PROBABLY WAS FEELING PRETTY GOOD about
[1:38:30] himself. You know,
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; I got it right. Hallelujah. I got the
[1:38:33] revelation OF THE HOUR. AND SOMEHOW HE
[1:38:35] GOT TO A PLACE WHERE HE WOULD ACTUALLY
[1:38:37] REBUKE the Lord. HERE THE LORD'S TELLING
[1:38:40] YOU, HEY, THIS IS WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you, I'LL JUST LAY
[1:38:46] THIS IN THERE, THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US A
[1:38:48] FIVE-FOLD MINISTRY. GOD HAS GIVEN US A
[1:38:51] PASTOR. AND IT'S TO LEAD, it's to guide,
[1:38:53] IT'S I IT'S IT'S BY THE UNCCTION OF THE
[1:38:55] HOLY GHOST. AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL IF
[1:38:58] YOU SIT ON THE WORD OF God
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; and you think you got a way and you GOT
[1:39:03] THIS OR THAT, YOU YOU'LL FIND OUT YOU'RE
[1:39:05] GOING TO BE IN ONE MOMENT YOU'RE GOING
[1:39:06] TO BE FEELING PRETTY GOOD IN THE NEXT
[1:39:07] MOMENT YOU'RE GOING TO BE REBUKED. I CAN
[1:39:09] TELL YOU MANY times I I you know growing
[1:39:12] up and and and and uh you know hear
[1:39:14] hearing the word come forth and and and
[1:39:16] you know and a BROTHER A BROTHER WOULD
[1:39:17] SAY SOMETHING AND YOU KIND OF GO LIKE I
[1:39:20] REMEMBER WITH MY brother Aaron you know
[1:39:21] he'd be PREACHING AND HE WOULD SAY
[1:39:23] SOMETHING AND I learned just WAIT CUZ I
[1:39:26] GUARANTEE HE GOING TO BACK IT UP WITH a
[1:39:27] quote. He's g right. AND EVERY TIME I
[1:39:31] maybe hear something, I'd be like,
[1:39:32] "Huh?" And then lay it right in there,
[1:39:35] quote, scripture, quote, word, and I'm
[1:39:37] like, "Okay, THERE IT IS." YOU KNOW, IF
[1:39:39] YOU IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, IF YOU SIT,
[1:39:41] YOU TRY TO SIT BACK LIKE WE GOT IT ALL
[1:39:42] FIGURED OUT. I WAS HAVING SOME
[1:39:44] FELLOWSHIP WITH WITH OUR PASTOR HERE, I
[1:39:46] BELIEVE LAST NIGHT WITH brother David
[1:39:47] and and and and BROTHER UH DAVID WAS
[1:39:50] TALKING ABOUT HOW uh uh uh uh well, now
[1:39:53] I'm talking about my dad. So, Pastor
[1:39:55] Brother David Dad
[1:39:57] and uh he SAID, "YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE
[1:40:00] THEY'RE THEY'RE listening when they
[1:40:02] listen to the word, they're listening
[1:40:04] for you to vindicate what they know."
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; He he called them vindicators. So then
[1:40:11] everything that you say AND YOU DO IS
[1:40:13] JUST GOING TO VINDICATE THEM and what
[1:40:14] they already know. Just like one time, I
[1:40:17] BELIEVE MY DAD, I I BELIEVE IT WAS MY
[1:40:18] DAD, HE WAS WITNESSING TO SOMEBODY AND
[1:40:21] HE STARTED TO TELL HIM ABOUT MALACHI 4:5
[1:40:23] AND LUKE 17:30 AND HE AND HE AND HE WAS
[1:40:25] LAYING OUT ALL THE SCRIPTURES AND ALL
[1:40:27] THE GUY SAID, "GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[1:40:30] HALLELUJAH." AND MAYBE MY DAD AND
[1:40:32] THEY'RE SAYING, "MY GOODNESS, HE'S
[1:40:33] REALLY CATCHY." HE GOES, "I'VE NEVER
[1:40:35] HEARD A BETTER DESCRIPTION OF MY
[1:40:37] MINISTRY IN ALL OF MY LIFE."
[1:40:44] a vindicator. BUT I SAY WE OUGHT TO COME
[1:40:47] TO CHURCH in the moment. Living in the
[1:40:50] moment, Lord, speak to me. This is a
[1:40:52] house of correction, LORD. LORD, MAYBE I
[1:40:54] DON'T SEE EYE TO EYE WITH THE BROTHER,
[1:40:55] LORD, BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT HE IS A
[1:40:57] BROTHER IN CHRIST. I DO BELIEVE THERE'S
[1:40:58] a gift there. AND AND LORD, MAY I LOOK
[1:41:00] PAST THE VEIL THIS MORNING, LORD, MAY
[1:41:02] YOU SPEAK TO ME IN MY LIFE AND SPEAK TO
[1:41:04] ME IN MY CONDITION. I WANT TO TELL YOU,
[1:41:05] A LOT OF TIMES WE DO THE CHURCH AND WE
[1:41:07] DO OUR FAMILY A LOT OF DISSERVICE WHEN
[1:41:09] WE DON'T SUPPORT THE MINISTRY. BECAUSE
[1:41:11] LOOK EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO TO ELISHA
[1:41:14] AND ALL THEM KIDS. I BELIEVE IT WAS 40
[1:41:15] KIDS THAT GOT WHY WERE THEY MAKING FUN
[1:41:17] OF ELISHA? I WONDER IF IT DIDN'T START
[1:41:19] IN THE HOME.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; I wonder if them kids weren't MAKING FUN
[1:41:25] OF ELISHA BECAUSE OF THEIR PARENTS. AND
[1:41:27] A LOT OF TIMES THE THINGS WE TALK ABOUT
[1:41:28] IN OUR HOME,
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; you better BE CAREFUL. THIS THIS JUST
[1:41:33] HAPPENED UH RECENTLY. UH SOMETHING WAS
[1:41:36] BEING SAID IN FRONT OF MY daughters
[1:41:39] that that that would would would WOULD
[1:41:42] BREAK the the uh uh um what what's that?
[1:41:46] The influence of a ministry for them. I
[1:41:50] WE GOT TO BE CAREFUL. WE MIGHT NOT SEE
[1:41:53] EYE TO EYE WITH EVERYBODY, BUT I SAY
[1:41:55] THERE OUGHT TO BE SUCH A BROTHERLY LOVE
[1:41:58] THAT THAT WE GOT TO GET OVER OUR LABELS
[1:42:00] AND GET OVER uh being vindicators and
[1:42:03] well, THEY DON'T DO IT THE WAY WE WE DO
[1:42:05] THINGS. SO, SO YOU KNOW WHAT? WE JUST
[1:42:07] WON'T HAVE FELLOWSHIP WITH THEM. SHAME
[1:42:09] ON YOU. THAT'S A REBUKE IN THE NAME OF
[1:42:11] THE LORD. THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; WE SHOULD BE WE WE SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH
[1:42:15] BACKBONE AND HOLY GHOST ABOUT US TO BE
[1:42:17] ABLE TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER AND AND QUIT
[1:42:19] LABELING EVERYBODY AND LABELING THEM
[1:42:21] THIS AND LABELING THEM THAT. AND THEN
[1:42:23] NOWADAYS, YOU KNOW WHAT? I TELL YOU WHAT
[1:42:24] HAPPENED TO ME. I WENT ON A TRIP HERE
[1:42:26] RECENTLY ON BUSINESS AND AND UH YOU
[1:42:29] KNOW, they gave me an electric car and I
[1:42:31] told them I didn't want an electric car.
[1:42:33] if you are if you get anything out of
[1:42:35] this service, IF YOU EVER TRAVEL AND
[1:42:37] THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A RENTAL CAR,
[1:42:39] DON'T LET IT be electric.
[1:42:42] And one brother in the back says,
[1:42:43] "Amen."
[1:42:46] AND GUESS WHAT? HE GUARANTEED ME.
[1:42:51] You you you will get 250 miles.
[1:42:56] And I said, "Well, you know, I really,
[1:42:58] you know, sir, I want a gas car." But
[1:43:01] and the only reason I was dealing with
[1:43:02] dollars because Avis the only thing they
[1:43:04] had for me was a 15 passenger van. So if
[1:43:07] YOU GET ANY REVELATION out of the
[1:43:08] service, IF YOU GOT A CHOICE BETWEEN A
[1:43:10] 15 PASSENGER VAN or a little electric
[1:43:12] sedan, take the 15 passenger gas
[1:43:15] vehicle.
[1:43:17] Hallelujah.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; Take the name of Jesus with you. We've
[1:43:21] had a successful service.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; BUT SURE ENOUGH, he gave me the
[1:43:25] guarantee. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I'M
[1:43:26] LIKE, WELL, WELL, I'm only going 70
[1:43:28] miles. OH, YOU'LL GET 250 MI. AND YOU
[1:43:31] KNOW WHAT? You don't even have to put
[1:43:32] gas in that thing. If you if you return
[1:43:33] this thing with 10% battery, you don't
[1:43:37] have to charge it.
[1:43:41] Well, what do you got gas? LIKE, WELL,
[1:43:42] WE'RE PRETTY MUCH OUT of everything. And
[1:43:44] then the other stuff we have is a big
[1:43:45] upgrade.
[1:43:46] All right. All right. I'm in Ohio. It's
[1:43:51] cold electric vehicle. So, I do a little
[1:43:53] research and Okay, fine. I'll take the
[1:43:56] electric vehicle. And I tell you, I get
[1:43:58] in this electric vehicle and starting
[1:44:00] it, you don't know if it's started or
[1:44:01] not. You don't know where to start it.
[1:44:03] You don't know where you're hitting the
[1:44:04] button. And you start driving that you
[1:44:06] don't know if you're dragging somebody
[1:44:07] under their car or if that's what an
[1:44:09] electric vehicle sounds like. So, it's
[1:44:11] two degrees outside and you're jumping
[1:44:13] out and you're looking under the car and
[1:44:14] YOU'RE TRYING WHAT IS THAT? I GUESS
[1:44:16] THAT'S WHAT ELECTRICAL VEHICLES DO.
[1:44:20] SO, I FINALLY LIKE, WELL, YOU KNOW, I
[1:44:21] WANT TO GO BACK IN, BUT IT'S 12:30 at
[1:44:23] night and I'm like, I got class in the
[1:44:25] morning at 8:00 AND I MIGHT AS WELL JUST
[1:44:27] GET ON THE ROAD. I GOT A GUARANTEE.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; SO, I GET ON THE ROAD AND I'M DRIVING
[1:44:32] AND AND AND YOU know what? That thing
[1:44:34] didn't have 100% battery when I started.
[1:44:38] Had 80%. But I doing the math, 80%. If I
[1:44:40] got back, I should be fine. It's saying
[1:44:42] right there, well, I got, you know what?
[1:44:44] you know, I mean, it doesn't say I got
[1:44:46] 250 mi, but it says I got about a 180
[1:44:48] mi, 170 mi, and and I'm thinking, well,
[1:44:51] I'm 70 80 miles there, and you know, at
[1:44:52] least I can charge somewhere in in the
[1:44:54] meantime, but I GOT A GUARANTEE. AND I
[1:44:56] GET ON THAT ROAD AND I'M DRIVING, and I
[1:44:58] tell you what, they they when THEY
[1:44:59] FACTORED THEIR 250 MPH, THEY DIDN'T TELL
[1:45:02] ME THAT'S IN PRIME CONDITIONS GOING
[1:45:04] downhill
[1:45:07] with a breeze.
[1:45:11] AND I'M WATCHING 180, 160. I'M NOT EVEN
[1:45:14] TO MY destination
[1:45:16] and I GOT 40 MILES LEFT. AND I'M PULLING
[1:45:20] IN. WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE FOR A MINUTE.
[1:45:22] I DON'T KNOW HOW WE GOT here and how
[1:45:23] we're going to get out of here, but
[1:45:24] we'll we'll GET THERE. AND SO I I'M I'M
[1:45:26] PULLING UP AND I'M LIKE, "OKAY, NOW IT'S
[1:45:28] 12:30, 1:00 AT NIGHT. LAST THING I WANT
[1:45:30] TO DO IS TRY TO CHARGE A battery in the
[1:45:31] morning to get to my class. I don't want
[1:45:33] to be stranded out in Ohio. It's 5
[1:45:35] degrees out here." So I pull up to his
[1:45:36] ch charging port. I find a charging
[1:45:38] port. I drive five minutes. I drive 5
[1:45:40] miles or 5 minutes. I find this charging
[1:45:43] port. It's freezing cold. I plug that
[1:45:44] thing in and I'm watching it and I'm
[1:45:47] like, it sure doesn't seem like it's
[1:45:48] doing anything. Maybe I need to turn it
[1:45:50] off and sit here and freeze.
[1:45:53] So, I charge this thing for 40 minutes
[1:45:56] and I'm like, I'm done. It's 1:00, 1:30.
[1:45:58] I got to class. At least if anything, I
[1:45:59] can get to the class in the morning. And
[1:46:01] I start to drive back and I realized I
[1:46:03] accomplished one thing. I got enough
[1:46:05] charge
[1:46:07] to cover the five miles it took me to
[1:46:08] get back to the hotel. I was right back
[1:46:10] where I started with an hour less time.
[1:46:13] And when I plugged that thing in, it
[1:46:14] said, "Your car will be fully charged at
[1:46:16] 11:30 a.m. Look, I can't sleep in my
[1:46:18] car. I got to go to class." But I TELL
[1:46:21] YOU WHAT, THAT'LL HAPPEN. THAT'LL THAT'S
[1:46:22] WHAT HAPPENS IN IN IN GUARANTEES.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; You know, it did not work out the way
[1:46:28] that I wanted it to work out. All right.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; So, however we got here, if anybody
[1:46:33] doesn't know, just don't get an an
[1:46:36] electric car. You want a gas car.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; But I tell you what, WE WERE TALKING
[1:46:40] ABOUT PETER ONE TIME ON THE MOUNTAINTOP.
[1:46:42] HE AND THE NEXT MOMENT HE he he's in the
[1:46:44] gutter and and uh you know, SOMETIMES I
[1:46:47] I WE WERE TALKING ABOUT, you know, uh uh
[1:46:49] uh you don't want to make FUN OF OF
[1:46:50] MINISTRY. YOU could be in a place TO
[1:46:52] WHERE UH YOUR YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER MIGHT
[1:46:54] BE IN A PLACE WHERE THEY NEED
[1:46:56] DELIVERANCE.
[1:46:58] And if you've been discouraging OR
[1:46:59] LABELING, YOU BETTER FIND OUT YOU MIGHT
[1:47:01] HAVE AFFECTED THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THE
[1:47:03] MINISTRY. I say IT'S WE AS PARENTS, WE
[1:47:06] SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL IN HOW WE TALK
[1:47:08] ABOUT one another
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; because then we get attitudes and WE GET
[1:47:12] COMPLEXES. AND AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S
[1:47:14] EXACTLY UH uh uh what Revelations 3:19
[1:47:17] SAID. IT SAYS, "AS MANY AS I LOVE, I
[1:47:19] REBUKE AND CHASEN. BE ZEALOUS,
[1:47:21] THEREFORE, and repent." Amen.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; If you're wrong, what should you do?
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Repent.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brad, I'M EVEN TALKING ABOUT
[1:47:35] THAT'S WHAT THE WORD SAYS. IT SAYS, "BE
[1:47:36] ZEALOUS." THEREFORE, HE SAID GOD IS
[1:47:38] CALLING for another zeal. And what is
[1:47:39] that zeal to say? I'm wrong.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; And and when I'm talking about living in
[1:47:43] the moment, if I can say IT LIKE THIS,
[1:47:45] OKAY, I'VE MADE A DECISION. I've had an
[1:47:47] attitude. I've done SOMETHING THAT WAS
[1:47:50] WRONG. IN THAT MOMENT, I've done
[1:47:52] something or now I've BEEN MADE AWARE OF
[1:47:54] SOMETHING THAT I GOT TO repent for.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; What are you going to do in the moment?
[1:47:59] Now,
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; NOW YOU HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT. NOW, YOU
[1:48:02] CAN JUST SAY, "LORD, I'M SORRY. LORD,
[1:48:04] FORGIVE ME. BE ZEALOUS. THEREFORE,
[1:48:06] REPENT." YOU KNOW, SAY I'M WRONG. MAKE
[1:48:08] IT RIGHT. BROTHER BRANDHAM said in the
[1:48:10] church book, HE SAID HE KNOWS HOW TO
[1:48:11] ENCOURAGE US IN THE RIGHT MATTERS AND
[1:48:13] discourage us in the wrong matters. He
[1:48:15] said, "We can learn a lot about HOW TO
[1:48:17] RUN OUR FAMILIES AND RUN run our
[1:48:19] churches and and just to kind of work
[1:48:22] work towards a close." Peter was always
[1:48:25] getting himself in trouble,
[1:48:28] but he had a revelation.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; But he was always getting himself in
[1:48:32] trouble. But he had a revelation.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; But he he was always getting himself in
[1:48:38] trouble. Does that sound famili? I don't
[1:48:40] know about you, but I I feel like Peter
[1:48:42] a lot.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:48:45] That's right.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; You know, you preach and uh God, you
[1:48:49] know, we have powerful meetings and and
[1:48:51] and and my and then, you know, it's like
[1:48:53] a lot of times they say, you know, you
[1:48:55] you you feel like a mouse preparing. You
[1:48:57] you feel like a lion preaching and you
[1:48:58] feel like a worm when you're done. You
[1:49:01] know, just give me my the darkest,
[1:49:02] deepest hole to crawl into and I don't
[1:49:04] want to see the sun for 10 days. You
[1:49:06] know, and it's in those times if you're
[1:49:07] not careful, you get a little amnesia.
[1:49:09] uh you know, you know, you start to feel
[1:49:11] a little bad and you start to feel this
[1:49:13] and that, you know, and and and but but
[1:49:15] we want to be zealous, therefore, and
[1:49:17] say, "I'm wrong." And Peter, you know,
[1:49:18] he's up on the mountain top, down the
[1:49:19] valley, up on the mountain, down the
[1:49:21] valley. And and but he had a revelation,
[1:49:23] and I JUST WANT TO POINT THIS out uh as
[1:49:25] we we try to move towards a close by the
[1:49:27] help of God. But the one thing that I
[1:49:30] love about Peter is he did have, who do
[1:49:32] you say that I am? And I want to tell
[1:49:34] you if if if something in your soul has
[1:49:36] been quickened that you know that that
[1:49:38] the message of the hour is the truth and
[1:49:40] that God s sent a prophet a and you know
[1:49:43] THAT THAT'S GOD'S PROVIDED way in the
[1:49:45] end time that that there is a promise
[1:49:47] for the age, right? We are we have been
[1:49:48] given great and PRECIOUS PROMISES THAT
[1:49:50] WE MIGHT BE PARTAKERS OF DIVINE NATURE.
[1:49:54] And I believe we've seen divine nature
[1:49:56] on display through a vindicated prophet
[1:49:59] WHO WAS A BROTHER JUST LIKE YOU AND I
[1:50:01] WHO HAD problems who was up on the
[1:50:03] mountain was down in the valley. HE WAS
[1:50:05] A SINNER SAVED BY GRACE. HE HE HE WAS A
[1:50:07] LIAR. He was a thief.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Maybe not a thief but he was a liar. He
[1:50:12] lied right. He tried to take his own I
[1:50:14] believe I got that right. You know what
[1:50:15] I'm trying to say. But he he he but HE
[1:50:19] WAS A SINNER. WHAT WAS IT IN THAT? IN
[1:50:21] ALL OF THAT, he was called to express
[1:50:23] the divine nature of God. And in some
[1:50:25] moments, he got it wrong, but in other
[1:50:27] moments, it was a surrendering and
[1:50:29] allowing the Holy Ghost to move out into
[1:50:31] his life. And Peter, my just YOU THINK
[1:50:33] OF PETER, PETER'S up and down. Now, look
[1:50:35] at this. And I just I I just want to th
[1:50:38] you can grab your Bibles and turn with
[1:50:39] me to John 21.
[1:50:41] I just this just come to me here before
[1:50:43] we come out to the platform.
[1:50:46] And and you can think of Peter. I I if
[1:50:48] we had time you could preach uh many
[1:50:50] services on it, but think of Peter how
[1:50:53] with this revelation
[1:50:56] he denied the Lord three times.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; A and I think the grace of God and how
[1:51:06] uh the scripture it just it just melts
[1:51:08] it melts my heart. If you turn into John
[1:51:10] 21:17,
[1:51:13] but just think of of of Peter. I know
[1:51:16] I'm saying it over and over. Maybe
[1:51:18] that's so somebody can at least get it
[1:51:19] once. But he he has the revelation and
[1:51:23] it's this this revelation that the the
[1:51:25] gates of hell shall not prevail and
[1:51:27] whatever you bind in earth shall be
[1:51:29] bound in heaven. And now he he as as the
[1:51:31] Lord's been taken away. He you know I'll
[1:51:33] never leave you. I'll never betray you.
[1:51:35] And now you know he says before the
[1:51:37] crows three times you'll betray betray
[1:51:40] me three times. And uh could you imagine
[1:51:42] in the moment each time he he denied the
[1:51:44] Lord you know maybe he you know in that
[1:51:46] moment in the pressure that's a lot of
[1:51:48] times what happens in the moment in the
[1:51:50] pressure in the mo living in the moment
[1:51:52] he denied him living in the moment he
[1:51:54] denied him living in the moment he
[1:51:56] denied him and all a sudden the it it
[1:51:59] crows and that's when oh no
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; I did it I I I purposed in myself how
[1:52:08] many times have you purposed in
[1:52:10] yourself. I'll never do it again.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, I will never look at that again.
[1:52:16] I'll never say that again. I'll never
[1:52:18] have that attitude again.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; How many times I'll never get upset my
[1:52:22] wife. I I'll never have a temper tantrum
[1:52:24] again.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; I'll never lash out her again. I'VE
[1:52:27] HEARD HER ONE TOO MANY TIMES. I'LL NEVER
[1:52:29] DO THAT AGAIN.
[1:52:31] And then you do it again and YOU COME TO
[1:52:33] YOURSELF AND IN THE MOMENT.
[1:52:36] But I say that's in that moment is when
[1:52:37] you say, "God, forgive me. Lord, I know
[1:52:40] there's a power.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; I know there's A HOLY GHOST. I KNOW
[1:52:44] THERE'S A DIVINE NATURE, Lord Jesus,
[1:52:47] that you can burn that temper out of me.
[1:52:50] YOU CAN BURN THAT ATTITUDE OUT OF ME.
[1:52:52] LORD, I MIGHT HAVE FALLEN THREE TIMES OR
[1:52:54] FOUR TIMES, BUT LORD JESUS, I KNOW
[1:52:56] THERE'S A NATURE that you're wanting to
[1:52:59] produce IN ME
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; TO EXPRESS TO MY WIFE AND TO MY CHILDREN
[1:53:02] AND TO MY CO-WORKERS AND TO MY CHURCH
[1:53:05] AND TO A DYING WORLD. AMEN.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; LORD, MAY I LIVE IN THE MOMENT THE way
[1:53:10] you want me to live.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; And in John 21:17,
[1:53:18] maybe I'm catching the story just right.
[1:53:21] This is where I we'll just back up a
[1:53:23] little bit.
[1:53:29] This is a wonderful story where uh you
[1:53:33] just you just love Peter and his zeal. I
[1:53:35] believe this is a story. I didn't go
[1:53:36] back and look at it, but man, when they
[1:53:38] and I and and I love it. Uh because
[1:53:41] Well, let's just read. We'll see what
[1:53:42] happens. Everybody feeling okay?
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; I I don't know if there's any
[1:53:46] restaurants you're going to be able to
[1:53:47] go to. So, we might as well just keep
[1:53:49] coming and dining right here.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; Let's just read this real quick.
[1:53:52] Everybody at home, you feeling okay? You
[1:53:54] got your second, third cup? Drink one
[1:53:57] for me.
[1:53:59] Okay, everybody will.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All right, let's just
[1:54:02] see where we're at.
[1:54:05] We'll just do a little Bible reading
[1:54:09] maybe verse four. But when the morning
[1:54:10] was come, Jesus stood on the shore. But
[1:54:13] the disciples knew not that it was
[1:54:16] Jesus.
[1:54:18] Then Jesus said unto them, "Children,
[1:54:19] have ye any meat?"
[1:54:21] They answered him, "No."
[1:54:24] And he said to them, "Cast the net on
[1:54:26] the right side of the ship,
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; and you shall find."
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:31] and they cast therefore and now they
[1:54:33] were not able to draw in the multitude
[1:54:35] of fishes.
[1:54:37] Therefore the disciples whom Jesus loved
[1:54:40] said unto Peter,
[1:54:42] "It is the Lord."
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Now when SIMON PETER HEARD THAT it was
[1:54:47] the Lord
[1:54:49] he g his fisher's coat unto him, for he
[1:54:51] was naked and did cast himself into the
[1:54:54] sea. I tell you what, that's what coming
[1:54:56] in the presence of the Lord will do to
[1:54:57] make you put on clothes.
[1:55:02] Hey, we have testimony of the prophet
[1:55:03] them blanket natives in the presence of
[1:55:05] God.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; And I find it strange. We say we believe
[1:55:08] the message of the outer and our clothes
[1:55:09] are just getting tighter and tighter and
[1:55:10] our heels are getting longer and longer.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; All right, we'll just move on. I'm not
[1:55:13] trying to go there. And the other
[1:55:16] disciples came in a little ship, for
[1:55:17] they were not a far off, but as it were
[1:55:20] 200 cubits dragging the net with fishes.
[1:55:22] And as soon then as they were come to
[1:55:24] the land, they saw a fire of coals, and
[1:55:26] the fish laid there on the bread. And
[1:55:28] Jesus said unto them, "Bring of the fish
[1:55:30] which you have now caught." Simon Peter
[1:55:32] went up and drew the net to land and of
[1:55:35] the great fishes 150 and three. And for
[1:55:38] all there was so many yet was not a net
[1:55:41] broken. Do y'all know why it was 153
[1:55:42] fishes?
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; I don't either. Jesus saith unto them,
[1:55:47] "Come and dine." And none of the
[1:55:49] disciples dursed. Now watch this. Jesus
[1:55:52] saith unto him, "Come and dine." And
[1:55:54] none of the di disciples dured ask him
[1:55:57] who art thou. Now why would the
[1:56:00] scripture say that?
[1:56:02] Because it was no longer by a physical
[1:56:04] appearance.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; What you KNOW YOU KNOW GOD AND MORPHE
[1:56:10] WHAT IS HE DOING? HE HE'S ALWAYS HE HE
[1:56:12] HE VEILS HIMSELF TO UNVEIL HIMSELF. He
[1:56:14] he he he he it's God and morphe. And now
[1:56:19] I IT'S IT'S BY DOING SOMETHING FAMILIAR.
[1:56:21] IT IT GOES TO SHOW IT WAS A REVELATION
[1:56:24] THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING BY THAT WELL HIS
[1:56:26] PHYSICAL APPEARANCE because the
[1:56:28] scripture says none of them dured asked
[1:56:30] who it was because they knew that WHAT
[1:56:32] HE DID YESTERDAY WHAT HE WAS DOING TODAY
[1:56:35] WAS PROVEN THAT IT WAS HIM. They didn't
[1:56:37] have to look at him and AND BY A
[1:56:39] PHYSICAL APPEARANCE AND SAY, "WELL, YOU
[1:56:41] LOOK LIKE THE same guy." NO, BUT HE WAS
[1:56:43] DOING THE SAME THINGS THAT HE DID BACK
[1:56:44] THERE. AND I'M SO THANKFUL BY REVELATION
[1:56:47] THAT GOD SENT A VINDICATED PROPHET AND I
[1:56:49] CAN LOOK PAST THE VEIL AND KNOW I DON'T
[1:56:52] HAVE TO wonder who it is. I KNOW THAT
[1:56:54] IT'S THE LORD JESUS CHRIST THE SAME
[1:56:56] YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER
[1:56:59] VINDICATING THAT HIS WORD IS THE SAME.
[1:57:01] AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, HE WANTS TO DO
[1:57:02] THE SAME THING in each one of you. HE
[1:57:06] WANTS YOU TO TAKE ON THAT DIVINE NATURE
[1:57:08] THAT WHEN PEOPLE WOULD COME IN CONTACT
[1:57:10] WITH YOU, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO GUESS
[1:57:12] WHO IT IS. THEY'D SAY LIKE I I BELIEVE
[1:57:14] THAT'S THE LORD.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; And Jesus cometh and taketh the bread
[1:57:19] and giveth them fish likewise. This is
[1:57:22] now the third time that Jesus showed
[1:57:24] himself to the disciples. After that he
[1:57:26] was risen from the dead. So when they
[1:57:28] had died, Jesus was sim dined. Jesus
[1:57:31] saith to Simon Peter, Simon son of
[1:57:33] Jonas,
[1:57:34] lovest thou me more than these?
[1:57:39] Oh, could you imagine?
[1:57:41] I bet his heart was racing.
[1:57:45] I mean, I I tell you that. But but I say
[1:57:47] that's sometimes that's where we just
[1:57:48] got to get us to a place where you're no
[1:57:51] longer saying, "Oh, soul, I got it
[1:57:53] figured out." But you just get to a
[1:57:56] place where I've I've tried here and
[1:57:58] I've tried there. And you know, he says,
[1:58:01] he saith to him, "Yay, Lord, thou
[1:58:03] knowest I love thee." He said unto them,
[1:58:04] "Feed my lambs."
[1:58:06] He saith to him again the second time,
[1:58:08] Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me?
[1:58:11] Remember he denied the Lord three times.
[1:58:15] And here the Lord, I believe it's no
[1:58:16] coincidence that the Lord has given him
[1:58:18] three opportunities. And he says, "Thou
[1:58:21] love me, he saith unto him, Yay, Lord,
[1:58:22] thou knowest,
[1:58:24] I love thee." He saith unto him, "Feed
[1:58:26] my sheep." And he saith unto him the
[1:58:28] third time, Simon, son of Jodas, lovest
[1:58:31] thou me? Peter was grieved because he
[1:58:35] said unto him the third time, "Love thou
[1:58:36] me." He said unto him, "Lord,
[1:58:39] thou knowest all things."
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; I believe that sometimes the place we
[1:58:43] get to serving the Lord. We don't
[1:58:46] understand why we're going through
[1:58:47] things, we don't understand the
[1:58:48] heartache, we don't understand the pain,
[1:58:50] we don't understand why things I DON'T
[1:58:52] UNDERSTAND WHY I let the Lord down, why
[1:58:54] I couldn't GET THE VICTORY. BUT ONE
[1:58:56] THING, LORD, I know you know I love you,
[1:58:58] &gt;&gt; Lord. WHERE WOULD I BE IF IT WASN'T FOR
[1:59:00] YOUR GRACE? WHERE WOULD I BE IF IT
[1:59:02] WASN'T FOR YOUR MERCY?
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; He said, Lord, he said UNTO HIM, LORD,
[1:59:07] THOU KNOWEST ALL THINGS, THOU KNOWEST
[1:59:08] THAT I love thee. Jesus, Jesus saith
[1:59:10] unto him, feed my sheep. Verily, I say
[1:59:12] unto you, that when thou young, thou
[1:59:14] girdest thyself, and walkest, whether
[1:59:16] thou wouldest, but when thou shalt be
[1:59:19] old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands,
[1:59:21] and another shall girth thee, and carry
[1:59:23] thee whether thou wouldest not. then
[1:59:26] spake he signifying by what that spake
[1:59:28] he's signifying by what death he should
[1:59:30] glorify God. I say that's how we glorify
[1:59:33] God is in dying daily.
[1:59:35] If you want to glorify the Lord Jesus we
[1:59:37] have to die daily that he might live out
[1:59:39] through us. And this is what I want to
[1:59:41] focus on as we move towards a close. He
[1:59:44] says and when he had spoken this he
[1:59:46] saith to him follow me. And I just that
[1:59:50] just struck my heart to think that
[1:59:53] through all of the mistakes through
[1:59:55] through the mountain tops in the valleys
[1:59:57] through denying them three times and
[1:59:59] here he coming and and giving them a
[2:00:02] three opportunities to to tell him that
[2:00:04] that he that he that he loved him. I was
[2:00:06] just thinking, you know, he he's a
[2:00:07] friend that that stickketh closer to a
[2:00:09] brother. AND WHEN YOU'VE MESSED UP AND
[2:00:10] WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMS LIKE IT'S GONE THE
[2:00:12] the wrong way, his love never changes.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; I want to say he's still calling. And
[2:00:17] after all of this, I thought it was so
[2:00:19] wonderful where it just it made me think
[2:00:22] of of of the very when it first all
[2:00:23] started WHEN JESUS CAME BY THE BANK AND
[2:00:26] SAID, "Follow me." And here, after all
[2:00:28] those years of maybe getting things
[2:00:30] wrong and thinking he had it all figured
[2:00:31] out here, the Lord's coming by and say,
[2:00:33] "FOLLOW ME." I WANT TO TELL YOU, I DON'T
[2:00:35] CARE HOW FAR YOU'VE GONE. I DON'T CARE
[2:00:36] IF YOU'RE IN a pig pin. I don't care IF
[2:00:38] YOU'RE A PRODICAL SON AND YOU STINK AND
[2:00:40] YOU'RE WRESTLING ON A CORN HUSK. I DON'T
[2:00:42] CARE WHAT IT IS. I BELIEVE THE MASTER IS
[2:00:44] STILL CALLING. COME AND DIE. FOLLOW ME.
[2:00:47] FOLLOW ME OUT OF THE PIG PIN. FOLLOW ME
[2:00:49] OUT OF THE SITUATION. JUST GET ON THE
[2:00:51] PATH. JUST LOOK AT THE WATER TOWER.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Vanham said this, "And how can I
[2:00:59] overcome?" He said, "He stood one day on
[2:01:00] Mount Transfiguration." He said,
[2:01:01] "Verily, I say unto you that some of
[2:01:03] that you stand here shall not taste
[2:01:05] death until you see the kingdom come in
[2:01:07] its power." It was foreshadowed. It it
[2:01:10] it a as we've been through it mount
[2:01:12] transfiguration
[2:01:14] and the Bible said the kingdom of God is
[2:01:16] within you. So this is a kingdom people
[2:01:19] that profess that this is not their
[2:01:22] home. THIS IS NOT OUR HOME. I WANT TO
[2:01:24] SAY LOOK IN ONE MOMENT he did the wrong
[2:01:26] thing. In one moment he made a MISTAKE
[2:01:28] OF EVERYTHING. JUST LIKE EACH ONE OF US
[2:01:30] WE DID THE WRONG THING. BUT I WANT TO
[2:01:32] SAY YOU HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT. Don't give
[2:01:34] UP JUST BECAUSE YOU FAILED. DON'T GIVE
[2:01:36] UP JUST BECAUSE YOU MADE A BAD DECISION.
[2:01:37] I SAY YOU GET BACK UP BECAUSE YOU CAN.
[2:01:40] YOU GET BACK UP BECAUSE YOU'RE FORGIVEN.
[2:01:42] YOU GET BACK UP BECAUSE HE MADE A WAY
[2:01:44] FOR YOU. AND YOU GET BACK UP NOT BECAUSE
[2:01:46] YOU'RE LIVING IN THE MOMENT OF YOUR
[2:01:48] DISAPPOINTMENT. BUT YOU GET BACK UP
[2:01:50] BECAUSE GOD HAS GIVEN YOU ANOTHER
[2:01:52] MOMENT. ACCORDING TO 1 CORINTHIANS
[2:01:54] 15:51, BEHOLD, I SHOW YOU A MYSTERY. WE
[2:01:57] SHALL NOT ALL SLEEP, BUT WE SHALL BE
[2:01:59] CHANGED. FOR IN A MOMENT, IN A TWINKLING
[2:02:02] OF AN EYE, AT THE LAST TRUMP, FOR THE
[2:02:04] TRUMP SHALL SOUND, AND THE DEAD IN
[2:02:06] CHRIST SHALL shall raise incorruptible,
[2:02:08] AND WE SHALL BE CHANGED. I WANT TO TELL
[2:02:10] YOU, I'M LIVING THIS MOMENT FOR THAT
[2:02:13] MOMENT. I AM LIVING for rapture. I AM A
[2:02:16] KINGDOM PEOPLE. THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS
[2:02:19] WITHIN ME. I CAME FROM GOD AND I'M GOING
[2:02:22] BACK TO GOD. I MIGHT HAVE FAILED IN THIS
[2:02:24] MOMENT, BUT I'M GOING TO REPENT AND GET
[2:02:26] BACK UP AND SAY, "LORD, I'M SORRY
[2:02:28] BECAUSE I'M NOT LIVING FOR MY FAILURES.
[2:02:30] I'M LIVING FOR RAPTURE. I'M NOT LIVING
[2:02:32] FOR MY FLESH. I'M LIVING FOR JESUS
[2:02:34] CHRIST." AND IN ONE MOMENT WHERE I GOT
[2:02:36] IT WRONG, HIS GRACE AND MERCY IS HERE
[2:02:38] THAT I CAN GET IT RIGHT.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS. THANK YOU, LORD.
[2:02:44] HALLELUJAH.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; LORD, help me to live in the moment.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; Like you want me to live.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Benham said his THOUGHTS IN JUST
[2:02:53] ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES. HE SAID HIS
[2:02:55] thoughts is the Christian of today. The
[2:02:59] thoughts before the foundation of the
[2:03:00] world.
[2:03:02] Now brother Brandham says this in
[2:03:03] identification. He says he came as a
[2:03:05] redeemer and to redeem anything is to
[2:03:08] bring back.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Maybe 10 minute more minutes. We'll just
[2:03:12] see what the Lord has. Is that okay? We
[2:03:15] all right?
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; You there at home, you can get up. You
[2:03:18] can stretch your legs. You can do
[2:03:20] everything you've already been doing.
[2:03:21] And for you that are here, we'll just
[2:03:23] we'll just plug a little bit longer. Is
[2:03:25] that all right?
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; We Okay.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. I You KNOW WHAT? I FIGURE I JUST
[2:03:29] MIGHT AS WELL uh uh deliver my burden.
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; All right. We'll just keep pressing.
[2:03:34] Brother Brandham says this in
[2:03:35] identification. He said he came as a
[2:03:37] redeemer and to redeem any Oh, we only
[2:03:39] got one service today. Hallelujah. We
[2:03:41] always get a little more extra time when
[2:03:43] we got one service, right?
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; All right, I'm feeling better now. He
[2:03:46] came as a redeemer and to redeem
[2:03:48] anything is to bring back. Amen. Bring
[2:03:51] it back. IT WAS GOD'S THOUGHT. You
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; think little you, little me.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; No one IN THE WORLD COULD TAKE MY PLACE.
[2:04:04] NOBODY CAN TAKE YOURS. GOD'S GOT A PLACE
[2:04:07] FOR ME AND NOBODY CAN TAKE IT.
[2:04:10] HALLELUJAH. AS MUCH AS YOU MIGHT NOT
[2:04:12] LIKE MY PLACE, YOU DIDN'T GIVE IT TO ME.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; GOD GAVE IT TO ME AND IT'S MINE. AND NOT
[2:04:19] ONLY DID HE GIVE ME A PLACE HERE IN
[2:04:21] LADYIA TO MANIFEST HIS DIVINE NATURE, HE
[2:04:24] GAVE ME A PLACE IN THE RAPTURE. HE GAVE
[2:04:26] ME A PLACE AT THE MARRIAGE TABLE. I WANT
[2:04:29] TO TELL YOU, THERE'S A MARRIAGE TABLE.
[2:04:31] AND I GOT A RESERVATION.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; And I'm so glad my reservation ain't
[2:04:37] like man's reservation. We make a
[2:04:39] reservation and WHEN THE SNOW DAY COMES
[2:04:41] OR WE ALL GET ICED OUT, WE CAN'T MAKE IT
[2:04:43] CUZ THE FLIGHT COULDN'T GET OUT. BUT I
[2:04:45] WANT TO TELL YOU, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW
[2:04:47] MUCH ICE, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH
[2:04:49] FIRE, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH CONDEMN
[2:04:51] CONDEMNATION, IT DON'T MATTER HOW MANY
[2:04:53] ARROWS THE DEVIL TRIES TO SHOOT MY WAY.
[2:04:55] I GOT A PLACE. I got a revelation and
[2:04:59] I'm going to be there.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I GOT A PLACE. WHERE ARE WE
[2:05:03] AT?
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; Nobody can take your place. You being a
[2:05:07] CHRISTIAN AND FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT,
[2:05:09] GOD AND BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[2:05:11] WORLD SEEN YOU AND KNOWED EVERY feature
[2:05:13] that you got.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS COME TO BRING YOU BACK. That's
[2:05:18] what Jesus was here for. The redeemer.
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; THE HUMAN BODY TO BRING YOU BACK. THAT
[2:05:24] HAD TO COME TO BE A HUMAN AS A REDEEMER
[2:05:26] TO DISPLAY HIS ATTRIBUTES AS SAVIOR COME
[2:05:28] TO REDEEM YOU AND BRING YOU BACK FROM
[2:05:29] WHERE YOU WERE FROM.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; When you receive eternal life, there's
[2:05:35] only one FORM OF ETERNAL LIFE. THAT'S
[2:05:37] GREEK word Zoe. Is that right?
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; ZOEY, GOD'S own life. So you
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; being a son, YOU BECOME PART OF THAT
[2:05:46] LIFE. SO THE LIFE THAT'S IN YOU NEVER
[2:05:49] DID begin and it never can end.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Think of it. It can't end because
[2:05:57] anything that's eternal never began. OH,
[2:06:01] DON'T
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET THAT BE SOME IDEA.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; GOD, quicken that. THAT'S A REVELATION
[2:06:07] THAT YOU ARE ETERNAL.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; OH, THAT'S WHY THE GATES OF HELL CAN'T
[2:06:13] PREVAIL OVER YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE PART OF
[2:06:15] GOD. YOU'RE A PART OF THE REVEL. YOU ARE
[2:06:18] THE REVELATION IN THE END TIME.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S GOD. FOR YOU WAS IN THE
[2:06:25] THOUGHTS FROM THE ETERNAL AND NOW IT'S
[2:06:28] expressed
[2:06:29] here. in a human being for his glory.
[2:06:32] Jesus came to redeem THAT BEING THE SON,
[2:06:34] the fullness of God had to come and and
[2:06:37] become that. THE SINLESS CHARACTER OF
[2:06:39] GOD DID THAT THAT HE MIGHT REDEEM THESE
[2:06:41] OTHER THOUGHTS THAT WAS to come to him
[2:06:44] to make a wife.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; So, as we just take a little time here
[2:06:47] towards the end, forgive me. I I I just
[2:06:50] I want to lay this in there. What kind
[2:06:53] of character then you know we rejoice in
[2:06:56] that you know uh uh we she is him and
[2:06:59] and and all the things but WHAT KIND OF
[2:07:01] CHARACTER WHAT KIND OF NATURE WHAT KIND
[2:07:03] OF HUMILITY WHAT WHAT WHAT KIND OF
[2:07:05] ACTION WHAT KIND OF CHARACTER IT IT'S
[2:07:07] HIS life right she is him that it's
[2:07:09] GOING TO BE HIS LIFE HIS DEMEANOR HIS
[2:07:12] CHARACTER HIS ATTITUDE
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; living out IF I COULD SAY IT LIKE THIS
[2:07:18] AGAIN LIVING IN THE MOMENT LOOK AS HE
[2:07:21] EXPRESSES OURSELF IN OUR VESSELS. WE
[2:07:23] DON'T ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT. BUT THERE'S A
[2:07:25] PREDESTINATED SEED IN THE HOLY GHOST
[2:07:27] RIGHT INSIDE THAT CATCHES THAT. IT SAYS
[2:07:29] NOW IN THAT MOMENT I GOT IT WRONG, BUT
[2:07:31] NOW let's make it right.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; And that's what Jesus said in in Matthew
[2:07:38] 7:20. He said, "Whereby their fruits you
[2:07:40] shall know them." Now I'm going to move
[2:07:41] through these quotes quickly. In the
[2:07:43] hidden life, Brother Brandon says this.
[2:07:44] And the fruit of the spirit is love,
[2:07:46] joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness,
[2:07:48] gentleness, patience, meekness,
[2:07:50] temperance. fruits of the spirit. God
[2:07:52] knows today um what the holiest people
[2:07:56] need and also the Calvinists all of them
[2:07:58] needs today is more fruit of the spirit.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; More lives to prove it. We've had many
[2:08:05] testimonies but as the old saying is
[2:08:08] your life speaks so loud I can't hear
[2:08:11] your voice.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; We are written epistles of God read of
[2:08:15] all men. Brother Von made a statement as
[2:08:17] I was listening and looking into hidden
[2:08:19] life. He says, "Too many of us are
[2:08:20] playing in the courts."
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We we we come and, you know, we're
[2:08:24] in the outer courts, we're in the inner
[2:08:25] courts. But I say there ought to BE A
[2:08:26] DEEP DESIRE TO GO in
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; in into behind the veil and have a
[2:08:30] hidden life with Jesus Christ where
[2:08:32] where you speak to God and God speaks
[2:08:34] back.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Where where when the curtain comes down,
[2:08:36] it blocks out all the noise.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; All all the distractions and everything
[2:08:41] THAT'S TRYING TO TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE
[2:08:42] PROMISED word of the hour. You get in
[2:08:44] there and it drops behind you and it's
[2:08:46] soundproof. That's right.
[2:08:48] It's just you and God alone. It's a
[2:08:50] hidden life and and and and um just the
[2:08:54] scripture says give all diligence to add
[2:08:57] to your faith. So it's a constant
[2:08:59] growing and unfolding into the capstone
[2:09:01] of love and in the per in the in the
[2:09:03] statue of a perfect man. He says so when
[2:09:05] you surrender your complete being then
[2:09:07] the Holy Spirit just pours through you
[2:09:10] in these virtues. Then you're a living
[2:09:13] tabernacle. Then the people look out and
[2:09:15] say, "That's a man full of virtue,
[2:09:18] knowledge. He believes the word,
[2:09:20] temperance, patience, godliness,
[2:09:22] brotherly kindness, full of the love of
[2:09:25] Is it is it amazing how now, brother
[2:09:27] Brandham, he has to lay it in many
[2:09:29] times, you know, uh, these signs shall
[2:09:31] follow them that believe." And that's
[2:09:32] one of the things that we know because
[2:09:34] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:09:35] forever. But also look how he comes
[2:09:37] around here now to the character and
[2:09:38] he's shown these are the things. SO IT'S
[2:09:40] NOT BECAUSE MANY WILL SAY TO me on that
[2:09:42] day, "Have we not prophesied my name and
[2:09:44] casted out devils and done all these
[2:09:45] marvelous things?" He'll say, "Depart
[2:09:46] from me, you workers of iniquity. I
[2:09:48] never knew you." What is that? Knowing
[2:09:49] what to do and not doing it.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; And one thing we know that we have to
[2:09:54] have with the Holy SPIRIT IS WE HAVE TO
[2:09:56] HAVE VIRTUE, KNOWLEDGE, TEMPERANCE,
[2:09:58] PATIENCE, GODLINESS, brotherly kindness,
[2:10:00] full of love of the Holy Ghost. See,
[2:10:03] there he is walking around. What is it?
[2:10:06] a stature that unbelievers can look at
[2:10:09] and say, "There's a Christian. There is
[2:10:12] a man or a woman who knows what they're
[2:10:14] talking about. You've never seen a
[2:10:16] kinder, sweeter, godlier person.
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; You're sealed. A SEAL SHOWS ON BOTH
[2:10:22] SIDES.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; NOW, this will preach."
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; A lot of us might be able to show on one
[2:10:30] side.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; But he SAYS WHETHER YOU'RE GOING OR
[2:10:33] COMING, you see the seal just the same.
[2:10:37] There you are. Oh, it it's a lot. It's
[2:10:40] easy to show brotherly love and
[2:10:41] brotherly kindness. Brother Cosman, come
[2:10:43] on over to my house for dinner. Come on
[2:10:46] over. We have our little fellowship and
[2:10:48] our kids get along and everybody gets
[2:10:50] along and oh but but wait till the uh uh
[2:10:52] uh you feel like your kid got PICKED ON
[2:10:55] OR YOUR FRIEND GOT uh uh left out or or
[2:10:57] or this family didn't invite you over
[2:11:00] and and and you know your heart feels
[2:11:02] broke and you're not in FELLOWSHIP WITH
[2:11:03] THIS PERSON AND THAT person and and and
[2:11:06] OH YEAH, YOU YOU TH THOSE THINGS CAN
[2:11:08] CAUSE DEEP wounds
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; because YOU KNOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
[2:11:11] THOSE OF THE HOUSEHOLD OF FAITH THAT WE
[2:11:13] WE SHOW THE MOST LOVE TO. BUT IT'S THOSE
[2:11:14] OF THE HOUSEHOLD OF FAITH THAT CAUSE US
[2:11:16] THE BIGGEST HURT.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; But it it's in those moments where where
[2:11:23] it's one thing to show the seal of God
[2:11:26] coming, but what about going? WHAT ABOUT
[2:11:28] ON THE OTHER SIDE WHEN IT'S WHEN IT
[2:11:30] HURTS and when it's it's nasty and it
[2:11:33] and things ain't right? I say that
[2:11:35] there's THE TIE. WE WE GOT TO SHOW THE
[2:11:37] HOLY GHOST. WHETHER WE'RE ON THE
[2:11:39] MOUNTAINTOP OR WHETHER we're in THE
[2:11:40] VALLEY, I TELL YOU WHETHER YOU GOT THE
[2:11:42] REVELATION AND YOU'RE RUNNING THE AISLES
[2:11:44] OF THE CHURCH AND YOU'VE HAD A WONDERFUL
[2:11:45] SERVICE, BUT I WONDER ABOUT WHEN YOU GET
[2:11:47] BACK TO WORK ON MONDAY AND AND YOU'RE
[2:11:49] BACK THERE WITH THE HOME AND AND THE
[2:11:51] HOME IS A WRECK AND AND EVERYTHING IS
[2:11:53] ISN'T GOING THE WAY IT SHOULD BE AND
[2:11:54] THERE'S AN ATTITUDE IN THE HOME AND AND
[2:11:56] YOU SNAP OFF AT YOUR WIFE. COME ON,
[2:11:58] BROTHERS.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE TIME TO SHOW THE TOKEN.
[2:12:02] THAT'S THE TIME TO SHOW THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:12:04] YES.
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; TAKE YOUR LITTLE SWEET WIFE WHO'S BEEN
[2:12:06] SLAVING AWAY FOR YOU AT HOME AND AND YOU
[2:12:09] THINK THAT YOU'VE DONE YOUR WORK FOR THE
[2:12:10] DAY. NO. WHY? WHY DON'T YOU COME HOME
[2:12:12] AND SHOW THAT SEAL BOTH COMING AND
[2:12:13] GOING?
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; It's just the same. There you are. See,
[2:12:18] when a man or a woman possesses this,
[2:12:20] then the capstone comes down and seals
[2:12:22] them into the kingdom of God, which is
[2:12:23] the Holy Ghost. Then the word coming
[2:12:26] from here manifests itself. Each one of
[2:12:28] these being see and it makes this
[2:12:31] complete being a tabernacle of the
[2:12:32] living God. a walking living example of
[2:12:35] Christianity. Is that your heart's
[2:12:37] DESIRE TODAY? WHAT CHRIST WAS, these
[2:12:40] people are because his life is in here.
[2:12:45] They are in Christ and their life is
[2:12:48] dead and hid in Christ through God and
[2:12:50] sealed in there by the Holy Ghost.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; Look, his character has never changed.
[2:12:56] What what what what what it does what it
[2:12:58] did in him, it does in us.
[2:13:01] Yes,
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; sir.
[2:13:03] It's I even what it did in the
[2:13:05] disciples, it does in us.
[2:13:08] What the Holy Ghost did in them, it does
[2:13:10] in you. And I say, what about the moment
[2:13:13] in the hour that that we're now living
[2:13:14] in? We we could go through how John 14
[2:13:16] SAYS, "YEAH, A LITTLE while and the
[2:13:17] world seeth me no more, but ye see me
[2:13:19] because I live, ye live also." Oh. Oh,
[2:13:21] what an hour that we are now living in
[2:13:23] that this capstone revelation takes on
[2:13:26] flesh in you. And it's not, oh wow, uh
[2:13:30] uh uh something off over the rainbows.
[2:13:34] No, it's a hidden life of God expressing
[2:13:37] himself in you. So we come back to our
[2:13:39] text so we can bring this to a close. In
[2:13:41] Luke 5:17, it says, "And when he came to
[2:13:45] himself,
[2:13:47] he was always a son. He was in his
[2:13:50] father's house. And you know, he thought
[2:13:53] he could take some revelation
[2:13:56] out on his own
[2:13:58] and he thought maybe he could go make a
[2:14:00] way for himself.
[2:14:02] Is that okay?
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; You know, and he found out that he got
[2:14:06] into a hard time and and he got into a
[2:14:09] place of spiritual amnesia. And brother
[2:14:11] Benham says this in spiritual amnesia.
[2:14:13] He says, "Now this amnesia, we're told
[2:14:15] it because it caused you to be to a
[2:14:17] place where you cannot identify
[2:14:19] yourself." Now, it's an unusual thing.
[2:14:21] It don't happen too often, but the cause
[2:14:23] from shock is something. Remember we
[2:14:25] talked about the soldier boy, right?
[2:14:26] It's somebody that don't even know who
[2:14:28] they are. You find it from wars and
[2:14:30] sometimes soldiers get it. And I just
[2:14:32] want to say that church splits will
[2:14:33] cause it. Family situations and trauma,
[2:14:37] sudden loss. I I I've seen good men have
[2:14:41] a a a tragic loss in their family or or
[2:14:45] good good my I mean you you feel LIKE
[2:14:48] YOU COULDN'T PUT NOTHING ON THEIR LIFE
[2:14:50] AND AND JUST a powerful MAN OF GOD AND
[2:14:53] SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THEIR marriage
[2:14:55] and all of a sudden they no they no
[2:14:58] longer are even a shell of themselves.
[2:15:01] They they there is no longer any
[2:15:04] identity in their life that they're even
[2:15:06] a believer.
[2:15:08] THAT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED, SOME WAR,
[2:15:10] SOME TRAUMA, SOME SHOCK HAS TOTALLY
[2:15:13] ROBBED THEM FROM THEIR IDENTIFICATION OF
[2:15:16] WHO THEY ARE. THEY GOT SPIRITUAL
[2:15:17] AMNESIA. AND I PRAY that one day,
[2:15:20] &gt;&gt; the spiritual amnesia will break,
[2:15:22] there's some good men that I LOVE
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; THAT THEY'VE WALKED AWAY. NOW, SOME
[2:15:26] PEOPLE, I TELL YOU THIS, THEY WHEN THEY
[2:15:27] TAKE ON AN antichrist spirit and try to
[2:15:29] tear down the message, well,
[2:15:32] that's a bad place to be. We have
[2:15:34] scripture for that. Uh, I mean, uh,
[2:15:37] that's bad. But some people the the the
[2:15:39] the losing a loved one OR SOMETHING LIKE
[2:15:40] THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY WALK AWAY, I JUST
[2:15:42] CAN'T BELIEVE IT ANYMORE. And and they
[2:15:44] go out in the world and sin. What is it?
[2:15:45] It's spiritual amnesia. And and I just
[2:15:47] want to say that look, WE WE ARE NOT
[2:15:49] ABSOLVED from that.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; Some some of us, WE GO THROUGH HARD
[2:15:53] THINGS. I SAY SHAKE OURSELVES. I'M GOING
[2:15:55] TO DELIVER MY BURDEN. I'M RIGHT TO WHERE
[2:15:56] I WANT to be. AND MAYBE IF YOU CAN TUNE
[2:15:58] IN FOR A LITTLE BIT OR COME BACK AND
[2:16:00] CATCH IT a little later, MAYBE WE JUST
[2:16:01] SHAKE OURSELVES FOR A MOMENT. I I'VE
[2:16:03] WORKED TO THIS POINT. AND I'VE BEEN
[2:16:04] TRYING TO LABOR TO THIS POINT UH TWO
[2:16:06] SERVICES NOW. SO BY GOD'S GRACE, WE'LL
[2:16:08] JUST DELIVER IT. AND AND AND SO I AND
[2:16:10] THAT'S WHAT'S BEEN ON MY HEART IS AS I
[2:16:12] LOOK AT WHAT THIS MESSAGE CAME TO
[2:16:14] PRODUCE AND AND I feel like I DON'T EVEN
[2:16:16] FIT INTO THE MESSAGE ANYMORE. PEOPLE
[2:16:18] LISTEN TO THINGS THEY SHOULDN'T LISTEN
[2:16:20] TO AND DRESS THE WAY THEY SHOULDN'T
[2:16:21] DRESS AND I WONDER IF WE AIN'T GOT A BAD
[2:16:23] CASE OF AMNESIA.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; WHAT CAUSES IT? CHURCH SPLIT, SITUATION,
[2:16:30] TRAUMA, SUDDEN LOSS. HE SAYS SOMETIMES
[2:16:33] PEOPLE GET IT. ANOTHER THING THAT CAUSES
[2:16:35] IT IS WORRY. He said worry will cause
[2:16:37] it. HE SAID WORRY HAS NO VIRTUE AT ALL.
[2:16:40] HE HE SAID JUST SKIP WORRY AND ACCEPT
[2:16:42] FAITH. YOU KNOW THE THE WORRY it you
[2:16:44] know what it means? It means to afflict
[2:16:46] with mental distress or agitation
[2:16:49] to make anxious. Now I believe this is
[2:16:51] for somebody. I believe somebody is
[2:16:54] within shooting distance whether you're
[2:16:56] sitting in this building or you're out
[2:16:57] on the airways. Worry, listen to this.
[2:17:00] Worry is to harass by tearing.
[2:17:04] I I'm sure it's another definition of
[2:17:06] worry out in nature or something like
[2:17:08] that, but it makes a real good spiritual
[2:17:10] type. It says to harass by tearing,
[2:17:13] biting, or snapping, especially at the
[2:17:15] throat. Worry is an a vicious attack on
[2:17:19] your spiritual life. Worry is an a
[2:17:22] vicious attack
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; to keep you from functioning like a
[2:17:27] child of God. WORRY WILL CAUSE YOU TO
[2:17:30] FORGET WHO YOU ARE. WORRY WILL START YOU
[2:17:33] TO WORRY THAT YOUR SON WILL NEVER BE
[2:17:35] SAVED. WORRY WILL CAUSE YOU TO START TO
[2:17:37] DOUBT IF THEY'VE CROSSED the line.
[2:17:40] Worry will start to get YOU TO MOVE OFF
[2:17:43] THE PROMISE THAT YOU'VE BEEN STANDING
[2:17:44] ON. GOD, YOU GIVE THEM TO ME. And there
[2:17:47] ain't no devil in hell that can take
[2:17:48] them.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; But all of a sudden, YOU KNOW, IT'S
[2:17:51] NATURAL TO WORRY. MOTHERS WORRY, PASTORS
[2:17:54] WORRY. BUT WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS
[2:17:56] THAT WORRY DON'T COME IN IN A WAY WHERE
[2:17:58] IT STARTS TO CAUSE THEM AMNESIA TO WHERE
[2:18:00] IT'S JUST CONSTANTLY NIPPING AT YOU AND
[2:18:02] MAKING YOU WELL MAYBE I WON'T HAVE ANY
[2:18:04] FRIENDS OR MAYBE THEY FEEL YOU KNOW YOU
[2:18:06] KNOW SATAN COULD GET INTO YOU AND JUST
[2:18:07] BECAUSE SOMEBODY DIDN'T SHAKE YOUR HAND
[2:18:09] OR OR SOMEBODY DIDN'T INVITE YOU OVER OR
[2:18:11] FROM SOME SITUATION YOU GOT LEFT OUT AND
[2:18:13] IT WAS TOTALLY INNOCENT AND YOU DIDN'T
[2:18:14] GET INVITED TO THE BABY SHOWER AND NOW
[2:18:16] YOU'RE STARTING TO WORRY THAT you said
[2:18:18] SOMETHING AND DID SOMETHING YOU
[2:18:19] SHOULDN'T DO AND NOW IT'S nipping at
[2:18:21] your NECK AND IT'S NAGGING AT YOU AND
[2:18:23] YOU'RE STARTING TO NOT FEEL LIKE YOU FIT
[2:18:25] IN THAT CHURCH. YOU'RE STARTING TO LEAVE
[2:18:26] EARLY. YOU SEE PEOPLE IN THE PARKING LOT
[2:18:28] AND YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU WANT TO GO
[2:18:30] JOIN THEM. YOU'RE STARTING TO GET A
[2:18:31] LITTLE WORRY AND YOU START TO QUESTION,
[2:18:32] WELL, MAYBE I DON'T EVEN FIT IN HERE
[2:18:34] ANYMORE. MAY MAYBE GOD'S DEALING WITH ME
[2:18:36] TO MOVE AND GO TO ANOTHER CHURCH AND ALL
[2:18:38] OF A SUDDEN YOU'RE ALL WORRIED AND YOU
[2:18:40] START TO LOSE YOUR IDENTITY THAT YOU
[2:18:42] BELONG TO THE FAMILY.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; HELP ME PREACH A little this morning.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Worry will get you to a place that you
[2:18:49] have amnesia.
[2:18:52] But the PROPHET OF GOD SAID THIS.
[2:18:55] He said, "You must be identified
[2:18:57] somewhere. You must show your life shows
[2:19:00] tonight where you are identified. You
[2:19:02] are identified either in Christ or out
[2:19:04] of Christ. You are not a halfway. There
[2:19:06] is no such thing as a drunk sober man."
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; There's no black white bird. You're
[2:19:13] either saved or you're not saved.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; Come on, help me out a little bit. You
[2:19:17] are A SAINT. YOU ARE A saint or a
[2:19:19] sinner. one or the other. AND YOUR
[2:19:22] SPIRITUAL ATTITUDE TOWARDS GOD'S WORD
[2:19:24] IDENTIFIES you exactly where you're
[2:19:27] standing. Well, even when that prodal
[2:19:30] son came to himself, it didn't so matter
[2:19:32] where he was physically standing. But in
[2:19:35] his heart, he knew who he was. So in
[2:19:38] that moment, all he HAD TO DO IS START
[2:19:40] WALKING. I'm a son of God. I'm a
[2:19:43] daughter of God. I I in this moment, I
[2:19:46] choose to to go back to my inheritance.
[2:19:48] I CHOOSE TO GO BACK TO WHERE I came
[2:19:50] from. And there ain't no devil. There
[2:19:52] ain't NO SICKNESS. THERE AIN'T NOTHING
[2:19:54] THAT CAN STOP ME. WHY? BECAUSE I AM A
[2:19:56] SON OF GOD AND I AM HEIR TO ALL THINGS.
[2:19:59] HALLELUJAH.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; I like how the prophet OF GOD SAYS,
[2:20:02] "LET'S JUST SKIP WORRY."
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Can Can I Can I get a witness THIS
[2:20:06] MORNING? LET'S JUST SKIP WORRY AND
[2:20:09] ACCEPT FAITH. YOU OUT THERE ON THE
[2:20:11] AIRWAYS, LET'S JUST SKIP WORRY. YOU'VE
[2:20:14] BEEN WORRYING A WHOLE LOT, BUT I'M HERE
[2:20:16] TO TELL THAT OLD SPIRIT OF WORRY, DEVIL,
[2:20:18] THAT OLD SPIRIT OF ANXIETY, I AIN'T
[2:20:20] GONNA WORRY NO MORE. I'M JUST GONNA SKIP
[2:20:22] WORRY AND ACCEPT FAITH. CAN YOU SEE THE
[2:20:25] WATER TOWER THIS MORNING? I WANT TO TELL
[2:20:27] YOU, IT'S CALLING YOU. I SAY STAY ON THE
[2:20:29] PATH. DON'T STOP. IT'S CALLING YOU. IT'S
[2:20:31] LEADING YOU. IT'S DRAWING YOU.
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; FIRST JOHN 5:4 SAYS, "FOR WHATSOEVER IS
[2:20:36] BORN OF GOD OVERCOMETH THE WORLD." Don't
[2:20:38] worry, I'm not going to preach all
[2:20:39] afternoon.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:44] Praise the Lord.
[2:20:47] FIRST JOHN 5:4, FOR WHATSOEVER IS BORN
[2:20:49] OF GOD OVERCOMETH THE WORLD, AND this is
[2:20:52] the victory that overcomemeth the world,
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; even our good attendance
[2:21:00] &gt;&gt; because we made it out on a snow day.
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; Hey, don't let the devil condemn you
[2:21:04] because you didn't show up this morning.
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; He'll do it.
[2:21:09] Now, if you get convicted, that's a
[2:21:11] different thing.
[2:21:13] But right, don't get it confused. DON'T
[2:21:14] DON'T CONFUSE CONDEMNATION with
[2:21:16] conviction because the devil, he'll take
[2:21:18] the most simplest things. Oh, I should
[2:21:20] have been there. And get you to start
[2:21:21] worrying. NO, WE'RE GOING TO SKIP THAT,
[2:21:22] RIGHT? WE'RE GOING TO ACCEPT FAITH
[2:21:24] BECAUSE FAITH IS THE VICTORY THAT WHAT
[2:21:26] OVERCOMETH the world, even our faith.
[2:21:28] So, just laying this in. We're on the
[2:21:30] home stretch here. So, everybody ramp up
[2:21:32] your engines. We're going to make this
[2:21:33] last round. Are we okay?
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; Spiritual amnesia. HE SAYS, "YOU'VE GOT
[2:21:37] TO BE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. YOU'VE
[2:21:39] GOT TO BE BORN OF GOD. AND GOD IS THE
[2:21:42] WORD. AND WHEN I BECOME PART OF MY
[2:21:44] FATHER, I BECOME ALL MY FATHER. WHEN YOU
[2:21:48] BECOME PART OF GOD, YOU BECOME GOD IN
[2:21:50] FULL.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; GLORY. Take that, oh, you dumb old
[2:21:54] devil. IN ONE MOMENT, I MESSED IT ALL
[2:21:56] UP. BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT, HE'S CALLING
[2:21:58] ME HIS SON. HE'S TELLING ME I'M GOING TO
[2:22:00] MAKE IT. HE'S TELLING ME YOU'RE GOING IN
[2:22:02] A RAPTURE. AND I CHOOSE TO SKIP THE
[2:22:04] WORRY. I CHOOSE TO I CHOOSE TO SKIP THE
[2:22:06] CONDEMNATION. I AM GOING IN A RAPTURE.
[2:22:09] WHY? BECAUSE WHEN I BECOME PART OF MY
[2:22:11] FATHER, I BECOME ALL MY BOO DEVIL. STEP
[2:22:13] BACK. WHEN YOU BECOME PART OF GOD, YOU
[2:22:15] BECOME GOD IN FULL. HIS WHOLE WORD. YOU
[2:22:19] BELIEVE ALL OF IT.
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELU. I'm feeling pretty good.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; WOO. WHAT A PROMISE.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; But he says this spiritual amnesia. What
[2:22:32] if you didn't know your name or what it
[2:22:34] was
[2:22:36] &gt;&gt; and you couldn't identify yourself? You
[2:22:38] couldn't claim your inheritance.
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; You didn't even know it was there for
[2:22:42] you. That's what our our pastor when he
[2:22:44] was preaching uh unused promises, he
[2:22:46] mentioned that story about my coworker.
[2:22:48] You remember there there was an
[2:22:49] inheritance for them, BUT SOMEHOW that
[2:22:53] inheritance was unknown
[2:22:56] and somebody tried to lay claim to that
[2:22:58] inheritance. WHAT WAS AMAZING IS MY
[2:23:00] COWORKER RAPHAEL, HE FOUND $500,000 cash
[2:23:04] and he gave it to HIS BOSS. WELL, HIS
[2:23:06] BOSS SAID, "FINDERS KEEPERS."
[2:23:10] WELL, he started notice noticing the
[2:23:12] money bands in the truck that he was
[2:23:13] cleaning for his boss.
[2:23:16] And uh he he HE THOUGHT THAT RIGHT. SO,
[2:23:18] he went and told the homeowners. And the
[2:23:20] homeowner said, "Hey, I HEARD Y'ALL
[2:23:21] FOUND $500,000 IN MY HOUSE." And he was
[2:23:24] like, "Well, finders keepers."
[2:23:27] IT WAS MY HOUSE. I BOUGHT THIS HOUSE AND
[2:23:29] AND WHEN I SIGNED the contract, it said
[2:23:31] asis. So, then they sued the they went
[2:23:34] to lawsuit. Well, then the people who
[2:23:36] sold the house found out that in the
[2:23:37] house that they sold was $500,000.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; So they said, "You know what? That was
[2:23:42] our house and that's our money." So it
[2:23:45] all went to the court. But you know what
[2:23:46] the court ruled? HE SAID THE THEY SAID
[2:23:48] THE MONEY WAS TECHNICALLY MISLAID, not
[2:23:51] abandoned. So it rightfully belonged to
[2:23:53] the original heir. I SAY THERE IS A
[2:23:55] PROMISE AND THERE is inheritance.
[2:23:57] THERE'S THINGS THAT WE THAT GOD HAS LAID
[2:23:59] UP FOR US THAT WE WE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
[2:24:01] IT'S AVAILABLE. AND NOW GOD HAS SENT A
[2:24:03] MESSAGE AND HE'S STARTING TO DO THE
[2:24:05] READING OF THE WILL. AS WE HEARD BROTHER
[2:24:06] COSMAN SAY ON SUNDAY, THERE'S BEEN THE
[2:24:08] READING of the will. WHAT IS GOD WANTING
[2:24:10] TO DO? HE'S WANTING TO SHOW YOU YOUR
[2:24:11] INHERITANCE.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; He's wanting to SHOW YOU YOUR PROMISES.
[2:24:15] WE HAVE UNUSED PROMISES. I SAY, LET'S
[2:24:17] NOT FORGET WHAT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR
[2:24:20] CAME TO PRODUCE.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; The character
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; and the nature of Christ in the
[2:24:26] individual.
[2:24:28] Brother Brandon said, "If the word is in
[2:24:30] you,
[2:24:32] you and the word are the same."
[2:24:35] &gt;&gt; All the word is, you are. This is out of
[2:24:38] spiritual amnesia still. Amen. If I'm
[2:24:40] living in this generation, if the
[2:24:42] musicians would come, what this portion
[2:24:44] of the word has promised for FOR THIS
[2:24:47] GENERATION, I'VE GOT TO BE THAT. If I'm
[2:24:49] going to BE A CHRISTIAN, I'VE GOT TO BE
[2:24:51] IDENTIFIED WITH ALL THAT THE BIBLE
[2:24:53] PREACHES AND stands for.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; Look, this message is, what is IT DOING?
[2:24:56] IT'S TO TAKE AWAY THE AMNESIA. It's to
[2:24:59] REVEAL YOUR IDENTITY TO PRODUCE A
[2:25:01] CHRISTLIKE CHARACTER, A HIDDEN LIFE.
[2:25:04] WHAT THE WORD HAD PROMISED FOR THIS
[2:25:06] GENERATION. I GOT TO BE THAT.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; ALL THE word is you are. AND I BELIEVE
[2:25:11] WE SEEN THE WORD. THE FULLNESS THAT THE
[2:25:14] WORD came to PRODUCE IN A SHEATHWAVE
[2:25:16] LIFE THROUGH A VINDICATED PROPHET WAS
[2:25:19] TESTIFYING OF ALL THE WHEAT SEED COMING
[2:25:21] UP IN THE FIELD. MAMA, THAT'S ME. I AM
[2:25:24] CALLED TO BE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[2:25:26] THIS IS BRIDE TIME. THIS IS SEA TIME.
[2:25:29] THIS IS EAGLE HOUR. THIS IS THE BRIDE
[2:25:31] AGE. THIS IS ADOPTION TIME. THIS IS
[2:25:34] GOING OVER INTO CANAAN TO POSSESS THE
[2:25:36] WHOLE LAND. THIS IS THE AGE OF THE
[2:25:39] OVERCOMER. GIVE ME MY MOUNTAIN. WE ARE
[2:25:43] WELL MORE ABLE TO DO IT. LET'S GO OUT.
[2:25:45] COME ON, CHURCH. LET'S GO OVER AT ONCE.
[2:25:48] GIVE ME MY MOUNTAIN. HALLELUJAH. I AM
[2:25:50] GOING IN A RAPTURE. BUT BEFORE I GO, I'M
[2:25:53] GOING TO TAKE AS MANY AS I CAN WITH ME.
[2:25:55] I'M GOING TO EXPRESS THE DIVINE NATURE
[2:25:57] OF ALMIGHTY GOD TO EVERYBODY I CAN
[2:25:59] LIVING IN THE MOMENT.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God would say this.
[2:26:07] Just thinking of adoption now as it'll
[2:26:09] be our last quote maybe, but we're
[2:26:12] closing quickly. Forgive me.
[2:26:15] Brother Brandham says this in adoption.
[2:26:17] says, "NOW THAT YOU'RE NOT babies
[2:26:19] anymore.
[2:26:21] Now that you're not desiring the sinc
[2:26:23] milk milk of the gospel, right, we're
[2:26:26] we're in Hebrews 6 now.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; You know, we're let's go on into
[2:26:30] perfection."
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; We don't need to lay down all the fun,
[2:26:32] right? WE DON'T NEED TO BE BABIES. We're
[2:26:34] not being pandered around. We don't need
[2:26:35] the sincere meal milk, right? We're
[2:26:37] ready for strong meat
[2:26:39] &gt;&gt; because strong meat belongs to what?
[2:26:41] Those who are full age. WE SHOULD BE A
[2:26:43] FULL AGE.
[2:26:46] HE SAYS, "NOW, NOW THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
[2:26:48] TO BE BABYED ANYMORE, THAT NOW THAT
[2:26:51] YOU'RE NOT DESIRING THE SINCERE MILK OF
[2:26:53] THE GOSPEL, THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
[2:26:55] BABYED AND PATTED AND PERSUADED TO COME
[2:26:57] TO CHURCH. NOW THAT YOU'RE really fully
[2:27:00] matured Christians, you're ready to eat
[2:27:02] strong meats now. You're ready to come
[2:27:04] into something. Hallelujah. Grant it,
[2:27:06] Lord Jesus." HE SAID, "YOU'RE READY TO
[2:27:08] UNDERSTAND SOMETHING THAT'S deep and
[2:27:09] rich. OH, WE'LL GET INTO IT DIRECTLY.
[2:27:12] AND OH, IT'S been hidden since the
[2:27:13] foundation of the world." He said, "Now
[2:27:15] that you've COME INTO THIS, I'M
[2:27:16] ADDRESSING THIS TO YOU. NOT TO THOSE WHO
[2:27:18] HAVE JUST LEFT EGYPT, NOT TO THOSE WHO
[2:27:20] ARE STILL ON the journey, BUT TO THOSE
[2:27:22] WHO ARE in the promised land THAT HAS
[2:27:25] RECEIVED THE PROMISE." HOW MANY'S
[2:27:27] RECEIVED THE PROMISE OF THE HOLY GHOST?
[2:27:29] OH, AREN'T YOU GLAD THAT YOU'RE IN THE
[2:27:31] LAND OVER HERE NOW EATING THE OLD CORN?
[2:27:34] HALLELUJAH. EATING THE STRONG THINGS OF
[2:27:36] GOD AND GOT A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING. Your
[2:27:39] spiritual mind is all unmuddled UP. YOU
[2:27:42] KNOW EXACTLY WHO HE IS. YOU KNOW EXACTLY
[2:27:45] WHAT HE IS. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE
[2:27:47] YOU'RE GOING. YOU KNOW EXACTLY ALL ABOUT
[2:27:49] IT. YOU KNOW IN whom you have believed
[2:27:52] AND ARE PERSUADED BECAUSE HE IS ABLE TO
[2:27:54] KEEP THAT WHICH YOU'VE COMMITTED UNTO
[2:27:56] HIM AGAINST THAT DAY. HALLELUJAH. There
[2:27:58] is a people, A BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[2:28:01] YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHO YOU ARE. YOU KNOW
[2:28:03] EXACTLY WHO HE IS. YOU KNOW EXACTLY
[2:28:05] WHERE YOU'RE GOING. YOU KNOW EXACTLY
[2:28:07] WHERE YOU CAME FROM. YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT
[2:28:10] IT. WHY? BECAUSE THE CAPSTONE OF GRACE
[2:28:12] HAS COME DOWN, SAYING, "GRACE, GRACE,
[2:28:15] COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE, AND BE YOU
[2:28:17] NOT A PARTAKER OF HER PLAGUES."
[2:28:19] &gt;&gt; You are not IN EGYPT. YOU ARE NOT IN THE
[2:28:22] WILDERNESS. YOU ARE IN THE PROMISED
[2:28:24] LAND. YOU ARE IN CHRIST. Let's all
[2:28:27] stand.
[2:28:31] Ephesians 1:9 says, "Having made known
[2:28:34] unto us the mystery of his will,
[2:28:37] according to the good pleasure
[2:28:40] which he hath purposed
[2:28:43] in himself."
[2:28:46] Hallelujah.
[2:28:48] Aren't you glad you're part of that
[2:28:49] purpose?
[2:28:53] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you're when you become
[2:28:56] your father, you become all your father?
[2:28:59] All the word is you are
[2:29:02] in this moment. I say amen. I say Lord,
[2:29:07] I want to live it in every moment.
[2:29:12] Lord, I just don't want to say amen in
[2:29:14] the church and my life, not say amen at
[2:29:18] work.
[2:29:20] Will you let God deal with your heart
[2:29:22] right now?
[2:29:23] May maybe maybe you're at home right now
[2:29:26] and you're streaming and your your
[2:29:28] marriage is all tore up.
[2:29:31] Maybe just one of you is serving the
[2:29:32] Lord and your spouse is tearing you down
[2:29:37] and making you weaker and weaker and
[2:29:40] you've gotten spiritual amnesia and you
[2:29:41] don't know who you are. Oh God, would
[2:29:43] you go to him?
[2:29:45] Lord, may they be like that prodal son
[2:29:49] and come to themsel
[2:29:52] and in the moment say, "You know what?
[2:29:56] I'm not going to worry about how I smell
[2:29:59] in the muck. I'm just going to start
[2:30:00] walking back to my father's house
[2:30:04] because I'm a son of God."
[2:30:08] You see, the prophet of God said
[2:30:10] in the breach, he said, "The seven seal
[2:30:12] holds the mysteries of the book."
[2:30:15] And until we can see what those seven
[2:30:17] seals as sealed in, we're only presuming
[2:30:20] things.
[2:30:21] So many times, saints, we're just
[2:30:24] presuming because, as I've told you this
[2:30:26] morning, upon my little message this
[2:30:28] morning of God hiding in simplicity. You
[2:30:31] see, we are sure to miss this thing
[2:30:34] unless it is absolutely
[2:30:38] genuinely revealed by the Holy Spirit
[2:30:41] and vindicated the same.
[2:30:44] Now, I want to say in one sense that's
[2:30:46] history,
[2:30:49] but in another sense that has to be
[2:30:52] personal
[2:30:55] and you're sure to miss it unless this
[2:30:57] message is genuinely revealed by the
[2:31:00] Holy Spirit to you personally and
[2:31:02] vindicated in your life. Is that your
[2:31:05] heart's desire,
[2:31:07] Lord Jesus?
[2:31:10] Lord, I just want to thank you for the
[2:31:12] opportunity, Lord, to stand in your
[2:31:15] presence, Lord.
[2:31:18] I thank you for your grace to
[2:31:21] preach your word this morning, Lord. And
[2:31:25] I thank you for the grace of the
[2:31:26] listener that would
[2:31:29] sit and pull on the word. And
[2:31:32] Lord, I believe that we can see you
[2:31:34] standing amongst us the same yesterday,
[2:31:36] today, and forever.
[2:31:38] And Lord, we want to live
[2:31:42] in every moment by allowing your Holy
[2:31:45] Spirit to live out through us.
[2:31:48] And Lord, as we just read this quote,
[2:31:50] Lord, I I want this message not to be
[2:31:52] just some idea or some covering
[2:31:57] because your prophet said, "We're sure
[2:31:59] to miss it unless it's absolutely
[2:32:01] genuinely revealed by the Holy Spirit
[2:32:05] and vindicated the same." Lord, I know
[2:32:08] part of that is history that it's
[2:32:10] already been revealed. It's already been
[2:32:12] vindicated,
[2:32:15] but that's to the age. Lord, what about
[2:32:17] to the individual,
[2:32:19] Lord? You said we could never pray for
[2:32:21] more revelation.
[2:32:23] We couldn't pray too much for
[2:32:24] revelation,
[2:32:26] Lord. I say maybe maybe collectively as
[2:32:28] a body, we could start praying for more
[2:32:30] revelation, for more love, Lord. And for
[2:32:33] as this our pastor's been ministering on
[2:32:36] unused promises and the character, Lord,
[2:32:39] that this divine nature would just be
[2:32:41] expressed more and more abundantly in
[2:32:43] us. Lord, we don't fit in like the
[2:32:46] world. We're not like the world. We're a
[2:32:48] peculiar people. We're we're odd. We're
[2:32:50] different.
[2:32:52] Lord, it just makes me think of the
[2:32:54] classes I had in Ohio that
[2:32:59] Lord, I told the instructor in front of
[2:33:01] everybody. And I said, "I'm an oddball.
[2:33:03] I'm different." Well, you I' I'd
[2:33:05] appreciate it if you you you didn't use
[2:33:07] that language. And Lord, they were
[2:33:09] respectful and I never heard I never
[2:33:12] heard one word that was off. Lord, I I
[2:33:16] believe that was pleasing to you, Lord.
[2:33:18] But we're not called to fit into the
[2:33:20] world. We're called to be different,
[2:33:24] Lord. And we're different because
[2:33:26] we're your sons and your daughters, and
[2:33:28] you've given us an ear to hear. You've
[2:33:31] given us a seed that that word would
[2:33:33] come into manifestation. Lord, I just
[2:33:35] commit the people to you now, Lord. And
[2:33:38] as we would just sing a song of worship
[2:33:39] and praise, Lord, may your word just be
[2:33:42] watered in. I pray in Jesus Christ's
[2:33:44] name. Amen. Let's just sing this song.
[2:33:46] Help me sing it
[2:33:53] and lift them up.
[2:33:57] I have not
[2:34:00] to praise you near enough.
[2:34:04] I have nothing.
[2:34:07] Oh, I am nothing
[2:34:13] without you.
[2:34:18] Oh, and all my love for
[2:34:25] me
[2:34:27] is all your love
[2:34:32] to cover me. Brother David, if you want
[2:34:34] to come,
[2:34:36] the world
[2:34:40] will see
[2:34:42] that I have nothing.
[2:34:48] without. Let's sing that second verse.
[2:34:53] Oh, and take my voice
[2:34:59] and pour it out.
[2:35:03] Let us sing a song of mercy I found.
[2:35:09] Oh, for I am nothing.
[2:35:13] Oh, I have nothing
[2:35:18] without you. Oh,
[2:35:25] and all my soul
[2:35:30] me
[2:35:40] all the world
[2:35:45] will see
[2:35:48] that I have nothing
[2:35:53] without you.
[2:35:56] Amen.
[2:35:59] We have the capstone, the love of God
[2:36:02] shed abroad in our heart by the Holy
[2:36:05] Spirit. That's the goal. I appreciated
[2:36:09] something
[2:36:10] that David Jr. said Wednesday night. He
[2:36:13] said, "People don't
[2:36:17] see your doctrine. They don't know you
[2:36:20] by your doctrine. They know you how you
[2:36:24] treat them.
[2:36:26] And people know if you love them or not.
[2:36:29] That's right.
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; And that they just know it. You know,
[2:36:33] they know if you respect them or not.
[2:36:37] And they might not be conscious of it,
[2:36:40] but in their subconscious
[2:36:43] that love of God creates a atmosphere
[2:36:47] and it affects people. You can go into
[2:36:51] strange neighborhoods and strange places
[2:36:55] and if you love people and you love God
[2:36:57] and you respect them, it generates
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; a respect. It creates an atmosphere and
[2:37:04] it takes an atmosphere for life to be
[2:37:08] born
[2:37:09] and people are are born. When they the
[2:37:14] word of God comes in the atmosphere,
[2:37:17] it it it'll it does something for
[2:37:19] people. And that's why I think that
[2:37:23] Jesus said that they'll know you are my
[2:37:26] disciples by your love that you have one
[2:37:30] for another. And I I just think that was
[2:37:33] so brilliantly spoken about, you know,
[2:37:37] they don't know you by your doctor. They
[2:37:39] don't know you, but they know you by
[2:37:43] what comes out of you. And the prophet
[2:37:46] of God says that works is faith
[2:37:48] expressed. If you believe the word of
[2:37:51] God, then you're going to live like it's
[2:37:53] the end time, you know, and it's it's
[2:37:56] just a wonderful cycle of of the love of
[2:38:00] God being shed and our hearts and eyes
[2:38:04] being opened and and and just growing
[2:38:08] in in the things of God and walking with
[2:38:12] him and that as he penetrates you and
[2:38:17] permeates you, then your cup overflows.
[2:38:22] And uh and I think that's the greatest
[2:38:25] thing that can happen in this day is
[2:38:27] that our cups
[2:38:29] overflow with the love of God to all
[2:38:33] people. And and I like if you always
[2:38:36] look in the mirror, I've always been
[2:38:39] able to look at my past and say, "If God
[2:38:42] could save me, he could save anybody."
[2:38:46] You know, if he could open my eyes, he
[2:38:49] could open the eyes of anybody. I don't
[2:38:52] need to prejudge. I don't need to to
[2:38:55] label or anything. If I would just so
[2:38:58] let my light shine amongst men that our
[2:39:02] good works would glorify the father in
[2:39:04] heaven. And if I be lifted up, I'll draw
[2:39:07] all men. Nigh and you. The simplicity of
[2:39:11] the gospel is a wonderful thing. Uh, I
[2:39:15] know this is kind of a cold season.
[2:39:18] We're only going to have one service
[2:39:21] today and it's it's uh
[2:39:25] going to be cold for a few days. Uh,
[2:39:28] Wednesday night, even if we just have to
[2:39:31] get a small streaming crew together,
[2:39:34] we'll have service Wednesday night. But
[2:39:38] if you're uh feel it's too cold to bring
[2:39:42] your family out or it's too treacherous
[2:39:45] to drive, then uh don't feel any
[2:39:48] obligation to come out to the house of
[2:39:52] the Lord and uh put on a tape and or uh
[2:39:58] uh just spend that time that Matthew
[2:40:01] spoke of getting down where you shut the
[2:40:03] doors and it's you and him alone and
[2:40:06] just spend time with him. And if we do
[2:40:09] that, we certainly will grow in the in
[2:40:12] the gospel. Uh next Sunday morning, if
[2:40:16] the Lord would grant me the strength, we
[2:40:19] want to minister out of the message the
[2:40:21] oddball.
[2:40:23] And uh so you might uh we've been
[2:40:25] talking with the brothers about that
[2:40:28] different places about the oddball.
[2:40:31] And so if you want to listen to that
[2:40:33] tape before next Sunday, um it it would
[2:40:37] be good. So it was nice to have Cosman
[2:40:40] with us today. The trouble was you came
[2:40:43] all the way to Texas and got the same
[2:40:45] weather he has in Romania. So you know
[2:40:49] if you might as well have the same
[2:40:50] weather if you have the same gospel,
[2:40:53] &gt;&gt; right? So we thank the Lord for that. So
[2:40:57] uh we will have service this Wednesday.
[2:41:00] Keep tact of your emails. We may only
[2:41:03] have one service next Sunday depending
[2:41:06] on what the trend is, but it's going to
[2:41:10] be cold. So, let your spirits be warm
[2:41:14] that people can be blessed by you.
[2:41:18] Certainly do that. Let's bow our heads
[2:41:20] as we close. Our father,
[2:41:25] we've heard today of the many things
[2:41:27] that we forget.
[2:41:31] Father, that
[2:41:34] sometimes our hearts and our minds
[2:41:38] cause us to believe that our trials and
[2:41:41] tribulations are greater than you are.
[2:41:46] or the weakness in our flesh
[2:41:51] beats us down to the place that we don't
[2:41:54] feel any longer worthy of your love.
[2:41:59] But yet in your word, you said, "Well,
[2:42:01] we were yet sinners. You loved us.
[2:42:06] You didn't love us because of what we've
[2:42:08] done.
[2:42:09] You loved us because we're your
[2:42:11] children.
[2:42:14] And even as a mother has undying love
[2:42:17] for her child, your love is even greater
[2:42:20] than that.
[2:42:22] And we thank you for that, Father. And
[2:42:25] our desire is that we as individuals are
[2:42:28] capped with that love.
[2:42:31] That that love becomes the fountain of
[2:42:34] our strength,
[2:42:36] becomes the melody in the words that we
[2:42:40] speak.
[2:42:42] It becomes the mind by which we
[2:42:46] reason
[2:42:48] that love becomes the motivation behind
[2:42:52] the things that we do.
[2:42:56] And father that
[2:42:59] you so loved us and you said it was
[2:43:01] freely given to us. You freely gave your
[2:43:05] love to us. Father may we freely give
[2:43:07] our love to others.
[2:43:12] May we look on every man's need as
[2:43:14] greater than our own. That this mind
[2:43:16] that was in Christ Jesus may be in us.
[2:43:21] Father, that we be truly representatives
[2:43:24] of the love that you have. For God is
[2:43:26] love
[2:43:31] and our Lord and Savior was an
[2:43:33] expression of that love.
[2:43:37] And many told us, he said, "The works
[2:43:40] that I do, you shall do also,
[2:43:43] cuz I'll not leave you comfortless,
[2:43:46] but I'll be with you,
[2:43:50] even in you till the end."
[2:43:54] Father, we know we're near the end,
[2:43:58] and we ask, Father, that you be with us
[2:44:01] more than ever. Bless those that have
[2:44:04] come out today that join in with us. We
[2:44:08] so appreciate it. Our musicians,
[2:44:12] Matthew bringing the word of the Lord.
[2:44:16] Our deacons that came out, Father, just
[2:44:19] here and those of you that are with us
[2:44:22] online.
[2:44:24] May you know that he loves you
[2:44:27] and that with him all things are
[2:44:30] possible.
[2:44:32] Take courage,
[2:44:33] be strong, be not afraid, neither be
[2:44:37] thou dismayed. For I, the Lord thy God,
[2:44:40] are with thee so wherever thou goest.
[2:44:44] Lord, may these great words of Joshua
[2:44:46] 1:9 be our strength for this upcoming
[2:44:49] week. Guide us through the storm.
[2:44:52] Father, give us wisdom concerning our
[2:44:55] church schedule.
[2:44:57] Father, give us wisdom concerning
[2:44:59] driving and traveling. We ask that you
[2:45:03] would grant it to us in Jesus precious
[2:45:06] name we pray. Amen. Amen. There's no
[2:45:10] service this evening. Uh for those of
[2:45:13] you that are looking for your tithe and
[2:45:16] authoring receipts, they're in the
[2:45:18] library in alphabetical order in an
[2:45:21] envelope. You can be sure to take that.
[2:45:24] uh if the amounts aren't correct on it
[2:45:27] in any way, we can make adjustments for
[2:45:30] you. So, we just trust that you love the
[2:45:32] Lord. You love the Lord.
[2:45:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Go in peace this morning.
[2:45:37] Amen.
[2:45:52] Crazy.
[2:46:13] Oh.
[2:46:34] Heat. Heat.
[2:46:44] Around the moon.
[2:47:03] Heat. Heat.
[2:47:26] Heat. Heat.
[2:47:49] Oh,
[2:47:54] you
