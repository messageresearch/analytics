Description:
Br. Tom Rae
Christian Life Tabernacle
November Meetings
November 12, 2023
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

this morning we ask that you would so stand in our presence that each one of us would come to know you that we would become closer to you Hallelujah that our relationship with you would grow Lord we ask you to bless us this morning in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray amen amen God bless you you may be seated amen we've certainly had a time with uh the flu roll rolling through us and uh it's good to see slowly people getting back out to the house of the Lord and and uh overcoming still of some uh down I'm starting to do better and I I knew I would have to do better with some of the prayers that have been said on my behalf and uh I got texts that said be healed I said amen and uh so uh it uh certainly uh is wonderful uh about uh the goodness of God you know I I've just I've been reading in Galatians 3 and it's uh starting to mean a lot to me when Paul told the church he said you know how did you receive the spirit did you receive it by the law or did you receive it by faith and uh to think that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God that that it's not something that you muster up it's something that's quickened to you that you hear something and and it it connects with something inside of you and Faith Comes rising to the surface and that's what Paul wanted the uh Church to remember that it it's don't move back away from faith and all of a sudden think you're going to become perfect in your lives you know what I mean that you're going to do something no if you want to have faith you've got to keep hearing the word of God Amen if it's not it becomes a different kind of faith it becomes a faith I believe this I believe that I believe that and Faith isn't an I believe amen faith is an understanding of what's going to happen amen and I believe that this message is calling out a bride how many beli that how many believe that all what the prophet did and all that he came here to do had an end result it was a purpose for it it was to accomplish something it was going to cause something to happen and so we've kind of put in our heart for this meeting it was the realization that in an hour that there's so many voices and so many fingers pointing in so many directions and we're flooded with decision making and and it's hard I remember one time Aaron preached the a a message my son Aaron about choices and he said yes he says nowadays there is 127 varieties of water that you can choose from there's even water that makes you smart well I've drinking about 25 gallons of that and I'm still Dumber in a mud fence you know what I mean and there's energy water and there there's you know this water and that water and glacier water and hund you can't even walk up and get a glass of water without being slammed with so many choices and it's it's a burden uh the world's under but yet by faith you've made a choice and by faith you found the light and by faith you found the path and by faith you make the choice of what direction you're going in and that's what uh the Lord put on my heart is which way shall we go there's many ways offered out there now sure many movements many uh uh voices many personalities and and a a lot of choice lights be which way should we lean what what should we get involved in shall we seek gifts shall we seek this shall we seek that and uh where should we put our effort where should we put our time what is it that God wants from us as a people and if not if you never come in conflict and and you never come to the place where you start asking yourself these questions where am I going what what's my effort what's my life what's my thought process then you end up on that sea of just drifting and being tossed to and fro by every wind of Doctrine and your sails never catch the wind of the spirit and you never start moving towards the Eternal goal and I I I like I believe in my heart I believe that we're in a war and we're fighting for the Rapture amen exactly right amen if there's anything that Satan does want you to do is leave CU you're the whole thing that's holding this whole thing together and if he can get us to stay then he is he has more life and more time and we have a promise that the days would be shortened L any flesh would be saved and boy if you're ever seeing a time sure of things that just come upon the Earth that can you imagine taking a whole generation of young people and youth and actually getting them to such a mental confusion that they're not sure whether they're boys or girls that's some that imagine the oppression of the Mind of a young person that's got to be put through that that's the devil that that's who we fight sure and we're an army are fitted and joined together and we've come to fight the fight so we ask the lord lord we need guidance we need to know what way would you have us to go what direction would you have us to turn our hearts to what are the things that we should set our mind on and not just as individuals uh but as a as a people and I believe the Lord started answering that when brother Murphy began to preach to us and he began to tell us you know God's jealous over you amen doesn't mean he wants what you've got it means he's consumed with what's best for you amen he he he he wants to Shepherd you he wants to supply all your needs he wants to be your God can you imagine someone just begging let me be to you what I am I can do for you exceedingly and abundantly above which you can even ask their thing and I'm here I want to do it I want to be your God I want to lead you I want to guide you I want to protect you I'm Jehovah Gyra I want to provide for you and as brother Murphy said God earned those titles you understand he did something that caused that title to be placed upon him he provided so he became Jehovah Gyra and our it stirred us up and uh and and he he went on to talk about that not if that if you're jealous and you're jealous of God that jealousy produces a Zeal and and you become zealous and what a cry for us to get back into the message to get back on fire not to be ashamed of it because it's the power of God under salvation and and and that that great hidden beatitude of of the Lord that simply says blessed is he who is not offended in me and what a call for us to fall back in love with the message of the hour what it stands for what it the works the Vindication the truths that it had and and and just almost like the Lord speaking to us and and uh how that God that gave you faith and what a call from the spirit for us as a body of Believers to all come back together and start falling back in love and bringing ourselves under the uh that voice for our day and that stirred me up and then how beautiful uh brother Michael F followed right behind it amen and talking about the the great parable of the great wedding Feast that we've been invited to and and and just walking down through that that Parable with us and how how that he brought out I thought it was fantastic how he brought out the man that was in his own garment you know the man that sits in church but he comes to church but he's not part of the body he's not part of the ministry you know uh he's he's he's what the pastor has to say but uh he measures it himself and he analysises it and decides what he'll take and what he won't take you know he just he he just hasn't joined up to it you know he he doesn't want to be fitted in with the brothers and around him or the sisters around him he's got his own life he's got his own walk he's got his own dress he's got his own clothes he's got his own thinking basically in the midst of the whole church he's doing his own thing and I think how the spirit of God spoke out hey I brought you together amen I'm the god that assembled you I'm the god that called you I'm the god that wants you to be a part of one another because they'll know that you are my disciples by your love one for another and how that he went on to preach to us about that there's a garment that we have to wear and the great tailor of that garment thought it was beautiful yes was the word of God for the hour the elaser that came to dress us and he started quoting messages that started sewing the Garment together and that the bride would had adorned herself amen and made herself ready yes and oh what a call of the spirit to the church hey church start making yourself ready amen start putting on the Garment start getting dressed and and and the kindness of the Lord speaking to us it's not too late you can start today you you don't know what I mean you can't take those filthy rags off yourself but you can present yourself to him say Here I Am Lord dress me speak to me amen and he's going to cloth each one of you as his bride many membered bride one husband all throughout the scriptures and types in in this in the Bible and what called to us to return to a dedicated life and just starting to put the full armor of God on and and and to start getting the word of God back in our lives and to apply the token and where we're short then talk it over with them and and stay in his presence and let them do for you exceedingly and abundantly above what you can even ask or think and and I it just kind of brought us up I just see the Lord pulling us and pulling me personally David get more dedicated dig deeper into the word of God read it listen I'm going to speak to you I have things to show you that you don't know and uh um and I have to say yes Lord and make myself available and hear you him I got to look and and let him mold me just the way and and and like I said I didn't want this meeting to be a meeting dealing with individuals but I wanted it to be a meeting dealing with us as a church those that come here and fellowship together that we as a body of Believers would have a light that Shin that our licks of fire would become brighter and brighter and brighter and I just thought the Lord has brought us and now we've come to another time for God to speak amen because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God so we have another time in in which the Lord could uh once again tell us of the way that he wants us to go we've heard what he said thus far and so I think that it's just a continual of thing of getting us going in the right path because wide is the way to destruction and narrow is the way and few be that find it and and and I don't want to miss it now I've come too far to miss it now I don't even want to think what the results are going to be of a wrong turn in this hour and if we could all take that seriously into our heart this morning and know beyond the shadow of a doubt that the Lord is here this morning to speak to us amen now he may use brother Tom this morning whom I love dearly but I look past that Veil and I believe that there's going to be something that the Lord is wanting to tell us and you say why do you know that God's because I ask and the word says if you ask you shall receive I asked the Lord if he would send brother Murphy brother Mike and brother Tom to preach this last meeting by the grace of God we'll have in this building and Tom looked at me and he said it ain't happening I say yeah all right you don't know how impr profitable that what's happened it's like the Coupee de gr to get almost the full ministry of that church down here God had to create a conflict between India and Canada to make it happen had to close all the Visas between Canada and India it's it's a great thing God's done I'm trying to tell you what has happened is really phenomenal oh my and and it's for a purpose amen it's because God wants our body to go in the right direction and Shine the right light have the right approach have the right attitude have the right spirit and have the right word and I'm grateful that he's got that concern for us that he would bring something that's very difficult to happen to come to pass so my heart's on fire and I I want to do my part I want him to stir me up that I could take my place and be fitted in the join together and each of us could take our place and that we could become what he wants us to be United this is the uniting time it's the invisible Union it's a it's a great hour that we live in so uh we at this time we're just going to stand and and let's sing that song that we got to sing in one year and it just kind of thrilled our hearts and and what we're here to do is we're here to magnify the Lord together right let me say it this way to you this poor man cried yes sir said Lord I'd like brother Murphy Wong and brother Mike and brother Tom to come down and preach a meeting and I'd like you father to in this meeting show us the way show us which way you'd like us to go what what what what work would you have us to do

uh I thank Brother David make this possible you don't know the sacrifice that he's done for our family I'll be indebted forever thank you am I supposed to be correct to say Pastor McGary sorry so sorry but I have an in I've got the best of the best of friends I got my dear friend brother Murphy we've traveled much together I've been privileged to travel with brother Michael and to have my sons all here and there I want to say they're adorable wives that I adore them they've been gifts to me and Joanne we're thankful for them we're indeed thankful for them to have this privilege and honor to stand before you this morning on this Resurrection morning the message you the only thing you're going to hear from me is the message I got nothing else to say I've got no other thought to present the Bible is my absolute and this message and the Bible are one as far as I'm concern and uh if you get another thought well that's your thought but for as as far is for me and my house we serve this Christ I've got at the end here I'm Michael and Sam and Joel and her wives and I just like to tell the church this message works this message Works um years ago brother Bisal wrote on or said something at a camp meeting for me I always go back to that it was August 24th 1988 and word was ministered and there was quite an in a presence of the Lord and brother bcll got under that anointing I just a deacon at the time wasn't even a preacher just maybe just started preaching and he cried out he says I give you your children well there I had little little ones then I think Sam was about nine and Mike would have been about six and Joel would have been about three or four I held on to that all my life and by the grace of God they're all here amen I want to tell you it works it works the gospel Works amen only believe all things are possible amen I'm just thankful to the Lord Jesus sister lesie she's a unsung hero she sits back there and almost invisible but David needed her she's amazing you should have seen what happened yesterday she is more than a conqueror ah we love you much sister lesie brother David your family thank you thank you for this Grand opportunity don't don't take it lightly can we just pray one more time One More Time Lord so often we sing The Little Chorus his goodness was running after running after me it was not in our own goodness Lord it was in your grace and we love the grace of God this morning Lord for everyone that's represented here maybe some young man or some young lady that has not even tapped into or realized Lord the benefits of the Gospel Calvary of the blood of Jesus Christ and the Redemptive power and what this message holds Lord I just pray that you'll speak to every heart every life and let the word of God feed their hungry Souls Lord to commit now the service to you in Jesus name amen amen without any further delay let's turn to John chapter 14 I feel like I'm the uh the mint after the dinner I mean you had a seven course meal then you had another seven course meal and you know at the end when they bring your check there's a little candy on it I feel I'm giving you the candy this morning these are preachers I I looked in the mirror and I said man Tom you're getting old so I'll just take it a little bit slower all right all right we've been here a few years now I I was trying to figure out how many years but we're going over 10 or 12 or whatever years and and look at me look at me I'm still white I I've been white haired since 35 I guess but one day we'll be changed in a in a moment amen okay John 14 please St John chapter 14 Brother David mentioned this last night we're always looking as preachers we're always looking for confirmations and uh Michael knows I got up from the table the other day and I said we just waiting for that time when the spark Sparks and by the grace of God the spark sparked and then Brother David takes my scripture so I'll just pay the bill we'll go home okay John 1 uh 141 please let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also I love that scripture that where he is you will be also amen and whether I go I want you to make special note of ye know okay I want you to get this now and whether I go ye know and the way you know Thomas said unto him now notice here Thomas gets a lot like Brother David said he took my whole sermon in five minutes Thomas gets a rap my name's Thomas by the way Thomas said unto the Lord we know not whether thou goest I wanted to take special note there because you know brother Braham said in one place he said you got to dig a Little Deeper it's not like reading a newspaper you got to dig a Little Deeper when you read the Bible you know you take that Bible read that verse look at that verse what is Jesus trying to say here what is it meaning whether I go you I go you know and the way you know what that's the Lord speaking isn't it that's did did I read that right did I say he this is what he's saying and whether I go you know and the way you know so that's God speaking letting you know you know that's right so here comes Thomas and he said unto the Lord we know not whether what are you talking about the Lord just said you know right you know what's your question this morning right there should not be a question yes of where you're going and we'll be looking at that as we go and what the Thomas said we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way those are all important notes right okay those are all important notes you've ever had somebody that knows it all and you call them a know it all you know people look at at at you and they they have a question and we by the grace of God by the word of God have the answer that's right and so the word of God is our answer so now we're going to look at the scripture to let you know that you know Hallelujah where the bride's going without question am I going he says what did he what did we read whether I go you know and the way you know Thomas said unto him Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way Jesus said unto him I am the way you want to know the way Christ is the way the word is the way he's your absolute there's no man there's not no Doctrine there is nothing that is your absolute outside this word am all right are we established are we your idea I care I care nothing on how you think God gave us the mind of God in this generation through melai 4 period yes sir if you don't want it well you know my next statement don't you there's the doors like brother said to me he said uh you're the only preacher I've ever heard that said go most preachers are saying come come on we need more numbers hey my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow so if you're not one of his sheep somewhere along the line you're going to be offended you're going to be hurt your feelings are going to be hurt but my sheep know my my voice 70 disciples left will you go also Peter he said where can we go amen you have the words of eternal life cuz God knew he knew amen that's right God knew he knew and you got to know you know and once you know nothing can shake [Music] you Hallelujah you should Rejoice you should thank God yes that God already knows you know you might question about it but he's trying to tell you you know already I am the way the truth and the life Hallelujah may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word and you can stand to the rest of the service you may have your seats I have a brother-in-law back back home and sang this or wrote this song when I get carried away I'll get carried away well so often I get carried away maybe we can get carried away this morning in the presence of the Lord amen do you know yes I know do you sing that song I really know are you really are you with me stay with me cuz I'm not going to be long now you've had a full like I said I'm going to give you the candy thank you mury he's doing to me what I did to the Philippines do you really know I I'm serious here I want to lie I remind me Billy we got to sing that song okay yes I know I really know Jesus blood make them violence clean yes I do you know Jesus blood ah wonderful we're just laying a little Foundation do you know I really know and I'd love you to say that I really know I I really know I know in whom I have believed so we're going to take a look at the word obviously know just so that you'll know yes I know I really know it's amazing today how Satan has tried to pervert the minds of the people in every area and aspect of life deform it so that it cannot absorb the thought and the word of the Lord I don't care what it is I really don't care I don't care if it's Sports I don't care if it's uh people start them or what people get attracted to to waste their time Satan in every area will try to absorb your thoughts and pervert it in at the same time same time it's never like you're doing something and finally you get perverted his intent is everything outside of the Gospel is to pervert your thinking so that when you read something it's a distraction in your mind already you can't even concentrate I had a statistics one time and I I I should have brought it but I didn't plan on going down this route but I'll since I know the statistic of it they said man's attention span at this point in time is the attention span of a goldfish you say that's funny that's bad that's really bad so they're saying human it used to be that you could hold somebody for 10 or 15 minutes in their in their in a in a span of conversation then it got down to a minute and now it's it's down to 8.6 seconds eight minutes and six seconds that you can actually I've already used up my time Billy you have a song you want to close isn't that amazing they can get it down to a statistic that you sit here and somewhere already you're work tomorrow mhm who's playing whatever whatever you've got to do whatever the facts it is I and because I can't I I don't know where you're thinking but unless you're focusing on what I'm saying you're somewhere I'd like you to say right here you're more than a goldfish really amen you really they said where where Hollywood is doing they have to change a scene every five seconds seconds so that the children could actually follow along in their story every five seconds we use well I I've come from the world so I know who John Wayne any anybody know who John Wayne is you're I'm in Texas aren't I John Wayne you ever watch one of their movies I mean I mean it must have been cheap for them because all you saw all day was the guy rid his horse and the sheriff's after him riding his horse and for half an hour they're riding the horse but you were glued to the riding the horse but today now they got to keep on changing it just like this they keep the attention what Satan is trying to do is to distract you to know God he's trying to alter your thinking right I just brother Bram said in the message and and brother I asked for his book I got the quote here I at the last minute I I pasted it here but I got it here now in book form brother Bram says now he says I want to emphasize something God the great spirit he's God and did you know you were in him if you a Christian you was in him then and if that be so the whole godhead bodily shaped up in the person of Jesus Christ you were in him so the scripture says the fullness of the godhead dwelt bodily in Christ you were in him then come on Saints I want to help to clear up some of the fog of your sinking you were with him at Calvary you were with him when they beat him you were with him in the Tomb but when he rose again you were with him Hallelujah it wasn't Act of the fact it's not a history you were in him if you were in him you are always in him you were in him before the foundation of the world Hallelujah so in him Saints we have the victory we don't have to try and have the victory we have the victory so we were in God and if that be so then the whole godhead bodily was shaped Up in Jesus Christ and in him for he was the fullness of the word manifested knowing that he would be manifest I'm sorry knowing that he was going to Calvary he went we we who's a we we went in the grave with him we raised with him and now we've ascended that's why he says you're in Heavenly places always come on stay with me church we are in Heavenly places always so now what Satan is trying to do by his program is to get you out of heavenly places so then if we we've went to the cross with him we went to the Grave with him we rose with him we ascended with him Heavenly places we went in the grave with him we raised in the resurrection now we've ascended by his Spirit to the throne of grace sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus for The Germ of Natural Life brought was brought is brought down germatize from father to father to father so is the Life of Christ gerti that's the reason God used Elijah's Spirit five times what is it it's a handing down just as your natural life and trait is handed down let this mind that was in Christ be in you not chat GPT huh that is called artificial intelligence what is Satan trying to do to you I I brother Michael gave me a uh an example of how it works we would like to greet you from Christian Bible Way Christian Academy thank you for enrolling your student can you give me a nice letter and that's better than I could say it that was WR a letter huh that's artificial intelligence but that's not God's intelligence what is he trying to do parallel parallel parallel trying to get you distracted from the mind of God so Jesus wants you to know that he knows you know the way God sent you a message to show you the way knowledge and civilization true Christianity has nothing in common did you get that we have nothing in common civilization true Christianity has not one thing in common wow we could probably stop there and meditate on that one you can either get a church in bondage or liberated civilization is by knowledge we all know that knowledge is is from Eden what he preached in Eden knowledge causes death is that right what causes death in the Garden of Eden knowledge but can't be of God so it's of the devil was that a good one H you just thought this was a cool but your Prophet said that was a good one that was a good one can I read that again because it was a good one what caused death in the Garden of Eden knowledge but it can't be of God so it's of the devil that's a good one knowledge Science Education is the greatest hindrance that God ever had as your pastor was saying brother BR goes on to say it's of the devil and what God is really trying to do through this word is to show you the correct way the way is Christ you say well you just wrote that message out because of Brother David no no no no no no no no this mess I already had this message before Brother David quoted this here's an old saying for you those of you who think you know everything are very annoying to those of us who do that's a quotable quote can I say it again because you probably need it three or four times to really get the the meaning of that it's like one brother said you'll get it tomorrow those of you who think you know everything are very annoying to those of us who do so it's not a a new thing it's called that was an old saying brother Braham said in the message what is the works of God not knowing the Bible you have eternal life a lot of people can quote and there's there's men that have literally memorized the whole Bible but what is that done for them the letter kth but the spirit gives life says you have eternal life you've always had eternal life but to know him is to have eternal life to know him you might not know one word of the Bible but if you know him in the power of his resurrection that is eternal life do you know him say yes I know him I know him in the power of his resurrection I don't know about Jesus I know him as a person Hallelujah Bible says in Matthew uh St Matthew 11:25 at that time Jesus answered and said I thank the father oh Lord of Heaven and Earth thou has hid these things from the wise and The Prudent and has revealed them unto babes that new Believers in the Greek to those who are seeking God's Will and purpose even so father for it seems good in thy sight now let me let me give a little testimony we have a a a young man that just got saved from Thailand in out of the mountains of Thailand and he was flown over to Canada when he was 5 years old went to Ottawa with his mom and and Dad and ended up now at 20 years old in Cloverdale witnessed by one of our young men I baptized him and before I baptized him I'd like to talk to those that I take to the Waters of baptism I said well when did God start dealing with you young fella his name is lurar when when did when did God start dealing with you is the answer Brother David always he said from a little boy God's always dealt with me and I thought right answer I said right answer he's like a a bright silver dollar wherever he sits in the assembly now he's he used to be up in the balcony but now he's sitting in the front row but I think about it we've always had the seed of God in us and that's why Jesus could say I know you know I know you know because when you walked into this church come on when you walked into this little church we're just a bunch of rag tag people who are we but there's something in you that desired the God that was in somebody else and God by his grace and his presence awakened that seed within your life Peter said to Jesus Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God he said blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah have a man uh no man taught you but my Father in Heaven has revealed this to you so if you're ever going to know God you have to know him by Revelation and those that are the seeds of God will know him by Revelation it's not a carrot on a stick that you hope you're going to get if you're his seed you will get it so Paul could say in second Timothy 1 and 12 brother John this is what he could say for I know in whom I have believed and am persuaded he's able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day I know now I know has two meanings we have josco and then you could have epig josco or you can have IDU epig genosco in the know is to learn and there's nobody here that can learn God you can learn a trade you can learn to sew but you cannot learn God but can I say the Ed do no is a perfect knowledge that is in the seed so you didn't learn the message the seed in you started to awaken to the Revelation this message is Christ nobody has to teach you that God teaches you that it's a knowledge which in with which is within and if you look it up it's a perfect knowledge so he got these people say I got a revelation I got a revelation and five years later they go that is not a perfect knowledge that is an EP that was a learning of the message you say well they were good believers they learned how to dress right they learned how to talk right they learned how to amen hallelujah we are one in the spirit huh they learned all that but those that are the seing of God we didn't learn it it was from within that's my Jesus that's my [Applause] eag Hallelujah but because you're living in an age of knowledge they said every 20 it used to be brother Rond talked about the horse and buggy horse and buggy to car car to Jet Jet to astronaut and Jim you would know that because you're in the airplane business they're always upgrading I don't want a DC3 why would I want a DC3 bunch of propellers no I want the Jet and now they got quieter Jets what what what are those things called what do they call those jet housings anyways whatever they are I hate it when my seat is right at that window you got to have those noise cancelling and but now it's getting better and better now they made an announcement this morning there's a new Wing design for better uh for the green what green last time I looked around here there's not even grass around this world's in a birth pain because of knowledge Satan can only be a destroyer that's why all creation Gress waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God letting us brother when she knows who she is then we will be raptured so now you want to know the way he's the way the word's the way this message is the way we get so much distractions and that's what we want to be dealing with not only as a person individual as a church as a body as Believers for I know in whom I have believed I'm persuaded He's Able there was a note written by a little old sister Who Loved this scripture I just read to you she was confined to a bed in a nursing home and the visitors would come to visit her and over the passing of time she said I I know in whom I have believed what I've committed to him but growing weaker the next time they visit they said what I have committed to him she was growing weaker and her voice became faint and she whispered in her lips him him him that was all that was left in her is him Christ him he was everything to her Nam one and seven don't don't need to turn the Lord is good he's strong he's a stronghold in the day of trouble and he knoweth them that trust in him so not only do we know who he is God knows who you are that's why we David cried out the Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup thou maintain us my lot thy lines have fallen unto me in Pleasant places I have a god goodly Heritage the Amplified said the Lord is my is my chosen my assigned portion my cup and you hold and maintain my lot it isn't new holding on to to God it's God holding on to you Daniel 12 and four but thou oh Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall increase how many have used this scripture said in the last days knowledge shall increase everybody I I'm just wondering you know I mean don't be ashamed I mean it's scripture surely you've read the scripture want to put it out hand yeah you've read that scripture okay that's good not if you haven't now you have so now what what does Daniel actually say what is the Hebrew of this I want you to take a look at so we know that knowledge will increase do you think God's interested in Satan's knowledge no you you knowledge would increase AI is going to take over Humanity which it will knowledge will you think God's really interested in Satan's knowledge no I thank you for saying that because he's not for in the Hebrew it says now ask for you Daniel conceal these words seal it up the scroll to the end many will go back and forth search anxiously through this through the scroll or through the books and knowledge now I want you to take a word look a word at that word knowledge that word knowledge is the purpose of God as revealed by His prophets knowledge would increase in the last day so then if knowledge is not the knowledge of Satan's Eden but the knowledge of God in this last days would increase then the purpose of God will be now revealed by his prophet and we will greatly increase it's already been prophesied amen you've already been prophesied that you are going to greatly increase in the purpose of God and what is the purpose of God brother R said that's a three-fold purpose Christ of mystery God revealed is what to restore Eden to restore Adam and to restore Eve so now this purpose of God will be greatly increased when brother Tom when the scroll is open you wouldn't have a clue Cosman you wouldn't have a clue apparently you were overseas what Would You Preach without this message I want ask you what would you preach they say we got the Bible yeah the Catholic church has the Bible the Baptists have the Bible the Pentecostals have the Bible but they don't know what it is but in this day under Daniel's prophecy this knowledge would increase for your purpose this Christ this word has unveiled to bring you to be like him Amen to be like Jesus you sing you sing to be like Jesus on Earth I long to be like him the only way to get there there only one way I'll show you the way I am the way still with me yes many shall run to and fro anxiously looking wondering Looking Through the Bible wondering what does it mean what does it actually say how many of us before we came into this word looked at the Bible wondered what Jesus said go ye all the world baptize them in the name of the father of the Son and the Holy Ghost how many were baptized in a trinity Doctrine but then a message came the book was open the scroll is revealed huh and we found out the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the father Son and Holy Ghost we don't believe in a Triune God he's one God one Lord one baptism Hallelujah God of this evil age we know Satan's gospel is a gospel of Science and progress did you know they say 97% of all jobs will be lost through AI I guess everybody's still going to be on government didn't didn't everybody get that when you're were in Co they couldn't get everybody back to work because they made more through the government handout than they did their job Satan knows how to destroy an economy and that is a great word if you want to take a look at it one day God has an economy also brother Bram said and in God's economy he's not interested in silver and gold because Peter said I Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give you thee in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and behold what God's economy is is God wants to give you himself so that you could be like he is that is your inheritance he maintaines my Lord his lines have fallen on Pleasant places she is him Hallelujah come on people she is him you are him your pastor said the other day we got to grow up we got to grow up brother Bram said in white Christ speak you got to stop being babies come on stop being babies do I cry speak speak the word heard the Red Sea it was the god in Moses amen it's not you that's going to take you out of the trial it's the god in you that's going to get you out of the trial and there should be a little bit more expression because when Miriam Moses was 80 so let's just say she was 10 when they were floating him down the river and mama says go follow the B B she wouldn't have been six cuz she would have drowned so let's say she was walking along the Nile let's give her 10 so Moses is 80 Miriam's 90 and when when pharaoh and his armies were destroyed come on when that that trial come on was opened up and Israel walked through the trial but once through the trial the enemy thought he could go through the same way no sir come on no sir he cannot come through the blood Hallelujah and once he went through that Red Sea God just rained down the waters and there was Miriam with a tambourine your enemy your enemy that has bothered you Hallelujah you will never see [Music] again hallu Hallelujah yes sir you say brother Tom if you had another cigarette huh NOP Pharaoh got he got nailed huh swallowed up have you had another joint Tom have you had another hit Tom have you dropped another tab of I said Tom no sir when that red blood seed opened up for me my enemy was drowned and i' never seen it again Hallelujah who's the way he's the way pillar fires the way the word's the way are we this bad at Murphy at home we P like this at home you should see him when he really unwinds you think Stern preached the word Michael just about flapped himself out of the building last night no this is real saints this is not some head knowledge it's because I EO God I know him how did you learn him I didn't learn him there was something inside that was pushing us hallelujah hallelujah something in us something in us we couldn't stop and we don't want to stop something in US you're the called out as is Israel was called out you're the church elect are you come on come on don't Mumble it to me do not mumble right I hate mumbling say it yes or no right let your yay be yay and your NE nay are you the elect yes all right now that we got that finished hey how many say okay let's do it this way how many aren't elect say no that was music to my ears and I didn't even hear any music isn't that marvelous you said yes and how often you've heard the preacher preach over the pulpit brother Bram said the high priest can't move until you first confess it so you said yes I'm the elect so now the high priest can move on your confession how many want an enemy drowned this morning yes yes amen I'm not Le oretic no more I'm on fire I got fervency I want God I thought the church should have been finished probably six months ago but how many brothers show up for work all you want the benefit whoa I better preach over this way no don't don't worry we had the same we have we I didn't say same problem but it's a problem 10 what is it what is it 20% do the work and 80% what's this is my 8020 that is a law and principle yeah listen are you listening to me real good yes I'm looking at you young men things going to change around here what time do you get off work oh yeah okay see at 4 I'm trying to help huh so so now if God is doing this come on are we really the same as the world 8020 it's a principle actually if you look it up always 20% do all the work and the 80% sit back and say uh little water over here boys hey David you forgot brought that nail over there get you know get that scaffolding up and you're sitting there with your cup of Tim Horton oh you don't have Tim H sorry what do you have down here Dunkin Donuts huh I don't know but we're a body aren't we right am so as a body we move together as a [Music] body all right so we are the church elect oh that got the the meter just went down and once I asked you to do some work he went down I I I shouldn't do that he didn't give me any money to do this either okay who's the church elect amen we are the church elect okay so then that's showing then it's the sign of God in flesh oh my that's what your Prophet said yeah yes sir the one called out the elected Church what are they doing they're showing the sign that God was in flesh are you listening to me Jesus was God in flesh right Jesus was God if Jesus is in you if Jesus in you it's still God manifesting himself in the last days the son a man is revealing himself William brandom's already gone but the son of man Jesus Christ is in the church that's you the [Applause] church hallelujah oh but brother Brandon was the son of man son of man Ministry son of man ministry that's exactly right he's done his work already that's right now it's your turn right to show this world this message is right that's it's not just a convenience that oh the air conditioning it's too cold in here too hot in here I won't come to church today it's what are we talking about we are the elect Church yes so he said that's what you are it's showing that God is in flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight it's still God manifesting himself in the last days H are we in the last days yes are we yes you're seeing Israel the whole world I I remember pre I preached two services on Feast of the trumpets before coming here and that last trumpet brother Braham said in Feast of the trumpets recognizing your day in this message the last Trump to Israel is our seventh seal to the bride how close are we how close are we they attack on y kior y kipor is the day of atonement where they recognize who Messiah is Satan knows how to attack 1973 day of atonement the young ker War but after after the that last Feast comes the Feast of Tabernacles and it was at the in of the Feast of Tabernacle when they were rejoicing in their feasts is when je when the got to be terminology correct here I'll just say Hamas the devil attacked Church natural so if devil will fight the church natural the way they did slaughtering babies now I'm going to you know might as well roll up my sleeves if they will take children chop them up grandmother's in bed those demons are still alive come on daddies come on elders if natural Israel's got to fight to push that devil back what do you got to do when you come to church Preach it Pastor preach it Pastor preach the Worden you say oh it's just you know we're a message it's more than just we're the message the son of man is revealing himself in the church the human flesh making himself known you get it that's what is qu that was that's what he said here do you get it God down here in in the church is making himself again the word come on come on I'm going to take my coat off now I took it off once before about three weeks ago I haven't taken it off in about 10 years but I feel like we got to get we got to fight this devil here

time month I need prayer I said fine honey we'll go over prayer come on standing at the door Chris right back there brother Ed walked by me he says no prayers this morning we're praying for nobody this morning I go what are you talking about I've got a wife that needs prayer I said the Pastor said no prayer no prayer so he comes to the pulpit he said the reason why we didn't pray this morning he said because the Bible talks about that God will confirm his word with signs following Joan was playing at the orgon people came up people left we were the only two people left in the church brother Ed was in a little pastor's study there and he walked out and Joan came walking up front said what do you want honey she said Daddy I want a baby I'll never forget it how could I brother Bisal prayed and his last thing he said he said Lord let life come now and God gave us Michael he's a Miracle working God three years later iy I said how many children do you want there you know the way Christ is your way the word is your way she say I want a baby is said all right so we went to pray brother Ed came up we prayed for Joanne and myself they went to India not for a weekend C Cosman didn't go for 10 days went for five weeks those were the pioneers and he prayed for her and Joanne was expecting how many days later a week or two later on and she was carrying child so I said well we

him she wrote it down on her little calendar she has a calendar box of calendars little calendars like this every day she's got documented she's got the day that the Lord spoke to brother Ed about a son a day and the name so it wasn't made up oh by the way I was in prayer and you know his name's going to be Joel after they heard us no already had the name and when they came home we told them we're expecting and you're going to have a son and his name is Joel well Marilyn was also pregnant at the time I said well they're going to have Joel and I'm having Angela but when that phone rang in

once I got Jesus I got everything Hallelujah musicians please come it's more than a sensation it's more than speaking in tongues it's more than shouting in the spirit it's more than weeping it's God living in man deity God himself tabernacled in that person and when he can speak and it's just the same as God speaking amen that's right you know the way God's giving you a message God's giving you a

way you know can look it up I've got it circled edu edu edu [Music] edu we have to come to a place where we actually know in whom we have believed not persuaded by the preacher as great a men of God they are but there's something in you that's called the SE Gene of God that inside that J is embedded in the a knowing god is my God I can do some things through Christ Jesus I can do what all things all things not you can do all things but I can do all things through [Music] Christ then why don't we just bow our heads right [Music] now I trust it hasn't been that broken up for you this [Music] morning but how many of you would desire that this message become more real for you more real and More Alive alive than it's ever been before and you want to raise your hand and say Jesus make this deedy life of Christ a reality not just work words spoken over a Pulpit Lord living in flesh again living in my flesh for you know that I know the way guide me Lord speak to [Music] me Heavenly [Music] Father getting a little a little weary still love you with all my heart mind soul and strength Lord I can bear witness of your power and your [Music] Authority I've seen it in my own life I've seen it in my family I've seen it in my church I pray for every hand that was lifted and raised Lord that you would make yourself more real let that word become flesh again and may it be the manifestation of the son of man himself our lovely Lord Jesus let us walk with our head held high and our shoulders back knowing Lord that demons tremble yes 200,000,000 Supernatural demons let loose but in that message he had your Prophet preached he said it was the Holy Ghost was bound at those denominational Rivers but the holy ghost is now loosed upon your people breathe the Breath of Life on us Lord let us become more dedicated and consecrated might sing this little song yes I know may we sing it with much more meaning this morning why do I know you've made The vious Sinner clean and if there is a sinner here this morning Lord I I didn't have a clue what was preached all I knew there was something in me that wanted that Jesus would you save the Lost heal the sick and may you be glorified we pray in Jesus name amen amen let's stand please would you mind singing this little [Music] song Come Ye sinner there lost Jesus [Music] blood for he sa oh give him a wave offering [Music] [Music] Hallelujah I surely know Jesus blood can make I [Music] clean oh I just sing that chorus again and I know yes I know clean and I know yes I know Jesus blood can make the viol in a c amen that spoke to my heart this morning [Music] you know I thought of Peter as brother Tom spoke and I thought Lord what are you trying to tell our church and let me put it this way to you as simply as I can it's time to get rid of the self-doubt amen amen it's time to get rid of the excuses you are who he said you are Hallelujah not what the critics say you are not what the devil says you are not all the things he tries to hinder you with you are what he said you are and he said you are my bride and it's time to get rid of the self-doubt it's time to claim your place and do what you're called to do do Peter after denying the Lord three times sure what a weight would that be to overcome but that same Peter walked up to the gate called beautiful and he looked at a man yeah and he said Silver and Gold Have I None right and this is what I believe that the Lord wants this church and this body to be able to say but that which I have yes sir I give unto you Peter personally claimed the possession in life yes of Jesus Christ in him and he didn't doubt [Music] it that which I have I I give and Jesus said it's been freely given yes freely give you can't doubt that who you are you can't doubt what the word of God [Music] says you can't now be made perfect by the law when you receive the Spirit by faith of hearing the word of God so it's just time so I'm a wreck yeah I am I got complexes I got problems I got all that but you know he chose that wreck and he put his spirit in that wreck Hallelujah and he said I'll will hear this W's prayer yeah if this wreck lays his hands on the sick they will recover with all his faults all his negativities I'm going to be with him even in him to the end it didn't determine on what I was it's what he was it wasn't by what I thought it's by what he said that's right and it's by faith yes by Revelation he called me he opened my eyes to see it I believe it and God's word will do what he said he would do and if he said that he put that life in me yes and the works that he did I'll do also I don't do it by righteousness I do it by his word he said if I Lay My Hands on the sick that will recover then I know if I Lay My Hands on the sick they recover why because of the law of my righteousness no because of the faith in his word hallelujah and what's he telling us church I called you I elect you I put you together I called you from all over the world from every place every Kindred every tongue right I've kept my side right now won't you step up amen and identify no more doubt right I am an eagle I am a member of the Bride I am an elect lady I can have and will do the works that he did also because he said so I don't have to look in the [Music] mirror I am the way the truth the [Music] life oh he's longing for each of us to stand up and identify with [Music] him I am what he said I am exactly right hallelujah hallelujah I can do what he said I can do I can have every promise in the book is mine every chapter amen amen every verse yes every line are we ready to stand for what we believe I'm not ashamed of this message I'm not ashamed of this gospel cuz they are the power of God to Salvation I don't care what the world thinks I don't care what the world says I have one voice one Spirit one baptism one God one church and I'm a part of it amen oh can you imagine when the church recognizes who she is is there's another part to that quote and withstands yes sir that's right every devil yep Every Lie Y and every negativity the lies that your own minds are telling yourselves there got to come a time you sit down and you quit listening I am what he said I [Music] am you're sick sure you're sick but he said by his stripes I am healed you're sick you can say I am going to be well I am going to be delivered I am going to set free I am going to overcome why because of my righteousness of the law no because he said [Music] so and alls I can do is speak to the sheep that are the Sheep quit doubting who you are leave those things which are behind behind and press for Higher Calling start wondering whether you're worthy or not to pray whether you're worthy enough to do a miracle you are a miracle the very fact that you've listened to the prophet of God and you believe it is a miracle it's a miracle that David McGary in californ in the condition he was heard this voice that had to be orchestrated in some Divine Province from someplace else to get me to believe this you say well I was raised and you know how many kids are raised this messy don't serve God at all but you do amen that's right got God spoke to your heart this morning believe it say thank you Lord I'm not going to Waller in the negativity of my life and the battles of My Flesh no longer I'm not going to Waller in the complexes and the
