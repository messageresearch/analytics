of giving you the words that are due unto you and we pray God that we could at least surrender our lives and our hearts to you tonight Lord that we can just lay everything down at your feet right now and say Lord you're worthy of it all you're worthy of every word that we could give you you're worthy of every minute that we can give you it's because you loved us Lord and you gave your life for us that we could be free from sin and death and forgiven and we could experience what it means to no longer have any condemnation and to be set free to soar in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus in our position Lord that's what you purchased for us at Calvary and Lord forgive us so many times we live below our privileges we live below the very things that you've given to us and we turn from them Lord but we just ask that you forgive us now for that as we turn and look to you just to come and speak to us tonight Lord that we could receive what you have for us Lord we know that correction starts at the house of God lord where we need correction correct us Lord those that are brokenhearted bind them up those that need Deliverance may they be delivered those that need the filling of the Holy Ghost may they be filled those that need a refilling Lord we pray that you refill us oh God lord may you renew our minds Lord give us Revelation Lord we believe that you've ordained moments like this that we would take one step closer to that great change and the catching away of your bride Lord we know we're on the cusp of the translation Lord it can be any minute it can be any moment Lord and we want to be found faithful your word says will I find faith when I come Lord here we are in the faith that we have as a gift that you have given to us and you sent your word Lord to produce a faith that can believe all things Lord so now here we are we're looking to you you are the author you are the finisher of our faith and we just pray that you'd come and break the bread of Life feed your people I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord if you have your bibles if you can turn in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 amen it's good to be back in the house of God I really enjoyed the meetings we had um my it's good to be able to follow up services like that uh I think that the church house should be full and people should be on fire for God and wanting to testify and just uh uh be so overwhelmed by God's love and his grace and um of course when we go back through the week the devil's always right there to try to beat you down and try to get you distracted and uh that's just the way the devil does things but praise God the devil will do what he does but God will do what he does Amen he'll bind you up he'll speak to your heart he'll get you back on track he'll encourage you we just pray that we can find something in the word of God as a little something on our heart that might be a blessing to you reading out of 2 Corinthians uh chapter 3 we have a little thought we'll just try to work towards uh just how God would bring this out so 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse one it says Do We Begin Again to commend our elves or need we as some other Epistle of commendation to you or letters of condemnation from you you are our Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistles of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not on tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart and such trust have we through Christ to God word not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life amen we just ask you to be seated as we'll just continue uh uh moving towards our text but the prophet of God would say many people just take the letter the letter kth the spirit giveth life see and they take these Creeds and so forth still kth but when you take the spirit that's God himself so when you take the spirit that's God himself so you can even take the message which if you just take the letter form of it it's going to be death if you try to live the message by your efforts or your abilities uh you're going to come up short but he's saying if you take the spirit the letter kth but you take the spirit of God that's God himself how do you know it's God because he is taking the word and manifesting it oh my that's what I want tonight I want God by his Spirit to take the word and manifest it in my life see that's what I want I just don't want to be a so-called good message believer and be able to say Amen to everything the prophet of God said but I want to say Amen to the word but then I want the spirit of the word right because the word is a spirit and the spirit of the word to come upon the word that I've received into the B ground of my heart and that I want that Spirit to make this word a reality see there's a lot of things that are laying within the Bible or laying with in the message and that we believe but I want to say there ought to come a hunger and a cry in the heart of the believer to actually see the manifestation of the things that have been spoken but unfortunately a lot of times we get a little complacent uh we get a little comfortable with our circles and our friends and and saying that we're message Believers and and and you know because we got message Believers on Snapchat and Facebook and Instagram and all of these things and we go to the same churches and the same camps and things you know it's real easy to come and into a Social Circle you know the message has really become a social gospel amongst the youth and amongst many people because we can travel here and we can travel there and and we can listen to the same kind of music and have the same kind of friends and we can be void of the spirit of God taking the message of the hour and actually producing the life of the message my I would say this that even brother Brandon when he preached the message over and over he hammered that these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall do these wonderful things but I wonder if there's even a hunger in the heart of the believer to see the supernatural flowing in your life in and around you that you would be God's hand extended that you would actually be the solution to the problems and the chaos that's out there in the world that when you go into the marketplace or you go into your school that you could real understand that Christ is wanting to in Tabernacle himself in your body that you could be the very one to look on the need of somebody else and say you know I know a God that can heal you I have a word that can deliver you I've actually come in contact with a resource that can meet every need that you have and I want to testify to you a little bit about the goodness of God I want to testify to you about the grace of God because God's done something Supernatural for me but a lot of times we're lacking those very abilities to testify because we've never come into a true uh contact with the power of God where we've been on the sacred sands on the back side of the desert and we've come to that burning bush where we're changed well come on help me out a little bit if you haven't been there get there it's going home time it's the same gospel it's the same way every single one of us have to come uh Jesus Christ's first Doctrine was you must be born again and when you're born again it's now the life of God coming into the individual to make the word a reality if you're seeing things laying in the word that is not a reality in your life then I say we want to come into a place of desperation and prayer that we would call out to God and say I'm hearing the word preach I'm reading in the Bible I'm listening to on the tapes I hear what the prophet said but Lord I'm seeing that there's a lacking of those things in our life and I want to say it's more than just having power it's more than just having the signs and wonders following us but we want to have the fruits of the spirit we we and we want to have the humility we want to have the life because I want to tell you when you live in his present it produces a humility and the reason why we indulge in so many carnal things that we indulge in and we talk about certain things and the musics we listen to and the people and things that we entertain is because we're not living in his present you wonder why the prophet of God was so sensitive and so reverent and so fearful and had such hum humility because he was Walking In The Presence of Jehovah but many times we entertain so many things because we're far from his presence it's far from our thinking but what we want to do is we want to take the life look the letter kth it's not enough to just say you believe it but we want the life of the word to come and and and then when you are taking the spirit that's God himself how do you know it's God because he's taking the word and he's manifesting see then it's God himself oh my spoken word so Jesus would say in John 663 he say it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life if you haven't found out yet you're going to find out that the flesh can profit you nothing there's not enough good works there's not enough good things you can say there's not enough good things you can do to save you because if there was anything uh that you could do to save you then Christ died in vain so we understand it's not by works and it's not by the flesh there is nothing that you can do that would warn that but it's the word of God that he has spoken and the words that he speaks unto they are spirit and they are life it's more than letter that's right that's right the message is more than letter right it's more than a good sermon it's more than just a wow factor I've never heard that before but there's a life behind the word there's a life behind the word the the words that I speak unto you the very thing that you are hearing there's a life behind it there's a life that is attached to the word if I can say there's a spirit that's attached to the word and Lord if you're speaking to me if you're speaking your word that I want the life of the word to take the seed word and produce the manifestation of it in my life true humility true love true reverence and fear as Paul would say in Romans 8 he says in Romans 8 chap uh uh chapter 8 ver3 he says for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh I like that because there was no one else that could condemn sin in the flesh everybody that came up to sin oh they they died under the penalty of sin but Christ came he fulfilled the law and he condemned sin in the flesh he conquered sin he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered the grave he conquered all things that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there's the key we want to walk after the uh uh the spirit not after the Flesh and if we were to continue on in Corinthians as I was almost prone to do because it's so uh uh rich and wonderful uh uh Paul would go on and start talking about uh uh the the ministration of death that that Moses brought how he had to be veiled and he would start to say look if if that uh if if the ministry of the law was so glor glorious uh that Moses had to Veil his face and to think that it was so glorious that he had to Veil Veil his face and that that glory is to be done away with that there's another Glory that'll never pass away oh my that that God is veiling himself now in human beings God came under the ministry of of Malachi 4:5 and Luke 17:30 and again he veiled himself God veiling himself that he might unveil himself that you the believer might see the unveiled God standing before you and now the same life that was being veiled to the age could come now and live in you that you now would become veiled but we just want to move towards the thought here uh uh and just continuing in second Corinthians uh uh now in uh verse 17 he says now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty now I love that I I don't know what you think about when you say uh where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty and certainly there is Liberty to worship God in the house of God and there is Liberty to dance and scream and run and shout and do all yes there is Liberty to do all those things but I want to tell you that's really not so much the Liberty especially when you get together and and you know I would say if you've ever uh gone to high school you know on Fridays they they would have what they call their big pepper alties you know go BL go Blue go Big Red we're going to go stomp out whoever this is and they get their fancy sayings and and they do their little banners and everybody comes and does a a big hoop raw and the band plays and everybody cheers and and everybody hollers and you know that's that's not such a big thing to see a bunch of people hollering and screaming it's not such a big thing to see a bunch of people screaming and hollering at a ball game you know that's no big great mystery because they're getting in the spirit but I tell you where there is Liberty when you can be outside of the ball game if you will if you can be outside of the church church house if you can be there on a Monday morning on a Tuesday morning when nothing's going right and the boss has fired you and you feel like your whole world's coming apart and you don't know how you're going to pay the bills you can look up and say oh God I'm looking up because my Redemption draws there there is Liberty in the spirit that you're not bound by the ways of man you're not bound by what this world can do you're not bound by the god of Lady OA you are bound by the word of God you're bound by the spirit of God and you can give him glory in all things that's Liberty do you have it tonight well shake off those heavy bands lift up those holy hands I say it's time we live in the liberty of the spirit I'm talking about Liberty where you're not in bondage to the flesh anymore you say you're living in Liberty but you can't even turn your head from the deceitful lusts that are out there in the world you say you're living you're living in Liberty when you can't get your head out of social media you're living in Liberty when you're so drawn to the news and to the politics and that it's affecting the way that you act and the way that you think that's not Liberty in the spirit I want a liberty to love my God I want a liberty to walk in his presence I want a a liberty to shun the wrong and do the right I want a liberty when when all those uhhh things out there walk by naked that there's nothing there drawing on flesh because I'm walking in Liberty I I'm walking towards Glory I'm walking towards a promise Lord none of these things Lord I don't want anything this world has to offer because I'm walking in the liberty of the spirit are you walking in the liberty of The Spirit Well give me some Joshua and calebs and some Davids that are walking in the liberty of the spirit do we know what we're talking about do we know what we believe are we all bound up well walk through your day walk through your Monday walk through your Tuesday walk through Wednesday getting here were you walking in Liberty were you just so on fire for God so happy to be a Christian I hope somebody knows what I'm talking about is there somebody here that loves Jesus is there somebody here that's on fire for God is there somebody here that knows what it's like to have been bound in darkness and sin and been set free is there somebody here what knows what the liberty of the spirit is that you don't have to have all the fancy uh uh things of lady oia but but you're satisfied with the word of God you're satisfied with Malachi 45 I don't need some fancy thing to tickle my eardrums I got the word of life and the words that have been spoken by a Vindicated Prophet they are spirit and they are life and it produces a liberty well Hallelujah but we all with an open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord so what is it that is changing us it is the spirit of the Lord that is changing us from Glory unto glory and maybe if we were to uh uh speak a little this tonight to you we just want to be preaching on changing from glory to glory the prophet of God would say in the unveiling of God he' say and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God see here we are the light over the word as the light of the sun changes the seed from from glory to glory the light of the sun changes the seed from glory to whether you know it or not if you are ripening in the presence of the Sun the seed word that you are by the light of God's word is changing you hallelujah it's changing you oh we're talking about a little liberty we're talking about being changed you realize what if if you're if you're sitting under the revealed word of the hour the light of this day and you are that true word seed that has been spoken that under that light you right now are being changed from one Glory Hallelujah from Glory unto Glory I'm being changed yeah that's what I'm happy about that's what I'm excited about cuz I'm being changed I know what I was I know what I was doing I know what I was thinking I know how lost I was I know how much in darkness I was I know what I thought mattered in life but then something Came Upon me and changed me changed my thinking changed my attitude changed my dressed changed my nature but he wasn't done changing me Hallelujah he didn't just wash me up and cleanse me and give me the Holy Ghost say there you are son now I'm done with you but no the great tutor of the Holy Ghost he's walking with you he's teaching you he's training you he's leading you and guiding you in all truth and all righteousness that you might fulfill the word of the hour you know we're walking under a promise of of the hour that we're living in that Paul would say I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep Hallelujah I believe I'm looking at people that are that mystery I think you are the mystery of the change of our bodies and you're living under a prophetic word and as you walk you are being changed into his very image into his very likeness hallelujah oh my Hallelujah as the light of the sun changes the seed from glory to glory we also become more like him as we live in his presence like him being conformed to his blessed image as we walk with him watch what the sun does you plant a seed what happens the seed rots inside the seed is life the life comes forth and brings forth the stock now that don't look like the first there's Luther it was a stock all right the stock went on and the first thing you know it brought forth a tassel see that was the Westland Revival wasn't like the other then Along come the Pentecostal Revival see brought forth the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right but what happened we got we get fungus on the ear it begins to look wrong I think some of us might got fungus on the ear we become hard of hearing I know that's not what he's meaning but it sounds pretty good something's stopping it up are you hearing the word of the hour are you becoming the word something's wrong does it look like what was given to us help us Lord help us Lord does this look like Malachi 45 does this look like uh uh Luke 17:30 does this look like I'm talking about me now does it is what I'm manifesting and what I am believe does it look like how it was delivered does it look like what was restored what happens we get a fungus on there it begins to look wrong this thing that thing it don't look like the word it's not like the rest of it it's not like the original grain that went in but God is still there to make that just the same notice what does it do it finally returns back to the original seed again what did he say it shall come to pass in the last days saith God see here we are the light over the word as the light of the sun changes the seed from glory to glory the seed has come back to the original the same seed that went in the ground the same Son of God the same one that went in the ground has now come back in the fullness and full manifestation of the word in the hour that we're in and that is the so in light amen that's the sunlight am that you're sitting in that light and that light is bringing forth the seed changing you from Glory unto Glory the sun changing the seed which you are everybody believe you're at least a a seed of God and this message is God's light of the hour upon your life and by his spirit that is changing you into the very image of the word so we're living in the hour where the word has come back in its full strength and full power not a partial truth not a partial light but the fullness of the word is being waved over the people again and what is that that word doing it's proclaiming to you what you are supposed to be what you are going to be and the question is oh I I when he says does it look like the word is there's something wrong is there a fungus on the earth it's not looking like what was delivered I say oh God help me I I want to be that word that you have spoken right it's been Vindicated in its full strength and full power with signs and wonders following are we looking for it are we believing for it are we preaching it are we acting it are we talking it are we just satisfied yeah I'm good I'm bride hurry up preacher I gotta go you know I got to go study I got exams tomorrow you know I got to work I got to make a living it's good to be a message believer but you know I mean it's good to be be right cuz everybody else is wrong I mean why wouldn't I be a message believer cuz everybody else is wrong so at least I'm right and I can still live any kind of uh oh the letter kth but the spirit giveth life the spirit gives true Liberty may maybe somebody ask yourself is there something you want to quit doing is there something that's been drawing you away from the Lord is there something that you feel condemned about is there a relationship or something that you've entered into and you realize it just doesn't feel quite right and you are struggling to part ways with it that is not Liberty and if you're trying to handle it on your own you're living by the letter and the letter kth the letter will take you out of his presence the the letter will rob you of your joy it'll rob you of your Victory it will kill you it will put you in the grave but you got to come to a place where you say Lord I need the life life of the word I need Deliverance Lord I'm coming back to you I'm repenting for the things that I've done wrong I'm repenting for my relationships Lord there's something in my life it's the little foxes that spoil the vine I can't seem to ever have Victory I can't ever seem to have a prayer life I read my Bible I get nothing out of it I turn on the message I don't hear the voice I'm just the same as I always was we got to get to a place of desperation where we want the life of the word and we have true Liberty oh Lord help us Shake Yourself Liberty in the spirit yes it's a paradox be because we become a prisoner not my will Lord but thy will be done Paul would say in Romans 8:11 he says but it is the spirit of him but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you it'll make you alive it will make you live the word it will make you be the word The Same Spirit that is in you the same spirit that was in him now living in you not a portion of the word see justification uh we've moved on up the ladder sanctification we've moved on up the ladder outpouring of the gifts and and all of those things wonderful wonderful we want all of those things and all those things uhh we we we should have those and and want those and be accepted those and believing for but that not even that now we've moved up the ladder now we're in the fullness of the word just Jus ification made way for sanctification sanctification made way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the person the person of Jesus Christ himself the word that same Spirit Hallelujah we've had the Shea wave telling us what it looks like now that's Liberty to be able to walk in newness of life knowing what you are becoming knowing what you are being changed from this glory to that glory Lord that I'm walking in your presence and the Very seed word that I am is being changed by the message of the hour and by your spirit into the very image of the word that you projected or are we satisfied well we just might start preaching hard we we just might have have to start calling it all out we might just need to start calling out the sins the unconfessed sins of you Believers we going to keep playing church and living the way that we're living that ain't my position to come that hard so I'm not going to but think about the uncon the brother R said your unconfessed sin of you Believers will cause this church to bitterly fail and we got people that have been SI for years in our church and you keep uh messing around with the same Tommy rot over and over and over your unconfessed sin will cause this church to bitterly fail and you think your private time doesn't matter you think your relationship with them boys doesn't matter it matters you're going to take communion and come up before the house of God and testify that you got the Holy Ghost and live like that where are we at church are we just a large floating down oh you know I'll make it someday we we look church I want to be that church the prophet spoke of I want to be that Victorious Army where death and hell and the devil can't stand in my way I want to speak to the mountain and I want to see it move but we got to get in one mind and one Accord we got to get in desperation we got to ask oh God I thought I had the Holy Ghost well are you up and down and in and out are you going through besetting sins you do you you get delivered from pornography and you're back on it again 6 months later you need the Holy Ghost don't be discouraged just be like praise God that there's something more for I can be changed but we live in conditions we live in sin aen thought it wouldn't bother nobody the mighty Joshua our captain the Holy Ghost is leading us into battle I don't know why we're coming this way so hard maybe it's cuz we get out of of meetings and we feel like we're fine and we go right back to the same Tommy rot shame on us I just take a little this a little that watch a little this a little that he won't bother nobody it's what aen thought come on well that's what aen thought I just take a little W I'll just watch a few I'll just go to the theater a Believer going to the theater are you kidding me oh I know I know mat you're so old we don't have to go to the theater anymore we got the theater in our pocket you got Netflix are you kidding me you got movie apps and entertainment you're watching the newest show are you kidding me you're still trimming your hair or breaking it hair go down cut it back up hair go down cut it back up we Rejoice but praise God her hair's growing long oh man it's cut again yeah you're unconfessed sins I don't know why we're hitting it so hard but we need to hit it it's going home time I want to go in a Rapture if you don't have a revelation of cutting your pray for it you think you can clip it burn it break it it doesn't matter it matters it matters I wish I had some scissors and I would show you what trimming your hair or cutting your hair means Paul said if you just a little bit your might as well shave it all off so if you're going to clip it just show up bald please I have more respect for that I know it's coming hard but what I'm wanting to say is pray for Revelation let's not be playing Church let's realize that if we are testifying and if we are saying that we're message Believers we're taking communion we're confessing I got the Holy Ghost we're giving prayer to God and then in our private lives we're living contrary it affects the whole body but we want the same spirit in you the prophet of God said and we find here that out that God always had skin on him when Moses seen him he had skin on him look like a man when God was behind curtains he had skin on him and God tonight is in his church is veiled in his church with skin on it he is still the same God tonight and we find that he said but now as ever this skin Veil is what catches the Traditions they just can't believe that it is god making them people act like that see it's because God is veiled in his church in skin skin on it that's right he is hid from the unbeliever and revealed to the believer oh God I want to be you with skin on it that my talking and my walking and my acting it's his very life the same quickening power the quickening spirit living in me I'm not going to stop short of it I'll preach it just as hard because and I'm going to say it just as hard because I believe every word that was spoken by Malachi 4:5 and there's something in my heart it's been written on the tables of my heart that I will fulfill every word that has been spoken because greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and if that if I am a seed word of his then he has put the power of transformation into my life to become everything that he spoke and I don't want to stop short hey you open up a book you want to keep reading it he says and Jesus says As it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be at the coming of the son of man deity veiled again in human flesh now didn't didn't you remember Jesus say when the Son of God is being revealed and Luke the 17th chapter I believe about the 20 uh 21st verse somewhere along there he said and when the son of man is being revealed the son of man back in the church again revealed in human beings oh we've seen the sheath wave we we we've seen uh the Divine promise of scripture and the son of man being revealed but now what is being revealed is now wanting to be veiled in you back in the church again revealed in human beings not Son of God but the son of man again back in his church again in these last days all right so now we'll just break a little into our text here just speaking of Quicken Quicken means to cause to live everybody all right we feel okay forgive me for being harsh for preaching it straight but I I I I I heard a prophet a Vindicated Prophet preacher hard and preacher straight and a true son and daughter of God that's what you want Lord I'm I'm I'm slacking I know I'm sorry Amen to the word Lord I know you'll deliver me I know I'll get the victory Lord I realize I ain't living the way that I'm Living Lord something in me is crying it wants out I want Deliverance I want freedom Lord Lord let it be tonight oh God let your word fall on fertile ground tonight Lord I want to be different I want to be changed I want to be your Bing ground I want your Holy Spirit I want the Quicken I don't want to cut my hair I don't want to give in por I don't want to do all the Lord I want to be free I want your spirit to give me true Liberty for where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty oh God I need that Liberty in my life am that I could be living in your presence and just in a moment I can drop on my knees say oh God how I love you how I thank you for this message my sister so and so brother so and so they're having a hard time would you by your grace and your Holy Spirit go bind them up tonight Lord I wonder if they're struggling and they're weak in their body right now I know they've been struggling a long time with this infirmity but you are the god that Health all of our diseases Lord may I bear that burden a little more today oh God may they feel a refreshing of the Holy Ghost come upon them may they get up and give you glory Lord May their faith rise and take one more step to the healing of their body let God live through you be God to a sick and Dying World be God in this church somebody needs to be God in this place things ain't going right we got situations and problems I always say somebody got to be God we just want to fuss and fight and point and and pick Fork religion somebody gots to be God somebody got to have humility somebody got say Lord not my will be done but yours if it's possible for this cup to pass Lord but if it be so Lord according to Thy word God veiling himself in your skin quickening you to cause the Quicken means to cause to live to make alive give life spiritual power to to to arouse or invigorate to restore life to give increase of Life thus a physical life of spirit quickening as it respects the spirit endued with a new and greater power of life I like this portion of it says metaphorically of seeds quickened into life germinating springing up and growing Hallelujah that's what it is the quickening powers come upon the seed of of the word that you are and you're you're springing up and growing yes Lord I believe it I'm springing up I'm growing Lord I might I might not be what I see in your word but I sure ain't what I I used to be I've been quickened I'm springing up I'm growing the old things of the world they're falling by the wayside Lord I'm getting closer and closer into thy image now this is just the the my inspiration right here uh that we want to preach from for a little bit uh brother brandom says this in power of transformation he says now transforming he says I used to work for a Public Service Company where we had Transformers and to transform now the word is the word means in itself something like to transform means something that's been changed something that's changed from one thing to another changed from one thing to another Paul would say in 1 Corinthians 15:52 he say in a moment and a twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised in corruptible and we shall be changed transformed Hebrews because change means to transform Hebrews 11:5 says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God translated means changed so changed transformed translated quickened Enoch was quickened he was changed he was translated he was walking with God under the word for his hour for his day Walking with God and all of a sudden one day he took his last step on this side and God said look it's just time to come on home now whether you know it or not Enoch is your type brother brother brandom said something along lives it'll just be like a regular Rapture routine you'll just be walking along you say Lord I love you so much Lord I'm thinking of my brother over there he has an infirmity in his body and I pray that you would touch him and all of a sudden you're going to look at your hand and be like where did the wrinkles go that brother's just going to transport over like I thought you were thinking about me huh look at this huh you thought I could move then look at watch me now a new body prophet of God said Enoch walked with God whatever God said do Enoch never missed one word he walked with God what was he he was a Son of God he was an eagle that had been called to that day and when it come time he was so full of that quickening power remember he walked 500 years or more before God and not one time had he missed his word not one time did he misbehave himself not one time did he but kept the testimony everything that God told him to do he went and done it no argument about it makes me think of that quot and power transport quit quit arguing quit arguing about who you are and what you are and accept it he just went and done it no matter what anybody else thought he went and done it why he was full of that quickening power and when it come time for the old man to die God just sent down the ladder and he walked up home he was quick he quickened him and took his mortal body up in Rapture that's the quickening power quit trying to change yourself quit trying to live the message it's the power of God that quickens you to the message it's the power of God that quickens the word in your life quit trying to do it yourself quit trying to solve your own problems what does transform mean to change from one thing to another that's what the power of God does is it changes one thing to another I mean think about it what looked like a regular day at the office you is walking along and all sudden the quickening power the power of transformation changed him from one atmosphere to another transformed changed from one thing to another that's what I want I want the power of transformation in my life that can change one thing to another we need it we need the Holy Ghost we need the transforming power we need the spirit we don't need the letter we need the spirit to take the word and transform it in our lives it's the power to change things it's the power to change situations when something looked like it was ordinary I think of those uh that sister that was it was just another day getting the kids ready for school she was believing for a miracle she couldn't eat any food she couldn't uh keep it down her stomach was all upset she'd been sick for who knows how long she even went to the a church and was prayed for her and the prophet said she was going to be healed and she got back and she was testifying and her own family told her you're being a reproach maybe it's time you stop testifying about it just another ordinary day got the kids ready sent him out to school was looking out the window as the kids gone and maybe she was just uh humming a little hem there and and and she was just thinking about what her husband said and she was crying and say Lord you said I would be healed I believe you and and there she was a little hungry she she took a little rolled o there and started to eat on it a little bit she wasn't thinking usually I would tear up her stomach and she couldn't even keep it down but she got a little hungry so she had another one and and before you knew it she had eaten a whole bowl of oats and she realized I'm Healed she had went through that prayer line with a friend of hers down the street in the neighborhood so she ran all the down the street said I be to go tell Betsy what happened to me she got down to the door and all of a sudden she oh my goodness this screaming and this commotion going on she flung it open the door said what's wrong Betsy she said I can't find it the cancer gour is gone I can't find it what is it it's gone the prophet of God said what was it it was the angel of the Lord passing through the neighborhood to confirm his word with signs and wonders following it it was the power of transformation to change one thing to another sick to Ill I pray oh God May the angel of the Lord pass through my neighborhood oh God pass through my touch my family my family needs a touch oh God pass pass through this church tonight that the angel of the Lord would pass through here and change you from one thing Hallelujah to another the power of transformation I'm thankful for what God did for me in 1999 changed my life but praise God he didn't leave me like that oh my I thought I'd done done something and as high as I was soaring in the heavenlies I haven't even began to set my wings in soar I had been set free and oh what a glorious day that was that Victory Day when the power of transformation came into my life and changed me from a sinner to a Son of God filled with the Holy Ghost oh there was nothing ever like it but ever since then it's been a growing it's been a learning it's been a transform for ING as I'm walking in Theo in light of God's word it's constantly changing that seed word in the very image of Christ and there got to be something inside of you hungering for that there has to be something in you hungering and thirsting for that I'm talking about the power of transformation changing you from one thing to another that's what some of us need here to maybe that's the simplest thought I can I can say that where we're at tonight is somebody here needs the power of transformation to change you from one thing to another we've we've we've we've been going too long living one way without having totally V total victory in our lives it's it's it's going home time I believe every single one of us should be hungering and thirsting for total Deliverance complete and total Deliverance in our lives that we could be changed from our situation from our bondage for the things that we're living in that's what happened to the woman at the well Christ showed up on the scene and and an impossible situation was changed from one thing to another oh we could think of story after story of the quickening power Lazarus was dead he didn't have a thought coming he was gone he was off in another atmosphere another realm but the quickening power Lazarus come forth I pray we could build your faith that we could see the same thing in our church in our young people in our lives and in your private life in your family in your home that the power of transformation will get a hold of you and change you change your attitude change your hunger for the word change the way you dress change the way you act change the way you feed change the way you eat change the way you hunger for this word change you from a Critic to an encourager said I've always critiquing and criticizing the preacher why' you amen the preacher maybe he's learning maybe he's growing maybe it's never attained to the amount of knowledge and growth that you have and all your amening that you ever do is to let everybody else know you already knew that how you hear it all the time yep but if we can get into one mind and one Accord then we'll be in tune for regular Rapture routine well we are that Mighty Church we're we're all in one mind and Accord where it might be just another regular day I love the story of John Ryan man it was just another haircut it was just another beard trim he sat down there no telling no telling old blind John Ryan was sitting there and the barber said hold on y'all listen he's going to say it all again I told you this is oh is that him is that the guy you're talking about every time he comes in here every time he testifies to me that he can see watch it's just going to be the same as it always was he's going to come in here and say that he can see a and it's just the funniest thing you ever did here but what happened that time just seemed like another regular day but then the quickening power came changed the situation from one I once was blind Hallelujah but now I can see if you've ever been blind and your eyes have ever been opened if you've ever been in prison if you've ever been in bondage and you've ever been set free now I'm talking about Liberty Hallelujah being changed from one thing to another that's the quickening power we could go just thinking of stories I think I think of uh uh gyrus daughter think think of the story of gyrus he had finally got to Jesus his 12-year-old daughter was laying there dying I think it's kind of an interesting story because here he finally gets to the feet of Jesus and somebody else butts in line right he finally gets to Jes Jesus and here comes the S phenician woman she had a neede too I I I can't imagine here he is he waits he watched this this unfold and and and she come down there and touched the him of was garbage you know the story I perceive virtue has gone from me and she was healed and now it comes to his turn and it finally comes to his turn for his audience with the master and and his servant comes says gyus trouble not the master she's dead she's gone I I can't imagine how overwhelming the news to the gyrus was in that moment as gyrus heard that come forth and say your daughter's dead trouble him not but you know what's neat about that story is gyrus wasn't the only one that heard that yeah the scripture says and Jesus heard it you ain't the only one that heard your doctor report you ain't the only one that heard the confusion in your family you ain't the only one that heard everything that's been going on against you you ain't the only one that heard all the reports and telling you your sickness and your condition and everything that you've been B somebody else heard that too and Jesus heard it he said fear not only believe Hallelujah and Christ changed it from what would have been a funeral Glory am what would have been a a Mourning what would have been a a heartache he changed it from one thing to another fear not believe only and she shall be made whole well what about you well we'll just end quickly I'll ask the musicians to come we won't keep you too much longer maybe you feel hopeless maybe you feel like you've tried maybe you feel like you've prayed well yeah with men it's impossible with men and with doctors some things are impossible but my Bible tells me with men it's impossible but with God With God all things are possible God can change your situation from one thing to another he can change a life to where you're struggling to live a Sanctified life where you're struggling with certain things that you know you shouldn't be doing and the power of transformation the quickening of power of God can come to you right now where you're sitting and change you forever change you from one thing into another That's The Power of transformation when John was standing there he said oh I indeed baptize you with water but there's one coming I I'm not even worthy to to loose his shoes but when he comes he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire that's the fire I want fire that changes things fire fire fire just has an ability to take something whatever structure it was whatever form it was and just totally annihilate

Living Word to the people and today the people that are veiled are the same thing they are written Epistles read of all men not a new epistle but the epistle that's been written made manifest it's those who believe the word and the promise of this day that God is pouring out his Spirit upon All Flesh and that is written Epistles and when a person tries to carnally impersonate impersonate that it backfires your life shows what you are Paul said put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ to make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof now before we let you go I want you to allow that word to settle in your heart that you are to be the word veiled just like Moses was you are to be the word veiled just like Malachi 4:5 was you are to be the word veiled written Epistles read of all men the word made manifest for those who believe the word and the promise of this day it's God pouring out his spirit is that's what's happening in your life it'd be okay for you to say you know what Lord I don't see that the question is is do you want it it's not enough just to say Amen it's not enough oh brother Matthew I got quote after quote after quote well okay do you have the life the Devils believe fear and tremble I think I want to say that Lord give me a hunger and [Music] thirst to when I amen these things I see laying in your word to start to have a hunger and thirst for them to be manifested in my life that the Lord would pour out his spirit in my life and make me a written epistle and to know Lord when I try to do it on my own it backfires it's because I make provision for the flesh everything in in Satan's Eden is trying to make provision for your flesh your job civilization education science and all those things it's all just trying to make a provision for your flesh but God has sent a message to make provision that could bring you into his presence before we let you go I just pray that you just ask God to pour a spirit out in your life not talking about some outside anointing I'm talking about the quickening power of God to pour into your life and make this word a reality oh you are worthy of it [Music] all oh you are worthy of it all [Music] oh you deserve the Glory Hallelujah oh you are worthy of it all yes you are Lord Jesus oh you are worthy of it all [Music] you are all are all things you deserve the glory and all the saints and angels

The God Who changes what looks impossible makes it possible you gave Abraham a promise and what looked impossible Lord you also gave him a faith to go with the promise that he staggered not and was strong in faith giving you glory Lord I want to stand with this congregation tonight and start to give you glory because you've given us a faith to believe all things and though it looks impossible you open up the barren wombs Lord you restore the broken marriages you give quickening power to those who are dead in trespasses and sins you take a broken marriage in a broken home and you restore

with me with me it's all possible oh believe Lord that's our declaration tonight Lord and it's not even with our own faith it's with the faith that you gave us Lord so now we take that faith we say Amen Lord change the situation or change that body that's been sick for years Lord and by the power power of transformation would you go right now Lord and raise faith into another realm to reach out and pull that power of your virtue into that very body and drive every sickness from it because you're a God that changes the impossible and makes it possible Lord we don't want to leave here the same Lord you told us we couldn't we'd either leave better or worse maybe somewhere someone here under my voice has been a little resenting towards the word Lord maybe that's my fault I I I I I I pray for [Music] forgiveness May a ray of sunshine just break through that darkness and shine upon that seed and something would say amen and be quickened and made whole to know Lord that these things aren't said to bring judgment it's said to bring freedom and liberty and newness of life because you've called us not to walk among the things of this world you've called us to walk in Heavenly places in
