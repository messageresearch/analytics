[33:33] we thank you for
[33:34] being able to
[33:36] be out here today to be in your presence
[33:38] lord and
[33:40] while there's a grave need lord jesus
[33:42] that we've heard father
[33:44] a man by the name of salazar lord and
[33:47] father according to science according to
[33:50] this realm and the extent of the
[33:53] laws of
[33:55] this realm father they've given up on
[33:57] him lord
[33:59] father we just
[34:01] pray lord jesus that you could
[34:03] that you would come on the scene father
[34:05] on his behalf and

[34:35] ask you to bless the tithes and

[34:40] father
[34:41] just thinking this morning
[34:43] father about
[34:44] [Music]
[34:46] lord the great storehouse father that
[34:48] you are you're a fountain father of
[34:51] of all things
[34:53] the riches we're told of christ jesus
[34:56] father
[34:58] lord when we come into your presence
[34:59] lord we
[35:01] often don't have the
[35:03] highest expectation that we should have
[35:05] lord to think of it like we've
[35:08] inherited a department store as our
[35:10] messenger told us and
[35:13] he said if i had inherited a department
[35:16] store i'd certainly want to go in there
[35:17] and see everything that belonged to me
[35:19] lord and i pray father that you'd lift
[35:22] our expectations father that we could
[35:25] ask for big things and have faith to
[35:27] believe for big things lord and not just
[35:30] walk out with some little thing oh he
[35:32] spoke to me about this or he talked
[35:35] about a sermon that i was reading the
[35:37] other day but oh god may we
[35:40] father
[35:41] believe you for
[35:43] bigger things than that lord
[35:46] help us to leave here with a
[35:48] a greater presence of you in our life
[35:50] that we may have an atmosphere a father
[35:53] about us by
[35:54] thinking on these things and
[35:57] keeping you in the center of our
[36:00] [Music]
[36:01] being father that
[36:03] what we're looking at may emanate out
[36:05] from us father and we could have an
[36:06] atmosphere that can change situations
[36:09] and
[36:10] even in circumstances that don't go our
[36:12] way father we can
[36:15] have a
[36:16] anchor in our heart that says
[36:18] though these things are going this way
[36:20] it's well with my soul
[36:22] because i'm more than a conqueror
[36:24] through you lord mother we just ask you
[36:27] to bless the remainder of the service
[36:28] bless the man of god lord jesus may you
[36:31] father reach his hand into that golden
[36:33] bowl of man and father and pull out just
[36:36] the thing father that we need to hear
[36:38] tonight and help him to deliver it
[36:40] father in your spirit and the power and
[36:42] demonstration of it and give us hearts
[36:44] to receive we ask in jesus name amen

[50:05] matter we don't need to pray about this
[50:09] oh my
[50:11] if it be so
[50:13] our god whom we serve is able to deliver
[50:16] us from the burning fiery furnace
[50:18] and he will deliver us out of thy hand o
[50:22] king
[50:23] but if not
[50:24] be it known unto thee o king
[50:28] that we will not serve thy gods nor
[50:31] worship the golden image which thou
[50:34] has set up
[50:35] amen god bless you you can be seated
[50:37] this evening
[50:39] if i could for a few moments of your
[50:41] time
[50:43] just send you on your way with some
[50:45] encouragement tonight
[50:47] i
[50:48] this thought is entitled a challenge to
[50:51] the king
[50:53] a challenge to the king so a word the
[50:55] word challenge simply just means to call
[50:58] out
[50:59] to duel or combat
[51:02] now i want us to understand this more
[51:04] this evening for a few moments that it
[51:06] was not the three boys the three hebrew
[51:09] children that were challenged
[51:11] it was god
[51:13] they had nothing to do but trust in him
[51:15] tonight i want you to know that you are
[51:17] not the ones being challenged satan
[51:19] wants to think that it's all on you
[51:21] it's all your decision but if you are
[51:24] called of god the challenge is to god
[51:26] because he's the one that is calling you
[51:29] so again it had nothing to do with them
[51:31] it had everything to do with faith in
[51:33] god
[51:34] now listen to what brother branham says
[51:36] here it says and it became
[51:38] them
[51:39] to do their duty and to leave the event
[51:43] with god
[51:47] they had no need to go into an extended
[51:49] vindication of their conduct
[51:52] for it might be presumed that their
[51:53] principles of conduct were well known
[51:56] so i want you to know it it was up to
[51:58] god and not to them it didn't matter the
[52:00] outcome what mattered was it was up to
[52:03] god and they had to rest in that so when
[52:06] you face your trials this week when you
[52:08] face your life this week when you face
[52:10] whatever it is i want you to know that
[52:12] it's not up to you it's up to god
[52:14] because if you keep putting it all on
[52:16] yourself
[52:17] that you have to do this you have to
[52:19] make you have to make these decisions no
[52:21] you simply have to have faith in god
[52:24] we sing the song have faith in god
[52:27] what's the point of singing having faith
[52:29] in god when you're trying to do it
[52:30] yourself when you're trying to make
[52:32] sense of it all
[52:34] listen the three of your children said
[52:36] we're not gonna we're not gonna think
[52:37] about this we're not gonna have a
[52:39] conversation amongst ourselves and if
[52:42] you were to really look back they really
[52:43] had no self-help book they didn't have
[52:46] no answer they didn't have something to
[52:47] look back to like you and i have today
[52:50] we can point back to the word of god and
[52:52] we are surrounded by such a great of
[52:53] cloud of witnesses they didn't have that
[52:56] they just trusted in god that whether it
[52:59] was whether it's to the fiery furnace or
[53:02] whether he was going to take him out of
[53:03] it didn't matter it was all up to god
[53:05] what was about to happen and that the
[53:07] king did not have control
[53:09] so i want you to understand that as i
[53:11] continue with this commentary said which
[53:13] is indicated by the passage is that
[53:15] their minds were made up that their
[53:18] principles were settled and well
[53:20] understood that they had come to the
[53:22] deliberate determination
[53:27] deliberate determination as a matter of
[53:30] conscience not to yield
[53:32] obedience to the command that the result
[53:35] could not be modified by any statement
[53:37] which they can make or by any argument
[53:40] listen to this in the case you see satan
[53:42] loves to get in an argument with you
[53:45] see you were not built to argue with
[53:46] satan jesus didn't argue with satan
[53:50] he just said it is written
[53:53] that was not an argument
[53:55] are we met we're not you are as a
[53:57] believer you are not built to argue with
[53:59] the enemy you simply speak to the speak
[54:02] the word of god to that enemy so it
[54:05] doesn't didn't matter the outcome they
[54:07] knew that god was in control and they
[54:09] were not anxious about the result
[54:12] we are nothing but a bunch if we're not
[54:13] careful anxious americans
[54:16] anxious worldlines
[54:19] anxious about what's gonna happen next
[54:22] no it doesn't matter what's going to
[54:23] happen lord the challenge is not up to
[54:26] me the word has been challenged and the
[54:29] word will always stand the challenge
[54:32] look at the great passage it was read by
[54:34] your pastor this morning with the
[54:36] with the blessing of the child the lord
[54:38] is my shepherd
[54:40] i shall not walk i shall not lack
[54:43] there's nothing that i'm gonna lack now
[54:45] now listen to this great truth now give
[54:47] me 10 million dollars
[54:50] 10 million sounds like a lot of money
[54:52] but one reversal of fortune it'll
[54:54] scatter it
[54:57] but give me a spiritual hold on the
[54:59] divine assurance that the lord is my
[55:02] shepherd
[55:03] i shall not want
[55:05] i am set for life
[55:08] i cannot go broke
[55:11] with the with that stock in my hand
[55:14] i can never be bankrupt
[55:16] with that security
[55:18] you can climb the stairs of your old
[55:20] creaky house you can go and lay up and
[55:23] on the old bed and you can cover
[55:25] yourself in the cold of the night with
[55:27] the breeze blowing through the cracks of
[55:29] the house and you can look up to the
[55:31] stars in the holes in the roof and you
[55:34] can have confidence that god is in
[55:36] control why because you're not lacking
[55:39] you are a believer it it doesn't matter
[55:42] about the natural things the lord is
[55:44] your shepherd
[55:46] oh my you will sleep peacefully
[55:50] why do we stay up
[55:52] why don't we why are we turned is
[55:54] because of the things and cares of life
[55:56] but i want you to know the challenges to
[55:58] the king and the king has called you
[56:01] oh my so it's not for you to worry about
[56:04] if you were called when satan comes
[56:07] against you he's not coming against you
[56:09] he's coming against the calling and you
[56:11] don't have to worry about it god is
[56:13] already going to get you through
[56:15] think about this in daniel 6 16.
[56:19] as we go to hear verse 16 then the king
[56:21] commanded and they brought daniel and
[56:23] cast him into the den of lions now the
[56:26] king spake and said unto daniel thy god
[56:28] whom now serviced continually he will
[56:30] deliver thee i like it how the
[56:32] unbeliever said that
[56:35] come on believers
[56:37] and a stone was brought up and laid upon
[56:40] the mouth of the of the den and the king
[56:42] filled it with his own signature and
[56:44] with the signature of his lords that the
[56:46] purpose night might not be changed
[56:47] concerning daniel then the king went
[56:50] into his palace and passed the night
[56:52] fasting
[56:53] neither were instruments of music
[56:54] brought before him and his sleep went
[56:57] from him
[56:59] you see he wasn't a believer
[57:02] so he was worried he didn't know the
[57:04] calling
[57:06] i want that to sink in now
[57:08] no you say well that's great he was
[57:10] doing those things he was doing this no
[57:11] he didn't know that he didn't have con
[57:13] you say well here before brother jeremy
[57:15] verse 16 he said he knew he could
[57:16] deliver him well if he really meant that
[57:19] why was he not sleeping that night why
[57:22] was he stressed out
[57:25] well let's let's look at the story i
[57:26] mean he wasn't the one in the dean of
[57:28] the lions
[57:30] oh my then the king arose very early in
[57:32] the morning and went into haste in the
[57:33] den of lions and when he came to the den
[57:35] he cried with a lamentable voice
[57:38] unto daniel and the king spake and said
[57:41] to daniel oh daniel servant of the
[57:42] living god
[57:44] is thy god
[57:46] oh my
[57:48] whom thou serve us continually able to
[57:51] deliver thee from the lions
[57:55] then said daniel there's the answer
[57:58] unto the king o king live forever my god
[58:01] hath sent his angel and has shut the
[58:02] lion's mouths that they have not hurt me
[58:05] for as much as before him innocency was
[58:08] found in me and also before the o king
[58:10] have i done no
[58:12] hurt again the challenge was made
[58:14] against the prophet of god and this time
[58:17] in the manner that even the heathen said
[58:19] i know you'll be delivered now the
[58:21] heathen said he would be delivered but
[58:23] yet he worried and he fretted and he
[58:25] wandered all night and then the next day
[58:27] when he went and talked to daniel he
[58:29] cried out with a a
[58:31] lamentable voice
[58:33] he had no confidence
[58:35] and he wasn't even in the den of lions
[58:38] brothers and scissors i want you to know
[58:40] that even in the den of lions you are in
[58:43] complete control god is in complete
[58:45] control of your life look at what
[58:47] brother branham said in looking at the
[58:48] unseen he said joshua looked at the
[58:50] unseen and walked around the walls
[58:53] believing it would happen it all depends
[58:56] on what you're looking at
[58:58] our brother mentioned tonight about
[59:00] expectations
[59:02] you see what did we come expecting what
[59:04] were we looking at they were looking
[59:06] from the walls down at the israelites
[59:09] they were looking at them as nothing i
[59:11] perhaps some of the israelites were
[59:12] looking at the walls wondering what god
[59:14] could do but still they obeyed the word
[59:17] of the lord sometimes you know you don't
[59:19] have a scientific answer of how that
[59:21] wall is going to fall down but if god
[59:24] said keep walking around and you keep
[59:26] walking around that mountain you keep
[59:28] trusting in the lord i don't know how
[59:30] it's going to happen i don't know when
[59:32] he's going to show up all i know is that
[59:35] he told me this was the truth all i know
[59:37] is that he said keep doing this so i'm
[59:39] going to keep walking around these walls
[59:42] they can make fun of me they can call me
[59:44] names that all of these things can
[59:46] happen but somehow
[59:49] how do you know why because he brought
[59:51] me through this he brought me through
[59:53] that has he ever brought you through the
[59:54] jericho walls no but i know that he has
[59:57] never let me down once and so no matter
[1:00:00] what circumstance as we get back to that
[1:00:02] again from this morning no matter what
[1:00:04] it is if god has called you to it he is
[1:00:07] faithful to see you through it but you
[1:00:09] gotta and so it was the unseen that he
[1:00:11] was looking at oh i'm going to keep
[1:00:13] reading he said when they told daniel
[1:00:15] the lions then ready for you daniel
[1:00:17] looking at the unseen node that there
[1:00:20] was an angel of fire
[1:00:22] who stood between him and the lions
[1:00:25] that same pillar of fire that led the
[1:00:28] children of israel later
[1:00:30] for remembering animals afraid of fire
[1:00:33] when that pillar of fire stood between
[1:00:35] daniel and the lions the lions went off
[1:00:37] and meowed like kittens
[1:00:39] and laid down
[1:00:41] by faith the unseen daniel wasn't afraid
[1:00:45] of the lion think about the thoughts
[1:00:47] that god has for you the thoughts that
[1:00:49] the enemy has for you and what do you
[1:00:51] choose to listen to tonight
[1:00:53] jeremiah 29 11 for i know the thoughts
[1:00:56] that i think towards you say the lord
[1:00:58] thoughts of peace
[1:01:00] and not of evil to give you here it is
[1:01:03] you know this matters more than anything
[1:01:04] else
[1:01:05] an expected end
[1:01:08] god didn't wake up in the morning i'm
[1:01:10] surprised
[1:01:11] can i he's the one that said this
[1:01:13] morning i'm surprised at this hippie
[1:01:16] he didn't do that
[1:01:18] he knew his calling
[1:01:21] he knew his calling and he has an
[1:01:24] expected end
[1:01:26] brothers and sisters if you can stand in
[1:01:28] that peace and in that confidence that
[1:01:30] you he has an expected end for you
[1:01:33] there's nothing that satan can do then
[1:01:35] shall you call upon me and ye shall go
[1:01:37] and pray unto me and i will hearken unto
[1:01:39] you and you shall seek me and find me
[1:01:41] when you shall search for me with all
[1:01:44] your heart
[1:01:45] you know not just when things are going
[1:01:47] wrong but every day of your life you're
[1:01:49] searching you're giving everything to
[1:01:51] him
[1:01:52] and you know how many times have you
[1:01:54] been told that you cannot do it
[1:01:57] you know you ever you know a young
[1:01:58] person maybe none of you are this way
[1:02:00] but you know once some young person is
[1:02:01] told they can't do it they're like
[1:02:03] challenge accepted
[1:02:06] i can't hit 250 you watch i'm gonna hit
[1:02:08] 250 yards
[1:02:10] oh that's a golf phrase sorry i'm gonna
[1:02:11] hit 300 no
[1:02:13] they what do they do they're challenged
[1:02:15] there's a mentality inside of in a sense
[1:02:18] of the human nature to accept the
[1:02:20] challenge but i want you to know you
[1:02:22] don't have to accept a challenge no god
[1:02:26] it's he that is being challenged when
[1:02:28] satan comes and says you're going down
[1:02:30] he's not challenging you
[1:02:33] he's challenging god
[1:02:36] as brother branham says and why he says
[1:02:38] i solemnly believe with all of my heart
[1:02:40] that christ will heal every person
[1:02:42] that wears those handkerchiefs there's
[1:02:43] no doubt in my heart i do not doubt god
[1:02:46] said it so why could i stand here and
[1:02:48] challenge in africa half a million
[1:02:50] people or india rather in africa
[1:02:52] thousands times thousands of witch
[1:02:54] doctors and all kinds of superstitions
[1:02:56] come forth and prove your god don't you
[1:02:58] be afraid jesus is still jesus god is
[1:03:01] still god there's not enough devils in
[1:03:03] torment that can challenge his word
[1:03:07] and nothing can withstand when
[1:03:09] unadulterated faith rests upon listen
[1:03:12] what he says any promise god gives
[1:03:16] it's the truth it'll stand through every
[1:03:19] fiery trial so you have to come right
[1:03:23] back to the very word of god you cannot
[1:03:25] come back to a church theology you
[1:03:28] cannot come back to a denominational
[1:03:29] idea or a non-denominational idea it's
[1:03:32] got to fall back upon the word of god
[1:03:35] and there is not a devil in hell that
[1:03:37] can stand against it
[1:03:39] you've got to let that you think about
[1:03:40] david what david had
[1:03:42] enough david had enough one day first
[1:03:45] samuel 17 26 and david spake to the men
[1:03:48] that stood by him saying what shall be
[1:03:50] done to the man that killeth this
[1:03:52] philistine and taketh away the reproach
[1:03:56] from israel for who is this
[1:04:00] uncircumcised philistine
[1:04:02] that he should defy
[1:04:04] the armies of the living god that word
[1:04:06] defy is to taunt and to blaspheme
[1:04:09] he had enough
[1:04:11] david had enough that the word of god
[1:04:13] kept being challenged and so god used a
[1:04:16] little ruddy fella
[1:04:18] that no one cared for everyone left for
[1:04:20] what are you doing here you don't belong
[1:04:22] here you little ruddy guy get back on
[1:04:24] the other side get over there where
[1:04:27] where the sheep barely care for you
[1:04:30] no no god called a little ruddy guy that
[1:04:32] had an anointing in his life
[1:04:35] that everybody else had forgot no one
[1:04:37] else could see what about the anointing
[1:04:39] in your life tonight
[1:04:42] you say well i've been told this and
[1:04:44] i've been told i don't care what you've
[1:04:45] been told by the world i don't care what
[1:04:47] religion has told you what has god told
[1:04:50] you it is not you that are being
[1:04:52] challenged you don't have to prove
[1:04:54] nothing
[1:04:55] that's what this whole thing has been
[1:04:57] about the last 10 or 20 or so many years
[1:05:00] is to prove the message
[1:05:02] no it proves itself it vindicates itself
[1:05:06] by bringing itself to pass and you are
[1:05:08] the vindication you don't have to prove
[1:05:10] it yourself
[1:05:11] oh my they said you can't prove divine
[1:05:14] healing and no such thing as that and
[1:05:17] and all like this said the opposition is
[1:05:19] too great and things like that but who
[1:05:22] is that uncircumcised philistine who
[1:05:24] will challenge the word of god that's
[1:05:26] right who is he
[1:05:28] who is this devil who is this doubt who
[1:05:31] is this fear come on whatever it is in
[1:05:33] your life this thing that's trying to
[1:05:35] challenge the word of god
[1:05:37] oh you see what it is sometimes you
[1:05:39] think you're being challenged to see if
[1:05:41] you're really a believer or not
[1:05:43] and and sometimes it begins to bring
[1:05:45] doubt inside of us yes you're going to
[1:05:47] be tested you're going to be tried i get
[1:05:48] that
[1:05:49] but i want you to know that it's not
[1:05:51] heaped upon you to handle yourself
[1:05:54] a minister can't do it himself a pastor
[1:05:57] cannot do it himself william branham
[1:05:59] could not do it himself it had to have
[1:06:01] the word of god that power within sight
[1:06:04] of him and you you've got to have that
[1:06:06] word other than that you're going to
[1:06:07] keep trying to prove that you're going
[1:06:09] to be different
[1:06:11] you can't do it on your own
[1:06:14] there is so much of god
[1:06:17] release to us in this day if we could
[1:06:19] just tap into it
[1:06:21] if he is the same
[1:06:23] then it's time for us to to look at that
[1:06:25] word and say lord if you are the same
[1:06:28] then i'm going to claim this word
[1:06:30] i'm going to claim as we heard again
[1:06:32] tonight everything in this store i'm
[1:06:34] going to claim every promise i it's not
[1:06:37] just every promise in the book is mine
[1:06:38] and again leaving it to a song but it is
[1:06:41] mine
[1:06:42] the word of god is mine freedom is mine
[1:06:45] if the son has set you free you are free
[1:06:48] indeed that means that yes even though
[1:06:50] you're going to have those temptations
[1:06:52] and they're going to come your way you
[1:06:53] have an anointing and a power to be able
[1:06:56] to rebuke him
[1:06:57] what did jesus tell his disciples he
[1:06:59] said pray that ye enter not into
[1:07:01] temptation
[1:07:03] notice he said enter
[1:07:06] you see that that didn't mean that
[1:07:07] temptation was not going to come their
[1:07:09] way
[1:07:10] i want you to know that because you're
[1:07:11] still here you're still going to have
[1:07:13] temptation
[1:07:14] but jesus said don't enter into it
[1:07:17] temptation's going to let's let's just
[1:07:19] throw this out there fear will come your
[1:07:21] way
[1:07:23] but then you have the choice whether to
[1:07:25] trust the word of god and not allow
[1:07:26] yourself to enter into that fear
[1:07:28] so just because fear comes doesn't mean
[1:07:31] you've entered into it you just speak to
[1:07:33] that mountain and be thou removed just
[1:07:36] because doubt may come or or question or
[1:07:38] whatever it may be may come doesn't mean
[1:07:40] that you have stepped into it no that is
[1:07:43] time to speak to that thing but do not
[1:07:46] enter
[1:07:48] into it don't allow yourself to be
[1:07:50] overcome by those temptations
[1:07:52] because you're still going to go through
[1:07:54] them as long as you're in this life
[1:07:56] you're still going to be tempted you're
[1:07:58] still going to be tried
[1:08:00] but you're an overcomer
[1:08:02] how many is overcomers tonight
[1:08:04] hallelujah
[1:08:06] amen i'm not going to hold you along so
[1:08:07] just bear with us
[1:08:09] i know it's sunday night but hallelujah
[1:08:10] anyhow
[1:08:12] someone said the other day a minister
[1:08:14] talked to me and said oh it's such a
[1:08:15] blessing brother branham oh i've seen
[1:08:17] the most patient people laying in
[1:08:19] wheelchairs and said god wants them to
[1:08:21] be sick
[1:08:23] he lets them be sick so he can show his
[1:08:26] blessings i said then if that's the
[1:08:28] truth
[1:08:29] then jesus christ defeated the very
[1:08:31] purpose of god
[1:08:33] when he come to earth he healed everyone
[1:08:36] he come in contact with him like i do
[1:08:38] right oh brother that's too thin
[1:08:42] see it just don't work you just might as
[1:08:44] well face the fact that you don't
[1:08:46] believe the bible and just say so and
[1:08:48] that's all because
[1:08:50] or either afraid to step out and
[1:08:52] challenge god
[1:08:54] to his promise like elijah did
[1:08:56] you say oh i'm afraid to challenge no if
[1:08:58] there's something inside of you and you
[1:09:01] know that healing is there for you you
[1:09:03] know that deliverance is there for you
[1:09:06] when you step out and speak it you are
[1:09:08] not just challenging yourself you are
[1:09:10] pointing right back to the word of god
[1:09:15] oh my
[1:09:17] aren't you glad that we have an
[1:09:18] anointing we have a power today
[1:09:21] oh my first kings 18 36-39 and it came
[1:09:25] to pass at the time of the offering of
[1:09:27] the evening sacrifice that elijah the
[1:09:29] prophet came near and said the lord god
[1:09:32] of abraham isaac and of israel let it be
[1:09:34] known this day that thou
[1:09:37] art the god in israel
[1:09:40] and that i am my servant and that i have
[1:09:42] done all these things
[1:09:44] at thy
[1:09:46] word you see as soon as you leave this
[1:09:49] word
[1:09:51] you have no
[1:09:52] no foundation to challenge god
[1:09:56] he said i've done this at thy word
[1:09:59] hear me o lord verse 37
[1:10:02] hear me that this people may know
[1:10:05] that thou art the lord god and that thou
[1:10:07] hast turned their back again
[1:10:10] then the fire of the lord fell and
[1:10:12] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:10:14] wood and the stones and the dust and
[1:10:16] licked up the water that was in the
[1:10:18] trench boy when god does something he
[1:10:19] does it right
[1:10:20] listen when he gives you his all when he
[1:10:23] give when he saves you he fills you with
[1:10:24] the holy ghost it's not haphazard it's
[1:10:27] not just all maybe a little bit today no
[1:10:29] he wants to pour himself upon you
[1:10:32] when he does it he does it right
[1:10:35] and when all the people saw it they fell
[1:10:37] on their faces and they said the lord he
[1:10:40] is the god
[1:10:41] the lord he is the god you see what is
[1:10:43] the point of this what is the point of
[1:10:45] ministries the point of ministries is
[1:10:47] not to point back to the minister the
[1:10:49] point of churches is not to point back
[1:10:51] to the church the point of a prophet is
[1:10:53] not to point back to a prophet but
[1:10:55] everything is to point to christ when
[1:10:58] you look at william branham he's
[1:10:59] pointing us to christ when you look at
[1:11:01] your pastor he's pointing to christ when
[1:11:04] you look at worship we're pointing back
[1:11:06] to christ everything has to go back to
[1:11:09] him as soon as we start absorbing
[1:11:11] worship
[1:11:15] we're right we're absolutely in the
[1:11:18] wrong i didn't even have to finish that
[1:11:19] sentence you already knew the answer
[1:11:21] why because you're seasoned you
[1:11:23] understand that so we cannot
[1:11:25] it's not about me
[1:11:28] how many knows that old song coming back
[1:11:30] to the heart of worship
[1:11:32] it's all about you lord it's all about
[1:11:35] you
[1:11:36] see this is not a disrespectful
[1:11:38] challenge this is not a challenge that
[1:11:40] is to better our carnal self we we're
[1:11:43] not here to challenge the word of god so
[1:11:45] we can out quote each other
[1:11:47] outlive each other bless god i'm a
[1:11:49] better message person than you no you've
[1:11:51] done messed up

[1:11:55] challenging that word why because i know
[1:11:58] that by your stripes i'm healed i know
[1:12:00] that i have been set free i know that
[1:12:03] i'm not that old person anymore every
[1:12:05] now and then that old self tries to rise
[1:12:07] up but again that inner holy spirit that
[1:12:09] anointing pushes it right back down
[1:12:12] where it belongs

[1:15:52] but while they were hiding in the
[1:15:54] shadows and afraid and in fear

[1:17:01] no matter what it is to you this evening
[1:17:03] o king of this world you have no power
[1:17:06] over this church you have no power over
[1:17:09] our minds you know how you have no
[1:17:11] authority over us
[1:17:13] oh my this for psalms 24 6 this is the
[1:17:17] generation of them that seek him that
[1:17:18] seek thy face o jacob lift up your heads
[1:17:21] all ye gates and be lift up your
[1:17:23] everlasting doors and the king of glory
[1:17:25] shall come in who is this king of glory
[1:17:29] the lord strong and mighty the lord
[1:17:32] mighty in battle have you forgotten
[1:17:35] church who's on your side
[1:17:37] have you forgotten who has called you
[1:17:39] walk out of them doors tonight with your
[1:17:42] spiritual head held high that no matter
[1:17:44] what satan throws you away he's not
[1:17:46] challenging you he's challenging the
[1:17:49] king that has called you
[1:17:50] and god's in control
[1:17:54] don't but he think it i want you to tell
[1:17:56] you can't lose sight of your king
[1:18:02] there is a touching
[1:18:04] i was reading this the other day and it
[1:18:06] just kind of really blessed me so maybe
[1:18:08] it'll bless you
[1:18:10] and perhaps
[1:18:11] our brother knows it because of
[1:18:14] where he comes from or whatever he said
[1:18:16] he came from
[1:18:17] you'll figure it out
[1:18:22] irish is that what it was
[1:18:23] thank you
[1:18:24] i almost said the wrong one i probably
[1:18:26] would have been thrown out
[1:18:29] there is a touching fact related in the
[1:18:31] history of a highland chief of the noble
[1:18:33] house of mcgregor
[1:18:35] who fell wounded by two balls at the
[1:18:37] battle of the pres uh preston pens
[1:18:40] seeing that seeing their chief fall
[1:18:43] the clan wavered
[1:18:45] and gave the enemy advantage
[1:18:48] the old chieftain beholding the effects
[1:18:50] of his disaster
[1:18:52] raised himself up on his elbows
[1:18:55] while the blood gushed in streams from
[1:18:57] his wounds
[1:18:59] and cried aloud i am not dead my
[1:19:01] children
[1:19:02] i am looking at you to see you do your
[1:19:05] duty
[1:19:06] these words revived the sinking courage
[1:19:09] of his brave highlanders
[1:19:11] there was a charm in the fact that they
[1:19:13] still fought under the eye of their
[1:19:15] chief it roused them to put forth their
[1:19:18] mightiest energies
[1:19:20] and they did all that human strength
[1:19:22] could do to turn and to stem the
[1:19:25] dreadful tide of battle
[1:19:27] and there is not a charm to you o
[1:19:30] believer
[1:19:31] and the fact that you contend in the
[1:19:33] battlefield of life under the eye of the
[1:19:35] savior
[1:19:36] wherever you are however you are
[1:19:39] oppressed by foes however exhausted by
[1:19:42] the stern strife with evil the eye of
[1:19:45] christ is fixed lovingly
[1:19:47] upon you
[1:19:50] i thought of how that just just the
[1:19:52] thought of that man lifting up his l or
[1:19:55] lifting himself by his elbows though
[1:19:57] gushing out with blood but crying out to
[1:20:00] his to his fellow soldiers and saying i
[1:20:02] still see you how that allows them to
[1:20:05] keep fighting and then turn the tide i
[1:20:07] see how much more for us believers
[1:20:09] tonight to know that yes he paid the
[1:20:11] price he gave his life but he has come
[1:20:14] back in power and his loving eye is upon
[1:20:17] you every moment no matter the pressure
[1:20:19] that you're facing no matter the battles
[1:20:21] that come your way his loving eye is
[1:20:24] upon you
[1:20:26] oh man a man that's ever received the
[1:20:28] holy ghost don't care whether he begs
[1:20:30] for bread brother branham says
[1:20:33] or not does it make a difference to him
[1:20:35] why because he's a heaven-bound creature
[1:20:40] he's got no ties here at all that's
[1:20:42] right he don't care let them come let
[1:20:44] them go what may let them criticize make
[1:20:47] fun lose your prestige
[1:20:50] what do you care you're on your road to
[1:20:52] glory hallelujah your eyes are set on
[1:20:55] christ and you and you're on your road
[1:20:57] you don't care what the world says
[1:21:00] that's what the holy ghost is it's a
[1:21:02] power
[1:21:04] come on i believe there's some people
[1:21:05] that know what i'm talking about tonight
[1:21:07] it's a seal
[1:21:09] it's a comforter it's an advocate it's a
[1:21:12] sign oh my
[1:21:14] he says it's the assurance that god has
[1:21:17] received you
[1:21:20] that's why you consider tonight and say
[1:21:22] it doesn't matter what comes my way
[1:21:24] god's in control
[1:21:25] i've been sealed
[1:21:27] i've been set free i'm a new creation
[1:21:30] i'm a brand new man
[1:21:32] yes i'm tempted but i don't long for
[1:21:34] that old life temptations come my way
[1:21:37] but there is something inside of me that
[1:21:39] says get thee behind me satan
[1:21:42] oh my why because there isn't a power
[1:21:44] inside of you it's not a sunday morning
[1:21:47] power only it's not old sunday night
[1:21:49] power only it's not a wednesday night
[1:21:51] power only it's not a meeting power only
[1:21:54] but it's an eternal power that has been
[1:21:57] with you and it's in you and it'll be
[1:21:59] all the way to the end
[1:22:02] oh lord i believe
[1:22:05] help my unbelief
[1:22:07] you ever been in that position lord i
[1:22:10] believe help my unbelief
[1:22:12] you don't want to leave this you don't
[1:22:14] want to walk into the world but there's
[1:22:16] times you go through those moments
[1:22:18] of that you trust god you but there's
[1:22:21] still some doubt lord i believe help my
[1:22:23] unbelief
[1:22:25] i know you can do it lord
[1:22:28] so speak it
[1:22:30] you say you have the holy ghost
[1:22:31] speak it
[1:22:33] listen to this in matthew 8 8 the
[1:22:34] centurion answered and said lord
[1:22:37] i am not worthy
[1:22:38] that thou should has come under my roof
[1:22:42] but speak the word only
[1:22:44] and my servant shall be healed
[1:22:48] for i am a man under authority having
[1:22:50] soldiers under me and i say to this man
[1:22:53] go and he goeth unto another come and he
[1:22:55] cometh and to my servant do this and he
[1:22:57] doeth it
[1:22:58] when jesus heard it he marveled and said
[1:23:00] to them that followed verily i say unto
[1:23:02] you i have not found so great faith no
[1:23:06] not in israel
[1:23:09] you say well that's talking about jesus
[1:23:11] wait a minute you are right
[1:23:14] but where does your authority come
[1:23:16] acts 1 8 but you shall receive
[1:23:19] power
[1:23:21] not before
[1:23:22] after
[1:23:24] that the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:23:26] not after just an uh a fleshly anointing
[1:23:29] but we're talking about the change and
[1:23:31] ye shall be witnesses unto me both in
[1:23:33] jerusalem and in judea and samaria and
[1:23:35] to the uttermost part of the earth you
[1:23:37] shall receive power what is that power
[1:23:39] it's authority to speak to any mountain
[1:23:41] in your life
[1:23:43] authority to speak to any problem any
[1:23:45] circumstance to pray for your children
[1:23:47] to pray for your husband to pray for
[1:23:49] your style your wife to pray for your
[1:23:51] church
[1:23:55] authority to be able to speak to it
[1:23:58] you've been given authority church
[1:24:01] you say well i have to wait on i listen
[1:24:03] i have definitely four praying laying on
[1:24:05] of hands that's not what i'm saying you
[1:24:07] have to understand that we cannot just
[1:24:09] wait only for that
[1:24:11] if you have the holy ghost you have the
[1:24:13] power and authority to speak to whatever
[1:24:14] demon comes your way
[1:24:16] well brother david's probably sleeping
[1:24:18] right now i better not call him yet i'm
[1:24:20] just going to sit here and let this
[1:24:21] demon torment me
[1:24:22] until i can get a hold of him
[1:24:24] no sir
[1:24:26] no man you just get a hold of god and
[1:24:29] you begin to rebuke that demon with
[1:24:31] every with that anointing that's inside
[1:24:33] of your life
[1:24:34] that's that's that's what i'm trying to
[1:24:36] say but then there are times that you've
[1:24:38] got to call the the elders of the church
[1:24:40] it's scriptural i get that but don't
[1:24:42] forget the power that god has given you
[1:24:44] to be able to speak to the mountain
[1:24:46] yourself to be able to claim the word
[1:24:48] for yourself to not just wait upon this
[1:24:51] event or wait upon this evangelist but
[1:24:53] god has given you the power of the holy
[1:24:55] ghost to be able to speak to that
[1:24:57] tormentor and say you can't torment me
[1:25:00] any longer you can't hold me any longer
[1:25:03] hallelujah
[1:25:05] that's where your authority comes
[1:25:08] let it be more
[1:25:10] than just only believe
[1:25:14] you see how we've sang that song for
[1:25:15] many years only believe
[1:25:18] all things are possible
[1:25:20] but it's time that we begin to speak it
[1:25:24] and let it come alive
[1:25:26] i want us to i want to just read that i
[1:25:29] actually didn't didn't put that
[1:25:30] scripture here but i'm trying to
[1:25:32] remember from remember from my memory
[1:25:35] about i have believed
[1:25:38] therefore have i spoken
[1:25:42] see a lot of times we get caught up in
[1:25:43] the believing part
[1:25:45] but we believe and then wait
[1:25:48] we need to believe the scripture then
[1:25:50] says it says it twice once in the old
[1:25:52] testament and then it refers back to it
[1:25:54] in the new testament i have believed
[1:25:57] therefore have i spoken so if you're
[1:26:00] believers tonight you're not just sit
[1:26:02] sent to just sit here in this pew and
[1:26:04] just believe
[1:26:06] only and just to wait and just so i
[1:26:09] wonder no here it is thank you we have
[1:26:12] we have in the same spirit of faith
[1:26:14] according as it is written so they're
[1:26:16] referring to what it said in the old
[1:26:17] testament i believed and therefore have
[1:26:20] i spoken we also believe and therefore
[1:26:24] speak
[1:26:25] so when we sing only believe all things
[1:26:28] are possible only believe we must not
[1:26:31] just get stuck in a rut that we're just
[1:26:32] singing a song and wondering if god's
[1:26:35] going to move but we must speak it into
[1:26:38] action speak life
[1:26:41] speak life to yourself remove the stone
[1:26:44] away so god can call about oh my
[1:26:49] this is not your challenge we're coming
[1:26:51] to a close but this is putting the word
[1:26:53] of god on display
[1:26:55] and this is our moment this is our
[1:26:57] moment not to prove ourselves
[1:27:00] but to vindicate his word
[1:27:03] i am not here tonight just to vindicate
[1:27:05] myself whoever would be ministering
[1:27:07] we're not here to vindicate ourself
[1:27:10] we're here to point to the word of god
[1:27:12] let the word of god vindicate itself by
[1:27:15] bringing it to pass
[1:27:17] again i i we we could try to pump up i
[1:27:19] like what brother jr said many many
[1:27:21] years ago he said i can't i'm not here
[1:27:23] to pump you up he said it's hard to pump
[1:27:25] up a ball full of holes
[1:27:29] man i'll still never forget that i said
[1:27:31] boy that's the truth lord maybe we need
[1:27:33] some passion tonight
[1:27:37] i have believed do you believe tonight
[1:27:41] what is it that you believe you know
[1:27:42] it's sometimes easy to believe for
[1:27:44] someone else
[1:27:46] oh i believe that you can be healed i
[1:27:48] believe you can be set free oh i believe
[1:27:51] but what about you
[1:27:53] what about for yourself what about this
[1:27:54] thing that's been coming at you your
[1:27:56] whole life
[1:27:58] do you believe that god can set you free
[1:28:01] do you believe that you can walk away
[1:28:03] from these things that have been
[1:28:04] bringing you right back to the same path
[1:28:06] all the time
[1:28:07] where satan has said this is the way
[1:28:09] you're always going to be
[1:28:10] aren't you about tired of hearing that
[1:28:13] i say lord i don't want to hear that
[1:28:14] anymore
[1:28:15] i believe that you can set me free
[1:28:16] therefore i'm going to speak it
[1:28:18] i have been set free by the blood of the
[1:28:20] lamb
[1:28:22] we are troubled on every side yet not
[1:28:24] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[1:28:26] despair persecuted but not forsaken cast
[1:28:29] down but not destroyed why because the
[1:28:32] challenge is not to us the challenges to
[1:28:34] the king and the king if he has called
[1:28:37] you he is faithful to see you through
[1:28:39] and he will see you through the end when
[1:28:42] satan comes against you i want you to
[1:28:44] remember you don't have to do it on your
[1:28:46] own
[1:28:47] you are not here to prove it to me you
[1:28:49] are not here to prove it to the pastor
[1:28:51] you don't need to prove it to your
[1:28:52] parents you don't need to prove it to
[1:28:53] your spouse just trust in god walk in
[1:28:56] faith and keep moving forward as we said
[1:28:59] this morning keep the momentum going
[1:29:01] keep walking in the word of god keep
[1:29:03] seeking the word of god keep asking god
[1:29:06] give me more of your word reveal more to
[1:29:08] me i've got to get rid of myself so i
[1:29:10] can have more of you the more you let go
[1:29:13] of yourself the more god you can have
[1:29:15] the more you let go of your thoughts the
[1:29:17] more word you can get inside lord i
[1:29:19] surrender my thoughts i surrender my
[1:29:21] mind i surrender my opinion i surrender
[1:29:24] my ideas god fill me with your word
[1:29:27] saturate me with your presence
[1:29:30] why because he's given you authority to
[1:29:32] do so
[1:29:34] authority to speak to that enemy
[1:29:37] authority to speak to cancer
[1:29:39] authority to speak to whatever ailment
[1:29:41] that you may have
[1:29:43] but healing comes in many different
[1:29:45] forms
[1:29:46] healing of the mind
[1:29:48] as we know what is the greatest battle
[1:29:50] ever fought
[1:29:52] i'm so glad that we god gave us a
[1:29:54] prophet
[1:29:55] that allowed that he used to expose
[1:29:59] this
[1:30:03] maybe you didn't need it but i did
[1:30:06] because it was this mind
[1:30:08] that told me i didn't need to live
[1:30:10] anymore
[1:30:13] it was this mind that i allowed this the
[1:30:16] enemy to come in and tell me that i was
[1:30:19] better off brother david dead
[1:30:22] i was better off i was better off that
[1:30:25] my parents were tired of me i was better
[1:30:27] off the church wouldn't need me as a
[1:30:29] young person i remember hearing it
[1:30:31] constantly berating me telling me and i
[1:30:33] will remember grabbing a knife and
[1:30:36] putting it up to my chest and holding it
[1:30:38] just wanting to push it in
[1:30:41] and something inside says you can't do
[1:30:44] it
[1:30:44] and the mind said you're not man enough
[1:30:49] but something inside said
[1:30:51] you can't do it
[1:30:54] see there i don't know if you understand
[1:30:55] the paradox of that
[1:30:57] there was a war raging
[1:31:00] you basically know who won
[1:31:06] you're not seeing a ghost here
[1:31:08] you
[1:31:09] this this is me in the flesh
[1:31:12] but whatever suicide spirit came upon me
[1:31:15] it was an anointing of god i couldn't
[1:31:16] overcome it myself
[1:31:18] whatever this came upon me listen from
[1:31:21] my birth i will i'll never forget i know
[1:31:23] you know this testimony from the moment
[1:31:25] before i was born the doctors told my
[1:31:27] mom and dad that i needed to be aborted
[1:31:31] that i was going to be nothing but a
[1:31:32] vegetable that i was going to be nothing
[1:31:34] but uh and not only that when that
[1:31:37] didn't work they said if i was going to
[1:31:38] be born they would kill my mom
[1:31:42] she would not make it
[1:31:44] now the doctor it was her family doctor
[1:31:46] our family doctor
[1:31:48] and he seemed to care for him and he
[1:31:50] wasn't a man for abortion but he said
[1:31:52] you're going to die nancy
[1:31:53] if you don't do this
[1:31:56] he won't have he will he won't be able
[1:31:57] to have any motion he won't be able to
[1:31:59] have anything he's he's not going to be
[1:32:01] any good and it'll kill you you need to
[1:32:03] let him go
[1:32:05] but they said
[1:32:06] again i'm here so you know the end of
[1:32:08] the story
[1:32:10] i'm like i'm like never mind i'm just
[1:32:13] giving god the glory i'll if nothing
[1:32:15] else i'm just thankful to be here
[1:32:18] but they listen to god
[1:32:21] and when they listen to god guess what i
[1:32:23] did just so y'all know i used that same
[1:32:26] family doctor
[1:32:27] till he died
[1:32:30] every time i went in i said guess what
[1:32:32] i'm alive
[1:32:36] i'm alive
[1:32:38] the devil didn't get me i'm alive and he
[1:32:40] would always laugh and chuckle at me he
[1:32:42] said i know you are i can move my arms
[1:32:45] yes i know you can
[1:32:47] it doesn't matter well well you're going
[1:32:49] through this sickness but it doesn't
[1:32:50] matter i'm alive
[1:32:52] and i'm just here to remind you the same
[1:32:54] god that brought me there the same god
[1:32:56] that'll bring you through
[1:32:58] hallelujah you need to remind the enemy
[1:33:00] tonight
[1:33:02] i'm still alive
[1:33:04] i'm not dead
[1:33:05] why because there was something inside
[1:33:07] on the inside that said don't make that
[1:33:09] decision don't take that turn something
[1:33:12] keeps holding me
[1:33:13] hallelujah it's an anointing on the
[1:33:15] inside that you can't explain to the
[1:33:17] world don't try to explain the holy
[1:33:19] ghost because it's something that's
[1:33:21] unexplainable but it's an anointing
[1:33:24] inside that holds you when everyone else
[1:33:26] says it's it
[1:33:28] it says one more step
[1:33:31] when everyone says you you've crossed
[1:33:33] the line that inside spirit says one
[1:33:36] more step
[1:33:37] one more step one more step one more
[1:33:41] battle one more trial one more day one
[1:33:44] more moment you keep pressing
[1:33:47] satan comes and says it's it you hear
[1:33:50] that anointing inside take another step
[1:33:53] and every step you take are footsteps of
[1:33:56] possession everything that satan thought
[1:33:58] that he he was going to stop you from
[1:34:00] getting your living and breathing today
[1:34:02] testimonies you say i don't have a
[1:34:04] testimony yes you do satan doesn't have
[1:34:07] me
[1:34:08] i am a child of the living god
[1:34:11] he thought he did
[1:34:13] guess what
[1:34:14] boo you devil
[1:34:19] the challenge is not to you
[1:34:22] it's to the king that called you
[1:34:25] i'm just gonna tell you in my simple
[1:34:27] language i'm not very much theologized
[1:34:31] he's got this
[1:34:38] he's rolling up his sleeves
[1:34:40] even now
[1:34:42] he's ready
[1:34:44] to fight for you
[1:34:47] it didn't mean that you're going to sit
[1:34:48] on the couch and become a couch potato
[1:34:52] he didn't give you armor just so you
[1:34:53] could stand up in a museum and say look
[1:34:55] i got the armor no you're going to have
[1:34:57] to fight but he's with you
[1:35:00] and he's done rolled up his sleeves for
[1:35:02] that thing in your life that battle of
[1:35:04] that problem he's there ready to fight
[1:35:06] for you but it's time that we just look
[1:35:07] to our general tonight
[1:35:09] say lord here am i i'm here for service
[1:35:14] if he called you you're gonna make it
[1:35:17] let's stand tonight
[1:35:21] hallelujah
[1:35:24] now
[1:35:26] what have you heard today with this
[1:35:30] doesn't matter
[1:35:31] god's got this
[1:35:34] what he said here means more than
[1:35:36] anything that this mind has told you
[1:35:39] it said you were worthless you you there
[1:35:40] was nothing for you no it doesn't matter
[1:35:42] what that says what this says speak to
[1:35:45] the mountain
[1:35:47] speak with authority
[1:35:50] well
[1:35:53] if it be the lord's will
[1:35:56] perhaps
[1:35:58] i could possibly rebuke doubt
[1:36:02] no you become the kitten
[1:36:05] no there's got to be an anointing inside
[1:36:07] of you
[1:36:09] it doesn't have to be loud
[1:36:12] it doesn't even sometimes have to be
[1:36:14] spoken with these lips
[1:36:16] but let it come from here
[1:36:20] god you've got
[1:36:22] this i've made mistakes i know i have
[1:36:26] i've done things that i shouldn't have
[1:36:27] done but you're the one that called me
[1:36:32] uh don't don't take me wrong here but
[1:36:34] i'm gonna say it's your fault lord that
[1:36:36] i'm here
[1:36:38] you gotta put up with me lord
[1:36:41] hallelujah and you know what he wants to
[1:36:44] put up with you
[1:36:45] he wants to take you by the hand and he
[1:36:47] wants to take you all the way
[1:36:49] he didn't bring you that song he didn't
[1:36:50] bring you this far to leave you he
[1:36:52] didn't teach you to swim to let you
[1:36:53] drown
[1:36:54] he didn't build his home and yet to move
[1:36:56] away

[1:41:34] [Music]
[1:41:43] it's a reality
[1:41:45] [Music]
[1:41:50] amen did you enjoy that tonight
[1:41:54] amen the battles the lords
[1:41:57] amen
[1:41:59] you know i i thought as our brother was
[1:42:01] ministering
[1:42:03] you know i love it when the word of god
[1:42:06] comes alive and
[1:42:09] you know
[1:42:11] there's a great scripture and we say it
[1:42:14] all the time it's probably one of the
[1:42:16] scriptures that
[1:42:17] repeated most in our life but
[1:42:20] [Music]
[1:42:22] and it says now faith is the evidence of
[1:42:24] things hoped for
[1:42:26] the evidence of things not seen
[1:42:30] i just want to shed some light on that
[1:42:33] tonight for your victory to
[1:42:36] go straighter it was made so real to me
[1:42:39] today
[1:42:41] when you're in a battle in a court fight
[1:42:44] or in any kind of battle
[1:42:47] you've got to predict present your
[1:42:49] evidence
[1:42:51] to win
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:55] if you don't present your evidence then
[1:42:58] the supposition is that
[1:43:01] you're guilty
[1:43:04] and
[1:43:05] and the prophet of god made a statement
[1:43:07] he says god can do nothing for you
[1:43:10] until you confess it first
[1:43:13] [Music]
[1:43:16] he can do nothing for you till you
[1:43:18] confess it first
[1:43:20] now we say we believe and and if we
[1:43:23] believe as our brother said tonight
[1:43:26] if we really believe and god's really
[1:43:28] fighting our battle for us
[1:43:30] then
[1:43:31] we have the evidence
[1:43:34] of what has not yet been seen
[1:43:39] it's not what's been seen that's our
[1:43:42] evidence
[1:43:43] our evidence is what produces the result
[1:43:47] of not sick
[1:43:50] not lost not guilty
[1:43:54] and if if you take this great
[1:43:58] word of god tonight and our prophet said
[1:44:00] you know god can do nothing for you
[1:44:03] unless you convince
[1:44:05] confess it first god can do nothing for
[1:44:07] you until you present the evidence
[1:44:10] of that faith
[1:44:12] that the confession of your faith
[1:44:16] is where healing comes from
[1:44:19] and that so moved me this morning
[1:44:21] because our brother stood here
[1:44:25] and he
[1:44:27] in the face of everybody
[1:44:32] said this is their evidence
[1:44:37] that was their case
[1:44:41] and they presented their evidences the
[1:44:44] doctors presented their evidence science
[1:44:46] presented their evidence
[1:44:48] civilization presents their evidence
[1:44:51] psychology presents their evidence
[1:44:54] psychiatry presents their evidence
[1:44:58] but he's that waymaker
[1:45:01] and our evidence is it's not my battle
[1:45:05] it's god's battle
[1:45:08] and he said
[1:45:10] and that settles it
[1:45:13] [Music]
[1:45:15] you'll never have a victory till you
[1:45:17] present the evidence
[1:45:20] you'll
[1:45:21] our brother said tonight
[1:45:23] he says the presenting of your evidence
[1:45:26] is speaking that
[1:45:29] which you hoped for
[1:45:32] and then it came substance
[1:45:35] by your word
[1:45:37] if god never said let there be
[1:45:40] there would have never been
[1:45:42] substance came
[1:45:45] from the speaking of the word
[1:45:48] faith
[1:45:50] is the substance
[1:45:53] of things hoped for
[1:45:57] the evidence of things not seen
[1:46:00] you present your evidence
[1:46:02] it gains substance
[1:46:05] and comes forth
[1:46:07] in a reality
[1:46:08] so take this inspiration from today i
[1:46:11] think we're all
[1:46:13] inspired today to live a more
[1:46:16] active life
[1:46:19] in the gospel
[1:46:21] to stand up against the negative things
[1:46:23] that have tried to flood us and and this
[1:46:27] side tracked and
[1:46:29] the questions in our heart and mind and
[1:46:32] settle it once or else as for me and my
[1:46:34] house
[1:46:36] we're gonna serve the lord as for me
[1:46:40] i'm going to serve the lord
[1:46:44] satan will never believe
[1:46:47] he'll never quit lying
[1:46:49] because he's the father
[1:46:52] of all lies
[1:46:53] and there's no truth in him
[1:46:55] he will remain ever a liar
[1:46:59] and his end is the lake of fire
[1:47:02] we just quit listening
[1:47:05] and when we do
[1:47:07] this is what we hear amen this is life
[1:47:11] to us tonight amen let us just
[1:47:14] take a moment bow our heads if
[1:47:16] if you have a special
[1:47:19] request on your heart tonight and
[1:47:22] something that you'd like to
[1:47:24] do something you'd like to present to
[1:47:26] the lord
[1:47:27] somebody you'd like to lift up into the
[1:47:33] to the lord tonight and place them on
[1:47:36] the altar of your heart
[1:47:38] before god some need
[1:47:42] something you believe with all your
[1:47:43] heart tonight and you'd like to bring it
[1:47:46] to him
[1:47:47] may you just speak it tonight first to
[1:47:50] him and
[1:47:51] then to the world of what he's going to
[1:47:53] do for you
[1:47:55] let us just lift our requests up for him
[1:47:59] maybe it's victory maybe it's overcoming
[1:48:01] power
[1:48:02] [Music]
[1:48:03] maybe it's answers to questions
[1:48:07] we just
[1:48:08] lift our hands
[1:48:10] before the lord before we're dismissed
[1:48:12] tonight our gracious heavenly father
[1:48:15] lord have we been inspired that the
[1:48:17] battle is yours
