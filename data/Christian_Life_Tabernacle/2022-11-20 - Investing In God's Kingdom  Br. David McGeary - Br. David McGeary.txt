the Lord God in which we live in they'll be bringing into subjection in every way father Lord we dedicated and we surrender all to you right now and to pray that you would have your way in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray this morning amen amen [Music] amen good to be gathered in the house of God I certainly want to welcome everyone all our visitors God bless you this morning Emmanuel may turn around and welcome someone is invited by the cosmen about celebrating this morning foreign God bless you um this is a surprise to you it's also a surprise to me and the Lord bless you but a few words that I can say to get us to read Psalm 100. if you want to turn to Psalm 100 we're entering into a week of Thanksgiving and um you know a lot of the times people in this world might identify with Thanksgiving with other things that the Lord May bless them with it may be a family member it may be something that they may try to identify with as far as their personal identity and thankfulness of how they can express their thankfulness to the Lord but we know as a people elected and predestinated of God our thankful heart is a little different and we don't thank him at least myself we don't thank him because he's given me something or because he's provided for me no those things are good they're just benefits but we thank him for him electing us and it's not a thankfulness of just boasting within ourselves of just saying you know Lord I'm so glad by the grace of God that you've given me life no it's greater than that because this election comes with power this election comes with attributes this election comes with the word of God and he's a shepherd of all things and he leads he's sheep and he sheep or he's called I'm sorry he's he's sheep or he's elect and they won't follow another voice they won't follow another man and so our thankful heart today as we're reading this psalm um the verses three and four really stood out to me it says know ye that the Lord he's God it is he that had made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name and I wanted to read this quote but Abraham says in the lemon dove in 1960 I think it's August 5th it says now I've wondered now I've often wondered why God ever represented us as Lambs we are the Sheep of his pasture if you notice a lamb is one of the most unusual animals that lamb cannot find his way back when he's lost I've race sheep and let her let her sheep get lost he will stand there and bleed till he dies he cannot find his way back he's got to have the shepherd lead him back and we will never find our way back through any other way but through the shepherd the human race lost it he needs they need the shepherd back we cannot find our way back through educational programs we cannot find our way back through science we cannot find our way back through religion the only way back and that's by the shepherd and we know who the shepherd is because in the beginning was the world and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us so let's all read Psalm 100 this morning as we read it together Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know naive that the Lord he is God it is he that had made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and to his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth endured to all generations amen God bless you amen God bless you may have your seats amen God's attributes were manifested to explore out in this life saying we have called to Revelation by the last prophets may say oh and we know who we are I know what we raise our full praise the Lord there is [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] there is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there is [Music] revealed Earth 17. it's under the original line there is soon [Applause] [Music] foreign

announce the arrival of their new baby he was born on November 9th at uh 10 23 a.m he weighed seven uh seven pound and 12 ounces and was 21 inches long the name of the baby is Joshua I mean it's

exalt you above all things that man has created for you are Lord of Lord and King of Kings Lord you Reign from beginning to end Lord you are Our Hope you are our righteousness you are our sacrifice Lord without you we certainly are nothing we ask you to bless us this morning Father we come to the house of the Lord to be corrected to be admonished to be instructed we're here to receive of you this morning Lord and we ask that you would come as you promised in Jesus precious name we pray amen and amen God bless you this morning uh nice to be in the house of the Lord and have a little bible study this morning if you have your Bibles and you would turn with me to the gospel of Mark and this is the scriptures concerning the Rich Young Ruler and uh uh for a reference if you would like to go back and read it I'm ministering from the message that brother Branham preach called investment and he preached it in several different places uh the one that worked is like is in August is 63 but he preached it several times so uh it caught my attention you know and I mean that it must have been a subject that uh is worthy to be considered you you understand when someone repeats something over and over again you might take a moment to say wait a minute there might be something here so naturally you know I can never do it justice but you have the original source so I hope I encourage you to go back to the original source as we ask the Lord to stimulate our hearts and our minds this morning amen it says and this is just after he had blessed the children and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeling to him and asking him good Master what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life amen and um and Jesus said unto him why call us doubt me good there is none good but one that is God amen thou knowest the Commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness deprived fraud not honor thy father and mother and he answered and said unto him master all these have I observed from my youth then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing that lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hath and give it to the poor and thou shalt have Treasures in Heaven and come take up the cross and follow me and he he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions amen and Jesus looked around about and said unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter in to the kingdom of God Heavenly Father we ask you to bless us in Jesus precious name we pray amen God bless you may be seated dude we noticed that in this story and as if you go back and read or listen to these sermons you'll notice that this Young Rich and ruler or this young person he's a pretty good type or example of most people in general not only people that have a lot but people uh in general they have a great desire to do something or to accomplish something but when it comes time to paying the cost that's when things change and we notice that this uh ruler he must obviously noticed that Jesus had something he had something to offer he had something that he was showing forth we know that in the scriptures like in Matthew 9 and 35 Acts 20 and 25 those are scriptures that were referring that Jesus went forth preaching the kingdom of God so he he was he was went and began to preach that there's something that exists that that that is there that's real and it we like to use this expression if uh I could in no means to uh make it seem of less value but Jesus was presenting or we might use the word selling uh not in the fact that he was asking for uh some something monetary but he was mating the people aware that there was another kingdom and I believe that all of us here this morning uh realized that there's got to be something more than just this world uh we can look over the time of the world and we can see the progression of it uh I mean it's hard to believe uh I hope this isn't too carnal but it's hard to believe that at one time there was no indoor plumbing you know look how soft you are you can't imagine life without indoor plumbing there was a time that there was not a telephone there was a time that there wasn't an automobile ah let's all walk over to brother Tommy's house for lunch I'd get there about two weeks from now come up because we want to uh try to catch our minds this morning imagine that there was not an airplane imagine the only way you could get across the ocean was in a boat driven by wind and it would take two or three months to travel imagine that there was no electricity that everything that you did was by candlelight okay could you imagine that you only had one or two dresses or even worse one pair of shoes hmm that was for the Sisters you could imagine all the things that uh we have now and how soft living has become and and in realizing this we realize that things have progressed and we've got science and technology and education and all these great things but all these great things are are of the devil because they're not of the kingdom of God and so when Jesus came Jesus came preaching that there is a a land uh beyond the river if we could say it that or life after death but so many times that we begin to place that life after death as being the kingdom of God but the scripture tells us behold the kingdom of God is at hand if you would read in Matthew that's what John went out preaching he preached repent of your sins and and behold because the kingdom of God is at hand so the kingdom of God is is uh more the Bible tells us than words it it's uh it is the power of God for that's First Corinthians 4 and 20 the kingdom of God is not in word only but in power so the the scripture was trying to allow us to realize that there is another kingdom and now we talk about seeking the kingdom of God and so first of all Jesus came preaching the kingdom of God he and that was what that he was trying to get man to realize that there's more to this life than this life and there's more to this world than just the carnal world that you see all the things that man has done all the technology and all the great things that have gone forth to make life easiest for us we've got to realize that that's Satan's Eden that's the kingdom that Satan is building that we would seek his kingdom instead of the kingdom of God and Jesus came to bring us to the awareness that the kingdom that we see the Easy Living that we see the the way that man thinks uh I I kind of Marvel at the thinking of man we don't want to have the thinking of man we want to have the thinking of God but I think it's for good for us to realize you know to that man now they don't they want to get rid of all fossil fuel and they want to run on batteries because uh they don't want the air that they're breathing to get polluted to where that they can't breathe and yet they'll eat so much junk you know what I mean that's destroying their body there there's being destroyed from within trying to protect themselves from what's without and I think if we're not careful spiritually we get destroyed Within and and that's what we want to grow stronger in this morning and just wanting to share this little short thought with you this morning that there is another kingdom there is something else that runs parallel to the life that we're living to the uh daily emotions we have in our five senses and our emotional inlets and all the things that we come in contact with and that we strive for uh we strive to survive we feel that it's important to maybe have some of these luxuries pay our electric bill pay our water bill uh you know have an automobile rent an apartment rent shelter uh to have all these things and act and we become totally conscious of of the world that's around us and and we begin to uh to strive of for that comfort and for that existence and a lot of effort Goes Forth to that but wouldn't it be wonderful and and I'm going to talk this morning because I believe you're all believers we come off a wonderful uh weekend of meetings and we saw in those great things the how the Lord came and spoke to us and I know many of you enjoyed because it was placed in such a beautiful manner about the will of God for our lives and uh how brother Michael brought out about uh the arrows that in this Bible story we remember he talked about a man just took an arrow and shot an arrow uh he just shot it out towards the enemy he didn't have a Target but there was a prophecy right that the dogs would lick the blood so God used that Arrow to strike the king and fulfill that prophecy and so we realized then that God had prophecy for our lives that he wants to fulfill and we realize that by using that analogy that uh when we have need of something that of the scripture tells us that don't be worried about those things right that God's got uh we can use in that terminology he's got an arrow or he's got a plan for your life because he said that he would Supply our every knee so he knows the beginning from the end he knows where you'll be tomorrow he knows where you'll be in two weeks from now he knows everything that's going to come your way he knows the burdens that you have he knows the sufferings he has he knows he knows the enemy that's going to attack you he understands that in fact he he gave us the weapon already to defeat all the attacks of the enemy that ever will come against us every circumstance every trial every battle and everything he's already given us something to to combat that he gave us his word he knew the battle would be in our mind he knew that's where Satan would get us is with our thinking just thinking thinking thinking you know have you ever had uh one of those nights I I'm mentioning this because I just had one where you can lay down but your mind won't stop I mean it's just and you're trying you're just trying to get to sleep and you want to just go to that other realm you know where you dream dreams and and you kind of your body just seems to rest but your mind's just churning churning churning well that's what he does to us all the time he keeps our mind working and working and working and working and and laboring and and struggling and trying to survive and yet the Lord came preaching a kingdom that says I give you peace that surpasseth understanding I give you Joy unspeakable and full of Glory look he told the the little lady at the well because she says he's she said give me the drink and and and she said this isn't customary he said if you know who I was if you knew what I had to offer if you knew what I was telling people about if you knew what I was preaching if you knew what I was going to The Villages and the highways and the byways and into the cities and into the synagogues and telling everybody uh what I've been showing them and what I've been presenting to them you would ask me for the product because that I'm presenting he says because I have Living Water and if you drink of this water you'll never thirst can you imagine you'll never hunger you'll never thirst after the things of the world there there won't be a desire to have to survive there won't be a desire to have to climb the ladder there won't be a desire for the things of the world but there's something that can come that that satisfies the soul and and that is the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is something that's present tense and so that's what he was preaching he was preaching the existence if I could say this of a place where there was rest come unto me all ye that are heavy laden and I will give you rest I wonder how many uh believers and let's take them not only within the framework of this message but Believers of all Faith people that claim to believe in the Lord Jesus who have no rest they have no security they have no place of comfort they're always worried about what's down the road they're always concerned about their finances they're always concerned about their health you know I mean I I drive by I try it every now and then to go work out a little bit you know what I mean and then the the only benefit I ever get from it is sore muscles and you got to go back at it again you got to keep up keep it up and and but they're concerned about their life they're concerned about their health they're concerned about their jobs they're concerned about their station in life whether they're climbing the ladder going up the ladder they're concerned about their 401K uh do you know how much money do they have for the future and the Lord said that fool no it's not that your life may be required of you this night they've got this this terrible burden and and the burden is the burden of this world to be able to keep up with the world and and we've seen in time how people have came to recognition of the world and the way that it's going if you go back and look at the Mennonites and the the different uh the Amish and the different people back in that air when the Industrial Revolution came and they saw the advancement of man because they recognize that that's right you understand as being the the things of the world and things that would take them farther away from God so they they stopped right there they weren't going to take on the technology of the gasoline engine of machine driven things because they weren't sure where it was leading they couldn't find evidence of it in their scriptures so I want you to look at a people that saw the world I I I'm just being honest with you this morning you know what I mean I I hope you don't just come here so that I can flatter you you know oh you're all going to heaven it's going to be an easy run no it's not but but they recognize and I think that's sometimes that where we fail to to come to the realization is is what the world is what is the world can what are the the the things of the world and I think that isn't one of the things that we're all striving here this morning is I believe we're all here because we want to we know there's another kingdom we know there's another life a Spirit-filled life we understand that so if you can look at a people that today our God living with horse and Buggies no lights candles they don't want to go any further because they had a recognition of the world and of course we know that they things begin to break down and okay and they begin to try to come up with other things we're not necessarily here to talk about their lifestyle and their choices but we are talking about how that man in different times recognized the world and the things of the world so let's just turn in our Bible I don't really have a a any exact pattern that we're we're going to but let's look over in uh Matthew uh the sixth chapter let's just go to the 19th verse so one of the things we talk a lot about here being in the message is the mind of Christ right let this mind be in you that was in Christ to think like Christ what is the word the thoughts expressed having the word of God having the word of God in our thoughts thinking like the word of God that's what we want because that's what our our hearts desire is is if we're not going to have you you've heard the expression a change of heart well they had a change of heart in the matter well that means they changed their thinking about it they changed their reasoning about it they changed their approach about it that's why we always give one another the benefit of the doubt you know we don't automatically take a negative stance against something or somebody that everything that they're doing they've got an alternative motive and objective you know stand back and don't make judgment don't be quick to judge don't let Satan push you from one side to the other or get a bad feeling or a bad opinion about somebody or or let him plant a seed in your mind against somebody oh they're just stuck up they're just this knob or or they're just this or they're that that there may not be a lot of of the other side of the story that you don't know so you you don't you don't come you're slow to judgment slow to wrath slow to speak evil you know what I mean because there might be something that comes along that changes your thinking I I remember brother uh uh Ernie villain wave I I believe he preached the message called a paradigm shift because he's gone to be with the Lord but uh he said that the minute people have it opinions of something and and they'll look at it and they'll have an opinion about it and then all of a sudden certain information becomes available and instantly they have a complete Paradigm Shift about something about somebody you know what I mean when you find out more information it changes your heart it changes your attitude it changes your approach because now you have a greater Enlightenment and a greater understanding and that's what we're here to do and that's what our messenger came to do was to open our eyes that we could see things the way God sees it and when you begin to see things the way God sees it it becomes more evident to you that what Satan's trying to sell you Satan appears as an angel of Light and that doesn't mean he shows up in a shining suit of armor no his things that he offers appears to be beneficial to you for your betterment you know what I mean I I'm not good with technology I just missed it by a few years but everything they think is beneficial a paperless Society a cashless Society everybody does everything not on their phone well I can't see it I can't touch it I don't believe it's there Leslie will say your boarding passes on your phone I'd make me a paper one I'm the only one in line with the paper but I know I got it I'm not going to go to that stupid box and touch the wrong thing and have that dude disappear and then stand there for 15 minutes I know it's in there somewhere I don't even know if it's there or if it's up there This Cloud deal scares me because to me now I know I'm crazy like I said that you can't I can't help it I've done lost it a long time ago but if he's supposed to come in the clouds then what's this other thing up there in the clouds to me it's just a perversion you know just the type I lost my thought s May where was I at e all right I don't know what I was talking about before I started talking about this but anyway so we we know that there's this uh another kingdom so we know the battles in the mind and everything is like beneficial and he wants it to make it look beneficial but so let's look at how Jesus looked at things now remember all the kingdoms of the world were offered to him oh yeah he offered them Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and Amazon and and uh Zulu land and you name it they were all offered to him all the kingdoms of the world all the things that had control over the people all the things that control mankind were offered to Jesus all the sports world just think this morning people got out is freezing cold but they got out real early they put paint on their face they put numbers on their on their uh uh clothes you know what I mean Viking hats and big cheese heads and whatever other crazy thing that they're worshiping and they're going to get up and they're going to drive down there real early and they're going to start a barbecue and they're gonna sit there all day so then they're going to pay three four hundred dollars to go in and watch people running around for a couple hours those things were controlling the minds and actions of the people and they were all offered to Jesus but look at his mind let's just read here the 19th verse of the sixth chapter the mind of the Lord lay not up yourselves Treasures upon the Earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal this morning about three o'clock in the morning all of a sudden I have a panic attack I think my goodness I didn't lock the trailer up and I've had one stolen so at three o'clock in the morning I'd get out of bed oh you don't think that this mind will make you do things how do I get out of bed and I wasn't sleeping good anyway and I got dressed and I drove over to the church and lo and behold there the trailer was and somebody had put the bucket down on it and it was safe and secure and I went back home to try to get some sleep you know what I'm saying and and so the power of these things is a man man where thieves break through and steal so in other words I had to be totally aware that there's people out there that steal you understand a thief to me is one of the lowest down human beings there are that's me personally I can't believe somebody would steal another person's livelihood steal their tools steal the things that they work with I mean who who would do such a a thing like that somebody that doesn't have the mind of Christ that's who does those things people that are living with a different mindset a different mind in them they don't have the mind of the Lord they only have the mind of the world and the things of the world and they seek after the things of the world but listen to what he's saying here he says late night your Treasures up where Thief Rick Inman but lay up yourselves Treasures in Heaven where neither moth nor rust of corrupt or where thieves do not break through nor steal for where your Treasures is there will your heart be also the light of the body is the eye if therefore the eye be single thy whole body shall shall be full of Light how many knows what he means when the singleness of I that doesn't mean one eye people it means when you're only looking and concentrating and projecting in one way in one way another those that seek the kingdom of God first their whole body will be their light now isn't this what we've all been talking about be more in the kingdom of God more like Christ more have our light shine be more spiritual doesn't everybody want to hear be more spiritual than more carnal why because we know what the reward of carnality is the wages of sin is what death the gift of God's eternal life but if I I be evil the whole body shall be full of Darkness if they're they're if they're for the light that is in thee be Darkness how great is that Darkness think of these things we don't even realize how dark Things Are or even in your lives if there's things in there that aren't right how how dark is that Darkness I want to get rid of that Darkness don't you no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he'll hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mann them or the world see it's coming down Church to one or the other religion and denominations and the world religious system allows you to do both and that was the condition of this Rich Young Ruler he wanted to serve God because he recognized that there was something there that he didn't have and he wanted it what must I do to have what you have because Jesus was preaching the kingdom in other words he possessed something didn't he he possessed a life and an atmosphere and an attitude and an ability that was Supernatural in other words what he had is he had a power he had a power over the things of the world in other words because things of the world that didn't get him he said foxes have holes and birds have nests but the son of man has no place to lay his head in other words I don't have worldly possessions he relied on the father he was walking the our Prophet described it to light to us like this he was a Mystic hmm walking in a world all of his own tax time fish needed some Finance throw your net on the other side why does that murmur that the hath brought no bread look at his mind look at where he was look at really look at the Kingdom that he was preaching the power that he was preaching his freedom from the world what it was that he was representing and telling people existed he was showing everybody that there was another existence of another kingdom another way to live another Power another way of thinking another way of approaching and he wasn't entangled with it and this Rich Young Ruler saw that and he wanted some of it well let's just continue therefore I say unto you take no thought of your life how many is good at that we're loaded down with thoughts of our life I don't can you imagine me spending 10 minutes in front of the mirror I ain't going to change it I got a change coming Hallelujah but I'm not why should I care about that be clean you know what I mean I don't believe in not being clean I don't believe in coming to church not having bathed in two or three days and think that the the aroma that you set off is spiritual look I believe in being clean but he says take no thought of your life what ye shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body more than reign of it now we're talking about the mind of the Lord how he looked how he proceeded behold the fowls of the air for they so not neither do they reap nor gather into Barns and yet your heavenly father feedeth them are ye not much better than they which of you taking thought can add one cubic unto your stature and why take he thought for intimate consider the lilies of the field how they grow and toil not neither do they spin and I say unto you that even Solomon and All His glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if God so clothed the grass of the fields which today is and tomorrow is cast in the oven shall he not much more clothe You O ye of little faith in other words you that don't believe that this other Kingdom that's running parallel and alongside this world that our flesh is in exists I wonder how many are of us are totally aware that there is another kingdom here right now and we can't serve both of them what was Lady Elsia lukewarm what is lukewarm it's a mixture of hot and cold it's a lukewarm person trying to serve the world and serve God too this Rich Young Ruler was the evidence of the lady of sea of spirit in that day when it came time to sell out a hundred percent to this life this power this way of thinking and this existence of the kingdom of God that's here right now he knew in order to do that he would have to live leave this thinking this world these possessions he said what must I do to inherit the kingdom if I could just for this morning get it out of your mind the kingdom is in heaven Heavens were those that possess the kingdom go when this world is destroyed but they already have the kingdom behold the kingdom of God is within you Luke 17 21 behold the kingdom of God is within you why if it's within you it's something that you possess is something that's going to give you something that's going to separate you from the world and the things of the world let us finish reading therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or whether with shall we be clothed for all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take their no thought for the morrow for the moral shall take shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof he was showing and preaching a kingdom then he showed the existence of that Kingdom he showed the existence of that Kingdom when he met the woman at the well he showed the existence of that Kingdom when that Widow came with her dead son on the way to bury him and that Kingdom and the fruits of this Kingdom which the wages of sin is death came in contact with the resurrection and the life and when those two kingdoms collided as Amen in the way his life was greater than the death that he encountered and he beheld the Widow he understood her plight he understood her sorrow but because of what that he was that death could not go past him and he proved that his kingdom I am the way the truth the life no man cometh unto the father but by me he showed evidence of his kingdom and raised that person from the dead he showed evidence of the kingdom when he raised Lazarus every miracle that he went through was trying to prove the evidence of the Kingdom that it exists that it's real that is life so the kingdom exists the scripture tells us I believe if we would read it in first John 2 and 15. I'm going to close quickly now listen what he said love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man loved the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the Lusk of the eyes the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world the world passeth away and the lust thereof and he that does the will of the father abideth for ever what is the world and the things of the world have you ever thought really and understood what is the world or the things of the world why is he telling us seek first the kingdom of God and all these things other things will be added unto you take no thought for your clothes take no thought for this take no thought for that don't get caught up in that thinking don't get caught up in that way of life be content in whatever state you are seek ye first the kingdom of God and its righteousness so what the prophet had brought brought out he said that this Young Rich ruler came up he saw the kingdom that Jesus was preaching and he wanted to be a partner in it he wanted to have some of it he wanted a possession but when it came time to pay the price to get that kind of power oh my God to get that kind of a spirit that Jesus possessed in other words for him to have the same spirit that Jesus did the same mind the same attitude the same approach the same freedom Jesus didn't have to go to the cross he went to the cross for you to make an entrance the Bible says into the Glorious kingdom of God he went there so you could leave the world and the things of the world and come into a spiritual life and a possession let me say that again a possession of something that would allow you to have no thought right of what tomorrow holds no thought about your retirement no thought about your bank account no thought of your survival or the things of the world Jesus said because I live you shall live also what are the prophets oh man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul this guy wanted all that but he didn't want to pay the price now and I had a bunch of quotes but I'm not going to read them this morning I'm going to try to close Jesus said he presented the young man an opportunity to invest in the Kingdom and that's the part that I feel this morning and I feel it for myself first and possibly if I need it then maybe possibly we all ought to consider it so it's not a judgment thing or a condemnation thing or going through the congregation and trying to seek out uh what your little problem is to cause some sort of conviction on you so that you would make some sort of emotional response of repentance that that that doesn't do any good because most people that repent are repenting for what that they've done it's a past tense movement I'm sorry I did this I sorry I did that I'm sorry I did this oh I shouldn't have done that I regret doing that I wish I never had that on my record the trouble with that type of repentance is you're really repenting for something that's already been forgiven the repentance should be for what you invested in that you put your time and your effort and your energy into the world and the things of the world this man was offered the opportunity to invest in the kingdom of God another sell what you have give it to the poor that was an investment just like that man took his money and went and bought wheat fields because the weather was good and he knew there would be a greater yield than the cost so an investment if I could just read the definition the investment is to put money time labor devote energy to an undertaking that is worthwhile and produces a prophet you invest because you believe you're going to get greater in return than what you put into it that's when investment means that you get better now look at us first of all we invest invest means to invest time I don't have a phone I have a phone but it's in my office but take somebody if I was to sit here hand me that chair right here can you hand me that chair I'd come down and get it but I want to use it because I'm getting tired and I'm old so I'm going to sit down now I got this phone here and I'm going to sit here for the next 30 minutes playing sick bird you know what sick bird is I heard about it and I guess there's what battle whackers and moon hunters and all that other thing I want you to understand video games is a terrible investment a terrible investment there's no prophet in it there's no future in it there's no return in it the next time you apply for a job right on there I reached the fifth level of Masters of the Universe that guy is going to say this guy wastes his time there is no return on his energy his time his money his devotion no return on it whatsoever wasted you don't think God mentions that people who have a talent and bury it and waste it it'll be taken from you I want you to if you could get it in your mind when you sit down there at that computer and and do all those things that is a terrible terrible terrible worthless investment what do you put your time into just tell me what's the return I don't know I know none of you guys up here spend time on your cell phones you're smarter than that but can anybody tell me what the re return is on Battle Warriors of America if you complete the game you mean you could nobody because I'm I wouldn't hope any of you wouldn't be able to but it's the thought of it can you imagine all the effort that's put forth all the money and time that's put forth into something that's going to fail Heaven and Earth will pass away but my kingdom Jesus says is Everlasting I'm preaching an everlasting Kingdom now this Kingdom that we're talking about is a power hey man go in the upper room and Terry there until you are endued with power from on high that's the kingdom the kingdom is the Holy Spirit In You let me just read a few statements in and I I won't be long foreign there's not one more sign done until Sodom was burned the last thing that the church is going to see is Christ manifested in his power in fullness in his church just before the fire falls now God's kingdom is net this is paragraph 132 out of Investments preached in a ugust 3rd 1963. now the kingdom of God is never of the world no matter how many intellectual men you can stand up I'm not condemning those people but I'm trying to show you a trick that Satan has done they cannot I don't care how big your Pentecostals you Oneness all once the threeness to unite with you you and the threeness once the Oneness and the Church of God and so forth to unite with your 31 odd organizations become one you Methodist Baptist and so forth the same way the economical Council that's just meeting over there this week to discuss the problems they're all wanting to unite in one and they'll do it the Bible says they'll do it make an image unto the Beast you see where the very background comes from a beast is a power and it will be a power but it will be the wrong power now I want you to understand the the whole thing of this world through education is to give you power to be able to make more money and survive and have a better life in this world what are the things of the world the things that the world has to offer all their inventions all their Easy Living all their comfortable underwear I've never heard so many advertisements about comfortable underwear boy I just got to go out and pay 45 dollars for a pair of comfortable undies give me a break that ain't a good investment not when you didn't buy Fruit of the Loom for for 12. what kind of sales pitch did you fall for you've been sucked into the world and the things of the world all the things the world has to offer to make you think you're better to think you're prettier to think you're more comfortable to think you're going to be more successful the success of a Christian is the rapture [Applause] they're gobbling us up they're gobbling us up by trying to get us to keep up remember Satan's wiser than the Sheep he's more crafty everything's greater bigger higher Society more comfortable more easier well got to have this got to have got to have that you know everything's a big event go down spend all kinds of money on game tickets I forget what event it was that was coming to town the ticket started a thousand dollars a thousand bucks that's a lot of money and you got a 50 50 chance you paid for the loser yeah I would rather put my money on a winner right I'd rather feed the poor I'd rather help the father and the Widow Widow in their affliction right I'd rather go the extra mile and turn the other cheat but we've been sucked in to investing in the world and the things of the world I should take a whole sermon going through all the things of the world that are worldly Earthly things I thought oh I think I'll drive a new pickup truck yeah so I go we're not going to look at a pickup truck here's the pickup truck I want to pick up a truck just like the one I got out there mines is several years old it's a 2015. it's heavy still looks good still runs good what's the bottom line I don't need a new pickup I don't need heated seats I don't need something that just comes up and picks me up puts me in the seat I sat down in the seat it moves right up to where I need to be right all the mirrors adjust just right and I don't even have to turn a key boom do I have to be aware what's around me no because it's got a beeper for this side a beeper for that side in fact I don't even have to parallel Park I just pull up and say Park me and it says Yes master and it goes you you so I'm going to give up all my ability and I'm going to lend all my coordination all my thinking to this machine that is now going to take over my life and make my life simple I like it it's ninety thousand dollars I don't like it because I'm not going to invest and put my money ninety thousand dollars in something that some fool out there I shouldn't call them fools that some person that's not paying any attention to can smash into that ain't wise I'm trying to just bring a point this morning the appoint is investing listen to what he says here he says Jesus said his kingdom was not of this world he said is my he said if it was his kingdom his disciples would fight but he said my kingdom is of above the kingdom of God is not an organization that can make great things it's the power of God the holy spirit in the human life that's what the kingdom of God is so what I'm trying to say this morning if we want more of the kingdom of God more of the power of God how many wants more the kingdom of God and more of the power of God how many wants to be more spiritual to be able to discern between Good and Evil to be able to recognize the world and its sales pitch now if you want that you've got to invest you've got to invest in the kingdom of God just back to my carnal example instead of sitting there trying to have this little man jump through loops and jump onto walkways and do all this stuff and the whole game is designed for you to fail and for you to labor and labor and labor and labor and work and work and think until you can get this little stupid thing on the screen that doesn't exist in reality to make a jump you don't think God's Gonna judge you for wasting your mind and your time on such junk as that yeah let alone all the other stuff we do I'm preaching it myself I realize I invest a whole lot of time a whole lot of thought in a whole lot of energy in things that profit nothing it wouldn't matter what kind of beautiful mansion that I built I can tell you the end of that mansion can you imagine a builder saying I built this mansion and it'll withstand the fires of hell by this mansion and it'll survive the end of the world no it won't they built a boat that God couldn't sink and it just ran into an ice cube and when blue they built their Invincible thing didn't they we're gonna go to the moon and we're going to escape this dying Earth you don't think the judgment's of God follow Jesus said if light is in you then great is that light and darkness is in you you know what they do if they went up to the Moon they'd start killing one another they'd start robbing one another they stopped stealing one another they would try to outdo one another why do we want to invest and put our time and put our effort and put our money into stuff that's going to fail we had a sign in our day we had the sign of Malachi 4 5. Luke 17 30 Revelations 10 7. we had one come in our generation turn this back to the audience discern the thoughts and intents of the heart prophesy to us what was coming the immorality the destruction what lady you'll see was going to turn into we've had every evidence that the kingdom of God exists and it's the holy spirit in you in power do you want the holy spirit in you in power to overcome the world power to speak your food into existence if there's none to be had are you willing to invest in that Kingdom are you willing to listen to a tape instead of play Mario Brothers are you willing to read your Bible instead of watching a movie are you willing to forgive somebody instead of the joy that you get thinking evil thoughts well some people just love to be mad they love to gossip they love to have a pity party they'll say things to people that are so hurtful that they don't even realize how hurtful it is but they can't control their tongue would you like to invest in bridling your tongue the tongues and unruly member and bitter and sweet can't come from the same Fountain people's tongues have got them in more trouble and more heartache been done more damage and cause more hurt feelings you know we can play all we want that were elected and we're the ones that's going but if you haven't invested in the Kingdom you have no representation there the kingdom of God is not in word the kingdom of God is not you saying that you're elect it's not you saying you're the bride it's not you saying you believe Satan believed this message and he fears and tremble your belief and the confession of your tongue amounts to nothing show me where you put your time show me where you put your money show me where you put your energy show me what you've done for the kingdom of God show me by your Works what you believe no everybody's skating they love to hear about the kingdom but they won't give a buck they won't give an hour they won't give a minute they won't give a prayer and they won't do any research Paul told Timothy study to show yourself approved that men might know what is the hope of your salvation so I'm I'm I'm saying it in this dramatic manner because I've come to understand something that faith is more than just the confession of the mouth faith is where that what you invest in if you want the power of the Resurrection if you don't have the Holy Spirit then I ask are you investing to get it are you praying maybe fasting maybe turning every stone going back and making things right in your life maybe go out and do a good work and help somebody there's givers and there's receivers there's askers and there's suppliers what do you want to be I know for a fact you can out give God said You cast your two mites he'll take care of you you can't out give God all you that are holding on and pinching your penny you're deceiving yourself I remember I had an opportunity one time they needed a road cut I was working as a chainsaw man and I could go out and cut this road take me six hours they're gonna pay me three thousand dollars now three thousand dollars and nineteen and seventy two was a good lick of change probably equivalent to thirty thousand dollars today or more but I had to do it on Sunday morning I had a choice to make oh I went through the Mind battle oh their Ox is in the ditch this would be a good a good testimony that I went out and did that for him but the word said the prophet said I read it he don't work on Sunday now some of you might have jobs you work on Sunday that's fine if you're a nurse maybe something like that maybe you have sift James but I do everything in my power to get out of it I'd go talk to your boss I would tell him I go to church on Sunday morning I give that time for the resurrection I can come in at six or I can come in at seven but I'd make some sort of sacrifice but you know what the problem with that rich young River was he didn't want to make the sacrifice that's what the prophet of God said when you go back and read this message he says they all believe in God but they don't want to separate themselves from the world they all believe in God and they want the power of God but they don't want to sacrifice they don't want to invest and if you don't continue to invest eventually your inflation get your investment if you're trying to run on the Holy Ghost you've got yesterday the evil of tomorrow is greater than what you have if you only got them you only put a gallon of gas in your spiritual tank you can only go so far and it runs out my truck sitting in my driveway this morning I took Leslie's car because I ran it down to where it said I got one mile till empty why I was too busy to invest in the time it took to put gas in my tank and now it's sitting there worthless this kingdom is real and this power is real but you're not going to receive the dividends of it without the investing in it you're not going to grow without reading more you're not going to grow without praying more you're not going to grow without studying anymore you can't just go on what you had yesterday the Hill's going to get steeper it's going to take more horsepower or spiritual power or white horsepower let me say it that way Lord of Lord in Kings of Kings it's going to take investing in the spiritual things to grow into rapturing conditions we're preaching way too much that it's just a big old gift from God that we don't have to do nothing that's not what he said he said go wait there and Tarry go there and invest your time your prayer you're thinking and I will Indo you with power from on high and then when they got that power he said go into all the world preach the gospel Lay Your Hands on the sick preach the repentance from sin another you got the power invest it put it into something worthwhile that it might grow how would you let your whole Christian existence you get up there and he says what do you have to show for the power I give you me not one convert not one witness not one prayed for the sick not one person counseled and loved or anything you just thought what you had was good enough and he's going to ask where's the return on the talent it would have been better if you would have invested it so I'm telling you church this morning and I'm taking this to myself yes we're elect yes were his chosen yes he did all these things yes he gave us power but he wants us to invest it that's a whole nother part of the true Gospel of God he wants you to take what you've given it's been freely given freely give he wants you to invest in the kingdom of God seek ye first the kingdom of God all the world he will take care of so Lord richly bless you and maybe it took me a long time to say that because I really didn't want to say it because everybody's happy with just being told you're going to be there regardless will you be lost maybe not the scripture says watch how you build and what you there build on because if you're not you'll be destroyed by fire your Works will be consumed by fire that you might be saved I'm saying let's be wise let's be wise as serpents and harmless of gods let us invest in the kingdom of God let us understand what the kingdom of God is let us ask for discernment of what the world is I shouldn't have to sit up here and explain to you what the world is and things of the world anything that's contrary to the word of God's Antichrist let's do what's right let's actually realize there's existence Kingdom we've seen the evidence we know that it's real the opportunity has been given to us to invest in it that we might receive the benefits no investing no benefits end the story I'm afraid we're getting close to Running on Empty we've used up all of our knowledge we've used up all of our Revelation we've used up everything we've got we've used up all the padding on the the backs of one another we can done I got quotes in here what he talks about it's unbelievable we've used all that up it's time we start filling our tanks again so we can make the rest of the journey and God bless you this morning brother [Applause] beautiful don't you love the word of God Amen it certainly knows where we are and how
