[3:51] heave [singing and music]
[3:53] my savior. Savior
[3:58] and all the fullness. [music]
[4:08] &gt;&gt; That's an approaching prayer. You pray
[4:11] in your heart. Our gracious heavenly
[4:14] father.
[4:16] Lord, we've assembled this morning at
[4:18] your feet,
[4:20] [music]
[4:22] knowing that you're Lord of Lord and
[4:24] King of Kings,
[4:26] creator of all things,
[4:29] a mighty God.
[4:33] And you so loved us, you sent your only
[4:36] begotten son
[4:39] that those who would believe on his
[4:41] name, you have given them power to
[4:43] become the sons and daughters of God.
[4:49] We've come this morning that we could be
[4:51] better sons and better daughters.
[4:55] That we could sit at your feet and learn
[4:57] of you.
[4:59] You could direct our path.
[5:02] You can speak words of life and wisdom
[5:05] and strength to us.
[5:09] Lord, we're nothing without you.
[5:13] As our brother spoke, the natural breath
[5:16] of our birth life will fail us.
[5:21] But you've given us the breath of your
[5:24] spirit
[5:25] that will lead us to eternity.
[5:28] Father, may that breath of life breathe
[5:31] within our spirits this morning.
[5:37] Father, we ask that you would forgive us
[5:40] any of our trespasses,
[5:44] any of our
[5:46] wrong thinking and bad attitudes and
[5:49] failed conclusions.
[5:54] But like Nan Nathaniel, Father, we come
[5:57] and
[5:59] to you and aresh to hear from you this
[6:04] morning.
[6:05] And we believe that you will speak
[6:07] because you promised that wherever two
[6:10] or three gathered together
[6:14] there you'd be in our midst. So by
[6:17] promise you're here.
[6:19] Give us Isab that we may see. We ask it
[6:23] this morning in Jesus precious and
[6:26] wonderful name we pray. Amen. And amen.
[6:31] God bless you. Love him this morning.
[6:33] We'd like to thank you once again uh for
[6:37] coming out to the house of the Lord. Uh
[6:40] somebody said, "Well, who's that
[6:42] brother?" I'm David McGary. I'm the
[6:45] pastor here. and and uh uh these are our
[6:49] minister brother here in the the church.
[6:53] I've got David and Matthew. They're my
[6:57] two sons. They don't they preach. And I
[6:59] have another son named Aaron that
[7:01] ministers in Arizona. And uh this is
[7:05] brother Paul, brother Sergio, brother
[7:08] Ben, and brother Billy, and brother
[7:11] Andrews, the tall brother
[7:14] in the back. So that's that's our local
[7:16] ministry and uh uh uh I don't have to
[7:21] preach very often because uh these men
[7:24] really love the word of the Lord and
[7:26] they're great. So [music] I I thank them
[7:29] for being here and throwing their
[7:31] shoulder to the wheel and all of you
[7:33] that help. If you had that wonderful
[7:36] pulled pork the other morning, that was
[7:39] brother Tim Syler cooked that pulled
[7:41] pork and and uh if you're really nice to
[7:45] him, he might do a special order for
[7:47] you. So, you never know. But that was
[7:50] really wonderful. Do you love him today?
[7:53] We we're also so grateful to have
[7:57] uh here just a month ago, brother Abby
[8:03] passed on to be with the Lord. He
[8:06] he fought a good fight and he ran a
[8:09] great race and he had tremendous
[8:12] influence in my life in lives around the
[8:14] world. a zeal for this message that
[8:19] I wish was able to be passed on, but
[8:22] it's just built in a certain way. His
[8:26] daughters are with us and their husbands
[8:28] today. We welcome them. Brother Tom's
[8:32] three sons are with us today and we're
[8:34] grateful to that. And to the family for
[8:38] their loss, but for their sacrifice that
[8:42] they've given to this gospel. We just
[8:44] trust that the Lord will continue to
[8:47] bless you and give you zeal and strength
[8:51] to carry on the great legacy that lives
[8:54] within you.
[8:57] I'm thankful for the Lord with all my
[9:00] heart and I'm trust today that each of
[9:03] you will reach out and touch the hem of
[9:05] his garment. Brother Michael, we
[9:07] appreciate that word yesterday.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. be
[9:13] um anyway just I don't know how to even
[9:16] to express it. It's beyond my expression
[9:19] how [music] wonderful it is. But we're
[9:21] going to worship this morning. Amen.
[9:23] We're going to lift our voices to the
[9:26] Lord. We're going to believe that he
[9:29] promised
[9:30] and that we have a book full of
[9:32] promises. Every promise in the book is
[9:36] mine. every chapter, every verse,
[9:40] [music] and every line. You reach out
[9:42] this morning and grab a promise. We're
[9:45] going to ask Brother Belly to come and
[9:47] lead us in worship this morning. Lord,
[9:49] richly bless you, magnify you, and lift
[9:54] you up in the precious name of Jesus, we
[9:57] pray. Amen. God bless you.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you come to worship this
[10:03] morning, man, why don't you turn around
[10:05] and welcome someone in the house of God
[10:07] this morning. Amen. So good to see all
[10:10] the smiling faces. God bless you.
[10:27] Amen. God bless you. May I have your
[10:29] seats?

[58:58] Amen. Amen. You love the Lord this
[59:00] morning. Isn't he wonderful?
[59:03] I love this scripture. I just thought
[59:05] I'd share it with you. It says is found
[59:08] in St. John the 4th chapter and the 16th
[59:11] verse. It says,
[59:13] "And we have known
[59:16] and believed the love that God hath
[59:21] [music]
[59:22] to us."
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. We have known it and we believe
[59:27] the love that God hath towards us. Isn't
[59:30] it wonderful to know that he loves you?
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Just think, he loves you. God loves you.
[59:37] [music] And if God be for you, who can
[59:41] be against you? John goes on to write,
[59:43] he said, God is love
[59:46] and he hath that
[59:50] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[59:55] God, and God in him.
[59:59] Herein is our love made perfect, that we
[1:00:02] may have boldness in the day of
[1:00:05] judgment, because as he is,
[1:00:09] so are we in this world. Oh, to be like
[1:00:14] Jesus. Amen. It's a great privilege.
[1:00:17] Seems like the meetings can come and go
[1:00:19] so fast, you know, and and all of a
[1:00:22] sudden you're at your last service.
[1:00:25] But it's just a time we have a
[1:00:27] fellowship together. I I try to have
[1:00:30] brother Tom down for
[1:00:33] every [music] year at this time and Mike
[1:00:35] and try to get brother Murphy to come
[1:00:38] too. It's just our time to fellowship
[1:00:40] with their congregation and their family
[1:00:43] and and they've been a blessing to us
[1:00:46] over the years, haven't they? Have you
[1:00:47] enjoyed the word?
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It it encourages to go
[1:00:52] forward. It lets you know that he's he's
[1:00:55] here for you and with you and he won't
[1:00:57] forsake you and he'll get you through
[1:00:59] every battle and every trial.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's one thing God can't do is
[1:01:04] he can't fail.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; He will not fail. He will not fail you.
[1:01:11] Oh, I hope that you just are are lifted
[1:01:13] up today and know that all things are
[1:01:16] [music]
[1:01:17] possible. We will we'll just get right
[1:01:20] into the uh word this morning and invite
[1:01:25] brother Tom to come and brother Tom.
[1:01:29] [music]
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you. Tom's a wonderful
[1:01:38] friend of mine. I forced my friendship
[1:01:41] upon him and him being a Christian, he
[1:01:44] had to accept it. So that's one thing I
[1:01:47] like about Christianity.
[1:01:50] Christians love the unlovable. Amen. So
[1:01:54] So I'm grateful for that. So you got to
[1:01:57] be my friend [laughter] whether you like
[1:01:59] it or not. You know, David.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; And so I'm I'm grateful for that. I
[1:02:04] We're all standing, but sister Joanne,
[1:02:07] his wife's here with him, and
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; we appreciate him. Brother Ed has passed
[1:02:11] [music] on and brother Tom has stepped
[1:02:13] into that role and God's been mighty to
[1:02:16] keep the work going and [music] and so
[1:02:19] we we have a lot of respect for him. So
[1:02:22] let's enter into the word today. I know
[1:02:24] that he loves you. He loves God's people
[1:02:27] and I know he's got something on his
[1:02:29] heart that will mend yours.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; It'll strengthen you. It'll give you the
[1:02:36] courage to look Satan in the eye and
[1:02:38] say, "Get behind me, light of hell."
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that, Brother Tom?
[1:02:42] Thank you. [music] Without fear, without
[1:02:45] favor, brother.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you. God bless you.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, nice to see you all here
[1:02:53] this morning. [music] My goodness. Can I
[1:02:56] Can I take a moment to look?
[1:02:59] Can I take because it does go so fast as
[1:03:01] the pastor was saying it goes too fast.
[1:03:04] Brother David, thank you for your love
[1:03:06] and kindness. I don't have to love him.
[1:03:11] I just love him. [laughter]
[1:03:14] It's okay, David. It's okay. Take a
[1:03:17] compliment, will you?
[1:03:19] And it's lovely to have my family. And
[1:03:22] of course, brother Ken, sister Linda,
[1:03:24] that meant so [music] much to me. Too
[1:03:26] much. so much to me and Marilyn and
[1:03:30] David. [music] David, if I a part of
[1:03:32] this service is because of you.
[1:03:35] Because he David I'll never forget
[1:03:38] Switzerland.
[1:03:42] Never forget it.
[1:03:44] Isn't it wonderful to love God's people?
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; And I mean,
[1:03:50] people have such a, you know, they're
[1:03:52] following their gods on the weekend.
[1:03:54] [music] They've got the gods of
[1:03:55] basketball. They got all these gods out
[1:03:58] there. Yeah. But we have a living God.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; A living God that is a life to us. It's
[1:04:06] a force. It's a It's a power [snorts]
[1:04:09] that [music] keeps us under his great
[1:04:12] wing. And I deem it always a great honor
[1:04:14] to be here with you.
[1:04:16] these November meetings. I don't know
[1:04:18] how much shelf life I've got left,
[1:04:20] [music] but uh the can is getting old
[1:04:23] and it's nice to see these new new ones
[1:04:27] rising up. It means so much to me
[1:04:31] because this [music] message is not a
[1:04:33] dead message. It is a living message.
[1:04:37] And I remember I got to go to old friend
[1:04:40] and brother Gary down there and [music]
[1:04:42] and his dear wife Barbara and Joel was I
[1:04:46] think 14 or [music] 15 and he's rolling
[1:04:48] around on your lawn and and here we are
[1:04:51] now and and they're old men like us. I
[1:04:55] shouldn't say that. Joan, [music] you're
[1:04:56] not old. You're not even 40 yet, are
[1:04:58] you?
[1:05:00] But isn't it uh just a tremendous
[1:05:02] weekend to fellowship and and [music]
[1:05:05] I so enjoyed the word last night? I I
[1:05:10] just said, "Hey, son, if you got part
[1:05:11] two, go for it."
[1:05:14] And it's uh it's just all together
[1:05:16] lovely and to [music] meet these dear
[1:05:18] brethrens behind here that have have
[1:05:21] supported brother David and they've
[1:05:23] [music] been faithful all these years
[1:05:25] and sons that love the Lord Jesus. and
[1:05:27] Billy meant so much [music] to me over
[1:05:30] the years. And I I just feel like I'm at
[1:05:33] home and sometimes I take too much
[1:05:35] liberty because I feel like this is my
[1:05:39] second home. And and [music] David and
[1:05:42] Sister Lesie have uh meant so much to me
[1:05:45] and my family over the years.
[1:05:48] It's hard to [music] articulate it. It's
[1:05:52] just from our hearts, we love you
[1:05:54] dearly. from our hearts. We love you
[1:05:58] dearly. [music] Well, I I have to change
[1:06:01] my a little bit here because um I don't
[1:06:03] know exactly, but I you did sing a song
[1:06:07] that I like, but I hate the title.
[1:06:12] Babylon.
[1:06:14] I mean, who on earth? Huh? Egypt. That's
[1:06:18] it. Who put Babylon? I hate Egypt. Also,
[1:06:23] [laughter]
[1:06:24] let's get it straight. Okay. Babylon and
[1:06:27] Egypt. In fact, at home, I think we
[1:06:30] changed the title to deliverance.
[1:06:33] [laughter]
[1:06:35] Would it be all right to sing that
[1:06:36] before we go to the word?
[1:06:40] [laughter]
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; All right. Help me sing it, would you,
[1:06:44] please? [music]
[1:06:49] Okay.
[1:06:52] The wonder [singing] of how you brought
[1:06:57] the [music]
[1:06:58] deliverance
[1:07:00] in the [singing] exodus of my heart.
[1:07:04] [music]
[1:07:05] You found me. You freed me. Help back
[1:07:09] the waters [singing] of my relief.

[1:08:42] [singing]
[1:08:45] You sent me to my E. [music]
[1:08:48] You took me by your hand.

[1:08:55] into the promised land.
[1:08:59] Now I will not forget [music] you. I
[1:09:03] sing of you now
[1:09:06] follow [music and singing]

[1:09:28] will not forget you. I sing [singing] up
[1:09:32] all you down [music]
[1:09:34] swallow forever

[1:09:48] victory. [music] Hallelu.
[1:09:53] Hallelu.
[1:09:58] [music] on the sea. You have led me to
[1:10:03] [singing] Hallelu.
[1:10:07] [music] Hallelu.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow and pray. Heavenly
[1:10:14] Father, you've done it all. You've done
[1:10:18] it all. It's all because of your amazing
[1:10:21] grace within our lives, [music] Lord.
[1:10:24] That seed that you dropped in there
[1:10:26] before the foundation of the world,
[1:10:29] Lord, is now manifesting [music] amongst
[1:10:32] the people in this hour. Lord, we love
[1:10:35] your children and we love the presence
[1:10:37] of the Lord. And we're just asking,
[1:10:40] Lord, that you'll take this little
[1:10:41] message this morning, feed the sheep.
[1:10:44] You're the great shepherd. Lord, we want
[1:10:46] to be led of your spirit. We're thankful
[1:10:49] for brother David and the men of God
[1:10:51] that have stood with him these years.
[1:10:53] God, make it a great lighthouse to this
[1:10:56] area. Lord, knowing, Lord, darkness is
[1:10:59] upon the land. But arise and shine as
[1:11:02] the word of God is declared, your light
[1:11:05] indeed has [music] come. And we're
[1:11:08] praying that the light of God will shine
[1:11:10] on your people this morning, Lord God,
[1:11:13] making your word alive to each and
[1:11:15] everyone. We ask it in the precious name
[1:11:18] of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:11:22] And I failed to mention my my wife, my
[1:11:25] darling. [snorts] She's down there
[1:11:26] somewhere. She's There she is. She's
[1:11:28] hiding behind somebody's head.
[1:11:31] There you are, darling. God bless you,
[1:11:33] sweetheart.
[1:11:35] Amen.
[1:11:37] Can you turn please to First Peter
[1:11:39] chapter 5?
[1:11:42] Musicians, thank you so much. I'm I want
[1:11:45] to get one thing off my chest right
[1:11:47] away. The brothers have given me a
[1:11:48] terrible complex.
[1:11:51] Um, somehow someway I seem to quote out
[1:11:56] of Christ the mystery of God revealed
[1:11:59] for the last 10 or so years.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; So, I just happen to have it. [laughter]
[1:12:07] I didn't want I didn't want anybody to
[1:12:09] feel bad. But it's one of the greatest
[1:12:12] messages
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; because for us that we say the seals are
[1:12:16] open, right? Then it becomes a almost a
[1:12:21] common statement. Uh the seals are open.
[1:12:24] But without the opening of the seals,
[1:12:26] you wouldn't even know what Christ the
[1:12:28] mystery of God has revealed.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said the message token
[1:12:32] should have followed the seals. So under
[1:12:35] the seals, the token message was
[1:12:37] preached. So anything under the seals is
[1:12:40] what I love.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; This it makes Christ alive to me. And
[1:12:47] so, you know, we might requle
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; just like you've never been in a service
[1:12:56] before. It's the first time you've ever
[1:12:58] heard the quote, the first time you ever
[1:13:00] heard the scripture. And you know, when
[1:13:02] the first time you heard it, there was a
[1:13:04] little bit of excitement inside. I don't
[1:13:07] know about you, I'm not a dead potato.
[1:13:10] I I'm I'm [laughter] something that just
[1:13:13] just likes a little bit of life there.
[1:13:14] You know what I mean? When there's a you
[1:13:17] did you anybody here read the seals
[1:13:19] before? Huh? You heard of the seals? You
[1:13:22] heard the seal. Of course, the fifth
[1:13:24] seal, huh? There's a little bit of
[1:13:26] stimulation
[1:13:28] with revelation, RIGHT? WE WANT
[1:13:30] REVELATION. NO STIMULATION.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Come on, wake up.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; If it's alive, it's alive.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; You don't want to make believe it. You
[1:13:43] just do it. That's right.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; You know, you take the air of the
[1:13:47] balloon and go. You don't have to make
[1:13:49] the balloon do it, does it? You know,
[1:13:51] you love the word, there's something in
[1:13:53] you that bubble ups inside.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; So, as let's just read before we get
[1:13:58] carried away here. First Peter chapter 1
[1:14:01] Peter chapter 5
[1:14:07] verse 6.
[1:14:11] Humble yourselves, therefore, under the
[1:14:13] mighty hand of God, that he may exalt
[1:14:17] you in due time,
[1:14:19] casting all your cares upon him,
[1:14:24] for he cares
[1:14:28] for
[1:14:31] I know it's not it's it's church, but
[1:14:35] it's class, right? He cares for who?
[1:14:39] This Bible was written to who?
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Exactly. So now the Bible says, "Casting
[1:14:46] all your cares
[1:14:48] upon him, for he carth for
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; me." He cares for you. Now
[1:14:56] church of the living God, if he cares
[1:14:59] for you once, he has always cares for
[1:15:01] you.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; He cannot uncare for you.
[1:15:06] God does not change his mind
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; about his word.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; I'm So I'm looking all the way to the
[1:15:13] back corner to that corner. Chris, where
[1:15:16] are you? Chris, there you are. It's at
[1:15:17] the door. All the way to the corners.
[1:15:20] All the way to the front. I want you to
[1:15:22] know he cares for you.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; Don't have no pity party, please.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Pity party is out in the parking lot.
[1:15:32] They'll have some teacups and some
[1:15:34] tables set up for you as you used to
[1:15:36] have.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; We're not a pitiful people.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; We're a people that God cares for
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; and he cares for you.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; And it has to be individual.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; It can't be, well, he cares for brother
[1:15:52] David or he cares for the deacons or he
[1:15:53] cares for the ministry. He cares for
[1:15:58] you very much so. He cares for you. Be
[1:16:03] sober.
[1:16:05] Be vigilant.
[1:16:07] Because your adversary, the devil,
[1:16:12] as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
[1:16:16] to whom he may devour. But you have to
[1:16:19] remember the scripture before that says
[1:16:21] that.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, the devil goes about as a roaring
[1:16:24] lion, but has already told you, I care
[1:16:27] for you.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Right. I I I already carry. So the devil
[1:16:32] goes about as a roaring lion. BUT I CARE
[1:16:34] FOR YOU.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; SO YOU TELL ME WHAT lion can get you.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Couldn't get Daniel.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Couldn't get Samson.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; You tell me can get you this morning.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; He cares for you.
[1:16:49] My
[1:16:52] whom
[1:16:54] resist steadfast in the faith,
[1:16:59] knowing that the same affections
[1:17:02] are accomplished in your brethren that
[1:17:05] are in the world, but the God of all
[1:17:09] grace, who hath called us unto his
[1:17:12] eternal glory by Christ Jesus,
[1:17:16] after that You have suffered a while
[1:17:20] make you unperfect.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Come just a second here.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; Makes you what?
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Makes you perfect, established,
[1:17:31] strengthened, and settled.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; That's enough to rejoice today.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Lift up your VOICE AND SAY, "PRAISE GOD.
[1:17:42] I WENT TO CHURCH TODAY AND KNOW WHO I AM
[1:17:46] IN CHRIST JESUS.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; But the God of grace who has called us
[1:17:55] unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus
[1:18:00] after that you have suffered a while
[1:18:04] makes you perfect. Can you please do me
[1:18:08] a favor and turn right and say you're
[1:18:11] perfect?
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Hey, Ally, turn. Come on.
[1:18:16] That was your left. Right's the other
[1:18:18] way. Right's the other way. There you
[1:18:19] go.
[1:18:24] [laughter]
[1:18:25] I I got it. I I I I get it. Okay. Now,
[1:18:28] turn left.
[1:18:34] That's amazing, isn't it? Change the
[1:18:36] whole atmosphere.
[1:18:38] [laughter]
[1:18:41] Change the whole atmosphere when you
[1:18:43] realize what the word of God says you
[1:18:45] are.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; You know, the Catholic Church will tell
[1:18:48] you this morning how rotten you are and
[1:18:52] you'll never make it. And here's a few
[1:18:53] indulgence for you and you might be out
[1:18:56] of purgatory in 5 million years
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; and you might make it to heaven. I got a
[1:19:02] prophet that says you've already made
[1:19:04] it.
[1:19:05] HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE ALREADY MADE IT.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A PROPHECY SPOKEN THROUGH
[1:19:16] MALACHI 4 TO YOU THIS MORNING. YOU'VE
[1:19:20] ALREADY IN GLORY.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; But it's HOW DO WE GET DOWN? I DON'T
[1:19:27] KNOW.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Maybe it's our flesh.
[1:19:34] But remember the roaring lion.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; But before the roaring lion was, he
[1:19:39] cared for you.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; He died for you. He rose for you.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads one more time.
[1:19:48] Father, we've read your word. We pray
[1:19:50] God that you'll take it now and make it
[1:19:52] alive to each and every one of us. Not
[1:19:55] just words that we hear on our ear, but
[1:19:58] Lord, may we hear in the inner man. We
[1:20:02] ask in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may
[1:20:06] have your seats.
[1:20:08] You thought I was going to have you
[1:20:09] standing, didn't you? Say, "Well, that
[1:20:12] preacher let me sit down."
[1:20:14] I'll let you sit down. But one thing we
[1:20:17] do love, we love the word of God. We
[1:20:20] love it in truth and purity.
[1:20:23] We don't like it manhandled. We don't
[1:20:25] want it our uh the mind of Tom Ray. We
[1:20:28] We've already been given the mind of God
[1:20:31] already through Malachi 4.
[1:20:33] Say what I say.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Don't. It's that simple.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; You don't have to add to it or take away
[1:20:40] from it. You just have to say it,
[1:20:42] believe it, and watch the angel of the
[1:20:44] Lord that backed up that prophet back up
[1:20:48] what you say.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; It's that that simple to me. And so this
[1:20:53] morning, I I really like to preach on he
[1:20:56] does care.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; He does care. A lot of us, we get into
[1:21:02] our own worlds. We get into our own
[1:21:03] families. We get into our own
[1:21:05] situations. We we maybe sit in a church
[1:21:08] this size and and we can get lost in the
[1:21:11] crowd and we can start to say, "Nobody
[1:21:14] cares for me.
[1:21:16] Nobody cares for me. Nobody acknowledges
[1:21:19] me. Nobody tells me how well I did at
[1:21:22] the the in the kitchen yesterday. You
[1:21:26] sisters were phenomenal.
[1:21:28] You were absolutely phenomenal. I loved
[1:21:31] it when I saw those plastic gloves. I
[1:21:33] said, "What? Where have we gone to
[1:21:36] pray over it and then you don't have to
[1:21:37] have pray?" [snorts]
[1:21:40] That's pretty dicey. I know I'm on the
[1:21:43] ice, but that's okay.
[1:21:46] But I don't mind your plastic gloves.
[1:21:47] But you did phenomenally.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; All you brothers that work so hard to
[1:21:52] make these meetings, you are phenomenal.
[1:21:55] And God cares because you didn't do that
[1:21:58] for your own self. You did that for the
[1:22:01] body, which the body is Christ. And you
[1:22:05] did a a great labor of love. You, the
[1:22:07] musicians, the choir, the singing,
[1:22:10] they're all special. I'm watching you
[1:22:11] there. And and I I'm I'm standing,
[1:22:14] Brother David watches me, and I'm I got
[1:22:16] my feet moving and I go, I want to go
[1:22:19] sing with them. [snorts]
[1:22:21] But you all did so fantastically,
[1:22:23] musicians. so wonderfully to make these
[1:22:26] meetings. And yes indeed, he does care.
[1:22:31] He hears the cry of the heart.
[1:22:35] [snorts]
[1:22:36] I just spoke the other night.
[1:22:39] Still real. It's always real to me.
[1:22:44] He heard and does hear my desparing cry.
[1:22:50] from the waters lifted me. Now safe am
[1:22:56] I. He cares.
[1:22:59] So you can look around and you say,
[1:23:01] "Well, I don't know this brother. This
[1:23:03] brother's never shaken my hand." It
[1:23:05] doesn't matter. I don't even know how
[1:23:08] that became an issue.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; You know, you go to a certain church, my
[1:23:14] church or our church, and and somebody
[1:23:16] doesn't shake your hand, they got their
[1:23:17] nose out a joint that far.
[1:23:20] and uh he doesn't like me and how come
[1:23:23] he didn't shake my hand and he's got
[1:23:25] something against and you fabricated a
[1:23:28] whole thing
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; and we do it all the time and we're all
[1:23:32] guilty
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; but let's just let's just drive that
[1:23:37] thing out of our lives
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; and say really it doesn't really matter
[1:23:43] because he cares
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; that's all he cares
[1:23:49] That's all that matters.
[1:23:53] We get it all built up and we want
[1:23:55] position.
[1:23:57] We want to be recognized. Who cares? If
[1:24:02] I'm the dormat of glory, I will be a
[1:24:06] very happy man.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; If I'm in the back parts of eternity
[1:24:10] somewhere, as long I'm in eternity, I'm
[1:24:13] a happy camper.
[1:24:16] I'm not looking for the left or the
[1:24:18] right seat or front seat, back seat. I
[1:24:21] don't care where I am. I just want to
[1:24:23] make heaven.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; But I've already been told I've made it.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; And so then it should just take all the
[1:24:31] worry away,
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; all the concerns away.
[1:24:36] Do you don't think that God can't pay
[1:24:39] your paycheck,
[1:24:41] your rent,
[1:24:44] your electrical bill?
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; You might not have a lot of money,
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; but he never will see his seed begging
[1:24:55] bread.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; You just got to take God at at his
[1:24:59] promise because he cares.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, boy, Tom, you're such a
[1:25:04] simple preacher." Well, that's all right
[1:25:07] as long as we live as high as we shout.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; I'm okay with that.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; I really am okay. I don't need to tell
[1:25:17] you how much I know. I don't know
[1:25:19] nothing.
[1:25:22] And we we spend five or four hours and
[1:25:24] the people are half asleep anyways.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Just don't fall asleep if I'm 45
[1:25:31] minutes. [snorts]
[1:25:35] I'm watching you.
[1:25:38] [snorts]
[1:25:40] God cares for you. He loves you.
[1:25:43] He loves He loves his redeemed.
[1:25:50] You saying, "How great is our God?
[1:25:53] How great is our God? But he doesn't
[1:25:58] care for my problem."
[1:26:02] It's just such weirdness.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Is that weird to you or is that just me?
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; You're saying he's awesome God.
[1:26:11] [laughter]
[1:26:12] He feels the heavens,
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; but he doesn't know my address.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; We have to get away from all this.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; It's growing up time.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; It's maturing time. It's wheat time.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; It's harvest time.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; It's a son of man coming back to son of
[1:26:36] man time.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a God we serve.
[1:26:45] My Bible is I'm sure your Bible is the
[1:26:48] same. It's King James. So
[1:26:52] says, "But my God shall supply some of
[1:26:55] your needs."
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; No, just a second.
[1:26:59] Some of you said no sir. Some of you
[1:27:01] didn't say no sir or nothing. I want you
[1:27:05] to say that's nothing but the truth. My
[1:27:07] God will supply all my needs.
[1:27:13] My God shall supply all your needs
[1:27:16] according to his riches and glory.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:21] [snorts] my another translation to help
[1:27:23] maybe somebody else that my God will
[1:27:27] liberally
[1:27:30] supply
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; and fill
[1:27:34] every need according to his riches and
[1:27:38] glory.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; So now you say, well, okay, now there's
[1:27:41] a huge spectrum here. We got young
[1:27:43] ladies that said, I want a man. I got
[1:27:46] young men men say, I want a lady. Just
[1:27:49] relax.
[1:27:51] Wow. I didn't get paid to say that.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; God has your bride.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; God has your bridegroom.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; You know the old song, matchmaker,
[1:28:09] matchmaker, make me. Yeah. Match.
[1:28:13] He'll make your match.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; And we thank God for that. He will
[1:28:19] supply all your need.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; My God will fill all your needs
[1:28:25] according to his riches in glory.
[1:28:29] Then you ask the question this morning
[1:28:31] on a Sunday morning. What is my need?
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; What is my cry?
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Now everything that we say, well, you
[1:28:40] got some young men said, "Well, I need a
[1:28:42] I need a fast hot car."
[1:28:47] Oh, come on.
[1:28:50] I need a I don't even know that the the
[1:28:53] thing 450 Hemi four barrel high eight
[1:28:56] barrel. I don't know what it is.
[1:28:58] But that car in five years is a bunch of
[1:29:01] junk.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; My need is him.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; We have to separate what the Bible is
[1:29:09] talking about. He's not caring about
[1:29:11] your needs as such. He's caring about
[1:29:13] your desire for him.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; You get him, you get everything.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY HAD NO FISH. 5,000 PEOPLE,
[1:29:25] BUT THEY HAD CHRIST.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; THEY GOT FISH.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; According to his riches and glory, then
[1:29:36] what is my need? I need him.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; I need to be. Brother Bram said,
[1:29:43] "Revelation." You need to pray more for
[1:29:46] revelation than anything else. You
[1:29:50] should pray for revelation more than
[1:29:52] anything else. So I ask you the question
[1:29:54] this morning, did you pray for it?
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, revelate me.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; I just don't want to know God in my
[1:30:02] mind. I need to know him from my heart.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; I need the revelation of God. And that
[1:30:07] becomes a coin word.
[1:30:10] I just need a revelation.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; It's deep.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; I need him to know him is life and life
[1:30:21] eternal.
[1:30:23] What an hour we're living in. What a day
[1:30:26] we're living in that's trying to take
[1:30:28] away
[1:30:30] all your desires that you have for him.
[1:30:34] That's what everything's designed. I
[1:30:36] don't have my iPhone.
[1:30:38] I did bring an iPad.
[1:30:41] I have a computer. I'm still I I'm not
[1:30:45] in the rock age yet. Still, right? I
[1:30:48] moved.
[1:30:50] But in technology and in anything,
[1:30:53] remember tree, good, evil.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; So there's good things and there's bad
[1:30:59] things. Just use it for the good things.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; That's all that we care for. God is a
[1:31:05] very present help in time of your
[1:31:07] trouble. 1 John 3 and1 says, "Behold,
[1:31:11] what manner of love the Father hath
[1:31:13] bestowed upon us that we shall be called
[1:31:15] the sons of God. Therefore, the world
[1:31:19] knoweth us not, because it knew him
[1:31:22] not."
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? So when you go
[1:31:26] work at a grocery store, they might not
[1:31:28] understand that you are an absolute son
[1:31:32] of the living God, but you are the son
[1:31:34] of the living God and you are a daughter
[1:31:37] of God.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; So now our actions are is what are is
[1:31:44] what confirms our confession.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Beloved,
[1:31:51] beloved.
[1:31:54] Now,
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; now,
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; so now you have to understand this Bible
[1:32:01] has been written for 2,000 years. And
[1:32:04] God knew that there would come a time
[1:32:06] when the full word would be opened up
[1:32:09] and the hearts of men and women that
[1:32:11] love their God, their Lord Jesus with
[1:32:14] all their mind, soul, and strength come
[1:32:19] to a completion or I would say a climax.
[1:32:23] Beloved,
[1:32:25] now we are the sons of God, and it does
[1:32:28] not yet appear what we shall be, but we
[1:32:32] know that when he shall appear, we shall
[1:32:38] be like him,
[1:32:41] for we shall see him
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; as he is.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Ah, okay. I'm slowing down. I'm slowing
[1:32:51] down.
[1:32:52] It's okay.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; I'll slow down.
[1:32:56] It'll maybe help some.
[1:32:59] We believe now we are the sons and
[1:33:01] daughters of God. It does not yet
[1:33:04] appear. But when it says when Christ in
[1:33:07] Colossians says when Christ
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; who is our life
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; shall appear
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; and brother Bram says he's appearing
[1:33:16] amongst us.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. I'm I'm only saying
[1:33:20] what he said. So when Christ who is our
[1:33:23] life shall appear, we shall also appear
[1:33:27] with him
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; in glory. And people say, "Well, that's
[1:33:32] when we're in glory." Well, look up the
[1:33:34] word that glory there. That actually
[1:33:36] means God's opinion of what you are.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; So when Christ appears,
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; there's a BRIDE THAT APPEARS LIKE HIM
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; IN HIS THOUGHTS.
[1:33:49] AMEN.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; And so God has a people that are
[1:33:52] literally called the bride of Jesus
[1:33:54] Christ that are going to fulfill the
[1:33:57] prophecy
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; that have been spoken of her.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon preaches a message.
[1:34:02] Michael alluded to it last night.
[1:34:03] Masterpiece. He fulfilled the Old
[1:34:06] Testament and all the prophecies
[1:34:10] concerning himself. So then he says,
[1:34:12] "Now in the New Testament,
[1:34:15] the bride part will manifest all the
[1:34:19] prophecies
[1:34:21] concerning herself."
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; So it's not a church member,
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; it's sunship,
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; it's daughtership,
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; life of his life,
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; spirit of his spirit,
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; nature of his nature.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; LIFE OF HIS LIFE. SHE'S HIM.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN. So now we start to understand that
[1:34:42] and we can make all these theories all
[1:34:45] about it. But what that's going to be
[1:34:47] proved is by your life.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; It's by your life.
[1:34:54] How you [snorts] walk, how you talk, how
[1:34:56] you act. How many of us How many of us
[1:35:00] and please I now I'm a pastor I guess.
[1:35:03] So tell me. So, Brother David, please,
[1:35:07] if I get out of line being in your
[1:35:08] pulpit, you just say Tom. That's for me
[1:35:11] to say, not you, Tom.
[1:35:14] How many of us say sharp things to one
[1:35:18] another?
[1:35:21] Sharp. I I I'm just I'm just I'm just
[1:35:24] get I I'm not even near where I'm going.
[1:35:27] So, how many have ever said something
[1:35:29] sharp to somebody,
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; you know?
[1:35:36] We all have. Come on. We all said
[1:35:39] something sharp. But now, let's just
[1:35:42] take a look at this. Did Jesus say
[1:35:45] something sharp?
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Okay, give me an example.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; He called the woman a dog.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; A dog.
[1:35:57] Ah, he called her a dog. But that was
[1:36:00] exactly what she was. That wasn't sharp.
[1:36:03] That's what she was.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's what they were.
[1:36:12] That's what they were.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; You We're get I want you to get the
[1:36:16] point.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Okay. That's what she they were and
[1:36:19] that's what she was. But that's not what
[1:36:21] you are.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; Here we go.
[1:36:29] THIS IS TOM'S LAST YEAR.
[1:36:34] THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. That's right.
[1:36:36] [laughter]
[1:36:43] Well, really, when we say, "Well, I want
[1:36:46] to be I want to be like Jesus
[1:36:49] to be like, you rotten scoundrel."
[1:36:56] Now, he did call the Pharisees snakes in
[1:36:58] the grass. Is that true? But that's what
[1:37:02] they were.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; But you're not a scoundrel. You're the
[1:37:07] bride of Christ.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; You're the beautiful bride elected.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Treat one another that way.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Act like that to one another.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Build up one another in the faith.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW WE ARE THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS
[1:37:24] of God.
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, an excuse is, "Well, that's
[1:37:28] my nature." Well, get a nature change.
[1:37:35] GET A NATURE CHANGE. Get born again.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:37:43] that's enough on that point.
[1:37:47] Every man that hath this hope in him
[1:37:52] purifies
[1:37:54] [snorts] himself.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; He doesn't need you to impurify him.
[1:38:01] How many knows their own problems?
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; It should be 100% here because I look in
[1:38:08] the mirror every morning
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; and I see Tom Ray.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; I know my problem. I don't need you to
[1:38:14] tell me my problem.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; We'll get through the opening scripture.
[1:38:24] We'll be okay.
[1:38:26] It's okay.
[1:38:29] What we need
[1:38:32] is to know who we are
[1:38:35] in Christ Jesus.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; The hour that we're living in, Jesus
[1:38:44] says, "The hour has now come. Father,
[1:38:48] glorify thy son that thy son might
[1:38:53] glorify thee."
[1:38:55] I can say to you that this morning by
[1:38:58] the same scripture, Father,
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; glorify your bride
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; so that your bride might glorify.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Exactly. [clears throat]
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:39:11] Glorify
[1:39:13] you. Knowest thou all things the
[1:39:16] brother, brother Brmond says, it's in
[1:39:19] him eternal life. Now we are the sons of
[1:39:22] God. Not we will be. we are now. Now,
[1:39:25] we're talking about 1952 when I wasn't
[1:39:27] even born yet.
[1:39:30] And he's preaching prophecy.
[1:39:33] Thank you, Brother David, for last
[1:39:35] night's closing because that's exactly
[1:39:37] what I believe.
[1:39:40] He was preaching prophecy in 1952.
[1:39:49] And now he's speaking and he's saying
[1:39:54] now we are the sons of God not we will
[1:39:56] be. That's what the trouble of it is.
[1:40:01] People you begin people that's born
[1:40:03] again. People call you holy ruler
[1:40:06] fanatic or something like that because
[1:40:10] you've been born again but you let the
[1:40:13] devil kick you around like a football.
[1:40:17] So when somebody says that to you
[1:40:21] said, "I am not that.
[1:40:23] I'm a son of God. I've been purchased by
[1:40:27] the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; I am not that. I'm a daughter of God.
[1:40:34] I am not that." Don't let the devil kick
[1:40:37] you around.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; 1952.
[1:40:45] Don't let the ka de devil kick you
[1:40:46] around like a football. You know what he
[1:40:49] says? Stand your ground.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Stand your ground.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; You're not a football.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; You're in Christ. That's what you are.
[1:41:01] Amen. Absolutely.
[1:41:05] You are in him.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Those that are born again are not a
[1:41:10] football.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; You're a son and daughter of God. And
[1:41:14] today we can say as now brother Brandham
[1:41:17] says in Christ the mystery of God
[1:41:20] revealed page 85 for anybody that wants
[1:41:23] to know. Brother Billy it says now we
[1:41:26] are the sons of God.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Not we will be
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; preached in 1963.
[1:41:34] Not we will be.
[1:41:36] We are
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; we are we're redeemed.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; And we have the devil's answer.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; GOD'S A VINDICATED himself in you.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; I love this.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; I love this. He's a vindicated himself
[1:41:55] in you.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; So now he preaches a message proving his
[1:42:02] word. So you say, "Well, that's a nice
[1:42:05] message."
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; But it's more than a nice message.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "You're the word."
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; I'm getting down to your address.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; You say, "You're the word."
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; I've been the I'm the word made flesh
[1:42:19] today. That's what the scripture says.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; So then God's going to prove his word.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; He's going to prove you
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; as the redeemed of God.
[1:42:33] Perfect.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Now we are the sons of God.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; We have Satan's answer.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; God vindicates himself. God proves
[1:42:44] himself
[1:42:46] in uh to his promise of this day. The
[1:42:49] headship is here. Christ,
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; he's the risen Lord. He's here
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; in the same power
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; as his resurrection.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; CHURCH OF GOD, SAY [screaming] AMEN.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; THE SAME POWER
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; THAT RAISED CHRIST FROM THE DEAD IS HERE
[1:43:13] THIS MORNING.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; GLORY,
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; SAME POWER,
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; SAME LIFE, same spirit.
[1:43:23] IF THAT SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED CHRIST
[1:43:26] FROM THE DEAD dwell in you,
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; does it dwell in you?
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; IT SHALL QUICKEN
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; YOUR MORTAL BODY.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; TAKE THAT, DEVIL.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; I AM NO FOOTBALL.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; I'M A SON and daughter of God.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; And he cares.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; He cares.
[1:43:52] Why? Because one day,
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; I cried out
[1:43:58] and he heard my desparing cry.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; You cried out.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; God saved you. But the problem of it is
[1:44:07] life complicates your simple salvation.
[1:44:11] Your salvation is very simple.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; But you've complicated it through life.
[1:44:16] And Satan complicates it.
[1:44:19] because of this and this and this, I
[1:44:21] can't have this and this and that
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; because you've got it all worked up in
[1:44:25] your mind.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; You worry about your sons and your
[1:44:29] daughters and and rightly so. I worried
[1:44:31] about my sons and my daughters. But
[1:44:33] there had to come a time when you had to
[1:44:36] rest.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Whoa.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; You had to rest
[1:44:42] and believe that God was going to
[1:44:44] deliver your sons and daughters.
[1:44:48] He said it.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; Ah, he said it.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Pam said in a token message,
[1:44:58] you're only asking what you are already.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHERE IS THAT RESURRECTION?
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; IT'S IN YOU.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE ONLY ASKING WHAT'S ALREADY IN
[1:45:12] YOU.
[1:45:17] MY THE CHURCH IS HIS FAILURE.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Matthew. That's
[1:45:25] exactly right. Paragraph,
[1:45:28] not paragraphed.
[1:45:31] It says at the bottom of page one, I'm
[1:45:33] at 85. It says the church is his
[1:45:38] victory.
[1:45:40] But the REASON WHY SHE SAYS VICTORY,
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; IT SAYS BEFORE IT YOU'RE JUSTIFIED.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; OH,
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; OKAY. SO, SO, SO, SO, SO, so
[1:45:56] justified.
[1:45:59] Justified.
[1:46:02] You never did it.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, WHOA,
[1:46:07] WHOA, WHOA. THAT WAS MEAGER. That was
[1:46:10] weak.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; COME ON. ARE YOU JUSTIFIED?
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; HAVE YOU BEEN BORN AGAIN?
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE JUSTIFIED.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; YOU NEVER DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE
[1:46:22] BECAUSE YOU NEVER DID IT IN THE FIRST
[1:46:23] PLACE. YOU ARE HIS VICTORY.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE HIS
[1:46:30] VICTORY. YOU'RE HIS VICTORY BECAUSE HE
[1:46:33] JUSTIFIED YOU.
[1:46:38] My
[1:46:45] is a glorious church
[1:46:49] and
[1:46:50] I am a member
[1:46:54] washed in the blood of the lamb. We know
[1:46:59] the song.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; It's because OF THE BLOOD.
[1:47:04] AND PEOPLE, LET ME JUST SAY,
[1:47:07] I'm sorry, saints. Let me just say this.
[1:47:11] The blood is not a chemical that's red.
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; It's the life in the blood.
[1:47:22] [applause]
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; So you say, "WELL, WELL, BROTHER TOM, I
[1:47:25] I NEED GOD'S LIFE." That's exactly what
[1:47:27] we need. Not a Baptist life,
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; cuz that will fail you. A Pentecostal
[1:47:33] life will fail you. ONLY THIS MESSAGE
[1:47:40] I I'M SORRY IF I'M STOPPING ON TOES.
[1:47:43] THIS MESSAGE IS JESUS CHRIST.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THIS [screaming] MESSAGE, THERE
[1:47:49] IS NO LIFE.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A THOUGHT. IT'S [screaming] A
[1:47:56] LIFE.
[1:47:59] THIS MESSAGE IS NOT, OH, IT'S A THOUGHT
[1:48:01] OF WILLIAM BRANDHAM. IT WAS AN ANGEL
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; THAT TOOK A BODY THAT SPOKE FROM GLORY
[1:48:09] TO TELL YOU,
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE JUSTIFIED.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I CARE [screaming] FOR YOU.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; YEAH. DON'T COMPLICATE IT.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; WELL, MY SON'S THIS AND MY DAUGHTER'S
[1:48:25] THAT. DON'T COMPLICATE IT.
[1:48:28] TRUST GOD.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; WATCH GOD MOVE ON YOUR BEHALF.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; He cares.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Cares.
[1:48:43] Do you care?
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; He That's what he preached. He cares. Do
[1:48:48] you?
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; If he cares, we should care, shouldn't
[1:48:52] we?
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. Absolutely. And God bless you. I
[1:48:55] know you do. What a wonderful message we
[1:48:58] believe.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You see, these people are trying
[1:49:02] to live a Christian life without the
[1:49:05] life of the blood.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; And you will fall on your face
[1:49:10] miserably.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; You will.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; But if you've got Christ in you,
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; this living word living in you, you
[1:49:20] cannot fail. The problem is, brother
[1:49:23] Bram said in Satan's Eden, I believe
[1:49:25] it's in one place, he said, "You're
[1:49:26] getting them to church and you're not
[1:49:28] getting them to Christ.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; We need to GET YOU TO CHRIST.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST." BROTHER KEN AND I DIDN'T
[1:49:38] EVEN KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE BLOOD. We
[1:49:40] knew nothing about the blood until Linda
[1:49:43] told him about the blood. K GOES, "WHAT
[1:49:45] ARE YOU TALKING about the blood? HE'S A
[1:49:47] GOOD UNITED CHURCH MEMBER playing in AN
[1:49:49] ORGAN WITH HIS LONG hair
[1:49:53] and knows nothing about the blood. But
[1:49:55] then the word comes.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Then the word comes. A seed is laying
[1:50:01] there and something happens
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; and it CHANGES SOMEBODY. IT'S NOT WHAT
[1:50:07] SHE SAID. IT'S WHAT WAS BEING LIVED.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[1:50:17] How great
[1:50:19] is my God?
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; There's power in the church.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, now, now hold everybody just
[1:50:28] just Brother Tom is a very simple man. I
[1:50:33] love my Bible and I love this message.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; I ain't going to give you Spurgeon.
[1:50:43] Uh CS Lewis,
[1:50:47] DL Moody,
[1:50:49] great men of God. And brother Brown
[1:50:50] called them great men of God. But what
[1:50:53] they had to SAY IS NOT WHAT'S going to
[1:50:55] CHANGE YOU.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; SO GOD SENT YOU ELIJAH.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; COME ON, [screaming] REJOICE WITH ME.
[1:51:03] GOD SENT YOU ELIJAH
[1:51:07] BEFORE THE GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY of the
[1:51:09] Lord. Amen.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNEW THE BAPTIST DOCTRINE
[1:51:16] WASN'T GOING TO DO IT FOR YOU. THE
[1:51:18] PENTECOSTAL DOCTRINE WON'T DO IT FOR
[1:51:20] YOU. THEIR FLUFF WON'T DO IT FOR YOU.
[1:51:23] BUT THE WORD HIMSELF.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM STAND THERE, HE
[1:51:29] SAYS, "I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE HIM my
[1:51:31] body for a temporal resurrection."
[1:51:37] Then you start to realize that wasn't
[1:51:40] William Brandom speaking
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; is I'm not dee I'll I'll clear that up
[1:51:45] to you right now. I don't do not believe
[1:51:48] brother Brandham was Jesus Christ but he
[1:51:50] was the microphone.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE MICROPHONE AND GOD USED THAT
[1:51:58] MICROPHONE TO TELL YOU YOU'RE A POWERFUL
[1:52:01] [screaming] CHURCH.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; DON'T LIVE BELOW your God-given
[1:52:09] standard.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; These are all statements you've heard
[1:52:12] over the years. But there comes a time
[1:52:15] when I was a child,
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; I spake like a child.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; But when I became a man,
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; I put away childish things.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Sticks and stones that hurt my bones.
[1:52:26] And words will NEVER HURT ME. LIES,
[1:52:27] [screaming] LIES, LIES.
[1:52:31] Sticks and stones may break my bones,
[1:52:34] but words never hurt you. Come on. Words
[1:52:37] really kill you.
[1:52:40] &gt;&gt; And we heard that since we were little
[1:52:42] kids. Words won't. And then we get eaten
[1:52:45] real snitty.
[1:52:48] Now we'll go back to [laughter] the
[1:52:49] little snitty. Well, who do you think
[1:52:52] you are?
[1:52:55] Now that hurt.
[1:52:57] Especially when you respected the person
[1:52:59] that said it.
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; So what happens that they don't get more
[1:53:04] respect, they get less respect.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; That went over big, but I'll let you
[1:53:09] think about it.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; So now we are here as Christian
[1:53:16] to build one another up
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; in the faith.
[1:53:22] And God put into the church apostles,
[1:53:24] prophets, evangelists, preachers,
[1:53:26] teachers for the edification and the
[1:53:29] build up till we all come into the unity
[1:53:32] of the faith,
[1:53:34] not divide the body.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; UNITE THE BODY.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:53:46] That's what power is in the church.
[1:53:49] She's controlled by a different law.
[1:53:54] And that law is not the keeping of a
[1:53:57] bunch of commandments.
[1:54:00] It's the law of faith.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Where Jesus said, "All things are
[1:54:08] possible
[1:54:10] to them that believe."
[1:54:14] Then we say, "Lord,
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; I believe, Lord,
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; all things are possible.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE THIS MORNING.
[1:54:28] YOU CAN have victory sitting right in
[1:54:30] your chair."
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. THAT CRITICAL SPIRIT COULD BE
[1:54:34] LIFTED OFF OF YOU THAT FAST.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW [screaming] YOU, SO I DON'T
[1:54:41] I'M JUST SAYING WHATEVER I'M SAYING.
[1:54:44] IT DOESN'T MATTER. WHATEVER IS ON YOU
[1:54:46] CAN LEAVE YOU THAT YOU COULD HAVE THE
[1:54:49] LOVE OF JESUS CHRIST.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT WILL MAKE YOU LOVE YOUR
[1:54:54] BROTHER.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Isn't that an oldfashioned song?
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Give me that old time. Huh? It will make
[1:55:04] you love your brother.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:10] [snorts]
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Don't look around like this now.
[1:55:15] Just surrender. Say, "Ouch."
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Ouch.
[1:55:22] And go on.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; You know, people live under this crazy
[1:55:25] condemnation business.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Just say, "Lord, forgive me.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I'm not Catholic. I I don't
[1:55:33] have a stick with beads on it.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; You said thought you bad. You said that
[1:55:40] bad. I am so sorry. You know what? It's
[1:55:44] already under the blood
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; and it's already forgotten.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, I would love to preach a message
[1:55:50] here. I preached it back home. Forgiven,
[1:55:54] forgotten forever.
[1:55:58] [cough and clears throat]
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that that that's Dylan. That was a
[1:56:00] good one. I really enjoyed that one. I
[1:56:02] should have preached that again. I
[1:56:04] really like that one. Forgiven,
[1:56:05] forgotten, forever.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Can you imagine?
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm sorry.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Where'd it go?
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Annihilated.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; Didn't he say once that confession hits
[1:56:24] the bleach?
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Did he not say that?
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; You brothers can confirm THAT ONCE IT
[1:56:30] HITS THE BLEACH, IT ANNIHILATES IT.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID IN THE BREACH.
[1:56:37] AND WHEN THE BREACH THEN WAS SPOKEN, THE
[1:56:40] BREACH THAT THE GAP THAT WAS BETWEEN GOD
[1:56:43] AND MAN WAS CLOSED
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE LAMB [screaming] CAME
[1:56:48] FORWARD AND CLOSED THE GAP
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; SO THAT WE COULD HAVE FELLOWSHIP
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; WITH our heavenly father.
[1:57:00] [snorts]
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my, you're making me feel pretty good
[1:57:03] right now.
[1:57:06] I I I don't know what it's called
[1:57:08] running the aisles or running the pews,
[1:57:12] but I got a pretty good idea. If I run
[1:57:13] fast enough, I could he hit each pew.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Until one of you put your
[1:57:18] arm out. [laughter]
[1:57:23] It It is amazing
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; when you start realizing who you are in
[1:57:28] Christ.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; And we sing the song. Maybe you don't
[1:57:33] hear, maybe you do. I can run through a
[1:57:36] tree and leap over a wall. Hallelujah.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; But if they say something wrong,
[1:57:49] [laughter]
[1:57:51] I can't jump at all. I'll trip and fall.
[1:57:55] I'll do one.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Ah, simplicity.
[1:58:06] You all right?
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; They told me I could preach two and a
[1:58:09] half hours.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; I won't do that to you.
[1:58:17] That's just I was just away preaching
[1:58:19] with Michael. We're overseas in Africa
[1:58:21] and the sister comes up to me. I'm in
[1:58:23] the car. I'm ready to go. She says, "You
[1:58:24] didn't preach long enough." I said, "If
[1:58:26] I preach too long," you'd say, "Why
[1:58:28] doesn't he be quiet?" [snorts]
[1:58:30] But if you preach short enough, you'll
[1:58:33] want me back.
[1:58:36] She really liked that one.
[1:58:41] Don't you love the Lord?
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE MOST PHENOMENAL TIME. AND
[1:58:46] IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M PREACHING. I ENJOY.
[1:58:49] HEY, IF MICHAEL COULD PREACH, Brother
[1:58:50] David could preach, Matthew could
[1:58:52] preach, David could preach. HEY, BILLY
[1:58:54] COULD PREACH, I'D BE AS HAPPY AS I AM
[1:58:57] RIGHT NOW. I'M probably happier,
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; you know. Oh, we got to go to church
[1:59:05] today.
[1:59:07] Really?
[1:59:09] I want to take my fishing pole and go
[1:59:11] fishing. No, I want to go to church.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; I want to go to church.
[1:59:18] &gt;&gt; My goodness. I remember when I lived for
[1:59:21] church. I remember when I used to live
[1:59:22] for church. I still do. I haven't
[1:59:25] changed. I said that wrong.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; But I remember missing my first service.
[1:59:29] Anybody remember missing their first
[1:59:31] service? If you can't, you never had Ken
[1:59:34] Linda on your case.
[1:59:37] I I was sicker than a dog. Honestly, if
[1:59:40] you I don't know what do that say means,
[1:59:42] but a dog could be sick probably. But I
[1:59:45] I when I get sick, my hair hurts.
[1:59:52] My air hurt, my hair hurts, my eyes
[1:59:54] hurt, every burn, and my body, my bones,
[1:59:57] and I'm laying there. I'm sick,
[2:00:01] but there's church. I couldn't hardly
[2:00:03] even roll over to get out of bed.
[2:00:06] And so I said, "Okay, I'm not going to
[2:00:08] church." So I lay there about two hours
[2:00:10] later.
[2:00:13] I can't get out of bed to answer the
[2:00:15] door hardly. So I get my Come on. Open
[2:00:18] the door and there's Ken and Linda.
[2:00:20] Where were you?
[2:00:23] I go sick.
[2:00:26] WE HAD THE BEST SERVICE BIBLE WAY HAS
[2:00:28] EVER HAD IN THEIR WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.
[2:00:32] You know WHAT I MADE? I MADE A
[2:00:33] DECLARATION THAT DAY. Never miss church.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Because that would be the best service.
[2:00:41] Huh? MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE I WASN'T
[2:00:43] THERE.
[2:00:45] I never just thought about that, Ken.
[2:00:49] But you know this is what we live for.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; It is really what we live for.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; AND GOD BLESS YOU FOR MAKING THESE
[2:00:56] special meanings so special. That's what
[2:00:58] we live for.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:04] The Bible says, let me show you a
[2:01:06] mystery.
[2:01:07] We shall not all sleep.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; He cares for you.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT GOING TO LET YOU DIE.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; COME ON. COME ON. THERE'S GOING TO BE A
[2:01:17] RAPTURE.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOING TO BE A RAPTURE. AND LET
[2:01:20] ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. IF YOU IF GO BY
[2:01:23] THE WAY OF THE GRAVE, you never died.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; You're sleeping. YOU'VE ALREADY GOT THE
[2:01:29] RAPTURE IN YOU.
[2:01:33] This concept of well, they passed away
[2:01:35] OR THEY DIED. THEY'RE MORE LIVING THAN
[2:01:37] YOU AND I ARE. BROTHER BISCLL IS ON THE
[2:01:40] HEELS OF GLORY RIGHT NOW SHOUTING
[2:01:44] PRAISES
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; WITH A PROPHET.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; BEHOLD, I care so much for you. I'm
[2:01:55] going to tell you a mystery. Behold, I'm
[2:01:59] going to show you a mystery.
[2:02:02] We shall not all sleep.
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But we shall all be
[2:02:12] changed.
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT ALL GOING TO GO TO SLEEP,
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE CHANGED.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; THAT MAKES ME PRETTY HAPPY.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS WHITE
[2:02:25] HAIR, BROKEN DOWN BODY. [screaming]
[2:02:27] NO MORE.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO see me skipping,
[2:02:30] shouting, running. I do that anyway.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; I just do it more.
[2:02:38] I'm going to show you this mystery.
[2:02:40] You're you're not going to all sleep,
[2:02:42] but you're going to all be changed in a
[2:02:44] moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at
[2:02:48] the last trump. For the trump shall
[2:02:50] sound, and the dead shall be raised
[2:02:53] incorruptible,
[2:02:55] and we shall be changed.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Can everybody say, "Amen."
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me just throw this in here.
[2:03:06] Who did Abraham meet
[2:03:09] on the way back from Lot fighting for
[2:03:13] his brother?
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; Who did he meet?
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Melazdc. And Melzdc gave him bread and
[2:03:20] wine. Communion. That's what you're
[2:03:23] having right now. You're feeding off the
[2:03:25] body word of the son of man. And God has
[2:03:28] given you A STIMULATION OF REVELATION.
[2:03:31] BUT BROTHER ARAM SAID ABRAHAM THOUGHT
[2:03:34] JERUSALEM WAS COMING DOWN BECAUSE KING
[2:03:36] MELZDC WAS THERE. BUT IN THIS DAY A
[2:03:40] PROPHET SAID WHO IS THIS MELZDC? AND
[2:03:44] MELZDC BEING HERE MEANS JERUSALEM IS
[2:03:48] HERE.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; GLORY. DON'T GIVE UP NOW. DON'T TRIP UP
[2:03:58] NOW. LET'S GET MORE HOLY. LET'S SEND
[2:04:02] SURRENDER MORE TO GOD. RUN LIKE we've
[2:04:05] never run before.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; How be it when he, the spirit of truth
[2:04:16] is come, he will guide you because he
[2:04:20] cares
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; for you.
[2:04:26] Cares for you.
[2:04:29] He'll guide you into all truth. For he
[2:04:33] shall not speak of himself,
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; but whatsoever he hear, he will speak,
[2:04:38] and he will show you
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; things
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; to come.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; How about with brother Brandham coming
[2:04:49] out of Finland and there's a little girl
[2:04:52] there. She's got crutches on and and and
[2:04:55] and and and she's trying to get to see
[2:04:58] brother Brandham, but there's soldiers
[2:05:00] all around. There's brothers all around
[2:05:02] him and and and and she and she bows
[2:05:05] before the prophet and she says, "Kitos,
[2:05:09] Kitos."
[2:05:11] Just grabs his coat and the brothers are
[2:05:13] pushing Brother Benham to the platform,
[2:05:16] pushing him. And the Holy Spirit shows
[2:05:19] him the vision.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; She's already healed. but she doesn't
[2:05:23] know it.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; She's already healed. Doesn't know it.
[2:05:27] So now he preaches a whole message and
[2:05:30] and and he says, "I want to shut it
[2:05:32] down. The prayer line's coming through."
[2:05:33] And the angel says, "Keep on going. Just
[2:05:36] keep on going. That's what I'm doing.
[2:05:39] I'm keep on going. THEY'LL GET IT.
[2:05:41] THEY'LL GET IT. KEEP ON GOING." AND ALL
[2:05:43] OF A SUDDEN, THIS LITTLE GIRL COMES AND
[2:05:46] Brother Brandham turns to the
[2:05:47] interpreter and says, "You say what I
[2:05:50] say.
[2:05:52] And I thought that's pretty direct. What
[2:05:54] else would they say? He says, "You say
[2:05:57] what I say."
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; So he turned to the little girl and he
[2:06:00] says, "God has already healed you.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; I SAW IT IN THE BACK ROOM, BUT I
[2:06:09] COULDN'T GET TO YOU.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; HE'S HERE.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; ELIJAH'S GOD IS WITH US TODAY.
[2:06:21] HE'S HERE.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; And you know what she did, Brother
[2:06:25] David?
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; She believed what the prophet said and
[2:06:32] she walked off that platform.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; Huh? She didn't listen to her doctor
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; who said, "Hey, you're going to have
[2:06:40] this problem all your life."
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother David, you cried out,
[2:06:44] ELLA. YOU CRIED OUT, "GIVE US ELLA."
[2:06:49] MOST OF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M talking
[2:06:50] about, but brother David knows that. I
[2:06:52] believe the same God that gave that girl
[2:06:56] that walking shoes is the same God that
[2:07:00] heard your faith WALKING THROUGH SOME
[2:07:02] HOTEL DOOR CRYING OUT, "MY
[2:07:06] GRANDDAUGHTER, [screaming]
[2:07:07] TOUCH MY GRANDDAUGHTER."
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; UH-HUH.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. And I believe ever since that
[2:07:17] day and I thought you know what I wish I
[2:07:19] had that bravery to do what you did and
[2:07:22] I'd have admired you and I've respected
[2:07:24] you and I studying away I write that
[2:07:27] down and I just put down there Ella
[2:07:30] believe for Ella granddaughter that
[2:07:33] needs a touch from the Lord in her legs
[2:07:36] strengthening of her legs and here is a
[2:07:39] grandfather way over in Switzerland
[2:07:42] believing for her granddaughter's total
[2:07:45] healing. She's a darling of the gospel.
[2:07:49] She's a darling. And I started thinking
[2:07:52] about that little woman, that little
[2:07:53] girl, Kitos, Kitos.
[2:07:58] God bless you, brother Brandham. God
[2:08:00] bless you. And he walks around and all a
[2:08:02] sudden he sees a vision. There she is
[2:08:04] totally healed. Totally healed.
[2:08:09] And he wanted to get back TO HER SAID,
[2:08:11] "JESUS HEALED YOU, LITTLE DARLING." He
[2:08:14] said, ' But the man kept pushing him
[2:08:15] back, pushed him back into the pulpit
[2:08:17] and he started to preach anyway, started
[2:08:19] to preach. Then the prayer line came.
[2:08:22] When she finally came, he said,
[2:08:24] "Darling," he turned to the count to the
[2:08:27] interpreter, "Say what I say." And
[2:08:30] that's what I say to the preacher man.
[2:08:32] I'll say it to me. Call him, "Say what I
[2:08:35] said."
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Say what I say and watch the people get
[2:08:37] healed. Say what [snorts] I say. Some of
[2:08:40] them are walking strangely, but they'll
[2:08:42] get up out of their seat. They'll walk
[2:08:45] in Christ. They'll stand in Christ.
[2:08:47] They'll believe IN CHRIST. SAY WHAT I
[2:08:49] [screaming] SAY.
[2:08:51] &gt;&gt; THERE WILL BE A CHANGE IN A MOMENT,
[2:08:54] [screaming]
[2:08:56] IN A TWINKLING OF AN EYE, BECAUSE HE
[2:09:00] CARES.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; He didn't call you to lose you.
[2:09:14] And that's why that's why I so burdened
[2:09:17] for you on on the first night. I want
[2:09:20] you all saved. I want you all born
[2:09:22] again. I want you to know him in the
[2:09:25] power of his resurrection because what
[2:09:28] you when you get that, you get all that
[2:09:30] I'm talking about.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; But we just I don't want you to go to
[2:09:35] church. I'm sorry if church is all your
[2:09:37] safety net. It's not good enough for
[2:09:40] you. But Jesus Christ, this living
[2:09:42] message, this living word,
[2:09:49] just believe it. You know,
[2:09:54] we had a brother one time when brother
[2:09:57] Murphy was just just in Iraq and God
[2:10:00] been dealing with the Arabic, Iranian,
[2:10:03] the Iraqis, the whole an amazing move of
[2:10:07] God that's happening over there right
[2:10:08] now. Just amazing, brother Gary. He'll
[2:10:10] fry your head. This brother, Brother
[2:10:13] Murphy, just got a text. We were in
[2:10:14] Ethiopia and his brother texts him and
[2:10:17] says, "Hey, brother Murphy, I need you
[2:10:18] to come to Iraq and I'm in a business.
[2:10:21] We're in a me meeting with all the
[2:10:22] translators and interpreters and
[2:10:24] everybody and we're trying to line
[2:10:25] everything up in Ethiopia and trying to
[2:10:27] do this, that, and everything else. The
[2:10:29] pastor's there and and Murphy's under,
[2:10:31] you know, I hate that."
[2:10:34] I go, "Murf, we're in a meeting." He
[2:10:38] goes, "It's okay. It's okay." So when
[2:10:40] Murphy says, "Okay, it's okay." and
[2:10:42] everybody else. Well, I don't know about
[2:10:44] that, but Murphy, he he's got it all
[2:10:46] together. So Murphy afterwards said to
[2:10:48] me, he said, "Brother Tom, they want me
[2:10:50] to come to Iraq." I said, "I don't."
[2:10:55] They said, "We want [laughter] you to
[2:10:56] come to Iraq." I SAID, "WHY WOULD THEY
[2:10:58] WANT YOU TO COME TO IRAQ?" HE SAYS,
[2:11:00] "Because we've been on FaceTime
[2:11:02] meetings, Mike, sort of video meetings,
[2:11:06] and these brothers are interested in the
[2:11:08] message." And they he said, "We we sent
[2:11:10] you a one-way. we sent you a ticket to
[2:11:12] come to Iraq. And Murphy texts back,
[2:11:14] make sure it's a return ticket.
[2:11:17] [laughter]
[2:11:19] That was very clever. I said, I wouldn't
[2:11:21] have thought of that. I'd still be in
[2:11:22] Iraq.
[2:11:25] So, he gets there and here's this
[2:11:27] brother that has been interested in the
[2:11:28] message. And Murphy being Murphy dumps
[2:11:31] the whole load about the message, the
[2:11:34] prophet,
[2:11:36] the opening of the word, the whole
[2:11:40] 1100 tapes, and in an hour and a half.
[2:11:43] [laughter]
[2:11:44] And and the fellow SAYS TO HIM, "I GET
[2:11:46] IT." Murphy goes, "No, he didn't. Nobody
[2:11:49] [snorts] gets it that fast." He says,
[2:11:52] "So he does it again." He says, "I told
[2:11:54] you I GET IT. GOD [screaming] SENT A
[2:11:58] PROPHET.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; You got it.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; So then then this gentleman always
[2:12:06] wanted to have a radio station. So he
[2:12:09] goes to the head of communication in an
[2:12:11] Arab Arabic, you know, Iraq and Iran and
[2:12:14] you know the whole situation regarding
[2:12:16] the Christians. takes Murphy there and
[2:12:19] God gives this brother a con or American
[2:12:23] or a station that we can preach the
[2:12:26] message on into Iran and Iraq.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; So I Googled where Murphy was and
[2:12:34] brother Brandham makes a me remember he
[2:12:37] says east meets west when west meets
[2:12:40] east in China east meets west meets
[2:12:45] east. He does that 10 times. But one of
[2:12:48] the 10 and says when west meets east in
[2:12:53] the Shinhar Valley and the Shinar Valley
[2:12:57] was where Abraham came from and where
[2:12:59] Murphy was. So the gospel has gone
[2:13:03] completely
[2:13:05] around the world.
[2:13:08] [applause]
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[2:13:15] GLORY. YOUR POPE, NOT YOUR POPE,
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; AMERICA'S POPE, [snorts]
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; CAME OUT OF AMERICA,
[2:13:24] &gt;&gt; prophesied
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; 1954,
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; A POPE WILL COME OUT OF AMERICA.
[2:13:30] &gt;&gt; AND EVERYBODY'S SAYING,
[2:13:33] "YEAH,
[2:13:35] did a pope come out of America?
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; He certainly did. Came right out of
[2:13:40] America." Is that not correct?
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; So now you got a pope out of America.
[2:13:44] got the gospel going around the world.
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Where are we?
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; Where are we?
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; Where are we?
[2:13:56] Incredible times WE'RE LIVING IN.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; OH, BUT YOU GOT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MR.
[2:14:02] TRUMP. If you hear this, I'm not saying
[2:14:03] this against you. I know you mean the
[2:14:06] best for your people, but you can never
[2:14:09] make America the golden age.
[2:14:14] I might as well preach to you, brothers.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; You want it. You want your jobs. You
[2:14:20] want your new cars. And you want your
[2:14:21] new house. He said, "I'm going to make
[2:14:22] America great again, and it WILL BE THE
[2:14:25] GOLDEN AGE." UH, that is from Solomon,
[2:14:28] actually.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Wrong person.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Boy, that really didn't go over so well.
[2:14:37] [laughter]
[2:14:40] Come on.
[2:14:42] President Trump, the best that he can
[2:14:44] do, is never going to bring you into a
[2:14:46] golden age. But I'll tell you, there's
[2:14:49] one man,
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; AND THE MAN IS CHRIST JESUS,
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S GOING TO BRING YOU INTO A
[2:14:55] MILLENNIUM.
[2:15:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:15:03] &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're going to a wedding
[2:15:05] supper, are we?
[2:15:07] And and and we've heard how many how
[2:15:09] many times we heard and he'll have a
[2:15:12] wedding supp.
[2:15:15] Have you heard that before?
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; I think you have. Be be humble. Say yes.
[2:15:21] Okay. Okay. So, we've heard it, right?
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; You try and find it.
[2:15:27] Actually, he says the wedding table will
[2:15:30] be
[2:15:32] a 100,000
[2:15:35] miles long.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Look it up. Fact check me. They all the
[2:15:42] kids do that anyway. [snorts]
[2:15:45] Thanks, Mike. Is it there? Oh, thank
[2:15:47] you. It's just so that you kids
[2:15:50] understand. The earth is over 24,5
[2:15:53] how many miles around? So a 100,000
[2:15:57] miles is over four times a round.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; So I went to AI. Sorry. Repent.
[2:16:06] AND AI SAYS THERE'LL BE 248
[2:16:11] million sitting at that table.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my. I didn't get an amen on that. I
[2:16:21] got a chuckle from
[2:16:24] brother Ben.
[2:16:26] Can you imagine
[2:16:27] a wedding table
[2:16:30] 100,000
[2:16:33] [clears throat] miles LONG FOUR TIMES
[2:16:37] AROUND THE WORLD 248 million sitting
[2:16:40] there I trust you have RSVP
[2:16:45] &gt;&gt; at the end OF THIS MEETING I WANT TO SEE
[2:16:48] ALL OF US HAVE AN RSVP
[2:16:53] AMEN I'VE ACCEPTED CHRIST.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE in his word. I believe this
[2:16:59] MESSAGE WITH ALL MY HEART AND I'M GOING
[2:17:01] IN A RAPTURE.
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; WHOA. I GO BY THE GRAVE AND I GO TO
[2:17:06] SLEEP. AND THOUGH I RAISE UP or get
[2:17:09] changed in the body, I've got a name at
[2:17:11] the table.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; That's not bad. Nobody asks, "Hey, I get
[2:17:18] parents coming to me. My son or my
[2:17:22] daughter are interested in soand so I
[2:17:26] don't have the money.
[2:17:30] Well, you don't have to worry about this
[2:17:31] one.
[2:17:34] 248 million [snorts] being able to sit
[2:17:37] at that table. And my Bible says he'll
[2:17:40] wipe every tear.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; That's my God.
[2:17:46] There is no God like my God.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; Does he care for you?
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; He absolutely cares for you. He sent a
[2:17:58] message to you in this sin cursed dying
[2:18:02] age that we're living in. To a people
[2:18:05] that you think that you're a nobody, but
[2:18:07] you're the greatest somebody that I have
[2:18:09] ever known.
[2:18:11] You are the bride of Jesus Christ
[2:18:15] purchased by the blood of the lamb and
[2:18:18] he heard your cry.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; And if he heard it and responded, he
[2:18:26] will respond again
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; and again
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; and again
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; and again.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; Hear the cry of the broken.
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; And I say he's heard your
[2:18:41] cry.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; We have an anointed word
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; that has been vindicated through Malachi
[2:18:49] 4.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; But there's something you have to start
[2:18:52] doing.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; Believing.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Now I'm just I'm getting wound wound up
[2:18:58] to to unwind.
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; If that makes sense.
[2:19:04] You have to prophesy.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah,
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry,
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; but you're going to have to prophesy.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Prophesy
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; again.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; So, as we were closing the service the
[2:19:19] other night, we had a young brother
[2:19:21] preaching and I I I he was preaching on
[2:19:24] faith. And I said, "But faith is
[2:19:26] prophecy.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; Faith is prophecy."
[2:19:30] So when Abraham
[2:19:33] was asked to sacrifice
[2:19:36] Isaac
[2:19:38] before he went to the mountain,
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; what did he say?
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; The lad,
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; and I
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; shall return.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; He prophesied.
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; Then John the Baptist did not KNOW THAT
[2:19:57] THE MESSIAH WAS HERE.
[2:19:59] But he was told that he would introduce
[2:20:01] him.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; So he prophesied
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; and said, "There's one amongst you.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; I'M I'M UNWORTHY TO UNLATCH HIS SHOES.
[2:20:11] &gt;&gt; BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD."
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; FIRST SPOKE IT.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; THEN GOD BACKED IT.
[2:20:21] &gt;&gt; SPEAK YOUR BODY CHANGED.
[2:20:28] Don't look at me.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Don't Please don't look at me. Speak to
[2:20:31] me.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; I claim my new body.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; I CLAIM IT.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; I CLAIM IT THROUGH THE BLOOD.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; HE CARES SO MUCH FOR ME. HE CALLED ME TO
[2:20:44] CHANGE ME.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:20:53] Praise the Lord.
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; So I'm casting all my
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; I know he loves me
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; redemption by
[2:21:11] the
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; love story. [singing]
[2:21:16] [snorts]
[2:21:23] That's
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; testify.
[2:21:29] My redeemer's no longer dead.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; And he's coming back for you and me. Oh
[2:21:40] my MY MY MY
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:21:45] [applause]
[2:21:45] Now people people got an issue. Let me
[2:21:48] just tell you, I know I'll be perfectly
[2:21:50] honest. I don't care. They're bunch of
[2:21:51] unbelievers. Oh, the cloud. It's a
[2:21:54] rocket. They need a rocket.
[2:21:59] They need a rocket to get out of here.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; But my prophet said
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; when he saw that cloud up there, THAT'S
[2:22:07] CHRIST UP THERE.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; I'LL TAKE A PROPHET OVER SOMEBODY WHO
[2:22:13] READS SOME SCIENTIFIC MAGAZINE. NO
[2:22:16] VINDICATION, NO NOTHING. BUT MY
[2:22:19] [screaming] PROPHET SAID, "THAT'S CHRIST
[2:22:22] UP THERE." [applause]
[2:22:26] GLORY.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; That's Christ
[2:22:32] up there.
[2:22:34] The same God that spoke to the woman at
[2:22:40] the well. The same God who's wondered
[2:22:46] are too many to tell the same God.
[2:22:50] pardon. [crying]
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Are you listening?
[2:22:57] &gt;&gt; Is
[2:22:59] &gt;&gt; that's
[2:23:08] you know I'm watching you.
[2:23:19] the same God
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; that parted.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; Is you know we we say Moses was 80 years
[2:23:31] old, right? So [snorts] let's say he's
[2:23:34] 81 [clears throat]
[2:23:36] and he's um
[2:23:39] leading the children of Israel out. And
[2:23:41] Miriam is what nine years old or 10?
[2:23:44] Let's say she's 90.
[2:23:46] Let's just say JUST SO NICE. ANYBODY GOT
[2:23:48] A tambourine here?
[2:23:51] I need a tambourine.
[2:23:54] Ah. All right.
[2:23:56] Here we go.
[2:23:59] Tambourine.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; 91.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; Now I'm not 91.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; I'm 71. But when she saw Pharaoh,

[2:24:34] SHE REJOICED. [cheering]
[2:24:37] SHE PRAISED HER GOD
[2:24:39] BECAUSE HER ENEMY [screaming]
[2:24:41] WAS DESTROYED.
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:24:46] &gt;&gt; GOD [screaming]
[2:24:47] CARES.

[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; YOU [screaming] WILL SEE THEM.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[2:25:29] [applause]
[2:25:35] God bless you. Thank you for for a
[2:25:38] wonderful full weekend. I trust the word
[2:25:40] of God has helped you and STRENGTHEN
[2:25:43] YOU. GO FORWARD IN THE FAITH.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; GO FORWARD LIKE YOU'VE NEVER GONE
[2:25:47] FORWARD BEFORE. ONWARD, CHRISTIAN
[2:25:50] SOLDIER.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:25:55] MAN, I like this thing.
[2:25:58] [laughter]
[2:26:03] Hey. Yeah, it does, doesn't it? Huh? AND
[2:26:07] THIS [clears throat] I I IMAGINE David
[2:26:09] when he was having the victory dance and
[2:26:11] the word was coming back. That's what I
[2:26:13] feel this morning. I feel the word's
[2:26:16] coming back. THE WORD IS BUBBLING IN MY
[2:26:19] SOUL. AMEN.
[2:26:22] HEY. IS MICHAEL THAT DIDN'T LIKE his
[2:26:25] dancing? Huh? She was the one and God
[2:26:28] closed her womb.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. So don't you say, "Well,
[2:26:31] Tom's getting carried away. I'll get
[2:26:34] carried away." COME ON, DAVE. I'M GOING
[2:26:36] TO GET CARRIED AWAY WHEN I GET CARRIED
[2:26:39] AWAY.
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; Put that down.
[2:26:45] [panting]
[2:26:46] God bless you.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause]
[2:26:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:59] [applause]
[2:27:07] God bless you.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; Very simple.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; You got to stop listening to the devil.
[2:27:34] You've got to stop listening to the
[2:27:40] liar.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; He's the father of all lies and there's
[2:27:46] no truth in him.
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; He said you never did it in the first
[2:27:54] place.
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:28:00] I never did it in the first place. Now
[2:28:04] the liar
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; has kept track of everything I've done
[2:28:09] wrong.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; Since I brought the duck in the bed.
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; He got it all wrote down
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; right.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:28:22] &gt;&gt; Every mistake. And all he wants you to
[2:28:24] do is listen to him.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:28:30] You want to know what he said?
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; Read your Bibles.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; Listen to the tape.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; Remember this.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; You can come to the altar
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; and you can pray and God
[2:28:50] it forgives you of your sins.
[2:28:53] But if you don't accept it,
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; you're going to get up from there,
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:28:58] &gt;&gt; You're going to go back to your seat. In
[2:29:01] five or six or 10 weeks, Satan's going
[2:29:04] to start telling you what a bum you are,
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; what a failure you are, all the sins you
[2:29:10] do, all the mistakes you have, and he's
[2:29:13] going to convince you you're not what he
[2:29:16] said you were.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Yeah.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; Where's the battle?
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; In the mind. It's in your mind.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:24] &gt;&gt; If God could give you anything better to
[2:29:27] fight Satan with, he would have done it,
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; What did he give you? His word.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; Go take Rising of the Sun.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; Go take the Easter Seal.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; Read those books.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:29:46] &gt;&gt; He said it's not laid to your charge.
[2:29:48] Right?
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; The seed of God was in you in the
[2:29:51] beginning. He put the wedding band of
[2:29:54] predestination on you over there
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; before there EVER WAS A STAR.
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; He saw you.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; Now, what do you believe?
[2:30:07] &gt;&gt; That's our problem. Our
[2:30:10] problems is we listen to a devil and and
[2:30:14] we come to the altar saying, "I'm
[2:30:16] praying, oh God, that the devil never
[2:30:18] speaks to me again. That he doesn't
[2:30:20] bother me no more. That he doesn't I
[2:30:22] don't want the pressure. I don't want
[2:30:24] the lies. I don't want all the things he
[2:30:27] does.
[2:30:28] He's not going to leave you alone."
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; I like what brother Mike when he read
[2:30:35] that scripture. be sent to wear you out.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; And the only way you can be refreshed
[2:30:47] &gt;&gt; is to go back and hear what he says
[2:30:50] about you.
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; And you've got to believe one or the
[2:30:53] other. I told the sister, you can you're
[2:30:56] there. You're you're predestinated. Your
[2:30:58] name's on the Lamb's book of life. You
[2:31:00] can either live happy or miserable.
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; But you're going to be there one way or
[2:31:07] the other.
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; God said he's going to have a bride.
[2:31:13] He's going to have a bride.
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; Nothing's going to stop it.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; And you know, two weeks ago, we sat
[2:31:23] right here and preached, "You are the
[2:31:26] children
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; of prophecy.
[2:31:30] And we preach you take what he said.
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; And that's the well man.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; And you walk into it.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; And you walk towards it and you believe
[2:31:42] it and it will come to pass.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Mike comes and brother Tom comes
[2:31:48] not knowing the thing we said.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; And they say the same thing. You are the
[2:31:53] children of prophecy.
[2:31:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're what brother Brandham
[2:31:58] spoke about.
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; And you look at yourself and you say
[2:32:05] that's impossible.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; I had to look at myself. It was really
[2:32:13] impossible.
[2:32:15] But you know, he didn't have to do it.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; But he did.
[2:32:22] And you'll never be able to take it away
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; because it was predestinated
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; You are not earning your way to heaven.
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; This whole thing's rigged.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; It's already been settled.
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; He's a redeemer.
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He came back to purchase his
[2:32:50] own.
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; Now you someday
[2:32:55] you're finally going to have to say,
[2:32:57] "That's me."
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:32:59] &gt;&gt; That's
[2:33:01] me.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; Who's the bride?
[2:33:06] &gt;&gt; It's me.
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; Does Satan make my flesh miserable? Yes.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; But does he have victory?
[2:33:16] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:33:19] That simple.
[2:33:21] &gt;&gt; This is one of the best singing services
[2:33:24] I've ever had.
[2:33:26] I' I've never heard preaching with so
[2:33:29] much singing in it in my whole in my
[2:33:32] whole life. I thought that's the kind of
[2:33:35] gospel I like.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; A gospel that let you know you're
[2:33:39] somebody.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of being beat down all the
[2:33:42] time.
[2:33:44] You know, every morning I open my
[2:33:46] covers, I look up and there's the devil
[2:33:48] saying, "Oh, another miserable day, you
[2:33:50] miserable skunk."
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; And I just sit there a moment. And I
[2:33:55] think, "Yeah, I'm a miserable skunk."
[2:33:58] But I'm a miserable skunk in God's
[2:34:00] hands.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to go out, Satan. I'm
[2:34:03] going to stink up your world
[2:34:08] cuz I I'm going to live for Jesus.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has he tripped me
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; lots.
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; Have I got up lots?
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; Is he going to trip me again? Probably
[2:34:21] so. Am I going to get up? Yes.
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; The race is over.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; The battle's been won.
[2:34:33] &gt;&gt; We're a finished work
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus.
[2:34:38] &gt;&gt; Let's go. Let our light shine.
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together. The
[2:34:42] musicians will come.
[2:34:45] Nick, I better give you.
[2:34:53] Don't worry, I won't turn into Isaiah
[2:34:55] Brooks. I I don't know how to beat one
[2:34:58] of these things. But anyway, give that
[2:35:00] to I think the sister that's yours is
[2:35:03] Sister Nikki. Amen. I want to sing that
[2:35:06] song. This little light of mine.
[2:35:09] I'm going to let it shine.
[2:35:12] &gt;&gt; Going to let it shine.
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; God can do nothing for you
[2:35:20] unless you first confess it
[2:35:26] right
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; now. I I can confess I'm a sinner.
[2:35:30] Prophet of God said if you keep calling
[2:35:32] yourself a sinner, you will [music] end
[2:35:34] up being a sinner. Right.
[2:35:37] &gt;&gt; But if you can say, "I'm a believer."
[2:35:41] [music]
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; I didn't make myself a believer. He made
[2:35:45] me a
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; I didn't see it. He revealed it.
[2:35:53] &gt;&gt; I didn't choose him.
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; He chose me.
[2:35:59] &gt;&gt; I can say that with all my heart. I did
[2:36:02] not choose him.
[2:36:04] He chose me.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; And he said that if he started the
[2:36:09] [music] work
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; that he would finish it.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; You say, "Am I finished?" No. I'm I'm
[2:36:15] not what I ought to be.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; I'm not what I want to be, but I surely
[2:36:19] ain't what I used to be.
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; I believe
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; I'm going to make it
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; cuz I believe that I've come from God.
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; And I go back to God.
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; So, how can you say that? The prophet of
[2:36:38] God said
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; in the word of God that I was in his
[2:36:42] thinking.
[2:36:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; How do you like this one?
[2:36:48] If you've ever had eternal life, you've
[2:36:51] always had it.
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; There's only one form of eternal life,
[2:36:57] and that's God.
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; And you were in him then.
[2:37:02] &gt;&gt; You are eternal.
[2:37:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; Well, it's hard to look in the mirror
[2:37:09] [music] and say, "You're eternal."
[2:37:11] Right?
[2:37:13] &gt;&gt; And you got this voice saying here,
[2:37:15] you're the you're this and you're that
[2:37:17] and you're a hypocrite and you're a
[2:37:19] failure and you got to listen to that
[2:37:21] guy.
[2:37:22] I have a choice.
[2:37:25] &gt;&gt; He said,
[2:37:27] "That settles [music] it."
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:37:29] &gt;&gt; How? I don't know.
[2:37:32] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to be there.
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to let that light shine.
[2:37:37] And I'm going to try to encourage you
[2:37:39] every service that I preach. Quit
[2:37:42] listening to Satan.
[2:37:43] &gt;&gt; All right?
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; Start believing who you are.
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:47] &gt;&gt; Perfect faith is when you believe what
[2:37:51] he [music] says you are.
[2:37:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus had perfect faith because he
[2:37:55] believed what the scriptures [music]
[2:37:58] said that he was.
[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; You can do it.
[2:38:07] I know of a man in the Bible.
[2:38:10] He just got to the place. He got so
[2:38:12] desperate. He finally looked to the Lord
[2:38:14] and said, "Help my unbelief."
[2:38:20] Believe, saints.
[2:38:22] Believe
[2:38:24] that you're [music] called. Believe
[2:38:25] you're chosen. Believe you're forgiven.
[2:38:28] I I just think the message that we've
[2:38:30] had this weekend to us is enough [music]
[2:38:33] to set our wings, don't you?
[2:38:36] You start testifying.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; People in the world don't know how have
[2:38:41] any hope. You're their hope. You're
[2:38:42] their light.
[2:38:44] &gt;&gt; You're their lamp.
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; You carry their salvation. You can
[2:38:50] impart it to them. You pack the words of
[2:38:54] eternal life. Speak the word. Watch
[2:38:57] people saved and delivered. Are you
[2:39:00] going to let your light shine? Oh, I
[2:39:04] love
[2:39:06] I'm going to let [music]
[2:39:11] my mind
[2:39:23] [music] shine. Let it shine. Let it
[2:39:27] shine. Let it shine. [music] Oh, listen
[2:39:30] that second verse.
[2:39:33] Oh, don't let shake and [music] blow it
[2:39:36] out. I'm going to let it. Now listen.
[2:39:41] [music] Don't let shake and blow
[2:39:44] [singing] it out. I'm going to [music]
[2:39:46] let
[2:39:49] Oh, don't let
[2:39:52] it out.
[2:39:54] Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it
[2:39:59] shine. Let it [music] shine.
[2:40:08] No. [music]
[2:40:16] No.
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it
[2:40:30] shine.
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, this little light of [music] mine.
[2:41:03] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I I'm real acquainted
[2:41:08] with Satan.
[2:41:10] Yeah. I've been walking with him for 76
[2:41:13] years.
[2:41:16] He lies to me every day.
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:41:19] &gt;&gt; And I know it going on in a lot of minds
[2:41:21] right now. [music]
[2:41:23] &gt;&gt; Satan's got all his list
[2:41:26] &gt;&gt; and he's reading it to you.
[2:41:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:41:28] &gt;&gt; You do this, you've got [music] this.
[2:41:31] You've got that. Pick one thing.
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; Not the whole bag. Pick one thing. Maybe
[2:41:40] one love story. Maybe one album. Maybe
[2:41:44] one game.
[2:41:47] Just go get rid of that one thing.
[2:41:53] &gt;&gt; Break that chain.
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; Get rid of that. Just one thing. Just
[2:41:58] take one thing. This is what I do. I I
[2:42:01] do this one thing. I have this one game
[2:42:03] I play. I'm going to go home and get rid
[2:42:06] of Sick Bird.
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; I think that's a game, didn't it? Sick
[2:42:10] Bird. Who'd want to play a game called
[2:42:12] sick bird when you're a well eagle?
[2:42:19] &gt;&gt; Just pick something.
[2:42:21] &gt;&gt; Pick something to give back to Satan.
[2:42:24] Satan, you give me this. [music]
[2:42:28] I'm I'm giving it back here.
[2:42:30] &gt;&gt; You take this thing.
[2:42:33] &gt;&gt; And then next week you give him
[2:42:34] something else and give him out. You
[2:42:37] just start unpacking his suitcase.
[2:42:41] and you just move them right on out of
[2:42:43] your house.
[2:42:45] You don't have to do it one trip to the
[2:42:48] altar. It becomes a life
[2:42:52] [music]
[2:42:52] of unpacking him.
[2:42:56] You get home one day and he's like
[2:42:58] Amazon. Satan's like Amazon. He delivers
[2:43:01] something to your [music] porch every
[2:43:04] day.
[2:43:06] You say, "Who's sending me all this
[2:43:08] stuff?" Lucifer,
[2:43:11] &gt;&gt; you know what you do? You unpack it.
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; You send it back.
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; You send it back with the postage paid
[2:43:20] by the blood of the lamb.
[2:43:23] &gt;&gt; And you send it back. You start
[2:43:26] possessing the gates of the enemy.
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [music]
[2:43:30] &gt;&gt; You start driving them out of your life.
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; That's who you are. You have to go into
[2:43:35] the promised land and you got to push
[2:43:38] him out of the promised land.
[2:43:42] &gt;&gt; You believe you can do that?
[2:43:43] &gt;&gt; I believe you can do it, sir.
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; I believe he's gave you the power to do
[2:43:47] it.
[2:43:50] &gt;&gt; I got no room for him
[2:43:52] &gt;&gt; in my life. We love you. We're going to
[2:43:54] have brother Billy come and lead us in a
[2:43:57] few songs of worship. And I [music] was
[2:43:59] told that I'm not good at leading
[2:44:01] worship. So,
[2:44:03] I need to turn it over to somebody who
[2:44:05] can, you know what I mean?
[2:44:08] And
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; uh I'm told I'm not good at preaching
[2:44:11] either, but I got to do something. So,
[2:44:13] you can either have me sing or preach.
[2:44:15] It's up to you. You vote on it.
[2:44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[2:44:18] &gt;&gt; Where you at?
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; Billy.
[2:44:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; I love all these brothers. Don't you?
[2:44:33] And uh let's let's go forward. Do we
[2:44:36] have a path forward?
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we've getting a clear
[2:44:40] vision
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; for what we want to do as a body.
[2:44:43] &gt;&gt; We want to share this word. We went our
[2:44:47] let our light shine and we want to start
[2:44:50] kicking the devil
[2:44:52] &gt;&gt; out of our lives and quit listening to
[2:44:54] him. [music] You watch what God will do.
[2:44:57] You can have what you ask for.
[2:45:00] &gt;&gt; That's the word of the Lord.
[2:45:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:45:03] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:45:09] &gt;&gt; All our visitors, thank you so much. And
[2:45:12] and those of you that come here, let's
[2:45:16] be faithful. Let's try to be at church
[2:45:19] all we can. And I'm going to get on my
[2:45:21] soap box.
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; Can I do that? Amen.
[2:45:25] &gt;&gt; Start coming to communion.
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; And foot washing.
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; Watch what it does for your life.
[2:45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, some glad morning.
[2:45:39] When this [music] life is over,
[2:45:42] I'll
[2:45:44] find way.
[2:45:47] Oh, and to [music]

[2:54:33] Blessed Lord Jesus, it's
[2:54:36] so difficult, Lord, at the end of
[2:54:39] meetings, Lord, to dismiss. It's hard to
[2:54:41] go our separate ways. It's hard to
[2:54:44] depart, Lord, from ones that we love so
[2:54:46] dearly. and we get just a few moments on
[2:54:48] this earth, Lord, to [music] be together
[2:54:50] and worship together. But Lord, we're so
[2:54:53] thankful that Lord, there is a place
[2:54:56] prepared for us, Lord. That Lord, this
[2:54:59] is only Lord, a moment where we'll part.
[2:55:02] But Lord, there's a place in eternity
[2:55:04] that Lord, we'll be able to sojourn.
[2:55:07] We'll be able to sit, Lord, for millions
[2:55:09] and millions of years together. Lord,
[2:55:11] we'll be able to share, Lord, all of
[2:55:13] our, Lord, our our stories, Lord, and
[2:55:15] how your amazing grace saved us, Lord.
[2:55:17] We we'll be able to spend time and time
[2:55:20] through into eternity together. So,
[2:55:22] Lord, this is where it's so important,
[2:55:23] these little times that we can be here
[2:55:25] in your presence to ensure us, but Tom
[2:55:27] said, let's make sure we have an RSVP to
[2:55:30] that table, Lord. And somebody, Lord,
[2:55:32] doesn't doesn't have that little, Lord,
[2:55:34] assurance in their soul. May they not
[2:55:36] leave these meetings. May they not go
[2:55:38] another day until they are so sure Lord
[2:55:40] that their their salvation and their
[2:55:42] calling and election. Sure. But Lord, we
[2:55:44] pray Lord as we would need to depart and
[2:55:46] go our journey and go home to our
[2:55:49] different places. I pray your presence
[2:55:50] would go with each one. Lord, as they're
[2:55:52] driving away, may they Lord be like them
[2:55:55] on Emmas, Lord, their hearts burning,
[2:55:57] Lord. Lord, knowing that you were with
[2:55:59] them, Lord, imagine that moment as they,
[2:56:01] Lord, pondered back and and thought, we
[2:56:03] walked all that time and he was with us
[2:56:05] and we we weren't aware of it until he
[2:56:07] revealed himself to us. But Lord, you've
[2:56:09] revealed yourself to us and we're aware
[2:56:11] that you've been with us all this time
[2:56:13] and we can go and our hearts burn and we
[2:56:15] can go to our different homes and Lord,
[2:56:17] just rejoice in what you're doing
[2:56:18] amongst us, Lord, and look ahead, Lord.
[2:56:21] Look forward and give us the strength
[2:56:22] and courage to press onward, Lord. Lord,
[2:56:25] I pray Lord you dismiss each one, Lord.
[2:56:27] Go with your grace with them, Lord.
[2:56:30] Lord, each one so precious. We love each
[2:56:32] one so dearly. Would your presence Lord
[2:56:34] overshadow us, Lord, we pray. Go in your
[2:56:36] grace and your love, Lord. In Jesus
[2:56:38] Christ's name. Amen.
[2:56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.
[2:56:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:56:44] &gt;&gt; Bless you with dismiss [music] this
[2:56:45] morning.
[2:56:47] I just [singing] got to tell you, Satan,

[2:56:54] line.
[2:56:56] [music]
[2:56:57] Cuz I'm covered by his blood. [singing]
[2:57:03] You may stand and you may [music] fight.
[2:57:07] You're going to lose [singing] this
[2:57:09] battle tonight. Because [music]
[2:57:12] remember
[2:57:13] you can cross without
[2:57:18] oh [music and singing]
[2:57:19] even though my spirit's fall
[2:57:23] and it seem I can hardly go [singing] by
[2:57:27] still I see
[2:57:30] victory. [music]
[2:57:35] Many times I'm walking by [singing]
[2:57:37] faith. I can't see what [music] lies
[2:57:41] before me, but still I see
[2:57:44] victory. [music]
[2:57:48] Oh, and I just got to tell you,
[2:57:52] [music and singing] Satan, you can't
[2:57:55] cross the blood line
[2:57:58] because [music] I'm covered by [singing]
[2:58:01] evil.
[2:58:05] Oh, and you may [music] stay and you may
[2:58:08] fight. [singing]
[2:58:09] You're going to lose this battle
[2:58:12] tonight.
[2:58:15] You can't cross [singing and music] the
[2:58:17] bloodline.
[2:58:20] Oh, sometimes [music]
[2:58:22] our lives get hard and they see we are
[2:58:26] fighting along. will remember [music]
[2:58:31] you standing on the rock. [singing]
[2:58:36] So Satan, if I
[2:58:40] turn [music] around and give up, too,
[2:58:43] cuz I do believe
[2:58:46] you're bound [music] to lose.
[2:58:50] Oh, [singing] and I just got to [music]
[2:58:53] tell you, Satan, you can't cross the
[2:58:57] [singing] bloodline.
[2:59:00] [music] I'm covered by his blood.
[2:59:06] Oh, you may stand, [music]
[2:59:09] you may fight. You're going to lose this
[2:59:12] battle tonight. Remember [music]
[2:59:17] you can't cross the [singing]
[2:59:19] line.
[2:59:21] [music]
[2:59:25] There is a source
[2:59:29] in times [singing and music]
[2:59:30] of need
[2:59:33] that gives me hope,
[2:59:37] that brings [music and singing] me
[2:59:40] in every trial. [singing]
[2:59:44] Through every [music] test
[2:59:48] my [singing] savior stands
[2:59:52] in mighty [music]
[2:59:54] faith.
[2:59:56] So the road to [singing]
[3:00:00] leave you [music] tight and warm.
[3:00:04] All your strength is gone
[3:00:08] and your heart feels [music] strong.
[3:00:12] Oh, remember God
[3:00:15] is greater than a [music and singing]
[3:00:17] stone.
[3:00:20] Taker is full.
[3:00:23] The battle is [music] alone.
[3:00:28] When the waters rise,
[3:00:32] he calls my name [singing and music]
[3:00:35] and he leads me.
[3:00:40] I'm on the [music and singing] way.
[3:00:44] of my heaven,
[3:00:47] lest I should [music and singing] falter
[3:00:51] and it makes me stand
[3:00:55] out on the water.
[3:00:59] When the Lord, [music]
[3:01:03] keep you tight and warm.
[3:01:07] For your strength is [music] gone
[3:01:11] and your heart [singing] feels strong.
[3:01:14] Oh [music] remember God [singing]
[3:01:19] and her sto
[3:01:22] [music and singing]
[3:01:30] when the water cries. [music]

[3:01:40] god. [music]
[3:01:41] [singing]
[3:01:46] He holds [music] my [singing] hand
[3:01:49] le
[3:01:53] and he makes me [music and singing]
