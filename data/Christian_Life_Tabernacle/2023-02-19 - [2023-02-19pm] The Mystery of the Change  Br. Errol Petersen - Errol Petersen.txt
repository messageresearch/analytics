Description:
The Mystery of the Change 
Br. Errol Petersen
February 19, 2023
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

healed oh God the backslider be restored the sooner be saved tonight be those who need another touch from you Lord may come touch our hearts father may you bless the reading of your word as we ask it in Jesus name amen amen amen get you all tonight in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ while we are staring at us just into the Book of Genesis chapter 18. we have a few portions of scripture we're going to read tonight very short verses Genesis Chapter 18 1-3 and also lower down 9-15 and then job Chapter 14 verse 14. and then First Corinthians chapter 15. 15 to 51-52 and Philippians chapter 3 verses 20 to 21. we'll read Genesis Chapter 18 verses 1 to 3. and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tender In the Heat of the day and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the chain door and bowed himself towards the ground and said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant they will read from verse 9 and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him now Abram and Sarah were old and well-stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of woman therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am wax old shall I have pleasure with my pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah love saying shall I of assurity bear a child which am old is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laughed not for she was afraid and said nay but thou didst love amen now we turn to Job chapter 14 and verse 14. if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come in First Corinthians chapter 15 verses 51 and 52. behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the Lost Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed the last scripture Philippians chapter 3 verses 20 to 21 . for our conversation is in heaven from winds also we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashion like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen so tonight as we are gathered for Fellowship around the word of the Lord I would like to speak on the story inspiration The Mystery of the change amen now as we read the Bible we find that the Bible is silent about the change of Abram and Sarah's body about them being young again and no one but Abram and Sarah was a way of the change and they were the ones who met Melchizedek the Bible does not outrightly say their bodies were changed and you know we are living in a similar situation today we had a visitation from God and he appeared in the form of human flesh and use the body of William Branham and you know Sodom was just getting more sinful the world was getting darker in that time it was on the verge of judgment but at the same time they were two people they were looking for a change to meet the promised son so these two things are happening at the same time and yeah the end time we find the same situation the world is getting darker and darker more sinful but at the same time upon the Earth there's a class of people who have met Melchizedek there's a people that is going through a change to meet the body amen that the sun the sun so you find these two things are happening at the same time so you're either on the side where there's a change taking place because the Bible says we shall be changed or you can be on the other side as we had this morning on the outside looking in going through the other change getting more sinful and going away Into Darkness the Bible says there'll be gross Darkness amen but at the same time there is light amen rise Shine for thy light is come the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee see so we find it was a mystery this end time visitation by Melchizedek but it took the profit of the seventh seal see it's silent about the the change of Abraham and Sarah but yeah at the end time we had a prophet and he came under the revelation of the seventh seal the silent seal he was the messenger of the unwritten word he was the one that could look read between the lines so it was not written that it happened and if we read the unwritten word it seems like strange I'm saying to you now if we read the unwritten word we can see that both Abram and Sarah they went through a body change so the seventh seal is silent it only says there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour it says nothing about the body change that the Royal seal of Abram would be visited by Melchizedek God in human flesh before the rapturing of the church so the silence in Heaven Must Be Connected with a change on the Earth because the Bible says there was silence in heaven and Revelation 10 brother Branham says is your seventh seal and it says I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his feet as well as a fire the problem is that is your seventh seal but at that time there was silence in heaven amen because while he's in heaven the Angels they worship day and night saying holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy holy unto the Lord but he's no longer there there is nothing to worship so there's silence in heaven so the activity is taking place on Earth he's now getting a bride together because thessalonia says the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and a trump of God the Lord himself and brother Branham says that shout is the living bread of life bringing forth the bride so she's manifested under the shout the living bread of life brings forth the bride and the voice is the voice of the resurrection and the trumpet gathers everything together and that the Lord does all three as he descends now in the message who is this melchized brother Branham refers to this angel now look at them down there in Sodom and there is their Messengers down there speaking to them that's Billy Graham and Oral Roberts but then where is that Royal Seed of Abraham because this message is giving a call to the Royal seed of Abram there's no other Mission upon the Earth but this message that is now being manifested to the Royal seed of Abram amen Gathering them together for the changing of the body to meet the promised son see where is their sign that he said as it was in the days of Sodom that God came down and was manifested in human flesh brother and sister we received a visitation from heaven we have been influenced by a heavenly visitation that's why we are what we are we are not like the world it's because of that one visitation from God veiled in human flesh and he delivered a message Amen to prepare Bride for rapturing faith that's the next thing in order I don't want to go ahead of the message but that thing is that's the next thing in order is the rapturing of the church we're not looking for great revivals or anything happening with somebody coming with a special message or whatever the next or in order is the rapture the changing of the body as we heard this morning he says here and he told Sarah was thinking back in the heart in the tent behind him the last sign before the Gentile world was to be destroyed by fire and the church listen the way the prophet says it and the church has got its lost sign it's happened see before the whole world is going to be destroyed this Gentile Kingdom be destroyed by the fire and the wrath of God do you believe that amen that Melchizedek was flesh represented himself in a human body and then later he was made flesh and now tonight he's the same yesterday today and forever so the one that represented himself in the human body the one that was made flesh is now taken in another flesh appealing to the Royal Seed of Abraham and wherever do you believe it he says who is this Melchizedek then that's the same yesterday today and forever never had no father never had no mother he never had no beginning of days he never have an end of life and he met Abraham and what kind of a sign did he perform then when he was made flesh he said it would repeat again just before the end time amen that's the god that we serve right there in the Book of Genesis you already could see in the future and when he came in the middle of the book as it was in the days of lot so shall be in the days when the son of man shall be revealed what is the son of man the word in human flesh the logo thing on the form in the hiding himself now before behind human flesh to manifest the Lost sign he says do you believe it now the appearing of that word or logos in human flesh was assigned to the Royal seat of Abram of the coming Sun they are now preparing to meet the coming Sun they must first be a body change before they can meet the promised son but before there can be a body change there must first be a spirit change by the appearing of God himself in human flesh speaking the promise like he did to Abram and Sarah you will have that son he didn't elaborate anything further he just said you can have the son he didn't tell him that their body is going to be changed he told him nothing because because everything they required to prove to manifest or to bring forth the promised son it was all in the promise so there will be a Rapture everything that we need for the Rapture is in the promise amen hallelujah so the promise of the coming son must happen in that order that is one principle that brother Branham taught us if he does something in a certain way in a certain situation when that same situation arises he's going to do exactly the same like he did it the first time so there was the appearing of Melchizedek he made the promise of the coming son you will have the son and immediately after that the body changed took place so Melchizedek has already appeared so we are living or we are with a promise that the prophet has left us amen so we find that the change starts when Melchizedek God in human flesh appears to the Royal Seed of Abraham so we find out that this is not just establishing churches but it's absolutely preparing a people for the rapture preparing a people to meet the promised son and that's what the fivefold ministry is all about brother Branham says God conditions the church the people to meet the promised son so every time you come to service you come for a conditioning to prepare you for to meet the promised son there's an expectation of the changing of our body amen but we find that dear brother and sister the question is did it happen in our day I'd like to read a quotation here with brother Branham says let me turn my back you pray the angel that appeared in human flesh had his back turned to the tent where Sarah was now who could speak like this other than the messenger amen and he told Sarah what she was what she did is that right that same Angel was God in other words God appeared you're in the last day the Lord himself he came in our midst to prepare Bride for translation faith he says yeah and and he told her what she did is that right that same Angel was God and the same angel that was there was promised by Jesus who was God and the same God that was there was promised by Jesus who was God to appear in the last days before the burning of the Earth just like he did in the days of Sodom remember Sodom was a gentile Kingdom we see the atomic bombs all getting ready tell Brian says watch Russia watch Russia amen so that's that's starting to to move but in the meantime the bride is making preparation there's a change taking place from glory to glory he's changing me from the Earthly to the heavenly his likeness His Image perfected in me the love that God shows to his bride so we must become more heavenly a Heavenly nature heavenly atmosphere a presence that's now with the bride of Jesus Christ amen so the prophet says here to my back in the message with Melchizedek there's a man sitting behind me he's contacting God and what is he wanting he has got a baby that's got heart trouble and the baby's got a murmur in his heart so the doctor said and that man's name is Mr Cox stand up Mr Cox and he told Sarah what she was thinking behind him was that William Branham no that was God coming using the vocal cords of William Branham and telling Sarah who was in the tent behind her just to show you that that what happened in Genesis Chapter 18 has come here at the end time just before the destruction of Sodom and gemara so he appears to the Royal seat of Abram and nobody is aware of the change accept the bride something is happening within us spiritually we are becoming more like him we are drawing closer to heaven there's a pool within us to draw it closer becoming more in the image of Christ so after the Lord's personal appearance and promise of the coming son to Abram the change was in process so immediately after Melchizedek appeared the change was in process because the word was spoken amen and that word was spoken to the heart of Abram and Sarah and that word was bringing about the transformation for the changing of the body to meet the promised son one day Sarah just looked at Abram she said honey do you realize that your shoulders are straightening out Abram told Sarah your hair is becoming black again Sarah looked at Abram and she says I notice your shoulders are straightening up you look like a young man again your ball patch has disappeared your beard is gone and these things are real things it's gonna happen you know now then I look in the mirror I see if there's any change taking place but brother and sister it's a promise it could happen any moment it could happen during the service it could happen after the service it could happen any moment the changing of the body Hallelujah and after the Lord spoke to them the drought hit the country and they got on a camel and they traveled for 300 miles to giraffe brother Brian says what a trip for an old couple he says they must have been changed Prophet says just wait till we get into our glorified bodies he says it's going to be marvelous can you imagine there will be no elderly folk we'll all be the same age Amen in the Splendor of Youth amen those who have no hair they're going to have a crop full of hair when you were at your best that is what the promise is with the Rapture I'm looking forward to that Amen to be changed in a moment so we find in Genesis chapter 17 verse 1. God appeared to Abram and it says yeah and when Abram was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect now brother Brandon says that God appeared to Abram in different ways in Visions in dreams but in Genesis Chapter 18 the Bible says the Lord appears let's read it and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day and he lived up his eyes and looked and low three men stood by him and he saw them and he ran to me there before the 10 door and bowed himself towards the ground and he recognized one to be the Lord likewise the Royal seat of Abram at the end time they'll recognize that one person who has the manifestation of the Lord at the end time will turn his back to the congregation Hallelujah now the prophet identifies the three men one Oral Roberts the other one is Billy Graham and the one has a name with seven letters which ends with h-a-m Ile amen he doesn't say William Brennan but you know you've got to get the revelation of who that one is but we find in Genesis 19 is a destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah now in Genesis chapter 20 verses 1 to 2 Abraham and Sarah went through a body change to meet the promised son amen now we find here that if we want to read it hypothetically or supposedly you know when Abraham and Sarah got to Gerard when Grandma and Grandpa got there at the place where they took their journey to with a little black cap on and a little thick in the hand bending over shoulder over the shoulders when she got there and this King was looking for a wife amen is a young man and here comes this old woman there must have been something he must have seen something amen this was not an old woman this is what the prophet says we know immediately after that he took a trip and went to Gerard is that right measured on your map 300 miles by camel quite a trip for an old couple like that Grandma here a little stick a little show she comes with Abram 300 and something miles down to zero is that right the Bible says they went down there and you know the strange thing it was after a little grandma and them coming down there and great great grandpa Abram long beard an old grandma with his little soul on her on her and the king of Gerald was looking for a sweetheart all those beautiful women all day around him he could have chosen any beautiful woman any woman he wanted and and when you saw Sarah he says that's the one I've been looking for all of my life amen the most beautiful thing in the world ridiculous nonsense she was a little she wasn't a little grandma God turned her back to a young beautiful woman again that's what he's going to do to every one of you in the rapture amen something to look forward to to be changed young again amen especially the elderly Folk amen we will really appreciate it because young amen can you imagine the king with all those pretty girls but when you see Sarah he said there's the one I waited for amen no Sarah was a beautiful young woman amen and and God changed her back to around 25 years old brother Branham says 25 years old now in Genesis 20 verse 1 after the change Abram said that Sarah his wife she is my sister an abimelech uh said and he took Sarah now the reason why he took Sarah he wanted to marry her but defined in a few chapters if you read it before Genesis chapter 20. Sarah was pretty when she was a young woman and Abram lied there as well when they went to Egypt and said tell them you are my sister and here we find in Genesis chapter 20. said it was changed back to a former Beauty again but Sarah did not only have a facelift Sarah had a body change she was made fertile in order to meet the promised son Hallelujah Sarah was changed back to a brand new young beautiful woman again Not only was she made beautiful but also fruitful and the king of giraffe fell in love with her and the prophet says don't use some of this year manicure you put on your lips or whatever it is you don't need that no you don't need that you need Jesus Christ he'll put it there permanently every desire amen he's going to put it there permanently one of these days hallelujah that's right don't Fashion After Hollywood out there Fashion After heaven that's what you want to do amen excuse me now the Bible says that the king took Sarah with the intention of marrying her he was going to prepare her now for marriage to be his wife as the prophet says you know he that night after he took his bath and laid in his bed he stretched forth his big feet on the bed he says Lord I am so happy you gave me a pretty girl ignorant of the fact that it was another man's wife Hallelujah but he was brother Brian says he was a righteous man while he slept that night the Lord came and told him you're as good as a dead man he said Lord but why am I as good as a dead man he said you got another man's wife with you God was protecting the bloodstream of the royal seed Jesus Christ was to come through that bloodstream and he was protecting that stream that's what we find that God protects the Covenant people we just commit ourselves to him then he takes care of the rest remember God said I'll be a god unto you and to your seed after you in their generation it's a covenant which God made with Abram and he said and brother Bradham says that the faith of Abram was not necessarily Isaac but he was looking forward to the coming of Jesus Christ and his faith was for the union between spirit and flesh amen and while John was baptizing him the Spirit came down and it came into the body of Jesus he says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell yeah him amen not yeah him just you know I'm well pleased to dwell and he went to Calvary in order to pay the price of our Redemption so that he could shed his blood to sanctify a church Pentecost amen the pillar of fire came and it separated itself and came into that first church on the day of Pentecost and the prophecies that were two thousand years the Holy Ghost was bound by denominational Creeds and dogmas the purifier was not seen for 2 000 years and after two thousand years the pillar of fire makes its appearance again Hallelujah that's why there could be no restoration without the return of the pillar of Fire because now it's going to be a union between the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride God dividing himself his attributes now in a many-membered body around the world with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost Christ the person of Christ now being united in a many-membered body in the bride of Christ universally that's why Pentecost they fell out by the way because they do not continue on believing the word they rejected the word so they rejected him amen so we find the king said you know the Integrity of my heart amen and she told me that was her brother and he told me that that was his sister and God said I know the Integrity of your heart that is why I kept you from sending me and God said I know you are a good man you are a righteous man your everything is just good but I'll not hear your prayers why because he was not in the promise of the Seed of Abraham you see this message this Covenant is directed to a specific seed all those that are in the Covenant that God made with Abraham so our message goes all the way back to Genesis to Father Abram amen and we find that angel Revelation 10 is a covenant angel with a rainbow upon his head he's coming now to the Covenant people those who made a covenant with God by sacrifice amen so we find that there's only one true faith upon the Earth today and the other ones is according to the Covenant that God made with Father Abram it goes all the way back amen brother Brian says once God makes one decision he cannot change his mind he's got to continue throughout the scripture and he promised to be a god unto Abram and to recede and to the seed after him in their generation see and yet we find a God-fearing man and God refused to hear his prayers you see because the Covenant was only between Abram and he said he said her husband is my prophet he was a liar and Abram was backsled because he left the Promised Land but he said let him pray for you my Covenant is with Abram Hallelujah so that shows where we stand as far as the Covenant God answers your prayer God hears your prayer because you are part of the Covenant that God made with Abram that's why this message reaches out to the seed of Abram nothing else amen it was displayed only Melchizedek was only manifested for the benefit of the Seed of Abraham because what happened to Abraham in Genesis happens to the Royal seed at the end time Hallelujah do you love the Lord tonight let's give the Lord a hand of Praise amen and the problem is that people who think they have done wrong that the Lord won't heal him that God is going to condemn them he says repent for what you've done wrong that don't mean that God has forsaken you repent and go on do you know it's only the bride of Christ that can really repent amen it's difficult for people to repent you get people coming to the service the call goes out nobody wants to repent it's only the seed of Abram those who are part of the Covenant they are the only ones that will repent they are the only ones that affected by the message of the hour because this message is directed to you Amen brother Brandon says in unconditional Covenant now a righteous man done nothing but he wasn't the Seed of Abraham he didn't a good man a God-fearing man but he wasn't the Seed of Abraham Hallelujah that's why Revelation 13 8 says and the Beast that was to come on the earth will deceive all those whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah see he says here it don't give you permission to sin remember that but what I'm trying to get this the fear knocked out of you you're always scared about something don't be scared God has promised God has got to do it if you believe it if you are the seed of Abram someone said to me like my Baptist friends used to say what difference does it make the one that went off into eternal security they said why it don't make any difference to me I'm saved glory to God I can do what I want to the prophet says that just shows that you not saved if you are saved you don't want to do those things those things such as dancing and God parties and playing and bobbing your hair and painting your lips and manicuring your face and all the things or attributes of unbelief that hurts Pentecost but that's what's good for you brother couldn't walk the old straight narrow path just like a hog going to its wallow and a dog to its vomit that's where the Pentecostal church has returned he says all right if you are born again the spirit of God will be a record that them things are wrong here there's got to be something here that brings a conviction there's no conviction because there's no Holy Ghost you can do it without any feeling any guilt but if the Holy Ghost is there it's going to keep you it's going to tell everybody that's wrong you shouldn't do that you shouldn't be saying that amen see you know that's true and here come your latter rain and scattering whatever it was and collaboration of woman and everything like that each of those Grace brother Branham says it's the works of the devil you owned you ain't going to love me after tonight amen you also love me after tonight amen but brother when I meet you at the Judgment bar I'm going to clearly be clean of the thing that's one thing sure I'm going to tell you the truth about it so God told Abraham not to leave Palestine and any person that disobeys God isn't a backslidden condition amen and any person who leaves the promised land of the son of man of the message of the hour is in a back slitting condition there is no promise outside of the message of the hour see when droughts struck the country instead of Abram facing the music he did exactly what God told him not to do and he backslid in his new body amen that wasn't his glorified body so this is a body that was so subject to go through the grave but he be excellent amen but God couldn't turn him down God made an unconditional Covenant with Abram this is my prophet take uh take his wife to him and if you don't you're as good as a dead man not the holier than thou priest or somebody you know that maybe was more Holier even than Abram but my Prophet out there let him pray for you my Covenant is between him and me the prophet said there's the grace of God to the Holy Ghost Church you don't recognize it the Covenant that God made with Abram and his seed after him we don't he says we don't deserve our healing any every one of us deserves to die there's not one of us that deserves to hear the gospel there's not one of us that deserves the grace of Jesus Christ we don't deserve to live on the Earth we are not deserving to look to God's creation but God has made a covenant with Abram and his seed after him healing belongs to us the Holy Ghost belongs to us salvation belongs to us amen and we are sitting in Heavenly places tonight nothing can harm us amen we are the seed of Abram and His blessings rest upon us so guarded to Abram and Sarah what he was going to do to the Covenant seed he was going to follow the same pattern so the last sign before the change come he appeared in human flesh giving Abram and Sarah the promise that was the beginning of the change that was the mystery of the change God appearing in human flesh because the next thing now was the changing of the body to meet the promised son listen to what the brother Branham says here I'm going to read a couple of quotations that you can see how that the prophet of God position he places us he says in the message Feast of the trumpets paragraph 302. God changed her body and turn them back it's a mystery that's to be revealed in this day by the son of man the evening message see turn back and that was the last sign they seen that discernment before the changing of the body so we're looking for nothing else but the changing of the body and before we can ever receive the Sun what happens The Trumpet Of God shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise first a new body and we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye Hallelujah and shall be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air listen the secret has been made known the seals are open the trumpet sound is for the Israel the two prophets is ready to appear what is it the church must get off the scene right now so that they can appear he can't deal with two at the same time he never did so the bride is was going to be taken off the scene amen she's got to be dismissed to the Palace before Joseph can make himself known to his brethren amen this is what he says in Jehovah Jireh paragraph 92. and that's the next thing in the order for the church the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for that for we shall be changed in the moment to receive the promised son where is he going to come down on Earth no up in the air and we don't meet him on Earth we couldn't meet him in these kind of bodies we've got to be changed and meet him in the air I really feel religious brother Branham says the body will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye you know how many times your eyes twinkle and you don't even realize it's just bad it's a twinkling of an eye and that's how fast you are going to be changed from from Mortal to immortality he says the next thing to the seed of Abram you are getting their lost sign a discernment just like it was in Jesus name that's the last sign to the church he says in Abram's Grace Covenant what's the next thing after his sign goes away God's going to condition you know I believe the prophet is inspired to use the words that he uses and I looked up the word condition what does the word condition mean it means to bring something into the desired state for use so God sent us a message to bring us into the desired state for a body change this message is our preparation from the change from Mortal to immortality he says Abram's children getting ready to receive the promised son agas appeared but now we are getting ready the change is in process amen so we don't just come to church you know for the second coming church but you are getting ready for a body change we are getting condition for the changing of the body how are we going to receive him we can't receive him in these bodies we are going to meet him in the air praise God forever the trumpet shall sound the dating Christ shall rise will go up to meet him in the air what's he doing the Lost sign before the Transfiguration the Lost sign before the rapture for most any time the atomic bombs are going to destroy the world seems like it's we are in that situation now at most any time the atomic bombs are going to destroy the world before it screams into the tapes Jesus is coming weaves are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those that are asleep for the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first he says movies are alive and be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye an old man will be young old woman will be young again and will be conditioned he uses the word again be conditioned to meet the promised son Glory Hallelujah the next thing in God's order what happens just as the angel had his back turned and showing that sign to Abram he brought everything down through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the placing of sons the gifts and orders to come out and then showing his lost sign law sign the peering of Melchizedek to the Royal seat of Abram and then changed Abram's seeds it might come before we close the meeting amen he says we all have to become Young man and woman again change why do we have to be changed it was totally impossible for that old man to have sexual relationship with his wife it was totally impossible for her to conceive and be a child if the supernatural taken place and the only way it could be done would be have to be a transformation amen let me just read this one he says Abram's Grace Covenant oh Church he will have to change this physical being to let us be caught up you must be changed to a body that will be caught up we first will see those that are asleep they'll have a resurrection and when we see them we are changed and we'll see who made it we didn't make it and then together we'll rise we'll meet the Lord in the air God's own son will be the leading one brother Branham says God tell us first be upon the Earth for a while see who made it who did not make it whatever but when we all rise together to meet the Lord in the air our Focus will be upon him God's own son will be the leading one in that meeting in the air he says yeah we're going to meet the Lord in the air we can go up like this we see every sign justification amen Hallelujah now we notice God's lost sign to Abram literally was God the word remember God the promised were that had been promised to him all along spoke to him in human flesh a man standing there talking to him Discerning the thoughts that was in Sarah's heart and her back behind him saying that the scripture even says the Bible said who was in a tent behind him yeah just to bring out at the end time he will stand with his back the man William Branham but he would discern the people with his back turn to Sarah a type amen and discern the thoughts of Sarah's heart that was the last I noticed he had before he had appeared to him in many symbols and so forth lights and fire and so forth but now notice immediately but he's doing to Sarah and Abram coming along this way just like he promised to do to the seed he's done it I can prove that just exactly the steps that Abram took now Luke where he's at here now when God came and talked to him in human flesh made himself hallelujah amen just to conserve time I'm going to skip a lot of things and I'm going to say how did the change take place since Melchizedek appeared to the Royal seed of Abram at the end time now brother Branham explains here in the message questions and answers exactly how the change is now taking place he says the first conscious this body would see tasteful smell and hear and it just got us all scrupled up we reason everything else but the new body that comes from the bone again not the first conscious it will pass away it's that inside something that lives everybody understands it see that attribute that was in God that little part of you that existed before it was a star a molecule or an atom is now become quickened within you that is where the Rapture is starting From the Inside Man he says here amen he said it's not this outside sea tasteful smell in here it's subject to death and will die see but the inside part of you down here inside that is the person that cannot die and that's the person that the New Life starts to form from from this new birth and it builds another person in the image of this person you are around that life you get it as Paul says my little children are travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you see so the mother baby forms inside the mother's womb then it's begotten it's just muscle it gets his body from the food and the mother feeds the baby she craves for certain things all in the development of the baby amen but then on the outside there's a spirit brother branches and the sweetness around that woman so as soon as that baby is dropped the two unite together and that's when the baby cries amen likewise Paul says when this Earthly Tabernacle of a habitation be dissolved we have another one waiting So within us Christ is being formed and it feeds upon the world that you feed on it makes you more into the word image changes you amen he says there's therefore no condemnation to those that are in Christ they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but that seed word made manifest is that part of you that wasn't there like a soldier where were you when I laid the foundations of the world when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy I wonder if I got that quotation here he says here um yes he says they shout for Joy when they saw the day that Melchizedek would come to the Earth to pay for our Redemption they saw the day when the Redemption would be prayed and will be brought back again to where we actually belong that's why we Rejoice at the ministry of the word because there's something within us amen we Rejoice that we are going back we are to our ought to be condition you see you're your first birth was because of the seed of your natural Earthly father amen but when you are born again is from your heavenly father and you are growing from more from days or today Christ is being formed within you amen so it's based on exactly the same principle amen he says here that um amen okay here it is I'm sorry I just okay here it is so potentially it's in here you're walking with the rapture in you it's already in process amen and what is it the word promised before the foundation of the world and around there this only reflects the negative that will reflect the process of the word see that's why it says that inner man brings us outer man into subjection to its nature you are a new creation you are a brand new man amen all things are passed away you are absolutely now governed by that attribute of God has been quickened within you see and the same thing or the translation of the Bride will be the same thing the word that's in you what's that word the attribute of God you know I like this message brother Brandon brings you from where you were before you are here now from where you were in the mind of God amen and he says God's thought of you and the Very thought that he had before the foundation of the world he presents that same thought to you in a word it is that word that brings you back amen you are identified with that same thought amen that's why it says when you recognize this to be Eagle food you have heard from your theophany amen hallelujah we should be the most happiest people in all the world for what has been made known unto us now we are the sons of God Amen he says here the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word and the same thing did by Sarah when that old body that she had that first body it had to be changed in order to produce a sun you get it that body could not do it this body cannot do it so it'll have to be changed the same way to receive the promised son so it's already now working within you there's a power that's bringing this body in subjection something in you that told you I must get to the house of the Lord tonight something that's pulling you into the presence of the Lord this world is absolutely dead but something has been quickened within you day and night you are walking with us it's a revelation it's a reality to you it's not a struggle to serve the Lord because you are all part you are the word made flesh today amen improving his word the prophet says the one man stayed behind that talked to Abram and he'd done a sign to Abram watch Abram had seen God in many great things see we believe that we don't we just before the coming son but before the sun was manifested there was a sign given unto them when Melchizedek appeared so Melchizedek might be just a beautiful sermon but to the seed of Abram it's a mystery that's been unfolded to us in this day that was the beginning of the change amen God spoke the word I would just like to read you you see when he said I'll give you a son you are going to have that son didn't tell them how it was going to happen I'm going to change your body I'm going to do this that or the other everything they require to manifest or to bring forth that son was in the promise likewise with the rapture there's going to be a rapture everything we require for the body change is in the promise this is what he says in closing just in closing now the second Resurrection first one is past the second one is at hand right now will come to your hand right now the third one is the two witnesses of Revelations 11 11 and 12. which are the two which are the ones that turns back with the spirit of Christ to witness to the Jews Like Joseph see there's your three raptures of the New Testament three raptures of the Old Testament all of them passed now we are already waiting for the rapture the Rapture of the Saints it's been spoken and so shall it be When God says anything all Heavens on Earth will pass away but the word will never fail so the Rapture is already in motion the change is already in motion it has been spoken so shall it be he says there when God said back then Genesis 1 let there be light it might have been hundreds of years before there was any light let there be a palm tree let there be an oak tree let there be a desert let there be a mountain let there be this he spoke it you see and as long as it went out of his mouth in a word it has to be manifested it has to be and one day you call these people out spoke to a man named Moses by a pillar of Fire a holy sacred fire see and the people who don't believe Moses so he said bring them to this mountain in that morning the mountain was full of fire and flashing and Thunders like that and the people says don't let God speak let's let Moses speak lest we perish and since that day God uses a prophet God could have spoken to us directly amen but the people says rather speak to us through a prophet he says he says and God said I'll not speak to them no more like this their problem is actually bringing us to a point where God is actually using him to speak I'll not speak to them no more like this but I'll raise them up a prophet and I'll speak through him and what he says will come to pass then you hear it because I am with him see now we spoke that he says that it would come to pass then he refers to Isaiah the prophet he says a virgin shall conceive I says what intelligent man would make a statement like that a virgin shall conceive amen because there's got to be a relationship but he just said it because the spirit spoke through him a virgin shall conceive notice brother Branham says Isaiah that intelligent young man standing there all at once the spirit hit him and he could say no different and he was a prophet he says Behold a virgin shall conceive child is born a son is given his name Shall be Called counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father his government shall be upon your shoulders the end there shall be no end to his reign how could that man intelligently say that a virgin shall conceive everybody looked for it but it's done been spoke it was thus saith the Lord it had to come to pass because it was God's word that's what we are dealing with me speak about the message of the hour it is God's word to us in this day see the same as it was in Genesis when he splanted them seeds down beneath the sea it was without form and void and the water upon the deep sea it had to come to pass and one day 800 years later the womb of a virgin conserve this conceive the seed of God a created seed she brought forth a son that same son stood there one day and said Lazarus come forth a man that's been dead four days rotten he's an Australian sunk he came forth said Marvel not at this for the hour cometh when all that's in the grave will hear the voice of the son of God so brother Branham said it's done been spoke voice of the son of man has already gone forth even those are in a grave of making preparation the views are alive on the earth we are also making preparation and the two amen will not hinder them but they will come first in the resurrection and we shall be changed and we shall be like them the prophet says it has to happen like that there is going to be a rapture there's going to be we are now in the change we are in the days amen of Elijah we are in the days of the body change we are in the days when at any moment there could be a changing from Mortal to immortality people who come up missing amen but we thank God for a message of the hour that is conditioning us for that moment see God wouldn't expect the Rapture and not giving you a preparation he's getting you ready uh the uh amen God is preparing us for the body change Hallelujah shall we all stand Hallelujah let's sing a little song from glory to glory he's changing me from the Earthly to the Heavenly his likeness His Image perfected in me the love that God shows to his bride amen from glory to his changing me his changing me changing me his likeness sent image to perfect in me the love that God shows to the world for his changing changing me from the Earthly things to the foreign [Music] the love that God chose to his bride [Music] from Heaven is an image to perfect in me amen [Music] amen isn't that the truth we're living for the Rapture yes amen I I like that just the whole understanding that the minute this messenger came the Rapture started amen he was calling that bride out if the seals were open because in those Thunders that sounded out in the seals it contained the rapturing faith and that's what that's what you're getting when you hear the word you're getting the rapturing faith so that's in like the prophet said this morning he said they couldn't recognize the part of the age that they were in the part they played in the Ager and do you understand what what it's all about you are created to fulfill the promise you were created for the Rapture and Satan is just out there trying to throw education civilization science he's trying to throw so many things in the picture you have to deal with he's trying to make you create some kind of great big puzzle you have to put together you don't have to put nothing together it's already taken care of you just have to what believe he didn't say did you understand it he said Do you believe it do you believe there's a Rapture amen do you believe it could be any day amen do you believe you're part of it amen amen that ought to be victory in itself huh that ought to be able to be able to tell you whatever Satan says you can give him the final answers Satan says well I'm going to take your life you say Satan I'm in a rapture Satan says you're I'm gonna you're gonna lose all your money you're gonna be Financial I'm gonna be in a rapture nothing he can do to stop it amen don't you think that's wonderful amen why don't we sing that uh a song uh because I think really it really where our thoughts ought to be on I'm thinking of a rapture amen when the redeemed are gathering in that's all we're waiting for right is to be gathered in uh we know what our Prophet brought us you say why the message he said because what the church world was preaching would not meet the challenge of the hour what the world preaches will not give the church what it needs to make a Rapture amen you you want to know what it takes to make a rapture he brought it to you in so many different ways in so many different sermons it's really the same thing every every time it's transforming the bride to the word the invisible Union of the Heavenly bridegroom in their Earthly bride uniting together in the thoughts of God that they think is one act as one live as one do you believe that amen oh I am thinking of the rapture [Music] [Music] gathering in the watch like snow and everything [Music] house [Music] Falls [Music] [Music] oh every day [Music] [Music] [Music] don't know [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] didn't Paul tell us he said if we didn't have this hope we'd be most miserable of all men but we're not miserable because this world can't hold us the grave can't hold our body down we are are going into Rapture and God's preparing you for it just think of it you could even have tried to run for it from it and he had reached out grabbed hold of you and started breaking you and molding you and he's going to get you no matter how bad the grip the enemy might have he'll peel that grip off and he'll set you free to take your vehicle anyway we know I believe brother Cosman and Andrew are leaving for a Tanzania tomorrow so uh we want to keep them in prayers they're going to go hold some Services there so brother cosmon once you come and dismiss us in prayer before you take off the the Tanzania anyway that's in eastern Southeastern Africa and we just ask you to bless us before you that's just all about our heads and just thank the Lord tonight for just his word coming forth and dealing with our hearts and now we just thank them for just Heavenly Father Lord we're we're just so privileged to just be able to stand before you tonight Lord and just thank you Lord we heard from the morning until the evening of how good your goodness is Lord the ordinance so much that you sent your only begotten son Lord to shed his blood upon that cross to be able to just come redeem us Lord as the Lord we're standing before you tonight just thanking you for this grace for this message for this Mercy that you've put Upon Our Lives Lord where we can discern the things and what the devil will try to throw our way Lord Lord where would we have been Lord if it wasn't for your Prophet to come and try to express the thoughts of God and just get us to know your truth and to know the way and to know what life is Lord and so Lord we're just so thankful that we had that light now Lord that we've seen it Lord we want to become it Lord Lord let us just not stand between these four walls but let it just take spirit and Truth within our life Lord that when we leave behind this building Lord we would be able to just testify Lord not only testify but be it but the preacher gospel Lord to the stores into the streets and everywhere we go to where we could be so sensitive Lord it is such a way that we would be able to search Lord and search for the right kind Spirit where we can bring him into your fall lord lord your sheep hear your voice amen and Lord you use that voice to your bride to be able to get her back to herself Lord and to her perfect condition Lord and so we just asked Lord even as we travel tomorrow that you just help us Lord that you be with us Lord Lord and that you just strengthen us as we're there just serving Lord and that you would just do Mighty things Lord bless our church bless our pastor Lord and all that he does for us and for the church Lord that you just continue to just Lord bless them with abundant Revelation Lord and to know where he lead us Lord and Lord the fields where we can eat Lord we just trust the people and all the Believers that came tonight Lord I pray that you just be with them be with them at work be with them everywhere they go and just let them be alive we just love you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen you know we know that we're not trying to convert the world right we're just trying to find the elect that are still in the world you're not going to change them it's been passed down they're not of the kind but we still have brothers and sisters out there and remember they're going to respond not to the nominal gospel of every other church on every other corner they're going to respond to the voice that God sent to change them that's what they're hungry for you'll never have to worry when you share this message Malachi 4 5 Luke 17 30 Revelations 10 7 the word that's come to pass in our day you can share it with somebody don't go by their outside don't care what they've got on them they got a bone in their nose you know it don't matter you know I'm not talking about some heat I'm talking about the United States do you know I mean they got it all over the place you know you look at people and you you know but you know what that's where Satan trying to cover that seed kind of pour that concrete on them go ahead speak the word of Truth to them don't worry how they look gotta transform them right he'll he'll take him from Darkness to light amen kill he'll take a Stony heart and turn it into a a heart of Flesh I mean there's nothing that God can't do and I thought as as Davey said this morning you know and I sure apologize if I made light of the word suicide in any way because it's it's terrible what the Satan's trying to bring to people [Music] Act of Hope that they're willing to end their existence and you have the only bridge between life and death to be God's hand extended to reach down to Fallen man you know don't ever count yourself out don't think I I I don't know the message very well you know the author that's what counts and they already see that there's something different about you you may not feel it you may not even look in the mirror and see it you might see that sinner that they see amen so don't hold back your testimony don't be ashamed of what you believe blessed is he who is not offended in me let him know God sent a prophet oh that's a cult well not to us it's not we go to work like everybody else does our kids play sports we go out to eat in restaurants we go to the job we we don't separate ourselves out of the world but we're not of the world amen let that light shine they'll look at you and they'll say you know what that's true God gave me a message to prepare me for the rapture and it's coming and the signs indicate us it's very very close amen let's press the mark let's do all that we can too really go that extra mile I just pray and ask God that that it's token time obedience to all the word of God it's the application of the token amen let's make this a real effort individually and watch us be joined together ever so strong as a body you love them that's saying this is our dismissal song keep our brother in prayer that he'll be with us for a little bit here and just trust the Lord continues to bless him amen thank you for the cross thank you for the prize I bless you are dismissed [Music] in love you came and gave amazing thank you [Music]
