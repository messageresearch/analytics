Br. Paul Ossou
Sunday Evening Service
February 2nd, 2025
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

for a moment I know that it will be a little bit difficult tonight but I'm going to try last time Brother David told to me that as a heaven citizen living in US you should be Tred to preach in English so I'm going to try but I asked to brother bu to be close so if if I'm not able to go forward I would turn to French and came to help me and it I think on I know one of brother here called me I think some weeks ago he oh my brother I saw you trying to pray in English now and Brother David want you to preach in English so I believe that next time you do it is in the home so he know what I'm talking about and on Friday I was fellowship with one of my neighbor will come here from time to time he's not here tonight and as we were fellowshiping about the word of God I said that um keeping pray if God can help me to start preach in English and he thought to me you know he said you know my wife is born on April 19 and I'm born in February 14 we're going to give you Psalm 1914 it can help you so I'm going to to read it uh Psalm 194 14 yes the Bible says let the word of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my strength and my redeemer so I believe that he going to give me strength to try to share some Fe God put on my heart for tonight for the communion meeting so we can stand and take our [Music] Bibles in the Book of Joshua josua chapter 1 we're going to read from from the verse 5 to9 there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fade thee nor forsake thee be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shall thou divided for an everything the land which I show unto the fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant command thee turn not from it to the right and or to the left that thou mayest Prosper with the so thou G this book of the Lord shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate there in day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shall make thy way spirit and then thou shall have good success have not I command thee be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee with the so thou go and we're going to take uh the book of Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians chapter [Music] 4 let's start by verse 11 and he gave some Apostle and some prophet and some evangelist and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the sent for the works of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God and to a perfect man and to a m of the Statue of the fullness of Christ that we as for be no more children those to for and carry about with every mind of Doctrine by the Slate of man and canning C tness whereby they lie and we to deceive but speaking the truth in love may go up into him in all things which is the head of Heaven Christ from whom the world body fitly joined together and compacted by th which every joint Supply according to effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body andto the edifying of itself in love Precious Jesus may you bless these words in Jesus Christ name we pray amen you may be seated I believe that the move of the Holy Spirit put in Brother David and all preacher preaching since the beginning of this year the burden to lead each one of us to the success and to have faith and we know that the success for Christian is to be born again is to have faith if to believe God in everything God have given to us in his word in the Bible and as you read in the Book of Joshua brother Billy tried to preach about it this morning that the success is not only to take the Bible but the success is in the message of the how and we knew that Joshua was a Believer we can say that J was a Christian but in the time of josua God Called Moses God gave his word to Moses God gave his laws to Moses mes and the only way Jos can have success the same God who call Moses was the same God who call Joshua but God didn't give another word to Joshua God asked to Joshua to stay in the word of Moses so for our time we know we don't need to proof with the Bible that the Moses of our time is brother BR we know that in our time God told to us behold I will send to you Elijah the prophet in the holy man God pointed to him him for us so if you want to have the success as Joshua yes sir the only thing we need to do is to keep the word of God to keep the message of the hour to believe everything God have given to us through this message and this can lead each one of us to the success because God deal with individual God deal with each one of us but if each one of us have Fellowship a really fellowship with God if each one of us believe God if each one of us because God has already give us give to us the power and the only thing we need is to have the faith to put it power in action we can have power but we need the faith the genuine Faith the faith Jesus had to put this power in the action and if we have faith we are born again we have the Holy Spirit we have the True Fellowship with God we will come to the fellowship one to the other it will bring us to the [Music] unity to be together and brother bam say that the unity bring more power and brother bam says in as the ego Ste up a n preached 59 August 50 15 paragraph [Music] 14 the one I'm say if you can put it on so we know that our success is in the message of brother Bram and brother says here that my Ministry is a Ministry trying to unite the body of Christ together his ministry is a Ministry trying to unite the body of Christ together not United denomination to one denomination but unit brothers and sisters as one group of people one in purpose one in art one in unity to see the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ so brother say that his ministry is to bring us together to bring us to have the same purpose the same Faith the same art till the coming of the Lord to see the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ so butam need us to be in the unity and you know um I would try to want belong even I want you know that I I couldn't belong with my English [Laughter] so but I know that while I'm speaking you are praying for me I know it and I believe that God can respond to answer to your prayer and help me to to move on uh so God want us to be one Jesus pray for us to be one in the unity that can help us to make many things and to be more power to be powerful but each one of us is different God make us different God gave different gift to each one of us but we are in the same body and each one of us as a part to play in a god syphony there's no one we are bigger than another one we are all brothers and sisters we are all Sons and Daughters of God serving for the same thing for the same purpose and brother butam say in the voice of the side preach 64 March 13 paragraph 32 it say you each one set in God economy just for its place one fast all the time and commune with God while another one cast out the devil because his one is fasting but it's the whole body of Christ working together the unity so you can pray and fast and B Billy will be cast out the devil because of your prayer you're playing your part is playing his part and we are all together in the same team in the same body you he say oh sorry one fast all the time and commune with God while another one cast out the devil because this one is fasting but is the whole body of Christ working together the unity when we see this denomination barrier breaking us up that W out my heart see because that's the thing that separate us we are one there is no big people among us no great among us we are all the same we're children of God there is only one one great among us and that Christ we must recognize him and if we seek honor one from another we can't have faith that's right because we having faith in one another we got to have faith in Christ is the one Among Us that we must have faith in and then faith in what is doing and has given to us I can remember Peter and John walking to the temple they was together we know the testimony in the Bible the Bible says that both of them look at the gu say look at us but only Peter we spoke we have no money we have no God but when we are speaking about his testimony every time we say Peter and John we never say Peter alone Peter and John because they were together in the same body working for the same thing the same purpose and brother say not the UN need like the world no I want to say yes God want us to be one and this Unity is not like the world like the unation like some groups in the world our Unity it around the world and the only thing we tie us together is Jesus Christ the word every time people try to be together to do something together without God it can't work we can remember nimod with the B Tower they try to build something together they try to have power together but without God and when God come he broke this Unity they have confusion in the language they were no more able to listen to understand one to other but at the Pentecost when people were together with God when God came Peter speaking in one language but everyone was able to understand in the own language right because God was in the midst God gave them his power so our Unity have to be around the word of God we have to go forward with god with the message and brother say in a total Deliverance pre 59 July 12th paragraph 7 it says to deliver paragra s yeah I was appreciating brother nille or brother B pray how he pray for the people and asking for help and mercy and if we just look along you always everything that goes on you'll find there's something real genuine about it and then when B come and B the Deacon and so forth up he to the platform to pronounce the blessing of God upon the church offering I hear him speaking in his prayer to God about those men how that they pray for one another and that those me and that that does me good to hear a pastor that can pray over his Deacon and the Deacon pray back for the pastor when you see a church going into corporation like that well something is fixing to move that's the way the church has to be in order and it give me just an idea for for a text I was going to speak on the blessing of cage and the refusal of the heing of the report of the spies but then I changed my mind to something else then can you see brother Bram have something else to preach but only when he he the pastor pray for the Deacon Deacon pray for the pastor it changed his seron it changed the C he was about to preach on so God want us to be one praying one to other not only in the church even in your home in your secret closet when you are alone I think each one of us have some prayer requests some needs and we if when we are alone We Trust we believe that God answer to our prayer so if God answer to I pray we can pray for every need we have we can take time to think about each one of us to think about a pastor to think about Deon trusty and bring every need to the Lord because we know that is able and faithful to answer and when we when we Pray when we are together in one Echo praying one to other God can make great thing among us as in the Bible we can read it in the book of Acts chapter 12 Acts chapter 12 we can start uh at verse 5 act 125 the Bible says Peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church into God for him Peter there wasn't the present but Christian brother and sister was praying without sing for him and when he would have B him for the same night Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers Peter was sleeping he was not praying Peter was sleeping Peter was sleeping Between Two Soldiers bound with two chains and the keeper before the door kept the prison and behold the angel of the Lord came upon him he was sleeping but the angel of the Lord came up Peter why and below the angel of the Lord came upon him and the light shineth in the prison and he SM Peter on the side and rais him rais him up saying he rise up quickly and his chain fell off from his hand and the angel said unto him go thyself and bind on thy sandal and so he did and he sa unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me and he went out and follow him and with not that it was true which he was sleeping yeah he was sleeping so he was not that it was true maybe he thought that he was dreaming but it was true which was done by the angel but th is saw a vision when they were past the first and the second world they come into the iron gates that leadth into the city which opened to them of his own Echo and they went out and passed on to one street and forth with the angel departed for him and when Peter was come to himself he said now I know of a surely that the Lord have sent his Angel and have delivered me out of the hand of aod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jew and when he had consider the thing he came to the house of Mary the mother of John was her name was Mark where many were gathering together praying I could be in bandage sleeping I can be tired I can be desperate but if you can pray for me God can send his Angel to me to help me the Bible don't didn't say that Peter was praying we know that the other side I think it was Paul and Silas in the prison they was praying and worshiping and the angel come but Peter he was sleeping but the prayer from brothers and sister send the angel of God to him to help him Amen to save him that's why God need us to be together to be one Echo to love one to other say in tting for Life preach 60 March 4th paragraph 167 say so it is have watch many time the W after the D and if he can catch a little D out of itself that the one they walk on there's the less if he can catch a de away from the head then that that's what the devil want to do so to you young young ladies he want you to go out with the boy that not a Christian to you young men he want you to go out with some little pened Jezebel that not a Christian that where he want you to break you up that where he want he want to he want to soak his teeth unto you and this little de will get out to itself away from the Earth that the one the world work on and do to you old men or women say want you to you old old men or woman when you separate yourself from Believers people say I can stay her home be just a good Christian some people say I can see at home and just be a good Christian as I came at churcham say you can't you can't it's B not but the PO people say I can't stay at home be just as good a Christian as a church you can't the Bible said not for sake our assembly ourself together and that much more as we see the time coming if you a Christian you long to go where other Christian are and fellowship with other Christian so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life you can't do it because it's like it's like I'm hungry but I'll never go to the to a table I just I'll never eat I just I'm going to do it see you've got to go and feed on the word of God and fellowship one with another we need one another more now than we ever did need each other is now when you get yourself single out from the rest of then making yourself just a little different you don't want to be associated with them because they believe and don't want to associate with them you getting on a dangerous ground right then keeping away from the church find the one of your choice and remain there and be a Christian brother to all of them that a way to be a real Christian and with God Fellowship protection people love people love you and pray for you when we are together where when we have Fellowship people love and pray for you I think we going to the communion service God bless you I think the communion is something we bring us together too so we're going to be together and have strength and may God help us to be in the unity of faith and bring God together Among Us in our meets so God bless you brother Billy can come I think I think I did longer than I I I think I did longer than I expect but God bless [Applause] you Hallelujah you talk about the Unseen made visible amen I I I so appreciate just the brother's courage you know you you think about standing up here you know and you know it's it's funny in the back you'll sit there and you you even forget what is it you wanted to say you know and to just come up here and and and be able to just speak in the language that you're not comfortable with and just be able to bring a message in such a beautiful way I I certainly applaud it let's just give him a hand of clap again say thank you [Applause] amen that that really blessed my heart that's what it's all about you know I I love it because you know God is not about the you know little you and big this one or God wants us to be United and and and as part of the fellowship it's not just one that comes you're coming to get something but you're also coming to give something you know we we can only give what we have and what the Lord has asked us to do it's never to do anything that we don't know anything about you know that's what the world will try to practice you know you'll try to practice to be good and everything no what God is really Desiring out of Believers is whatever was done to us we do to others there's been grace extended to us you come to church and you see one that's struggling there's a grace of God beating in your heart and you can look at them and say oh if God can extend the same Grace there's one struggling there's one in the difficulties and they having Maybe financial trouble or dealing with something you can remember a time where you were in that same boat and you can go and pray now you ministering now it's really life it's not just words it's you knowing exactly what is it that you're giving and I believe that's why the word the the God puts a body together is so we can Minister one to another and I've always said this you know even as our pastor will say there are no Schism in the body there's no unused or uh uh unuseful member and I'll tell you this each one plays a role each one has a role to play you may come there and sit there and Sunday after Sunday Wednesday after Wednesday and think oh nobody cares nobody sees me let me say this the day you're going to be missing we're going to know you're not here our presence here plays a role we we are part of a greater thing and we bring together something to to strengthen one another each one supplying for the need of the body by Your Presence by your prayers as we heard and by all things and I like that you know God comes and he's showing that you know one was sleeping yes is Peter just fallen asleep completely and God is working over the other side with the brothers that were in an intercession for him you know so it means we are really whatever you can do if you can pray for one God is behind that he's doing something your prayers are not stuck in the ceiling they they're reaching heaven and God is working behind the scenes and and so I certainly appreciate that let's all stand and you know we're going to read uh communion scripture at this time and uh we'll ask the brothers to go and get ready for uh communion let's turn our Bibles in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 we're going to read from verse the 23rd verse he said for I have received of the Lord that which I have also delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and where he had given thanks he Breo it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you do this this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner he also took the cup and when he had stopped saying this cup is a new testony in my in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come it says wherefore whatsoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let him every man examine himself so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eaten and drinking damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasten of of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat t one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that he may not come together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come amen and let's just bow our heads and pray together our gracious father we bring this communion table before you father we do this in remembrance of you as we read in the Bible and father I even as for one for myself I can say father I've always find comfort in communion because you said that it's for our strength lord it's for the body so we could be strengthened it's our closeness father this is our fellowship as our brother preached father and I'm so thankful that we know that there's healing in commun communion there's salvation in communion there's Deliverance in communion father as we eat it as we take this Lord we are not walking backwards we're walking forward in fellowship with you we are strengthened we become one we become stronger we can do greater things together in communion why because that's the way you've ordained it that we can come and eat of this and be strengthened Lord and be one all together so now we ask that you breast the bre bread Lord which is the representation of your body Lord that was given Lord the very bread the bread of life Lord that would eat Lord and become stronger it will give us the nutrients and the things that we need spiritually Lord to be stronger and the wine Father which is the very stimulation of Revelation father that it would be the lifeline of our body Lord that we would know that we have drink of the blood of the Lord Jesus in representation and be strengthened by it we ask father that you just come and for each hand that would be extended in this plate Lord I pray father that your blessings may follow Lord and father that they not be they not be one Among Us that would eat and be condemned but we all eat for the blessings of what you promise we will receive we commit this moment to you and we ask it in the Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen man you may be seated and if the musicians could come man you just come and you do as we've always done when you're ready you just come and and take communion amen God bless you man don't forget you can come in two lines so
