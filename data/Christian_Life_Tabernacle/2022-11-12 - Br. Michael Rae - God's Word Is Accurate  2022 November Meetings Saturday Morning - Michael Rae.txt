Description:
God's Word Is Accurate
Br. Michael Rae
November 12, 2022
2022 November Meetings: Saturday Morning
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

care of it all and as we heard last night Lord if that Spirit of unbelief can just be broken we sit right now in the Realms where all things are possible if we can just believe Lord father as the word went forth and was ministered the bride's moment Lord May that not Escape us may we refocus to realize this is our moment Lord I'm reminded of when brother Ed made that call to brother Ron he said

all that and they'd some God of stone and some God of wood but there was a people that could say um my God rained I know what you believe but my god reigns amen there's a spiritual Israel that's here this morning says I don't know what you you serve maybe some basketball star or some baseball fan or something like that some team but my God your God Don't Rain my god reigns this morning amen and we're going to give our God now Glory this morning and worship him and I just love that song you're singing there is a blood there's that other part to it that says not nothing can wash away my sin nothing but the blood of Jesus lord it's like an Anthem to me amen why don't we just go to prayer we'll just go to the word this morning Heavenly this heavenly father we are so thankful that Lord we can we serve a living God Lord may that be such a reality this morning so many indeed serve different gods Lord in the times of the Bible it was Stone maybe some wood and clay and Lord so many serve their gods of entertainment and fashion so many different things but Lord we serve a God that can meet the needs of his people Lord can feel the very desires of our heart can heal our bodies that are in need Lord can deliver our souls and our lost in sin that's a living God so Lord we thank you this morning for your presence and worship Lord we pray that you've been pleased with it now we invite you you Lord you are the welcome to guest this morning so we commit the word and what will be spoken may you take it Lord and anoint it we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen good morning hope you had a good sleep you're ready for a full day amen we all return to our Bibles thank you musicians thank you brother David for an opportunity to be here this morning I don't take it lightly and all to be standing at a Pulpit of a pastors it's a real honor and appreciative the McGeary family's been real close to our family for many years so we're just thankful we can be here sojourn with you and put our shoulder to the wheel amen mark 11. I have I really just wrestled to not go here this morning I studied for another direction for quite a while and was pushing against the wall it seemed to try and find a different way but for some reason this is where we're going just just uh maybe it's for one and the Lord Lord put uh well when the Lord threw me into Ministry I should say and pushed me that direction it was for one I said Lord for one I'll do it for one so here that's I say that every time lord if it's maybe just for one because it's worth ten thousand worlds so it's worth everything amen so maybe you just need to pull maybe it's I don't know who it's for but you pull on the word and may that one at least one Soul be a grip this morning Mark 11 11. very another familiar scripture and Jesus entered into Jerusalem and into the temple and when he looked round about upon all things and now the even tide was come he went unto Bethany with the twelve and on the moral when they were come from Bethany he was hungry and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came and happily that he might find anything thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves and for the time of figs was not yet Jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter forever and his disciples heard it off they went and we'll skip down verse 20. in the morning as they passed by us they'd some time has passed they passed by and they saw the Fig Tree dry it up from the roots and Peter Colin do you remembered saith unto him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou cursest is withered away and Jesus answered and said unto them have faith in God amen you shouldn't have been of revelation God had spoken and it was going to happen to my it's it's withered of course it's withered Peter I spoke I'm the master I'm the Creator and whatever I say is going to come to pass amen why don't we just uh skip a little ways back into the scripture of First Kings 22 it would help us tie these together a little bit First Kings 22 34 it's a good sound Paige is turning amen First Kings 22 34 says oh still a few pages turning quite a few pages turning all right we got there Kings Kings Chronicles Chronicles Ezra Nehemiah it's way back there all right verse 34 says a certain man drew a bow had a venture amen we'll stop it right there a certain man I know there's the remaining scripture but we'll just sit down and we'll get right into it that's it here we go you have your seats you're waiting for the rest nope we're gonna stop right there a certain man drew a bow that Adventure amen Adventure it's kind of something you just do we could say willy-nilly use that word down here no all right just just per chance it's gonna kind of throw it out there on a venture actually the the the definition would be kind of out of luck you know an event that's it's I can't see foresee what's going to happen but it's perchance that I'm gonna I'm gonna venture out there and and do such and such a thing and uh maybe to give you a better idea a couple examples that I had in my notes was anybody been on anybody that's gone on a journey that you've never been on before you have no clue what the the future holds about it anybody ever done that kind of Journey you're just like I'm going have no clue what's going to happen anybody ever do that yeah okay you're from like the old Pioneer world you know back in the old 1800s it's like I'm just heading west all right what's happening I don't know filling up the wagon and off we go he was a venturer going on an adventure he had no clue what was ahead of him it could have been wild beasts it could have been you know who knows what was coming ahead of him in the West in the old wild days but uh he just kind of took it for chance made sure he got lots of bullets in his gun and off he went on adventure into the unknown that was a venture he did now nowadays the current version of that is the venture capitalist who he's not going on an adventure into the unknown he's just throwing his money into the unknown and so he just says well I can't do it but my money can and so he throws it out there to do whatever he thinks it can happen high risk High Gain and so he's he throws his money so he's on a venture to hopefully capitalize on something that's going to give him some gain right so it's it's just kind of like yeah maybe okay so unless you have lots of money I suggest you don't do that right unless it's burning there and you have a hundred grand to do absolutely Zippo you have nothing better to do then and only then be the venture capitalist all right because there's high possibility that it's going nowhere it's high risk and so that not everybody's like that though most probably most people most people are not quite like that mostly because they don't have the deep pocket not because they don't like the risk so but there are people that don't they don't like Risk they they shy back from that and they hesitate maybe they they take kind of the the more reserved route you know and there's the they they like to plan or it's maybe that middle ground Zone they're bounced you know a little bit of risk a little bit of conservative you know aspect but but there's people that uh that they have no they have no desire for risk they have no desire for the unknown they hate the unknown and they want everything to be very precise and very you know very um planned out for them and and so those are those are people that that can be what we would maybe call a perfectionist that they they they they plan it all exactly how they want something to come out you know it's accurate it's it's thought out and they to get there and they're driven to ensure that it becomes exactly what's in their mind right that's the perfectionist anybody know anybody like that you chuckle they're important people you know because they get things done I know it can be frustrating sometimes but there it's good it's a good trade if you can work through the other parts of those of the other side of it you know but uh and and I get it because we all maybe even have some a little bit of that in us you know there's certain areas that we like to we're driven to make sure it's done right but some people are just that's all that consumes them I told uh when I if I look it up the the probably the highest highest uh perfectionist comes up on any Google any Google search for Perfections it does come up at Steve Jobs unfortunately that's who it is that comes up as a perfectionist heavy duty perfectionist but he drove people insane in his work because he was still driven it had to be so exact you know and I mean good grief if you've ever seen any of their uh any of the Apple Keynotes I mean just even how they describe things it's like dear goodness how many adjectives can you throw into a presentation because it's just perfection you know the metal the curve the cuts you know the fine tuning of it all and they're driven to ensure it's exactly what was in his mind is on the screen and so he's got thousands and thousands of people all moving in the right direction to make sure that that iPhone or iPad or airpod or something is exactly what it was in his brain mind you the airport wasn't there he was he died long before that so scratch that one from the record if I go to the let's no so every every brain of maybe what they're trying to to achieve and so they they put something there something's formulated and even brought now they have a little bit of a competition and so uh if you can put the first slide on the screen and I guess then I can use my arrows here do I click it there we go so he he was an image that was placed before somebody they said here make this and they're like all right you know here was perfection that was Perfection on my left on your yes yours as well and uh but whoever was attempting it they didn't it didn't quite manifest into the into the way that they were Desiring it to to happen and so it just didn't it didn't come to pass and uh again another another image was put not even an image actually the actual uh reality was placed in front of a in front of somebody and they said okay I'll go for it I'm gonna I'm gonna hit it I'm gonna hit the mark um and they attempted it and they didn't even I don't think they I think they're 100 miles from the mark same thing Mr Scrooge was placed in front of them actually if back to back Scrooge and and he was he was put in front of the front of the uh the masters of the cake and uh and they attempted to bring to reality what was in front of them not a perfectionist didn't nail it one bit that they just they missed the mark did they not now foreign and be very accurate which they were not in these last few slides they were far from accurate or even precise and and accurate and precise are trying to achieve that they're actually very different uh very different words you might use them we use them synonymous but they're very different any school teachers here I know I know there's at least one his sister Amy Johnson or was this Jamie Johnson here he's here a teacher fantastic so I'm going to help any students that are in here on accurate and precise in science because accuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the true or actual Target you learned this in science in high school it's very important as you get into a into you know your your experiments and such so students listen pretty closely accuracy how close the measurement is to the true actual Target value Precision is different Precision refers to how close measurements are to the same or to each other okay so you can be extremely precise and so we're going to show you we're going to say here someone low accuracy low Precision all over the map boom boom boom boom they got they're not accurate whatsoever but and they're not precise whatsoever either the next person threw some Arizona Target he was super precise he was all his arrows I mean he was a ProMaster at not hitting the target he was way off Target but he was dead precise okay so that's precise for you high accuracy is I'm I'm throwing it and I'm in the zone I'm I'm kind of there so I'm accurate but I'm not all there I'm not precise I'm just accurate okay but the last and final he's highly accurate and high Precision okay so he's he's right on the target every time and his grouping is is perfect amen not quite splitting arrows but he's perfect and then God's word just to give you visualization God's word isn't the first one it's not the second one nor is it even the third one it is the fourth one it is always highly accurate highly precise right to the Target every time in fact God's word splits arrows now the devil he he he's he even creates a whole lot of targets he wants you to feel like you've nailed it all the time in fact those cake people that's what they're supposed to do they're supposed to nail it brother Matthew they're supposed to nail it and they did not nail it but the devil he wants you to he wants you to to try and Achieve or make you feel like you you've nailed it and so he's he's always constantly uh putting up targets for you or making you feel in humanity what you're supposed to attain and so there's a pressure to attain what the current social uh you know aspect is or the current economics or the current culture that you're trying to attain something here's the target reach for it you know this and you compare yourself am I am I hitting the target you know and it's a terrible thing because if you're trying to shoot at the devil's Target you're off Target way off Target right we don't we don't judge ourselves and balance ourselves by what the world is doing because the world is slowly not slowly very quickly going farther and farther away and if you're trying to say well I'm still quite a bit of a distance is off off that I mean I'm a good look at what they're doing what I'm doing and you just slowly kind of move and keep this this parameter away from the world you have moved yourself because the world the devil is moving the target all the time moving Target we live in Changing Times things have changed they're constantly changing what you can say is changing but you could say 20 years ago you can't say now it's like my brother went and went to he was in a business meeting and they gave him this honkins honking slide of words you can't say no more it's like wow you know because it changes the world is changing and so you can see so sometimes when you have even because some you have an image in your mind of what you're trying to achieve time and pressures and the world changes that over time I'll give you an example last slide is it still active this was a self-portrait of Picasso painted of himself at age 15. this is what his image was and he he would have looked at himself somehow and Drew a self-porch and said yeah I nailed it that's me it's exactly who I am then he did that at 18 and he was you know got a little older and so he did another self-portrait and he started to to to you know that's exactly what I look like and so as he worked his way older and older oh something happened there we go 20 years old 25 he was nailing it every time 56 83 99 years old that's me that's exactly what I look like poor Picasso His image of what he thought it was was changing he thought he was hitting the target it's like yeah that's that's what I look like sorry Picasso you did not look this way at 90 years old terrible but that's what he thought he thought he was high precision and high accuracy on his self-portrait poor Picasso and so it changes over time all right thank you builders for the slides just to give you a little bit of a little bit of help there this morning so what I'm saying is don't line yourself with the trajectory of the world because it's changing the trajectory is is way off don't match up it's only the word of God that is going to be unchanging I am God and I change not that's what we want to align with amen better brother Brian says when you see when you start wrong you just keep going on wrong right if we're you're off Target at the beginning you're going to be way off Target at the end we ought to ensure that we're dead on high Precision high accuracy on our life Joy lined up with the word or way off brother says if a bullet supposed to be directed to a Target and you just jerk that Barrel one one thousands off he says you're at 100 yards you're four or five inches off you've missed the target actually you would have missed the bullseye right just by that one little bit one man says and so you actually need to count the cost of a decision count the cost of what what's the consequence am I am I dead on Target when I when you're looking at charting the course of your life uh one person said the best math you can learn is how to calculate the future cost of current decisions think about that you could learn two plus two it might do you some good you might learn quadratic equations might you do might do most of you not good because you'll never use it again but the best math he said is you can learn is how to calculate the future cost future cost of current decisions a decision you're setting a course you're setting a trajectory for the next five years the next seven years are you right on target very vital very vital but I'll tell you the word of God it never veers off course it never goes off Target it don't matter what happens come what may it's never haphazard neither it's not as the scripture says a certain man on a venture threw an arrow out there so we're going to go into that list a little bit First Kings 22 it says and it came to pass when the captains of the Chariots saw Jehoshaphat that they said surely it is the king of Israel and they turned aside to fight against him and Jehoshaphat cried out now let's just give you some a little bit of background to the story this is Jehoshaphat joined himself up with Ahab Ahab said please I need you to fight with me Jehoshaphat says absolutely my horses are yours my chariots are yours here I am bad move he didn't learn the math of your decisions and the consequences of it Jehoshaphat should not have been doing that but here he was because Ahab was in it was in a position that he didn't know of Ahab thought hey we should go up to Raymond Gilead it's our land God's given it to us so here we go Jehoshaphat says yeah we're God's people he says our this is our possession and so they decided to make this this joint effort in battle the prophets speak to saying yes it's it's yours Micaiah comes and he says I don't I don't see this happening and we can go in the back story of that and so here through all of that Jehoshaphat now is in battle Ahab has said Jehoshaphat uh you know what you go looking like a king I'm gonna disguise myself and not look like a king to me that would have been surely the first thing that said what's up with that why am I going looking like the hot spot and you're going in looking disguise it should have been really it should have been a red flag waving in the middle of the air but Jehoshaphat says sir okay I'll do that and so off he goes and that's why he was he was sought after all the all the 35 or so chariots from the I think the syrians or such were saying hey that's uh that's the king go and get him jehoshaphats he's going around in his Chariot and he cries out and he says oh my Joe Hasselbeck cries out and it says the next verse that came to pass when the captains of the Chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel that they turned back from pursuing him and so this was this is a good thing he said they're off my back and so the next scripture which she read and a certain man drew a bow at a venture he drew a bullet Adventure here's a man that is in battle he's he is in the thick of it there's there's people fighting all around him swords and Spears are clanging and clashing the din of war is there there's cries and and people are crying and dying and it's terrible terrible Time battle would have been as you're all around I mean you're just trying to stay alive and so somehow this fellow got maybe a breath at least he had some space and he's like man I should just throw an arrow in the air I should just maybe just for good for good luck here throw an arrow up there because that's what it says a certain man drew a bow at a venture and so hey there's nobody around me and he's got the bow you know only certain people had the bow so he throws the bow up notches and arrow kind of wings it out there he's like yeah wow yeah why not let's just throw an arrow out there you never know what could happen and so he here he is in the Roar of battle throwing out there and throws a a an arrow out there he you know he didn't have any uh perceived conception was going to happen he was hoping hoping his Arrow would hit a mark somewhere okay follow and officero went it just starts to go who knows he could have gone straight up he could have gone like this I know what his trajectory was but just at Adventure he threw it out there okay make it happen so now this arrow is it's cruising through the air we have to we have to think and sit back a little bit into First Kings and go where the word of the Lord came to Elijah and it said arise and go down and meet Ahab king of Israel which is in Samaria he said behold he is in the vineyard of naboth the arrows in the air think about it now any now we're going to go back hang that there he said he's in the vineyard of naboth with her he's gone down to possess it and thou shalt speak to him saying thus saith the Lord hast thou killed and taken possession and thou shalt speak in him saying thus saith the Lord in the place where the dogs lick the blood of neighbors shall dogs lick thy blood even thine this is what a prophet spoke to Ahab all right Ahab oh my goodness he took that he actually rented his clothes and he walked as the scripture says softly I don't really care how softly he walked the word of the Lord had been spoken Ahab the dogs are going to lick your blood walk as Softly As you want so he don't know where that's going to happen so he disguises himself in battle I don't know if it's Weighing on the back of his mind he's saying this is a dodgy place I don't want to be the the prime the prime target so I'm going to disguise myself it could and just try and you know keep keeping the back I'm sure that that kept there in the back of ahab's mind all the time the dogs are going to lick your blood Ahab dog's gonna lick your bloody hell and a certain Archer good luck on adventure through an arrow out into the air and the word of God that had been spoken just a few years before was hanging out in the air as well because it had gone out from the mouth of a prophet and grabbed a hold of the arrow I don't know what that fella was singing but it was on a venture but the word of God is never on adventure it's gonna go out and get his Target exactly high accuracy High precision and it took a hold of the arrow from adventurous Avengers booming and took the arrow and said uh-huh you're going exactly where I intended it which is right into these straps of Ahab which is exactly where it went hey man you ain't gonna try you're not gonna defeat or or the word of God gonna go off course if it was spoken it will happen in the air the poor Archer not poor Archer the Archer he had no idea the prophecy was there he didn't know he's like well I'll just throw an arrow that's all he was thinking not knowing that the word of God had been spoken and it was going to take that arrow and make sure just like it took a stone and made sure it landed in the exact spot it had to to drop a giant amen and it smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness wherefore he said unto the driver of his Chariot oh turn my hand and Carry Me Out of the host so he's wounded for I'm wounded and the battle increase and the King stayed up in the Chariot against the syrians and he died at even and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of The Chariot think about it think about it God's word don't venture the prophecy was spoken the arrow flap hits its Mark and now the word of God starts to unfold it was no Venture and here now their Proclamation went out the sun went down every man to his City the king died and brought to Samaria and the King died and was brought to Samaria they buried him there and one washed the Chariot in the pool of Samaria and he's starting to throw the bucket of water on the chair and started washing it out and little did he know God's arrows are nailing the Target because his word was spoken that Ahab the dogs are going to lick that and here just in fellow just just just washing out the chair but God's word is coming to pass exactly how it was decreed how much more if this was just a simple little Bowman out in a battle and he took his little simple bow and threw an arrow in the air just per chance how much more a son or daughter of God that has the word of God inside of them you say well I'm just simply I'm just going to come down I'm just going to get on my knees this morning maybe I'm just going to say a simple prayer to God maybe I'm just going to sing out a song you know I'm not really putting all of it into it but just I'm just going to sing it there how much more on adventure even his Arrow met the target how much more would your target how much more would the word in your mouth didn't hit the target you got a bow you got a bow use it send forth an object of Destruction to the enemy put the word on your lips it will land on its Target the word of God can just be like way over here way over there it's exact every time put it on your lips and may you be a Bowman but not on adventure God don't venture never will sometimes I wonder if you know that Soldier he didn't know his I don't think I think he probably died he might have died he might have gone home he had no clue what his Arrow did he had no idea that just it flew in the air and it actually was bringing the word of God to pass that a prophet had spoke he had no idea how often maybe you don't know that you came up and you sang a song and it just ministered and an arrow struck someone's Soul you had no idea you go home and like ah I bombed that verse no but actually something happened in the Eternal realm you came up and you said a prayer or a minister came up and said a word he goes home oh man I just didn't feel like I really really got got what was on my heart across but no he doesn't know that it actually reached the soul it reached the heart of a son or daughter of God the heroine in the air God's word doesn't venture amen thank you man scripture says so shall my word that go forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where unto I sent it amen so God's word is never going to return void yeah I'm sorry but if you're on if you're putting the word on your heart and your your heart is pure and you're singing a love song to Jesus you're Desiring to be a blessing to somebody it's not going to return void unto God not ever you know God's word God's word is extremely long range I love how long-range God's word is amen long-range weapons are a big deal I don't know if you know that recently but you know everybody's concerned about long-range weapons them the Intercontinental ballistics everybody's worried about the nuclear you know these bombs can reach me because these are long range and they're wanting to make sure that it's super accurate because they don't want to send off a nuke and be like oops it hit California instead of New York or you know vice versa they that'd be brutal and so they they ensure that it can be they can drop it straight on top of a little teeny building and they'd be exactly where that needs to land all right okay and if it gets out of line or out of trajectory that also is a problem as we talked in the beginning now and just to give an idea in Nassau they're shooting off some some uh Rockets up to the Moon to go and see the moon they want to look at it before they try and send somebody up there pretty good move to make sure that you know all the checks and balances are out there but before they throw a body but they have so many instruments that ensure the trajectory doesn't shift it actually circulates around the Moon they take the gravitational pull of the earth it does almost like this figure eight business going around in their in their planning and it's constantly shifting because it's it's getting adjusted by the by the you know the atmospheres and such to make sure it doesn't move off course God's word is so long range and never needs an adjustment of its trajectory what he said at the beginning is going to be all the way to the end he doesn't be like oh oops that was a little off I got to adjust that a little bit that's not how God's word works but man is always desired to make sure that they got some some long-range aspects in fact I did some looking up you know because I tell you I'll tell a story of myself I was hunting one time and I shot at a at a moose and it was not that far from me it was like 150 plus yards maybe 175 Max man I was it just wasn't going down and I'm like man I missed him I was so upset I said I ain't going hunting again until I'm a sniper period so it happened I'm going to be able to shoot 700 800 000 yards shot and it don't really matter how far that moose is I'm nailing them done and I hung up that gun I haven't shot it again I'm not a sniper yet neither but you know you can actually get a scope go onto a certain gun and it actually you don't have to be a sniper you don't have to go through the training you don't have to do Zippo because people desire long range without all the effort and so you can actually just hit a button and put a dot on something you don't have to have any training first shot you just put it on the target you hit a button and then all you do is pull the trigger and and wait till the the Red Dot lands on that spot you marked and it'll then initiate the bullet and and it's already computed all of the issues in the wind and all the stuff that you got to deal with and make sure it hits it just just like that yeah it costs a whole ton of money but it's there it's there out of my range so I'm not hunting with it in the next short time ever actually ever but it's there because because man desires to have a long-range accuracy without but it's it's a lot of work but God don't need that he don't need no scope on his word to be like ah you know how do I get there and I need all these different factors it's high accuracy High Precision every time but sometimes it's so long range that we're wondering is it even there it's flying but you're like wow is it really happening for me Eve was there he was there brother Brown said she couldn't she she wouldn't wait she didn't have patience to wait for the spoken word to fulfill its promise to create a word seed Eve couldn't wait it was out there now he says you see the seed that she was holding and would have finally become a mother by the will of God through his spoken word she would have finally become a mother but she couldn't wait foreign God might have spoken something it knew he has something in plan for you you just need to wait sometimes it's coming to pass but she got impatient and disbelieved the word of God and didn't wait long enough brother Brown says that's what Christ found he's speaking about Adam and found he said he couldn't wait he said that's the matter with the people today they can't wait for the really real Holy Spirit to take the church in possession and they're trying to manufacture something individual initial evidence speaking in tongues get more members in the church and he said all this Tommy rot instead of waiting upon the Lord for the real manifestation of the resurrection of Christ making himself known among the people and this is what Eve did she did not he said what did she do she went out became pregnant with denominationalism first was Assemblies of God then a Oneness then came what more after that the so-called bride is pregnated with all kinds of Tommy rot disgrace because they couldn't wait for the real manifestation of God to come into the church and so this is Brother Brown typing it to Eve and here Eve at the beginning the serpent came in he started to speak a different word from what God had spoken you know he was pretty pretty precise in what he wanted to say you know he was he was he was calculated even maybe through a couple arrows fairly On Target talking to her but you know it sounded right God said to multiply and replenish the Earth you know you have a body that was given to do that you were made for this but he so he started to throw some things in there but then he threw in one Arrow so far off Target but you shall surely not die and so isn't that just how Satan can work he can throw a lot of different reasoning at you like well that kind of sounds about writer you know that kind of sounds but he's gonna throw in a Zinger always it's going to be offward and you've got to be waiting for that aspect because that's the devil's tactic get enough we're like well that kind of sounds about there but it's not all there it's not all high accuracy all high precision what happened to Eve hybrid it she bred it what did it do it turned to death now here it stays the word just the same here's the word laying there just the same he says now what happened he says here's the word God spoke to multiply and replenish the Earth he says but it couldn't find a place to land God spoke it and it's like oh man there's nowhere for it to land oh there's no target well let's take that out of the air God spoke it it will come to pass there's no way it's going to just just lay there and fall off in the out of the atmospheres he said so it was sitting there finding a place to land god knew exactly where it was going and so it was sitting there waiting because it's long range it's far out it wasn't just right there years now had to transverse of time as that word went forth and that Arrow not drones like yeah way out there no God had high Precision he drew that word back and let her fly and said oh that's okay I got the longest Rings known to man outside of all the manly man thoughts and he just let that Arrow fly and it started to go Abraham into Moses and all through the generations through the prophets of Jeremiah and Isaiah it just kept sailing it didn't need any work to deviate it back on the line oh that's just off course a little bit no it just kept going exactly the way he said it at the beginning and it just started sailing butter Brenham says finally finally this word caught in the womb of a virgin caught in the womb of somebody and says I'm going to believe it all it's exactly what God Said Isaiah spoken a virgin shall conceive and she held that in her heart and there the word of God went and then finally what Gabriel showed up and he spoke to Mary says there are handmaiden blessed are you highly favored among women and there she is oh she's hearing the Angels speak to her the words of what had been spoken what had been in God's mind from the very beginning of time and here she's like uh-huh well how can this be it wasn't doubting how can this be that you shall conceive of the Holy Ghost and she's just saying oh be it unto me according to Thy word it's because it caught in the womb of a sense the daughter of God a seed of God he says I don't just believe none of that and the arrow of God's word came and smoothed her and caught in her womb he said but a virgin born brother Branham says not a hybrid he says now through this I'm giving this life that if that if you by faith accept what the father all the prophets all the word of God I'll pour this life down upon you and you you can't do nothing else but produce the same thing that I am amen that was the beginning of creation because God his life he put his life into a womb and says okay this is the beginning this is what I had in my mind I spoke it and I was waiting for a seed to believe my word yeah and he said that bride is going to be in my likeness and receive what Eve did not Abraham says but the word of God has been sowed and when the spirit of God begins to fall the word of God will live in the people and that false bride he said is committed adultery out there brought herself into Creed sold her birth bright birth rights and will reap what he said a confederation of churches he says but where the word has been sowed into the people's heart amen where the word has been sowed it wasn't on adventure God's not well I hope I've got a bride out there I hope someone's going to believe my word no he threw an arrow every single time he says I know exactly where there's going to be a bride I know exactly where there's going to be a soul he says and then when it will reap a bride of Christ as certain as I'm standing here he says end time sign amen it's an arrow not a no Venture threw it out there he knew exactly where you are he knew that you'd be walking here right today he knew that you'd receive his word right today and so he threw an arrow out billions and billions and billions of years ago before the foundation of time he says I know I know there's going to be a Son of God and I'm going to throw my arrow because there's going to be an ordained moment that you're here on this Earth and what nail dudes whoa what happened it's called eternity struck you because you were he said it will reap a bride of Christ as certain as I'm standing here amen he said that we progestinated will hear and will make ready for the countdown the Royal seat of Abraham's Faith Like Him holding to the word of God regardless for he was predestinated amen you know again hard sometimes to see that those word the word of God is traveling through eternities through time to reach its Mark and there was those if you can imagine back in Jesus day when Jesus was on Earth and he was doing manifesting the very scriptures before them and he was Healing The Sick and he was he was Discerning the thoughts of their heart and calling different ones to follow him and and here then suddenly you know the power of God was moving amongst all the people and he said now and then suddenly but Abraham says now the man was now with Roman soldiers that wrapped a rag around his face and couldn't see it and was hitting him on the head with the sticks and Anna tell us if you're a prophet tell us who hit you and and now they're looking at a man that looks weak defeated seemingly he says but Abraham says it actually broke their faith it should not have but it did he says it does yet he said we see a man who called a dead man from the grave and who we could do all these wonderful Miracles and see him hang on a cross now great spittle all over his face his beard and his face is bleeding the soldiers where it jerked his beard out he said I wonder if we're thinking the same thing today you know where's the promise of his coming you know people just say well you know is it really is a Rapture really coming I've heard this for so long you can get to a point but Abraham says where their faith was broken this moment he says I wonder if we're thinking the same thing he says do you think of it that way but Jesus here they were you can imagine how depressed that moment could have been those few those hours after the crucifixion and everything was in pure dismay they didn't know they had been told as we said last night they were told what was going to happen but he said it broke their faith and they forgot that there was a word that was spoken Outlet I'll never let his soul go into hell neither him see corruption it's not going to happen a word had been spoken out there but they're all dismayed how can this be he or he was healing the lame and healing the blind and raising Lazarus from there can you imagine Lazarus came out of the Tomb he was dead for days can you how come he can raise Lazarus and here we just buried him in a tomb they're walking in Emmaus they're pretty down I mean put yourself back in the days they do some incredible moments I mean the crowds were following just trying to get to the Hem of a garment of Jesus Christ and here now he's he I mean he watched on most of them fled away but some of them would have looked on and see seen their lord just beaten and whipped and a crown of thorns and then crucified and I I just how can this be but then one stepped up and join them along the way and he started to speak to them a little bit he saw they were pretty down and pretty discouraged he says well let's just talk a little bit and he just started to speak to them about the scriptures he started to talk to them about some arrows that had been let loose a long time ago he says well I just want to tell you right from the beginning there was something said back in Genesis that happened he said there was someone going to come that was going to crush the head of a serpent his heel would be bruised but the head would be crushed do you not remember those scriptures and who that was speaking of yeah yeah yeah yeah we do and so they started to talk about all the scriptures did you know there's a prophet gonna rise up like unto me as Moses spoke and so he just started to encourage them and start to let them know don't you know there were some arrows in the air don't you know that something was gonna this was gonna happen and he was trying to tell them my word is accurate my word is precise why are you dismayed right now look at who I am but their eyes were still not quite open there I can imagine if you think of those last moments what what the the repercussions or the concussions in hell as God's words started to come to pass as brother Brown said even those last seven minutes of time the prophecies have started to be coming fulfilled don't you think the devil didn't know about those things he didn't know those prophecies were out there and they started to happen like this happened like that happen like this fulfilling exactly who the Messiah was I can imagine hell every time one of them words landed on target Hill Pool what just happened oh one of God's words one of the prophets he's just became fulfilled are you kidding me whoa what just happened another one just became fulfilled it rattled hell rattled hell yeah and then it really rattled hell when he stepped down into hell he said all right you bet oh okay you got what we got you oh you think you got me you had a champion Called Death that's who you thought got me but I'm going to tell you right now I am the Creator and I've come down to if I feel all my word amen the Rebecca says he began to explain to them the need of the fulfilling of the scripture that the prophets had said I feel really religious right now amen he says you know what I'm speaking of would we be so thought slothful and foolish of mine to confine ourselves to a book of Creeds and lay aside the Bible and say the days of Miracles was passed when Jesus said I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world he said how could we be so slothful and Jesus rebuked him he said you should have known the scriptures my don't be dishearted don't be dishearted like I said well isn't the promise of his coming I know some you know we talked about last night you know people drift away and doing certain things don't don't be dishearted oh he's just so wicked you know it's it's layout of seeing age I mean the pressures of it don't be disheartened it's scripture it's script that must be fulfilled that should take heart I mean like it's happening this is a wicked day it is Sodom and Gomorrah it's scripture the arrow went up it's happening yeah he said wow they're so lukewarm how come they can't be fervent it's scripture it must come to pass now God's expression through you when that Arrow that went out not on no Venture with precise accuracy and struck you don't you think if God can be that highly accurate and that highly precise to ensure that his word is fulfilled when it hits you do you not think that it's going to then fulfill exactly what he has in mind for you has to if he can have that high accuracy that high Precision it's going to come to pass what he desired that Arrow to do amen that's right that Abraham says because you know he goes you know we have a he talks about a strain in the family not not a not a uh a difficulty not that kind of string but a strain of a gene in the family he says he says you know we have you ever heard of a strain that will kind of impersonate his father or mother and anybody ever you know that you can have little children and you're like wow well he's got your ears dear he sure got your nose you know because there's a strain there that is representative of who he came from and so it looks like it acts like it talks like whatever it is it's because there's a connection in the gene code that's exactly who I am and so it it it impersonates brother Brown says his father or mother or grandfather or grandmother he says that strain in the family he says you heard of it haven't you yes he says that's the same thing in predestination you are supposed to be here the right way at the beginning but being that you come the way you did you're subject to the fall but being that you're predestinated you hear the word and it brings you right back to where you predestinated God put a gene in his seat of God in you a gene of God and it's got an exact coating and it's got to make itself come out to be it's not going to be like well I'm going to throw that piece out and forget the utga and all that way I'm going to kind of create my own thing a gene is going to code itself and it's going to manifest exactly what the gene has in mind who here knows genetics all right yes thank you sister Amy exactly because it's impossible as it goes through and it tries to to to build out the building blocks it will manifest exactly exactly now in the human yes we can have these little mutations or something happen but not God's Gene it's perfect it's high accuracy High precision and so when he put a gene in you it will come out exactly what his mind is so when he sees you receive the word of God and you're hearing the word and it strikes your soul some of you 40 years ago some of you 15 years ago some of you today it is striking you and it's God saying that's exactly what I had in my mind look at my daughter she is manifesting exactly what I put inside of her isn't that beautiful if God could step back and be like oh that's what I had in mind oh isn't that beautiful why because his word Goes Forth and it isn't going to deviate ever it's impossible actually for a son or daughter of God to deviate from what he had in mind that should give you a lot a lot of and he could step back and he could say Matthew I nailed it that's what God can say he said he nailed it it was no cake it's like that's way off Target no God's going to be able to step back and say Perfection because she's part of me and I'm perfect so are you he's perfect not me I'm perfect through him amen had to clarify that right there brother Brown says well then what's the use of preaching about around him he says well you know if it's predestinated in all happy he says what's the use of preaching he says I'm just doing the sainting he says I'm throwing out the net I'm just throwing it out I'm throwing the word out there he said I'm throwing out there to see where it goes he says maybe there's some muck in the world denominations they throw it off he says they just can't absorb it but he'll turn the Son and Daughter of God just as sure as the world Amen because she is predestinated amen it'll find this place by the preaching of the gospel and it's going to hit its Target exactly because God is not going to let it Con void you know I was thinking I was thinking was it brother Henry walner that had uh 25 jobs yeah 25 jobs we had a brother in our church he just just recently passed away and he went through that many jobs do you know how discouraging discouraged he was how discouraged was he very discouraged 25 jobs plus minus a job or so because he just couldn't keep it because God had an arrow that went out on his word and he had something in mind he had actually a predestinated seed in mind and so then he had another Son of God going from job to job to job to job I won't say it 25 times it's a lot of times and he's hired and fired hired and fired who's been fired once twice I want to ask if you've been fired it's a terrible probably a difficult moment he was hired and fired or let go or just said you know we don't need you anymore that many times 20 plus times 25 times and he's like what am I doing wrong he didn't know that God had shot a word out on a bow not on adventure but with high accuracy because there was a seed of God at his 26th job that he was going to land there and going to witness to him he doesn't know this so we're walking as Sons and Daughters of God you can get oh discouraged what's going on but God threw it out he said uh-uh I need to move you this many times because I need you to get there it's high accuracy High Precision it's not 27 jobs enough 24 jobs he was 25 so that the 26th he'd find his seat far beyond our ideas you couldn't say well I'm going through something difficult maybe it's 25 jobs you're going through something you don't know but you're a son and daughter of God led by the spirit of God God's gonna find its Mark whatever it may be letter Brandon says that's the reason God could work his Works to Jesus he was predestinated son he was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world before a hundred billion trillion million years ago just do the math on that that he said Genesis 1 1 spoke of a while ago he was right then predestined to take its place and every one of the sons that will have the same manifestation that the ones that was predestinated amen amen if he was so are you he says predestinated he was makes word seed flesh and you he says the reason they hold on to it God's people don't let go and I'll give her up you know they'll give up because something he was driving you I can't let go of this he said they don't back up he said then don't back up when you get your tradition he says stay right with the word now moving fast Mercy really fast scripture says the word of God is sharper more powerful than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit it's a penetrator the word of God is a penetrator I haven't been that long have I I'm just kidding Satan's bow he's of Interest Satan does venture all right God don't Venture Satan Ventures he does indeed he has a big quiver he's got constant reloads coming in reinforcements throwing in giving him new quiversary because he's just firing him out there he's just throwing arrows at you all the time he's hoping that they'll land somewhere in your mind somewhere that you can will take hold he's like yeah just maybe throw something out there or maybe temp so and so with this such and such a thing and like really that you know try again he did he's just adventurous he's like I'm hoping maybe it'll hit its Mark or something like that that's the Devil he's adventurous and he throws it out there but God's word no venturer and it pierces much deeper than what the devil can handle the devil unfortunately he's got a training bow he doesn't really have the bow that God has and so he he's got to throw more arrows out hoping that something's going to happen if he you know we did a little thing for our camp this year and we did bows and arrows for uh some of the kids and we put these little rubber tips on them we took the the target tips off we put the rubber tips on they didn't last too too bad in fact you pretty much shoot it at somebody it wouldn't even hurt them more or less we tried so I know you know that's like the devil's arrows they've got rubber tips on it sometimes it can only go so far you might even try to upgrade and put the training tips on but it only Compares just so far into your mind you can't go any deeper than that he's trying to get as far as he can but he's Limited in his barrel and its capacity amen but I had a we have a principal at the school and he had bow he brought it we were doing an outdoor thing with the students and he brought some some arrows in and he showed me an arrow tip that he had on one of them and I said dear goodness that thing is lethal it was anyway it had crazy uh you know metal all around it but actually had these Circle these flutes that went down the arrowhead because when that Arrow went into a into some game it actually created holes straight all the way through that it is bled sorry maybe too much information but but it was a deadly Arrowhead and just for the just for example's sake God's arrowheads are far worse than that amen they can penetrate so deep the scripture says sharper than any two-edged sword piercing and dividing between Soul and Spirit so when God sends his word out there he's put onto whatever capacity he needs he says this this son of God they've got a little bit too much a little bit of heavy crust on their outer layer I need to get deep into their soul I need my word to get a little deeper Satan's like well I've been working at him and he's just hitting in their Spirit realm he's Landing in their mind he might even afflict you so it hit in your flesh but God sends his Arrow of his word out he said I'm going deeper than that I'm going all the way I'm going to penetrate I'm going to drive through all them layers and I'm gonna pierce the soul of my daughter I'm gonna pierce the soul of my son and it's gonna grab a hold and anchor deep that's his word intended place it reaches it and it penetrates all the way that's why when Jesus could speak to the tree as he read at the beginning when he could say his word and he could then say no more no more fruit from you brother Branham said he said he wasn't speaking to the leaves he wasn't even speaking to the branches he said he wasn't even speaking to the roots why because the word of God is sharper and it can Pierce and divide between Soul and Spirit and so when he spoke he said he said now watch the tree died from where the roots he said the Bible said it was withered from The Roots he said in the root was the tree life in the roots was the life and so the word of God went forth out of the Creator and he spoke to the life of the tree he said he didn't speak to them leaves he spoke to the life and the life left the tree he didn't say all leaves with her and the leaves with her but you know still the trunk and everything was kind of still functioning he went straight to the source straight to the core of it past the roots right to The Germ of life he said how much more when the word of God Is Spoken that it can't go to the life of a disease to the life of a cancer to the root of the cause to this to a tumor or to somewhere somebody's eyesight whatever it could be God's word speaks right to the source of it it hits the exact Zone where something's going to happen that's why when there's a new birth something changes because the life was penetrated not just something on the surface oh the spirit of God comes oh you know you're just dad you know it is a really affecting Spirit no no when the word comes and it penetrates right to the soul the life has changed if the tree had died but a son or daughter of God when life comes into the soul realm it lives it's a new creation he says now would be any harder why would it be any harder for Jesus to speak to cancer he said what you say not me what I say you say believe that it'll come to pass and the life will leave it amen God's word speaks to the very Life Source that's why when you could brother Brown speaks so often the woman at the well and she said he says the light struck the seed amen it was the word of God speaking to the life right to the source of it that's why she got up and said ho ho and she ran into the city said I'm going to tell you about a man who told me everything that I was because it spoke to the source amen now might just go through a little part here quickly you know Deuteronomy says but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which I've not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that Prophet shall die so God is very he's very keen to ensure that don't say nothing in my name that I didn't tell you or you die so it was it's not a small thing to be a prophet of God laying that down and if you say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the Lord has spoken okay so maybe you've asked that question how do I know it's the word of the Lord he says when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if that thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken okay the reverse would apply if it did come to pass he says I say this in the name of the Lord and it comes to pass then it would say and prove that it was something that the Lord hath spoken but the prophet hath spoken it if it doesn't come to pass the prophet spoken presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid of him or you won't stand in awe whoa that's a prophet you won't do that because it didn't come to pass his presumptuous and there's a lot of prophets in the scripture and they spoke they said thus saith the Lord thus saith the Lord there you can you can walk all the way through scripture I won't take too much time I don't care if it's Moses or Elijah or Isaiah or Jeremiah or as a different ones they would they would speak in the scripture different different Amos and different ones would say certain things the Virgin shall conceive or or you know they told Israel they're going to have a yoke of iron upon their neck or Mount Carmel Showdown you know and it wouldn't matter but these prophets would have spoke the word of the Lord and it came to pass and so then the people feared them or stood in awe because that's what scripture says and so they believed it said this is a prophet of God he said thus saith the Lord and it came to pass this is the prophet of God that's why they can Revere Moses he's a you know incredible Prophet because God spoke through him and it came to pass I can tell you if Moses said he says thus saith the Lord Pharaoh let my people go and it never happened guess what the people wouldn't they're like you're a false prophet but that's not what happened and so it's very straightforward in the scripture a prophet said thus saith the Lord it happened that's a prophet some distilled to believe can you imagine again Ahab he was told you're going to die thus saith the Lord this is going to happen you know what he he did believe something he didn't like Micaiah he always speaks evil of me you know but they knew he didn't want him to come don't say anything because it was going to come to pass I don't want to hear it almost they believe they believe but you know what let's just skip up a little bit because we've had a prophet in this day that he said thus saith the Lord many times there's actually over 400 times in the Old Testament in the in the uh in the message it's over it's over 1600 times that it's actually brother Brown says thus saith the Lord not all in that context so there's hundreds and hundreds of times that brother Branham actually says thus saith the Lord okay why is it so hard I I just I'm just asking the question for for whomever we're all believers here but I just can't understand how it's so hard if people can believe thus saith the Lord and hear which they don't even have any proof that actually happened they say well I just believe Moses did said that and and the Red Sea parted I just believe Moses said darkness in the comments and it happened he said thus said the Lord and I believe it of course because it's in the Bible but then a prophet can come in this day and say thus saith the Lord and it happens again and again and again and again why is it so hard to believe it that this is a prophet of this day I don't understand this I asked the question I I give you some examples even Congressman Upshaw it's a simple example he said in the service he's talking to him he was and he says he saw a vision he says do you own a brown suit I'm just I'm just paraphrasing for time and he says because you've been reverent and you've honored the Lord he's rewarding you so that these latter years you can have a happy ladder years thus saith the Lord Lord Jesus the Christ has healed you okay this is pretty prominent thus said the Lord the Lord has healed you Congressman Upshaw says when he says right now right now can you imagine he's been in his wheelchair for a lot of years he says thus said the Lord Christ has healed you he says when right now guess what he did he got up and he started walking how just even in that one instance get someone to say well that's a prophet he spoke thus say of the Lord it happened before my eyes that's a prophet of God but no it had to happen hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of time and still they disbelieve I had an example and we know of Isaiah and Hezekiah I I won't go through it in in its entirety but if you read about it Isaiah gave has said thus saith the Lord you're going to die and uh Hezekiah went and prayed and then he Lord told Isaiah to go back and tell him thus saith the Lord's going to live a little longer you know that scripture good so just to prove that the god of the Bible is the god of today God ordained an instance in the prophet's time to to show that again he says that I am the same Hebrews 13 8 how often brother Branham spoke this message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever because God's word must come to pass and so he's proven again this is my word I'm going to have it happen again so if you go into scripture or in the message brother Brown talks about a situation where he uh someone came to to have him come and pray for somebody and he knelt down and pray for them and he's waiting for the fellow to come he was going to come and he said I was just there and he said a world of wind started to to blow he says wow it's getting ready windy out there you know how often how many times the Lord came to brother Branham and still a little Whirlwind to start he said oh it's really windy out there but no it was the moving of the Lord he was coming into the room and he says don't go over there his Angel Lord spoke to him don't go over there his time has come and so brother Brian the brother came he said you know uh uh you're going to come and pray for the sick but Abraham he takes his coat back off that he'd put on and he says no he says for thus saith the Lord the man's going to die you can imagine what that did to the fellow his friend and such than that and he said oh my well you know please come and pray and I said no no it's not going to happen you can call me tomorrow morning and uh you know uh don't call me tonight but you just tell me how it how you know just how how he passes it when he passes and he rolls out the door on my buddy my poor buddy he's just you know in distress and and really saddened thus said the Lord the man's gonna die skip forward a little bit he said brother Brandon then reads the Bible he goes to sit down he reads the Bible and his Bible opens to Hezekiah and he starts to read about how God spared him and then he says the phone the phone rings and uh he says brother this is the next morning and it's and it's his brother and he has he's like well you know what kind of news are you gonna you know what what's happened and he says well it's just it's just really the last few minutes of before before he dies it's just any time now and then brother Branham I'm just going too fast I missed a part he said call me in the morning and the next morning before this phone call better Bradham has a vision and he sees a lady sitting in his sitting in his room and he actually wakes up on his bed he looks over and he sees a lady in his room and he's a little bit shocked because he couldn't figure how she even got in his room but then he realizes this is a vision and she's kind of looking sad and she's dressed a certain way then he sees a man in a light suit with a red tie and he's kind of looking sad and then they kind of look at each other and then they kind of they kind of smile at each other and then he sees himself preaching better Branham on on a stage of some sort and then he sees the the man and the woman kind of look each other's smile and kind of Nod it and not at brother Brown him and then it fades away he says oh that's kind of weird maybe that's somebody I'm going to see today is what he says so the next morning he gets it up in the in the uh in the morning he reads the scripture and God points him to Hezekiah and then the phone rings and he says you know what's been happening he says well it's a it's about ready he's about ready to pass and then brother Brown says it Dawns on him what that Vision means and he says what he says is the does the wife wear certain clothes he describes it he said sure he says does the man wear a light suit with a red tie a man says all the time he says tell the wife to come to the phone so the wife comes to the phone and he's like but you know she's he's gonna die any moment here he says get her on the phone and so he she comes to the phone he says sister are you ready now and she says what do you mean he says I said thus saith the Lord your husband shall live this is just to give you confidence that this word still stands he says thus saith the Lord your husband shall live do you believe that I didn't hear no answer I says I couldn't hear no answer like someone was carrying on and said oh she'd fainted and so she but her Kenny came to the phone and said what's the matter he says the woman fainted I said well I told her thus saith the Lord her husband's going to live he said what let her brand and then heads he's in he said well I'm going to come so he heads there because I walked in a sister his this lady this man's sister is walking down the hall and she's like the very idea this holy ruler preacher around here and she just scored in it she said I think it's a disgrace brother Brown says that didn't matter one one bit to him he says the Devil Couldn't send enough imps out of hell to stop what's going to happen he said there's nothing that's all he said that's been done said thus said the Lord he goes oh you just don't know how I felt he's walking down the hallway he knew exactly what was going to happen because he's a prophet of God and God had spoke through his mouth so he walked in that room he said is there anybody in there there was some Doctor Who said he sent the doctors out they're all looking a sarcastic at him he said so I told I held his hand and she said the wife was looking like she was going to faint again he says now don't worry he says Dear God you who spoke to me this morning in a vision I know these people are to meet me in Jonesboro Arkansas in the service for I was standing on the platform and this is the man and the woman now let the angel of God speak and I felt the vibrations start to leave he said I just kept on praying I fell to grit my hand I know life was there he said I felt him grab my hand I just waited there a little bit and directly I began he began to wet his lips he had some dry lips in there and so he was she was still down at the foot of the bed crying I just waited a little bit directly I seen him look over and I said do you know me she raised up real quick and she looked at me she's seen him raise his head like this and on his hand like this he says and I said you know me he said yes it's brother Branham she said my she just Dove through the oxygen tent here like she said oh Dad Dad Dad like that and grabbed him up around like that and just went hugging and everything and he goes I just got up and slipped right out of the room just like that he didn't have no doubt he wasn't wondering what was going to happen oh God are you going to meet me here no because God had spoken thus saith the Lord he is going to live just so you could have another perfect pattern of scripture before you that said Isaiah spoke to Hezekiah I got a prophet in this day that had the exact same thing happen so that you have no excuse to believe my word Hallelujah where where and how do these challenges of the message even find footing to even speak against it when over and over and over again and even brother Branham said at the end of these 17 days if what I said don't come to pass put false prophet on my back you don't think there was a Challenger back then it was like oh yeah okay I'm going to look for every possible area that I can just critique and say no you're wrong you're a false prophet you don't think they were there oh they were there of course they were there brother Brandon even talks about another instance where there was another one he said a woman who was dying with she had cancer and he said in three days she'll be on the street and the guy laughed at him he said such a disgrace you imposter put that woman under false thoughts like that I said it wasn't me it was him and he said well you know that woman will be dead in the next six hours said she's been unconscious now for 24 hours she's going to go into time I said if she's not in the Street Shelton in 24 hours I'll tell you what I do I put a sign on my back it says false prophet she's going to shout or I'm a false prophet and I'll go out there and put a sign on my back he says you get your big Cadillac and drive me around can you even imagine the guy standing there like okay where's this going well it's going here because if she is on the street and she is shouting then let's put a sign on your back that says crack doctor is what brother Branham said to him guess what there was no brother Branham going around on the Cadillac with false prophet it didn't happen and I don't know if he held up his end of the deal and put crack doctor on the back I don't think that happened either because it was thus saith the Lord it must come to pass because God don't Venture in his words foreign what confidence that can give us in the word of God of the hour amen Amen Let Us close I'll just go through this last little part here brother Branham I'm just when you can when there's a people Sons and Daughters of God that can receive the word of our day very few didn't know his day if you didn't take it in Moses day you died in the Passover firstborn if you didn't get a nose the message in those day you didn't get on the ark and you died but there was a reward for those that believed the accurate precise word of their day if you believed it in Noah's day you got on an ark and there was safety and there was safety in an ark amen so there's a there's a reward in in believing the truth of your day there's there's many but just I just want to focus on a little bit on one here a little bit brother Branham talks about the squirrels that he spoke into existence because the Lord spoke to him and it happened a couple times first time three times and then the next time it happened and the Lord spoke to him and says three squirrels and and so he spoke it I'm not going to go into in detail you can go in to speak to this mountain if you want to get and my present Ministry if you want to go and read it all but he spoke to him and uh if you read it there's three squirrels he shoots and he places him in different areas they appear he shoots them he says no no vision because they bled and he ate them and uh but then there's a fourth appeared and he and he and it he didn't shoot it he couldn't get it he said of course because the Lord said three so it had to be three but then he comes back and speaks to to the group of people then brothers that were there and they they start praying and one of the brothers there Praises this is wonderful testimony he said they had some shouting and praising and then he said you know Lord uh you know if brother Branham if he what he told us was the truth would you help him find that for a squirrel and brother Brandon was really smitten because he had just told him what God had told what God had told him to do and speak to the squirrels and God the spoken word had spoken and it had happened but then someone's like wow you know if you're telling the truth that four squirrel should should you know you should find it the next day and he's like he said no butter Tony in his mind he's saying you know you the Lord had dealt with his wife she was on the floor She God had saved her and he's like how are you doubting this ministry and he just said you know it even kind of went to the brothers there and so this is how they received it they received it in this way and it was just kind of a wonderful time and if you go to the end of the story brother Brown does indeed find the the four squirrel giving it seven a completion and it won't go into that aspect but then after that he's actually with sister Hattie Wright's family at the Wright family home and he's telling about this account to her and and to the family there and he's just saying you know I said you know Lord he says what bothers me is on those squirrels he says I we're supposed to be good hunters and he's talking to brother wood who's there and he said I can never figure it out you know just standing all over the grounds there he said there shall be a squirrel here and and I've been sitting there 45 minutes and no more that took my finger down there's a squirrel he says if the Lord was confirming my Ministry to let me know what was going to he's going to help the people he says then that same Jehovah Jireh I was in need of a squirrel as Abraham was in need of a ram he said I believe Jehovah Jireh places that there his same spoken word he said it wasn't me because I didn't know what I was saying he said it himself so it must come to pass and so they're just sitting in the home there's there's eight of them actually there in in the home and now he's this is the same account he just told to the the brothers that had been there you know they didn't believe one of them surely didn't believe he said well you know let's let's hope you find it and then we'll believe you kind of thing but now he's he's now in a different sphere a completely different environment and they're just listening to him and they're just they're just talking you know just a nice little time and little old sister Hattie Wright she's sitting back there mother Brown says she'd never say nothing she's a quiet little thing and she's got her little dust Bonnet on it like the country woman wear there and she put on a little clean dress to come over and she's just helping her mom cook she's just kind of in the background butter Brown's at the table she's kind of you know not really right there and it's not an extremely emotionally charged moment they're just they're chatting and she just has a little clean dress on and and she says she's sitting with her hands like this she said and she said that's nothing but the truth that's nothing but the truth this is a completely different response now than what had happened just a little bit ago and she's just sitting there and she says that's nothing but the truth I thought my isn't that no different than a little humble bride that is receiving a word of her hour and she's just humble she isn't nothing much she's just simple little thing got our little Bonnet on just believing the whole word and we're just listening in we're just listening in and say huh oh that's wonderful that's a good word is that right and she says listen to that wow that's exactly that's the exact accurate word of God that's not off trajectory at all I believe that 100 I might not understand that she could have just been pondering all this like you have been pondering all this and then she just sits there and she says that's nothing but the truth do you know what happened to that moment yeah you know what happened in that moment brother Brown said she said the right thing you believed the right thing he said here's my Bible as a servant of God I say this here she said the right saying the word in her answered back to the word is what happened the spoken word went out she says oh that's exactly the truth I believe every word of that and it went straight back oh I must have just struck the heart of God when a little little sister dear little daughter God said I believe every word of that it just must strike strike the heart of God when his word Goes Forth and you're listening to it he said Lord I believe that that is nothing but the truth I ain't doubting none of that it's everything in me it's saying yes Lord yes Lord oh it just smites me says um he spoke back to his Prophet spoke back into the prophet and he said the spirit of the Lord said to me tell her ask what she will and you give it to her this is the reward now of believing the pure accurate word of God here she didn't have no hesitation she didn't just trust the word of a prophet he says what you've said has come to pass that's thus say of the Lord I believe it he says I couldn't even speak he says that room everybody felt stranger said sister Hattie she said yes but around him I said thus saith the Lord speak anything you desire I don't care what it is if you want to know that God gives this ministry speak anything you desire thus saith the Lord if you'll speak it I'll speak it behind you and you'll have it right here can you imagine what was happening at that moment the spoken word was now being spoken for then God is demonstrating my word must come to pass you believed it now I'm going to honor you with her award she she wanted to give her little two mites her little twenty daughters brother Brandon said God had something bigger in store for her so here she is you say it I'll speak my word behind it and it'll come to pass right here eight people standing there looking at this situation now better Brands he said Brother Brad what shall I say he said it's up to you what are you gonna say what should I say Lord when you move on the scene you're speaking to me what do I say what's on our heart what's on the bride's heart what's on your heart you know it was on her heart she said there's said a crippled sister her aged father she was poor she could ask for money she could ask for anything she asked anything that's in your heart and you'll have it I said thus saith the Lord I'll speak behind you she said the salvation of my two boys I said you have it in the name of the Lord those two two modern teenage sniffle fits boys that hated the very cause of Christ grabbed one another and began to screen the blessings of God he said Hattie screams the two blocks could hear he's in the whole building trembled the power of God struck that place Banks fell to his plate I don't even know what happened for 10 minutes why because the power of God fell because a little sister a little bride said that's not saying the lord it's nothing but the truth and I believe it and God knew exactly what she was going to ask for he knew it she was gonna ask for so he could place that power in her and say what are you going to have what are you asking for I'm not looking for fame I'm not looking for Glory I'm looking for riches I'm looking for a life I'm looking for salvation and God says that's exactly what's in my heart because back at the beginning of time my spoken word was gonna go forth and create an original seed and so I'm going to prove that this day my word will speak life back into a people that's your reward that's the reward of this age you can speak it this word has power to bring life back into a dead child back into a dead spouse it happened for Hattie right it can happen again today I say who's going to believe who's going to believe when we stand to our feet it's your opportunity brother Brandon asks how do you write what are you looking for she said what do I say that Lord is saying tonight what's your need what's your need Wendy what is your cry what's your Mountain yeah oh no lord it's much too high speak the word of God is that what the song says speak the word

this mountain whosoever who's the whosoever who's whosoever that's you how do you write didn't know that was her at that moment she's just sitting listening like you were sitting listening this
