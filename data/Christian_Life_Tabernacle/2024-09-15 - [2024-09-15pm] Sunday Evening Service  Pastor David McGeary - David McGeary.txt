stored up but father the beautiful thing is accessible for everybody to go to the storehouse themselves and we'd encourage him to do that father we ask you to be with us in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen amen God bless you uh I want to read a scripture this evening and uh found in in U um I I believe if I'm not mistaken it's Isaiah the 14th chapter and the 12th verse um I I was trying to commit that to memory but uh I'm starting to find out that don't work the way it used to and uh I I know now that uh I I told somebody I said I used to be able to quote a scripture and tell you where it was I says now um I I quote this I quote the scripture but I have no idea where it was so uh yeah this is 1412 in the book of Isaiah I know you all know the scripture but we want to uh tie it in with this morning oh Thou Art fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which deth weaken the Nations for thou Hast said in thy heart I will Ascend un heaven and I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the cloud S I will be like the most high amen our gracious father we ask you to bless your word in your precious name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated evening we um excuse me a moment we certainly hope that uh uh you enjoyed the Simplicity of God's word this morning and and uh of course you know someone uh that little devil that climbs on your shoulder every time you do something you know he's always there talking you know what I mean but uh uh I thought well it's you know of it's just what he said and that's what we're after as well what he said so I want to read uh I want to continue in uh if our inspiration that we're we're getting it is out of the book Satan's Eden and I just felt in my heart just to take a few moments this evening Lord willing we won't be long just to read some of the statements and and just go over the understanding of really what our challenge is you know what is it that uh the Lord's looking at us and what it is he wants to see in us you know so many times the church uh we preach to the church that he wants to see people walking up and down the aisles of the hospital you know praying for the sick and he wants all kinds of signs and wonders and a and a manifestation of his spirit and and uh something that uh stands out you know something that you know we can say is a real move and uh I think as we listen to this and we read this uh and if you go back and take this tape and just spend a little bit of time reading it that's where brother Braham starts separating the two kingdoms which we referred to and we did that so our young people can get a visual too you know uh that we could start separating and understanding the existence of these two spirits in the framework not only in the framework of the world but in the framework of the church amen so uh the battle is going on right here and we know the battle going on in our minds because there's so many voices that is speaking to us and it takes a special type of Christian to be able to discern those voices and to be able to stand back and say to those voices that's not what he said that's not what he said and we got to remember that the deceitfulness of this age and so I'd like to start the brothers if they want to they can surely put these quotes up on the board and this is from Satan zeden and it's paragraph 15 and that Satan zeden was was uh preached August 29th 1965 at uh at the Tabernacle there in Jeffersonville random Tabernacle and and so uh he uh came back in the evening and I I I believe if I'm not mistaken that maybe brother Neville preached in the morning and then brother Bram came back and preached this in the evening and so he's talking about Christians and he's talking about the the day that we're living in and so if we just kind of went back a paragraph uh we can see here uh and I read the paragraph 13 about something that would help us see the picture so that's what we tried to do this morning is is draw the picture and the understanding that what hour we're living in we're living in an hour of of of voices trying to draw two different choices two different opinions uh two different Pathways uh two different ways to go and and that's way it's always been every Revival has had twins all down through time uh we could go through them you know Cain and Abel Jesus and Judas and in our day we have the Antichrist Spirit and the true spirit and these two in in our day it's so close but uh just to follow this down just for a few moments because we definitely want to meet the challenge that's set before us that that's what I I don't want to be doing God a service without it being his will I don't want to be excelling in certain things and those not be the things that are important to him you know what it is that he really would like to see from me uh you know it's like you know uh it's like if you went in and you went to your parents and you said well uh dad I washed the truck and I mowed the lawn and I stacked the wood and all this and he's sitting back he says but what I asked you to do is take out the trash you did all this stuff you know but now I'm stuck with the dirty trash you know and and he would would it his heart would have been so much more thrilled if you just take out the trash and then you did that and if you did anything above that well that's great but if you don't do what's asked of you then everything else you do really doesn't hold any value because he loves obedience more than he does sacrifice so let's just read this these things and maybe by the grace of God we can see the picture clearly so we read he says the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off you as much as you can now paragraph 14 now let us look now at this great for a few minutes this great sinful day that we're now living in and I don't believe there's ever was a day that I've ever read in history there's been great days of persecution when the children of God were put to death on every hand but to see the deceitfulness of the enemy we've never we've never had a day like this that we're living in now so he said I've seen the great days of the persecution of the church he said but I've never seen a day like we're living in now it's the most cunning deceitful day and when I see that it brings this that the Christian has to be more on his toe today than he has ever was in any other age so the first thing that that we we can see from the word of God that God wants us to be aware of the danger you know he wants us to be alert of the danger and and we don't usually hold that attitude or that atmosphere around us we we we think that that everything's peace and safety you know every place I go will be fine everything's good I live in America we everything's safe and and uh uh I I don't have any challenges out there but that's not exactly the way it is because he said we've got to be on our toes because it's it's just such a deceitful age uh you know a lot of people like to listen to the radio or or people talk and you know if you find the side that you like to listen to they're kind of saying the things that you like to hear boy you start leaning towards that and pretty soon that becomes truth to you and that's the way it is you know what I mean and you start leaning this way or you start leaning that way and they're both lies they're both run by the same people it's like tobacco companies the one tobacco company made all the cigarettes you know they didn't care how you smoke if they'll just say I'll put a charcoal filter on it you know and and and smoke this one charcoal filter and this cigarette's better than this cigarette and it's the same people making them you know they're just trying they're just trying for you to latch on to something that you can believe people are always looking for something to believe yeah you know I started collecting coins and I I I i' spent quite a bit of time uh collecting coins and so I began to read little more articles and then I found out these coins that I was collecting I had to be careful that they weren't counterfeit I said what this coin's got 1883 rod on on it you trying to tell me it could be fake yeah then they they started explaining all the different ways they make fake stuff you know uh I I'll just we just family I like Sunday night because it's family so I I went and put the offering in the church one time and I got done and the lady to come back and she said uh uh I had to reduce your offering $200 I said why you know I mean I counted it myself well I should have known if I counted it probably wrong anyway but and so she what she did is she she gave me back she said well she showed me here's two there were $200 bills that were put in the offering and they look good to me and if you turn them over it said movie money and it's money that they print that they use in movies you know what I mean and it got put in the offering you know what I mean I just wish the person would ass signed their name on it you know what I mean you know but I wanted them back you know I said I want back I want these counterfeit dollars back oh said we're not allowed to give them back I said why not she said well you'll go spend them and what happens the deceit continues on and so you you you know so we hear stories and we hear things and we continue to uh you you know to uh carry on the deceit you you know we keep sharing it out and perpetuating it and and it it begins to continue to one and all those things start to begin to shape in your mind and shape in your attitudes and shap in your approach coach and and uh uh and so all of a sudden you found out there's things in your foundation that you're building on that aren't true and the one of the principles of the Gospel is you have to have the Chief Cornerstone and that we're consider watch Every Man how he builds there upon Paul was actually telling the church the church as it began to build you've got to watch what you put in this Foundation James said there's many amongst us that are are spots and wrinkles in the feast you know they come to the feast and and what do they do they defile many so you this awareness that we have to have is there's two things that we've got to start understanding really to go forward because I want the church to go forward you know we're not trying to take the church back to the Pentecostal age you know what I mean where the blessings flow freely where the Revival was there uh this is more of a day of an individual Affair and of the great conductor uh taking each individual and giving them the score to play in their life and then when all those different parts come together it's a beautiful picture and and so this this age that uh that we're living in is so cunning deceitful day and have to be more on our toes so we we got to actually filter everything we hear it ought to be a the first question asked about everything is this the word of God is this the will of God because God's will always lines up with his word filter it through the word of God go back to what the messenger said go back to what your scriptures say pray about it ask for Revelation pray for Revelation but it what happens we just start taking things for granted and you know that's you just got to go the extra mile but listen to this this really struck me if uh he said now back in the days of the persecution of Rome to the church a Christian make a mistake he went into the arena and was fed to the Lions or something like that when they found him of being a Christian for his testimony but his soul was saved because he he was purely unadulterated believer in God and gladly sealed sealed his testimony with his blood so it didn't matter he might have made lots of mistakes but when it came down to denying the faith he gladly sealed his testimony with his blood and that was attributed to him for salvation you know and and so the Catholic church has always perpetuated that all down Through the Ages the greatest thing you could be is be a martyr you know die for the faith die for the faith die for the faith well what good is it do you to die to the faith if you're not living the faith but that was the time that they lived in he said and and as the veins let loose and the holes in his body and the bleeding blood bled out he would scream up from with a real loyal faithful and say receive my spirit Lord Jesus but now now that's what we have to understand so we're looking what's God looking at us what's what's he trying to place us what really is the fight we're not in the fight against the Lions we're not in the fight against the uh the Our Testimony everybody's a Christian now so he said but now the cunn of the devil now makes the people believe that they are Christians when they're not now don't get in the idea that because we believe the message it's always out there you know oh that's them that's them that's you guys that's there no this is speak when when this was preached there wasn't churches like we had today there wasn't quote unquote messages these were people from every denomination they were still going to church they were still in they a few of them would come to the Tabernacle when brother Brandon would preach a meeting they would come into the meetings brother Bram was going around bringing his message but there was no group of people that had gathered together around this message and had a a understanding that that he just wasn't was n a prophet in the form of a five-fold Ministry Prophet but he was a messenger revealing the Mysteries so you just can't sit in here and say oh yeah that's everybody else no I've got to take that and say wait a minute is Satan making me feel like I'm a Christian when I'm not how do I judge that how do I measure that how do I determine that how do I determine whether something's counterfit or not and you know back just for the example of my con I found out that the only way you can keep away from that if you buy the certified package sealed coin in in the proper container you know and and that's the safest and best way not to make sure that you're getting deceived and and that I think that's a good thing for us we want to take a Vindicated word not an intellectual word but so he goes on here he say he said the Christian when they're not there's the thing okay there's the thing so you you talk to yourself so what is it there's the thing that's what he do he makes you feel that everything's all right and when you think everything's all all right you quit examining it you know that they have something called uh I think it's called P&M periodical maintenance that if you you just you got to go down and check the grease you you just can't think oh this is just running everything's fine it's just going to keep going no you better you better check it you better make sure it's working you better look at the sockets the sprockets the the press the pumps the Hydraulics you got to you got to sit back and look at it and make sure it's running that's why on your cars you know they they they're going to give you a warranty out here I bought a a 100,000 mile yeah missing oil change bye that ain't no good no more you know mare $30,000 thing yeah you go on there I'm here for my $30,000 checkup and they go back to your car we just completed your $330,000 checkup that would be $1,200 and then you go for your 60,000 and they want to replace your timing belt you know and do all this that's another 20,000 you know but if you don't everything's void and God's got a warranty and his warranty is I'll keep my word that's his warranty but you've got to pursue it according to his word you can't take something that's out of context you can't something that's not interpreted right and present it to God as something that he's got to warranty and that's why so many people are feel that God fails them they they they they feel that they're not moving in their lives because they're taking their own idea and they're presenting it to God as God you said you would warranty this God will only warranty what he said sir and it's got to be in the spirit that he said it it's got to be in the season that he said it it's got to be in the right time the right place it's all the five must have got to be there and you know we're about the only generation of people has had anybody ever explained to them that God's word's got five musts and then we want promises to come to pass in our lives we want to see God move but we don't want to move according to the way God wants us to move it's because we've had so much influence so many other voices it's such a cunning day you know we just feel that if we we do something that we don't feel like wait a minute I I really need to measure this I need to find out that if I've got this in its right spot you know I've seen people just hang on to promises and I never even thought the promises applied that way and then look go around and sit down with them and and and take a little time and then go back and find a much simpler promise that fit their situation and oh it's so simple it's always simple it's always simple so we're we're we're we're talking just don't don't lose me this evening what my point is my point is is what challenge are we meeting for this age okay and uh so we just wanted to stay on that thought a little bit he says he said he said it's so cunning the devil has said it so cunning it's a more cunning day that it would be than when you ever had to seal your life away with your testimony the devil has set every cunning trap that he can to he's a deceiver and Jesus told us in Matthew 24 now this day would be that we're living in the most deceitful day that ever lived so close that it would deceive the very elect of God if it were possible for him to deceive so we we sit back and and we we realize that that we can we can go all the way back to what we talked about this morning that when when Eve was given the word of God and Satan showed up and started drawing another picture surely you won't die surely you'll grow surely you'll go in wisdom sure surely you'll go he's always he always takes the word of God and misconstrues it right so we're we're sitting back so what's our challenge our challenge is to be able to discern the word of God now this is this is quite a statement that I'm going to read here in a moment let's just let's just uh read it he says and this is paragraph 23 he says look back here in my text tonight Satan was the one that preached the word to Eve first God hath said he walks up he preaches the word God said this God said that you know well wait a minute is there a hook in there you know where's he where's where's this going where where you you know what what's what's it pointing to what's the point of it you know and if if and the thing about it is is God's his own interpreter so you don't need someone to explain it to you go back and take this tape read it go through it paragraph by paragraph and you'll find out this is exactly what he's saying God's got a true Vindicated word and you've got Satan preaching another gospel right alongside of this one and he appears as an angel of Light and he's cunning and he's smart and he's sharp and he's deceitful so you know what God's looking from his children from the Eve that we are is they he is looking for someone that when they hear that cunning voice they say no he said the eat the day I eat thereof I'll die he said oh surely you won't die wait a minute he said I'd Die I Die end the story that simple I'm not going to listen I'm not going to argue I'm not getting a discussion with you I I'm not going to try to uh uh straighten you out and I'm not going to try to make it work okay you it's like some you got to give me more than that's like when somebody's trying to sell you something you know you got you got to give me more than that and then they'll come up with the next lie and the next lie and pretty soon you're saying I just bought a bag of fertilizer I was like I just throw it in the backyard and a whole Garden's going to spring up this is the greatest stuff in the world Propet God talked about the dishes he ran home and got the dish soap you know and he saw it on the commercial he just dropped the dish in there and you squirted the soap anybody remember that commercial B old and and boy the soap went went down you could see it go down the water and then the dishes would just the dirt would just start coming off of the dishes floating up and then the person reached in the water and pulled out this sparkling clean thing no scrubbing no nothing so he went bought he wanted to try some of that stuff so he walks in and says sister I'll do the dishes today don't worry honey I got it and he put him in the pan shot that stuff in there and walked in there and sat down she said wait I thought you said you go don't worry they're they're just fine you know he goes back in there and he's got a sink full of dirty dishes and you know what bothered them the most was that they got away with selling that kind of stuff you know and you know the great sermon thinking men's filter you know the lie that oh this has got a filter on it you you know what I mean he he said nobody's thinking that smokes that's for sure and so it's the most deceitful day is possible now so we said that Satan was the first one to preach so the very first thing Satan started doing was what misconstruing the word of God so he said this that it's that misconstruing that part of the scripture that applies to the day he'll let you know know all Jesus did was perfectly well he'll let you know all that Moses did was perfectly well but when you take the promises that they gave for this day and then was applied to and then that was applied to another age that's just all he has to do see is to get the people to believe it that way and that's all all you got to get the people to believe was that's for another age that's for another time that that that oh that's let me misconstrue it just a little bit and and here what brother Ram was trying to get to us so many times and he preached it over and over again the word says exactly what it says it doesn't need any interpretation it wasn't given to be understood it was given to be believed and it's given in such a way that only the elected believer can take it the way that it's given so that sets you off to be an oddball already because you're hearing something oh they someone said you explain that to me I just believe it like the man said he said well I don't believe that he said that's because you're an unbeliever you don't have anything in you to believe it with if you're a Healer go down and empty the hospital that's not the way it works that's not the way it works we think we prove God by challenging God by commanding God I had a man enrolled me in the Full Gospel businessman I I think I'm a member I don't know if you can get off it or not but anyway so I I found out I was a Full Gospel so I got invited out to dinner I think lesie was with me and and so we go we think we're going out to dinner well we are going out to dinner but we're going to a Full Gospel businessman's dinner so we get in there and we're sitting there and and and uh uh I'll just be honest with you so they have a visiting Minister and he's a spiritual chiropractor this like absolutely the truth I I want you to understand the kind of things people are buying into kitster come here I need to use you here my little Deacon buddies okay so this guy would walk up to the people this is going on in church you understand with hundreds of businessman Believers and they're buying this you know some people will believe a lie when the truth sounds better and he's going up and down their back he's doing spiritual chiropr he says oh I feel this little this is a this is the spirit of such and such I I just made a spiritual adjustment have you ever tried to make a spiritual adjustment in your life I'll guarantee in as simple as someone pressing on your back thinking they found a spirit and then spiritually adjusting you and then he goes down o ooh kitster I I see a little bit of a a little bit of sometimes you get mad at your sister she she gave me a $10 offering telling me you needed a spiritual adjustment on that now you're adjusted now your sister's just the sweetest thing you've ever met in your life and you'd do anything for her and you'd stay out of her room right and this is actually going on well there's stuff that's going on right in our that has no basis in the word of God at all that's that's right I appreciate it brother Danny just bringing a lot of it out everybody getting in this spirit that they want a word spoken over I don't want any word spoken over me other than the word that William brandham spoke over me how do I need prophecy if I've got a pre-planned life see those were all the questions that were left uncovered in this puzzle of Satan's Eden so they had to inject all kinds of stuff to get stuff fixed because they couldn't put the scriptures together because the keys were missing but when the seals were open it became a new book and we saw it right before this is never what God was after he was never after a church that was full of power he was after a church that was full of obedience that's what he wanted he didn't need great stylish preachers he needed preachers that would tell the truth from their place of experience and that's what that's what that was what Paul even said oh we got many teachers but we don't have many fathers we don't have many Elders you know and so uh this this great kindness that he's got this great misconstruing of the word of God now they'll go back to everything Moses is perfect Everything Jesus say perfect but when it comes down to now for you moving into a place where you can be that word oh well that's that's not for you you know nobody you can't be number one if everybody's number one you can't be the big eye you know what I mean unless there's little use there's no lad in this we're just going to continue reading we'll get done here in just a moment and I want you to follow this thought through because he's tell telling us something here and we've we've and I don't know whether it's I that this is just the time that we've got to come to the consciousness of where we are you understand that we've assembled ourselves we've got together we've complimented one another we've patted one another on the back and we all agree that we're it sounds like hide and seek and that's exactly what's what's going on you know everybody's hiding and seeking hiding what they're really going on in their life hiding all their secrets you know what I mean and and and and the the depth of personal honesty is what the church needs more than ever and you know why because he's not against you he's for you if you got a problem he already knows it all he's do is waiting for you to come to him for help yes and he promised he wouldn't turn you away he would no wise turn you away you know if you find yourself on the wrong road you find yourself in a trap you know don't be ashamed that's the Zeal of this age to say I'm wrong I'm sorry I taught something that wasn't right I believed something that right right I did something that wasn't in his will you know I I I I got carried away that that's what he's looking for he's just looking for real genuine Christian honesty someone that wants to line their lives up with the word of God and and but that's just not very popular you know it's it's it it's just you know that I just get Satan is just like he said he's so cunning he lets people believe they have the Holy Spirit if they speak in tongues or you got it well what happened was all the people that had it weren't living like they had it so now they came up with another Doctrine whatever state you die in is the state you're going in you mean so I can be a Christian for 45 years have one day of downfall and if that's the state I die in I'm out of here forget it I'm going to live like a devil till the day I think I'm going to die and I'm going to get the Holy Ghost that day I mean you but you know that's exactly how they would think that ain't a love affair that isn't having a God in your life that's trying to weasle your way into heaven that's not what this is about it's about a real true understanding that I'm a son and daughter of God God I've been chosen I've been elected I've been set aside you know he he's done all this for me he's trying to he's trying to find my place in in his eternal plan that he had for me I'm not a part of this world I'm in it but I'm not of it and he goes on here he says let's just follow him through we'll try to close up he said that'll apply to another age that's just all he has to do is to get the people to believe it that way and that's all you cannot take one word away from it or add one word to it but that's what he does I don't know if we're as bad of taking away as as we are adding to we do it all the time we take part of a quote and part of another quote and we make a new quote out of it or we take an idea from this message and an idea from that message and we create a new message I I I I I just sharing with my heart with you tonight uh you know we don't have as many people here but it the the truth of the matter I I like if I read a a text I like to stay in the text if you're going to read a message read it you know don't Don't just run to the computer and pull out this quote and run over here and pull out that quote and then all of a sudden you got all these quotes now you're going to put them together for the people and then you find out that that's good for the sermon that's good for the service it's good for the excitement it's good for the inspiration it's good to have have everybody stand and Shout that's all good but it doesn't work in your everyday life all of a sudden you you you walk out you've got you're you're on fire you've got all kinds of good intentions but you don't have no substance that'll stick you to the ground you know and that that what we become we become so spiritual that we're of no earthly value and that's not what God's looking at now more than ever he's looking at real genuine daily lived hour byour lives with the right atmosphere the right Spirit the right nature the right approach loving people that they come in contact with I had somebody send out a a a a message to I I don't know what text place has followers have you ever what is that that's got followers um is it Facebook that you have friends and followers or whatever and so they they sent out this great thing well I'm I'm on such and such date I'm going to Christian Life Tabernacle and I guess just the Lord you know let me know it I said well that's wonderful you know and when they used to be a member and you know now they've shaved their head and have a mohawk and and you know they're I think they're a part of the LBG Community I'm not sure you know why I want I just welcome them I would really welcome them not going to stop in the door I'm glad they're here you know why because they finally found out what they are this is what they want to be this is what they feel they are this is what what they want they didn't want to conform with the world they don't want to look like everybody else they want to be what they are they want to stand out for what they stand for they're going to put on the armor that they have that that's what I am and I'm out of the closet and I'm here to tell you that this is what I am this is what I believe this is the way I feel it is thank you now let's us come out of the closet and be the Christians in the uncompromising iing principles to the word of God sure there's a contrast there's a big contrast that's the trouble with the church today it's luk warm I would that you either be hot or cold but if you're lukewarm I'll spill you out of your mouth you got no problem with where that sister stands I thank her for got guts I hated Jimmy Johnson because he took Tom Landry's place you know I'm glad I got away from all that I didn't even know they played today you know and to me they're just what they've always been a bunch of losers but I I just couldn't just couldn't stand Jimmy Johnson then one day I heard Jimmy Johnson make a statement he said I gave my whole life up for football from that day I like that guy he admitted I sold my soul to football Hallelujah if that's what you do I think that's good I think you ought to sell out that's right that's what the in the first church when ananas and surviv come up what didn't they do they didn't sell out Peter said why do you try to deceive the holy ghost acting like you're sold out when you're not got a little Reserve going on got a little private life going on got a little this going on a little that little fingers and this fingers and that you know what I mean got all all your little tentacles out you know in the church and got this person doing this for you and that person doing that for you and and if you're all webbed in here you're not hiding nothing you can hide it from me but you're not hiding it from the one that matters but that's the hour that we're in and he goes on he says you can't take one word away from my said now listen this people ignorantly worship Satan thinking that they're worshiping God as we are warned by the prophecy in 2 Thessalonians that let us just read that second Thessalonians 7 chapter let us just get in a moment if I can right away I'd like to read that just believe second Thessalonians I got the scripture here in second now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of the Lord Jesus and by the Gathering Together unto him now see the coming of the Lord and the Gathering to him as God will gather his people to him in the last days the Gathering of the people to the Lord not to the church Church to the Lord Gathering Together unto him boy we've got more Church Gathering than we have people Gathering to him this is where he wants us to gather gather to him Lord where's my part where's my peace where's my place what would you have me to do but it's easy We Gather to the church and we have the our attitude is we're in the message well I thank God for everybody that believes this message and that identifies thems with the pillar of fire I I I I think that's admirable but don't stop there stop until it BEC so genuine to you so personal to you and you got to know for yourself I'm telling a lot of stories but that's okay there's a fellow we knew that he identified with the message he'd come to church and and and everybody called him brother and everybody accepted them in the message and so one night we had a a little get together and everybody this brother this brother and just a great brother and and face value just suck him as a brother brother well you know he got in with all the brothers and they were all sitting in the front room 15 of them and and the good brother well I knew the brother so I just thought you know what everybody's just so willing to accept him and not ask any question not even think nothing I'm just going to let him talk so he got in there with all the ver and then be started explaining to him the day the Martians came down and he got in the spaceship and he went up in the spaceship and he started explaining to him about the controls and about the Martians and than how that they were uh amongst us right now and and that was really what the Antichrist Spirit was it was Martian spirits and you know and all you had to do is give him a little bit of rope you know it's just like that guy that was at the Corral I'm a preacher I got the gospel I can preach yet let him get a rope but when that real Bronco shows up he said now you want you a rider he said no I don't think I'm a rider you know he wore that old horse out that old plow meal went out west right moved out west and now he got to the Corral and I'm a rider boy all of a sudden he found out he wasn't a rider cuz you know what the enemy is always a lot bigger than you think he is he's more decept more cunning more deceitful he sets traps he does everything I mean he he is absolutely we ought to be in the fear of God with what we're dealing with in this age and that's what God's looking for he's looking for a people that are going to pull right up to his word that's going to saap what he says that are going to gathered unto him not the church not here to be taught not here to hear this shouldn't be the only place you hear the message you shouldn't be receiving your inspiration from this Pulpit Only We Gather here together to stir up our Pure Minds by way of remembrance and to bring to you remembrance of what the prophet said the things that he said to do the the things you got to look for in your life but when it comes back down to it comes to an individual a walk with him and you've got to set your course in the revealed word of the hour that's got to be your molder and there's no man that could come in this pulpit and preach you this whole message in an hour sermon or longer if he's the pastor you can't do it you know what I mean this can't be your only contact in other words he didn't gather you under the church if the church could do it he would have said it he would have told us if it were so I would have told you so it's not so so if God's looking at us tonight he's looking at you looking at your own life judging your own life looking in the Yum Thunder of the word in your life and you lining your own life up that's what's so important to him and that's the age and time that's what's God's looking for not what you can let anybody else know because as far as I'm concerned every one of you's going in the Rapture every one of you met the requirements every one of you has a Halo on your head every one of you is trying to serve god with your whole heart you're the only one that knows what you got in your back pocket and that's what God's looking for you to deal with your own personal fears your personal doubts your personal problems if I can help you I'd be happy to try to go through the word of God with you and do whatever I can for you but the ultimate choice is the choice of your heart and that's what God's looking on where do you stand for me as an individual and he just longs to see that just manifested in your life and it and and that's hard when all of a sudden it's not a group Affair you know and sometimes you have to go against the grain but you know in your heart you're steadfast with the word of God God and we'll just and he says not the church but the Lord Gathering Together unto him that that ye be soon that you be not soon shakened in your mind troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter from us as the day of the Lord is at hand he says let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and the man of of sin the man of sin which is what he is now the man of sin be revealed the son of predition what that's what Judas is see who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God and that the worshipper that is worshiped so that as God sth in the temple of God he showeth himself self that he is God the deceitfulness of the Church of today the son of predition the devil the son of predition the devil then people worship Satan in this day thinking they're worshiping God but they're worshiping him through a Creed man-made denominations Creeds that's brought the people right down to the greatest deception that the world has ever ever known of no matter how much the word of God promises for this day it's preached and Vindicated they still won't believe it they won't believe it why we wonder why why doesn't it why wouldn't they believe it when God said he would do a certain thing and he does it and they still turn their back from it and turn away from it as just as even knew that what God Said God would do but she turned her back on it to listen to what he had to say oh you know what he is looking he's looking for people that don't listen to what he has to say no matter what it is and and and then he goes it's been now Satan establishes his kingdom in the earth exactly what he's doing if he wants to establish his own kingdom and which we talked about this morning and then we'll just close just with a couple statements maybe five more minutes he said and and this is the way it was and he says so God knew that we would be here and this is paragraph 54 he said uh he knew that we'd be here and uh he wanted to uh be here he put us in flesh so we would be contacted in order he could contact us he could become one of us when he become Jesus Christ the son of God himself fell the fullness of the manifestation of God therefore that was God's purpose is to display his attributes in Fellowship and then 56 he says and as the children of God were a part of go God's attributes that was in him made flesh like he was made flesh so we can have Fellowship one with another as a family of God upon the Earth and that was God's purpose at the beginning that was what he wanted at the beginning so at the beginning he he wanted a family you understand and he it wasn't that he wasn't drawing people to the church he wanted them to be a family so he didn't want us just to be a church family and other words we come together as a church we meet here as a church we do things as a church no he wanted you to have a Christian family life and fellowship with the brothers and sisters in your life he they'll know that you are my disciples as your love one for another you just don't want to hide your life in church you understand you want to you want to let what you are reach out and reach out to the Lost reach out to the lonely reach out to the Brokenhearted reach out to those that are in need there a Consciousness and awareness of that you're a part of a family and not part of a church and boy I really feel with all my heart that's really something we've got to really become more of aware of of the part that we are in a body and what we play one to another and that's why the prophet of God was so opposed to clicks little groups in the framework of the church and and and circles and you got to you've got to do this in yourself this is what God's looking at so you say well is God looking at me yes what's he looking to see what's he looking to find he's looking to see you obeying his word he's looking to see you draw a bigger Circle he's looking to see you to take care of the family of God we've almost preached it like God's looking for us to understand all the Mysteries that's what he's looking for he's looking for you to get the message get the Mysteries get the teachings get the doctrine this is what you oh you I'm a Son of God I believe all the word you know the word the word the word I've heard people say the word the word the word so much it brings me to the place I don't even think they know what the word is the word is not a word it is a person the word is that person's thoughts expressed he didn't want you to know what he said he wanted to know for you to know why he said it and that only comes with the Capstone and the love of God shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit we're missing Paul said it though I understand all the Mysteries I speak with tongues of men and angels I Lay My Hands on the sick and I have not charity I am nothing I have not love and I don't want us in this hour to miss really what what we're being measured by we're not being measured by our knowledge of the seals book though I believe that knowledge is extremely helpful and I think that all of us should have a part of our life that we go through the church ages and the seals and listening the tapes and making contact with the word of God but he's really looking for genuine Christianity to be on display just that daily simple lack of frustration lack of anger just the joy of the Lord the love of God shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit just that great simple things he says he says and that's what he wanted that's what he always wanted was just a family of God and then we know exactly what happened you know Satan exalted himself he succeeded in putting himself above the people he started reigning over the people's lives and that's kind of been the way it's ever since and I just like to close with this statement he said and this is paragraph 80 and there's so many more I could read he said what if your father told you and you are a loyal son to your father and he told you son don't you go in that water out there swimming because there's Gators in the water and the fellow comes back and says surely such pretty water as that there is no Gators in it now who are you going to listen to if you're a genuine son you'll listen to your daddy a genuine son and daughter of God takes God's word first I don't care what anybody else says about it they take God's word first there is poison in the cup and they believe it have faith in all his work his seed bought Eden of Holiness love and eternal life that's what God's Eden produced Holiness and it brought an Eden of Holiness of love understanding Perfection and eternal life that's what God is planting his word his seed that's what his church will be at the end it'll be the same thing so if that's what he planted loyalness love I didn't see a lot of things listed in there that were trying to cultivate in the church it's simple let's keep it simple God said so I believe it everybody had this Bible everybody was coming up with a different interpretation God said in this book that as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man behold in the day of the voice of the seventh angel behold I have send you Elijah the prophet and you you those scriptures he shed light on those for you and you saw them and you saw this messenger this young man from uh Kentucky and that the angel came to and he told you his life story and he told the story but he just didn't leave the story there he backed it up he discerned the thoughts and intents of the heart he re impersonated the same vindications that Jesus had the same works the same signs and wonders laid it out there for us so we perfectly know what he said to be true and now we've got the same cunning devil trying to tell us what he said what he meant how it's to be interpreted and I'll tell you something that God interprets his word by bringing it to pass he it there there is there's there should be no Pulpit between the voice and the ear of the hearer you've got to make sure of that for yourself God wanted us to assemble together he wanted us to Fellowship around his word he put five-fold Ministry in I believe in all of those things and they have their place but they don't become the totalitar of what that you are as a Believer he's not drawing you to the church he's drawing you to himself and that's what you've got to that's what he's looking for he's looking for Sons and Daughters of God that stand up they identify themselves in the voice they identify themselves who's been leading and they're sticking with that word regardless of what anybody else says regardless of the circumstances that befall them their life identifies and they're not ashamed to say where they stand and I always love this and I'm understanding it more than more you can't separate the message from the messenger because that's the part that he's judging you by I've accepted what he done as my absolute and you've got to make that decision for yourself people don't want that they want to say I'm led by the Holy Spirit Well I'm follower of the messenger as he was a follower of Christ I know it's the word because the the holy spirit is Jesus was the Holy Spirit it's that same person back leading Us in spirit form instead of Flesh form it's not a second person the holy spirit is not a person in fact the Holy Spirit didn't even come to speak of himself we we talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit but what we're talking about is the end dwelling Spirit of the Lord Jesus the Same nature the same attitude the same thing the same attributes you don't want anointing and that's why he taught us about the anointed ones at the end time they have the anointing but they don't have that genuine word connection so you say what's God really looking at for me in this day the two pictures are being drawn Satan's sitting on his Eden Throne he's the God of this evil age and you're a called out people what is it that he's looking for what in my life is he looking for is he looking for power he don't need power he's got all the power you'll ever need when you need it he got us covered he's looking for children and that's what he said God's children obey his word in other words they do what he said if he said there's alligators in that water you don't go there if he said don't fellowship with it you don't fellowship with it if he said apply the token you apply the token boy that's it it I don't know why it's so simple but yet it's so hard but that's really what he's Desiring in this day and that's how you'll find your place in the great picture is by obedience to the word of the Lord will lead you the prophet of God said obedience to the word of God entitles you to the Holy Ghost amen and I I just trust in my own simple way because uh you know I I I'll be honest you I'm extremely proud of our congregation I'm extremely proud of our people the love that you have one for another so let's stay on point I think that's what they say right stay on course let's let's keep what's most important that we believe this word that spoken to us and we're not just Believers but we're obey years of the word of God let's separate ourselves from the world the things of the world and watch your your strength and your the and the love and the fellowship we have in the love divine grow and so I just wanted to finish off this morning's message with that let's stand I hope I wasn't too long long this evening but uh a wonderful message if you want to take the time just to study it out Satan's Eden you say where am I living you're living in Satan's Eden the God of this evil age and he's cunning deceiving and he's after me but I got a cliff of the rock I got the word god couldn't give me anything better than his word uh the greatest battle ever ever fought if God could give you another weapon other than his word he would have given to him he can give you nothing greater than his word his word will get you through church amen and just let the love of God just be so full of your heart let's pray our gracious heavenly [Music] father as you told Peter he said stir up the People by way of remembrance bring into their minds the things that we were warned of and Lord we're looking at this time we're in the condition of our country what's going on I cannot make sense of it Lord but you told me I don't have to make sense of it I don't have to understand the world or the things of the world I don't even have to listen I just set my heart on you I set my heart on what it is that you're speaking I set my heart on the message that you have given Lord and that becomes my source of information it becomes my source of leadership I see you standing in every word that you spoke I see you in every scripture and if I don't I go back and read it again because you're drawing your church unto you you're drawing your Believers unto you and you you have a path for each of us you have a place for each of us in your great plan and you told us nobody can take our place nobody can fulfill the great picture the great puzzle you're putting together with all your Believers and if there's one piece missing the picture is not complete and father you don't have incomplete thoughts and incomplete prophecies and in complete promises everything is perfect and Lord I just maybe been preaching to myself today which I could certainly use it Lord just need you placed so much more in headship and I just ask that you grant it to me father and anybody else in the building tonight that desires just to come into that word leadership that they just lift their hands to you and say Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and those were the great words that were spoken that brought you forth in Mary a type of the bride and we speak it too Let It Be according to thy will word
