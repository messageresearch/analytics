[36:29] lead us Lord this morning in Jesus
[36:31] Christ's name we ask it
[36:37] [Music]
[36:47] amen morning brothers and sisters I just
[36:50] wanted to give a short little testimony
[36:53] um God's just hand of protection on my
[36:56] life and um
[36:58] um my job affords me the ability to
[37:00] drive around sometimes and go places
[37:03] that I haven't always seen But I take
[37:06] the opportunity for the long drives to
[37:09] be able to listen to messages and uh I
[37:11] was last Tuesday heading to Vernon from
[37:14] Fort Worth and U yeah just looking for a
[37:17] message to listen to and uh something
[37:19] came on my heart and I know brother Bram
[37:22] says that the devil hates uh anything
[37:24] that has to do with the book of Genesis
[37:25] or Revelations I was listening to uh
[37:29] something on Revelations and I was a
[37:31] little distracted in my driving but
[37:34] essentially I was on the 287 North um
[37:37] past buoy and it's a very open stretch
[37:39] of road and uh so you know I maybe had
[37:42] my head down I was in the Middle Lane
[37:44] fting with the speaker maybe looking at
[37:47] the text and kind of focusing on my
[37:50] driving and um there was very clear
[37:54] traffic like I said and there was a
[37:55] there was a truck in the in the U in the
[37:58] slow lane and I was in the middle of him
[38:00] and I looked up and next thing I know
[38:02] this big rig just Veer right in front of
[38:04] me and uh I had my head down I looked up
[38:06] and the Lord just helped me just jerk
[38:09] that wheel and if I'd have been in my uh
[38:12] exteria probably would have flipped and
[38:14] rolled because it's top heavy but work
[38:16] rigs little r for it it bit the tire and
[38:20] it just wobbled but the Lord just kind
[38:22] of was there and had his hand of
[38:24] protection and uh luckily I I SW big you
[38:27] know how the back trunks are they they
[38:29] have a rail that's almost head level on
[38:32] a small vehicle and so it could have
[38:34] been very bad but uh the Lord just
[38:38] brought my head up very fast and I just
[38:40] reacted and pulled the wheel and and uh
[38:43] yeah it was just the Lord's hand of
[38:44] protection and then uh the rest of the
[38:47] day the devil harassed me it was very
[38:48] apparent and I just kept a positive
[38:50] attitude and thank God and uh I ended up
[38:53] not have I got to the facility and many
[38:56] of you might know I do MO Mobile X-Ray
[38:58] and um the the the machine wouldn't even
[39:01] work which is 4 and a/2 years I haven't
[39:03] been able to troubleshoot a machine I
[39:04] mean it just every single thing he kept
[39:06] harassing me even pulling the patient up
[39:08] and so I apologized and told my dispatch
[39:11] and drove home and got to listen to
[39:12] three messages that day didn't have one
[39:14] patient and uh just thank the Lord uh
[39:17] the whole way home and um had a
[39:19] wonderful rest of the of the day and I
[39:22] just wanted to just let you guys know
[39:24] that uh he's the same today yesterday
[39:27] today forever and I get a little nervous
[39:29] I could talk to people individually but
[39:31] getting up amongst the the lady gets me
[39:34] a little nervous so but I just felt the
[39:35] Lord wanted me to to share with you guys
[39:38] that and his hand of protection and and
[39:40] we've had a lot of uh wonderful
[39:41] testimonies in the church lately of of
[39:44] just God moving on the scene and being
[39:46] present right now not yesterday not
[39:48] tomorrow but but right now and his his
[39:51] hand of protection and the angels that
[39:53] are encamped about us and and I I just
[39:55] felt the presence of the Lord just
[39:57] really in the vehicle the rest of the
[39:58] day it was pretty Supernatural so I just
[40:01] wanted to thank you and share that

[48:53] thank the Lord for sparing my wife for
[48:56] another year
[48:57] here brother Boaz Nim writes I bless the
[49:01] name of the Jesus Christ today I stand
[49:04] before you with a heart full of
[49:05] gratitude to God for blessing me with
[49:08] his this new job and the opportunity to
[49:11] grow and succeed I also want to thank
[49:14] each one of you for your unwavering
[49:16] support and encouragement thank you what
[49:19] a wonderful God we
[49:22] serve very mindful of our Desir Lord
[49:26] whether it's worth no matter how small
[49:29] we think it is he cares about him we'll
[49:32] ask brother Andrew to come up here and
[49:34] pray for the tithes and offerings and I
[49:37] don't have any requests up here but if
[49:39] you have one on your heart make it known
[49:41] to the Lord by the uplifting of your
[49:43] hands and trust that this isn't just for
[49:46] an ordinance sake but he sees the hand
[49:49] it's the effort you make to defy gravity
[49:51] that causes the Lord to come on the
[49:53] scene and he has a short testimony to
[49:56] give
[50:03] good
[50:05] morning we're needy people aren't
[50:08] we you know thank the Lord that he's so
[50:11] mindful of us that he promised that he
[50:13] would meet us here and I'm just here to
[50:15] give a short testimony and um some of
[50:19] you know my testimony um back in 2006
[50:24] after uh traveling um from Trinidad and
[50:27] Tobago I contracted menitis and it was
[50:31] um something that the Lord worked out so
[50:33] that I can get to the end of the road
[50:34] for my own will and things like that
[50:36] just to make a short testimony out of it
[50:40] um trying not to get too emotional about
[50:42] it
[50:44] but you know whenever you come to that
[50:47] crossroads in life where you're so
[50:50] broken I believe that's the place that
[50:52] God wants every single one of us so that
[50:55] so that no long long will it be you but
[50:58] it'll be the Lord and so um in February
[51:03] 2006 um like I said it's a long
[51:06] testimony but I'll just get to the point
[51:08] I just um after all of the the doctors
[51:12] and everything they didn't give very
[51:13] much hope and so I just prayed a simple
[51:16] prayer Lord if you let me live I'll
[51:17] continue to serve you all the rest of my
[51:19] days no more arguing and so a couple of
[51:23] weeks or excuse me a couple months later
[51:26] um it was around Easter time and the
[51:29] company that I was working for contract
[51:31] some help for me on the other side and
[51:35] they um had three helpers that were
[51:37] going to help me and so I'm
[51:41] I'm I'm at the job and this is in
[51:44] Wisconsin and so I meet the people to
[51:47] help me and we start doing the job and I
[51:49] was only going to be there two days and
[51:51] um the first day I kind of had my
[51:53] schedule all booked up I was going to
[51:55] meet a friend there but but while I was
[51:57] there and uh I got to meeting uh um
[52:01] talking with one of the helpers that was
[52:03] helping me uh we got to fellowshipping a
[52:05] little bit about the Lord and you know I
[52:08] had plans that Friday night to go
[52:10] somewhere else and uh you know the Lord
[52:12] just moved on my heart in a simple way
[52:14] and said why don't you ask him if he
[52:16] knows of a place where I can get some
[52:18] fish you know cuz I believe you know
[52:20] Wisconsin and some up in Northeast
[52:23] whatever they have great fish and so
[52:26] I I ended up asking him I said do you
[52:28] know there's a place where I can get
[52:30] some good fish and he's like you know
[52:32] you know down over there by this way and
[52:34] that way and I'm just like oh you know I
[52:37] guess I wasn't used to Google and
[52:39] everything by that time that was a long
[52:40] time ago but you know the the thing is
[52:44] is he said
[52:46] well you know I was like I don't know
[52:49] where that's at and so the Lord just
[52:50] kind of put it on my heart well ask him
[52:52] if he would take you and so I asked him
[52:56] and he's like like well you know what
[52:57] let me call my wife I I have already
[52:59] plans and so let me call and see and
[53:02] I'll I'll let you know and so he come
[53:04] back and he canceled his plans with his
[53:06] wife and then I called my friend I
[53:08] canceled my plans and so we ended up uh
[53:11] going out to dinner and he showed me
[53:13] this uh you know this place but I'm just
[53:15] here to testify to you that it was in an
[53:18] unexpected time and an unexpected place
[53:21] that God chose to use this individual to
[53:24] share the message with me to give me the
[53:27] church age book to give me the greatest
[53:29] battle ever fought Eagle stir his nest
[53:31] and the stature of a perfect man he
[53:33] played the tape in the car while we were
[53:35] driving it felt like the presence of the
[53:37] Lord dropped in the car and it was very
[53:39] unexpected but you know I believe he was
[53:42] just faithful you know to do what God
[53:44] put on his heart and this is a simple
[53:46] gospel I love how our pastor says this
[53:48] is not a hard cell you know you just
[53:51] share the message you just give give
[53:53] what you've been you've received and I
[53:56] just say it like this and you know from
[53:58] that time he was the one that kept
[54:00] following up with me every couple of
[54:02] weeks he would follow up and give me a
[54:04] call and say hey have you been reading
[54:05] the books or have you have you gone to a
[54:08] message church I'm like Message Church
[54:09] you know there's a lot of things we

[1:04:15] heads this
[1:04:17] morning gracious father that's truly is
[1:04:19] the desire of us this morning Lord
[1:04:23] and father above all that we can ask
[1:04:28] and Lord we desire to see you shining
[1:04:32] through us and Lord I don't believe that
[1:04:34] there's a soul here represented this
[1:04:36] morning whose request and desire is not
[1:04:39] to see you shine and we know that we
[1:04:42] have a lot of lacking and we fell short
[1:04:46] in a lot of things
[1:04:48] and but Lord when we think about the
[1:04:51] things that you have done for us and
[1:04:54] when we think about where you taken us
[1:04:56] from and when you think about we think
[1:05:00] about the price that was paid and
[1:05:03] Lord the reasonable service we can give
[1:05:07] back to you Lord is to let your life
[1:05:10] shine through US Lord and we sincerely
[1:05:13] ask this morning Lord Jesus may you just
[1:05:17] help us father through our weaknesses
[1:05:20] that you may be made strong and Lord you
[1:05:23] promise that it's not going to be by
[1:05:25] Almighty by our power but it's going to
[1:05:28] be by the Holy Spirit quickening Your
[1:05:30] Word of Life to us and taking us every
[1:05:33] step of the way Lord we this morning
[1:05:36] Lord we don't want to focus on our
[1:05:39] weaknesses Lord though we have many of
[1:05:42] them and Lord we realize that if we
[1:05:45] focus on them the only thing we can do
[1:05:47] is magnify those
[1:05:48] weaknesses but oh if we can focus on the
[1:05:51] word of God if we can focus on the
[1:05:54] promise that you have made us Lord that
[1:05:57] promise will drop in this morning in the
[1:05:59] people and you will give us the strength
[1:06:01] oh God and that will certainly will go
[1:06:03] out of here stronger than the way we
[1:06:05] came to know that the Mighty God is
[1:06:08] living in his people to know that your
[1:06:10] promise for the end time is true that's
[1:06:13] our desire this morning Father we ask
[1:06:16] that you remember our pastor and those
[1:06:17] that are traveling and we want to commit
[1:06:20] them into your hands and we ask this
[1:06:22] morning that you give us a portion of
[1:06:24] your word that we can Fellowship upon
[1:06:26] this morning Father when we go out of
[1:06:28] here that we may say truly it was good
[1:06:30] to be in the house of God that's the
[1:06:32] sincere desire of our hearts this
[1:06:34] morning we commit the service and
[1:06:36] everything to you and ask it in the name
[1:06:38] of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[1:06:40] amen amen it's good to be in the house
[1:06:43] of God this morning amen we want to

[1:07:02] the wedding and it was wonderful there
[1:07:04] was a lot of people there and I know

[1:07:08] certainly pray that the Lord be with
[1:07:10] with them amen amen amen I certainly

[1:07:29] offering or you know kep people standing
[1:07:31] or things like that but we're certainly
[1:07:33] thankful that the Lord is faithful amen
[1:07:35] let's open our Bibles this morning uh
[1:07:38] Fellowship around the scriptures and and
[1:07:40] just uh a a a very uh small thought that

[1:07:47] fellowship upon and trust that the Lord
[1:07:49] will be a a blessing for us uh
[1:07:51] Deuteronomy chapter 1 uh let's start

[1:08:29] so it said that on this side it says on
[1:08:33] this side of uh on this side Jordan it
[1:08:36] says um in the land of
[1:08:40] Moab uh began Moses to declare the law
[1:08:44] saying the Lord Our God spake unto us in
[1:08:48] Horeb and I believe we understand that's
[1:08:51] the place where God called and gather
[1:08:53] the children of Israel to give them the
[1:08:55] the law to give them the Commandment it
[1:08:58] says ye have dwelt long enough in this
[1:09:03] mountain it says turn you and take your
[1:09:07] uh take your journey and go to the Mount
[1:09:11] of the amorites and unto all the places
[1:09:14] nigh there unto in the plain and in the

[1:09:33] Euphrates behold I have set the land
[1:09:37] before you go in and possess the
[1:09:42] land which the Lord swear unto your
[1:09:45] fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give
[1:09:49] unto them to their seed after them very
[1:09:54] clear instruction right no ambig
[1:09:57] ambiguity just go out I want you to now
[1:10:00] you have gone around the mountain now
[1:10:03] the direction you're supposed to be

[1:10:10] you you have been given an order and
[1:10:13] that is to continue to possess the land
[1:10:16] to go in the direction where you you
[1:10:18] take what God has promised for you let's
[1:10:21] also turn in numbers 33 uh verse 51
[1:10:41] it says Speak unto the children of
[1:10:43] Israel and say unto them when ye are
[1:10:47] pass over Jordan into the land of
[1:10:51] Canaan then ye shall drive out all the
[1:10:54] inhabitant of the land from before you
[1:10:57] and destroy all the
[1:11:01] pictures destroy all the modern
[1:11:05] image and quit plug down their high
[1:11:10] places ye shall dispossess the
[1:11:14] inheritance of the land and dwell
[1:11:17] therein for I have given you the land to
[1:11:22] possess
[1:11:23] it very clear
[1:11:27] he didn't say go dwell with them
[1:11:29] together with them and go share a space
[1:11:32] and go do this no dispossess them
[1:11:36] everything and ye shall divide the land
[1:11:39] by lot for inheritance among your
[1:11:43] families and to and to the more ye shall
[1:11:47] give the more
[1:11:49] inheritance and to the fewer ye shall
[1:11:52] give the less inheritance every men's
[1:11:55] inheritance shall be in the place where
[1:11:59] is the lot
[1:12:01] Fallen where is lot Fallen according to
[1:12:04] the tribe and the and your fathers ye
[1:12:07] shall inherit it says but if you if you
[1:12:11] will not drive out the inhabitants of
[1:12:13] the land from before then it shall come
[1:12:17] to pass that those which ye let remain
[1:12:22] of them shall be pricked in your your
[1:12:25] eyes and tone in your side and shall Vex
[1:12:29] you in the land wherein ye
[1:12:33] dwell moreover it shall come to pass
[1:12:37] that I shall do unto you as I thought to
[1:12:40] do unto
[1:12:42] them let's bow our heads our gracious
[1:12:44] father we're so thankful for your word
[1:12:46] this
[1:12:47] morning we just ask that you speak to us
[1:12:49] Lord and Reveal Your word to us Lord
[1:12:52] that we may just have Fellowship on it
[1:12:54] we're committed to you in Jesus name we
[1:12:56] pray amen God bless you may have your
[1:12:58] seats this
[1:12:59] morning I want to speak this morning
[1:13:02] just for a few minutes uh we're going to
[1:13:04] be fa I want to call this thought here
[1:13:08] the land is yours to
[1:13:10] possess the land is yours to possess uh
[1:13:14] I want to start off by saying that as
[1:13:17] you would uh read and and look
[1:13:19] throughout the message um we we live in
[1:13:24] the in a very
[1:13:26] call it a terrible age as as far as the
[1:13:29] world is concerned if you look at what's
[1:13:33] happening out there and you look at the
[1:13:35] the the the land that we are living in
[1:13:37] the world per se the world is in a a
[1:13:40] very desperate
[1:13:42] situation and whatam will even say it's
[1:13:45] a it's a terrible time for the world but
[1:13:48] it's a glorious time for the Believers
[1:13:50] so the world as far as the world is
[1:13:53] concerned uh we could certainly say uh
[1:13:56] this is the best that they will ever had
[1:13:59] whatever is happening out there however
[1:14:01] bad it is it's the best that they could
[1:14:03] ever had because all that happens
[1:14:06] afterwards it's going to get worse and
[1:14:07] worse and we've been told that and said
[1:14:12] they they yet they are they give people
[1:14:14] a a false sense of security but yet
[1:14:17] within it there's uh there's an oncoming
[1:14:20] destruction that's behind it and we can
[1:14:23] say today with the is in technology and
[1:14:26] all of that every time you turn around
[1:14:28] there's something new and there's
[1:14:30] something coming up and there's another
[1:14:33] uh move of Technology that's going to
[1:14:35] boost the economy and all of those
[1:14:37] things and the prophet will say that
[1:14:39] yeah we are we have more science we have
[1:14:42] more education but yet at the same time
[1:14:44] we have more diseases than we've ever
[1:14:46] had before we have more depression than
[1:14:49] we ever had before we have more sin like
[1:14:52] than than we've ever had before we have
[1:14:54] more de Vision than we ever had before
[1:14:56] and more confusion that that ever was
[1:14:59] before so the world if we look at it in
[1:15:02] the lens of the scripture the world is
[1:15:05] in the spirit of of the end time but
[1:15:08] when I'm says the spirit of the end time
[1:15:10] is the world is in the spirit of
[1:15:12] destruction they're going to destroy
[1:15:14] themselves they said God is not going to
[1:15:16] destroy man man will destroy man why
[1:15:19] because that's what was promised as far
[1:15:21] as the world is concerned what happen uh
[1:15:24] the because when you reject the word of
[1:15:26] God that was promised to you when you
[1:15:28] reject the only provided way of God the
[1:15:31] only thing that you left with is
[1:15:33] judgment and it's not because God didn't
[1:15:36] care because the scripture will tell us
[1:15:38] that God so loved the world that he gave
[1:15:40] his only begotten son but it's because
[1:15:43] people have rejected the only provided
[1:15:45] way that God has given the only way
[1:15:48] that's supposed to get them out of sin
[1:15:50] the only thing that can make a change in
[1:15:52] their life they rejected it so when
[1:15:55] they've rejected it the only thing
[1:15:57] that's left with them is Judgment so God
[1:16:00] is not willing that men should perish
[1:16:02] he's not intending for God me to perish
[1:16:05] but he knows at the same time that when
[1:16:07] he sends his word to the unbeliever they
[1:16:10] will not receive it so that's why will
[1:16:13] even say that when Jesus died he didn't
[1:16:15] die for the whole world per se say
[1:16:17] because he knew that the those that were
[1:16:19] not part of the beginning or those of
[1:16:21] the children of God will reject it but
[1:16:24] only those that were predestinated to
[1:16:26] receive it will receive it but the world
[1:16:28] in general even though God provided a
[1:16:31] way they will reject it but in the same
[1:16:34] time now he telling us to the believer
[1:16:36] this is the Glorious age now I I I just
[1:16:40] want you to think that for a moment
[1:16:42] think about that there's not going to be
[1:16:43] another age after this think about this
[1:16:46] age being the age of the finishing of
[1:16:49] all the work God has been working in
[1:16:51] since the beginning of the age think
[1:16:54] about this being the end time where
[1:16:57] after us there's not going to be
[1:16:58] anything butam calls it in different
[1:17:00] ways just for summary so I can move on
[1:17:02] this morning this is the day of his we
[1:17:05] live in the day of the coming of the
[1:17:07] Lord the Glorious Day we live in the
[1:17:09] time where God has promised to make
[1:17:12] himself one with his people there's not
[1:17:16] another time where butam will say that
[1:17:20] all that God was orted into Christ all
[1:17:22] that Christ was orted into his people
[1:17:25] into his bride or the church the time
[1:17:28] where the fullness of God will be
[1:17:30] manifested in his people not another
[1:17:32] time only in this time that's why
[1:17:35] brother bam says all of the prophets and
[1:17:37] all the sages of old they wanted to live
[1:17:40] in the time that you are living in so we
[1:17:42] shouldn't take it lightly we have to
[1:17:44] take it for what God has promised it to
[1:17:46] be we have to be excited for what's
[1:17:49] before
[1:17:49] us we don't have to live in depression
[1:17:52] we have to live in happiness and knowing
[1:17:54] that the world is falling apart that's
[1:17:56] what was promised for them but for us we
[1:17:59] are promised the entire promise of God
[1:18:02] the entire book of Promise of God is
[1:18:04] Promised for this age and Pam said again
[1:18:07] this is the age of the super church not
[1:18:11] in any other time the church is called
[1:18:13] the super church this is the age that
[1:18:16] God is building a super Church a church
[1:18:18] like never before this is the time where
[1:18:21] God is building an invisable army is a
[1:18:25] time where we are returning to the true
[1:18:28] purpose of God's
[1:18:31] creation the true purpose of God's
[1:18:34] creation what God wanted to do in the
[1:18:36] beginning what what God showed in a span
[1:18:40] of time through the life of Adam what we
[1:18:42] saw Adam do what we saw Adam go through
[1:18:45] the fellowship that he had with God and
[1:18:47] all of those things we can see today and
[1:18:50] say that God has been working by sending
[1:18:53] forth the prophets and he came and he
[1:18:55] showed through the prophet that God
[1:18:57] wanted to work and restore man and he
[1:18:59] came by his own son Jesus Christ and to
[1:19:02] manifest and to spill his blood and to
[1:19:04] redeem the people but in the end time
[1:19:07] the whole purpose run its course and
[1:19:09] comes to the finish line now God is here
[1:19:12] manifesting the purpose of what has been
[1:19:15] working since the beginning of creation
[1:19:18] to have a people that the same Harmony
[1:19:21] that existed between Christ and the uh
[1:19:23] Christ and God that God will take that
[1:19:26] same Harmony and have it with him and
[1:19:28] his people the same Fellowship that Adam
[1:19:31] had with God God is coming this age to
[1:19:34] restore that to that same
[1:19:37] Fellowship so it's the time where we can
[1:19:40] look in the Bible and see that we This
[1:19:43] is the End Time am and and and and the
[1:19:46] reason why we say this thing is is so we
[1:19:49] can understand the the importance or the
[1:19:52] gravity of the time that we are living
[1:19:55] this is not time to play games this is
[1:19:57] not time to to be lukewarm you will be
[1:20:00] left behind you will miss it if you play
[1:20:04] games this is the time where God has
[1:20:06] taken everything that he was he poured
[1:20:09] into his church it's the time where we
[1:20:11] are supposed to be locked in we are
[1:20:14] supposed to be living in we are supposed
[1:20:16] to be so locked in in the promise so
[1:20:18] that the reality of God will be
[1:20:21] manifested it's not time to look to the
[1:20:24] left or look to the right it's not time
[1:20:26] to get distracted it's the time to know
[1:20:28] that I have been given a word a word to
[1:20:31] change me a word to prepare me for the
[1:20:34] body change that's around the corner now
[1:20:37] remember we are promised that this will
[1:20:38] happen at any
[1:20:41] time the prophet will say in the uh the
[1:20:44] message my life uh the the life story uh
[1:20:47] preaching
[1:20:48] 51722 paragraph 11 it says and I believe
[1:20:52] that I'm talking to a people who are are
[1:20:54] looking for the Lord to come and because
[1:20:57] remember he appears to only those that
[1:21:00] are looking for his
[1:21:02] appearing not to everybody those that
[1:21:05] are are are are distracted they won't
[1:21:08] see his
[1:21:09] appearing those that are caught into
[1:21:12] things that don't provide life those
[1:21:15] that Miss to understand the purpose for
[1:21:17] the end time they will not see is
[1:21:18] appearing so he's he's looking for those
[1:21:22] he's he says you I says we are looking
[1:21:25] for the coming of the Lord and he says
[1:21:27] and I believe we are right in the shadow
[1:21:31] of his
[1:21:32] coming right now oh what a glorious time
[1:21:36] to know that the same Blissful day it
[1:21:39] says that some Blissful day he will
[1:21:42] break through the the Eastern Horizon
[1:21:44] and it says and come down and receive
[1:21:47] his church it says I'm so happy today by
[1:21:50] his grace that I'm that that is numbered
[1:21:53] me with you all it says and I believe
[1:21:57] that we are going there I believe by his
[1:21:59] grace that he will let me uh go with you
[1:22:03] it says and then we are going to have
[1:22:06] plenty of time to talk won't it be just
[1:22:09] it says just forever I'm saying this
[1:22:12] this morning what we should be looking
[1:22:14] for is what's next around the corner oh
[1:22:17] I tell you just around the corner all
[1:22:19] the trials and all the things that we go
[1:22:22] through think about all that the devil
[1:22:24] is attacking you for all of that will be
[1:22:26] worthwhile because you'll be on the
[1:22:28] other side it's not it's not going to
[1:22:31] take long don't be despair this morning
[1:22:33] don't think how long how long just
[1:22:36] continue to press on continue to stay
[1:22:38] the course all of this will be worth
[1:22:40] while all your trials will be withth
[1:22:43] while all the pains will be withth while
[1:22:45] our will be on the other side we mean on
[1:22:48] the other side we'll talk for a million
[1:22:50] years we'll talk about his goodness and
[1:22:52] all the provision and all that he is
[1:22:54] done let me say this don't give up this
[1:22:58] morning don't give in don't look at your
[1:23:02] life and say war is me I keep running
[1:23:04] into trouble you keep as much trouble as
[1:23:07] you are in know that the Lord is with
[1:23:09] you this morning know that the Lord is
[1:23:12] preparing you for what's coming around
[1:23:13] the
[1:23:15] corner and I think sometimes we forget
[1:23:17] that those things are put on us because
[1:23:20] God is trying to build us in as a
[1:23:22] character that's fit for us to live on
[1:23:24] the other
[1:23:26] side oh I was just to jump on the oh let
[1:23:31] me say this it's God building a
[1:23:33] character that's fit to
[1:23:35] rule let me say this how is the J how is
[1:23:38] the Saints going to judge the world if
[1:23:41] you stood there and you didn't have the
[1:23:43] character to judge
[1:23:44] with all that's happening is God
[1:23:47] preparing you he's getting you in shape
[1:23:50] he putting you in position because
[1:23:52] remember the prophet said the only thing
[1:23:53] we're going to take over the other side

[1:23:57] our riches we're not going to take our
[1:23:59] money we're not going to take take
[1:24:01] everything we build around here the only
[1:24:03] thing we're going to take is our
[1:24:04] character and because he knows that he
[1:24:07] let those things come upon
[1:24:10] you one of this glorious morning you'll
[1:24:14] wake up and then all of the sudden how
[1:24:17] you going to know you're going to know

[1:28:48] for the lost souls and do all that I

[1:29:24] says don't talk to me about no robes or
[1:29:27] crown let me just look at him for a
[1:29:30] thousand
[1:29:32] years the one who gave his life the one
[1:29:37] whom we all serve this morning what we
[1:29:39] what we are looking for is for that to
[1:29:42] become the main motive of Our Lives we
[1:29:45] we don't want anything to take that
[1:29:47] place we don't want anything to take and
[1:29:49] to come over that we want everything
[1:29:52] that we do the only for us to be that
[1:29:55] glorious morning that glorious day when
[1:29:57] we sit around the table so the objective
[1:30:00] of a Believer is when I sit am asking am
[1:30:04] I my my my my my objectives and my goal
[1:30:08] the things that I'm doing am I actually
[1:30:10] living for that day am I actually making
[1:30:13] decisions that will lead me to that
[1:30:15] place am I actually in my heart having
[1:30:18] the fire inside of it to continue to
[1:30:21] lead me to guide me so I can live for
[1:30:24] that glorious day because we have to
[1:30:26] remember the prophet said this I don't
[1:30:28] know how this all fit but I'll just say
[1:30:30] what he said he say that the decisions
[1:30:33] you make today determines your Eternal
[1:30:40] destination some will claim well I'm
[1:30:43] predestinated but he the same who say
[1:30:45] that you are predestinated say that the
[1:30:48] the the decisions we make today
[1:30:50] determines your Eternal destination
[1:30:55] so what we need as a Believer is not a
[1:30:58] free will or a a free range chicken that
[1:31:01] just does what he wants to do no what we
[1:31:04] want is those that are governed by the
[1:31:06] love of God Guided by the word of God
[1:31:09] they only do what pleases the father
[1:31:11] their heart's desire is to see God move
[1:31:14] into them their heart's desire is to
[1:31:16] fulfill the word of
[1:31:21] God butam says in the message say
[1:31:24] testimony testimony of of uh raising
[1:31:29] raising the dead boy the dead boy he
[1:31:31] says and then it says so they
[1:31:35] claim they got an underground air bunker
[1:31:39] Air Bomb air air bomb shelter and
[1:31:42] everything and planes and that can srl
[1:31:47] around out missiles and the bombs and
[1:31:50] everything in every nation and every
[1:31:52] city in the United States it says uh

[1:32:00] Nation every city in the United States
[1:32:03] in five minutes with atomic bombs and
[1:32:06] send them right
[1:32:07] from from that place
[1:32:10] there so brother we are living in a
[1:32:13] terrible age we are living in a time
[1:32:16] when men are to get right with God seek
[1:32:21] God CUA the hours coming when
[1:32:24] destruction is just as sure to strike as
[1:32:27] I'm standing here in the

[1:33:00] going down through the cities and cities
[1:33:02] official drinking whiskey and
[1:33:04] celebrating Christmas and things like
[1:33:05] that he says how can we um uh expect God
[1:33:10] to do anything different than destroy
[1:33:13] the place isn't that right the whole
[1:33:15] nation is polluted anywhere the whole
[1:33:17] world is polluted that's right the only
[1:33:20] thing the only only one thing left that
[1:33:23] that's the coming of Jesus Christ the
[1:33:25] son of God the only hope in the world
[1:33:29] that we have flee to him

[1:34:53] stay with me for Just A Moment Like I
[1:34:54] said I'm trying trying not to be too
[1:34:58] long we we could look in the
[1:35:02] scripture what R we talk about the first
[1:35:04] Exodus that God came and he brought the
[1:35:08] children of Israel out of one natural
[1:35:11] land to
[1:35:12] another in the second Exodus he came and
[1:35:16] he brought them from one spiritual
[1:35:18] condition where were're in uh
[1:35:22] denomination as per say where the were
[1:35:26] uh uh the scribes and all of them he
[1:35:28] brought them says he brought them to the
[1:35:30] baptism of the Holy Spirit In other
[1:35:32] words from one spiritual condition to
[1:35:34] another spiritual condition now in the
[1:35:36] Third Exodus he's coming he's taking us
[1:35:39] some where we are and bringing us into
[1:35:42] the Rapture now I want to say this the
[1:35:45] the Third Exodus is the closing of the
[1:35:50] circle I want you to think about that
[1:35:53] the Third thir Exodus is not is now the
[1:35:56] finishing of the whole work the Third
[1:35:59] Exodus is now moving from mortality into
[1:36:04] immortality the Third Exodus the people
[1:36:07] of the first Exodus they were move from
[1:36:09] natural land to a natural land they die
[1:36:11] the second Exodus they were brought from
[1:36:13] one condition to another and years came
[1:36:16] to pass those that came after they
[1:36:18] denominated but in the Third Exodus God
[1:36:21] is coming in he's taking some way we are
[1:36:25] he's bringing us right back into what
[1:36:27] God it is it is mine from the beginning
[1:36:30] and it's a finishing of the circle for
[1:36:33] God to come back and say I have
[1:36:35] completed my work for God to come back
[1:36:38] and bring men right back into what he
[1:36:40] desired for him to be so I want to say

[1:37:51] life Stay With Me amen he's talking
[1:37:55] about when those the founding fathers of
[1:37:59] uh uh uh of America when they came over
[1:38:02] they were thankful for the new found way
[1:38:05] of life being separated from the old
[1:38:08] English denomination and Cates it says
[1:38:11] they they could marry in the new in the
[1:38:14] new anointed word of the Rage that's
[1:38:16] right the new anointed word of the rage
[1:38:19] for that day it says now in 194 it says
[1:38:23] now so I said so can we be thankful as
[1:38:27] Pilgrim like Abraham separated ourselves
[1:38:30] from the new from the from the things of
[1:38:33] the world it says all all of the
[1:38:36] associates Associates and Abraham was a
[1:38:39] pilgrim God separated us from all the
[1:38:42] dead
[1:38:43] denomination it says I'm speaking Across
[1:38:46] the Nation now all dead
[1:38:50] Creeds and to what separated us and open
[1:38:54] to us a new land a new message for this
[1:39:01] day so the the end time word is a new
[1:39:05] land for us is a new opportunity is a
[1:39:09] land that man has never been before is a
[1:39:12] returning to the Garden of Eden is a
[1:39:15] returning into God's original plan all
[1:39:18] the others they came and they
[1:39:20] denominated they came and they
[1:39:21] denominated but the end time at the
[1:39:24] opening of the seals God came and
[1:39:26] brought to the Believers a new land and
[1:39:29] I want to say let's explore the new
[1:39:32] land let's not just talk about it let
[1:39:34] explore it what is this new land's got
[1:39:37] to do what is it that it's in the new
[1:39:39] land I I hear that in the new land
[1:39:41] there's Rapture for us I want to grab
[1:39:43] some of that I hear that in the new land
[1:39:46] we have been given power like Adam had
[1:39:49] to speak the word and it will come to
[1:39:50] pass I want some of that I I hear that
[1:39:53] in the new land I can come and I'll be
[1:39:56] healed I want some of that healing I
[1:39:59] hear that in the new land if my
[1:40:01] brother's crop is drying out I can speak
[1:40:03] the word and rain will come down I want
[1:40:05] some of
[1:40:08] that we are partakers of divine nature
[1:40:12] we are not just to speak about it but we
[1:40:14] are to partake of it the trouble with
[1:40:17] the children of Israel is God gave them
[1:40:19] the land they stood there and they
[1:40:21] refused to conquer it
[1:40:24] come
[1:40:25] on you read in the Bible yeah it is I
[1:40:27] given you all the land but you read
[1:40:29] further it says that but the tribe of
[1:40:32] this they failed to conquer that but
[1:40:35] this tribe failed to conquer that why
[1:40:38] the land was given to
[1:40:40] them so I say let's conquer the land
[1:40:43] that God has given us the prophet says
[1:40:47] it says paragraph
[1:40:49] 196 195 I believe it says Pentecostal
[1:40:52] dried up
[1:40:53] like Luther Wesley and the rest of them
[1:40:56] it says it
[1:41:04] says Pentecost are dried up dried up and
[1:41:08] died like Luther Wesley and the rest of
[1:41:10] them it says it's more it's no more than
[1:41:13] a bunch of churches pulled together it
[1:41:16] says good people in there yet it's got
[1:41:19] to be it's got to come to be to be com
[1:41:23] out it says what did he do he opened up
[1:41:27] the Seven Seals of the last message you
[1:41:30] notice that the Seven Seals he says
[1:41:33] which all the mysteries of the seven
[1:41:37] Church Ages was was sealed what was
[1:41:40] sealed with a seven seal the reformers
[1:41:43] didn't have time to do it to do it in
[1:41:46] their time they didn't they didn't live
[1:41:48] long enough but this blessing this
[1:41:51] blessed revelation of the s h it's open
[1:41:54] to us in the last day from a prophet
[1:41:58] from a prophecy that went forth to
[1:42:07] Arizona what is this attraction on the
[1:42:13] mountain now let me ask you Believers of
[1:42:15] this message what is it about this
[1:42:18] message that's different from Pentecost
[1:42:21] from Baptist
[1:42:23] from presbyterian from
[1:42:26] others we should know that right because
[1:42:30] it's not the same thing that's
[1:42:32] right this message in the seventh age in
[1:42:36] the God sent a prophet with a message
[1:42:39] and it was a message to call out a
[1:42:41] people from denomination but that was
[1:42:44] the first part but the second part was
[1:42:46] the revealing of the son of man himself
[1:42:49] who was supposed to come to make himself
[1:42:51] known God came in Revelation 10: 7 he
[1:42:55] came and he dropped down and he opens up
[1:42:58] the seals and he came and he gave it to
[1:43:00] his Prophet so he can speak to you now
[1:43:03] he came this whole denomination was
[1:43:05] constantly speaking to you from the
[1:43:08] man's standpoint because all they had
[1:43:10] was with the the intellect of man all
[1:43:13] they hadam says there were reformers and
[1:43:15] the had didn't have access to what a
[1:43:18] prophet was and he says but but to the
[1:43:20] seventh one it had to be a prophet he
[1:43:23] had to be a prophet and when God called
[1:43:25] The Prophet on the scene the prophet
[1:43:27] came he brought to us what in God's back
[1:43:31] part of the Mind from the beginning
[1:43:33] God's original plan for your
[1:43:36] life God original plan for what you were
[1:43:39] to be from the beginning when he created
[1:43:41] you his desire for you what he created
[1:43:44] you to be and I want to say this morning
[1:43:47] that should be something that we hold on
[1:43:49] to every day
[1:43:50] [Applause]
[1:43:53] you go the things happen you go through
[1:43:55] trouble don't forget don't lose yourself
[1:43:58] in your trouble thinking oh oh it's me
[1:44:00] and all of that remember you are a son
[1:44:03] of God remember I am made to reflect God
[1:44:06] I'm made to be God on Earth I'm made to
[1:44:09] be God in the circumstance and I invoke
[1:44:12] upon my God's ability to resolve
[1:44:17] it because remember the the message that
[1:44:21] the prophet brought out outside of all
[1:44:24] the other reformers he's now pointing
[1:44:26] you to what was in the beginning by
[1:44:31] predestination amen he looked at you and
[1:44:35] was fellowshipping with the brother and
[1:44:36] I said he said but you know don't isn't
[1:44:40] somebody saved when they come to the
[1:44:42] altar I said I said well it's true but
[1:44:45] it's
[1:44:47] not what does that mean now if you look
[1:44:51] at it from the main standpoint that
[1:44:53] person is saved but if you look at it
[1:44:56] from God's standpoint that person is
[1:44:58] only coming to the realization of what
[1:45:00] they
[1:45:04] were if you look at your life from the
[1:45:07] man standpoint you just struggl
[1:45:10] is you know you're just trying to do
[1:45:12] this and trying to do that and trying to
[1:45:14] do this but oh my if you can look from
[1:45:16] God's 10o he's got you exactly where he
[1:45:20] wanted you to be his ear telling you you
[1:45:23] are a son possess your land if sickness
[1:45:26] come into your body possess your land if
[1:45:28] trouble come into your land possess your
[1:45:30] land I have given you the power to do it
[1:45:34] why Christ speak the
[1:45:37] word oh let me tell you after the seals
[1:45:40] all the sermons title change and he
[1:45:44] began God calling upon you there's a man
[1:45:46] here who can turn on the light Jesus
[1:45:49] Christ the same yesterday the invisible
[1:45:51] Union why is is he doing
[1:45:54] that he's calling you to what you were
[1:45:57] supposed to be in the
[1:46:00] beginning he doesn't want you to operate
[1:46:02] just as a man he wants you to operate as
[1:46:06] the god that's been placed
[1:46:12] [Applause]
[1:46:19] here in the testimony of the rais
[1:46:24] after raising the dead boy he continues
[1:46:26] on paragraph 14 it
[1:46:30] says now he
[1:46:32] said there's
[1:46:35] Palestine I swore to
[1:46:37] Abraham 400 years and something years
[1:46:43] ago that I was going to give it to him
[1:46:47] and now I say it's yours I give it to
[1:46:51] you
[1:46:53] amen and then so he says to you to his
[1:46:56] seed says I give it to you thank
[1:47:04] Lord now how clear can that
[1:47:08] be and if it is true then why do we have
[1:47:11] so much hard
[1:47:14] time oh Lord if you will only give it so
[1:47:17] how many times does he have to say he's
[1:47:19] given it to you
[1:47:23] is it scriptural is it according to the
[1:47:24] word he's giving it to you is it the
[1:47:27] will of God is it the word of God he's
[1:47:29] giving it to you and the scripture says
[1:47:32] God is not a man that he should
[1:47:35] lie or a son of men that he should
[1:47:39] repent God is not one that would give it
[1:47:42] to you and come and take it away he's
[1:47:45] not going to give you and say well I've
[1:47:48] given you but you are not worthy of it
[1:47:49] I'm taking it away
[1:47:54] or as the expression will go God is not
[1:47:57] an Indian giver he will give and require
[1:48:00] something
[1:48:04] back I have given you the
[1:48:07] land and so he says I like this it says
[1:48:11] and now
[1:48:12] look here is where I want you here is uh
[1:48:16] here's where I want you to
[1:48:18] see he says Now isn't it strange now he
[1:48:22] said it's yours but it's just full of
[1:48:27] haites jebusites Canaanites and all
[1:48:32] kinds of enemies in there they are
[1:48:35] walled up heavy now it's yours go take
[1:48:39] it it's yours now I give it to you but
[1:48:44] you go get
[1:48:48] it
[1:48:50] huh it's mine with all the trouble
[1:48:54] that's in it yeah
[1:48:56] yes it's yours when God gives you
[1:49:00] something God doesn't care right he's
[1:49:04] not moved but what's in there on when
[1:49:08] when the word says you are healed it's
[1:49:11] regardless of what diseases is in your
[1:49:14] body now I like I said or if I could
[1:49:18] just if if you could just take the the
[1:49:21] the mind that I want to bring this
[1:49:22] morning morning is let's not look at
[1:49:24] things from the man man's standpoint
[1:49:27] let's move to the God's standpoint of
[1:49:29] viewing things when God has given it to
[1:49:32] you there's trouble in it there's all
[1:49:35] kinds of enemies in it but his word says
[1:49:37] I have given it to you why because if
[1:49:40] God gives it to you God will make a way
[1:49:43] for you to possess it if God gives it to
[1:49:45] you his word that says that I give it to
[1:49:49] you has the provision for you to
[1:49:51] overcome every enemy in
[1:49:55] it you don't have to go and figure out
[1:49:57] and say well God has given it to me so
[1:49:59] let's figure out a way for us to go get
[1:50:01] it no you just go and say this is mine
[1:50:04] I'm taking it I don't care how strong
[1:50:07] the enemy is let me ask you this how how
[1:50:10] is it possible that Abraham with ply
[1:50:13] words with his servants can go and
[1:50:15] overcome
[1:50:17] Kings but the scripture says they were
[1:50:20] untrained servants
[1:50:25] it will take ply shares and it will take
[1:50:28] just instruments around it will go
[1:50:31] against an
[1:50:32] army and overcome
[1:50:35] them you tell me how they did it I'll
[1:50:37] tell you by what promise they did
[1:50:40] it God told Abraham look northward look
[1:50:44] Eastward look Southward look everything
[1:50:47] he says everything that your eyes can
[1:50:50] see I have given it to you and it's by
[1:50:53] it was by that promise that they
[1:50:55] overcame so it didn't matter if they
[1:50:57] show up empty-handed God was on their
[1:50:59] side and let me tell you it doesn't
[1:51:01] matter it's not how strong the enemy is
[1:51:04] it's who's on your
[1:51:06] side who's on your side when when when
[1:51:09] you run into trouble don't forget who's
[1:51:12] on your side when the enemy comes in
[1:51:14] like a flight don't forget who's
[1:51:16] standing across from you don't forget
[1:51:18] who's standing by you the prophet said
[1:51:20] you want to challenge what I'm saying
[1:51:22] you come stand by here and nobody showed
[1:51:26] up why because it didn't matter what
[1:51:29] they were up to it didn't matter how
[1:51:31] educated they were he knew who was
[1:51:33] standing by him and he knew that as long
[1:51:36] as God is standing by me he doesn't
[1:51:38] matter what the opposition
[1:51:45] is oh
[1:51:48] my looks like we'll have to continue
[1:51:50] another time
[1:51:54] he says
[1:51:56] now now that's the people
[1:52:01] today if you would
[1:52:04] only see when I tell you about Divine
[1:52:10] Healing you would say well brother
[1:52:12] brandham look I was prayed for last
[1:52:16] night I can't move my hand
[1:52:19] anymore now this applies to every
[1:52:22] promise
[1:52:23] it's the same
[1:52:24] formula I can't move my hand anymore it
[1:52:27] says that don't have one thing to do
[1:52:31] with
[1:52:33] it so there's the dimension of what's
[1:52:36] happening and then there's the dimension
[1:52:38] of the problem he saying that the reason
[1:52:41] why that is a problem for you because
[1:52:43] you're walking in the dimensions of
[1:52:44] human I'm bringing you up a level so you
[1:52:48] can see the dimension where things
[1:52:50] actually let me say this the word is
[1:52:53] what brought the world into existence
[1:52:56] the word is what changes the world the
[1:53:00] word is what brings things into
[1:53:02] existence the word that's why he says
[1:53:04] use the word and nothing else why
[1:53:07] because he says the children of Abraham
[1:53:10] they are those that called things that
[1:53:12] are not as though they were in other
[1:53:15] word they take it out out from existence
[1:53:18] it doesn't exist and they bring it into
[1:53:20] existence and the thing take things that
[1:53:22] are into existence that the devil has
[1:53:24] brought and they bring it out of
[1:53:27] existence is that what he said they call
[1:53:30] those things which were not as though
[1:53:32] there were and things that are as though
[1:53:34] they were
[1:53:36] not what a
[1:53:38] formula I wish I could use it every day
[1:53:41] I wish when things just blow up in my
[1:53:44] face I go oh I just erase that it
[1:53:46] doesn't exist I wish when I just create
[1:53:49] trouble for myself I just look I said oh
[1:53:51] I just wiped out of way you have been
[1:53:53] given the power to do that don't forget
[1:53:56] it you are a son of
[1:53:58] God that's the power that reside in you
[1:54:01] did the prophet say that the man fully
[1:54:04] surrendered in the hands of God is omnip
[1:54:06] omnipotent he said that is all
[1:54:10] [Applause]
[1:54:19] powerful them Israelites
[1:54:23] why
[1:54:25] sure God just didn't get up there and
[1:54:29] take his brush I love
[1:54:32] this I'm having a good time so so I hope
[1:54:36] you are with me this
[1:54:39] morning this is the only time I feel
[1:54:41] really
[1:54:44] good and Swip them all out he said now
[1:54:49] come in and go
[1:54:51] in here you are sit down never did God
[1:54:55] do that am he could have killed all of
[1:54:58] them and said you just go and drag the
[1:55:01] dread dead body and take it he said no
[1:55:03] but listen
[1:55:04] why you show me it says you show me your
[1:55:08] faith without your works and I will show
[1:55:11] you my faith by my
[1:55:14] Works God wants to see your faith
[1:55:17] manifested he wants you to walk by faith
[1:55:21] if even I can even go further said the
[1:55:23] prophet often time he will come and says
[1:55:25] God I'm waiting for a vision I'm waiting
[1:55:26] for a vision one time said it's the same
[1:55:30] he looked at it and said it's the same
[1:55:31] God if God showed me a vision and he
[1:55:34] will go and I'll go and I'll do it
[1:55:36] because when I have a vision I don't
[1:55:37] need faith God showed me I just go and I
[1:55:40] follow if this thing has to be here I
[1:55:42] just wait there I don't move things I
[1:55:44] just wait until they move through the
[1:55:46] place and I'm going to go do it I know
[1:55:48] God showed me the vision I don't have to
[1:55:49] have any faith it's going to happen but
[1:55:51] then it says but then if God showed me
[1:55:54] by faith if he told me by faith to go do
[1:55:56] it he said he asked the question he says
[1:55:58] but it's still going to be the same
[1:56:00] hands that's going to be on the
[1:56:04] sa so whether it be Vision or no vision
[1:56:08] it's the same hands that's going to do
[1:56:12] it in fact the same prophets come back
[1:56:15] and they said that the word is above the
[1:56:18] vision right right it the word is about
[1:56:23] the it says we have a more excellent
[1:56:25] voice it says the word when the word
[1:56:27] comes the word is the supreme
[1:56:35] authority where am
[1:56:39] I it
[1:56:40] says you've got to go do it and you've
[1:56:44] got to fight for every inch of the
[1:56:46] ground that you have every man in here
[1:56:50] that's born again of the spirit of God
[1:56:54] knows that you've got to fight for every
[1:56:56] inch of ground tow to Mark with Satan it
[1:57:00] says isn't that right friends this is
[1:57:02] not a picnic this is a Battleground see
[1:57:05] you never come here to eat cookies and
[1:57:08] so forth you are in a
[1:57:12] battle I realize I've been trying to
[1:57:14] stay away from preaching about the
[1:57:15] battle but everything I preach about war
[1:57:17] all the time and you
[1:57:20] know shows you how much I like to
[1:57:31] fight he says one place
[1:57:36] and he says if all you can move is your
[1:57:41] toe just move that
[1:57:46] toe it says tomorrow you'll go from a
[1:57:49] toe to a
[1:57:51] foot the next day you believe you're
[1:57:53] going to move your leg come on and the
[1:57:56] next day you believe you're going to
[1:57:57] move
[1:57:59] everything and I'm just paraphrasing
[1:58:01] because I'm trying to save time now he
[1:58:03] said if you prayed for a
[1:58:06] mountain and you look like it didn't
[1:58:08] move and all that happened was one grain
[1:58:13] of sand that went out of
[1:58:17] it this message is
[1:58:20] wonderful you probably couldn't even see
[1:58:23] with a naked
[1:58:25] eye just know that it's already
[1:58:31] happen I'm speaking about the power of
[1:58:34] the spoken word oh brothers and sisters
[1:58:38] if we could rely on the word more than
[1:58:41] we rely on our own abilities if we could
[1:58:44] rely on God's word more than we could
[1:58:46] rely on our own mind your mind is not
[1:58:49] going to do it your strength is not
[1:58:51] going to do it that's why the scripture
[1:58:53] says let this mind that was in Christ be
[1:58:55] also in you that he taught it not
[1:58:57] robbery to be equal with God and he came
[1:59:01] and all he desired was the will of the
[1:59:03] father to happen let me say this it
[1:59:05] doesn't matter whether it's death or
[1:59:07] life as long as it's the will of God
[1:59:10] that's what we
[1:59:13] desire he says in the message testimony
[1:59:16] of the Dead rais Bo he
[1:59:20] says he said says paragraph 15 it says
[1:59:24] could you imagine the United States Army
[1:59:27] train a man and send him around and eat
[1:59:29] cookies and so forth and give him the
[1:59:31] uniform and his gun and train him and go
[1:59:32] out to fight and defend the nation and
[1:59:35] then it says that's what we've got to do
[1:59:37] we've got to defend our god-given
[1:59:40] right I want you to hear that god-given
[1:59:44] right how do you know God your god-given
[1:59:47] right by the opening of the seals you
[1:59:50] are being told what your God given right
[1:59:53] is you hold on to that so God given
[1:59:56] right this right was given to you by God
[1:59:59] he says what God said it's ours let's
[2:00:02] stand right Toe to Toe with Satan I
[2:00:05] wanted to call this message standing Toe
[2:00:06] totoe with Satan it says the whole word
[2:00:10] is constructed and I want to say this
[2:00:12] the stand to to to Satan take the word
[2:00:15] and I'm sorry
[2:00:18] and what's the next one can you just and
[2:00:21] then say say uh say they are ours we
[2:00:26] believe them he says you just write you
[2:00:29] just might as
[2:00:30] well we believe them you just might as
[2:00:33] well move back because you haven't got
[2:00:36] nothing nothing at all it says you
[2:00:39] haven't got it Satan hasn't got one
[2:00:42] legal right of anything anything he's
[2:00:46] got anything he's got is defeated the
[2:00:50] only thing he is is a
[2:00:54] scarecrow that's all he cannot bother
[2:00:58] you a man that's born of the spirit of
[2:01:01] God he's is nothing at all that he can
[2:01:05] harm him there's nothing at all that he
[2:01:09] can that he can at all can harm him so a
[2:01:12] man that's born of the spirit of God is
[2:01:15] a man who understand that I have been
[2:01:18] given my god-given right I'm standing
[2:01:20] here by the word of God I'm speaking you
[2:01:23] by the word of God I'm walking by the
[2:01:25] word of God I'm doing everything I'm
[2:01:27] doing that's why the scripture says
[2:01:29] everything you do you do in the name of
[2:01:30] Jesus Christ why because that's your
[2:01:33] god-given right knowing that if you
[2:01:35] stand and you do it in the name of Jesus
[2:01:37] Christ Satan has no permission and will
[2:01:40] say another place if he shows up just
[2:01:42] cut at him if he comes in your way just
[2:01:45] cut it open and move forward if he
[2:01:47] showed up he says boo say boo devil to
[2:01:50] him if he showed up cut him open and go
[2:01:52] forward why because it's your god-given
[2:01:55] right now he says this and and and and
[2:01:58] and he continues on paragraph 16 it say
[2:02:01] and wait it says and now Satan can push
[2:02:05] things over on you are you with me now
[2:02:09] Satan can push things over on you just
[2:02:12] keep shoving it out it says shove it out
[2:02:15] sh shoving you out he says if if I went
[2:02:19] to my house to tomorrow night and I look
[2:02:23] up there and they moved in they move
[2:02:25] into my house a big bunch of people that
[2:02:28] they were drunken and prostitute and
[2:02:30] carrying on he says well I'll put them
[2:02:32] out he says well how are you going to do
[2:02:35] it he says they say I'm a human this
[2:02:38] house is made for human I'm can I can
[2:02:40] live here too I say this belongs to
[2:02:46] me hear me out this belongs to me this
[2:02:50] is my legal
[2:02:53] possession I've got the abstract deed
[2:02:57] here at the courthouse that shows this
[2:03:00] belong to me you cannot stay here any
[2:03:04] longer I'll serve notice on them they
[2:03:07] have to move if you if they didn't the
[2:03:11] law there's a law downtown that will
[2:03:13] make them move is that right so what we
[2:03:16] want to do this morning as Believers is
[2:03:19] to know what is our god-given right
[2:03:21] right and know that within us God has
[2:03:24] given the abstract deed so that we can
[2:03:27] go and tell the devil this is not
[2:03:32] yours this is not
[2:03:34] yours he says that well anything that
[2:03:38] Satan puts on you in a way of sickness
[2:03:42] whatever it is he says every Born Again
[2:03:46] person has the abstract
[2:03:50] warrant has a warrant from God the holy
[2:03:53] spirit is here to put any devil
[2:03:58] out not you the holy spirit is here
[2:04:02] because remember bam says the holy
[2:04:04] spirit is the enforcer of the word when
[2:04:07] you believe the word when you believe
[2:04:09] that God Is A Healer the holy spirit's
[2:04:12] job is to enforce healing in your body
[2:04:16] the holy spirit is to make the word a
[2:04:18] reality to the believer so don't ever
[2:04:21] think the holy spirit is some other when
[2:04:23] you believe the word of God for anything
[2:04:25] there has to be some Spirit somewhere
[2:04:28] there has to be someone there has to be
[2:04:30] the word one who spoke the word who can
[2:04:33] come and take that word and make it a
[2:04:34] reality to you so he saying the holy
[2:04:37] spirit will come he will put the devil
[2:04:39] out he will put the devil out he will
[2:04:42] serve notice onto him in the name of
[2:04:44] Jesus CU he has no legal rights I'm the
[2:04:48] Lord that Health all thy diseases is our
[2:04:50] right he says he was wounded for our
[2:04:53] transgression he was stri he was stried
[2:04:55] for our iniquity uh uh by he was uh with
[2:04:59] the stripes we are healed it says but
[2:05:02] you got to go over and take
[2:05:08] it now let me
[2:05:13] just go a little deeper here for a
[2:05:18] second and we'll try to close soon
[2:05:24] an abstract Deed by definition it says
[2:05:27] in essence an
[2:05:29] abstract the abstract is the title is an
[2:05:34] abstract of a title is a chronological
[2:05:38] document that summarizes everything that
[2:05:42] has happened with the title of a
[2:05:46] property is that
[2:05:48] confusing so I hope we you stay with me
[2:05:51] and I know we know these
[2:05:52] things so an
[2:05:55] abstract has the complete
[2:05:58] history of what the property how many
[2:06:01] owners they had what the lean is on it
[2:06:05] everything that has to do about that
[2:06:08] property so when the opening of the
[2:06:11] seals came God came down and he gave us
[2:06:15] the abstract what is the abstract the
[2:06:18] abstract he now telling you where you
[2:06:22] came from how you got in the condition
[2:06:24] that you are in and who you really
[2:06:27] belong to
[2:06:31] am so our right as what ram calls it our
[2:06:35] god-given right is our understanding
[2:06:39] that we have received from this message
[2:06:42] that what we have what we are how the
[2:06:46] devil came and caused men to fall Jesus
[2:06:50] came and he paid the price
[2:06:52] but yet there are so many in captivity
[2:06:54] today what God wants his children to
[2:06:57] know is you were created for the purpose
[2:07:00] of worshiping God for the purpose of
[2:07:02] serving God and he has done everything
[2:07:06] it doesn't matter what happened to you
[2:07:08] through the course he paid a price so at
[2:07:10] the end you can serve him
[2:07:16] again and that's why say Satan hate
[2:07:19] Revelation because Revelation is what
[2:07:21] that that's what opens up to you we are
[2:07:24] sitting here knowing that Satan has no
[2:07:27] power whatsoever he's a bluff the
[2:07:29] prophet calls
[2:07:31] him butam speaks in God's provided way
[2:07:34] he
[2:07:36] says notice now you say I bought a piece
[2:07:39] of ground isn't that it says isn't it
[2:07:41] your it's it isn't yours yet until
[2:07:44] you've got an abstract but if you got an
[2:07:46] abstract it shows that everything that
[2:07:49] ever against that piece of property of
[2:07:51] was tricking off it says then when
[2:07:54] you've got when when you've become a
[2:07:56] Christian and accepted Christ as your
[2:07:58] savior then it says when God sends down
[2:08:02] the abstract it shows that no matter
[2:08:05] what your father did what your mother
[2:08:08] did what anybody else did your mother
[2:08:11] your Daddy might have been a drunker a
[2:08:14] prostitute whatever it is every sin is
[2:08:17] strick off it's stricken off it says
[2:08:21] You' got the extra title there's nothing
[2:08:24] that can put it off off of it he says
[2:08:26] and look everything that's on that
[2:08:30] ground Belongs to You amen he says and
[2:08:33] when you are you are in Christ Jesus the
[2:08:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost every gift of
[2:08:40] God Belong To You belong in the church
[2:08:43] amen it's an
[2:08:45] abstract uh title deed it says you it's
[2:08:49] yours it belongs to you it's it quickens
[2:08:52] your mortal body oh my I think of
[2:09:02] it so let me say this this
[2:09:07] morning yeah we all gather you know how
[2:09:11] many are thankful for God giving us a
[2:09:13] new
[2:09:17] building but yet we
[2:09:20] are Sunday night and
[2:09:24] Wednesday it's pretty much what
[2:09:34] 50% what is really the purpose of our
[2:09:39] creation what is it that really we are
[2:09:41] striving for and looking for in this
[2:09:46] life and I'm not coming from the
[2:09:49] condemnation standpoint because it's not
[2:09:51] going to do you any
[2:09:55] good and I can give testimonies and I
[2:09:58] probably don't have time to do that but
[2:10:00] I believe that if you desire a job that
[2:10:04] can allow you to be here Sunday nights
[2:10:06] and
[2:10:07] Wednesdays God can make it happen
[2:10:10] because he done it for
[2:10:13] me in my younger days I took a job that
[2:10:16] was I couldn't be here on
[2:10:19] Wednesdays but God made a way for I can
[2:10:21] switch in a different position where I
[2:10:23] could be
[2:10:25] here the devil came and offered me more
[2:10:27] money to return to the old position I
[2:10:30] turned him down in turning him down God
[2:10:34] created another position for me that's
[2:10:37] the position I've held for almost 20
[2:10:39] years
[2:10:43] now it's not by my
[2:10:45] strength and we can go down the road
[2:10:48] here people have testimony how many have
[2:10:50] a testimony like that just raise your
[2:10:53] hand people that come here on Wednesday
[2:10:56] and Sunday night it's not because they
[2:10:58] can make they are stronger than the
[2:11:00] other the rest of us it's
[2:11:03] because if you show God your true heart
[2:11:07] desire but whatam says people stay home
[2:11:09] on Wednesday to watch I love suszie and
[2:11:12] all of that but God the Church of God is
[2:11:14] open yes but says if the church is open
[2:11:17] he will be
[2:11:19] there can I read the CR he says that if
[2:11:22] you are if you are truly born again you
[2:11:25] would esteem his word more than the
[2:11:38] meat now I'm I'm really coming down to
[2:11:41] possessing the land why don't we possess
[2:11:44] that land and say that the devil has got
[2:11:48] me so wed up you know I I'll tell you
[2:11:50] this anybody who's this every time I
[2:11:52] make extra money the devil finds a way
[2:11:54] to pull it
[2:11:57] off every time I'm like oh man if that
[2:12:00] deal works out I'm going to get me some
[2:12:01] money and all of the sudden I bills
[2:12:05] showed up that I didn't even know
[2:12:08] existed where did this come from how did
[2:12:11] my insurance
[2:12:16] double you see so it's trying to train
[2:12:20] us and I believe this with all my heart
[2:12:23] so we can understand that we don't live
[2:12:26] by our own physical
[2:12:28] effort it's by the word that we
[2:12:31] live I believe if something showed up
[2:12:34] where I couldn't afford it God will make
[2:12:36] a way for me to afford
[2:12:43] it the word is here for our protection
[2:12:48] yes a Christian has to have a healthy
[2:12:52] relationship with the word of God when
[2:12:54] we hear it is our promised land is what
[2:12:58] God has given us to give us the power to
[2:13:01] overcome with it's what's been given us
[2:13:04] for us to move into another position
[2:13:06] it's what's been given us for us to be
[2:13:08] ready for that other land that we just
[2:13:11] talked
[2:13:13] about but yet we hear the word who say
[2:13:16] oh I'm going no you don't have to make
[2:13:18] up anything I'm not asking anybody ready
[2:13:21] to go quit the job I'm asking you to go
[2:13:23] to God and say that I desire this how do
[2:13:26] I get it and let God reveal that to you
[2:13:34] amen this church was not
[2:13:36] buil for lack of
[2:13:39] challenges Co came by and all kinds of
[2:13:43] things and we pray seems like it was not
[2:13:45] possible not possible challenges and
[2:13:47] everything but God inspired our pastor
[2:13:49] and we came and we plowed through and
[2:13:51] everything and he did all that he could
[2:13:54] and then we have this
[2:13:55] building but how are we showing our
[2:13:58] Thanksgiving for
[2:14:01] it how are we showing our appreciation
[2:14:04] for what God has done for us how how is
[2:14:08] it that we're showing the urgency of the
[2:14:10] time that we are living
[2:14:18] in see
[2:14:21] so the word is not given for us to look
[2:14:23] at it and just read it and say press God
[2:14:26] we're going to get the promised land
[2:14:28] he's given for when you hear things like
[2:14:30] this you go okay what is the promise I
[2:14:34] was glad when they said unto me let's go
[2:14:36] into the house of God a Believer thinks
[2:14:39] is is the word of God more than Meats
[2:14:41] it's good for brothers together it's
[2:14:44] it's it says as David will say that it's
[2:14:46] beautiful for the bers to gather
[2:14:49] together and he says speaks about those
[2:14:50] things God you said in your word that
[2:14:52] it's wonderful for a Believer I don't
[2:14:54] want to be being somewhere else whether
[2:14:56] it be my job or anything else to take me
[2:14:59] away from the house of God why because
[2:15:02] by being here I'm showing on whose side
[2:15:04] I
[2:15:05] am let me say this the church support is
[2:15:08] not just money your presence is a
[2:15:11] support what you put in your prayer is a
[2:15:13] support supporting one another
[2:15:16] encouraging one another it's part of the
[2:15:18] support and let me say this this morning
[2:15:20] what we need to possess our Promised
[2:15:22] Land we need to take the revealed word
[2:15:25] of God and any room in our lives that's
[2:15:28] lacking that presence of God we need to
[2:15:30] say God I'm going to go and possess this
[2:15:33] you have given me the word I want to go
[2:15:35] and possess
[2:15:40] this and if you la money to put gas on
[2:15:44] everything I think God can provide that
[2:15:48] too if he send the disciple to get get
[2:15:51] him fish and get him out and take the
[2:15:52] money and pay the taxes I think he could
[2:15:54] do that he's done few
[2:15:59] Miracles he's known for being the god of
[2:16:02] the impossible but what says God keeps
[2:16:05] his
[2:16:07] word you know we read this message I was
[2:16:10] I I just I don't want to be too long if
[2:16:12] the musician could come we it talks
[2:16:14] about you know I I read like sometimes
[2:16:17] the voice of God reports and everything
[2:16:19] thing it said that believers trying to
[2:16:21] go to church and they get over someplace
[2:16:24] there's a flooded River they take the
[2:16:27] message book and some of you know this
[2:16:30] they lay it down and they pray and the
[2:16:32] river come down and they cross over to
[2:16:35] go to
[2:16:36] church that's your God that's the God of
[2:16:40] this message but whatam says we need to
[2:16:43] lift him out after the history we need
[2:16:45] to lift him up out out of the history
[2:16:48] let's not just keep him the god of the
[2:16:50] Bible who reside inside of the Bible the
[2:16:53] god of the Bible wants to be your God
[2:16:55] this morning he wants to live your life
[2:16:58] this morning he wants to walk with you
[2:17:00] this morning he wants to fight your
[2:17:02] battle this morning he wants to help you
[2:17:04] possess the land in fact baram says one
[2:17:07] place the reason why he didn't let them
[2:17:09] overcome the whole land in one time he
[2:17:11] says because of the Beast we're going to
[2:17:14] rise up on the
[2:17:17] land the reason he did is he wanted them
[2:17:21] to overcome one piece at the time one
[2:17:26] foot at the time he wanted to have
[2:17:28] fellowship with them he wants to have
[2:17:31] Fellowship in your overcoming he want to
[2:17:34] show you that he can overcome by a song
[2:17:37] he can overcome by a shout he can
[2:17:40] overcome by a word he can overcome by
[2:17:42] all means he can overcome by taking a
[2:17:45] lamp and and and and striking it and go
[2:17:47] causing confusion if you go read all the
[2:17:50] children of of Israel overcame he
[2:17:52] overcame by various different ways but
[2:17:56] all by his
[2:18:01] word let not this be a condemnation this
[2:18:04] morning but let it be something you
[2:18:06] resolve in your heart and say this
[2:18:08] morning God I'm a Son of
[2:18:11] God I I need to be in service for you
[2:18:14] you didn't create me so I can just make
[2:18:16] an extra dollar these hands were made to
[2:18:19] be raised for God my voice was given to
[2:18:23] me to speak the blessings of God my
[2:18:25] fruit were made for me to walk in the
[2:18:27] direction that God wants me to be my
[2:18:30] whole body was made for me to worship
[2:18:32] God so I can't take it just put a
[2:18:35] service for other things I want to use
[2:18:37] it for
[2:18:39] God I want every inch of my life to be
[2:18:42] used for
[2:18:47] God and if that's my purpose if that's
[2:18:51] what my desire is I believe that that
[2:18:53] same God will raise up out of History
[2:18:58] because when you when you believe his
[2:19:00] word you're calling him to come by your
[2:19:02] side and say watch now I'm going to
[2:19:05] prove my word to be true why he proves
[2:19:08] his word by
[2:19:17] [Applause]
[2:19:35] I don't know about you
[2:19:37] I I look at my life
[2:19:41] and and most of the time I'm
[2:19:45] ashamed I have so much overcoming to do
[2:19:50] so much possession to
[2:19:52] do I look and I go
[2:19:56] oh we haveed such a glorious
[2:20:04] message this message was just not
[2:20:06] preached to us and as a knowledge
[2:20:09] message so we can know
[2:20:11] it but this message was preached with
[2:20:14] power and demonstration of the
[2:20:17] spirit the very things that's promised
[2:20:20] in it God came and manifested it in the
[2:20:23] life of the messenger
[2:20:27] that's we have seen a surrendered
[2:20:31] son what he can do we have seen what the
[2:20:35] power of God in The Believer can bring
[2:20:37] to pass we have seen
[2:20:41] it so God was not going to be just to
[2:20:46] just tell us what's going to happen and
[2:20:50] and not show was an
[2:20:52] example he showed an example even in the
[2:20:55] very life of the prophet and and we call
[2:20:58] him the sheave wave offering so we as
[2:21:01] Believers we can look and say that oh I
[2:21:06] just don't hear the word itself but I
[2:21:09] actually have an example in front of me
[2:21:11] that I can
[2:21:13] become this is actually how I can become
[2:21:17] and I want us to come this morning and
[2:21:19] say look love is mine is my
[2:21:22] possession the holy spirit is my
[2:21:25] possession a good job to so I can come
[2:21:28] to church is my
[2:21:29] possession whatever it is sickness
[2:21:32] getting out of my body healing is my
[2:21:35] possession whatever I need is my
[2:21:37] possession he's given me that so I can
[2:21:40] be in position to serve him but whatam
[2:21:43] says it's in the line of duty anything
[2:21:45] that came when when Moses came to the
[2:21:47] Red Sea they were walking towards the
[2:21:50] Red Sea the Red Sea was on the way but
[2:21:52] whatam says that God looked at the Red
[2:21:55] Sea with Angry Eyes Hallelujah why
[2:21:58] because he was on the path to the
[2:22:00] promised land and let me say this to you
[2:22:02] anything that stands in your way that
[2:22:05] same God is here to look at it with
[2:22:07] Angry Eyes so it'll open
[2:22:10] up but the question is is it in our
[2:22:14] hearts to give all that we have all that
[2:22:18] we are to see that promise come to
[2:22:22] pass because if it's not then we're not
[2:22:25] going to ask it if it's not then we're
[2:22:28] going to be just happy with the piece of
[2:22:32] land that we have and say oh you know I
[2:22:35] decided that but you know I'm just fine
[2:22:37] with this and I desire to serve God but
[2:22:40] you know I'm just fine with here you
[2:22:42] know no it's your land your children is
[2:22:46] Your
[2:22:47] Land The Lost Ones is your land
[2:22:50] [Music]
[2:22:52] the land is not just given so you can
[2:22:54] have what you want and then say well
[2:22:56] praise God no the Holy Spirit was given
[2:22:59] so you can be in service for
[2:23:02] God where if he had a need he can come
[2:23:05] and say son I need you over there and
[2:23:08] you can say yes Father I'm at service
[2:23:10] for
[2:23:14] you that's the position we desire this
[2:23:16] morning and we can only get it by the
[2:23:19] word of God because he promise promised
[2:23:20] it to us let's just bow our
[2:23:23] heads our gracious father we're so
[2:23:25] thankful Lord
