[42:32] our gracious father
[42:35] those
[42:36] words so thrill us
[42:39] to know the promise that nothing can
[42:42] pluck us from the palm of your hand
[42:45] and when you started the work you'd
[42:47] finish it
[42:49] lord i just pray that through your word
[42:52] that
[42:53] we could all rise to a higher level of
[42:55] christianity
[42:57] be partakers of the great resurrection
[43:00] gift
[43:01] we ask you to bless each one that's here
[43:03] this evening may it be special to them
[43:06] for their sacrifice
[43:08] we just ask you to be with us now
[43:11] in jesus precious and
[43:13] wonderful name we pray
[43:15] amen
[43:17] and amen
[43:19] god bless you this evening let's turn
[43:21] over in our bibles to
[43:23] the book of romans and the fourth
[43:26] chapter and
[43:28] uh you know i i just enjoyed the word so
[43:31] much sunday
[43:33] that
[43:34] i'm just gonna stay right in it
[43:37] amen and just hope that as we go through
[43:40] a few more pages
[43:42] and a few more paragraphs it would
[43:46] really uh
[43:48] be a a blessing to us and
[43:52] we just want to lay this little
[43:54] foundation
[43:56] here
[43:57] out of
[43:58] romans because i think it's a really
[44:01] a beautiful thing if we read it i i've
[44:04] been listening to romans 4 and 5 a
[44:07] little bit here lately and it's really
[44:08] blessed me but let's say this
[44:11] as we read here in romans chapter 4 what
[44:14] shall
[44:15] we say then
[44:17] that abraham our father
[44:19] as pertaining to the flesh
[44:22] hath found
[44:24] so what did abraham find
[44:27] for if abraham were justified by works
[44:32] he hath wherefore to glory
[44:35] but not before god
[44:38] for what saith the scriptures
[44:41] abraham believed god
[44:44] and it was
[44:46] counted unto him
[44:48] for righteousness
[44:51] now to him that worketh
[44:54] is the reward not reckoned of grace
[44:58] but of debt
[45:00] so he's saying if you work to get it
[45:02] then you know you got what you deserve
[45:07] but
[45:09] he said but to him that worketh not
[45:12] but believeth on him that justifieth
[45:17] the ungodly
[45:19] his faith is counted for righteousness
[45:23] amen
[45:25] amen even as david also described the
[45:30] blessedness of the man
[45:34] unto whom god imputed righteousness
[45:38] without works
[45:40] amen so david even said blessed is the
[45:42] man
[45:44] you know that god imputes righteousness
[45:47] without works
[45:50] saying blessed are they
[45:53] whose iniquities are forgiven
[45:56] and whose sins are covered
[45:59] that's in psalms psalms 32 1
[46:02] and blessed is the
[46:04] man to whom the lord will not impute sin
[46:11] cometh this blessing then unto the
[46:14] circumcised only
[46:17] or unto the uncircumcised also
[46:21] for we say that faith was reckoned to
[46:25] abraham for righteousness
[46:28] how was it then reckoned
[46:30] when he was
[46:31] in circumcision
[46:33] or in uncircumcision
[46:37] not in circumcision but in
[46:40] uncircumcision may the lord add his
[46:42] blessing to his word amen
[46:45] amen you may be seated
[46:47] unless you want to stand up the whole
[46:49] service and
[46:50] that's good i think you all graduated
[46:52] from a m
[46:55] so uh
[46:56] anyway i i just enjoyed the word of the
[46:59] lord uh
[47:00] and uh the word of the lord just getting
[47:02] richer and
[47:03] and better and
[47:05] this is a beautiful scripture because uh
[47:08] man's always struggling with what part
[47:10] does he play in things
[47:13] and and uh
[47:15] it's hard to receive it so paul
[47:17] addresses it here he says you know
[47:19] abraham didn't do any works to receive
[47:22] the promise
[47:24] amen so it what was counted to him
[47:28] for being righteous was that he believed
[47:32] what god said
[47:34] and and that's also counted to us
[47:37] and also blessed is the man whom god
[47:40] does not
[47:41] impude sin to and that's great to us as
[47:45] gentiles because as the gentiles we know
[47:49] that we
[47:51] we came in to
[47:53] the world we were sinners we didn't have
[47:55] the promise of of
[47:58] of circumcision naturally that gave us a
[48:01] covenant to of inheritance but we were
[48:05] gentiles without the law
[48:08] and we know where there is no law
[48:10] there's no transgression
[48:12] and and so but yet our very natures we
[48:17] knew
[48:18] that sin dwelt in our mortal bodies and
[48:21] then bought god by his graciousness by
[48:24] his faith by his power
[48:28] amen he brought us to
[48:30] the realization by the quickening of our
[48:34] spirits he brought us under conviction
[48:37] and and through that move of grace so it
[48:41] wasn't that we were righteous and then
[48:44] obtained the grace of god but just like
[48:47] abraham's faith was not given in the
[48:50] righteousness of circumcision but it was
[48:53] given by the righteousness of faith that
[48:56] he believed god
[48:58] and just like for us we were in sin and
[49:01] god brought us under conviction and we
[49:04] believed that we were sinners and we
[49:07] therefore we cried out abba father
[49:10] and that's what was imputed to us for
[49:13] righteousness and then what was given to
[49:16] abraham was the sign of this agreement
[49:21] that he had between god that god said
[49:24] that he would multiply his children that
[49:28] that that they he would be blessed all
[49:31] the childrens of the earth would be
[49:33] blessed from him
[49:34] and that the promise would come through
[49:37] his seed so he gave them the covenant or
[49:40] a sign of circumcision in other words
[49:44] every one of your offspring all your
[49:46] males will all have this sign that
[49:50] they've received this covenant now we
[49:52] know that's bled over into christianity
[49:55] and things but the real
[49:57] circumcision for the christian is not a
[50:02] natural or physical because that was
[50:05] what was in the law
[50:07] that's what came down through adam
[50:10] and that's why that had to be given
[50:12] because the first adam was a living soul
[50:15] but now we have a covenant of
[50:18] circumcision and it's not the
[50:20] circumcision in the flesh it's the
[50:22] circumcision in the spirit
[50:25] and what that circumcision in the spirit
[50:28] does it separates us from all unbelief
[50:33] amen that's god's covenant to us that is
[50:36] blessing to us that we'll be totally
[50:39] separated from all unbelief can you
[50:42] imagine now
[50:44] this is what he's saying
[50:46] this is what he said i'm going to do for
[50:48] you
[50:49] amen not by works
[50:53] but by grace
[50:55] not but not that it's imputed to you
[50:58] because you earned it he says i'm going
[51:01] to give you a faith that will separate
[51:05] you from all doubt that's my covenant
[51:09] with my children and that's how they'll
[51:12] know that they are
[51:13] my children because they will believe
[51:16] god they'll believe every word of god
[51:19] that's they that that's the real
[51:21] circumcision
[51:22] is the circumcision from unbelief we
[51:25] think a lot of times that circumcision
[51:28] of the gentile circumcision is i don't
[51:32] drink i don't smoke i don't do this i
[51:34] don't do that he's trying to tell us
[51:37] it's not by that it's not the covenant
[51:40] by works it's the covenant of faith or
[51:43] revelation that you believe what god's
[51:47] word tells you
[51:48] and when god sees that so he's not going
[51:51] to impute
[51:54] the sin
[51:56] he's not going to lady or charge the
[51:59] works
[52:00] of unbelief
[52:02] but he's going to give you
[52:04] the faith
[52:06] to believe everything that god said so
[52:10] sin is an attribute of what
[52:13] unbelief so therefore if you believe god
[52:17] and you believe the word of god you sin
[52:20] not
[52:23] there's no charge to lay to you
[52:26] because he bore that
[52:28] at calvary
[52:29] amen so we're we're seeing that we're
[52:32] trying to move up
[52:34] and that's what we talked about sunday
[52:37] i i have you know
[52:38] it just seemed like it miraculously the
[52:41] holy spirit moved
[52:44] sunday just his presence was here
[52:46] just so mighty and strong in doing
[52:49] things and we were realizing and i
[52:51] believe the lord was here because
[52:55] we were touching into the things that
[52:58] our messenger wanted to share with us
[53:01] and we saw that there was there was a
[53:05] justification that's when a man is
[53:07] convicted
[53:08] of his sins and and and then all that
[53:11] he's done is justified by what he did in
[53:15] other words he never did it
[53:18] in the first place so there's nothing
[53:20] laid to his charge it's totally imputed
[53:23] and then we saw sanctification
[53:26] how a man that's been justified
[53:28] no longer wants to be associated with
[53:32] the sin that caused him and put him in
[53:35] the condition he was so you're not going
[53:38] to be justified is as if you never did
[53:41] it and then continued to do it
[53:46] i like the song the brother is saying if
[53:49] i didn't get it from the world so the
[53:52] world can't take it away
[53:54] amen so if you didn't get justification
[53:57] if you got justification from yourself
[54:00] then you're going to find yourself doing
[54:02] the same things over and again
[54:04] but praise god
[54:06] that he's got something he's offering
[54:08] that takes us away
[54:10] from the things
[54:13] and we if we could go into all with how
[54:15] one by sin came by one and by one how
[54:19] that all sin was taken away
[54:22] but it's wonderful so we see this great
[54:24] thing so in others when you're justified
[54:27] you no longer do the things anymore that
[54:30] you were freed from so therefore we call
[54:33] that sanctification
[54:36] so in other words if you're going to
[54:37] keep going
[54:39] you have to go to sanctification you
[54:42] can't stay there at justification i do
[54:44] wrong i go confess my sins priest gives
[54:47] me penance
[54:49] i go do wrong
[54:51] the catholics never got out of
[54:53] justification they're dying there
[54:58] that's why luther came out of it
[55:01] because they were stuck
[55:03] so he said no
[55:05] we're not saved by our repentance
[55:08] we're saved by his blood
[55:10] amen there's only one place to meet him
[55:12] and that's in the shed blood so we are
[55:15] sanctified and then he said then wesley
[55:17] came around said if we're sanctified
[55:19] then we're not going to keep doing those
[55:21] things and then we realize after that
[55:24] that god he gave the baptism of the holy
[55:27] spirit the restoration of gifts that
[55:29] that was and and we found out that when
[55:32] a believer's there he's got a deed
[55:36] so and we we talked about this so he
[55:38] claimed he laid whole
[55:41] and so we saw what that was in the
[55:44] believer is that he saw these promises
[55:46] of god and they said i believe them
[55:51] they're mine
[55:54] but that didn't stop satan
[55:57] from keep saying they're not yours
[56:00] they don't belong to you
[56:02] you are you are still guilty you're
[56:05] still the sinner you're still in bad
[56:08] shape you're all these things are are
[56:11] are still there and you're still in that
[56:13] battleground but now we found out that
[56:15] our messenger came along and said
[56:17] there's there's something else that goes
[56:20] beyond that
[56:26] oh
[56:27] and that only came by malachi 4 5.
[56:31] and that was the abstract
[56:34] or the original proof
[56:38] that you were
[56:40] the boundaries that he spoke in the
[56:43] beginning
[56:44] so in other words if you we're using
[56:47] property so if if you take all of texas
[56:51] or all of the world it's one great big
[56:54] massive world right but then somebody
[56:57] comes along and he says
[57:01] from this point to this point to this
[57:04] point to this point now will be
[57:08] uh
[57:10] texas all right so that's that's the
[57:14] abstract the original boundaries well
[57:18] you know so in the spiritual realm
[57:20] we say everybody's saved
[57:24] well everybody claims that
[57:26] but it doesn't it it makes you
[57:29] part of
[57:30] everybody
[57:33] so now you're just dealing with the
[57:35] crowd
[57:36] you're dealing with a
[57:38] religion we're all part of this a great
[57:42] big general thing and or we're all part
[57:44] of this a great big general group and
[57:47] and it's a group of group but this comes
[57:49] down to an individual affair
[57:52] where you
[57:54] get the abstract which brings you all
[57:58] the way back to the beginning and shows
[58:00] you that you were there in the beginning
[58:04] in his mind in his thinking in his
[58:07] attributes all the way from the
[58:08] beginning that's beyond the baptism of
[58:11] the holy spirit
[58:15] so that's what we're moving into
[58:18] we're moving in to receiving the
[58:21] abstract
[58:24] you know
[58:25] once you possess it you never have to be
[58:27] refilled with it
[58:32] you don't have to keep running to the
[58:34] altar
[58:36] it's over
[58:37] and that's where we're going to pick up
[58:40] tonight
[58:42] amen so we're going to start reading
[58:44] paragraph by terror gap and shouting and
[58:46] having a jubilee and
[58:48] a good time
[58:50] in the lord so we left off the other
[58:54] night right here
[58:56] at paragraph 295.
[59:00] so i'm going to call this tonight
[59:02] because i
[59:03] i don't really preach series so it's not
[59:05] the study of of uh this the seventh
[59:08] study every single one's a brand new
[59:11] fresh manna
[59:14] you know what i mean so i i wanna
[59:17] brother makes a statement and here he
[59:19] says and i'd like to call this the
[59:21] vindicated method
[59:25] all right
[59:26] so so he says he says now remember now
[59:30] quicking
[59:31] to see
[59:32] what these things are
[59:35] so remember he said zoe meant the spirit
[59:39] of god moving through you so watch the
[59:42] quickening power of the day that we live
[59:45] in so right this power quickened
[59:48] quickened luther it quickened wesley it
[59:51] quickened the believers and now there's
[59:54] a quickening power that
[59:57] for our time and day and that quickening
[1:00:00] power was returning the abstract
[1:00:04] another the proof
[1:00:07] to you
[1:00:09] individually
[1:00:12] the proof to you that you were there
[1:00:17] with him
[1:00:18] in the beginning
[1:00:22] oh
[1:00:23] my
[1:00:26] so you're you just watch as we read here
[1:00:29] it's it it it removes something so
[1:00:33] in other words we're all in a hope so
[1:00:37] i hope i live right i hope i do right
[1:00:40] i've got the spirit trying to help me
[1:00:43] live right i know it's the holy spirit
[1:00:45] because it convicts me of sin but can
[1:00:47] you imagine moving past that
[1:00:54] go where it's settled
[1:00:57] that you know
[1:00:59] beyond a shadow of a doubt not a hope
[1:01:02] not looking at your own life to see if
[1:01:05] if your life doesn't but it's absolutely
[1:01:08] been settled
[1:01:10] i know beyond a shadow of a doubt
[1:01:14] because i possess it right now i possess
[1:01:19] the proof
[1:01:21] that i was with him in the beginning
[1:01:25] everybody wants a birth certificate
[1:01:29] well i want my birth certificate to go
[1:01:32] way past the day i met him on the roof
[1:01:38] want my birthday
[1:01:40] to say that my name was on the lamb's
[1:01:43] book of life before the foundation of
[1:01:46] the beginning of the world that's what i
[1:01:48] want for my birth certificate because i
[1:01:51] just wasn't birthed when i came to the
[1:01:53] knowledge that i was a sinner
[1:01:56] i was in birth when i got sanctified i
[1:01:59] wasn't birthed when i got filled with
[1:02:01] the holy ghost i was birthed when he
[1:02:05] thought of me in the beginning
[1:02:07] so now i've got the proof of that in an
[1:02:10] abstract that he gives the believer and
[1:02:13] not everybody gets the abstract
[1:02:20] because the abstract only came through
[1:02:22] malachi 4-5
[1:02:27] i don't care what you say the abstract
[1:02:30] is
[1:02:31] the abstract when men
[1:02:33] lost the abstract it went back to him
[1:02:36] and it was in the book
[1:02:38] and he had to come open the book
[1:02:41] and he's the only one that can give out
[1:02:44] the abstract
[1:02:48] the original proof
[1:02:50] that you were with him in the beginning
[1:02:53] everybody else is living under a hope so
[1:02:56] everybody else is hoping that their sins
[1:02:58] are forgiven everybody else hopes
[1:03:00] they've got the holy ghost but you don't
[1:03:02] hope no there's no more hope so
[1:03:07] praise god
[1:03:09] you say that's right is that possible
[1:03:12] yes
[1:03:13] that's what he's trying to do
[1:03:16] in this age
[1:03:18] get rid of the in and out get rid of the
[1:03:21] ups and downs get rid of all those
[1:03:24] things so he says now remember
[1:03:26] he says now quicken it quickened to see
[1:03:30] what these things are
[1:03:34] that's what he wants to do
[1:03:37] watch the quickening power of this day
[1:03:42] remember we are quickened
[1:03:45] amen watch the quickening power
[1:03:48] of this day
[1:03:50] and so he's talking about the quick
[1:03:52] inner power of this day you guys can
[1:03:53] read but let's drop down to paragraph
[1:03:56] 303. said oh one day when i was weary
[1:04:01] myself
[1:04:02] i said
[1:04:05] he's i said you he said boy
[1:04:07] you'd better go ahead you're 50 years
[1:04:10] old
[1:04:11] if you're going to do anything for the
[1:04:13] lord you better hurry up and do it
[1:04:17] you're get
[1:04:18] you're getting old
[1:04:21] and there that morning the quickening
[1:04:24] power can't come
[1:04:26] and he let me look over the curtain
[1:04:30] and i've seen all
[1:04:33] you
[1:04:34] over
[1:04:35] there
[1:04:37] amen so what the quickening power took
[1:04:41] him all the way over
[1:04:46] i like that
[1:04:49] so the abstract takes us all the way
[1:04:51] back
[1:04:52] the quicking power in this day takes us
[1:04:55] all the way over
[1:04:57] hallelujah
[1:05:02] right
[1:05:04] that's what he said
[1:05:05] it i all that he said
[1:05:10] he looked over the curtain time and i've
[1:05:12] seen all of you
[1:05:14] over there huh see he said all that you
[1:05:18] ever loved
[1:05:20] and all
[1:05:22] that loved you
[1:05:25] they're given to you
[1:05:28] i've seen them all over there like that
[1:05:32] what was it quickening power
[1:05:35] you understand this quickening power is
[1:05:38] something that does not operate in the
[1:05:40] carnal realm it operates in the
[1:05:43] spiritual realm
[1:05:47] hallelujah you're a part of a move of
[1:05:50] zoe moving through you right now
[1:05:54] something that's living
[1:05:56] and producing fruit and living
[1:05:59] right now so that's that quickening
[1:06:02] power so he says let's look at the
[1:06:04] quickening power today so we can watch
[1:06:07] this quickening power move watch what
[1:06:10] it's doing watch what it's producing
[1:06:13] what it is so it's not some old stale
[1:06:16] study
[1:06:20] of the scriptures
[1:06:22] it's not some old study of message
[1:06:24] history
[1:06:26] it's a living resurrection god if you're
[1:06:29] doing what he wants and what did he
[1:06:32] promise to do in this day i'm going to
[1:06:34] take my sons and my daughters i'm going
[1:06:36] to give him the divine revelation of the
[1:06:39] abstract that they were with me in the
[1:06:41] beginning so that as he is so are we in
[1:06:46] this world
[1:06:51] and where did that happen
[1:06:54] how was that quickened how was that
[1:06:56] brought about how did the quickening
[1:06:59] power do it in this days he says
[1:07:03] he said quickening power
[1:07:05] and if the spirit that raised up christ
[1:07:08] from the dead dwell in you it'll quicken
[1:07:11] your mortal bodies
[1:07:12] mortal body remember the quickening
[1:07:16] power
[1:07:17] so let's get in tune with this power
[1:07:21] it's not theology
[1:07:25] it's not study
[1:07:26] it's revelation
[1:07:29] of the moment
[1:07:33] you see that it's revelation of where he
[1:07:36] is not where he's been
[1:07:42] he says now look
[1:07:45] at what we've seen
[1:07:47] in
[1:07:48] this day
[1:07:51] so what what did he say the quickening
[1:07:53] power was
[1:07:55] when we started their first quote the
[1:07:57] quickening power lets us
[1:07:59] see
[1:08:01] what's been
[1:08:02] done
[1:08:04] how many
[1:08:05] baptist churches
[1:08:08] are telling their people that the seven
[1:08:10] seals have been open and that malachi 4
[1:08:13] 5 was here
[1:08:16] an elohim stood in our midst discerning
[1:08:19] the thoughts and intents
[1:08:21] of the heart
[1:08:22] may not one
[1:08:25] no not one
[1:08:30] uh-uh
[1:08:31] but what let you see it
[1:08:36] quickening power the power of god oh
[1:08:40] wait a minute
[1:08:41] i'm a sinner
[1:08:45] wait a minute did you see it
[1:08:48] did abraham see it after he was
[1:08:50] circumcised or before he was circumcised
[1:08:55] the circumcision comes
[1:08:58] as a token
[1:09:00] showing you
[1:09:01] that you received it
[1:09:07] oh
[1:09:08] hallelujah
[1:09:12] i i mean
[1:09:13] just let's just read this if i can stick
[1:09:15] it like now i'm tired of people telling
[1:09:17] me i'm too long if you think i'm too
[1:09:20] long turn off your computer
[1:09:24] if you think i'm too long get up and go
[1:09:27] home

[1:09:33] don't want to leave it so if if i can
[1:09:36] stay in it for three hours i'm gonna
[1:09:38] stay in it for three hours you don't
[1:09:40] have to join me
[1:09:44] but don't rob me of my joy
[1:09:47] with your with your
[1:09:49] too long

[1:09:56] five-layer
[1:10:00] dessert i just eat and when that's gone
[1:10:05] you know i
[1:10:06] i love leslie's lasagna i'll sit down
[1:10:08] one day i used to be working and i
[1:10:10] thought young man i hold a pan of
[1:10:12] lasagna she used to make two pans one
[1:10:15] for me and one for everybody else
[1:10:21] so
[1:10:22] you know what i mean like i say you
[1:10:24] leave whenever you want this says look
[1:10:26] what we've seen in this day
[1:10:28] all right so now he's pointing out part
[1:10:31] of the quickening power
[1:10:33] that you know you have the quickening
[1:10:35] power is that watch the quickening power
[1:10:38] he says it lets you see
[1:10:45] right because that that's what's so
[1:10:47] that's so beautiful about it
[1:10:50] he and then this is what paul said he
[1:10:52] said and i think our lord said and so
[1:10:56] did paul what the father hath showed me
[1:10:59] i have not held nothing back
[1:11:03] i tell you and in these last days when
[1:11:06] we seen his quickening power upon us
[1:11:13] oh my what showing us things
[1:11:17] what did the spirit do when the spirit
[1:11:19] comes he will show you things
[1:11:21] to come
[1:11:22] hallelujah
[1:11:24] all right so he says look what we've
[1:11:26] seen in this day the quickening power
[1:11:28] has come to us to open
[1:11:32] the seven seals
[1:11:36] so now you saw that didn't you
[1:11:40] you saw those seals
[1:11:42] you saw what they were what they
[1:11:43] revealed who those horse riders were who
[1:11:46] those things were that was the
[1:11:47] quickening power that let you see that
[1:11:51] that came because the abstract is being
[1:11:54] returned to you and now you're seeing
[1:11:56] what it is that you possess
[1:12:02] yeah what what was that the intelligence
[1:12:05] of a man
[1:12:08] know the quickening power of god
[1:12:11] see the quickening power of god foretold
[1:12:15] this would take place
[1:12:17] see the quickening power of god made the
[1:12:20] world testify to it
[1:12:24] it's the truth
[1:12:26] the angels of the lord i told you was
[1:12:28] around in a pillar of fire quickening
[1:12:31] power let the world testify that it's
[1:12:35] the truth
[1:12:42] you're a part of that
[1:12:46] what was imputed
[1:12:48] for righteousness
[1:12:50] that you live some great holy life or
[1:12:52] that when you saw the pillar of fire you
[1:12:55] said that's that's elohim the same
[1:12:57] yesterday today and forever what was
[1:13:00] imputed for you for righteousness
[1:13:02] that when you saw the cloud
[1:13:04] that that you said that was a missile
[1:13:06] rocket
[1:13:11] you know all these guys think they're
[1:13:13] dis
[1:13:14] proving the message that they're just
[1:13:17] proving
[1:13:18] their judgment
[1:13:21] that ain't imputed to righteousness
[1:13:24] any
[1:13:25] bird brain
[1:13:27] can come up with a rocket theory
[1:13:29] but it takes quickening power to see it
[1:13:32] as jesus christ the same yesterday to
[1:13:35] them you can't do that carnally you got
[1:13:38] to do it by the resurrected power of
[1:13:41] the quickening
[1:13:47] amen
[1:13:49] uh
[1:13:49] the quickening power let the world
[1:13:52] testify that it's the truth
[1:13:54] and in that they didn't know what it was
[1:13:58] and we know
[1:13:59] just look
[1:14:01] this
[1:14:03] just look this away and it's our lord
[1:14:07] jesus up there you see
[1:14:11] hallelujah
[1:14:13] what is that
[1:14:15] what is that's working in you
[1:14:20] it's the it's quickening power working
[1:14:22] in you if you get it mixed up with the
[1:14:25] baptism of the holy ghost you'll be
[1:14:27] running in a circle
[1:14:29] you've got the holy ghost
[1:14:37] oh i'll let those
[1:14:39] let that just eat up the people that are
[1:14:41] hung up on evidence
[1:14:46] hey when you get this abstract
[1:14:49] what did we just read nobody can take it
[1:14:53] away nobody can say you don't got the
[1:14:55] holy ghost wait a minute
[1:14:59] i got proof
[1:15:04] and then
[1:15:05] and what did we say that the
[1:15:07] the proof was is that it it drew you
[1:15:10] closer to the word wasn't that what the
[1:15:13] proof of it was if it draws you away
[1:15:15] from the word it's not him but when it
[1:15:18] draws you closer to the word you know
[1:15:20] it's him
[1:15:21] okay amen
[1:15:23] and so
[1:15:24] that that he says now look how can you
[1:15:27] say that the spirit dwells in you
[1:15:29] though you've done everything that you
[1:15:32] thought was right
[1:15:33] here is your evidence
[1:15:38] here is your evidence
[1:15:40] you want to know if the spirit of god's
[1:15:42] working in you here is your evidence
[1:15:44] whether you got it or not if the spirit
[1:15:47] that was in christ is in you
[1:15:50] it also quickens you to the word
[1:15:54] so when you think that you see the seals
[1:15:56] because of you're some intellectual
[1:16:02] if the world give it to you the world
[1:16:04] can take it away
[1:16:06] and that's why they can walk with it all
[1:16:09] the wine they want and what happened the
[1:16:12] world gave it to him and therefore the
[1:16:15] world took it away
[1:16:17] but when he give it to you the world can
[1:16:20] never take it away
[1:16:24] right
[1:16:26] and it quickens you to the word
[1:16:28] for he is the word
[1:16:30] and if
[1:16:32] and if it contrary quickens you away
[1:16:35] from the word then it isn't the spirit
[1:16:38] of christ
[1:16:39] care what you've done
[1:16:41] until that moves you in the word my keep
[1:16:46] hear my voice and they shall
[1:16:49] live by every word every word
[1:16:52] uh as i was talking
[1:16:54] the other
[1:16:56] day
[1:16:57] so we're just coming down here so he
[1:16:59] said i got weary and so we know he says
[1:17:01] now look at this this opened the seven
[1:17:04] seals it wasn't the intellect of man
[1:17:07] he's the one
[1:17:09] who opened those seals
[1:17:13] see you're not when you have this
[1:17:15] abstract
[1:17:16] and you know what was in the beginning
[1:17:20] then then when those seals are open
[1:17:24] you say that that's him
[1:17:27] that's him
[1:17:29] because it came by malachi 4 5.
[1:17:33] and that that's in you he he gives that
[1:17:35] to you and that when you receive that
[1:17:38] you receive that quickly power and you
[1:17:40] say oh my goodness it's by by that that
[1:17:44] i saw the seals were open it was by that
[1:17:47] i saw the church age messenger it was by
[1:17:49] that power i saw the son of man you
[1:17:52] understand that
[1:17:53] quickening power was working you all the
[1:17:57] way from the beginning
[1:18:02] bringing you into the statue of a
[1:18:04] perfect man that he could deliver that
[1:18:07] capstone and what that capstone is it's
[1:18:10] the abstract deed
[1:18:16] that's what capped you off
[1:18:18] you love him and he loves you
[1:18:21] and nothing can move that
[1:18:25] and though he says here
[1:18:27] he says
[1:18:28] he said now let's just read it says he
[1:18:31] says that who and open them seven seals
[1:18:34] for the whole world the whole word of
[1:18:38] god
[1:18:39] is christ
[1:18:43] and christ is
[1:18:45] the seals
[1:18:47] that was opened
[1:18:52] oh
[1:18:53] amen what is the opening of the seals
[1:18:56] then
[1:18:57] revealing christ
[1:19:02] revealing what
[1:19:04] you're abstract
[1:19:05] because remember as we read because you
[1:19:08] were in him
[1:19:09] when he went to calvary you were in him
[1:19:12] when he rose you were in those seals you
[1:19:16] are in those thunders
[1:19:21] look at it
[1:19:24] and ever
[1:19:25] and the very seven angels was
[1:19:27] represented the seven church ages all
[1:19:29] completed
[1:19:31] and we couldn't even see it they did
[1:19:34] they took the picture not us
[1:19:37] and there he is standing there supreme
[1:19:41] judge
[1:19:42] showing that he is alpha and omega
[1:19:50] hallelujah
[1:19:52] and
[1:19:53] he said showing his alpha and omega the
[1:19:56] beginning and the end
[1:19:58] what identification
[1:20:01] quickening power did that
[1:20:05] to
[1:20:06] us
[1:20:13] what's he trying to do
[1:20:14] get rid of the doubt
[1:20:17] if you don't believe that was him
[1:20:20] and you don't believe that was him
[1:20:23] then you're going to be struggling with
[1:20:24] this message
[1:20:27] if you're going to think man gave it to
[1:20:29] you
[1:20:30] right well that's why he didn't build
[1:20:32] his church on intellect he built his
[1:20:35] church on divine revelation he built his
[1:20:39] church on quickening power
[1:20:45] are you ready for the next
[1:20:48] sentence
[1:20:50] quickening power
[1:20:51] let us see
[1:20:52] his coming
[1:20:59] why
[1:21:03] what what was he doing
[1:21:05] when he came
[1:21:08] he was delivering
[1:21:10] the abstract
[1:21:12] you are already resurrected
[1:21:18] here here it is here take this
[1:21:20] personally
[1:21:21] for you it's not a group
[1:21:23] i'm going to let you see
[1:21:26] what i did for you i'm returning to you
[1:21:30] through the opening of the seals
[1:21:32] the the finishing of the church age the
[1:21:35] return of the capstone
[1:21:37] i'm letting you see that you are in
[1:21:40] christ
[1:21:44] let's just follow it just a little bit
[1:21:46] more
[1:21:49] the quickening power let us see is
[1:21:52] coming
[1:21:54] amen so he's just talking he was talking
[1:21:56] all that the quickening power did how it
[1:21:59] told people what was wrong with them how
[1:22:01] it was discerning how it discerned the
[1:22:04] thoughts and intents of the heart you
[1:22:05] can read it there so what was that
[1:22:09] that was all him vindicating
[1:22:12] watch the method now
[1:22:15] how he's vindicating he's showing you
[1:22:17] things he's opening your eyes he he's
[1:22:20] vindicating it was him because he's
[1:22:23] going to those that see it and believe
[1:22:26] it and receive that attribute
[1:22:30] there's something that's going to be
[1:22:32] shown to them he says now how did he do
[1:22:35] it why
[1:22:37] why could he say destroy this body in
[1:22:39] three days i'll be raise it up why
[1:22:44] why why did he say that he knew that it
[1:22:48] was written of him
[1:22:50] see
[1:22:51] that's it it was written of him by the
[1:22:54] word of god which could not fail
[1:22:58] isn't this written of you
[1:23:03] as he is in this world
[1:23:06] okay this wherein
[1:23:11] that we know the love of god
[1:23:16] right
[1:23:17] how do we know the capstone how do we
[1:23:19] know the love how do we know that god's
[1:23:22] love is as he
[1:23:24] is
[1:23:25] so
[1:23:26] are we
[1:23:27] in this world
[1:23:31] i should have that
[1:23:33] place in john memorized but i keep
[1:23:35] forgetting it
[1:23:38] it just takes a second to look it up
[1:23:41] but that's how how do we know we got the
[1:23:43] capstone
[1:23:45] because as he is
[1:23:47] so are we
[1:23:48] that's the title deed so don't
[1:23:51] kill yourself
[1:23:54] because you're not there understand the
[1:23:56] quickening power is here to bring you
[1:23:59] there
[1:24:00] start believing the word of god
[1:24:07] he said
[1:24:09] and he says and we go the show he says
[1:24:12] why he knew what the word said of them
[1:24:15] and he says
[1:24:17] let's go to 3 14. why it was prophesied
[1:24:20] the word of god and prophecy if the true
[1:24:24] word of god cannot fail
[1:24:26] and the same prophecy and word of god
[1:24:29] that said
[1:24:30] he'd
[1:24:32] raise him up
[1:24:33] said that we are already raised with him
[1:24:41] so what what do you
[1:24:42] believe children of abraham
[1:24:46] do you believe the promise
[1:24:48] so what is imputed to you for
[1:24:51] righteousness
[1:24:52] not your beautiful message works
[1:24:58] but you believe
[1:25:00] what he promised you
[1:25:02] abraham believed something that was
[1:25:05] totally unbelievable
[1:25:08] now he's asking you to believe something
[1:25:11] that's totally unbelievable that i'm
[1:25:13] already risen
[1:25:16] i'm already raptured i'm already
[1:25:19] resurrected i'm already there hallelujah
[1:25:28] oh i think i'm going to get raptured out
[1:25:29] of here
[1:25:30] i may not even make it to missouri
[1:25:36] turn me off i've just started
[1:25:41] press your star carter get it nice
[1:25:43] warmed up or cool down for you
[1:25:46] but i'm telling you
[1:25:48] it it
[1:25:50] it's it's
[1:25:51] a
[1:25:53] no wonder he said fear not
[1:25:56] and it's written that the spirit that is
[1:25:59] now
[1:26:01] was in him
[1:26:02] now in us
[1:26:05] also quickens our mortal body fear not
[1:26:08] friend the s-o-n is up
[1:26:15] so now
[1:26:16] so he's he's going to wipe out this
[1:26:19] whole word of message of the hour is to
[1:26:22] wipe out unbelief
[1:26:26] why couldn't men have faith because they
[1:26:29] were denominational creeds and you can't
[1:26:32] have faith without the pure
[1:26:34] unadulterated word of god
[1:26:37] because faith's resting place is what
[1:26:40] the word of god so you've never had a
[1:26:44] place
[1:26:45] to rest your
[1:26:46] your abstract
[1:26:48] you've never had a land to claim you've
[1:26:51] never had something that says this is me
[1:26:54] and tell them
[1:26:56] hallelujah until the message was
[1:26:58] revealed
[1:27:06] no i don't want that delivered by
[1:27:07] emotion
[1:27:10] i want to deliver by word
[1:27:15] revelation that's right
[1:27:19] so he's trying to get rid of unbelief
[1:27:22] so listen what he says
[1:27:24] so
[1:27:25] what what were they worried about
[1:27:28] back in the days
[1:27:29] who died and who was living
[1:27:33] paul says don't worry
[1:27:35] right
[1:27:36] those that have going on aren't going to
[1:27:38] hinder you
[1:27:39] and you're not going to hinder them
[1:27:41] why
[1:27:42] this is what
[1:27:43] matter 3 3 15 now look at the
[1:27:46] transfiguration
[1:27:49] we was everyone represented there
[1:27:57] so when he was glorified
[1:28:01] and the dead were raised with him
[1:28:04] then
[1:28:07] we were there then
[1:28:11] there was the living saints that had
[1:28:14] raptured
[1:28:16] there was elijah standing there
[1:28:19] and there stood moses the dead saints
[1:28:21] represented also
[1:28:24] both of them had quickening power
[1:28:26] whether one died
[1:28:28] or the other one didn't die
[1:28:30] they were all there
[1:28:33] [Music]
[1:28:34] hey man whether i die it doesn't matter
[1:28:37] to me because i got it
[1:28:41] whether i die i'll be there someone says
[1:28:43] oh if i miss the rapture
[1:28:47] come on come on breathe oh what
[1:28:53] there's going to be a lot of us that
[1:28:54] believe this message that aren't going
[1:28:56] in the rapture
[1:28:57] you know why because we do all
[1:28:59] alternative things
[1:29:01] instead of coming to church we watch
[1:29:03] online that's an alternative
[1:29:08] right instead of
[1:29:09] giving to the body and be a part of the
[1:29:11] body we just live our own little life
[1:29:14] that's an alternative
[1:29:16] so you know what going through the
[1:29:18] judgment is
[1:29:21] it's an
[1:29:22] alternative you'll still be there
[1:29:26] you're just going to go a different way
[1:29:28] because you took a different way
[1:29:30] you were still elected your name was
[1:29:33] still on the lamb's book of life
[1:29:37] but you're just going to go a different
[1:29:38] way
[1:29:40] the prophet of god they prophesied him
[1:29:42] because thou hath chosen the narrow way
[1:29:46] and the straight way
[1:29:48] white is the way to destruction and many
[1:29:50] be there yeah i'm saved my name yep you
[1:29:53] are
[1:29:56] you'll get your abstract
[1:29:59] but you're just gonna have to go an
[1:30:01] alternative way
[1:30:02] you're gonna have to be when it's so
[1:30:04] dark and so miserable and there's so
[1:30:06] much judgment and so much tribulation
[1:30:09] you're going to have to get serious with
[1:30:11] god you know why because you didn't get
[1:30:14] serious with god now
[1:30:19] so take the easy way and you'll get your
[1:30:21] reward the hard way
[1:30:23] take the hard way you'll get your reward
[1:30:25] now
[1:30:28] that's the gospel
[1:30:31] so sit back in your easy chair and drink
[1:30:33] your cup of coffee
[1:30:36] fine
[1:30:41] you say well there's no room in church
[1:30:43] for me because you have to have some
[1:30:45] sort of kind of air condition padded
[1:30:47] seat comfort
[1:30:52] i've been on the hillside where they
[1:30:54] said the sermon of the mount was
[1:30:56] preached
[1:30:57] there was no comfortable seating
[1:31:02] those people were sitting
[1:31:04] and standing on a rolling hillside
[1:31:08] their backs hurting their necks hurt and
[1:31:10] everything but you know some once they
[1:31:12] got in that quickening power of that
[1:31:15] anointed work there was no time
[1:31:19] how much time do you think it took
[1:31:22] to feed
[1:31:23] 4 000 people
[1:31:27] and to collect all those baskets would
[1:31:30] you have ran off
[1:31:32] or would you have been in the revival
[1:31:34] watching every bread come get picked up
[1:31:37] and all of a sudden have all these
[1:31:39] baskets left over and just rejoicing and
[1:31:42] what the miracle is
[1:31:47] maybe better not maybe it's better that
[1:31:50] you don't come
[1:31:51] and keep all our faith down
[1:31:56] because i want to see the signs of
[1:31:58] wonder
[1:31:59] i want to see what's promised to me
[1:32:02] shall we go a little further are you
[1:32:04] ready to quit
[1:32:06] again please uh feel free
[1:32:09] he said
[1:32:10] he said we are both represented there he
[1:32:13] says notice oh look
[1:32:15] what we are now seeing in these last
[1:32:19] days
[1:32:22] the same thing that he promised
[1:32:26] in john 14 12
[1:32:29] the works that i do
[1:32:32] shall you
[1:32:33] do also that's remember we just preached
[1:32:37] this sunday that's what the abstract
[1:32:39] does
[1:32:40] the abstract makes you
[1:32:42] him
[1:32:45] it gives you permission
[1:32:48] to do what he did
[1:32:52] that's what we're seeing we're seeing
[1:32:54] the permission
[1:32:56] to be
[1:32:57] the sons and daughters of god what does
[1:33:00] the scripture say god so loved the world
[1:33:04] he gave them power to become the sons
[1:33:08] and daughters of god
[1:33:15] so if
[1:33:16] if
[1:33:17] the love of god
[1:33:21] is the capstone
[1:33:25] and so if the love of god
[1:33:27] returns
[1:33:29] which is why he sent jesus
[1:33:33] to bear our sins if the love of god says
[1:33:36] then the power to be sons and daughters
[1:33:40] of god has to return
[1:33:44] the very foundation
[1:33:48] of every church
[1:33:50] is that he gives them power to become
[1:33:53] the sons and daughters of god so they
[1:33:55] throw that off an eternity somewhere so
[1:33:58] they can live like the world act like
[1:34:01] the world talk like the world
[1:34:07] but to confess that jesus christ has not
[1:34:09] come in the flesh is an anti-christ
[1:34:12] spirit
[1:34:14] what is
[1:34:15] now
[1:34:16] if the scripture said
[1:34:18] that he gave his son
[1:34:20] so we could become the sons and
[1:34:22] daughters of god if we deny
[1:34:27] to become the sons and daughters of god
[1:34:30] then we're denying that he came
[1:34:36] because we're saying he didn't
[1:34:37] accomplish
[1:34:40] but remember we read it that he proved
[1:34:43] that we were there by raising up
[1:34:48] lord
[1:34:53] he says so 317
[1:34:58] we're just like them out mount
[1:35:00] transfiguration
[1:35:03] that's right
[1:35:05] wait a minute
[1:35:09] have you put yourself there
[1:35:11] that's what satan's been trying to keep
[1:35:13] us from doing
[1:35:16] is claiming who we are
[1:35:18] no wonder the prophet of god said we've
[1:35:20] used this quote for so long in this
[1:35:22] message totally clueless
[1:35:25] when the church recognizes who she is
[1:35:28] she'll become an invincible army
[1:35:30] yeah let's run around in circles
[1:35:39] what
[1:35:40] it's when we realize hey i was at mount
[1:35:42] saint figuration
[1:35:44] when we realized i've got the abstract
[1:35:46] i've got the permission
[1:35:49] then i'll be coming in
[1:35:52] okay but if you're going to be the sons
[1:35:55] of cephas
[1:35:59] and you're going to go and say in the
[1:36:00] name of jesus
[1:36:03] the devil is going to look at you and
[1:36:05] say jesus i know
[1:36:07] and paul i know
[1:36:10] but where's your abstract
[1:36:17] in this day you would be able to say
[1:36:20] i've got the capstone
[1:36:22] i've received it by the pillar of fire
[1:36:24] malachi 4 5. i've seen in the revelation
[1:36:27] of the seven seals
[1:36:30] don't try to use just the baptism of the
[1:36:32] holy ghost as your identification
[1:36:35] because that fell on the just and the
[1:36:38] unjust and the anointed ones at the end
[1:36:41] time this is an elect lady
[1:36:44] that is receiving her abstract because
[1:36:47] her abstract is her participation
[1:36:50] in the rapture
[1:36:56] am i okay
[1:36:58] no i'm not i'm crazy
[1:37:02] look at
[1:37:03] certainly
[1:37:05] he says
[1:37:07] we were just like them at mount
[1:37:08] transfiguration now listen to this this
[1:37:11] is important
[1:37:17] certainly we do not claim power
[1:37:22] but we
[1:37:23] like they was
[1:37:25] on mount
[1:37:26] transfiguration
[1:37:28] they wasn't saying
[1:37:30] moses said see who
[1:37:32] see who
[1:37:33] i am
[1:37:35] this disciple said
[1:37:37] see who i am
[1:37:39] see who i am
[1:37:41] you know
[1:37:42] what happened notice they seen jesus
[1:37:46] glorified
[1:37:48] don't miss this
[1:37:51] because this is the method
[1:37:59] this is a vindicated method
[1:38:02] this is how god does he doesn't lift you
[1:38:04] up he humbles you
[1:38:06] listen now
[1:38:08] he said
[1:38:10] he said they wasn't saying most say see
[1:38:12] who see who i am the disciples didn't
[1:38:16] say see who i am see who i am
[1:38:18] you know what happened notice they've
[1:38:21] seen jesus glorified that's all they
[1:38:25] wanted to see
[1:38:27] represented
[1:38:28] jesus glorified
[1:38:31] that's all they wanted to see
[1:38:34] was jesus glorified and that's all they
[1:38:37] wanted to represent
[1:38:39] was jesus glorified they didn't want to
[1:38:42] represent themselves they didn't want
[1:38:44] everybody to look around i'm a preacher
[1:38:46] i've got a message see how good i preach
[1:38:50] see how important i am see what i know
[1:38:53] see how smart i am
[1:38:58] i've been there
[1:39:02] and you know something
[1:39:04] once i knew i had it for myself
[1:39:07] it didn't matter anymore
[1:39:10] don't matter to me how long you think i
[1:39:12] preach it don't matter if you think
[1:39:13] you're in church ages it don't matter no
[1:39:17] more
[1:39:19] there's only one thing
[1:39:21] that's important and is that's him
[1:39:24] glorified
[1:39:27] that was him glorified
[1:39:29] that was him glorified that was him
[1:39:33] glorified
[1:39:35] if they don't like it
[1:39:38] i don't care i only want to preach to
[1:39:41] the bride anyway
[1:39:46] they're the only ones going to pray for
[1:39:47] me anyway
[1:39:49] right
[1:39:50] yes sir
[1:39:53] it's him
[1:39:55] it's him
[1:39:56] him glorified
[1:39:58] right
[1:39:59] so he says
[1:40:01] and so it is today
[1:40:04] we don't try to be some big person
[1:40:07] we don't care what people say about us
[1:40:10] our name ain't nothing
[1:40:12] it's his name
[1:40:15] our life isn't nothing
[1:40:17] it's his life
[1:40:18] it's his power
[1:40:20] not our power and there's only one thing
[1:40:24] that we love to do
[1:40:27] is see
[1:40:29] him
[1:40:30] glorified praise the lord wouldn't that
[1:40:33] change the whole way you worship the
[1:40:34] church wouldn't that change the whole
[1:40:37] way you sang wouldn't that change how
[1:40:39] you came in the church i'm not coming
[1:40:41] here i'm not coming here for someone to
[1:40:43] see my new hat my new suit i'm not
[1:40:46] coming here to let everybody know how
[1:40:48] down i am and how blue i am and how
[1:40:51] rough life is woes me woes me i oh no i
[1:40:56] come in the door to leave praises i come
[1:40:59] in the door to glorify his name i come
[1:41:02] here to sing of his wonders
[1:41:05] [Applause]
[1:41:08] that's what i'm
[1:41:10] come for
[1:41:12] i don't have to worry about my salvation
[1:41:16] when i walk in the door i come to
[1:41:18] glorify god so those who aren't saved
[1:41:22] will get saved so those who don't have
[1:41:24] the spirit will get the spirit those who
[1:41:27] haven't realized the abstract will
[1:41:29] realize the abstract
[1:41:31] i'm here to glorify him and whatever he
[1:41:34] wants to do
[1:41:42] he says
[1:41:43] so is it today
[1:41:45] not trying to be a big person we don't
[1:41:47] care what people say arm names nothing
[1:41:49] it's his name our life is nothing it's
[1:41:52] his life his power
[1:41:54] not our power and there's only one thing
[1:41:56] that we love to do is see him glorified
[1:41:59] and how can it be
[1:42:02] when his glory
[1:42:05] when he's glorified in us
[1:42:10] by his resurrection
[1:42:13] in us
[1:42:15] we
[1:42:16] see him
[1:42:17] represented again
[1:42:20] as
[1:42:21] he was
[1:42:24] today
[1:42:27] as he was
[1:42:29] so are we
[1:42:31] we see him glorified as he was
[1:42:36] in us
[1:42:40] if not then we just picked up a message
[1:42:42] religion spirit
[1:42:46] it's not glorifying him
[1:42:48] it's glorifying our interpretation of
[1:42:50] the message it's glorifying our form of
[1:42:53] church order it's glorifying our
[1:42:56] doctrines
[1:43:01] it isn't
[1:43:03] it's glorifying
[1:43:05] because he's the same
[1:43:07] yesterday
[1:43:08] today and forever tell me all those
[1:43:12] things that brother brahm said aren't
[1:43:14] taking on new meaning
[1:43:16] it's becoming a new book
[1:43:22] that's part of us going back
[1:43:24] being restored back
[1:43:27] is back to glorifying him
[1:43:30] we've been a lot of time glorifying
[1:43:32] ourselves
[1:43:33] i'm the bride i'm the bride i'm the
[1:43:36] bride i'm the bride
[1:43:39] look at me i'm the bride i'm the bride
[1:43:44] and people look back and says
[1:43:46] well i don't know who you married
[1:43:49] but if they're making you like this i
[1:43:50] don't want no part of it
[1:43:56] remember my mom tells a story about the
[1:43:57] little washer girl
[1:44:01] the closer he got
[1:44:03] the unmerley she felt
[1:44:05] she was pulling down her dress and
[1:44:08] putting down the dish pan
[1:44:10] and the more he talked to her the more
[1:44:13] he well i'm just a
[1:44:14] i'm just a little servant you know
[1:44:17] amen but he made her a promise
[1:44:21] you're my wife
[1:44:26] my word
[1:44:27] is as good as gold
[1:44:30] and i'm gonna come back and pick you up
[1:44:35] and she made herself ready
[1:44:40] the foreman had an eye on her
[1:44:44] the foreman in this day says will they
[1:44:46] believe my word will they believe my
[1:44:48] word will they have toured us in his
[1:44:50] word given us something greater to
[1:44:52] believe
[1:44:54] as our faith grew
[1:44:56] now he's got us to the time to come to
[1:44:59] john 14
[1:45:00] 12
[1:45:01] the works that i do
[1:45:03] you should do also
[1:45:05] or just about the clothes
[1:45:10] i could feel his spirit settling in
[1:45:18] he said
[1:45:19] when he's glorified in us
[1:45:21] by his resurrection that's in us
[1:45:23] we see him represented again
[1:45:26] as he was
[1:45:29] today
[1:45:30] did you get that yes see our desire is
[1:45:34] not to glorify
[1:45:35] our desire is not some big name
[1:45:39] our desire is not boost some church
[1:45:42] or make
[1:45:43] some more in sunday school
[1:45:46] or try to bring in hog tie push in
[1:45:50] offer a
[1:45:51] picnic party or bring stars and buttons
[1:45:55] or something else like that no
[1:45:59] that that's not our desire
[1:46:01] our desire is to see him glorified
[1:46:04] glorified what
[1:46:06] not with self-pride
[1:46:10] but in us our lives
[1:46:13] to prove
[1:46:15] he
[1:46:16] is alive
[1:46:18] and living in us
[1:46:21] so your words
[1:46:24] your testimony what you talk about
[1:46:27] what you share
[1:46:30] you're sharing he lives
[1:46:33] he's here amen he can do the same works
[1:46:36] in me that he did you need prayer let me
[1:46:39] pray for you
[1:46:41] he's alive he's the same that's your
[1:46:44] testimony
[1:46:46] you don't hide your life
[1:46:48] under the testimony of william branham
[1:46:55] and all that he did
[1:46:57] so you don't have to be a christian
[1:47:03] you know i know somebody just said oh he
[1:47:04] said something bad about william brown
[1:47:06] no i didn't
[1:47:08] william branham was the representation
[1:47:11] of christ in flesh in our day
[1:47:15] the first fruit waved over
[1:47:17] to show us
[1:47:19] that we also could come to that maturity
[1:47:28] so people tried to be i'm getting to my
[1:47:30] point
[1:47:31] just started to preach
[1:47:34] i pray that god gives you strength in
[1:47:36] the morning
[1:47:38] and that your kids are good in school
[1:47:40] and if you homeschool let them sleep in
[1:47:45] but this great beautiful
[1:47:48] representation that we're we're not
[1:47:51] we're not always trying to build
[1:47:53] people's faith
[1:47:57] based on
[1:47:58] what happened in the past
[1:48:03] but you've got the proof
[1:48:05] that the same works that he did you
[1:48:08] shall do also
[1:48:11] go into all the world
[1:48:13] the works that i do shall you do also
[1:48:17] you'll lay hands on the sick and then
[1:48:19] recover
[1:48:21] never was an idea of getting a group of
[1:48:24] men
[1:48:25] stick an rev
[1:48:27] in front of their name
[1:48:29] which i think stands for recreational
[1:48:31] vehicle
[1:48:37] and everybody sit back
[1:48:43] how
[1:48:44] dangerous let's just read it it's
[1:48:47] beautiful
[1:48:50] if i can't get if if i can get myself
[1:48:55] out of the way
[1:48:59] so when william branham's not even
[1:49:01] thought of
[1:49:03] and you're not even thought of
[1:49:07] till we see
[1:49:08] jesus glorified among us see
[1:49:13] him that's our desire
[1:49:17] that's
[1:49:19] quickening
[1:49:20] gives us the quickening power
[1:49:23] it gives us joy
[1:49:26] to know
[1:49:27] that we are with him
[1:49:30] both flesh and bone of him
[1:49:34] being the bride of him
[1:49:36] and seeing his same
[1:49:39] vindicated method
[1:49:42] proving in us
[1:49:44] that he's now
[1:49:46] risen
[1:49:48] from
[1:49:49] the dead
[1:49:52] the same method
[1:49:54] that vindicated him the same method that
[1:49:57] vindicated the prophet
[1:49:59] now i'm not talking about changing
[1:50:01] doctrine
[1:50:04] if any man come unto you and preach any
[1:50:06] other gospel then i preached count them
[1:50:08] a curse
[1:50:10] i'm talking about abstract
[1:50:13] evidence
[1:50:15] quickening power
[1:50:18] do you believe it
[1:50:26] or do you look backwards
[1:50:28] and look at all your faults and
[1:50:30] everything and say it it didn't come by
[1:50:34] circumcised it came by promise
[1:50:38] and when you believe it
[1:50:41] then
[1:50:42] circumcision is given to you as a token
[1:50:46] that you believe it
[1:50:48] so you believe the word he'll start
[1:50:50] circumcising all the world out of your
[1:50:53] life
[1:50:56] we just got just another couple
[1:50:58] paragraph
[1:51:00] the vindicated method
[1:51:06] being humble
[1:51:08] i do nothing lest the father shows me
[1:51:12] turning the other cheek
[1:51:15] no glory
[1:51:17] that my works might
[1:51:18] glorify the father
[1:51:21] which is in heaven
[1:51:23] i do nothing of myself
[1:51:26] meek
[1:51:28] humble
[1:51:29] little
[1:51:31] the love of god shed abroad in our heart
[1:51:34] by the holy spirit
[1:51:37] i'm telling you this attitude
[1:51:39] that we've got that we're just going to
[1:51:41] crush the world
[1:51:43] because we've got
[1:51:46] this great message
[1:51:49] no you better get ready for calvary
[1:51:52] you bet ready get for persecution
[1:51:56] that's right
[1:51:57] that's right you just need to
[1:51:59] everything's to glorify him
[1:52:02] his method no wonder he said fear not
[1:52:06] now listen
[1:52:10] this is what i want to preach tonight
[1:52:14] no wonder he said fear not
[1:52:17] for now notice
[1:52:19] we are redeemed by him
[1:52:22] and now risen with him
[1:52:25] that's what easter means to the people
[1:52:28] risen with him notice
[1:52:31] we have his spirit in us the abstract
[1:52:35] deed feel fully paid
[1:52:38] no
[1:52:39] you don't say well i hope i make it
[1:52:46] [Music]
[1:52:48] how many times have i said that and
[1:52:50] heard people say oh i just hope i make
[1:52:53] it
[1:52:53] i just hope i make it
[1:52:56] i just hope i make it
[1:53:02] don't you believe you were in him
[1:53:04] that's what he's asking you to believe
[1:53:07] he asked those disciples to believe he
[1:53:10] was the son of god
[1:53:13] and they believed it
[1:53:16] look at the thing that they were asked
[1:53:18] to believe
[1:53:19] now he's asking you to believe
[1:53:22] that you were in him when he rose
[1:53:26] and then he came
[1:53:28] to show you
[1:53:29] the quickening power by opening the
[1:53:32] seals
[1:53:34] by using the same vindicated methods
[1:53:36] that jesus used
[1:53:38] to lay everything out there
[1:53:40] just because period not for you to sit
[1:53:43] back and believe what he did
[1:53:46] but to believe what you are
[1:53:49] in him
[1:53:51] amen
[1:53:58] you know
[1:53:59] just
[1:54:01] this is the vindicated method
[1:54:05] you don't say well i hope i make it
[1:54:08] you've already made it
[1:54:15] not
[1:54:15] i will make it
[1:54:18] i've all
[1:54:20] ready
[1:54:21] made it
[1:54:25] i never made it
[1:54:27] he
[1:54:28] made it for me
[1:54:31] see
[1:54:31] not me
[1:54:33] him
[1:54:34] well brother branham they say i don't
[1:54:37] care what they say
[1:54:40] there he made it for me
[1:54:43] that's all i want i care about
[1:54:51] i just want to see him manifested
[1:54:56] how can you do it
[1:54:59] call him down
[1:55:05] church i'll just be honest with you for
[1:55:08] years
[1:55:10] it ate my heart out
[1:55:12] we'd have prayer lines
[1:55:14] and somebody would come up in the prayer
[1:55:16] line and we'd pray for him and and we'd
[1:55:20] say
[1:55:21] according to thy faith
[1:55:25] in other words
[1:55:27] you go you go
[1:55:28] get the faith
[1:55:30] if thou believe
[1:55:33] and i thought
[1:55:34] we should be able to do more than that
[1:55:39] so what were we doing
[1:55:41] we were calling him down calling him
[1:55:43] down
[1:55:45] if we keep calling him down then we're
[1:55:48] denying that he's living here
[1:55:56] we're denying he's here in our presence
[1:56:00] and
[1:56:00] this is not condemnation this is a
[1:56:03] challenge of god's word to step up into
[1:56:07] your rightful position as a christian
[1:56:11] he paid
[1:56:13] for you to be there
[1:56:15] and he gives you permission to be there
[1:56:18] and he rose from the dead to prove to
[1:56:21] you you can be there
[1:56:26] not calling them down
[1:56:30] silver and gold
[1:56:32] have i none
[1:56:34] amen
[1:56:37] but that which i have
[1:56:39] i give you
[1:56:40] where was the word of god manifested
[1:56:44] was it manifested in them
[1:56:47] or was it manifested in the crippled man
[1:56:57] because the crippled man got out and
[1:56:59] what did he do
[1:57:00] he danced and he what
[1:57:03] praised
[1:57:05] god
[1:57:06] amen
[1:57:08] no look at us
[1:57:10] no glory
[1:57:12] i can pray for you not because i'm a
[1:57:14] minister
[1:57:16] not because i'm anointed i can pray for
[1:57:18] you because jesus christ is the same
[1:57:20] yesterday today and forever
[1:57:26] i can lay my hands on you because he
[1:57:30] asked me to
[1:57:34] you are going to show
[1:57:38] that he's
[1:57:39] doing the same works he
[1:57:42] is doing the same works through me
[1:57:45] you
[1:57:46] are the manifestation that he's the same
[1:57:49] yesterday
[1:57:50] and forever when you get rid of that
[1:57:53] devil
[1:57:54] when you get rid of that sickness
[1:57:56] it's none of us doing it
[1:58:00] it's him doing it
[1:58:04] how can you do that how can you claim
[1:58:05] that
[1:58:06] because he told me
[1:58:09] go into all the world and laid my hands
[1:58:11] on the set
[1:58:14] but if your motive is to glorify him
[1:58:18] and you know that you're risen in him
[1:58:19] you're not calling them down
[1:58:22] he's here
[1:58:25] do you remember all the works that
[1:58:26] brother branham did
[1:58:28] he wasn't calling god down
[1:58:31] he said he's here
[1:58:33] i take every spirit in this building
[1:58:36] under
[1:58:37] my
[1:58:38] control
[1:58:39] for the glory
[1:58:41] of jesus christ
[1:58:46] he never claimed it he said what is what
[1:58:49] whatever he said
[1:58:50] whatever he showed me
[1:58:53] now we don't have that gift
[1:58:56] because that gift
[1:58:59] was the method
[1:59:02] of vindication
[1:59:06] now that's what he said that we
[1:59:11] would
[1:59:12] possess
[1:59:14] the method of vindication
[1:59:16] that the same works he did will do also
[1:59:19] and that was put on display it is not
[1:59:22] taking away from the divine office of
[1:59:25] the prophet it is not taking away from
[1:59:28] the jesus christ being revealed in him
[1:59:32] the deity in the flesh it is not taking
[1:59:34] away from the coming of the lord and the
[1:59:38] opening of the seals
[1:59:40] it's vindicating it
[1:59:48] do i just want to see him manifested how
[1:59:51] can i do it
[1:59:52] call him down no
[1:59:55] he is in you see
[1:59:58] he
[1:59:59] is in you
[2:00:02] well then lord if i can get myself out
[2:00:06] of the way
[2:00:07] you can manifest
[2:00:11] myself how can you do it because you
[2:00:14] ordained it so
[2:00:17] all that the father hath given me will
[2:00:20] come
[2:00:21] notice glory
[2:00:23] and we're just going to read just a few
[2:00:26] more things
[2:00:27] what with all the evidence collected
[2:00:30] with us now this morning oh i think of
[2:00:33] that song oh that resurrection morning
[2:00:36] when death cords will be broken we shall
[2:00:39] rise hallelujah we shall rise you
[2:00:42] believe that
[2:00:44] we shall rise in him we become part of
[2:00:47] him
[2:00:48] the easter
[2:00:49] the revealed secret of god like it was
[2:00:55] then
[2:00:58] life after death
[2:00:59] we are now alive
[2:01:02] who are once dead in sin and trespasses
[2:01:05] the true easter seal has broke death
[2:01:08] from around me
[2:01:09] i am alive the easter seal the beginning
[2:01:13] broke that seal of the roman seal the
[2:01:16] easter seal that broke the seal
[2:01:20] and revealed the secret
[2:01:23] now god by his holy spirit has broke the
[2:01:27] seal from around our lives and christ is
[2:01:30] revealed
[2:01:32] as he lives in us
[2:01:34] for now we are quickened with him
[2:01:40] let's just read that real close again
[2:01:43] now god by his holy spirit has broken
[2:01:46] the seals that's right
[2:01:48] the seal from around our lives
[2:01:52] he's trying to break the seal from
[2:01:54] around our lives
[2:01:56] that's been keeping
[2:02:00] and we've
[2:02:02] been keeping us
[2:02:05] from walking in
[2:02:07] and accepting the permission
[2:02:10] that he's given
[2:02:14] just think of all the doubts that are
[2:02:16] surrounding
[2:02:17] all the
[2:02:19] all the mental battle you're going
[2:02:21] through
[2:02:22] just trying to realize
[2:02:25] what it is
[2:02:27] he's trying to
[2:02:28] place in your life
[2:02:30] all the sin and
[2:02:32] things that you do and the way that
[2:02:34] satan attacks you and holds you
[2:02:37] he's trying to break that away
[2:02:41] he wants you to believe
[2:02:43] because if you believe
[2:02:45] that faith
[2:02:47] will come and drive
[2:02:49] those spirits
[2:02:51] away from you
[2:02:53] because he cleanses god works from the
[2:02:55] inside out
[2:02:57] and you're trying to work from the
[2:02:59] outside in amen
[2:03:04] now god by his holy spirit has broken
[2:03:07] the seal from around our lives
[2:03:11] right the roman seal the grave that
[2:03:14] kept him in
[2:03:16] he's trying to break the grave
[2:03:21] of
[2:03:22] that we live in
[2:03:25] to break that seal
[2:03:27] away so we can resurrect
[2:03:31] as sons and daughters of god
[2:03:34] taking our position
[2:03:36] and doing the works that are
[2:03:38] commissioned
[2:03:40] how do we do those works he
[2:03:43] he said
[2:03:45] he uses a word here i just think is
[2:03:48] is so
[2:03:49] beautiful
[2:03:51] let me see if i can find it because you
[2:03:53] are art
[2:03:54] he says not of myself meant this because
[2:03:57] you are
[2:03:59] because you ordained it so
[2:04:02] because you
[2:04:05] ordained it so
[2:04:07] well what are you to ordain what's going
[2:04:10] to drive that motivation what's going to
[2:04:12] drive the that brings the the the christ
[2:04:16] and the abstract that you are and the
[2:04:19] permission and the power that you have
[2:04:21] you know what's going to drive that love
[2:04:25] because love and faith work what
[2:04:29] hand in hand
[2:04:30] not love and religion
[2:04:33] not love and doctrine
[2:04:36] but real genuine love to glorify the
[2:04:39] lord
[2:04:45] you know i i don't want to preach a
[2:04:46] condemnation message
[2:04:48] i don't want to browbeat you till you
[2:04:50] all realize you're a bunch of sinners
[2:04:53] and you come to the altar
[2:04:55] and then we think we had a meeting
[2:05:01] that doesn't do anybody any good
[2:05:04] it's when you can sit there
[2:05:07] knowing you're sitting in a trash can
[2:05:11] knowing you're watching tv knowing
[2:05:13] you're doing this knowing you're doing
[2:05:15] that and then you can say wait a minute
[2:05:18] i can step out of this pig pan i don't
[2:05:21] have to eat this pig food i've come to
[2:05:24] my senses
[2:05:26] i'm going to go back to my father's
[2:05:28] house
[2:05:36] he knew his father had it
[2:05:40] he could testify to it he rejoiced in it
[2:05:42] he shouted in it he ran in but he never
[2:05:44] got out of the pigpen
[2:05:50] but one day
[2:05:52] he had enough of it
[2:05:57] don't do no good
[2:05:59] to come and boohoo about it
[2:06:03] don't do no good to call them down call
[2:06:05] them down
[2:06:07] you know what got him the victory
[2:06:10] that's my father
[2:06:12] and in his house
[2:06:15] and i'll go there
[2:06:17] even if i have to be a
[2:06:21] nobody
[2:06:29] oh
[2:06:32] i i i hope you feel the presence the way
[2:06:35] i feel it
[2:06:37] what a glorious love affair
[2:06:41] all he's trying to get us to do is break
[2:06:44] the seal from around our lives
[2:06:49] and christ is revealed
[2:06:52] as he lives in us
[2:06:54] for now we are quickened with him
[2:06:57] and he just goes on he says page after
[2:06:59] page
[2:07:01] after page and
[2:07:02] and uh
[2:07:04] and what a what a glorious
[2:07:08] thing
[2:07:09] it is
[2:07:10] and he says just wait the sun comes up
[2:07:13] and we'll see where we're at
[2:07:15] he is the word
[2:07:17] wait till you see
[2:07:19] the word manifested
[2:07:21] shining across the seed
[2:07:23] the wave sheath
[2:07:25] we'll see
[2:07:27] where
[2:07:28] we're at
[2:07:32] paragraph
[2:07:34] 3 31
[2:07:38] just wait the sun
[2:07:41] comes up
[2:07:42] and we'll see where we're at
[2:07:45] he is the word
[2:07:48] wait till you see the word manifested
[2:07:51] shining across the seed the wave chief
[2:07:55] you'll see where we're at
[2:07:58] do you love them
[2:08:01] what do you think is happening
[2:08:04] we're seeing where we're at
[2:08:06] we're really seeing
[2:08:09] who we are
[2:08:11] we used to say oh i know i'm something
[2:08:13] not this
[2:08:16] so we knew who we were
[2:08:19] but now we're coming to see what we are
[2:08:24] we're him
[2:08:27] back on earth
[2:08:29] or here on earth doing the same thing he
[2:08:31] did
[2:08:32] that he might be glorified
[2:08:34] and that when we leave this world
[2:08:37] jesus christ will be glorified right in
[2:08:40] the
[2:08:41] presence of all those who despise him
[2:08:45] amen don't you want to be a part of that
[2:08:48] then i lord richly bless you we just
[2:08:51] have billy lead us in a song of worship
[2:08:54] i i hope that this message that we've
[2:08:57] listened to
[2:08:58] is their inspiration and and i'm not
[2:09:01] talking about we i know there's people
[2:09:03] that are listening
