Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

let's just go ahead and stand as we turn our hearts towards the word maybe we'll just try to sing that song I've been enjoying here recently stay I believe we've seen that in the key of E flat and if you've ever been in his presence then you can identify with the song you know one of the greatest moments I I can take you to the place I can the building's been torn down now but I can go right about to the spot where I just remember one of the most intimate times where the Lord coming seemed like I was transported to another world and there was an eternal just fire presence I remember I'd been there quite a sometime they needed to lock up the church and I Heard a Voice just seemed like from a tunnel way far away and I heard it come again it's Matthew well it was my dad calling me back to Earth saying we needed to lock up and I remember in that moment I felt I almost when you come from that place I felt almost let down but I remember my brother David encouraged me and said hey he's with you you can take him wherever you go and I was like well I know that I said but that moment was precious and you know if you ever just desire that if you've never felt that kind of presence I I invite you to sincerely in your heart say you know Lord when I hear songs like that maybe maybe you can't identify with it why don't you get serious before God say you know Lord I've heard this testimony I've heard people talk about being in your presence and maybe you've felt a moving in church but when you're in a prayer closet or all alone somewhere at your bedside and the presence of God comes in there's nothing like it [Music] life [Music] in the presence of the Lord [Music] and not know what time it is [Music] foreign [Music] and I give up everything for this treasure [Music] so when I say stay want you go go my heart is burning [Music] in your presence why don't you just ask her but come by your way please [Music] cause my heart is burning in your presence [Music] brother Billy comes foreign [Music] oh Hallelujah [Music] foreign [Music] Lord Jesus I want more [Music] Jesus where else could I go where else could I go [Music] my heart is burning thank you just sing it again so stay here [Music] oh and my heart is [Music] singing One More Time [Music] oh and I want more oh Jesus ball heads gracious father foreign what a privilege to stand before the Living God father if we could only every moment be conscious and aware and of the reality of the Living God in our lives oh God [Music] The Devil Is All by it remains trying to push his reality to us father is trying to come to us by every means possible but Lord God you ain't always serve a living God you promise that I will not leave you but I'll come and even I will dwell with you even in you until the end Lord your promises are true [Music] father your promises are a reality to us Lord we're so thankful to stand before you once again Lord and after you've spoken to us this morning Lord to come and receive of you once again Lord father speak to us through your word that we may get to know who you are that we may know how to claim the promise and receive what you promised you would give us Lord we're so thankful to be gathered for this food and food Washing Service and we pray father that you just come by our way and speak to us we love you and we ask those things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen so good to be guided once again in the house of God Amen we want to welcome everyone in the house of God Amen let's open our Bibles we'll read and then we'll be seated and then we'll to continue man let's just read one scripture will be seated and then we'll read the next of the others later Jeremiah chapter 17 verse 7 and 8. it says blessed is a man that trusted that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope is the Lord is it says for he shall be like a tree planted by By the Waters and that spread it out his root by the river and shall not see when heat cometh but her Leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the years of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit let's just bow our heads up father we ask that you brace your word to us we commit everything to your hands and thank you in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you and have your seats man it's so good that we Gather in the house of God again we want to welcome everyone and certainly thankful I certainly enjoyed the word this morning hey man I was just thinking as Alberta Matthew was speaking I said you know what we need is not Mo theology what we need is the reality of God in our lives well this word has not been given to us so we could just quote it and and debate about it and and say the prophet said here and you say he said that and all of that no but one day one way or the other as Believers that reality of God's word is going to come to us we I believe this message is an entrance into the kingdom of God is is the way that God has made so we can have fellowship with him is what God has given us in this end time for us to escape the things that are around us amen I so appreciate it because there is nothing more than God above all we could do and say what we want is for the word to come in to touch your life and to actually transform you and make you a son and the daughter of God Amen we certainly appreciate that it certainly also appreciate your prayer for my son is doing better he's sitting back there he's uh he has this sometimes he gets this internal fevers and if you don't pay attention and watch him closely it kind of put him in a state of lethargic or he becomes really tired so but I believe God has given us the victory amen I believe this word is a reality amen I I could stand here and tell testimonies about that son I could say here we don't have enough time and it's even in this very Church while it was still just just few months old I just finished I believe it was brother Aaron I was preaching I just went in the back and all of a sudden my come my wife comes following after me and he has just turned purple or blue whatever you want to call it and it became unresponsive and it just stiffened up and with Brothers came out we prayed and and all of a sudden he came back again and he began to breathe so he's certainly a miracle and I believe it's I believe that you say why do you believe he's healed because God said is hell because the word said is healed I this is not some emotion this is the word of God and and we we we we gather here because we've stake our lives for this word they we don't have any other source of comfort or anything else that we rely on solely God's word so it's we take God's words until we are taken to the Grave it's nothing else but the word of God and we believe because you promise when we believe when we come and believe he's the one who has to make his Worth to come to the past I I thought about this quote I'll just read it before we move on this is in the greatest battle I ever fought Brothers if you could put it up and paragraph 340 I want you to listen to this it says now now watch now it says I just got a hurry he said um it says I got I got I I I got to get this in it says Satan's Army brings distress and I thought even the exhortation of what Mike was bringing this morning and I thought this devil is just he just doesn't know who he's dealing with this is not the the people that would go up in fear this is the children of God this is the people of God so he said Satan's Army brings diseases he says That's what Satan is he's a destroyer Satan the whole Kingdom of Satan is sickness death and sorrow and frustration and worries all on Satan think about that and then he says God is life Faith joy peace over here see it says now now that's that's the two great forces that's coming together right now they are battling now listen to this they are battling right here in this building right now so you you tell me we are gathered in the house of God to hear the word of God but Satan is also here trying to inject his fear his sicknesses his frustration he's trying to do it right here right now and then he says they they they battle day by day with you every force it says Satan following you along that great big it says uh kingly priest Goliath trying to scare the liver out of you yeah yeah it says he's here right but God it says you are fortified you are fortified a man with the gospel with a word of Truth around your loins Glory preaching it says it says that's it says that's what it is helmet of salvation The Shield of Faith the sword waving in in your hand Satan is coming to meet you you meet him in the you you meet him in the name of in it you meet me in the name of science you meet me in the name of culture you meet me in the name of organization you meet me in the in in the name of this of that or the other but I meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel I'm coming after you give way even death itself can't stand there we've been given a name would not be given to give to give in to the spirit of fear but we've been given a name that we can stand in so I I certainly say let's be comforted by the word of God and he continues only says I'm coming after you give way even death is self-concerned chop the hole right through it that's right he said sitting on me Satan's Army brings diseases God's Army is commissioned to cast them out amen there you are every time Satan throws any on on unto you God's Army is to cast him out amen cast out it says that's the very technique that God uses so if God uses it his children will use it he said Satan uses the army of Destruction the the so this this believes God's word and they set him up in the uh at the better Kingdom than Michael and God cast him out he says God's method is cast out the devil cast down reasoning cast down Superstition cast down worry cast down diseases cast down sin amen you are above it I didn't put myself above it the word puts me above it it says Resurrection resurrect resurrected in Jesus Christ sitting in Heavenly places everything it says with every devil under your foot that's the place for the devil all you got to do is remind them you are under my feet amen it says and if it starts with sickness if it starts sticking out his head in there and then he talks about just go ahead and you just go on and just trample on him make sure you don't give him a room amen you certainly enjoy the word this morning and and I was kind of conflicted because I know Ezra Matthews said you know this service I'll say you know you we got what we we needed I didn't want to be too long and no just try to be um I'll just start to be as concise as possible I'll be looking at the clock and now if I feel like it's time I'll just stop so please don't ask me to continue because I have enough to preach two three services so so I know the last time we preached this we didn't get a chance to finish uh you know uh I'm beginning to have a preacher's symptom that I just can't get to finish up what I'm starting so we we preached on the bridegroom restoring his own bride and as we write the scripture uh we write the scripture in Joel the scripture says that our uh Joel chapter 2 and verse 25 he says and I will restore unto you the years that the locusts had eaten the conquer worm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I have sent unto you now but when I'm says in the message I will restore it says Thou that's the same insect it's the same insect just in different stages and then he says ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God and Eddie had dwelt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and then we also read in Psalm chapter one it says it says blessed is a man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly knows standeth in the way of Sinners no sitteth in the seat of of of the scornful but it's the light is in the law of the Lord and is and and in his law uh does he meditate day and night he said and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water and bringeth forth its fruit in his season in these leaves shall not weather and he says whatsoever he would he doeth shall prosper the ungodly is not so but I like the shaft which the wind drivens away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in judgment nor the sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish so as we read that I I just want to reiterate something so just go a little faster and and and remind us this I even enjoy just what Matthew just bringing that out this morning brother Matthew's story is the story of restoration as we see here every one of us you know depending on how God brought you in you may have not perhaps gone to the extent that as well brother Matthew uh said it's gone too and you've never been put in handcuffed I never been put in handcuffed and everything but I realized still that I was a sinner I needed to be saved I never smoked marijuana or drug but but I even though in that state I have done things that were unpleasing to God that I needed to be saved so every one of us that seats that sits here it's very important you realize that your story is a story of restoration and the prophet is telling us it says the the hit when he speaks about this restoration is not a partial restoration is the full restoration and the reason you say why are you saying that because we we don't want to come through the house of God and feel like what we're receiving there is something missing that oh I hear the word but yet there's something missing that I gotta go add so that it can really produce what God has said no this is the the full restoration the word that we have received in the end time is here to produce what God wants it to produce if it's by receiving the word of God that we receive what we have need of the the word of God is a full word and I will even go as far as saying for the ages as the word was being allocated uh whatever portion was given to them it was it was enough to do the job for that time in other words they couldn't come and say well oh God gave us just this but we need something else no don't ever letter because the moment you do that you allow the devil to come in and play with your mind that you need something more than the word that you need more than what God has provided you that you need to do something else and you need to to go out outside of the provision that is given for you to receive what you want to what you need no I'm here to say the word of God is giving us all that we have made of and it's the full restoration and the prophet will tell this this he says that the end time message messenger is to tie up all the loose hand that was left in other words he's doing the full job of what he was given to do and I will say this so without the messenger or the message of malachite 4 there is no restoration you you couldn't there's no church under the Earth today that could talk about restoration if they didn't receive the message of Malachi 4 because God sent this word by a prophet God sends his word to a people and those people have to receive I like again I'll go back to what brother Mike said the work of God is to receive whom God has sent and when you've recognized whom God has sent and the message that they bring into you then you have received the plan of God and so as I'm saying it's a message of restoration to bring us back so either and it's the restoration to bring us back and it's a restoration of the word will bring forth the restoration of the faith and Faith only comes by the word of God and only after the word is being restored then faith can be restored so the end time restoration is to restore the very Harmony that existed between the father and the son when we can talk about Adam and we can talk about God how that says that when you sin that that the veil came and he says that God said they separated from God they lost that Fellowship that they had with God in the beginning this message is here to restore that Fellowship is to come back and take you and restore your fellowship with God so you can have this Oneness with him it didn't come so we can have preachers preaching to you telling you every day what should uh what you should do how you should dress and who what you should do and not doing everything no this message has come so when you hear it the fellowship that you as an individual need to have what God himself is restored and and and so that which was lost in the Garden of Eden God is sending it now in the end time to restore that in that perfect condition and so so I want to say the prophet said this is I I didn't capture what message it was he says notice it says notice it says in the Pentecostal age through the looters age through the Wesley age it's been the same thing through this Pentecostal age now he's talking he says but now notice but at the opening of the seals Revelation 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again now there's two things I want to point out here he's talking about the full word being born into manifestation but the other I want to bring to our attention because I was just reading this and he just captured me it hit me like he never hit me before now I want you to realize it says but at the opening of the seal now there is often but one of them will say oh but since the seal has been opened by the opening of the seal then I begin to look this is the prophet is warning us to pay specific attention to this event what is it that it means by the opening of the seal in other words what is it that means to you as you sit here or he says well but since the opening of the sealed now what does that mean to you when you hear it because it's very important understand that the prophet himself will say that I have been sent they said as John was sent to prepare the first coming it says but so my message will prepare the second coming and he told me that was my job that was my commission that's what I was to do and to come in to prepare everyone will come and he will preach to people and and they will come and he was given this pull the first and the second for the attraction of the people but here he is now he's saying but but at the opening of the seals so now he's wanting you to pay attention that there's been an introduction of something else that's been happening it's no longer him coming just as preparers of the message of the word of God or the coming of the Lord but it's now letting you know that now something else has been happening since the opening of the seal now it's no longer me just here as the one who will prepare his second coming but yet now the word itself is here Christ is here he's trying to make himself known unto you it's no longer me speaking to you but it's the word Christ himself speaking to you because if we don't catch that transition we'll miss what the message is all about that's why you'll come and say who's this Melchizedek he says there's a man here who can turn on the light why could he say that because the seals have been hoping why because the one who could turn on the light was there to turn on the light it's no longer just an introduction from the messenger introducing the message saying oh I'm here to send to prepare the hearts and to do all those things but now he's bringing you to the attention there is actually somebody here who can turn on the light and don't miss that transition because if you miss it you'll be looking at the prophet all the time but if you catch the transition you'll be able to look at the word and say the word is here Christ is here himself and it's a word revealing himself to his bride so he can turkey up from this planet and that's very important because this word has taken a turn to something that people didn't even expect so he says that the full word is to be born into manifestation and the vanity and Vindicated by the spirit of God in full strength as it was when he was here on Earth so he's saying the Vindication of his presence in the end time is to be exactly the same as when he was here on Earth by himself so his presence is always known why because he does the same thing every time manifested in the same way doing the same thing that he did when he was here on Earth amen Hebrews 39 says Jesus Christ Jesus Christ the same the the same yesterday today and forever he says in sin sent Luke 17 and 30 he says he says in the last day as it was in the days of Sodom when the son of man when this uh when the son of man will be revealed himself again it says it will do the same thing the world has gone in the Sodom condition and the church has went in in Sodom with it it says like Lord and his wife and I say that there is an elect church somewhere in this world that that will that that's pulled out and set aside from those things and the manifestation of God has attracted its intention we are in the last day what is attracted that attention and and I'll say this the those that were attracted in the First full they just came for the for for the healing those who are attracted in the second pool they were only attracted because he could tell them what they were thinking and they would saw all those things and everything but the attraction of the third pool it's not just the sign and wonders it's not just the the calling forth of what you're thinking but it's the revealing of the word that's tracking that attracted your attention it's God himself making himself known in his word that's what has attracted your attention in this end time so therefore even as we said where he said we said so the end time manifestation is only here to attract a specific group of people it's not for everybody there were those that were attracted in the first bowl that was many in the second poll there was a lot but in the third poll it was only a few bits that were attracted even as the prophet will talk about how that he said we have to say things in the way to drive others to go why because they came for those that came for the love and fish that received what they wanted and they went away you know God is not someone that we just go when we are sick I said oh God then I need you and you need something other than a God then I need you and you every time you ever need no God wants us to give ourselves to him whether sick or not and and whether we are well or not regardless of what condition we are in in fact I'm also as we have health in our being as we have a voice to say this being was created to be the manifestation of God it was not created for that Jesus go use your body for a job and get let's pay and and rejoice over that and continue to do that no God give you this being so you can use it for his kingdom he gave it to you so you can use your mouth to speak his word he your hands so you can touch people and make them wild to his hands so you can do the works that he wants you to do if we can only understand that and catch that Revelation it's him manifesting himself in his people now we just read the scripture as we read in Psalm 1 and I just want to read it from the amplify and I thought it was it's just been such a blessing I've read it just uh so many days and have just been meditating on it and I feel like I just haven't really comprehend the whole of what he talks what he's talking about here and I want to say that it says I think I said it last time the the when you read this I want you to realize this is God's desire for you to be this is God that when he created you to be here on Earth this is the job that he created you to do he wanted you to be like this tree he wanted you to be settled to be like to have the qualification or or the attribute that you this tree has from the amplifier it will go like this he said blessed all happy and fortunate and prosperous and enviable I thought that was just enviable a Christian has to meet someone that's enviable not you envying the world but the world looks in at you and envying you for what you are the peace that you have the calmness that you have the way about uh to doing things that you have not one that will blow his casket and get mad and throw everything out no but one that just has a nature that's attractive it says enviable is a man who walketh not who who walketh and liveth not in the Council of on the ungodly in other words who follows their advice their plans and the then the and the purposes it says nor uh submit submissive and uh inactive in the part where Sinners walk walk nor sittle down or to relax or to rest now I want you to see this qualification that this scripture is giving so you don't want to be submersible inactive in standing in the things of the world you don't want to be one that relaxes or rest uh sits down where the scornful said or you want to you don't want to be gathered with the markers that will sit down and and talk and Mark and and wonder oh God made a promise but I don't see it come to pass what is it of it and all those things but he said but he shall be like a tree that's firmly planted and tendered by the stream of waters it says ready to bring forth its fruits in a season its leaves shall not fade or wither and everything that it do it does shall prosper Us in other words and come to maturity and come to maturity now it says uh not not so with the wicked those disobedient and living without God uh are not so but they are like the shaft it says worthless dead without substance which the wind that drive us away I I I got it's important you realize that there's many people here on Earth that are like wind they are dead they just yes they are on the face of the Earth and you come across them every day and and you wrap shoulders with them but yet they are lack of wind they have no there's no purpose about what they do they they are dead they are separated from God and you don't want to follow after that example it says it says it says therefore the wicked those disobedient living without God shall not stand justified in judgment no seated in the uh in the congregation of the righteous those who are upright and in and and and in right standing with God for the Lord and is fully acquainted for the Lord knows and be fully acquainted with the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly those living outside of of God's will Shall Perish you know it's important to realize it all you have to do is bring a sinner in the congregation of the Saints there would either be converted or changed or they will run out they won't be able to stand it why because the presence of God will come and it will cause about that decision to be made it will cause a change to be made it's either you come in or you go out but one will not be able to stand so therefore as we look at the characteristics of this tree that's what Ram will say it's a tree that's planted by the water and it's got its all nine gifts of spirits and and nine gifts of one Spirit hanging all over it and it's there and it says it's leaves it's there for the to create a shadow on the people under which people can come and and extends their its fruit is for the people to enjoy it and all those things and I'm not saying this it's you that I'm talking about it's you you you have to find yourself and say tonight that if God made me to be like that tree because I believe sometimes the mistake we made is when we read something like this we say oh god um I I am what I am but I want you to make me this I I want if you can tonight at least try to change your language in saying that in in other uh uh instead of saying God this is what I want to be but you say that God this is what you made me to be because because we cannot be something that we are not if you recognize this as what you are this is what you will stay in but if you recognize the word as what you are this is what you walk in so when we look at the promises and the word of God there has to be something within us say that this is what I'm meant to be this is what I was created to be and walk in it I was looking and I came across this and I I hope it will be a blessing for you and I just asked myself even in the natural what what is just what is the purpose of a tree just look around and you see them everywhere just what what what benefit do they serve are they just blending like flowers so they can look good and and you know and just stand around and and lose those two do those things and and I came across this and I thought it was so beautiful it's just a few things that I could just Court out quickly so we can move on it says the tree combats greenhouse effect a tree cleans the air a tree provide oxygen so you can think about when they talk about greenhouses I believe it's said to be an effect where the Sun or the heat get uh uh trapped close to the earth and the tree has the ability to absorb those things it clears the air and it provides oxygen you can think about all of the emissions and everything all the cars everything that we're generating you realize that it's toxic so the tree will absorb all of that and produce oxygen so you can breathe now I'm talking about a believer I'm not talking about a tree a tree cools the streets down and the cities and I thought that's why we have so much hit in Texas is because we don't have a lot of trees but you go to a places like Carolinas and the others there's just the the size of the trees and you know you you go back in Africa there's trees that are over a thousand years old that will stand there you're like nobody Waters this street how come it's leaving why because it's planted it has water underneath that it could breathe that it could take it that tree is there for the survival of the civilization that tree is there to provide life to a people so he would say the tree it the tree conserves energy a tree saves water a tree helps prevent water pollution a tree it helps Prevail uh prevent the soil erosion so if you have trees and it's on the ground that ground is protected because there's a tree I thought isn't that what the prophet told us he said the only reason God has not destroyed this Earth is because you are here the only reason why this world has not gone into a complete chaos and the fire burned by fire is because the bride is still here so it's important you realize that I'm here for more than just my job I'm here for more than just feeding my family I'm here as God's ecosystem keeping the things that around me alive because if we fail to see that we just we look at our lives so many times as just a worthless thing so I gotta get to you know I got to go to work and I got to do this if you look at it just on the surface like that you don't see any meaning you don't see any production but if you can understand what you are placed here on Earth Therefore your job has more meaning the people that you know it means more because you know you've been placed there to just give them the right words and the right time the scripture says in Galatians 5 and 22 it says but the fruits of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law it says and they they that are in they that are Christ they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the with the F with the affections and the lust it says and if we live in the spirit let us walk in the spirit it says let us not be desirious of vain Glory provoking one another envy and other and and and envying one another so now and I can say this if there's one thing we need to provoke one another to is to provoke one another to the word to the achievement of God to the things that God has promised to do in this generation to bring us into the fold in the realization of what God is doing to bring us to a place where we can realize I have been blessed here in order to play God's purpose in fact you are part of the restoration of God we but right as you mentioned this this morning restoration is to bring back to its owner restoration foreign to restore and claim can be acclaimed can be made to enforce now let's bring it it says now to bring it anything back to its rightful owner it says where they had the where it belonged to they therefore some way it went away from its rightful owner and and can wander around anywhere but to restore is to bring it back to who really owned it or to bring it back to it naturally state where it was in the first place to bring it back uh into the natural condition in order to do that we have to have the right to enforcement we have to have the right enforcement and what does that tell you you know this ride is not just some girls that's been gotten somewhere in some streets everywhere she was in the mind of God in the beginning that's why she could be restored she was too she she had to be with God in the beginning in order to be restored so when we talk about this restoration it's not just something happening where we were born in Saint Shepherd iniquity but yet we are making a claim to something that doesn't belong to us but yet the prophet is saying that he's bringing you right back because the way you came You Came the way of sin but God's intention is to bring you the right way is to bring you in the right way for you to manifest the things that he promised or that he wanted you to manifest but what I'm going to say this in Christ The Mystery of God revealed it says and then the word moves on down into the body now but as a to preface this or before I say this I read it again you can put it up there it's paragraph Christ the ministry of God revealed paragraph 595. we know the prophet has told us that we've come from the bosom of God we we in fact it says as he was so are we we are born of his born flesh of his flesh attribute of his attribute all of those things so I want you to remember that and and now hear what he's saying here and the word moves on down into the body from the head what is it the same word nothing can be added or taken from it now we say that a lot but let me if I if you allow me just this nothing can be added or taken in other words the same power that he had when he was in the head the same things that he could do when he was in the head the same attribute the same when it was in Jesus which is the head the same word that was in Christ the same word that that spoke and raised the dead and the same word that came and made creation it says that same word is moving into the body and he says now he's saying that you can't take anything away from it you can't add to it so because oftentimes when we say that we mean explanation but no I'm talking about the power of it the attribute of it the effects of it its ability to change its ability to transform don't take it away don't add anything to it it says it comes down it says nothing can be had or taken away from it so that same word moves from the head which Christ it says as the day came Come Close comes close down into the body it says down into the body vindicating that they are one what is that invisible Union the word itself like I said at the opening of the seal something happened but that word is now coming it's not just oh I saw that was the picture of of of Christ being taken up there now we're saying no the word the full word that was revealed that word that was Christ is now moving into the body to unite it says they are one vindicating that they are one it says they are husband and wife they are flesh of his flesh word of his word life of his life Spirit of his spirit amen he says how do you know it he Bears it says Bears the same record same fruit same word you see manifests manifests Christ's same life it says same God Same Spirit same word same book amen same sign things that I do ye shall do also so let me say this we we cannot do the works of Christ by ourselves and and no one can manifest the nature of Christ unless Christ himself is in him no one can do the works of Christ unless Christ is in him so it so when we say it's the word I want us to understand that it does the same exact thing that he did when he was required it's God he's now taking as a promise The God Who was above us the God who was with us that same God will be in us so now the prophet is saying in Christ The Mystery of God revealed that word is as we speak right now moving into the body oh I say word of God move on me word of God come change my life word of God come take this to fall a man who who makes mistakes who fails and who does things he doesn't want to do come move in me come causing me about the change so I can produce what you want me to do so I can produce what you expect for me to produce why because it's the same life that's moving that's what we want we don't want some explanation of understanding but we want to understand when the when he says at the opening of the seals we want to understand now the word is moving into the body it's no longer some men speaking to you but it's the bride himself the bridegroom himself speaking to his bride but when I'm says Whispering sacred in your ears what is he telling you it's time to go it's going home time let's all stand I don't want to go too long I want to make sure we can have our communion amen amen I believe that's what we can have communion with we have in communion with him because he has come down is reveal his word to us so we can come and have communion with him amen amen if the brothers could go and get a communion we'll just open our Bible in First Corinthians chapter 11. amen foreign man I saw from the 23rd it says for I have received of the Lord that which I also have delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he breaked it he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do it in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood do this ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat and eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till it comes it says whatsoever wherefore whatsoever shall eat and shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworldly shall be guilty of the blood the body and the blood of the Lord but let every man examine himself so let him eat of the bread of that bread and drink of that cup for ye thy eateth and drinketh unworldly eat it and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasing of the Lord that we should not condemn that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my bread and when we come when he come together to eat Terry one for another it says and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I said in order when I come let's just pray over the bread and all the wine our gracious father we so thankful father that you've given us the revelation of what we're about to do now Lord God this bread represented your bra your body father your the bread of life the bread that come down from heaven you said on that day you said I am the bread that

father that you may just let it come and your Prophet will tell us that there's healing in communion your Prophet will say tell us that it's Deliverance in communion Lord we don't come to be condemned we don't come to be chastened but we come further that we may be edified that we may receive the benefit of this oh God and I pray that if it be anything Lord that you may forgive us we confess our wrong to you and father before we can take it so that you can come and cleanse us you said that if we confess our wrong to you that you are just and faithful to forgive us we pray that you may just bless this bread as we take it that it may just come and father fill us with yourself bless the swine o God and Lord they even the scripture will say there's a stimulation of Revelation it says touch not the oil and the wine father this is what we need in order for the Life to Come O God and to come and take that which we have eaten and make it life oh God we pray father that even as we take it

having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end and supper being ended and the devil having put in the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon sent to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given him and given all things into his hand and that it was come from God and went to God he raised it from the supper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel and girded himself and after he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and wipe them with with a towel which he was which he was scared then coming to Simon Peter Simon Simon Peter and Simon to Simon Peter and and Peter said unto him Lord thou wash my fate Jesus answered and said unto him what I do without know it not now but Thou shalt no way Hereafter and Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou has no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not only my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said unto him he that was he that he that is washed needeth not safe to wash his feet but he's cleaned every weight for ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken the Garment and was set down again and said unto them ye know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and ye say well for so I am and if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should follow you should do as I have done unto you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than him thus send him if you know these things happy I.E when you do them amen the sisters can go to the place and the brothers will meet
