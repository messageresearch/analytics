[41:27] his wonderful grace amen
[41:30] hallelujah he's listening to
[41:33] our pastor preach this morning and just
[41:36] something
[41:37] in the heart of the believer that says
[41:38] i've been ordained
[41:40] for this time for such a place and a
[41:43] time as this
[41:44] to stand in the face of opposition and
[41:47] declare truth amen
[41:50] amen i just i won't be long i just trust
[41:52] that
[41:53] the lord will be our portion and help us
[41:56] to deliver a little burden that we have
[41:58] on our heart and
[42:00] and if you turn with me into your uh
[42:02] bibles
[42:03] we're going to read a little scripture
[42:05] in hebrews
[42:06] chapter 2 and something that's just on
[42:09] my heart you know
[42:10] god's given us his best amen and
[42:13] when he's given us his best would never
[42:15] want to put it as second fiddle in our
[42:17] lives we never want to put it in the
[42:19] back seat of our lives but we want to
[42:21] keep it right in front and center
[42:23] because it's everything to us amen it's
[42:25] it's so precious it's so valuable
[42:28] god's word is himself in us amen
[42:31] and so we're just we just want to hold
[42:33] the torch light
[42:35] to a lost and dying world knowing that
[42:37] he's called us to this stand amen
[42:40] amen hebrews chapter 2 and verse 1 it
[42:42] says therefore we ought to give
[42:45] the more earnest heed to the things
[42:47] which we have heard
[42:49] lest at any time they sh we should let
[42:52] them slip
[42:54] for if the word spoken by angels was
[42:56] steadfast
[42:57] and every transgression and disobedient
[43:00] received
[43:01] a just recompense of reward how shall we
[43:04] escape if we
[43:05] neglect so greater salvation which
[43:08] at the first began to be spoken by the
[43:11] lord
[43:12] and was confirmed unto us by them that
[43:14] heard him
[43:16] god also bearing them witness both with
[43:18] signs and wonders
[43:19] and diverse miracles in the gifts of the
[43:23] holy ghost
[43:24] according to his own will for unto the
[43:26] angels
[43:28] hath he not put in subjection the world
[43:30] to come
[43:32] whereof we speak but one
[43:35] in a certain place testified saying what
[43:38] is a man
[43:39] that thou art mindful of him or the son
[43:43] of man
[43:43] that thou visiteth him thou
[43:47] madest him a little lower than the
[43:49] angels
[43:50] thou crowned him with the glory and
[43:52] honor
[43:53] and did set him over the works of thy
[43:55] hand
[43:56] thou has put all things in subjection
[43:59] under his feet
[44:00] for in that he had put all things
[44:02] subject under him
[44:04] he left nothing that is not
[44:08] under him but now we see
[44:11] not yet all things under him but we see
[44:14] jesus
[44:16] who is made a little lower than the
[44:18] angels
[44:19] for the suffering of death crowned with
[44:21] glory and honor
[44:23] that he by the grace of god should taste
[44:25] death
[44:26] for every man amen you may have your
[44:28] seeds
[44:29] amen such a wonderful scripture it
[44:31] empowers the believer you know i was
[44:34] talking with the brother this week and
[44:36] he called me and
[44:38] uh you know there's something in my mind
[44:40] that said you know do you want the good
[44:41] news or the bad news and that's kind of
[44:43] the devil's approach to
[44:45] to us as believers he said well you i'm
[44:47] going to give you some bad news but
[44:49] praise be to god this is the good news
[44:51] amen
[44:52] we're not a defeated people amen god
[44:55] died the death so that you and i
[44:57] don't have to fear death amen and when
[45:00] we look and to see that he was made a
[45:02] little lower than angels and he
[45:04] suffered in the flesh amen the scripture
[45:07] says that
[45:09] in verse 10 for it will become him
[45:12] for whom all things and by him all
[45:14] things
[45:15] are all things in bringing many sons
[45:18] unto glory
[45:19] to make the captain of our salvation
[45:23] perfect through suffering amen god has
[45:26] left a little measure of suffering for
[45:27] each one of us amen he said that
[45:29] character is the only thing we're going
[45:31] to take with
[45:31] us amen and so it's it's god's choosing
[45:35] to allow us to go through some struggles
[45:37] some sufferings
[45:38] because it's without those struggles and
[45:40] it's without that suffering
[45:42] that we cannot have character amen we
[45:45] must have character
[45:46] and character stays with the word amen
[45:49] amen i was thinking about um you know
[45:52] the prophet of god teaching a
[45:53] a subject out of uh
[45:57] then jesus came and called and i was so
[45:59] moved by it i thought
[46:02] if the lord permit me i just share a
[46:05] little bit out of that message and
[46:08] just thinking about how there's
[46:11] there's never such a time in
[46:15] as as believers to to not
[46:18] to not point others to the cross of
[46:20] calvary we
[46:21] must be pointing souls to calvary
[46:23] because you know
[46:26] if i would say it like this um you know
[46:29] any time the enemy tries to present well
[46:31] you know we're gonna have to have a
[46:32] layoff
[46:33] you know and and you're on the list well
[46:35] that might seem like that scenario the
[46:37] the good news bad news scenario
[46:39] and that's just the way the enemy tries
[46:41] to always approach us to get us to have
[46:43] the wrong
[46:44] attitude towards the word of god amen
[46:46] and so we want to definitely be
[46:48] on guard for his attacks and and we want
[46:50] to be on guard for his tricks
[46:52] knowing that his he's always trying to
[46:55] give us these kind of scenarios
[46:57] and and so i got to thinking about it
[46:59] and i said you know
[47:02] really as a believer we got good news
[47:04] amen he said he'd work it all together
[47:06] for good so
[47:08] when the enemy comes in and he starts
[47:09] saying well we got this report and it's
[47:11] an incurable disease well i say
[47:13] well you might be presenting it in the
[47:16] form of a bad news but i got news for
[47:18] you buddy
[47:19] i got isaiah 53 amen by his stripes i am
[47:22] healed hallelujah so
[47:24] whatever he comes bringing in the battle
[47:26] of the mind
[47:28] it's good news amen i always want to
[47:30] find my voice speaking the word amen so
[47:33] if that's a little thought that we just
[47:34] want to kind of share with you is
[47:36] is finding our voice you we're living in
[47:39] a dark time and in a dark
[47:40] hour where there's gross darkness on the
[47:43] people
[47:44] and people they're picking up all kinds
[47:46] of causes and they're expressing a lot
[47:48] of things
[47:49] and yet we have free moral agency every
[47:52] man has the right to his opinion amen
[47:54] but
[47:54] there's a predestinated people and elect
[47:57] people that will say thus saith the lord
[47:59] amen
[48:00] and it's the same voice and so we want
[48:02] to find our voice speaking
[48:04] the same thing he spoke amen
[48:08] amen so this uh message brother branham
[48:11] talked about
[48:12] and and we'll just turn into scripture
[48:14] gives kind of a little bit of a backdrop
[48:16] in john chapter 11.
[48:20] in john chapter 11
[48:24] speaking about mary and martha
[48:28] when lazarus you know jesus was
[48:33] told by the father to go take a journey
[48:35] to to get out of the house and to go on
[48:38] and
[48:39] martha was there and you know it's it's
[48:42] um
[48:42] it's like it is today for us as
[48:44] believers their situations and
[48:46] circumstance that you prayed for
[48:48] and you're believing for and you know it
[48:51] just seems dark
[48:52] you know and we've been taught that just
[48:54] because there's rain clouds on the
[48:56] outside and it's storming and
[48:58] there's difficulty in life doesn't mean
[49:00] that god's against you amen
[49:02] and just because things are going well
[49:04] and there's plenty of money in the bank
[49:06] and
[49:06] there's no uh problems with health
[49:08] doesn't mean god's for you amen
[49:10] but when god can speak and amen we can
[49:13] receive the word of god in our heart and
[49:15] say amen
[49:16] that's the way it is in my life amen let
[49:18] it be
[49:19] amen then we can know where we're
[49:21] standing is a sure foundation
[49:23] amen so mark that came to that place
[49:28] in john chapter
[49:32] 11 says this in verse 1 now a certain
[49:35] man was sick named lazarus of bethany
[49:38] the town of mary
[49:39] and his sister martha
[49:43] and it was that mary would anoint the
[49:45] lord with ointment
[49:47] and wipe her feet with her hair whose
[49:49] brother
[49:50] lazarus was sick
[49:53] therefore her sisters went to him saying
[49:56] lord
[49:57] behold he whom thou
[50:00] lovest is sick amen
[50:04] when jesus heard this he said this
[50:07] sickness is not unto death
[50:11] but for the glory of god that the son of
[50:14] god
[50:14] might be glorified thereby thereby
[50:18] now jesus loved martha and her sister in
[50:20] lazarus
[50:21] and he had heard therefore that he was
[50:24] sick
[50:25] and about two days still in the same
[50:27] place where he was
[50:28] and after that saith he his disciples
[50:32] let us go into judea again amen
[50:35] and i'll pick up in this um
[50:40] then jesus came and called this is
[50:43] preached in 1964
[50:46] um april 17th and
[50:49] [Music]
[50:50] paragraph 50.
[50:55] he says now death struck the little home
[51:00] they had sent for him what a broke up
[51:03] home that was
[51:04] the man that they had confidence in the
[51:07] man that they
[51:08] had loved the man that they had seen
[51:10] heal the sick
[51:11] the man and made the blind to see
[51:15] in prophecy to know the thoughts of the
[51:18] heart
[51:19] and to tell the people what happened
[51:22] every time he fit the scripture
[51:25] to the dot exactly so much till they
[51:29] the most loyalist friends and
[51:32] he let that happen see
[51:35] he let that happen just to see what they
[51:38] would do
[51:40] amen you think about this story and you
[51:43] think about your life
[51:44] and you think about the things that you
[51:45] have on your heart the faith
[51:47] in god's word and yet there's times like
[51:50] this with
[51:51] mary god would allow
[51:54] something to transpire
[51:58] and it's an opportunity
[52:02] to keep the right spirit the right
[52:05] attitude towards god's word amen
[52:07] and no doubt that was what was in the
[52:10] father's mind about it
[52:14] all hopes was gone the man they trusted
[52:17] in
[52:18] and they was turned out and he wasn't
[52:22] what they thought he was and and they
[52:24] were so
[52:25] desperate lazarus their brother was dead
[52:28] amen and you know martha mary
[52:32] and lazarus they had they had turned
[52:34] their back to the denominations they
[52:36] turned their back to the world they were
[52:38] completely sold out amen
[52:41] it sounds familiar in my house amen
[52:44] there's times where
[52:45] i ain't got no other options amen and
[52:48] god he's just saying no doubt
[52:51] that that was what the father had in
[52:53] mind
[52:54] to just leave them stand there
[52:57] as if he wasn't gonna answer amen
[53:01] but the scripture says there
[53:07] in verse 4 he said this sickness
[53:10] is not unto death but for the glory of
[53:13] god
[53:14] that the son of god might be glorified
[53:17] thereby amen
[53:18] there is a representation of
[53:22] heaven here on earth today amen
[53:26] and we're just thinking about how that
[53:27] god would allow
[53:29] even in the darkest hour in the darkest
[53:32] time when
[53:33] no hope it appeared was around
[53:38] and yet then his presence
[53:42] comes and brings new hope amen how many
[53:45] can testify that they've experienced his
[53:47] presence
[53:48] and it brought new hope amen i think
[53:50] that's what the call is in this day
[53:53] as i've heard the testimony that
[53:57] the figurehead the popes made and said
[54:00] that
[54:01] he believed that jesus failed when he
[54:04] died
[54:05] but what he failed to realize is that he
[54:07] rose from the dead amen and
[54:10] what he died for was to redeem me and
[54:13] you
[54:13] amen to deliver us from the bondage of
[54:16] sin
[54:17] amen that's the good news amen
[54:23] there is a promise of a resurrection
[54:26] and to think that he's also
[54:29] he's he's told his
[54:33] audience he said now you just don't go
[54:37] out there and try to convert nobody
[54:40] don't go out there and tell them what
[54:42] you believe
[54:44] don't try to win souls to jesus christ
[54:48] don't try to
[54:49] convert nobody we'll do all that
[54:53] you see that spirit at work those two
[54:57] spirits balaamism and
[54:59] nicolaitanism still at work amen but
[55:02] there's a people that is taking up the
[55:04] voice of the word
[55:05] the resurrection is now inhabiting a
[55:08] multi-member predestinated bride
[55:11] hallelujah
[55:13] not just gonna sit still at the
[55:16] commandment
[55:17] of the pope or a king or anybody other
[55:20] than king jesus
[55:22] amen
[55:27] thinking about this statement it just
[55:29] was so profound to me
[55:32] that oh my just got me to
[55:35] jumping i just thought about it and
[55:38] and we know it's true and martha
[55:42] in verse 78 now martha knowing
[55:46] speaking about the elijah and the
[55:48] shooter might woman
[55:49] you know she came to a dark hour but you
[55:52] know there's something
[55:53] that a believer does when you come to
[55:55] christ is you
[55:57] you you make your vow you say you know i
[55:59] believe that jesus
[56:00] died for me and all of what i
[56:02] represented all that i was now i'm
[56:05] i'm laying it at the altar and i'm
[56:08] trusting that
[56:09] the life of christ now can rise up in me
[56:12] and i can satisfy his
[56:14] word i can do his will amen and there's
[56:17] a vow that's made you say
[56:19] lord if you take the burden of sin if
[56:21] you take the bondage of sin
[56:22] from me and you make me a new creature
[56:25] in christ i'll serve you with all of my
[56:27] heart amen
[56:28] i'll give you my all i won't make no
[56:31] excuses or arguments
[56:33] to serve your word amen
[56:36] and to think about that the shooter
[56:38] might woman she wanted to do something
[56:40] for the lord amen there's something that
[56:43] that resonates in a believer's heart
[56:45] that says i want to do something for the
[56:47] lord amen
[56:48] no matter how dark it is no matter how
[56:50] chaotic it is
[56:51] no matter who's running for the
[56:54] president no matter
[56:55] what causes my neighbors taking up and
[56:58] what banners they fly amen
[57:00] but there's a love in my heart that says
[57:02] i want to serve the gospel
[57:04] amen i don't want it just to be the
[57:06] preacher or the pastor the deacons or
[57:09] the trustees or
[57:10] the song leaders or the musicians oh god
[57:13] what would you have
[57:14] me to do if it's just to whistle i
[57:16] certainly appreciate the
[57:18] the the prophet and brother david
[57:21] pointing that out last weekend i just
[57:23] thought oh my that that fits me if i
[57:26] could just
[57:27] if nothing else i'll just whistle him or
[57:29] something for the glory of god amen
[57:32] you got a part to play glory
[57:36] this shooter might woman see martha she
[57:39] was
[57:40] a student and brother branham's pointing
[57:41] out that she
[57:43] was knowing that shudomite woman had
[57:45] faith in the prophet amen
[57:48] and that was being god's representative
[57:50] on earth
[57:51] and that was elijah and god was
[57:54] representing
[57:55] that was his representation in his day
[57:58] amen and she was knowing and seeing
[58:02] enough
[58:02] that jesus was the representative of
[58:05] that day
[58:06] hallelujah amen and so you think about
[58:09] what mary was going through
[58:11] and the call came to to martha that
[58:15] that jesus had been calling and
[58:18] came and called amen and i just feel
[58:20] like
[58:21] in my heart i say lord i know you've
[58:24] been calling a bride
[58:25] out of denominationalism out of
[58:27] selfishness out of lawlessness
[58:30] to come into the the the seven course
[58:33] meal amen and now she is
[58:37] sitting long enough under the word being
[58:39] dressed by the word
[58:41] and now she's representing
[58:44] heaven amen this is where the the
[58:48] deliverance is this is where
[58:51] satisfaction is
[58:52] amen it's in the representation of
[58:55] heaven
[58:56] in the form of the bride of jesus christ
[58:59] amen amen
[59:03] so wonderful to think
[59:06] that god chose you and predestinated you
[59:10] to be the lighthouse to be the very
[59:13] representation
[59:14] where those who are lost those who don't
[59:18] even
[59:18] realize that time
[59:22] is winding down and all they can see is
[59:26] whether or not they'll have the schools
[59:29] open back
[59:29] up or or whether or not they'll get a
[59:31] raise next
[59:33] quarter because of the economy
[59:37] my i believe it's times like this that
[59:40] we can allow god to reset our vision
[59:43] to refocus on what's what's really
[59:46] important amen
[59:48] if if we don't have the hope of the
[59:51] resurrection we of all people are most
[59:53] miserable amen there is a resurrected
[59:57] savior living in a people that has been
[1:00:00] redeemed
[1:00:01] that that here from heaven that prophecy
[1:00:04] that's been spoken
[1:00:06] that spirit will live again amen
[1:00:10] thinking about job and thinking about
[1:00:12] the
[1:00:13] situation that job came to and
[1:00:16] no doubt if he knew that the appointment
[1:00:19] that was made and
[1:00:20] and how that you know there was a
[1:00:23] conversation between god and satan
[1:00:26] and there was going to be a test you
[1:00:29] know
[1:00:30] and god
[1:00:33] allowing the devil to say you know his
[1:00:35] mockery saying you know
[1:00:37] job's like your little pet you put a
[1:00:39] little fence around him and you know you
[1:00:40] pet him you don't
[1:00:41] and and he said knob you can't get him
[1:00:44] to curse him
[1:00:46] and yet they they
[1:00:49] the trials come and yet when the trials
[1:00:52] come upon
[1:00:53] us we know god's requirement
[1:00:57] he said
[1:01:02] if we confess our faults one to another
[1:01:04] god is faithful to cleanse us of every
[1:01:06] sin amen
[1:01:08] that that atonement
[1:01:12] it cleanses from all sin amen
[1:01:16] and to think about job and he made his
[1:01:19] he made his stand and yet
[1:01:23] when he lost everything he lost his
[1:01:25] health he lost his wealth
[1:01:29] you know he lost his family
[1:01:32] and in that trying moment it was in that
[1:01:35] dark
[1:01:36] hour and even
[1:01:39] even
[1:01:42] that the voice that the devil the enemy
[1:01:46] tried to
[1:01:47] say that he would get
[1:01:52] job to curse
[1:01:55] you know there was that voice of his
[1:01:57] companion
[1:02:00] and yet standing with the word he said
[1:02:02] thou
[1:02:03] speak is like a foolish woman he wasn't
[1:02:05] saying she was an unbeliever but
[1:02:07] you know we're subject to carnal nature
[1:02:12] so so we want to make sure that we're
[1:02:14] taking up the right voice amen we want
[1:02:17] to keep the right attitude towards the
[1:02:19] circumstances
[1:02:20] in the world to all that's going on you
[1:02:23] know it's it's easy to take up the wrong
[1:02:25] voice
[1:02:26] when we're feeding on the wrong things
[1:02:29] amen god help us
[1:02:31] god help us to stay with the word
[1:02:34] to stay faithful to feed on the message
[1:02:36] of the hour
[1:02:37] and not filter it amen with
[1:02:41] man's thinking amen
[1:02:44] thinking about job and you know he just
[1:02:47] in that
[1:02:47] dark hour because god he
[1:02:50] spoke he said i c he will not deny
[1:02:54] he will not deny me amen and there's
[1:02:57] something about the prophecy
[1:02:59] of our day for this bride she is going
[1:03:03] to
[1:03:04] stand the test amen take courage saints
[1:03:08] you've got the goods in you to stand the
[1:03:10] test
[1:03:12] amen we just want to feed on the right
[1:03:15] things
[1:03:16] and that way we can have the right
[1:03:18] attitude so dead to our senses
[1:03:28] amen
[1:03:32] she had the right response speaking of
[1:03:35] martha
[1:03:37] when she was questioned on her test
[1:03:45] she must have went out there and she
[1:03:47] knew that god had manifest himself
[1:03:50] and she watched and watched when she
[1:03:52] come
[1:03:53] they followed her and to see what she
[1:03:56] would say
[1:03:57] now she went out there and fell down
[1:04:00] before him
[1:04:00] first and said lord
[1:04:04] what was it if thou would have been here
[1:04:06] my brother would not have died see
[1:04:08] thy brother would not have died
[1:04:12] and she he said thy brother will rise
[1:04:15] and he yes lord he'll rise in
[1:04:19] the last day at the general resurrection
[1:04:20] he was a good boy
[1:04:22] he'll rise in the last days see they
[1:04:25] believed in the general resurrection
[1:04:27] jesus said but i am the resurrection in
[1:04:30] life
[1:04:30] oh my the life and
[1:04:34] my after turned her down how could a man
[1:04:38] that resurrects your life treat her
[1:04:40] friend like that
[1:04:42] sometimes he's testing you to see what
[1:04:44] you'll do
[1:04:46] put you put the thing before you and to
[1:04:51] see what you'll do with
[1:04:52] it he might do it tonight
[1:04:55] he was he has been doing it so just to
[1:04:59] see what you'll do about it
[1:05:01] amen you know that's the same thing with
[1:05:04] you and me
[1:05:05] amen god's showing that he likes to see
[1:05:08] the reaction of his children amen and we
[1:05:12] just want to maintain the right attitude
[1:05:14] you think about martha's response amen
[1:05:16] that's what my heart's desire is
[1:05:19] lord let me reflect this kind of
[1:05:22] attitude she said this she said then
[1:05:24] when we find out that
[1:05:26] when what was the next thing that was
[1:05:28] done she said
[1:05:29] i believe that thou art the son of god
[1:05:32] which is come into the world
[1:05:34] amen and that's exactly what he
[1:05:37] confessed to be
[1:05:38] amen even now
[1:05:42] though my brother is dead though he's
[1:05:44] embalmed though he's buried though he
[1:05:47] stinketh and in the grave
[1:05:49] but even now whatever you ask god
[1:05:52] god will give it to you amen there you
[1:05:56] are
[1:05:57] there you are that's the key note she
[1:06:00] believed in what he asked
[1:06:03] if he asked god for her god would hear
[1:06:06] her prayer
[1:06:08] even now whatever you ask god god will
[1:06:11] give it to you
[1:06:14] now could you have that kind of faith
[1:06:16] tonight
[1:06:17] in god's word well jesus is his word
[1:06:21] could you have that much faith in god's
[1:06:24] word
[1:06:25] when it's just as directly identified
[1:06:27] for this day
[1:06:28] as much as was identified in that day
[1:06:32] whatever you ask god god will give it to
[1:06:35] you
[1:06:35] amen and aren't you thankful that the
[1:06:38] the the scripture says whatever you
[1:06:40] ask in my name i'll do it amen and we
[1:06:43] know
[1:06:44] that there is a sacred trust imparted to
[1:06:48] the believer
[1:06:49] in this hour and we know that when we
[1:06:52] have
[1:06:52] need of it the power of the resurrection
[1:06:55] is available to the believers
[1:06:57] amen even now no matter how
[1:07:01] dark it is no matter what the symptoms
[1:07:04] are
[1:07:04] amen god is able to deliver the victory
[1:07:08] into your hands
[1:07:09] amen doesn't it say in the bible
[1:07:14] that he sits at the right hand of the
[1:07:16] majesty
[1:07:23] not like not like a right hand like a
[1:07:26] man

[1:07:47] the right hand of power of his majesty
[1:07:51] sitting here ready to make intercession

[1:07:58] called on
[1:07:58] amen if you have a need tonight find
[1:08:01] your voice

[1:08:10] told me i can't live but a week even now
[1:08:13] lord whatever you ask
[1:08:15] god will give it to you amen god is just
[1:08:19] waiting for us to harmonize with his
[1:08:22] heartbeat with his word amen
[1:08:26] whenever the believer in god
[1:08:30] gets turning together it generates the
[1:08:32] power
[1:08:33] of his resurrection amen that little
[1:08:36] will of
[1:08:37] faith getting the big will of god moving
[1:08:40] amen
[1:08:41] that's what we want in our lives as
[1:08:42] believers is to let our little faith
[1:08:45] in the big god bring to pass every word
[1:08:48] amen i want to have that

[1:10:17] the word of god
[1:10:18] amen in first corinthians

[1:10:26] it just you know if if there's
[1:10:29] something that i want on my lips

[1:10:36] what the cross of calvary did for me
[1:10:39] you know when the enemy comes and brings
[1:10:42] some news
[1:10:43] that i have no money in the bank i have
[1:10:46] no home to go to

[1:11:01] he's broke the bondage of sin and i am
[1:11:04] in
[1:11:04] direct contact i don't need a pope
[1:11:07] i don't need a dead saint to intercede
[1:11:10] for me i have a living christ in my
[1:11:12] heart
[1:11:13] speaking to me peace in the midst of
[1:11:15] storms
[1:11:16] amen in first corinthians 15

[1:11:38] sound and the dead shall rise
[1:11:40] incorruptable
[1:11:41] and we shall be changed for this
[1:11:43] corruptable
[1:11:45] shall put on immortality and this mortal

[1:11:52] this shall have put on incorruptive
[1:11:56] incorruption and this mortality
[1:11:59] have put on immortality then shall

[1:12:05] that is written death is swallowed up in
[1:12:08] victory
