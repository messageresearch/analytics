[34:01] but you lord will we ever remain
[34:04] we ask you just to be with us tonight in
[34:07] this time of fellowship
[34:09] in jesus precious and
[34:12] wonderful name we pray
[34:14] amen
[34:16] amen
[34:17] god bless you tonight if you have your
[34:19] bibles and
[34:20] and we just have a
[34:22] a simple thought tonight and
[34:26] just as we're
[34:28] building and
[34:32] and going down our our life's road
[34:36] we'd like to turn over
[34:38] in the book of proverbs
[34:41] and uh
[34:45] to proverbs the 16th
[34:49] chapter of proverbs
[34:51] and
[34:52] the 25th verse
[34:55] and then we'll turn back a page
[34:57] to proverbs
[34:59] now
[35:00] if you don't turn your bible you're
[35:02] going to think i'm repeating myself
[35:05] so for these just
[35:07] as we
[35:08] read proverbs 16 and 25
[35:12] there is a way
[35:14] that seemeth a right
[35:17] unto a man
[35:19] but the end thereof
[35:21] are the ways
[35:23] of death
[35:25] let's flip back over
[35:27] and turn the page over if your bibles
[35:29] are like mine
[35:31] to the 14th chapter
[35:34] and we'll read
[35:36] in the 12th verse
[35:39] there is a way which seemeth right
[35:43] unto a man
[35:45] but the end thereof
[35:47] are the ways of death
[35:50] even in laughter
[35:53] the heart
[35:54] is sorrowful
[35:55] and the end of that mirth is heaviness
[36:00] the backslider
[36:01] in heart shall be
[36:04] filled with his own ways
[36:07] that's a quite a statement
[36:10] that if you just uh hold it there for a
[36:12] minute the backslider in heart
[36:15] shall be filled with his own ways there
[36:19] is a way that seemeth right unto a man
[36:23] but the end of that way of death a
[36:26] backslider
[36:28] is filled
[36:29] with his own
[36:31] ways
[36:33] and a good man shall be satisfied from
[36:36] himself
[36:38] the simple believeth every word and
[36:40] that's not every word of god
[36:43] that's anything that anybody tells you
[36:47] the the
[36:48] the simple believeth
[36:51] the internet
[36:57] just throwing that out there to try to
[36:59] bring from perspective
[37:01] uh but the prudent man looketh well
[37:05] to his
[37:06] going the prudent man looked at the well
[37:11] to where he's going
[37:13] where he's ending up
[37:15] what's really
[37:17] happening
[37:19] okay
[37:20] and
[37:21] there is going and a wise man feareth
[37:24] and departeth
[37:26] from evil
[37:28] but the fool
[37:31] rageth
[37:32] and is confident
[37:34] heavenly father we ask you to
[37:37] bless your word to us tonight
[37:39] in jesus precious name we pray amen
[37:43] god bless you tonight
[37:48] you know i i enjoy sometimes
[37:52] just sitting down
[37:54] and just taking a few moments to
[37:56] look at the scriptures
[37:58] uh
[37:59] the the
[38:00] the scriptures uh
[38:03] are are marvelous to us
[38:06] in fact we understand really what a
[38:10] messenger is
[38:11] or
[38:12] any prophet is
[38:14] he's a divine
[38:16] interpreter of the word of god
[38:19] and so we know there's certain things
[38:21] you can't do
[38:23] with the word of god
[38:25] is that you can't misplace it
[38:27] you can't take it out of season
[38:31] there there's uh it it always remains
[38:34] the same it can't be rewritten
[38:37] or changed and it has one meaning
[38:42] it's not given to
[38:44] multiple uh
[38:47] thoughts and
[38:48] we find that today i just want to cover
[38:51] some basis as we go on fellowshipping
[38:55] a little more
[39:04] oh we're draining the water out of the
[39:06] baptistry i'm sorry you can't hear it
[39:08] but i feel like i'm going down the drain
[39:12] i hope i'm not i
[39:14] i hope that uh
[39:16] uh
[39:18] you know as the crowds get smaller you
[39:20] start to think that you're going down
[39:22] the drain but i then i go look up what
[39:25] the prophet of god said he said you know
[39:27] the word of god doesn't always draw
[39:29] everybody
[39:30] amen so we we
[39:33] we're we're talking about our way
[39:36] okay and there is a way
[39:38] jesus said i am the way
[39:42] and i realized that more and more that
[39:45] the brother brown always emphasized to
[39:48] us and and we've got to understand he
[39:51] never came
[39:52] to point to himself
[39:55] the purpose that was within his heart
[39:58] was he had a message that was given to
[40:01] him
[40:02] from almighty god to deliver
[40:06] to his people
[40:08] and the purpose was not to convert the
[40:11] whole world
[40:13] he knew who his own were
[40:16] my sheep hear my voice
[40:18] and they will not follow
[40:21] he knew that there was elected people
[40:26] that would hear what was being said
[40:29] and that the spirit of god would
[40:31] increase
[40:33] their understanding
[40:36] we understand in this age of all ages
[40:39] that satan appears
[40:42] as an angel of light
[40:45] so he doesn't appear to be evil he
[40:49] appears it appears to be right
[40:52] and and so
[40:54] we we find out that that in the hour
[40:58] that we're living in that there is a way
[41:02] away god's always had a way of doing
[41:06] things a wise man he looketh up he
[41:10] looketh to his ways he he he he he look
[41:14] as to his going
[41:16] the scripture says it looks so what what
[41:19] what he's going what way is he going
[41:22] what's going on but but uh a foolish man
[41:26] he just listens to everything
[41:28] sure
[41:30] you know what i mean if somebody comes
[41:31] along and says oh everything's okay
[41:34] and everything's fine he says
[41:36] everything's okay everything's fine
[41:40] you know uh that someone says there's no
[41:43] lawlessness in our country yeah
[41:46] there's no lawlessness everything's fine
[41:50] uh you know look at my my brother he is
[41:52] uh
[41:53] uh my brother michael
[41:55] uh he's uh
[41:57] four years older than i am
[41:59] and uh
[42:01] and you know he lives in austin and
[42:04] and uh
[42:05] and he would be he's an old hippie
[42:08] is is what he is you know and uh
[42:12] and he's got a lot of what we would
[42:14] refer to as open
[42:17] uh politics and
[42:19] and everything and he only listens
[42:22] to
[42:23] one
[42:24] voice
[42:25] of reason
[42:26] that that's all he's got the people that
[42:29] he listens to and
[42:31] and and he'll he'll bring up things to
[42:33] me and i don't even
[42:35] want to go there
[42:37] you know what i mean but he
[42:39] just will bring it up to me
[42:41] anyway
[42:43] and so i i went down to see him and
[42:46] and david junior and i gave him a pickup
[42:48] truck and
[42:50] and uh so you're gonna have to borrow
[42:52] andrew's truck or
[42:54] tommy's truck if you want to move
[42:56] and uh so uh and he he comes up to me
[43:00] and he says you know isn't it amazing
[43:02] that
[43:03] that they're telling all these lies
[43:06] about riots
[43:07] and uh
[43:09] people burning things in the street and
[43:12] breaking into stores and stealing things
[43:18] now
[43:19] i i
[43:21] i was
[43:22] breathless
[43:28] and i said okay
[43:31] great
[43:33] things are better than i thought they
[43:34] were
[43:37] you know what i mean i was worried that
[43:39] the world was coming to an end
[43:43] you know that all the signs that the
[43:45] scripture were
[43:46] were telling me
[43:48] what was transpiring really aren't true
[43:53] and i i thought and i thought
[43:56] i just wanted to say
[43:58] michael
[43:59] you've got to be kidding me
[44:02] look around you
[44:06] and you know my brother lived in a uh he
[44:09] lived in a very middle nice middle class
[44:12] part of town
[44:13] and now all down his block and
[44:16] everything and right down around the
[44:18] corner and everything everybody set up
[44:20] tents
[44:23] you know what i mean and
[44:26] and
[44:27] i think that he feels it's my fault
[44:32] you know it's somebody's fault
[44:36] you know what i mean and i'm saying this
[44:38] because
[44:40] these are the political arguments
[44:44] and i think that we've really got to put
[44:47] the mind of christ in our hearts and our
[44:49] lives
[44:51] and really look at the word of god
[44:54] so
[44:55] i i would say in that respect
[44:59] that
[45:01] my my brother would be what you would
[45:03] consider
[45:05] given
[45:06] to the politics
[45:09] of things
[45:10] and how many knows we're living in a
[45:13] very political cri climate
[45:16] everybody you know what politics is
[45:19] you know what the definition of politics
[45:22] is
[45:24] it's too it's
[45:25] people's ideas in order to gain
[45:30] power
[45:33] that's what it is it's it's the pursuit
[45:36] of power
[45:39] that exactly all if you look up the
[45:41] definition of politics
[45:43] politics is people politicking
[45:48] for
[45:50] the desire
[45:52] to achieve
[45:54] power
[45:55] now let's listen to what brother branham
[45:57] said if you can find it
[45:59] it's in the message knoweth it not
[46:03] that was preached august 15
[46:06] of 1965.
[46:09] i was reading the titles
[46:12] that brother branham preached in
[46:15] 1965
[46:17] and if you just read the titles you can
[46:20] start to be able to get an understanding
[46:23] of what that he was trying to tell the
[46:26] believer
[46:29] and the church world
[46:31] and
[46:32] the world
[46:34] because god never sends judgment
[46:37] without sending a warning first
[46:40] another and it isn't
[46:42] just of a flashing red light when god
[46:46] sent his warning
[46:49] and his
[46:51] revealing
[46:53] of the son of
[46:54] petition and and
[46:57] turned on the light
[47:00] in our hour
[47:01] and told us about the god of this evil
[47:05] age and there's the god of this evil age
[47:08] in other words what this age was
[47:11] worshiping
[47:13] science education their own thinking
[47:17] their own system their own development
[47:20] the way
[47:21] that they feel is right
[47:25] because that's what they worship they
[47:27] worship their own way
[47:31] the way that they're going the way that
[47:34] they're transpiring the way
[47:37] one man spoke the other day and he says
[47:39] my my my great desire is to be buried on
[47:44] mars
[47:48] now think of that right where you're
[47:50] sitting right now
[47:52] and i believe that he believes he has
[47:54] that capability of doing that
[47:59] no they may bury his bones
[48:02] on mars
[48:04] but that ain't where he's going to stay
[48:07] he's going to end up in the sun
[48:14] do you know what i mean by that right
[48:17] okay so
[48:19] okay the very god of this evil age
[48:23] is man worshiping education science
[48:28] knowledge achievement that's what they
[48:31] worship they worship achievement if you
[48:34] say is that true what do they invest in
[48:39] they that's what they invest in that's
[48:42] where they put their their treasures
[48:45] isn't that what the scripture said they
[48:47] put their treasures in it now i want the
[48:51] simplicity of god's word
[48:54] we've got to be able to come back
[48:57] and let the simplicity of god's words
[49:00] enter our minds
[49:02] and our thought processes everything so
[49:05] complicated and everything's moving so
[49:08] fast that that people want to think if
[49:11] you just sit back and take the
[49:13] simplicity of god's word
[49:16] you're you're a
[49:19] or you're not very spiritual
[49:24] you know and paul said if i speak with
[49:26] tongues and
[49:27] angels of men and angels and i i know
[49:30] all the mysteries and everything and
[49:32] don't have the love of god shed abroad
[49:35] in my heart i'm nothing
[49:39] and and and so what what do you think
[49:42] would be really the judge of a wise
[49:46] person
[49:47] in light of what that were talking about
[49:50] it wouldn't the the wise person
[49:54] as the scripture
[49:56] said it is that a
[50:00] a wise man
[50:02] feareth and departeth from evil
[50:06] another
[50:07] how would you
[50:08] what would you feel a wise man really
[50:11] was a man that
[50:14] invested in in in a
[50:17] a technology uh that uh
[50:20] maybe produced alcohol quicker and
[50:23] cheaper than it's ever been produced
[50:26] before and have millions of people die
[50:31] from automobile accidents and and all
[50:34] those things well what would you
[50:36] consider how wise would that be
[50:40] you know so what we get is we get a
[50:43] hunger
[50:45] for
[50:47] spiritual things or spiritual
[50:51] conversation or we could start getting a
[50:54] hunger for the stimulation
[50:57] of our mind and our spiritual senses
[51:01] and looking at things that are going on
[51:05] out here in these realms that we can't
[51:08] touch
[51:10] but we don't even recognize
[51:13] what is actually
[51:15] happening
[51:17] right now what's going on right now
[51:20] what what's transpiring right now if i
[51:23] had a sermon title i i was going to to
[51:26] call this
[51:29] a war
[51:31] disguised
[51:32] by prosperity
[51:37] a war disguised by
[51:40] prosperity
[51:42] so we we talk about this way and now
[51:45] here's what the prophet of god said this
[51:47] is on paragraph 6
[51:49] 44
[51:50] of and knoweth it not
[51:54] and it says
[51:57] we will never do any good
[52:00] with politics
[52:04] now just set let that settle in for a
[52:06] minute
[52:09] we all know what's going on
[52:12] we have what the world calls
[52:15] conservatives and
[52:17] and and and and they want to hold things
[52:20] the way they are
[52:22] you know i mean if it ain't broke
[52:25] don't fix it
[52:28] you don't
[52:29] it ain't one's right
[52:31] and the other is wrong
[52:33] they're both wrong
[52:38] they're both wrong
[52:40] and then you have what you have what's
[52:43] called progressive thinking
[52:46] which is a more modern thinking that
[52:49] wants to change things
[52:53] they want to give everybody free
[52:55] education they want to give everybody
[52:57] free medical
[52:58] they want to give
[53:00] they want to take all the student debt
[53:02] and it can throw it away
[53:05] well hey
[53:07] they want free health care for everybody
[53:10] tell me that every single one of those
[53:13] isn't a good
[53:15] decent thing
[53:20] let's just do it
[53:23] and then you got some you got these
[53:25] people over here trying to draw a
[53:27] picture tonight
[53:28] that
[53:29] wait a minute that's my money
[53:35] what are you doing with your money i'm
[53:37] keeping it for myself
[53:43] well you look at that and he says you've
[53:45] already got enough
[53:47] you've got planes and mansions and land
[53:50] and boats and yachts and all this stuff
[53:53] hey share that with these with people
[53:58] and if you're not careful you get caught
[54:00] right up in it
[54:02] going back and forth and exo okay
[54:06] i could present the conservative idea i
[54:08] can present you the liberal or the
[54:11] progressive idea and if you don't watch
[54:14] yourself
[54:16] you get sucked into making a choice in
[54:19] which either choice is evil
[54:27] where does a man
[54:29] make the right choice
[54:31] when both choices that are presented to
[54:34] him are evil
[54:41] remember
[54:42] that's why this voice
[54:45] we had in this day
[54:47] this guide that we had in this day that
[54:50] quite that away seemeth right unto a man
[54:54] but the end of that way is death
[54:57] all
[54:58] politic outcome is death
[55:02] it's death
[55:03] so he goes on to say he says it'll never
[55:07] go
[55:07] do any good with politics it's rotten
[55:11] god's idea
[55:13] of having a king a righteous king is
[55:17] right
[55:18] how many knows we're going to get a king
[55:21] hallelujah
[55:22] is right
[55:24] but
[55:24] politics
[55:26] just simply spread out
[55:29] you can buy anything out cheat
[55:33] lie steal
[55:35] everything else
[55:37] i as i said a few sundays ago
[55:41] and look where we're at see
[55:45] nothing but just a crooked mass of
[55:49] everything
[55:51] but a righteous king can make his own
[55:53] laws
[55:55] and you can kill a man you know good
[55:59] politics
[56:00] that's all right
[56:02] you get out of it see
[56:05] he said it's it is the
[56:08] the democracy
[56:10] is a good idea
[56:13] but it won't
[56:15] work
[56:21] just like communism
[56:24] all things in common
[56:27] it sounds good
[56:31] but it won't
[56:32] work
[56:34] no
[56:35] god's way of having a king like david
[56:38] was
[56:39] was right and you got one
[56:42] mind centered over
[56:46] you've got
[56:48] one mind
[56:50] centered over
[56:52] how many knows what the scripture tells
[56:54] us let the mind that is in christ being
[56:58] you
[56:59] you have
[57:00] one
[57:01] mind
[57:03] centered over
[57:07] we're looking at the world that we're in
[57:10] we're having men
[57:12] coming up with all kinds
[57:15] of
[57:16] ideas
[57:18] and ways
[57:20] we just read it in the world falling
[57:23] apart
[57:24] they're trying to keep coming up with
[57:27] systems to hold the world together
[57:31] and the more they're trying to hold the
[57:33] world together the farther apart
[57:37] it's getting
[57:42] one mind
[57:44] amen
[57:46] that's a king
[57:48] that there's one mind that's in the
[57:52] center of it all
[57:54] now that's what the prophet of god's
[57:56] telling us
[57:58] that's what he came and told the world
[58:01] here we are fighting communism and
[58:04] communism is fighting
[58:06] us
[58:08] there's a cold war
[58:10] going on
[58:14] and what are they battling for they're
[58:16] battling for
[58:17] prosperity
[58:23] but they don't want
[58:25] one
[58:27] mind
[58:28] then paul comes along and says let this
[58:32] mind
[58:33] be in you
[58:37] now you have a messenger that's standing
[58:39] here in our day
[58:42] telling us the mind of god
[58:46] to god
[58:47] politics is corrupt one way or the other
[58:51] it doesn't matter it's all corrupt
[58:54] it's just men
[58:56] fighting for their own well-being and
[59:00] for power
[59:02] and influence
[59:05] at the end of that way
[59:07] is death
[59:09] a wise man
[59:11] feareth and departeth from evil
[59:13] but a fool rageth and is confident
[59:20] let's look what he goes on to say
[59:25] come here it sounds good but it won't
[59:27] work god's ways are king
[59:29] you got one mind centered over
[59:33] like one liter
[59:34] and a bunch of geese and so forth you
[59:38] can't take two or three of them
[59:42] then you mess
[59:43] them all together and you come up with
[59:47] any kind of idea
[59:54] what do you think he's trying to create
[59:56] in you
[59:58] a bunch of your own
[1:00:01] ideas
[1:00:04] and men start having their own way
[1:00:08] someone told leslie that used to go to
[1:00:10] our church she said have you left the
[1:00:12] message she says we just follow jesus
[1:00:15] oh you're still in the message
[1:00:21] praise god
[1:00:23] so you're not wearing pants you're not
[1:00:25] cutting your hair
[1:00:27] you're not putting on makeup
[1:00:31] well that don't matter
[1:00:32] wait a minute
[1:00:35] it don't matter
[1:00:37] compared to what
[1:00:40] compared to what
[1:00:43] a way seemeth right unto them
[1:00:45] a man
[1:00:46] but the end of that way is death away
[1:00:50] seemeth right unto a man compared
[1:00:53] to
[1:00:54] what
[1:00:59] see that that's what satan's eden is as
[1:01:02] i talked a little bit about god of this
[1:01:05] evil age
[1:01:06] about all the good that's coming out we
[1:01:08] can tell how great it is and how good
[1:01:12] and well
[1:01:14] man is
[1:01:15] man is doing why there's hospitals going
[1:01:18] up like we've never had them before
[1:01:21] praise god
[1:01:25] there's doctors offices on every corner
[1:01:27] and there's new diseases every day and
[1:01:31] new plagues and and millions of us are
[1:01:34] dying hallelujah
[1:01:43] and we're sitting here
[1:01:46] trying to
[1:01:47] whether
[1:01:48] worried or not
[1:01:49] who should wear masks and who shouldn't
[1:01:51] and what's your political statement
[1:01:54] and i'm thinking wait a minute we got
[1:01:56] the wrong mind
[1:02:00] we got the wrong mind
[1:02:03] we've got to get back to something amen
[1:02:06] he said
[1:02:09] he says and we find out
[1:02:11] the condition today
[1:02:13] ready
[1:02:14] for the coming
[1:02:16] of the lord
[1:02:19] let's turn over to paragraph
[1:02:21] 82.
[1:02:27] you don't mind these little bible
[1:02:28] studies like this do you
[1:02:30] i mean just just some real
[1:02:33] down-home
[1:02:34] word teaching
[1:02:36] and no need to get excited
[1:02:39] you know what i'm saying but it excites
[1:02:42] me
[1:02:44] you know so
[1:02:45] let's look at this statement and we
[1:02:49] we've been doing it
[1:02:50] we've been going through this message
[1:02:52] slowly and peeling out one sentence at a
[1:02:56] time
[1:02:58] one mind over it all i hope that sinks
[1:03:01] in tonight
[1:03:03] god's way
[1:03:05] is to have everybody ruled
[1:03:08] by
[1:03:09] one
[1:03:10] mind
[1:03:14] not you going out there and getting with
[1:03:16] your friends and they want to talk
[1:03:18] politics because that's where they're at
[1:03:20] and they want to point out hatred and
[1:03:23] how bad history's been to them and
[1:03:26] okay
[1:03:26] and all that and and and and how how
[1:03:30] terrible it was and it can i it and you
[1:03:33] know uh in my younger days i i really
[1:03:36] studied a lot about irish
[1:03:38] uh uh history and how brutal the english
[1:03:42] work to the irish and how tough the
[1:03:44] irish had it when they came to this
[1:03:46] country but they just formed the mafia
[1:03:50] they solved their problem
[1:03:54] they just became evil
[1:03:57] oh you don't think they did
[1:03:59] who how do you think that how do you
[1:04:01] think the irish
[1:04:03] came out of their depression
[1:04:06] and their low spot
[1:04:08] they became the biggest bootleggers
[1:04:13] that's what they did
[1:04:16] they were
[1:04:17] gangsters
[1:04:19] they were irish just drinkers you know
[1:04:21] what i mean unless you're born again and
[1:04:23] they went that's how they got out of it
[1:04:24] with evil
[1:04:26] how do you think anybody ever gets on
[1:04:28] top of another man
[1:04:32] they rage with evil
[1:04:34] the bible tells us that
[1:04:36] and they're confident
[1:04:38] because they think their way
[1:04:41] is right
[1:04:43] god is no respecter of person
[1:04:48] but listen to what he says here let me
[1:04:50] prophesy something to you
[1:04:53] just before it comes to pass
[1:04:58] the whole world
[1:05:00] is groping
[1:05:02] in
[1:05:02] insanity
[1:05:06] and will get worse
[1:05:08] and worse
[1:05:10] and worse
[1:05:12] until
[1:05:13] there'll be a bunch of maniacs
[1:05:17] and it's almost that way now
[1:05:22] now
[1:05:23] this is the voice
[1:05:25] of warning
[1:05:28] this is the voice that was standing here
[1:05:32] 50 years ago
[1:05:34] telling people that their mind
[1:05:38] was being moved away from the mind of
[1:05:42] god's word
[1:05:44] moved away from the scriptures
[1:05:48] moved away to from
[1:05:51] the word that god had in his mind in the
[1:05:55] first place
[1:05:57] and man was now leaning to their own
[1:06:01] understanding
[1:06:02] and
[1:06:03] fortifying it
[1:06:07] with a deception
[1:06:10] of an angel appearing as an angel of
[1:06:13] light
[1:06:17] we saw
[1:06:18] the angel
[1:06:20] appear
[1:06:22] two times that come to my mind
[1:06:25] once in the garden of eden
[1:06:29] surely you won't die
[1:06:34] and once on mount him to again amount
[1:06:37] temptation
[1:06:39] if thou be the son of god
[1:06:42] it is written
[1:06:45] both times using reasoning
[1:06:48] scriptures remember satan does not
[1:06:53] worry a bit about using scripture
[1:07:02] the foolish man believes
[1:07:05] the simple
[1:07:06] believeth every word
[1:07:12] oh
[1:07:14] well this is great amen
[1:07:16] you just throw out a scripture
[1:07:20] how does that work
[1:07:23] let me tell you how clever he is
[1:07:28] we have so many people today that think
[1:07:31] many ideas
[1:07:33] all of which are okay
[1:07:40] we just love jesus
[1:07:42] i believe in three gods
[1:07:45] you know
[1:07:46] i believe in a little fat guy that puts
[1:07:48] his hand
[1:07:49] arms together and got a little thing on
[1:07:52] his forehead and sits there
[1:07:56] you know buddha's just as good as jesus
[1:08:02] no look
[1:08:03] we're starting to get so sympathetic
[1:08:06] oh you're a buddhist
[1:08:08] wow that's wonderful
[1:08:13] you're hearty krishna oh that's good
[1:08:16] yeah we all going to go to heaven
[1:08:20] that's not what he said
[1:08:26] my sheep know my voice
[1:08:28] all the father hath given me will come
[1:08:33] there's an elected group of people
[1:08:37] who is a minority
[1:08:41] they're not of this world
[1:08:44] they're in
[1:08:45] this world
[1:08:47] do you count yourselves
[1:08:52] if not you're going to count yourself
[1:08:54] with general christianity
[1:08:59] we're all christians
[1:09:02] all our ideas are fine
[1:09:06] they all they're all okay
[1:09:08] they all go
[1:09:10] they all
[1:09:12] were all okay and why do they have
[1:09:14] different ideas
[1:09:16] because you get one group that majors on
[1:09:20] one point
[1:09:22] of it
[1:09:23] they just measure on grace
[1:09:27] grace grace grace
[1:09:32] well
[1:09:33] i love grace
[1:09:35] grace forgave me
[1:09:40] but should we sin
[1:09:43] that grace may abound
[1:09:46] god forbid
[1:09:49] and they'll they'll major up on another
[1:09:51] point you have the holy ghost how do you
[1:09:54] know compared to what well i spoke in
[1:09:57] tongues compared to when i read the
[1:10:00] bible
[1:10:02] i look back at the upper room
[1:10:05] and they got the holy ghost and they
[1:10:07] spoke with tongues and they'd go to two
[1:10:10] or three scriptures
[1:10:14] well if you're going to take it all
[1:10:15] let's go take it all
[1:10:19] so what they do they each one majors on
[1:10:22] an idea
[1:10:23] this is why
[1:10:25] a voice came
[1:10:27] in our day
[1:10:28] and said you've got to take
[1:10:31] all
[1:10:32] of
[1:10:33] the word of god people are getting
[1:10:37] caught up
[1:10:38] excuse me
[1:10:39] and into arguments with people because
[1:10:42] they can't see the whole picture
[1:10:48] they get sucked in to the one train of
[1:10:51] thought argument
[1:10:55] what about the whole picture
[1:10:57] what about the voice that was telling us
[1:11:01] look at where it's going
[1:11:04] what are these things compared to
[1:11:10] what are they compared to let's just
[1:11:12] keep reading here
[1:11:15] the whole world is groping in insanity
[1:11:17] and will get worse
[1:11:19] can you imagine a man driving with his
[1:11:22] lights off
[1:11:24] on the wrong side of the road
[1:11:27] a ricky young kid
[1:11:29] supposed to be right out of high school
[1:11:31] and kill a bunch of people
[1:11:34] how many know about the sport the
[1:11:36] athlete that was driving 140 miles an
[1:11:39] hour and ran into the back of a lady
[1:11:45] it's going on all the time out there
[1:11:49] i suppose someone could
[1:11:51] look right there and find out how many
[1:11:53] deaths are caused by alcohol
[1:11:56] if in this country a year
[1:12:02] young kid supposed to be right out of
[1:12:04] high school killed a bunch of people
[1:12:07] does that stop them
[1:12:09] the next one comes right behind him
[1:12:12] doing the same thing
[1:12:14] can you imagine a young man
[1:12:18] that thinks
[1:12:20] any cell anything of himself
[1:12:24] getting out here and acting the way they
[1:12:27] do
[1:12:31] i just want to drop a tidbit here
[1:12:34] one of the biggest problems a young
[1:12:36] amongst
[1:12:38] young women
[1:12:39] and young men is self-esteem
[1:12:47] i believe they call it shaming
[1:12:51] i think that's a thing they shame you
[1:12:53] about everything they shame you about
[1:12:55] your bald head they shame you about your
[1:12:56] big nose they shame me about i know
[1:12:59] about it i just went to my doctor
[1:13:01] he spent the whole time shaming me
[1:13:05] your blood pressure's too high your
[1:13:06] sugar's too high
[1:13:09] you're too heavy
[1:13:11] you know what i mean i said but god
[1:13:13] still knows where the hair in my head is
[1:13:16] and so he brought this young
[1:13:18] this young doctor in from uh gambia
[1:13:22] which is somewhere by ghana and togo
[1:13:24] right there on the west coast and he's
[1:13:26] sitting over there and i says well not
[1:13:28] i'm going to give you a lesson right now
[1:13:32] i says i like but dr joseph is a good
[1:13:35] guy i said but
[1:13:36] i'm going to give you a lesson
[1:13:39] i said if god wants me to stay here
[1:13:44] there's not enough disease
[1:13:46] and sickness
[1:13:48] and devils to take me.
[1:13:56] and i said and if god wants to take me
[1:13:59] there's not enough doctors
[1:14:01] medicine and science to keep me here
[1:14:05] my doctor just throws up his hand says i
[1:14:07] can't tell him anything
[1:14:14] i said you guys
[1:14:16] are not
[1:14:20] prolonging my life
[1:14:22] you're just trying to choose the way it
[1:14:24] ends
[1:14:32] you see what i'm saying
[1:14:34] man i'm not going to get caught in that
[1:14:36] trap
[1:14:38] i went to the doctor one time he said
[1:14:40] you got asthma wrote me a bunch of
[1:14:42] asthma medicine and
[1:14:44] everything i went out got in my truck
[1:14:46] put put on a tape
[1:14:48] cassette and he said anybody know what
[1:14:51] that is
[1:14:54] and
[1:14:55] brother brown comes on he says that come
[1:14:57] scratching the door throw it out you
[1:14:58] know
[1:15:00] i said i'm not i'm not believing that
[1:15:03] i just never went back never had a speck
[1:15:06] of asthma
[1:15:09] anywhere
[1:15:12] i don't know where he got that diagnosis
[1:15:14] he must have had stock in the medicine
[1:15:21] you might think
[1:15:23] what's motivating the things people tell
[1:15:25] you
[1:15:27] isn't that what the scripture says
[1:15:30] he says the simple believeth every word
[1:15:33] but the prudent man looketh well to his
[1:15:37] going
[1:15:39] what is motivating me here
[1:15:45] anyway
[1:15:47] let's just read
[1:15:48] i'll close
[1:15:50] he says that don't stop him
[1:15:54] no any man thinks anything of himself
[1:15:56] getting out here and acting the way they
[1:15:59] do
[1:16:01] self-esteem
[1:16:04] they don't have one head
[1:16:07] they don't have a voice
[1:16:09] they don't know who to listen to
[1:16:12] right
[1:16:15] and
[1:16:15] and this is what the scripture is a
[1:16:17] backslider
[1:16:18] in heart shall be filled with his own
[1:16:21] ways
[1:16:23] and a good man shall be satisfied from
[1:16:27] himself
[1:16:33] not worry to what other people think
[1:16:38] not work he's satisfied with the
[1:16:40] goodness
[1:16:42] and the love
[1:16:43] of god
[1:16:44] that's in his heart
[1:16:51] amazing scripture isn't it
[1:16:55] can you imagine a young woman
[1:16:57] in the bloom of womanhood beautiful
[1:17:00] well-built shape
[1:17:02] profile
[1:17:03] face beautiful
[1:17:05] and the very thing of her being pretty
[1:17:08] shows that we're at the end time
[1:17:11] see
[1:17:12] she was went all together to worldly
[1:17:17] features
[1:17:20] she's gone all together to worldly
[1:17:24] features
[1:17:27] don't judge yourself
[1:17:29] by the world
[1:17:34] i mean it's it's just insanity
[1:17:40] if you start looking
[1:17:43] you know i i think that i think you need
[1:17:45] to get in your prayer closet and pray a
[1:17:48] little bit if you're looking over your
[1:17:50] shoulder at the mirror
[1:17:54] and it says see
[1:17:57] all together to worldly features worldly
[1:18:01] things
[1:18:02] and not the beauty of holiness and
[1:18:05] sweetness in her soul
[1:18:12] he's back there telling the people
[1:18:15] years ago i'm talking about the message
[1:18:18] that was preached
[1:18:20] the message that we're forgetting
[1:18:24] the abcs what brother bran what the war
[1:18:28] was about
[1:18:32] but he disguised the war
[1:18:35] with prosperity
[1:18:37] because we became blind miserable poor
[1:18:40] wretched and naked and didn't know it
[1:18:44] because we prosper
[1:18:50] right
[1:18:51] and have goods
[1:18:55] that's what cathy said we have need of
[1:18:57] nothing
[1:18:59] we've got it all and the war
[1:19:03] am i insane
[1:19:04] okay and the war is going on
[1:19:09] over the issues that we're discussing
[1:19:13] and you've been privileged
[1:19:15] by god to give you eyes have
[1:19:19] that you can understand that you're
[1:19:22] neglected separated called out people
[1:19:26] and you're not given to think the way
[1:19:28] the world is you're given to have the
[1:19:30] mind of christ and be under the one
[1:19:34] mind of the word
[1:19:41] we started preaching mysteries and left
[1:19:44] the message behind
[1:19:50] really these are abc's this is what
[1:19:52] we're built on
[1:19:53] we're built on satan appearing as an
[1:19:57] angel of light
[1:19:58] and another mighty angel poking his foot
[1:20:02] on the land and the sea
[1:20:06] he said the sweetener
[1:20:08] i've seen women on the outside of them
[1:20:12] wasn't nothing to look at but you speak
[1:20:14] to them one time
[1:20:16] talk to them a few minutes
[1:20:19] they're real genuine something that you
[1:20:22] can't get away from see beauty of the
[1:20:25] outside is of the devil
[1:20:30] it's of the world
[1:20:33] and we have a prophet they're yelling at
[1:20:34] us
[1:20:36] they spend more on cosmetics
[1:20:39] than they do food
[1:20:44] see we we we
[1:20:46] we don't we don't get the thing so that
[1:20:50] man comes up with all these ideas they
[1:20:52] major on one point they forget the rest
[1:20:55] of it
[1:20:59] and that's the deception
[1:21:03] can you imagine anybody saying that
[1:21:06] something that's written in the word of
[1:21:07] god
[1:21:08] doesn't matter
[1:21:14] that don't matter
[1:21:16] it don't matter how you're baptized
[1:21:21] it don't matter if you smoke as long as
[1:21:23] you do it in moderation
[1:21:26] it don't matter it don't matter it don't
[1:21:30] matter
[1:21:34] nothing matters
[1:21:36] that's the point
[1:21:38] it doesn't matter
[1:21:41] compared to what
[1:21:44] because men compare themselves one to
[1:21:47] another
[1:21:49] and the scripture says you're fools
[1:21:52] because you're comparing yourselves one
[1:21:55] to another
[1:21:57] you're okay i'm okay
[1:22:02] and if then the world's out here
[1:22:04] comparing themselves one to another so
[1:22:07] the anybody's id is okay
[1:22:11] right and then they'll say
[1:22:14] and
[1:22:15] so they'll major on one point if you
[1:22:16] want to major on that point and forget
[1:22:18] the rest that's okay
[1:22:20] many ideas all of which are okay and it
[1:22:24] takes away from the deity of god
[1:22:32] it completely does away with one of the
[1:22:35] am i i'm just i'm just inspired
[1:22:41] it takes away from one of the statements
[1:22:43] that brother branham screamed out over
[1:22:46] this generation remember he came to
[1:22:49] bring judgment
[1:22:51] to this world
[1:22:54] he called to set you free
[1:22:59] and
[1:23:00] drive the all
[1:23:03] in their ear
[1:23:05] he came to call you out
[1:23:08] and they go back into to slavery
[1:23:14] okay
[1:23:15] and so it does completely away with the
[1:23:17] deity of god
[1:23:20] in the beginning was the word
[1:23:23] the word was with god and the word was
[1:23:27] god
[1:23:28] in the beginning god
[1:23:31] in the beginning it's a good idea
[1:23:34] it's if
[1:23:36] many ideas are okay major on one point
[1:23:39] but the whole idea is your ideas are
[1:23:41] okay compared to what
[1:23:47] compared to what
[1:23:49] and here's this voice screaming back to
[1:23:52] the word back to the word back to the
[1:23:55] word how can you say you're filled with
[1:23:57] the spirit of god and deny the word
[1:24:02] this message wasn't just brother bannon
[1:24:04] coming up it was the word made flesh
[1:24:11] so the gentiles could absolutely look at
[1:24:14] the word made flesh and crucify it again
[1:24:18] i indict this generation for the second
[1:24:21] crucifixion of the word
[1:24:28] those are the things that
[1:24:30] we should have eyes have
[1:24:32] to see
[1:24:33] but in the world just pining us surely
[1:24:36] you won't die surely god doesn't mean
[1:24:39] that
[1:24:43] why because he's got an eden
[1:24:49] we come from a garden
[1:24:53] not from skyscrapers
[1:25:00] we came from a place there wasn't no
[1:25:02] cement
[1:25:05] and steel
[1:25:10] man's just been progressing and
[1:25:11] progressing and progressing
[1:25:16] now they're starting to go up in space
[1:25:17] and take joy rides in space and
[1:25:20] and
[1:25:22] it's gone
[1:25:26] you know and we just got to come back
[1:25:28] to the thing so what do they do they
[1:25:30] take away from the deity of god
[1:25:34] and they take away from the absoluteness
[1:25:37] of god
[1:25:38] that god has a way
[1:25:43] he's got a truth
[1:25:45] he's got a way and his way is his
[1:25:49] word
[1:25:52] in the beginning was the way
[1:25:57] and this is what we've got to do just in
[1:26:00] our own lives you young people you you
[1:26:03] go to school
[1:26:05] and they feed you all kinds of stuff and
[1:26:08] they make you read romeo and juliet and
[1:26:10] and
[1:26:12] crazy stuff like that grapes of wrath
[1:26:14] and of mice and men and
[1:26:17] war and peace and peace and death and
[1:26:21] you know does anybody read any of that
[1:26:23] stuff anybody know what i'm talking
[1:26:24] about that's kind of stuff i had to read
[1:26:30] i hated it
[1:26:32] i never could read
[1:26:35] i'd have people read to me and then
[1:26:38] have them tell me
[1:26:40] stuff and
[1:26:42] i wanted to get out of there
[1:26:44] and i still want to get out of here
[1:26:47] i thank god for jesus christ
[1:26:50] i thank god for the word of god
[1:26:53] i thank god for the blood
[1:26:55] i thank god for i sav
[1:26:58] that i can see
[1:27:00] you know one of the things we're asked
[1:27:01] to have in this day is i sap
[1:27:07] that we can see
[1:27:10] to be clothed in white rain of it
[1:27:13] so your nakedness does not appear
[1:27:17] other words
[1:27:18] don't put on these ideas
[1:27:24] of the world
[1:27:25] so you're wearing these ideas and they
[1:27:28] can see that you're naked
[1:27:30] of the word of god
[1:27:34] don't get it so carnal in your mind that
[1:27:36] you just think he's talking about good
[1:27:38] dresses and
[1:27:40] and shirts and stuff
[1:27:42] he's talking about spiritual nakedness
[1:27:49] a person can be
[1:27:51] you can see
[1:27:52] and still be blind
[1:27:54] that's what he's trying to con
[1:27:56] don't let the world put the world on you
[1:28:01] that that it shows
[1:28:03] that you're not covered
[1:28:05] with the word
[1:28:07] so if you don't have the word you might
[1:28:09] have clothes on but you're naked
[1:28:12] you're without covering
[1:28:15] and gold tried in fire
[1:28:19] real christian character
[1:28:21] to discern between good and evil
[1:28:24] and know the difference
[1:28:27] and let me bring it back in closing
[1:28:31] we ought to be thankful
[1:28:34] for our election
[1:28:37] else we would be in that
[1:28:40] and not know it though our way would be
[1:28:42] the way of death
[1:28:44] because sent a voice
[1:28:47] in this day
[1:28:48] the trump of an archangel
[1:28:52] that we could hear
[1:28:55] and that we could understand that that
[1:28:58] that there was a trump there was a shout
[1:29:02] get yourself ready
[1:29:04] come out from amongst my people
[1:29:07] i know it's been years
[1:29:10] how many years
[1:29:12] ago did paul preach
[1:29:15] how many years ago did peter preach
[1:29:20] it don't matter what our clock
[1:29:22] says because we're not clock people
[1:29:27] we're eternal people
[1:29:29] we don't have clock life
[1:29:34] you can't say oh ben
[1:29:36] you know in uh
[1:29:39] was it 2030 and
[1:29:42] in
[1:29:43] 2037
[1:29:45] brother mcgeary died
[1:29:48] well that's kind of victory to the fact
[1:29:50] that i was born
[1:29:53] again
[1:29:58] and grave has no victory
[1:30:00] and death has no sting
[1:30:03] and i don't die
[1:30:05] you say on my grave on such and such day
[1:30:09] brother mcgeary left this dimension into
[1:30:12] another dimension
[1:30:16] because the gift of god is
[1:30:18] eternal life
[1:30:20] through christ jesus
[1:30:23] so when we can hold these anchors
[1:30:28] when we can hold these fundamental
[1:30:30] principles
[1:30:31] when we can understand the war is going
[1:30:34] on
[1:30:35] the war for your mind the war for your
[1:30:39] thinking the war for your headship
[1:30:43] right
[1:30:44] and that's the capstone
[1:30:48] as john said little children god is
[1:30:51] love
[1:30:52] god is his word you can't separate love
[1:30:57] and the word
[1:30:59] and faith in the word so we're part of
[1:31:03] something
[1:31:04] and i feel that as i've watched
[1:31:07] people fall away
[1:31:11] i i understand
[1:31:14] that i've
[1:31:15] i failed
[1:31:18] in not making clear
[1:31:21] the deception
[1:31:26] of this present
[1:31:28] world
[1:31:32] and how that we've let fancy sermons
[1:31:36] move us away from literally what's
[1:31:39] transpiring
[1:31:42] in our daily lives
[1:31:44] and how satan is trying to grab control
[1:31:48] of your mind
[1:31:50] using politics
[1:31:52] education
[1:31:55] civilization
[1:31:57] and we're losing
[1:31:59] the headship
[1:32:01] of the one mind
[1:32:03] of god
[1:32:08] and they shame us
[1:32:10] for it
[1:32:14] shame on you thinking you're elected
[1:32:18] shame on you thinking you're called out
[1:32:21] shame on you
[1:32:23] ferc
[1:32:26] thinking
[1:32:28] and i i i look
[1:32:30] out at once i said you know
[1:32:32] fool me once
[1:32:35] it's my fault
[1:32:37] it's your fault fool me twice is my
[1:32:39] fault right
[1:32:40] i ain't gonna buy their lie
[1:32:43] not when it's been so
[1:32:47] prevalently
[1:32:48] made
[1:32:49] and exposed
[1:32:51] god of this evil age satan's eden
[1:32:55] doing god a service
[1:32:56] without it being his will god's provided
[1:33:00] way
[1:33:02] seed is not heir with the shock
[1:33:06] i mean
[1:33:07] message after message after message in
[1:33:10] this 1965
[1:33:13] pointing out
[1:33:15] the deception
[1:33:18] what i say is sometimes we can get to
[1:33:21] balanced
[1:33:22] over here on who we are and where we
[1:33:24] come from and everything that we get
[1:33:26] sucked out of the battle
[1:33:32] and the enemy
[1:33:34] creeps in
[1:33:38] he's not working
[1:33:39] on what you believe
[1:33:42] he's working on what you don't
[1:33:44] see
[1:33:48] so let's put up our guards
[1:33:51] let's let's
[1:33:53] let's be and and i don't want to leave
[1:33:55] that part
[1:33:57] out of the message can if i fail
[1:34:00] to
[1:34:02] get down and teach some of these people
[1:34:05] the basic abcs
[1:34:09] of the vision
[1:34:11] of recognizing the day and its message
[1:34:15] then i ask you to forgive me
[1:34:19] because men fail
[1:34:21] but god's word
[1:34:23] never
[1:34:24] fails
[1:34:27] so always in your life
[1:34:30] look at which way
[1:34:33] you're going
[1:34:35] those are great words of advice
[1:34:37] great scripture so let's just continue
[1:34:39] forward let's not be ashamed when we
[1:34:42] preach against the things in the abcs
[1:34:45] and holiness and godliness
[1:34:47] and add that in with the mysteries and
[1:34:50] the revelation of who we are and our
[1:34:52] names are on the lamb's book of light we
[1:34:54] don't want our nakedness
[1:34:56] to appear
[1:34:57] we want to take all the word of god
[1:34:59] every part when it hurts we want to take
[1:35:01] that when it feels good we want to take
[1:35:04] that but we want any man to be able to
[1:35:07] come into the gospel and have hope
[1:35:11] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:35:14] today and forever god bless you brother
[1:35:28] and
[1:35:37] in christ alone
