[41:40] as we heard this
[41:42] morning says this and when Abram was 90
[41:47] years old and nine the Lord appeared to
[41:51] Abram and said unto him I am the Mighty
[41:55] God walk before me and and be thou
[41:58] perfect amen praise the Lord and also
[42:02] you turn to me to with me to First
[42:06] John first John we'll start in the first
[42:15] verse what a privilege that God would
[42:18] ask us to walk with him and he wouldn't
[42:21] say to walk with him in that condition
[42:24] if it wasn't something that he planted
[42:26] within us
[42:27] walk thou perfect
[42:30] amen thinking about this and in 1 John 1
[42:35] and verse 5 we'll read through seven it
[42:38] says this then is the message which we
[42:42] have heard of him and declare unto you
[42:45] that God is light and in him is no
[42:49] Darkness at all if we say that we have
[42:52] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[42:55] we lie and and do not the truth but if
[43:00] we walk in the light as he is in the
[43:02] light we have Fellowship one with the
[43:05] other and the blood of Jesus his son
[43:08] cleanses us from all sin amen we trust
[43:12] the Lord will bless the reading of his
[43:14] word you may have your
[43:16] seats you
[43:19] know I'll say this we
[43:23] um we want to look into a little quote
[43:27] that brother brandham said and how can I
[43:30] overcome and this is a very
[43:33] familiar message that we quote but it
[43:37] says this in paragraph
[43:39] 33 he's speaking about how he wanted to
[43:42] speak on this subject but he says I
[43:45] chose this because I think the time that
[43:47] we should never let the spirit of
[43:49] Revival
[43:50] die we've got to keep in Revival
[43:55] constantly reviv
[43:57] every day Paul said he had to Die daily
[44:03] that Christ could
[44:04] live we must never let Revival die
[44:09] within us and so as a little subject as
[44:13] the Lord placed this thought perfect
[44:15] Fellowship you know as a maybe a subth
[44:19] thought is keeping Revival constantly
[44:22] revived every day you know uh this this
[44:27] past week we was able to have a job that
[44:30] sent us out to uh streetport brother
[44:33] Tommy and I was doing some in installing
[44:35] us some cabinets and as this thought was
[44:39] you know pouring in my
[44:41] heart Tommy and I begin to Fellowship
[44:44] you know and sometimes God would deal
[44:47] with you on a certain subject and you
[44:49] know I got to thinking you know it's you
[44:51] know let's let's let's put our faith
[44:53] together and let's really focus down you
[44:55] know and that's that's what I believe
[44:57] believe what brother brandom's talking
[44:58] about you know we want to Die daily that
[45:01] Christ might live we have to have that
[45:03] Earnest expectation like our brother
[45:05] Billy was pointing out that God's going
[45:08] to speak to me not only is he going to
[45:10] speak to me but he wants to lead me and
[45:12] God leads by his word by revelation of
[45:16] his word amen and it's personal right
[45:18] but if we're not asking him if we're not
[45:21] dying out to what we think is right and
[45:23] what we know is good instead of calling
[45:26] upon God daily it can never be
[45:29] overemphasized the need for us to call
[45:31] upon God for Revelation amen but you
[45:34] know it's just like as brother Tommy and
[45:36] I was fellowshipping you know people in
[45:38] natural War when they're going to battle
[45:41] all of a sudden they're they got the
[45:43] orders they their their commanding
[45:44] officers told the troop hey y'all need
[45:47] to go out and flank out down the valley
[45:50] the enemy is going to come and whatever
[45:51] the different orders are but all of a
[45:53] sudden when it came down came down to
[45:55] the boots on the ground and now the
[45:57] enemy's on attack and now he's There's
[45:59] real live ammunition coming at you
[46:02] they're firing away this is no longer
[46:04] just training now you got to take the
[46:06] training and put it into action amen
[46:09] that's what God wants us to do he wants
[46:10] us to put our faith in action when we're
[46:13] going out though sometimes when we see
[46:15] the Warfare and and all of a sudden we
[46:17] get fatigued and all of a sudden things
[46:19] start draining us and we lose focus amen
[46:22] but that's what I want to point to
[46:24] tonight is we want to keep the spirit of
[46:26] Revival alive in us daily it doesn't
[46:29] matter about the disappointments or
[46:31] yesterday or the fear of tomorrow I have
[46:33] a promise of today God's promised me
[46:36] spiritual food in due season I have an
[46:39] expectation that God is here the very
[46:42] trial the very difficulty is because God
[46:44] wants to show me that he has power over
[46:47] this condition he wants to show me
[46:49] something in his word that'll Quicken
[46:52] and say that's me amen there's something
[46:55] within me that will overcome this thing
[46:58] that's what I want to look to and as
[47:00] brother Tommy and I just asked him the
[47:01] question I was like you know if you can
[47:03] ask anything and I I can't remember
[47:05] exactly how the question came out
[47:08] but oh my we had some wonderful
[47:11] Fellowship amen you get just thinking
[47:13] about God and how you want God to do
[47:15] something for somebody amen we just sat
[47:18] there and we just had a few words of uh
[47:20] fellowship and praying about some things
[47:23] in the word of God and all of a sudden
[47:25] it's like after some pray
[47:27] now we're under expectation we're on the
[47:29] job we're doing our job and you know
[47:31] what what's very powerful is as as
[47:35] brother Jonathan prayed he God wants to
[47:38] have people that are declaring
[47:40] manifestly the spirit of Truth amen it's
[47:43] not just uh H uh to to to to hear the
[47:47] word only but to be doers and and when
[47:49] you're a doer now you're worshiping like
[47:52] your very life the way that you treat
[47:55] people on the job the way that you do
[47:58] the
[47:59] details you know the way that you uphold
[48:01] integrity and honesty these are the kind
[48:04] of things that bring worship to God you
[48:06] are reflecting a kingdom of
[48:08] righteousness and all of a sudden as we
[48:10] were working this the the the oversight
[48:13] man he was just he was blown away he was
[48:16] just like you know I don't have to tell
[48:18] him you know to clean up I don't have to
[48:20] tell them you know like things were used
[48:23] with a level and a plum and things were
[48:25] being anchored and he was just like he
[48:27] was just standing back just and that's
[48:29] what I believe that people are doing
[48:31] your neighbors are doing they're
[48:32] standing back and said you know what
[48:34] there's something about that sister
[48:36] there's something about my neighbor
[48:37] there's something about my coworker man
[48:40] man there's something I just I want to
[48:42] be like them they can't put their finger
[48:44] on it but there's a bubble of Fountain
[48:47] that's bubbling up inside the believer
[48:49] amen we don't want to quench that with
[48:52] desires of the world Amen but I going
[48:55] say God I want to draw from you today
[48:57] fresh Mana Revelation not just for
[49:00] myself because I'm already sealed in the
[49:03] enemy he he can torment my flesh but my
[49:06] soul is saved and I want to see God do
[49:09] it for somebody else I want to see it do
[49:11] it for those loved ones even even to
[49:14] come to a place where my heart's in a
[49:16] condition that someone would want to
[49:17] kill me I would still want to see them
[49:20] Father let it not be forgive them they
[49:23] know not what they do I want the the
[49:25] kind of life that can look and and look
[49:28] past the person and see there's a soul
[49:31] there in bondage I want to say God use
[49:35] these eyes to see what I need to see I
[49:37] want to see like you see you said in
[49:40] your word that we would be your very
[49:43] expression at the end time that's the
[49:45] very reason you died that you can
[49:48] resurrect in a body amen
[49:51] my that's what we want we must never let
[49:55] the Revival die within us it's not a
[49:59] whole camp meeting it's not special
[50:01] meetings it's not Church practices it's
[50:04] a Revival with you and God Amen you
[50:07] drawing from the very Fountain of God
[50:10] say this is my God he's healed me oh my
[50:15] to think where I was God what you did
[50:17] for me I was I was in bondage I couldn't
[50:20] help myself I tried I tried I tried to
[50:23] use different things to make this satisf
[50:26] ction but nothing satisfied
[50:29] amen till one day Glory one day I met
[50:34] the king I met the master amen my where
[50:38] are we at praise the Lord you know it's
[50:41] just one of those things when you think
[50:42] about Fellowship you know God he said
[50:45] that he's provided a way for us to
[50:47] Fellowship you know and one of the
[50:49] things I think we
[50:51] get at least I do when I think about
[50:55] scriptures like be ye perfect even as
[50:57] your father which in heaven I think that
[50:59] thing kind of wors against our mind like
[51:02] sometimes and it echoes back and says
[51:04] you perfect you'll never be perfect but
[51:08] I want to say this tonight it just
[51:10] struck me it's it's a perfect Fellowship
[51:13] that God's provided for us that we can
[51:16] walk and be in an Eden condition of
[51:18] Heart by Rap by rapturing faith we can
[51:21] come to a place this is the hour of
[51:24] rapturing Faith like we want want to be
[51:26] under this expectation we want the
[51:29] atmosphere of that kind of Faith to be
[51:31] in our heart and mind and we're looking
[51:34] for it it's around the corner it's here
[51:37] tonight
[51:39] amen and when you think about in job I
[51:43] think about the the example of job in
[51:46] Job chapter 1 and verse 1-5 I I just
[51:50] want to talk a little bit about job you
[51:52] know job God had a a great confidence in
[51:57] job and we know the story how you know
[52:00] the devil was going to and fro and he
[52:02] was looking around and you know there
[52:05] was a conference between God and Satan
[52:08] and he says well have you have you uh
[52:11] seen my servant job oh my think about it
[52:15] but maybe we'll turn there in Job
[52:17] chapter
[52:19] 1 Job chapter 1 I believe there's a
[52:23] principle within the word of God that we
[52:25] can have an understanding about what God
[52:28] wants God wants to have a perfect
[52:30] fellowship with us do you believe that
[52:33] God desires to have perfect fellowship
[52:36] with you
[52:37] amen but job is believed to be one of
[52:41] the oldest books and we believe that job
[52:44] was a prophet of God Amen but it says
[52:47] this there was a man in the land of us
[52:50] where whose name was job and that man
[52:55] was perfect and a
[52:57] right and one that feared God and assu
[53:01] Evil My think about that just let that
[53:05] sit for a moment because that's the
[53:07] potentials of a Believer amen that's you
[53:11] that's
[53:13] me you you talk about a perfect
[53:15] Fellowship that he had he was upright
[53:19] one that feared God and this word assu
[53:22] means that he he he he uh
[53:26] he he avoided it he abstained from Evil
[53:31] you know it was a deliberate thing it
[53:34] wasn't like uh no it was deliberate like
[53:37] that I'm going this way wow that's right
[53:40] you know and that's the kind of thing
[53:42] that God wants from
[53:43] us and so as we go through we see there
[53:46] and there was born unto him seven sons
[53:49] and three daughters and his substance
[53:51] also was 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels
[53:55] and 500 y of oxen and 500 she asses and
[53:59] a very great household so that this man
[54:03] was the greatest of all the men of the
[54:06] East and his sons went out and feast in
[54:09] their houses everyone his his day and
[54:13] sent and called for three sisters to eat
[54:16] and drink with them so it was so and it
[54:19] was so when the days of their feasting
[54:23] was gone about that job sent and
[54:27] Sanctified them and Rose up early in the
[54:29] morning and burn and offered burnt
[54:32] offerings according to the number of all
[54:36] of them for job said it may be that my
[54:40] sons have sinned and cursed God in their
[54:43] heart thus did job continually amen oh
[54:47] my you talk about a worship you talk
[54:50] about a day he did it
[54:52] continually he offered God's provided
[54:55] way when the Tex come job could stand
[54:58] there and say I know my redeemer liveth
[55:01] cuz he kept he had perfect fellowship
[55:04] with God because God required death of
[55:08] an innocent one
[55:11] amen and he didn't just do it one time
[55:14] he did it continually
[55:17] amen
[55:18] [Music]
[55:19] my you know we want to do that which is
[55:22] pleasing to the Lord and God you know
[55:25] when he gives us
[55:27] Revelation he wants us to act on it
[55:34] [Music]
[55:36] amen you know this Fellowship that God
[55:39] desires is something that you know we
[55:42] what we want to get in tune with amen we
[55:44] want to connect with we want to unite
[55:46] our hearts with the will of God Amen and
[55:50] the only way we can know exactly what it
[55:53] is I can't go and tell you all of that
[55:56] you have to go before the Lord you know
[56:00] we can't we can't run from the presence
[56:03] of the Lord and give our responsibility
[56:05] off to somebody else or some other
[56:07] system or some other Church affiliation
[56:10] this is God pressing upon you a burden
[56:14] to go and know him
[56:19] amen excuse
[56:22] me
[56:24] amen I was thinking about the this quote
[56:26] in Hebrews chapter
[56:29] 7 but he says this in 1957 on um
[56:34] September 15th he said God can only work
[56:39] through
[56:40] Perfection because he's perfect blessed
[56:44] be his name he has to be a perfect
[56:48] channel that God works through cuz he
[56:51] can do nothing else but work through
[56:55] Perfection he he can't he can't stain
[56:58] himself in any
[57:00] way and then that's why Jesus came to
[57:04] take away our sin that we might be
[57:08] perfect that God could work through his
[57:11] church there's where the secret lies
[57:14] yeah amen so when you think about what
[57:17] God wants God wants to have this perfect
[57:19] fellowship and think about this God
[57:22] working through Perfection it's not
[57:25] perfection in yourself
[57:27] amen it's God working through Perfection
[57:30] because he's perfect amen that's the
[57:32] channel he works through the
[57:35] church my and that just directly takes
[57:38] us over to Ephesians chapter 2 when we
[57:41] think about the great Ephesians Church
[57:45] they were mature they were in a
[57:47] condition where God actually could have
[57:49] fellowship with them it wasn't just like
[57:52] the Corinthians where he was just trying
[57:53] to straighten them out with all these
[57:55] carnal things and these habits and
[57:57] different things but the Ephesian Church
[58:00] were
[58:00] mature and God could have a certain
[58:03] specific Fellowship because they were
[58:05] mature and can take deeper things
[58:08] amen but he says this in verse four he
[58:11] says but God who is rich in Mercy for
[58:15] his great love wherewith he loved
[58:18] us amen
[58:21] wow that's amazing that by his grace
[58:25] year SA Sav through faith and not of
[58:28] yourself it is a gift of God not of
[58:31] Works lest any man should boast and
[58:33] there in verse 10 it says for we are his
[58:36] workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto
[58:40] good works which God ha for ordained
[58:43] that we should walk in them you know
[58:45] this perfect fellowship if you think
[58:47] about a work of god is perfect the the
[58:51] psalm says God's ways are perfect his
[58:54] works are perfect and if we can take
[58:57] these thoughts out of our mind and fight
[59:00] against those carnal thoughts like oh
[59:02] I'm not perfect and but we're in
[59:04] fellowship with the perfect one who was
[59:06] the perfect sacrifice who sent a perfect
[59:09] message with a perfect word that gives
[59:12] perfect Faith amen it's the perfect
[59:15] sacrifice that's what we're in
[59:17] fellowship with tonight amen for we are
[59:19] his
[59:21] workmanship you're his workmanship why
[59:23] to think that you were sin you you were
[59:26] the whole cause why he came so that he
[59:29] can pay the price that you can become
[59:31] his righteousness
[59:33] my praise the Lord that's what love did
[59:36] for us for his great love wherewith he
[59:39] loved us oh
[59:41] my that should set the believer's heart
[59:43] a flame
[59:45] amen verse 13 it says this but now in
[59:48] Christ
[59:50] Jesus you were sometimes far off are
[59:54] made nigh by the blood of Christ for he
[59:58] is our peace who have made both one and
[1:00:03] have broken down the middle wall of
[1:00:05] partition between us having abolished in
[1:00:08] his flesh the enity even the law of
[1:00:12] Commandments contain ordinances for to
[1:00:16] make in himself of Twain one new man and
[1:00:21] making peace that he might reconcile
[1:00:25] both unto to God in one body by the
[1:00:28] cross having slain the enity thereby oh
[1:00:33] my think about it what a fellowship that
[1:00:35] God he's done this marvelous work for us
[1:00:38] that he's taken the middle wall P down
[1:00:42] wow praise God what a work of
[1:00:45] righteousness amen verse 19 it says this
[1:00:48] for now now therefore ye are no more
[1:00:52] strangers or foreigners but fellow
[1:00:54] citizens with the Saints and of the
[1:00:57] household of God Amen and are built upon
[1:01:00] the foundation of the Apostles and
[1:01:03] Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the
[1:01:07] Cornerstone amen praise the Lord whoa I
[1:01:12] thought well if we're having Fellowship
[1:01:15] God works through this channel of
[1:01:18] perfection amen that's through Christ
[1:01:20] and when you're born again by the spirit
[1:01:23] of Christ you're in Christ amen and I
[1:01:26] thank God that he doesn't look at my
[1:01:27] flesh but he looks at my representation
[1:01:31] amen praise the
[1:01:35] Lord
[1:01:38] my you know it's sometimes you know as
[1:01:42] you go through life and you experience
[1:01:44] different things and work and things
[1:01:46] like that you realize that you know
[1:01:49] there's messes and and we were the ones
[1:01:50] that created them you I don't know about
[1:01:53] you but we we have this Humanity it's
[1:01:55] not perfect and we have to have
[1:01:57] fellowship with God sometimes say hey I
[1:01:59] made a mistake you know like our Pastor
[1:02:01] said you mark that place you got to go
[1:02:04] back and you with sincerity in my heart
[1:02:06] that the enemy got me off sides on that
[1:02:08] and man I slipped up but you forgive me
[1:02:10] on that cuz that's not like Christ but
[1:02:13] but I have a blood of Jesus Christ that
[1:02:17] we can have Fellowship that I can be
[1:02:18] cleansed and I don't have condemnation
[1:02:20] in my heart because God doesn't reckon
[1:02:23] that to me but he what he reckons is
[1:02:25] that seed that's on the inside amen that
[1:02:27] I will do the will of God I will confess
[1:02:30] my wrongs amen thanks be to God that
[1:02:33] there's something pulsating on the
[1:02:35] inside that will move despite the regret
[1:02:38] I might have but oh I got Victory amen
[1:02:42] you know but Believers are creators we
[1:02:45] have atmospheres you know how it is
[1:02:47] sometimes you just love to get in
[1:02:48] fellowship with certain ones and you're
[1:02:50] just like you just go around them and
[1:02:51] you're like man I just love to be around
[1:02:55] that person because why just feel the
[1:02:57] warmth of the presence of the Lord amen
[1:03:00] isn't that wonderful that you can be
[1:03:02] that hand
[1:03:04] extended brother Braham says this in a
[1:03:06] hidden life in Christ he said
[1:03:08] atmosphere God that's right and this is
[1:03:11] in 51 he says there's something about it
[1:03:14] fear is a horrible thing did you ever
[1:03:16] notice a dog the home I'm staying in had
[1:03:19] a big Shepherd and I walked into the
[1:03:21] yard today and here comes that big
[1:03:23] Shepherd through every everybody
[1:03:26] cuz I loved him when he was in uh he
[1:03:29] says
[1:03:31] that I can't pronounce that word very
[1:03:33] good but over in
[1:03:36] Germany as soon as I met the little
[1:03:39] doggy wouldn't make up with any with
[1:03:41] nobody but here he come that little
[1:03:42] Doxon jumped on me I loved him and he
[1:03:46] knew it they knew it and if you're
[1:03:49] really in your heart love people they
[1:03:52] know
[1:03:52] it my I mean this is a reality Saints
[1:03:58] you know when you really from your heart
[1:03:59] love somebody they know it I mean don't
[1:04:02] be deceived and think that you know like
[1:04:06] transparency but but they can really
[1:04:09] tell and he says you can't fool people
[1:04:11] they're not dumb you can make like you
[1:04:14] do they can tell you that they can they
[1:04:18] can tell you're only putting on and
[1:04:21] Satan can tell when you're putting
[1:04:23] on but he knows when it's real
[1:04:27] I like that
[1:04:29] part and the only way you might
[1:04:32] impersonate it you might make a whole
[1:04:34] lot of look like but you'll never get
[1:04:37] the job done until you come into
[1:04:40] Christ oh my that's perfect consecrated
[1:04:44] God Godly love sold out Lock Stock and
[1:04:49] Barrow come to Christ that's it friends
[1:04:52] that's true oh my but it's so hard to do
[1:04:55] amen
[1:04:56] many times because we have this mindset
[1:05:01] well excuse me you know I got to get I
[1:05:05] got to get this thing in order I got to
[1:05:06] get this thing in order first and I got
[1:05:09] I just got to be perfect before I come
[1:05:11] you know I mean if only I can get this
[1:05:14] thing right and this thing right then
[1:05:15] I'll come and have Fellowship that's not
[1:05:18] the way God wants it he wants to have
[1:05:20] perfect fellowship with what he's done
[1:05:23] and how he's doing it in our lives amen
[1:05:26] oh
[1:05:27] my
[1:05:28] my again in EP in Ephesians now we'll
[1:05:32] jump to chapter 3 he says and this is in
[1:05:35] verse three he says how be it that by
[1:05:37] Revelation he made known unto me the
[1:05:40] mystery oh my think of that you know
[1:05:45] it's not by intellectualism that we
[1:05:47] really can have the Life of Christ
[1:05:50] flowing amen it has to be personal it
[1:05:53] has to be God quickening it to us and
[1:05:56] that's the job of the holy spirit
[1:05:59] amen he says whereby when when you read
[1:06:02] you may understand my knowledge in the
[1:06:04] mystery of Christ unto me who am the
[1:06:07] least of all the saints even this Grace
[1:06:10] given that I should preach among the
[1:06:12] Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of
[1:06:15] Christ and to make known all men to make
[1:06:20] known all men see what is the Fellowship
[1:06:24] of the mystery which from the beginning
[1:06:27] of the world have been hid in God who
[1:06:30] created All Things by Jesus
[1:06:33] Christ amen and I just boy I tell you it
[1:06:37] wraps up right there in 15 and 17 or 15
[1:06:40] through 17 but he says this in whom all
[1:06:43] the whole family in Heaven and Earth is
[1:06:45] named that we might Grant you according
[1:06:48] to the riches of his glory to be
[1:06:50] strengthened with might by his spirit in
[1:06:54] the Inner Man that Christ May dwell in
[1:06:57] your hearts by faith that ye being
[1:07:00] rooted and grounded in love may be able
[1:07:03] to comprehend with All Saints what is
[1:07:05] the breadth length and depth and height
[1:07:08] and to know the love of Christ which
[1:07:11] path knowledge that you might be filled
[1:07:16] with help me finish
[1:07:19] that all of the fullness of God oh my
[1:07:25] like like that's what I want God to
[1:07:27] reveal to me like you like do you wake
[1:07:31] up do I wake up in the morning and say
[1:07:34] God I'm praying that you would reveal to
[1:07:37] me the love of Christ that all of the
[1:07:40] fullness of God is within me then you're
[1:07:44] more than a match to every obstacle that
[1:07:46] comes your way if this Love Of Christ
[1:07:49] that he's speaking of there that you're
[1:07:52] rooted and grounded in love
[1:07:55] oh my you think about that scripture how
[1:07:59] perfect love cast out fear that's the
[1:08:02] kind of Christian we want to be we want
[1:08:03] to walk in with our shoulders back I'm a
[1:08:06] child of the king you know he's a king
[1:08:09] conqueror love conquered sin not just
[1:08:13] sin of the world but sin in me amen that
[1:08:16] I can be free from my past that's one of
[1:08:19] the greatest things that I've ever known
[1:08:21] is freedom from the sin of my life amen
[1:08:25] to be to worship Him and serve him with
[1:08:28] no
[1:08:29] shackles praise the
[1:08:31] Lord oh
[1:08:35] my you
[1:08:37] know sometimes in our approach to God or
[1:08:41] to
[1:08:42] situations you know sometimes we need
[1:08:44] Revelation to hit us because we've been
[1:08:47] approaching it in a certain way for a
[1:08:48] long time and that's part of the
[1:08:50] fellowship right God deals with us as
[1:08:52] sons and we're in the adoption age and
[1:08:55] it's it's not always that we figure
[1:08:56] things out on our own right how many of
[1:08:58] us figured this out on our own not me
[1:09:01] not me I I got a lot of lumps on my head
[1:09:05] but praise the Lord you know I like how
[1:09:08] that the transparency of our Prophet the
[1:09:11] transparencies of the servants that's
[1:09:12] gone before that they were willing to
[1:09:15] stand there and not just tell the good
[1:09:18] but tell the bad you know and I think
[1:09:20] about this uh testimony that brother
[1:09:23] brandham gives in a message called it
[1:09:25] wasn't so from the beginning preached in
[1:09:27] 1960 but he
[1:09:29] says and this is in U paragraph 15 he
[1:09:32] says did you ever meet a people that you
[1:09:35] just love to be with you had that and
[1:09:38] why they created that atmosphere their
[1:09:41] life the way they lived and the things
[1:09:43] they talked about they love the love
[1:09:46] they have for you you've heard my
[1:09:48] message on the pum you know and on the
[1:09:50] bees trying to sting me and the bull
[1:09:52] trying to kill me you create an
[1:09:54] atmosphere atere and that atmosphere you
[1:09:57] have
[1:09:58] to you have to be in prayer for the sick
[1:10:02] see it's the same thing it's love that
[1:10:06] casts out evil spirits you know if if
[1:10:09] what we're Desiring in the fellowship
[1:10:11] with God to Perfection like we're
[1:10:13] wanting to have we know that this is the
[1:10:16] hour of the great capping of the love of
[1:10:19] God Amen and so it's my Earnest
[1:10:21] expectation that this atmosphere of the
[1:10:24] love of of Christ would be on display
[1:10:27] like I'm looking for it not that I want
[1:10:29] to see a bull charging me or some bees
[1:10:31] swarming up on me but in the spiritual
[1:10:34] you know the very Love Of Christ like I
[1:10:37] can have an atmosphere that Christ can
[1:10:39] move upon my heart and I can speak
[1:10:41] something and I can say whatever you
[1:10:43] want just ask it right now I want to be
[1:10:46] in that condition of heart that I know
[1:10:48] it's not me speaking but I've been moved
[1:10:50] upon by the love of God Amen and so we
[1:10:53] think about this testimony there was a
[1:10:56] man named brother fander and this you
[1:10:59] know he was uh he was kind of a skeptic
[1:11:02] and he was kind of hearing about the
[1:11:03] meetings and he was hanging around with
[1:11:06] some of the people that were
[1:11:07] missionaries to some Indians and he all
[1:11:09] of the sudden was coaching somebody hey
[1:11:11] why don't you go over to the meetings
[1:11:12] and there was some sick Indians but he
[1:11:13] was like you know he was kind of
[1:11:15] standing back a little bit watching and
[1:11:17] all of a sudden he got discerned and all
[1:11:20] of a sudden he's like wait a minute yeah
[1:11:21] I did bring them over the prophet's
[1:11:24] dealing with him now and he's like yeah
[1:11:26] you brought this person and they had TB
[1:11:28] and all this and all of a sudden my he
[1:11:30] gave his heart to the Lord you know the
[1:11:32] Lord dealt with him here he was kind of
[1:11:35] kind of scoffing maybe like zakus you
[1:11:37] know hiding up in the tree or something
[1:11:39] but all of a sudden God he dealt with
[1:11:41] him and this is picking up in um
[1:11:45] paragraph I believe 20 but he said
[1:11:47] brother frandler one of them sitting
[1:11:50] back there studying to be in Ministry he
[1:11:51] says you suffer with TB right and the
[1:11:54] man that brought you a little fellow
[1:11:57] here by a certain name said he's
[1:11:59] suspicious that's done it he become a
[1:12:02] servant of the Lord not long ago we were
[1:12:06] going across the country and he said
[1:12:08] unto me he said brother brandom you know
[1:12:11] my wife don't believe this and said
[1:12:14] every night when I get when I go to
[1:12:16] church and come home and says oh she
[1:12:18] just starts balling me out as soon as I
[1:12:21] hit the
[1:12:22] door and I get her by the hand that
[1:12:26] she's little and I hold her and I try to
[1:12:28] cast that devil out as hard as I can
[1:12:31] said reminds me of the message he says I
[1:12:34] try to cast out that devil and say devil
[1:12:36] you come out of my wife devil you can't
[1:12:39] come to my wife honey you're possessed
[1:12:41] with the devil come out of her devil
[1:12:45] said oh that's fine brother fander but
[1:12:47] you go about it all wrong that's the
[1:12:50] wrong
[1:12:51] way my goodness he said well how do you
[1:12:56] do it he says well when you come home
[1:12:59] you buy her a box of candies and you
[1:13:01] give it to her you put it in the door
[1:13:03] and you put her arms around her they
[1:13:05] shall cast out Devils love cast out fear
[1:13:09] doesn't it friend love that's what the
[1:13:12] world is dying for that's one of the
[1:13:14] greatest things that we're leaving out
[1:13:16] of our Pentecostal blessings too much is
[1:13:19] the love that's mixed together the
[1:13:21] mortar that makes the gifts and all the
[1:13:24] things of God perfectly is the love one
[1:13:28] of the other this will men all men know
[1:13:31] that you are my disciples amen praise
[1:13:34] God this is the kind of Fellowship that
[1:13:36] God can you know just like a a real
[1:13:39] father or a real mother they they
[1:13:41] correct their children there's certain
[1:13:43] attitudes that we've accepted that's not
[1:13:46] perfect fellowship with God but oh my I
[1:13:49] want to get and I say God deal with my
[1:13:51] heart whatever it takes try me search me
[1:13:54] if there there be any wicked way I don't
[1:13:56] want to see myself I want to see Jesus
[1:13:58] Christ manifested once again he promised
[1:14:01] it we don't want to lower our standards
[1:14:04] you know we don't want to live below our
[1:14:06] privileges for so long the hour has
[1:14:11] come
[1:14:13] amen whoa that's Love's approach I like
[1:14:16] that oh
[1:14:19] my w yeah you know this is a very
[1:14:23] popular
[1:14:25] uh one that we repeat very much because
[1:14:27] it's so important you know it can never
[1:14:29] be overemphasized the need for us to
[1:14:31] call upon God for Revelation but out of
[1:14:33] the exposition of the church ages in Jes
[1:14:36] the revelation of Jesus Christ is how we
[1:14:39] need to hear from God and lay ourselves
[1:14:42] open become yielded to the spirit and
[1:14:46] hear and know amen and that's what the
[1:14:49] burden was and the testimony the
[1:14:51] fellowship that brother Tommy and I had
[1:14:53] he was like God I I believe we believe
[1:14:56] we'll bind together we want to see you
[1:14:59] move if there's something some need or
[1:15:01] some situation that we're not privy to
[1:15:04] but we want to be those willing
[1:15:07] vessels and so as we were working this
[1:15:09] man it was on to brother Tommy's heart
[1:15:11] he just he just started talking to him
[1:15:13] about the Lord you know and it was it
[1:15:15] was marvelous and and at the end of it I
[1:15:18] mean he he was really hungry you can
[1:15:20] tell that the Lord touched his heart and
[1:15:22] we were about to leave and I said you
[1:15:24] know
[1:15:25] I said oh um you know if if if uh you
[1:15:30] know if you want prayer I mean do you
[1:15:31] have a need and oh it was just blessed
[1:15:34] you know you know how the presence of
[1:15:35] the Lord could just leave a man totally
[1:15:38] just I mean with everything open it was
[1:15:41] a it was a joyful thing but you know
[1:15:43] that's the desire because as this quote
[1:15:46] goes it's the revelation of the will of
[1:15:48] God that gives you authority over the
[1:15:51] devil you know that's what God wants to
[1:15:53] give us because we live too much in the
[1:15:56] past we won't move and ask God for
[1:15:59] something because of the failures of
[1:16:01] yesterday like oh I didn't make my bill
[1:16:05] oh I ran over the curb I busted my we're
[1:16:08] always focusing on our imperfections but
[1:16:11] God he's given us a perfect word he's
[1:16:14] given us a perfect promise that if we
[1:16:16] would just go before him lay before him
[1:16:19] that he would give us something that
[1:16:21] would Prevail over the devil in our
[1:16:23] lives
[1:16:30] the perfect revelation of God overcomes
[1:16:33] the
[1:16:35] enemy that's what we want to ask God for
[1:16:38] I want to overcome the enemy God you
[1:16:41] have a perfect Revelation for me in this
[1:16:43] season I don't want to shrink back say I
[1:16:46] got I got a revelation yesterday I need
[1:16:49] a revelation right now God he wouldn't
[1:16:52] tell us and ask us to pray for
[1:16:56] Revelation and to continually pray
[1:16:59] because he wants to give us more and
[1:17:01] more but we get caught up I get caught
[1:17:03] up The Daily Grind the Warfare we forget
[1:17:07] we lose focus but oh my just like our
[1:17:09] pastor was saying we want to have a
[1:17:10] certain focus and discern the spirits
[1:17:13] that are influencing us that keep us
[1:17:15] from going to our knees and asking God
[1:17:17] for
[1:17:19] Revelation my
[1:17:27] you know and um we'll skip some
[1:17:31] cuz we're doing good we're doing good
[1:17:34] everybody feeling
[1:17:37] okay praise the lord it's
[1:17:41] Sunday in 1 John chap 2 in verse one it
[1:17:46] says my little children these things are
[1:17:49] right unto you that you sin not and if a
[1:17:51] man sin we have an advocate with the
[1:17:54] father Jesus Christ the
[1:17:56] righteous and he is the propitiation for
[1:17:59] our sins and not only for ours only but
[1:18:03] also the sin of the
[1:18:05] world and
[1:18:07] hereby we know that we
[1:18:09] know we know that we know
[1:18:13] him now there's there's a twetter word
[1:18:16] right there it's right behind it says
[1:18:21] if if if we keep his Commandments
[1:18:26] amen he that saith I know him and
[1:18:29] keepeth not his Commandments is a liar
[1:18:31] and the truth is not in him but
[1:18:34] whosoever keepeth his word in him verily
[1:18:39] is the love of God
[1:18:41] perfected
[1:18:42] my whereby we know that we are in him he
[1:18:48] that saith he abideth in him also so to
[1:18:53] walk is even as he
[1:18:56] walked my I just think about that
[1:18:58] wonderful scripture and you can put it
[1:19:00] up there it's in Corinthians chapter uh
[1:19:03] 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and um verse 21
[1:19:08] but you think about the work of God that
[1:19:10] God can take the bleach of the blood and
[1:19:14] your sin because red Sin and the red
[1:19:17] blood red through red is white and to
[1:19:20] think that your life if we can look at
[1:19:22] it say oh I'm not perfect but I'm not
[1:19:24] looking
[1:19:25] at my imperfections I'm looking at the
[1:19:27] work of Calvary I'm looking at what the
[1:19:30] power of the blood has transformed me
[1:19:33] amen made me what I was in the
[1:19:36] beginning see it says he that made
[1:19:40] him my I got to look that I love that
[1:19:45] this this is this is a perfect work of
[1:19:47] God Amen you think about it but it says
[1:19:50] this he ha made him to be sin for us who
[1:19:56] knew no sin that we might become the
[1:19:59] righteousness of God in him amen I love
[1:20:03] that so much you know and it just makes
[1:20:06] the Simplicity of God when someone would
[1:20:09] accept the work of Calvary how that
[1:20:11] transaction that Divine transaction I'm
[1:20:15] nothing I have all this sin I have all
[1:20:17] this
[1:20:18] unrighteousness but I'll accept the
[1:20:21] righteousness of the work of Calvary
[1:20:23] that unit me back to the perfect word of
[1:20:28] God
[1:20:32] Amen my I love that so much you know I
[1:20:37] just I want to encourage you with this
[1:20:40] thought and our Prophet spoke this and
[1:20:44] this is out of the message God's power
[1:20:46] of
[1:20:48] transformation and this is in paragraph
[1:20:51] 64 he says everything's under control
[1:20:55] to bring forth of its own kind now
[1:20:58] remember to
[1:20:59] bring when he put the seed in the Earth
[1:21:02] the seed can only come forth with the
[1:21:06] power of life within it to transform it
[1:21:10] from a seed to a plant or whatever it
[1:21:13] was his transforming power now God put
[1:21:17] the seed in there with the potentials
[1:21:20] that it would be what he said it would
[1:21:23] be and as long as it stays in the right
[1:21:27] category it would be exactly what God
[1:21:29] said it would
[1:21:31] be it had to be that way because he had
[1:21:36] made it that way and made a channel that
[1:21:39] anything would stay in his channel in
[1:21:42] the line of his
[1:21:44] word it will have to bring forth exactly
[1:21:47] like his word said it would would do it
[1:21:52] can't move from there it's Channel just
[1:21:55] exactly right so everything in the trust
[1:21:59] of his
[1:22:01] son that it would be that way then God
[1:22:04] said it is good so I'll just rest and
[1:22:07] each one of those seeds has the power in
[1:22:10] itself to be
[1:22:12] transformed itself into the species that
[1:22:15] I desire it to be that's what it must
[1:22:20] be because I have given every seed trans
[1:22:24] forming power to make in itself in its
[1:22:27] potentials now to make out of it
[1:22:31] exactly what I want it to be and God has
[1:22:35] never changed amen oh I think that word
[1:22:38] is perfect amen God planted that seed
[1:22:41] that can transform and all the power is
[1:22:44] within it so when we pray we're not
[1:22:46] praying to something outside we're
[1:22:48] praying to something on the inside it's
[1:22:51] God in you amen that's quickening the
[1:22:54] very Life of Christ we don't have to
[1:22:57] guess about it we know it's there it's
[1:23:00] the love of God that moves us to act
[1:23:02] upon his word by
[1:23:05] faith I you know you can't explain love
[1:23:08] it can't be scientifically proven but
[1:23:10] you can see people when they love
[1:23:12] they're moving they're walking they're
[1:23:14] doing they open the door for people that
[1:23:17] maybe are rude to them you
[1:23:19] know different things you know it's
[1:23:21] manifested in different ways but you can
[1:23:24] recognize
[1:23:27] it I was mentioning this to some of the
[1:23:30] brothers I had a a customer and the
[1:23:33] customer brother Matthew referred him to
[1:23:35] me he's done some tree work and I was
[1:23:37] going to do some restoration work for
[1:23:39] him and they you know want the customer
[1:23:41] was blind he used to be in the military
[1:23:43] and he was under explosives or something
[1:23:45] you know that was part of his job and he
[1:23:47] ended up catching blindness from his
[1:23:49] occupation and he had been in that
[1:23:52] condition I I would guess presume more
[1:23:54] than 10 years and he was probably 60
[1:23:56] years old but anyway as I was speaking
[1:23:58] with him and his current companion you
[1:24:03] know she had that blue hair and you know
[1:24:05] she was just very outspoken and you know
[1:24:08] just you know just you know worldly type
[1:24:11] person right but I found something very
[1:24:13] real about him and so I was testifying
[1:24:16] to him he was like my back hurts and I
[1:24:18] began to tell him you know God he took
[1:24:20] me from a condition of Brokenness where
[1:24:22] I had no hope you know the doctors I
[1:24:25] went to many different doctors probably
[1:24:26] close to 20 doctors and some specialist
[1:24:29] they wanted to do this and do that do
[1:24:31] this and I just so I was testifying to
[1:24:33] him about the power of God and she's
[1:24:36] there and she I could see her kind of
[1:24:37] rubbing up on her chair just like oh man
[1:24:40] she was battling so much stuff just
[1:24:42] wanting to cut me right off and just
[1:24:44] silence me just in a moment but I was
[1:24:47] just in my heart burdened for this
[1:24:50] person in this condition and when you
[1:24:52] know the power of God to be a the
[1:24:54] potentials of of Deliverance and
[1:24:57] salvation you want to you want to share
[1:24:58] it with somebody you can't shut up you I
[1:25:01] can't hold this down this is a secret
[1:25:03] mystery that there's something in me
[1:25:05] that can move upon this situation and
[1:25:07] and things be different and so I was
[1:25:09] telling them I was like you know I was
[1:25:11] in that condition but God Heen rich in
[1:25:13] Mercy I I didn't know he loved me I
[1:25:15] didn't know he paid the price for me I
[1:25:17] didn't know he bore strides but I
[1:25:19] accepted it and I think she had enough
[1:25:21] she's just straight up just said I'm
[1:25:24] agnostic I don't believe in God and she
[1:25:26] just kind of started letting me have it
[1:25:28] I said you know and so I kind of slowed
[1:25:32] down a little bit and just kind of let
[1:25:33] her say her thing you know I was in her
[1:25:35] house you know and I I don't know if he
[1:25:38] ever knew what she looked like before he
[1:25:39] met her you know and I was just kind of
[1:25:42] you
[1:25:43] know I was
[1:25:46] just you know
[1:25:50] but I I was just sitting there kind of
[1:25:53] waiting for the Lord like I'm just going
[1:25:54] to keep silent right now and just see
[1:25:56] what the Lord has and all the sudden he
[1:25:59] said something he said you
[1:26:01] know even even blindness recognize
[1:26:05] kindness something to that effect and I
[1:26:08] did I realize you know a lot of times if
[1:26:10] you'll take your stand for God God will
[1:26:12] stand for you even in the midst of your
[1:26:15] enemy amen and I got to thinking how
[1:26:18] profound was that that I was willing to
[1:26:20] just go out there and testify and then
[1:26:22] they get the tongue lashing and feel all
[1:26:25] of that weirdness but then God come and
[1:26:27] speak back to my heart through this man
[1:26:30] who I had a burden but the love of God
[1:26:32] bounced back to me and it's now speaking
[1:26:34] a greater
[1:26:35] illumination wow even blindness
[1:26:39] recognize kindness that's the Christian
[1:26:42] walk amen there we're walking in a world
[1:26:44] that's blind miserable naked and don't
[1:26:47] know it but they recognize the love of
[1:26:51] God Amen that's what we want to be
[1:26:53] soldiers of the the cross we don't want
[1:26:55] to let down and let go we want to give
[1:26:58] our heart to the Lord that he can oh God
[1:27:00] even in the midst of all this chaos
[1:27:02] there's a stabilizer it's the bride of
[1:27:05] Christ under their
[1:27:06] messenger amen You're the Only Hope
[1:27:10] left
[1:27:19] my you know there's such a a dynamic
[1:27:25] Revelation in this hour and God wants to
[1:27:28] make known by Fellowship amen you know
[1:27:31] it was God in the G The Garden of
[1:27:35] gethe you know in in things that are to
[1:27:38] be brother Bram talked about when Jesus
[1:27:40] was there praying and he was praying in
[1:27:44] such earnestness if this cup could pass
[1:27:48] if this cup could pass and you know it
[1:27:50] was at that time that he saw you in your
[1:27:53] condition in your suffering and you're
[1:27:56] struggling but he knew that if that cup
[1:27:59] would pass and he wouldn't partake of
[1:28:00] that cup that you could not be well you
[1:28:02] could not be saved you could not become
[1:28:05] the son or daughter that he's called you
[1:28:08] to be amen so he just stayed there a
[1:28:11] little longer he said not my will but
[1:28:14] thine be done and the one thing that God
[1:28:18] when he was there asking the father the
[1:28:21] one thing he
[1:28:22] prayed he prayed for your your
[1:28:25] companionship he prayed for your
[1:28:27] fellowship God wanted you to know him in
[1:28:31] his attributes as a savior as a Healer
[1:28:35] what a
[1:28:36] fellowship that God wants to have this
[1:28:39] kind of communion and fellowship with
[1:28:41] you and I amen isn't that
[1:28:44] wonderful I think it's marvelous why
[1:28:47] don't we read that in John uh John 17
[1:28:52] you know let the words speak
[1:28:55] again amen oh what a marvelous things
[1:28:59] you know it is what it is but that's not
[1:29:00] what will be because what will be is
[1:29:03] what he prayed for you think about a
[1:29:05] powerful prayer if a man of God can come
[1:29:07] and pray for you but what about the King
[1:29:10] of Kings and the Lord of lords what kind
[1:29:12] of Fellowship can we have with his
[1:29:20] prayer in John 17 we'll just start right
[1:29:24] right there
[1:29:25] and let's let's start in verse 20 we'll
[1:29:28] just read through 26 but he says neither
[1:29:31] pray I for these
[1:29:33] alone but for them also which Shall
[1:29:37] Believe on me through their word that
[1:29:40] they all may be one as thou father are
[1:29:43] in me and I in thee and they also may be
[1:29:48] one in us that the world may believe
[1:29:51] that thou has sent me and the glor Glory
[1:29:55] which thou gavest me I give it
[1:30:00] them you're Eternal your Eternal
[1:30:03] thoughts of God made flesh today it's
[1:30:06] the glory of God to take your
[1:30:09] unrighteousness your filthy rags amen
[1:30:12] and make you white as snow what a glory
[1:30:15] of God to transform you from what you
[1:30:17] were to what he always desired
[1:30:20] amen says Thou that they may be one as
[1:30:25] thou father are in me and I in the in
[1:30:29] thee that they also may be one in us
[1:30:33] that the world may believe that thou has
[1:30:35] sent me and the
[1:30:38] glory which thou gave is me I give them
[1:30:42] that they may be one even as we are
[1:30:45] one I and them thou and me that they may
[1:30:51] be made perfect in one
[1:30:54] and that the world may know that thou
[1:30:57] has sent me and has loved them as thou
[1:31:01] has loved
[1:31:02] me father I will that they also whom
[1:31:07] thou givest
[1:31:08] me be with me where I
[1:31:13] am my what a fellowship that they may
[1:31:16] behold my glory which thou has given me
[1:31:20] for thou loved me before the foundation
[1:31:23] of the world world oh righteous father
[1:31:26] the world have not known thee but I Know
[1:31:29] Thee and these have known that thou has
[1:31:33] sent me and I have declared unto them
[1:31:36] thy name and will declare it that the
[1:31:39] love wherewith thou has loved me may be
[1:31:43] in them and I in them now you talk about
[1:31:48] a a prayer you talk about a perfect
[1:31:52] Fellowship when God answers your prayer
[1:31:55] and that reality is quickened that's
[1:31:57] what I want to see the word made flesh
[1:32:00] again we don't have to back up to the
[1:32:02] devil when we make a shortcoming we have
[1:32:05] perfect Fellowship because we confess
[1:32:08] our faults and the blood of Jesus
[1:32:10] cleanses us of all unrighteousness
[1:32:14] Amen brother Brandon would make this
[1:32:16] statement and we'll try to wind down as
[1:32:19] we now
[1:32:20] are at a good time but in this in the um
[1:32:25] God's power of
[1:32:26] transformation you know I think it's
[1:32:28] important to recognize what God's doing
[1:32:30] in our lives amen and this is a you know
[1:32:34] it's just to constantly be revived every
[1:32:37] day amen but he says this and this is in
[1:32:41] paragraph 235 he says Sons and Daughters
[1:32:44] was in the beginning in God in the
[1:32:49] beginning now
[1:32:52] look if you've got eternal life you say
[1:32:56] we believe it then you've got eternal
[1:32:59] life well there's only one form of
[1:33:01] eternal life and that's
[1:33:03] God that's the only thing there is
[1:33:08] eternal is God then if you got eternal
[1:33:12] life that life that is in
[1:33:16] you always
[1:33:19] was and you were in the loins of God
[1:33:23] before before there was ever a world
[1:33:26] even the word itself Jesus himself is
[1:33:30] called the word and in St John 1 in the
[1:33:34] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:33:36] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:33:39] Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:33:41] us then you were in Jesus
[1:33:45] loins and went to Calvary with him you
[1:33:49] died with him you were raised with him
[1:33:52] and today you're sitting in heaven
[1:33:53] heavly places in him filled with his
[1:33:57] Spirit Sons and Daughters of God died
[1:34:00] with him raised with him
[1:34:04] sure now then now now you can have
[1:34:09] fellowship with him see you couldn't
[1:34:11] back there because you were just a word
[1:34:14] in him a
[1:34:16] seed but now he has manifest
[1:34:20] you and now he wants to have Fellowship
[1:34:23] ship with him he wants you to have
[1:34:25] fellowship with him then he came down
[1:34:29] and was made flesh so that you can
[1:34:31] perfectly fellowship with you see the
[1:34:35] per perfect
[1:34:37] Fellowship oh my them deep mysteries of
[1:34:41] God how wonderful see God couldn't have
[1:34:44] Fellowship in the spirit so God became a
[1:34:47] man with us Jesus Christ was God himself
[1:34:52] manifested because he was the son
[1:34:55] because he was
[1:34:56] begotten but it was just a tabernacle
[1:34:59] for him to live in no man had seen God
[1:35:03] at any time but the only begotten of the
[1:35:05] father had declared him God built
[1:35:09] himself a house a body to live in come
[1:35:12] down so that you could touch him 1
[1:35:15] Timothy 3:16 Says without controversy
[1:35:19] great is the mystery of godliness for
[1:35:22] God was manifested in the flesh seen of
[1:35:24] angels believed on and received up into
[1:35:27] heaven you being
[1:35:30] flesh him being
[1:35:33] flesh then you can have fellowship with
[1:35:35] one another cuz he was a God's attribute
[1:35:39] of love God is love is that
[1:35:43] right and Jesus was God's attribute of
[1:35:48] love and when the attribute of love was
[1:35:52] displayed which
[1:35:54] that was God himself all the attributes
[1:35:57] that hung on him came to him all that
[1:36:00] the father was given me will come to me
[1:36:03] surely they were
[1:36:06] predestinated and if you wasn't there
[1:36:08] you won't be there that's all certainly
[1:36:11] now we can have
[1:36:14] Fellowship through the riches of his
[1:36:16] word in which you are a part of you were
[1:36:20] a part of the word cuz he was the word
[1:36:22] at the beginning
[1:36:24] and you're the word
[1:36:26] now
[1:36:28] see we'll jump ahead a little bit right
[1:36:31] there and just go he says listen there's
[1:36:35] one thing I can't do I can't brag on my
[1:36:37] ancestry no I come from awful
[1:36:41] mess
[1:36:43] amen my father was an Irishman my mother
[1:36:46] was an Indian Squall half Indian her
[1:36:48] mother was an Indian draw a penion now
[1:36:51] all of them drunk almost with them most
[1:36:55] of them died with their shoots shoes on
[1:36:58] fighting gunfighters and so forth I
[1:37:00] can't brag on nothing about that cuz all
[1:37:02] my an my cuz my ancestry and my family
[1:37:06] tree is terrible but brother there's one
[1:37:09] thing I can brag on I can brag on my
[1:37:12] Lord Jesus who redeemed me what a
[1:37:20] fellowship and he was
[1:37:23] and with his transforming power planted
[1:37:26] a seed by predestination and I saw it
[1:37:30] whose son am I now yeah I can brag on
[1:37:33] him I spent 33 years of my life bragging
[1:37:37] on him if he would spare me another 33
[1:37:41] years I try to brag on him more on him
[1:37:45] see I I can brag on my ancestry
[1:37:49] Hallelujah he that redeemed me and
[1:37:52] planted the seed of life in here and let
[1:37:56] me look upon this word and send down his
[1:38:00] spirit and said here it is speak this
[1:38:03] and it'll happen do this oh my can brag
[1:38:06] on him how did he do it through the
[1:38:09] washing of the Water by the word the
[1:38:13] Waters of
[1:38:14] Separation you know that's that's the
[1:38:16] fellowship that we have so I just want
[1:38:18] to encourage you tonight you know it's
[1:38:20] one of those things that I I think that
[1:38:22] we really must focus in because the
[1:38:24] enemy constantly trying to look at our
[1:38:26] Humanity the veil he wants you to look
[1:38:28] at mine and all my faults and failures
[1:38:30] he wants you to see all yours but that's
[1:38:32] not our fellowship we're not walking in
[1:38:35] carnality we're walking in the spirit in
[1:38:37] the spirit of love to be moved on that
[1:38:40] you know it's because this love of God
[1:38:42] is actually giving us confidence in what
[1:38:45] he
[1:38:46] said that's what Galatians 5 I believe
[1:38:48] it says it says faith worketh by love
[1:38:52] amen
[1:38:58] oh wondering Stars how will you wonder
[1:39:01] Methodist Baptists Outsiders whatever
[1:39:03] you might be wanding stars from church
[1:39:05] to church from pillar to place and from
[1:39:10] television to
[1:39:11] television world to World why don't you
[1:39:15] come
[1:39:16] over he longs to have fellowship with
[1:39:19] you he is longing for you he wants to
[1:39:23] trans form you by the renewing of your
[1:39:26] mind not to be a church or a
[1:39:29] denomination but to his word which you
[1:39:32] are a part of if you
[1:39:34] desire if the desire is in you amen we
[1:39:38] invite the musicians to come and you
[1:39:41] know I think you know it's so powerful
[1:39:44] to
[1:39:44] recognize you know that God put
[1:39:46] something in you and we were
[1:39:49] fellowshipping in the back but it's one
[1:39:51] of those things that if we didn't have a
[1:39:53] thirst for God it would be like we would
[1:39:55] be without a a beacon you know shell
[1:40:00] we'd be selling on life's journey
[1:40:01] without a without any light but thank
[1:40:05] God there's a hunger on the inside that
[1:40:07] says I can't be content with these
[1:40:09] messes I'm making I want to have a
[1:40:11] different kind of Fellowship you know I
[1:40:13] I want to have to where God takes
[1:40:15] preeminence in my life that I'm not just
[1:40:18] trying to fix up all these messes I want
[1:40:20] to have a different kind of Fellowship
[1:40:22] where I go to God and then God he
[1:40:24] illuminates the path go this way son and
[1:40:26] I want to have that sensitivity I want
[1:40:28] to have that Focus that God he will
[1:40:30] fulfill what he promised and lead us by
[1:40:33] Revelation that's the kind of Fellowship
[1:40:35] he desires that it would be I in you and
[1:40:37] you and me in that day what day that's
[1:40:40] this day what a privileged people we are
[1:40:43] to be able to be led by God and to be
[1:40:45] called the sons of God the scripture
[1:40:47] says what manner of love is this that we
[1:40:50] should be called the sons of God Amen
[1:40:53] God bless you you're a privileged people
[1:40:56] may we stand

[1:41:08] amen maybe as we prepared to turn the
[1:41:10] service over to brother Billy
[1:41:14] and maybe any closing thoughts and you
[1:41:17] know it's God's desire to speak to us
[1:41:21] and I don't want my mind to be so
[1:41:23] clouded with the cares of the world the
[1:41:26] burdens of life and the pressures that
[1:41:28] are all around us that we can't get so
[1:41:31] focused that you know if there is a
[1:41:33] value to be obtained the greatest value
[1:41:37] for a Believer is
[1:41:39] revelation like we the devil's putting
[1:41:42] carrots out here and carrots out there
[1:41:44] chase after this chased after this but
[1:41:47] oh my the only thing that brings
[1:41:49] satisfaction to the believer is when the
[1:41:51] will of God is made known and we act on
[1:41:54] it because that is the satisfying
[1:41:56] portion that is what God planted in our
[1:41:58] heart and we will not be satisfied until
[1:42:01] we know thus sayeth the Lord and act on
[1:42:04] it amen if you desire that God would
[1:42:08] move in this special way and God has
[1:42:10] spoke to you and you just want to Bow
[1:42:11] your heads and you want to ask God God

[1:46:51] something special from God we want to
[1:46:53] invite you to come and we know that

[1:48:33] forever more
[1:48:36] and the s
[1:48:44] name hallelujah amen I surely enjoy that
[1:48:48] amen that was refreshing Amen to just
[1:48:52] you know there's so many times we try to
[1:48:55] do things by government you know by
[1:48:58] trying to conform people do this and do
[1:49:01] that but my the greatest force of all is
[1:49:05] love that if somebody you could just
[1:49:07] transmit the love it will take care of
[1:49:10] all it's all the frustration will be
[1:49:12] taken out of it it will be with
[1:49:15] understanding you know that's what God
[1:49:17] wants us we didn't come to God because
[1:49:19] of uh some uh human Force forces or some
[1:49:24] Conformity because we thought oh if I
[1:49:26] don't do this no it was when the love
[1:49:29] was projected when we saw that what we
[1:49:32] were living at we were living below our
[1:49:34] privileges when we realized that we were
[1:49:35] in deepen we needed help we needed
[1:49:38] somebody to love us somebody to come and
[1:49:41] give his life for us it's when we
[1:49:43] realized that in the condition that we
[1:49:45] were in we needed help and he came to
[1:49:47] help us when his love became projected
[1:49:51] that's when we real realiz oh my I'm
[1:49:54] really living under my privilege and
[1:49:56] that's how we come to him and so if
[1:49:58] that's the way we came in how are we
[1:50:00] going to translate the other people how
[1:50:03] are we now going to turn around and use
[1:50:06] government forces or use some type of
[1:50:08] law or legalism to try to bring the
[1:50:11] others no it can only be done by the
[1:50:13] same
[1:50:14] love you know the prophet tells us that
[1:50:17] love is the greatest force that ever
[1:50:20] existed love the love that can forgive
[1:50:23] all things and love that can look over
[1:50:26] love that covers the multitude of sins
[1:50:28] and love that just looks and and it
[1:50:31] doesn't matter how deep in sin a person
[1:50:33] is love makes a way
[1:50:36] back I was thinking about this and I
[1:50:40] don't know if you can find it but bam
[1:50:42] says this in the message question and
[1:50:44] answer um paragraph uh preach on
[1:50:49] 54103 um I believe it's in the morning
[1:50:52] paragraph 57 he says this
[1:50:55] now I will admit that people study too
[1:50:59] much they try to go too far
[1:51:02] ahead and try to think too hard and
[1:51:07] sometimes have mental
[1:51:09] breakdown the things on the account of
[1:51:12] studying about the Lord you must quit
[1:51:17] that you don't have to do that the only
[1:51:21] thing you do the only thing you have to
[1:51:24] do is fall in love with
[1:51:29] them just think about that we say don't
[1:51:32] sin don't do
[1:51:36] that let the person fall in love with
[1:51:41] God show the love of God and let the
[1:51:44] person realize that God can do this for
[1:51:47] me that's right and that is the thing
[1:51:50] that would change anything else they
[1:51:53] would do will actually be a
[1:51:56] covering because it will be them doing
[1:51:58] it by fear by government them doing it
[1:52:02] because they don't want the results of
[1:52:04] what's going to produce and they're
[1:52:06] scared and by fear but when it's done by
[1:52:09] love it's the true
[1:52:11] conversion it says just the thing the
[1:52:15] thing the only thing you have to do is
[1:52:17] fall in love with him and just grow
[1:52:20] right on loving him amen it's not trying
[1:52:23] to push into something or make yourself
[1:52:25] something you are not just go ahead and
[1:52:29] let God use you in the way that he wants
[1:52:33] to do that he wants to just yield
[1:52:36] yourself commit yourself and walk on
[1:52:39] Happy singing rejoicing that's the
[1:52:44] way I thought you know that's the
[1:52:48] fellowship that God is looking for you
[1:52:51] know I love how bam I was telling
[1:52:53] brother Andrew you know many people will
[1:52:55] come and say oh butam you don't know
[1:52:58] your Bible it says well that might be
[1:53:00] true but I know the altar real
[1:53:06] well when you in love with the altar
[1:53:09] when you know the altar real well it
[1:53:12] straightens up everything it takes care
[1:53:15] of everything so if we can instead of
[1:53:18] this approach of by trying to uh uh uh
[1:53:22] with with go on with frustration and
[1:53:25] trying to how how come I can't do this
[1:53:27] how come I'm falling short here how come
[1:53:29] just fall in love with him let the
[1:53:32] fellowship be the fellowship by love he
[1:53:35] came down from heaven he he it wasn't by
[1:53:38] frustration no it was the love of God
[1:53:41] what greater love it is than a man will
[1:53:43] lay down his life for the
[1:53:45] other When Love Was projected everything
[1:53:49] else came on the scene and it was
[1:53:51] manifested and that's what God is asking
[1:53:53] of us tonight oh I tell you I I was so
[1:53:57] just touched within my heart I say God
[1:54:00] let me be motivated by love and not by
[1:54:03] frustration let me be motivated by love
[1:54:05] and not by my a human understanding let
[1:54:08] love be the motivation of everything
[1:54:11] that I do because with love I would win
[1:54:14] a lot more than I would with my own
[1:54:17] frustration
