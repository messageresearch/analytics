[Music] Lord just to praise you in all circumstances and situations Lord let the love of God could be shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit Lord that great Capstone father coming dead have Union with the bride lord it's it's something that I want to experience Lord I just ask you bless our little fellowship tonight be with us and be precious to us in your wonderful and precious name we pray amen and amen let's read a little scripture in this have a little time of Fellowship this scripture doesn't it ties in with what that we want to preach but it's uh it I wanted to read it because it's a good scripture is that good enough amen so let's read Matthew the 12th chapter and and we'll read the 35th 36 and 37th verse and I think this is a great um a great scripture of wisdom uh that was it's wonderful if we let it set into our hearts and and uh I'll just read it and so it says it says a good man out of the good Treasures of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil Treasures bringeth forth evil things but I say unto you that Every Idle Word that man shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment for by thy words Thou shalt be justified and by thy words Thou shalt be condemned father that you transfer this great wisdom into our hearts and Minds in the precious name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen you may be seated tonight I just have a very simple thought on my heart but first of all I'd like to uh I gotta look out here and see if I can find where's Amos and where are you guys hiding on the back row there that you back there anyway uh it's nice to have Adam and Amos and Sarah with us they've come all the way from uh the great state of uh Oklahoma I believe isn't that that piece of ground up there that Texas didn't want yes uh and uh so it's nice to have them with go ahead and stand what you guys stand for amen they have come down to put the spray the insulation in our church and they're they're doing it at a tremendous uh blessing to us and I really appreciated them and and what they're doing and how hard their work you know you can't always get everybody to agree with you but how many would agree with me that it's brutal outside amen well that's scriptural you know it says to let us be of one mind and one Accord amen so a little something I have on my heart and it kind of came to me today through an experience that I experience within my spirit and so we've been trying to get the building ready for inspection so we could put the insulation on in it and our our brothers and sisters they had come down they're here and so I called for the inspection and two of the inspectors showed up and uh you know one of them reminded me of Napoleon and the other one he reminded me of another dictator and and they just walked over and they just wrote us up and and all that they wanted and everything and and I noticed that in my in my heart that I started to get combative you know what I mean I didn't this I didn't agree with any of it and they wanted my plumber to do something and and so I called my plumber up and I said he wants us to do this and this he said yeah he said I'll be there in the morning he said I found out it's just better to do what they say then argue and so me and Andrew were sitting there today waiting for the inspector to come and so he ran and got us some sandwiches because we didn't want to leave the job and we were sitting there talking and and he wanted us to put some blocking on the wall and and that my fire inspector and guy says you don't need it but the scripture says to agree with your adversaries quickly as you'll pay so Andrew went ahead and put it up and and we were there and he come in and I I'm ready for a rodeo you know what I mean I I got my karate gloves on you know what I mean I'm practicing my my kick you know I'm ready to take this guy on you know and uh he comes in he starts looking around and and then uh you know I mean Andrew were talking and praying and then I got with the brothers and I said man we need to pray that God's merciful to us and we prayed and everything but when the inspector came in he started walking around and Andrew just simply went up and stuck out his hand and introduced himself he said hi I'm Andrew Bohannon he says oh hi I'm Glenn it it changed the whole atmosphere you you know what I mean and I I wanted to introduce myself as I'm David McGarry I hate inspectors you know what I mean that that was you know what I'm saying and you got to remember that that people they don't always know what they're thinking but they're very sensitive to atmosphere you know what I'm saying and and it's so important that that we learned to take control of our atmosphere now we've been we've been talking and ministering out of this message the thinking men's filter and and the prophet of God is telling us and and I believe that this that this message is extremely important because I believe it's the key to entering into the Capstone your thinking the way you think the way you approach the way that you take control of circumstances the way that you handle adversity is all becoming a tremendous uh attribute of the love of God being shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit then that's what the Capstone is it's the love of God it's it's not the uh it's not the object of our love it's his love being shed abroad in our hearts through our hearts because out of the abundance of your heart you bringeth forth good things you know what I mean and and so this great battle that is taking place in our mind and and we realize that it's always the enemy trying to get us to look at things and to think in a negative way and I say negative because he's a perverter and I I just thinking about it and talking about it and and fellowshipping to with the the brothers and my sons and and then they made mention they said he says can you imagine that in the hour that we live in right now this day that we live in right Solomon Gomorrah how many agree with that is Sodom and glamora it's it's as it was in the days of Noah they were married and given into marriage so if they you say well that that just doesn't mean divorce no it means total lack of commitment you know what I mean not the ability to stick with things and uh and to work things out to filter things to filter the things out instead of like in a marriage if two people get sideways instead of filtering it out it's just all combative and and uh just uh you know let's just run and leave and get somebody else and it's just no commitment no goal or or or no purpose but actually that Satan to get this world in a Sodom condition he had to get them in a mindset a way of thinking that no longer allows them to retain God in their thinking and he said no longer wishing to retain God in their thinking that gave them over to a reprobate mine and I know this is a touchy subject so I'm going to say it just the best I can but actually man has got to the place and they're teaching our children and teaching it in school and and starting to try to make it a Mainline way of thinking or an acceptable way of thinking that mankind has the choice of their gender another word that is not something that's in God's hand that gender is your choice and I think the amazing thing about that is that that kind of thinking can be sold you you understand that that it can be taught and sold that you have a right that you you choose if and and even to the place that they are leaving that section off of birth certificates in case the person decides to change their gender you are saying it's a total disregard for God altogether and and so if that thinking become the norm if you'll just stick with me for a couple minutes is then that creates a whole atmosphere that you live in and the atmosphere is uh just becomes totally against everything that that we stand for everything that's about us Eric everything that we uh look out and see it's just you it I don't know how to say it it's appalling it's unbelieving I like what what uh talking with George Smith today and the scripture came up and I thought it was good it's Galatians 1 and 9. he says as we have said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then that then that ye have received let him be accursed and uh to re receive another gospel and I'm just not talking about the gospel but I'm talking about the gospel that he preached and uh and so I think that's what we have a tendency to get away from we we tend to let the circumstances in the and the and and the things that are happening and the things that are being said in the news and all the events around us and everything if we're not careful uh brother Matthew is sharing this with me that those things start to change your identity you understand they they they slip you into the identity of being an opposer you understand and you take on the atmosphere and the spirit of opposition and I felt that when that if in uh in inspector came there I thought you know he'd give me a hard time before and they've been giving me a hard time from the beginning and Eric and the city's corrupt the mayor's corrupt the city council's corrupt everybody's corrupt but me I'm the only one that's right you know how you get and and all of a sudden you're living in an atmosphere as an opposer you you've just you you slip in to that realm of negativity you you slip into that realm of discouragement you slip into that realm of depression all these little things now become fruits on your Vine they become things that are affecting you things that are are taking over your heart and and so that's what we've been talking about that there's a gospel here now this is the original gospel this is the one that Moses wrote this is the one that has the words of Jesus this is the unchanging word of God it stood up for every age that the promises that are written in this book are true and he he's proved them over and over again that if someone will take these promises and they'll believe them and they'll hold to them and they will look with anticipation for the the day that they come to pass in their life they will see the word of God manifested So This Is Our Gospel this is what he taught what Paul brought he said If any man come into you and preach any other gospel even if an angel of the Lord comes and preach any other gospel than that which I preach count them accursed that's a powerful statement but so many times we think that that gospel is only a religious gospel or a Doctrine gospel or a church gospel but it's anything that creates an atmosphere that's not like him it's it's news gospel means good news right so if it's any news it's anything you receive it's anything that affects you that that doesn't and manifest what he preached then it's got to be filtered out you understand okay we're coming to the time of manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God where this bride and the bridegroom become one amen that his thoughts are our thoughts and so a scripture that we use so often is it found in the gospel of Saint John and and we I we know it so well in Saint John 14 12. and I just want to take a few minutes and and then we'll talk on this it seems like a another tremendous uh Wednesday night for ice cream so uh we'll go through this and then we'll go have ice cream for whoever wants because it's brutal outside yes I'm just gonna I wanna add if I could say if you would forgive me for using the word but to look at it maybe in a little different light just for a moment he says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whosoever shall ask in my whosoever asks in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if ye shall ask anything in my name I will do it if ye love me keep my commandment and as I was thinking about that I I realized that I've always held that scripture in a certain mindset that I've already drawn the conclusion when I hear that word The Works that I do shall you do also that it's always the miracle and it's always the raising the Dead the healing the blind and all those great uh tremendous uh vindications okay read that and I think well okay the if if I believe on him I will do those things but if I could say this there was the hidden work that he did it manifested in because so many other ways and so many other places and it wasn't always the work of the result of a casting out of devils or of a healing but it was the work that he did in handling the situation and taking control and and and that's what a real Christian becomes he becomes a Mystic to the world because he's the master of every circumstance and situation and I realize there are so many situations in circumstances that seem to be surrounding me lately that are trying to put my spirit in a negative light in a negative a negative uh combative uh uh nervous uh you know objective just that's not where I want to live it's not how I want to think I don't want to be afraid of anybody I don't want to hurt anybody I don't want to have negative thoughts of nobody I want to be able to come to the place where the love of God is shed abroad in my heart and and I I don't have to let what's being said or what's being done or or or what's being said about me what's being said to me uh uh how that I think things go or how I think they should go but just to be able to stand back and think you know when it all comes to it all he loves me oh yeah he's purchased me after this is the atmosphere that I I've got to learn to keep myself in because that's what he did our Master kept himself right he said I don't do anything unless the father shows me then I got to thinking about all the other encounters that Jesus had that weren't involving miracles and those were works too those were works you know the the woman at the well how he encountered her how he entreated her how he spoke to her so much that she was marveled oh this is strange that you would talk to me he said well get me a drink and and uh and she he didn't she wanted to know how he could get water for you know the conversation you know the story how he just talked to her how he opened the door for her Howie and treated her and how could he engaged her for the goodness of the Gospel how that out of the goodness of his heart came forth good things and he had the right approach and it had the right attitude he wasn't judgmental he he didn't reject her because she was a Samaritan or a commoner because she had lived in sin none of those things affected the atmosphere that he was going to live in and I I remember when Billy Paul was preaching here and and he made this comment about his father he said you could never tell by the way brother Branham treated people who his friends were or who his enemies were because he treated everybody the same another he had control of the atmosphere from within what was without wasn't affecting what was on the inside now to me that's the key to the baptism of the Holy Spirit it isn't the works that you can do because they can all be duplicated or can that rain falls on the just on the unjust but to be able to hold that Capstone love in your heart and not to be moved not to have your demeanor not to have your nature not to have your attitude not to have your feelings you know altered by what's taking place on the outside and I thought oh my Lord I've got to get control of that I'm letting this negative Gospel of the world to affect me and the minute I succumb to the effects of that gospel that perversion that's being spoken I'm identifying with that and now I'm manifesting the fruits of that negativity and it never was we're not called for that I'm not called for that he said my peace I give you I give you a peace that surpasses understanding a place that you can live in peace joy unspeakable am full of Glory and he preaches and he tells us so many things he said you know he said a Wiseman a house he said if the thiefs break in and they try to rob it if you don't guard it how important to know the nature of the spirit to know the nature of the Lord Jesus to know the atmosphere and the love that he had and to protect it The Works that I do I begin to think about gyrus and and how Jesus treated him when he came and his daughter had passed on and and he was going to go how how did he went the extra mile it wasn't all the fact that he raised her up that was a result of the spirit he had and the nature that he had and the work that he did by listening to him by having compassion on them you know what I mean and uh just the the holy his whole approach he didn't get all upset he didn't get into politics whether gias was this side or that side or who he preached for who he didn't preach for what synagogue he went to and and who we had over and and all that mumble jumble that goes on he didn't let any of that filter into his mind he looked at the circumstance here was a loving father who had a daughter that passed away what a work what a heart what is spirit you know the Centurion you know how he entreated the Centurion when the Centurion this is a Roman soldier if you want to put it another way this is the policeman right these the Romans occupied in force that's what he was he was the occupying force of the Roman Empire in the promised land that God had given the children of Israel and all that things didn't bother him a bit he didn't let it affect what he was and who he was and what his work was there and what he came into this world to do to shine the light of the gospel and the love of God and to make it manifest it he did that didn't hold him back another he didn't get into the politics of it what are they going to say you know if if he goes to this centurions house wow can you believe that though Guys these people are arresting our people and he's over there you know because Centurion said you know I'm a man of authority I say this I say that he spoke to him as a peer and you understand that Jesus I want you to see the work of Jesus maybe I've lost it but I'm telling you I've got such a hunger in my heart to be right do you have a the right Spirit to have the right atmosphere to have the right love I I just hate dragging around David McGarry he is such a burden but you've got to overcome you've got to overcome by changing your thinking you've got to overcome by starting to look at the word of God through a different light as something that can wash you not something you're trying to imitate that's our trouble we try to imitate we try to imitate we try to imitate without having the spirit that produced it in the first place that's right that's right and there's only one thing that that does that's the Holy Spirit that's the love of God shed abroad in Your Heart by the spirit and he dealt with that sanitarian with respect he said I'm a man of authority I say come and go and and he said all you have to do is speak the word man now Jesus didn't approach him oh you don't tell me what to do speak the word I I want to go there and lay hands on them I want to make a show no this is a conversation that's right this interior could approaches him Jesus respects him he respects his authority he respects his position and his approach and he says yes Mr Centurion that's true go find it as you desire that was the work the work wasn't only the daughter rising up or the servant excuse me the servant rising up but the fact that that man was there for a servant the fact that he was an authority Jesus engaged him and respected his request and humbled himself that to me the control that the Lord had over his spirit and over his thoughts I think ought to be a longing for every believer that once they enter into the rapture you understand we can't go on living in this negativity fighting and fussing with the world and with one another and being all torn down by by Sodom and Gomorrah we just got to overcome and that's what's given to us in lady osia to him that overcometh well I grant to sit with me in my father's Throne I never grant them he present tense to sit in the love and the peace and the joy and the comfort to be able to live in it all with the joy bills ringing oh not to have a negative thought to take control of the circumstance to be able to sit back and think a moment and filter a moment you know we ought to just look at one another sometimes and say filter yeah amen you know I mean someone starts getting a filter in all the old steam starts rolling out filter someone says something they're they're a little upset they're going to start ripping somebody filter we're supposed to filter everything until there's nothing left but the Holy Ghost and I mean I like to filter after I've said my piece you know after I've called you every name in the book and protect took your name off the Lamb's Book of Life and and canceled your place in heaven and and told you for sure I think you're the son of this the devil and then after I've said all that then I want to go back over and think about what I said all right thank you but that's not what we just heard what comes out of your mouth is what you'll be judged by e you know and I gotta finally say and I'll just say it with all my heart with this message needs and what this quote unquote so-called bride needs it needs to become Christians good old-fashioned The Joy Bell's ringing treating one another it can even even in Philippians we read that a scripture all the time it's such a marvelous picture but he says if there be any consolation in Christ and they're saying they're going to get any consolement [Music] if you're going to get any comfort all right if you want any Joy if what is our consolation in being in Christ what do we get from it what do we receive what what does being in Christ return to us what effect does that have on us and he says he said if there be any consolation great any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy that you be like-minded amen having the same love being of one Accord and one mind what Accord and what mind it isn't a pact it's not a birds of a feather flock together it isn't fine too or Thief three people that agree with you and you're right so if I can get four or five of you to uh agree yeah you know what I mean that that ability is just out there does that make Billy out there no you've made a pack that's not the one mind we're trying to be a quarter that's not the one Accord the world has all kinds of Accords that's their whole thing out there spending money adding trying to get people to get into their Camp I want to go beyond the camp I want to go into the sweetness of the Gospel I want to be able to take the very words that Jesus spoke because he was the son of God he was God Emmanuel come down and take on the form create in Mary he didn't impregnate Mary he didn't take Mary seed and he created in her womb the second Adam just like he created the first Adam he created the second alley and he did that so he could come in the form of sin to be a Kinsmen and he could be tempted in every way that we're tempted and now Keith came okay and so when he came the scripture said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and he's offering he says whosoever believeth on me I'll give them power to become Sons and Daughters of God in other words to have the same heart the same have the same mind not the same religion but the ability if I could say it this way to reject the negativity that the enemy is trying to plant in our hearts and our minds and be able to say I'm not going there I ain't going there I am not going to preach a political gospel I'm sorry I'm interested in one thing on my heart that's to get the goodness of the Gospel to the bride no matter where she is let's get the word to somebody's heart this transforming word let me tell you the Holy Spirit comes with the word the holy spirit is attached to the word the baptism of the holy spirit is attached to the word of God you can't receive the word of God without receiving the spirit of God can do it and then that really what we I want let the spirit that be in Christ dwell in you if it does what's it going to do it's going to Quicken my mortal body I actually got the key to the Rapture sitting right in front of me and it's just like a stain I'm trying to grab it I'm trying to grab it and all these demons are coming in prayer well I'm trying to fight my way I want to grab that love I want to grab that spirit I want to grab that nature you know Donald Trump's in front of me and Joe Biden's in front of me Senator something such as in front of me and the walk movements in front of me in California is in front of me and I got this garbage heap I gotta go through let me be like Joe don't speak if that's a foolish woman the lord giveth the lord taketh away it blessed be the name of the Lord amen he's fighting like ever to keep us from entering into that piece a piece that's her path says what understanding you can't understand the world the only way you can understand the world is to be insane that from PhD in Psychology right here if you can think like this world thinks and understand this world you are insane am I absolutely absolutely I got another insane God agrees with me right you are not of this world but let's just finish and then we can think of chocolate almond it says I can give you a scripture for that right so man hunger you know you just don't send them away but you you take care of them okay it says fulfill you my joy be like wine just loving being a one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory nothing right anything that points to yourself stop anything that's going to lift you up this this is what I know this is what I see let you let me give you my two cents worth let me explain to you what he meant you know Jesus fixed that real quick he said is it good to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil is it lawful he said to do good or do we do evil if you were stuck because he changed their thinking because righteousness wasn't in the law because he came to fulfill the law and people still think that there's righteousness in keeping Church traditions I was a Catholic I used to think it was righteous to light candles in fact I let every candle in the church I thought it was righteous to pay those things righteous to go into the confessional righteous to take communion all my righteousness was in sacrifices was in Works was in Traditions was in following ordinances and teachings but that's not what the scripture says it said my righteousness is his filthy rags and he will be my righteousness until Jesus Christ comes into your heart and his love is shed abroad in you and that Love Takes control of your mind you're living short of your privileges I didn't say you were lost I said you're living short it's a privilege to love like the Lord and he's cosign and says he says he says one mind let nothing be done through stripe or vainglory but aloneness of mine each esteeming the other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of other let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus I think he was taught it not robbery all the great things that he I thought of all these little works that Jesus did the woman caught in adultery how he treated her suffer not the little children to come unto me the Rich Young Ruler how there was a whole nother side of his life that the love was pouring out to the needy and to the Lost and he wanted to live that way he makes a great statement he said if you're afraid to confess me before men I'll be afraid to confess you before my father you don't do it just with your lips I believe in Jesus Christ no you want you want to show people that the life of the Lord is peace it's Joy and I I I just I I wrote other scriptures down but I think that you understand what that I'm trying to say it's time this great filter we have has not only does we have to filter it through the word but we that all the circumstances that arise look at how Jesus handled all the circumstances that arose the Pharisees tempting them the coin this lying fixing the stone of all these great circumstances that was part of his work is how we handle them how we conducted himself towards people the hope he gave the joy he gave what radiated from him what Hope Came From Him What atmosphere came from him and Nick I I think that Paul summed it up one place like this he said though I understand all the Mysteries and I speak with the the tongues of men and angels and I have not charity it profiteth me nothing we begin to fail to miss it's like sometimes we get so hung up on making it we forget how to make it you make it by living one day at a time and taking control of that day and let the love of the Lord be manifested through you in that day in that circumstance he becomes the master of every circumstance a mistake to the world am I there yet no but I see it you understand I see the land it's just right there it's right there to have that comfort I will not leave you comfortless but I'll come again that where I am you may be also that's not all future tense that I can actually taste and there's something in me that's drawing that I want that in my life I want that to be drawn in my heart I have a taste for it I have a longing for it and in order to get that taste I've got to take it through the filter of God's word and I got to filter out all these other voices and atmospheres my sheep hear my voice and another they won't follow I'm telling you if we can recognize these two spirits and we can withstand that other Spirit that's trying to rile us up then we'll become that invincible Army we say that quote a hundred times and have zero idea of what that spirit is it ain't the nominations that's man's own result of them trying to seek comfort and cover in a man-made system but if you come to him he's life he's peace he's joy unspeakable and he wants to have fellowship with you so God bless you I preached too long but let's Stand Together uh we'll say a word of prayer and then again oh anybody like I'm going to head to the ice cream store in proms on Pipeline anybody like to come feel free anyway let us pray ask your heart does that all negative Spirit of the world that old frustration that confusion that just seems like a cluttered life and and so much going on is it just trying to rob you of your joy and of your comfort and down in your heart you say you know what I I don't want that to affect me I want to meditate on what I have I have my name written on the Lamb's Book of Life I have the gift of God which is eternal life I have the promise that if he started a work in me he'd finish it till the end I have the comfort knowing that nothing can pluck me out of the palm of his hand [Music] I know that he promised he'd never leave me nor forsake me and the word of God said if you on if you think on anything think on these things think on things which are pure and good and edifying Lord let me make this great transition into the Capstone where the love of God is shed abroad in My Heart by your spirit then Lord let me understand the origin of your word [Music] the truth of the Gospel that your son preached and lived and brought to Earth that that's the only life that matters is the word life for in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God oh Father May the love of God enter into this old crusty soul and you promised that you would take the hardest Stone and make it a heart of Flesh that's my desire father I want to live the way you want me to live Lord I just desired it's in my heart if you just like to lift your hand to him and say Lord I want that peace I want that Joy I want that confidence I want that control of the circumstance father I'm not going to let the frustrations of life rob me of my joy Lord I want my union with you to be so strong that my every word that comes out of my mouth judges me to righteousness I just ask that father I admit that I need lots of help but Lord if there's a deep calling then there's a deep to respond I believe it and ask you to
