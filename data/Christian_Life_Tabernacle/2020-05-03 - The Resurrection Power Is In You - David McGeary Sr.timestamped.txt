[22:01] [Music]
[22:41] [Music]
[23:01] [Music]
[23:08] [Music]
[23:13] [Music]
[23:36] [Music]
[24:13] our gracious Heavenly Father thankful
[24:17] for your goodness to me ask you to bless
[24:19] us once again as we fellowship around
[24:22] your world in Jesus precious and
[24:25] wonderful name we pray amen amen
[24:29] let's open our Bibles and and turned
[24:35] over to the gospel of not the God but
[24:41] st. John the First Epistle of st. John
[24:46] I thought they called first John and
[24:48] let's read in the fourth chapter of
[24:52] first John and you know this morning we
[25:02] talked a little bit about the condition
[25:05] and the way things are going but tonight
[25:08] we're going to talk about the great hope
[25:09] that we also have amen because you know
[25:15] there's one thing we know for sure that
[25:17] God always equips his people to meet a
[25:21] challenge that's what he does so we're
[25:25] just gonna have a little fellowship
[25:26] tonight and a little bit of word of
[25:27] encouragement and I'm I don't know what
[25:33] the right word is you know it just felt
[25:38] within my heart if it was like maybe
[25:40] being led or sometimes I even used the
[25:43] word motivated I just felt to take a
[25:46] look and and and meditate on out of the
[25:51] message he that is in you is greater
[25:53] than he that is in the world and I
[25:56] thought how perfect that fits and we
[26:00] just want to talk about that and then it
[26:03] when you can go home and you can sit
[26:06] back and you can listen to it and maybe
[26:10] as you're listening to it you can see
[26:13] the little context of this thought now
[26:17] there's more in that message than I
[26:20] could ever preach in a lifetime now
[26:23] now this guaranty of that but it's
[26:26] really a good comforting message to
[26:30] increase our understanding so let's read
[26:34] these scriptures he said beloved believe
[26:38] not every spirit but try the spirits
[26:43] whether they are of God because many
[26:48] false prophets are gone out into the
[26:52] world we know that means preachers we
[26:56] know that means voices we know that
[26:59] means messages so there's a lot of false
[27:03] messages a lot of false things that have
[27:06] gone out into the world and so we just
[27:09] we don't want to believe every spirit
[27:11] and that's what we talked about this
[27:12] morning stop in for a moment say what
[27:15] effect is this having on me what is it
[27:18] doing to my faith what is it doing to my
[27:20] thinking it says it says hereby know ye
[27:25] the Spirit of God every spirit that
[27:29] confesses that Jesus Christ is come in
[27:33] the flesh is of God may I say here again
[27:40] that is not a historical recognition
[27:45] Amen that is a personal identification
[27:52] by experience Amen it's not saying oh I
[27:57] believe Jesus came 2,000 years ago
[28:00] I'm a I have the spirit no how could the
[28:04] spirit the word contradict itself it
[28:07] says Satan believes and fears and
[28:10] tremble so there's something deeper
[28:12] there that he's saying here and every
[28:17] spirit that confesseth not that Jesus
[28:20] Christ is come in the flesh is not of
[28:24] God and this is the spirit of Antichrist
[28:30] this is the spirit of Antichrist where
[28:35] ye
[28:36] heard that it should come and even now
[28:41] already is in the world ye are of God
[28:48] little children and have overcome them
[28:51] because greater is He that is in you
[28:56] than he that is in the world god bless
[29:01] you you may be seated you know I just
[29:09] get such joy over just taking a message
[29:15] and and reading it and looking at the
[29:18] things that are said and and all that
[29:22] God has packed in it's it's a wonderful
[29:26] message it talks about some of the
[29:29] experience he's having the things that
[29:31] he's going through in life but I just
[29:34] like to take this little thought out for
[29:36] us in the hour that we're living because
[29:40] I certainly believe that this is
[29:45] spiritual food and due season and it's
[29:48] been spoken in just the manner that it
[29:51] was spoken in and maybe a lot of people
[29:57] kind of criticized maybe the grammar or
[30:01] the education behind it but there just
[30:04] seems something sometimes to be about
[30:06] just the sentence structure that that
[30:10] just causes an Enlightenment and and
[30:14] here's a message that brother branham's
[30:18] spoke on and I'd like to use this I
[30:22] guess kind of a context or a platform if
[30:27] we would use it in that light and this
[30:31] is from the message called look away to
[30:35] Jesus and he says the Bible said in
[30:42] isaiah 45:22 we find that god said
[30:49] look unto me all the ends of the earth
[30:52] and now when the earth has come to its
[30:57] end or the systems of the earth has come
[31:01] to its ends let the people look unto him
[31:05] now you might say we've heard this
[31:09] generation after generation we've heard
[31:14] this for a long time that is true and
[31:19] it's been preached for a long time many
[31:24] ministers have look at this same text
[31:27] thousands of them but here is the thing
[31:32] I want to ask you tonight for the next
[31:37] few minutes but when you look the
[31:41] question is now here's the question and
[31:45] and we want to use these these questions
[31:49] that he's going to ask and use these
[31:53] questions to go back and look at what is
[31:59] he that is in you em and so if I could
[32:03] just put it out like this if we want to
[32:07] we want to be stimulated by this this
[32:11] viewpoint to take a look at this message
[32:15] and and so we want to look at it to the
[32:20] eyes so he's asking a question and the
[32:23] question is but when you look the
[32:28] question is he says for the next few
[32:31] minute but when you look the question is
[32:34] what do you see when you look that is
[32:41] one of the questions what do you see
[32:44] when you look okay that's important
[32:48] I've always liked those pictures you
[32:54] know that have like us a snow flakes and
[32:58] and if you stare at it long enough all
[33:01] of a sudden something comes
[33:02] out of it and I always used to use it I
[33:05] says well that's like a revelation you
[33:08] know it's there but you can't see it
[33:10] till everything comes together you know
[33:14] and I've had people that they just can't
[33:18] see it and we were other the other day
[33:22] visiting with her brother and everybody
[33:24] could see it but him so we just told him
[33:27] he wasn't elected you know but but so
[33:32] that's the one question what do you see
[33:35] when you look so we're talking about
[33:38] look away to Jesus what do we see when
[33:41] you look the question also was what the
[33:44] he that doesn't confess that Jesus has
[33:48] come in the flesh is Antichrist so what
[33:52] do you see when you look what is it what
[33:55] do you see what do you understand that's
[33:57] what see means it means to understand it
[34:00] doesn't mean to see with your eye
[34:02] it's what speaks to your heart when you
[34:05] look when you hear that what how does it
[34:09] speak to your heart
[34:10] how does it move you how does it what
[34:14] rises up in your heart and then here is
[34:17] the other great question he says what do
[34:23] you see when you do look so the question
[34:30] there just the way he said it the
[34:32] emphasis isn't on the scene it's on the
[34:36] wind when you what do you see when you
[34:39] do look or when do you look I mean how
[34:43] how long do we wait to look towards the
[34:47] Lord how long do we wait to to seek an
[34:52] answer how long do we wait the prophet
[34:55] of cantata C says the trouble with man
[34:57] is they put God on the back burner and
[35:00] he's got to make them so desperate you
[35:03] know what I mean he's got to bring them
[35:05] into such desperation he's got to put
[35:07] them under so much pressure
[35:09] to get them to turn and
[35:13] look to him if he's there but man never
[35:18] seeks God first he that's what he said
[35:21] he says you have not sought me I sought
[35:25] you again so that's that the nature of
[35:29] man man has to exhaust himself before
[35:33] he'll finally humble himself to to give
[35:37] in to the Word of God where it ought to
[35:41] be the first place we go so many times
[35:44] it's the last place that we go so the
[35:48] question is what do we see look when it
[35:51] when we look away to the Lord what are
[35:54] what are we seeing well what does that
[35:58] mean to us I are messenger laboured with
[36:04] the people probably one of the greatest
[36:07] challenges he had is to to get the
[36:11] people to bring him out of history and
[36:14] make him the same yesterday today and
[36:19] forever to get the people to realize one
[36:23] that he was here and that he was the
[36:28] same and so it was no difference if if
[36:32] if the if the same Jesus came back in
[36:37] the same body that he was back when he
[36:41] walked on earth he would do the same
[36:43] work now that same Jesus was here but he
[36:48] was veiled in the veil of human flesh in
[36:52] the using the Ministry of a prophet
[36:56] debate it still was him and so when
[37:00] people looked what did they see they
[37:03] said they just saw the veil they saw the
[37:07] man they saw the flesh well that had to
[37:11] be that way because back in the days of
[37:14] Jesus that's what they saw - they just
[37:17] saw a man they saw a carpenter's son
[37:20] they saw an illegitimate Roman child
[37:23] they didn't
[37:25] you see what that was so that when they
[37:28] looked they they couldn't even see that
[37:32] they were blinded and and so the that
[37:36] would that was a great question to ask
[37:40] and and as the word of God began to
[37:43] unfold if it begin to unfold so he had
[37:47] and the question here is what do we see
[37:51] when it says that he that the Antichrist
[37:55] spirit even does now work you know what
[38:00] do we see when we look for the
[38:03] Antichrist spirit you know so many
[38:09] people think that it's what can you say
[38:14] maybe something that'll just fish maybe
[38:17] a certain being or a certain devil
[38:21] working in a certain way or a certain
[38:25] thing the mark of the beast what do
[38:27] people think the mark of the beast is
[38:30] and oh my goodness I've heard so many
[38:33] times people think it's a chip they're
[38:36] gonna put in you well they're whenever
[38:38] even chips invented so many years ago
[38:41] and people were still coming up with a
[38:44] definition for the mark of the beast and
[38:48] all along just think of it the mark of
[38:50] the beast was that Trinitarian baptism
[38:53] the Father Son and the Holy Ghost
[38:55] because the mark was one on your
[38:59] forehead which represented the way that
[39:02] you think it's a mark on your thinking
[39:06] and anybody that looks at God and sees
[39:09] them as three persons then they'll never
[39:13] be able to come into the Fellowship of
[39:17] Christ coming in the flesh because he's
[39:22] a second person he's somebody that that
[39:25] was there and came down and they'll
[39:28] never be able to see that all that God
[39:32] was he poured into Christ and all that
[39:35] Christ was he poured into the church so
[39:38] they'll never be able to confess that he
[39:42] has come in the flesh and that's why
[39:46] they couldn't see the message of the
[39:48] hour
[39:48] they couldn't seen the same God that was
[39:52] that came to redeem us not born of sex
[39:56] but created in the womb of Mary not
[39:59] using Mary not the mother of God but God
[40:02] Himself begotten a son a man there's one
[40:08] mediator between God and man the man
[40:10] Jesus Christ God created a man a second
[40:14] Adam and he dwelt in that man
[40:17] that man had the personality of God but
[40:21] God raised him up as a son oh he did he
[40:27] learned obedience by the things that he
[40:29] suffered we read in the scripture that
[40:31] in the wilderness that in his personal
[40:34] life he contended with himself that he
[40:37] had desires I I don't have the I didn't
[40:41] have the time to look it up but it
[40:42] crossed my mind somewhere it was spoke
[40:45] that that that he would have married
[40:48] Mary Magdalene I believe it was that he
[40:51] had in the affections you say all know
[40:54] he didn't yes he did he was tempted in
[40:56] every way that we were tempted in fact
[41:04] the scripture said he learned obedience
[41:06] and he humbled himself he became humble
[41:12] you talked about when he was in front of
[41:14] Pilate mine he could have showed off
[41:18] then couldn't he he said I've got angels
[41:22] if I was up this world my army would
[41:26] come fight for me yeah could you imagine
[41:30] little ol dinky Caesar's army against
[41:34] the army of God of all my I'd like to
[41:37] bend there to see that but then I
[41:39] wouldn't have been here so God's got a
[41:41] perfect plan amen but see they don't see
[41:45] it so what do you see when you read that
[41:47] scripture we've been taught by
[41:52] by the Antichrist spirit back what he
[41:56] said that spirit even does now work but
[41:59] little children you are the children of
[42:01] God so we asked the question what do we
[42:05] see when we look and the other question
[42:07] is when do we look what events have to
[42:13] take place what conditions have to come
[42:17] on us what has to transpire to to cause
[42:22] us or to make us bring us to that win or
[42:28] in other words it's realization time for
[42:31] me to look John said that spirit of
[42:36] Antichrist even now did you've heard
[42:39] about it coming but it even now is in
[42:42] the world it's even now working denying
[42:46] deity in flesh okay so we see that so we
[42:52] we want to ask ourselves I think now and
[42:56] and that's the whole theme that's been
[42:59] in my heart and I've expressed to you
[43:02] dear in this whole worldwide shut down
[43:08] and sure he showed you one thing it
[43:11] shows you that man isn't in control
[43:15] there's some micro body spirit out there
[43:19] that's got man under control
[43:21] we're ruled by an amoeba virus amoeba
[43:29] that's what rules the world the rules
[43:33] world ruled by fear
[43:36] some little unseen thing no under the
[43:40] scripture says we don't fight those
[43:42] things which we can deal see with our
[43:44] hands but we smite spiritual wickedness
[43:46] in high places and when is it going to
[43:53] cause us and and make this look at can
[43:57] see and because the the question is look
[44:01] away to Jesus look away to him so we're
[44:05] not talking about
[44:06] looking at him historically so there's
[44:11] got to be something that we should be
[44:13] able to look to there should be
[44:16] something that we should be able to find
[44:20] there should be some truth or or if I
[44:24] like this word better through some
[44:26] revelation that we can anchor on that
[44:31] lets us know where we stand how
[44:35] protected we are the the what we're
[44:42] fortified with that if God be for you
[44:46] who can be against you or as we say he
[44:50] that is in us is greater than he who is
[44:55] in the world
[44:56] when do we look at that when do we look
[45:01] away to that scripture because to look
[45:04] away to Jesus means to look away to the
[45:07] world because he was the word when do we
[45:10] look away to that when do when does it
[45:12] come down that we look away and we see
[45:15] we see the spirit of Antichrist even
[45:18] death word the spirit of Antichrist is
[45:21] confessing that Jesus Christ hasn't come
[45:24] in the flesh
[45:25] the spirit of Antichrist even now death
[45:28] work we look at the mark of the beast
[45:30] it's on the forehead which means that's
[45:33] the way that man thinks and the mark on
[45:36] the hand stood for the obedience to the
[45:41] rule and so what I thought was so
[45:47] marvelous about how quick this pandemic
[45:51] swept in and the measures that that man
[45:56] took in their desperate fight you know
[46:00] years ago if we were really a copy
[46:02] nation we would all fell down and sock
[46:05] laughter sock
[46:06] I'll get my tooth put back in and I'll
[46:09] be able to say some of these words and
[46:11] ashes you know what I mean it just we
[46:14] would have repented
[46:15] we were to call unto God we would have
[46:18] looked up at that if it was any other
[46:20] time in the period of man if we were the
[46:24] children of Israel we would have went
[46:26] crying unto the Lord we would have
[46:28] turned our hearts back to the Lord and
[46:30] the Lord would have came and had mercy
[46:34] on us no but we're just gonna do it
[46:37] ourselves remember the vision brother
[46:43] Ram had where he was look those he saw
[46:45] those people working in those test tubes
[46:48] and everything and they and he was
[46:51] warning them about what they were doing
[46:54] and oh they just kept going on they just
[46:57] looked up and went on working I don't
[47:04] trust him I don't I've got to the place
[47:11] that every word of man is a lie and
[47:15] every word I think fake the guys that
[47:17] talk about fake news are fake you know
[47:23] what I mean I'm I'm telling you there's
[47:25] only one place that we can anchor it's
[47:29] the Word of God so what do you see when
[47:32] you look at the Word of God where is the
[47:35] Word of God what do you see when you
[47:38] look when you look at all the false
[47:40] prophets all the thoughts voices all the
[47:43] false ministries all the false things
[47:45] that are out there what what have you
[47:47] finally came to that you've anchored on
[47:50] that this is the truth you can't be
[47:56] tossed to and fro he said if you're
[48:00] lukewarm I'll spill you out of my mouth
[48:03] you can't piece things together you
[48:06] can't take a little bit from here and a
[48:08] little bit from there and a little bit
[48:10] from there and can't have so you know
[48:13] this guy's contrary to this and this
[48:16] guy's contrary to that and there's all
[48:18] this confusion
[48:19] Satan's the author of confusion that's
[48:22] what's John saying little builders try
[48:24] every spirit there's many false prophets
[48:27] there's many false voices
[48:29] there's many people trying to feed you
[48:31] something to feed you a way to a think a
[48:34] feed you approach a feed you a spin feed
[48:38] you a false comfort tried evil spirits
[48:41] try do they manifest Jesus Christ in the
[48:47] flesh do they create that in you do they
[48:52] create Christ in you the hope of glory
[48:55] if the same spirit that dwelt in Jesus
[48:59] Christ dwell in you that is that
[49:03] scripture that's what that's critter he
[49:05] that denies that the same spirit that
[49:09] was in Jesus Christ can be in you is
[49:14] Antichrist and if you want to go to a
[49:18] mall and you really get down to it they
[49:22] don't believe that same spirit that was
[49:25] in Jesus Christ the works that I do
[49:28] shall you do also because when it came
[49:31] and that spirit was present with us
[49:34] veiled in flesh doing the same signs and
[49:37] wonders raising the dead discerning the
[49:40] thoughts and tense of the heart they did
[49:42] exactly what they did in that day they
[49:44] called it Beelzebub and all you have to
[49:54] do is sit back and read what he said
[49:56] listen to what he taught I I marvel how
[50:02] that I'm getting off my track but I
[50:05] can't help myself I marvel at how all of
[50:10] a sudden people say oh he lied and it
[50:14] wasn't true
[50:16] all's you have to do is go look at out
[50:18] of their own mouths
[50:21] Tommy Osborne said this was a god man he
[50:25] testified who is that big old woman with
[50:29] all that hair and 25 pounds of making up
[50:32] on Tammy Faye right she talks about this
[50:36] and and all of them they're all
[50:38] testifying testifying what a great
[50:40] ministry what a great thing
[50:42] and everything yeah you're trying to
[50:44] tell me that anybody could make all that
[50:48] up and we'll have it all fit together
[50:50] and have so many people heal that's
[50:58] Antichrist spirit my spirit says God
[51:01] come in the flesh Jesus Christ came in
[51:04] the flag I don't have to try to write a
[51:08] disclaimer oh he wasn't God well Jesus
[51:15] without God wasn't God the scripture
[51:20] says there's only one mediator between
[51:22] God and man the man yeah you don't have
[51:30] to write disclaimers and you don't have
[51:33] to write disclaimers about yourself
[51:35] either we don't have to write disclaimer
[51:42] about ourselves
[51:44] that's just Leslie and I well we first
[51:46] heard about this message we we weren't
[51:50] clear you know I'm not going to my
[51:52] testimony but we were just young hippies
[51:53] and we had this big Christian coming in
[51:55] and we have this lady that sold a
[51:58] Watkins products you know it's like Avon
[52:00] back in them days there's no such thing
[52:03] as Amazon people actually showed up at
[52:06] your door and sold your hair brushes
[52:08] that's how old I am and you know we had
[52:13] a milkman how many those are the milkman
[52:15] is nobody knows what a cow is and so
[52:24] we're there and this lady comes in our
[52:26] house and nice lady I mean she had one
[52:30] of them
[52:30] pixie haircuts I don't remember if any
[52:33] of you remember pixie haircut looks a
[52:34] whole lot like mine does and you know
[52:37] they had those earrings on you know and
[52:39] and she'd come in nice lady and
[52:42] everything and we asked her we said have
[52:45] you ever heard a William Branham William
[52:46] Branham she said I was
[52:48] bromance meetings of course we're like
[52:51] wow we couldn't believe this was the
[52:54] first contact in flesh that we ever had
[52:58] of anything concerning brother Branham
[53:04] it was like really it's really real and
[53:09] she said oh yeah
[53:11] I had severe migraine headaches I mean
[53:16] so severe that that and I haven't had a
[53:20] migraine but they say Yoko actually
[53:23] drive you blind they can be so severe
[53:26] and she said he prayed for me he said
[53:31] and instantly I lost my headaches my
[53:38] headaches left me she said you know but
[53:41] something else really happened and she
[53:44] said I never understood this part of it
[53:47] she didn't even confess to be a
[53:49] Christian I mean she walked into our
[53:52] house and it looked like you were
[53:54] walking into a church
[53:56] you know we had Bibles everywhere and
[53:58] crosses everywhere you know and and she
[54:02] never even confessed to be a Christian
[54:04] never even made a comment about the
[54:06] gospel never even talked about thing you
[54:09] know pray or nothing and she said but
[54:11] you know the strangest thing I don't
[54:13] understand she said but I got the gift
[54:16] to play the piano and we look at her she
[54:21] says yeah she's I've been played I don't
[54:26] know how many years she said I haven't
[54:28] played in seven eight years you know you
[54:32] got to remember we're talking early 70s
[54:34] so brother Bannerman just gone off the
[54:37] scene so seven eight years would have
[54:38] been in 63 64 she said here I'll show
[54:42] you she went and sat at our piano took
[54:47] that piano little lip up and I'll
[54:51] guarantee you that piano was out of tune
[54:53] but I'll guarantee anot one note she
[54:56] played was out of tune and she started
[54:59] playing the piano like you
[55:02] believe there was an anointing came into
[55:06] that room that was so powerful it was
[55:10] just absolutely divine anointed piano
[55:15] player I don't understand it maybe God
[55:18] gave her that gift for that one moment
[55:21] at that time because he knew he had a
[55:25] son and a daughter and believers down
[55:28] the road that we're going to come in
[55:30] contact with this message and he set
[55:32] that vindication just so real and she
[55:35] played that piano and that piano has
[55:38] never ever sounded that good it never
[55:43] will sound that good
[55:45] in fact we sold that piano I tell you
[55:51] where it went to but I sold it to a
[55:53] fella that I knew that turned out to be
[55:55] a pretty famous musician around the
[55:59] world but it that piano had its day and
[56:04] from that moment on it was downhill I
[56:08] believe that God man can orchestrate
[56:12] that kind of thing the supernatural what
[56:18] was there and it was so evident and even
[56:22] the effect I've had personal healings in
[56:25] my life by listening to discernment and
[56:28] have brother Branham discerned somebody
[56:31] else with the same problem and faith
[56:34] rise up and be able to accept that same
[56:39] prayer on my behalf and see results
[56:45] you'll never come too late that's
[56:48] Antichrist spirit it shouldn't even be
[56:52] considered it shouldn't be messed with
[56:55] it shouldn't be given even the one
[56:59] special time or our heart should be so
[57:03] secure so let's just take a few moments
[57:07] if you don't mind - I'd like to read a
[57:13] few things
[57:15] and so we're talking about we're gonna
[57:19] look for a moment and see what we see
[57:26] and we're gonna sit back and we're gonna
[57:29] say when do we look well I think now is
[57:32] a good time to look so this is on page
[57:37] nine paragraph 44 of he that is in you
[57:44] and I'm sorry for my interpreters I
[57:48] forgot to give them the quotes they
[57:51] asked me for the scriptures but I forgot
[57:54] to tell them what message we're looking
[57:57] in but if you can find it on your phone
[58:00] or your tablet and I guess I don't know
[58:05] if we can put it up on the board here or
[58:07] not I can tell you one thing I remember
[58:11] the first time because anybody remember
[58:14] that little ebook that came out and I
[58:17] remember preaching a sermon right after
[58:20] the first time that book ebook came out
[58:23] and we used to say brother Branham said
[58:26] you know well I say brother Branham said
[58:28] in 50 people heads were down and they
[58:31] were all looking for it you know I found
[58:34] out you couldn't paraphrase like you
[58:35] used to you know what I mean and I also
[58:39] found out a lot of things that I thought
[58:41] brother Branham said he never said I do
[58:43] you know so that's why God don't give
[58:47] secondhand revelation he deals with the
[58:50] heart of the believer but now let's just
[58:53] take them on it can you put that up
[58:54] there on there up you can he that is in
[58:57] you
[58:59] paragraph 44 and it starts like this now
[59:06] everybody listen real close before I
[59:10] read the scripture okay now I read the
[59:15] scripture but he's saying everybody
[59:17] listen real close before I read the
[59:19] scripture all that ever would be
[59:23] redeemed God put their name on
[59:28] Pam's book of life before the world ever
[59:32] come into creation how many know that
[59:39] that's the scripture and the Antichrist
[59:44] in the last days is going to be so close
[59:49] like the real thing real Church
[59:54] everything just like Judas was until it
[59:59] would deceive the very elect 'add if it
[1:00:03] was possible is that right but no man
[1:00:11] can come to Jesus except God sends him
[1:00:18] but no man can come to Jesus except God
[1:00:24] sends him you know doesn't that put just
[1:00:28] a little different thought on the word
[1:00:30] draw we always think that we were pulled
[1:00:35] but there's another part that he's
[1:00:38] revealing to us that were sin so there's
[1:00:44] got to be something in you that was sent
[1:00:47] amen so that draw and scent you can see
[1:00:51] it working together or in other words
[1:00:53] how that God works that out just a
[1:00:56] beautiful way that it's spoken there he
[1:01:01] said is that right no man can come to
[1:01:06] Jesus except God sends him and all that
[1:01:11] God did give to him will come to him and
[1:01:18] when he takes that book that last name
[1:01:24] see all in the Luther age he pulled them
[1:01:28] out all in the Wesley age he pulled them
[1:01:32] out all in the different ages the
[1:01:35] Pentecostal age he pulls them out
[1:01:39] they're over here
[1:01:41] won't be judged with them they're
[1:01:46] rapturing and then when over here won't
[1:01:54] be judged with them they're rapturing
[1:01:57] and then when the last name comes out
[1:02:01] that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:02:05] that was slain before the foundation of
[1:02:08] the world when that last name has been
[1:02:12] redeemed his work is finished he comes
[1:02:16] forth to claim what he has redeemed that
[1:02:20] makes our heart bleed but if it went on
[1:02:24] a thousand years later there would not
[1:02:28] be one redeemed and no one can be
[1:02:32] redeemed unless they were a part they
[1:02:36] were put on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:02:40] before the foundation of the world who
[1:02:45] are they I don't know nobody else knows
[1:02:48] he just got alone I'm trusting that
[1:02:52] every one of us our names are on that
[1:02:57] book if mine was on there I'm sure to be
[1:03:03] there if it wasn't I won't be there
[1:03:07] that's all see it it's just up to God
[1:03:13] it's not in him that willeth him that
[1:03:19] runneth but God that showeth mercy see
[1:03:25] what a marvelous place amen
[1:03:31] now to me that's something we should be
[1:03:33] able to look to he that is in you is
[1:03:41] greater than he that is in the world we
[1:03:45] can't understand that yet we say we
[1:03:49] believe it and we know it's true but we
[1:03:54] really don't on
[1:03:55] understand it greater is He that is in
[1:03:58] you than he that is in the world what is
[1:04:04] in you that's greater it's Christ The
[1:04:10] Anointed God that was in Christ is in
[1:04:14] you greater is He that is in you than he
[1:04:20] that was in the world then if he is in
[1:04:24] you it's not you anymore living it's him
[1:04:29] living in you now we take that statement
[1:04:34] and we automatically start judging
[1:04:37] ourselves and the minute you start
[1:04:39] judging yourself in that statement you
[1:04:42] will fail every time because you still
[1:04:47] are in the flesh and the flesh wars
[1:04:51] against the spirit in the spirit against
[1:04:53] the flesh and these two are contrary one
[1:04:57] to the other so you're in a built-in
[1:04:59] battle so it's not saying if Christ be
[1:05:03] in you then then he'll live in you and
[1:05:06] you will do what you do and say okay I
[1:05:09] shouldn't have any flesh no because
[1:05:12] we're tempted in the flesh there's
[1:05:14] something else that we're looking to
[1:05:16] before I read the scripture I want you
[1:05:21] to understand something that your name
[1:05:25] was put on a book before the foundation
[1:05:28] of the world he almost tells us in
[1:05:32] advance what he's going to try to show
[1:05:35] it and so he goes on and he says it's
[1:05:41] not you living anymore living it's him
[1:05:46] living in you see it's not your thinking
[1:05:49] and what you would think about this is
[1:05:52] what he said about this see then he is
[1:05:58] in you he absolutely would not deny what
[1:06:03] he said he couldn't do it but he would
[1:06:08] keep
[1:06:09] what he said and he's trying to find
[1:06:13] that person that he can vindicate
[1:06:16] himself through so if your name was put
[1:06:20] on the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:06:23] foundation of the world he cannot deny
[1:06:26] what he said he cannot deny you but he's
[1:06:32] looking for the person that that can be
[1:06:36] vindicated in when do we look and what
[1:06:42] are we seeing what is it that we're
[1:06:44] looking at what is it that we're
[1:06:46] expecting God to do what is it that
[1:06:50] we're expecting to be manifested if we
[1:06:53] know who we are but what are we what are
[1:06:56] we what is it that God is going to
[1:07:01] perform in us because he who is in us is
[1:07:07] greater than he who in the world so
[1:07:11] where was that put in us it was put in
[1:07:17] us before the foundation of the world
[1:07:21] brother Reza - not there I'm not going
[1:07:24] to be there
[1:07:25] Oh everybody wants to work their way in
[1:07:31] God it's a gift of God lest any man
[1:07:35] should boast not a he that willeth or he
[1:07:40] that runneth but God that show us the
[1:07:43] mercy and so as we reread here he says
[1:07:47] he absolutely would not deny what he
[1:07:49] said now that doesn't mean he had a I'll
[1:07:56] just read he says now but he that is in
[1:07:58] you is greater than he that's in the
[1:08:01] world God in you like he was in Christ
[1:08:06] because what all God was he poured into
[1:08:10] Christ and all Christ was he poured into
[1:08:14] the church that's God in you he that's
[1:08:19] in you
[1:08:20] no wonder the winds obeyed him
[1:08:23] in the waves obeyed him his word obeyed
[1:08:29] his word because it was God's Word
[1:08:31] through him he was a man that he was the
[1:08:36] Word made flesh see and when he spoke it
[1:08:40] was God speaking through human lips Amen
[1:08:45] just going to read a couple more
[1:08:48] statements to you John told the
[1:08:52] disciples you've heard of the Antichrist
[1:08:56] who is to come and is already here
[1:09:00] working in the children of disobedience
[1:09:04] but little children you are not of this
[1:09:11] world oh I wish I could grasp that
[1:09:18] little children the Antichrist spirit
[1:09:21] works but you are not of this world
[1:09:40] he's all crazy he's already here working
[1:09:45] in the children of disobedience but
[1:09:47] little children you're not of this world
[1:09:50] you're of God you're of God and greater
[1:09:56] is He that is in you than he that is in
[1:10:00] the world
[1:10:01] that's Christ in you the Creator he that
[1:10:06] created the heavens and the earth he was
[1:10:11] made manifest in the person of Jesus
[1:10:14] Christ God in Christ reconciling the
[1:10:17] world to himself
[1:10:19] let's see you say that wasn't the Son of
[1:10:21] God
[1:10:22] Oh brother branham all right let's find
[1:10:25] out if he's eternal and the everlasting
[1:10:28] God the same God that is in us tonight
[1:10:33] not only with us but in us he provided
[1:10:39] he proved he's within us greater is He
[1:10:44] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:10:48] world what are we afraid of the world
[1:10:53] now I can't just go through because
[1:10:58] there's so many great revelations tied
[1:11:01] up but I just want to share this with us
[1:11:05] tonight greater was God in Moses than
[1:11:13] Egypt in all - that Egypt it was greater
[1:11:18] was God the God that was in Moses was
[1:11:23] greater than the kingdom of Egypt or the
[1:11:28] Empire of Egypt the ruler of the world
[1:11:32] the magnificence of Pharaoh was so
[1:11:37] magnificent their science their
[1:11:40] education their their geometry their
[1:11:44] mathematics their hieroglyphs everything
[1:11:48] that they were that Kingdom was so
[1:11:50] magnificent that they thought that
[1:11:53] Pharaoh
[1:11:54] was divine they thought he was dot they
[1:12:02] thought it had to be divinity manifested
[1:12:06] in the flesh now isn't it amazing that
[1:12:10] when God came in the flesh he took a man
[1:12:15] with a stick an outcast of their Kingdom
[1:12:25] claiming to be his son oh if the types
[1:12:33] and parallels just start really getting
[1:12:35] exciting if you wouldn't don't watch it
[1:12:38] you'll go off into Pere mala ji and all
[1:12:41] kinds of things like that but it's just
[1:12:43] there
[1:12:44] here's a rejected guy who used to be in
[1:12:47] the palaces of Pharaoh he comes back
[1:12:50] with a donkey behind him and a stick and
[1:12:57] goes up the ferrule and says let my
[1:13:00] people go and people look at this
[1:13:05] Pharaoh as he's divine the power he's
[1:13:11] got the might he's got the army he has
[1:13:14] but greater was he that was in Moses
[1:13:20] that he that was in the world you could
[1:13:25] take Joshua the realm explained it this
[1:13:32] way the creator himself was in Joshua
[1:13:39] that's why Joshua could say moon be a
[1:13:44] son be still that's why he could command
[1:13:49] what that he had because it was what was
[1:13:53] in Joshua that was greater than what was
[1:13:58] in the world the creator was in Joshua
[1:14:02] he was there he was in him you take day
[1:14:09] Daniel what was in Daniel was greater
[1:14:16] than the Lions what was in Daniel meant
[1:14:22] more to him than any position he could
[1:14:24] have any place in the world so what was
[1:14:30] greater what was in Daniel than what was
[1:14:34] in the world little children you are not
[1:14:38] of this world ye are of God let me say
[1:14:47] this to you before I read the scripture
[1:14:50] before there ever was a star there ever
[1:14:52] was a moon your names were putting on
[1:14:55] the Lamb's Book of Life you were in his
[1:14:57] thinking you were part of him before
[1:15:00] there ever was a world before I read
[1:15:03] this scripture I want you to have this
[1:15:06] understanding because by this revelation
[1:15:09] you can understand how the Creator was
[1:15:13] there David
[1:15:19] greater was what was in David the
[1:15:27] courage that David had to go out and
[1:15:32] meet Goliath that courage was in greater
[1:15:38] greater was that courage in David
[1:15:40] greater was the creation that was in
[1:15:43] David greater that what was in David
[1:15:47] than that which was in the world so
[1:15:50] there was something in David in him that
[1:15:54] was greater than he who is in the world
[1:15:57] no this is what I want to share because
[1:16:01] we don't know this is just a foretaste
[1:16:05] because this is just a little wake up
[1:16:08] for us to bring this back on the track
[1:16:11] to contend with ourselves to look at
[1:16:15] ourselves to recommit ourselves to read
[1:16:18] this brother branham said to get bullets
[1:16:20] straight clear
[1:16:21] blue sky you know fire religion that
[1:16:24] just cleans it all out a menace to make
[1:16:28] sure we're not hatched out of an
[1:16:30] incubator if to make sure that we know
[1:16:35] our Redeemer I thought that song was so
[1:16:37] perfect this morning I know my redeemer
[1:16:40] lives who hung the moon who long the
[1:16:45] Stars who did this that's my brother
[1:16:49] Graham said in the message this morning
[1:16:51] the world falling apart he says who was
[1:16:54] it that put all those stars and came the
[1:16:56] Sun what's hanging it there and he said
[1:16:59] that all those stars go in their cycle
[1:17:02] helping one another out I never knew
[1:17:07] they helped one another out what he said
[1:17:11] they all work together the invisible
[1:17:15] things of God are clearly seen in the
[1:17:18] visible things around it what was in
[1:17:25] David that gave him the courage
[1:17:27] something welled up in David that he
[1:17:34] went out there I believe he was willing
[1:17:39] to take the consequences of death versus
[1:17:45] submit to that lie he would die for the
[1:17:50] fact that God was the only living God
[1:17:54] but what was it and this is what I I
[1:17:58] hope that in your own private study and
[1:18:04] as you would go read this book because
[1:18:06] brother Graham talks about being on the
[1:18:08] mountain and speaking the storm and and
[1:18:10] that talking about the squirrels he said
[1:18:13] what was it when I just spoke those
[1:18:15] squirrels what do you have need of and
[1:18:17] he spoke this world and this is what I
[1:18:21] hope to see me that we can just look to
[1:18:25] we can take a moment and look what do we
[1:18:31] see
[1:18:33] when do we look I think now's the time
[1:18:36] to look what do we see when we look you
[1:18:38] take Moses you take Joshua you take
[1:18:41] Daniel you go all down to the scriptures
[1:18:43] you take Gideon you take all of those
[1:18:46] people greater what was in them then
[1:18:50] whatever challenge was before them and I
[1:19:01] wrote it to express it this way it
[1:19:03] wasn't God working from the outside it
[1:19:08] was God working from the inside they
[1:19:14] already had something in them because
[1:19:20] their name was put on the Lamb's Book of
[1:19:22] Life before the foundation of the world
[1:19:24] that seed of God was in them they
[1:19:27] overcame because he that was in them and
[1:19:31] where did that come from before there
[1:19:34] ever was a world before there ever was
[1:19:36] he put your name on the Lamb's Book of
[1:19:39] Life and he can no more deny that than
[1:19:43] anything that's what the Antichrist
[1:19:49] spirit will never confess it would never
[1:19:55] confess that it was what was in Moses
[1:19:59] that was greater they will always teach
[1:20:02] it was God working from the outside it
[1:20:04] was God working from the outside it's
[1:20:07] God working from the outside but that's
[1:20:09] not what he said he said why Christ
[1:20:14] because it's in you Christ in you is the
[1:20:21] hope of glory you say where does my
[1:20:25] salvation come from it comes from your
[1:20:28] name being put on the Lamb's Book of
[1:20:31] Life before the foundation of the world
[1:20:33] for God to be just and to manifest
[1:20:38] himself he paid the redemption price
[1:20:41] that was required he did that for mercy
[1:20:46] and that
[1:20:47] this place that he meets us he meets us
[1:20:49] under that shed blood but we always look
[1:20:53] at it God working from the outside God
[1:20:56] working from the outside but it wasn't
[1:20:59] God working from the outside it was God
[1:21:01] working from the inside what he put in
[1:21:04] you from the from the beginning in the
[1:21:07] Lamb's Book of Life the word came in
[1:21:10] quickened and made that word alive what
[1:21:17] happened
[1:21:18] David was moved on by the spirit what
[1:21:22] was in him was quickened up he went out
[1:21:25] and meant that that giant not afraid he
[1:21:29] had something in him that was ready to
[1:21:31] meet that giant he knew it was real
[1:21:36] Moses knew it was real speak speak what
[1:21:43] was it
[1:21:43] Joshua speed what do you have need up
[1:21:46] speak I like Josh well that angel shows
[1:21:51] jump rope pulls the sword and maybe
[1:21:54] ready to fight for God he said who are
[1:21:57] you enemy or foe he said I'm the angel
[1:22:01] come from the presence of God praise God
[1:22:03] there was something in Joshua where did
[1:22:07] that come from that came from the Lamb's
[1:22:09] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:22:12] the world
[1:22:13] it's got to be quickened rising of the
[1:22:17] Sun quicken quickening spirit quickening
[1:22:22] power we always look out and yet the
[1:22:31] very messenger of the hour because he
[1:22:33] can only speak this to the elect he said
[1:22:36] pray to Him who is within you it was
[1:22:45] greater than that who was in them then
[1:22:49] he was in the world
[1:22:51] greater is he that is in you you've got
[1:22:56] to look past your flesh sometimes
[1:22:58] and look to what the Word of God says
[1:23:00] about you you've got to take what's in
[1:23:05] you to defeat the flesh that's outside
[1:23:09] of you you got this thing from that
[1:23:17] other guy papa gotcha were divorced from
[1:23:22] this why because something else has come
[1:23:26] alive in us we know that he that is in
[1:23:29] us is greater than he was in the world
[1:23:33] even greater than this flesh that is in
[1:23:36] the world he that is in you can overcome
[1:23:39] your flesh blessed is he that overcometh
[1:23:42] because it's given to him to sit with me
[1:23:45] on my Father's throne
[1:23:50] you're the overcomer because it's not
[1:23:54] God from the outside it's God from the
[1:23:57] inside where did that come from it comes
[1:24:00] from the foundations of the beginning of
[1:24:03] the world and he cannot deny himself he
[1:24:09] that is in you he that is in you what
[1:24:14] was wonderful if you go back to read
[1:24:17] this book you hear Oberman talks about
[1:24:20] the burden that he was under and how he
[1:24:22] went and looked and and all the burden
[1:24:24] was under and all of a sudden this
[1:24:26] burden was lifted and he realized that
[1:24:31] it was he that was in him that he was
[1:24:35] made that he was created
[1:24:39] he was predestinated little children as
[1:24:43] many false spirits but anyone that
[1:24:48] denies that he's come in the flesh is
[1:24:52] Antichrist you cannot deny your origin
[1:24:59] you can't do it
[1:25:05] there is no way that any of us deserve
[1:25:08] salvation there is nothing we've done no
[1:25:13] works that we have it's not even it's
[1:25:17] not even our work
[1:25:21] it's him in us that was put there it's
[1:25:27] not always him working from the outside
[1:25:29] because God works from the inside out in
[1:25:36] everything he does you say what is faith
[1:25:41] God works by faith without faith it's
[1:25:44] impossible to please God faith is the
[1:25:46] evidence hope for things not yet seen
[1:25:48] it's an evidence it's something that's
[1:25:50] real prophet of God said it's something
[1:25:52] that you possess is something you have
[1:25:55] it's in there faith is a gift of God
[1:25:57] lest any man should boast
[1:25:59] it's in you it was put there the word
[1:26:04] comes and quickens that brings that to
[1:26:07] life then all of a sudden you feel the
[1:26:10] mop the member has said the muscles of
[1:26:12] faith will up and he just saw that big
[1:26:15] ol alley loop and he was just a big boo
[1:26:18] he was a fake because what was in him
[1:26:23] was greater than what was in the world
[1:26:29] may I say this it's like looking for the
[1:26:34] Hat on your head
[1:26:40] where's faith where's faith where faith
[1:26:42] it's here it's in me faith cometh by
[1:26:47] hearing hearing by the word of God
[1:26:51] understanding quickening power comes by
[1:26:54] the word of faith come here quickening
[1:26:57] and bringing what is in you to life then
[1:27:01] he that is in you is greater than he is
[1:27:03] in the world it's not always this
[1:27:05] approach it's God working from the
[1:27:08] outside God working from the outside
[1:27:10] Oh God when are you gonna get here
[1:27:16] I'm here we're sitting in heavenly
[1:27:21] places in Christ Jesus
[1:27:23] join heirs of the kingdom we're in
[1:27:28] fellowship we're together you say me
[1:27:33] yeah you
[1:27:36] how could he choose you
[1:27:38] I don't know heartlessly
[1:27:44] but praise God I know he did right I
[1:27:48] know he did I know there was an a man in
[1:27:53] my heart when I heard this message it
[1:27:57] was amen amen
[1:27:59] I didn't know nothing I wasn't Catholic
[1:28:01] to a core I had been reading my Bible
[1:28:05] but it was through my own eyeglasses
[1:28:07] and when I heard Christianity versus
[1:28:10] paganism and I heard that same voice
[1:28:13] that spoke to my heart I knew it was him
[1:28:15] and all that can wring out of my heart
[1:28:17] was a man a man a man even when it hurt
[1:28:21] it was a man and believe me that don't
[1:28:29] come from the flesh because I have
[1:28:35] stuck-up and proud and arrogant as
[1:28:38] anybody could be you couldn't tell me
[1:28:43] nothing
[1:28:44] I know sometimes I'm still like that but
[1:28:49] you did peep reign for me I'm working on
[1:28:52] it
[1:28:53] no that had to come from someplace else
[1:28:57] do you understand it had to be in you
[1:29:01] that's all he's doing
[1:29:03] he's resurrecting this message is
[1:29:09] resurrecting the creator in you it's
[1:29:18] bringing the realization of what that he
[1:29:22] put in you is greater than what's in the
[1:29:25] world what you possess in Christ Jesus
[1:29:28] will over
[1:29:29] anything he can throw at us bugs spirits
[1:29:34] laws rules whatever that's what I've got
[1:29:41] to be anchored to faith let that word
[1:29:47] reveal Christ in us what is the book of
[1:29:51] Revelation since the revelation of Jesus
[1:29:54] Christ
[1:29:55] it's him manifesting himself in the
[1:29:59] believer through the ages manifest
[1:30:02] brother brain just said he pulled them
[1:30:03] out of he manifested himself in
[1:30:05] justification pulled him out manifest
[1:30:08] their sanctification pulled him out put
[1:30:10] the gift of the spirit pulled him out in
[1:30:12] this last day he's got a bride on this
[1:30:15] earth and these two become one he that
[1:30:21] is on the inside is greater he that is
[1:30:26] in you the he that was in you is eternal
[1:30:31] if you have eternal life
[1:30:34] you always had eternal life oh how
[1:30:40] marvelous and what thrills me about this
[1:30:44] is that God always equips his people he
[1:30:51] said in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:30:53] if God could give us a better weapon he
[1:30:56] would but when he gave us was his word
[1:31:00] his promise not our intellectual
[1:31:06] interpretation of the Bible that's not
[1:31:08] the word his word is a promise it's the
[1:31:14] promised vindicated word that's our
[1:31:18] weapon our weapon is that what he says
[1:31:22] he does and that's why if he said he put
[1:31:26] our name on the Lamb's Book of Life and
[1:31:28] nothing can tape it off and nothing can
[1:31:31] put it on we can anchor our soul and our
[1:31:35] eternal destiny on those
[1:31:37] words we can say he that is in me is
[1:31:41] greater that's the part of us that's got
[1:31:44] to step up what's inside of us the word
[1:31:48] in us the God in us has got to meet the
[1:31:52] challenge we've got to stop just crying
[1:31:56] out two four four end up to come down
[1:32:01] come down come down when you got it in
[1:32:04] you to do something about it you've got
[1:32:06] it in you to make a stand you've got it
[1:32:09] in you to claim a promise it's like
[1:32:15] waiting for the bus when you're on it no
[1:32:24] I know the first thing that goes in your
[1:32:26] mind is your flesh why do you think he's
[1:32:31] going to do away with your flesh because
[1:32:34] he knows there's something else in there
[1:32:36] that he can veil with a new body a
[1:32:39] resurrected body but the off any body
[1:32:42] and eternal body of glorious an
[1:32:45] incorruptible body unbelief don't stop
[1:32:51] God oh I can just hear Billy Graham's
[1:32:58] head these are the sickest thing I know
[1:33:01] is the body of Christ
[1:33:06] what is sickness when something's not
[1:33:10] functioning the way it should function
[1:33:13] he's saying the body's not functioning
[1:33:16] the way it should function it's not
[1:33:19] acting you understand what he said it's
[1:33:22] Christ in you it's no longer you doing
[1:33:25] it it's Christ in you doing it it's what
[1:33:28] he put in there doing it it's what he
[1:33:30] said he would do it a greater is He that
[1:33:32] is in you greater is the word that he
[1:33:36] put in you before the foundations of the
[1:33:39] world that put you here to be that bride
[1:33:42] that any
[1:33:43] being the world's God and I believe it's
[1:33:49] coming the flesh this flesh and this
[1:33:53] flesh and this flex and this pride from
[1:33:55] this flesh and this flesh in this list I
[1:33:57] believe it's coming the flesh the
[1:34:01] Antichrist says it doesn't come into
[1:34:03] play but it has so great is he that is
[1:34:08] in you it can overcome yourself your own
[1:34:14] worst enemy it can bring your flesh
[1:34:17] under subjection you got a habit you got
[1:34:21] a burden you've got a weakness you've
[1:34:24] got a record that's all spotted out the
[1:34:28] very God that's in you can overcome
[1:34:32] blessed is he that overcometh he that is
[1:34:37] in us is great in the world
[1:34:39] do you understand he's equipped us for
[1:34:42] what's ahead he's given us the
[1:34:46] revelation to match the hour that was
[1:34:51] what his complaint to the church was he
[1:34:54] says what they're teaching will not
[1:34:56] match the challenge of the hour he says
[1:35:02] they don't have anything in them to
[1:35:05] believe with but there is an elect
[1:35:07] people who possessed something that was
[1:35:12] put there before the foundation of the
[1:35:15] world that he can't deny and he has got
[1:35:19] to quicken and bring it to life and
[1:35:22] vindicated and manifested it he
[1:35:25] vindicated and manifested in the prophet
[1:35:28] of the hour by speaking squirrel's by
[1:35:30] the three poles by doing what he was
[1:35:33] doing to show that if that's the first
[1:35:35] fruit then there's fruit coming after it
[1:35:39] [Music]
[1:35:42] when do we look
[1:35:47] when do we look what do you see when you
[1:35:52] look you see a victorious bride whose
[1:35:56] names written in the land but filled
[1:35:59] with the Holy Ghost able to perform
[1:36:01] God's Word or do you see some weakling
[1:36:16] the Prophet lived that himself he went
[1:36:22] through that himself he said him finally
[1:36:25] God got so I don't know the word I was
[1:36:29] going to use the word fed up but I don't
[1:36:32] know what God felt
[1:36:34] brother Branham knew he said why cry
[1:36:42] speak you were made for this you were
[1:36:47] created for this you were the word I
[1:36:51] made you I created you I called you I
[1:36:54] put you here that's good enough he can't
[1:37:01] deny himself he can't deny himself oh if
[1:37:10] you go back and read it what he said he
[1:37:13] said they're already rapturing they've
[1:37:18] already been pulled out now there's a
[1:37:21] last work that has to be done a people
[1:37:27] that he's vindicated that greater is He
[1:37:32] that is in us that's greater than he
[1:37:37] that is in the world he's equipped us
[1:37:43] for this challenge I don't even know all
[1:37:47] that's in there
[1:37:52] but I know one thing I've studied it for
[1:37:56] 20-some 40-some 50 some years not that
[1:38:11] I'm tired of hearing it I'll never be
[1:38:13] tired of hearing it
[1:38:14] if Billy Paul showed up here this
[1:38:16] afternoon and sat down and began to tell
[1:38:18] every one of those stories I'd be so
[1:38:20] thrilled I'd sit back then I'd listen to
[1:38:22] him over and over and over and over
[1:38:25] again and the shivers would go up and
[1:38:27] down my back and I just I loved it but I
[1:38:34] want to study it anymore I want it in me
[1:38:40] I know it's in me now Lord manifested in
[1:38:46] me bring it to life in me father your
[1:38:49] word promised it I faith I have faith in
[1:38:53] your word that you can live in me Amen
[1:38:56] light that's the exit this revelation is
[1:39:04] the exit he that is in you is greater
[1:39:08] than he was in the world if the same
[1:39:11] spirit that was in Christ Jesus
[1:39:13] dwelling you it will also quicken your
[1:39:16] mortal body are you a possessor of the
[1:39:20] Resurrection yes yes yeah I am you say I
[1:39:29] don't feel it it don't matter if you
[1:39:31] feel it he said so he puts your name on
[1:39:34] the lamb he wrote it there before the
[1:39:37] foundation of the world he that is in
[1:39:41] you is greater then he who's in the
[1:39:48] world oh if we could just get our self
[1:39:51] out of the picture it's no longer you
[1:39:56] that's doing it it's no longer you
[1:39:59] living its
[1:40:02] hey man maybe I've said enough but I'm
[1:40:06] telling you when I thought of he that is
[1:40:09] in you I thought what are you afraid of
[1:40:15] I love the way he says it
[1:40:17] what are you afraid of the world like
[1:40:23] the world's just nothing you know what I
[1:40:26] mean it's late you ever seen somebody
[1:40:29] just go hysterical over a mouse give me

[1:41:01] are you worried about a little mouthful
[1:41:05] it's imagination vain imaginations it's
[1:41:10] the battle in your mind why because we
[1:41:13] don't look when do we look at the word
[1:41:21] when do we look when are we gonna look
[1:41:24] at the word when are we gonna look at
[1:41:26] this message where are we going to creep
[1:41:28] quit treating it like history when are
[1:41:31] we gonna quit looking at it as a
[1:41:33] finished work the message was a spoken
[1:41:36] word that was going to speak a bride
[1:41:38] into existence our messenger even said
[1:41:47] his work wasn't finished at Calvary it
[1:41:50] was to finish up in this aim
[1:41:55] what what you know what are we afraid of
[1:42:00] when are we gonna look when are we going
[1:42:05] to finally sit back and say what is this
[1:42:07] message saying what is it telling me why
[1:42:12] do we continually treat it like history
[1:42:15] when it is living living living word its
[1:42:21] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:42:24] and forever performing every promise
[1:42:27] he's ever spoken it's real word it's
[1:42:33] real and if he's real you're real if
[1:42:44] your names on the book and you have

[1:43:13] the end greater is He that is in you
[1:43:17] then as in the world we talked this
[1:43:20] morning about the mental attitude of
[1:43:24] this virus and and this world system
[1:43:28] trying to rob us from the leadership of
[1:43:34] the Holy Spirit
[1:43:35] well let's don't let the virus of our
[1:43:38] flesh and the virus of our personality
[1:43:43] and the virus of our upbringing and the
[1:43:46] virus of our backgrounds rob us from the
[1:43:49] spoken promises of God that were
[1:43:52] revealed to us in this last day by the
[1:43:55] manifestation of Malachi 4:5
[1:43:57] Luke 17 30 revelations 10 seven and God
[1:44:01] Emmanuel Jesus Christ in the Ministry of
[1:44:04] the Son of Man
[1:44:06] hailing himself in the veil of a profit
[1:44:08] that a people could look past the veil
[1:44:11] and see the unveiling of God through the
[1:44:14] veil that he was veiled in and
[1:44:18] understand what he's trying to tell us
[1:44:22] you say brother David you don't know
[1:44:25] I've just got a terrible problem with
[1:44:27] lust he that is in you is greater than
[1:44:30] that problem I've got a terrible temper
[1:44:33] he that is in you is greater than that
[1:44:36] temple I'm full of jealousy I just get
[1:44:39] so jealous I can feel it in my body I
[1:44:41] can feel it I get so nervous I bit so
[1:44:44] broke down stop look away look away what
[1:44:51] do you see when you look you see the
[1:44:55] promise word standing there you see a
[1:44:58] pillar of fire telling you a pillar of
[1:45:03] fire telling you your name's on the book
[1:45:06] nothing can pluck you out of my hand if
[1:45:09] I started to work on you I will finish
[1:45:12] it I will not leave you nor forsake you
[1:45:15] my sheep hear my voice and another they
[1:45:18] won't follow what do you see when you
[1:45:21] look you see yourself that's the most
[1:45:27] pathetic thing you can look at is
[1:45:29] yourself
[1:45:30] I like when brother Branham said I'm I I
[1:45:37] may be mad I didn't know if he meant mad
[1:45:40] like crazy or mad like angry I don't
[1:45:45] know how they interpreted that one but I
[1:45:49] get so mad sometimes I could just spit
[1:45:58] can you imagine if that's what I looked
[1:46:00] at I'd go home and I get me and some of
[1:46:07] those cotton lint sheets and just curl
[1:46:11] up in a ball not even go outside no more
[1:46:15] I wouldn't face it no more no but
[1:46:21] there's something on the inside little
[1:46:24] Brook why are you happy because the deer
[1:46:30] drink because the flowers grow because
[1:46:37] I'm here no he said I'm happy because
[1:46:40] there's something in me that pushes up
[1:46:43] you hate haven't you experienced it when
[1:46:47] you have done evil and you are defeated
[1:46:52] and deflated and discouraged and you're
[1:46:59] full of guilt and you're full of shame
[1:47:03] and you think everybody knows what
[1:47:08] you've done every I and the church is on
[1:47:11] you that little thump on the inside
[1:47:14] would just start thumping I want God I
[1:47:17] want to be forgiven I don't want to go I
[1:47:21] don't want to quit where can I go that
[1:47:26] alone has the words of eternal life it
[1:47:29] just starts working its way like the
[1:47:32] grass under the concrete it's going to
[1:47:34] work its way it's going to work its way
[1:47:36] why it is in you Christ in you is the
[1:47:42] hope of glory it's not you got the glory
[1:47:49] now Christ is in you know it was because
[1:47:54] Christ was seeing you well you were yet
[1:47:56] a sinner that's where the glory was he

[1:48:18] apart because nothing is going to pluck
[1:48:20] them out of the palm of his hand he is
[1:48:22] going to finish this work he is going to
[1:48:25] redeem everybody whose name is on that
[1:48:26] book he's going to love them till the
[1:48:29] end he'll never forsake him he'll never
[1:48:31] leave him even the scripture says he
[1:48:34] loved his own which were in the world
[1:48:36] and he loved them until the end go back
[1:48:40] and read Saint John 17 and run around

[1:48:45] glory of God father that may may be one
