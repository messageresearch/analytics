[20:14] and the request we had this

[20:20] house of the Lord you should always come
[20:21] with the request on your heart for
[20:24] something you want the Lord to meet you
[20:25] with that's what the prophet taught us
[20:29] and trust that when the word Goes Forth
[20:32] that that need that you have will be
[20:37] met
[20:39] Hallelujah we ask brother clever to come
[20:41] and take these needs and the brothers
[20:45] come with the tithes and offerings and
[20:47] if you have request on your heart and
[20:49] you want to make it known to the Lord by
[20:51] the uplifting of your hands do so and
[20:54] trust that he sees it
[20:59] [Music]
[21:03] let us
[21:05] pray gracious Heavenly Father we thank
[21:07] you for the opportunity to be here once
[21:09] again your word tells us wherever two or
[21:12] three are gathered in my name I will be
[21:14] there and Lord we visit one another's
[21:18] houses to fellowship with each other but
[21:21] here Lord we're here not to see each
[21:23] other but to have an audience with thee
[21:26] and as our brother was saying we've been
[21:28] taught to come with expectation and
[21:30] father just like the expectation of
[21:33] those of old your Holy Spirit brought us
[21:35] here by the
[21:37] leadership um of the holy spirit in each
[21:40] one Lord for a reason so we pray even
[21:43] for each of the requests Lord the
[21:47] brother diagnosed with cancer brother
[21:49] John father cancer is something maybe
[21:54] humans May fear but Lord to you it's
[21:56] just a devil and the word tells you can
[21:59] cast them with your flick of your finger
[22:00] and so Lord we don't come in fear or we
[22:04] pray that the spirit of fear may be Cast
[22:06] Away from a brother that he may come
[22:08] forth believing and knowing Lord that
[22:11] we're encompassed about with a great
[22:13] cloud of witnesses in this day that
[22:15] you're a God Lord that cancer is no
[22:17] match for thee and so we pray Lord even

[36:50] Lamb Lord and that you could oh god

[36:55] these times Lord that even like we've
[36:57] heard the this morning Lord that we just
[36:58] want to draw closer to you Lord we pray
[37:01] you'd come now tonight Lord and use
[37:03] these little words of inspiration Lord
[37:07] that it can go right to the heart of the
[37:10] believer and that they could drive back
[37:12] the enemy that's trying to keep them
[37:14] from serving you with all of their heart
[37:17] father we just trust them into your care
[37:20] we pray blessings oh God on them and our
[37:23] pastor our brother Billy the different
[37:25] ones that couldn't make it tonight Lord
[37:27] pray you'd be their portion tonight as
[37:29] we commit ourselves to your great hand
[37:32] we love you and we thank you for this
[37:34] time that we can worship and praise you
[37:36] by fulfilling your word in Jesus Christ
[37:38] name amen praise the Lord if you have
[37:41] your Bibles we'll just go right to a
[37:42] little scripture thought and you know as
[37:44] I was thinking of the sermon this
[37:47] morning it brought me to a thought about
[37:50] remembering God's crowning
[37:53] achievements it's it's something very
[37:55] special when you think about what the
[37:56] prophet you know the the different
[37:59] things that he endured the different
[38:01] things that he suffered and through the
[38:02] different examples when you can see you
[38:05] know how Christians believers they
[38:07] suffered for things we want to bring
[38:10] into our mind and remember these great
[38:13] things that God did through these lives
[38:15] because then we can identify the very
[38:17] things that we're going through the
[38:19] struggles the sufferings it's for a
[38:21] purpose that God has a crowning
[38:23] achievement that he's accomplishing in
[38:24] each and every one of your lives you
[38:26] believe that
[38:28] God is working his purpose in every one
[38:30] of our lives and because the seed of God
[38:32] is inside of your heart the only thing
[38:35] that really can draw that out is certain
[38:38] circumstances and situations that cause
[38:41] it's the distress like I love that about
[38:43] Jesus being in the ship it wasn't until
[38:46] the the storm came that actually the
[38:48] believer called upon him in the distress
[38:51] amen so we don't realize the potentials
[38:53] of God a lot of times until we get to
[38:55] the end of ourselves amen well we just
[38:58] thank God for the seed of God that and
[39:01] when the storms come it brings the very
[39:03] life of the seed to the surface we love
[39:05] that amen and I just trust that the Lord
[39:08] will give us a little bit of direction
[39:10] here
[39:11] cuz oh my you know we got about five
[39:15] minutes worth and we just know that
[39:17] God's able to multiply the Loaves and
[39:20] Fishes
[39:21] amen so if you just want to go to me
[39:23] with me to Leviticus uh chapter 23 we're
[39:27] just going to
[39:27] you know one of the things that I think
[39:29] that happens for us as end time
[39:31] Believers is every time we read the
[39:33] scripture or we go into have a service
[39:35] we're remembering what God achieved
[39:38] through Malachi 4 and what that was to
[39:40] do for us an achievement that was going
[39:43] to restore our faith right and so in
[39:45] Malachi it talks about remembering the
[39:47] law of Moses what he commanded and so
[39:49] this is a beautiful scripture I love
[39:51] this and this is in
[39:53] Leviticus 23 and we'll just start in um
[39:57] verse verse 28 Leviticus 23 and 28 it
[40:02] says this there and ye shall do no work
[40:05] in that same
[40:07] day for this is the day of atonement to
[40:10] make an atonement for you before the
[40:13] Lord your
[40:14] God for whatsoever so it be that shall
[40:19] not be afflicted in that same day he
[40:23] shall be cut off from among his people
[40:26] and whatsoever so it be that doeth the
[40:29] work in that same day doeth any work in
[40:31] that same day that Soul shall the soul
[40:35] will I destroy from among the people
[40:37] amen we're also going to read over in
[40:39] Timothy second
[40:53] Timothy you know I think about the
[40:55] Affliction of the soul is to be burdened
[40:58] for lost souls whenever you've met the
[41:01] Lord whenever you've come in contact
[41:03] with his presence and has changed your
[41:06] life there's got to be a Life of Christ
[41:09] that wants to go out and seek that's
[41:11] what is lost
[41:12] [Music]
[41:13] Amen in second Timothy Chapter 2 it says
[41:18] this thou therefore my son be strong in
[41:22] the grace that is in Christ Jesus you
[41:26] may have your seeds
[41:28] we trust the Lord will add a blessing to
[41:30] the reading of his word and you know I
[41:32] just got to thinking about it if if
[41:34] we're going to be Crown if we're going
[41:35] to be capped with something at the end
[41:38] time it's going to be something that the
[41:39] prophet said we were going to be capped
[41:41] with amen if you look around and you see
[41:44] in this world a lot of people are so
[41:46] consumed and so full of things of this
[41:49] world or themselves that they don't have
[41:52] time to slow down and smell the roses or
[41:54] even look over at you to see if you have
[41:56] a need amen but I thank God that there's
[41:59] a people that God has placed this true
[42:02] love this Divine love of God in their
[42:04] heart amen and not not anybody has the
[42:08] privilege or the ability to project this
[42:10] kind of love it takes the seat of God it
[42:14] takes those who have been predestinated
[42:17] by God
[42:18] Amen we got to thinking about you know
[42:21] this this crowning that we're going to
[42:23] talk a little bit about tonight is is
[42:26] something that that happens in a
[42:28] forsaking time you know and I'll be
[42:30] drawing a little bit of inspiration from
[42:33] a sermon that brother Brandon preach
[42:35] called remembering the Lord and it's one
[42:38] of these things that you know communion
[42:41] is to talk to you know and a lot of
[42:43] times when we come to communion you know
[42:46] we we know that it's an ordinance of God
[42:48] we know that we're called to obedience
[42:50] and different things but a lot of times
[42:52] we don't take the time to stop I don't
[42:54] take the time to stop down and recognize
[42:57] you know communion is you know we lay
[42:59] our burdens down we tell God all the
[43:01] things that we're going through and the
[43:03] struggles and how we want him to help us
[43:05] and and we speak all of those things but
[43:08] I believe communion is more than that I
[43:10] believe communion is a time where we can
[43:13] speak those things and then we can be
[43:14] still I love how brother Jeremy when he
[43:16] was preaching there was a time to slow
[43:18] down I think there's times for us to
[43:20] slow down and get down and let the Lord
[43:22] speak back I think that sometimes I do
[43:24] too much of the talking and and we find
[43:27] that we are prone to this we do all the
[43:29] talking and we constantly it's just a
[43:32] one-way street but I believe that God
[43:34] wants to have a true communion with us
[43:36] amen that's part of the calling of a
[43:38] Christian is to hear back from God we
[43:41] don't serve a wooden or a dead God we
[43:43] serve a God that's living he's present
[43:45] he wants to speak to us he wants to deal
[43:48] with our individual cases he's not
[43:50] concerned just so much of a whole system
[43:52] of man but he wants to deal with hearts
[43:54] amen because he wants to reveal himself
[43:57] and make the light of the gospel live
[43:59] amen that's the god that we serve that's
[44:02] the god that we're looking for tonight
[44:04] to come and speak to us amen but you
[44:06] think about this in Timothy he says be
[44:10] strong in the grace that is in Christ
[44:12] now you know sometimes I think people
[44:14] get excited when they're coming up young
[44:16] people when you get to a place where you
[44:18] know you start saving all your coins and
[44:20] your alls and then all of a sudden you
[44:22] get a bank account all of a sudden you
[44:24] got this bank account and sure enough
[44:26] you get access access to those funds
[44:28] when you get like a a little ATM card or
[44:30] something all of a sudden you're getting
[44:32] man I'm starting to give responsibility
[44:33] I can go out and make some purchases now
[44:36] but you know that card is not good until
[44:38] you activate it amen that that card you
[44:41] can flaunt it all the way around and you
[44:44] can go and try to make a purchase but
[44:45] it'll be declined if you don't activate
[44:47] it I love it because that makes me think
[44:49] about this scripture it says be strong
[44:52] in the grace of God that's in Jesus
[44:54] Christ if we're ever going to be
[44:56] effectual with the gospel it's got to be
[44:59] the grace of Jesus Christ amen it's not
[45:02] because of our good works amen it's
[45:04] because we've gone back and recognized
[45:06] the achievement in our lives it was by
[45:08] grace are you saved through faith amen
[45:11] it was the grace of God that met us so
[45:13] if we're going to have a an effectual
[45:15] working of a lasting achievement that
[45:18] God crowns our life it's going to be
[45:19] Grace Grace amen that's what the prophet
[45:22] said that this end time bride is going
[45:24] to be calling out Grace Grace and it's
[45:26] not just uh quoting scripture but it's
[45:29] going to be our actions it's going to be
[45:31] other people saying that life that
[45:33] impacted me was just nothing but Grace
[45:36] Grace amen does isn't that your heart's
[45:38] desire to commune with God in this kind
[45:40] of
[45:41] relationship it was it was Grace Grace
[45:44] it it was coming and going amen it
[45:46] wasn't just me the recipient of Grace
[45:48] but it was me giving Grace oh my thank
[45:51] God for the love of God
[45:54] Amen my
[45:58] we want to remember the power source you
[46:00] know and just go back to it sometimes I
[46:03] think like brother Matthew was preaching
[46:04] this morning sometimes we forget things
[46:07] right and we just want to remember I was
[46:09] thinking about it earlier today I want
[46:11] to remember you know when you place a
[46:13] vow before God and God comes to you and
[46:16] it's so personal when you first start
[46:18] walking with the Lord you remember oh
[46:20] how sweet and precious everything was
[46:22] just smooth and oh my you just and you
[46:25] were on cloud n as it were and and then
[46:28] you know you go through it for a while
[46:31] and and it kind of becomes dull and you
[46:33] you have to remember the achievement of
[46:36] God in your life amen I remember when I
[46:39] was on my deathbed I told the Lord I
[46:41] said you know I will serve you all the
[46:44] rest of my days no more arguing you know
[46:47] what kind of behavior I would conduct
[46:49] myself with if I forgot
[46:51] that that's good to commune with God and
[46:54] to go back sometimes and remember
[46:57] you know what God had achieved in my
[46:59] life sometimes we get going on one way
[47:01] and one angle and then all of a sudden
[47:03] it's almost like we feel like we've done
[47:05] something but oh my if we can go back
[47:07] and remember I am a workmanship of God
[47:12] this is God's hand of workmanship in
[47:14] your life and we want to remember this
[47:16] is what God is crowning us with you know
[47:19] when you think about he was the lamb
[47:21] slain before the foundation of the world
[47:24] and today we're the people of God
[47:26] because God God had a work in our lives
[47:29] it was the grace of God praise be to God
[47:33] for this wonderful choosing and just
[47:36] read a little bit here
[47:38] in in that second per that second verse
[47:42] it says and the things that thou has
[47:44] heard of me among many witnesses the
[47:47] same commit to Faithful Men Who Shall
[47:50] teach who shall be able to teach also
[47:53] others thou therefore endure hardness
[47:57] as a good soldier of Jesus
[48:01] Christ no man that Warth entangle
[48:06] himself with the
[48:08] Affairs of this life that he may please
[48:12] him who have chosen him as a good
[48:15] soldier you know I I like that the this
[48:18] the reference there on chosen it says
[48:21] enlisted you know and and that's another
[48:23] thing I think that it's important for us
[48:25] to recognize is that we've been enlisted
[48:27] to fight we've been enlisted to be a
[48:30] soldier of the Cross and we want to
[48:33] commune and recognize we're just
[48:35] pilgrims here amen and there is going to
[48:38] be a hardness that we want to endure
[48:41] according to the word of God as he's
[48:43] admonishing us Amen to to endure the
[48:46] hardness as a good soldier you know and
[48:49] I think if if we look at that verse 5 it
[48:52] says if if a man if a man also strive
[48:57] for Mastery yet he is not crowned except
[49:01] he strive lawfully for the husbandman
[49:04] that labor must be first partaker of his
[49:09] fruits you know I think about you know
[49:12] someone who would perform in different
[49:14] things and but they never were crowned
[49:16] you know they didn't strive lawfully but
[49:19] you know I I think about what a crown
[49:21] represents a crown represents
[49:24] identification a crown represents a
[49:26] certain an achievement and I just think
[49:28] about the admonition that you know
[49:31] Paul's giving Timothy and I think it's a
[49:33] consideration you know that we must take
[49:36] is you know we don't want to be
[49:37] entangled with the things of the world
[49:40] because this world is perishing at such
[49:42] a rapid Pace you know we realize all of
[49:44] the demise of the world is because man
[49:46] is taken of the tree of knowledge of
[49:48] Good and Evil and here we are it just
[49:51] seems like the ball has rolling so fast
[49:54] they they cannot stop it man destroys
[49:57] himself by his knowledge amen and it's
[50:00] not God's desire that any man would
[50:02] perish but that all would come to the
[50:04] saving knowledge of the Lord
[50:07] Jesus my think about it the husbandman
[50:10] that labor must be first a partaker of
[50:14] his fruits you think just like what
[50:16] brother Matthew was saying there's a lot
[50:17] of times like yeah I I remember brother
[50:20] brandom saying in the sermon and I'm
[50:22] paraphrasing but there wasn't one
[50:25] crosseyed girl that came through the
[50:27] prayer line that wasn't healed oh you
[50:30] think about it I there you know I was
[50:32] thinking about this um they have this
[50:34] particular tree and I'll butcher the
[50:37] name if I try to say it and maybe I'll
[50:39] say it but it's like an Argo wood or
[50:42] something like that and some of you may
[50:43] have heard of it but this tree is very
[50:46] rare now especially because they found
[50:48] that it's when it's been bruised or it
[50:52] has some kind of infection that starts
[50:55] uh happening with in the tree it creates
[50:59] um some kind of oil out of the tree that
[51:02] they extract and it's the most valuable
[51:05] fragrance this is like a precious
[51:09] ointment and I'm telling you that's the
[51:13] same thing that happens for a Believer
[51:15] amen you go through different sufferings
[51:18] you think about what Christ suffered
[51:21] when he was bruised it squeezed out of
[51:24] him something so precious and I just you
[51:27] know I want to say something tonight
[51:29] that will encourage your heart as a
[51:30] Believer the things that you're going
[51:32] through you might not recognize the
[51:35] suffering but God's recognizing it God
[51:38] knows that he can use that he can take
[51:40] that and it can be a sweet smelling
[51:42] Savor to somebody who's in need they can
[51:45] see I'm going through a battle and I
[51:47] seen that you know what you're going
[51:49] through same stuff I'm going through
[51:52] what is the hope that you have oh then
[51:55] you know I think it's something you know
[51:57] God he said in his word that we were
[52:00] made Kings and Priests unto our God you
[52:02] know and and a king you know he's been
[52:05] given authority over a kingdom and a
[52:08] priest is to make intercession so when
[52:10] you've been called as a king and priest
[52:14] when you see this suffering and you see
[52:16] this need and you know what it's like
[52:18] you've been there it's not like you're
[52:20] just talking a bunch of theology you've
[52:23] been there and then all of a sudden you
[52:25] don't have to go and write all the the
[52:26] wrong but a priest starts making
[52:28] intercession a priest starts praying and
[52:31] and really taking that burden upon the
[52:33] heart amen and that's when we see the
[52:36] God of all power come on the scene amen
[52:40] isn't that wonderful to be called the
[52:42] Sons and Daughters of God Kings and
[52:45] Priests unto our God
[52:47] my
[52:50] my my I just think
[52:53] about we'll skip down a little bit there
[52:57] says consider what I say and this is in
[53:01] verse
[53:02] 7 the Lord give thee understanding in
[53:05] all things remember that Jesus Christ of
[53:08] the seed of David was raised from the
[53:10] dead according to my gospel wherein I
[53:13] suffered trouble as an evildoer even
[53:17] unto bonds but the word of God is not
[53:21] bound therefore I will endure all things
[53:24] for the elect's sake that they may also
[53:27] obtain the Salvation which is in Christ
[53:29] Jesus with eternal glory for this is a
[53:33] faithful saying for if we be dead with
[53:37] him we shall also live with him if we
[53:40] suffer we shall reign with him if we
[53:43] deny him he also will deny us amen he
[53:48] says if we believe not yet he abideth
[53:52] faithful he cannot deny himself for
[53:55] these things put them in remembrance
[53:58] charging them before the Lord that
[54:01] strive not about words to no profit to
[54:06] the subverting of the
[54:08] hearers
[54:10] amen and this right here is where we're
[54:13] getting to in in 19 nevertheless the
[54:16] foundation of God standeth sure having
[54:19] this seal the Lord knoweth them that are
[54:23] his and let everyone that nameth the
[54:26] name name of Christ depart from
[54:29] iniquity amen you know iniquity has two
[54:33] sides
[54:34] right how many knows what iniquity
[54:38] is praise God you know iniquity is to do
[54:43] to know something's wrong and do it
[54:44] anyway right and then on the other side
[54:47] it's to know to do right and refuse to
[54:50] do it right and so what he's he's
[54:53] admonishing us if there's things that
[54:55] we're doing wrong
[54:57] or that we know that's right we're not
[54:59] doing just depart from the
[55:02] iniquity but in the great house there is
[55:05] not only vessels of gold and of silver
[55:08] but also of wood and of Earth and some
[55:11] honor and some to
[55:13] dishonor if a man therefore purges
[55:16] himself from these he shall be a vessel
[55:19] of Honor Sanctified meat for the
[55:23] Master's use prepared unto every good
[55:26] work work oh I love that so much cuz I
[55:29] feel like that's the believer's cry
[55:30] that's what I identify with I want to be
[55:33] uh something in the Master's Hand
[55:35] prepared and fit for his use and I
[55:38] believe that's what communion is about I
[55:41] think communion is a time to talk it
[55:43] over things that we may know that we're
[55:46] not doing that you know we need to do or
[55:48] things that we're doing this is a time
[55:50] to clear all and get a clean slate to to
[55:53] ask the Lord that I'm going to remember
[55:55] the achievement that you had when you
[55:57] died on the cross of Calvary I I I I
[56:00] need to come into this greater
[56:01] Fellowship you know one that there's
[56:03] nothing hindering nothing in between
[56:06] amen that I can know that I'm connected
[56:08] to God not just connected to God but
[56:11] connected to his people connected to the
[56:13] people of this world that I can be a
[56:15] Shining Light I don't want to be so just
[56:18] in my mind Heavenly bound that I forget
[56:21] that I'm to be a witness amen that's
[56:24] what communion is about is go into all
[56:27] the world and preach the gospel Amen to
[56:30] know you know I remember that when I
[56:33] laid hands on the sick they recovered
[56:35] praise God he's the same we look around
[56:38] we see all kinds of darkness and
[56:40] sickness but oh my he's the same he
[56:42] doesn't change
[56:44] amen praise the lord we can be meat for
[56:49] the Master's use prepared unto every
[56:52] good work Hallelujah
[56:56] you know I
[56:57] was thinking about in that message
[57:02] remembering the Lord
[57:04] and I think this is in paragraph
[57:09] 27 says this of
[57:13] course this we read this is a communion
[57:19] service and he says do this in
[57:23] remembrance of
[57:24] me now
[57:26] communion has many times been a great
[57:29] dispute down the ages between Protestant
[57:33] and
[57:35] Catholic they say the Catholic takes
[57:37] this communion and they take it in hopes
[57:41] that they have did something to Merit
[57:44] some good thing and that their sins will
[57:47] be forgiven by doing it
[57:51] my you know and and I would say this
[57:54] that's that thing is it locks into the
[57:57] subconscious of Believers like I'm doing
[58:00] this to Merit some good thing you know
[58:03] but that's you know this is the other
[58:05] thing he says the Protestant taking it
[58:08] it is in remembrance that Christ has
[58:11] already forgiven me and I take it in
[58:15] rejoicing that he's already forgiven me
[58:19] you're forgiven amen praise
[58:23] God Paul goes on to say how that they
[58:27] should come to the Lord if there be
[58:28] anything wrong make it right before we
[58:32] get there for he that eateth and
[58:36] drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh
[58:39] Damnation to himself not Discerning the
[58:41] Lord's body and now we are very very
[58:45] much to be in prayer when we take
[58:49] communion
[58:51] my but I wonder many times if that work
[58:56] word we use it just right
[59:01] communion now communion means to talk to
[59:05] to commune with I wonder if we really
[59:08] when we meet together like in these
[59:10] Heavenly places if it isn't
[59:13] communion that we are communion with God
[59:16] and talking to
[59:19] him and then if we just sit still and
[59:22] let him answer back many things and one
[59:26] horrible thing that I do I try to do all
[59:30] the
[59:30] talking and not set still
[59:34] enough for him to answer me back oh my
[59:38] you know it just I tell you it runs down
[59:40] into my heart conviction you know how
[59:42] much really I need to pray like this you
[59:45] know I love the the word of God and how
[59:48] the message just brings instruction and
[59:50] Clarity and how we can commune with God
[59:52] we don't have all this figured out right
[59:54] we're on a journey together amen I thank
[59:57] the Lord for the message
[1:00:04] Amen in 32 it says sometimes I did that
[1:00:09] and my whole opinion changed you see I'd
[1:00:12] go to him and say Lord now these people
[1:00:15] they really they've got something and I
[1:00:17] believe I want to go over there and I
[1:00:19] just started praying and the first thing
[1:00:21] you know I just satisfied that it's the
[1:00:23] Lord's will but after I pray if I just
[1:00:26] linger a little while see then it's
[1:00:29] changed altogether some sometimes since
[1:00:33] somewhere else just commune with the
[1:00:35] Lord oh what a glorious Fellowship just
[1:00:39] get down and talk and commune and wait
[1:00:41] for him to talk back my what a precious
[1:00:45] word amen and I think of what a great
[1:00:49] person and to think what a great person
[1:00:53] that you are talking to the Creator
[1:00:55] himself
[1:00:56] communing with him who put life in that
[1:01:00] volcanic ash that you're living in and
[1:01:03] then Som day you'll have to leave there
[1:01:06] and then it's in his hands where you're
[1:01:08] going to go there
[1:01:10] on and you have the privilege now to
[1:01:13] make your choice which way the soul goes
[1:01:17] when it leaves my
[1:01:20] my and what a wonderful thing to commune
[1:01:23] with him upon the basis of his his
[1:01:27] promises then hear him commune back to
[1:01:30] you and say it is all well my that
[1:01:34] really expresses it right we don't have
[1:01:37] to look to any Creed we don't have to
[1:01:39] look to any dogmas the only thing that
[1:01:42] we have to do is just know that he
[1:01:44] Witnesses back his word and that's
[1:01:47] settled and that's all of it then the
[1:01:49] burdens roll away oh my I thank the Lord
[1:01:53] for that kind of ability to remember you
[1:01:57] know what I'm talking to the Lord you
[1:02:00] know and he's made these promises amen
[1:02:03] that's what our fellowship is and then I
[1:02:05] got to thinking about you know it's when
[1:02:08] you look back at the examples of
[1:02:11] different individuals like the woman at
[1:02:13] the well you know how that she was
[1:02:16] living and all her immorality and God
[1:02:19] came her way and saw so fit to deal with
[1:02:23] her and she was all broke up about the
[1:02:26] traditions of the elders and you know
[1:02:29] all the different difficulties in her
[1:02:31] relationships but one day she came to a
[1:02:34] fountain amen and at that Fountain she
[1:02:37] met the one that changed everything she
[1:02:40] actually came to a different Fountain
[1:02:42] amen and that's the fountain I'm
[1:02:45] pointing to tonight I want to remember
[1:02:48] that God opened up the door and made a
[1:02:50] way that we can draw from the fountain
[1:02:53] every single day not just at communion
[1:02:56] service but every day we can go to the
[1:02:58] Fountain and refresh oursel and God can
[1:03:01] speak back to us we can go and say God I
[1:03:03] need a drink I'm going through something
[1:03:06] I have this condition I have this
[1:03:08] problem but I know that I've gotten a
[1:03:11] drink from this Fountain before I want
[1:03:13] to talk it over with you will you talk
[1:03:15] back to me amen that's the kind of God
[1:03:19] that we serve one that spoke to her and
[1:03:21] said you know it changed her whole world
[1:03:23] after that time she began to say you
[1:03:26] know it was totally illegal for her in
[1:03:29] that condition being a prostitute to
[1:03:32] even be showing up but you know what
[1:03:35] because she had a different source of
[1:03:37] power because Grace had met her she came
[1:03:39] to a place where she realized come see a
[1:03:42] man who's told me all that I've have
[1:03:44] done amen he's given me something that I
[1:03:47] can rejoice in something that I know
[1:03:49] that it's not just some outside Source
[1:03:51] but there's something on the inside I
[1:03:53] can't help it I can't hold back amen I
[1:03:57] got to tell somebody about this Fountain
[1:04:00] it's a fountain of life amen she wasn't
[1:04:03] ashamed of that Source amen and then I
[1:04:07] thought you know about
[1:04:09] um you know Hagar my goodness Hagar you
[1:04:14] know can you imagine she's just a slave
[1:04:17] you know Abraham's wife uh Sarah said
[1:04:20] yeah go ahead and take you know Hagar
[1:04:23] and here Hagar is she's just doing what
[1:04:25] she's told told she's just following the
[1:04:27] order and you know at that time polygamy
[1:04:29] was totally legal so she's just carrying
[1:04:33] on with what her master was telling her
[1:04:35] so she goes and she ends up having this
[1:04:38] child and all of the sudden now you know
[1:04:41] things happen and she's like now she's
[1:04:44] all of the sudden you know facing this
[1:04:47] uh it's like a a putting out you know
[1:04:51] and here here she is now she has to go
[1:04:54] and she's just going down the way and
[1:04:57] you can read the the testimony of her
[1:04:59] life but she comes to a place where her
[1:05:02] child ishmail they came to a place they
[1:05:04] were in a desert land you know they're
[1:05:08] sand can you imagine being in the desert
[1:05:10] and all the sudden you know the the baby
[1:05:13] that you know it was totally lawful what
[1:05:16] she had you know but she was put out and
[1:05:18] all of the sudden you know she's out in
[1:05:20] the middle of nowhere
[1:05:22] perishing but oh my think that she she
[1:05:25] came to a place where she just laid that
[1:05:28] baby down and went down somewhere and
[1:05:29] kned down and all of a sudden she began
[1:05:32] to cry out and you know it was a place
[1:05:35] that was like so dry you know rocks and
[1:05:38] sand and different things but she saw in
[1:05:40] Old waste amen she came to a place where
[1:05:43] God spoke to her amen that was the cry
[1:05:46] she was praying and God spoke back and
[1:05:49] then she began to say that this is a
[1:05:51] living God who sees me amen and there
[1:05:54] has opened up a well that supposedly
[1:05:56] today is still open as a testimony that
[1:06:00] God still cares for the perishing when
[1:06:02] there's no water he said I am the
[1:06:04] fountain come unto me amen so you think
[1:06:07] about this Hagar and she has a memorial
[1:06:11] God crowned her with this Fountain can
[1:06:14] you imagine to realize that God has
[1:06:17] crowned us with a Fountain of Life I
[1:06:20] mean we had nothing but death we we were
[1:06:23] perishing the only destiny that we had
[1:06:26] was a grave we couldn't Hope For Nothing
[1:06:28] past that we couldn't see past that but
[1:06:31] oh my when he took the keys of death
[1:06:33] hell in the grave and he opened up the
[1:06:35] way amen we have something to look back
[1:06:38] and recognize this was an achievement of
[1:06:40] God this is what I'm communing with
[1:06:43] there is a a River of Life flowing out
[1:06:46] from me amen I don't want to be stifling
[1:06:49] the flow amen I want God to use this
[1:06:53] Fountain amen oh my what a
[1:06:57] memorial thank
[1:06:59] God you
[1:07:02] know
[1:07:17] my brother brand said this
[1:07:20] in 104 and remembering the Lord said
[1:07:26] about Hagar there she was a slave girl
[1:07:31] to begin with and had tried to act in
[1:07:34] the right way that she was supposed to
[1:07:38] act in here she got the little baby in
[1:07:41] her arms and it dying and she was so sad
[1:07:45] she laid it under a little Bush and went
[1:07:49] about a bow shot and nail down to pray
[1:07:53] and there appeared a well oh my The Well
[1:07:56] of him that liveth and seeth
[1:07:58] me stand still today it was put there
[1:08:03] some way the well stands as a memorial
[1:08:06] oh my I thank God for that you know you
[1:08:09] think about how God would even look at
[1:08:12] you know different ones and brother
[1:08:13] brandham you know I so appreciate the
[1:08:15] quotes this morning but you know you
[1:08:18] think about brother brandham saying and
[1:08:20] this is out of a message called the
[1:08:22] flashing red
[1:08:23] lights of his signs of his is coming but
[1:08:26] he says this now in 165 he says oh God I
[1:08:30] know give me the grace never to complain
[1:08:35] I want my life Lord I want my people's
[1:08:38] life God grant that our life could be
[1:08:42] crowned no matter if we suffer whatever
[1:08:45] takes place how many turns against me I
[1:08:50] know this one thing in my life as I get
[1:08:53] older my friends the streams behind me
[1:08:56] will soon be running out narrower and
[1:08:58] narrower as I go down the road and I
[1:09:01] know one thing it'll come to pass after
[1:09:04] a while there'll be no one come to me
[1:09:07] and ask and say or ask me
[1:09:09] advice the ones you who know me when I
[1:09:13] was younger days they're gone if I shall
[1:09:15] live my friends will get fewer and fewer
[1:09:18] as I get older and I know that someday
[1:09:21] I'll got to die and I hope God never
[1:09:23] lets Satan Crown me with an old crabbit
[1:09:26] indifferent man my wife an old nagging
[1:09:29] woman or a wife or your or your wife
[1:09:34] that way I pray brother that your lives
[1:09:37] will be crowned with the fruit of the
[1:09:39] spirit love joy
[1:09:42] longsuffering gentleness patience truth
[1:09:46] faith in the Holy Ghost amen I believe
[1:09:49] that's your destiny Amen to be crowned
[1:09:52] with the fruit of the holy spirit amen
[1:09:56] hallelujah praise
[1:10:00] God well praise the Lord you know I got
[1:10:03] to thinking about you know sometimes I
[1:10:05] like to go through and as the um you
[1:10:09] know the table app they they send you
[1:10:11] quotes and different things I just love
[1:10:13] it so much but you know when I think
[1:10:15] about crowning achievements I think
[1:10:17] about brother brandom and our Lord and
[1:10:21] the different ones but you know God has
[1:10:23] a crowning achievement in your life and
[1:10:26] I'll say this if you can hear these
[1:10:29] different testimonies in the scripture
[1:10:31] they're given for admonition that you
[1:10:33] can see yourself in the word of God you
[1:10:36] can identify with characters in The
[1:10:37] Bible and say mama that's me you know
[1:10:41] but I think about this in present stage
[1:10:43] of my Ministry brother brenham's making
[1:10:45] these statements and uh oh my I just
[1:10:48] think about how brother brandham in a
[1:10:50] forsaken time God was going to Crown his
[1:10:53] ministry you know all has forsaken me
[1:10:56] you know just like when Paul Paul was
[1:10:58] going through his great trials and you
[1:11:00] know all the people demons and the
[1:11:03] different ones you know they forsaken
[1:11:06] him my but it was a time that in a
[1:11:09] forsaking time God was going to Crown
[1:11:12] amen and the God is a god of patterns If
[1:11:15] He Did It For Those don't you think that
[1:11:18] we're in a time that it's a forsaking
[1:11:21] time people are forsaken the the the the
[1:11:24] scripture talks about at the end time
[1:11:26] there would be a great Falling Away
[1:11:29] people will forsake their faith but
[1:11:32] praise God there's a people that are fa
[1:11:34] forsaking their doubts all of their
[1:11:36] unbelief all of their backbiting all of
[1:11:39] their Nays saying they're just forsaking
[1:11:42] all of that amen praise
[1:11:45] God he says this in um present stage of
[1:11:49] my Ministry in uh 55 now I can imagine
[1:11:52] Deus didn't forsake Him and start start
[1:11:55] off at the nightclubs I didn't imagine
[1:11:57] Deus did that cuz Deus was a
[1:12:00] Spirit-filled man he was a great helper
[1:12:02] if you ever took a history of deus he
[1:12:05] was a notable preacher a fine cultured
[1:12:08] man high polished educated he was a
[1:12:10] smart man but why would he forsake Paul
[1:12:15] that's the thing what made him do it
[1:12:18] forsake Paul I don't believe he wanted
[1:12:20] to go to the nightclubs or anything but
[1:12:22] I believe that it was God's separation
[1:12:25] Paul amen it could just be that simple
[1:12:29] praise God God was separating Paul let's
[1:12:33] take some of Demus
[1:12:35] thoughts yeah okay I want to take some
[1:12:38] of Demus Thoughts by a Vindicated
[1:12:41] Prophet amen as I was sitting down on
[1:12:43] the hillside wondering the other day on
[1:12:45] a day on the daylight and I was thinking
[1:12:48] I wonder what Deus want to leave that
[1:12:51] fellow why would he leave that poor
[1:12:54] little preacher and that led him to the
[1:12:56] Lord the man that spearheaded the
[1:12:58] Revival against amongst the Gentiles and
[1:13:01] a prophet indeed no one could say but
[1:13:04] what he was a prophet that he was more
[1:13:07] than a prophet he was an apostle he was
[1:13:09] a great Mighty Apostle to the Gentiles
[1:13:12] and Deus would associated with Paul and
[1:13:16] had fellowship and seen the spirit of
[1:13:17] God move upon that man and why would he
[1:13:21] turn his back on such a person like that
[1:13:24] and
[1:13:26] Vindicated as he was as a servant of
[1:13:28] Christ did you notice Paul here loving
[1:13:31] this present world now I don't think
[1:13:34] deamus was backslid but I don't think
[1:13:37] that he did that but I think he got the
[1:13:39] wrong opinion of Paul oh
[1:13:42] my you know our opinions matter you know
[1:13:46] it's important to recognize in these
[1:13:48] times when we see the word of God when
[1:13:50] it's coming and and it's dealing with us
[1:13:52] in season we want to take that into our
[1:13:54] bosom this is part of the fountain this
[1:13:56] is part of God speaking right speaking
[1:13:59] back like our opinions of one another
[1:14:02] they
[1:14:02] matter in one instance because we want
[1:14:05] to we don't want to like if God wants to
[1:14:07] use that aspect of the body to let the
[1:14:10] fountain flow I don't want to have this
[1:14:12] kind of opinion of of Paul or anybody
[1:14:15] that you know we want to have that Grace
[1:14:18] [Music]
[1:14:19] amen crowned with the spirit of God Amen
[1:14:26] my now Deus came out of a rich family
[1:14:29] and was wealthy and money sometimes
[1:14:31] means religion to
[1:14:33] people
[1:14:36] my
[1:14:39] my was just go right on to 58 it says
[1:14:43] did you know our Lord did have a didn't
[1:14:46] have a place to lay his head did you
[1:14:49] know he only owned one coat see he had
[1:14:53] it and he was was the kind of person
[1:14:56] that was pushed
[1:14:57] about and he didn't have no place to lay
[1:15:00] his head but they could have thought the
[1:15:03] same thing and did about him now I
[1:15:06] believe that
[1:15:07] Demus saw a failing seemingly in Paul's
[1:15:12] Ministry my think of this the Deus he
[1:15:17] forsook Paul because he saw a seemingly
[1:15:20] failing in his
[1:15:22] ministry I think that he thought the old
[1:15:25] fellow was washed up before God now he
[1:15:28] thought that at people that would pluck
[1:15:30] their eyes out and give it to Paul now
[1:15:33] Paul said that he said I would have you
[1:15:36] at least plucked out your eyes and give
[1:15:39] them to me cuz Paul was I think he had
[1:15:42] bad eyes CU he said I wrote with such
[1:15:45] big letters amen and he says but I've
[1:15:49] got the lexan and it says with big
[1:15:52] letters he was in Rome in the prison
[1:15:54] there
[1:15:55] there and was something wrong that
[1:15:59] bothered him from the heavenly
[1:16:02] vision the people would have plucked
[1:16:04] their eyes out see Paul suffered his
[1:16:06] eyes bothered him and he suffered he
[1:16:09] asked the Lord to heal him three times
[1:16:12] and he said except I get exalted above
[1:16:15] the abundance of the Revelation there
[1:16:17] was sent to me a messenger of the devil
[1:16:20] that I might that might Buffet
[1:16:22] me that he might Buffet me now it would
[1:16:26] be pretty good then it would hit him
[1:16:30] again and then he'd get good and it
[1:16:32] would hit him
[1:16:34] again my you know when you think about
[1:16:37] this it just doesn't make sense to the
[1:16:39] mind of a man you know like this this
[1:16:42] man he was a Divine is a preacher Divine
[1:16:45] Healing he seen the supernatural power
[1:16:47] of God and then all the sudden he has
[1:16:49] this opinion because now he's packing a
[1:16:54] doctor with him
[1:16:55] he said it was good that Luke you know
[1:16:57] Luke was a doctor and he's like it's
[1:16:58] good that Luke's with me and he's got
[1:17:01] this problem with his eyes and here he
[1:17:04] is a praying man and he's answered so
[1:17:06] many other prayers but yet when he's
[1:17:09] asking for his eyes a touch on his eyes
[1:17:12] my to think about it that was part of
[1:17:15] the suffering but he said that that
[1:17:17] would keep him humble amen my think
[1:17:21] about it
[1:17:25] in 61 it says this you see Paul had a
[1:17:27] Ministry greater than any of the rest of
[1:17:29] the Apostles put together some of them
[1:17:32] could have said well I walked with Jesus
[1:17:35] why men on the street walked with him
[1:17:38] and when he was here but Paul saw him in
[1:17:42] the pillar of fire after he was dead
[1:17:45] buried ascended into heaven and returned
[1:17:48] back and called Paul see on the road
[1:17:51] down to Damascus he had a greater
[1:17:53] Ministry than m Matthew Mark Luke or any
[1:17:57] of them others he was Far Beyond them
[1:18:01] and he said except I get exalted now and
[1:18:04] say now you fellas don't have nothing in
[1:18:08] it I seen the Lord after he was
[1:18:10] resurrected well they say we walked with
[1:18:13] him
[1:18:15] well so did all the people around in
[1:18:17] Galilee and Nazareth and through the
[1:18:20] country there and they all walked with
[1:18:22] him but you see Paul had talked to him
[1:18:25] and saw him in the form he was before he
[1:18:29] was made flesh my and he commissioned
[1:18:33] Paul in that state while he was in the
[1:18:36] light he commissioned Paul and Paul had
[1:18:39] saw him and he said except I get
[1:18:42] exalted higher than any of the Brethren
[1:18:45] he gave me a messenger of the devil to
[1:18:48] keep me beat down to keep him beat down
[1:18:51] my think about it you know and if God
[1:18:54] would do do this for the man of God to
[1:18:56] keep him humble and to keep him in his
[1:18:58] hand to keep him you know actively
[1:19:00] serving him you know we want to look at
[1:19:03] our afflictions and our sufferings In a
[1:19:05] Different Light you know sometimes
[1:19:07] people get totally liberated and free
[1:19:09] then where are they depending where you
[1:19:13] we just want to remember it was God's
[1:19:15] achievement that brought us to this
[1:19:17] place
[1:19:17] [Music]
[1:19:21] amen oh my
[1:19:26] there in
[1:19:27] 77 says this now we find out that Paul
[1:19:30] De is preaching with Paul he had Paul
[1:19:34] see a crippled man laying there and he
[1:19:36] said I perceive that you have faith to
[1:19:38] be healed stand up on your
[1:19:40] feet and yet he leaves his friend
[1:19:43] Theophilus
[1:19:45] sick my think about the carnal mind just
[1:19:49] looking at it and reasoning like you
[1:19:52] left your friend back there who's sick
[1:19:54] and you're over here healing this guy
[1:19:57] you know if somebody's healed it's
[1:20:00] because of the Sovereign hand of God
[1:20:02] it's not because of gifts working in the
[1:20:05] church right this is God's
[1:20:07] foreordination you have an hour you have
[1:20:10] a season you have a time that God's
[1:20:12] going to come and make that manifest
[1:20:15] amen we're not trying to force God's
[1:20:17] hand at anything it's his Sovereign will
[1:20:20] to heal you amen we love the Lord he
[1:20:24] says Paul Paul Paul lost his ministry
[1:20:27] that's what Demus must have thought why
[1:20:29] he didn't why didn't he he's a gifted a
[1:20:33] gift of
[1:20:34] healing why didn't he just go up there
[1:20:36] and heal that that buddy that he stood
[1:20:39] by so faithful he said he left him up
[1:20:43] there sick and he ain't got no coat I
[1:20:46] want you to bring me that
[1:20:47] coat and and be careful for that copper
[1:20:50] Smith he ruined that meeting in the city
[1:20:54] and I had to to leave the town and put
[1:20:55] me in jail can you imagine Deus what
[1:20:58] kind of preacher he would have turned
[1:21:00] out to be see he says brother they got a
[1:21:04] lot of demon spirits in the world today
[1:21:06] they don't know what they're all about
[1:21:09] see no need trying to explain it because
[1:21:12] it won't do any good anyhow see a
[1:21:16] servant of Christ follows those
[1:21:18] Footprints amen and that's exactly right
[1:21:21] because you know when you think about
[1:21:24] communion and you think about
[1:21:26] remembering the works of God you know we
[1:21:28] want to remember what God did for us
[1:21:31] amen and you know the prophet can take
[1:21:33] us into the the Mysteries and different
[1:21:37] things but you have to go in there
[1:21:39] yourself you have to go in and plead the
[1:21:41] blood and ask God to speak amen and
[1:21:44] these are things that God wants to make
[1:21:46] known
[1:21:49] but
[1:21:53] my I have a few more quotes I'm going to
[1:21:56] read and then we'll get right on to
[1:21:59] communion says Deus and this is in
[1:22:01] paragraph 90 Deus said I ain't
[1:22:05] associating with a guy like that he's
[1:22:07] just a low class
[1:22:09] person you'll go up in that
[1:22:12] denominational brother and you go up
[1:22:15] where I'll be
[1:22:16] somebody and if it's such a thing I'd
[1:22:19] like to walk and ride after Baxter and
[1:22:22] get through and see he's leaving that
[1:22:25] poor little guy in that shape he ought
[1:22:28] to have been standing by him Paul was
[1:22:31] one who led him to Christ but you see
[1:22:34] it's without knowing the spirit knowing
[1:22:37] what the will of God is and doing the
[1:22:39] will of
[1:22:41] God but there they left him in that
[1:22:45] condition left him all men have forsaken
[1:22:47] him you know and I think one of the
[1:22:50] things that you know when we forsake
[1:22:52] certain things you know a lot of times
[1:22:54] we we think about compassion you know we
[1:22:57] want to have compassion on people
[1:23:01] and you know I believe compassion
[1:23:04] is knowing what the will of God is and
[1:23:07] doing it you know and I believe that the
[1:23:11] example was clear with the pool of the
[1:23:13] Bethesda when that out of all the people
[1:23:15] it's like a big hospital and people
[1:23:18] needed but there was only one when the
[1:23:20] waters were troubled that when they went
[1:23:22] in they were going to be healed but when
[1:23:24] he went in there and this is like you
[1:23:26] you're in your world a lot of times you
[1:23:29] you have compassion you go and you see
[1:23:32] all the needs of the people but you
[1:23:34] definitely want to be inspired of God
[1:23:36] you want to have been to that Fountain
[1:23:38] you want to have had communion and just
[1:23:40] know that this burden is directly from
[1:23:42] the lord it's not presuming anything I
[1:23:45] have the mind of the Lord concerning the
[1:23:47] matter you can go right to that person
[1:23:49] he was um you know I I can't remember
[1:23:53] what the exact condition was but he was
[1:23:55] healed amen but he passed by all of the
[1:23:58] others and this is not a a public show
[1:24:01] this this is just such an individual
[1:24:03] Affair amen but you have the power of a
[1:24:06] testimony what God has done in you you
[1:24:09] have a always that you've run to and
[1:24:11] even in community you want to remember
[1:24:14] that God has led you to a no way God has
[1:24:17] giv you some kind of source of strength
[1:24:20] something that gives life amen you know
[1:24:23] we couldn't find that anywhere else
[1:24:25] where could anywhere any of us have ever
[1:24:27] fin the satisfaction until we come into
[1:24:30] communion amen so we want to remember
[1:24:33] those things and you I think about and
[1:24:38] we'll just close up here in
[1:24:40] this last quote here and maybe we read
[1:24:43] one scripture he says this in 92 he says
[1:24:46] if
[1:24:47] there's there be one today that being in
[1:24:51] the same thing that's exactly the truth
[1:24:54] you have to hit the place that has to
[1:24:56] come they think that the man would have
[1:24:59] had a Ministry like that ought to have
[1:25:03] the world right under his thumb he
[1:25:06] should
[1:25:07] have but they won't come under his thumb
[1:25:10] see the man like that won't put a
[1:25:13] Ministry a world under his thumb he
[1:25:16] would put it under his master's thumb
[1:25:19] cuz he's not here to represent himself
[1:25:21] he's here to represent his master you
[1:25:24] know know man trying to seek honor one
[1:25:26] from
[1:25:27] another and they honor one another and
[1:25:30] dishonor God by doing so
[1:25:33] [Music]
[1:25:36] amen and this this is um in 94 he says
[1:25:41] now there's the thing I want to kind of
[1:25:43] exercise on for a few
[1:25:46] moments now it's usual to such a time as
[1:25:51] this when man that stays with the word
[1:25:54] of God stays true to the word of God and
[1:25:58] all men have forsaken him until God
[1:26:01] steps
[1:26:02] in on that person and crowns his
[1:26:06] ministry oh what a
[1:26:08] consolation amen you know you got to
[1:26:11] stay with the word of God Amen because
[1:26:14] then one time God's going to step in and
[1:26:16] Crown your ministry to vindicate what
[1:26:19] you're saying God's going to answer back
[1:26:25] this is this is the last one it says
[1:26:28] this in
[1:26:29] 111 in the Dark Hour mid rendering rocks
[1:26:34] darkening Skies as the poet My Savior
[1:26:37] bowed his head and died the opening Veil
[1:26:41] revealed the way of Heaven's joys in
[1:26:43] Endless days he had to do it in order to
[1:26:47] make a way for us that's right but what
[1:26:50] did God
[1:26:51] do he was true to his word heard and he
[1:26:55] embraced the
[1:26:57] cross but was in the end of his was that
[1:27:00] the end of his
[1:27:02] ministry was his ministry washed
[1:27:05] up God crowned it with the greatest
[1:27:08] crown that ever been crowned he crowned
[1:27:11] it on Easter morning on the resurrection
[1:27:15] he crowned it with the ministry of our
[1:27:17] Lord Jesus he raised him from the dead
[1:27:20] and is alive forever more he wasn't
[1:27:22] washed up because all men for forsaken
[1:27:24] him he was crowned yes sir yes sir he
[1:27:28] was crowned because that was he was he
[1:27:33] had been
[1:27:34] forsaken he had he must do that when he
[1:27:39] was raised from the dead amen I would
[1:27:41] encourage you
[1:27:43] to maybe go back and listen to these
[1:27:47] messages cuz they're just so rich but
[1:27:50] you know brother brandham said that he
[1:27:52] desired and this was in 121 that he
[1:27:54] desired that God would Crown his
[1:27:56] ministry by letting him take the clothes
[1:27:59] of the word of God and dress a bride
[1:28:02] amen and so you see the examples of
[1:28:05] lives lived as Crown God would Crown
[1:28:09] their Ministry and it would take the
[1:28:11] different um you know conditions like
[1:28:14] suffering or you're going through
[1:28:16] different causes but that's not in vain
[1:28:19] you know and maybe I'll close with this
[1:28:23] um
[1:28:25] scripture and it's found in
[1:28:27] Isaiah um
[1:28:30] 62 maybe it's not as familiar but it's
[1:28:34] one thing that you know when I take
[1:28:37] communion I remember what what it really
[1:28:40] means to be exposed to Christ and the
[1:28:43] work of God you know because all of
[1:28:46] humanity and all of what we're
[1:28:47] experiencing is because God had in his
[1:28:49] mind one goal amen that he wanted to
[1:28:52] have a bride for his his son if you look
[1:28:55] there with me in Isaiah 62 it says in
[1:28:59] verse one for Zion
[1:29:02] shall will I not hold my peace and for
[1:29:06] Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until
[1:29:08] the righteousness therefore goeth forth
[1:29:11] as
[1:29:12] brightness and the Salvation thereof as
[1:29:14] a lamp that burneth and the g Gentiles
[1:29:18] shall see thy righteousness and all the
[1:29:21] kings thy glory and thou shalt be called
[1:29:24] by a new name which the mouth of the
[1:29:27] Lord shall
[1:29:28] name Thou shalt also be
[1:29:32] crowned be a Crown of Glory in the hand
[1:29:35] of the Lord a royal diadem in the hand
[1:29:38] of thy God Thou shalt no more be termed
[1:29:41] forsaken neither shall thy land no more
[1:29:44] be termed desolate but Thou shalt be
[1:29:47] called
[1:29:48] hezb thou and thy land buah for the Lord
[1:29:53] delighted in thee and thy land shall be
[1:29:56] married for as a Young Man Marth a
[1:29:58] virgin so shall thy son marry thee and
[1:30:03] as a bridegroom Rejoice over the bride
[1:30:06] so shall the bride so shall God Rejoice
[1:30:09] over thee amen we trust the Lord will
[1:30:12] encourage your heart on this communion
[1:30:14] as we invite our brother Matthew to come
[1:30:15] he's going to take over our communion
[1:30:17] service we just trust that as you
[1:30:20] remember that God is crowning your life
[1:30:23] with gra grace and mercy that the fruit
[1:30:25] of the spirit can be alive and there
[1:30:28] will be others that see this Royal
[1:30:30] diadem so it's a precious thing to have
[1:30:33] communion and Lord bless you Amen
[1:30:36] brother
[1:30:37] [Applause]
[1:30:42] Matthew man enjoyed that it's a good
[1:30:46] word Lord crowning achievement and
[1:30:50] remembering the Lord you know that's a
[1:30:52] reading out of that
[1:30:54] uh sermon present stage of my Ministry
[1:30:57] it's a a very
[1:30:58] Monumental uh sermon if you go back and
[1:31:01] and listen to
[1:31:03] that it's pretty profound but brother
[1:31:05] Brandon would come in
[1:31:07] and um start to talk about Timothy I
[1:31:12] believe verse four you know that's this
[1:31:15] the he tore that out of his Bible and
[1:31:17] put that in the Cornerstone of his
[1:31:19] church and then as his ministry moved
[1:31:22] into the third pool and he know all
[1:31:25] these things were there was just a big
[1:31:27] change in his ministry as he's preaching
[1:31:30] present stage he he knows that uh this
[1:31:33] is coming a time where he's not going to
[1:31:35] be with us much
[1:31:37] longer and um the angel of the Lord
[1:31:40] tells him prior to him preaching that uh
[1:31:42] to take Joseph Bose out in the yard and
[1:31:45] you can search that in the message and
[1:31:47] Brother Joseph Bose saying brother
[1:31:49] brandom have you ever read the rest of
[1:31:51] SEC second Timothy 4 as pertaining to
[1:31:53] your ministry and he's been he basically
[1:31:56] I say pertaining to his ministry because
[1:31:58] he's asking him if he ever read the rest
[1:31:59] of it and he says I mean I'm sure he's
[1:32:01] read it but he never really took it
[1:32:03] before the church and never really said
[1:32:05] anything on about it he goes well I
[1:32:06] guess I have it and as brother Andrew
[1:32:10] was was talking about that crowning
[1:32:12] achievement when you when you open that
[1:32:14] up and read what it says brother brandom
[1:32:18] knew with that that Vision that happened
[1:32:20] there was a big bang and he he thought
[1:32:22] it was the end of his life he was trying
[1:32:23] to make sense of it all when you go and
[1:32:25] read that it says my time of departure
[1:32:27] is at
[1:32:28] hand and so it was now that crowning
[1:32:32] achievement as brother Andrew was
[1:32:34] ministering that the opening of the word
[1:32:35] would come that he could dress a bride
[1:32:37] in his righteousness by his word but
[1:32:40] just as that true Elijah Ministry had to
[1:32:42] stand there he I must decrease that he
[1:32:45] might increase and his time of departure
[1:32:47] was at hand but what did Paul say there
[1:32:48] he said I've I've I've run a good race
[1:32:52] I've fought a good fight and because men
[1:32:53] have gone before and they've done their
[1:32:55] job we can do ours it'd be impossible
[1:32:59] without Malachi 4:5 for us to live an
[1:33:01] overcoming life because it was God's
[1:33:03] provided way in the end time and just in
[1:33:06] the Simplicity of that thought
[1:33:07] remembering the Lord know brother
[1:33:09] brandom says that uh well remember the
[1:33:13] Lord and remember his actions he was
[1:33:15] never in a hurry he was never Hasty you
[1:33:17] know uh think of what he would have done
[1:33:20] what decision he would have made that
[1:33:22] you would make the same one and as I
[1:33:24] thought about that crowning achievement
[1:33:25] isn't that what we want we want to come
[1:33:27] to the place of adoption where we're
[1:33:29] we're making the same decision that the
[1:33:30] father would make that when we're at
[1:33:33] work or we're on our job or something
[1:33:34] that that we would come to that place of
[1:33:36] maturity where we're do our word is just
[1:33:39] as good as the fathers and that's really
[1:33:42] uh being crowned with those fruits of
[1:33:43] the spirits where our decisions and the
[1:33:45] way that we conduct ourselves it's the
[1:33:47] very holy spirit that we're surrendering
[1:33:49] to that's manifesting those things and
[1:33:52] when we we we don't get it right
[1:33:54] we say Lord I didn't get it right but
[1:33:56] help me remembering the Lord I really
[1:33:59] enjoyed that let's just stand as we'll
[1:34:03] uh go into our communion
[1:34:07] reading and uh
[1:34:15] Corinthians and we we just uh before we
[1:34:18] go um
[1:34:20] into um the reading here um
[1:34:24] um we we're now that we're in the the
[1:34:28] newer building um we have two setups
[1:34:30] here and so um those of you sitting on
[1:34:33] this side you'll you'll come and there's
[1:34:36] two lines um so just form two lines and
[1:34:39] then as you come down you'll go back out
[1:34:41] and around and the same over here and I
[1:34:43] believe if we just keep that in mind
[1:34:45] it'll it'll run very smoothly so let's
[1:34:49] just uh go into our um communion
[1:34:56] reading and we'll just read verse
[1:35:00] 23 says for I have received of the Lord
[1:35:03] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:35:04] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:35:07] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:35:09] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:35:11] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:35:15] broken for
[1:35:17] you this do in remembrance of
[1:35:21] me after the same manner also he took
[1:35:24] the cup when he had s saying this cup is
[1:35:28] the New Testament and my blood this do
[1:35:31] ye as often as you drink it in
[1:35:35] remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:35:38] eat this bread and drink this cup you do
[1:35:41] show the Lord's death till he come
[1:35:45] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:35:47] and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:35:49] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:35:51] and the blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:35:54] examine himself let him eat of that
[1:35:56] bread drink of that cup for he that
[1:35:59] eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth
[1:36:01] and drinketh Damnation to himself not
[1:36:03] Discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:36:06] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:36:09] and many sleep for we judge ourselves we
[1:36:12] should not be judged but when we are
[1:36:14] judged we are chasen of the Lord that we
[1:36:16] should not be condemned with the world
[1:36:19] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:36:21] together to eat Harry one for another
[1:36:23] and if any H man hunger let him meat at
[1:36:27] home that ye come not together un
[1:36:30] condemnation and the rest will I set in
[1:36:34] order when I
[1:36:36] come we just say a prayer
[1:37:22] follow
