[24:23] brothers that are taking the offerings
[24:24] if you could come brother Matthew if you
[24:25] could just come and take this needs
[24:27] before the Lord amen
[24:43] amen we all we also just want to
[24:44] remember uh sister uh Kim Chappel as her
[24:48] brother Keith passed away he was just 72
[24:51] years
[24:51] old um he went to uh attended brother
[24:55] Isaiah Brooks church and when I I got
[24:58] the news it just really uh uh moved on
[25:01] my heart because he was such a wonderful
[25:04] brother just always smiling and come in
[25:07] he was just a bright spot and uh brother
[25:12] Isaiah was preaching that morning on
[25:14] going into another dimension
[25:16] and um I know he wouldn't mind me
[25:19] sharing this because it's on his heart
[25:20] but he he he remembered there was a a
[25:22] bright spot in the room where he was
[25:23] sitting and and uh that evening God just
[25:27] started to pull him over to that
[25:30] Dimension he had a stroke but when
[25:32] brother Isaiah came to see him he was
[25:33] full of vigor and he pulled him in close
[25:36] to him and shook said brother Isaiah
[25:37] it's everything you were preaching on
[25:39] this morning and so the Lord took him
[25:43] beyond the curtain of time and you know
[25:45] on this side we're heavy-hearted and I
[25:47] believe that was uh sister Kim's last uh
[25:50] living relative and so just remember her
[25:52] and um the verton at the passing away of
[25:56] this uh family member brother Keith but
[25:58] you know the scripture says precious in
[25:59] the eyes of the Lord are the death of
[26:01] his Saints so Heavens Heavens received
[26:04] another one and a few more days in a
[26:06] moment of twinkling eye we'll all be
[26:08] changed we'll all be gathered together
[26:10] on that day and until then why don't we
[26:12] just stand together
[26:13] and maybe you have an unspoken prayer
[26:16] request you just want to lift your hand
[26:18] up and make it known before the Lord

[38:22] father we need uh bread from Heaven Lord
[38:26] we need revelation
[38:28] Lord we know that it takes the operation

[38:33] God that you would have your sway your
[38:36] way your will and that everything that
[38:39] can be said and done here would be
[38:41] edifying to the body and pleasing to you

[39:05] Lord that you can give a sight beyond
[39:08] what can be seen father as we commit the
[39:11] needs Lord here we just ask that you
[39:14] would Minister to your people only as
[39:17] you can do for the glory of God we ask
[39:20] in Jesus Christ's name amen amen if you
[39:24] want to open your Bibles we're just
[39:25] going to read a few scriptures I have a
[39:27] simple thought and just trust by the
[39:28] help of the lord we can deliver it we
[39:31] can go rejoicing
[39:33] amen second Timothy Chapter
[39:39] 2 just thinking this week about
[39:43] remembering that we're in a
[39:45] battle you know sometimes you get going
[39:48] and you just you know it's in the back
[39:50] part of your mind but I want to keep it
[39:52] in the Forefront of my mind you know
[39:54] we're we're in a battle and um
[39:58] I won't keep you standing very long but
[40:00] we'll have two other scripture readings
[40:02] but let's read this together in second
[40:05] Timothy Chapter 2 we're going to read
[40:08] verses
[40:11] 1-2
[40:14] amen scripture says Thou therefore my
[40:17] son be strong in the grace that is in
[40:21] Jesus Christ Christ Jesus and the things
[40:25] that thou H has heard of me among many
[40:28] witnesses the same commit thou to
[40:30] Faithful Men Who Shall be able to teach
[40:33] others
[40:35] also thou therefore endure hardness as a
[40:39] good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that
[40:43] Warth entangle himself with the Affairs
[40:47] of this life that he may please him who
[40:51] hath chosen him to be a a
[40:54] soldier I love that so much that's what
[40:57] I want to talk to you about tonight if I
[40:59] can title this thought to you is you've
[41:02] been chosen to be a good
[41:04] soldier it's not of your own choosing
[41:06] God did it it's by the will of God
[41:11] Amen and if a man also strive for the
[41:16] Mastery yet is he not crowned except he
[41:19] strive lawfully the husbandman that
[41:22] labor must be first partaker of the
[41:26] fruits
[41:28] consider what I say and the Lord give
[41:31] thee understanding in all things
[41:33] remember that Jesus Christ of the seed
[41:36] of David was raised from the dead
[41:39] according to my gospel wherein I suffer
[41:43] trouble as an evildoer even unto bonds
[41:47] but the word of God is not
[41:49] bound therefore I Endure all things for
[41:53] the elect's sake that they may also
[41:56] obtain the salvation which is in Christ
[41:59] Jesus with eternal
[42:01] glory it is a faithful
[42:05] saying for we be dead with him we shall
[42:09] also live with him if we suffer we shall
[42:13] also reign with him if we deny him he
[42:17] also will deny us amen you may have your
[42:21] seats trust the Lord will add a blessing
[42:23] to the reading of his word I have also
[42:26] another scripture we'll just go to these
[42:28] two are very familiar but just in the
[42:30] way of remembrance we'll just mention
[42:33] them at the start just as a foundation
[42:36] in Ephesians chapter 2 and
[42:39] verses 8 9 and
[42:45] 10 the scripture says for by grace are
[42:48] you
[42:49] saved through
[42:52] faith that not of yourself it is the
[42:56] gift of God not of Works lest any man
[43:00] should boast for we are his workmanship
[43:05] created in Christ Jesus unto good
[43:08] works which God hath for ordained that
[43:11] we should walk in them amen we're a
[43:14] happy people because God has ordained us
[43:17] to be good soldiers and he's ordained us
[43:20] to good
[43:22] works and I love that how it's ordered
[43:25] just right there in the scripture
[43:27] you know in the fight we got to realize
[43:30] it was the grace that of God that called
[43:32] us and and we're saved by grace but
[43:35] there's something that's connected with
[43:37] that it's through Revelation it's
[43:39] through faith amen these are the things
[43:42] that in our Warfare we must remind
[43:50] ourselves also in
[43:53] Galatians Galatians chapter 3
[44:05] I'm sorry Galatians Chapter
[44:09] 2 in verse
[44:11] 20 says I am crucified with Christ
[44:14] neverthe nevertheless I
[44:17] live yet not I but Christ liveth in
[44:22] me and the life which I now live In the
[44:27] Flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[44:30] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[44:35] I do not frustrate the grace of God for
[44:38] if the righteousness come by the law
[44:41] then Christ is died it dead in vain amen
[44:46] you know I was just fellowshipping with
[44:47] my daughter Hannah this week and I just
[44:50] it just struck me so much that we must
[44:52] remember that we're in a battle we must
[44:55] constantly remind ourselves not only
[44:57] that we're in a battle but the Lord's on
[44:59] our side and we don't want to go out
[45:02] into this battle front without a purpose
[45:05] we don't want to go out just fighting
[45:08] with our flesh right there's many times
[45:10] where we're trying to you know work on
[45:13] our outside you know we're constantly
[45:15] doing it but I feel like that's part of
[45:17] what an overcomer is is recognize that
[45:20] it's not about us putting all of this
[45:23] outward something but there is just like
[45:26] it was in the natural the the church
[45:29] world has rejected Christ and he's on
[45:32] the outside and he's knocking trying to
[45:34] get back on the inside but I just want
[45:37] to remind you that it's actually Christ
[45:40] in you that is the hope of glory I don't
[45:43] want to be going out and taking the word
[45:45] of God and letting my intellects try to
[45:49] Captivate a power to manifest some
[45:52] outward uh emotion or reaction or
[45:56] anything to make myself
[45:59] settled I I don't want it to be
[46:01] something that I can do so much on an
[46:04] expression but I want it to be God in Me
[46:08] It's the faith of God that's in me
[46:10] that's moving me that's the expression
[46:12] of the
[46:17] believer you know it's it's uh reminding
[46:21] me about this time back in 2006
[46:27] I I
[46:29] remember it was right before the Lord
[46:31] opened the message to me I was laying
[46:33] there on the couch and I'd been down for
[46:37] days I had just got back from Trinidad
[46:39] and Tobago and uh while I was working
[46:42] out of the country I ended up
[46:44] Contracting a disease and I didn't know
[46:47] that I thought oh I'm just having a
[46:49] bunch of back pain and I got a headache
[46:52] and well it turns out they said I had
[46:54] menitis and I waited so long to go the
[46:57] doctor then they just said you know well
[47:00] anyway let me back up well I was sitting
[47:01] on that
[47:03] couch you know I was suffering and I I
[47:07] just remember my wife's in the kitchen
[47:09] and Haley was she was probably six
[47:12] months old 7 months old maybe just
[47:14] within a year's time but she was
[47:16] crawling around and I just remember just
[47:18] agonizing and I was at my give up I was
[47:22] done I'm I'm not going to sugarcoat this
[47:24] I I was done I was waving the white flag
[47:27] I said God heal me or kill me I'm done
[47:31] I'm I'm at my end I'm ready to go I mean
[47:35] if this is it I'm I'm giving up I'm at
[47:38] the end of my rope I can't take it
[47:40] anymore I've never been under this kind
[47:42] of slow I've never been under this kind
[47:44] of strain I've never been under this
[47:46] kind of Oppression physically mentally
[47:49] spiritually I was
[47:51] done I wasn't fighting no more it was
[47:55] over but then something something
[47:57] happened amen something on the inside I
[48:00] begin to see my wife struggling cooking
[48:03] I see my little baby crawling I was
[48:05] thinking there's something on the inside
[48:08] that came and he says it's time to fight
[48:10] amen it's time to get
[48:13] up amen I love it when the inside
[48:16] something starts jangling and bubbling
[48:18] up it's not me trying to work something
[48:21] up there's something on the inside
[48:23] that's saying it's time to go it's time
[48:25] to take a step
[48:28] it's not time to lay here and woe is me
[48:31] and look at myself and all my symptoms
[48:35] all my problems all my difficulties no
[48:38] but there's something on the inside
[48:40] that's pushing me forward it was the
[48:42] faith of God that moved amen that's what
[48:45] we want to see in action today we want
[48:47] to see faith in action in his believing
[48:49] children not worried about the symptoms
[48:52] not worried about the struggle but
[48:53] getting into the presence of God and
[48:55] saying I'm at the end of my road I need
[48:59] something that's greater than myself
[49:01] greater than my struggle greater than my
[49:04] disease greater than my
[49:08] adversary that's what I need I need that
[49:10] inside Soldier so I can fight the good
[49:13] fight of Faith amen that's what we're
[49:15] talking about today tonight we want to
[49:18] have the fight of Faith the the
[49:20] opposition's coming so that you can
[49:24] overcome we've been given promises heyen
[49:27] we're not here to back up we're here to
[49:30] walk forward we want the inside
[49:33] something to be on the Battlefront that
[49:35] that Spirit of the word to be channeled
[49:38] right at the front of the battle
[49:40] line it's not me it's Christ in me amen
[49:44] I ain't waiting around for my flesh to
[49:46] decide what I'm going to do there's
[49:49] something that loves this word there's
[49:51] something that loves him coming into me
[49:53] manifesting materializing his grace
[49:57] because it's that Revelation that
[49:58] recognizes I'm I'm a good soldier I've
[50:01] been chosen for this battle bring it on
[50:04] I'm more than able to do this that's
[50:06] what the father of our faith
[50:08] did he knew that God was able to fulfill
[50:11] his promise he wasn't waiting for the
[50:14] devil to hoop more troubles he just
[50:17] looked to the word Lord you said it I
[50:20] believe it amen I ain't waiting around
[50:23] for you to clown me devil trying to make
[50:26] us clowns we're Believers we're children
[50:29] of God we stand on the word the devil
[50:32] has to back
[50:33] [Music]
[50:35] up it's time to
[50:44] fight you
[50:46] know it's time to fight you know you
[50:51] know our our our armorment our battle
[50:54] our battle is a RAID we we want to
[50:56] recognize we're in a
[50:58] battle in a battle it's not so much out
[51:02] there the battle's on the inside it's
[51:05] the greatest battle that's ever been
[51:08] fought is now raging in the minds of
[51:12] human
[51:13] beings doubt and Faith are waging they
[51:17] are pressing in on us but praise God
[51:21] you've been chosen to fight the good
[51:24] fight amen
[51:27] you know we want to strive for the
[51:28] Mastery you know I think we have many
[51:30] examples in the word of God that we can
[51:32] look to to see that there was others
[51:34] that took God at his word and they were
[51:36] striving for the Mastery despite the
[51:39] opposition you know a lot of times what
[51:41] it does is we come to the very end of
[51:44] ourselves you know where it doesn't look
[51:47] like there's any hope and all the things
[51:49] that we can do is look to the
[51:52] Unseen you know it's not something great
[51:56] something out outside it's what God has
[51:58] spoke on the inside you're more than
[52:01] able I've made you more than a
[52:05] conqueror you know it's just special to
[52:09] think about that we're in about I had
[52:11] some quotes and some scriptures uh to
[52:14] add to this but I just tell you we might
[52:16] just close here in a minute brother
[52:20] Billy I feel wore out already but praise
[52:23] God y'all keep pulling we'll just stay
[52:25] here as long as the Lord
[52:27] tells us
[52:29] go you know it's just I was thinking
[52:33] about the scripture and whenever Brother
[52:36] David was preaching Sunday night I was
[52:38] like
[52:39] yeah this is it I'mma I'm going go ahead
[52:43] and share this the next time the Lord
[52:45] has me speak so here we are in 1
[52:48] Corinthians 10 it says this in uh verses
[52:52] 12 and
[52:53] 13 I don't mean to be yelling but man it
[52:55] feels good get rid of this devil that
[52:57] was itching my
[53:03] throat so in uh 1
[53:08] Corinthians 1 Corinthians
[53:15] 10 1 Corinthians 10 and we'll start
[53:20] there in verse
[53:23] 12 says wherefore let him that thinketh
[53:27] he
[53:28] standeth take heed lest he fall now as
[53:31] we read this just remember we're in a
[53:33] battle because the enemy wants to wage
[53:36] war in our thinking right so we're our
[53:40] battle is actually a battle of
[53:43] wills what the enemy can get us to think
[53:46] about like instead of like what Jeremiah
[53:50] spoke and he said I know the thoughts
[53:52] that I think towards you thoughts to
[53:55] prosper you
[53:57] thoughts not of evil but to bring you to
[54:00] an expected end God spoke things and and
[54:04] by faith he knows it's going to come to
[54:06] pass it's already manif in his mind it's
[54:08] already settled but now we're the
[54:11] soldiers acting out the plague that's
[54:13] right right so God's thoughts are for
[54:16] you but there's a battle where we're our
[54:19] thinking has been hibiz and and we got
[54:22] sin nature to contend with we got memory
[54:26] reasonings affections imaginations these
[54:29] things are Waring against
[54:31] us and it's not what I think about you
[54:34] so much as what God is trying to do on
[54:37] the inside so that I can be a master of
[54:40] every circumstance and let my faith live
[54:43] out in my personal walk I must be a
[54:47] partaker of the fruit first I want to
[54:49] see God go out to work for other
[54:52] believers I want to see God do for you
[54:54] what you need but God deal with the
[54:57] inside first come on the inside and
[55:00] pulsate the love of God the Forgiveness
[55:03] of God the goodness of God the kindness
[55:06] of God let me forgive like God let oh my
[55:10] I want to walk like God think like God
[55:13] talk like God live like
[55:18] God that's the you're chosen for this
[55:21] amen this is you this is
[55:25] me I love to see Christ manifest in his
[55:28] children this is the very age of the
[55:31] Life of Christ we want to strive for the
[55:35] Mastery we want to strive to keep life
[55:38] in us we have all of these things raging
[55:41] war against us that the Life of Christ
[55:45] might live in me live in
[55:49] you this is
[55:51] you this is for you he died for you he
[55:56] died for me what was the purpose of his
[56:01] death he's redeemed us he's given of his
[56:06] Spirit he wants his nature to be
[56:08] expressed in us
[56:22] hallelujah
[56:25] my where therefore let him that thinketh
[56:28] is
[56:29] standing take heed lest he
[56:35] fall there hath no temptation taken you
[56:39] such as common to
[56:41] man but God is faithful who will not
[56:46] suffer you to be tempted above that
[56:49] which you are
[56:50] able but will with the Temptation also
[56:55] make a way of the Escape that ye may be
[56:58] able to Bear it
[57:01] Hallelujah God is a way
[57:06] maker that is there is no shadow in that
[57:11] promise God Will Make A Way of Escape
[57:16] that you may bear
[57:17] it the struggle sometimes is there's a
[57:20] kink in the
[57:22] line sometimes we get to look and like
[57:24] how am I going to make the way of
[57:27] nope nope God said I will make an escape
[57:32] I will make a wave Escape for
[57:35] you I don't want to look to other
[57:37] resources God you said it you said in
[57:41] your word I believe it and when the
[57:44] thought comes I take the inside Soldier
[57:48] and I make my tongue speak the
[57:52] word your word said Lord I make my
[57:57] testimony PL public I'll speak the
[58:00] testimony and I'll preach to myself
[58:02] that's what I'm doing tonight preaching
[58:03] to myself I said God is going to make a
[58:06] way I didn't feel like I was going to be
[58:09] able to preach I told Brother David I
[58:11] said and by his grace through faith
[58:15] we'll we'll move forward amen and that's
[58:18] what we're believing for your
[58:20] situations God is the way maker and with
[58:24] the trial he will make Make A Way aren't
[58:28] you grateful for that Comfort we need
[58:30] that Revelation to strike
[58:32] us we want to live in that we want to
[58:39] constantly excuse
[58:42] me
[58:46] honey we want to constantly
[58:50] live where we're
[58:52] striving to keep the Life of Christ in
[58:55] US
[58:56] when the battle gets
[58:58] hot and the enemy's coming in like a
[59:00] flood it's not time to cower and we'll
[59:03] sink back it's time to stand stand on
[59:07] the word of God God you've placed me
[59:11] here you've chosen me for this hour just
[59:14] like Esther in a time just like this
[59:17] you've chosen me you've ordained me I'm
[59:20] going to stand on your word and I'm
[59:23] waiting for the inside Soldier to get
[59:26] activated to come to the front cuz
[59:29] that's what you do you know when you've
[59:31] done all that you can you just
[59:35] stand God is obligated to his word and
[59:38] if you're speaking the word of God
[59:41] believing it with a pure heart you know
[59:44] what God does he says this is
[59:48] faithful this is a faithful
[59:51] statement he said God is faithful who
[59:55] will not suffer for you to be tempted
[59:57] above that you are able I love that
[1:00:02] that's wonderful to
[1:00:03] me praise the Lord I don't know where
[1:00:06] I'm at but you know it's just uh it's
[1:00:10] wonderful to know that we're in a battle
[1:00:12] and we're fighting along just only been
[1:00:15] 20 minutes
[1:00:17] so I was told I I can make this one
[1:00:20] short because the last couple ones were
[1:00:21] long so I don't know if it's I I just
[1:00:24] realized yeah I'm not the master of
[1:00:26] these things right God is the master you
[1:00:29] know and if we're striving and we're
[1:00:31] walking looking at the Master's Hand if
[1:00:34] he starts going like this we want to go
[1:00:36] we want to follow it if he says no no no
[1:00:39] we want to
[1:00:40] stop we're not looking to flesh this is
[1:00:42] not a flesh and blood
[1:00:44] Affair we want to walk in the spirit we
[1:00:47] don't want to be looking at the
[1:00:50] flesh that's not the Warfare we're
[1:00:52] called to engage in
[1:00:58] we'll come back to that Lord
[1:01:03] willing you know in the message how can
[1:01:06] I
[1:01:07] overcome brother brandham had mentioned
[1:01:09] about when he jumped over on that log
[1:01:11] and that laog gave
[1:01:14] way and he said this in paragraph 41 he
[1:01:17] says I was crossing well I I got to back
[1:01:21] up 37 it says this and now we're
[1:01:24] speaking of overcoming the the word
[1:01:26] overcome of course you know what it
[1:01:28] means it means something to overcome and
[1:01:31] this church
[1:01:32] age that the Holy Spirit was speaking
[1:01:35] about at the latest SE age and was we
[1:01:39] have just been through needed a
[1:01:42] rebuking leedan had to be rebuked
[1:01:47] because it's difference towards
[1:01:50] Christ it put him it put Christ outside
[1:01:55] in that are age you know and I don't
[1:01:57] want to be guilty of that putting Christ
[1:02:00] and working on the outside of my body
[1:02:04] like putting them on the outside just to
[1:02:06] deal with my intellect right if if we
[1:02:09] let Christ deal with the heart of the
[1:02:11] matter everything else God works from
[1:02:13] the inside out so it's not about how
[1:02:16] many times we attend church and how many
[1:02:19] times we feed the poor and how many
[1:02:20] times we spoke in tongues or prayed in
[1:02:23] the spirit all of those things are okay
[1:02:26] but is God God Mastery of our heart
[1:02:29] that's what I want in this battle is to
[1:02:31] know that I'm sold out and surrendered
[1:02:35] with everything I got God if you want me
[1:02:36] to suffer going through this battle and
[1:02:39] this trial Lord I know you'll make a way
[1:02:41] but I don't want to Short Change excuse
[1:02:43] me if that doesn't sound right but I
[1:02:46] don't want to Short change the work
[1:02:48] that's God doing on my character because
[1:02:51] really that's what this Warfare is all
[1:02:53] about is that the same faith that Jesus
[1:02:55] Christ he said I do nothing but for the
[1:02:58] father first show me I only do his will
[1:03:02] this is my meat to come to do the will
[1:03:04] of the father that's what the
[1:03:11] warfare that's Waring the good Warfare
[1:03:14] you know if we can learn to get out of
[1:03:16] the way that it can be God doing what he
[1:03:20] said he would
[1:03:22] do
[1:03:24] amen you you know it's he his call now
[1:03:28] he said notice and that was God's love
[1:03:31] expression he's knocking trying to come
[1:03:33] back into his own house but he says he's
[1:03:36] at the door but now notice this is
[1:03:39] paragraph 38 his call here is not just
[1:03:43] the
[1:03:45] church he that overcome see not just the
[1:03:49] church that would be she see the church
[1:03:52] body but now he that overcometh the
[1:03:55] individual that will overcome now you
[1:03:58] know and and I think that's that's part
[1:04:00] of the Warfare you know like we can have
[1:04:03] fellowships we can have groups we can
[1:04:04] have socials and different things like
[1:04:06] that those are fine and good but that
[1:04:08] cannot be a substitute for what God's
[1:04:10] asking to do because he's knocking he
[1:04:12] wants that intimate one-on-one to the
[1:04:14] individual that will overcome I don't
[1:04:17] get my confidence I don't get my
[1:04:19] security I don't get my comfort from our
[1:04:22] social Gatherings from our fellowships
[1:04:25] my comfort is in the comforter in the
[1:04:28] very Spirit of the Living
[1:04:30] God now we can have that and we can have
[1:04:34] Fellowship but we want to recognize if
[1:04:36] I'm in this battle and Christ is on the
[1:04:39] inside there's something
[1:04:41] wrong I want to recognize I want to have
[1:04:47] awareness it's not time to be
[1:04:50] playing these kind of things in our mind
[1:04:53] like this is not something that a good
[1:04:56] soldier
[1:04:57] does Soldier is not working carnally and
[1:05:01] if we're lacking this is the age of
[1:05:06] asking God there's no small and big to
[1:05:11] God excuse
[1:05:18] me Lord help
[1:05:20] us help
[1:05:23] me 41 he says and I was crossing an Old
[1:05:27] Log the other day down at wash and I I
[1:05:30] call it a hollow and
[1:05:32] holler and I jumped on up on this
[1:05:37] log on the outside it looked
[1:05:39] good looked like a big old beach
[1:05:42] log but when I jumped on it oh a big
[1:05:46] chunk of it fell off a real rotten and
[1:05:50] doie I said that's the way Christians
[1:05:53] are
[1:05:54] becoming they've been dead dead in sin
[1:05:56] and trespasses so long till they become
[1:05:59] doy they can't hold no weight at
[1:06:04] all they don't
[1:06:06] know what the overcoming means and I
[1:06:10] begin to think of this text you know and
[1:06:12] I'm just I'm saying this is the Warfare
[1:06:14] that I'm engaged in I this is the kind
[1:06:17] of thing God I'm examining myself where
[1:06:20] have I been not bearing the weight that
[1:06:22] you're asking me to Bear cuz I know that
[1:06:25] I can it you've given me your promise
[1:06:28] that you won't give me more to
[1:06:30] bear and so I want to I want to Bear the
[1:06:32] weight but but where's the channel
[1:06:35] what's the what's the issue brother
[1:06:36] brand overcoming is to keep life in
[1:06:40] you I said Lord thank you thank you for
[1:06:43] bringing to my mind bringing into
[1:06:47] remembrance how to overcome in the
[1:06:53] Warfare we got to keep life in you
[1:06:57] and that's what brought me to the log
[1:06:59] that's what brought the log to that
[1:07:01] condition see it made it worse than ever
[1:07:04] when it laid in the branch in the water
[1:07:07] uh where the waters was and then there
[1:07:11] you take a Christian that's supposed to
[1:07:13] be a
[1:07:14] Christian let the life of God go from
[1:07:17] him and the experience and the joy of
[1:07:20] serving Christ and living in the church
[1:07:22] where such things go on he Rens twice as
[1:07:26] quick right living right
[1:07:31] under so if we're trying to follow the
[1:07:34] message of the
[1:07:36] hour at least this part of the
[1:07:40] message we should live constantly in the
[1:07:42] Life of Christ see CU if you don't you
[1:07:47] lay
[1:07:49] around and to know the things that
[1:07:52] things these things and your supposed to
[1:07:56] do and you don't do the Bible says he
[1:07:59] that knoweth to do good and doeth it
[1:08:02] not to him is sin and you're becoming
[1:08:06] doy
[1:08:07] rotten when you are separated from the
[1:08:11] life of God sounds like a bad
[1:08:14] prescription but he says so strive with
[1:08:16] all that's in you to stay in the Life of
[1:08:20] Christ that you should be fruit bearing
[1:08:23] that's what I want that's what I'm
[1:08:25] striving
[1:08:27] for to strive is to
[1:08:32] fight you know sometimes we think and
[1:08:35] and it has a negative
[1:08:37] connotation because you hear the
[1:08:39] scriptures in other places we hear to
[1:08:41] strives and Wars amongst you and
[1:08:43] different things but it also says
[1:08:47] strive one another try you know we want
[1:08:50] to provoke one another to love into good
[1:08:54] works
[1:08:56] amen like there there is a healthy
[1:09:00] fighting there is a healthy fighting you
[1:09:03] know just because you have all of these
[1:09:05] things that come across your mind that
[1:09:08] like man I I don't want to think that
[1:09:10] about my neighbor I don't want to think
[1:09:11] that about my mom my dad my brother I
[1:09:13] don't want to think that well that's the
[1:09:16] thing we need to do brother brandom told
[1:09:18] us that you know you the farmer couldn't
[1:09:20] keep the crows from flying over but he
[1:09:23] gave the farmer double barrel
[1:09:25] shotgun we could start blasting you know
[1:09:29] if the enem is constantly pouring it on
[1:09:32] you with these negative evil thoughts we
[1:09:35] can take the word of God the Old and New
[1:09:37] Testament and go to Blas in those
[1:09:39] thoughts I'm a Son of God I'm in a I'm a
[1:09:43] chosen to be a good soldier and to war
[1:09:47] Warfare God has so ordained me to walk
[1:09:50] in good works this is not something that
[1:09:53] I chose God spoke it and I'm believe in
[1:09:55] it and I believe that if you believe it
[1:09:59] God will bring it to
[1:10:02] pass so strive with all that's in
[1:10:06] you to stay in the Life of Christ that
[1:10:10] you would be fruit bearing I love that
[1:10:13] so much we see this age that we're
[1:10:17] living in it's one of the greatest ages
[1:10:19] of all ages the latest inan Church age
[1:10:21] is the grandest of all ages because it's
[1:10:25] it's the ending of time and the blending
[1:10:28] of Eternity and then it's the greatest
[1:10:31] sinful
[1:10:32] age more sin in this age than there ever
[1:10:36] has been more powers of Satan is and
[1:10:40] many more times harder to fight against
[1:10:44] than it was in any
[1:10:48] age I Love You Know The Enemy coming in
[1:10:52] like a flood but God he's going to raise
[1:10:54] the standard
[1:10:55] amen and God has made a way of escape
[1:10:58] from this judgment that's coming upon
[1:11:00] this Earth by sending Malachi 4 you know
[1:11:03] I tell you God has provided a open book
[1:11:06] test I tell you when you go to a test I
[1:11:10] when when I was going through grade
[1:11:11] school and things like that when they
[1:11:12] said it's an open book test it was like
[1:11:16] man it was a
[1:11:18] relief how many like open book
[1:11:22] test you know all the answers are in the
[1:11:25] book
[1:11:27] I mean there ain't no reason not to get
[1:11:29] a
[1:11:31] 100 I mean we've already been through
[1:11:33] these things but
[1:11:36] now the veil has been taken off and we
[1:11:39] can see the Messiah he's come he's here
[1:11:43] [Music]
[1:11:46] amen you know part of the battle that
[1:11:49] we're in and just remembering that we're
[1:11:52] in a
[1:11:53] battle you know I think
[1:11:56] um well I'll just read this quote
[1:12:00] uh whatever he says to you do it
[1:12:06] 1953 on June 1st brother Brown says if
[1:12:10] there's no battle then there's no
[1:12:12] Victory but you've got to have a battle
[1:12:15] to have Victory if it isn't given to you
[1:12:19] you wouldn't you wouldn't
[1:12:21] know would be no Victory there wouldn't
[1:12:24] be a victory iory but he that overcometh
[1:12:27] is the one who has the victory so Jesus
[1:12:31] came to
[1:12:33] Earth he had a battle he won the Victory
[1:12:37] and tonight we have a battle and with
[1:12:40] Christ we have the
[1:12:42] victory I tell you there's such a peace
[1:12:44] in that you know when you face the
[1:12:47] battle you know there's one that already
[1:12:49] won the battle for us amen he went you
[1:12:53] know when we were in bondage to this sin
[1:12:54] nature here when we couldn't overtake
[1:12:57] the shackles the hooks in our flesh we
[1:12:59] couldn't we couldn't free ourselves it
[1:13:01] was too heavy but God provided a way and
[1:13:06] he is the way he's broken those
[1:13:09] shackles he's broken those
[1:13:12] chains you know in part of the battle I
[1:13:14] believe that as it's a battle for
[1:13:17] will part of it is to remember and this
[1:13:21] is out of um God hiding himself in simp
[1:13:25] ficity but he
[1:13:27] says I believe this is in paragraph 120
[1:13:30] it says it so pleased God to reveal
[1:13:31] himself and then hide himself and then
[1:13:34] hide himself and reveal himself in
[1:13:35] simple little things that's put it over
[1:13:38] the top of the head of men because he
[1:13:42] did he did say why would a just God do
[1:13:47] that is because that man was made up in
[1:13:50] the beginning not to try to sift for
[1:13:54] himself a man was made to com to rely
[1:13:57] completely upon God and that's the
[1:14:00] reason we are likened to Lambs or sheeps
[1:14:03] sheeps cannot lead himself he has to
[1:14:06] have a
[1:14:08] leader the holy spirit is supposed to
[1:14:10] lead
[1:14:11] us so man made so man is made that
[1:14:17] way and God made all of his works so
[1:14:21] simple that the simple can understand it
[1:14:23] and God himself simp simple himself
[1:14:26] simple with simple with the simple in
[1:14:28] order to be understood by the
[1:14:31] simple in other words he said in Isaiah
[1:14:34] 53 I believe though a fool should not
[1:14:37] error therein it's so simple and we know
[1:14:41] that God is so great till we expect it
[1:14:45] to be so great something and we miss the
[1:14:48] simple thing we stumble over
[1:14:50] Simplicity that's how we miss God Is by
[1:14:54] stumbling over simp Simplicity God is so
[1:14:57] simple till the scholars of these days
[1:15:00] and all days miss him a million miles
[1:15:03] because in their
[1:15:05] intellects they know that there is
[1:15:08] nothing like him so great but in his
[1:15:12] Revelation he makes it so simple they go
[1:15:15] Plum over the top of it and miss it now
[1:15:18] study that study it all uh well I think
[1:15:23] that's a part of the armorment part of
[1:15:26] the the battle is recognizing that man's
[1:15:29] intellects we stumble at the Simplicity
[1:15:33] if there's no battle there's no
[1:15:38] Victory and we've been given like a
[1:15:40] brother was preaching and the previous
[1:15:43] weekend we've been given a charge to go
[1:15:47] out and to take back what the enemy's
[1:15:49] taken to clear out the land to to to
[1:15:52] move to drive back you might have been
[1:15:55] oppressed with some physical malady you
[1:15:58] might have been oppressed by emotional
[1:16:00] hurt from your childhood you might have
[1:16:03] been uh uh you know hey I I'm not very
[1:16:06] smart I failed in school you might have
[1:16:08] all of these things worrying against you
[1:16:10] but that I want to tell you tonight that
[1:16:12] is not your
[1:16:13] identity your identity is you're a son
[1:16:16] or daughter of God and God by his blood
[1:16:20] has paid the price of
[1:16:23] redemption if you will receive it and
[1:16:26] accept it you will become a restored Son
[1:16:30] of God a restored daughter of God and
[1:16:33] you can take God's word and you can put
[1:16:35] it in your heart and you can put it on
[1:16:38] your lips and you can watch God on Earth
[1:16:41] moving driving back Demons of Oppression
[1:16:45] for years physical
[1:16:47] oppressions emotional
[1:16:51] scars God can use that as a character
[1:16:55] and a testimony that can touch somebody
[1:16:57] else's life that you can actually be a
[1:17:01] witness that God is still restoring
[1:17:05] lives no matter what the the the past
[1:17:08] was a lot of times we've had so much
[1:17:11] investment in our past we don't want to
[1:17:13] let it
[1:17:14] go we want to hold to it because that's
[1:17:16] part of our identification and the devil
[1:17:19] has tricked us thinking if we let this
[1:17:20] go we're not going to be as valuable
[1:17:22] because it meant so much to us it's been
[1:17:25] the cause for all of our conflict but I
[1:17:27] want God to deal with the
[1:17:30] inside I don't want to make excuses from
[1:17:32] my flesh I don't want to make no
[1:17:34] Provisions for the flesh I don't want to
[1:17:36] have no complex uh my daddy and my mommy
[1:17:40] my brother my sister my neighbor the
[1:17:43] church people I don't want to have the
[1:17:45] the the the problems with in my mind
[1:17:47] with the pastor or or the Evangelist or
[1:17:50] whatever I want God to deal on the
[1:17:53] inside I want to let let go and let God
[1:17:56] I want to live free because the word of
[1:17:59] God that is in you it is not
[1:18:08] bound but we try to depend upon our
[1:18:13] reasoning the way that we perceive
[1:18:16] it the way that we see it it's the way
[1:18:20] it is whoa whoa whoa whoa we walk by F
[1:18:24] by faith not by sight the battle is to
[1:18:27] walk by the Unseen I just want to remind
[1:18:31] myself remind you the bride of Christ
[1:18:35] you've been given a
[1:18:36] weapon you take the word of God what God
[1:18:40] has made known to you by the way of
[1:18:42] Revelation is so powerful there is
[1:18:46] something that is the devil doesn't want
[1:18:49] you to take that and put it in the hands
[1:18:54] of God by his spirit in a moment go to
[1:19:00] work every day we Face another
[1:19:03] battle but every day we have an
[1:19:07] opportunity for the good soldier to come
[1:19:10] to the front the Battlefront Allie's
[1:19:13] just
[1:19:14] waiting wake wake up wake
[1:19:18] up Jesus he's on the
[1:19:23] inside there
[1:19:25] Lord there's this big waves crashing the
[1:19:28] storm it's just
[1:19:30] Relentless he's in the inside of the
[1:19:33] ship let's go wake
[1:19:36] Jesus not some power outside of there
[1:19:40] but the
[1:19:42] promise is Christ in you
[1:19:45] amen we want to study that it's God in
[1:19:49] Simplicity God is actually allowing the
[1:19:52] difficulties the struggles the trials
[1:19:55] the burdens all of those is so that God
[1:19:59] can come on the scene we don't want to
[1:20:02] run from the battle want to call upon
[1:20:03] the name of the Lord
[1:20:09] amen everybody feeling
[1:20:16] okay well I don't know if I can get to
[1:20:18] any of this you know I just I'm so
[1:20:22] thankful that God's chosen us to be good
[1:20:24] soldiers
[1:20:26] and you know I know this was quoted and
[1:20:31] brother said in his title is it too late
[1:20:35] for the character you know character
[1:20:38] development and it's going to be the
[1:20:40] theme of that faith and character is
[1:20:43] going to be the theme until we leave
[1:20:46] right because if we don't have the
[1:20:48] character of Christ to seek the mind of
[1:20:51] Christ to know what his will is for our
[1:20:54] life because you know the bride has been
[1:20:57] it has been spoken over you that the
[1:20:59] bride has thus sayith the Lord or she
[1:21:01] keeps still so God has given us thus
[1:21:04] sayeth the Lord in 66 books he's given
[1:21:07] us thus sayeth the Lord in over 1,200
[1:21:10] sermons he's given you thus sayith the
[1:21:13] Lord in your personal walk that's
[1:21:14] harmonized with
[1:21:16] both and so this theme is going to
[1:21:18] continually
[1:21:20] be and it's going to keep coming up
[1:21:23] because what God is looking for
[1:21:25] is I believe he's looking for a
[1:21:27] Perfection a
[1:21:29] maturing you know to to have the very
[1:21:32] Life of Christ on display and so the
[1:21:35] battle now is who are we going to yield
[1:21:38] our members to you know that's the
[1:21:41] Warfare that you and I are in right now
[1:21:43] there's a pool because this flesh is
[1:21:46] part of the world and it'll return back
[1:21:48] but God has given us power he says I
[1:21:51] give you power when you go Terry you
[1:21:54] will be endued with power from on high
[1:21:57] let's find and remember that there is a
[1:21:59] source of our strength in this
[1:22:02] fight it's the Holy Ghost it's the Life
[1:22:06] of Christ
[1:22:08] amen but you
[1:22:16] know in this battle this is out of the
[1:22:19] church age book out of the Samaran
[1:22:21] Church age you know that this is I don't
[1:22:24] know the paragraph number but I'll just
[1:22:26] read
[1:22:27] this he says you know
[1:22:31] whenever um you read
[1:22:35] Malachi per uh chapter 1 verses 1 and
[1:22:38] three the burden of the word of the Lord
[1:22:40] unto Israel by
[1:22:42] Malachi I have loved you sayith the Lord
[1:22:45] yet they say wherein has you loved us
[1:22:48] has not Esau Jacob's brother sayith the
[1:22:51] Lord yet I love Jacob and hated Esau and
[1:22:54] they laid the mountains and his Heritage
[1:22:56] waste of the Dragons of the
[1:22:59] Wilderness you see they couldn't not
[1:23:01] figure out the love of God and many
[1:23:03] times you're testifying and you're
[1:23:04] talking with people they're religious
[1:23:06] you know and see we want to get to the
[1:23:08] place where what's inside of us can
[1:23:09] mature because like when we go to talk
[1:23:12] with people they can't figure out the
[1:23:14] love of God right how can a god of love
[1:23:17] hate it doesn't even make sense but
[1:23:19] that's why we have to have
[1:23:21] Revelation right we want to be good
[1:23:23] soldiers in the fight we're not looking
[1:23:26] at our flesh because if you start
[1:23:28] looking too long at your
[1:23:30] flesh it's going to get you going
[1:23:32] sideways that's right you know and and
[1:23:34] I'll just say this too and I I Lord help
[1:23:37] me say this but you
[1:23:39] know a lot of time we look in the mirror
[1:23:42] to see if we got you know Did I Shave
[1:23:44] right or is my face dirty I was out
[1:23:45] working whatever we look in the mirror
[1:23:47] and we're just like you know checking
[1:23:50] things but you know a lot of times
[1:23:52] people go and look at these social media
[1:23:54] things Facebook Instagram Twitter and
[1:23:56] all those kind of I don't know all the
[1:23:58] stuff I don't I'm not on it I probably
[1:24:00] would help my business if I did but but
[1:24:02] anyway I don't want to get clogged up in
[1:24:04] that you know one even scientists
[1:24:06] themselves are stating that what is
[1:24:08] happening when people go onto those
[1:24:10] platforms it's subconsciously already
[1:24:13] programming you when you look at the
[1:24:15] dress or you look at someone's face or
[1:24:17] you look at their business or their car
[1:24:19] or their house all that's it's starting
[1:24:22] to go on the inside in war against you
[1:24:25] because now it's getting you to compare
[1:24:26] yourself one to another the devil is so
[1:24:29] subtle in this hour we should take guard
[1:24:32] against the enemy I want to stand
[1:24:35] against the attacks of the enemy I don't
[1:24:37] want to compare myself to flesh this
[1:24:38] thing's changing where I'm going I want
[1:24:42] to prepare for something that's way
[1:24:43] better than
[1:24:44] this there's no sickness there's no
[1:24:47] sorrow there's no heartache oh what a
[1:24:49] day that'll be when my Jesus I shall see
[1:24:53] when I look upon his face well we can do
[1:24:55] that now when we go into prayer when we
[1:24:58] go into the word of God we can see the
[1:24:59] face of God we can see the promises of
[1:25:02] God I'm for you I'm not against you I
[1:25:05] love you my love is
[1:25:09] elective my what
[1:25:11] a I'm not trying to say anything
[1:25:14] personal to anybody but I'm saying this
[1:25:15] is Attack of the
[1:25:17] devil come in and just say hey just take
[1:25:20] partake of this partake of that don't
[1:25:22] worry about any it's not going to hurt
[1:25:25] you devil you're trying to get into my
[1:25:28] subconscious you're trying to get me to
[1:25:31] think on your grounds I ain't playing
[1:25:35] your
[1:25:36] games and lay this stuff down that's
[1:25:39] right you know if you think you got
[1:25:41] power over those things well you just go
[1:25:44] to God and ask God for your
[1:25:47] Revelation cuz for me I I I just don't I
[1:25:50] know what I've come from and I know the
[1:25:52] bondage that I was in and it took me way
[1:25:55] further than I wanted to go and it kept
[1:25:56] me way longer than I wanted to stay and
[1:25:59] now I want to stay so far away from
[1:26:02] it to Shue the very appearance of
[1:26:05] evil I'm
[1:26:07] not striving with this flesh so much is
[1:26:11] I want to keep life in
[1:26:13] me and I don't want to worry so much I
[1:26:15] can't I can't do for you if I don't do
[1:26:18] for me first I got to feed on this word
[1:26:20] I got to pray up the battle is Raging
[1:26:25] the devil can pit us one to another and
[1:26:28] all of a sudden we're looking at flesh
[1:26:30] and we're comparing where's this coming
[1:26:34] from the devil I want to wage war
[1:26:37] against the devil not my brother oh my
[1:26:41] sister I don't even want to wage war
[1:26:43] with my own Humanity Christ paid the
[1:26:46] debt that I owed I'm
[1:26:50] forgiven God has made a way for me to be
[1:26:53] free from my
[1:26:55] ped God has made a way for
[1:26:59] you whoever is in Christ
[1:27:02] Jesus you are a new
[1:27:04] creature all things are passed away you
[1:27:07] you can fill in the blank if you want to
[1:27:09] add something to that and say well I got
[1:27:11] this other thing that you want to hold
[1:27:12] on to no no no for me all things are
[1:27:16] passed
[1:27:17] away and if I didn't remember something
[1:27:19] God when you bring it to my remembrance
[1:27:21] I say Lord I'm putting that in the blood
[1:27:25] I was wrong there too and I was wrong
[1:27:27] hey this is a progressive thing God is
[1:27:30] chiseling away he's got a masterpiece
[1:27:33] and he's got a master's touch he knows
[1:27:36] what he's doing how he can chisel away
[1:27:38] at our
[1:27:39] thinking he wants the mind of Christ to
[1:27:41] be on display in our very
[1:27:46] Humanity you see this is the thing
[1:27:48] though the proof of Love is election no
[1:27:52] matter what happened his love was proved
[1:27:55] truly by the fact they were chosen unto
[1:27:59] salvation because God had truly by the
[1:28:02] fact that he had chosen unto salvation
[1:28:04] because God had chosen you to Salvation
[1:28:08] through sanctification of the spirit and
[1:28:10] belief of the
[1:28:13] truth he may commit you to
[1:28:16] death as he did
[1:28:18] Paul he may commit you to
[1:28:21] suffering as he did job that is his
[1:28:25] prerogative he is Sovereign but it is
[1:28:28] all with a
[1:28:31] purpose he did not if he did not have a
[1:28:34] purpose then he would be the author of
[1:28:36] frustration and not of
[1:28:39] Peace his purpose
[1:28:43] is anybody else want to know what his
[1:28:46] purpose is like I I got to I got to have
[1:28:49] it I'm a soldier and if I'm just
[1:28:50] fighting if I'm just going on and I
[1:28:52] don't know what his purpose is I go in h
[1:28:55] Lieutenant Captain they're flanking over
[1:28:58] here they got they got Battlement coming
[1:29:00] up they got tanks they got Rockets they
[1:29:03] got satellites they got drones they got
[1:29:06] this they got
[1:29:07] that hey I got purpose in all this
[1:29:12] huh well what's your
[1:29:15] order I want to
[1:29:17] know uh speak to me you have the power
[1:29:20] you have the authority you've got all
[1:29:22] the atomic power we can wipe them
[1:29:29] out he says the this his purpose is that
[1:29:33] after you have suffered a while we would
[1:29:37] be made perfect be established and
[1:29:40] strengthened and
[1:29:42] settled as job said he put his strength
[1:29:45] in US you see he himself suffered he
[1:29:49] learned obedience by the things he
[1:29:52] suffered he was actually made perfect by
[1:29:55] the things that he
[1:29:57] suffered and being made perfect he has
[1:30:00] become the author of Eternal salvation
[1:30:03] unto all that obey
[1:30:06] him in plain language the very character
[1:30:10] of Jesus was perfected by
[1:30:13] suffering and according to
[1:30:16] Paul he left his church a measure of
[1:30:20] suffering that they too by their faith
[1:30:23] in God will suffer for him while come to
[1:30:27] a measure
[1:30:29] of would come to a place of
[1:30:35] perfection why did he want this James
[1:30:40] one says my brethren counted all joy
[1:30:42] when I fall into diverse Temptations
[1:30:45] knowing this that the trying of your
[1:30:46] faith worketh patience let patience have
[1:30:49] her perfect work that you may be perfect
[1:30:52] and entire
[1:30:54] wanting
[1:30:56] nothing why does he stand by the reason
[1:31:00] is in Romans 8:17 18 and if children
[1:31:04] then HS and HS of God and joy HS with
[1:31:06] Christ if so that we suffer with him we
[1:31:11] may be also glorified together for I
[1:31:14] reckon that the suffering of this
[1:31:16] present time are not worthy to be
[1:31:19] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:31:21] revealed in US unless we suffer with him
[1:31:24] we cannot reign with him you have to
[1:31:27] suffer the reason for this is character
[1:31:32] simply not made with without
[1:31:36] suffering character is a victory not a
[1:31:40] gift amen a man without character cannot
[1:31:43] Reign because power apart from character
[1:31:46] is satanic but Power with character is
[1:31:49] fit to rule and since he wants us to
[1:31:52] share even in his throne on the same
[1:31:56] basis that he overcame he sat down on
[1:31:58] his father's Throne then we have to
[1:32:01] overcome to sit with
[1:32:03] him you
[1:32:05] know if we're in a fight if we have an
[1:32:08] opponent and you know he's a boxer or
[1:32:11] whatever we're going to we're going to
[1:32:13] study his moves his tactics right and
[1:32:16] we're going to train we got to train we
[1:32:18] got to build up you know if he's
[1:32:20] left-handed if he's right-handed
[1:32:22] whatever so we got to train to see his
[1:32:24] tactics
[1:32:26] right but you know whenever you think
[1:32:29] about it this character is not a gift
[1:32:33] it's a victory amen and so you got to
[1:32:35] fight yes sir you know when the when the
[1:32:38] when the Trials come just remember we're
[1:32:40] good soldiers we've been ordained this
[1:32:43] is actually like Peter
[1:32:46] said consider it all joy you mean this
[1:32:50] this this evaluation this prognosis I
[1:32:53] got fir
[1:32:54] lost a job I don't have the money for
[1:32:56] the
[1:32:58] bills you know you know my significant
[1:33:01] other is you know losing her mind or he
[1:33:06] I'm losing my
[1:33:08] mind no that's not
[1:33:10] it it's just God wanting to impart the
[1:33:14] character of Christ and it's it's the
[1:33:17] same way that he overcome through
[1:33:20] suffering so when we're going through
[1:33:22] the battle we don't look at oh I'm going
[1:33:24] through so
[1:33:26] much I can't handle this no God you
[1:33:30] promised you'd make a
[1:33:32] way God I'm not here to bear this alone
[1:33:35] you said take my yoke upon you I just
[1:33:37] start quoting the scripture to my flesh
[1:33:39] when when I was feeling bad I just I've
[1:33:41] been down this road before and I know
[1:33:43] this not a flesh and blood deal even
[1:33:45] though my flesh is weak and I'm whooped
[1:33:47] on but devil I got something greater
[1:33:49] than
[1:33:50] that the word of
[1:33:52] God brings life that's what I want to
[1:33:55] struggle for to keep life in me no
[1:33:58] matter what the struggle is I'm in the
[1:34:00] fight I'm taking the word of
[1:34:02] God we're going to fight to get the
[1:34:08] victory all right 55
[1:34:12] minutes we're going to close soon
[1:34:16] maybe in First Corinthians 9 it says
[1:34:18] this and I I just think these last
[1:34:20] scriptures that we'll read I think
[1:34:21] they're important so Lord help us we'll
[1:34:25] be done here
[1:34:26] soon 1 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 24
[1:34:30] and 27 says know ye not that they which
[1:34:34] run in a race run
[1:34:36] all but one receive the price so run
[1:34:41] that you may
[1:34:44] obtain and every man that striveth for
[1:34:47] the
[1:34:48] Mastery is tempered in all things now
[1:34:53] they that had do it to obtain a
[1:34:56] corruptible Crown but we an
[1:35:00] Incorruptible
[1:35:03] Crown I therefore so
[1:35:07] run not as
[1:35:10] uncertaintly so fight High not as one
[1:35:15] that beateth the
[1:35:17] air you know I'm not fighting an
[1:35:20] opponent where I'm just beating the air
[1:35:23] but I want to find out where the real
[1:35:24] opponent is is I keep under my body and
[1:35:29] bring it in subjection lest by any means
[1:35:33] I preach to others and I myself be a
[1:35:35] cast
[1:35:36] away I'm going to keep my body in
[1:35:39] subjection to the
[1:35:41] word amen so I want to strive for the
[1:35:45] Mastery you know I remember you
[1:35:49] know this preacher one time was saying
[1:35:52] you know you you could see the sliver
[1:35:55] and they're I oh man you see how there
[1:35:57] you know the high heels just a little
[1:35:59] bit too high or you know but I'm looking
[1:36:03] at your sliver and your sliver and then
[1:36:05] I got this big old Gangplank sticking
[1:36:06] out of my eyes like I can't even
[1:36:08] perceive out of that eye because I'm so
[1:36:11] obscured in my
[1:36:13] vision I mean why are we judges on each
[1:36:15] other like that I mean but that's part
[1:36:18] of the
[1:36:21] battle excuse me
[1:36:25] 2 Corinthians
[1:36:28] 10 2 Corinthians 10 and in uh verses
[1:36:34] 3-8 for though we walk in the flesh we
[1:36:38] do not war after the
[1:36:40] flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are
[1:36:43] not carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:36:47] pulling down of
[1:36:49] strongholds casting down imaginations in
[1:36:51] every High thing that exalted s against
[1:36:55] the knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:36:59] captivity
[1:37:00] every say it with
[1:37:03] me let's do a little bit
[1:37:05] better every thought to The Obedience of
[1:37:09] Christ that's where the battle
[1:37:11] is so that's what Paul is telling us for
[1:37:15] we're we're in the flesh but we don't
[1:37:17] war after the
[1:37:19] flesh but we're bringing every bringing
[1:37:22] captive every thought to The Obedience
[1:37:25] of Christ and having in Readiness to
[1:37:28] Revenge all Disobedience when your
[1:37:30] obedience is
[1:37:32] fulfilled do ye look on the things after
[1:37:35] the outward appearance If any man trust
[1:37:38] to himself that he is Christ let
[1:37:42] him of himself think this again that as
[1:37:46] he is is Christ even so are we
[1:37:51] Christ for though I should boast
[1:37:54] somewhat more of my of the our Authority
[1:37:58] which the Lord ha given us for
[1:38:00] edification and not for your
[1:38:03] destruction I should not be ashamed you
[1:38:06] know I was listening to some guy and I I
[1:38:10] just trust the Lord will help me to sh
[1:38:12] share this in a way that you know you
[1:38:15] know when we think about character and
[1:38:17] and the quote was saying that uh Power
[1:38:21] apart from character is satanic and
[1:38:23] there was a psychologist in the 60s that
[1:38:26] uh through um some of his family I don't
[1:38:30] know if it was his parents or whatever
[1:38:31] but he was studying and they did this
[1:38:34] test at Yale and it was called The
[1:38:36] Milner experience but this man he wanted
[1:38:40] to see the the nature of man like could
[1:38:44] this happen like how did they get to
[1:38:47] where Adolf Hitler and all those people
[1:38:49] would just just wipe people out you know
[1:38:52] what what is it about man
[1:38:54] and so they conducted a survey and they
[1:38:57] they said hey we'll give you um you know
[1:38:59] vouchers for lunch or whatever and so
[1:39:01] they conducted this study at yel and
[1:39:03] they called it the mgrm experience but
[1:39:06] there was U people that would sign up
[1:39:08] and they would come in and they were
[1:39:09] told that they were going to perform an
[1:39:12] experiment and there was going to be a
[1:39:13] teacher there was going to be a student
[1:39:15] and there was going to be a professor
[1:39:16] well the professor had a white coat on
[1:39:18] and they kind of let him know hey we're
[1:39:20] going to go randomly and you're either
[1:39:22] going to be the teacher or the student
[1:39:23] well they were hiding the fact that
[1:39:25] there was only going to be the teacher
[1:39:28] they the the the professor and the
[1:39:31] student were actors right but they were
[1:39:33] trying to get to see how that people
[1:39:37] would react under a certain given right
[1:39:41] a mandate say okay you know what um
[1:39:45] we're going to do this test and uh we're
[1:39:48] going to shock we're going to shock you
[1:39:49] in increments of 15 volts at a time but
[1:39:53] we're just going to give you uh multiple
[1:39:55] questions one through four and if if you
[1:39:57] get this wrong we're going to give you a
[1:39:59] we going to light you up a little bit
[1:40:01] and so they're like
[1:40:02] whoa all right this is just the
[1:40:04] experiment right and
[1:40:06] so well they didn't know that all of
[1:40:09] them got the card for teacher right and
[1:40:12] so there're they're all getting set up
[1:40:14] right they didn't know but they're in
[1:40:16] there and they're they're with the
[1:40:17] button and it was pre-recorded the
[1:40:19] response of the student right so they
[1:40:21] weren't really hitting them but it was
[1:40:23] was just to ex give an experiment how
[1:40:25] the nature of mankind how it would be
[1:40:28] driven when it was given a
[1:40:31] power when it was driven to give
[1:40:35] Authority so these these people they
[1:40:38] they got the Hat of teacher and they're
[1:40:41] sitting in there with the button and
[1:40:43] they said okay and and the uh there was
[1:40:46] a wall and the student was on the other
[1:40:47] side they couldn't see him they couldn't
[1:40:49] see the professor professor's in the
[1:40:50] back and so they said every wrong answer
[1:40:53] light them up and each time they got a
[1:40:55] wrong answer light them up again and
[1:40:57] again and every time you light them up
[1:40:59] it's getting stronger in 15 15 uh
[1:41:02] amperages uh more and and once you get
[1:41:06] shocked at
[1:41:07] 350 it can kill you but the test was to
[1:41:11] go up to 450 which was certain
[1:41:14] death and they found out and I might be
[1:41:16] butchering this experience cuz I just
[1:41:18] this study but but anyway I thought it
[1:41:20] was intriguing because it definitely
[1:41:22] shows the nature of sin nature in man
[1:41:25] but anyway they they they they would
[1:41:27] make and say hey wrong answer boom and
[1:41:30] you can hear after a while boom boom
[1:41:32] they they they would get over and the
[1:41:34] the the professor would be over their
[1:41:36] shoulder saying hey this is what you're
[1:41:38] supposed to do hey you know what this is
[1:41:41] part of the this is part of the um the
[1:41:44] experiment you got to you got to follow
[1:41:46] through with it and so the pressure that
[1:41:49] was put on them they kept caving and
[1:41:52] kept caving and kept caveen and then it
[1:41:54] got to a point where it was like at that
[1:41:56] level and you know the people the
[1:41:57] psychologists they thought man they got
[1:42:00] together amongst their people before
[1:42:01] they did this test and they said how
[1:42:02] many people would go all the way said
[1:42:04] maybe one or two and what was crazy is
[1:42:08] 100% of the people went up to
[1:42:11] 350 100% of the people and they can hear
[1:42:14] the people they had it recorded oh I got
[1:42:16] a heart condition stop I quit and they
[1:42:19] just because they felt empowered because
[1:42:22] they felt they had the authority of
[1:42:23] teacher you know what that that should
[1:42:26] scare the life out of us from the
[1:42:28] standpoint of our Humanity I cannot
[1:42:30] trust my flesh you get me in a position
[1:42:33] God let it be you living in
[1:42:35] me this is such a sacred trust that
[1:42:37] you've
[1:42:39] given I don't never want to be throwing
[1:42:41] my weight around my thought
[1:42:45] around no
[1:42:48] sir I want to bring every thought
[1:42:51] captive to Christ
[1:42:56] I'm just going to have to stop I'm just
[1:42:59] going to have to stop I had more but you
[1:43:02] know the spirit is willing and the flesh
[1:43:05] is weak we must go to God because now
[1:43:09] and I'll end at this quote because it's
[1:43:11] in the church age book and it's about
[1:43:13] Harvest time and I'll say it like this
[1:43:17] you know we see the world and the
[1:43:20] the just even to that example how
[1:43:23] Humanity even with the the shutdown of
[1:43:27] our world and people giving jobs and
[1:43:29] they say you six foot get back put on a
[1:43:33] mask you can't be here there's only 10
[1:43:35] people here you know you could see that
[1:43:38] but what's coming we've already seen
[1:43:42] like a
[1:43:43] preview how dark it can get and don't
[1:43:46] think it's not going to get worse
[1:43:47] because it is but God has made a way of
[1:43:50] escape and that's character that's
[1:43:52] fighting the fight of faith and so as we
[1:43:54] see all of this stuff that's transpiring
[1:43:56] on the world we want to remember that in
[1:44:00] the latest Eden Church age I I I don't
[1:44:04] have the paragraph number but this will
[1:44:05] be my last quote and probably take me
[1:44:08] about five minutes and then uh the
[1:44:10] musicians can come but it says this in
[1:44:12] Matthew 13:30 says but let let both grow
[1:44:17] together until the Harvest and in the
[1:44:19] Harvest time I will say to the Reapers
[1:44:23] Gather ye together first the tears and
[1:44:27] bind them in bundles to be burn to burn
[1:44:30] them but buying the wheat into my barn
[1:44:35] the wheat and the tears which from the
[1:44:38] first age till now have grown side by
[1:44:41] side are
[1:44:43] Harvest what NAA set out to accomplish
[1:44:46] has finally come to pass with all the
[1:44:50] mighty all the might of organization
[1:44:53] the false Church turned from any vesage
[1:44:56] of Truth and with political might
[1:45:00] reinforces her with State backing and
[1:45:04] set out to eradicate Forever The True
[1:45:08] Believer now we're fighting a fight of
[1:45:10] Faith see we're going to have to have
[1:45:11] our faith and our ground so solid that
[1:45:15] we're not banking on anything in our
[1:45:17] flesh we're not worried about our bank
[1:45:18] accounts we're not worried about our
[1:45:20] health we're not worried about our
[1:45:21] family cuz we already got the promise
[1:45:23] and the character of us believes it no
[1:45:26] matter
[1:45:26] what right we're coming to The
[1:45:29] Showdown you know I'm not here to scare
[1:45:31] you I'm here to tell you to lift you up
[1:45:33] it's time to prepare for battle it's
[1:45:35] time to go to
[1:45:41] fighting but just when she is about to
[1:45:44] accomplish her cowardly plot the wheat
[1:45:47] is gathered into the
[1:45:49] Garner no longer will the wheat in the
[1:45:51] tear grow side by side no longer will
[1:45:54] the tears receive the blessings of God
[1:45:56] because of the presence of the wheat for
[1:45:59] the wheat will be gone and the wrath of
[1:46:01] God will be poured out in the Sixth Seal
[1:46:04] which will end in utter destruction of
[1:46:07] the
[1:46:08] wicked now I said a moment ago that the
[1:46:10] false Vine came into full fruit in this
[1:46:15] age her fruit would mature and ripen is
[1:46:19] that correct this evil spirit church
[1:46:22] full of iniquity will be revealed as the
[1:46:25] mustard seed that grew in the tree into
[1:46:28] a tree wherein lodged all the fowls of
[1:46:31] the air at her head will be the
[1:46:34] Antichrist the mystery of iniquity all
[1:46:37] this is true and if this is true then it
[1:46:42] is must also be true that the bride of
[1:46:45] Christ will mature her rightness will be
[1:46:48] in an
[1:46:50] identification with her Lord by the
[1:46:52] means of of the word and her head will
[1:46:56] come to her in the mystery of
[1:47:00] godliness which indeed is
[1:47:02] Christ and as the false church with all
[1:47:06] cunning and diabolical power made up the
[1:47:09] political forces physical forces and
[1:47:12] demons of Darkness come against the True
[1:47:15] Vine the True Vine with the fullness of
[1:47:18] the spirit and the word will do the very
[1:47:21] acts that Jesus did
[1:47:24] then as she nears her headstone becoming
[1:47:26] like him through the word Jesus will
[1:47:29] come that the bride and the bridegroom
[1:47:31] will be United as one
[1:47:33] forever well that get me excited I got a
[1:47:37] purpose for
[1:47:38] fighting already the visible
[1:47:40] manifestation of what I've been telling
[1:47:43] you you are seeing all around us The
[1:47:46] ecumenical move of the tears is factual
[1:47:50] but also it is fact that the prophet for
[1:47:54] the last age must bring forth the
[1:47:56] message from God that will forerun the
[1:47:59] second coming of the Lord for by his
[1:48:03] message will the hearts of the children
[1:48:06] be turned back to the Pentecostal
[1:48:07] fathers and with the restoration of the
[1:48:11] word will come the restoration of power
[1:48:15] God has giv you power to become Sons and
[1:48:17] Daughters of God God is leading you and
[1:48:20] guiding you into all truth that's the
[1:48:22] problem of this
[1:48:24] hour what critical
[1:48:26] times are these that we live in how
[1:48:30] careful we must
[1:48:32] be that we remain true to his word and
[1:48:35] not take from it or add to it for he who
[1:48:40] would speak where God has not spoken
[1:48:43] makes him a liar what I
[1:48:47] have particularly in mind is this about
[1:48:51] the turn of the century the h for God
[1:48:54] I'm I'm sorry I'm going to skip that you
[1:48:56] can go back and read it but you know it
[1:48:58] talks about going through the church age
[1:49:01] and how God was raising up from the
[1:49:03] tossel and and the seed and the the
[1:49:05] shuck and the tossel and he was talking
[1:49:07] about you know in this age when the
[1:49:09] manifestation of speaking in tongues and
[1:49:11] different things that was just the shell
[1:49:14] that wasn't the seed but it was the
[1:49:15] shell coming
[1:49:18] up and we'll pick that up he
[1:49:21] says but but as one can go into the
[1:49:24] field and
[1:49:25] look what he's looking exactly like
[1:49:28] wheat yet it's the husk for the wheat
[1:49:31] seed is not yet formed so this was but
[1:49:35] the soft shell that looked like the real
[1:49:37] grain Yet to Come the original wheat
[1:49:40] seed of
[1:49:41] Pentecost was still to come back in the
[1:49:44] last
[1:49:45] age it had been buried at
[1:49:49] NAA it sent up a shoot in Sardis and
[1:49:52] grew into TOS in Philadelphia and it was
[1:49:54] matured at Lea but it could not be back
[1:49:59] to the original until the word was
[1:50:02] restored the prophet had not yet come
[1:50:05] upon the
[1:50:07] scene but now according to the time
[1:50:10] wherein we stand and L see the prophet
[1:50:13] messenger of Revelations 10:7 must
[1:50:15] already be in the Land once more thus
[1:50:17] sayith the Lord must be here ready to be
[1:50:20] manifested with infallible Vindication
[1:50:23] thus it is the true seed already
[1:50:26] maturing than the
[1:50:28] Harvest praise God you know we just want
[1:50:31] to ripen in the presence of the sun you
[1:50:34] know we're the wheed seed of God we've
[1:50:36] come and we've listened and we fed on
[1:50:38] the word of God now we want to be breed
[1:50:40] on the table let God do in us we we God
[1:50:45] wants us to engage in the battle that
[1:50:48] that pure wheat seed now can be bred on
[1:50:51] the table amen we invite the musicians
[1:50:54] to come
[1:50:59] and you know I was I was wanting to go
[1:51:02] down and as Brother David was talking
[1:51:05] about um the prayer oh I just love the
[1:51:09] past weekend sermons I really appreciate
[1:51:11] the way the Lord's dealing with our
[1:51:13] pastor and you know thinking about that
[1:51:15] prayer and how you know when Jesus you
[1:51:19] know he was going through it you know
[1:51:21] and and I was going to give get into it
[1:51:23] in Matthew I went to the the different
[1:51:25] uh gospels where it talked about when
[1:51:27] Jesus was in The Garden of Gethsemane
[1:51:30] you know and he prayed that intercessory
[1:51:32] prayer which we went through but then
[1:51:33] there was another thing that Jesus
[1:51:36] himself he came to a place in the garden
[1:51:39] of gethe and I believe brother brandom
[1:51:41] said I don't know if it was Easter still
[1:51:42] or where he said it but you know when
[1:51:46] Jesus agonized you know he said in one
[1:51:50] place that the spirit left him in the
[1:51:51] Garden of Gethsemane cuz he had to die
[1:51:53] as a sinner but you know he came to a
[1:51:55] place where he bore the sins of your
[1:51:59] life my life the whole sins of the world
[1:52:02] and when he came to that place now he's
[1:52:04] fighting he's coming to his Jordan the
[1:52:07] death of self and that's what we got to
[1:52:09] do we got to come to the our Jordan and
[1:52:13] we got to cross over we can't say oh
[1:52:15] well my will and God's Will and try to
[1:52:17] blend it then we got
[1:52:19] lukewarmness but God he's showing an
[1:52:21] example and as I was going through you
[1:52:23] know John it was John Peter and James I
[1:52:26] believe that was there you know and they
[1:52:29] were they were you know called to come
[1:52:31] over there and as he was going to be
[1:52:33] agonizing and he knew he'd already told
[1:52:35] him you know hey uh destroy this Temple
[1:52:38] and I'll raise it up but now he's coming
[1:52:41] and he had that personal
[1:52:43] battle like that's what we got to have
[1:52:45] we got to have a personal battle a
[1:52:47] reckoning like am I really giving my all
[1:52:51] my will my ambition my goals my
[1:52:54] aspiration am I really laying it down
[1:52:56] have I even
[1:52:58] considered am I giving my all am I
[1:53:01] looking to what is your will God for my
[1:53:03] life and so as you know John I think he
[1:53:06] was there but when you read it it's like
[1:53:09] one paragraph and it doesn't even say
[1:53:10] anything about like the experience so
[1:53:13] much it just makes statement that they
[1:53:15] were there but then you go to Luke and
[1:53:17] you go to Matthew or and Mark but the
[1:53:21] details m Matthew maybe I'll I'll just
[1:53:23] read this I'm sorry if to keep you but I
[1:53:26] thought this was so special and this is
[1:53:28] maybe where I want to end but in Matthew
[1:53:32] 26 and Jesus said unto
[1:53:35] them all ye shall be offended
[1:53:38] because of me this
[1:53:41] night for it is written I will Smite the
[1:53:44] shepherd and the Shepherd Of A Flock
[1:53:47] shall be scattered abroad but after I am
[1:53:50] risen again I will go go before you into
[1:53:55] Galilee and Peter answered and said unto
[1:53:57] him though all men shall be offended of
[1:54:01] thee yet I will never be
[1:54:04] offended Jesus said unto him verily I
[1:54:07] say unto you that this night before the
[1:54:11] crow the crows Thou shalt deny me
[1:54:15] Thrice and Peter said unto
[1:54:18] him though I should die with thee yet I
[1:54:22] will not deny
[1:54:24] thee likewise also said all the
[1:54:29] disciples do you see the the wrestling
[1:54:31] of will there see Peter he thought you
[1:54:34] know I will never deny you I will never
[1:54:37] be offended he's speaking of our
[1:54:42] Humanity these things are ingrained in
[1:54:44] our subconscious all never deny the
[1:54:48] Lord you personalize it how God dealing
[1:54:50] with you but I know how he did is with
[1:54:52] me and it makes me want to humble myself
[1:54:56] and say God if your grace don't come and
[1:54:59] make this correction I'm just like the
[1:55:02] next person I'm going to the pit I want
[1:55:05] to have that attitude it's by your grace
[1:55:07] that I'm saved through faith when you
[1:55:09] revealed that this is my Humanity that
[1:55:11] I'm Waring
[1:55:12] against
[1:55:15] God what you said is the
[1:55:19] truth then cometh Jesus unto
[1:55:22] to them unto the place called gethe and
[1:55:26] he said unto his disciples sit ye here
[1:55:28] while I go pray Yonder and he took Peter
[1:55:31] and the two sons of
[1:55:33] Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and
[1:55:35] very heavy then saith he unto them my
[1:55:39] soul is exceedingly sorrowful even unto
[1:55:43] death Terry you here watch with
[1:55:46] me and I will and I went and he went a
[1:55:50] little further and he fell on his face
[1:55:53] and he prayed
[1:55:55] saying oh my father if it's
[1:55:59] possible let this cup pass from
[1:56:02] me nevertheless not as I will but as
[1:56:06] thou
[1:56:07] will and he cometh unto his disciples
[1:56:10] and found them asleep and Sith unto
[1:56:13] Peter
[1:56:14] what could you not watch for one hour
[1:56:17] with
[1:56:18] me watch and pray that you enter not
[1:56:22] into temptation the spirit indeed is
[1:56:25] willing but the flesh is weak and he
[1:56:28] went away again the second time and
[1:56:30] prayed saying oh father if this cup may
[1:56:34] not pass from
[1:56:37] me except I drink it thine will be
[1:56:42] done and he came and found them asleep
[1:56:45] again and their eyes were heavy and he
[1:56:49] left them and went away again and prayed
[1:56:51] the third time the same
[1:56:54] words then came he to his disciples and
[1:56:57] said unto them sleep now and take your
[1:56:59] rest behold the hour is at hand the son
[1:57:02] of man is betrayed in the hands of
[1:57:04] sinners rise let us be going behold he
[1:57:09] is at hand that betrayeth
[1:57:11] me you know in Psalms
[1:57:14] 69 it says this in verse 20 the
[1:57:17] reproach reproach hath broken my heart
[1:57:21] and I am full of
[1:57:22] heaviness I have looked to for some to
[1:57:26] take pity but there is there was none
[1:57:30] and for
[1:57:31] comforters but I found none they gave me
[1:57:35] also Gall for my meat and in my thirst
[1:57:38] they gave me vinegar to
[1:57:40] drink you know it was such an Agony and
[1:57:44] I believe he died of a broken heart
[1:57:46] because he bore those sins and that
[1:57:48] sweat turned into blood but praise God
[1:57:53] it pleased the father to bruise him that
[1:57:55] you and I we can come to the same very
[1:57:57] Christ and the character of our lovely
[1:58:00] savior amen is that your heart's desire
[1:58:03] do you feel lifted up to take courage
[1:58:05] and fight the fight of Faith to press
[1:58:07] towards the battle because there's
[1:58:08] somebody that's loved you and like our
[1:58:10] Pastor said there's two loves you know
[1:58:12] when you see the love of God what it did
[1:58:14] for you there should be a love that
[1:58:16] reaches back and say God I want to go to
[1:58:18] the Battlefront for you what you did for
[1:58:20] me I'm not going to let it go in vain
[1:58:23] I'm going to stand and fight amen let's
[1:58:25] raise together if you don't mind and

[2:06:33] know I I I'm just ready to go fight you
[2:06:36] know I feel lifted up you know I feel I
[2:06:39] feel energized to just go fight you know
[2:06:43] the you know the prophet talks about
[2:06:44] this is not a picnic we are on the
[2:06:47] battlefield we are here to fight we're
[2:06:49] not here to just you know like is the
[2:06:52] struggle I think that's one of the
[2:06:53] things we forget you know take the
[2:06:56] natural life you you got to feed it and
[2:06:58] you got to work up and you got to if you
[2:07:00] decide I'm just going to sleep and not
[2:07:02] work up you're going to lose life you
[2:07:05] know what I mean you got to feed that
[2:07:06] life you got to work up and you got to
[2:07:09] you know do the things you need to keep
[2:07:11] that life going and I believe that's
[2:07:13] what Alberto was telling us there's a
[2:07:15] Life of Christ inside of us that we need
[2:07:17] to keep going with it we need to see
[2:07:20] that life continually manifested but
[2:07:23] said you know we come in such an age
[2:07:26] where Christianity is painted you know
[2:07:28] this micro Christianity you ask this in
[2:07:31] two minutes you get it and you pray for
[2:07:34] this God does it oh that's not
[2:07:37] Christianity you know we we are in for a
[2:07:39] fight you know what I mean and and and
[2:07:42] even more so at the end when we get to
[2:07:44] the end if God is going to produce some
[2:07:47] characters it's not going to be just by
[2:07:49] anything there's going to come the fight
[2:07:51] there going to be where you say like
[2:07:52] Shadrach mesak and Abed go I'll stay
[2:07:55] here even if it doesn't do it I'm not
[2:07:58] going to move that's character right
[2:08:01] there and and that's what God is looking
[2:08:03] for at the end character is built to
[2:08:05] trials and two things and God is
[2:08:08] bringing out the best out of you where
[2:08:10] you are focused on one thing and one
[2:08:12] thing only like Jesus Christ I'm focused
[2:08:15] on his word and nothing else I'm focused
[2:08:18] on the father's will coming to pass in
[2:08:20] my life and nothing else whether I have
[2:08:23] don't have that means nothing well if
[2:08:26] you have all the world the the goods of
[2:08:29] the world and everything and and lose
[2:08:31] your soul what benefit will that be and
[2:08:34] God don't want us to be like you know
[2:08:36] SPO children's well you know father I
[2:08:38] need this and father no he's going to
[2:08:41] give you what you have need of he like
[2:08:44] our our brother said he's not going to
[2:08:45] tempt you above what you can do but God
[2:08:48] wants you at the same time to have some
[2:08:50] characters about you you know we we we
[2:08:54] get to where God wants us to be those
[2:08:56] that will take there's a life inside of
[2:08:58] us not to fight against flesh and blood
[2:09:01] but to stand up and say I'm not going to
[2:09:04] move I heard the word of God the word of
[2:09:07] God made a promise for me I'm going to
[2:09:10] stay there until that promise come to
[2:09:12] pass in my life I'm not if if the devil
[2:09:15] is coming in fact the purpose for the
[2:09:17] Devil is just to keep you sharp yeah I
[2:09:20] mean imagine if there was no devil if it
[2:09:22] was all bound up and everything we were
[2:09:25] going to be some fat Christians you know
[2:09:27] not good what would be what would that
[2:09:29] be the life we have inside of us is as
[2:09:31] for us to go fight with it you know it
[2:09:35] the the the buffeting is so we can
[2:09:36] sharpen up so we can build character so
[2:09:39] we can have our minds ready so we can be
[2:09:42] those that are just ready to take and
[2:09:45] how we going to rule it's that character
[2:09:47] that's going to be build in us when we
[2:09:50] sit there when some one when those that
[2:09:52] will come to be judged will have a
[2:09:54] character about us that's the same as
[2:09:56] the character that was in Christ that's
[2:09:58] what we desire above all the only thing
[2:10:01] we take out of here is our character and
[2:10:04] therefore God wants to work on that
[2:10:06] until we have it the way he wants us to
[2:10:09] have it amen I surely enjoy that you
[2:10:12] know I was sitting there as our brother
[2:10:13] was preaching I said you know I think we
[2:10:16] need to get the sickest preacher in the
[2:10:18] Pulpit you know it seems like that's
[2:10:20] really when you get the best service you
[2:10:22] know that's really when they get out of
[2:10:24] the way and they let God do his way you
[2:10:27] know so next time we need to find who's
[2:10:28] the sickest and then bring him in the
[2:10:31] Pulpit I like how God knows how to do
[2:10:34] things you know praise the Lord amen
[2:10:38] character building that's what that's
[2:10:41] the business we are in amen we
