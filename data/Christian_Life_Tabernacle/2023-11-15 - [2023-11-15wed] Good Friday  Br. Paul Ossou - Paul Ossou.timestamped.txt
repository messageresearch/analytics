[36:09] [Music]
[36:12] Services I believe uh is helped each one
[36:15] of us to come closer to the
[36:18] Lord to be a little more
[36:23] [Music]
[36:25] sealed that we may wear the the of the
[36:29] robe that's been
[36:33] given
[36:38] tonight when Brother David asked me to
[36:40] uh uh preach the word
[36:46] tonight I was asking myself after such a
[36:49] weekend what am I going to
[36:52] say uh after this uh uh powerful
[36:56] preachers
[36:57] [Music]
[37:02] uh something came to my spirit I had
[37:04] receive a
[37:05] notification
[37:07] early Black Friday early Black
[37:12] Friday early Black Friday
[37:16] um I had received a notification on my
[37:19] phone about early Black
[37:23] Friday so I wanted to know what is Black
[37:25] Friday
[37:30] and as I was looking I saw an image I'm
[37:32] not sure if the brothers could put it
[37:40] up Black Friday Black
[37:51] Friday and we were talking about it in
[37:53] the back and I was
[37:55] looking statistic I started looking at
[37:58] the
[38:01] statistics Black Friday they saying that
[38:04] just just the weekend of Black
[38:09] Friday that Americans they spend about
[38:13] 67 uh billion dollars just for the
[38:16] weekend of Black
[38:18] Friday
[38:21] Friday and if you take from Black Friday
[38:24] until the New
[38:25] Year's
[38:29] 1.14 trillion they spend about 1.4 1.14
[38:34] trillion
[38:37] dollars and as I was thinking about this
[38:39] a scripture came to my
[38:42] mind that we're going to
[38:45] read Isaiah
[38:53] 55
[38:55] is I Isaiah
[39:04] 55 the Bible
[39:09] says everyone that thirsted come to the
[39:17] waters and he that had no money come buy
[39:22] and
[39:25] eat come buy yeah come buy wine and mil
[39:32] milk without money without
[39:37] price wherefore do you spend money on
[39:40] that which is not
[39:45] bread and your labor for that which
[39:47] satisfi
[39:49] not thank
[39:55] you
[40:00] hearken diligently unto me and eat ye
[40:04] that which is
[40:07] good and let your soul Delight itself in
[40:11] my in
[40:14] fatness incline your ears and come unto
[40:17] come unto
[40:20] me here and your soul shall
[40:25] live
[40:28] I will make I will make an Everlasting
[40:31] Covenant with
[40:35] you even even the sure mercies of
[40:43] David Black
[40:45] Friday Black
[40:54] Friday I I I was I was read reading and
[40:56] they said it's a it's a a a commercial
[41:00] uh uh
[41:03] time Thanksgiving it's the it's the
[41:06] Friday after
[41:10] Thanksgiving so so it's next
[41:14] week so people are are preparing
[41:17] themselves for Black Friday for Black
[41:21] Friday to go spend
[41:25] money to to spend on
[41:28] what to buy
[41:33] what I seen uh pictures of people
[41:36] standing before stores since 4:00 a.m.
[41:38] in the
[41:40] morning because they want to be the
[41:42] first to enter into the
[41:46] stores to buy
[41:49] what we saw the image that was being
[41:53] projected uh for the main part people
[41:56] people buy
[41:58] TVs the one that brother bam
[42:01] calls uh uh hell
[42:07] Vision so the Black
[42:10] Friday people are going to go spend a
[42:12] lot of
[42:14] money to go buy hell
[42:21] Vision to to learn how to look into
[42:25] hell
[42:26] to how to prepare themselves to go in
[42:33] hell and the the the businessmen they
[42:36] claiming that they've lowered the
[42:41] prices so the same person who bought the
[42:45] that that item on Black
[42:49] [Music]
[42:50] Friday he will see his neighbor with
[42:52] something better than what he
[42:55] bought
[42:57] he will become unsatisfied and go try to
[42:59] buy
[43:06] another we have a Friday
[43:12] too good Friday that the Bible calls
[43:15] Good
[43:18] Friday that's the title of my message
[43:21] tonight Good Friday Good
[43:24] Friday amen
[43:31] man the Bible says he's born in
[43:35] sin is shaped in
[43:42] iniquity since our father Adam and Eve
[43:45] they left the position of the
[43:48] word we are coming into the world in
[43:54] sin so Man by Nature had to be
[44:00] condemned but but God not wanting to
[44:03] condemn the
[44:07] world he decided himself to Veil himself
[44:10] in a a body of
[44:13] Flesh to come and pay the price of our
[44:19] condemnation to come and give us
[44:24] Liberty and when Jesus
[44:27] came he lived like a
[44:31] [Music]
[44:33] man and we read the the picture of the
[44:37] end of his
[44:43] life when we read the same story in the
[44:46] Book of Matthew
[44:48] 27 there's a lot more
[44:54] details it was Jesus who was was
[44:57] innocent he only did
[45:01] good him which it was because of
[45:05] me because of my
[45:09] condition because of your condition
[45:15] AC he accepted the the most shameful
[45:21] death said he died of of uh uh a broken
[45:29] heart that it wasn't even the the the
[45:31] Roman spear that killed
[45:35] him but it was
[45:39] ridicu they they they spit upon
[45:44] him they they they Place upon him a
[45:47] crown of
[45:49] torn he he
[45:53] bled they took his clothes off
[45:59] sometimes the images that they present
[46:01] of Christ on the
[46:03] [Music]
[46:04] cross they put him with a little clothes
[46:08] on
[46:10] says he didn't have clothes
[46:12] on they took
[46:15] everything in front of his own
[46:19] Creation in front of his mom in the
[46:23] flesh this young man of 33 3 years old
[46:27] CRF crucified
[46:30] naked because of
[46:34] me because of
[46:39] you uh that it was a very pathetic
[46:44] scene even the sun couldn't handle
[46:48] it the scripture says that the sun hid
[46:54] itself there was uh Darkness just right
[46:58] in the middle of the
[46:59] day Black Friday it was a Black
[47:07] Friday he was crucified on
[47:11] Friday it was dark that
[47:16] day because one man went to the
[47:21] Cross not to lower the
[47:24] price
[47:26] so that you may have a a part to
[47:30] play but so that he can pay the whole
[47:36] price so that you don't have to pay
[47:43] anything
[47:48] says that on that day at the C on that
[47:51] day at
[47:53] Calvary paragraph 41
[48:00] it may seem a little it says it may seem
[48:02] like it would be a little out of
[48:07] season they preached this uh sermon on
[48:10] in
[48:15] September so it seems like it was to pre
[48:18] uh he he preached it earlier that he
[48:20] should have normally preached it uh uh
[48:23] uh in
[48:24] April as we do it
[48:27] tonight so it was out of
[48:34] season but our Good Friday is every
[48:41] day it's it's every day that we have a
[48:45] free access to the grace of God at every
[48:53] moment it says it would look like like
[48:56] uh it would look to be a little out of
[49:00] season uh this should be on on a good
[49:05] Friday Calvary should be remembered
[49:08] every
[49:11] day we've heard so much about
[49:16] it read so much about
[49:20] it preachers preached on
[49:23] it since the beginning of time
[49:28] singers have sang of
[49:33] it Through the Ages Prophet foretold of
[49:43] it and the prophets of these days they
[49:46] point back to when it did
[49:50] happen it's such an important
[49:54] day
[49:57] that's one of the most important days of
[50:00] all the days that God ever let drawn on
[50:04] Earth it's one it's it's one of the most
[50:07] important
[50:11] days and it's so important to the human
[50:18] race I think it's good for us to go
[50:24] back and
[50:29] examine see just what it means to
[50:35] us for I'm sure at the late hour that we
[50:38] are living
[50:45] in we are seeking every every important
[50:49] importance of God that we that we can
[50:52] know that we can
[50:54] know
[50:56] the day on the which we are living
[51:01] in it's a time that should call upon
[51:08] us to try to know more about the
[51:11] importance of
[51:14] God to come closer to
[51:20] God and all that we can find
[51:24] out we are here to learn of
[51:30] it to see what is for us and what God
[51:34] has done for
[51:37] us and see what he's promised to do for
[51:42] us and that's what we come to church
[51:46] for that's why the preacher
[51:51] preaches that's why he studies and
[51:53] medita in the scriptures
[51:56] and seeks the for
[52:02] inspiration it's because he is a public
[52:05] servant to God's
[52:09] people he's trying to find
[52:13] something that God would uh that God
[52:16] would have to say to his
[52:19] people something that would help
[52:24] them
[52:25] maybe it would be condemned them in
[52:28] their
[52:31] sins but it will help them to rise them
[52:35] up that they might forsake their
[52:40] sins and then raise up to to serve the
[52:46] Lord and ministers should seek these
[52:51] things and this day being so important
[52:55] [Music]
[52:58] one of the greatest
[53:04] days let us look at three different
[53:07] things uh that day meant to
[53:11] us we're going to come back to
[53:14] this we
[53:19] see that day was one of the most
[53:22] important
[53:24] days
[53:28] everyone that's running after Black
[53:34] Friday they can stay from uh uh 400 a.m.
[53:37] until in the afternoon standing in front
[53:40] of a
[53:43] store when the service at church takes
[53:46] three hours they get
[53:54] mad but over there he's going to spend
[54:02] money with the even the the the true
[54:06] understanding that even when they say
[54:07] they lower the price it's just a way to
[54:09] take your
[54:12] money but you are running for
[54:18] it you're going to look to
[54:23] buy but the tells
[54:26] us you that that that are
[54:29] thirsty come to the
[54:31] water come
[54:33] buying you come to buy but the Bible is
[54:37] saying that it's without
[54:40] money and without
[54:47] price and it's the most important thing
[54:51] in
[54:53] life what we're going to buy on Black
[54:58] Friday the young sisters can go buy
[55:01] things so they can make themselves
[55:05] pretty so they can attract more
[55:14] people to take him away from
[55:19] God they pay to go further from God
[55:25] but to come closer to
[55:27] God we have nothing to
[55:30] pay it's without
[55:33] money and without
[55:36] price because a man climbed the
[55:41] cross he took my
[55:43] place he took your
[55:50] place to give us the most satisfying
[55:54] thing
[55:58] people run away they run to this Black
[56:01] Friday because they're not
[56:07] satisfied there's the same thing that he
[56:10] bought that
[56:12] morning sometimes he gets home that
[56:16] evening he realizes oh there's one
[56:19] better than
[56:21] this with a price lower than this one
[56:26] so he wants to go and take it
[56:28] back
[56:30] why he's not
[56:34] satisfied but the price that Jesus
[56:38] Paid if we can only have access to
[56:43] that we'll have a satisfaction for the
[56:45] entire
[56:50] life Jesus climbed on the
[56:53] cross but R
[56:59] says that he he climbed on Calvary so he
[57:03] can resolve the sin
[57:05] question all
[57:08] right he went to the Cross so he can
[57:10] solve and and resolve this sin
[57:17] question it's to say that the
[57:23] sinner has the right to come back on the
[57:28] road and to to walk on a
[57:32] road that he's not going to be taken off
[57:35] again Isaiah was announcing the coming
[57:37] of the
[57:40] Lord uh verse four the Bible
[57:46] says say to them that are of a fearful
[57:51] heart be
[57:53] strong fear
[57:55] not behold your
[57:59] God will come with
[58:02] vengeance even god with
[58:06] recompense he will come and save
[58:10] you
[58:15] himself then the eyes of the blind shall
[58:17] be
[58:19] opened and the ears of the death shall
[58:22] shall be
[58:23] unstopped
[58:27] then the lame man leaps as as a as an
[58:33] heart and the tongue of the dumb
[58:38] sing for in the wilderness shall water
[58:42] break
[58:44] out and streams in the
[58:47] desert verse
[58:51] eight and an Highway shall be there
[58:56] and a
[58:58] way it shall be called the way of
[59:03] Holiness the unclean the unclean shall
[59:06] not pass over
[59:08] it but it shall
[59:12] be for
[59:18] those the way
[59:20] man the way man it says though the fool
[59:24] shall not Heir what they
[59:27] in the Bible
[59:30] says when Jesus will
[59:33] come that he will open he will
[59:36] inaugurate a new
[59:39] way the the unpure the unclean man
[59:42] cannot walk on that
[59:46] road but it's a
[59:49] road that the one that the the
[59:53] fool cannot go
[59:56] sideways what do that
[1:00:01] mean that everyone has access to this
[1:00:06] highway but when you get on that
[1:00:10] Highway when you go past the
[1:00:14] cross when you when you get access to
[1:00:17] what Jesus done at the
[1:00:19] cross that even if you were a
[1:00:22] fool that even if you were
[1:00:27] sinner even if you were the rank Sinners
[1:00:30] of the
[1:00:32] world Jesus had inaugurate this
[1:00:36] highway so that you will not air
[1:00:40] anymore that when you got on that
[1:00:43] Highway you become
[1:00:46] pure that's why there are no impure on
[1:00:50] this it doesn't mean it's people that
[1:00:53] never sin
[1:00:55] but it
[1:00:57] means that all those that get gain
[1:01:00] access to this
[1:01:03] highway they have accepted the price
[1:01:05] that was paid at
[1:01:09] Calvary they have accepted that the sin
[1:01:12] questions have been
[1:01:14] resolved and Jesus
[1:01:17] himself will place them on that
[1:01:21] way where they can never a again
[1:01:25] privil what a
[1:01:30] privilege without
[1:01:32] money without paying
[1:01:36] anything just to accept
[1:01:39] it
[1:01:42] says uh the same message that day on
[1:01:47] Calvary uh paragraph
[1:01:53] 44
[1:01:55] it says one great important thing that
[1:01:58] Calvary means to us and the
[1:02:05] world is it settles the same question
[1:02:08] once and for
[1:02:12] all he settled the same question once
[1:02:15] for
[1:02:18] all he will never come back to the same
[1:02:21] question
[1:02:23] again the the a sinner can only
[1:02:27] accept the price that was
[1:02:30] paid there will not be a second price to
[1:02:33] be
[1:02:35] paid because the price was paid in
[1:02:41] totality it was settled once for
[1:02:46] all man was found guilty of
[1:02:53] sin and sin was a penalty that no man
[1:02:56] could
[1:03:00] pay the penalty was so great until there
[1:03:03] wasn't anyone that could pay the
[1:03:09] penalty I truly believe that God
[1:03:11] ordained it to be that
[1:03:14] way that the penalty will be so
[1:03:18] great that no man could pay
[1:03:22] it so he could do
[1:03:26] it
[1:03:30] himself so he could do it
[1:03:34] himself what father we
[1:03:40] have now the penalty the penalty of sin
[1:03:44] was
[1:03:46] death and we were all born in
[1:03:49] sin sh in
[1:03:52] iniquity came to the world speak
[1:03:57] life therefore there wasn't there wasn't
[1:04:00] none of us that was
[1:04:05] worthy and and or they could find one no
[1:04:10] one on Earth that was
[1:04:15] worthy you you don't have to say that
[1:04:17] I'm not
[1:04:20] worthy God is not asking for you to be
[1:04:23] worthy
[1:04:26] he is the one that's
[1:04:28] worthy and he paid the
[1:04:32] price so the question is settled once
[1:04:35] and for
[1:04:38] all so the sin will not longer held you
[1:04:44] captive so that the sin will not hold
[1:04:46] you no
[1:04:49] longer so you don't have to be Christian
[1:04:52] today and non-Christian
[1:04:55] tomorrow he paid the
[1:05:01] price Good Friday so when we get access
[1:05:04] to this Good
[1:05:08] Friday that we may possess all the good
[1:05:14] things that will satisfy us all the
[1:05:18] time what's what's in the
[1:05:23] world whatever we can possess that's in
[1:05:25] the
[1:05:27] world it's it's it's just
[1:05:29] vanity we can have it
[1:05:32] today and in a fraction of a second it's
[1:05:35] gone we're
[1:05:38] Los think about what's happening today
[1:05:40] in
[1:05:42] Gaza there were probably people that own
[1:05:45] buildings but
[1:05:48] today they are maybe in the refugee
[1:05:53] camp just looking for a piece of bread
[1:05:56] to
[1:06:00] eat because it's not
[1:06:03] satisfying but what what is
[1:06:08] satisfying the price that Jesus
[1:06:14] Paid tells a
[1:06:16] story I forgot in what
[1:06:20] [Music]
[1:06:22] message he said was soldiers that were
[1:06:25] going
[1:06:26] somewhere and when they were
[1:06:29] passing there was an
[1:06:33] island and there were women that were
[1:06:35] singing
[1:06:38] wonderful and and the songs were so
[1:06:42] enticing that every
[1:06:45] time that in for this soldiers to
[1:06:48] continue their
[1:06:50] Journey that they would Veer and go to
[1:06:53] that place
[1:06:54] and they will fall into the the Ambush
[1:06:58] and they will kill
[1:06:59] them and one
[1:07:01] day there was another
[1:07:04] Expedition and and the the the the
[1:07:07] captain of this
[1:07:12] troop and he asked the people with
[1:07:16] him I want you to bind me on the
[1:07:20] pole I want you to tie my
[1:07:22] mouth
[1:07:27] I want you to to to plug my
[1:07:29] ears I want you to plug my
[1:07:34] ears he him oh
[1:07:37] sorry to plug the ears of the
[1:07:40] soldiers he himself his ears were open
[1:07:44] but his mouth was closed and his hands
[1:07:47] were
[1:07:48] tied and as we were coming to this
[1:07:52] place he started hearing this enticing
[1:07:56] music and he started screaming at his
[1:07:59] soldiers let's
[1:08:01] go but no no none of them could hear him
[1:08:05] they went and passed that place and they
[1:08:08] came to the
[1:08:10] destination and when they got to where
[1:08:12] they were going as they were
[1:08:17] passing they they heard such a wonderful
[1:08:22] music it was so
[1:08:26] [Music]
[1:08:27] marvelous far better than the enticing
[1:08:30] music of the this
[1:08:33] women they finished their
[1:08:35] mission and on the way
[1:08:38] back they soldiers ask
[1:08:41] him do you want us to tell you again do
[1:08:44] you want us to to to to to mute your
[1:08:47] mouth he said no you don't have to do
[1:08:50] that he said what I heard over there
[1:08:54] is higher so
[1:08:56] high I against that one that the women
[1:08:59] are playing over there he says let's
[1:09:02] go I won't even need to hear
[1:09:06] that it's the same way with the
[1:09:08] Christian
[1:09:10] walk when we get access to
[1:09:14] the when we really meet
[1:09:17] Christ when the price of sin has been
[1:09:21] paid we don't care we we don't we're not
[1:09:24] fearing
[1:09:25] anymore of whatever it
[1:09:29] is because what we have
[1:09:33] tasted what we have
[1:09:36] bought without
[1:09:37] money without
[1:09:40] price is so
[1:09:43] high against what's been proposed to us
[1:09:47] with
[1:09:50] money
[1:09:52] says
[1:09:55] um still in that day on
[1:09:58] Calvary paragraph
[1:10:02] 61 the price that was
[1:10:08] paid and the bondage of Satan was
[1:10:17] broken God put back in the hands of man
[1:10:20] a way back to what he was looking for
[1:10:25] he had he he says he had to weep no
[1:10:31] more that it says hit when he broke the
[1:10:34] backbone of
[1:10:35] Satan there at
[1:10:38] Calvary the backbone of sin of
[1:10:46] sickness and he brings every Mortal
[1:10:49] being on the earth back into the
[1:10:52] presence of God
[1:10:55] with sins forgiven hallelujah
[1:10:59] hallelujah our sins are
[1:11:04] forgiven no more can Satan back us off
[1:11:08] from
[1:11:09] God back us from
[1:11:14] God it says there's a highway
[1:11:18] made as we heard in
[1:11:22] Isaiah there's a telephone setting
[1:11:29] there there's a line to
[1:11:36] Glory bring every person in reach to
[1:11:39] that
[1:11:41] line in the Old
[1:11:47] Testament only the high priest had the
[1:11:50] the right to the access to the holy of
[1:11:52] holies
[1:11:54] there was a
[1:11:56] veil but we
[1:11:58] read that when when Christ screamed at
[1:12:02] the
[1:12:04] cross it said that the veil of the
[1:12:06] temple was rented
[1:12:08] into it means every
[1:12:11] man has access to the holy of
[1:12:15] Hol every man can access the
[1:12:20] holy it's no longer exclusive to the
[1:12:23] high for
[1:12:25] himself highway but a
[1:12:29] highway a telephone
[1:12:33] line that is tying
[1:12:37] us it
[1:12:42] says he
[1:12:46] says every man has access to this
[1:12:51] line if a man is full of of
[1:12:56] sin it connected him it connect it
[1:13:00] connected him in on the
[1:13:04] central he can be forgiven of that
[1:13:09] sin not only
[1:13:15] that but that sin is paid
[1:13:21] for you don't have to say I'm not
[1:13:25] worthy sure you are
[1:13:28] not you never could
[1:13:32] be but a worthy
[1:13:35] one took your
[1:13:38] place you are
[1:13:41] free you don't have to wonder
[1:13:48] anymore you don't have to be a pleasure
[1:13:51] seeking man out here on on the
[1:13:57] earth for there is a fountain filled
[1:14:00] with with blood drawn from Emmanuel's
[1:14:04] vein where sin is plunged beneath the
[1:14:10] flood lose all the guilty
[1:14:14] stain you don't have to be
[1:14:16] lost in other
[1:14:21] word no one has the right to be
[1:14:25] lost because there's a
[1:14:28] highway or where even the
[1:14:32] fool he cannot
[1:14:35] air but the only
[1:14:39] condition is to accept the price that
[1:14:41] was
[1:14:44] paid and to become
[1:14:47] that because on this
[1:14:49] highway there's no more
[1:14:52] impure the Sinners
[1:14:55] washed you be you get on the highway you
[1:14:59] are no longer
[1:15:01] impure he
[1:15:04] says there's a there's a
[1:15:06] highway a
[1:15:09] way and it's called the way of
[1:15:13] Holiness the unclean pass not over don't
[1:15:17] pass over it
[1:15:21] for he comes through the Fountain
[1:15:23] through the
[1:15:26] fountain through the fountain first then
[1:15:29] he enters the
[1:15:31] highway he goes through the cross
[1:15:35] first then he comes and he gets on the
[1:15:38] highway where he can no longer
[1:15:42] a where Satan can no longer claim
[1:15:45] anything out of
[1:15:48] you where Satan can no longer hold you
[1:15:51] captive or anything that he would
[1:15:55] like he
[1:15:59] says he broke the power of
[1:16:04] Satan he opened the prison's door of
[1:16:10] Hell through every man that was shut up
[1:16:13] in this
[1:16:15] earth in in the prison fearing when he
[1:16:18] would
[1:16:21] die what death will be to
[1:16:26] him on Calvary he opened those cell
[1:16:32] doors let every captive Go
[1:16:38] free you don't have to no you don't have
[1:16:41] to no longer be torn down by
[1:16:46] sin you don't have you have you don't
[1:16:49] have to no longer yield your member to
[1:16:51] sin drink drinking smoking gambling
[1:16:56] telling
[1:16:59] lies you can be
[1:17:03] honest just and
[1:17:07] upright and Satan can do nothing about
[1:17:12] it because you've got a hold of the
[1:17:16] line a
[1:17:20] Lifeline that's anchored in the Rock of
[1:17:22] Ages
[1:17:25] nothing can shake you from
[1:17:28] it no wind can shake you from it no
[1:17:33] nothing not even death
[1:17:37] itself can separate us from the love of
[1:17:40] God that's in Christ
[1:17:48] Jesus Jesus says answer the sin
[1:17:52] question
[1:17:54] he he he fulfilled a double experation
[1:17:57] on the
[1:17:58] cross the salvation of our
[1:18:01] souls and the healing of our
[1:18:05] body because the Bible says it's by his
[1:18:09] stripes that we were
[1:18:13] healed so if sickness come
[1:18:16] today the good
[1:18:19] news is that our healing
[1:18:26] was already gotten before we can even
[1:18:28] become
[1:18:30] sin
[1:18:33] sick everything what God is asking of us
[1:18:37] is to remember the
[1:18:39] promise that oh I'm sick in my body
[1:18:43] today but I see
[1:18:45] here that the price was already
[1:18:49] paid that sickness can no longer hold me
[1:18:52] captive
[1:18:54] that that sickness can no longer
[1:18:58] resist and and sometimes it doesn't ask
[1:19:01] a lot of
[1:19:02] effort faith is
[1:19:08] simple uh the
[1:19:11] day the day before
[1:19:16] yesterday my wife came back and she said
[1:19:18] she was not feeling
[1:19:20] well uh she said she felt like heartbeat
[1:19:23] was really high
[1:19:26] fast I took a uh uh uh blood pressure uh
[1:19:30] uh
[1:19:32] instrument I measured
[1:19:35] it and it seems like her heart was
[1:19:37] beating a little
[1:19:38] fast uh
[1:19:43] 92 uh the normal one is between 80 uh uh
[1:19:46] 60 and
[1:19:48] 80 I finished to do that I said let's
[1:19:52] pray
[1:19:54] I said Lord Heal my wife I don't want
[1:19:58] this thing in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:20:02] amen I I took the the meter I I said
[1:20:05] let's try again we did
[1:20:08] again it went back down to 80 and she
[1:20:12] was
[1:20:13] happy just as
[1:20:15] simple we didn't
[1:20:17] scream it's a
[1:20:19] promise it's what God has given us
[1:20:24] we don't have to agitate ourselves to
[1:20:29] clean we don't have to to to beg Satan
[1:20:32] for
[1:20:34] it he has no right for
[1:20:38] you the price was already
[1:20:41] paid the Good Friday for
[1:20:44] us has taken care of
[1:20:48] everything we have nothing to
[1:20:51] pay we simply come to the
[1:20:55] store and we we claim what what belongs
[1:20:58] to us already and if we believe
[1:21:02] it God will give it to
[1:21:07] us
[1:21:18] says and uh in the message without price
[1:21:21] without money
[1:21:23] paragraph
[1:21:25] 39 he
[1:21:28] says and
[1:21:33] remember you've got to settle up to
[1:21:36] settle up with God someday for
[1:21:40] it and the wages of sin is
[1:21:46] death you don't make you don't make
[1:21:48] nothing here on Earth by
[1:21:51] it
[1:21:53] it's just a false
[1:21:57] Mirage drinking will only add
[1:22:03] Sorrows sin will only add death upon
[1:22:11] death your final check will be will be
[1:22:15] separ separation from God
[1:22:20] eternally and into the lake of fire and
[1:22:23] you cannot you cannot gain anything but
[1:22:28] lose paragraph
[1:22:36] 40 then God comes and asks the
[1:22:42] questions why do you spend your
[1:22:45] money for those things which satisfied
[1:22:49] not why do you do
[1:22:51] it
[1:22:55] what makes men want to do to do
[1:23:01] it they spend all that they spend all
[1:23:05] that they've got on all that they can
[1:23:08] earn to buy drink to buy
[1:23:14] drinking to or to close some women that
[1:23:17] they run
[1:23:20] with or some kind of worldly lustful
[1:23:26] Pleasures but it says but we are told in
[1:23:29] the
[1:23:32] Bible and our B to come to
[1:23:36] God to buy Eternal
[1:23:40] joy and eternal
[1:23:42] life without money without
[1:23:49] price those things cannot satisfy
[1:23:53] and the end of them is eternal
[1:23:59] death and he cost you all the money that
[1:24:02] you can Master up Master
[1:24:07] together to be a a big shot or an
[1:24:12] Entertainer or fun boy or whatever you

[1:24:43] world
[1:24:46] does only reaps a check of Eternal
[1:24:51] damnation
[1:24:53] paragraph
[1:24:57] 65 when God finds you in the ditch of
[1:25:02] sin and hear you calling on
[1:25:09] him he sends down a chain that was
[1:25:12] wrapped around

[1:41:07] truth
[1:41:10] [Music]
[1:41:19] I
[1:41:22] [Music]
[1:41:28] amen what a
[1:41:30] message you know that message should be
[1:41:33] on the lips of every
[1:41:35] believer that's what we're what we
[1:41:38] share I thought
[1:41:41] when Paul read the statement that people
[1:41:44] stay in the
[1:41:45] ditch because they can't pay for
[1:41:49] it boy What a Sad
[1:41:55] state but it's free it's without money
[1:41:59] it's without price and that's what our
[1:42:01] message
[1:42:03] is to the lost to the bruised to the
[1:42:07] wounded to the
[1:42:09] defeated hey you don't have to do
[1:42:12] nothing he did it all amen I hope that
[1:42:16] can set deep in our heart ask you to
[1:42:19] continue pray for me and
[1:42:21] and I got a prayer request I'd like you
[1:42:23] to take on your heart
[1:42:26] smile my sister's back in the hospital
[1:42:29] and she's a severe alcoholic
[1:42:34] and so she decides she doesn't want to
[1:42:37] live and then she drinks herself to a
[1:42:41] point where she's got alcohol poisoning
[1:42:44] so bad she's fixing to die and then she
[1:42:47] decides she doesn't want to die so she
[1:42:51] rushes back into the hospital and and
[1:42:55] it's just a terrible cycle of alcoholism
[1:43:01] that she's bound with drug abuse and
[1:43:04] other things
[1:43:06] but
[1:43:07] uh anyway she can't help
[1:43:11] herself the only help for her is is what
[1:43:15] Paul spoke of
[1:43:19] tonight and as you know
[1:43:22] uh being a sibling she probably won't
[1:43:25] hear it from
[1:43:28] us you know we're just who we are you
[1:43:31] know in the
[1:43:33] family but maybe God could send somebody
[1:43:37] by to her that could explain that
[1:43:40] there's been a price paid for her and
[1:43:43] that price has the power over
[1:43:46] alcoholism it has the power over
[1:43:49] depression it has that the power over a
[1:43:52] defeated life and that she might come to
[1:43:55] know that there's been a price paid
[1:43:59] would you keep that on your heart amen
[1:44:03] if if you would also if a few of your
[1:44:05] brothers have an opportunity in the next
[1:44:07] few days we need to run all the security
[1:44:11] cameras inside a church we could
[1:44:13] certainly use some help but let us just
[1:44:15] bow our heads for a moment
[1:44:19] now and I just like to ask you a
[1:44:22] question in your
[1:44:26] heart have you
[1:44:29] [Music]
[1:44:33] accepted everything that Jesus has
[1:44:36] purchased for you this
[1:44:39] evening are you still holding back on a
[1:44:42] few dark spots
[1:44:45] because you don't want to turn it all
[1:44:48] over to him tonight
[1:44:52] tonight but would you take a moment and
[1:44:56] say Lord I've tried to overcome I've
[1:44:58] tried to do this but I heard tonight
[1:45:02] that a chain that
[1:45:04] was wrapped around
[1:45:08] Calvary can come down
[1:45:11] and put its hooks in my
[1:45:15] heart and pull me from the darkness that
[1:45:21] [Music]
[1:45:22] surrounds
[1:45:25] me that maybe nobody else
[1:45:28] sees nobody else knows
[1:45:32] exists but Lord I know it's
[1:45:35] [Music]
[1:45:37] there and tonight I'm
[1:45:40] asking that you give me the grace to
[1:45:44] [Music]
[1:45:45] accept and that you would begin pulling
[1:45:47] me
[1:45:48] from this place
[1:45:52] to a higher
[1:45:55] place that I can rise from the
[1:45:59] shadows and the sin that so easily
[1:46:02] besets
[1:46:03] me and father that I can set my feet on
[1:46:07] that
[1:46:08] Highway and walk in the joy and the
[1:46:12] peace that is Christ
[1:46:15] [Music]

[1:46:21] lifted you see a heart if it's

[1:46:27] grant that tonight father we're thankful
[1:46:30] for this wonderful message that brother
