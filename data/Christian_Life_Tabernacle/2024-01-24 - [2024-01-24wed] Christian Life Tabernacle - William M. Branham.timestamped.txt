[31:11] [Music]
[31:14] and father
[31:17] the world not we even wishing to retain
[31:20] you in their
[31:22] thinking the Great Dark perilous time
[31:26] that we
[31:28] live but your love is steadfast toward
[31:31] us and you'll set us free from every
[31:34] snare we're just so grateful for that
[31:37] this evening Lord we just ask you to
[31:40] bless us and be with us in your precious
[31:43] and wonderful name we pray amen amen
[31:49] Lord bless you tonight uh we're going to
[31:51] listen tonight to 40 minutes of the uh
[31:57] sermon I believe it's uh God's power to
[32:01] transform all right and uh so we're
[32:04] going to start where he reads the
[32:07] scripture and U oh thank you musicians
[32:10] and so much enjoyed that special tonight
[32:13] and the opening prayer and all that is
[32:16] just wonderful but I still can't see
[32:19] real good so uh just keep me in your
[32:23] prayer uh I I know I'm getting better
[32:27] um but uh we'll just do it and and uh
[32:32] it's kind of a a little hard time in my
[32:35] life right now uh with my mom and uh you
[32:39] know she's getting older but she's still
[32:42] doing really well I guess she's getting
[32:45] older she'll be
[32:46] 102 so uh uh we're grateful to have her
[32:50] and she's still in good spirits and
[32:52] still happy and of course you know that
[32:55] uh we're going through CR time uh with
[32:58] my sister and and uh dealing with the
[33:04] her alcoholism and we're trying to get
[33:06] her into rehab and that's a burden on my
[33:09] mom but I'm glad God's got an answer for
[33:12] it all and that answers his
[33:15] word and you know nothing can be done
[33:19] unless God speaks it yes amen everything
[33:23] came into the world before there ever
[33:25] was a star or everything
[33:27] God in his great mind he had it in his
[33:29] mind but he had to say Let There Be Amen
[33:33] Let There Be and along those lines he
[33:36] spoke your name and he put you in that
[33:39] Lamb's Book of Life and he sealed you
[33:42] there and nothing can put your name on
[33:45] there and nothing can take it off and
[33:48] and if we could anchor our faith and the
[33:52] reason I want to play this little uh
[33:55] portion of God's power to transform
[33:58] because many times we get discouraged
[34:01] with
[34:02] ourselves but if we can understand that
[34:05] God's got the power to
[34:08] transform and when that seed is planted
[34:11] into the ground that little corn seed
[34:13] that little wheat seed it and it it it
[34:17] rots away and then that little blade
[34:20] start starts up its desire is to become
[34:25] a a a wheat again but all in between
[34:28] that is the power of
[34:30] transformation God transforming it and
[34:33] bringing it to what that he had in his
[34:37] mind and that's what we have to have
[34:39] faith in tonight so uh we're just going
[34:42] to go right into it we're going to
[34:43] listen to 40 minutes and then uh if
[34:47] you'd like to uh there's two great
[34:49] messages uh God's power of to transform
[34:54] and the power of God's transformation
[34:57] and we're on Sunday morning we'll be
[34:59] speaking from uh the these two uh
[35:03] sources and so tonight's just kind of a
[35:07] Prelude and I I I'm I'm looking forward
[35:10] to God's word and the excitement of it
[35:13] and really what he wants us to Anchor
[35:16] our faith in and uh remember we can't do
[35:21] anything without him but with him we can
[35:26] do all all things amen and and boy if we
[35:29] could just get to that and there's a
[35:32] little remarkable place in this tape
[35:35] where brother brandom talks about a
[35:37] sister in a wheelchair I want you to
[35:40] play pay special attention to that so
[35:43] let us go ahead and start uh I believe
[35:46] they're going to start around paragraph
[35:48] uh
[35:49] 37 and brother bram's going to uh turn
[35:52] over and begin to read in the Book of
[35:55] Romans so uh soon as he's done reading
[35:58] the scripture go ahead and take your
[36:00] seat and just listen intently it won't
[36:03] be long and then uh we'll just finish up
[36:07] our service this evening so keep me in
[36:09] your prayers and uh I I I know that I'm
[36:12] in the palm of his hand and nothing can
[36:15] pluck me out and I you rejoice in the
[36:18] good times right and we rejoice in the
[36:20] bad times and if we're going to reain
[36:22] with them we have to suffer with them
[36:25] and uh uh what I'm going through is not
[36:28] nearly uh what I've seen a lot of people
[36:31] go through so uh I'm just I'm grateful
[36:33] for God for all his goodness and Grace
[36:37] to me you know I can see good enough to
[36:39] drive uh but uh it's the small things
[36:44] that I can't see but uh I know I'll be
[36:46] all right I know that I know that for a
[36:49] fact amen and not only that I'm going to
[36:52] get a new body and and I'm going to have
[36:55] hair
[36:58] and uh uh and I'm going to be able to
[37:01] see and hear and and it's going to be
[37:03] wonderful amen amen so I've had a lot of
[37:07] good years on life and and uh whenever
[37:10] he chooses to take me I I want to be
[37:13] ready to go and I want to be glad to go
[37:16] and I want to be able to say like Paul
[37:18] said I fought a good fight I've ran the
[37:20] race now I'm waiting for the crown so
[37:23] God bless you tonight as we enjoy our
[37:26] Prophet m messenger also I'd like to
[37:27] thank all the brothers that ministered
[37:30] uh David Jr and the wonderful job he did
[37:35] uh Billy and Paul and brother Andrew and
[37:39] Matthew and brother Beno I just thought
[37:41] it was just outstanding so Lord's richly
[37:44] blessed us let us enjoy our messenger
[37:46] tonight amen so God bless you tonight
[37:49] let's pray father bless this word to us
[37:51] this evening we pray in Jesus's
[37:54] wonderful name amen
[38:01] a very familiar chapter I want to take a
[38:05] a few verses here and about first two or
[38:08] three verses two verses I think it is
[38:10] and read and in this uh try to explain
[38:14] it the best that I know how by the help
[38:16] of the Holy
[38:17] Spirit Romans the 12th chapter I beseech
[38:21] you therefore Brethren by the mercies of
[38:23] God that you present your bodies a
[38:26] living sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[38:29] God which is your reasonable service I
[38:33] thought that was so beautiful for this
[38:35] group this morning what you
[38:37] do now and and is a conjunction as I
[38:40] understand and be not conformed to this
[38:44] world but be ye transformed by the
[38:48] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[38:51] what is that good and acceptable and
[38:54] perfect will of God
[38:57] that's what we all want to do is be not
[39:01] conformed to this world but be
[39:04] transformed by the renewing of our mind
[39:08] to do the perfect and acceptable will of
[39:11] God now that we have been saved as we
[39:14] are and that we have been filled with
[39:17] the Holy Spirit as we have now we want
[39:21] the mind that was in Christ to be in us
[39:24] that we might be trans form from the
[39:27] Natural Things of Life uh and be brought
[39:30] in to do the perfect will of God by
[39:33] transformation of God's spirit by his
[39:37] word now my subject is the power of
[39:40] transformation I may leave my Bible here
[39:44] I used to be years ago when I was a
[39:46] young man like these men I I didn't have
[39:48] to set down my scriptures and and things
[39:51] when I was studying but now since I have
[39:54] uh getting old I I carry me a little
[39:57] book and I and when I get something my
[40:00] jot it down have to put it on the
[40:02] scripture used to I just had that line
[40:04] of scriptures right in my mind I just
[40:06] come right down but dear friends I'm not
[40:09] young like you all this morning but I'm
[40:12] old and I've been through many hard
[40:15] battles see and by going through those
[40:17] hard battles brings you where you are
[40:19] this morning you see so I'm sure you
[40:22] understand that God has put me through
[40:23] it that my life might open up a to say
[40:27] this is it see then you all run over
[40:29] that road but before me there was
[40:31] someone opened up the way for me to go
[40:33] see and we open up the road one far the
[40:35] other and as you see sometime an old
[40:38] veteran getting old and his uh marks all
[40:40] over him as Paul said one time I bear in
[40:43] my body the marks of Jesus Christ you
[40:45] see how Timothy looked upon those marks
[40:48] I guess with reverence as he committed
[40:50] to Young Timothy now um
[40:54] transforming used to work for a Public
[40:56] Service Company where we had
[40:58] Transformers and to transform now the
[41:01] word is the word means in itself uh
[41:05] something uh like uh to transform means
[41:08] something has been changed something has
[41:10] changed from one thing to another and as
[41:13] I want to speak for the next 45 minutes
[41:16] or an hour on on the
[41:19] transforming I would like to to use uh
[41:24] this text and I I may say some things in
[41:27] you it seems very strange and as brother
[41:29] Le always just said take it this study
[41:31] over a little while see just think of it
[41:34] part a little bit to be transformed is
[41:36] to be changed to made something
[41:39] different like a a
[41:42] tadpole is transformed from a tadpole to
[41:45] a frog see once he's a looks like a
[41:48] catfish he swims around he's got a head
[41:52] and his tail and everything looks just
[41:54] like a a catfish then after while he
[41:56] begins to lose he loses the tail and
[41:59] he's he's transformed from one species
[42:02] to another I think that's what Paul must
[42:04] have had in mind when he said be
[42:06] transformed by the by the renewing see
[42:10] let me get that right and be not
[42:12] conformed you know what conformed is be
[42:14] not conformed to this world but be ye
[42:17] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[42:20] renewing of your mind the things that
[42:22] you once thought upon to be precious lay
[42:24] that aside and be trans form to
[42:27] something else to what you was one time
[42:30] to what you are now see by the renewing
[42:33] of your mind that you might prove that
[42:37] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[42:40] God oh that's what we all want to know
[42:42] how to do it see we're here we love him
[42:45] he saved us now we want to know what to
[42:47] do and we were trying to take a little
[42:49] step this morning to raise up this a
[42:51] little bit higher sometimes we have to
[42:53] hit things that just hold on for a few
[42:55] till we we see what it comes out to be
[42:57] now in Genesis the first chapter the
[43:00] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[43:04] waters we realize that the water the
[43:08] Bible said in the beginning uh back
[43:10] there that this the world was without
[43:12] farm and was void there was nothing but
[43:15] just a darkness of chaos and uh and what
[43:19] a horrible shape it must have been in
[43:21] nothing but way into the darkness Yonder
[43:25] without light or anything and the
[43:26] churning of the water that wandering
[43:29] star um twisted around and around the
[43:33] orbits out there somewhere it must have
[43:35] been a a terrific mass of
[43:40] of something lost like it was couldn't
[43:43] find its way and that's what we become
[43:45] when we become wandering Stars away from
[43:48] God just without hope without god
[43:51] without just turning around out in
[43:53] darkness not knowing when we're where
[43:54] we're going and God took that great
[43:57] chaos of darkness and transformed it
[44:01] into a Garden of Eden see by his word
[44:05] that's how we're transformed by God's
[44:07] word when God said let there be light
[44:11] and that mass of creation out there come
[44:15] over in around the Sun and begin to
[44:17] revolve around the Sun and became a
[44:19] Garden of Eden because it obeyed the
[44:21] word of God it done the perfect will of
[44:24] God for it was transform from chaos into
[44:28] a Garden of Eden by the word of God now
[44:32] that's what we are here for that's my
[44:34] message has been all along is the word
[44:38] of God we must hold to that regardless
[44:41] of what other things take place always
[44:43] stay with that word
[44:44] always uh uh check out your motives and
[44:48] objectives if it is according to the
[44:50] word of God if it isn't leave it alone
[44:53] but if it's with the word of God and
[44:54] lines up with the word of God then that
[44:56] you hold to that now God sometimes just
[45:00] like your little group here this morning
[45:02] he lets it not happen just
[45:05] overnight he lets God we're the one that
[45:07] gets in a hurry God's never in a hurry
[45:10] he just says it it's going to be for
[45:13] when he says anything it's got to be
[45:15] it's just going to be he lets it take
[45:18] its time he let the Hebrew children and
[45:22] famous characters of the scripture that
[45:24] was standing on God's word to be true
[45:28] they said our God is able to Deliver Us
[45:29] from this fire furnish
[45:31] nevertheless we won't bow to the image
[45:34] because it's against the word see
[45:35] although if he slays us he'll raise us
[45:38] up again you see but see and they he let
[45:40] them walk right up to the age of this
[45:43] great furnace and drop into it before
[45:46] seemed like he even paid any attention
[45:48] like he wasn't even watching but he's
[45:49] always watching he's always watching for
[45:52] this now God said let there be light and
[45:56] 6,000 years that took this Eden to come
[45:59] into existence and we're taught in the
[46:01] scripture for one day of upon the Earth
[46:04] is is a thousand years with god well
[46:08] Thousand Years upon the Earth is one day
[46:09] with God so it took 6,000 years to make
[46:14] this Earth and to bring it into an Eden
[46:16] but you see it was God the Great Master
[46:18] of all intelligence and he he had in his
[46:23] mind what he wanted to do just like when
[46:25] the man that built this trailer when the
[46:27] man that uh when your brethren here that
[46:30] designed this park how you'd make it it
[46:32] was in your mind you kept working that
[46:34] Vision out that's way God did about the
[46:36] world he worked is in his mind and if
[46:38] you notice it come like by Evolution
[46:41] like he was learning more all the time
[46:43] making something greater and greater but
[46:46] see he was above it all and just let it
[46:48] evolute up to that to see everything he
[46:51] be to bring up on the Earth from botney
[46:53] life and fish and so forth that come on
[46:55] into Birds and animals then something in
[46:57] his own image a man and stopped there
[46:59] because it was up to his Perfection of
[47:01] what he wanted that's why you start like
[47:04] this trailer you might lay the frame
[47:06] down and you say what are you doing like
[47:09] you when you all move the first rocks
[47:10] away from this corner here what are you
[47:12] doing see it look like it be like it is
[47:14] now it looks like a little eeden because
[47:16] it was in your mind what to do you just
[47:18] kept working up now we want to be
[47:20] transformed ourselves by the renewing of
[47:22] our mind see not what we have on this
[47:25] Earth what we are going to look for on
[47:27] this Earth but what we are coming to in
[47:30] the world that is to come transformed by
[47:32] renewing of our mind now 6,000 years uh
[47:37] God taken to make this and we see in
[47:39] Genesis 1 now we see that in this God
[47:43] had a had a objective that he wanted to
[47:45] bring to pass and um so many people in
[47:49] teaching on Genesis back here in the
[47:52] first chapter and the second chapter and
[47:54] third chapter especially
[47:56] it looks like a god repeats himself or
[47:58] he says he went ahead and said all these
[48:00] things that he did oh let there be light
[48:03] let there be this and let there come
[48:05] forth and there wasn't even one thing
[48:08] yet wasn't nothing wasn't the light that
[48:11] that old world was still floating out
[48:12] there in that Darkness covered with
[48:14] water but see he had spoke his word and
[48:17] then that's when he was speaking now we
[48:20] notice here in Genesis 1 uh he said and
[48:23] he formed man in his own image and his
[48:25] own likeness in the image of God made he
[48:28] he made him male and female see he was
[48:31] making man he just spoke the word then
[48:33] we find out after his many days of that
[48:37] pass maybe hundreds and hundreds of
[48:39] years there was still no man to tell the
[48:41] sorrow nobody to K the sorrow so then
[48:44] God formed Man Out of the Dust of the
[48:46] earth see he had spoke the word and then
[48:49] the word had to take place now we he
[48:52] said let there be light maybe it might
[48:54] have been hundreds of years maybe 800
[48:56] years before there ever was a light but
[48:57] it come to pass because God said so and
[49:00] God's going to have a church I don't
[49:02] care how many Dark Ages we go through
[49:04] and whatever more he's going to have a
[49:05] church without spot or ankle whether
[49:07] we're part of it or not because he's
[49:09] already said it was going to happen it's
[49:11] going to be there
[49:13] and and he commanded to to transform it
[49:18] into the plant life and all every life
[49:20] that he put forth he said these words
[49:22] like let there be a palm tree let there
[49:26] be an oak tree let there be a fur look
[49:29] down the desert where we live down here
[49:31] in Tucson out on there there's Cactus
[49:34] jumping cactus all kinds of cactuses
[49:36] just 30 minutes in there there Sherman
[49:39] Pine up on top of the mountain now this
[49:43] Cactus will not grow up there and
[49:45] neither will that Sherman Pine grow down
[49:47] here now where was the intelligence that
[49:50] planted the seed they had to come from
[49:52] somewhere it was God's word let there be
[49:56] and it
[49:57] was now we find out all this actually
[50:00] had made it transforming it into the its
[50:03] kindness life and is all put in by the
[50:06] word of God the Creator it all we find
[50:09] out this all headed up in a headquarters
[50:12] called The Garden of Eden and God put
[50:15] his son and his son's bride over it all
[50:20] this great creation see had a reason for
[50:22] it he made everything so pretty he made
[50:24] the flowers and the
[50:25] life and the birds and there's no death
[50:27] no sin no sorrow no sickness and then
[50:30] and all this great thing headed up into
[50:32] one big headquarters which was the
[50:35] Garden of Eden and there he put his son
[50:37] Adam and Adam's bride wife now you might
[50:41] say it was his wife potentially it was
[50:44] his wife but he had never never really
[50:46] been his wife yet like in the scripture
[50:48] we find out where he said Joseph thou
[50:50] son of David fear not to take un thee
[50:53] marry thy wife for that which is
[50:54] conceived in her is all the Holy Ghost
[50:56] see now it was his wife when he made a
[50:59] promise to marry her or to have her but
[51:01] yet it wasn't his wife yet because he
[51:03] had never knew her as a wife so that's
[51:05] the way it was here reason I said God's
[51:07] son and his bride Adam had never knew
[51:10] his wife as a wife but yet it was his
[51:12] wife potentially just like the church
[51:14] now and Christ now then all could rest
[51:18] because all of God's good word seeds
[51:21] that he had spoke had brought forth of
[51:22] its kind that Earth come over there was
[51:25] light there was sunshine when he let the
[51:27] sunshine now why did he make the
[51:28] sunshine he had in his mind see that if
[51:31] the sun don't shine the flower won't
[51:33] grow that is speaking to existence he
[51:34] makes everything to meet its purpose
[51:37] whatever it is like a tree it Bears a
[51:40] certain Acron or it Bears the apple he
[51:42] makes the fruit of the garden and so
[51:44] forth it's all for his purpose and
[51:46] everything had come to pass and he had
[51:48] spoken now the only thing he had to do
[51:50] after spoken it he speaking it rather he
[51:52] could go to rest because he had spok
[51:55] spoken and it was all has to come to
[51:59] pass because he had spoken I don't know
[52:02] how much you had to go through before it
[52:03] come to pass how many Rejects and
[52:06] whatever more but it had to come to pass
[52:08] because he said it would come to pass he
[52:10] had spoken the same thing it is about
[52:13] having a church here in the last days
[52:15] he's going to have a bride he's able to
[52:18] these stones to rise children to Abraham
[52:20] if we don't follow him he'll get
[52:21] somebody else that will follow him see
[52:23] he's going to have it because he's
[52:24] already spoken whatever he says it has
[52:27] to be that way it cannot change it must
[52:29] come forth that way because he said it
[52:32] would and all this great thing that he
[52:35] know would come to pass after he he had
[52:37] spoke it he could take a rest everything
[52:39] under control his seed was his word and
[52:42] his word is a seed Jesus said it was and
[52:44] everything would be all right because he
[52:46] had set forth to bring forth of his kind
[52:48] transforming only to its
[52:51] kind the his word had to be of its kind
[52:55] if he said a palm tree he didn't mean a
[52:57] palm and Oak mixed together he meant a
[52:59] palm tree here and an oak tree here
[53:02] everything positionally in its place oh
[53:05] if we could only learn that at what part
[53:08] of the word we are we must take our
[53:10] place no matter what is think of a
[53:12] little sister here in the wheelchair
[53:14] sometime how many faithful prayers has
[53:16] been made then we don't understand so we
[53:18] committed to God and with she's a flower
[53:22] here among you with her pleasantness and
[53:24] everything see that we can get up and go
[53:26] around how she would long to do that but
[53:27] yes she's Pleasant just the way she said
[53:29] so I always get inspired to watch the
[53:31] little lady see because she we all
[53:34] believe in healing we've seen God do
[53:36] Miracles far beyond that see and she
[53:38] knows that too but she willing to take
[53:41] her place see whatever it is that's what
[53:43] we want I believe it's David said I'd
[53:45] rather be a doormat at the house of the
[53:46] Lord than to dwell in tents with the
[53:48] wicked you see no matter what it is take
[53:50] my place sometimes you have to separate
[53:52] from everything is dear on Earth you to
[53:54] take your POS position that God has
[53:56] called you to I'm sure you can read
[53:57] between the lines what I'm saying see
[53:59] sometimes a very darest personal ear you
[54:01] have to shake hands with it to take your
[54:02] position in Christ to where God has
[54:04] called you see but what's God doing
[54:07] transforming you from what you was maybe
[54:10] a daughter son or whatever it is from a
[54:13] lovely family sometimes he places you
[54:15] somewhere else because it's his way of
[54:18] doing it see by the renewing of your
[54:20] mind to obey the word of God regardless
[54:23] of what the price is these things don't
[54:25] come it didn't call our Redemption
[54:28] wasn't a cheap thing it was the son of
[54:30] God had to die for us see it isn't
[54:32] things of value come of great pricee to
[54:35] bring this
[54:36] message it wasn't
[54:38] easy no it isn't I had forsake
[54:41] everything was dear to me even my own
[54:43] people everybody but you see the value
[54:46] of it is you see is to do the will of
[54:48] God and to do that which knowing there's
[54:51] something in me when they used to say
[54:53] well this go to put me away you thought
[54:54] I lost my mind baptizing in the name of
[54:57] Jesus Christ contrary to the church and
[55:00] all these things that said he crazy but
[55:02] you see no matter what they said there's
[55:04] something has to be done and God just
[55:06] takes a person sticks him in his hands
[55:08] and say do this and you do it how a
[55:10] price it might have been St Paul taught
[55:13] under Gia the greatest teacher of the
[55:14] day and to come down in the very thing
[55:16] that he considered heresy the things
[55:19] that he thought that was the worst
[55:21] things that could have happened to the
[55:22] church he comes right around and becomes
[55:25] a partaker of it a strange thing and how
[55:28] God works in wondrous ways and strange
[55:31] odd ways his wonders to perform when God
[55:34] had spoke it he know his word was a seed
[55:36] and it could it would bring forth of its
[55:38] kind that was commanded to bring forth
[55:41] only of its kind and it'll always do
[55:44] that if man don't tamper with it and so
[55:47] would God's church and everything else
[55:49] bring forth of the kind like it was at
[55:51] the first if theologians didn't tamper
[55:53] with that word trying to put it
[55:55] somewhere else or something else God has
[55:57] spoke it and no matter how much they can
[55:59] they try to contaminate and tampered and
[56:01] so forth it's going to bring forth of
[56:04] its kind there's just nothing to stop it
[56:06] I hope I don't sound like I'm yelling at
[56:07] you is that too loud see now we find
[56:11] everything in order God spoken he said
[56:13] let there be let there be and let there
[56:15] be a Eden let there be beautiful flowers
[56:17] let there be my son in my own image
[56:20] stand over there in the Garden of Eden
[56:22] and let his bride stand by his side oh
[56:25] how beautiful what that was and the
[56:27] father he was a father you see so there
[56:29] come his own children coming forth and
[56:31] he made a paradise for them God loves to
[56:35] do things for his children don't you
[56:36] remember how you mothers and how no
[56:38] matter how you had to lounce the table
[56:40] if Junior need a good pair of shoes that
[56:42] he liked you do it see whatever it was
[56:44] to do something for your children Dad
[56:46] how you'd work a little harder to get
[56:48] something for the children see well that
[56:50] just shows that we're way down here a
[56:52] parent he's the extreme parent see how
[56:56] much more no wonder the Apostle said eye
[56:58] is not seen or ear is not heard it has
[57:00] the enter the heart of man what God has
[57:02] for them in story that love him we just
[57:04] can't conceive in our mind we our mind
[57:07] isn't eligible of thinking the right
[57:10] right direction what God has for store
[57:12] in us that love him see we I can imagine
[57:15] what it would be I can think what it
[57:17] would be but I my mind's not not not
[57:20] capable of thinking how great it is it's
[57:23] beyond that could you imagine what
[57:25] heaven to be when we all be there and
[57:26] young and no sin and no oh what a
[57:29] beautiful place but see it's beyond that
[57:30] see we can't even enter the heart of man
[57:33] what God has for them in store he spoke
[57:35] it and it's going to be sold now after
[57:38] all this beautiful layout that he had
[57:41] there of his I don't mean to sit in that
[57:43] word layout but kind of uh like the uh
[57:48] don't the mother before the coming child
[57:51] don't they call that L they get the all
[57:55] the little uh booties and everything
[57:57] ready you know just for the arriving of
[58:00] this uh a little uh portion of love that
[58:03] God has sent him getting there that's
[58:04] what God did for Adam and Eve he created
[58:07] this Garden of Eden he spoke it it was
[58:10] in his mind and when he says it then it
[58:12] has to happen bear that on mind now what
[58:14] he says it must happen see he can't
[58:17] nothing can can hinder it nothing can
[58:19] keep it from happening there's nothing
[58:21] can keep it from happening God said so
[58:24] and settles it God said it it's going to
[58:27] happen I had all this in mind he said
[58:29] let there be that's Genesis 1 you see
[58:32] Let There be this let there be that let
[58:33] there be he's sewing seed let it be
[58:35] there let it be here let it be here and
[58:38] he knew it was going to be that way
[58:40] because he cannot
[58:42] change now that gives us Faith then and
[58:45] what he said here it's going to
[58:48] be so let's let that seed fall into our
[58:52] hearts and we might be the beding
[58:54] grounds of that see into our hearts and
[58:57] let us act out this place that he's
[58:59] placed Us in in the last days let the
[59:02] seed fall in our hearts Lord let Thy
[59:05] word fall in my heart let there not be
[59:07] any unbelief like Abraham when he's an
[59:09] old man look like impossible how did he
[59:12] go to do that how does he go to be this
[59:13] way he never considered that he just
[59:16] received the word of God and went on
[59:18] believing it and God brought it to pass
[59:20] now uh God had said all these things so
[59:22] he knew it would be and it did he
[59:24] brought for of its kind now that he had
[59:27] transformed then all the seed into the
[59:30] living creature and creation that it was
[59:34] supposed to be it came up just as he
[59:37] said it would or he said Let It Be maybe
[59:39] hundreds and hundreds of years past but
[59:41] here we find it a beautiful Eden and the
[59:45] big birds of flying now Birds didn't
[59:47] have to die and the wolf and the lamb
[59:50] were feeding together and a lion a
[59:52] leopard and oxk and there's no no
[59:54] killing no death no sorrow and there was
[59:58] Adam and Eve Walking In the Garden of
[1:00:01] Eden every seed bringing for it never
[1:00:03] could do nothing else it never could do
[1:00:06] nothing else because God said let it be
[1:00:07] that way it had to be that way oh how
[1:00:11] I'd like to stop here just a minute to
[1:00:12] say see there's where we're facing yet
[1:00:14] the completion of that word now God said
[1:00:17] let there be and here it come up first
[1:00:19] perfectly just exactly now this tree can
[1:00:22] only bring forth that tree this tree can
[1:00:25] only bring forth this tree and Adam a
[1:00:28] Son of God can only bring forth a Son of
[1:00:30] God see you know what I mean it's
[1:00:34] everything after its kind so God could
[1:00:36] say well I'll just rest now did you
[1:00:39] notice it was very few words that God
[1:00:41] ever spoke actually from that time on he
[1:00:44] committed After the Fall To His prophets
[1:00:47] and they bring forth the word I see God
[1:00:49] rested he didn't have no more to do they
[1:00:51] just go to his headquarters knock on the
[1:00:52] door and say father what is it he sends
[1:00:54] it word down by he has a system and the
[1:00:57] way of doing those things let it be just
[1:00:59] and that's the way it was everything of
[1:01:01] his seed bringing forth of his kind now
[1:01:03] when everything looks so pretty and
[1:01:05] everything coming to pass just the what
[1:01:07] God had said now here comes that slimy
[1:01:11] dirty
[1:01:13] deceiver now that's what I'm trying to
[1:01:15] warn you all here about when you see God
[1:01:18] seed begin to take hold to grow watch
[1:01:20] out for that fellow coming in is as
[1:01:22] slick as he can be quote scripture just
[1:01:24] who wouldn't have it see watch him cuz
[1:01:27] he is a deceiver I'm going to call it
[1:01:29] instead of a a conformer being conformed
[1:01:32] he's a deformer deforming the things
[1:01:35] that's been conformed he's a deformer
[1:01:39] and he a deformer or a perverter or a
[1:01:42] corruptor of the original seed and the
[1:01:45] original program I see here like in your
[1:01:48] group here this morning you got a
[1:01:49] program you got a A Vision uh watch for
[1:01:52] that corruptor oh he'll be slly slick as
[1:01:56] he can be see but keep your vision keep
[1:01:58] holding to that now also we find out
[1:02:02] that when he come in he deformed that
[1:02:05] seed and he corrupted that seed by
[1:02:08] getting into the bedding grounds which
[1:02:10] is Eve and corrupting that seed with a
[1:02:14] corruptible seed before it could get
[1:02:15] there to corrupt that beautiful Garden
[1:02:19] of Eden where where Heaven only thing
[1:02:23] that that is is just
[1:02:24] the restoration where we are now we're
[1:02:27] on our road back to that original
[1:02:29] beginning of the creation of God back to
[1:02:33] the Garden of Eden again husband and
[1:02:35] wife without without any any sin or
[1:02:39] anything to live eternally but the the
[1:02:43] TR the not now he wants us to transform
[1:02:46] our minds by the renewing of transform
[1:02:49] be transformed by the renewing of our W
[1:02:52] Minds now Satan comes in and puts in a
[1:02:55] deforming to the word making it say
[1:02:58] something that it isn't that's what he
[1:02:59] did in the beginning and now notice this
[1:03:02] going to sound awful strange this
[1:03:04] morning to to people if I don't wait and
[1:03:07] base too much thought here before I get
[1:03:09] to my regular thought that I wanted to
[1:03:11] to get to you is this that the deformer
[1:03:15] came in and as God had tooked 6,000
[1:03:20] years with the original word to bring
[1:03:22] forth every word of its kind and
[1:03:24] everything that he made would be God's
[1:03:26] Own word bringing forth of his kind now
[1:03:28] the deformer has took 6,000 years and to
[1:03:33] deform that word of God and what has he
[1:03:37] done he's brought himself to a new type
[1:03:40] of Eden Satan's Eden that's where we're
[1:03:44] living today how did he do that how
[1:03:47] could it happen the Striking part is how
[1:03:51] he did it that's where we have to what
[1:03:53] I'm here for to lay this down before you
[1:03:55] so that you can study of it now with the
[1:03:57] brothers here and so forth in the weeks
[1:03:59] to come that you can see how Satan did
[1:04:01] this and watch how cunning he is how Sly
[1:04:04] he is now he deformed these seeds now he
[1:04:09] could not destroy him he just deformed
[1:04:11] him now we realize that sin is
[1:04:14] righteousness perverted it says a a lie
[1:04:18] is a truth misrepresented see anything
[1:04:22] an adultery is a right act that God
[1:04:24] ordained just tuck in the wrong way see
[1:04:27] anything and death is a perversion of
[1:04:30] Life Death just takes see deforms life
[1:04:35] now he had 6,000 years to do it with his
[1:04:38] poison spray and how did he do it now
[1:04:41] this is the Striking part listen close
[1:04:44] now he did it by
[1:04:48] civilization that sounds strange but
[1:04:50] that's why I'm going to make a statement
[1:04:52] here that'll keep you guessing maybe for
[1:04:54] a few minutes I hope not but did you
[1:04:56] realize this I'm not trying to support
[1:04:58] ignorance but did you know that
[1:05:00] Civilization Science Education and the
[1:05:04] things that we cherish so great today is
[1:05:07] the very instrument of
[1:05:10] Satan even civilization civilization
[1:05:14] never come by God civilization come by
[1:05:17] Satan I'll prove that to you by the word
[1:05:20] just civilization is not of God for let
[1:05:23] me show you in this civilization the
[1:05:26] more civilized we get as we work through
[1:05:28] science we are always killing ourselves
[1:05:30] see and this civilization is built up to
[1:05:33] his Pinnacle now and we got death in
[1:05:35] this civilization we got sin in this
[1:05:37] civilization we got sickness in this
[1:05:39] civilization that can't be of God so God
[1:05:43] in the his great own great uh Kingdom it
[1:05:46] is to come we'll have a civilization but
[1:05:48] it will not be anything like this it
[1:05:50] won't be by science it'll be a faith
[1:05:53] civilization ation by the word see this
[1:05:57] scientific civilization we have is
[1:05:59] exactly Satan's trap and that's what
[1:06:00] he's killed the people with that's what
[1:06:02] he's killing us every day with that's
[1:06:04] how as we eat each day instead of living
[1:06:07] we die they have so perverted everything
[1:06:10] to even take so much of this and mix it
[1:06:13] with this and hybrid this and that that
[1:06:15] till it's a dying it's a dying race
[1:06:17] there no matter what you try to do you
[1:06:19] die you seen that picture last night of
[1:06:20] those Africans you know why they never
[1:06:22] had penicillin them people live longer
[1:06:25] than we do they don't even know they
[1:06:27] germs don't bother them see why German
[1:06:30] threw up his hand and surrender at see
[1:06:32] because he see he don't they don't why
[1:06:35] they haven't all been see we'll take
[1:06:37] science to figure out like a pen of
[1:06:39] cylinder something the place in us to to
[1:06:41] take this disease out and it tears down
[1:06:43] something else and makes a bedding
[1:06:44] ground for something
[1:06:45] else now he don't do that see now any
[1:06:49] many of you people come from farms
[1:06:51] anyone knows that a good healthy plant
[1:06:53] never needs to be
[1:06:55] sprayed it's it's got a repellent on it
[1:06:57] itself of life and a germ won't even get
[1:07:00] on it on a real on a real healthy plant
[1:07:03] it's this hot bed
[1:07:05] plant it's this hybrid plant you have to
[1:07:09] baby for instance some of you fellows
[1:07:11] here are westerners here look back to
[1:07:13] the time of the old Longhorn cow today
[1:07:15] you say you got a better beef with your
[1:07:17] with your her have you you haven't that
[1:07:20] old long hard cow not taken up for the
[1:07:21] old girl but she could she' win her here
[1:07:24] like a deer oh she was skinny and
[1:07:26] everything but she was Twi this Herford
[1:07:28] you pull a hay on him take his picture
[1:07:30] up to his tummy early to show his beef
[1:07:32] to the hawk and what is it you turn him
[1:07:34] loose out there he'd die he couldn't win
[1:07:36] it if he had to you have to feed him and
[1:07:38] everything else to take care of his baby
[1:07:40] him around he's a
[1:07:42] hybrid but a real Janu wine old Longhorn
[1:07:45] is turn him
[1:07:47] loose that's the way today with our
[1:07:49] Christians we got some many we have to
[1:07:50] soft soap to beg them put them make them
[1:07:53] a Deon in the church Pat him on the
[1:07:55] shoulder make him some great position in
[1:07:56] the church or if you don't he he won't
[1:07:59] he won't come in if you don't let this
[1:08:00] one do this and this one do that it's
[1:08:02] babying could you imagine genuine
[1:08:04] Christians being that they were rugged
[1:08:06] they were Burly could you imagine St
[1:08:08] Paul being that type of a Christian
[1:08:10] could you imagine St Peter being if you
[1:08:12] don't make me gentle overseer I don't
[1:08:14] know I might go join so and so they were
[1:08:16] rugged Man they were a man of Faith they
[1:08:19] live with God they walked with
[1:08:22] God as a man of few words they serve God
[1:08:26] day and night constantly you didn't have
[1:08:28] to spray them and baby them and offer
[1:08:30] them this that or the other they were
[1:08:32] man rugged they were genuine seeds not
[1:08:35] high breed in denominations a few of the
[1:08:38] methodists don't treat me right I with
[1:08:39] the Baptist the Baptist don't treat me
[1:08:41] right I go to the Pentecostals they
[1:08:43] don't treat me right I'll go back to the
[1:08:45] Catholics or whatever more see they it's
[1:08:47] a hybrid have to keep them sprayed yes
[1:08:49] doctor Reverend brother so and so that
[1:08:53] ain't Christian Christianity
[1:08:54] Christianity act ask no titles it asks
[1:08:57] no favors it only knows God it's
[1:09:00] Original Seed it loves God loves one
[1:09:03] another there's no spraying on them and
[1:09:06] babing them and patting them around and
[1:09:07] saying yes well this sister well I
[1:09:09] believe it's all right for her to have
[1:09:10] short hair this and not and and uh
[1:09:13] there's no such stuff as that let him
[1:09:15] get by with this it's it's rugged it's a
[1:09:17] gospel lay it out there let it fall
[1:09:19] where it will Christians love it must I
[1:09:23] be carried home to heaven on a flower
[1:09:25] bed of ease While others fought to win
[1:09:27] the prize and sail through bloody Seas
[1:09:30] must I be patted on the back and this
[1:09:32] that and the other and baby I expect my
[1:09:34] place out you with the rugged I expect
[1:09:37] not come up there with no trophy scars
[1:09:39] at all I must fight if I must reain
[1:09:42] increase my courage Lord see let me
[1:09:44] stand like a Christian not to be a a
[1:09:47] hybrid plan had to be baby and petted
[1:09:49] and brought into something you're not
[1:09:51] brought in the Christian you're borned
[1:09:53] in it you become a new creature you're a
[1:09:55] seed of God that comes into the earth
[1:09:57] now now we find out that he sprayed this
[1:10:01] poison uh spray and that spray was a
[1:10:05] spray of modern understanding
[1:10:09] education science and civilization the
[1:10:12] very things that we cherish so much did
[1:10:15] you ever stop to think that our great
[1:10:17] enemy in the Natural Life Today among
[1:10:19] the Nations is communism what is a god
[1:10:22] of communism civilization and
[1:10:25] education
[1:10:27] sence that's right isn't it that's what
[1:10:30] they live on and thrive on is science
[1:10:34] scientific science is a god of science
[1:10:37] now if you just and with the POR and
[1:10:39] spray of this modern civilization
[1:10:41] science and education now let me prove
[1:10:43] to you that education and civilization
[1:10:48] come from the devil now let us turn back
[1:10:51] here just if you want you to Genesis 4th
[1:10:52] chapter all right now let's begin with
[1:10:55] the 16th verse of Genesis 44 here or
[1:10:59] Genesis um 4 Pardon Me Now
[1:11:02] notice Satan you people follow these
[1:11:06] tapes with our our brother here now
[1:11:10] you've heard me preach on the Serpent's
[1:11:12] Seed and that cannot be denied that was
[1:11:15] opened up in one of those Seven Seals it
[1:11:17] was hid now if children has come up
[1:11:19] under that kind see under that kind of
[1:11:22] teaching that's what their parents was
[1:11:24] they have the nature of the parents
[1:11:25] their denominations so forth they have
[1:11:27] to believe that they believe that
[1:11:29] because they're born of that parent but
[1:11:32] today we're not born under that parent
[1:11:33] our parent is a word and a word but say
[1:11:36] I was born under God too for that age
[1:11:38] but this is a climax age this is the age
[1:11:41] Beyond those denominations there had to
[1:11:44] come forth must come forth God ordained
[1:11:47] it so that there must come forth them
[1:11:49] Seven Seals must be open it was supposed
[1:11:52] to be done in this lady of CNA
[1:11:54] and I think Beyond any Shadow of Doubt
[1:11:55] not as we brag we have no brag only on
[1:11:58] Jesus Christ none of us we only brag on
[1:12:01] Jesus Christ but we are thankful with
[1:12:03] the for the privilege of knowing but any
[1:12:06] Beyond any Shadow of Doubt God has chos
[1:12:09] Us in this last days and has proven it
[1:12:11] by the signs in the heavens and in the
[1:12:13] earth and every one of them coming right
[1:12:15] straight back to the word to prove that
[1:12:16] it's so this age that we live in the
[1:12:19] message and how it is we're not a cult
[1:12:21] we're not a bunch of fanatics we are
[1:12:24] Servants of God that's been called by
[1:12:26] the Holy
[1:12:27] Ghost you'll have all kinds of names
[1:12:29] taged to you but that don't mean it so
[1:12:31] now remember Satan son was Cain I think
[1:12:36] you all been through all the tapes which
[1:12:38] I see your libraries out your now
[1:12:40] remember that Eve become pregnant by
[1:12:44] Satan and in the same day we got a case
[1:12:47] of at Tucson now that a woman if she
[1:12:50] becomes uh she lives with two men she
[1:12:53] can have have two different type of
[1:12:54] children we know that I know it in
[1:12:56] breeding dogs and things and so forth if
[1:12:58] it's right away so Satan that morning
[1:13:02] perhaps met this evil one which was the
[1:13:05] serpent not a reptile but a beast most
[1:13:08] subtle cunning smart of all of the Beast
[1:13:11] just under man and man is Beast himself
[1:13:13] and we're we're a mammal warm blooded
[1:13:15] animal and and Satan was the next link
[1:13:18] here this um serpent was the next thing
[1:13:21] to a man from a Jane stand between
[1:13:24] and and a japany now science is looking
[1:13:27] for that Missing Link and it's so hid by
[1:13:30] taking him down and even not a bll in
[1:13:32] him looks like a man see making him a
[1:13:34] reptile now we find now that this fell
[1:13:37] found Eve in the Garden of Eden this
[1:13:40] young woman that know no sin know not
[1:13:43] what her nakedness was and he knew he
[1:13:46] smart subtle wife and he told her that
[1:13:49] the seed but the the the fruit was
[1:13:51] pleasant and it was Desir
[1:13:53] and when he lived with her that morning
[1:13:55] then see then the afternoon she
[1:13:57] persuaded Adam to do the same thing
[1:13:59] telling him what it was and then Adam
[1:14:03] deliberately knowing he ought not have
[1:14:04] done it walked out with his wife and did
[1:14:07] this act which finally he would have
[1:14:08] come to it anyhow but see it had to be
[1:14:10] that way the wisdom of God because this
[1:14:12] then that displays his attribute to be a
[1:14:15] savior father healer you've heard me
[1:14:17] preach on that seat now if that hadn't
[1:14:19] been done he just let him out there on
[1:14:21] free moral agency to let him act he
[1:14:23] couldn't make them do it and then still
[1:14:24] be just but he could put them equal with
[1:14:26] him in free moral agency and then let
[1:14:28] them do it themselves and he knew they
[1:14:30] would do it and so then you see then
[1:14:33] when Adam Liv with she brought forth
[1:14:35] Twins and one of them was of Satan and
[1:14:38] one of them was of Adam which was of God
[1:14:41] Cain and Abel and that happens we got a
[1:14:44] case to on now that that a white woman
[1:14:47] lived with her husband one morning and
[1:14:49] that afternoon she lived with a negro
[1:14:52] and one of the the little boys the two
[1:14:54] little boys is born one of them is a
[1:14:56] little kinky headed negro and the other
[1:14:58] one is a a blond-headed kid real pretty
[1:15:01] and the the thing now she's trying to
[1:15:04] make the white father take care of both
[1:15:06] children and he said I'll take care of
[1:15:07] my own but not his that the Negro man
[1:15:10] take care of his own child so see it's
[1:15:12] true there's always twins that's the
[1:15:15] reason don't forget this little flock
[1:15:18] the church in the last days is going to
[1:15:20] be
[1:15:21] twins so close deceive the elected
[1:15:24] Matthew 24:24 see the church is going
[1:15:27] it's a Pentecostal move it's so much
[1:15:30] like the real thing till it would
[1:15:32] deceive the very elected if it was
[1:15:34] possible a little later on if I get the
[1:15:36] chance I want to explain what how that
[1:15:37] election comes see it go to deceive them
[1:15:40] because it's almost like the same thing
[1:15:43] see just two fathers that's all same
[1:15:45] mother same church same movement same
[1:15:48] thing the betting ground is the same for
[1:15:50] the word Falls but one of them like here
[1:15:53] is
[1:15:54] perverted you understand say Amen if you
[1:15:57] do see one of them is a perversion
[1:15:59] because it's a wrong Father which I will
[1:16:02] prove someday if God will let me that
[1:16:04] denomination is the mark of the beast
[1:16:06] see it's a wrong father it's stirring
[1:16:08] people to an organization instead of to
[1:16:10] the word see it's a wrong F it's a cane
[1:16:13] move when I go home this time I'm
[1:16:15] preaching on the subject the trail of
[1:16:17] the serpent the beast at the beginning
[1:16:19] and the Beast at the end and Trail him
[1:16:21] right through the Bible and show how he
[1:16:22] heads up then and you all get that on
[1:16:24] the telephone to see if the Lord permits
[1:16:26] us to do it and now just watch how
[1:16:27] cunning that fell is how he's just
[1:16:30] exactly just what they're just like
[1:16:32] Judas and Jesus there both brothers in
[1:16:34] the tribe just like Esau and Jacob and
[1:16:36] and like the The Crow and the dove
[1:16:38] sitting on the same root and everything
[1:16:40] is a twin and uh and this uh great uh
[1:16:43] Warfare that we're in the enemy uses
[1:16:46] deception like he did to Eve oh God has
[1:16:49] said surely but but surely see see
[1:16:52] trying to reason it Beyond what God Said
[1:16:53] originally Thou shalt die he said yes
[1:16:56] God said that but surely see that's
[1:16:58] spray over but what God says God keeps
[1:17:02] he don't need any help from Satan he
[1:17:04] keeps it so don't ever be deceived by
[1:17:07] that now we notice then that it brought
[1:17:11] forth of its kind now in Genesis here we
[1:17:13] find out after the spring of this poison
[1:17:16] of knowledge now science is knowledge
[1:17:20] and all we hear is science signs signs
[1:17:24] signs great subject in school signs
[1:17:27] today a better automobile a better this
[1:17:29] a better home a better house a better
[1:17:30] this a better that what are we doing
[1:17:32] dying all the time create automobile we
[1:17:34] quit walking quit walking we return to
[1:17:37] blubber well we don't have man anymore
[1:17:39] we have
[1:17:40] jellyfish that's right and the woman all
[1:17:43] she does throw the clothes in it press
[1:17:46] the button there it is when your man you
[1:17:48] used to walk through the spring and pack
[1:17:49] water and chop wood and Bor over a k
[1:17:51] somewhere and fix your clothes like that
[1:17:53] and we're so soft if it do to kill us
[1:17:56] but we can't help it this is the age
[1:17:58] we're living in even science says now
[1:18:00] that little girls are coming into
[1:18:02] menopause young women between 20 and 25
[1:18:05] years old I meet them right in the line
[1:18:07] that young man go through the middle age
[1:18:09] between 20 and 25 years old my mother my
[1:18:12] wife went through about 35 to 40 my
[1:18:15] mother went through from 45 to 50 see
[1:18:18] how the degenerating in this last days
[1:18:20] because why we're working more on S
[1:18:24] 150 years ago the only travel man had
[1:18:26] was by horse or by
[1:18:30] foot and now he goes by jet almost by
[1:18:34] thought see science has done it and
[1:18:36] that's of the devil now you say that
[1:18:38] right brother Brandon yes sir let's take
[1:18:41] Genesis now four and camee went out from
[1:18:44] the presence of the Lord now watch the
[1:18:45] first thing he done you tell me when you
[1:18:48] think we got enough here cuz
[1:18:50] IOP stop on this anywhere
[1:18:56] he went out from the presence of the
[1:18:59] Lord there he made his mistake and
[1:19:01] there's where you
[1:19:05] make that's what he did right he went up
[1:19:07] from the presence of the Lord and you
[1:19:10] say well Brother David there's a lot in
[1:19:13] that you know what I mean but the the
[1:19:17] picture that we want to to
[1:19:21] draw is is
[1:19:25] that God he he elected you and he chose
[1:19:32] you is is that what he said yeah and
[1:19:37] that he spoke it so it's got to
[1:19:42] transform into its kind
[1:19:45] right
[1:19:47] and and we then he said that all this
[1:19:51] civilization and and all
[1:19:54] this organizations and and all this
[1:19:58] world system of Science and
[1:20:01] education and and civilization he says
[1:20:04] it's all of the devil to deform us
[1:20:07] that's right in other words we get so
[1:20:11] caught up in it so worried about it
[1:20:15] so frustrated by it that that we get
[1:20:20] frustrated at the very PR
[1:20:23] process of our
[1:20:26] transformation you know that but you've
[1:20:28] you've got to go through that process of
[1:20:32] being
[1:20:33] changed and and he and and he changes Us
[1:20:37] by his word so you can't escape you
[1:20:41] can't escape the process of growing you
[1:20:46] can't escape the process of the
[1:20:51] deformer trying to discourage you and
[1:20:54] and and making life hard on you and and
[1:20:58] and trying to uh uh get the uh uh uh put
[1:21:02] a burden on you and make you carry a
[1:21:05] cross and I thought you know when when I
[1:21:07] lost that sight in my eye and you know
[1:21:11] the first thing you know Satan wanted to
[1:21:13] make it say oh you're being punished for
[1:21:15] your
[1:21:17] sins well you know all the things you
[1:21:19] looked on that you shouldn't have looked
[1:21:21] on you know all these things like you
[1:21:23] know and and and so and and I just
[1:21:27] stopped I says wait a minute the word
[1:21:30] said if I can do one thing for my
[1:21:33] salvation he died in vain my
[1:21:36] righteousness is his filthy rags I'm not
[1:21:39] going to be
[1:21:40] transformed by my works I'm not going to
[1:21:44] be
[1:21:45] transformed by my uh my my
[1:21:51] failures the only thing that's going to
[1:21:53] transform me is because he spoke it and
[1:21:58] if he spoke it it's got to come to pass
[1:22:02] and did you hear the prophet of God said
[1:22:04] oh if we could only see that and put our
[1:22:08] faith in that and not let the trans the
[1:22:13] transformation process discourage
[1:22:17] us and beat us down we
[1:22:21] we it's it's going to happen he's going
[1:22:25] to have a bride he's going to have an
[1:22:27] elected and that's what he wants to do
[1:22:29] is he doesn't want our
[1:22:32] results in there words we don't see our
[1:22:35] results in the civilization around us or
[1:22:40] the world around
[1:22:43] us we we don't see we can't say we can't
[1:22:48] try to measure ourselves our
[1:22:51] Christianity of how it appears in our in
[1:22:55] in our life in our civilization in our
[1:22:59] education so it's it's like trying to
[1:23:01] look on the
[1:23:03] outside to determine what's on the
[1:23:07] inside I'm getting on my Sunday message
[1:23:10] but I can't help
[1:23:12] it you understand we're not measured by
[1:23:16] the world around
[1:23:18] us we're measured by what's in in
[1:23:24] us that's why when he said pray he said
[1:23:27] pray to him who's in you within you so
[1:23:32] okay we don't look
[1:23:35] out we don't look out we look
[1:23:39] in we look into what's in our heart we
[1:23:44] look into what's in what what what's in
[1:23:47] what's our heart's desire to want more
[1:23:50] of God we don't look at out and say oh I
[1:23:54] mean there's there's all this perversion
[1:23:57] in this world and I see it and it bugs
[1:24:00] me and can you can you're going to spend
[1:24:03] your whole day saying oh I'm going to be
[1:24:05] a Christian when none of this world
[1:24:07] bothers
[1:24:10] me you I'm going to be a Christian when
[1:24:13] when you know I'm not drawn after this
[1:24:17] and I'm not drawn after that I'm going
[1:24:19] to be a Christian you can't measure
[1:24:21] Yourself by Al there you can only
[1:24:23] measure Yourself by one thing and that's
[1:24:26] your faith in what he
[1:24:32] said and you could look at yourself and
[1:24:34] you could look yourself in your mirror
[1:24:36] and you could see nothing but a
[1:24:39] failure you can see all kinds of
[1:24:41] discouraging aspects about your life but
[1:24:44] there's one thing you've got to know is
[1:24:47] that he
[1:24:48] said and I believe what he said there
[1:24:52] therefore what he said is going to come
[1:24:54] to pass now I may be in the process of
[1:25:00] transformation of
[1:25:03] change and I might be going through this
[1:25:06] and going through that and going through
[1:25:08] this mind battle and going through that
[1:25:10] mind battle I might be going through
[1:25:12] this physical battle and that physical
[1:25:15] battle I might be going through this
[1:25:17] financial battle and that Financial
[1:25:19] battle everything might be in dis array
[1:25:23] my world my being falling apart my bank
[1:25:26] accounts dwindling I don't don't have
[1:25:28] any job looking for you you want to know
[1:25:31] something that's not a measure of
[1:25:38] nothing the only thing that God measures
[1:25:41] You by is what he spoke of you in the
[1:25:45] beginning because that has got to come
[1:25:49] to
[1:25:50] pass thank you Jesus I like it when he
[1:25:53] said that man said he says I'm not what
[1:25:56] I I want to be and I'm not what I ought
[1:25:59] to be but I'm not what I used to be
[1:26:02] either he was in the process of
[1:26:07] transforming and and so what what
[1:26:10] happens is is we get locked in to trying
[1:26:14] to measure
[1:26:16] ourselves measure our Christianity
[1:26:19] measure oursel by our five senses
[1:26:22] emotionalism is good I like being
[1:26:26] emotional I want you to raise your hands
[1:26:29] I want you to praise God if you want to
[1:26:31] run run shout that that's all wonderful
[1:26:35] but it it let it be what it
[1:26:39] is but you are what you are because he
[1:26:42] said you was what you
[1:26:45] are Hallelujah so he said I'm going to
[1:26:49] have a bride amen well he didn't say one
[1:26:53] day snap she's
[1:26:55] perfect no what's the perfect part about
[1:26:58] it what is the perfect part of
[1:27:04] you the seed word that's in you that's
[1:27:09] right that's the perfect part of you
[1:27:13] what he said is the perfect part of you
[1:27:15] the word is the perfect part of you so
[1:27:18] you here we are living in a whole world
[1:27:21] that totally
[1:27:24] perverted now I'm going to measure
[1:27:27] Myself by a perverted
[1:27:30] World by perverted judgment by perverted
[1:27:35] standards by perverted morality and
[1:27:38] that's what he's trying to that's what
[1:27:40] he's saying the deform we go into keep
[1:27:42] listening the message God's got the
[1:27:45] power to transform you you don't have
[1:27:48] the power to transform you you don't
[1:27:51] have the power power to change he put
[1:27:53] the power in you in seed form and now
[1:27:58] he's going to guide you
[1:28:01] amen by preaching to you by giving you
[1:28:06] Revelation like I said it's wonderful to
[1:28:08] shout but he didn't build his church on
[1:28:11] that right that's right he built his
[1:28:15] church on opening the word of God to you
[1:28:18] not letting you look outside but letting
[1:28:22] you look
[1:28:23] inside
[1:28:27] right I there's something in me that
[1:28:29] amends the word of
[1:28:33] God now that makes me shout that makes
[1:28:37] me happy Revelation his life so he
[1:28:41] didn't build his church he didn't build
[1:28:43] his church he says I'm going to now
[1:28:45] build my church when they can look
[1:28:48] outside and look at their life and see
[1:28:51] works
[1:28:53] and and see this and see that the
[1:28:55] scribes and Pharisees had Greater Works
[1:28:58] than all of
[1:28:59] them the only difference that they had
[1:29:02] is they said Lord where else can we go
[1:29:06] you alone have the words of eternal
[1:29:09] life and then you begin to see just like
[1:29:12] he said in this tape you're not of this
[1:29:16] world you're living in it but you're not
[1:29:19] of it you're called to a complete
[1:29:21] completely different
[1:29:23] existence we can't start measuring
[1:29:26] ourselves by the church
[1:29:28] world we can't measure ourselves by by
[1:29:33] the different moves of the spirit of the
[1:29:36] rain falling on the unjust and and and
[1:29:39] the just right there's only one way that
[1:29:42] you can ever look inside of yourself and
[1:29:46] say is there something in me that amens
[1:29:49] every word of God and if that's there I
[1:29:53] am going to be transformed no matter how
[1:29:56] dark I am no matter how many troubles I
[1:29:59] have no matter how many struggles I have
[1:30:02] no matter how many failures I have that
[1:30:05] word will not
[1:30:10] failu that's what's perfect about
[1:30:13] me what's perfect about me is what that
[1:30:18] he spoke about
[1:30:20] me and he will transform me into that no
[1:30:26] matter what I have to come go
[1:30:30] through cuz he's got the
[1:30:33] power to
[1:30:35] transform and if we could just get our
[1:30:41] eyes off of this
[1:30:45] craziness that's all around
[1:30:49] us and and just just stop letting it
[1:30:53] have an effect on
[1:30:58] you you
[1:31:00] know you can't even comprehend where
[1:31:03] people
[1:31:05] are I don't need
[1:31:08] to it's all of the devil I've got the
[1:31:12] one
[1:31:14] thing I've got the word of
[1:31:16] God I've got the seals opened up I've
[1:31:21] had the son of man Ministry in our day
[1:31:25] we saw the very God of our
[1:31:27] Heaven come down and Veil himself in
[1:31:30] flesh and stand in this generation
[1:31:34] calling out to that bride and they heard
[1:31:37] his
[1:31:38] voice and my sheep have heard my voice
[1:31:41] and another they won't
[1:31:44] follow and and that's what you're
[1:31:46] attracted to that's what you Feast on
[1:31:50] that's what you follow
[1:31:52] it it's the word because you know that
[1:31:55] that word is going to transform you
[1:31:59] because he placed the power of
[1:32:03] transformation within you and and that's
[1:32:07] just such a press in my
[1:32:10] heart for us to learn to quit looking at
[1:32:16] the world around
[1:32:19] us there's no way
[1:32:22] you can judge yourself by the
[1:32:26] world you can't do
[1:32:30] it you're not even of this
[1:32:34] world you you can't even that's what he
[1:32:37] said renew your mind with the washing of
[1:32:40] the word of God okay re don't be
[1:32:43] conformed to this world but be
[1:32:48] transformed and that's what our desire
[1:32:50] is you say well brother M you don't know
[1:32:52] how much how how all the dumb things
[1:32:55] I've
[1:32:57] done don't
[1:33:00] matter don't
[1:33:02] matter dumb don't stop
[1:33:06] God unbelief don't stop God failure
[1:33:10] don't stop
[1:33:11] God because he said
[1:33:15] so he said so before you got here he
[1:33:19] said so he put your name on the Lamb's
[1:33:21] Book of Life life he said I'll be with
[1:33:23] you even in you till the end of the
[1:33:25] world I will not leave you I will not
[1:33:27] forsake you but I will transform you if
[1:33:30] I started a work in you I'll perfect it
[1:33:33] till the
[1:33:34] end all the father hath given me will
[1:33:38] come and when did he start that work he
[1:33:42] started that work in the before there
[1:33:44] ever was a
[1:33:46] star in the sky and and he's trying to
[1:33:50] get us to to quit looking
[1:33:53] around and focus on what is
[1:33:58] spiritually
[1:34:00] transforming right
[1:34:03] now right now within
[1:34:07] us do you have a
[1:34:10] revelation of the transforming power of
[1:34:13] God that's going to transform you from
[1:34:17] whatever you are into what that he said
[1:34:22] you are going to be you say I don't know
[1:34:24] what it is that's the beauty of
[1:34:29] Revelation that's the beauty of
[1:34:31] Revelation something that's not known
[1:34:34] that's previously been hid and now is
[1:34:37] made known to you amen that's your
[1:34:42] life that's what the church is built
[1:34:46] on not the not the
[1:34:49] temporary Judgment of your
[1:34:52] Yourself by this perverted world that we
[1:34:55] live
[1:34:56] in but by
[1:34:59] your re interman
[1:35:02] response to the
[1:35:04] revelation of God's
[1:35:07] word and everyone's different and I
[1:35:10] thought that's why that was so beautiful
[1:35:13] about the girl in the wheelchair he said
[1:35:16] look at this sister everybody's prayed
[1:35:19] for
[1:35:20] her
[1:35:24] everybody's prayed for her she says she
[1:35:26] knows God's A Healer she believes
[1:35:32] that in other words he he was trying to
[1:35:35] say don't don't
[1:35:37] measure oh if she was a Believer or we
[1:35:40] have to have her healed or or or if if
[1:35:43] she doesn't raise up we don't have faith
[1:35:47] and he comes back and she says she's
[1:35:49] just serving her purpose yeah
[1:35:56] see we're we're we're blown
[1:35:59] away with thinking we've got to produce
[1:36:02] something we're blowed away with
[1:36:04] thinking if if I don't have a sign or I
[1:36:07] don't have a wonder if I don't have a
[1:36:09] move of the power you know where the
[1:36:11] move of the power was the move of the
[1:36:14] power is when he said let there
[1:36:17] be and even though it took thousands of
[1:36:21] years years it
[1:36:23] was can he said let there be about
[1:36:27] you can it might take 40 years it may
[1:36:30] take 50 years it might take hours in
[1:36:33] struggling it may take your deathbed but
[1:36:36] let me tell you one thing God's word
[1:36:38] does not return void and that's why we
[1:36:41] played this tape tonight CU I know that
[1:36:44] all those things that he said in there
[1:36:46] will not return void if you cast The
[1:36:49] Bread upon the waters it will bring
[1:36:52] forth
[1:36:53] life and we can have confidence in that
[1:36:57] but what we got to do is we got to shake
[1:37:00] ourselves away from the
[1:37:03] deformer because this world is trying to
[1:37:06] deform our
[1:37:07] thinking and we need to come back to the
[1:37:11] washing of the water of the word and the
[1:37:14] renewing of our mind I am
[1:37:19] elected I am
[1:37:21] chosen I am a part of this bride I am
[1:37:25] not of the world I am not part of this
[1:37:28] bride because I spoke in tongues I am
[1:37:31] not part of the Bride because I laid my
[1:37:33] hands on the sick and they'll do all
[1:37:35] these things we shall do if God
[1:37:40] permits but I'm not going to lay down
[1:37:43] those foundations again but I'm going to
[1:37:45] move on to Perfection can the Perfection
[1:37:49] is that God loved me
[1:37:52] he put my name on The Book of
[1:37:54] Life he will not fail me and he's
[1:37:58] revealed that to me can I'm hanging on
[1:38:01] to that and that'll get me through every
[1:38:03] dark hour that I ever go
[1:38:08] through why cuz he said
[1:38:14] so and I I I I just don't
[1:38:19] care you know Prophet God says Satan
[1:38:22] casted his vote against me God casted
[1:38:26] his vote for me now who am I going to
[1:38:29] believe who are you going to
[1:38:32] believe let me tell you don't believe
[1:38:35] your
[1:38:40] flesh believe the word because the word
[1:38:43] has the power to transform you into an
[1:38:50] overcomer and and so anyway maybe I'll
[1:38:53] come up with a different
[1:38:55] sermon
[1:38:57] Sunday but I I just saw the
[1:39:00] parallel between God's word and this
[1:39:03] world Amen there just two different
[1:39:05] things right we're not even of it so
[1:39:09] don't let our minds be of
[1:39:14] it the carnal mind is emanated with God
