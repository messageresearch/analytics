still Christians amen we still have a lot to be thankful for amen praise God and we have a promise that God said he would meet us in this place tonight you know it would be very exciting to the world if their favorite ball player or the president of the United States if that was their thing would would meet you at meet them at their house or their place where they're going to get something from the this ball player or this president but think us as believers the Lord Jesus has promised to meet us here tonight isn't that wonderful we're certainly grateful we just want to thank you all for

just I want to invite you and I know that all you know we've we've already offered prayer but if there's something in your heart if there's a special something I know that some have pinned a request for prayer but if there's something secret if there's something just bubbling up in your heart and you said God I want to see you move on the scene for this request and you want to put it on the Altar and say God I know that you can speak to this need and that from tonight I can drive a post and say from that night I know that it was you Lord because a man can't do that I can't do that amen let's

we're asking tonight something from you Lord Jesus so we commit the service we commit the request the burdens in our heart Lord we we just pray that you would speak o God and Supply food from the storehouse tonight Lord and when we leave here Lord we can say surely the Lord met us at our place of need and brought spiritual food in due season for we commit ourselves to you in Jesus Christ amen and amen praise the lord well while you're standing I want to invite you to open into the word of God we just have a little thought and we don't anticipate being long and um we just trust that we can deliver what's on our heart and we'll all be blessed remember brother Billy while he's traveling he's ministering away and trust the Lord will be his fortune certainly have been appreciating the studying Nehemiah and Lord really just dealt with my heart in a sovereign way and so it's just special so if you want to turn with me we're just going to go to Hebrews chapter 11. we'll read one and two there and then also Hebrews chapter 12. Hebrews chapter 11. the scripture says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and we know that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word and we also know that it can never be overemphasized the need to call upon God for Revelation and we know Revelation and Faith are one in the same so when we pray we can have a hope that what we've received is from God because it's in his word amen and then also we'll turn in Hebrews chapter 12. verses 1 and 2. amen wherefore seen we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight in the Sin which doeth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us amen and we just want to read one more found in James one more chapter over in chapter 5 of James chapter 5 and verses 11 through 20. behold we count them happy which endureth ye have heard the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord and the Lord is very pitiful and of tender Mercy but Above All Things my brethren swear not neither by Heaven neither by Earth neither by any other oath but let your yea be ye in your Navy nay lest ye fall into condemnation is any mayor is any among you Afflicted let him pray if is any Mary let him sing Psalms if any among you is there any among you let him call upon thee is any sick among you let him call for the Elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he hath committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that he might that it might not Reign and it rained not on the Earth by the space of three years and six months why and he prayed again and the heavens gave rain and the Earth brought forth their fruit Brethren if any of you do error from the truth and one converteth him let him know that he that converteth the sinner from his The Sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sin hey man we're just a little out of blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seed you know I was really um moved on this past weekend as our pastor just went into Nehemiah and you know in his introduction to the service I believe it was Sunday morning he said you know sometimes you you um you can't be helped if you don't realize that you're lacking something and my you know there was just so much depth to the to the messages over the weekend but you know sometimes when when the Lord starts dealing with you on a subject you know every single scripture every single quote and there's just becomes a constant um something is highlighted something just keeps popping out I don't know if it's the same for you but you know I just remember you know when it came time to be re-baptized you know and I saw it in the scripture every time I played a tape or every time I was fellowshipping with somebody then they would say oh you know when I was re-baptizing then you'd be like oh my goodness here it is you know and so you know that the Lord's dealing with you in that particular season amen so that's when I began to realize is you know as as we're looking at um you know the burden that Nehemiah had and now he's he's building this wall and it's lacking unto us where we're at in the season we're building a church and you know I begin to see that you know many times you know we move forward to do something for the Lord and you know we find ourselves kind of lagging behind or failing in something and you know you just kind of wonder what what's wrong here you know the the sufficiency of the word is there but some sometimes it's just not moving the program of God's not moving and so it makes us search back and turn every stone and we begin to see you know what is it Lord what is it and so I began to see that part of what we're dealing with you know personally is sometimes we get to you know I'll say it like this when Brother David said we know when we build the new church you know we're going to have room so get ready there'll be plenty of room to run but don't run without the spirit and boy I tell you that really that really touched my heart you know because really once the Lord moves we want to follow the leading of the Lord and all of what is in here we want we want amen so if it's in the word it's for you amen if it's not in the word we don't want it just leave it alone so I got to thinking about you know you know the little subject that's on my heart is is you know the the prayer of faith you know and a lot of times you know like brother Branham said and I I have some quotes here and I don't know exactly how we'll the Lord how many of them I'll read but just trust that whatever you came for you just pull right out of the message amen and so you know a lot of times you know brother Branham said in in the patma's vision you know he said uh a lot of times you know you know we John when he was caught up he was going to see Christ in the future ages and not just see Christ working in the future ages but to see his Works amen and so but it it really he he had to be caught up in the spirit in the Lord's Day amen and and that's just the thing you know we don't want to run without the spirit amen we don't want to we don't want to sing without the spirit we don't want to pray without the spirit we don't want to even move without the spirit many times we find ourselves moving doing things because it's scriptural but we still haven't waited on the Lord we still haven't moved forward in the spirit of Christ and I begin to see oh God have I made prayer a tradition have I have I prayed the right prayer but failed to get in the spirit many times we know that the the faith that we have is a conquering Faith but many times we just know that it's the truth but yet we fail to get in the spirit the devil don't care your Creeds and your dogmas and even if you have the right Doctrine but if you move forward without the spirit it'll be of not it won't be a pure worship God's wanting worshipers that'll get into the spirit of the message not just the doctrines sometimes we run in headlong to trials and things it's because God's saying maybe you didn't go in the spirit you know we needed healing just like you said in the church age book and he said if if we would see it's a promise in the word of God and know that God can't fail and God's for you and he's already paid the price and you're a Believer this is your inheritance many times he said we just failed to get in the spirit of it man and then I begin to see Lord I see that what you're trying to build in my life in us as a church body is not a bunch of nicolaitanism like the only one that can pray for you is is the song leader or or the pastor or a minister or the teacher or the Deacon or the ones that are workers we don't want to let down our power we don't want to give the devil wants us to just uh uh surrender our weapon he just wants us to say hey that's such and such as obligation you know what I'm going to get him to pray we don't want to lay down our arms we want to be the one that's building part of what God's Building but we got to get into the spirit say this is my part I'm not going to just push it out on them I'm going to go into the storehouse and let God give me spiritual food oh you know it's so important to go back and to feed on you know what what the Lord's leading our pastor in I just thought it was so special sometimes I'll go back and listen and I was like I know I was in the church service but where was I at with that you know many times if we can go back and get into this Spirit say God I know you spoke to me go over your notes look back I believe God wants to meet you at that secret place many times people say well I just want to go over there and pray for them and and lay my hands but you know what there's power in your prayer whether you lay hands or no hands the sexual fervent prayer of the righteous one availeth much you've been entrusted with a sacred virtue God has empowered us it's it's in this invisible Union it's not a public show excuse me you know it's so special to be the called out The Chosen bride um amen you know Brother David said this he said the contents what's being built in the wall it's also what's going to be built in the temple and it struck me you know I don't know what the the exact building materials were in that day but I look at the building materials with building the church and all of the structure and different things but no doubt those walls had some stones in it and we know that he said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and you when he started describing how many how big that wall was you know it's not just one man's Revelation it's every single one of us that have Revelation every single one of us God's dealing with this the youngest to the oldest it doesn't matter we all have a part in the wall because it's it's going to take all of us praying receiving from God it's it's your power against the devil it's your prayer for me it's my prayer for you it's your prayer for those who are outside that still need to come in amen don't let's not let our sword down let's not let our faith down the power of the promise is working in every single body member equally because you're a believer you take God at us at his word you're a Believer it's your inheritance it's your right he purchased it for you don't doubt your weapon don't lay it down those rocks built up and all of those rocks all of those Revelations all of those Believers getting into the spirit that's where things happen that's when the devil starts trembling because now well I think about George Washington you know when he knew that they were given a promise a land of promise they said surely there's got to be a land and they have something to fight for we have something to fight for and you know we're going to have a vision there's there your prayer your faith can really make a difference not just for you you've seen it work for you and a lot of times we can have more faith for somebody else don't lay your weapon down I just think about George Washington you know he could have looked at all of the circumstances but he prayed all night sometimes I can't I realize there's a lot of things that try to just all of a sudden you really want to enter into sort of sacred prayer oh my back itches oh I got to make that phone call like all these voices why is that why is that because prayer is so important we need to get into the spirit you know I was telling my wife oh Monday morning I was like the God is dealing with me so much about prayer I got to cut loose of some things I don't know what I got to do but I gotta tear loose I don't want to have to be stripped I want to let go of some things you know sometimes we get pulled on and then we connect ourselves with things and all of a sudden it takes our affection it takes our attention and all of a sudden when we go to prayer Our channels are all clogged up oh I got this I got that oh I gotta do this I gotta do that forget that I want to lay aside every weight I'm running a race when you're running a race you can't sit there and have a big old long conversation with your buddy or on Instagram or whatever you gotta hey you know what I'm got the destination in mind I'm running I got a pry I got my eyes on a prize amen we don't want to lay down we don't want to let go your position in the body of Christ is so important one star out of place can cause the whole thing to fail it's to create a sobriety God has put a responsibility he's given each and every one of us faith the ability to hear from God you don't know how powerful that is you're just small word of encouragement can change the course of a oh a mother who just lost a child you never know young person you can tell your mom you know I really appreciate that it made such a difference but where do we get that in that secret place he said go to your closet you know sometimes we just need to go into a little fasting of of thankfulness I love that a little fasting and just I'm not gonna get on Instagram today or I'm not gonna hey I'm just gonna take time off of work and make a list of all the things that God's done for me so I can get an attitude of appreciation hey man I think we just need to get a right attitude where we can get into prayer and say God I'm nothing why who am I what am I anyway without you let me enter into prayer God what do you want me to do so many times I get clogged up because it's what I got to do what's my next task oh my we can ever break out of our own spirit say you know I got a lot of questions but forget the questions I want God to speak to me I want to get into a spirit where he can speak to me amen my praise God pray for me something's trying to bug my throat but that Devil's a dumb devil you know what what are we keeping out you know something Brother David said he says what are we keeping out like why do we go into the storehouse why are we feeding on the message why are we digging into the word why are we even praying what are we keeping out well there's a lot of things that try to clog up the channel but I don't want to keep out prayer I don't want to keep out getting into the spirit yeah I just wanted to the Lord was dealing with me like my goodness when the most powerful weapon that has been trusted to man is prayer and the devil fights against that as individuals we come into the house of God we want to get together and we wanted to be strengthened we want to hear from God but that never can take the place of your personal prayer time we must be in prayer and sometimes we're weak in prayer I'm weak in prayer but I tell you if we could ever just get to a place where we can forget about anything everything and just search our heart and say you know let the love that you have for God go out to the needs of your brothers just like it was said here he said you know about praying I think it's our brother James said that he said confess your faults one to another pray one for another you know sometimes we look at ourselves and we judge ourselves in certain ways and we can't really get in the spirit of prayer because of our own Humanity but we can really get in and dig down and get into the spirit for somebody because we're burdened just go ahead and let your heart go out for somebody else you know I I was I was thinking about this and you know it's amazing how God deals with us in season and you know there's a question and answers and you know as you're raising children sometimes just having family or personal life or business life if you have your own business a lot of things they muddy up the waters in this real estate up here you know this noodle up here got a lot of things it's thinking but you know when we can get into the spirit of prayer and realize that God has the answer and he wants to reveal it and he he wants to Quicken our mind to the word and so as he he'll point us to a scripture all of a sudden or a quote and all of a sudden if we're faithful when he moves on us to get into the spirit of what he's trying to say and so I begin to realize I'm in a season and it's difficult because when I go to prayer my mind's drifting to this trial to this thing that's bugging me it's on me and so I go into the to the message and you know he said you know about children you know sometime and brother Branham said you know about one of his his uh children he says man she was um doing something and it upset Mita and he was he was explaining to her hey you know um she didn't mean that and I don't have the quote exactly right now but just paraphrasing and you know brother Branham told her he said you know you know I think it was uh Rebecca was starting to play these kind of musics that was kind of like a piano from the world or something you know and how many recall this the testimony okay so so you can go check it out for yourself and and but brother Brandon was saying you know Mita was getting um really upset because Rebecca was sassing was SASS and media he's like you need to go correct her it's like okay and so what brother Branham and it so blessed my soul because it it reverts back to the power of prayer and getting into the right Spirit creating the right atmosphere see if we get into that Shekinah Glory of God and we cultivate a real prayer life where we're in the spirit when we Face the trial it's not the carnal reaction because we've drawn from dividends we've caught the spirit we know that this test God has blessed us with the test thinking not strange when you come into diverse trials it's it's no strange thing in the spirit because it's like gold China and fire it's like character rising up because Christ wants to use you and your faith to go and do exploits amen so all of a sudden I realize brother Branham just in a simple way you know honey if Rebecca was going to be dying with some kind of disease or something it would be the same thing but what we're going to do is we're going to get right down and it's going to be a committal To God In Prayer right now we're going to put it in the hands of God the power of committal in prayer and really getting into the spirit of the promise and leaving it there don't pick it back up and start when the thoughts come and even the line vanities oh she's still doing it she's still this oh my I'm sure that the the eyes have a lot of hindrance but Faith doesn't have a hindrance we need to get in prayer and get into the spirit that God can give us a sovereign Revelation who we are in him what his power is through us we really want to get into the spirit of prayer because we're building a building but this is the House of Prayer this is where faith can move when we've been in prayer in the sweetness of the spirit is upon us oh just come over into a place where just the shadow the faith just the shadow can go over you sitting next to your brother you sitting next to your brother and just the shadow because you've been in the spirit of God and prayer and the word has so embodied you that God would be so pleased to take your vessel in the shadow would bless somebody oh my well I want to get into the spirit what a value I mean there's nothing that the world can compare to that you talk about a power you see why he fights us you see one of the Devils coming in but God is raising a standard he's entrusted you with three sacred virtues Womanhood how our conduct is in the world because the church is designated as a woman so God is entrusted three sacred virtues to the church of her Womanhood how she talks her manner of living before the world how she dresses how she honors as a Christian to God motherhood because God had placed within her the ability to bring forth life into this world not just slopping around with the seed of the world but we have the seed word of Christ and what is it to the word of God and the third sacred virtue I believe brother Brown says is to the word of God and to prayer and to Christ oh what a virtue and to think that you have a hidden strength we have a hidden strength and it's in prayer Amen to take God at his word say God this is your word I know that you've revealed it to me but oh God let me get in the spirit that you can Manifest this in me hey man your word can't fail it can't lie but what do I got to lay aside what do I got to lay aside have have some kind of entertainment some kind of sports taking up too much real estate that is clogging the channel every time I try to get into that prayer all of a sudden now I'm thinking about this I'm thinking about that we're human it happens but I say oh God help me get in the spirit amen the prayer of faith you know that's part of what the the elect called out Overcomers that's going to be their testimony because they had a Sweet Hour of Prayer and one day when our faith shall be made sight we're going to say see us wait a Sweet Hour of Prayer we won't have to have no more hands laid on the sick there won't be no more preaching they'll just be rejoicing you know that's what happens when we get into prayer and we get into the spirit of prayer all of a sudden God can confirm his word and we get to Rejoice him we get to thanking God and saying praise God my God is alive I have the victory in my heart now that's what George Washington had he had the victory in his heart we came out of that all night prayer and he went forward he didn't look at the circumstance there was no hindrance then amen maybe I'll just read a few quotes to see what the Lord has for us we you know one thing that when we're building something you know there's there's certain things that have to go into the construction and so some things are quality building materials and some things are not so when we're considering the prayer of faith and a prayer life and getting into the spirit we want to know what prayer is and what it's not amen so brother Branham makes this statement in 1952 in a message called believing God he says now God never did have his perfect will for a woman and a man to bring four children in the Earth did you know that God made man himself Out of the Dust of the earth and after the fall now I wouldn't argue about that because you know I've got some very funny views on it but after the fall the woman brought four children into the world God told her because you've taken life out of the world you have to bring it into the world look what kind of life it was after sex desire fleshly but when but then when the body's dying go back to the Earth the dust of the earth then God will make that Immortal Spirit out of it to the kingdom of God and to his throne Paradise and then on the second coming my mother's sitting here and my daddy that's gone on will never have to give his another body but God will mold one that's perfect and immortal and can't die and Abraham takes Isaac and they started towards the mountain now in verse 90's taken out of this when when Isaac was going to be offered he says now they came to the place that God had told him of and Abraham built an altar hmm and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid it upon the altar upon the wood now just coming I can see them coming away don't tell Sarah what's going on what was going because she would have screamed out I believe that it was Abraham's faith that performed the miracle in Sarah's womb because she doubted it even laughed when when it was so it was Abraham's Faith now brother Brown says this in paragraph 107. he said so therefore that's the reason said the prayer of faith shall save the the sick and individual's prayer amen it's the individual's prayer each and every one of us individually have this responsibility of prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man abaileth much oh if you only knew that in your hand Christ gave us the authority by his name by being Christians the most powerful weapon that has ever known the world has ever known amen I know you've heard that but I just want to excite us to to revive our hearts to this reality we're in a war this is not a picnic the devil is after you the devil's after me but in the spirit and receiving Revelation it shall not prevail it's not our good Doctrine it's not our good teaching it's not our good behavior it's Revelation by the spirit getting into the spirit of prayer to receive the spirit of Christ to act out his will amen and we can't do it alone a lot of times we get we forget we get going or human ways but it's the most powerful weapon ever known amen is another place where he speaks on prayer a message down knows to All Things 1952 July 16th he said after all friends it's the prayer of faith that saves the sick sometimes I've noticed here a few nights I've been watching and I noticed the people and I come through or maybe they want some if there's something in their life that's just not tallying upright and when they do that then we find that out then I tell it in the spirit and the way it moves they want me to pray for them see afterwards they're wanting me to pray for them see after all it's prayer that is the most vital force that God ever put in man the hands of mankind the the most powerful force that's ever been known is prayer do you believe that amen it's prayer that changes things look at Hezekiah when the prophet went and said all right Hezekiah you're not coming off that bed God's done said you're going to die right there where you're at and Hezekiah if you study it over he was he was just 15 years longer now remember you've got to give God a cause a reason now he didn't say just because I can get out there and ride around in a chariot and show the people that I'm a king no he wanted to rebuild the altars of God and a few things that to be done to get the kingdom in order right well I like that you know just like Nehemiah there was something he saw and then he began to say you know it was for this cause you know we want to rebuild and so I just think how this is in harmony with that and but he says you got to give him a reason and he says now this was to bring restoration to rebuild the altars of God and he prayed that God would give him 15 years longer and he wept bitterly just wept to God and he said God I beseech you to consider me I've walked before you with a perfect heart how many can say that tonight we've walked before God with a perfect heart my how many of us can say tonight we walk to him I've walked before the Lord with a perfect heart and I ask you to consider me now I want and almighty god Jehovah reconsidered the man's case because he prayed isn't that wonderful to think you know even God had sent the prophet over there you're you you're you're you're done he said wait I have this I have this reason why I want to continue to live you know and God has his way of doing look like he would have spoken right back and told him but I've considered your case again and I'm going to let you stay for that if you do that but how many knows he didn't he asked for it and he was granted to 15 years but he didn't do it you see it would have been better for him they didn't even get the next 15 years because he brought a disgrace upon the whole nation so that's just the thing when we get into the spirit of prayer and God gives us the revelation let's keep the Spirit Alive and revived and take courage to do what we said we do amen this this is not this is not uh what do they call that play fighting or Shadow Boxing no when we take the word and prayer it's because we're going after the enemy we mean business he's taken Souls of man and he's he's laid them captive by the thinking of Man by Creeds and dogmas he sold lies and Corruption many people are in bondage to the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes in the pride of life but brothers and sisters before we go to the world to make straight the past of all these people's lives let's get in there let's pray for him let's get into the right spirit amen so that God his spirit can come on the scene in those situations and it can be God speaking amen we want to get into his spirit it's like a man that knows that if he was going to a homeless camp and that money which I don't necessarily think that's the answer but let's say for this cause that money was going to be the thing that said if if they each one had a hundred dollars that would cure them so if you went there and you didn't stop at the ATM on the way what would that say no but we got the devil's answer amen we need to go into the storehouse because this is the very thing that God's making a deposit on but we need to go into prayer and get into the spirit because God wants to speak to your situations he wants to give you spiritual food in due season that when you face the devil in other people's lives that God can Quicken something in that very hour that's our God because he's a living God he's not some dead statue he's a personal God he wants to meet you in that secret place now the almighty God reconsidered the man's case because he prayed think of that the almighty God pronounced death on the man who reconsidered it amen my that's too much for me great Jehovah to a mortal to one of the Earth would reconsider his word that he said to him but God has a way of doing things it looked like he would have spoke right back and told him but I've considered your case again and I'm going to let you stay and do that and he didn't and he spake to the prophet and sent the prophet all the way back there again and tell him all right God heard your prayer see God revealed to the prophet what was going to happen and he came back your days is considered and you're going to come off that bed in three days so he got some polties I just think it's such a paradox you know I looked at that you know what poltice is he got some kind of like a a Sav it was like a like a natural mud and some other things and just laid it on him you know we started my mind in this story that got supernaturally just healed him and he came off the bed but sometimes God has something for you to do sometimes he wants you to get in action just like he put on one man he put he spit on his eye and put rubbed it on another time he got mud and said go wash you know sometimes God wants to give you a little Revelation now just to see if you'll be faithful even though it doesn't make sense God's looking for obedience God's looking for someone to get into the spirit that says I don't have to figure this thing out but I just want to be led by your spirit isn't it what that scripture says the sons of God are led by the spirit of God amen we've got some polties and so forth and put it on him and Hezekiah came off the bed and and was well now see what prayer does prayer is not exactly bringing God to man prayer is not exactly bringing God down to man it's bringing man up to God see as you pray you lose your sign of these Earthly things you sway out into somewhere else Way Beyond on and on and on until you get into his presence amen I want to get so far away from what I think is important oh there's no greater voice there's no greater voice of importance but the voice of God I think it's time for us to check up cut away from some things of the world I'm talking about I'm I'm preaching to me I'm talking to flesh amen because we want to get into the spirit get into the spirit of prayer so that faith can go to work amen and then your faith that you laid it out before God said now hear God here it is I want to get this I want to get well for this cause I want you to do this for me for this cause I want you to heal me see how specific this is and this is a simple prayer this is what faith and getting in the spirit can manifest amen he says for this cause I want you to heal me I don't want you to just think it I want you to say it in that secret place this is not a public show you take God at his word in the secret place and when you're in the spirit and you speak it you know this body must come subject because it's God in you amen it's your it's the power of God unto salvation that's where confession can rise up amen but we need to get into the spirit and let God do the speaking amen a lot of times in prayer we're doing all this speaking and like God some Aaron boy and we got this laundry list God do this do this do this I need a job I need I need clothes but he said seek ye first the kingdom of God he he closed the birds you know they they're all taken care of but they're not crying about TB and high blood pressure God takes care of them how much more you a son and daughter of God he cares do you care to get away and to spend time alone and get into his presence and to cut away and forsake all others yeah a lot of people they they will never show up to work late but oh my there's a lot of hindrances when it comes to visiting the Lord in in that secret Hour of Prayer or in the church house we want to honor our faith by honoring what we are taught let's get on fire let's have our prayer life at home when we get here oh I want to see you move Lord it'll be no surprise when the spirit moves because he's already moved on you in prayer that morning amen I'm not pushing it off to this brother and that brother what is my part I I'm obligated because God gave me his spirit I am a prisoner of his I'm a love slave this is not bondage if you feel this bondage it's time to get to the altar because when you receive Revelation you are a millionaire in faith I mean you feel like oh my I have everything because he said he'd give you all things when you get into the spirit and you can see who you are in Christ or you have all things matter of fact you could see I was there when he spoke in creation but we're going to get into this period and let prayer begin to utter out things we know nothing about there's things in prayer that we can get to when we cut away we know nothing about it but he wants to reveal it sometimes I feel like there's just so much you have bubbling on your heart you think about the prophet you know he says you know God's love is like is and a lot of times the Revelation it's like the pressure of a fire hydrant but we just need a little cup sometime just a little cup is all we can handle at a time sometimes at least that's the way I feel Lord so good I want to you to heal me from this cancer or this TB or this anemic condition whatever it is I will walk before you I will do anything I can I will give this testimony Everywhere I Go I'll be happy to do that Lord I will use my life not for myself I will use it for your glory to help others to see you now then you lay that before God and you said God will you consider me I love that isn't that wonderful praise God well praise God maybe we'll go another little while now one thing you don't want to pray for brother Brown says this in Christ is a mystery Christ is revealed in his word pardon me in 1965 August 22nd he said that's where I I thought of this subject he was looking at the picture whereas the Beatitudes and he saw Christ kneeling I believe it was but he says now this is where he got the inspiration he says Christ and the word is the same see they say how the Bible people say I was writing with a man not long ago he said think of it we are here on Earth the way we are and the only and we only know and can only say that we're saved by some Jewish Fable called the Bible I said sir I don't know how you say that but I don't believe it's a Jewish Fable I said he said well you pray what do you pray too well that's a good question what do you pray to you know I know that we're taught we're to pray to the god that is in you the kingdom of God is within you God by your new birth he placed his Spirit In You so we're not praying to some something we're praying to a personal God that is in you the power is within you to be transformed amen so we're praying now to the god that is in you he says now he said uh you pray what do you pray to I asked for such and such a certain thing and I didn't get it he said you pray wrong we should never pray to change God's mind we should pray to change our mind God's mind don't need any changing see see it's right he said not what you prayed for I know a young Catholic boy one time was he had a prayer book saying prayers and his mother for his mother to live and she died and he threw the prayer book in the fire see well see I don't go for the prayer book but anyhow see you take the wrong attitude you're trying to tell God what to do prayer should be Lord change me to fit your word not change not let me change your mind you change my mind see your mind don't your you you change my mind to your will and your will is written here in the book and Lord don't let me go till I got my mindset on your mind amen don't let me go until I Got My Mind Set On Your Mind and you know just got to get into that prayer Lord I'm going to get into the spirit don't let me go I got these things hindering me I got things that I'm thinking about oh but let me lay aside and don't let me go don't let me go until I have your mind amen the bride has thus saith the Lord as she keeps still amen I believe we just could draw strength from these quotes amen you change my mind to your will and it's written Lord don't let me go till I I Got My Mind Set just like your mind and then when my mind is set on your word then I'll believe every word that you wrote and you said in there you'd make everything work together for good to them that love you and I love you Lord that's all working for good amen praise God you know I think that um sometimes when we get into prayer we get we get Vision you know God gives vision you know that's what Revelation does is it unveils and it shows God and His word and his people and we begin to see what's really valuable and we're able to kind of make an adjustment like you know working 50 hours instead of just 40 hours you know maybe I'll just need to make an adjustment you know because of the value of something so that's what when we get into prayer and we get revelation I think those are the things that we can adjust and I'm talking for me and so I was thinking about this quote brother Branham said and be certain of God 1959 this was in July 8th he says this and um I think this is 58 paragraph 58 he says but they went down there and preached to the sodomites the modern Billy Graham and an evangelist preached down there would there to the world a great congregation they had but this one Angel stayed behind I want you to notice he preached to the elect the church that called out watch how he done it now he was a stranger listen now or you'll miss it now Jesus said as it was then so will it be in the coming of the son of man the gospel preached by God through a mortal being oh I love that the son of man is the gospel being preached by God through a mortal man you know and that Ministry hasn't ceased that Ministry is living in a people amen do you realize you're the Temple of the Living God we need to pray to receive that Revelation and by that Revelation become and withstand amen notice this man stood and looked at Abraham women these days wasn't like they are now every time somebody comes up in the yard the woman's got to put on her little shorts and go out there in the yard and see what her husband's talking about butting into his business shame on you shame on you men if you got any man about you and let your wife do that it's not it's all right I guess well that's raw but I I don't take it back it's the truth now that's just the truth I got a little respects for a man that'll let his wife do a thing like that smoke cigarettes drink whiskey wear those clothes those kind of clothes now man isn't man's not measured by how big his muscles he's got he's measured by the bag in his knees of his pants where he prays amen man is not measured by muscle that's Beast he's measured by character there's never was a greater man than Jesus Christ and the Bible said there was no beauty that we should desire him little stoop showed little fella but in him was God character man is measured by character amen he's seen man that weighed 250 pounds throw a baby out of a mother's arms and ravish her and you call that manned I call that Beast now listen this man sitting there said Abraham where is your wife Sarah a stranger how did he know he was married he was married how did he know that his wife's name was Sarah watch that angel what a message he gave Abraham said she's in the tent behind you and the Bible says that the angel had his back turned to the tent behind you said where is your wife Sarah how did he know that was his wife and how did he know his terrorism his name her name was Sarah watch the nature of the spirit now to the elect church and amen you know in that wonderful we know that we've had a visit and God is in the same nature as as declared where is your wife Sarah God has come hunting his bride amen he's coming looking for you now are we going to get into the spirit that God can place us and and find us that we could take our position I believe there's there's times that God can speak to us in services like this and we can catch a revelation catch the spirit but I as I've said before I just I don't I feel for me I don't want to substitute that for that hour of Consecration and and there's got to be more for us amen because we're still longing we're still hungering we still have trials we still have situations but I believe before we go to the to to fight the fight we need to get into the spirit and let God speak to us you know a lot of times we'll run out and try to deal with it and we're battling based on knowledge God's revealed stuff and so we know hey you shouldn't be doing that you shouldn't be doing that and all of a sudden we're over here and we're stirring up Strife but if we ever stop for a moment and steal away to God and say God I can't do this without your spirit I can't I'll just make a mess of this if I start acting out in my carnal side get lifted up get aggravated get irritated but oh God let me let me get serious about this Lord we're at the end we see that bombs in the hangar we see this is perplexity of time people are going absolutely insane he said it would be like the time that Satan's eating he's now going to be crowned they're going to Crown Him I mean there's going to be a a false prophet incarnate we're living at the threshold Saints we just want to really press into our prayer closet to really get into the spirit and really let God move upon us because we've got some great things ahead of us we got many victories to be won and I believe that if we fight our battles on our knees and we can come up from that place with the victory in our heart we'll just know that God will get the glory amen amen God is looking for is Sarah amen praise the Lord you know maybe just another five minutes you know while I was pondering you know when when we read the scripture about the patience of Job you know job and he he went through a lot of things in his life you know and he he you know he had faith and he also had a perfect heart before the Lord and you know he was tested and tried and he endured all of those things but you know at the end and you can go back and if if I'm misquoting I don't mean to but it really struck me that when Joe began to pray for his those those ones who mocked him and ridiculed him then he got a restoration and sometimes you're finding some things and you feel the oppressor and you feel like you're put out and you're being isolated you want to pray for your enemy you want to pray for your brother that may have did not get maybe the right attitude with you but you you might be the Difference Maker if you'll get that situation under the blood and in prayer and get into the spirit and watch how God may even use you if you're willing and it's just God's Sovereign hand and moment to give that person Victory amen because we all want victory over this flesh and we need each and every one of us to go into the prayer closet and fight our fight in those those times where we're in a Warfare and this is not a flesh and blood Affair we don't need to teach everybody all of their different woes and Wrongs we need to get into that prayer and let the spirit of God deal with our heart and then it can be Christ in us living out expressing his great love love covered a multitude of unbelief amen you know it was um brother Branham said this and and this is just one of these examples that um you were familiar with but in 1964 and in August 30th and questions and answers he said this he says it was it was in um Meridian Mississippi how many of the Oneness people brother Bixby who they were holding and sponsoring my meetings there was Oneness brother and one night in a meeting Billy Paul he had over an arena he'd given out cards and it was pouring down rain and the people were standing outside in umbrellas and everything and Billy gave them out prayer cards and there was and there was a and then he came to get me and while there was while he came to get me the little lady sitting down in the front she had a baby and another little lady trying to keep him quiet and and this little lady was sitting there with a Calico dress on even what it was she was a mother too and she was and she seen the little lady in the Holy Spirit spoke to her something in her heart pray for that baby amen that's what we want we want God to move on us and speak to us amen even in a situation like right now God move on me if there's somebody you want me to pray for you know what and that's what happened with this sister said the spirit Came Upon her and I I just love this story because it it depicts the conflict that's warring between the carnal mind and the spiritual mind amen he says now go pray for that baby well Sid the next time she passes I'll go pray for her the next time the devil's saying the same thing to you tonight the next time the next time How many times does he say the next time we don't know if there's going to be a next time amen we want to be desperate we want to be just pressing in like never before the next time she passes I'll pray for her and when she passes again but now she's the woman's holding a prayer card now we're battling she said I can't pray for that baby said brother branham's we'll pray for that baby tonight and who am I to pray for that baby that brother Branham is going to pray for her mine don't don't don't the devil attack you like that trying to water down to value of your prayer your faith your ability to fight against the lives of the devil to fight against sickness against sorrow we don't want to lay down our weapon now that was reverent that was nice but it can't always be the will of God sometimes it's different the Holy Spirit kept telling her go pray for that baby finally she thought that woman will turn down my she'll turn me down cold all right see the carnal mind at work that's what we gotta find we got to fight off the carnal mind that woman's gonna turn me down cold knowing she's got a prayer card she wouldn't want me to pray for her that baby she brought that baby here not for me to pray for it but for brother Branham to pray for it and the Holy Spirit kept telling me he kept saying go pray for that baby finally she said well to relieve myself I'll just say I'll give her my seat so she said honey one little mother talking to another would you I want you got a baby would you come and sit down here and take my seat she said oh honey I don't want you to have to take I don't want to have to take your seat I'm trying to keep my baby quiet said but look so tired and worn she said I am she said well sit down here and take my seed and she said I see you got a prayer card perhaps brother branham's going to pray for the baby she said we hope this number will be called and she said well I do too she said sister you are a Christian she said oh yes she said I'm a Christian too she said ever since I've been sitting here the spirit of the Lord was telling me pray for that baby would you give me permission I know that brother Brandon will pray for that baby if it's called and you just keep holding that your prayer card he'll get it said but if I lay my hands upon the baby and just offer a little prayer to make myself feel better and get from under what is calling me would you be offended would it offend you she said why certainly not darling pray for the baby and it was a little blue baby so the little lady prayed for it and she gave the lady her seed and she climbed up into the third balcony and was sitting up there some Christian brother up there gentleman enough to give up and give the lady the seed and sat down about an hour and a half later I came into the meeting and spoke a few minutes called the prayer cards and the woman was third or fourth in line with the baby and she sat up there and she said oh thank you Lord now I felt sorry for the little mother I believe the baby will get well now because brother Branham just the third or fourth he'll get the one thank you Lord the little mother setting their feeling for the baby you see that's what prayer will do when we get into the spirit we can get a real feeling we can get a real feeling it's not just our Doctrine I love this this is just oh that mother oh my when then when I come up and started praying for the baby when the lady came up she said I looked at her and said now your baby is a blue baby you brought it here to be prayed for now your name is such and so and so and you come from such and such a place but your baby is already healed there was a woman who had a burden on her hard her name is such and such so and so that setting here on the balcony the first at the end the fourth row in the third balcony prayed the prayer of faith for that baby and that baby's already healed she just dropped out of her seat almost my prayer my prayer of faith that baby's healed now what if she had not done that see what I mean now that woman would have had more Sympathy for the baby a mother to a baby than I would for a baby see the mother being can we do Miracles yes can we do miracles yes when we are directed by the Holy Ghost to do miracles go do it because it's the Holy Ghost directed amen I just think that's so wonderful you think about you your suffering is not in vain the trials that you are going through you know Jesus he suffered in all like manner so that he could be a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmity and you're going through tests you're going through trials the devil has put blinders to where all the time when we want to try to enter into prayer we're looking at our our trial we're looking at our problems we're looking at all these other things but God wants to use those for others and so it's your feeling for the sick it's your feeling for The Sinner it's your feeling for your brother in the wrong if you know better enter into prayer so that if I'm making a mistake pray for me amen amen we want God to direct amen praise the Lord maybe just another five minutes you know I was thinking about you know the burden that brother Branham had with the with the tax case and you know it was a it was a great trial for him and we know some of the things that he experienced because it's on record but something an interaction with Mita it struck out to me and and it's in a message called absolute it was before he preached a message surge is this the sign is this the sign of the end and um in in 62 in December the morning of the 30th he said but I believe this is in paragraph 24 23. but these these governments now no matter how well we think they are yet they back of them they're dominated by Satan these kingdoms he said are mine I'll do with them whatever I wish to I'll give them to you if you'll worship me Jesus said get the hints thou shall Worship the Lord and him only shall thou serve and then I got discouraged my wife is listening to me and I went on and said no sir if I owed it I'd have paid it but I don't owe it and I'm not going to pay it and that's all how many are familiar with the case so brother Branham whenever he was going out on the road and campaigning they had it set where he would put Branham campaign and he would deposit the funds for the meetings and different things into the account and now they said that he owed back taxes and it was a trial for five years where they were going through and the attorney said hey we can we can fight this we can get it but I'm going to tell you that even though we can clear you of it and it can be like a gift and an inheritance and all this it's still it'll stay with you and so brother Branham was saying but if I owed it I would pay it they can't they don't have nothing on me he was free of the the charge he didn't use any of the money for himself it was all for the ministry and so now he's he's just you know so he's in this situation and now he says he said now I don't owe the money I'm just gonna go I'm not going to pay it that's all I said how can I pay it anyhow so I went home and I said me to wash the kid's face and get their clothes ready I'm leaving I said they won't even anything I'll just upside down he said what have I done tell me I said yet me forty thousand dollars I don't realize what that means you don't realize what that means to me and she come in as a nice wife would and said I'm leaving she said we you think that would do any good if you prayed over it I thought well maybe I'd pray maybe I had to Pray Again and he goes back in and it seemed like he said to me a scripture you know this is real food for my soul and I just I feel like the transparency of our prophet in one of his greatest trials can be a real strength and I love it because it was Christ in our Prophet it was God preaching his gospel what a life worthy of the Gospel really looks like amen so he's in this great trial and here he is he said now I prayed no doubt he's had five years to pray and Commit This thing to the Lord and so now his wife have you prayed about this oh my and it's sometimes we're reacting like oh I'm just gonna we're just gonna get out of here watch the kids face we're just going to leave but so he says that he goes back in and it seemed like he said the scripture to me and he says always we want to watch the scripture what God did about it you see and one day he was asked to him you know trying to accuse him to the government he said is it right for us Jews to give tribute or taxes to Caesar he says you've got a penny he said what's the inscription on it the inscription on it he said Caesar he said then give Caesar the things that are Caesar's and to God the things that is God's and then I thought I'll turn over to the Bible and read it see when we get back into the spirit and pray to pray again you see how he told him he said just go there's a little bit more I want to show you in the scripture what you got is good but I want to show you a little bit more let's go back into the scripture I got something more I want to show you he says always watch that scripture what God did about it and one day he asked me excuse the government what is the inscription it's Caesar and in verse 33 he thought of that and I turned over to the Bible and read it I thought truly Lord that's right but this belongs this doesn't belong to Caesar this was yours it wasn't Caesar's see I think sometimes when we we know that we're right we we get an ignition we're not moving we're not moving but I think this is such a wonderful expression he says it wasn't Caesar's and if it was it had been mine I'd been I'd paid more taxes or something well that would have been different that it belonged to Caesar's but it's yours see it didn't belong to Caesar in the first place you know he was always got the answer in the word he has always got the answer in the word I just read a little further and he said say Simon haven't you got a push hook in your pocket to see yeah he always cared a little fish hook and a string he says I've just made a deposit this morning and a fish Bank down there in the river you know he said I've made a deposit and the bank the banker will certainly give up what he's got just go down there and throw your hook in the river and when he got up from the bank opened his mouth you see he gave out of the coin let's not offend him don't bring an offense to them go pay it Simon you'll be for me and you and I thought true God you got a fish bank and everything else across the country I don't know how it'll be done but we went down and got to the brothers and the church stood on the note and they put the note in and I got 40 000 and paid it off amen I think that's just a sacred reality you know in the spirit of Christ we don't want to offend nobody we don't want to go to the world as if we got something that they don't know we want to come in the spirit of love the spirit of humility the spirit of prayer and we we don't want to bring on fence we don't want anybody to think we're not a Christian you know we

cast me not away cast me that away from my presence [Music] [Music] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation [Music] listen to me I've been blessed tonight it's always a good reminder to know that there's always power and prayer you know brother bam says in the message token it says that when we're in prayer and we pray as the blood of Jesus Christ that speaks for you because we are covered by his blood so when you pray it's not you that's praying but it's the blood of Jesus Christ bringing it to God for you on your behalf [Music] but you have to commune with them I remember the story in the scripture Matthew 28 or 26 I believe Jesus was praying is so much that the disciples fell asleep fervent prayer catching the revelation of what he was meant to be and who he was meant to who to to and what to do he was praying power and prayer [Music] I believe that we have authority when we pray before the Lord because it's a relationship science that's how you get to talk to your lover where you can sit there on your knees and talk about his goodness talk about all that he's done for you the little things sometimes are more important because we could walk daily with those things and so I've just been blessed tonight to be remembered again how important it is to be in prayer and it was just on my heart as a dismissal I believe every one of us tonight is covered by the blood of Jesus Christ and if we can all pray as a dismissal it could be for somebody that you have on your heart it could be for yourself if you have a need but remember the prophet said that if we're covered by his blood when we pray it's not you that's praying but it's the blood of Jesus Christ and so if we can just get together and pray as a dismissal I think it'll benefit us and me and all of us together as a body just to ask the Lord for his leadership to walk with us to guide us walking with the Lord like Enoch then like Noah did daily let's just go before them together as we just pray [Music] Lord we ask Lord tonight Lord by prayer and we can sit here Lord and just pray before us Lord I will be able to pray for a situation next morning [Music] Lord and how you just talk to your children's Lord reaches lower when we could just charge Lord in the presence of Your Love Lord It's it's a toughest unique power humility [Music] lord of the things that were surrounded by the human work in a marvelous way foreign [Music] [Music] I'm blessed [Music] you crazy you are the light the truth the way I bless your name I bless your name and prisoners change [Music] Paul inside [Music] and they were free I bless your name today [Music] [Applause] [Music] Sunday night out [Music] goodbye in our prayers in your mind Reach Out [Music] by those days [Music] I bless your name [Music] before I
