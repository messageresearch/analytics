Description:
The Heart Of The Matters
Br. John Andes
Sunday Morning  Service: July 25,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

amen it's so nice to be able to visit you today in dallas texas it's nice to have special meetings and come and it's all just full but it's nice to be able to come and see the local assembly see your smiling faces and i think most of us can get into the sanctuary today and that's good you know it's good to have special meetings it's nice to have people visit but it's also good to just kind of come with the home folks and fellowship together how you doing today is all good wow we appreciated that song sister julia thank you for singing that song if it wasn't for grace why none of us will be here today but grace made a way for you in this dark hour hallelujah it's nice to have our friend opening a word of prayer today one of our best friends from many years ago amen all doing okay today well the pastor's away brother david mcgarry and the associate is away brother billy and then the associate of the associate brother matthew mcgarry's away and then the associate of the associated this whole brother andrew's away so i guess you're left with a spare tire is that okay the the spare tire is something that this is hidden most the time and you don't even know about it until you need it i remember last time i was here and somebody back there wasn't smiling the whole service and i said i'm not going to end the service till you smile you all remember that i'm not going to read a scripture until some of y'all smile amen give me some good old southern hospitality if y'all live in a state that's free then surely we ought to be able to say praise god hallelujah [Applause] many are away but the lord is here he doesn't know sunday from tuesday or thursday he just wants to come into our private lives and i thank you for brother steve whether steve was out back from africa congo and i'm heard that he might not be here but he's here today and i was so happy brother steve was here is that good to have a song leader that can just oh bring us into the presence of god we come in from this wicked world and just let off the pressure does anybody know what i'm talking about are you all appreciating that you can come to church mama in uganda today they're in um their fifth week of lockdown again six weeks of just total lockdown not able to come out of their homes only for without permission not able to have church today uh in other places there's been other waves and waves of this we just ought to be thankful i i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord you know it was so wonderful to be alone this morning in the house where i was staying and go into a room and shut the door and kneel down and pray alone but it was better to come into the house of the lord and be with the body of christ does anybody know what i'm talking about like you can be all alone you can have god in your personal life and that's the main thing but it's different when you come to church and be with other brothers and sisters does anybody know what i'm talking about and you hear the word and you hear the songs and you just something wells up within you that's what heaven is going to be like so heaven is visiting us today today we're going to speak from our hearts brother david mcgary and sister leslie and their family all of their family has opened up their hearts to us over the years to allow us to have our liberty so i'm going to take my liberty and i'm going to speak with the lord laid on our hearts to say and that is the heart of the matters the heart of the matters that's our title the heart of the matters because you know we could talk a lot about everything else that's going on in your life and house the prices and how's this and your school and the summer could talk about all of that but we really want to touch on the heart of the matters and you know i think you've noticed this life isn't easy no more it seemed to be brother jackson like it's not just one thing or two things three things it's like there's matters there's issues is that true it just seems like life isn't simple anymore it's like multifaceted and if we're not careful as believers we can get strung out on this and that and this and answering and today i just really want to come to the heart of the matters and let the lord jesus touch that is that okay so let's not have an ordinary church service this morning let's let the lord jesus just touch that place do you know what still the number one killer of human beings is heart disease i just googled it in the back room but i have my opening quote is a prophet telling us because back then the number one killer physically was heart disease but spiritually it's sin disease so naturally it's a heart issue and spiritually it's a heart issue all the symptoms and all the things that a person might be uh reflecting is coming from the heart so let's just all drop down all of our facade and let him deal with the heart thank you let's stand today and we'll turn to our scripture that is in psalms 48 and then proverbs thank you musicians so wonderful to have musicians that psalms chapter 48 is our scripture who knows what these things are what are what is this binoculars we're going to have a demonstration in a few minutes about binoculars and focusing in you can be looking at something and it's all fuzzy different you know but then the lord just focuses it in you can see it clearly so in just a few minutes we're going to speak about that psalms 48 if you notice in your bible it might say a psalm and song and psalm for the sons of korah some of your bibles might say that and in cora's day they came against the prophet and came against the word for their day and the earth swallowed up a a bunch of people but the bible says the sons of korah died not there were actually sons of korah that did not stand with their father even though it was in their family they stood back and said i'll stand with the word and for years after that the sons of korah were actually leaders in the church in the message and it was like a sign to the other believers that you don't have to bend and bow to pressure that's right around you even in your family or job or church you can stand for the word so i'm not going to preach about that but i thought it was just kind of interesting that this is a song for the sons of korah the bible says great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our god and the mountain of his holiness the bible says he's beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth is mount zion on the sides of the north the city of the great king god is known in her palaces for a refuge we didn't have our psalm reading this morning so let's the congregation all of us read together verse one through three that we just read out loud great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our god in the mountain of his holiness beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth is mount zion on the sides of the north the city of the great king god is known in her palaces somebody say praise the lord now verse 2 we're talking about the heart of the matter he's beautiful for situation what about your situation is he beautiful is he precious there's prayer requests that we could have read today there's needs around the world people or maybe even believers that are struggling for life precious in the sight of the lord as the passing of a saint so let your life be precious while you're living so that when you go it can be precious i'm being real today it's not some magic wand that's waved over your casket and a preacher puts you in heaven don't do that to us live your life so there's enough evidence that your life puts you there precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints but look in verse 2 beautiful for a situation make him beautiful today in your situation in verse 3 god is known in her palaces for a refuge so let us run into that today uh proverbs chapter 4 verse 23 is our last verse just one more verse if you don't mind we love the bible don't we it's god's binoculars so proverbs chapter 4 verse 23. wonderful words of life how many believe in the faithful ministry that god lay something on their hearts it's actually personal for that service for that group of people for what you have need of how many believe that so we're not preaching out in the stars today we're preaching right here to you to these stars these sons and daughters of god proverbs chapter 4 verse 23 [Music] keep thy heart with all diligence focusing in on the heart the heart of the matters keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life out of where where are the issues of life keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life so god give us a restored heart we believe the message of the hour malachi 4 says it will turn the it will turn the not just our doctrine or our minds but our heart may the lord do that today for all of us give us a new heart if that's what's needed a new spirit in jesus name god bless you you can have your seats today wonderful congregation i just sense the presence of the lord here in this place isn't that wonderful so today as a we ministered friday night in seattle we were in denver colorado last week with brother fosten and and friday night in seattle preaching for the church there and the ministry and the church sends their greetings to you and flew overnight so that we would be here saturday to prepare for this morning service christian life tabernacle the heart of the matters as i came into my room um it was early saturday morning because we flew all night brother david picked us up early and then these thoughts came into my heart and i began to write them down on the heart of the matters and the heart matters and the matters of the heart and heart issues we had already prepared things to say but just really our title and the thought today comes from the inspiration of things that come from the heart and going to the heart of the matter what it really means because as we read in psalms and proverbs you can put that up again brother david's proverbs 4 23 to keep thy heart with all diligence the heart is the center it's the main thing it's the middle of everything in your heart if your heart stops beating and then blood stops flowing through your heart and then your brain stops functioning you're gonna die we can say that naturally and we might even kind of say well it goes without saying if someone's heart stops and their brain starts functioning they're going to die is that true if that's true in the natural then that's probably the main thing spiritually why people today are spiritually having so much trouble it's heart trouble and if the number one natural thing in the world that is the killer of humans you can just google that this afternoon not right now but this afternoon it's still the number one killer is heart disease and if it's speaking of something spiritually because the natural types the spiritual then there it must really be a heart issue then so we can talk about a lot on the outside but really it's the heart of the matter it's the inside it's really it's more than just an organ that's inside of us that circulates blood and is kind of you would say it's the seat of physical life you'd say it's the center of physical life but i'm thinking more spiritually today of the heart of the matters because from the heart comes your vigor comes your strength it's the s it's the center part it it goes to the soul it goes really the believer that has the mind of christ it's the really the heart of our lives is not what you think what i think it's having the mind of christ not up here but the mind of christ or his will to know what he wants done with the word it comes from the heart the heart is the fountain it's the seat of your thoughts of your passions your desires your appetites what's driving you as an individual it is your affections and purpose in life it is what you're endeavoring to achieve out of from the heart of the matter should come our motives and our objectives it's your understanding it's the facility and the very seat of your whole life and from there comes your will we have a lot of strong-willed people today in america especially there's a lot of outspoken and out there and it is everything's out there you know that's more of a curse than a blessing america is not heaven it's a land that is falling apart i know there's many from africa around the world that want to move to america and they find out when they move here it's not uh the promised land there's nowhere on this globe of earth without christ that's going to make you happy you might be in church today or streaming or wish you were on a beat somewhere or wish you had a few million dollars well we found out in the last few weeks you can just talk to bill and you know mrs m gates or you know talk to bozo bezo i think they said that last time and their wives and husbands it's not having billions of dollars that makes you happy then why are you striving for that houses on the lake and i'm from seattle i know exactly where bill gates and his wife well one of their houses is in the elevator that goes down to lake washington and it's just millions of dollars that's not going to make the wife happy it's the heart there's heart issues going on we're finding out you can fly to the moon you can fly to outer space and spend you know 10 and a half minutes or 11 minutes and come back and woohoo but when the thrill's all over and the champagne is dried off of your astronaut suit you got to lay your head down on the pillow if you don't have jesus you're lost and we can look in the world and kind of chuckle at that but what about among us today most of god's people are poor people so why are we striving for things that aren't even real and even people's health we found out through this pandemic people are so concerned about their health and whether they mask or whether you're vaccinated or whether you distance or whatever they're trying to keep their life and their heart and their health as the main thing but friends for the believer whether we live or whether we go if you've given your heart to christ it takes away that fear and that drive and that anxiety and that pressure and who are you trying to be anyway if the lord's done with us then i want to go if he's not done with us it could be a freight train barreling down the track and satan tried to tie you up and throw you on the track for a joke and to take you early well at the last second there could be a little ant just flick its head and flick me off the track we can talk about a lot of things i'm just speaking a little bit to get our hearts all lined up but our heart is the main thing it's where all your emotions and the affections and your passion in your life it's the middle of everything and psalms 48 verse 2 we can put that up again brother david the bible says he's beautiful for situation and i want to say today for each one of you god is beautiful for your situation god is beautiful for any matters any issue of life and that's why i want to speak on this heart of the matters because god is beautiful for your issue for your matter now proverbs 4 23 that we read and we can put that also on the screen to keep thy heart with all diligence that means to guard your heart observe and take heed take charge of your heart don't let it just run wild and get caught up with your with social media and media and your cell phone and you look at that so much or you look at your device or you look at your bank account and it really moves your emotions it it causes you to start thinking a certain way you're so focused in and you're watching and you're able to just get animated and your emotions are moved by a device or what you see on that device if that's true in the natural what about the spiritual that god can move our hearts toward him toward eternal things toward the things of god i think that's why we have church on a sunday morning is to set our hearts right keep thy heart with all diligence that means watch over it protect it be like a watchman wait for your heart treasure up your the memories of your life keep it within the bounds of the word we want to be blessed of god we want god's blessing we'll keep your heart in the bounds of his word let not your heart be troubled jesus said can you bring that up brother david i think it's john what scripture is that somebody help us out very first verse of that chapter let not your hearts be troubled john 14 you think i think too is it john 14 verse 1 let not your heart be troubled you believe in god believe also in me he didn't say let not your mind or your spirit because god knows that if our heart is connected to the right thing our spirit will be calm or we'll be uh would be able to even though we're multitasking we're focused in she's the main thing and out from him flows everything out of our lives it's not our will be done it's his will be done oh god bring us to that place today y'all are listening so well keep my heart with diligence means that i'm going to pay heed and i'm going to beware because satan is on an all-out attack to take your heart to destroy the center of your life he rapes he abuses he comes right in and smashes in we see a world that's intoxicated this morning they are intoxicated with a demonology what satan's broadcasting by his world wide web why is it this generation that has become so worldwide and we become a global village and we can know what's going on in in congo or in china or in japan a person could be watching the olympics today right here in this room and there can be voices and colors and flags and medals going through this room and there is right now but it just takes a little something and brother david could bring it right up on the screen for you who won a gold medal today who won a bronze medal you say oh i didn't know that oh my because it brought it to your senses it's in another place it's it's literally thousands of miles away but technology could bring it into this room right now and make it so real some of you would be happy some of you say ah and if that's true in the natural what about the spiritual god could make his will knowing he could project a word he could put something maybe on that screen right there you could say that is thus saith the lord for me and i'm grabbing a hold of it god reached into that other realm and he brought into this realm what i needed to hear and it touched my heart and it moved me it might have been a service that was kind of dry kind of you didn't really expect much but god came by that way and turned to heart i think he did that for you brother jackson one day right it was a service you came and maybe not a great dynamic movement and it wasn't a special meeting i don't think but god moved upon brother jackson's heart god moved it could be for your little girl today or your little boy they could be for years in the presence of god and in the atmosphere but one day the lights come on everything begins to make sense that things begin to come in line that's the holy ghost oh lord send the holy spirit today amen minister to us in our heart of the matter now in 1963 brother brennan mentioned this in arkansas we've heard many people say that the number one killer is heart disease he said i differ with them not to be different i just differ because i know it's wrong the number one killer is sin disease right not all heart disease it's sin disease our number one heart disease doesn't he said the main thing that kills the people today it's number one is sin disease sin is unbelief unbelief in what the bible yes it's the number one sin is disease that kills the people both spiritually and that'll make them kill physically of course of course he said now this is brother branham going real deep down into our hearts he says they can already prove that men that hold grudges and women who fuss and stew and fight and argue they'll die it'll cause cancer fungus and everything else will set in and ulcers did you all know that today you you just thought your heart was a organ in their pump and brother branham's trying to bring it spiritually to the heart of the matters that people today that hold grudges and and people that fuss and stew and fight and i hope this isn't your home i hope this isn't spiritually after all these years as a christian that this is what that what's been produced i pray that there would be a hunger for the heart of god that if we're guilty of any of these things that's why brother john felt led to preach on this people that hold grudges and they fuss and stew and fight and argue they'll die it'll cause cancer and fungus and everything else will set in and ulcers we were made to be happy god made us to be happy and free he said you were made to live like children before your father and know that he makes every day everything work right for you each day praise god and that includes june july the 25th 2021 today has been made god made it for you everything's gonna work out right today and you started it good by being in the presence of god friends we might as well start feeling comfortable we're going to live like this for eternity except no more work no more trouble no more heartache no more grudges and fussing and stewing not when you go out into your car go home but the whole atmosphere is going to be burnt off the earth is going to be burnt off there's not going to be any of that in heaven all heart disease is going to be dealt with here on earth then i say lord purge it out of my life purge out the things of my life that's not of you lord come to the heart of the matters the matters the matters that i would live my life for you see there's not three or four or five different walks of life that you and i can choose to walk in today there's only one for the believer it's god's perfect will that you embrace it's what you were ordained to do and what god called you before the foundation of the world that's what a believer is striving for that's why you feel out of sorts and you feel kind of out of you know things just aren't is because we're living in a body and in a realm it's just not right but don't bring that over into the spiritual and then start having questions about the message messenger about the bible or about the things of god those are the only things that's right can this church say amen i think this church today could use a real good dose of the holy ghost i'm including myself because this is my morning service a real good baptism of fire not just good times and happy times but times that we have matters or we have issues of life when god comes to the heart and i can really have the word strike my heart and my life is never the same and i'm i'm waiting for that i'm longing for that i'm just we're hungry and thirsty for something that can satisfy us hallelujah woman at the well you might not have never heard this like this before but it's god trying to bring you a fresh drink of water so now it's time for the binoculars these things you all know what these are right and in victory day this is where we got this from and i i hope that you don't feel brother john's too juvenile i said i'll bring some binoculars to dallas and and have a little demonstration maybe somebody will catch it is that okay i could read about it we can talk about it but let's just look at it for a little bit because god invites men to look but he said man wants to show himself and man wants to look at what god is trying to show him on the basis of his own idea when god is trying to show him something but the man wants to accept it upon the way that he looks at it and he's talking about taking binoculars or you might be driving down the road i know some of you have been on vacation or uh you have been on vacation or you want to go on vacation or maybe you are on vacation and um god you say well look look there look at here it's somebody trying to bring your attention look at that mountain look at that over there or look at that accident oh do you see that there we just drove by an accident something to strike your attention something to trying to get you to look away from where you're looking and look to something look at that mountain or did you see that over there did you see that shopping center it's the next exit you say look at that tree or look at that something when god is trying to get you and i to look to his innocent substitute and look to him look to christ he said that's what causes the trouble now we're going into the service that's what causes the trouble when men does he picks up the glasses to view off in this distance see what god's trying to show him and he fails to focus his glasses he starts talking about a story about one time on a trip in the mountains somebody was saying here take these glasses and look over here at a certain thing and i picked up the glasses and i seen three or four different objects he i know there was something wrong with that he said this antelope was standing out in the field there seemed to be three or four of them standing together i said what was it the antelope was perfectly one antelope the glass was all right but what i had to do was to draw that focus [Music] some of us get so lazy we just always like our hands our head and we need to focus today i didn't catch that until just right now when he said draw the focus and in the back room the lord put put that on my heart to sing draw me draw me lord so it must be that he's trying to draw us to move the focus let's get some action in our believing are you going to sit there and die why should we hear and die when there's life when there's a stream flowing dip down in it he's not asking you to go to the moon just dip down into the water he's dealing with heart issues matters of your life some of you know exactly what i'm talking about the holy spirit is talking to you right now and so he was looking into this field and he saw three or four things when really there was only one out in there it wasn't something wrong with the glasses nothing wrong with the antelope and really nothing wrong with him but he was looking at it wrong and there seemed to be three or four of them there and there was the antelope just standing perfectly the glass was all right but i had to draw the focus till i got all three of the antelopes into one and made one antelope well brother i know there's three o there's four can't you see over there there's no there's four and then you're back and forth and somebody else is like there's one what's the problem it's how you're looking at it hello believers i hope you're being spiritual today but i had to pick up the glass and look through it and there was three antelope standing there the glass was out of focus i have to focus that glass back till i get it to a place where i can see one antelope then the glass draws it close enough to me till i can see what it looks like now he said god gives us the bible and the bible is the word and the word is god so that is our binoculars that's our glasses then we go to looking in the bible and seeing four or five different ways it needs focusing so you say we all read the same bible why is there all these ways nothing wrong with the bible it hasn't changed for thousands of years then could it be that it's the way we're looking at is it then my heart maybe the focus needs to change and it's the same thing it's us that start looking through that's why our time gets so challenged our time in the bible our time in the word our time to listen to things that help focus and you've got to have enough strength to move and draw and focus if you want a new heart if you want to then you got to go to the hospital you've got to be willing to get out of your stubbornness and you're so hard-headed i'm going to go to work today and i've got to go do this and if you're not careful you could have a serious heart problem and not even know it you start getting shortness of breath you start man i used to be able to run i used to be able to walk i used to be able to live now i can't even do the normal things of life you've got a heart problem there was a senior pastor of the message brother jason watkins a few weeks ago he just tried to go for a walk in his neighborhood which he normally did he normally could just but he just he just noticed it just he could hardly walk for 10 minutes it's just i can't i don't know if i'm going to even make it back home those are the symptoms but yet you look at him he's his handsome brother he's married he's got a family he's got grandchildren he's got a church you say well nothing looks wrong to me brother but the heart of it there was something wrong so he went in for tests they couldn't find nothing they all kinds of tests and things and don't don't you worry i'm going to get to this i know it takes brother john a long time huh test and and finally he was in the doctors and he started to have some of these symptoms right there and they and they were able to diagnose it and they went 99 of one of his main arteries was totally locked up he had days if not any moment he could have just collapsed like 99 of his mane where the blood was flowing where the life was flowing he needed help and thank god that god provided away and and years ago it would have took open heart surgery and i have a picture right here but i'm not going to show you but years ago it used to be they opened up the heart and it was like literally weeks and weeks of therapy and getting you back on your feet again do you know they went up through brother jason's arm like this went right into his heart put a splint in there and he's back he's ready to preach in two weeks unless he's back he's strong he's vibrant he but friends there could have just been any moment he could have collapsed but god rich in mercy new there's a heart problem i wonder today how many spiritual heart problems are in the church and it looks like they're good and look they drove here and they're walking up and maybe they sing maybe they but there's really the heart there's an issue there the matters the issues of life is trouble friends i trust that god would raise up a sensitivity more among us it was here when brother branham was here he would go right down the row and say you brother there you there and then you sister there and this is your name this is your address and you sitting there your name is jim hayes and this is this is your well i know brother jim but okay you there and you brother know that and this and your sister there know that i don't know your name but god knows your name and hallelujah this is exactly what it is and people wow there's a gift of god god is in our midst let me tell you what friends brother branham doing that did not bring god on them it it brought the people's awareness that the god that was in the room is present i wonder after all these years have we become so dull and dead in the message that we we just think oh nobody knows nobody cares nobody sees and little do you know the same lord jesus that was here 60 years ago is right here at christian life tabernacle he knows your name he knows your address and if brother john would say it right out there this is what you were thinking yesterday at 2 38 is that right sister you were in a certain place and you went into the wash restroom and shut the door and there was a pain and there was blood but you didn't tell nobody god saw that it's actually more serious than you think but god is here to heal you today wouldn't we rejoice today would we rejoice because god brought that into our attention he then why are we so dull why do we need those type of things as humans to awaken us why can't we take the word of god when we hear the word when we read it why can't we just rejoice at the word it's because satan has dulled our senses and i say god forgive us and god help us and make your presence more real among us that the supernatural could just flow and lives could be healed and lives could be touched and lives could be set free right here today i'm getting through to some of you but some i realize i'm not hitting the mark god help us today draw it in lord focus it in so now brother david you're gonna help us now we got the sign okay i need a volunteer nobody wants to volunteer okay nobody wants to volunteer i need a volunteer somebody to come up and help brother john come on up brother uh thank you lord let's give him a round of applause please god hallelujah so brother i really want you to read something that's in the back of the room back there can you look through these these these are about two or three thousand dollar binoculars i don't know if i want to touch him no i've been given permission but i told the brother i wouldn't let somebody younger than 10 use them because i didn't want to drop them so i'm trusting you can you please look through there and read that sign that our brother's holding up stand up brother stand up please thank you no no no don't focus anything just look through there and please read that sign can you just focus in on that and not without focusing no sir but it's very clear back there not through these things okay so you don't see that no but there's something written very wonderful on that back there i'd really like you to read that to the church okay okay can i focus in now i don't know let me try let me let me look oh you want to know man he's very possessive today okay it's these right here okay i just want to show you if you turn that thing yours is different yeah that's the problem we all have our ways and our thoughts and how we think it ought to be and can you just look at that and focus in and draw in there you're over 40 right i am oh lord help us might need my readers here okay love is patient yes love is kind amen let's have some interaction all right little more it's not envy all right it is not proud oh yeah it does not dishonor others praise god it is not self-seeking it is not easily angered oh keeps no record of wrongs love does not delight in evil oh goodbye always trust did you say always always trust you couldn't read that before though no sir what was wrong i had the focus was on it it's good word if we heard things like this it would help us it'd be better than vitamins and oils read a little bit more it always protects always trusts always hopes always preserves love never fails you're not done but but when you first stood up here can you hold our sign back up we really wanted to know what was back there but when you looked through that it was all fuzzy can you describe it was just everything was blurred together you couldn't see nothing wow kind of like now i can't see no i can't read it either brother we're over 40 that's right we're suffering together but could that be why that people look at things in their life and it's all fuzzy they don't see clearly absolutely wow but the sign didn't change so what happened that you were able to read that to us it went from blurry to clear very clear can you bring it up and the last line you read you're going to have to stand up brother because the last line there can you read that again focus in it always protects always trust always hopes always preserves love never fails i think love never fails that just does something for me yes sir then i want more of love let's give our brother a round of applause thank you brother i love you love you thank you jesus i'm glad we can come to dallas and not have social distancing i gave him a hug praise god there's something about it but was there anything wrong with the brother same brother same binoculars let's say that sign was the will of god for your life let's say it's the direction for your future and you're trying to find out what is that and you squint and you look and then you don't know you go to a service you read and i just don't you and you're just trying and god then brings in a focus and you're able to see clearly you're able to walk toward that isn't that different how many today would say lord focus my life to your word let me see what you want me to see not three or four out there and brother i know there's three and i know there's four and then another brother say all right there's two well focus it in there's only one over there is that why there's so much fighting and trouble and grudges then ulcers then fungus is because there's a heart problem then it's not the binoculars it's not going out there buying a five thousand dollar pair there's got to be something wrong with the bible got to be something wrong with the message then what are you going to do with your time now you're going to watch more movies go spend more money go work try to put your money in in your pocket and you find out there's a bunch of holes in there and it's falling down your socks and your stockings and you wonder where it all went and you work you work 80 hours and 90 hours and you're still not any better off what is it well well it is the economy but it's also are you really seeking first the kingdom of god are you really finding out what his mind is for your life or you're just like everyone else in the world that's struggling going here there do you know the path of least resistance or you know one day brother john i'm going to run into that that brother this is going to be everything to me and then you wake up two years later and you find out he has mistakes and fail and that's sister she's just going to be this and somebody's going to say yes to me and then it's all going to be this and she's going to be submissive and she's going to say yes all the time and all then then she says no and she says opposite and then you're in and then you're in there i know that doesn't happen in this church but i'm just saying you know that's other people you know it's a heart thing it's friends not one of us have it all together we need the body there's not one person that can see it all clearly or there can be an accident or an injury you know that's why boxers if you notice or martial arts they'll get into a place where they get a little cut or they get a little bl something going and they'll keep punching at that punching at that weakness and then pretty soon where you can be strong you i'm bigger than and then all but you get a little blood going and it goes into the eye and you can't see and then pretty soon they'll blindside you they'll you might be better you might be bigger but there's blood and it causes your vision you have a two or three thousand dollar pair of binoculars but if your eyes are all bloodshot and this and that and if you have a heart attack you're laying down in the hospital room somewhere you need help you might have drove by that place for the last three years but today you need the hospital so you go driving in there an ambulance takes you you know you used to not be so excited i got i need help i need a word i need counsel when you got it all together and you're going good and life's good but there comes a crisis there comes a situation there's a minister in florida he's not the senior pastor but he's an associate and he has a wonderful wife and they have wonderful children that serve the lord and grandchildren but i think it was a year or year and a half ago she got diagnosed with a certain physical condition it was like cancer something serious down in her organs they live in florida in a certain city and we were sitting with them the other day this is now over a year a year or something later by the jackson they're giving us this testimony how many believe god heals god heals god heals by medicine god heals by doctors god heals by music don't worry i got all the quotes right here on that subject god heals by love i'm trying to get some of you to focus focus in god heals it's god that heals god heals with care a little bit of care you talk to someone that is listening to you which we don't do very good at in this generation we want everything fast fast fast drive through you just talk to somebody that actually listens and they're trying to understand that can heal a person you all know that that's what brother branham said in fact it so struck brother branham he said god heals by care that a few days later he preached he cares do you care and then he said the same thing again god heals we all say amen but god heals by different ways so the sister now she's been diagnosed with this condition she she chooses to go into chemotherapy and her husband was very wise about how he handled her he gave her you know we can do this or we can do that we can choose natural nature we can go that way or we can choose and there's side effects there's things that could happen she chose to do the chemotherapy and go that way thank the lord she didn't lose all her hair god gave her mercy and grace for nine months she went through this trial she had to go i don't know if it was daily but several times a week to the chemo place and have blood and things go through her system and have and things and then there'll be certain side effects but by the grace of god she recovered and we sat across the table the other day she's well she's alive but what was amazing talking to the husband he said brother john that chemotherapy place was in our town all these years for years we've drove by that road for years we went by but we never had a need to go in there until crisis strike and a matter until an issue then that address became more important before you would have asked for the address and put it into my gps but after going there two or three weeks now we just drive that we realize our normal course of life was this way but we have to turn in here and go over there oh i say such a pain such a frustration you know i gotta go to work i gotta well friend if you don't do what you gotta do you're not gonna be here to work well i gotta make money or i gotta do this well friends sometimes the lord does things to shake us a little bit get us out of our normal little rut that we live in teenagers get in a rut people in their 20s get in a rut in their middle age elders in the message can get in a rut i'm just asking the lord right now how much i should say because in the world we have what's facing a lot of elderly people is dementia and alzheimer's and you can get to where a person you look at them and they used to be strong and responsive and interacting and they know you we're family we're believers but because of time and matters you walk into the room and they don't even know you you can go away for a week and you fellowship with them you shook their hand and you come back and it's like they don't even know you it's like we never even shook hands or talked and it's like it's sadness you see a person degrading from being like a flower and being so wonderful till they just become so unresponsive just a dull stare they just lose they just sit there and they wheel them out or they're laying on a bed of affliction it's very sad it's called dementia alzheimer's my grandfather had it and many times you can go he walked and walked and walked he was vibrant exercised and then it came to a place they couldn't care for him any longer in the home you do all you can as family then you can't take care of their personal needs then they go into a facility it's like brother john they were at the top of their class or they were in the service or they did this in life but now look at what's happened they've lost their minds i'm not so much focusing on the natural i'm thinking spiritually how many among us even have lost their minds spiritually spiritual dementia amnesia spiritual alzheimer's i took the liberty to talk about that i hope you're not offended but it can affect the elders and the older ones in the message and they're projecting it to be a certain way and it's not working they really don't know what to do and how to do it for this hour yet it seems like they have their body functions it seems like they're in the position it seems like that sister or their brother they might even write ties or offerings they might try to make their life happen but they are broken oh jesus why does the lord lay these things on a minister's heart i think it's for the people i believe it for us to recognize god help us if there's spiritual dementia or alzheimer's in our midst lord jesus we've got to suffer with one another through these times and bear with one another through these times even in your youth when you feel so strong naturally but spiritually you can be totally with a heart issue that's got your heart and satan has got your life and your spirit and your life that's why you don't have the will and the passion for christ satan is trying to choke out the the lifeline to your heart and god today is trying to set that free and put a splint in there so you can live and walk and breathe breathe that's why the bible says jesus breathed on them and gave them a promise receive ye the holy ghost it wasn't his breath it was a promise brother branham said and they went up to pentecost and received the holy ghost it's not so much immediate it's what happens afterwards really shows whether you got the revelation lord don't just give me an emotional experience where i'm under the charisma of the preacher or the meeting or the songs but give me a desire lord give me a hunger that when i'm all alone i want to seek your faith i tell you friends the first five minutes after the rapture happens people that knew about the lord will haunt them why they didn't respond to the word they will long for meetings like this they were long for an atmosphere they were long can you imagine the rapture happening and someone missing the rapture the holy spirit lifts off the earth they will never have that again until the white throne judgment the presence you felt this morning brother steve let us in worship sister julia sang our brother prayed now we're hearing the word the presence that you feel right now comes from god nobody's forcing you no one's manipulating your mind no one's taking your money i'm not abusing and tormenting your mind i pray you're not taking it that way the presence that we feel right now has enough power to heal you there's enough dynamics and what where the atmosphere right now is to change your mortal body the word you've been feeding on ha the chemistry of it there's power in that enough to cover the multitude of sin all your past life as though you never did it in the first place it's because you're hearing thus saith the lord i give you life i give you healing i give you joy i give you peace i give you the holy ghost not as the world give i unto you but we give you peace that will last forever long after the meeting long after sunday into monday into tuesday there's a presence of god there's an atmosphere there's something that touches your heart aren't you thankful for that sister that i just gave a testimony of that she was delivered of cancer but it was a process i would say it was a miracle but a miracle is usually instant and happens so would you accept a healing god heals that's that's why i'm focusing on that someone texted me the other day i was literally thousands of miles away and and we had already counseled them and there's a serious situation and i just asked them would you be willing to take them a healing because they said outside of a miracle i need a miracle and i agree i'd love it to be over just like that i don't want their pain and their breaking that's going on anymore but i just felt to ask them would you be willing to take a healing if god don't do it immediately but you've committed it to god are you willing to take a healing i wonder if that was you on the other hand if you got so upset and brother john you do i want this over i want do you know understand what happened to me well we did because we'd spent hours with him i'd love it to be over i'd love the brokenhearted and the contrite for it to be over like that but any heart doctor knows and i have it right in front because i was sitting in the service the other day just over here and i had it just in my heart how long does it take for a heart surgery does anybody in this room know i know we have nurses and seeing it how long does it take to do a heart surgery i begin to think about that because we are an age that wants everything like this we starbucks drive through mcdonald's we will drive we want it now yesterday well when would you like this yesterday that's why i'm asking you when do you want this file yesterday all right i get what you're talking about and you get anxious and you get everything's now and everything gotta have it and all this puts pressure on the mind puts pressure on the body and on the spirit and we're not careful it'll break you i'm talking to good christians today some of you have served the lord longer than i have but it will break you if you're not careful brother branham goes on to say here in the same message that you are a triune being of soul body and spirit and these forces that work in you work in your mind and your spirit and he said the natural mind it might be highly polished and want to achieve things by intelligence but there's a spiritual person inside of you and that's what causes the trouble right there you try to make it out in yourself this is victory day 1963 if you really want victory he said you're made up of body spirit and soul and intellectual and if you're not careful he said you try to work it out in yourself and there's what causes the trouble the doctor's in amen hallelujah the doctor's in i just had to give an announcement the doctor's in the doctor's in how many of you've gone up to a place of business and establishment and it'll say closed or we'll be back at two o'clock and you look and it's 2 30 it's like nobody's there the lights are on but nobody's home it's like some people you know they look the lights are hello i wonder spiritually how much spiritual dementia and spiritual alzheimer's hello hello hello bride we ought to be way down the road and a lot further and then sometimes we feel like we're back in kindergarten again do you know why it's a heart trouble it's a heart condition i didn't say dementia or alzheimer's was a heart condition i'm trying to speak to you spiritually some things we're going to move over to tonight if that's okay so some of you that don't come tonight well i'll give it to you a little more this morning let's have a little bit more medicine i don't want that medicine was any of you all like me when you were little you didn't want to take pills you didn't want to take medicine this is good for you you really need this and mom would take two spoons and i had acne i had horrible acne i was a young person and i had acne all over pimples and and mom

learn i shut this off and i take this certain thing friend i'm being serious you say it's all spiritual it's all spiritual well there could be a lot of things in the church remedy if people would just do what the world is saying turn the device off drink more water eat a little bit better food exercise move around you say oh brother john you're preaching psychology well that's not psychology that's the lord trying to get some of your attention if you don't want this certain address where you've got to turn and go off and you better just it's out of the matters of the heart i was looking for something and i just found it do you all know what state we're in today what state are we in are we in texas what state are we in y'all go to another state to vacation brother steve just came back from congo it's another it's across the ocean you say where are you living say i live in texas i live in washington i live in alaska i live in florida but what about the state of healing because many people they want to visit they want a holiday in a certain place they want to go to a certain country a certain state a certain island and they say i want they go there and then they come back is that true but where do you live i'm asking you today spiritually where do you live it's not texas it's not what it's not florida it's not america i'm asking you what state are you living in i'm speaking spiritually i'm inviting you to come to the state of healing and live there don't just visit we talk about happiness we talk about joy we talk about peace and the state of rest the state of rest what state do you live in man some of us need to pack it up and move to the state of rest move over to the state of perfect love and i want to just shock you you don't have to move out of texas if that's where you live if you live in another state or if you live in europe somebody might be streaming from europe you don't even have to get a passport just come on over the water's fine come on in serving jesus is fantastic you know if you follow football stars or basketball stars and all their earrings and their tattoos and their divorces and their adultery and all the nonsense if that's how you want and what you want to feed on that's what you're going to get turmoil trouble strife well i didn't know that about bill gates well now you do he's arrogant tough to live with commits adultery you're quiet right now but why do you want to live there why do you want that you say i don't well come on over where there's peace come on and live in the land of the holy ghost where there's happiness where there's freedom i'm being serious today where do you live it's got to become practical what we believe i was in south carolina a few weeks ago is this okay testimony time i was speaking to young people i was it was a youth meeting i think there were 23 different churches represented then just packed out it was hot it was hot in the building it was 82 degrees the thermostat was over here and friday night brother jackson it was hot but we're preaching preaching families had come young people had came they're trying to minister to young people but for about 45 seconds or a minute i just said something about a broken heart i just made a comment about a broken heart and if you are suffering today from a broken heart there's healing for you it was just about 45 seconds or a minute after the service and later they fellowshipped and they had tents set up outside all the visitors and people are fellowshipping there came a brother over i've known this brother for many many years before he was even married now he's been through trouble and then married he brought his young people from hours away to the service so his young people could benefit his eyes began to well up he began to just speak to me said brother john before the service the pre-service i came in early and i was thinking about what i had gone through because he's been raised in the message a preacher's kid we'd say he was pastor son father ended up leaving the message mother ended up leaving they separated this young man married someone and it was not good and the relationship went bad she'd been raised in the message but it didn't go good he's thinking about this before the service it's a young people's meeting it'd be like this family's sitting right here and you got boys and you got girls and you he comes in a little early and he's praying to the lord about and he said lord my heart's broken i'm broken i you seek my fam spiritually my family my parents it's like i'm broken can you just speak to me and his eyes begin to well up he said brother john when you said that about broken heart god heals a broken heart his eyes begin to well i say god speak more to us like that answer the prayers of our people don't let us become so stubborn and churchy and into the form that god can't talk to the matters can the church say amen let me give you another testimony we came through the whole weekend of meetings my it was just fantastic one of the leading sisters of the team i'm leaving my notes now but months earlier her family was just teenagers and the things that go on and the struggle the lord just inspired her with a scripture i will restore will restore till she just started to write that all over all kinds of little sticky notes little post-it notes i will restore put it on her bathroom put it in the bedroom put it in the teenager's room put it in all over the house i will restore i didn't know none of this we came to the meeting and the very first service opened our bible god had laid it on our hearts to speak out of joel i will restore all the years that the cankerworm pomera worm locust has tried to eat away at your life but the holy spirit is here to minister to you and give you encouragement i will restore his vest saith the lord he's saying but brother john i'm looking out in the field and i see three and four and i can't read it no friends it's god's change in your heart the word doesn't change the binoculars ain't good friend it's god focusing you in it doesn't matter what it says out there it's thus saith the lord can you receive that right now just take the medicine take it in i'm i'm squashing it for some of you i'm trying to get it down to where you can see it didn't change the situation her family was in chaos teenagers and young people coming up to this but to hear now it was laid on the heart of the visiting minister that didn't know nothing and the minister got up behind me and said brother john doesn't know this but her name was sister rachel months ago and then weeks ago she got this inspiration put it all over her house i will restore and when brother john read that scripture and that was his opening scripture i'm here to tell you the lord's gonna is doing something in that weekend can you imagine what that would do to you god just to expose everything and say i am here to minister to you and your children somebody say praise the lord it's dealing with the heart of the matters he can deal with all kinds of matters it's not he's not a one just one per he can deal with young middle-aged old people that don't go to church people that's been in the message you could have walked in here off the street today god can just talk to you so now we went friday saturday sunday we're late sunday night and some of the workers had all got together all the team we were just given testimony it was in the evening time and now we're all given testimony people's crying we're weeping well there was a young lady that was there can i give this testimony she was one of the ones that was on the front lines working to help provide we were in her home that night given testimony but she reached back into when she was a teenager she was also raised in the message and also a minister's daughter but a 16 year old 16 year old young lady just fighting for her life she she didn't have her heart changed yet she's just fighting and she got to such a desperation she started cutting herself have you ever heard of that a person starts cutting themselves and a lot of times it's young ladies they get into such a place of despair it doesn't make sense i'm confused why is this happening her father's a minister she goes to church might as well just leave your comfort zone for a little bit it doesn't matter if it's a message church things go on all the time you might as well just put your little wings aside we're talking about human beings it's not heart disease it's sin disease and here it is she's cutting herself nobody knows she is going through this trouble she is trying to grow up and she starts cutting herself in private but one day she even i'm reading she said i wanted to die i've got the original note because i reached into my little bag and i started writing this as she was saying she said i wanted to die she became vulnerable depressed the demon spirit just started squashing her but thank god god met her one day she gave her heart to the lord she's totally changed but she had scars she had scars she's so embarrassed now she tries to go to church she said i want to praise the lord i want to lift my hands but she wore a long sleeve sometimes sometimes it was very very warm i'm going back to march april she's very is very very warm so maybe short sleep she said i can't raise my hand i got so many scars i'm embarrassed that what i even went that low in my life i wanted to take my life and satan wasn't allowed to go that far so it's attention it's just i want some it's a cry for help what anybody does anybody even care or are you just always going to preach about the mysteries and the deep mysteries when we got people right among us that have serious heart issues a 16 year old cutting herself depressed but after she's changed and now she's at a youth camp some of you know this testimony but this is the person this is the young lady now she's married and has children but she's given us this testimony it was her now she's in louisiana camp and she's just with hundreds of other believers and hundreds of other saints and young people some of you have been there and just the glory of god and she said lord i want to i want to worship i want to praise but i'm so embarrassed of my scars and what i've been through but finally she just broke through and said lord i'm going to raise my hands anyway she just stood and began to praise and worship god throughout that glorious service and then when she this is the supernatural part when she brought down her arm she looked and all the scars were gone they were gone god not only deals with the issue he'll deal with the scar and a scar on your life means that you've gone through something but it didn't take your life it didn't destroy you stop talking about the scar stop talking about how bad it is stop talking about somebody done somebody wrong song stop talking about your childhood that was so this and your marriage that and i was hurt stop talking about that focus in focus in i'm giving you some binoculars i'm giving you some aids today look to the promise look to the word love never fails it's a neglect of love why there's so many breakages and marriages it's a neglect of love why there's separation in churches that's a a quota brother branham it's neglect of love i didn't say he didn't have love it's neglect say but i love that person i i love it's neglect it's pushing it aside it's i don't have time for this i'm so bored it's an attitude yet you'll watch a two-hour movie and eat popcorn and snack on whatever and it just goes by like that in the presence of god and the word of god you're so bored you know why it's a heart problem you get somebody that's real passionate about something it's like an hour goes by hour and a half goes by it's like well tim you're gonna close what do you mean they're connected yes help us lord help all of us lord we need more of a taste from heaven we need more ladies that among us that even when they have children now and even teenagers they'll be willing to give a testimony this is what mommy went through this is what daddy went through and it's not always glory hallelujah happy times it's a mother a father an elder that's willing to brush the dementia side the amnesia aside and say this is where i was too and the same god that helped me deliver me filled me is here for you it's a person that's willing to jump down in the trenches and get dirty and be willing to be misunderstood the bible says in galatians the foolishness of preaching in other words the preacher became like a fool so that the people could see christ oh my then lord help us to find that channel lord and i spoke to the group you know because we all want to hide our past and don't tell our young people that we actually went through those things too i actually had to speak to them and say that's what you should be doing is actually being open and confessing to them mommy went through that too daddy went through that too stop stop portraying it that we're all superstar faith heroes hallelujah we we don't live on the mountain it's in the valley he restores our soul it's in the valley where fruit is growing it's in the valley where rugged men and rugged women meet god face to face in sacred sands what they are in the private comes out public and you think meetings like this or services or meetings where god touches you that it just happens like that and oh when i get out here then i'm just going to preach a man no no no it's it's thing and life experiences that god are you gonna go have heart surgery with someone that's never done heart surgery before you're gonna have someone talk about a delicate matter that doesn't they've read a book but they've never gone through it come on well i googled it on google so i can do this is that who you're going to have do a heart transplant on somebody no you want to have somebody that's been there they know these arteries let's move this vein aside the scalpel's got to come in there you know i'm going to grab the sword of the word and go in there brother bless god hallelujah just sit down and be quiet [Music] so many people are arrogant in the pews because the ministers are get arrogant and preach elitism and they speak you know condescending and then it becomes an attitude in the church friends you don't want the spirit of the preacher you want the holy spirit we don't just want the heart of the preacher we want the heart of god and i'm not saying that negative i'm a minister you want more than brother john we need jesus he's dealing with the heart of the matters that i know nobody knows but jesus and me and maybe some but god spoke to me i'm just going to prepare you for tonight because on the outside it might all look good there was a woman that was a sunday school teacher her husband was a deacon everything looks good for years but she's nervous going to psychiatrist financially they're trying to and they come before she comes before brother branham brother adam had prayed for her more than one time he said if she would have come on the platform i just would have laid hands on her prayed and let her go but now he's face to face with her and she's troubled we're going to get into that tonight brother branham goes back into her life and said it's something that happened years ago between you and another person oh she screams she faints she says don't tell nobody that he said that's your trouble he said no psychiatrist would ever pick that up he said you can scream shout praise pray pour a gallon of oil on her head won't do nothing there's unconfessed sin in her life oh brother branham don't tell nobody well there's your trouble and then brother branham's busy there's somebody in the next room that's got a need they've driven here and she said brother branham gets up like he's going to leave i got to go are you going to leave yeah there's other needs i've told you what you need to do you need to go make that right i've got three children brother branham that would break up my home well and then all of a sudden a vision comes and he sees a black man a black a white man with black hair he says oh doesn't your husband have black hair and doesn't he work at the chevrolet company and isn't there a certain woman there and she's wearing a pink dress and oh yeah oh and by the way your husband has the same thing to confess to you not my husband he's a deacon in our church he said yeah and not only three days ago but way back in the war we're going way back when he went up to france he was with a woman and broke his marriage vows and then three days ago they were in a chevrolet car gives the color green and it's dark outside so they have lights on and they're coming through and i see he said i see a great big light and he said it's almost a train destroyed their car he said you got go make it right she goes and meets up with him i'm giving you the story aina some of you aren't going to be here tonight you know what happened she confessed everything to her husband and said i'm sorry then she started saying what this woman at your work and a pink dress in a certain color car and he's like the husband who you been with how do you know this and brother and she told her husband about brother branham and she and he said honey that's absolutely right i'm sorry i'm wrong will you forgive me brother branham said they made up and and the man said let's continue to raise our children and raise our family see there wasn't a breakage it was how it was handled it was the confession it was being honest that's right it's being open and saying i am wrong then let's raise our children and our family and they come back to brother branham tears streaming out of their face praise the lord it's not just to expose the problem it's to have the remedy to what we need to do and friends today you know yourself we all know ourselves it's not great big thing to expose the problem it's now what is the answer what are we going to do about this that's the heart of the matter so it's not talking about being a sunday school teacher and being a deacon and talking about how good you sing and talking about you've been in the church that's not gonna it's not pouring a gallon of oil on her head and he says not screaming and shouting no it's going to the heart of the matter how many believe that today that same lord jesus is in this building right now the same angel of the lord and the same gift knows everything about us you don't need to be embarrassed we're all on the same journey we want to make it out of here but what needs to happen is we need to focus and draw our lives into an atmosphere where we're willing where we're willing to do whatever it takes and i say god put in a new heart put in a new spirit i don't want the old heart made over and this and that and lord jesus i can't walk out of here with the same attitude you know what how i can say that is a prophet said that and standing in the gap he said would you pray for me i've lost my feeling for the people you pray for me that's how we can be so strong this morning and confident even in our weakness is because we've had a good example of a man that would be willing publicly to say would you pray for me brother would you pray with me sister would this church pray for me wow that's incredible you know what that does for everyone in that church it just causes everybody to go then if our prophet can say that they call it him their pastor then i can be that honest would you pray for me and you know and maybe our musicians will come i don't want you to be distracted it was in in the end of that service that a man sitting right about where this sister is right here he collapsed dead brother way brother branham had talked throughout the service about having a complex and he said brother way you have a complex and throughout the meeting and then brother branham's closing the service you can hear all this on tape and then listen to the night service on flashing red light if he's coming brother branham lays it all out said i'm closing the service i'm about ready to end the meeting and he just collapses and sister way is sitting right next to him and she's a registered nurse and her husband collapses no pulse and his eyes rolled back he's gone right in the meeting his heart stopped brother branham went around there oh brother brown and brother brandon became screaming he goes around and brother branham feels there's no pulse he's gone he said in sunday night service he said well if you're a christian there's no better place to go but in the house of god if it's your time to go amen precious in the sight of the lord if it's my time to go but he just prayed a simple prayer ladies hands on brother way i mean commotion people around us like hey brother branham talks about it even billy paul was like oh about dead people and people have some weird thing about dead people he said they're gone it's just a shell but i laid my hands on brother way prayed for him and the spirit of life he said i felt that come back into him and in the night service brother way is alive he's walking he's serving and the meetings to follow you'll hear brother branham say oh brother way's back there god bless you and he gave the testimony he lived his life wasn't over they they didn't have a funeral service the next next saturday god bless what's your name brother next saturday we're going to have a funeral service for our precious brother that's not the story his heart did not end there and god had other plans god had a future and i wonder today as we close some are spiritually dying they're dead and the holy spirit's trying to breathe life into the matter heavenly father we come to the close of the service and the nurses and the doctors are gathering up the closing articles lord they're sewed up the suture we've done our service we've gone some now minutes through we'll never have the last hour or two of our lives we've breathed our hearts have pumped our minds of thought thoughts our emotions that we've had our spirit has been moving our body has been functioning our souls are has just been hearing the word and responding receiving i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ that you would now take all of our lives i know it's a little sobering may be quietening but as we're wheeled out of the room and go back into our recovery it might take some days or weeks or even months we'll always have that as a memory on that certain day we had a heart procedure but i pray as we've given testimony of a sister in florida sister in south carolina a brother over here testimony after testimony after testimony that there would be courage and faith rise up in the congregation that it's not all over i will restore saith the lord and after that service the brother sent me photos of all the post-it notes on the mirrors on the doors on the walls in the rooms in the bedrooms and the bathrooms in the kitchen on the windows it was a promise of a mother that was crying out oh god i want to see life i want to see your heart beating in my family something's wrong it's not the way it ought to be god there's got to be a message there's got to be a word somewhere to have that put out there in faith and to have you come right behind that after weeks and months go by to meet the very hearts cry to have the very answers the very last service a man that hadn't even been to church it was a relative of one of the believers they he was on drugs he was just spaced out he was just up and down and yet he was an adult they went into his room that morning they got his clothes and got his pants where's your pants we're taking you to church oh god they brought him to the meeting he sat right over by the wall through the whole service he listened he listened it was the last meeting our last time people came forward people prayed we didn't have a great big pool but the very last person i didn't even know this all the details he comes walking down the aisle i want to give my heart to the lord the last person lord you are so mindful of us lord you are so mindful thank you jesus thank you lord oh god we've walked down this road we've been in church services we've been to camp meetings we've been in revival services lord we've even had them at this very building services and meetings special speakers and our local pastor our local associate our associate our associate they're all gone today lord it's just the home folks there's not people out in the vegetable and out in the cars on the radio you don't have to be there you can come on in the invitation you can come on in we didn't know you were gonna talk like this lord are we hearing some of the last messages before you come are we hearing some of the last words of the holy spirit before you come our hearts lord our move today we knelt there in that room this morning the hardwood floor so we got a little pillow off the bed and knelt down i prayed oh god may the same holy spirit fell in the upper room i want to see him working today may the same holy spirit as i listen to brother branham speak once more lord i woke up this morning without it and he was just speaking i just laid there laying what a service i was just in prayer a few minutes later in that room and i said god i want us the same holy spirit that spoke that your prophet to move today this prayer has been answered you have spoken from your heart to our heart and i believe it's more than one or two or five i believe you've spoken to many of us here today maybe if you didn't someone today maybe tonight five o'clock or so you come and talk to us again your mercy you're so merciful your grace lord you just come around another way another person another preacher another song you're gonna get our attention lord you're gonna focus it in one day those three antelope or four is gonna turn into one we're gonna see it the way that it is we're gonna be able to read what it says doesn't matter our age 10 years old 30 40 does it matter our background whether we're a man or woman or boy or girl we're gonna read something's gonna click something is gonna happen in our hearts and that's where it should be happening oh god if it's just been in our minds if it's just we've talked about i have a brother i have a relative i have a sister that really knows the lord but what about you what about you all the matters all the issues of life lord may the heart surgery continue this afternoon as we come back i don't know if brother steve is song leading i don't know the musicians some might have to go i don't know who might not be here we have the now we have this moment before we close before the internet clicks off before those that are streaming exit out or they exit on their little device may the angel of the lord that we heard today knows the secrets of every heart we don't want to just know about the problem every it doesn't take much to say there's a problem would you bring the solution and the answer show us the way reveal your will lord bring us to a place that we don't even want to breathe without you brother branham talked about people doing things same things trotting down and just walking where angels feared are trod and we get so stubborn and stiff neck and think we're so know it all and we got it and i'm just gonna tell you and peace in my mind and we get so like this world forgive us of our sin our real condition our heart condition and put the blood on there and put some bleach on there if there's unconfessed sin in the church would you forgive us and give us the courage to confess it so that we can have a real revival jesus as we bring that example even tonight brother branham said that's why brother johnson could not have a revival in his church he was the pastor because the sunday school teachers in adultery the deacons lived in adultery not years ago in the war but a few days ago there was so much going on yet on the outside everybody's just going to church let us live our lives so that you couldn't come down into our private sector and bring a change change my heart oh god make it ever true let's sing that song brother steve can you just help out change my heart oh god [Music] oh let it ever let us stand today [Music] you are [Music] me this is [Music] [Music] [Music] change my heart oh god you are the potter with all our voices now oh you are the power [Music] this is [Music] make it ever true you are the potter all together now you are the potter oh you are [Music] my mind focus in lord focus in my binoculars now this church has been very well taught and trained at the end of the service we you that are believers examine yourself express your love to the lord if there's something that he's brought to your attention throughout the meeting how many has ever ate food before raise your hand ever drank something say i got lunch brother john i gotta go you've done that before i gotta go you've done that before too [Music] gotta go to work you did you went there before i gotta go talk to my friends some of you gonna go outside and talk for the next 30 minutes you've done that before [Music] true that sister that had that condition in florida and that brother they drove by the address of that chemo center for years they've lived in that town they didn't have no need of that place say i don't have no need of what you say i don't have no need of the church i have no need of until you really need it we need it the lord has brought your attention and drove you by this place he gave you the gps address you came by there let us realize if it's a heart issue we need to keep going back to that place until i'm healed [Music] say i have no need of that brother i just drive right by the hospital all the time i drive by this church all the time i can go i can do what i want to do now you can but the lord has just somehow got our attention today so you that are believers are in the church and it's common you know how to end the service to you that might be a visitor it's unusual for you to maybe hear the lord speak you wonder why your heart has just kind of been moved upon that's the moment just to say whatever's happening i don't know but i want more of it you know i don't even know that preacher i don't even like that preacher and he didn't touch me he didn't lay hands on me but something did and what throughout the course of the meeting something happened in my heart i just want to encourage you that was the lord jesus that was the holy spirit and just learn to say yes okay you talk to me like that if that is you you come back again it's not just an emotion so if you just keep feeling that little nudge and that little it's the lord putting his hand on your life now we're we're at the end of the service brother steve and the nurses are all getting everything ready and the scapulas and all of this and now the doctor with his big glasses and big hat and shield he's maybe taking that off and taking off his gown and that's been brother david mcgary maybe brother billy maybe brother matthew brother ander in the past and they're walking out and we're closing and you got your eyes on them it's not them it's the lord jesus it's the great physician that had his hands on your heart that was doing that so all glory be to god not the minister just as you're just kind of coming to yourself in your room you're just kind of coming out from underneath whatever it was and you reach over i'm still alive i'm still bri just let there be something in your heart of a gratitude thank you jesus lord bless the words that have been spoken bless our time here together i took a little liberty i pray for this congregation and those that would have participated and this afternoon it's very warm outside almost a hundred today maybe 101 or two but i pray that our attention would be on you jesus if we can get a little refreshment and come back for those that aren't unable for those that will not be here maybe some we will never meet again i pray a blessing upon them i pray god's love and god's goodness and even as our brother look through the binoculars and read that scripture your love will never fail just a word just a line just a phrase we're grabbing a hold of that go with us now lord if there's anything i've said or done that would have hindered someone or offended them i pray that you would just take that out of their mind that only the goodness of god it's the goodness of god that leads us this afternoon we give our lives to you and bless your holy name thank you jesus thank you lord hallelujah brother steve just lead us in a song
