[36:55] turn with me we're going to the book of
[36:58] Deuteronomy
[37:09] we're going to be turning to chapter 8.
[37:13] we'll be reading verse 1.
[37:18] through verse
[37:19] 6.
[37:29] maybe before we read the scripture we'll
[37:31] have a word of prayer Heavenly Father
[37:34] Lord God here we stand Lord being led of
[37:38] your spirit to come to the house of God
[37:39] Lord this is your house of correction

[37:58] hearer and speaker Lord that you would

[38:08] Matthews is away ministering we just
[38:11] commit ourselves to you Lord when we
[38:13] leave here Lord we want to have drawn
[38:15] Closer to You Lord more in tune with
[38:17] your spirit and more prepared o God to
[38:21] meet you in that hour Lord and and to be
[38:23] used for your glory and honor in Jesus
[38:25] Christ's name amen
[38:27] amen the scripture says there in
[38:29] Deuteronomy chapter 8 and verse 1 it
[38:31] says all the Commandments which I
[38:33] command thee this day
[38:35] shall ye observe that ye may live and
[38:38] multiply and go into to possess the land
[38:40] which the Lord swear unto your fathers
[38:43] and thou shall remember all the ways
[38:46] which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40
[38:48] years in the wilderness to Humble thee
[38:51] to prove thee to know what was in thine
[38:55] heart
[38:56] whether thou wouldest keep his
[38:58] Commandments or no and he humbled thee
[39:01] and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee
[39:04] with Manna which thou knowest not
[39:08] neither did thy fathers know that he
[39:11] might make thee to know that man doeth
[39:13] not live by bread only but by every word
[39:17] that proceedeth out of the mouth of the
[39:20] Lord doeth Man live thy raiment waxed
[39:23] old upon thee neither did thy foot swell
[39:28] these 40 years
[39:30] thou shall also consider in thine heart
[39:34] that as a man chasing his son so the
[39:37] Lord God chasteneth thee therefore thou
[39:41] shall keep the Commandments of the Lord
[39:43] thy God to walk in his ways and to fear
[39:47] Him amen we trust the Lord will bless
[39:49] the reading of his word you may have
[39:51] your seeds
[39:52] we'll also have you turn in the
[39:55] scripture
[39:57] would take two more scripture readings
[40:00] and I'm just really thankful that the
[40:03] Lord
[40:03] has given us opportunity to stand
[40:07] before you to share our heart with you I
[40:10] know that me of myself I don't have much
[40:13] to offer but I got a promise you got a
[40:17] promise where two or three are gathered
[40:19] in my name he's in our midst amen so
[40:22] we're not looking to a man man's
[40:24] abilities man's inabilities we're
[40:26] looking to God to fulfill his word
[40:31] the scripture also that I wanted to take
[40:33] there is in John chapter 2
[40:41] this is a familiar reading of scripture
[40:44] where
[40:45] they say this is Jesus first miracle
[40:49] in verse 1 it says
[40:51] and the third day there was a marriage
[40:54] in Cana of Galilee and the mother of
[40:57] Jesus was there and both Jesus was
[40:59] called and his disciples to a marriage
[41:03] and when they wanted wine the mother of
[41:06] Jesus said unto him
[41:08] they have no wine
[41:10] Jesus said unto her woman
[41:12] what have I to do with thee
[41:15] mine hour has not yet come
[41:17] his mother saith unto his servants
[41:19] whatsoever he saith to you do it
[41:23] and there
[41:24] were set there are six water pots of
[41:28] stone after the manner of the purifying
[41:31] of the Jews containing two or three
[41:33] farkins apart a piece Jesus saith unto
[41:37] them fill the water pots with water
[41:42] and they filled them up to the brim and
[41:46] he saith unto them draw out now and bear
[41:49] it unto the governor of the feast and
[41:52] they bear it and the ruler of the feast
[41:55] tasted the water which was made wine and
[41:58] new not Winston was but the servants
[42:01] which drew the water knew the governor
[42:04] of the feast called the bridegroom and
[42:06] saith unto him every man at the
[42:09] beginning do have set forth the good
[42:11] wine and when men are all well drunk
[42:15] then that which is worse but thou has
[42:19] kept the good until now
[42:22] praise God what a wonderful story and I
[42:24] believe that we're living in the
[42:26] greatest hour for a believer
[42:29] I believe there's no day like today for
[42:32] a Believer to be sold out serving God
[42:35] giving is all looking Beyond this
[42:39] laodicea and what this world has to
[42:41] offer to press past all the barriers of
[42:45] humanity to press back all of the things
[42:47] of our thinking what we can accomplish
[42:50] what we can achieve
[42:52] and see what God has in story see it
[42:54] this simple simple uh little thought
[42:57] maybe if I would have a subject
[42:59] seemed like the Lord I was kind of
[43:02] um
[43:02] I was I was studying and this is what
[43:04] happens when you get a couple months to
[43:06] really get a bunch of inspiration I was
[43:08] listening to uh
[43:10] uh running from the presence of the Lord
[43:12] I was listening to is your life worthy
[43:14] of the gospel and um
[43:17] you know it's it's so much sometimes you
[43:19] feel torn like which direction to go you
[43:22] know but I trust by the help of the Lord
[43:24] that your need will be met this evening
[43:27] that your pull and receive something
[43:30] from God
[43:31] you know and I'll just say it like this
[43:36] in this great hour what God has done I
[43:39] feel like
[43:41] you know I'm I'm throwing myself out
[43:43] there
[43:44] I'm just letting I'm just gonna let it
[43:46] be what it is I'll just give testimony
[43:49] and maybe we'll start off like that but
[43:51] but this is your greatest hour I'm just
[43:54] going to talk about a little subject
[43:56] about your greatest hour
[43:58] and the scripture says there in
[44:01] Deuteronomy he says that he
[44:04] that he might make thee to know isn't
[44:07] that wonderful
[44:08] that that it's not you trying to figure
[44:11] it out but God is going to do something
[44:13] that he might make you know he's going
[44:16] to reveal himself he's going to reveal
[44:18] his plan to you and you'll know that man
[44:21] doesn't live by bread only
[44:24] you know this this became alive to me
[44:27] here recently in that in another layer
[44:30] when the opportunity to go to Romania
[44:33] come up
[44:35] and I thought my what a privilege it
[44:37] would be to to be able to just cuddle
[44:39] cut away from work and responsibilities
[44:42] uh at the home front and and go to to do
[44:46] a mission oh my you know I've been
[44:48] longing for a long time it's been a
[44:50] number of years since I've been able to
[44:52] go overseas and you know you get so
[44:54] caught up with with we got a mission
[44:56] field right here in our neighborhood you
[44:58] know we got a mission field at work you
[45:00] know so you just press in you got your
[45:02] eyes you know you're working you're
[45:04] doing your part but this opportunity
[45:06] raised in and uh you know we just commit
[45:09] ourselves into the hands of the Lord and
[45:11] I realize that you know in myself I may
[45:15] have been pushing back pushing back you
[45:18] know and and it isn't it something that
[45:21] you know the prophet would teach us he
[45:22] says you're in the perfect will of God
[45:24] when you're overseas doing Mission work
[45:26] with the word
[45:28] hey you know there's no gray area about
[45:30] that and we're looking to find the
[45:32] perfect will of God and here I am I'm
[45:34] going you know should I pray you know
[45:36] yeah I need to pray about this you know
[45:38] and so here I go I'm praying about it
[45:40] and you know the reasoning comes you
[45:43] know that's where the battle comes you
[45:45] know when Jonah see he was given a
[45:47] commission to go and cry out against
[45:49] something and he began to make excuses
[45:52] and he didn't want to face his
[45:54] responsibility
[45:56] I'm wondering if that's some of our
[45:58] condition that we've got things that
[46:00] we're facing but it's in our nature it's
[46:03] in our tendency to shuck our
[46:05] responsibility or to pass it off to
[46:08] somebody else but I realize for me I
[46:10] realize I come Square I'm facing now a
[46:14] reality
[46:15] you know I've I've been tasked you know
[46:18] with heading up a few things and you
[46:21] know have I just already trying to offer
[46:23] up an excuse you know hey this brother
[46:26] you know he can handle the this this and
[46:28] this all the burdens better easier but
[46:31] God calling you to handle the burdens
[46:33] you're facing God's calling you to face
[46:36] it and not just face it alone but face
[46:38] it with the word of God Amen
[46:41] to take it and say you promised it and
[46:44] I'm not going at this thing alone
[46:46] and so
[46:48] that's exactly what happened with me I
[46:50] was
[46:52] putting it before the Lord and you know
[46:54] the whole reasoning thing with work you
[46:56] know my schedule and this and that and
[46:58] the other and
[47:00] I come to realize that um you know as I
[47:03] was praying about it
[47:04] all of a sudden scripture started just
[47:07] coming into my heart and you know don't
[47:11] you love it that God deals with your
[47:12] heart by burden
[47:14] you know he'll put someone on your heart
[47:16] and all of a sudden you just it's coming
[47:18] in your heart and your mind and then you
[47:20] can do you know like I was trying to do
[47:22] and you can push it off
[47:24] you know push it out push it off but I
[47:27] want to encourage us today there's a
[47:29] benefit in facing our responsibility you
[47:32] know when we come face to face with the
[47:34] reality that God has entrusted us with
[47:37] sacred virtues
[47:39] you know he's given us the greatest
[47:41] message that ever dawned Humanity we're
[47:44] living in the greatest hour to ever be a
[47:46] Christian
[47:47] the power of God has been manifested
[47:49] clearly there's there's no Shadow of
[47:52] Doubt what God has done in this
[47:54] generation by the promise of God's word
[47:57] and now we stand here and we're facing
[48:00] decisions
[48:01] and a lot of times I feel like
[48:04] I sometimes just try to make the
[48:06] decision going through what I'm thinking
[48:08] instead of forgetting about what I think
[48:11] and committing it to the hand of God
[48:13] knowing what the word said
[48:15] and stepping out by faith
[48:17] because God is faithful
[48:19] and he's placed something in you you
[48:22] have the potential of faithfulness
[48:25] just to hold to the word of God and
[48:27] watch him bring it to pass
[48:33] you know so as as we
[48:36] put that before the Lord
[48:38] I just um you know it was heavy on my
[48:41] heart because I had kind of my way of
[48:44] thinking that this job was going to go a
[48:46] certain way and and I had it I had it in
[48:49] my control and this is the way you know
[48:51] things ought to be and
[48:53] and uh
[48:55] you know the moment that you set out to
[48:57] do the will of God
[48:59] you have opposition
[49:01] and that's where the test comes and this
[49:04] other message that I'll be pulling some
[49:06] some quotes out of is how can I overcome
[49:09] and you know I realize for us as
[49:12] Christians living in this day there's
[49:14] never been a the greatest hour to be the
[49:16] Christian but there's also there's never
[49:19] been so much demonic powers and Satan
[49:22] pressing us to try to hinder us to try
[49:25] to get us so busy or concerned with this
[49:28] life or to to be caught up in the way we
[49:31] think it ought to be
[49:33] and they're right
[49:35] and so that's what it was it was I was
[49:37] just going through I was like it's got
[49:39] to be this way got to be this way and
[49:40] finally I said you know what
[49:42] and and thank God for a Godly wife I
[49:45] asked her you know I said you know I'm
[49:47] not doing this alone you know and so she
[49:50] had said something that just struck a
[49:52] chord in my heart you know and it
[49:54] reminds me when brother Brown says I'm
[49:55] 55. if I'm going to do anything for the
[49:58] Lord I got to do it now and this urgency
[50:00] started just coming up on me like if I
[50:03] pass this opportunity and accept and and
[50:06] face the reality God's commissioned me
[50:09] he God's commissioned you and so I
[50:12] realized I can't wait another day I'm
[50:14] just gonna move forward just believe God
[50:17] Will Make A Way With the work he'll make
[50:19] a way because more than anything I want
[50:22] the will of God to be done in me
[50:25] don't you want the will of God to be
[50:27] performed in your life and so that's
[50:29] exactly what I decided I said you know
[50:31] what no matter what the outcome no
[50:34] matter how much Trials come my way no
[50:37] matter what the test is around the
[50:39] corner I'm going forward because you
[50:43] know
[50:43] it's one of those things just like the
[50:46] scripture says in Deuteronomy he says
[50:49] he's going to bring it to where you know
[50:51] that God is the one that that
[50:54] man shall not live by bread alone like
[50:58] what my job can do for me and so
[51:01] going out in faith I'll just say this
[51:05] I begin to see how that in doing his
[51:08] will
[51:09] things that seemed impossible when we
[51:11] were coming and traveling the obstacles
[51:15] that we were coming into they seemed so
[51:17] impossible
[51:18] like we were delayed and and then the
[51:20] next one was delayed and we didn't have
[51:22] enough time and just different
[51:24] circumstances but you know what happened
[51:27] God was part in the sea God was making a
[51:30] way you see I believe that God was
[51:33] teaching me
[51:34] as a son he was correcting me and I
[51:37] believe that every son that cometh to
[51:39] God must first be tried and and this it
[51:42] doesn't matter if you've just been
[51:44] serving one day
[51:46] 10 days 10 years it doesn't matter God
[51:49] is still child training us
[51:51] and and we still are growing and God is
[51:54] still revealing we hadn't all got it
[51:56] figured out ain't that wonderful that
[51:58] God still is making us to know him by
[52:01] Revelation by jumping out and saying I
[52:04] don't know how this is going to turn out
[52:06] but I'm just going to go forward because
[52:08] it's the will of God that I go
[52:10] and so as we were going I began to see
[52:13] the hand of the Lord and he was ordering
[52:16] these certain steps and coming in
[52:18] contact with different people and oh my
[52:21] the supernatural just was present and
[52:24] just so real
[52:26] and then I began to realize God forgive
[52:29] me for my unbelief Lord help me
[52:34] isn't that what you want
[52:36] you know I think that we have to face
[52:38] the responsibility sometimes we think
[52:40] we're already assuming a lot of
[52:42] responsibilities that in our nature
[52:44] we've pawned off or or passed by and so
[52:48] that's kind of the thing that started
[52:50] this
[52:52] whole thought
[52:53] you know in it
[52:55] I say this is the age of life
[52:59] you know we're living in a time where
[53:01] God has brought the personal life of
[53:05] Christ available to the believer we're
[53:08] not talking about just justification
[53:12] we're not just living in the days of
[53:14] Wesley of sanctification we're not just
[53:17] living in the outpouring of the gifts
[53:19] amen but now God by a yielded vessel by
[53:24] the cleansing blood of the Lamb to can
[53:26] come and pour himself into you that you
[53:30] can overcome
[53:31] you can overcome your thinking you can
[53:34] overcome your thought about the matter
[53:36] you can overcome what mommy and daddy's
[53:39] always taught us that is contrary to the
[53:41] word I don't know about you but I'm
[53:43] grateful for that
[53:45] I was taught a lot of nonsense
[53:48] I taught myself a lot of nonsense
[53:50] haven't you I mean this week
[53:53] let's be real you know there's the will
[53:56] of God to be we must seek out the will
[54:00] of God for our personal lives we all are
[54:03] responsible when we come into the
[54:05] presence and see God manifested and so
[54:08] come in such a way because the word of
[54:10] God he comes right to our address he's a
[54:13] discerner of our thoughts of our heart
[54:15] and when he comes by our way it's
[54:17] because he wants to he wants to give us
[54:19] a child training
[54:21] because look he wants to hand over the
[54:24] keys and say I want you to run my
[54:26] business
[54:27] you know sometimes we're just living by
[54:29] employee Faith you know oh what does the
[54:32] both say about this but we want to come
[54:34] to a place of maturity where he hands
[54:36] over the keys and says son what are you
[54:38] going to say about it
[54:39] what's your will on the matter and we've
[54:42] been tested and we've been tried and
[54:44] we've had the character shaping and and
[54:47] now we have a The Virtue and the molding
[54:49] of Christ living out in US amen
[54:53] so don't be surprised when you're coming
[54:55] through these different trials and the
[54:57] the enemy of the you know he's shooting
[55:00] those fiery darts at you oh I'm just
[55:03] gonna put my hands in and my heart into
[55:05] the the hands of God
[55:07] I don't understand it when I'm going
[55:09] through it you don't go you don't know
[55:11] what's going on but oh my you can look
[55:14] back you can see you're still here
[55:17] and God's merciful and he's worked
[55:20] certain virtues out in your life
[55:22] patience long suffering you know we have
[55:25] to be patient with God he's working his
[55:27] will out in our lives and sometimes why
[55:30] we want to be way over here
[55:32] you know but God's saying no I got some
[55:34] responsibilities I want you to I want
[55:37] you to take one step at a time with me
[55:39] you know sometimes we get ahead and we
[55:42] stream like I hadn't heard from God in
[55:44] weeks
[55:45] you know it's time to stop and go back
[55:48] say you know what maybe I maybe you said
[55:51] something that I just I just passed off
[55:54] and now I need to readdress this Lord
[55:56] have I faced this reality that you're
[55:59] trying to sanctify me in another way
[56:02] that I haven't given my heart over to
[56:04] Lord Jesus right now I just asked your
[56:08] cleansing by the blood and me putting it
[56:11] under the blood confessing Lord I'm
[56:13] wrong
[56:14] I need your cleansing power because I
[56:16] need to know you in another way
[56:19] Lord I need to I need to have Revelation
[56:21] again because that's the thing that
[56:23] gives us victory over sin that's how we
[56:26] overcome by the blood of the lamb and
[56:28] the word of Our Testimony God I'm wrong
[56:30] but you are right and your word says you
[56:35] put in in your situation what is the
[56:37] word promise for your situations
[56:39] you're sick Lord by your stripes
[56:43] I'm Healed
[56:45] you got you got lost loved ones you got
[56:47] children that are disobedient let's
[56:50] apply the token
[56:58] well I'm thankful to be a Christian
[57:01] I'm thankful that
[57:03] you know I didn't choose him but he
[57:05] chose me because if at the beginning I
[57:08] would have looked and I said I did say
[57:12] not me not me
[57:14] but aren't you grateful that he didn't
[57:17] just stick with what your opinion was
[57:20] he's he he doesn't he's not sticking
[57:23] with your opinion tonight some some of
[57:25] some of us we look down on ourselves
[57:27] but think about what he did
[57:31] when he lived such a life he said I
[57:33] sanctify myself for them
[57:35] he could have had a home he could have
[57:38] had he didn't even have a pillow to lay
[57:40] his head they asked him one time he said
[57:42] Master we want to go to your home and
[57:44] have some fellowship
[57:45] oh you know can you imagine how
[57:48] embarrassing he might have been what a
[57:51] reproach I don't even have a place but
[57:53] he did that he paid that kind of cost
[57:56] that you and I can have a home not just
[57:59] here but he said I go and prepare a
[58:01] place for you that where I am you may be
[58:04] also
[58:09] I just I'm so grateful that this kind of
[58:12] love just doesn't sit there and say I
[58:14] love you I love you I love you
[58:19] and you say well
[58:20] I believe it I sympathize with it but no
[58:24] when you really believe that he loves
[58:26] you do you know what you do you don't
[58:28] look at yourself the same
[58:30] you don't judge yourself the same
[58:32] because if my lovely Lord Jesus loved me
[58:36] so much when I was a sinner
[58:39] and he died for me
[58:43] you know standing there
[58:46] hung on a cross for hours and hours in
[58:51] darkness in bearing our shame
[58:54] in the nakedness bearing our reproach
[58:59] and even tell the whole world shook
[59:03] oh but praise God
[59:05] praise God when that temple veil was
[59:08] rent from the top to the bottom we're no
[59:11] longer bound to the law we're no longer
[59:14] oppressed we have a message of Grace
[59:17] amen we can break out of our own mindset
[59:20] of the way we think and what we our
[59:23] opinions of others in ourself
[59:25] it's time to look into the light of the
[59:28] Glorious gospel and take the
[59:29] responsibility I'm a son of the king
[59:33] I'm here to do his work
[59:36] I don't want to keep carrying on like
[59:38] I've always done
[59:40] today's a new day
[59:42] if there's something that's hindering
[59:43] you tonight
[59:45] you brought some baggage it's time to
[59:48] leave it at the altar say Lord my
[59:51] responsibility is to place this here on
[59:53] the altar that's right and I'm going to
[59:55] say Lord
[59:56] I need your help
[59:58] this thing's been on me for a while but
[1:00:01] I'm going to lay it down
[1:00:03] once I ask you for help
[1:00:05] I know my help coming from the Lord
[1:00:08] and every time the Devil Comes
[1:00:09] whispering to me to take up that old
[1:00:11] opinion I'm going to say my help coming
[1:00:14] from the Lord I've been bought with the
[1:00:16] price it's not in vain that he died
[1:00:23] you know I think that it's a time that
[1:00:26] we should constantly live in Revival
[1:00:29] that's what our messenger taught to
[1:00:32] never let the spirit of Revival die
[1:00:36] we must continually feed on the word I
[1:00:40] like that story about how they just did
[1:00:42] what Jesus told him he said you know my
[1:00:44] hour hasn't come yet but you know what
[1:00:46] they went and filled up the water I
[1:00:49] think God sometimes just simply asked us
[1:00:51] young people old people just go and feed
[1:00:54] on the word of God
[1:00:56] God is the one obligated to turn the
[1:00:58] water into wine it stimulates You by
[1:01:01] revelation
[1:01:02] you know that's when the real Feast
[1:01:04] comes that's where the Real Marriage
[1:01:06] comes is when you're in Union with
[1:01:08] Christ and he can come down and he could
[1:01:10] fill your heart with joy and peace
[1:01:12] knowing that he's in me he's he's
[1:01:14] setting me free
[1:01:17] the bondage is broken
[1:01:20] I don't have to live this way no more
[1:01:23] devil you're a liar get behind me Satan
[1:01:26] you have no part with me
[1:01:30] my God is the ruler of not only heaven
[1:01:34] but this earth right here
[1:01:36] you don't have no right to rule any part
[1:01:39] of my life
[1:01:41] and I'm I'm coming face to face with you
[1:01:44] Satan
[1:01:45] you bluffed me long enough
[1:01:47] and I'm standing here on the authority
[1:01:49] of God's word in the name of Jesus
[1:01:52] Christ you have no right
[1:01:55] I've been bought with the price you take
[1:01:58] your filthy hands off me for the glory
[1:02:00] of God
[1:02:04] and he must flee the Bible says resist
[1:02:07] the devil and he shall flee now don't
[1:02:10] forget the submission part submit
[1:02:13] yourself therefore to God see that's a
[1:02:16] power of the believer is just submission
[1:02:18] I can't do it Lord
[1:02:21] I'm just going to be brutally honest
[1:02:23] God look you that's the first step in
[1:02:26] Christianity is honesty
[1:02:30] do we have the courage to face the
[1:02:33] responsibility that we can't do it
[1:02:35] without him
[1:02:45] do you love the Lord
[1:02:48] he's so wonderful that he loves you and
[1:02:51] he's expressed it
[1:02:54] when he chose you
[1:02:56] showed it when he spread his arms and he
[1:02:59] paid the price that we can come
[1:03:01] fellowship with him and not only
[1:03:04] did he want Fellowship but he wanted you
[1:03:06] to know
[1:03:08] that he's put you he put the Conqueror
[1:03:10] in you
[1:03:12] so now you can go out when you're tested
[1:03:14] and you can look to his example
[1:03:17] you know Jesus gave such a thorough
[1:03:19] example
[1:03:20] because when he was filled with the
[1:03:23] spirit when the the Dove came down and
[1:03:26] it was upon him and John he said there
[1:03:29] he is that's the sign and he said the
[1:03:32] Lamb of God
[1:03:34] that takes away the sin of the world and
[1:03:36] immediately he was sent to temptation
[1:03:39] in the desert
[1:03:41] can you imagine
[1:03:42] when you just started thinking oh I'm
[1:03:44] just things are starting to get in order
[1:03:47] things are starting to go good and they
[1:03:49] Wham
[1:03:50] you're in a test
[1:03:51] Temptations all around you well that's a
[1:03:54] good sign that God's with you because
[1:03:56] every son that coming to God must first
[1:03:58] be tried chasing child trained the
[1:04:02] reason why you're being chasing is
[1:04:03] you're a son and a daughter
[1:04:05] but oh I thank the Lord that he just
[1:04:07] didn't overcome and not share with us
[1:04:10] how to overcome
[1:04:12] isn't that wonderful that he shared the
[1:04:14] example he and he didn't he he just said
[1:04:17] you know what in his great hour of
[1:04:19] Temptation 40 days and 40 nights in the
[1:04:22] wilderness
[1:04:24] and the devil came up and
[1:04:26] you know he just said you're hungry
[1:04:31] brother Brandon called it three major
[1:04:33] assaults
[1:04:36] you know can you imagine when he comes
[1:04:38] assaulting you
[1:04:40] he's already assaulted our Lord
[1:04:44] you know he said you're hungry what he
[1:04:47] you know when someone's hungry
[1:04:49] I mean
[1:04:51] 40 days and 40 nights okay but I'm just
[1:04:53] talking about think about your world
[1:04:55] think about this world
[1:04:57] how many days you think they can go
[1:04:59] without some food before they start
[1:05:02] stealing and what's inside of them
[1:05:04] really starts coming out
[1:05:07] is it not even a week
[1:05:11] I don't know maybe a couple days
[1:05:14] I mean I've tried it I'm like man
[1:05:16] just tough
[1:05:19] but you know after it's fast he hungered
[1:05:21] this was this was no joke this was a
[1:05:24] real temptation
[1:05:26] you know when you're put on a fast you
[1:05:28] don't hunger the moment he got hungry
[1:05:30] now was a great Temptation he said now
[1:05:33] you
[1:05:34] you're hungry it sounds reasonable
[1:05:37] you're hungry turn these stones into
[1:05:39] bread
[1:05:40] oh my I am the bread of life
[1:05:43] you see man shall not live he went back
[1:05:46] to the scriptures
[1:05:47] he said no you'll know that man doesn't
[1:05:51] live by bread alone but by every word of
[1:05:54] God
[1:05:54] amen isn't there something starting to
[1:05:56] well up in your heart I need to live by
[1:05:58] every word of God
[1:06:00] I know that we know this
[1:06:02] but I trust by the help of the Lord
[1:06:04] we're catching a little bit of the
[1:06:06] gravity of our responsibility sometimes
[1:06:08] we just make decisions haphazardly but
[1:06:11] we ought not do that
[1:06:13] we ought to seek the will of God by just
[1:06:16] doing our part filling our pots with
[1:06:18] water by the washing of the water of
[1:06:20] God's word just being faithful to do
[1:06:22] what we're taught if you want to get
[1:06:24] closer to God you read your Bible and
[1:06:26] pray every day listen to a message these
[1:06:28] are the ABCs of our Christian walk right
[1:06:30] amen how many of us really do it God
[1:06:34] help me I'm guilty myself I need to face
[1:06:37] the responsibility
[1:06:39] there's something in you that you know
[1:06:42] and I know that God wants to reveal more
[1:06:44] of himself to us and through us because
[1:06:47] there's a lost and dying world out there
[1:06:50] and not just in our world but this world
[1:06:52] the world of our homes
[1:06:55] our job site
[1:06:58] you know you are the light of the world
[1:07:01] and sometimes just like in the message
[1:07:04] Shalom you know
[1:07:06] there was that that lunar eclipse or
[1:07:09] their soul I don't I don't know science
[1:07:10] very well but you know when the earth
[1:07:13] got in the way of the sunshine then the
[1:07:17] then the Moon
[1:07:19] it obscured the reflection of the Sun
[1:07:22] and sometimes worldliness gets in the
[1:07:25] light of The Shining Light of the Son of
[1:07:27] God in our lives we need to face the
[1:07:30] reality we've let worldliness creep in
[1:07:32] in our individual personal lives
[1:07:36] this is not me speaking this this is the
[1:07:38] word of God
[1:07:40] I am responsible to submit myself to the
[1:07:44] word of God and let God bring the tutor
[1:07:47] and correct me because I'm not only
[1:07:49] responsible for myself God has placed us
[1:07:53] responsible he said to to King King's
[1:07:55] like am I My Brother's Keeper
[1:07:58] what kind of attitude is that
[1:08:01] we're responsible to one another
[1:08:04] you know and so we're not running this
[1:08:07] thing alone
[1:08:08] you know we're in the ship together amen
[1:08:14] are you happy to be a Christian tonight
[1:08:17] to realize that God has given us an
[1:08:20] opportunity in the tests and trials that
[1:08:22] we Face to take us the responsibility to
[1:08:26] fight with the word not against the word
[1:08:29] not fight against the word of God's will
[1:08:31] in your life but fight with the word of
[1:08:34] God against the devil
[1:08:36] he said now
[1:08:38] speaking of in his great temptation
[1:08:42] he took him up into a high mountain and
[1:08:44] he showed him all of the kingdoms
[1:08:47] and he he tempted him and he said
[1:08:50] if you Bow Down and Worship me I'll give
[1:08:53] you all of these kingdoms
[1:08:55] he was trying to get him to Forfeit the
[1:08:59] world
[1:09:01] you know I wonder sometimes when we read
[1:09:04] these stories if we're actually just
[1:09:06] reading the story from the standpoint of
[1:09:08] his position are we personalizing it
[1:09:11] what is he trying to Forfeit you
[1:09:14] hey don't don't take the responsibility
[1:09:16] just forfeit that responsibility
[1:09:19] but see he was trying to get him to
[1:09:22] Forfeit it without the cross see it was
[1:09:25] the joy that was set before him that he
[1:09:28] can endure the cross and there are
[1:09:30] certain things that I believe we gotta
[1:09:32] we got a place before us so that we
[1:09:35] realize you know what we're not just
[1:09:37] getting beat down and we're not just
[1:09:39] going through struggles and trials
[1:09:41] without there being some kind of reward
[1:09:47] in that wonderful that you've been given
[1:09:49] so many precious promises that if you
[1:09:53] will take on at his word and walk in his
[1:09:55] way he's going to show and it's not by
[1:09:57] my righteousness it's because God the
[1:10:00] wickedness is going to be judged
[1:10:02] and God's going to have a people unto
[1:10:04] his namesake amen
[1:10:06] so just think about how he said now to
[1:10:09] he
[1:10:10] that overcomes not she because laodicea
[1:10:13] the age that we're in now
[1:10:16] she had a rebuke coming but there was a
[1:10:19] reward for the individual that's going
[1:10:22] to overcome laodicea
[1:10:25] I will grant to you now these are
[1:10:28] rewards we want to remember when we're
[1:10:31] finding a fight it's not you know the
[1:10:33] devil's picked up and there's all kinds
[1:10:35] of reward programs you buy the groceries
[1:10:37] here you'll get discount on gas you you
[1:10:39] charge here and you get this and the
[1:10:42] devil knows that you're motivated by
[1:10:44] rewards but where did he get that he's
[1:10:46] hybridized and perverted it God has a
[1:10:48] reward for you that those who overcome
[1:10:51] will be Grant to sent with me in my
[1:10:54] father's domain these the ruler he's
[1:10:57] going to have a queen hey man
[1:11:00] I just want to see him rule this Earth
[1:11:03] you know hey it's not going to be
[1:11:06] amazement to me when I see him ruling
[1:11:08] All Nations because he's done ruled this
[1:11:10] and if he can rule this I you know what
[1:11:13] he can do anything
[1:11:15] amen
[1:11:18] I mean you look at yourself in the
[1:11:20] mirror and the impossibility but oh my
[1:11:23] the cleansing blood Hallelujah the power
[1:11:26] of forgiveness to set us free ah and he
[1:11:30] who the son is made free you're free
[1:11:32] indeed Hallelujah
[1:11:35] and God wonderful
[1:11:42] well
[1:11:45] I tell you
[1:11:47] I was going to read some quotes and I
[1:11:51] didn't even know what time it is I think
[1:11:52] everybody's doing okay maybe uh 20
[1:11:55] minutes
[1:11:57] so
[1:12:01] I feel that if I can read a couple of
[1:12:03] statements
[1:12:05] you know
[1:12:06] the the message man running from the
[1:12:09] presence of God I realized that a lot of
[1:12:12] times when God's commissioned us to go
[1:12:14] into all the world a lot of times
[1:12:18] you know we we sh we we fail to take our
[1:12:23] responsibility
[1:12:24] and like Jonah you know Jonah ran from
[1:12:28] the presence of the Lord and so with
[1:12:30] this responsibility you know he began to
[1:12:33] think you know and that's what you and I
[1:12:36] do we begin to think about overthink
[1:12:38] things you know like ah and and Jonah in
[1:12:42] his situation he began to think
[1:12:45] but he wanted me to cry out against him
[1:12:48] you know it's something sometimes when
[1:12:50] you have to call something that's wrong
[1:12:52] out
[1:12:53] you know everybody's your friend and
[1:12:55] you're popular and everything until
[1:12:56] something's done wrong and you can't
[1:12:58] hardly stand yourself yeah I cannot wait
[1:13:01] another minute that person hurt that
[1:13:04] other person in school with such and
[1:13:07] such or whatever you give the example
[1:13:08] how many times we got it on an everyday
[1:13:10] basis stuff's going wrong everywhere
[1:13:13] but you know what God has given us a
[1:13:17] responsibility to cry out against the
[1:13:19] wrong
[1:13:22] so that's what Jonah did he's you know
[1:13:24] he's a Jew and there he's going to the
[1:13:25] Gentiles and he's thinking oh my I can't
[1:13:28] go over there they ain't gonna accept
[1:13:30] this
[1:13:31] you know and
[1:13:35] this is a statement brother Brandon made
[1:13:37] and man running from the presence of the
[1:13:40] Lord in paragraph 46 he says In Jonah
[1:13:45] here was called on on this one of the
[1:13:49] Minor Prophets of the Bible to go down
[1:13:50] to this city and here we find an example
[1:13:54] of us all
[1:13:56] every one of us we always are running
[1:13:59] from something
[1:14:01] we run from trouble we want from
[1:14:03] responsibility we we're all prone to do
[1:14:07] it
[1:14:08] we are we are more prone to run than
[1:14:11] stand and face it
[1:14:13] see we find ourselves running sometimes
[1:14:17] we find ourselves prone to run from work
[1:14:19] we don't want to we don't want to work
[1:14:22] some people just think that they can
[1:14:24] make a living without working but I
[1:14:26] think Solomon it was said that if we
[1:14:29] could find here the answer and watch and
[1:14:33] the Ants and you know the little ants
[1:14:36] they tell if every ant doesn't work and
[1:14:39] lay in that ant doesn't eat in the
[1:14:41] winter either so everybody has to work
[1:14:44] and we've got so many things we have to
[1:14:48] do so much responsibility that we have
[1:14:50] to face everybody's got to face certain
[1:14:53] responsibilities and now if we just go
[1:14:55] down to paragraph 51 he says everything
[1:14:58] is responsibilities and it's so easy
[1:15:01] when responsibilities face us to shrink
[1:15:04] from them
[1:15:05] and we find that marriage is a
[1:15:08] responsibility in all manners even many
[1:15:11] times we find this is hard to say but
[1:15:14] it's true that ministers many times
[1:15:16] shook the responsibility of standing
[1:15:19] true to the word of God when it when
[1:15:22] they're confronted with it they'll
[1:15:23] shrink
[1:15:25] that though they'll shrink that
[1:15:27] responsibility when the true word of God
[1:15:29] is brought face to face with human
[1:15:31] beings
[1:15:32] and we are prone to shrink back until
[1:15:35] the last resource you know we're all in
[1:15:37] the boat
[1:15:38] right we're prone to this this is
[1:15:41] speaking of our human nature you know
[1:15:43] and this is the truth so we don't have
[1:15:44] to make excuses for it this is a
[1:15:46] Vindicated Prophet talking about our
[1:15:49] nature our Humanity we're prone to to
[1:15:52] shrink back from responsibility a if we
[1:15:55] don't have to work I'm just going to try
[1:15:56] to you know make a living you know by
[1:15:59] clicking on and it'll tell me how to
[1:16:01] make a living and then I feel like I did
[1:16:03] something
[1:16:04] but I still didn't move
[1:16:08] I'm guilty we're guilty
[1:16:11] but praise God we're not left without
[1:16:13] help
[1:16:18] you know I had a experience and and I
[1:16:22] don't know if I'll share the full
[1:16:23] details of it but brother Branham and
[1:16:25] the next uh paragraph he talks about his
[1:16:28] nephew and he had a dream and uh
[1:16:31] and he said Uncle Bill was standing
[1:16:33] there in this dream and as you started
[1:16:36] to preach then I woke up and he says
[1:16:38] Melvin he was talking he was Catholic he
[1:16:41] said
[1:16:42] Melvin that don't need no interpretation
[1:16:44] your place is down at the altar do you
[1:16:47] belong at the altar
[1:16:50] and I had a dream that I believe the
[1:16:52] Lord just
[1:16:53] begin to deal with me in that such a way
[1:16:55] you know when we're in Romania
[1:16:58] and uh
[1:16:59] you know I I had this dream and it woke
[1:17:02] up and and I sometimes will have these
[1:17:04] types of dreams but
[1:17:06] I was I was driving and while I was
[1:17:10] driving
[1:17:11] I was you know
[1:17:13] I was going in a hurry and so the things
[1:17:16] that I was passing in the neighborhood
[1:17:17] or however I was going I wasn't really
[1:17:20] observant you know I was just kind of I
[1:17:22] was being driven and I was going in a
[1:17:24] hurry
[1:17:25] and so as I was making my turn
[1:17:27] I took a turn and it got like you know
[1:17:30] there was a lot of cars parked and or
[1:17:32] different things I was noticing but I
[1:17:34] didn't notice all of what was around me
[1:17:37] until I came to a dead end
[1:17:39] and I came to a stop
[1:17:41] and then I realized and I'm at a dead
[1:17:43] end there's no way for me to go
[1:17:46] and so then I looked over at this garage
[1:17:48] and it looked like the garage door was
[1:17:50] open it looked like mechanic tools and
[1:17:51] the guys were working on a car and
[1:17:53] there's uh jack stands another car and
[1:17:55] then I look over here and there's cars
[1:17:57] over here they're on jack stands I'm
[1:17:58] like what is going on I pulled up to a
[1:18:01] neighborhood where the guy's doing
[1:18:02] mechanic work all in the neighborhood
[1:18:05] you know so I began to back up and I was
[1:18:07] like did I just run over a drive shaft
[1:18:09] or what and now all of a sudden now I'm
[1:18:11] like man I got to get out of here this
[1:18:12] guy is going to want to work on my truck
[1:18:14] or something you know but anyway I just
[1:18:16] I started pulling out and then I started
[1:18:17] hitting hitting cars and I I was it was
[1:18:20] dark and I realized I'm bumping into
[1:18:22] this car and this is like not a full-on
[1:18:24] wreck but I mean bumping stuff and as
[1:18:26] I'm getting out I'm like I'm starting to
[1:18:28] bump a bunch of stuff and I'm just I'm
[1:18:31] starting to get alerted and all of a
[1:18:32] sudden finally when I get around I'm
[1:18:34] starting to move and then all of a
[1:18:36] sudden I realized we're living in a time
[1:18:39] where there's cameras everywhere so then
[1:18:41] this this thing started coming over me I
[1:18:44] was like wait a minute you know what I
[1:18:47] can't just leave those cars damaged like
[1:18:49] that and so I realized you know what I
[1:18:52] got to turn around
[1:18:54] and I got to go find those people and
[1:18:56] you know when I turned around and I
[1:18:58] started to face my responsibility I woke
[1:19:01] up and there was a piece over me like
[1:19:02] you wouldn't believe
[1:19:04] and you know what I feel like that's in
[1:19:06] some way the inspiration of what I'm
[1:19:08] trying to share with you when we Face
[1:19:10] the responsibilities of being a
[1:19:12] Christian of this hour I believe that
[1:19:15] you'll have a great peace over you
[1:19:17] matter of fact it was spoken over you
[1:19:19] Shalom God's peace to you and your light
[1:19:22] has come this is the greatest hour that
[1:19:25] we can rise and shine to the glory of
[1:19:27] God but we must take responsibility
[1:19:39] now in paragraph 65
[1:19:43] .
[1:19:49] now when we find these things though
[1:19:51] when we're confronted to come into the
[1:19:53] meeting and see the power of God moving
[1:19:55] and doing things and doing Supernatural
[1:19:57] works and seeing it performed and look
[1:20:00] in the Bible and see it's the promise of
[1:20:03] this hour then when we see these things
[1:20:06] then we are confronted with the
[1:20:08] responsibility to accept it I mean for
[1:20:11] ourselves
[1:20:13] now many times now many people
[1:20:16] sympathize many people say it's right
[1:20:18] but that don't that don't make it what
[1:20:21] that ain't what you're responsible for
[1:20:24] if you're not responsible just to say
[1:20:26] that it's right
[1:20:30] now if a young man
[1:20:32] if he's looking for a wife to be married
[1:20:34] and he he stood a girl and here stood a
[1:20:37] girl that met every qualifications that
[1:20:39] he thought took to make a woman why
[1:20:42] morally she was a queen lovely and oh
[1:20:45] fine personality a real Christian
[1:20:46] something that I think he uh that I
[1:20:51] could
[1:20:51] think of like a me a good wife no matter
[1:20:55] how much I say she's perfect she's
[1:20:58] exactly right she ain't mine until I
[1:21:01] accept her and my responsibility of her
[1:21:04] being my wife and that's the same thing
[1:21:07] the message is you might say I'm right
[1:21:11] it's right this that and the other say
[1:21:15] I'm sympathizing with it I believe it's
[1:21:17] the truth but you've got to accept it
[1:21:19] and you've got to become part of you and
[1:21:23] you part of it you've got
[1:21:25] then it's yours
[1:21:28] amen you know that's a reality check for
[1:21:32] us I believe for me we got to be so
[1:21:35] identified this is mine and I like to
[1:21:38] say because I I was an employee at one
[1:21:40] time and you know when I was working as
[1:21:43] an employee a lot of times I just did
[1:21:46] what I was told and I never really
[1:21:47] considered how much waste or how many
[1:21:50] times it would have to be redone or
[1:21:52] anything but the moment you become an
[1:21:54] owner then you become more sensitive to
[1:21:57] the whole production of things
[1:21:59] you see I believe that God is saying he
[1:22:01] he wants us to come to a place where we
[1:22:04] by our own will by our own reality check
[1:22:07] of God you've placed this into my care
[1:22:09] Lord let me identify with oh I'm a Son
[1:22:13] of God you you've you've placed
[1:22:15] something within me that I can accept
[1:22:17] the responsibility and act as you would
[1:22:19] act
[1:22:20] and grow in Grace and knowledge of our
[1:22:23] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:25] are you willing to face the test knowing
[1:22:28] that he's with you
[1:22:29] and that is in you the scripture says
[1:22:32] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:22:34] that is in the world
[1:22:35] so we don't have to worry about failure
[1:22:38] because he's already come he's already
[1:22:41] overcome for us praise God so there's
[1:22:44] nothing to fear
[1:22:46] you know the the thing is I think
[1:22:48] sometimes what what I get afraid of what
[1:22:50] we get afraid of is if I identify then I
[1:22:54] won't have any identity of my own
[1:22:57] which we hang on to
[1:22:59] we have to accept the responsibility of
[1:23:02] being called to the wedding feast
[1:23:05] isn't it wonderful to be invited and to
[1:23:07] accept the responsibility to be a part
[1:23:09] of what God's doing
[1:23:13] my
[1:23:23] and that's the way you are with Christ
[1:23:26] when you see him manifest or made real
[1:23:29] then you're a part of him
[1:23:33] I like that
[1:23:34] see when you see him manifested and real
[1:23:38] made real then you are a part of him
[1:23:42] and he is part of you and all together
[1:23:44] you're part of the message
[1:23:48] now Jonah this is skipping paragraph 70.
[1:23:52] the first part Jonah didn't want to face
[1:23:55] up the thing of going to the Gentiles he
[1:23:59] didn't want to take a cruel message over
[1:24:02] there
[1:24:03] 40 days you'll perish if you don't
[1:24:06] repent he hated to do that
[1:24:09] and he thought them Gentiles is hard
[1:24:12] telling what they'll do to me
[1:24:14] but he had to face up to it see he took
[1:24:18] an easy ship and went down to tarshish
[1:24:20] and went down in the hole
[1:24:22] of the ship and went to sleep he took
[1:24:25] the easy route
[1:24:27] oh my just think about that to know that
[1:24:29] we're living in a time and you know like
[1:24:32] like you've heard the message taught you
[1:24:35] know when the British were coming and
[1:24:37] they were invading and there was a war
[1:24:38] coming you know we're in a battle you
[1:24:41] know the devil's on every corner trying
[1:24:44] to destroy us trying to make us lukewarm
[1:24:47] you know we need to stay in Revival be
[1:24:51] red hot for the Lord
[1:24:53] take your sword and to the Battlefront
[1:24:56] and so you just think about like Paul
[1:24:58] Revere coming in warning warning you
[1:25:01] know there's warning before judgment
[1:25:03] it's our responsibility to warn those
[1:25:05] that there's an oncoming judgment for
[1:25:07] rejecting this message which is Christ
[1:25:11] the the only form of Mercy before sudden
[1:25:14] destruction in this hour
[1:25:16] now I think about
[1:25:19] I don't know if I have it right here
[1:25:23] but you know we know that thou City of
[1:25:26] Angels
[1:25:27] you know and one day
[1:25:30] you know we heard the prophecy that the
[1:25:33] ocean will weep into the desert
[1:25:35] you know when when that fracture happens
[1:25:38] and that land
[1:25:40] just bombs off you know
[1:25:44] um there's going to be a lot of a lot of
[1:25:46] lost lives
[1:25:48] you know and I got to thinking about
[1:25:50] this
[1:25:52] within that line of thinking I was I was
[1:25:55] studying the thinking man's filter and
[1:25:57] brother Branham just drops this nugget
[1:25:59] in here and he says now
[1:26:01] blind Pharisees this is in paragraph
[1:26:04] 144. he said blind Pharisees Jesus said
[1:26:08] and Jesus cried blind Pharisees the holy
[1:26:11] spirit is my in my heart Christ blind
[1:26:14] laid osia
[1:26:16] you see this is the condition of
[1:26:18] laodicea and is trying to swallow us up
[1:26:21] but now brother branham's saying blind
[1:26:23] laodicea how off would have given you a
[1:26:25] Revival but now your time has come it's
[1:26:28] too late now how you how did they laugh
[1:26:32] and make fun of the people that God sent
[1:26:34] to you but now your time has come O
[1:26:37] United States United States how God
[1:26:39] would have hovered of you as a hen would
[1:26:42] it's brewed but you would not now this
[1:26:46] voice is going from coast to coast
[1:26:49] from north south east west how God would
[1:26:52] have hovered you but you would not now
[1:26:55] the time has come nations are breaking
[1:26:58] the world's falling apart 1500 miles
[1:27:00] chunk of it three four hundred miles
[1:27:02] wide will sink hundreds maybe 40 miles
[1:27:07] down into the great fall out yonder one
[1:27:10] of these days and waves will shoot Plum
[1:27:12] up to the state of Kentucky when it does
[1:27:15] it'll shake the world so hard until
[1:27:18] everything on top of it will shake down
[1:27:22] you know there's a shaking coming that
[1:27:25] anything that the only thing that can
[1:27:29] stand is the word of God
[1:27:31] and so everything that's gonna that is
[1:27:34] standing this is a sobriety
[1:27:36] everything's gonna fall
[1:27:38] you know when the Great Earthquake and
[1:27:40] it was dark the world was dark when he
[1:27:42] was on Calvary and they they realized
[1:27:46] that this is the Son of God but it was
[1:27:48] too late
[1:27:49] you see we've been given a commission a
[1:27:52] responsibility to go Tell The World God
[1:27:55] has come he's come in this hour and
[1:27:58] there's Mercy for you but don't wait
[1:27:59] don't wait another day
[1:28:01] don't wait another hour
[1:28:05] don't get caught up in your job don't
[1:28:07] get caught up in your school
[1:28:09] don't get caught up in your problems our
[1:28:11] Gods greater than all of that
[1:28:14] and he's worth giving all he's he's
[1:28:17] worthy to serve now is your life worthy
[1:28:20] to surrender all
[1:28:22] to forget about yesterday
[1:28:25] just turn smooth clean to him and say
[1:28:27] God all of that it's in the past I'm
[1:28:30] starting right now driving the stake
[1:28:32] down Lord will you take me and teach me
[1:28:35] my responsibility that I'll live from
[1:28:37] this day forward serving you according
[1:28:41] to your word and my responsibility
[1:28:48] you know that's a great sub Marine
[1:28:52] quote
[1:28:54] to think that
[1:28:56] we've been revealed
[1:28:58] a truth
[1:29:00] of something a future event
[1:29:03] we have the responsibility of believing
[1:29:05] that's true and adjusting Our Lives
[1:29:08] accordingly God
[1:29:10] I need to be more willing to give you
[1:29:12] all
[1:29:12] you know sometimes it's just God's
[1:29:14] asking are you willing
[1:29:16] that man that he said about his boss he
[1:29:19] said I want that I want what you got he
[1:29:21] said well you can't get it here you got
[1:29:23] to go over there to the pig pen
[1:29:24] sometimes we're just unwilling
[1:29:27] to give it the way God wants it
[1:29:30] but amen you got the potential and
[1:29:31] that's why we go through these trials
[1:29:33] that's why we go through these testings
[1:29:36] because God's proving that you're a son
[1:29:39] and you're a daughter
[1:29:41] don't look to your failures of yesterday
[1:29:43] look to the promise God you're my help
[1:29:48] God you're my provider you're my need
[1:29:51] meter you said you would lead me and
[1:29:54] guide me and I believe it and now I'm
[1:29:56] under expectation Lord I'm letting go of
[1:29:58] all the Fetters
[1:30:00] the scripture admonishes us
[1:30:02] lay aside every weight and sin that doth
[1:30:05] so easily beset us that we might run
[1:30:08] this race with patience looking to the
[1:30:11] author and finisher of our faith
[1:30:13] amen
[1:30:15] praise God what a responsibility
[1:30:19] you know I just think about this and
[1:30:22] this probably we can invite the
[1:30:24] musicians to come I just figured I'd
[1:30:26] share this last bit about you know
[1:30:29] there's examples in the word of God that
[1:30:31] we can take courage like in in the
[1:30:33] greatest battle
[1:30:35] there was a Peter Cartwright and this is
[1:30:38] uh an example of you know God giving a
[1:30:43] man a responsibility in him fulfilling
[1:30:46] it and I believe this is an
[1:30:47] encouragement to us he says well brother
[1:30:49] and this is um I don't have the
[1:30:51] paragraph number well brother if you're
[1:30:53] a soldier stand there there's a battle
[1:30:56] on right and wrong is engaged let's
[1:30:59] fight oh my who wants to fight against
[1:31:02] wrong
[1:31:03] because you know we see the results of
[1:31:05] wrong in our lives there's people that
[1:31:07] are sick you know someone can come with
[1:31:09] the wrong attitude and cause somebody
[1:31:10] not to receive their healing God examine
[1:31:14] me search my heart oh God see if there
[1:31:17] be any wicked way in me
[1:31:19] amen are we are we getting serious the
[1:31:22] hour is late my brothers and sisters God
[1:31:25] has cleansed us so that he can use us to
[1:31:28] move forward to carry out our
[1:31:30] responsibility amen he's empowered us
[1:31:32] with all of his blessings
[1:31:36] my
[1:31:37] my like Peter Cartwright he went into
[1:31:41] the City and said Lord told me to come
[1:31:43] in here and have a Revival
[1:31:47] and and he rented an old store room
[1:31:50] and got in there and began to clean it
[1:31:52] up
[1:31:55] I believe God's giving us
[1:31:57] he wants us to have a Revival and he
[1:31:59] wants us to do some cleaning up
[1:32:02] you know but there's a bully in town
[1:32:06] you name your bully you can have no
[1:32:09] Revival here you ain't gonna be no
[1:32:11] Revival there you lying devil
[1:32:17] and he shows his pistol
[1:32:20] see I got Authority I can take your life
[1:32:25] and he walked down and those doors and
[1:32:27] someone said what's that guy doing down
[1:32:30] here
[1:32:31] said he's a preacher
[1:32:33] he's going to have a meeting he said
[1:32:35] well he said I guess I just have to go
[1:32:38] down there and throw him out in the
[1:32:39] street and run him out of here that's
[1:32:42] all we don't have no meetings around in
[1:32:44] our place so he does he goes down there
[1:32:48] and he's and he stops at the door and
[1:32:50] Peter Cartwright has his coat on and you
[1:32:53] know he was just washing windows and
[1:32:55] walls down and little bitty fella you
[1:32:58] know the preacher laughed
[1:33:00] the preachers laughed at you know for
[1:33:02] eating chicken with his hands which is
[1:33:04] etiquette today you know so he was just
[1:33:07] washing windows fixing around
[1:33:10] we're getting orders for our
[1:33:12] responsibility we're going to be washing
[1:33:14] with Windows and fixing things out
[1:33:15] getting right with God and pulling out
[1:33:18] the bleach of the blood and and confess
[1:33:20] our faults one to another
[1:33:23] because he's faithful amen and so as
[1:33:25] he's doing this the big bully walked
[1:33:28] over and pulled his his coat back and
[1:33:30] showed his pistol hanging on the side of
[1:33:32] what you doing
[1:33:33] you know the Devil he's got to say his
[1:33:35] bluff
[1:33:36] you know he's got to have his voice
[1:33:38] because you got to be tested to take God
[1:33:41] at his word and look at that Peter
[1:33:43] Cartwright he says oh I'm just washing
[1:33:46] windows
[1:33:47] I'm just doing what God's leading me to
[1:33:50] do
[1:33:51] he says he just kept on washing windows
[1:33:54] you know I got one purpose God told me
[1:33:56] to hold a Revival and washing the
[1:33:58] windows down he said
[1:34:00] we don't allow revivals around here he
[1:34:03] said oh oh but God told me to
[1:34:06] to hold this revival
[1:34:09] there's no there's no question
[1:34:11] I'm sure of God
[1:34:14] you know I'm not ashamed of this gospel
[1:34:16] I'm sure God told me I would have a
[1:34:19] Revival that what is wrong the the bad
[1:34:21] place in Me God is going to cleanse and
[1:34:24] I'm going to be set free
[1:34:26] amen he says now keep
[1:34:29] he just kept working on right see and
[1:34:32] there's one thing that you have you have
[1:34:35] to understand

[1:34:45] you have a Revival you'll have to whoop
[1:34:47] me first he said oh I do well I'll just
[1:34:51] do that next then he took off his jacket
[1:34:53] and went down and reached to him by
[1:34:56] reached by the collar and knocked him
[1:34:57] down on the floor and started jumping on
[1:34:59] top of and he said if I must fight if I
[1:35:02] must Reign increase my courage Lord and
[1:35:05] He pounded the tar out of him and he
[1:35:06] said you got enough
[1:35:08] he said yes he got up and shook his hand
[1:35:11] and got saved that night in church there

[1:36:16] empower us to have power over the
[1:36:19] influence of the devil and the results
[1:36:21] of sin in our lives and now we can let
[1:36:24] it just come and we can come subject to

[1:37:20] mistake I was willing to say that I
[1:37:24] didn't apply the word like I ought to
