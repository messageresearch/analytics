[11:56] to us Grant it to us now we ask ask us
[11:59] now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[12:01] amen
[12:02] amen amen you can remain standing I
[12:05] don't think I'd be very long but
[12:12] uh amen there's many many things when
[12:15] you get up here you want to you want to
[12:17] put before the people and try to be an
[12:19] encouragement a blessing and and if
[12:22] anything I would just say
[12:24] hey render this daily in our lives
[12:28] because
[12:29] it's not only the foundation we're we're
[12:33] uh encouraged to stand on but it gives
[12:35] us strength and if you if you'll draw
[12:38] from it he'll provide that strength and
[12:41] uh I uh we're going to read from Psalm
[12:44] 71 this
[12:46] morning but in my
[12:48] heart I was uh rehearsing Psalm 107 it
[12:52] says oh give thanks unto the Lord for he
[12:55] is good for his mercy endureth forever
[12:58] let the redeem redeemed of the Lord say
[13:00] so whom he hath redeemed from the hand
[13:02] of the enemy man it it is a blessing
[13:05] this
[13:07] morning just to count yourself as
[13:09] redeemed amen you know brother Bram
[13:11] taught us not not everyone can be
[13:14] redeemed that's like the dollar it used
[13:16] to be the Redemption was you could turn
[13:18] it in and get a get an amount of gold or
[13:20] silver certificate for that dollar bill
[13:24] we know that's not good anymore it's
[13:26] just the paper is not even worth hardly
[13:27] the the paper that's written on but I'm
[13:30] thankful this morning that there are
[13:31] lives that have been changed that have
[13:33] been renewed and and actually can claim
[13:36] Redemption this morning amen know I was
[13:39] thinking too of uh of old job you know
[13:43] we go through trials and and uh he's
[13:45] been one that we say oh the patience of
[13:48] Job if I could just withstand like he
[13:51] did we look in
[13:53] retrospect job wasn't in on the
[13:57] conversation that the devil the Lord had
[13:59] about job job didn't know the Lord
[14:01] considered him so high and the devil
[14:04] didn't
[14:05] know job's tenacity or his ability to
[14:08] stand either but he was willing to test
[14:10] him and the Lord put him through that
[14:12] test but at the
[14:14] outcome you know job endured that that
[14:17] extreme testing both of mind and body
[14:21] and he was delivered and he was restored
[14:24] many many times over what he had lost so
[14:26] what a blessing to us to look back and
[14:28] say hey
[14:30] the Lord thinks so highly of us even
[14:33] though we don't consider our ourselves
[14:35] very high but he put us right here at
[14:37] the very end of the age where we could
[14:39] endure that extreme testing
[14:42] amen and as Paul said to the Ephesians
[14:45] and he gave them much
[14:46] instruction Masters and students and
[14:49] teachers and even fathers and
[14:52] mothers but the very end of that he
[14:56] says but yet
[14:59] let me turn to
[15:03] it finally my
[15:05] brethren be strong in the
[15:09] Lord and in the power of His might if
[15:14] you look that up that word might is his
[15:16] unlimited
[15:18] ability the unlimited ability we're not
[15:20] standing on our
[15:22] own energy this morning our own strength
[15:24] of our legs we know that'll fail we're
[15:27] standing on his word am
[15:29] man amen let's turn to Psalm
[15:34] 71 this has been a real encouragement to
[15:36] me in the last couple months just open
[15:40] your Bible and read it and say thank you
[15:42] Lord for your
[15:44] word because it's a it's a time of
[15:47] confusion it's a time of
[15:49] wonderment we look at
[15:52] Israel we know it's God's time
[15:55] peace we look at our own lives the
[15:57] condition of our country politics we
[16:00] don't lean on those things or have even
[16:03] a hope that they're going to save us
[16:05] we're looking for the
[16:07] preparation of the ground being laid for
[16:09] the coming of the Lord all these things
[16:11] and all these signs have to come to pass
[16:13] amen amen let's just let's just read it
[16:17] in a way that our understanding might be
[16:20] open

[17:22] enemies speak against me and they that

[39:20] before uh sister chippo and the group
[39:22] comes up all is
[39:25] well my it's because of Malachi 4:5 that
[39:28] we could know him in the power of his
[39:31] resurrection and because we know him in
[39:33] the power of his resurrection there's a
[39:35] there's a place of rest that we can
[39:37] enter in it's it's gross darkness and
[39:39] Chaos for the world and this quote
[39:42] struck my heart uh the prophet says and
[39:45] why are people so tossed about he said
[39:47] the Christian faith is based solidly
[39:49] upon rest that's right a Christian is
[39:52] not tossed about Christian doesn't run
[39:54] from place to place a Christian doesn't
[39:56] fuss or or fume or worry about things a
[39:58] Christian rest it's all over it's all
[40:00] finished for the believer at Calvary
[40:02] that's right oh sickness may come and
[40:04] disappointments but the Christian is at
[40:06] rest knowing this that God is able to
[40:09] keep that which he has performed knowing
[40:11] that no matter what the thing is and how
[40:13] it looks there is neither sickness
[40:15] sorrow death there's neither starvation
[40:18] or anything that can separate us from
[40:19] the love of God that's in Christ Jesus
[40:22] we're at rest Just Let The Old Ship toss

[52:24] in your
[52:26] great love for
[52:29] us uncomprehended
[52:33] love unmeasurable mercy and
[52:37] kindness Lord we find ourselves
[52:42] [Music]
[52:43] unworthy we haven't
[52:47] words in the vocabulary of man to
[52:51] express your
[52:54] greatness
[52:56] but father this morning we come before
[52:59] you once again
[53:01] needy asking that you would speak to us
[53:05] and help us and apply your blood to our
[53:09] lives and forgive us our many
[53:11] shortcomings and
[53:14] failings father we ask that you would
[53:16] encourage our hearts this
[53:19] morning that we may know
[53:22] that in you is where our hope
[53:28] lies we have confidence father that
[53:31] you're capable of doing all
[53:35] things and that there's nothing that you
[53:38] can't
[53:39] do there's no place that you can't find
[53:43] us there's no trouble that you can't
[53:46] Deliver Us
[53:47] from so this morning Father once again
[53:52] look upon our feeble beings father and
[53:57] show your mercy to us we ask it in the
[54:02] precious name of your son our Lord and
[54:05] Savior Jesus Christ amen amen God bless
[54:09] you this morning if you have your
[54:12] Bibles let's turn over
[54:16] to a
[54:18] scripture uh we'd like to read in
[54:21] Philippians we preach from this Qui
[54:25] often uh but I trust it'll be a a a
[54:30] blessing to you we're going to start in
[54:33] the seventh verse
[54:36] and uh if I could uh say this uh this is
[54:42] kind of New Year's and so I just thought
[54:44] it'd be a a little thought of you know
[54:48] approaching the New Year approaching the
[54:51] new year and and I I'd like to read this
[54:54] because because I like Paul's
[54:57] approach uh you know your attitude
[55:00] towards anything and your approach to
[55:03] something will have a great
[55:06] determination on the
[55:08] outcome how you approach it uh it will
[55:12] have a great uh
[55:15] uh result in determination of the
[55:20] outcome so let us just read here and
[55:23] Paul says this he says
[55:25] the seventh verse he says but what
[55:27] things were gained to me I count lost
[55:32] for
[55:34] Christ listen to this great attitude and
[55:37] approach that Paul had everything that I
[55:40] gain I count it lost for
[55:44] Christ yay doubtless and I count all
[55:48] things but lost for the exceeding
[55:53] Excellence of the knowledge of of Christ
[55:55] Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered
[56:00] the loss of all things and do count them
[56:03] but dung that I may win
[56:08] Christ and be found in him not having my
[56:13] own
[56:14] righteousness which is of the law but
[56:18] that which is through the Faith of
[56:21] Christ the righteousness which is of god
[56:25] God by faith that I may know
[56:28] him and the power of his
[56:32] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[56:36] sufferings being made
[56:38] conformable unto his death and if by any
[56:43] means I might obtain unto the
[56:46] resurrection of the Dead not as though I
[56:51] had already obtained neither were
[56:55] already perfect but I follow
[57:00] after if that I may apprehend that which
[57:04] also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus
[57:09] Brethren I count not myself to have
[57:12] apprehended but this one thing I do
[57:16] forgetting those things which are behind
[57:20] and reaching forth unto those things
[57:24] which are
[57:25] before I press toward the mark for the
[57:29] prize of the High Calling of God in
[57:32] Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as
[57:36] be perfect be thus minded and if in
[57:41] anything ye be otherwise minded God
[57:45] shall reveal even this unto you father
[57:50] we ask you to bless your word in your
[57:52] precious name we pray amen amen God
[57:55] bless you may be
[58:01] seated certainly when we come to this
[58:06] time of year uh we look back and think
[58:10] why a whole year has
[58:12] passed and if you're like me it seems
[58:16] like time is going faster and faster and
[58:20] and the days just seemed to roll by and
[58:23] and now we're going to be writing
[58:25] 24 you know I finally put 24 on my
[58:29] checks about in February sometimes I
[58:33] finally get used to it that time has
[58:35] moved on and and as time moves we find
[58:40] out that as we've traveled through time
[58:43] we could uh go back and look at the
[58:47] progression of man from the you know
[58:50] from walking to taming the horse to cart
[58:54] and Automobiles and planes and we're
[58:58] just moving and and we're going uh
[59:03] somewhere and uh and we're traveling and
[59:07] we find out that we're caught up in time
[59:12] and time's moving and all through life
[59:16] people have tried to stop time they've
[59:19] tried to stay right where they're at we
[59:23] have whole groups of people that try to
[59:25] still drive horse and Buggies and they
[59:28] try to live without electricity and and
[59:31] they they try to live in a day gone by
[59:36] because they they uh they don't they
[59:39] don't want uh uh time to go on they
[59:43] don't want things to change they they
[59:46] don't want civilization to advance but
[59:50] uh it's advancing whether we like it or
[59:53] not and and things are changing around
[59:56] us whether we like it or not and and so
[1:00:01] I like the way that uh it was put in uh
[1:00:06] Peter the second chapter uh uh second
[1:00:09] book of Peter and the third chapter in
[1:00:11] the first verse it says perilous times
[1:00:14] shall
[1:00:16] come and if you would continue to read
[1:00:19] that you would find out it lists all the
[1:00:22] characteristics of man and the
[1:00:25] corruption that we find ourselves in so
[1:00:29] it's not it's not uh necessarily that we
[1:00:32] can stop what's happening and we can't
[1:00:35] stop the progress and we can't stop the
[1:00:38] going forward but I think it would
[1:00:41] behoove us to have a
[1:00:43] great understanding of how to approach
[1:00:47] it you understand how are we going to
[1:00:50] get through it how are how are we going
[1:00:53] to f face this next year that set in
[1:00:57] front of us and we don't know all that's
[1:01:00] to come in this
[1:01:03] year I mean we don't know what lies
[1:01:06] ahead but we know who
[1:01:09] does and I think that's the thing that
[1:01:12] we've got to uh bring ourselves to that
[1:01:16] uh we don't have to know everything if
[1:01:19] we know him if we if we can find that
[1:01:23] spot and Paul's talking to here he says
[1:01:27] the thing that we need to I want to do
[1:01:29] is I need to obtain Christ I I I long
[1:01:33] for the power of the Resurrection that I
[1:01:36] might obtain that I might have him I
[1:01:38] caught everything is lost that I might
[1:01:41] have this life this this this uh great
[1:01:48] gift of God to us as we talked up at
[1:01:51] Christmas time how that the gift of God
[1:01:54] to us was was sight was light that we
[1:01:58] could look upon this world in a
[1:02:00] different way than than anybody else
[1:02:03] looks at it a different way that we know
[1:02:06] that something else is going on besides
[1:02:09] what the world is struggling with
[1:02:12] they're trying to struggle with
[1:02:13] homelessness they're trying to struggle
[1:02:15] with the immigration problem they're
[1:02:17] trying to understand the difference in
[1:02:20] politics and Views and it just seems
[1:02:23] like we're living at a day of mass
[1:02:26] confusion and so uh we we truly
[1:02:31] understand that that we've got to be
[1:02:34] able to take on something to be able to
[1:02:38] approach it we've got to take on a
[1:02:40] Viewpoint we've got to take on an
[1:02:42] attitude we've got to take on an
[1:02:45] understanding of how it's going to be in
[1:02:49] order for us to get through what lies
[1:02:52] ahead so I could say it like this we
[1:02:56] know that there's a a storm
[1:02:59] coming we know that it seemed like peace
[1:03:03] and safety and all of a sudden a a storm
[1:03:07] arose it remind me of when Paul set out
[1:03:10] for uh Rome and the they they were ready
[1:03:13] to go and the the sea was calm and the
[1:03:16] wind was southerly and appeared to be
[1:03:20] favorable and so they set sail because
[1:03:24] everything looks okay and everything
[1:03:28] appeared to be just fine and and and
[1:03:31] that's the way it is with us sometimes
[1:03:33] everything seems to be going good
[1:03:35] everything's fine you know we've finally
[1:03:37] got it together and you know we'll be
[1:03:40] able to pay our bills and we'll be able
[1:03:43] to do this and we able to do that and
[1:03:45] everything seems to be all right and
[1:03:47] then all of a sudden a great storm
[1:03:49] arises a great Tempest arises and
[1:03:53] there's a a storm on the sea and and uh
[1:03:57] uh we become
[1:03:59] afraid and and I I like this story a lot
[1:04:02] it means a lot to me that story of the
[1:04:05] great Tempest because there there's a
[1:04:08] part in that when they got into the
[1:04:09] storm they realized that they had to
[1:04:12] lighten their
[1:04:15] load they couldn't go through the storm
[1:04:19] carrying all the baggage that they had
[1:04:23] they they they they they just if they if
[1:04:26] they just they had to get down in there
[1:04:29] and they had to say this this becomes of
[1:04:31] no value to my
[1:04:34] survival in other words something rose
[1:04:37] up in their life that was greater than
[1:04:39] the possessions it was the life it was
[1:04:43] their their their very existence their
[1:04:46] their their survival all all all lied on
[1:04:50] on the decisions they had to make and
[1:04:52] they realized in order to to make it
[1:04:54] through this storm they would have to
[1:04:57] lighten their
[1:04:59] load they couldn't carry the things
[1:05:02] through the storm that they were
[1:05:05] carrying they they had to they they they
[1:05:10] had to realize that oh this this boy
[1:05:13] this is a a great treasure here uh you
[1:05:16] know this is a whatever it might be and
[1:05:19] they say this is no longer any value to
[1:05:23] me because if I keep this I'm going to
[1:05:28] sink and I want us to understand this
[1:05:31] this morning if I could put it a out to
[1:05:36] you that that's what Paul said he said I
[1:05:41] leave I leave those things
[1:05:45] behind and I I just like the way he says
[1:05:49] it he says this he says Brethren I count
[1:05:53] not my s to obtain but this one thing I
[1:05:58] do I forget those things which are
[1:06:02] behind and reach forth unto those things
[1:06:06] which are before so Paul realized that
[1:06:10] he couldn't make it through the Tempest
[1:06:12] he couldn't make it through the storm
[1:06:15] carrying all these
[1:06:18] things and that's I'd like to say to us
[1:06:20] this morning like if we're approaching
[1:06:22] this new year
[1:06:24] that we we've got to understand that
[1:06:27] it's not turning a new
[1:06:30] Leaf it's not doing the same things
[1:06:34] differently or it's not rearranging what
[1:06:38] you do when you do it you know it's not
[1:06:43] saying all right I'm not going to do
[1:06:45] this this way or it's not making
[1:06:48] promises uh it's not just dealing with
[1:06:52] the things that you dealt with last year
[1:06:56] dealing it with a different way you know
[1:06:58] sometimes what we need to do is just
[1:07:01] leave those things
[1:07:04] behind walk away from
[1:07:06] them just walk away leave them leave
[1:07:11] them behind he says I leave those things
[1:07:14] behind I walk away from
[1:07:17] them I I I I press for a higher calling
[1:07:21] in other words I forget the direction I
[1:07:23] was going in I forget what I was doing I
[1:07:26] forget the way that I was I I'm not
[1:07:29] going to be that person I'm going to
[1:07:31] absolutely leave it behind and I'm going
[1:07:34] to
[1:07:35] press for something greater I'm going to
[1:07:39] press for a high calling and and so many
[1:07:42] times we find out that uh that we just
[1:07:46] try to deal with it and we just say I'm
[1:07:50] going to deal with it
[1:07:52] differently or or I'm going
[1:07:56] to I'm going I'm not going to let it
[1:07:58] control me I'm going to control
[1:08:02] it and Paul says I found out I don't
[1:08:05] even rely on my own
[1:08:08] righteousness that's our own
[1:08:10] righteousness but to be able just to say
[1:08:13] I'm walking away I'm not going to carry
[1:08:16] it I cannot make it through the perilous
[1:08:20] times that lie
[1:08:22] ahead I can't be carrying this in my
[1:08:28] ship I can't be carrying this in my life
[1:08:33] because I I'm not going to be able to
[1:08:36] survive the storm and if I can say this
[1:08:39] we we've come to a place that we've got
[1:08:42] to lighten our load we we've got to get
[1:08:45] stuff off of our plate we've got to get
[1:08:48] stuff out of our Lives because there's a
[1:08:50] great Tempest that's lying in front of
[1:08:53] us
[1:08:55] and we can't be
[1:08:57] burdened with the cares of this
[1:09:00] world we can't be burdened with
[1:09:05] bitterness you got to walk away from it
[1:09:08] am you've got to walk away from from the
[1:09:12] hurt you've got to W walk away from the
[1:09:15] wrongdoing yes you were done wrong yes

[1:09:21] were
[1:09:22] wrong yes yes it's terrible what they've
[1:09:26] done yes they deserve to be
[1:09:30] smittened but the trouble is you can't
[1:09:34] survive the perilous times that lie
[1:09:38] ahead having that in your
[1:09:42] boat you won't make
[1:09:45] it you've got a light in your
[1:09:48] load your heart can't take it your mind
[1:09:52] can't take it you've got to come to the
[1:09:55] place sure you made a failure sure you
[1:09:57] made mistakes sure you you're a terrible
[1:10:02] person sure the person in the mirror is
[1:10:05] not what you who you want to be but you
[1:10:08] can't carry that with
[1:10:11] you you won't be able to survive the
[1:10:16] future all I know I don't know what lies
[1:10:19] out there but this will become a burden
[1:10:22] to me
[1:10:24] right I've got to lay it behind I've got
[1:10:28] to get it out of my boat I've got to
[1:10:31] walk away from it you can't fix
[1:10:36] it and rearrange
[1:10:39] it and paint it and try to take a
[1:10:43] different mindset to it or a different
[1:10:46] attitude towards it and still carry it
[1:10:51] you can't carry the burden or the load
[1:10:54] with a new
[1:10:55] attitude you've got to walk
[1:10:59] away that's what Paul said I walk away I
[1:11:02] lighten my load I take this out of my
[1:11:05] mind I take it out of the picture of my
[1:11:08] life I I to I totally get rid of it I I
[1:11:12] totally forget it if I could say it like
[1:11:14] this you leave it on the
[1:11:19] dock and you say I can't make this
[1:11:22] what's ahead right with this in my
[1:11:27] life I'm not going to paint
[1:11:30] it I'm not going to adjust it I'm not
[1:11:34] going to restack it I'm not going to say
[1:11:37] well maybe I can make room here by
[1:11:39] moving this here and this there he have
[1:11:42] you ever moved and you put the stuff in
[1:11:45] the truck and then you take it all out
[1:11:47] and you repack it you know what I mean
[1:11:50] because eventually you're going to try
[1:11:52] to get everything fit in in there uh so
[1:11:54] you can take it
[1:11:57] all this isn't a time for
[1:12:01] that this isn't a time to
[1:12:04] rearrange this isn't a time to repack
[1:12:08] this is a time to lighten the load to
[1:12:11] get rid of your
[1:12:13] burdens to walk away from
[1:12:16] them cuz there's a new life that's ahead
[1:12:20] of you you're pressing for something
[1:12:24] that you've never been you pressing to a
[1:12:26] place that you haven't experienced God's
[1:12:29] got things for us that we haven't even
[1:12:31] tasted yet it hasn't even entered into
[1:12:33] the hearts and the minds of man the
[1:12:36] things that God's prepared for him but
[1:12:38] there's one thing that you've got to be
[1:12:40] certain of is that you won't be able to
[1:12:43] get there carrying all this
[1:12:50] stuff you ever talk to somebody finds
[1:12:54] out they they move after from one place
[1:12:56] after they've lived there for a long
[1:12:58] long time you know what they realize we
[1:13:00] got a lot of
[1:13:02] stuff they call it
[1:13:08] downsizing yeah a friend one time he
[1:13:10] downsized from 375 to
[1:13:15] 350 he had so much stuff how much stuff
[1:13:19] do you have you can live
[1:13:22] without
[1:13:24] how much
[1:13:25] stuff I go through a junk drawer and oh
[1:13:28] someday I'm going to need this and
[1:13:30] someday I'm going to use that and this
[1:13:31] is a pretty good Gadget and that's a
[1:13:33] pretty good Gadget and you know before
[1:13:35] long I got two junk
[1:13:39] drawers and every now and then I'll take
[1:13:42] them drawers and I'll go get a box and
[1:13:45] I'll dump it all in the
[1:13:47] box and you know something I don't think
[1:13:50] about it and I make another junk drawer
[1:13:54] why because we hang on to things we hold
[1:13:56] on to things you know what there's a a
[1:14:00] program I saw my mom's one
[1:14:02] time it was called buried alive and I
[1:14:06] thought buried alive you know that that
[1:14:08] intrigued me so I thought I would go
[1:14:11] watch it forgive me if I I watched it
[1:14:14] but you know I don't need to defend
[1:14:16] myself because I I sat there and I I
[1:14:19] watched and you know it was it was a
[1:14:21] story about
[1:14:22] Hoarders
[1:14:26] it it it shocked
[1:14:30] me that it's a
[1:14:32] disease well we've got spiritual
[1:14:36] hoarders we got people that hoard stuff
[1:14:39] and hang on to stuff and hang on to
[1:14:41] fears hang on to doubts hang on to Old
[1:14:46] experiences hang on they hang on to all
[1:14:48] kinds of things traditions and and and
[1:14:51] everything and Paul PA said I count all
[1:14:54] those things as D I leave those things
[1:14:56] which are behind I walk away from
[1:15:00] them and there I'm not going to continue
[1:15:04] to carry this stuff with me I'm not
[1:15:07] going to
[1:15:08] hoard problems
[1:15:11] right I'm not going to hoard
[1:15:15] feelings I'm not going to hoard
[1:15:19] complexes I'm going to walk
[1:15:21] away I'm to walk away from
[1:15:25] fears people just love to have fears
[1:15:29] they're afraid of everything leave it on
[1:15:32] the
[1:15:35] dock leave it on the dock he's got you
[1:15:39] nothing can pluck you out of the palm of
[1:15:41] his hand he's got you
[1:15:47] covered I don't need to carry this I
[1:15:49] don't have to be
[1:15:51] afraid I don't have to ho this fear this
[1:15:54] feeling of fear and then we realize is
[1:15:58] that if you carry that fear with you
[1:16:02] into this uncoming
[1:16:05] storm into these perilous times that
[1:16:09] fear is going to affect your
[1:16:12] judgments it's going to affect your
[1:16:14] Viewpoint it's going to Cloud your
[1:16:17] decisions it's going to Cloud your life
[1:16:20] it's going to keep you from stepping out
[1:16:24] it's going to keep you from rising in
[1:16:26] faith and you won't be able to get
[1:16:28] through the storm if you carry all this
[1:16:33] stuff it's time to get rid of some
[1:16:39] stuff
[1:16:43] selfishness
[1:16:48] self-preservation you can live for
[1:16:52] yourself
[1:16:54] you can't just be so hung up on how you
[1:16:57] look and what people think of you you
[1:17:01] know that's a form of
[1:17:03] selfishness oh I wonder how I
[1:17:07] look you
[1:17:09] know how do I
[1:17:11] look do I look
[1:17:16] fat how do I look praise God I got a
[1:17:20] Pulpit you know you get so worried about
[1:17:24] it you can't think about this you can't
[1:17:27] think that about because you're so
[1:17:29] thinking about yourself you can't think
[1:17:31] about somebody else what do they think
[1:17:33] what do they think nine chances out of
[1:17:36] 10 they don't think nothing but you're
[1:17:38] so hung up on
[1:17:40] yourself that you think people have got
[1:17:43] to be thinking about you surely I'm so
[1:17:45] good somebody's thinking of something I
[1:17:47] don't care whether it's good or bad but
[1:17:49] think of
[1:17:52] me

[1:17:58] me self you're worried about
[1:18:02] yourself oh I'm just worried you know
[1:18:04] what what I who's going to take care of
[1:18:08] me well I'm trusting he
[1:18:11] is he said he would can I want you to
[1:18:15] understand we can't we can't take these
[1:18:18] things with us we've got to walk
[1:18:21] away we got to leave them on the dock we
[1:18:26] got to leave those things
[1:18:28] behind we got to leave those things
[1:18:31] behind and
[1:18:33] apprehend something in other words if
[1:18:36] you leave selfishness behind you have to
[1:18:39] apprehend and press for the higher
[1:18:41] calling of living for
[1:18:46] others some people are so worried about
[1:18:51] Finance can you know what I mean they
[1:18:53] they they call the
[1:18:55] bank and and and I understand some
[1:18:58] people maybe they their past lives has
[1:19:01] caused them to be that
[1:19:04] way I I I had a little lady that went to
[1:19:07] our bank and she'd go in there about
[1:19:08] every three days and asked to tell her
[1:19:10] how much she had in her
[1:19:13] account she had a couple thousand dollar
[1:19:16] and she took a lot of security in that
[1:19:19] couple
[1:19:20] $100,000 but how many many tragedies are
[1:19:23] in the world today that $2,000 wouldn't
[1:19:27] cover the
[1:19:29] aspirin you can't be
[1:19:32] afraid you we've got to start leaving
[1:19:35] stuff behind we've got to stuff
[1:19:38] unloading we got to get this stuff out
[1:19:40] of our Lives we've got to get this stuff
[1:19:42] out of our mind we got to get this stuff
[1:19:45] out of our approach to life and how we
[1:19:50] live because we we can't can't live
[1:19:53] Godly in Christ Jesus with all this
[1:19:57] stuff on the
[1:20:00] boat time to go in clean out the
[1:20:04] garage have a garage
[1:20:07] sale you you want you want to you know
[1:20:10] the best thing to do with all that stuff
[1:20:11] is give it back to the devil where you
[1:20:15] borrowed it from in the first
[1:20:17] place God didn't give it to you you
[1:20:20] borrowed it from the Devil yes he lent
[1:20:24] it to you here why don't you pack some
[1:20:26] fear for a while why don't you pack some
[1:20:30] doubt for a while here I got a few
[1:20:32] complexes for you to carry why don't you
[1:20:36] put this in your wagon and put that in
[1:20:38] your wagon and you go through life and
[1:20:41] Satan's just out there donating to you

[1:21:24] and you'll find out pretty soon you know
[1:21:26] what I I don't have
[1:21:28] to
[1:21:31] worry he's got me nothing will pluck me
[1:21:36] out of his hands because we can't go
[1:21:39] into the
[1:21:41] future
[1:21:44] carrying the stuff we've
[1:21:47] got and I'm not talking
[1:21:51] carnally
[1:21:53] I'm talking
[1:21:56] spiritual sometimes you can try all that
[1:21:59] you
[1:22:00] want to overcome a
[1:22:05] habit and if someone
[1:22:07] smokes you say would do you believe in
[1:22:09] nicotine patches I believe in
[1:22:14] anything doctors
[1:22:16] help patches
[1:22:20] anything that will help help you
[1:22:24] stop I believe in anything that'll help
[1:22:27] you stop
[1:22:29] drinking I'm not against anything that's
[1:22:32] good
[1:22:34] right but regardless of what you try one
[1:22:38] day you're going to have to walk
[1:22:42] away one day you got to say I cannot go
[1:22:46] on with
[1:22:51] this I can't carry this in my
[1:22:54] life it won't make
[1:22:56] it through what lies ahead you
[1:23:00] understand me it won't make
[1:23:02] it it'll sink your
[1:23:05] ship and I thought what a Time of the
[1:23:07] Year everybody wants to turn a new Leaf
[1:23:10] I'm not saying Turn new leaves I'm
[1:23:12] saying let's empty the
[1:23:15] wagon let's leave those things some of
[1:23:18] those things out of our
[1:23:21] Lives let's leave let's leave bitterness
[1:23:25] is lot of things in your life God's told
[1:23:28] you to make
[1:23:31] right make it right get it off the
[1:23:39] wagon I had something that bothered me
[1:23:41] for years I did I did something
[1:23:44] wrong and then I went to the brother
[1:23:46] years later and say brother I was wrong
[1:23:48] I did this I I don't know what was in my
[1:23:50] thinking forgive me
[1:23:54] and guess what my light got lighter cuz
[1:23:57] every time I'd meet a challenge or every
[1:24:00] time I'd come up to something that would
[1:24:02] pop
[1:24:05] up and I thought I've been carrying this
[1:24:07] thing for years what's wrong with
[1:24:11] me no matter where i' get or how far I
[1:24:14] would get up the mountain I'd come to
[1:24:17] that spot and I thought that thing would
[1:24:20] be there
[1:24:23] and I said 'y you know something I've
[1:24:25] got to get this out of my
[1:24:28] boat I've got to get this out of my life
[1:24:31] this step's getting hard I can't make it
[1:24:33] to that next
[1:24:34] level I had to lighten my
[1:24:37] load I had to empty my
[1:24:40] backpack I had to get stuff out of my
[1:24:46] wagon and you got
[1:24:49] to all any complexes all this stuff
[1:24:53] that's in your mind all this
[1:24:56] future we got to quit looking
[1:25:01] back we got to leave those things that
[1:25:03] are behind
[1:25:05] behind you can't do nothing about it but
[1:25:08] you can make a
[1:25:10] step
[1:25:13] higher and if you could approach this
[1:25:19] year not turning a new le
[1:25:24] but just applying the
[1:25:28] token if the token don't
[1:25:31] fit throw it
[1:25:35] away some of you it's as simple as going
[1:25:38] to your closet and getting rid of all
[1:25:40] them high heel
[1:25:43] shoes going through your wardrobe
[1:25:45] getting rid of all those tight
[1:25:49] dresses getting just rid of some stuff
[1:25:51] that just abs absolutely what good is it
[1:25:53] to
[1:25:55] you the messenger said you can't make
[1:25:57] this highway in them
[1:26:02] shoes you can't pass
[1:26:04] through the examiner wearing that you
[1:26:08] won't be able to go down the road you
[1:26:10] won't be able to go farther you won't be
[1:26:12] able to make the storm and we've been
[1:26:15] prophesied that the storm's
[1:26:20] coming and we just got to realize
[1:26:25] hey and I I'll sit here and say it as
[1:26:28] Paul said that I'm the chiefest and the
[1:26:31] most guilty of you all I've got lots of
[1:26:34] stuff I've got to
[1:26:36] unload but I got to know I've got to
[1:26:39] unload it that's the first place I've
[1:26:42] got to come to God I can't go farther
[1:26:45] keeping this I can't obtain the power of
[1:26:49] the Resurrection with this in my ship
[1:26:54] and it's time to do that and realize
[1:27:00] that and I'd like to now if you wouldn't
[1:27:04] bear with
[1:27:06] me because I think that one of the most
[1:27:08] important things that you've got to
[1:27:10] realize when you've got a full
[1:27:13] wagon and you've got stuff in your boat
[1:27:16] that don't belong and you've got
[1:27:19] complexes you've got attitudes you've
[1:27:21] got approach
[1:27:23] and and things that we've just covered
[1:27:26] up how many knows what religion is it's
[1:27:28] a
[1:27:29] covering you cover it up with Fellowship
[1:27:32] you cover it up with a sweet personality
[1:27:36] you you know what I mean I it's just my
[1:27:38] nature I come off the street you know
[1:27:41] but when someone's all ooey gooey I
[1:27:42] always wonder what's what's behind all
[1:27:46] that you know just be
[1:27:51] yourself and we just got to realize and
[1:27:55] I thought you know what what happens to
[1:27:59] me when I empty all my wagon and I get
[1:28:04] all this stuff out of my life you know
[1:28:07] what you'll find out you don't know who
[1:28:09] you
[1:28:11] are and that's why people hang on to
[1:28:14] stuff because that's become who they
[1:28:18] are they wouldn't even know how to
[1:28:21] relate
[1:28:24] I remember my great friend brother Brown
[1:28:27] his wife was
[1:28:28] Dorothy and Dorothy doesn't speak much
[1:28:32] but when she spoke she'd say more in one
[1:28:36] sentence than most people would say in a
[1:28:40] book and one day we were talking about
[1:28:43] some stuff going on and and you know
[1:28:47] taking sides with this and how people
[1:28:50] were handling this and talking like that
[1:28:52] and Dorothy just sat there you know like
[1:28:54] she was and she's in glory now so it's
[1:28:57] my friend brother
[1:28:58] Braham and she just sat there and and
[1:29:02] I'll never forget it and I was trying to
[1:29:04] analyze it and I was trying to discern
[1:29:07] which guy was right and which guy was
[1:29:09] wrong and trying to sit back and just
[1:29:11] trying to figure it out and put all the
[1:29:13] pieces and see where I stand then
[1:29:16] Dorothy spoke
[1:29:18] up she said you know some people just
[1:29:21] like like to
[1:29:27] fuss and then she said if they weren't
[1:29:29] fussing about this they'd be fussing
[1:29:31] about something
[1:29:33] else and it stopped me in my
[1:29:38] tracks you know what I needed to do I
[1:29:40] just needed to walk away from it I
[1:29:43] didn't fit in it I wasn't a part of it I
[1:29:46] didn't need to have a side I needed to
[1:29:49] take sides with Jesus
[1:29:54] now if there's things in Your Wagon and
[1:29:57] I'm not trying to go through a list till
[1:30:00] I find your
[1:30:02] number I think we all could do
[1:30:07] better I think there's
[1:30:10] burdens that we all carry but the
[1:30:14] scripture says cast your cares upon Him
[1:30:17] for he carth for you and I'd like to
[1:30:20] play this morning
[1:30:22] because I think this is a beautiful
[1:30:24] sermon for the new year called he
[1:30:29] carth for
[1:30:34] you how easy would it be to leave
[1:30:37] something
[1:30:39] behind to forgive somebody if you
[1:30:43] knew he would take care of
[1:30:46] it so if if you have your a device that
[1:30:50] you would like to read along with or or
[1:30:53] the board we're going to start in
[1:30:56] paragraph
[1:31:02] 64 and brother BR says this he says why
[1:31:06] is it man thirst and hunger because when
[1:31:10] he was made he was made and created with
[1:31:15] a little place in him that God dwelt to
[1:31:20] comfort him
[1:31:22] and when he shook himself away from God
[1:31:26] by sin then that place is vacant and
[1:31:31] that's why he's hungering for it
[1:31:34] reaching for
[1:31:38] it ask yourself this morning have you
[1:31:41] put stuff in that vacant
[1:31:47] spot do you have things in that spot
[1:31:50] that God reserved for himself
[1:31:58] s he says and the trouble today with us
[1:32:02] Christians I'm afraid is we're not doing
[1:32:05] all we can do to show our fallen brother
[1:32:09] that that's what's the matter with
[1:32:14] him are we maybe maybe as a pastor I'm
[1:32:17] not doing all I can do to show us that's
[1:32:20] what the matter with this
[1:32:24] we're carrying way too
[1:32:25] much personal
[1:32:28] stuff and we're supposed to
[1:32:31] die and get rid of it
[1:32:35] all he says that's what the matter with
[1:32:39] juvenile delinquency is because there's
[1:32:41] been a delinquency in the
[1:32:44] church and a delinquency in the home and
[1:32:48] that's made the juvenile a
[1:32:50] delinquency that's the reason that the
[1:32:53] beatnicks and so forth are on the
[1:32:56] streets of jumping up and down and
[1:32:58] growing all these things it's because
[1:33:01] they're trying to find something to
[1:33:05] satisfy now we want to pick up our
[1:33:07] messenger and what he says because he
[1:33:10] says this let me say this tonight in the
[1:33:14] name of the Lord Jesus there's nothing
[1:33:16] will satisfy like the coming of the
[1:33:20] power of the Holy G ghost that will
[1:33:22] change your life and your attitudes and
[1:33:26] give you comfort and eternal
[1:33:30] life you have room in your life for that
[1:33:35] let's get rid of the things that we can
[1:33:36] get rid of then we'll be successful in
[1:33:40] the storm God bless you I'd like to
[1:33:42] finish this year listening to our
[1:33:44] messenger God bless
[1:33:48] you tonight in the name of the Lord
[1:33:50] Jesus there's nothing will satisfy like
[1:33:53] the coming of the power of the Holy
[1:33:55] Ghost that'll change your life and your
[1:33:57] attitudes and give you comfort in
[1:33:59] eternal
[1:34:01] life there is a fountain filled with
[1:34:04] blood drawn from emanuel's veins when
[1:34:07] Sinners plunge beneath the flood lose
[1:34:09] all their guilty stain a wife might
[1:34:12] comfort in pth a friend might sit down
[1:34:15] and give good advice but there's only
[1:34:18] one thing that can take away sin that's
[1:34:21] the BL of the Lord Jesus what can take
[1:34:24] away my sins nothing but the blood of
[1:34:26] Jesus what can make me hold again
[1:34:29] nothing but the blood of Jesus as the
[1:34:32] writer said oh precious is that flow
[1:34:35] that makes me white as snow no other
[1:34:37] Fountain know nothing but the blood of
[1:34:40] Jesus that's it that
[1:34:42] cleanses and purifies and brings in a
[1:34:46] fellowship a little while and the world
[1:34:49] will see me no more yet ye shall see me
[1:34:52] for I a personal pronoun will be with
[1:34:56] you even in you to the end of the
[1:34:59] world and when he the Holy Spirit has
[1:35:02] come he will com be the comforter the
[1:35:05] father will send in my name he'll show
[1:35:07] you things to come and bring things to
[1:35:09] your remembrance one as we set together
[1:35:11] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus the
[1:35:14] Holy Spirit coming through the word

[1:35:25] the world has nowhere to stand they're
[1:35:28] drinking gambling Maring given in
[1:35:30] marriage because they have rejected the
[1:35:33] true foundation of comfort the Holy
[1:35:36] Spirit but we who believe in him are
[1:35:38] looking for our kingdom to come amen
[1:35:42] blessed be the name of the Lord where
[1:35:44] they feed them or sorrow or crying or
[1:35:48] heartaches but peace and joy and love
[1:35:52] and immortality shall take its place
[1:35:55] someday cast your cares if you have
[1:35:58] cares cast them on him for he carth for
[1:36:02] you the other leads to Eternal death
[1:36:07] this leads to eternal life and a man's
[1:36:10] made so he could want that comforter
[1:36:13] he's wanting a
[1:36:15] comforter because he was made that way
[1:36:18] that's the way God put him up together

[1:36:22] conscience his sights his senses
[1:36:24] everything was put together and in this

[1:48:30] the only thing she had left was a coat
[1:48:32] that her mother gave her she cut it on
[1:48:34] the inside to put her bottles down in
[1:48:36] there such an alcoholic that she might
[1:48:38] not freeze to death Lane in the gutters

[1:49:09] she's believed on him thus saith the
[1:49:12] Lord From This Hour on no more alcohol
[1:49:15] and now she's a sweet loving Christian
[1:49:17] from place to place and from d to die

[1:49:27] alcoholics Jesus
[1:49:30] cares so just cast your cares upon Him
[1:49:34] in your sorrow he cares when you lose
[1:49:37] your loved ones he cares he cares for
[1:49:39] the dead those who've died in Christ one
[1:49:42] day he was so weary in his way he could
[1:49:44] hardly go but there come a a band from
[1:49:49] the city a funeral
[1:49:51] procession and a little mother
[1:49:54] frantically throwing her hands in the
[1:49:56] air and
[1:49:57] ringing oh Jehovah why did you take him
[1:50:01] he's my only
[1:50:03] son he was tired and weary but he cared
[1:50:07] for that poor little heartbroken
[1:50:09] woman walked over to the the carriers
[1:50:13] that that carried the the casket and
[1:50:16] touched it and said
[1:50:18] sonrise why he
[1:50:21] cared he understands now we know by his
[1:50:25] life that he cares now the question is
[1:50:28] for us tonight do you
[1:50:31] care he cares but now do you care if you
[1:50:35] do not care then he can help you but if
[1:50:39] you care enough or care enough about
[1:50:43] yourself I've heard people make this
[1:50:46] insane remark I Don't Care What Becomes
[1:50:49] Of Me Oh My
[1:50:51] I sure be Care What Becomes Of
[1:50:53] Me sure I do I
[1:50:56] care I believe any person in their right
[1:50:59] mind
[1:51:01] cares I want to know what's going to
[1:51:03] happen to me and if I know he love me
[1:51:06] that no one else could love like that he
[1:51:09] cares for you he cares for you no matter
[1:51:11] how little you are how insignificant you
[1:51:13] are how poor how indifferent how many
[1:51:16] times you've tried and failed he still
[1:51:19] cares his love still knocks at your
[1:51:21] heart's
[1:51:22] door but are we ungrateful for that in a
[1:51:26] day here where I just told you I hope it
[1:51:28] didn't go over your head I hope it just
[1:51:31] didn't pass through lightly but you
[1:51:33] remember these words that everything's
[1:51:35] at the end civilization's at the end
[1:51:40] democracy at the
[1:51:41] end everything this nation is
[1:51:45] honeycombed just anytime to blow to
[1:51:48] pieces
[1:51:51] oh other nations the Worlds at the end
[1:51:55] for every martal thing must die that
[1:51:57] imortal can take its place we've got to
[1:52:01] come to this place we're here we're at
[1:52:04] the end and there's no other Foundation
[1:52:06] there's nothing else that you can and
[1:52:08] nothing else can care now but Jesus and
[1:52:11] He does care don't you care enough to
[1:52:14] submit your life to him to love him to
[1:52:18] go to the streets to go to your to your
[1:52:20] neighbor to everywhere with a sweet
[1:52:22] Gentle Spirit separate yourselves from
[1:52:25] the things of the world and live such a
[1:52:26] Peaceable sweet life that others will
[1:52:29] see Jesus in you don't you feel that you
[1:52:32] owe that to him let's not be ungrateful
[1:52:35] you people here last evening when I went
[1:52:37] out a little woman was standing at the
[1:52:39] door I hope she's here tonight when I
[1:52:41] went through she was standing there with
[1:52:42] a little baby it got to crying she
[1:52:45] wasn't a Christian but she didn't want
[1:52:47] the message to be interfered so she took
[1:52:50] her baby and slipped out with it when I
[1:52:52] went out the door she said oh I would
[1:52:54] have loved to hear the end of that
[1:52:56] message and I asked something you said
[1:52:58] to me this is Prov not providential this
[1:53:01] is of God I said lady are you a
[1:53:03] Christian she said no sir I hope to be
[1:53:06] sometime lovely looking little mother
[1:53:08] with a little baby in her arm I said
[1:53:12] he's here don't put it off too long and
[1:53:14] there we bowed our heads together there
[1:53:17] and prayed and I asked God to take years
[1:53:20] so and at the end when I got through
[1:53:22] praying she said I'm man and she began
[1:53:25] to wipe the tears from her eyes why she
[1:53:29] showed when she wanted the message
[1:53:31] though if she didn't get it maybe she
[1:53:33] had somebody here to get it she wanted
[1:53:35] somebody else to get it and what did it
[1:53:38] do God cared so he had her standing
[1:53:41] right there just exactly the place to
[1:53:44] receive it I said he cares he knows how
[1:53:48] to work things just right right are we
[1:53:51] grateful enough reminds me of a story of
[1:53:53] something happened in a city nearby some
[1:53:57] years ago a mother had sent her girl
[1:53:59] away to college her name was
[1:54:02] Mary and so the girl was a fine girl
[1:54:06] when she left home she' her mother had
[1:54:08] washed over a washboard and so forth to
[1:54:11] to pay her way through college and one
[1:54:13] day she went to visit home and she got
[1:54:16] mixed up out there with a mixed class of
[1:54:19] people
[1:54:20] and she got in fellowship with an
[1:54:23] unbelieving girl that was very worldly
[1:54:26] and ungodly and it's bad when you go to
[1:54:30] segregating with such as that separate
[1:54:33] yourselves from the things of the world
[1:54:35] come out don't be better try to act like
[1:54:38] you're better but don't Mar your
[1:54:40] garments with the sin don't be partakers
[1:54:43] of other men sins if you want to speak a
[1:54:45] word of encouragement to people all
[1:54:47] right but don't have to water with the
[1:54:49] pig you stay away from it that's right
[1:54:52] and she got down into the gutter with
[1:54:54] this girl and then when she come home
[1:54:56] the train stopped in front and the girl
[1:54:59] sitting at the window looked out and
[1:55:01] there was an old woman out there that
[1:55:04] was all scarred all over her face and
[1:55:06] her neck draw way in her little hands
[1:55:08] bony like that looking with all that was
[1:55:11] in her heart watching for someone to get
[1:55:12] off the train and this girl was with
[1:55:15] Mary she said Mary look at that old
[1:55:18] haggy looking
[1:55:20] woman said isn't she awful looking and
[1:55:22] that was Mary's
[1:55:25] mother and Mary because of the feeling
[1:55:29] of her friend she said yes she is buried
[1:55:32] and when they got off the the train mary
[1:55:36] caught in that stage her mother run said
[1:55:38] oh darling I'm so glad to see you and
[1:55:41] Mary turned her back to her
[1:55:44] mother and she said I don't know you and
[1:55:47] started to walk away and there had to be
[1:55:50] a conductor standing there and he jumped
[1:55:52] on his box and he said wait a minute and
[1:55:56] he attracted the attention of all around
[1:55:58] he said you child of
[1:56:02] misery how could you turn your back on
[1:56:05] your own mother because of that little
[1:56:07] flip that's with you aren't you ashamed
[1:56:10] of yourself Mary that I happen to know
[1:56:13] the case listen you here young woman to
[1:56:15] the other girl that had made the remark
[1:56:18] about it said that's her her mother and
[1:56:20] Mary will never see the day that she was
[1:56:23] half as pretty as her mother I knew her
[1:56:25] when she was young and said she was
[1:56:28] happily married and she had this little
[1:56:30] baby Mary and she was upstairs and she
[1:56:33] had the windows open so that the the
[1:56:35] breeze would the little cradle up there
[1:56:38] and said she went downstairs and was
[1:56:40] doing her washing hanging them up in the
[1:56:41] backyard and fire caught in the house
[1:56:43] and before she knew it the house is all
[1:56:45] of flame the neighbors running and when
[1:56:48] Mary's mother come around said she said
[1:56:51] my baby my baby it's
[1:56:53] upstairs and the fireman said the house
[1:56:56] is out of control there's no way to get
[1:56:58] to it now but what did she do she
[1:57:01] grabbed her little apron off of her that
[1:57:03] was wet with washed water and wrapped it
[1:57:05] around her face and run through those
[1:57:07] blazes and the policeman trying to stop
[1:57:09] her she run up the stairs real quick
[1:57:11] while her loving baby was laying there
[1:57:14] and she grabbed the baby and she thought
[1:57:16] the wet garment protected me but now if
[1:57:19] I take the baby back to it'll cut it to
[1:57:21] Pieces those Flames so she wrapped the
[1:57:24] baby in her own wet garment held it in
[1:57:27] her bosom and run through the blazes
[1:57:29] they tore the Beat from her face said
[1:57:32] that's the reason she's ugly she's ugly
[1:57:35] that you might be pretty and you mean
[1:57:38] you'd turn your back on your mother that
[1:57:40] made such a
[1:57:42] sacrifice in shame she bowed her head I
[1:57:46] think that's the way we ought to be this
[1:57:49] gospel El this comforter that we have
[1:57:51] this holy spirit that the world calls
[1:57:56] fanaticism that the people want to say
[1:57:58] they're Holy
[1:58:00] Rollers Are you ashamed Are you ashamed
[1:58:04] of the sacrifice that Jesus made down on
[1:58:06] the cross that we might have his comfort
[1:58:10] would you swap it for the comfort of the
[1:58:11] world a popularity of some neighbor God
[1:58:15] forbid may we cast our cares on him for
[1:58:18] he cares for us may we love him and
[1:58:20] cherish him with all that's in us always
[1:58:24] the disciples return back rejoicing
[1:58:26] because they were counted worthy to Bear
[1:58:28] the reproach of his name that's the way
[1:58:31] I feel tonight I don't care you can say
[1:58:33] I'm out of my mind you can call me Holy
[1:58:36] Roller and my Baptist Church told me I'd
[1:58:38] lose my mind or I would go be a Holy
[1:58:40] Roller my father and mother turned me
[1:58:42] from their house with nothing but a
[1:58:43] paper sack under my arm with some
[1:58:45] clothes under a little shirt and a
[1:58:48] change of under your clothes and a
[1:58:50] couple pair of socks is all I had my own
[1:58:53] people said you can't bring that stuff
[1:58:55] around here and remain our child and I
[1:58:57] went to knew all not KN where to go with
[1:59:00] no place to lay my head brother and the
[1:59:03] devil come to me in that hour the dying
[1:59:05] of my child many times I have come but I
[1:59:08] know where salvation lays I couldn't
[1:59:10] denight though it would kill me I can't
[1:59:13] tonight I passed from death into Life by
[1:59:16] the grace of God my cares are all cast
[1:59:19] on him for he cares for me and he cares
[1:59:22] for you let us bow our heads just a
[1:59:25] moment
[1:59:30] now what challenge is he
[1:59:33] meant and he can meet those challenges
[1:59:35] he could face those
[1:59:37] struggles because he had a pure heart
[1:59:41] and he wasn't
[1:59:42] carrying a bunch of stuff in his life
[1:59:45] and and that's what I'd like to just
[1:59:47] encourage you this Stephen you don't
[1:59:50] know what lies
[1:59:52] ahead but if if there's anything in
[1:59:58] there that you're ashamed of he
[2:00:03] cares he
[2:00:05] cares I knew Rosella
[2:00:09] Griffin I stayed in Rosella Griffin's
[2:00:13] home and of course I sat there and I
[2:00:15] wanted to know her testimony and all she
[2:00:17] wanted to do was know mind how did God
[2:00:21] save you how did you come to the
[2:00:24] Lord and oh she just
[2:00:27] rejoiced because she knew a
[2:00:29] God that can do that and that's this
[2:00:32] morning that's the God we know that's
[2:00:35] the god that we want to approach this

[2:00:41] that's knowing that's going with us no
[2:00:44] matter what the problem looks like no

[2:00:49] cast our cares upon Him we can leave
