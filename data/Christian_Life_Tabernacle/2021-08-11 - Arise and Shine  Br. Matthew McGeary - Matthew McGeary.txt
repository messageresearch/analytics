Description:
Arise and Shine
Br. Matthew McGeary
Wednesday Service: August 11,  2021. 
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

when the time came said weep not john for the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed lord lord i want to say that you've prevailed over my heart you've prevailed over my life you've prevailed over every sickness every sin every devil and you are high and lifted up all the bride of jesus christ lift you up right now lord jesus we worship you we give you glory we give you honor we give you praise lord there's no other name that's higher there's only no other name that's greater no one has our heart like you do lord and we're here to worship you lord thank you for your word lord thank you for your call thank you for your message thank you for your presence that's here lord thank you for your promise that's told us that where two or three are gathered in your name that you are here in our midst lord we're honored lord oh may we move past the veil of flesh tonight lord and realize that you are here in our midst lord we don't want to unrecognize your presence lord may we have a sobriety about us an approach a reverence an expectation that shows that there's someone here that's in control there's someone here that deserves glory there's someone here that deserves reverence there's someone here that deserves praise there's someone here that deserves our attention we're here lord for you we love you we thank you now we surrender ourselves to you asking that you would come now and break the bread of life as only you can we pray these blessings these praises in the most precious name the lord jesus christ amen amen hallelujah why don't we just go ahead and turn in our bibles to isaiah 59. man there's just such a wonderful presence here in the house of god i believe god is pleased to be here and now we just welcome all of our visitors that are here with us it's good to see each one of you amen pray god would be your portion reading out of isaiah chapter 59 i want to read verses 19 to 21 and it says so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun so just make notice of that how he says so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him and the redeemer shall come to zion and unto them that turn from the transgression in jacob saith the lord as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord my spirit that is upon thee and my word which i have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed saith the lord from henceforth and forever amen we ask a blessing on the word you may be seated just maybe wanting to in the outset just bring your attention here to this uh verse here in 19 it says so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun so maybe if we could just crystallize our thinking or put our spiritual thinking caps on we want to see how this word applies to the day that we're living in so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him and we can actually even see the progression here he says and then the redeemer shall come to zion now we know that zion is a type of the bride and then the next portion as the scripture unfold and then he turns to the jews because he's going to deal with the transgression and jacob which what is a transgression it's to go against and so this was the transgression was is that they rejected the messiah and so we can see even in this scripture here a type of the last days unfolding and the brother branham would say this he would say now the gentile church has come to their time and now we're looking for a messiah and if that's the way he acted before that in that day he has to act the same today now brother branham has just taken time to talk about abraham and sarah and talking about how he called him and he gave him his word but before the promised son was to arise on the scene god had appeared in flesh right god had come as melchizedek as you would dramatize that there was god there and he said come on gabriel come on michael we're going down to visit abraham and he he took some potash and he took some and blew some earth together and he stepped right into that body and he came there to visit abraham in the form of a man it was none other than god veiling himself in flesh to abraham and sarah before the arrival of the promised son isaac and now the prophet of god is saying if he acted that way in that day then he has to act the same way now if he lets us go on with with without it then he isn't the same and then he doesn't act the same and he's a respect of persons oh i'm so glad he's not a respecter of person because if there was anybody in this room that doesn't deserve any respect well i would say i'm the first one if you only knew where i've been and what i've done oh my if we went down there i'm telling you friends you wouldn't talk to me you wouldn't want to have anything to do with me my you would just think how could that guy right there be in the midst in this room with all of these people oh thank god for the grace of god thanks for his blood that can reach down into the lowest hell he can reach down into the myrik clay and i'm so thankful for that that our god practices what he preaches because he is no respecter of persian because if you were doing a lineup she who you wanted to serve god in the end time you'd patch right on by me you wouldn't say he gots it this guy's good this this guy knows how to study this guy knows how to remember the word right he knows how to archicate everything together no sir i'm an uneducated man i'm the least of all of you but thanks god that he's not a respecter of person he saw fit to look upon me in the time of my need it was grace oh if anybody in here can say grace grace marvelous grace it's me thank god he's not a respecter of persons he's a respecter of persons but he's not he says see what i mean he's got to do the same thing again so that makes jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he says now civilization has traveled with the sun now just no notice our opening text here it says so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and is going from the rising of the sun it says civilization has traveled with the sun we all know that oldest civilization is china and as civilization comes sin heaps up keeps heaping and now it hit the west coast there's a sound barrier or an iron curtain separating the east and the west there's no more people out there in the ocean you go plumb on over till you get back east again and sin has constantly came when the indians lived here and had no sin he had little tribal wars but when the white men had come he brought whiskey women murder and everything else and sin is constantly heaped up and as sin heaps up the bible said when the enemy comes in like a flood now watch the the positioning of this scripture he's not putting this scripture in a day gone by but he's taking the word right now and he's placing it right here in the day in the age that we're living and he says when the bible the bible said when the enemy comes in like a flood god would raise up a standard against it the word of god raise up a standard the word would be more manifested and more manifested so we see that sin has heaped up oh i don't know where you're living but if you're living in the same world that i'm living in sin has heaped up the corruption the moral decay the imagination of man's hearts being continually evil just like it was in the days of noah oh we've seen sin heaped up we're living in the darkest age that man has ever seen but the prophet is showing you how the word here is right in time it's right in season he says the word of god would raise up a standard the word would be meant more manifested and more manifested maybe as we just move a little bit here i just want to read out of spiritual food and due season the prophetess says i want you to get built up now in the holy oracles of god in the faith so i want you to get built up in the word in the faith the faith of this hour he said it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this age for this has to be rapturing faith to be taken up and so we want you to believe tonight in all that you have seen heard and the word that you have heard preached the signs and wonders that you have seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider whether if that be of god or not oh my i say god let me accumulate all of the preaching of the word everything that i have seen everything that i have heard lord let me accumulate it all in my heart and oh god as all as i as i accumulate all of that in my heart i say lord i believe it's that word it's that accumulation it's what you've done it's what you have spoken lord that has quickened me to life and i say lord i believe it lord oh let me take all of that word let me accumulate it all together in my heart lord and i'm pondering that word i'm considering that word because it's that word that is producing rapturing faith if there's a faith for the hour not another hour not a day gone by not a glare from another age but there has to be a faith for this hour when sin is heaping up when corruption in man is the way that it is now we have a word that says that god would raise up a standard and that the word would be more manifested and more manifested when the enemy comes in like a flood god would raise up the standard against it the word of god would raise up a standard that the word would be more manifested and more manifest and i say lord i want the word more manifested in my life i'm not satisfied with where i'm at i'm thankful that i'm not where i used to be but i am not satisfied with where i'm at i'm saying lord i want this word to be more manifested in me i'm thankful oh god that i've caught the revelation of malachi 4 5. i'm so thankful for that i'm catching the revelations of revelation 17. i i of luke 17. i'm so thankful that i've caught the revelation of revelations 10 1-7 but oh i don't want that to become history as our pastor was pointing out if we just allow that to be rally christ then that just becomes denominational fiction because if it just becomes a letter it's a dead letter but we need the quickening power we need the life that's in the word to come upon the believer and make this word a reality and that's why i believe the word that i've heard because there was a spirit of god that moved upon this flesh oh i grew up in the church i grew up in the church house i heard my daddy sit around and speak with other preachers and people would come over and i had a knowledge i ran around in the world and something in me there was an agreeableness that i believe that god sent a prophet but did it change my life no did it change the way that i acted no was i better than anybody else no and i still ain't better than anybody else but there had to come a time that the life that was in the word came upon this flesh and quickened the seed that was inside of me and then it changed me then it was manifested in me but no i don't sit down and stop right there i want more i say lord i want more manifest your word in me lord jesus i want more oh my as i just sat there and pondered the service tonight just feeling uh a feeble and and and uh incapable i was in prayer and the lord reminded me of the scripture where david said i am young but now i am old but i have never seen the righteous forsaken and i have never seen them begging bread and something in my heart said oh that might be for a natural bread but i am so thankful that those that hunger and thirst after righteousness they shall be filled oh i want to say if you have a hunger for the word of god oh you don't have to come here and not be filled oh as insignificant as i might be i say your heavenly father is faithful and he is just and he's not going to forsake you but he'll take the little reading of the word he'll take the little quote that's read and he'll break the bread and he'll feed your soul oh if we can just open up our heart to let them speak to us and say lord jesus i have me speak to me lord god oh hallelujah break the bread of life lord jesus why we're living in a time where there's a spiritual drought oh people my they it's bad out there but we are the most blessed people we have spiritual food and due season when people are out there trying to feed out of garbage cans and they're going to these uh nonsensical gatherings and people calling themselves christians oh my to think we have what we have but i wonder what are we doing with it is it sitting on the shelf is it sitting in our phone are we listening to it i might get on a hobby horse center in a little bit but i want to say if you're not those of us oh my if you can understand english i say us english-speaking people we have a great responsibility that we can hear the prophet's word the word of god come through the prophet in its purest form that it was given and we're not related not through translations but all thank god in his grace and his mercy he protects his word because the very bible that we read it wasn't written in english it was written in some language that i don't understand but god was faithful and just to protect that word so don't you let the devil try to belittle you or try to feel like you haven't gotten the message god has protected his word that that spoken word would get to your heart so i don't care if you speak chinese if you speak french if you speak whatever you speak if you're a predestinated seed of god his word will get there some of us just have to work a little harder and i say i think i think it's just like i said maybe be on a hobby horse but i think sometimes as american people as english believers we're the most slothful out of all of them because we've had everything just handed it to us and we got in our own lane we don't even have to fight for it it just sits there like we got it like i got the message when i know brothers in our church and brother billy can even testify about it we're brothers and sisters would painstakingly take one little message take half a book and they would write it out so that they could have their own copy and they would pass it to another brothers and they would write it out oh they would cherish that message oh thank you god for sending a prophet thank you god for the evening light and they held on to it oh but we got it so easy we just put it in an electronic box and throw it on the table say i wonder what brother so-and-so is preaching over there i wonder what brother so-and-so is preaching over there and i wonder if we're listening to other other men preach more than we're actually listening to the prophet if i could be a mouthpiece of god to you tonight shame on you shame on you oh but we need the five-fold ministry to break the bread we need the five-fold ministry to break the word yes how can the five-fold ministry break the word to you if you're not feeding on it [Music] you just want to show up and i don't know where we got on this hobby horse but we just want to show up and have the man of god bless us break the word preacher break the word pastor i've had a hard week but if you're in prayer and you're listening to the tape and you're listening to the message like it is spiritual food in due season and you are in a drought and you're saying lord thank you lord for this daily bread feed my hungry soul and you approach it in prayer and in reverence and you listen to it and you share it and you fellowship about it and then you come to the house of god and then the pastor takes the text and then he takes the message and he starts to break the word and you're right there in the channel with him imagine what kind of atmosphere we would be in oh help us to reverence the word help us to have an expectation help us to cherish this message that we have thank you lord for spiritual food and due season look we have to move with the pillar of fire we can't keep looking back we can't keep thinking we're okay but we gotta move with the pillar don't get too comfortable don't drive your tent stakes down too far don't worry when that when the god starts to move we're so hunkered down here we got so many responsibilities and so many things done like man i finally did a two-tier tent uh man i just had that thing all set up and i put the little stove in there and i had it up there i'm like man we're moving again i was just getting comfortable here in the wilderness oh no we we this this the message is alive the pillar of fire is here the word is moving it's moving abroad it's it's moving us into the translation of our body we're moving out of this world we'll come up higher and higher oh we're going beyond this world into another dimension god help us not to get too comfortable oh we want to move with the pillar of fire the prophet of god would say this and god keeps his word and then along came the pentecostals with the restoration of gifts and you spoke with tongues and then you made a doctrine out of that and then what happened your lights gone out well you think that's do you think that's just left for the denominationals as soon as as soon as you catch a little of the message of god and put a period on it and become unteachable and not being able to be led can accept the leadership of god in your life no pastor can teach you when a man of god gets up and preaches the word of god and breaks the bread of life you're just constantly comparing it well you know prophet said okay yeah that that lines up with my doctrine i want to say you better watch out your light has gone out all you want to do is debate the message all you want to do somebody come out i've had to learn this myself and i'm still learning this god help me to learn and i'll just say it to everybody else but every time somebody shares a quote we want to finish it or we want to let them know we heard it too we just want everybody to know we know that too i remember i corrected a minister one time because i had to do it because my my precious friend got done uh preaching a message and and and instead of just paying the man of god a compliment also he could say well i remember i preached this this time and i did this and i did that and i just rebuked him for it could you i guarantee you the prophet didn't act like that because if he started you might as well be on the road to emmaus he'd start at moses no i mean yeah we're not all we're not know-it-alls we're not all puffed up we don't want to be like we know everything when everybody somebody wants to share the word of god and act like we've arrived to that revelation too why can't we just say you know that's really good that's that's that's the truth i believe that you know what why don't you tell me a little bit more why won't we foster a little a relationship why don't we foster some fellowship because if we're not careful our light just goes out we're just denominational thinkers yep check check up i believe that too i believe that too i believe that too but no the word is alive it's a living reality and it's moving a people into the promised land we're possessing the promised land we're going into a rapture he says oh your light has gone out what's the matter is because you failed to stay with the word god's words were unfolding and we must unfold as god's word unfolds we must unfold as god's word unfolds as time unfolds signs unfolds and if the natural world this man is the same man he was 6 000 years ago when god made him he's the same intellectual he's the same intelligence he's just the same man with the same five senses that he was thousands of years ago but look what progress he's made in the past 50 years now remember we're talking about sin heaping up talking about recognizing our day in its message seeing the word of god modern events made clear by prophecy seeing all this now in the day and age that we're living in he says look what the fallen sons son of god has did he's invented automobiles and radio and electric lights and atomic bombs and jet planes look how fast now watch this look how fast the pages are turning fast in science this is 1957 i believe look how fast the pages are turning in science look you can't even go buy a cell phone and gift it for a birthday present before they release the next model science and technology is just at a rapid break that pace he says but we are trying to linger back on some old church creed and and stand there when god wants to unfold the word we're living in the last days we're living in the time that god's great beautiful church ought to be standing on its feet shining like the lily of nevada that valley but we're back somewhere i belong to the presbyterian the methodist the pentecostal i'm this or that oh what a disgrace we should be unfolding god's spirit pouring out not just one little gusher this is where everybody in the church house should put up their hands and say amen not just one little gusher not one little baptism but baptism after baptism not a revelation just shall live by faith or sanctification or gifts of the spirit but revelation after revelation power after power glory after glory for we ought to be way up the road ready for oh i say god i want revelation after revelation power after power and glory after glory i said oh god is there a hunger for it are you thirsting for it oh if you want more revelation the prophet admonishes we should pray for more the thing we should pray for the most is revelation oh he says we should be way up the road ready for translation oh and then this was in 1957 but i like how the prophet of god would say an invisible union he would say that we are entering into another age he said we're entering into the rapture age but he said the church in its condition can't go the way that it is but then he said it can't go the way that it is and it's gonna get worse well brother matthew you're not putting putting much hope out there that's why we had to receive a message to call us out of the church to call us out of the lady ocean condition there there had to be a message come in the evening time when all sin and everything was heaped up and we see the condition of the age that it was in that we would hear the midnight cry we would hear the shout the message of the hour was calling us out of the darkness and maybe something that's just on my heart tonight i want to encourage you because many times we often hear phrases like this about it's going to take rapturing faith and i mean i i don't know if it's just going to be as long as we're in this sticky stick sticky flesh here but maybe we can all work together right now and say whenever you hear something like that claim it if it's gonna take rapturing faith that means you're a possessor of it so many times we hear the word of god and we shrink back and we hear rapturing faith bride time bright age we hear all these things and we start oh my goodness it's going to take rapturing faith well i don't even know if i could if i'm going to make it but you know what if i if i've done right you know the the prophet said if i've given a bottle of water to the elect that i people would get on that and i've certainly given a lot of water to everybody so i probably and all of a sudden god we're god's wanting you to move with the pillar of fire he's wanting the word to unfold in your life he's wanting revelation to come after revelation and glory after glory and so when he's wanting to take us into a higher sphere he needs us to believe the word take god at his word and say amen that's for me oh if it's going to take rapturing faith then i got rapturing faith coming it's going to take something more than we got then lord jesus then what what there is more it's coming for me oh we need to start being in an expectation instead of allowing our carnal minds and the devil to keep making us shrink back and compare our our sinful flesh if you will compare our intellectual man to compare our nature with the nature of god look in the natural sense we could never obtain to that supernatural but it's the supernatural faith that god has placed on the inside of you that believes god and takes him at his word and then that word materializes itself and your body let the word of god unfold in your life oh that the prophet said the move is on for the bride and that's thus saith the lord the move is on i said lord i want to move with you maybe i've i i've allowed myself to get a little too complacent maybe i've gotten a little too comfortable with my revelation i've gotten a little too comfortable in church but oh god i want to move with the message of the hour so i just want to encourage you because i myself am victim of it where we hear such great wonderful words and we feel so insignificant and incapable but if if it's going to take rapturing faith let's look at some simple biblical principles here in romans 10 17 it says so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god so if there is a faith for the hour there has to be a word for the hour right if it's going to be rapturing faith there has to be a rapturing word oh hallelujah if the prophet said it's going to take rapturing faith that means there has to be a rapturing word oh what was it there in thessalonians behold the lord shall descend with a shout what was that that was a rapturing what is the shout it's the bread of life gathering the br the the bride together it was the lord descending it was the lord coming down with an open book what was it it was the rapture breaking upon us in the end time if it's going to take rapturing faith then that means there's a rapturing word but we got to be built up in the oracles of god we got to unfold with the rapturing word what what what what was denomination always uh their their fallacy always was is they would hang their rapture on an event even uh oh i don't know if it was mary or martha i forget but even then she said to jesus oh lord i know that my brother will rise at the resurrection but what did jesus tell her he said i am the resurrection therefore the rapture is not so much of an event it's a person and the person of jesus christ has descended with an open book in hand he put one foot on the land one feet on the sea and he broke the seven seals calling your name calling you into a rapture oh hallelujah oh we are the most blessed people to be able to see these things oh the whole christian world is looking for a rapture to come and the bride of jesus christ is living in the rapture oh brother matthew you've gone too far now no sir because if you miss malachi 4 5 if you miss revelations 10 1-7 you will miss the rapture oh he said if you got the holy ghost it's the earnest well one thing i know if i've received the message and i got the holy ghost it's the earnest of the rapture so i'm going to let that word just keep unfolding in me one step at a time maybe this step is going to be raptured maybe this step is going to be rapture maybe this step's going to be raptured or this step we got to start living like we're walking in a rapture oh thank you jesus because in a moment in a twinkling of an eye one of these days i'm going to take my last step on this side of this dimension oh god help us to live like it help us to act like it faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god if there's a faith for the hour if there's a condition of the age then there has to be something to meet the condition of the age there has to be something to meet the challenge of the age why when we look into the scripture there in second timothy 3 it says oh this i also that this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own cells covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good i mean you're despised for just wanting to go in the bathroom that's properly labeled for you now i'm sorry i'm normal traders heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof revelations 3 17 because thou says time reach rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind and naked the world's in darkness it's groping in darkness oh a great darkness is upon the face of the earth and the prophet when he preached shalom he would say when reading isaiah 62 it says for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people the prophet said that's prophesying of the day that we are now living in and he goes on to talk about just how great darkness is upon the face of the earth now just like it was in the very beginning when god created the heavens and the earth but the earth was without form and the earth was void great darkness was upon the face of the earth but god had planted his seed there in the earth so there had to come a light to bring the seed to maturity there had to come a light to quicken the seed that was laying there in the earth light brings life no light no life light brings life as we mentioned that was me i was dead i was in sin i was in trespasses but there came a time that the light of god's word struck my soul and it quickened me to life jesus would say in john 12 46 i am come alive into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness peter would say but you are a chosen generation first peter 2 9-11 a royal priesthood a holy nation of peculiar people that you should show forth praises of him who have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in times past were not a people but are now the people of god oh i'm so thankful about it look i want to tell any young person in here if even if you're young or old one of the the tricks of the devil every time that you start to consider to give your heart to god and make a complete surrender there's this nervousness of what you're gonna do without the things that you've always depended on what am i gonna do with my time i spend this much time on social media i i have these friends over here and all of a sudden it'll create an anxiety because your whole life has been forged upon your five senses your whole life has been forged upon the things that can contact this earthly home but all of a sudden there's a call to your heart that says you have to die you gotta die to everything you gotta die to all of your thinking you gotta die out you gotta come to a place of total surrender where it means oh god if i gotta surrender all of my friends if i gotta surrender my education or if i get to surrender my job look friends you've got to come to the place where you're willing to do whatever it takes and die out luck stalk and barrel and come to jesus and say lord here i am i'm laying it all down you at your feet lord god if it means i'm going to lose my family if it means i'm going to lose my friends if it means i'm going to lose my job lord whatever it takes lord here i am and as soon as that word starts to deal with your heart and bring you to that place you you start to get all this anxiety and start to wonder what am i going to do with my time what am i going to do with my social media and i remember by the grace of god when the the day i got converted god gave me a best friend the same day i got converted yes the lord is our best friend but god truly gave me a body that same day that we've been best friends ever since i didn't have to look back and be like oh you know what what am i what group am i going to join how am i going to fit in look i'm telling you surrender and come to jesus there's a heavenly host waiting to receive you you got a family and friends around the world you can almost go anywhere in the world and stay rent free oh my go to europe call up some believers say hey i'm in town i want some fellowship you know what they'll do if the same spirit of god's within them they'll treat you like a brother and sister in jesus christ oh they'll be like oh man it's so good to meet you they'll take you in they'll give you they'll give you their best oh countless times over and over and over uh a brother a precious brother that just started coming to our church that was one of the things he wasn't all about he's like my y'all just received me like i'm family i said brother you are family and the lord was dealing with his heart maybe to move away for a little bit and that was he was kind of uh you know uh uh wondering about that he's like well i just don't know if you know when i go over there if it's going to be the same it's like it's going to be the same go on over there and find out oh when you meet the family of god when you meet the bride of jesus christ it's not them it's christ in them that welcomes you with open arms he says which in times past we're not a people but now the people of god i'm so thankful to be a part of the family of god which have not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstained from freshly lust which war against the soul i don't want to belabor this point too much but he says here abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul he says i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims look you're not from here this world is not your home so there needs to be an accountability and a power in our lives where we're not entertaining the things of the world that we're abstaining from the the the lushly flesh the the lust of the flesh and not getting tangled up in those things because we're not from here we're from above but he says those things war against your soul now i know we've spent time on this before but it's not always it's things that are lawful that can war against your soul it's things that are taking away your time it might be lawful you know as i was thinking about this they war against the soul when you look into the scriptures when david was found in sin with bathsheba the scripture says it was at a time when kings go to war he sent job out and they i believe they killed the the amorites or the ammonites it says but david carried still in jerusalem it was at a time when kings went to war we're in a warfare church we're doing spiritual warfare but david at a time when kings go to war he stayed back maybe he got a little complacent and it was there in that maybe slawfulness or a time when kings would go to battle he wasn't acting like he was in war he wasn't acting like he was in battle he was out there on his porch surveying the land when the lust of his eye got hooked in them that was his downfall of time when kings go to war oh if he would have been about the father's business if he would have been living according to the time when kings go to war and often that's how we always get ourselves in trouble we forget that we're in a warfare it's those little things that you're allowing to do that are warring against your soul oh and i love that story because there david he gets himself in trouble you know what he wants to do he wants to cover up his mistake so he tells your eye hey you're right come on back home uh you know how's the war going you know how's everything going why why don't you eat a little bit you know oh i just i just i want to see how the war is going so he's updating he goes why why don't you go home why don't you go home and spend the evening with your wife and then we'll send you back out to the war and uriah you know there's only about three or four people that brother branham says that i want to shake their hand when i get on the other side and the prophet said when i get to heaven i want to shake your eyes hand because he looked at the king and said not soul my lord my lord joab's out there in battle the ark of god is out there in the battlefield far be it for me to go to the comfort of my own home while the people of god and the ark of god are out there on the battlefield and he laid there at the gate and slept i say oh god help me not to be slothful lord help me not to be slack it's it's things that might be lawful that we stay back that start to war against our soul and hear a man called on by his king and bidden to go to the comforts of his own home wouldn't even go take a break because his brothers were out there on the battlefield with the ark of god i said god help us to be vigilant help us to be sober minded help us to realize that we're in spiritual warfare colossians 3 2 says set your affections on things above and not on the things of the earth proverbs would say this in verse 30. say i went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding although it was all grown over and the thorns and the nettles covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down then i saw and considered it well and i looked upon it and received instruction yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep you know that reminded me of the sleeping virgin oh the lord tarries this coming i wonder if we're getting lulled to sleep i wonder if we feel like all the lord's tarried is coming i as i thought about this i i reminded of my own parents who when they listened to choosing of a bride they left everything they knew they grew up in san diego california but when they heard the word of the lord say oh city of los angeles and say it was going to be sunk they went and packed up all of their things and they got out of there that was some over 50 years ago you think they were going to find out what the next uh uh uh uh uh you know the the the new uh and improved electronic was you know they're going out my what better laptop can i get there was nothing else on their mind but leaving they were probably giving things away they were probably like we can't take it all with us they just wanted to get lighter to make their trip easier and i say family of god we need to have the science mindset where we're trying to get lighter because it's going home time we'll just try to move down the home stretch here really quick oh it's it's lamp trimming time church our la our lamps need to be burning bright and clear the prophet of god would say this and there's a man that can turn on the light he's speaking about the seed he says plant the weed out here so we're speaking about light the evening time light uh the rising of the sun he says plant the wheat out there and put it in a basement cover it all over it'll never bring forth anything because it can't there's no light there but as soon as light strikes it then it'll bring forth life if it's a germatized seed that's the same thing that's in the word see the word is god and when the light strikes it it brings the word to life again every age has always been that way so just stay with me for about 10 minutes and we'll close every age has had its message and every age has had a predestinated people there to receive it just as joshua and caleb received the message from the prophet moses that they would possess the promised land the prophet of god said the old crop all of them that doubted that word all of them that said we can't take it there's no way we could take it all of them died out because they didn't believe that word but there was two predestinated seed that were there to receive the message that moses took and it was those two believers that god used to fulfill the prophet's message [Music] so i want to use it as we close out this thought here just with that in your mind and proving his word the prophet says now i want you to notice he does it that way in every age so he just spoke about joshua and caleb using believers that believed the message to go into the promised land he says he does it that way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take believers oh my look friends all of these glorious promises about a body change all of these glorious promises about a rapture all of the glorious promises in the word of god he has to take believers oh god i let it be me lord i i i here i am lord jesus and then in order to have believers meet that word he's got to predestinate it to that age you see it he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age did you get it did you feel it did you see it do you understand that's what's happening today he's predestinated to this by his foreknowledge when he predestinated in malachi 4 it's going to happen and if he predestinated malachi 4 and it was going to happen and behold i sent you elijah you are the you that's been predestinated to receive the message now as we just close on this going back to our text now so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the son when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him oh my i was thinking about this oh dry bones hear ye the word of the lord how can dry bones here oh dry bones hear ye the word of the lord the only way they could hear the word is if those bones were predestined to hear that word it's not what the dry bones did the dry bones were just laying there in the valley and darkness but it said the god said to the prophet can these dry bones live he said thou knowest he said prophesy and then when he prophesied and said oh dry bones hear ye the word of the lord when god said that malachi 4 would sound in the last days he had to predestinate somebody to be here to receive the message because god only uses believers you were predestined to hear it oh thank you god it's not what the bones did it's what the word of the lord did it's not what you did it's what god did it's what malachi 4 5 did it's what the mighty angel did when he came down and called your name oh thank you jesus behold i send you elijah so you are predestinated to be here to receive the message of elijah now watch this in our text oh this is beautiful the next verse the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him and the redeemer shall come to zion now many times we stop there when we read isaiah 59 and just because there's a break to another chapter we stop there but i just want to read this now in closing if the musicians would come but if i can have your attention for this so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him and the redeemer shall come to zion and unto them that turn from the transgression and jacob saith the lord as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which i put in my mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seeds saith the lord from henceforth and forever arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall rise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee now when brother branham preaches shalom he says look look in this same promise right here he says you have light and you have darkness the prophet said he's come to a spot that he believes the people don't even know what they're doing it comes to a time where the human being has to look like become such a subject to evil it's a pathetic thing it seems like there's a shadow of darkness just covering over the people and pressing them oh my if we're ever seeing a shadow of darkness over the people but he said it's just like in the beginning when the light separated the light from the darkness the darkness is all heaped up to one side oh but arise and shine thy light has come he said look you have all the darkness you have all the light the light which sets perfectly zechariah 14 6 and it shall come to pass in that day that light shall not be that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be as one day which shall be known unto the lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening times it shall be light oh when the eve when the enemy comes in like a flood oh the spirit of god will raise up a standard the spirit of god would raise up the word and the word himself has risen upon you arise thy light has come it is the rising of the sun oh praise the lord let's stand oh the prophet said shalom peace don't be weary jesus is here his great light has come to us and we're so thankful for it oh hallelujah thank you jesus oh praise his holy name thank you jesus why don't we just lift our hands to him and give him praise why doesn't everybody just pray in their own way thank god for the message oh when the enemy would come in like a flood he didn't leave it to chance he didn't leave you on your own but he said i'll be with you even in you until the end god has come down himself when there is such great darkness upon the face of the earth arise and shine for thy light has come it is the rising of the sun this day this scripture is fulfilled oh thank you jesus [Music] darkness [Music] here i am [Music] here [Music] me [Music] is [Music] oh here i am

the claiming part god you said i'm gonna have rapturing faith i heard your word i believe i'm gonna have how i'm gonna have it i don't know but the accumulation of the word it's gonna build up and build up and one day we'll be out of here hallelujah that's our portion i believe oftentimes we look at ourselves we look at the natural like alberta was saying we get down and we think of ourselves
