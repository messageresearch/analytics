[28:19] [Music]
[28:22] we are not here looking back to history
[28:26] [Music]
[28:28] we are not praying to
[28:31] something that was
[28:35] a memory
[28:38] but we are calling upon a living person
[28:41] that is
[28:42] in our midst right now
[28:46] a life that's hid
[28:50] from the wise and prudent
[28:53] but it's revealed unto babes that such
[28:56] as would learn
[28:58] you said come unto me all ye that are
[29:00] heavy laden and burdened and i'll give
[29:02] you rest
[29:06] and to think father that you are
[29:09] actually here tonight
[29:13] because you said you would be here you
[29:16] said wherever two or three are gathered
[29:18] together
[29:19] that you'd be in our midst
[29:24] and in osea their age is so dark
[29:27] and and wicked that
[29:31] standing right in the midst
[29:34] we can't see you and you cautioned us
[29:38] that we would buy eye sap that we might
[29:42] see
[29:44] father we know that eye sab is the word
[29:46] of god
[29:48] that rolls back every cloud of darkness
[29:52] that reveals your living grace in your
[29:56] presence
[29:58] father we've come here tonight together
[30:00] those that have assembled out
[30:04] those father that are joined us by
[30:08] way of streamed this evening
[30:12] we asked father that you would make that
[30:15] isabel available to us
[30:16] this evening because you counseled us to
[30:20] seek it
[30:22] you counseled us to get gold the father
[30:26] that's been tried in fire
[30:28] to put on white raiment and to
[30:32] seek after i sat father we've come this
[30:36] evening to
[30:37] ask you to anoint our eyes
[30:41] anoint our hearts anoint our spirits
[30:45] may the riches of your word begin to
[30:49] move on our lives and cause an effect
[30:53] not a personal effect on our lives only
[30:56] father
[30:57] but in the lives of those that we come
[31:00] in contact with
[31:01] [Music]
[31:02] may every situation know that
[31:06] god has moved into their midst through
[31:08] his living bride
[31:10] we just asked father tonight that we
[31:12] could grow in you
[31:14] we ask these things because we're
[31:18] needy of them but we have a wonderful
[31:20] name to ask in
[31:22] the name of the lord jesus christ bless
[31:25] us father we pray
[31:26] in your name amen amen god bless you
[31:31] we take your bibles this evening and
[31:35] i believe we have i don't know maybe
[31:39] 25 30 people uh joining us by way of
[31:44] a live stream so we're always
[31:47] uh grateful for those that would
[31:51] come into our midst and
[31:54] by way of the stream i hope that we
[31:57] don't get too comfortable
[31:59] with that to where
[32:02] you know
[32:08] we we come to the place where we would
[32:10] rather
[32:12] stay home and instead of come to church
[32:15] you know
[32:16] it's pretty easy i have to admit i was
[32:19] out
[32:19] with my mother and so leslie and i went
[32:22] into the
[32:24] room down there and and watched it on
[32:27] on stream you know and uh
[32:30] it's just real easy to sit back on the
[32:33] couch and put your feet up
[32:35] you know what i mean and just kind of
[32:37] you know think about getting a cup of
[32:39] coffee and
[32:40] and kind of relaxing and and and
[32:43] that's good for an alternative but you
[32:46] don't want to fall in love with an
[32:47] alternative and that's sort of what we
[32:51] uh want to talk about tonight
[32:55] uh if i have a title i would call it uh
[32:59] looking
[33:00] to the supernatural solution
[33:03] looking to the supernatural solution so
[33:06] let's just turn in our bibles and
[33:08] and we want to
[33:11] uh just read uh uh
[33:15] just this scripture uh uh starting
[33:19] um in saint john the gospel of saint
[33:23] john
[33:24] the first chapter and we'll just read
[33:27] through the 13th
[33:29] verse and
[33:34] we'll just have this little time of
[33:37] fellowship
[33:38] tonight and um
[33:42] it's a little portion we're gonna
[33:45] fellowship around
[33:46] uh this evening by way of like a bible
[33:49] study
[33:50] i'll be in missouri this sunday
[33:54] saturday night and sunday at what we
[33:58] refer to as the fish fry meeting
[34:01] brother brown basically has just
[34:04] shortened his meeting up and
[34:06] is just doing a meeting for his
[34:08] congregation
[34:09] and a lot of people have asked us he
[34:11] says well are you going to have your
[34:13] meeting
[34:14] this in november yes but our meetings
[34:17] we're full with our people so we're
[34:21] having a meeting for us
[34:23] nobody else is invited
[34:27] you know what i mean if they show up
[34:28] we'll try to accommodate
[34:30] them but i'm sure that will fill the
[34:32] building and
[34:33] and have a good time so we've asked uh
[34:37] brother tom ray to come brother michael
[34:40] ray to come
[34:41] and brother murphy wong to come so
[34:44] we're trusting that they'll do it you
[34:47] can fly
[34:48] in and out of the united states but
[34:51] it's a little more difficult to
[34:56] drive across the border but so we're
[34:59] anticipating that
[35:00] they'll be able to do that brother tom
[35:03] just had
[35:04] foot surgery replaced his ankle and
[35:08] and helped him prove that and
[35:11] he told me he says well you know i don't
[35:13] know if i'll be able to
[35:14] to do it i said well brother tom the
[35:17] scripture says blessed is the feet
[35:19] of them that preach the gospel so i i
[35:22] said if you you've got to come preach
[35:24] the gospel because that's the
[35:25] best way to make that foot better so
[35:29] we're really looking forward to it but
[35:30] anyway that's just an update let's read
[35:32] the scripture says
[35:33] in the beginning was the word and
[35:36] the word was with god and the word was
[35:40] god
[35:41] and the same was in the beginning with
[35:44] god all things were made
[35:48] by him and without him was not
[35:51] anything made that was made
[35:54] now that's you okay
[35:58] you were made by him
[36:02] there was a man sent from god whose name
[36:04] was
[36:05] okay excuse me and in him was life
[36:09] and the life was the light of men
[36:13] and the light shineth in darkness and
[36:15] the darkness comprehendeth it
[36:17] not there was a man sent from god whose
[36:21] name was john
[36:23] the same came for a witness to bear
[36:26] witness
[36:27] of the light that all men through him
[36:30] might believe he is not that light
[36:34] but was sent to bear witness of that
[36:37] light
[36:39] that was a that was the true light
[36:42] which lighteth every man that cometh
[36:45] into the world
[36:47] he was in the world and the world was
[36:50] made by him
[36:51] and the world knew him not
[36:55] what a statement
[36:58] he came unto his own and his own
[37:02] received him not but as many
[37:05] as received him to them gave ye
[37:08] power to become the sons of god
[37:12] even to them that believe on
[37:15] his name which were born not of blood
[37:20] nor of the will of the flesh nor of
[37:24] the will of man but of
[37:27] god and the word was made flesh
[37:30] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[37:33] glory
[37:34] the glory as the only begotten of the
[37:37] father
[37:38] full of grace and truth
[37:41] amen god bless you may be seated
[37:51] we're going to i'm going to just speak a
[37:55] few words and then
[37:57] i want to play
[38:01] seven minutes this evening
[38:04] out of the message perfect
[38:07] faith and
[38:11] these seven minutes
[38:14] you could preach a lifetime on
[38:18] i i just think as you begin
[38:22] to think about this as we're going to
[38:26] listen to it
[38:27] it becomes the answer to all of our
[38:31] problems
[38:33] and we we realize
[38:36] that we are
[38:40] going to have to have faith
[38:44] faith is the most important
[38:47] part of a christian's life
[38:51] because without faith it's impossible
[38:55] to please god so it
[38:58] it becomes uh
[39:01] uh as as we will listen it
[39:05] it becomes something that god is
[39:08] looking to you to have
[39:11] so you you've got to have it it it is a
[39:16] characteristic if i could say it
[39:18] that way it is an identification
[39:22] of what a believer is
[39:25] you can't say that you're a believer and
[39:28] not have faith
[39:30] you you understand so that's basically
[39:33] what the uh word stands for
[39:37] is that that that you have faith
[39:40] that you've received him
[39:44] and if those who have received him
[39:47] he gave them power to be the sons
[39:50] and daughters of god and
[39:53] uh that that if i could use
[39:57] that term and put it into
[40:00] practical sense that my
[40:04] sons and my daughter
[40:07] have a special privilege
[40:10] being my children and i know i get in a
[40:14] lot of trouble
[40:15] because of that because of my office
[40:18] but to my sons and my daughter they know
[40:22] that they can come to their father
[40:26] and sometimes they extend that
[40:30] a privilege and that relationship
[40:34] maybe into areas that it doesn't belong
[40:36] sometimes you know i
[40:38] i love my my granddaughter
[40:41] and i i appreciate i know she gets
[40:44] embarrassed when i
[40:45] i i i tell this little story
[40:48] but it it it it reflects
[40:52] the the privilege that she felt
[40:55] so you have to understand when he says
[40:57] he gave him power to become
[40:59] sons and daughters in other words he
[41:02] empowered them to have a privilege
[41:05] and an access to the throne
[41:08] that not everybody has it's a privilege
[41:12] in other words you'll know that a father
[41:15] and a mother
[41:16] they they put their children first
[41:20] okay and i don't care if their kids are
[41:22] dead wrong
[41:24] you are going to get a defense
[41:28] right it's just how it is
[41:31] they're going to give an explanation
[41:33] they're going to give a reason
[41:35] they're going to they're going to tell
[41:37] you why
[41:38] in fact they'll give you a life history
[41:40] of all the hardships the child has been
[41:43] through
[41:43] you know what i mean it's just that
[41:45] protective instinct
[41:47] of a parent so when you enter into this
[41:50] relationship
[41:51] this privilege like i was saying that
[41:54] you know
[41:56] little kaylee looked across at my the
[41:58] neighbor and said well i'll have you to
[42:00] know
[42:01] that my grandpa's the pastor
[42:07] and i thought well that's pretty good i
[42:09] kind of like that you know
[42:12] it it talked about a relationship and a
[42:16] privilege so
[42:17] we realized that we've got to be in this
[42:21] this atmosphere of faith because
[42:25] without faith it's impossible to please
[42:27] god
[42:28] and we have to have faith because the
[42:31] rapture
[42:32] is based upon this faith
[42:37] in other words the reason that
[42:40] the seals were opened and part
[42:44] of the reason that the seals were open
[42:46] was
[42:47] to reveal the son of perdition
[42:51] it was to show the two spirits
[42:55] coming down through the church ages
[42:59] because he knew that once we were able
[43:02] to identify the two spirits that were
[43:06] working
[43:07] in the framework of the church that we
[43:10] could resist the one
[43:12] and then when we are able to resist that
[43:15] spirit now resist means to stop
[43:18] the influence of that spirit over us
[43:22] because remember the whole purpose of
[43:25] the
[43:26] antichrist spirit is to do one thing how
[43:28] many know what it is
[43:29] to discredit the word of god another
[43:33] word
[43:33] to make the promises of god of
[43:36] none effect that caulk he wanted to do
[43:40] that's why he got on that first horse
[43:42] rider
[43:43] and began to lie to the church because
[43:45] he
[43:46] wanted to take him away what did he get
[43:48] him to do he got him to lose their what
[43:51] first love to hold back
[43:54] that's real important so he he he
[43:57] destroyed that and then
[43:58] he moved up to the next horse
[44:01] right and so when he got on that horse
[44:04] he started using fear
[44:08] he took the love away is that correct
[44:11] and and there's only two forces right
[44:13] love and
[44:15] fear so he took the once he got rid of
[44:18] the love
[44:19] now he could impose his will by fear
[44:22] because what did he do he went and
[44:23] killed everybody that disagreed with him
[44:26] everybody that stood up he began to do
[44:28] it in fear
[44:29] and then once he could he did away with
[44:31] that he brought him
[44:32] into darkness and they brought into
[44:36] darkness
[44:37] and then he went when he became
[44:40] a pale horse that was a horse of
[44:43] confusion
[44:44] so what did he do he took the faith
[44:47] and he broke it up into hundreds of
[44:50] different
[44:51] denominations hundreds of different
[44:54] interpretations
[44:55] hundreds and different avenues and roads
[44:59] to try to get to the same place and so
[45:02] here's a purse people
[45:04] not knowing which way to turn praise god
[45:07] there was some eagles in the chicken
[45:09] yard
[45:11] amen they didn't know what they were
[45:14] but they knew they weren't chickens they
[45:17] knew
[45:18] they weren't satisfied with the scratch
[45:20] they knew they weren't satisfied
[45:22] with the atmosphere they knew they went
[45:25] from chicken coop to chicken coop to
[45:27] chicken coop
[45:29] but they were adrift and they were
[45:31] wandering the prophet god said
[45:33] it's just like you you stumble from
[45:35] church to church
[45:36] and then you stumbled upon this
[45:40] because so when we realized that he came
[45:44] and when he exposed that when the seals
[45:47] opened up
[45:48] and exposed the son of perdition exposed
[45:51] the denominational spirit
[45:53] exposed how the deception
[45:57] was there and then he was to turn
[46:00] our hearts back to
[46:04] the faith of our fathers
[46:08] that's what that's what it was so what's
[46:11] supposed to be restored back to us
[46:14] is the faith so what opened up when them
[46:17] seals opened up the what was contained
[46:21] when the thunders uttered their voices
[46:23] and the seals were
[46:24] opened up what was contained in those
[46:27] was
[46:28] rapturing faith was faith now we
[46:32] so we're understanding that we've got to
[46:36] have that
[46:37] faith because the rapture is a
[46:39] supernatural event
[46:43] the rapture is and the prophet of god
[46:46] said this
[46:46] he's if they see if i could just uh
[46:50] read it to you real quick so you can
[46:52] understand
[46:54] that the rapture is a condition
[46:58] he said this so when a man lives by
[47:01] faith
[47:02] and walks by faith i mean substance
[47:06] faith he is isolated from the entire
[47:09] world
[47:11] and becomes a new creature in christ
[47:14] there now you're getting into bride
[47:17] material see
[47:19] you're getting into rapturing condition
[47:23] now so do you understand it and i know
[47:26] the
[47:26] denominational world and everybody has
[47:29] has
[47:30] preached it like a time table
[47:33] but when they ask jesus give us the time
[47:36] table
[47:38] he said that's for the father to decide
[47:41] so it's for the father to decide
[47:45] when his children have got
[47:48] into the condition that he can rapture
[47:51] them
[47:54] you understand that this is just a
[47:57] sunday school on wednesday night
[48:02] it's all right with you so
[48:05] you you have to understand so this
[48:07] determination
[48:10] is based on
[48:13] the father's recognition
[48:18] of a people possessing
[48:22] faith enough faith to be raptured
[48:28] okay he's provided everything he he we
[48:31] need
[48:32] the number one thing he provided for us
[48:35] is the shed blood at calvary
[48:37] that covers all of our sins
[48:41] and he made a covenant that if you
[48:44] confess
[48:44] your sins that he's faithful and just to
[48:47] forgive him
[48:48] amen your sin only stays with you
[48:51] as long as it's unconfessed it only has
[48:55] effect on you as long as it's
[48:58] unconfessed
[48:59] but once it's confessed and placed under
[49:03] the shed blood it's thrown in the sea of
[49:06] god's forgetfulness
[49:07] to be remembered no more hallelujah
[49:11] i need the blood that's the only place
[49:15] that god will meet you
[49:17] is under the shed blood the sacrifice
[49:20] that he made for you
[49:21] so he's got the hip the determination
[49:25] is made by him the father knoweth the
[49:28] time
[49:28] in the hour no man knows that
[49:32] i mean people get burned out
[49:35] looking at the world and trying to
[49:38] create a calendar
[49:40] you can't put a supernatural
[49:43] eternal people in a man-made calendar
[49:49] their life doesn't even come from there
[49:53] and that's why this message didn't just
[49:56] bring us back to
[49:57] calvary it brought us back to in the
[50:01] beginning
[50:02] it brought us all the way back and
[50:05] brought our origin all the way back
[50:07] so now what he's trying to do is to get
[50:11] us
[50:11] into rapturing condition
[50:15] and he says in order to get into that
[50:18] rapturing condition
[50:21] we're going to have to have substance
[50:23] faith
[50:24] so we're going to have to have faith
[50:27] because the rapture is based on faith
[50:30] and the rapture is a supernatural
[50:34] event based on
[50:37] condition so that's what we're talking
[50:40] about tonight
[50:40] is looking to the supernatural solution
[50:44] and and this is what happens to us
[50:48] is we've always been taught and i talked
[50:51] with you on this before but we've always
[50:54] kind of been taught
[50:56] that god is the last resort
[51:01] after we've tried every other option
[51:05] then we turn to the lord
[51:09] and and it it's kind of uh
[51:13] a last resort
[51:17] you know in in instead of
[51:20] uh it it being
[51:24] uh the first option
[51:27] it becomes the last option
[51:31] and and and so we're going to uh
[51:34] i'm going to go ahead and speak this
[51:35] little next section to you and
[51:38] and and then you can listen to this and
[51:41] we'll finish
[51:41] up but so we we want to understand
[51:45] that this faith
[51:49] that we have
[51:52] is based on something
[51:56] faith has a resting place
[51:59] we know that faith final resting place
[52:02] is the word of god faith final resting
[52:06] place
[52:07] is not the doctrines
[52:11] and the teaching that men have
[52:14] summarized from reading the
[52:18] bible
[52:21] faith is based on what he
[52:25] said to you
[52:30] faith is personal there's not a general
[52:34] faith that we all obtain to
[52:39] faith is personal it's a
[52:42] personal relationship
[52:45] because that what faith is
[52:49] and and we will listen to this in a
[52:52] moment
[52:53] that faith is is based on love
[52:58] love and faith go hand in hand
[53:01] so if we want to have faith
[53:05] then we've got to understand what
[53:08] it is that creates this faith
[53:13] and it's not exercise
[53:18] you know and and we because
[53:21] exercise and others rituals and
[53:24] ceremonies
[53:25] they profit very little there's a more
[53:28] substance a relationship
[53:32] that takes place that builds faith
[53:35] and if i could say it like this it's
[53:37] like in a marriage
[53:40] a relationship of some sort if you look
[53:43] at
[53:44] the troubles and you look at
[53:49] the finances and you look at
[53:52] the bills and and you start looking at
[53:55] the
[53:56] kids and what you have and what you
[53:59] don't have
[54:00] you will grow apart
[54:04] you'll just do it
[54:08] so and i'm i want you to
[54:12] listen to this when you
[54:15] we all together listen to this seven
[54:17] minutes
[54:18] this seven minutes is extremely
[54:21] extremely powerful
[54:24] it says but you've got to concentrate on
[54:27] the love
[54:29] that you have okay that is
[54:33] what that you've got to concentrate on
[54:36] if the love you have one for another
[54:40] you could that has got that's what
[54:42] overpowers
[54:43] all the circumstances that what's
[54:45] overpowers everything else
[54:48] if you can if you can enkindle that
[54:51] love that if you can remember that love
[54:53] if you can bring that
[54:54] love back to the surface and that
[54:57] creates that union
[54:59] and that unity then you've got the
[55:02] nucleus of what you started out with all
[55:06] the trouble was just added
[55:08] it wasn't added by you
[55:12] it was added by everything around you
[55:15] but it should never affect
[55:18] the very substance that brought you
[55:22] together
[55:23] in the first place now hold that thought
[55:27] to when we talk about our relationship
[55:31] with him so you've got to concentrate
[55:35] on the love you have
[55:40] that's what you've got to put your
[55:41] emphasis on that's what you've got to
[55:43] put your
[55:44] concentration on because i want the
[55:47] prophet's going to just lay this out to
[55:49] us
[55:49] i mean it's so powerful
[55:53] that it's it's just
[55:57] it just becomes something because faith
[56:00] grows by love
[56:04] that that is the substance of faith
[56:08] and and and and he also makes this
[56:10] statement in there
[56:12] it says won't his love take care of you
[56:16] so we're talking about this
[56:19] faith that we have to have because
[56:22] without
[56:23] perfect love and without perfect
[56:26] faith we will not be there so
[56:30] now we know something that we have to
[56:33] have
[56:36] okay we totally 100 percent
[56:40] know something that we have to have
[56:46] and we want to
[56:51] know how do we get that
[56:55] if what happens to us is
[56:59] we avoid that and we
[57:03] look to carnal solutions
[57:07] people find themselves in a spot where
[57:10] they have to have money
[57:14] and what happens i don't care what it is
[57:17] that's causing
[57:19] the want for money or the need for money
[57:24] but they turn to all kinds
[57:27] of carnal realities
[57:31] to get it they steal
[57:36] they cheat they rob god
[57:42] i'll just say that you know i don't
[57:44] preach a lot
[57:45] on money but you might take heed do your
[57:48] own
[57:49] personal study they go to
[57:52] all kinds of options
[57:56] instead of seeking a supernatural
[57:59] solution
[58:03] instead of turning to a supernatural
[58:06] solution and we've got to understand
[58:09] that
[58:10] in our lives we have an unseen force
[58:13] that's with us and that unseen force
[58:16] that's with us
[58:18] is the love of god
[58:21] god so loved us he gave us only begotten
[58:24] son
[58:26] god is love and so
[58:29] even in building the statue of a perfect
[58:32] man
[58:33] to when we come to that what the holy
[58:35] spirit leads us
[58:37] into is into that capstone
[58:40] which gives this love so this next seven
[58:43] minutes
[58:44] is the capstone ministry
[58:48] if we could catch it it's okay
[58:52] it it it's important to us
[58:56] because we what we do
[58:59] is we get in to a
[59:03] relationships and into situations
[59:06] where our are for some reason
[59:13] we turn our eyes on ourselves so much
[59:17] that we get this attitude maybe we're
[59:20] not worthy
[59:21] to seek a supernatural solution
[59:24] or we don't have faith to
[59:29] seek the supernatural solution
[59:32] it's not number one it's not the number
[59:35] one
[59:36] solution on our list it becomes an
[59:39] alternative
[59:40] solution it it it it's
[59:44] it it takes final desperation
[59:48] to put us there but the reason god
[59:51] allows the desperation to force you to
[59:54] that place
[59:55] is so you can have the experience
[59:58] and then after you've had the experience
[1:00:00] it it ought to be a lesson enough to you
[1:00:03] not to take the desperation route again
[1:00:06] how many times do you have to take the
[1:00:07] wrong turn
[1:00:10] i mean how many times have i missed the
[1:00:12] expressway exit
[1:00:15] coming 35 north and end up on 8
[1:00:18] 20 or end up over here or end up on this
[1:00:21] you know you think when are you going to
[1:00:23] learn
[1:00:23] not to make the wrong turn
[1:00:27] and i put that in carnal uh perspective
[1:00:30] in a carnal example because what's
[1:00:33] happening in our lives we're rolling
[1:00:35] through these things
[1:00:36] every day in our life if we don't even
[1:00:40] realize
[1:00:40] what the father is observing from the
[1:00:43] outside
[1:00:44] when he's looking at you
[1:00:47] he's sitting there waving his hand if
[1:00:50] you
[1:00:51] he's not fretting or nothing but he's
[1:00:53] sitting there saying hey
[1:00:56] children what about me
[1:01:00] what about me i promised you i'd never
[1:01:03] leave you nor forsake you i promised you
[1:01:06] you would never bake bread
[1:01:10] i i promised that i wouldn't give you
[1:01:14] a stone
[1:01:19] i wouldn't give you a serpent
[1:01:23] i know what you have need of even before
[1:01:27] you ask he he's he's made
[1:01:30] all these beautiful promises to us
[1:01:34] and all these whispers of love to us
[1:01:38] and of caring to us and
[1:01:41] he he's he's done all these things he
[1:01:44] said i'll not leave you
[1:01:45] nor forsake you i mean when you sit back
[1:01:49] this beautiful
[1:01:50] the one-sided
[1:01:54] love affair that's going on
[1:01:58] and here we are sitting in
[1:02:02] our world with
[1:02:06] the waves of uncertainty
[1:02:10] and confusion blowing in on us
[1:02:14] i see it i watch it i watch
[1:02:17] people want the pressure so bad on them
[1:02:20] that they want to make a change in their
[1:02:22] life
[1:02:24] they think moving here going here is
[1:02:27] going to make life better
[1:02:28] no it's not whatever you do
[1:02:32] get thus saith the lord
[1:02:35] don't take it from some second hand
[1:02:38] disconnect
[1:02:39] person that's gonna come along i think
[1:02:43] it's the lord's will you do this
[1:02:44] i think it's the lord's will do this but
[1:02:47] you you know could that just exactly
[1:02:49] what happened in the scriptures
[1:02:50] some said he was the christ and they
[1:02:53] went out in the desert here and somebody
[1:02:55] said the christ is over here
[1:02:56] and they went out of there some people
[1:02:59] said this is the anointing and that's
[1:03:01] the anointing
[1:03:02] and you you want to know something if
[1:03:04] you've got something in your heart that
[1:03:06] you believe
[1:03:07] and it doesn't line up with the word of
[1:03:09] god you're going to seek for an
[1:03:11] amen from somewhere
[1:03:16] you've got to be solid
[1:03:19] in god's word
[1:03:22] and that that solidness is
[1:03:26] based on him
[1:03:30] making you by receiving him
[1:03:34] and when you receive him what are you
[1:03:36] receiving
[1:03:37] you're receiving the love of the father
[1:03:43] that's what it is now when we listen to
[1:03:45] this
[1:03:46] listen closely
[1:03:49] because he's going to start out with
[1:03:51] being the master of every circumstance
[1:03:54] now he's going to go into how you can
[1:03:56] become a master
[1:03:57] of every circumstance and where does
[1:04:01] this perfect faith come from
[1:04:07] it's initiated by him and he wants you
[1:04:11] to have this faith
[1:04:13] but there's only one thing that will
[1:04:15] make that
[1:04:16] faith grow let's just listen to this
[1:04:19] seven minutes
[1:04:20] and because i could try to preach
[1:04:24] and explain until my lips are blue
[1:04:28] and i'll never be able to say it the way
[1:04:31] he can say it
[1:04:33] so let's just listen for a moment i
[1:04:35] think you'll really be blessed
[1:04:37] now so what i'm ask point wanting to
[1:04:40] point
[1:04:40] out to you is that love
[1:04:45] is the creator of faith
[1:04:52] you don't look at the results look at
[1:04:55] the
[1:04:56] relationship concentrate
[1:04:59] on the love
[1:05:03] and when you concentrate on the love and
[1:05:06] you enter into that love
[1:05:08] and you enter into that relationship and
[1:05:11] you
[1:05:11] recognize that and you have that
[1:05:14] the result of the relationship
[1:05:18] is faith faith does not produce the love
[1:05:23] love produces the faith
[1:05:27] and this just list is marvelous and it
[1:05:30] brother brown
[1:05:31] puts it right in the middle of perfect
[1:05:33] faith
[1:05:34] he talks about the substance he talks
[1:05:36] about the faith
[1:05:37] he talks about what jesus does and then
[1:05:39] he takes this seven minutes
[1:05:42] to talk about the love
[1:05:46] and then after he talks about the love
[1:05:49] he
[1:05:49] goes into abiding
[1:05:53] in that love staying in that love but
[1:05:55] let's just take
[1:05:56] the relationship part of it this evening
[1:06:00] and i really believe
[1:06:01] this will all help us move down the road
[1:06:05] to the supernatural because if we can't
[1:06:08] experience
[1:06:09] the supernatural results of the
[1:06:11] attributes
[1:06:13] remember the attributes causes the works
[1:06:16] then how are we going to move into
[1:06:18] absolutely a faith
[1:06:20] that's going to allow your body to be
[1:06:22] changed
[1:06:24] and for you to step from one dimension
[1:06:27] to another
[1:06:29] we've got to confront that head on god
[1:06:31] bless you i believe you really enjoy
[1:06:33] this
[1:06:42] perfect faith is the master of all
[1:06:45] circumstances
[1:06:47] perfect faith masters all circumstances
[1:06:50] no matter what it is
[1:06:52] it masters it now just watch when you
[1:06:55] believe
[1:06:55] anything do anything and you got faith
[1:06:58] in what you're doing no matter what the
[1:06:59] circumstances that don't have one thing
[1:07:01] to do with it
[1:07:02] it masters that circumstance if it's in
[1:07:05] a
[1:07:06] room of sickness and a large reveal that
[1:07:08] this certain thing is going to happen
[1:07:10] you just speak it and belong all right
[1:07:13] just don't ask any questions it's
[1:07:14] already over just keep going
[1:07:16] it masters all circumstances amen well
[1:07:19] if you do this
[1:07:20] uh sword sword sort of that thing that
[1:07:22] already got it mastered
[1:07:24] me faith please that god will work it
[1:07:26] out i don't know how it's going to do it
[1:07:27] but do it anyhow
[1:07:28] it matters all circumstances and faith
[1:07:32] and love is relation
[1:07:35] because you can't have faith unless
[1:07:37] you've got love
[1:07:38] because your faith is in a god who is
[1:07:40] the very essence of love
[1:07:43] faith and love works together you're
[1:07:45] just like a young couple
[1:07:47] you take a young man a young woman and
[1:07:50] they
[1:07:50] fall in love with one another and as
[1:07:52] they go along and begin to know one
[1:07:54] another more
[1:07:55] their hearts just being defeated as one
[1:07:57] see
[1:07:58] they're yet they're not husband and wife
[1:08:00] but their love binds them together and
[1:08:02] they have confidence in one another
[1:08:04] now if they really love one another
[1:08:06] really love
[1:08:08] and you know that this girl loves you
[1:08:10] and
[1:08:11] and she knows that you love her you've
[1:08:14] got confidence
[1:08:15] faith in one another right you got faith
[1:08:18] in one
[1:08:19] if you didn't you better not marry me
[1:08:21] notice you gotta have faith and you
[1:08:23] separate them about one extreme south
[1:08:25] one extreme north they steal that love
[1:08:27] beachborne no matter where they're at
[1:08:30] they're just as true to one another as
[1:08:31] they can be because they
[1:08:33] love one another and if you love the law
[1:08:37] it's not trying to dodge hell but you
[1:08:40] love the law then you have faith in god
[1:08:44] if you love him like a a young girl
[1:08:48] just happened here in louisville not all
[1:08:50] a woman
[1:08:51] she was uh she's been a christian for
[1:08:53] many years
[1:08:54] but her husband had just fell in love
[1:08:56] she fell over this man
[1:08:58] he had been a christian a couple of
[1:08:59] years and so
[1:09:01] they got married they loved had
[1:09:03] confidence in one another
[1:09:04] and they got married and so the woman
[1:09:07] said to the man says
[1:09:08] hubby it must be hard on you you're just
[1:09:11] a young christian
[1:09:12] you've had so much to go through with
[1:09:13] drinking what it was that you've had so
[1:09:15] much to go through with and said
[1:09:17] i know you're about to be tempted
[1:09:18] awfully hard and said i want you to know
[1:09:20] one thing now
[1:09:22] now if you happen to fall if you happen
[1:09:24] to to fall into temptation
[1:09:26] and as overcome don't stay away from
[1:09:29] home
[1:09:30] you come on back you come right here
[1:09:32] because i'm gonna be right here waiting
[1:09:34] for you
[1:09:35] and i'm gonna help you praise you again
[1:09:37] until you get victory
[1:09:39] i'm gonna stay with you because when i
[1:09:41] married you
[1:09:42] i married you because i loved you
[1:09:46] no matter what you are i still love you
[1:09:50] two days i said he was eating his lunch
[1:09:51] with the fellas down in the boiling room
[1:09:53] he was telling them about so now how
[1:09:55] could a man ever do anything wrong when
[1:09:57] somebody knows you like that
[1:09:59] there you are how could you trespass
[1:10:02] that confidence
[1:10:03] and when we were sinners
[1:10:07] alienated without god in the world and
[1:10:10] that
[1:10:10] muck of mud as i talked about this
[1:10:12] morning god
[1:10:14] come to us am i
[1:10:17] god sought you you never saw god
[1:10:20] no man can come to me except the father
[1:10:22] draws you first
[1:10:24] and god came down in that muck watch you
[1:10:27] were
[1:10:29] and sought you out and brought you out
[1:10:34] that was a creator of perfect love
[1:10:37] look what you were and look what you are
[1:10:42] what did that somebody that loves you
[1:10:46] can't you have faith in what he's
[1:10:48] promised you this
[1:10:49] [Music]
[1:10:51] real genuine love will create a
[1:10:53] confidence in his word
[1:10:55] he caught me when i was nothing i was
[1:10:58] still nothing but i'm in his hands
[1:11:00] he called me and he loved me when i was
[1:11:03] unlovable he loved you when he was
[1:11:05] unlovable
[1:11:06] but he changed you yeah it's like the
[1:11:09] colored sister said that time in her
[1:11:10] testimony
[1:11:11] she said i'm not what i ought to be
[1:11:14] and i'm not what i want to be and then
[1:11:18] i'm not what i used to be
[1:11:19] she knows she'd come somewhere something
[1:11:22] happened
[1:11:23] and that's the way it is if god
[1:11:27] when i was an alien from him so wealthy
[1:11:29] till he stood down to get me and pick me
[1:11:31] up
[1:11:32] that gives me confidence that he wants
[1:11:34] to use me
[1:11:36] he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen
[1:11:39] something
[1:11:40] in me he sees something in you he had a
[1:11:43] reason to save you
[1:11:44] look at the people don't say it today
[1:11:47] look at the minions he could have tucked
[1:11:48] beside you
[1:11:49] but he took you amen
[1:11:53] no one can take your place amen you're
[1:11:56] in god's economy amen
[1:11:58] no one can do it that's his love to you
[1:12:00] then won't your love reach that back to
[1:12:02] him
[1:12:03] and there's a love affair no matter what
[1:12:07] the situation is it's circumstances
[1:12:10] it's governed by this love and creates
[1:12:12] faith
[1:12:14] that god loves you and you love god and
[1:12:16] you love one another
[1:12:18] and that brings to faith all right then
[1:12:21] it can't it can't keep from
[1:12:23] uh bringing out just exactly what god
[1:12:26] promised
[1:12:26] it would do now watch perfect faith
[1:12:30] is pure just as pure as love is
[1:12:33] see now when you love somebody and you
[1:12:36] got
[1:12:36] you love your husband or you love your
[1:12:38] wife now there's no need of anybody
[1:12:40] telling you you don't do it
[1:12:43] because you do do it and you know
[1:12:46] you do it now if i've asked you
[1:12:50] uh how can you improve you do it
[1:12:53] well i'll prove it by the way i'll
[1:12:55] answer it see
[1:12:57] i'm a true honest wife i'm a loyal
[1:13:00] honest husband
[1:13:01] and that proves to me that i and i love
[1:13:04] my wife or i love my husband
[1:13:05] see that your life proves what you are
[1:13:08] the same thing christianity does amen
[1:13:10] see
[1:13:11] your faith you have confidence in one
[1:13:14] another is fewer
[1:13:16] and it's something real that you can't
[1:13:18] show it to somebody else yet you got it
[1:13:20] and your actions proven and when you got
[1:13:23] pure
[1:13:24] unadulterated faith like your love is to
[1:13:28] your companions
[1:13:29] then you prove it by the way you act
[1:13:33] you ain't complaining no more you know
[1:13:36] it's done
[1:13:37] just walk along no matter what the thing
[1:13:39] looks like what anybody else says you
[1:13:40] know what's happening
[1:13:42] you know that it's finished just as well
[1:13:45] as you know you love your husband
[1:13:47] as long as you know you love see love
[1:13:49] and faith has to go together they're kin
[1:13:51] folks they love love produces faith
[1:14:05] we just listen to the whole key
[1:14:10] the whole key
[1:14:13] you know we we spend and that's what i
[1:14:15] said
[1:14:16] looking for a supernatural solution
[1:14:20] we look to the results we look to a
[1:14:23] product
[1:14:24] we look to everything he says you don't
[1:14:26] have to
[1:14:27] look at anything else but the very
[1:14:31] fact that he stooped down in
[1:14:34] the muck and got you
[1:14:38] that was his love when you were
[1:14:41] unlovable
[1:14:42] he loved you when when
[1:14:45] when uh when uh uh
[1:14:50] you were down in the muck he
[1:14:54] went in there now he said
[1:14:57] if he loved you that much
[1:15:00] now just think about it now
[1:15:04] and he said those that receive him
[1:15:09] he gave power
[1:15:14] to become the sons and daughters of god
[1:15:17] so god so
[1:15:18] loved the world he was the expression
[1:15:22] of the love of god we know that god
[1:15:26] loves us
[1:15:27] john says and you can go read it herein
[1:15:29] is the love of god made perfect
[1:15:31] we know that god loves us because he
[1:15:34] sent us
[1:15:35] his only begotten son so we we unders
[1:15:39] we understand that that and he said that
[1:15:42] that we never chose him he chose us look
[1:15:45] at all the millions he
[1:15:46] he didn't choose now so here we're
[1:15:49] looking for this abundant faith
[1:15:52] we're looking for this faith that's
[1:15:54] going to produce the power
[1:15:56] and the demonstration of the
[1:15:58] resurrection because we know if we don't
[1:16:00] start
[1:16:01] experiencing the supernatural
[1:16:07] in our lives then the supernatural
[1:16:10] becomes
[1:16:11] a fantasy it becomes a myth
[1:16:17] but this faith is real substance faith
[1:16:22] which means it's really real and that
[1:16:25] only comes from a real substance
[1:16:28] love that's really real
[1:16:32] he and that's what he says you you you
[1:16:35] know you love him nobody has to explain
[1:16:37] anything to you you don't have to prove
[1:16:38] it to nobody
[1:16:39] you know that you love him
[1:16:43] and what is the key to that scripture we
[1:16:46] love him because
[1:16:48] he first loved us
[1:16:53] oh if we could settle that in our heart
[1:16:58] well we were yet sinners
[1:17:01] wasn't based on our righteousness it
[1:17:03] wasn't based on anything
[1:17:05] it was based on election
[1:17:09] he's seen something in you what did he
[1:17:12] see in you
[1:17:14] that little kinsman part that little
[1:17:17] seed
[1:17:19] so this is what i'm saying let's just
[1:17:21] read this
[1:17:22] again and listen to how beautiful it is
[1:17:25] then won't your love reach right
[1:17:29] back to him
[1:17:33] now we're talking about a supernatural
[1:17:36] solution
[1:17:38] so won't your love you're in trouble
[1:17:43] you're sick
[1:17:46] you're you're in financial straits
[1:17:50] you're in the valley of decision you're
[1:17:53] under a lot of pressure
[1:17:55] you you don't know where where to turn
[1:17:58] you don't know what to do you've got an
[1:18:00] airing child you've got
[1:18:02] someone that's being drawn away by the
[1:18:04] world
[1:18:05] music's working on them you know
[1:18:09] maybe it goes classmates maybe class
[1:18:12] circumstances it just seems like things
[1:18:15] are getting out of control
[1:18:17] and you don't you just are entering into
[1:18:20] such a battleground
[1:18:23] well that's the time you've got to know
[1:18:25] he loves you
[1:18:29] well that's when your love's got to
[1:18:31] reach back out
[1:18:32] your love's got to reach to him you've
[1:18:35] got to know
[1:18:36] that you've received him you've accepted
[1:18:39] this love
[1:18:40] in your heart and he says now won't you
[1:18:42] reach for your love reach right back to
[1:18:44] him
[1:18:47] lord i know you'll take care of me
[1:18:52] you told me to come unto you if i get
[1:18:55] heavy laden
[1:18:57] you told me to seek a supernatural
[1:19:00] solution
[1:19:03] god is the supernatural
[1:19:06] how can he be supernatural because
[1:19:09] everything that was made was made by him
[1:19:13] and nothing nothing that was made
[1:19:16] all things that were made were made by
[1:19:20] him
[1:19:20] there's nothing it's just no me all
[1:19:23] things were made by him
[1:19:25] and without him was not anything made
[1:19:29] that was made
[1:19:33] what what what a source
[1:19:37] and that source of all creation
[1:19:41] chose to project his love
[1:19:46] into your life because he wants you to
[1:19:50] have
[1:19:50] confidence in that love
[1:19:54] well can't you have confidence in this
[1:19:56] love
[1:19:57] can't you have confidence in the love
[1:20:00] that he
[1:20:00] showed to you can't you have confidence
[1:20:03] in what he's done in your life
[1:20:05] can't you look at your life and see that
[1:20:07] you're not what
[1:20:08] you maybe you're not what you want to be
[1:20:10] okay but you and
[1:20:12] and you you know that and you know
[1:20:14] you're not what you're supposed to be
[1:20:16] but you know you're not what you used to
[1:20:18] be
[1:20:19] you know you've had the effect of that
[1:20:22] love in your life
[1:20:23] so this is what he's saying look for a
[1:20:25] supernatural solution
[1:20:30] the supernatural solution lies in the
[1:20:33] love
[1:20:36] that he projected to you
[1:20:39] that that that beautiful
[1:20:43] love that's there and won't your love
[1:20:46] reach right back to him
[1:20:48] and there's a love affair
[1:20:51] no matter what the situation is or the
[1:20:54] circumstances
[1:20:56] it's governed by this
[1:21:00] love that's why love's the master of
[1:21:04] every circumstance that's why faith the
[1:21:06] master of every circumstance
[1:21:08] because with this love affair you're not
[1:21:12] in it alone he's in it
[1:21:16] with you he's committed to you
[1:21:23] and didn't you hear him he said just
[1:21:25] like that wife
[1:21:28] she was committed to her husband
[1:21:33] i'm committed to you sweetheart if you
[1:21:36] fall
[1:21:37] don't you stay away you come home
[1:21:40] i married you because i love you
[1:21:47] that that's the confidence that that's
[1:21:51] the love
[1:21:52] because he says that it's governed
[1:21:55] by this love that creates
[1:21:59] faith you can't bypass the recipe
[1:22:05] you understand you can't you can't go
[1:22:09] try to take a promise somewhere
[1:22:13] and say i'm going to make this promise
[1:22:15] work
[1:22:19] or he said so
[1:22:23] now i want you to catch this because
[1:22:26] this
[1:22:26] is the interpretation of the scripture
[1:22:30] that says depart from me you doers of
[1:22:33] iniquity
[1:22:33] i never you knew you they had the signs
[1:22:38] and wonders
[1:22:39] without the love affair
[1:22:42] and it's the love affair that produces
[1:22:45] rapturing faith
[1:22:46] because remember the prophet of god said
[1:22:49] god will not
[1:22:50] allow his bride and who would put his
[1:22:53] bride
[1:22:53] through all that tribulation
[1:22:57] it's the very essence of what the
[1:23:00] rapture is
[1:23:02] the rapture is god's love
[1:23:06] for his bride and her
[1:23:09] love back to him having confidence
[1:23:13] that he is not going to let her go
[1:23:17] through this tribulation that's fixing
[1:23:19] to hit the earth
[1:23:20] and then she can look up with her
[1:23:23] confidence and her
[1:23:24] love because that loves what produces
[1:23:27] rapturing faith
[1:23:29] love creates the faith let's concentrate
[1:23:32] on the love
[1:23:39] faith comes it's a byproduct
[1:23:44] of love this love affair creates the
[1:23:48] faith
[1:23:50] it only comes love creates faith
[1:23:54] love creates promise confidence in every
[1:23:57] promise
[1:23:58] and that's why peter was able to write
[1:24:00] by these divine
[1:24:02] precious promises we are partakers
[1:24:05] of divine nature
[1:24:10] we bypass the love
[1:24:14] and that was that's what put them on the
[1:24:17] outside of the church
[1:24:20] was the love affair wasn't there the
[1:24:23] doctrine was there
[1:24:25] the promises were there
[1:24:28] everybody was trying to produce wool
[1:24:31] you look at a promise and you said this
[1:24:33] should be in my life
[1:24:34] forget that
[1:24:38] it's the love affair that should be in
[1:24:40] our lives
[1:24:42] and if you have that love affair with
[1:24:44] him

[1:25:13] caught you in the palm of my hand
[1:25:15] and nothing can pluck you out hallelujah
[1:25:19] i like that kind of that's the kind of
[1:25:21] person i want to have me
[1:25:24] that's what i want to be a part of
[1:25:25] that's what i want to know has got me
[1:25:28] amen that's that's what i'm looking
[1:25:31] i'm not concentrating on the trouble i'm
[1:25:34] concentrating on the love
[1:25:37] that's all i've got to concentrate on
[1:25:40] you concentrate on the love
[1:25:42] you'll have faith that's so powerful you
[1:25:45] can't express it
[1:25:47] that you won't even know you have it
[1:25:49] you're just in love
[1:25:50] these signs follow them that are in love
[1:25:56] that's what it's all about it's about
[1:25:59] getting our eyes off of
[1:26:01] everything but having him
[1:26:04] that love creates faith
[1:26:07] that god loves you and you
[1:26:10] love god and you love one another
[1:26:15] and that brings the
[1:26:20] faith
[1:26:25] you love one another you've got
[1:26:29] confidence in one another that brings
[1:26:32] the faith
[1:26:33] here we are beating the people with
[1:26:36] promises
[1:26:40] beating the people that we ought to have
[1:26:42] power
[1:26:43] beating the people that we should have
[1:26:45] works
[1:26:48] and the question is wait a minute
[1:26:52] where does this faith come from
[1:26:57] well people try to preach as the baptism
[1:27:00] of the holy spirit
[1:27:04] anointed ones at the end time kind of
[1:27:06] ruins that
[1:27:10] it comes from love
[1:27:14] and where does the love start we love
[1:27:17] him because
[1:27:20] first love does first love does first
[1:27:22] love die
[1:27:23] can you receive that if you can receive
[1:27:27] that
[1:27:28] he's given you the privilege
[1:27:34] oh he's giving you the privilege
[1:27:37] to walk in and open the refrigerator
[1:27:42] he's giving you the privilege to walk in
[1:27:45] and ask for a few dollars he's giving
[1:27:48] you the privilege to walk in
[1:27:50] and ask for what you have you're a son
[1:27:53] you're a daughter
[1:27:56] you know you're his you know he loves
[1:27:59] you
[1:28:00] that that's the essence in these little
[1:28:05] pages that we listen to page 19
[1:28:09] 20 and 21 and in
[1:28:12] in 22 he explains to us
[1:28:16] where faith comes from
[1:28:20] where it comes from it's created
[1:28:25] faith is created
[1:28:29] god loves you you love him
[1:28:32] you're in a love affair what do you
[1:28:34] think he's going to do
[1:28:38] if he loves you he's going to create
[1:28:42] in you rapturing faith
[1:28:47] it comes from the love affair it doesn't
[1:28:50] come from
[1:28:52] theology it doesn't come
[1:28:55] from the opening of the mysteries
[1:28:59] to your eyes you're barking up the wrong
[1:29:02] tree
[1:29:06] sorry concentrate
[1:29:11] on the love
[1:29:14] it creates a love affair concentrate
[1:29:19] on the love the love will
[1:29:22] produce the faith
[1:29:26] he says god loves you
[1:29:30] and you love him and you love one
[1:29:33] another
[1:29:35] and that brings the faith
[1:29:39] all right then it can't but it can't
[1:29:43] keep you from bringing out
[1:29:46] just exactly what god promised
[1:29:51] it would
[1:29:54] do what did
[1:29:57] it promise it would do
[1:30:01] if the same spirit that was in christ
[1:30:04] jesus
[1:30:05] in you it would quicken your mortal body
[1:30:08] the promise from the father is this
[1:30:11] i go to prepare a place for you
[1:30:16] and if i go a purple place for you i
[1:30:19] will come
[1:30:20] again and receive you
[1:30:23] that where i am you will be also
[1:30:27] thank you lord i have that promise
[1:30:30] doesn't that remind you of a story of a
[1:30:32] rancher
[1:30:35] huh and he promised the
[1:30:39] little girl she was just a cinderella
[1:30:42] type
[1:30:43] but he promised he'd come get for what

[1:30:53] loved him she knew she loved him no
[1:30:56] matter how far apart they were
[1:30:59] him in chicago her way down here

[1:31:34] good mother what did he look for he
[1:31:37] looked for that character
[1:31:39] and where did he find there where did he
[1:31:41] find her
[1:31:43] barefoot in a puddle of muddy
[1:31:46] dishwashing
[1:31:48] doing the dishes and when he approached
[1:31:52] her

[1:31:58] heart looked at that seed
[1:31:59] that character and began to beat for and
