[20:27] hey man turn around and shake the hand
[20:29] of somebody tell him god bless you tell
[20:31] him wake up
[20:33] amen
[20:50] good morning we're gonna
[20:52] look at psalm 22 this morning
[21:00] you know as we read this this morning
[21:01] it's uh
[21:04] it's hard not to read this chapter
[21:07] and think about
[21:10] that hour on a cross
[21:13] you know just
[21:14] outside of jerusalem
[21:17] where one was
[21:18] offered up
[21:21] and a debt was paid
[21:22] the sin question forever resolved
[21:26] reconciliation
[21:27] performed
[21:30] many of the verses that we're going to
[21:32] read here they show up again
[21:35] in fulfillment
[21:38] it's almost like a preview
[21:40] or a
[21:41] foreshadowing
[21:43] of a day that would one day play out on
[21:45] calvary
[21:47] you know verse 1 opens up with my god my
[21:50] god why hast thou forsaken me
[21:54] those are the very words used by jesus
[21:56] as he cried out
[21:58] in his final moments on the cross
[22:01] in matthew 27 46
[22:05] verse 7 describes one being left to
[22:07] scorn
[22:09] it's as they shake the head
[22:12] which is exactly how the scorners were
[22:14] described in matthew 27 39
[22:18] as they reviled him
[22:21] it says in verse 8 he trusted on the
[22:23] lord that he would deliver him
[22:26] let him deliver him
[22:28] seeing he delighted in him
[22:31] which is almost word for word what the
[22:33] scorners
[22:34] said of him in matthew 27 43.
[22:39] of course verses 14 to 18 describe
[22:42] you know a state of being poured out
[22:44] like water
[22:46] of being thirsty
[22:49] of every bone being accounted for
[22:52] and his garments being parted and
[22:54] gambled over
[22:56] it struck me as i was reading this
[22:59] how every aspect of the position that
[23:02] everything fell into place
[23:05] on that
[23:06] day had already been laid out in the
[23:09] word hundreds of years before it took
[23:11] place
[23:13] once the
[23:15] word was spoken
[23:17] it was just a matter of time before
[23:19] everything began to fall into place and
[23:21] assume its position
[23:23] as the word had
[23:25] spoken
[23:28] you know it it couldn't happen any other
[23:30] way
[23:31] you know once the word goes forth it
[23:33] begins to set in motion whatever chains
[23:36] of chain of events is necessary for
[23:38] things to take up the positions that the
[23:40] word has spoken of
[23:42] concerning them
[23:43] and so here several hundred years later
[23:46] as david is crying out word is going
[23:49] forth that is already beginning to set
[23:51] in motion
[23:52] a manifestation
[23:55] you know once that word goes forth
[23:58] all things find their place
[24:00] to line up with that
[24:02] word but what's interesting is when you
[24:05] read
[24:06] psalm 22 which we will hear in a minute
[24:10] david has no idea
[24:12] that he is speaking forth word that will
[24:14] ultimately play out
[24:16] on a hill hundreds of years later
[24:20] you know there's no mighty visitation
[24:22] from the lord where he rises up and says
[24:24] thus saith the lord and begins to
[24:28] he's trying to hear from the lord he's
[24:30] in a desperate hour he's in a dark hour
[24:32] he's surrounded and has run out of
[24:35] answers and run out of options and has
[24:36] been crying out to the lord and is
[24:38] hearing nothing
[24:39] to the point where he's like have you
[24:40] forsaken me
[24:43] you know it's interesting that it's out
[24:44] of that
[24:46] that the word is going forth
[24:51] in psalm 22 1-2 it just kind of shows
[24:53] you the desperation it says my god my
[24:55] god why hast thou forsaken me
[24:58] why are thou so far from helping me and
[25:00] from the words of my roaring
[25:03] oh my god i cry in the daytime but thou
[25:05] here is not
[25:07] and in the night season
[25:09] and i'm not silent
[25:11] so the very word which began to set
[25:13] things into motion and to position
[25:15] things for a day at calvary was spoken
[25:17] in an hour where he himself was trying
[25:19] to hear something from the lord
[25:21] he didn't even know that he was word was
[25:23] going forth out of his life as he's
[25:24] waiting to receive something for his
[25:26] need
[25:27] for his hour
[25:29] it didn't feel like word was being
[25:32] spoken by david it felt like he was in a
[25:34] forsaken in a desperate place
[25:38] but everything and everyone that had a
[25:41] part to play
[25:42] at that day at calvary could owe their
[25:44] position to what was spoken during that
[25:47] dark hour of desperation
[25:51] you know i got to
[25:53] thinking about that
[25:56] the whole time that david
[25:58] was waiting for a word from the lord to
[26:00] meet his need
[26:03] word was going forth out of his life
[26:06] that was setting in order
[26:08] putting things into position
[26:11] according to the word and he didn't even
[26:12] know it
[26:14] it made me wonder how many times
[26:17] do we find ourselves in an hour of need
[26:20] in an hour of desperation where we're
[26:22] crying out to the lord
[26:24] to hear an answer to get a visitation
[26:27] to be
[26:28] delivered of our circumstance
[26:30] and yet we have no idea what kind of
[26:32] word is pouring forth out of our life as
[26:34] we're going through that circumstance
[26:39] you know i wonder if david had not gone
[26:40] through that dark hour
[26:43] if the word had not been spoken that
[26:45] ultimately played out on calvary
[26:48] you know it says that in
[26:52] second corinthians 3 2-3 we are written
[26:54] epistles read of all men
[26:58] our lives if they are truly
[27:01] word and flesh are ordered of the lord
[27:04] in such a way
[27:05] so that his word is going forth out of
[27:08] our lives whether we know it or not even
[27:10] in our desperate hour
[27:14] you know and sometimes maybe we're not
[27:17] getting what we need
[27:19] when it seems like we need to hear from
[27:20] the lord because
[27:22] the word that our life needs to speak
[27:24] hasn't finished speaking yet
[27:27] and you know what's interesting is that
[27:30] like so many
[27:32] of david's prayers in verse 22 there's a
[27:35] sudden turn
[27:37] where all of a sudden he receives his
[27:39] answer
[27:40] the lord finally comes on the scene and
[27:42] the whole rest of the chapter is him
[27:44] praising the lord for him coming on the
[27:45] scene but
[27:47] not until
[27:48] the word that needed to come forth out
[27:50] of his life
[27:52] had come forth out of his life and when
[27:53] that finished speaking then he got the
[27:55] answer to his name
[27:57] you know and it made me wonder
[28:00] sometimes as if there's a witness
[28:02] there's a cry that needs to come forth
[28:04] out of our lives in our darkest hour in
[28:06] our hour of desperation in our time of
[28:08] need
[28:10] and there's something that the lord
[28:11] wants the words to finish speaking out
[28:14] of our life and then he'll meet the need
[28:16] then he'll come along and be visit you
[28:18] as you need to but the word has got to
[28:20] finish being spoken
[28:21] out of your
[28:23] experience out of your circumstance so
[28:25] it just kind of struck me as i was
[28:26] looking that let's consider
[28:29] perhaps if we find ourselves in an hour
[28:31] like that then maybe the word hasn't
[28:33] finished speaking in our circumstance
[28:35] and when that word has gone forth you'll
[28:37] receive your answer you'll receive the
[28:39] word you need when the word that needs
[28:41] to be spoken has come forth out of your
[28:43] life so i hope that's kind of an
[28:45] encouragement to you
[28:46] but it struck me as i was reading this
[28:49] and seeing the word played out in
[28:51] david's trial
[28:53] that the lord has control of everything
[28:55] and at the end of the day it's his word
[28:57] that will be made manifest
[28:59] so let's read that together psalm 22.
[29:02] there's a lot more that can be said here
[29:03] but let's read starting in verse 1
[29:06] my god my god why hast thou forsaken me
[29:10] why aren't those so far from helping me
[29:12] and from the words of my roaring oh my
[29:15] god i cry in the daytime but thou
[29:18] hearest not and in the night season and
[29:21] am not silent but thou art holy oh thou
[29:24] that inhabitest the praises of israel
[29:27] our fathers trusted in thee they trusted
[29:30] and thou didst deliver them they cried
[29:32] unto thee and were delivered they
[29:34] trusted in thee and were not confounded
[29:37] but i am a worm and no man a reproach of
[29:40] men and despised of the people
[29:43] all they that see me laugh me to scorn
[29:46] they shoot out the lip they shake the
[29:48] head saying he trusted on the lord that
[29:51] he would deliver him let him deliver him
[29:54] seeing he delighted in him but thou art
[29:57] he that took me out of the womb thou
[29:59] didst make me hope when i was upon my
[30:01] mother's breasts i was cast upon thee
[30:04] from the womb thou art my god from my
[30:07] mother's belly
[30:08] be not far from me for trouble is near
[30:11] for there is none to help
[30:13] many bulls have come past me strong
[30:15] bowls of beishan have beset me round
[30:18] they gaped upon me with their mouths as
[30:20] a ravening and a roaring lion
[30:23] i am poured out like water and all my
[30:25] bones are out of joint my heart is like
[30:28] wax it is melted in the midst of my
[30:30] bowels my strength is dried up like a
[30:33] potsherd and my tongue cleaveth to my
[30:35] jaws and thou hast brought me into the
[30:38] dust of death for dogs have compassed me
[30:41] the assembly of the wicked have enclosed
[30:43] me they pierced my hands and my feet i
[30:46] may tell all my bones they look and
[30:49] stare upon me
[30:50] they part my garments among them and
[30:52] cast lots upon my vesture
[30:54] but be not thou far from me o lord o my
[30:58] strength haste thee to help me
[31:00] deliver my soul from the sword my
[31:03] darling from the power of the dog
[31:05] save me from the lion's mouth for thou
[31:08] hast heard me from the horns of the
[31:09] unicorns
[31:11] i will declare thy name unto the
[31:13] brethren in the midst of the
[31:15] congregation will i praise thee ye that
[31:18] fear the lord praise him all ye the seed
[31:21] of jacob glorify him and fear him all ye
[31:25] the seed of israel for he hath not
[31:27] despised nor abhorred the affliction of
[31:29] the afflicted neither hath he hid his
[31:32] face from him but when he cried unto him
[31:35] he heard my praise shall be of thee in
[31:38] the great congregation i will pay my
[31:40] vows before them that fear him the meek
[31:43] shall eat and be satisfied they shall
[31:46] praise the lord that seek him your heart
[31:49] shall live forever all the ends of the
[31:51] earth shall remember and turn unto the
[31:54] lord and all the kindreds of the nations
[31:56] shall worship before thee for the
[31:59] kingdom is the lord's and he is the
[32:01] governor among the nations
[32:03] all they that be fat upon earth shall
[32:05] eat and worship all they that go down to
[32:08] the dust shall bow before him and none
[32:11] can keep his his own soul a seed shall
[32:14] serve him it shall be accounted to the
[32:17] lord for regeneration they shall come
[32:20] and shall declare his righteousness unto
[32:22] a people that shall be born that he hath
[32:25] done this amen

[1:06:46] amen let's stand
[1:06:50] we'll try not to be long this morning
[1:06:55] let's open our bibles
[1:06:58] in genesis chapter 32.
[1:07:29] now let's start from verse 18
[1:07:32] it says then
[1:07:34] shall thy say
[1:07:35] then
[1:07:36] thou shalt say
[1:07:40] they be thy servant jacob
[1:07:43] it is a is it is it a present
[1:07:46] it's a it's a present sent unto
[1:07:48] my lord esau and behold
[1:07:51] also he has behind us
[1:07:54] and
[1:07:55] just for reference this is
[1:07:57] uh when
[1:07:59] uh eso is getting ready i'm sorry jacob
[1:08:02] is getting ready to meet esau
[1:08:04] and so now he's come to a place where he
[1:08:07] finally
[1:08:09] has to meet all the wrong that he had
[1:08:11] done in his life and
[1:08:13] it was a reckoning day it's a day where
[1:08:15] he finally gets to
[1:08:17] pay for all that he's been running after
[1:08:19] everything that he's done and everything
[1:08:21] that he did
[1:08:22] everything was coming down to an end and
[1:08:24] now he's trying to devise the final plan
[1:08:27] what am i going to do what exactly is
[1:08:29] going to happen so he divides his family
[1:08:32] he divides the flock so they can send it
[1:08:34] perhaps if the first group gets get
[1:08:37] caught the second group can go around
[1:08:39] and he's trying all manner of things
[1:08:41] just to try to get out of it
[1:08:43] and so 19 and he said and so commanded
[1:08:46] he the second and the third and all that
[1:08:49] followed
[1:08:51] the droves saying
[1:08:53] on this manner shall ye speak unto esau
[1:08:56] when you find him
[1:08:58] and say ye moreover behold thy servant
[1:09:02] jacob is behind us and i was telling
[1:09:04] them to tell he's servant so he's really
[1:09:08] trying really hard an inside servant is
[1:09:11] behind us for he said
[1:09:13] i will appease him
[1:09:15] with the present that goeth before me
[1:09:18] and afterward i will see him
[1:09:20] i will see his face for adventure that
[1:09:23] he will accept he will accept of me
[1:09:26] so he went so
[1:09:28] so went the present over behind before
[1:09:30] him and he himself
[1:09:33] lodged at night
[1:09:34] in the company
[1:09:36] and he rose up
[1:09:37] a rose up that night and he took his two
[1:09:40] wives and his two
[1:09:42] woman servants and his 11 sons and
[1:09:45] passed over
[1:09:47] over the four
[1:09:48] jog jawbook
[1:09:50] and he took them and send them over the
[1:09:53] brook and send over
[1:09:55] and send over that he had and jacob was
[1:09:59] left alone
[1:10:00] now he's left alone finally
[1:10:03] is by himself
[1:10:05] and there wrestled the man with him
[1:10:07] until the breaking of the day
[1:10:10] and when he saw that he prevailed not
[1:10:12] against him he touched the hollow of his
[1:10:15] tie and the hollow of jacob's tie was
[1:10:17] out of joint and as he wrestled with him
[1:10:21] and he said let me go for the day
[1:10:23] breaketh and he said i will not let thee
[1:10:27] go except thou blessed me
[1:10:29] amen
[1:10:30] i just
[1:10:31] trust this morning we can have that kind
[1:10:34] of perseverance that kind of drive as a
[1:10:37] believer said i will not let you go
[1:10:39] until you bless me
[1:10:41] and he said unto him what is thy name he
[1:10:44] said jacob
[1:10:45] and he said the name shall be called no
[1:10:48] more jacob but israel for as the prince
[1:10:52] had thou power with god and with men and
[1:10:55] it prevailed
[1:10:57] and jacob asked him and said tell me i
[1:10:59] prayed
[1:11:00] thy name and he said wherefore is it
[1:11:03] that thou
[1:11:04] do ask after my name
[1:11:07] and he blessed him there
[1:11:09] and jacob called the name of the place
[1:11:11] pineal
[1:11:12] for he had seen god face to face and
[1:11:16] for
[1:11:17] i have seen god face to face and my life
[1:11:19] is preserved
[1:11:21] let's also turn in
[1:11:23] isaiah chapter 6.
[1:11:26] we're going to start from
[1:11:28] verse 1.
[1:11:31] it says in the year
[1:11:33] in the year that
[1:11:35] usia died the king that king uzziah died
[1:11:39] i saw also the load sitting upon his
[1:11:41] throne
[1:11:42] high and lifted up
[1:11:44] and his strength filled with temple
[1:11:48] abbavi stood the seraph above
[1:11:51] above it stood the seraph and each
[1:11:53] one had six swings with twenty covered
[1:11:56] his face
[1:11:57] with twenty covered his feet with twenty
[1:12:00] did he fly
[1:12:01] and one cried unto another and said holy
[1:12:05] holy holy is the lord
[1:12:07] the holy is the lord of hosts
[1:12:10] though it says the whole earth is full
[1:12:13] of his glory
[1:12:14] and the post of the door moved at the
[1:12:18] voice of him that crieth
[1:12:21] and the house was filled with smoke
[1:12:24] then said i woe is
[1:12:26] worries me for i am undone because i'm a
[1:12:30] man of unclean lips
[1:12:32] and i dwell in the midst of people of
[1:12:34] unclean lips
[1:12:36] for mine eyes have seen
[1:12:38] the king the lord of hosts
[1:12:41] then flew one of the seraphims unto me
[1:12:44] having a live coal
[1:12:46] in his hand
[1:12:48] which he had taken with the tongues
[1:12:51] from the from off the altar
[1:12:54] and he had laid it upon my mouth and
[1:12:57] said lo
[1:12:58] this had touched that lip
[1:13:00] that lips and thy iniquity is taken away
[1:13:04] and thy sin is purged
[1:13:06] also i had i heard the voice of the lord
[1:13:09] saying
[1:13:10] who shall who shall i send
[1:13:12] who shall go for us then i said
[1:13:16] here i am here am i sent me
[1:13:21] let's open one more place in first
[1:13:23] corinthians chapter 13.
[1:13:27] we're going to read from verse 9.
[1:13:31] it says
[1:13:33] for we know in part
[1:13:36] and we prophesy in part
[1:13:39] but when that when that which is perfect
[1:13:42] is come
[1:13:44] that which is in part shall be done away
[1:13:46] with
[1:13:48] when i was a child i speak as a child i
[1:13:51] understood as a child
[1:13:53] i thought as a child
[1:13:55] when i become a man i put away childish
[1:13:58] things
[1:14:00] for now we see through glass darkly
[1:14:03] but then
[1:14:04] face to face
[1:14:07] now i know in part
[1:14:09] but then i shall know
[1:14:11] even as i am known
[1:14:14] and now abideth faith hope charity these
[1:14:18] three
[1:14:19] but the greatest of this is
[1:14:22] charity amen may the lord that blessing
[1:14:25] to the reading of his word you may have
[1:14:26] your seats
[1:14:46] if i may for a few moments
[1:14:49] i would like to speak this morning
[1:14:52] on
[1:14:55] from jacob
[1:14:57] to israel
[1:14:59] a changing character
[1:15:01] from jacob to israel
[1:15:04] a change in character
[1:15:06] now we we know that as believers we
[1:15:12] we know that the seed of god within us
[1:15:15] is
[1:15:16] desiring to see the manifestations of
[1:15:18] god
[1:15:19] we we desire to see god manifested
[1:15:23] we desire to see the promise of god each
[1:15:25] and every day manifested in our lives
[1:15:28] i can i can say
[1:15:30] we can even say even as much as we see
[1:15:34] the fulfillment of the prophecy in the
[1:15:36] time that we live in when we look at the
[1:15:38] world's condition we see everything we
[1:15:40] see those things happening
[1:15:43] we are taught even in the message a
[1:15:46] believer's desire is to go
[1:15:49] in the bible in the scripture for us to
[1:15:51] find the promise that pertain to us as
[1:15:54] the world is getting in his condition we
[1:15:56] know the bride is also getting in the
[1:15:58] condition and we desire to see those
[1:16:00] things come to pass
[1:16:02] we we can take it down and say within
[1:16:05] our daily lives within our families
[1:16:08] within our relationships you know these
[1:16:10] things that happens in these
[1:16:12] difficulties these challenges that we
[1:16:14] face every day and we'd like to see god
[1:16:17] move within our lives we like to see him
[1:16:19] heal the sick we like to see him deliver
[1:16:21] our children we like to see him even
[1:16:24] ourselves being delivered from certain
[1:16:26] things that we struggle with all of that
[1:16:28] is part of the christian life that we
[1:16:30] live in and is always the need to see
[1:16:33] god
[1:16:34] it didn't matter how many times we see
[1:16:36] him we want to see him more it's a
[1:16:39] desire within the heart that constantly
[1:16:41] wants to see god more and more and more
[1:16:44] regardless of how much we know today we
[1:16:46] want to know him more than we knew him
[1:16:48] yesterday we want to know him tomorrow
[1:16:50] more than what we know him today and
[1:16:53] barbara makes an interesting statement
[1:16:55] and i hope we can connect us together
[1:16:58] with that it says
[1:16:59] it says man is always trying to find out
[1:17:02] where he comes from how did they get
[1:17:03] here and where he's going
[1:17:05] and that's the whole of man when we
[1:17:07] summarize what man is all about that's
[1:17:09] what it is where do you come from how
[1:17:12] did you get here and where are you going
[1:17:14] and we always try to find an answer to
[1:17:16] that question and he says but the thing
[1:17:18] about it is the one who can answer the
[1:17:20] question is the one who put him here in
[1:17:22] the first place
[1:17:24] so in other word if you're trying to
[1:17:26] find an answer for your question the one
[1:17:28] who can answer the question is the one
[1:17:30] who put he who put you here in the first
[1:17:32] place the same god who placed us here
[1:17:35] he's the one who has the answer he's the
[1:17:37] one who knows how all of this supposed
[1:17:39] to play he's the one who holds the
[1:17:42] mystery of all of it he's the answer to
[1:17:44] all needs and as we come close to him he
[1:17:47] gets to deliver to us what the answer is
[1:17:50] by revelation and we walk with him daily
[1:17:53] it's not a one-time contact and
[1:17:55] everything is done but he wants a
[1:17:57] constant contact for every need that we
[1:18:00] have we go back to him and he answers
[1:18:03] according to his word
[1:18:04] now i want to say this
[1:18:07] makes the statement
[1:18:10] he says this he says
[1:18:14] he makes the statement he says
[1:18:19] he says that man he says
[1:18:23] may the lord may the lord blessed his
[1:18:25] word and i think it's the most striking
[1:18:28] scripture he talks about the scripture
[1:18:31] that we read in isaiah i believe he says
[1:18:34] we find out that in the presence of god
[1:18:36] man records recognizes themselves as
[1:18:39] sinner
[1:18:42] man recognizes themselves as sinner in
[1:18:44] the presence of god and and and and in
[1:18:47] another place but brenham talks about
[1:18:50] how
[1:18:51] that there's never been a man who's come
[1:18:53] face to face with god and remain the
[1:18:55] same
[1:18:56] you never come into the presence of god
[1:18:58] and not change why because the very
[1:19:01] change that we're looking for is within
[1:19:04] the presence of god
[1:19:05] if we have a need for something we come
[1:19:08] into the presence of god if we need a
[1:19:10] change we come into the presence for
[1:19:11] everything that we have need of the
[1:19:14] presence of god brings the result or it
[1:19:16] brings the answer to men's question it
[1:19:19] says no man has ever seen god face to
[1:19:22] face and stay the same we we don't uh uh
[1:19:26] uh uh come to a place where we see god
[1:19:30] in fact i was thinking about you know
[1:19:31] but
[1:19:32] ed testimony talks about being in with
[1:19:34] what run i'm in the car he talks about
[1:19:37] the presence of god coming in the car
[1:19:39] and he says after he left he says
[1:19:42] he looked at his face his face was
[1:19:44] changed and everything he asked him he
[1:19:45] says i feel like dying every time he
[1:19:48] comes around why because that's the
[1:19:50] presence of the god that we are serving
[1:19:53] that's what he is when we look when we
[1:19:55] think of god when we think about his
[1:19:58] attribute when we think about his
[1:19:59] greatness
[1:20:01] within the small flesh we cannot contain
[1:20:04] his presence we cannot even stand before
[1:20:07] his presence it's not made for this
[1:20:09] flesh to be able to stand before god so
[1:20:12] he says he recognized himself
[1:20:14] when man comes
[1:20:17] before god he recognized himself as
[1:20:19] sinner it says that we may feel a little
[1:20:22] good when we are out in different places
[1:20:25] and if we feel like we're pretty good
[1:20:27] people but when
[1:20:29] but when we ever come into the presence
[1:20:32] of god then we see how little we are
[1:20:37] he continues on and he says standing not
[1:20:39] long ago this is in a message's presence
[1:20:42] standing not long ago with a friend of
[1:20:44] mine i had the privilege to lead to
[1:20:47] christ's birth call
[1:20:49] and i believe this is
[1:20:50] if i recall my mind served me properly
[1:20:53] this is the one the story about the
[1:20:55] mother dear
[1:20:56] that that manifested the characteristics
[1:20:59] of what a real genuine mother was and
[1:21:02] now caused him to to he was trying to
[1:21:04] shoot the doe and then when he looked at
[1:21:06] the mother dear come around and he come
[1:21:08] and his life was changed it says up in
[1:21:11] nuance for hunting partners we're
[1:21:13] standing in a cold brook fall of uh
[1:21:16] adorat it says in such a great mammoth
[1:21:19] fall it says and i take my family last
[1:21:22] year up there and i i i took it i took
[1:21:26] it way back off the road
[1:21:28] we have it says we have to hike back
[1:21:30] there and to get it to get to it
[1:21:33] and when we seen the blue green water
[1:21:36] pouring with such mighty power out of
[1:21:39] the
[1:21:40] out of the mountains and gushing down
[1:21:43] over the rocks and and bert stood there
[1:21:45] and looked at me and he says geez billy
[1:21:48] gee billy he said it makes me feel so
[1:21:51] little
[1:21:52] it says in
[1:21:54] he measured about a quarter of an inch
[1:21:57] of his finger and he says that's right
[1:21:59] bird now it says that that was all that
[1:22:03] he know
[1:22:05] of getting into the presence of god he's
[1:22:08] seen his creation he see his creation so
[1:22:11] this
[1:22:12] here is this man
[1:22:14] standing and looking at the creation of
[1:22:16] god
[1:22:17] looking at the at the fall and looking
[1:22:20] at the nature
[1:22:21] looking and realizing and saying oh
[1:22:24] how huge this is and and perhaps we can
[1:22:27] recall from our own experiences where
[1:22:29] we've been to a place uh whether it be a
[1:22:32] mountain top a waterfall or a place
[1:22:35] where it just seemed uh you know i
[1:22:37] remember uh being a
[1:22:40] niagara fall just looking at the how
[1:22:42] huge the waterfall was and and looking
[1:22:45] at the people down there you realize
[1:22:47] that men cannot do this
[1:22:50] this is beyond man man cannot achieve
[1:22:52] this this is nature at its best and god
[1:22:55] created this god made this to be this
[1:22:58] way god made it so one can look at him
[1:23:00] and enjoy it and realize that this is
[1:23:03] not men that can do this and the most
[1:23:05] important thing is for you to look at it
[1:23:08] and realize that there is a presence of
[1:23:10] god
[1:23:13] it wasn't just made for men to just go
[1:23:15] and and go and do things the way they
[1:23:18] would like but the the the the the truth
[1:23:21] about it is it was made so one can look
[1:23:24] at it and come into the realization of
[1:23:26] how god great god is that come to a
[1:23:29] place where you realize that god is not
[1:23:32] a man or he's not a son of man he's not
[1:23:34] a man he doesn't think like we are he
[1:23:36] doesn't dwell in the things that we do
[1:23:39] he doesn't do things like a mortal will
[1:23:41] do but this is god he has the power to
[1:23:43] change things and when he makes things
[1:23:46] it's beyond our understanding
[1:23:49] you you
[1:23:50] it's very important that we always come
[1:23:53] to a place where we realize that as we
[1:23:55] are here because barbara makes a
[1:23:57] statement he says the reason why men sin
[1:24:01] is because they feel they are not in the
[1:24:03] presence of god it's because they feel
[1:24:05] they are far removed from where god is
[1:24:08] but when you come to the realization
[1:24:10] when you know the sun is shining it's
[1:24:12] god
[1:24:13] the sun rise it's god it's raining it's
[1:24:16] god when you come to a realization that
[1:24:18] everything when i look at the bird i see
[1:24:21] god everything i look when i look at
[1:24:23] nature i see god then you would know
[1:24:26] that you are constantly and always in
[1:24:28] the presence of god amen
[1:24:31] the thing about it is man is trying to
[1:24:33] remove himself from god he's trying to
[1:24:36] get himself to a place where he can uh i
[1:24:39] think he's by himself he can enjoy his
[1:24:41] life and do things the way he wants but
[1:24:43] god is constantly there watching there's
[1:24:46] not david said there's no place i can
[1:24:49] run to the end of the earth you are
[1:24:51] there
[1:24:53] he speaks in psalm he says when i was
[1:24:55] carelessly bought and and in my mother's
[1:24:58] womb when my members were imperfect you
[1:25:00] were there
[1:25:01] it says when i go down in hell you are
[1:25:04] there
[1:25:05] there's no place where you can run away
[1:25:07] from god there's not a place where you
[1:25:09] cannot feel the presence of god he's the
[1:25:12] creator of all the heaven and the earth
[1:25:14] and he wants you to know that regardless
[1:25:16] of where you are and i can talk about
[1:25:18] physically i can talk about spiritually
[1:25:20] regardless of where you are god is there
[1:25:23] with you
[1:25:27] god is not in this building as per say
[1:25:31] god is here is everywhere because he has
[1:25:33] the ability to see we have brought him
[1:25:35] here when we go home god is at home when
[1:25:38] we go to where god is at work it's just
[1:25:40] us coming into the realization that his
[1:25:43] presence is with me he walks with me he
[1:25:46] talks with me he wants to communicate
[1:25:49] with me he wants to impart something to
[1:25:51] me i just need to make contact but he's
[1:25:54] there there's not jonah cried from the
[1:25:56] belly of the well
[1:25:59] and god heard him from down there so the
[1:26:01] presence of god is conscious constantly
[1:26:04] and continually with us
[1:26:06] he continues on and he says
[1:26:08] oh i wonder the men i wrote how great
[1:26:12] they are
[1:26:13] if you didn't look at one night and look
[1:26:15] up at the stars how far they are
[1:26:19] away
[1:26:20] and a few months ago brother fred and
[1:26:22] brother wood and bro and i
[1:26:25] standing with brother uh
[1:26:28] uh
[1:26:30] mcnally brother mcnelly out in arizona
[1:26:33] desert it says we was measuring train
[1:26:36] one star how close it was to another it
[1:26:39] says uh with millions of and billions of
[1:26:43] miles away it says they didn't look they
[1:26:46] didn't look
[1:26:47] they didn't look over a quarter of an
[1:26:49] inch from each other
[1:26:52] then we began to think according to
[1:26:54] science
[1:26:55] the scientific proof of that those stars
[1:26:58] are probably further away from each
[1:27:01] other than we are from them
[1:27:04] so now i want you to think about what
[1:27:06] he's talking here it continues on it
[1:27:09] says then we realize how little we are
[1:27:12] when we realize how great he is
[1:27:15] oh my proud of my sister and and and why
[1:27:19] is this important because
[1:27:21] within the life's challenges within the
[1:27:25] life that we live in it's very important
[1:27:28] that everything is measured to its
[1:27:29] appropriate scale
[1:27:31] we cannot confuse and come to a place
[1:27:34] where we ever think well i think my life
[1:27:37] is too messed up or my life is too
[1:27:39] complicated that things are so
[1:27:41] complicated that god cannot come and
[1:27:43] solve it that that is making god
[1:27:45] immortal that is making god and bringing
[1:27:48] him down to your level that is bringing
[1:27:51] taking god and trying to fit him within
[1:27:53] your own mind but what he would like to
[1:27:56] do this morning is for us to come as we
[1:27:58] are it didn't matter what your
[1:28:00] background was it didn't matter what you
[1:28:02] did it didn't matter what your situation
[1:28:04] was you bring it to him and he will take
[1:28:07] care of him because he has many times
[1:28:10] trying to show us within the scripture
[1:28:13] that the things that concern him are far
[1:28:15] above what we can understand what our
[1:28:18] mind can conceive and everything about
[1:28:20] us what he wants us to do is to trust it
[1:28:22] within his hands and know that he has
[1:28:25] the answer to our problems
[1:28:30] it says we realize how little we are and
[1:28:33] we realize how great he is
[1:28:36] and how close
[1:28:37] it says how close we coming into the
[1:28:40] presence in we're coming to the coming
[1:28:43] we're coming to the coming of his
[1:28:45] presence somehow another he's he's
[1:28:48] always thrown a great effect upon people
[1:28:52] to come into the presence of god we've
[1:28:54] seen time and time we've seen time in
[1:28:57] the mystery when we would see the
[1:28:59] presence of god coming to such a place
[1:29:02] and he would bring a person up and
[1:29:04] reveal the uh he revealed the life to
[1:29:07] them and called their sin they call
[1:29:09] their sins all kinds of immoral act and
[1:29:12] bring
[1:29:13] and bring such a holy hush among the
[1:29:16] people till they drop out of prayer line
[1:29:19] before they even come to the beco to
[1:29:22] come to be prayed for and run to the
[1:29:24] altar and get right god before they can
[1:29:28] get right with god before they can come
[1:29:30] into his presence there is something
[1:29:32] about coming into the presence of god is
[1:29:35] causing things to happen we've seen
[1:29:38] people laying in cost
[1:29:41] in in cost and structures in other words
[1:29:44] the area is the presence of god always
[1:29:47] brings a change
[1:29:48] the presence of god is there to bring
[1:29:51] about the transformation we said no one
[1:29:54] has ever come into the presence of god
[1:29:56] and remained the same the scripture
[1:29:58] tells us no one can come into the
[1:30:01] presence of god and remain the same
[1:30:03] person and continue to do the same
[1:30:05] person what the presence of god is here
[1:30:07] to do is to take you and change you from
[1:30:10] a jacob and change you into israel what
[1:30:14] the presence of god is here to do is to
[1:30:16] take the seed we say the seed was in the
[1:30:19] ground with this fleshly ground that god
[1:30:21] placed it in but the seed was made so
[1:30:24] that when he comes into the presence of
[1:30:26] god that the light will strike the seed
[1:30:29] that it will be changed from just being
[1:30:31] a seed and stain a seed into the
[1:30:33] manifestation of its fruit so it can
[1:30:36] manifest something for god so it wasn't
[1:30:39] made so the seed can remain a seed but
[1:30:41] it was made so that the presence of god
[1:30:44] the atmosphere that it created the
[1:30:46] presence of god that the holy unction
[1:30:49] that god that he creates when his
[1:30:51] spirits come down is there to produce
[1:30:53] life
[1:30:56] and that's why it's important that we
[1:30:57] desire the presence of god if you
[1:31:00] whatever you have need of this morning
[1:31:02] only the presence of god can bring it to
[1:31:04] you if you desire healing the presence
[1:31:07] of god is yet to provide it you desire
[1:31:09] the deliverance the presence of god is
[1:31:11] here to deliver whatever we have need of
[1:31:14] when you come to church this morning and
[1:31:17] i was wondering did you come oh brother
[1:31:19] david is not there i just come to hear
[1:31:21] about the billy oh oh i hear to hear
[1:31:23] from the david that's not gonna help you
[1:31:26] that's not gonna do you no girl because
[1:31:29] man cannot give to you what you have
[1:31:31] need of
[1:31:32] what we need is to be elevated and say i
[1:31:35] have showed up this morning with
[1:31:37] expectation i didn't come to hear what
[1:31:40] that man has to say but i'm here for the
[1:31:42] word of god and i will latch on to the
[1:31:45] word of god and i will receive what i
[1:31:48] have because we receive according to our
[1:31:50] expectation
[1:31:54] it's the presence of god that brings
[1:31:56] things it's not a man he has nothing to
[1:31:58] do with a man he all has to do with the
[1:32:01] presence of god if we can come this
[1:32:03] morning realize this is we we have a
[1:32:06] ritual per se the you know there's the
[1:32:08] song that has to go there's the
[1:32:10] the part of the offering and will take
[1:32:13] the offering because it's part of
[1:32:14] worship and everything but don't let
[1:32:16] that stray you away don't let don't ever
[1:32:19] be a believer that can say well i pay my
[1:32:22] tithes i go to church and i do this and
[1:32:25] therefore i'm satisfied if you are in
[1:32:28] that state you will miss a lot of things
[1:32:30] about god why because when we wake up in
[1:32:33] the morning i don't know about you there
[1:32:35] is something within my heart that says i
[1:32:37] desire god today i know i'm a failure
[1:32:40] without him i know i couldn't say
[1:32:43] anything right without him i couldn't do
[1:32:45] anything right with him i know i need
[1:32:47] his presence
[1:32:52] oh my brother my sister the scripture
[1:32:54] speaks about in the old testament there
[1:32:56] was aaron's uh rod that was taken the
[1:33:00] rod was lifeless
[1:33:02] there was no inch of life within the
[1:33:04] stick it was all drained out and taken
[1:33:07] out but that rod was taken and placed
[1:33:10] back into the presence of god it
[1:33:12] produced fruits
[1:33:16] and if we desire fruits this morning
[1:33:19] that same presence can bring it to us
[1:33:21] this morning
[1:33:31] so now
[1:33:33] we read the scripture
[1:33:35] we read the scripture in isaiah
[1:33:37] here is isaiah he comes in
[1:33:40] but random talks a little bit about him
[1:33:42] how that
[1:33:43] his life he said
[1:33:45] this king had been so good to him and
[1:33:48] and he he had so much faith in this king
[1:33:51] and and and the things and
[1:33:53] and yet the king died and yerry was
[1:33:57] and
[1:33:57] and he didn't he he just trusted him so
[1:34:00] much
[1:34:01] and here he is he says he's taken up and
[1:34:04] and he's in the place and he began to
[1:34:07] look and
[1:34:08] and he's taken to this place he looked
[1:34:10] at all the seraphins and they have six
[1:34:13] wings and they two they cover the face
[1:34:15] and to their feet and with to the flu
[1:34:18] and they came around
[1:34:19] and and such a holy place and they began
[1:34:23] every time they would speak or say holy
[1:34:25] holy holy three times and they will take
[1:34:28] a step and the pillars will shake
[1:34:32] oh my just think about such a presence
[1:34:34] my brother my sister we have to realize
[1:34:36] what kind of god we're serving i think
[1:34:39] sometimes our mind gets dimmed out and
[1:34:42] our mind gets uh brought down and and we
[1:34:45] think so little we think in in such a
[1:34:48] constraint and everything
[1:34:51] the things the reality of who this god
[1:34:54] is
[1:34:54] and everything that he is about him it
[1:34:57] will take eternity for us to understand
[1:34:59] it
[1:35:00] everything about this god will take us
[1:35:02] eternity because we only know him as he
[1:35:05] unfolds himself as he reveals himself to
[1:35:08] us so here he is and in his glory it
[1:35:12] says the glory of the of the lord filled
[1:35:14] the temple and as it takes a step
[1:35:18] the whole place just shakes
[1:35:22] he realized
[1:35:23] the first thing you realize it says
[1:35:26] woe is me
[1:35:29] woe is me
[1:35:31] you know it's it's so contrary to the
[1:35:34] carnal human understanding of coming
[1:35:36] into the presence of god
[1:35:38] people will go to church and and play
[1:35:41] all kinds of worldly music and scream
[1:35:44] and shout and and do all kinds of things
[1:35:46] and come and say oh i was in the
[1:35:48] presence of god
[1:35:51] i want you to think about that this
[1:35:53] morning
[1:35:54] the church world will play rock and roll
[1:35:57] music that will stand up all kinds of
[1:35:59] instruments and reproduce everything
[1:36:01] that the world is doing and and then
[1:36:03] come home and say oh did you feel the
[1:36:05] presence of god
[1:36:07] but yet the description of a prophet i
[1:36:10] want you to think about this this is one
[1:36:11] of the greatest prophet in the bible who
[1:36:14] wrote 66 chap chapter who wrote almost
[1:36:17] the entire bible who the one who said
[1:36:21] who talked about the messiah coming one
[1:36:23] who talked about the bride and and the
[1:36:25] new jerusalem and all of this great
[1:36:27] prophecy and all of this standing before
[1:36:30] the presence of god and all he could
[1:36:33] think of is woe is me
[1:36:38] i tell you this flesh was never meant to
[1:36:41] be in the presence of god there's no uh
[1:36:44] there's not enough holiness you can put
[1:36:46] up on it to bring it before god what it
[1:36:48] takes is he him inviting you and i want
[1:36:51] you to realize that the only way he
[1:36:54] could come is when one of the serpents
[1:36:56] provided away he gave him a call of fire
[1:36:59] for him to put that's how he could even
[1:37:02] speak oh my prayer my sister the only
[1:37:04] way we can speak in this generation is
[1:37:07] because god provided a way for us to
[1:37:09] speak back
[1:37:13] there he is and he realized oh
[1:37:16] woe is me
[1:37:17] in other words when the presence of god
[1:37:19] comes the first thing that he does it
[1:37:22] will convict you and will convict you of
[1:37:24] sin and that's why people run away from
[1:37:27] it people don't want to be in contact
[1:37:29] with god because they know every little
[1:37:32] thing that they do they will get
[1:37:33] conviction so they run away as far as
[1:37:36] possible the first thing that he does is
[1:37:38] bring conviction
[1:37:42] if you're not living right he'll show
[1:37:44] you you're not living right
[1:37:46] if you're not acting right it will show
[1:37:48] you you're not acting right
[1:37:50] if you're anything any variation i want
[1:37:53] you to think about this missionary who
[1:37:54] thought that he had done so great things
[1:37:57] and and here he is and he's standing and
[1:38:00] he goes they open the name it says your
[1:38:02] name is not in the book
[1:38:05] it says oh you have to appeal to the
[1:38:07] white throne judgment
[1:38:08] and then it goes there and it says
[1:38:11] oh as i got closer he got lighter and
[1:38:14] lighter and lighter and lighter what is
[1:38:16] it the presence of god
[1:38:19] it's it's a purifying presence
[1:38:22] it's something that cleans you
[1:38:24] it's something that makes you whole it's
[1:38:27] something that makes you what you're
[1:38:29] supposed to be
[1:38:30] don't run away from it run to it
[1:38:33] in the garden of eden there were the
[1:38:35] chairmans that were protecting you away
[1:38:37] from it but now that way it's been made
[1:38:40] open so we can run to it and i want to
[1:38:42] say this this morning without the
[1:38:45] presence of god we are all dead
[1:38:51] the only way to live is to go into that
[1:38:54] presence you say it's going to kill me
[1:38:56] let it kill you let it kill the human at
[1:38:59] your wall let it kill the worldliness
[1:39:01] that you have let's kill everything
[1:39:04] because after he's done killing you he
[1:39:06] will resurrect you
[1:39:07] [Applause]
[1:39:11] the thing that we struggle with is we
[1:39:13] run away from the very thing that's
[1:39:15] supposed to save us
[1:39:17] we run away from the thing that god has
[1:39:19] provided we are okay with somebody just
[1:39:21] standing and giving us scriptures we're
[1:39:24] studying the bible studying just you
[1:39:26] know oh the scripture says do not lie
[1:39:29] well you know i'll try my best not to
[1:39:31] lie you know and the scripture says do
[1:39:33] this and do this you try to practice it
[1:39:35] within yourself i'll tell you this
[1:39:37] morning when you come into that presence
[1:39:40] you have no need of no man reminding you
[1:39:43] because what that presence does to you
[1:39:45] is permanent
[1:39:48] it takes away the desire
[1:39:51] christianity is not a practicing of
[1:39:54] something that you go to school and you
[1:39:56] educate yourself christianity is a
[1:39:59] person who's come in contact with god
[1:40:02] and you're standing there knowing that i
[1:40:04] can only do this because god allowed me
[1:40:07] to do this he blessed the desire within
[1:40:09] my heart i'm living this way because he
[1:40:12] allowed me to live this way he's made
[1:40:15] something for me and i cannot let
[1:40:17] anything comes within my way
[1:40:22] we struggle because
[1:40:24] we don't surrender fully to his presence
[1:40:28] so this missionary stands there
[1:40:32] evangelist in
[1:40:34] the presidency got staring
[1:40:38] it says
[1:40:39] if you ever told a lie
[1:40:42] it said well
[1:40:45] at first i was pretty sure of it
[1:40:49] but then
[1:40:51] when in front of that presence
[1:40:54] everything begins to magnify
[1:40:57] everything becomes to be a reality
[1:41:00] you realize
[1:41:02] i must have said things
[1:41:04] and i said things that were just not a
[1:41:06] hundred percent true
[1:41:08] i said i i went i did things that were
[1:41:11] just not a hundred percent
[1:41:14] he come to the realization if you ever
[1:41:16] stole
[1:41:17] is that ashrae i didn't stole
[1:41:19] i didn't steal anything
[1:41:21] but yet within that presence
[1:41:24] the magnification of who he was
[1:41:27] because of who god was not because of
[1:41:29] who he is but because of who's whose
[1:41:32] presence he was standing in
[1:41:33] he come to the realization
[1:41:36] i did that
[1:41:39] but that's not the end of the story
[1:41:42] i want you to realize that that same
[1:41:44] presence that made that
[1:41:46] it says as the judgment was getting
[1:41:48] ready to be pronounced
[1:41:50] he heard a voice he said father
[1:41:53] when he was down there he stood for me
[1:41:55] and i'll stand for him
[1:41:57] and i want to say this
[1:41:59] the only way we get is to get into his
[1:42:02] presence
[1:42:03] that's how he's going to stand for us
[1:42:05] when we get into his presence when we
[1:42:08] let him take the wilderness away the
[1:42:10] reason why we struggle with what we
[1:42:12] struggle is because we are in this flesh
[1:42:14] but i tell you what you take this
[1:42:16] presence into that presence that
[1:42:18] presence will take this place and bring
[1:42:20] it under subjection
[1:42:22] that presence will take this flesh and
[1:42:24] change it and here is isaiah standing
[1:42:27] and realize i'm a man of unclean lips i
[1:42:29] dwell within the unclean lips people and
[1:42:32] then it says how do i get to be accepted
[1:42:34] here i am how do i is there any any
[1:42:38] chance for me but yet within that
[1:42:40] presence there was a call of fire
[1:42:42] provided for him now i want you to
[1:42:43] listen but when him is saying he's
[1:42:45] talking about that he says
[1:42:47] he says
[1:42:48] and isaiah when
[1:42:50] he says the great thirst and perhaps he
[1:42:53] was schooled he was probably a good edu
[1:42:56] uh he was it was he had a good education
[1:42:59] and marvelous conception of god as and
[1:43:02] he had he he had he had the priest and
[1:43:06] uh
[1:43:06] he had heard the he had the priest
[1:43:09] and he had been in the temple and he was
[1:43:12] raised and believer a believer it says
[1:43:15] but you see
[1:43:17] you see
[1:43:18] he had never come face to face with it
[1:43:21] before
[1:43:25] and i want to say this
[1:43:27] it's not how educated we can get in the
[1:43:30] message
[1:43:31] it's not how many quotes we can know
[1:43:34] it's not how many things we can recite
[1:43:36] but the real answer to the question is
[1:43:39] if you come in contact with the
[1:43:41] face-to-face god of that message
[1:43:45] and and i'll say this this sounds very
[1:43:48] uh
[1:43:49] simple but you realize that's where the
[1:43:52] life is that's why people will struggle
[1:43:54] at the most is people come to a place
[1:43:57] where they are content with just reading
[1:43:59] the bible they're just contending with
[1:44:01] reading the message but they're not
[1:44:03] looking for that god to come in contact
[1:44:06] with them and make the things which they
[1:44:09] are reading come a reality
[1:44:12] now any man can read the books any man
[1:44:15] can read the tapes in fact some have
[1:44:17] read it and they've called it of the
[1:44:19] devil what makes the difference is god
[1:44:22] coming to you and showing you and making
[1:44:25] this world a reality to your life
[1:44:28] i'll take that over anything you take
[1:44:30] religion god is not interested in
[1:44:32] religion
[1:44:35] god is not interested in us just
[1:44:37] building a body and calling ourselves
[1:44:39] christian life tabernacle god is
[1:44:41] interested in individuals who knows who
[1:44:43] he is
[1:44:44] because that's what life is
[1:44:48] i i want to know god i want to come in
[1:44:51] contact with him i want his life to be
[1:44:53] my life i want the things which i do to
[1:44:57] just not be some type of instructions
[1:44:59] but i want to do them because i'm coming
[1:45:01] in contact with god and that has been
[1:45:04] revealed to me to be the truth
[1:45:08] and he says
[1:45:10] and he never come face to face
[1:45:13] with it before and he says his desires
[1:45:17] was right so it's not about the desire
[1:45:20] he wanted to be right but he just he
[1:45:23] just he just had an educated side he
[1:45:26] just had the educational side
[1:45:29] he had he had the feel the theological
[1:45:32] side of it but when he had gotten there
[1:45:35] in the temple that day and he seen the
[1:45:37] cherubians waving the wings uh the the
[1:45:40] wings even as you even know what sin was
[1:45:45] and it stands in the presence of god
[1:45:47] they had covered the holy face
[1:45:50] and stand in the presence of god and the
[1:45:52] prophet cried out woe is me
[1:45:55] i'm undone i'm a man of unclean lips i'm
[1:45:59] a it says all my theology theology and
[1:46:02] stuff i've learned all the my marvelous
[1:46:05] conception that i have of god it says my
[1:46:08] face
[1:46:09] i'm
[1:46:10] i'm face to face with it now he says
[1:46:13] i'm a man of unclean lips and i dwell
[1:46:16] with people on clean lips all the
[1:46:18] teaching of laws and things that they
[1:46:21] had done had never reached to the place
[1:46:24] to where he comes in the presence of god
[1:46:27] and seeing god with his own eyes
[1:46:31] theology is not gonna bring you there
[1:46:34] education is not gonna bring you there
[1:46:37] it says and and these trials when he was
[1:46:40] sitting up on high in heaven and there
[1:46:43] was a face to face with a face professor
[1:46:45] with reality he cried i'm unclean i'm
[1:46:48] i'm off on clean lips and i dwell among
[1:46:51] unclean people
[1:46:54] and then it was the cherub and took the
[1:46:56] tongues
[1:46:57] and the coal of fire from the altar and
[1:47:00] it touched them unclean lips and turned
[1:47:04] him from a coward or from from educated
[1:47:08] man a teacher
[1:47:10] a to a teacher i'm sorry to a prophet
[1:47:14] that the word of god could speak through
[1:47:18] now
[1:47:19] what makes the difference
[1:47:21] here he is saying what makes the
[1:47:23] difference what changed him was the fact
[1:47:25] that the chairman took the qualifier
[1:47:28] placed it upon his lips that's what
[1:47:31] changed him from who he was to who he
[1:47:33] became it took him from education into
[1:47:36] the other place it took him from just
[1:47:38] one that was learned and i knew that
[1:47:41] went into the temple and and and did all
[1:47:43] those things to one that would come and
[1:47:46] become the mouthpiece of god and the
[1:47:48] prophet he said sure while it was in the
[1:47:50] presence of god it says it was something
[1:47:53] different the thirst that he had had had
[1:47:57] reached a place then till he was filled
[1:47:59] within let me tell you friends i don't
[1:48:02] care how much church you joined how many
[1:48:05] how many names you put on you you put
[1:48:08] you put how many names you put on it
[1:48:12] says which is a way to go whether you
[1:48:14] are sprinkled baptized of whatever you
[1:48:17] are
[1:48:18] until you meet that person jesus christ
[1:48:21] that's the only thing that will that
[1:48:24] will that's the only thing that will
[1:48:26] really satisfy
[1:48:31] yeah yeah he is he's calling us and
[1:48:33] saying do you need to be satisfied do
[1:48:36] you desire this morning to be satisfied
[1:48:38] i said i want to be satisfied and the
[1:48:40] only thing that could be satisfied at
[1:48:43] first is for us this morning to come
[1:48:46] into the presence of god when the word
[1:48:49] is coming forth when the word is coming
[1:48:51] for when god has made himself known for
[1:48:53] you to come into his presence when he
[1:48:56] has made his promise when he said what
[1:48:59] he's gonna do in this generation you
[1:49:01] need to take that promise walk it back
[1:49:03] to him and say i need you to make this
[1:49:06] promise real to me and have that god
[1:49:09] come face to face with you that's the
[1:49:11] thing that satisfy
[1:49:16] we we oftentimes this doesn't satisfy we
[1:49:20] run to the other one this doesn't
[1:49:22] satisfy we run to another one we we try
[1:49:24] to satisfy this with this and that with
[1:49:27] this and and we run into a confusion or
[1:49:30] a person comes and oh you want to be a
[1:49:33] christian but yet you still want to be
[1:49:34] in the world you want to dress like the
[1:49:37] world but yet you want to be a christian
[1:49:39] so now you get to a place where you
[1:49:41] begin to compromise well you know i will
[1:49:43] do a little bit of work but i won't do
[1:49:45] all of it because i still need to serve
[1:49:48] god also
[1:49:50] oh my
[1:49:51] i tell you we are men of unclean lips
[1:49:54] all we need is to come into the presence
[1:49:56] of god because once the desires is
[1:49:59] changed then you don't have to worry
[1:50:01] about the outside the outside will
[1:50:04] follow why because when that thirst is
[1:50:06] satisfied when you come to a place where
[1:50:09] you know i've sold everything i've left
[1:50:12] the world i don't desire anything in the
[1:50:14] world i don't desire what it has to
[1:50:16] offer because the end of it is death i
[1:50:19] don't desire what the world is doing
[1:50:21] there's nothing in the world that
[1:50:22] attracts me once you are attracted by
[1:50:25] this living god then only your life can
[1:50:28] manifest the things which you are
[1:50:29] confessing
[1:50:35] the scripture says
[1:50:37] we are the light of the world
[1:50:43] but the thing about it is as our pastor
[1:50:45] was saying wednesday
[1:50:48] what we are manifesting is contrary to
[1:50:50] what we believe
[1:50:52] there seems to be a conflict
[1:50:56] we know within us there is a genuine
[1:50:59] desire
[1:51:00] to manifest christ
[1:51:02] within us we know for ourselves
[1:51:05] i know within myself that i desire to
[1:51:08] serve god that i desire to do well i
[1:51:12] desire to do this i desire to do this
[1:51:15] but yet i find myself doing this
[1:51:18] what's satisfied the only thing that can
[1:51:20] answer that satisfaction
[1:51:22] is to meet the one who placed the desire
[1:51:24] in there in the first place
[1:51:27] the more you meet with him the more the
[1:51:30] worldliness is stripped out of you
[1:51:32] the more you come in contact with him
[1:51:34] the more his desire becomes your desire
[1:51:37] the more you come in contact with him
[1:51:39] the more the worldliness gets away why
[1:51:42] because worldliness cannot enter into
[1:51:44] his presence
[1:51:47] why because the worldly desires and all
[1:51:50] those things cannot enter into his
[1:51:52] presence his presence is holiness his
[1:51:55] presence is perfection his presence is
[1:51:57] all those things as as you come closer
[1:52:00] the closer you get the more you are
[1:52:03] transforming to his image
[1:52:07] he says
[1:52:09] emotion won't do it
[1:52:12] he says you might jump up and down and
[1:52:14] shout and as long as you
[1:52:17] as long as you want to and you might run
[1:52:19] up and down the floor you might speak in
[1:52:22] tongue as much as you want to and then
[1:52:24] things
[1:52:25] and them things
[1:52:27] and
[1:52:27] and holy and good it says i i don't say
[1:52:31] nothing against that but until you meet
[1:52:34] that person that satisfy that satisfying
[1:52:37] portion
[1:52:38] that something that takes every fiber of
[1:52:42] your body
[1:52:43] not by emotion but by satisfaction
[1:52:48] he says
[1:52:50] and any and and and why we want to take
[1:52:53] it says why do we want to take a
[1:52:55] substitute when there is a genuine
[1:52:58] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:53:00] that satisfies every fiber it says in
[1:53:03] the longing of a human soul then
[1:53:05] standing right in the face of death like
[1:53:08] the great apostle paul all death wears
[1:53:10] your sting and grave where's your
[1:53:12] victory but thanks be to god
[1:53:14] who gives the victory through the lord
[1:53:17] jesus christ it says that's the
[1:53:19] experience brother that's satisfying the
[1:53:22] holy spirit hush thus he says that holy
[1:53:26] spirit thirsts in you it satisfies it
[1:53:29] you don't have to do anything else about
[1:53:32] it yes it cleans the lips
[1:53:37] it's the experience that cleans the lips
[1:53:41] it's the one that brings the cleaning
[1:53:42] that we have need of it's the only thing
[1:53:45] that brings us
[1:53:48] into the image of what we are looking
[1:53:50] for
[1:53:52] now
[1:53:52] i
[1:53:53] i didn't i i just i was just asking uh
[1:53:56] within my own self i said
[1:53:58] uh
[1:53:59] it becomes very important because
[1:54:02] we said men's nature but random says is
[1:54:05] to run away from god's presence and and
[1:54:08] the reason why we ran away i said is
[1:54:10] because we do not want to come and and
[1:54:14] be exposed
[1:54:16] you know but talks about a time where
[1:54:18] you know
[1:54:20] it says people will come in the prayer
[1:54:22] line and they would have to get out and
[1:54:24] go confess the sin before they come
[1:54:25] because they're going to be exposed
[1:54:27] and
[1:54:28] and i wonder within ourselves i began to
[1:54:31] ask myself i said
[1:54:32] if we got into a place where we are just
[1:54:35] satisfied with what we have
[1:54:39] you know
[1:54:40] as long as we can come to church
[1:54:42] the minister ministers and we receive
[1:54:45] and and and then god and and then we go
[1:54:49] we don't want any other manifestation
[1:54:51] except what we already have
[1:54:53] we we don't want
[1:54:55] thing to be called out of the door
[1:54:58] we don't want
[1:54:59] things that we have hidden within our
[1:55:01] heart to be exposed not necessarily
[1:55:04] exposed on the pulpit but we don't want
[1:55:06] we get to a place where we are
[1:55:08] comfortable within the measure of what
[1:55:10] we have received and we want to grow
[1:55:13] just that way stay that way and we don't
[1:55:16] want anything to disturb that
[1:55:20] now we i it's very important we realize
[1:55:24] in the economy of god the church is
[1:55:27] called into a higher manifestation
[1:55:30] in the economy of god the bride is
[1:55:32] called to come to a place where she can
[1:55:35] do the greater works where she can uh uh
[1:55:39] uh come and and be able to identify the
[1:55:42] two uh uh scripture the two spirits
[1:55:45] within the framework of the church and
[1:55:48] be able to withstand the evil one and to
[1:55:50] follow god she's called into the
[1:55:52] manifestation of christ in the end time
[1:55:55] and she's even called to a place where
[1:55:57] she can become the final voice and the
[1:56:00] only way we get to become the final
[1:56:02] voice it's not by education
[1:56:06] it's not by just being content if we
[1:56:08] desire more of god it means there's more
[1:56:10] of god to fill us with if we desire more
[1:56:13] of god it means there's more of god to
[1:56:15] be manifested
[1:56:17] the body of believer was made to be a
[1:56:19] place where we can come in here
[1:56:22] each one with a testimony of the great
[1:56:24] things that god has done within our
[1:56:27] daily lives and and talking to one
[1:56:29] another and realizing that god is
[1:56:31] working among us
[1:56:35] it was meant to be a place where a
[1:56:37] sinner can walk in and be convicted
[1:56:40] and be changed
[1:56:42] now
[1:56:43] before we can get to the sin or be
[1:56:46] changed we ourselves have to get
[1:56:48] ourselves into a position where we've
[1:56:50] come so close with his presence that he
[1:56:53] can manifest himself whichever way he
[1:56:56] chooses
[1:57:04] we we
[1:57:05] we have it we have to come to the place
[1:57:08] where we realize it it would take
[1:57:11] just as much
[1:57:12] as we'll get to it just as much as he
[1:57:15] took a backside of the desert for moses
[1:57:18] just as much as he took a backside of
[1:57:20] the desert for jacob just as much as he
[1:57:23] took a backside of the desert papal it
[1:57:26] would have to take a backside of the
[1:57:28] desert for each and every one of us
[1:57:31] not the congregation not within the body
[1:57:34] but each individual having gone to a
[1:57:36] back side of the desert having gone to a
[1:57:39] closet where god has been made real to
[1:57:42] you
[1:57:43] that's why the preaching of the word is
[1:57:45] not a place where we just come and you
[1:57:47] know one comes and he says things that
[1:57:49] you never heard before that was never
[1:57:51] the intention the intention was that we
[1:57:53] come here back for fellowship of what
[1:57:56] god has been doing in your life in his
[1:57:58] life in his life in the other person's
[1:58:00] life we come together and god is able to
[1:58:03] speak to us all why because each
[1:58:06] individual have been talking to him
[1:58:09] but the negolidium spirit is the one
[1:58:12] that texts people and he says you have
[1:58:14] to do nothing
[1:58:16] no effort
[1:58:18] don't even get in his presence because
[1:58:20] you'll die
[1:58:21] just stay away and let the preacher do
[1:58:24] all the talking and let the preacher do
[1:58:26] all they're doing in fact don't even
[1:58:28] testify don't even go out and let your
[1:58:31] light shine you just come as a sinner
[1:58:34] and every time your sin will be forgiven
[1:58:36] that's not the church that god is
[1:58:38] building the church that god is building
[1:58:41] it was not just peter on the day of
[1:58:43] pentecost in fact the scripture says
[1:58:45] about philip who was also there who was
[1:58:47] transported in another place what did
[1:58:50] that it was god moving in the midst
[1:58:54] the scripture says there were three
[1:58:56] thousand oh if we can record what each
[1:58:59] three thousand of them had done and what
[1:59:01] they had come in contact with the power
[1:59:03] that was manifested in their life
[1:59:05] there's not enough place in the book for
[1:59:07] us to put it
[1:59:09] why because it was god working in his
[1:59:11] people
[1:59:12] and it's the same way today with the
[1:59:14] revealing of the word and the end time
[1:59:16] we are being brought right back into
[1:59:18] that same condition so the same god can
[1:59:21] do the same thing
[1:59:25] he says
[1:59:30] when the first man as soon as he had
[1:59:32] sinned
[1:59:34] and done something wrong
[1:59:37] when god came into his presence
[1:59:40] oh he coming to the presence of god adam
[1:59:43] he could not stand in the presence of
[1:59:45] god
[1:59:46] he ran into hi and and hide himself in
[1:59:48] the bush and try to cover himself with
[1:59:51] fig lifts
[1:59:52] because he knew he knowed that he was
[1:59:54] standing in the presence of jehovah the
[1:59:57] creator
[1:59:59] that was the reaction of the first man
[2:00:01] and after he had sinned he tried
[2:00:04] he could not hide
[2:00:06] because he was standing it was it was
[2:00:09] tender yet
[2:00:10] sin had not took
[2:00:12] hold
[2:00:13] had not took hold of it
[2:00:15] as a root into his people's heart today
[2:00:18] but he was very conscious
[2:00:21] and he was standing before that he was
[2:00:23] standing he was standing before his
[2:00:26] creator
[2:00:27] now he hid himself with a bush bushes
[2:00:32] and
[2:00:33] and would not come out and could not
[2:00:35] come until god
[2:00:38] had made
[2:00:39] a preparation for him
[2:00:43] he said
[2:00:44] this is in the message's presence it
[2:00:46] says
[2:00:49] psalms 6 and 8 it says david said
[2:00:53] now i want you to to see the wisdom in
[2:00:55] what he's saying here
[2:00:58] david said
[2:01:01] i have set the lord always before me
[2:01:05] he says that's the thing that's a good
[2:01:07] thing to do
[2:01:09] psalm 8 16 8
[2:01:11] i have set the lord
[2:01:13] before me
[2:01:15] so i could not be confused about it
[2:01:20] he wanted to be conscious of his
[2:01:23] presence
[2:01:24] so david said
[2:01:26] i have sent the lord always before my
[2:01:29] face
[2:01:30] and now
[2:01:34] i david has set the load before my face
[2:01:37] always to be conscious of god's presence
[2:01:41] it says
[2:01:42] wouldn't be wouldn't that be good a good
[2:01:45] lesson for us tonight
[2:01:47] to set the lord before our faith so we
[2:01:50] won't
[2:01:51] so we'll be conscious of his presence
[2:01:54] put him first
[2:01:56] why
[2:01:57] put him first before you why
[2:02:00] then you won't sin
[2:02:02] when you are realizing
[2:02:04] that constantly you are in the presence
[2:02:06] of god
[2:02:10] oh my
[2:02:12] the reason we do it is because we fail
[2:02:15] to realize his presence
[2:02:17] here he's saying put him before you
[2:02:20] and remind yourself constantly in whose
[2:02:23] presence you are standing
[2:02:24] remind yourself within yourself i'm
[2:02:27] standing in front of god it don't matter
[2:02:29] whether i'm at the end of the earth so
[2:02:31] wherever i am it didn't matter whether i
[2:02:33] was at home at my job at school wherever
[2:02:36] i am the lord is always before me i
[2:02:39] couldn't do this because the lord is
[2:02:41] always before me why you make him a
[2:02:44] reality
[2:02:47] it's not because think about this
[2:02:50] if that's not the case then it's just
[2:02:52] the god of the book that you've left at
[2:02:54] home
[2:02:57] it's just a god that you come meet when
[2:02:59] you come to church
[2:03:02] it's just a god that you meet when you
[2:03:04] go in the gathering of the saints
[2:03:07] it's not the god that you take into your
[2:03:09] home
[2:03:10] it's not the god that you take to work
[2:03:12] you take everywhere because if it's the
[2:03:14] god that you take everywhere then you
[2:03:16] consciously have to be at a place where
[2:03:19] you realize i have always said the lord
[2:03:21] before me is before me right now is
[2:03:24] protecting me is guiding me is taking
[2:03:27] care of everything about me
[2:03:32] he says when you realize god is around
[2:03:35] you will watch what you say
[2:03:40] when you realize god is around
[2:03:42] you will watch what you say
[2:03:46] it says and a man when he thinks god is
[2:03:49] gone
[2:03:50] he cusses he will he will lust after
[2:03:53] women
[2:03:54] he will he will still he will cheat and
[2:03:56] lie he'll do anything when he thinks god
[2:04:01] don't see him
[2:04:05] but bring him into the presence of god
[2:04:08] he'll stop it right there
[2:04:11] the secret is the presence of god
[2:04:14] it changes us
[2:04:16] don't be afraid of it
[2:04:18] invite it every day when you walk up in
[2:04:20] the morning god i need your presence
[2:04:22] today when you go back at night god i
[2:04:24] need your presence wherever you are at
[2:04:26] your job at school it says god your
[2:04:28] presence without your presence i'm done
[2:04:31] without your presence i'm nervous i
[2:04:33] don't know what to say without your
[2:04:35] presence my mind is shot i'm confused
[2:04:37] and everything but when your presence is
[2:04:40] here i'm comfortable
[2:04:42] oh i tell you i recall the deeper call
[2:04:44] unto the deep yes the prophet just
[2:04:47] trying to put words together and talking
[2:04:49] about story some of them don't seem to
[2:04:51] make sense and everything but when the
[2:04:53] presence came into the building he said
[2:04:55] he's here and then after he came he says
[2:04:58] i take this building and everybody under
[2:05:00] my control why because he knew god was
[2:05:03] there with him
[2:05:04] oh if we can live life knowing that god
[2:05:07] is with us who can be against us who can
[2:05:10] stand against us it's not that he's
[2:05:13] against you is that he's there to take
[2:05:15] care of you
[2:05:18] it's there to protect you is there to
[2:05:21] take care about things concerning you is
[2:05:24] that to make sure that his promise is
[2:05:26] real when you run away from him you're
[2:05:28] running away from your deliverance
[2:05:39] he says
[2:05:42] but bring him into the presence of god
[2:05:44] and stop it right now
[2:05:46] and david said i have always put the
[2:05:48] load before me
[2:05:50] that's a good thing no wonder god said
[2:05:53] he was a man after his own heart
[2:05:55] it says man will do anything
[2:05:58] when he thinks god is not isn't near but
[2:06:02] when he realized god is near
[2:06:05] did you ever notice a sinner
[2:06:08] let a godly person
[2:06:10] let a godly person
[2:06:12] walk up
[2:06:14] he'll quit cursing
[2:06:16] if that ever happened to you
[2:06:18] you have a person and just running the
[2:06:20] mouse and everything and
[2:06:22] you just say you know you say perhaps
[2:06:24] you know i remember in my case i just
[2:06:26] said
[2:06:27] do you speak english
[2:06:30] is that all that you use is that all the
[2:06:32] vocabulary are you having
[2:06:34] and somebody else translated to him
[2:06:37] he's a christian
[2:06:39] and that was the end of the story
[2:06:41] don't be
[2:06:42] afraid don't be afraid
[2:06:45] and you didn't do it to post and show
[2:06:48] something
[2:06:49] you just want to be reverend you just
[2:06:51] want to make sure that the person
[2:06:53] realizes that you're not there by
[2:06:55] yourself
[2:06:57] there's somebody else with you
[2:06:59] and that person cannot stand that kind
[2:07:01] of language and that person that's with
[2:07:03] you cannot stay in that kind of
[2:07:04] environment
[2:07:06] so it's time to change the environment
[2:07:08] oh i tell you my brother my sister will
[2:07:10] live below our privileges
[2:07:12] and our privilege is to we are called to
[2:07:14] be sons and daughters of god that can
[2:07:16] change the atmosphere the prophet tells
[2:07:18] us now think about this the word is a
[2:07:21] seed the prophet tells us and the seed
[2:07:24] needs the perfect atmosphere in order
[2:07:26] for it to come up so the word all you
[2:07:29] need to do is just create the atmosphere
[2:07:32] all you need to do is just that's why i
[2:07:33] like that song it says take the name of
[2:07:36] jesus with you just whisper it just
[2:07:38] begin to mumble it within your mouth and
[2:07:40] just begin to say words and everything
[2:07:42] it will bring his presence why because
[2:07:44] he promised he will be dead
[2:07:49] well i'll tell you when i can't figure
[2:07:51] out what i'm doing and everything i'm
[2:07:53] doing just failing
[2:07:54] i just began to sing and you're like
[2:07:56] it's technology yeah god can help me
[2:08:00] if i can't figure it out i call upon his
[2:08:02] name
[2:08:04] if i don't know what i'm doing i call
[2:08:06] upon his name why because it's the
[2:08:08] privilege that's been given to you as a
[2:08:11] believer
[2:08:12] what is your privilege your privilege is
[2:08:14] you can call upon his presence to come
[2:08:17] into your location to come into the
[2:08:20] hospital to come into wherever you are
[2:08:22] the doctor said what they want to say
[2:08:24] that's good that's what they've said but
[2:08:27] i'm not done yet i need to call upon the
[2:08:29] master of circumstances to come and
[2:08:32] assist me why because i'm his child and
[2:08:35] i'm his daughter
[2:08:38] it's the privilege we've been given
[2:08:40] don't run away from it but one of them
[2:08:42] says it's the greatest privilege
[2:08:46] ever given to immortal
[2:08:49] is to walk with god
[2:08:51] to walk with him amen
[2:08:54] and he's here this morning
[2:08:56] desiring to walk with each and every one
[2:08:58] with you
[2:08:59] desiring to touch you to grab your
[2:09:02] attention to grab those attention to
[2:09:04] grab your attention he's desiring to
[2:09:06] come this morning to convict us of all
[2:09:09] the things that we do wrong to let us
[2:09:11] know that those things we're not
[2:09:13] supposed to do but when he's done
[2:09:15] convicting his year to give us the
[2:09:17] strength
[2:09:18] and the spirit in order for us to go out
[2:09:20] of here overcome us
[2:09:22] god has got the whole package he's just
[2:09:25] not got one side of things where he
[2:09:27] leaves you on your own and he convicts
[2:09:29] you and lets you cry until you cry your
[2:09:31] eyeballs out but it's here to provide
[2:09:33] what you have need of in order for you
[2:09:35] to walk out of this building and say i
[2:09:38] was doing this but now i'm changed why
[2:09:40] because i met god god spoke to me
[2:09:44] god could be speaking this morning to
[2:09:46] other people it's noise
[2:09:50] oh but let it be to you this morning
[2:09:52] that i'm hearing from god he's talking
[2:09:55] to my soul he knows what i have need off
[2:10:02] so i want to say this
[2:10:04] we're not going to get there by some
[2:10:06] form of theology
[2:10:08] we and i thought about this
[2:10:12] how many
[2:10:13] have you ever worked for somebody
[2:10:17] and yet you don't talk to them
[2:10:21] how would you know what to expect you to
[2:10:23] do that's right
[2:10:25] how do you receive your instructions of
[2:10:27] what you're supposed to do that day
[2:10:31] how can you work for someone
[2:10:34] how can you be
[2:10:35] in contact with someone but yet you
[2:10:38] don't communicate you don't come in
[2:10:40] contact with them
[2:10:43] that's the religion of the world i'll
[2:10:45] tell you that you asked me where is that
[2:10:47] it's all over the world it's every
[2:10:49] church around the corner people they go
[2:10:52] they receive they go they read the bible
[2:10:54] and they said oh god has talked to us
[2:10:57] and they go back home and they think
[2:10:58] that's the end of the story no he's got
[2:11:00] to come and make the bible a reality let
[2:11:03] me emphasize that why because intellect
[2:11:07] will fail
[2:11:08] you knowledge will change
[2:11:11] we know today more tomorrow we don't
[2:11:13] know even with the things we know we
[2:11:16] forget
[2:11:18] but the presence of god if someone has
[2:11:20] ever come into the presence of god it's
[2:11:23] not something you can ever forget
[2:11:26] you know i was thinking you know it's
[2:11:28] like one being in a car accident or
[2:11:30] being in a near-death experience it's
[2:11:33] something the moment you begin to talk
[2:11:35] about it it takes you right back into
[2:11:37] the circumstance you can remember every
[2:11:40] detail about what happened oh my brother
[2:11:43] my sister if we have that kind of memory
[2:11:45] for the things of the world how much
[2:11:47] more when god comes around you how much
[2:11:50] more when god wants to speak to you i
[2:11:52] tell you when he speaks it's something
[2:11:54] within your heart you know i did that
[2:11:56] because god told me to do it
[2:12:07] and it's not about
[2:12:08] how long
[2:12:09] we've been in the message
[2:12:12] oh how many services we attend
[2:12:15] even though that will cause you to do
[2:12:17] that
[2:12:19] but the real deal here this morning is
[2:12:22] i need
[2:12:23] to come face to face with him
[2:12:26] i need for everything i have need of
[2:12:29] i mean everything that i have need of
[2:12:32] i have to take it to him
[2:12:34] and he has to talk to me
[2:12:37] i have to take it to him and he has to
[2:12:40] speak to me i want to say this this
[2:12:42] morning
[2:12:43] i was uh just
[2:12:46] as i was thinking about this it just
[2:12:48] came to my mind i was thinking about
[2:12:49] david
[2:12:50] and i was thinking about david
[2:12:52] and and i thought this morning
[2:12:55] what's the reason why we have to come
[2:12:57] face to face
[2:13:00] we said it's because his presence
[2:13:03] is changing us
[2:13:06] this presence
[2:13:07] is perfecting us
[2:13:09] it's prep his presence is giving us
[2:13:12] purpose
[2:13:13] why we're even here where do i come from
[2:13:16] how did i get here where am i going he's
[2:13:18] answering the question every day
[2:13:20] by coming into his presence but i want
[2:13:23] to say this also
[2:13:24] and this is not by no means all that
[2:13:26] there is to it
[2:13:28] i want to say this this morning it's
[2:13:30] very important because
[2:13:32] he knows what lies ahead
[2:13:36] and you need to come to him
[2:13:39] so this morning he can equip you with
[2:13:42] what you need for the journey
[2:13:45] oh it just down on me i begin to think
[2:13:47] about david
[2:13:48] there he is one who was anointed to be
[2:13:51] king
[2:13:52] anointed just a little boy as shepherd
[2:13:55] it was not by accident that he was a
[2:13:57] shepherd boy
[2:13:58] that was a calling from his father
[2:14:01] it was not by accident that the bear
[2:14:03] came by his way it was not by accident
[2:14:06] that the lion came by his way
[2:14:08] all of that was preparation for what was
[2:14:10] to come if you had david he had no clue
[2:14:14] about what was happening he just knew
[2:14:16] this happened and god helped me he knew
[2:14:19] this happened and god helped me but god
[2:14:21] knew that there were going to come a
[2:14:22] goliath next so he had to prepare him
[2:14:25] for the journey ahead and then for him
[2:14:28] to prepare it david had to come face to
[2:14:30] face with this god and god delivered him
[2:14:33] therefore he can stand when he's going
[2:14:35] to fight golight and said i have met god
[2:14:38] and i know what i'm talking about there
[2:14:40] was a bear that came on my way that god
[2:14:43] showed up there was a lion that came on
[2:14:45] my way that god showed up and the same
[2:14:48] god who showed up over there he sent
[2:14:50] this prophet to anoint me for me to
[2:14:52] become king and if the anointing is a
[2:14:55] true anointing then this goliath means
[2:14:59] nothing
[2:15:01] he knows what's ahead and we are here
[2:15:04] this morning being prepared for the
[2:15:06] rapture oh my brother my sister we are
[2:15:09] here in preparation for that great day
[2:15:12] so in order for us to be prepared for
[2:15:14] what's to come we need to meet him here
[2:15:18] and him preparing us for the event
[2:15:20] giving us what we have need of dressing
[2:15:23] up with what we have need of so that
[2:15:25] when we get to that day we are equipped
[2:15:27] for the journey
[2:15:32] amen
[2:15:34] we can't make the journey ourselves
[2:15:55] and it's going through
[2:15:58] just the
[2:16:02] personal experiences in the bible
[2:16:08] and how
[2:16:10] that it changed those people
[2:16:14] and he gave them the ability
[2:16:17] for them to fulfill the promise for
[2:16:19] their age
[2:16:21] or for their season
[2:16:25] it took them coming face to face with
[2:16:27] god i want you to listen in the message
[2:16:30] faith it says
[2:16:33] how little was
[2:16:35] for abraham
[2:16:37] after he had endured after and seeing
[2:16:41] him was who was invisible
[2:16:43] how
[2:16:44] after he met god
[2:16:47] and had an experience after
[2:16:50] of talking face to face with god
[2:16:54] that he could
[2:16:56] call those things
[2:16:58] which were not as though they were
[2:17:02] what did that
[2:17:04] the experience
[2:17:06] the meaning face to face
[2:17:09] it says for he had an experience
[2:17:12] he had talked to god
[2:17:15] face to face
[2:17:17] that's what we need
[2:17:20] is a personal experience
[2:17:22] with a living god
[2:17:26] he moves on he talks about moses he says
[2:17:29] how that moses having 40 years of
[2:17:32] religious training
[2:17:33] by his mother
[2:17:35] how having 40 years of military might in
[2:17:38] his hand
[2:17:40] of how to whip a nation how to conquer
[2:17:46] and he taken god 40 years to take it out
[2:17:49] of him
[2:17:50] but once out there in the wilderness
[2:17:53] alone
[2:17:54] one day he came face to face with god
[2:17:58] in a burning bush
[2:18:02] he was better equipped in five minutes
[2:18:06] after he had talked with god
[2:18:09] than the 80 years of schooling he had
[2:18:12] done
[2:18:16] five minutes
[2:18:18] he was well equipped
[2:18:20] then all the 80 years
[2:18:25] i'll take the five minutes
[2:18:28] take the eight years i'll take the five
[2:18:30] minutes
[2:18:31] god just for five minutes if you can
[2:18:34] this morning just drop my my way
[2:18:37] touch me this morning i i want my life
[2:18:40] to reflect the message that i believe
[2:18:42] i don't want to act like the world i
[2:18:44] don't want to dress like the world i
[2:18:46] don't want to think like the world i
[2:18:48] don't want any part of me to be worldly
[2:18:51] i want to reflect a hundred percent the
[2:18:54] word of the hour what do i need i need
[2:18:56] five minutes
[2:18:59] i need five minutes god i need you to
[2:19:02] rip everything away from me that's off
[2:19:04] the world i need you to change me i need
[2:19:07] you to because that's the only way you
[2:19:09] become a testimony a testimony is not
[2:19:12] you reflecting your own life but it's
[2:19:15] something that god has done and it's no
[2:19:18] longer reflecting that person but it's
[2:19:20] god reflecting himself through
[2:19:22] when the woman at the well went and say
[2:19:25] i i have seen a man who's told me
[2:19:27] everything i had done within my mind i'm
[2:19:30] asking myself they all knew it
[2:19:34] they already knew it anyway but what the
[2:19:37] reason why he was saying it is because
[2:19:40] something different had happened to him
[2:19:42] and they could see it
[2:19:44] they were able to see that this is
[2:19:46] different what she's talking about is
[2:19:48] different yes we know about her life yes
[2:19:51] we know but the way she's talking about
[2:19:53] it what she's expressing right now is
[2:19:55] different from everything that she's
[2:19:56] expressed before
[2:19:59] we we cannot be stuck on jacob all the
[2:20:02] time and and jacob and his inability
[2:20:05] his conliness and and and the things
[2:20:07] that he was able to do there's got to
[2:20:09] come a time where we've met god face to
[2:20:11] face it's no longer jacob that's on
[2:20:14] display it's it's israel that's on
[2:20:16] display
[2:20:22] but it says god is a separator
[2:20:25] god is calling for total separation
[2:20:28] and the separation is not even us
[2:20:32] making up the separation
[2:20:34] but the separation is the fact that you
[2:20:37] receive god within your heart calls the
[2:20:39] separation from everything else in other
[2:20:42] words they don't mix your heart doesn't
[2:20:44] desire the things that you desire
[2:20:46] anymore but how can we say that we
[2:20:49] receive god and still stuck in in jacob
[2:20:54] amen
[2:20:56] and our life everywhere we speak it's
[2:20:58] jacob we see
[2:20:59] every time we do something is checkup
[2:21:01] that's manifested every time we try to
[2:21:03] do something it's jacob it's jacob the
[2:21:06] only way to kill jacob is to bring him
[2:21:09] into the presence of an angel bring him
[2:21:11] into the presence of this living god and
[2:21:13] let jacob die
[2:21:16] my brother my sister i tell you death is
[2:21:18] a wonderful thing because once you die
[2:21:21] he will resurrect you
[2:21:23] and your desire will be changed
[2:21:26] you will have a perfect hatred for the
[2:21:28] things of the world
[2:21:37] he says
[2:21:40] he he says
[2:21:42] he was a coward dying a thousand death
[2:21:46] and after meeting god
[2:21:49] he wished he had a thousand lives to die
[2:21:51] for christ
[2:21:53] he was ready to go
[2:21:55] there was nothing that could stop him
[2:21:58] though he had no army though he had
[2:22:01] though his education had no it was no
[2:22:03] good for him he couldn't fight
[2:22:06] he was he had no sword
[2:22:08] he didn't have
[2:22:10] any warriors any chariot back back with
[2:22:13] him as far as i as far as the waldis
[2:22:16] knew it
[2:22:17] but he would come face to face with god
[2:22:19] as an experience
[2:22:21] it says
[2:22:23] who had an armed angel
[2:22:26] of all the eternity and standing by him
[2:22:29] and moses went his way down with his
[2:22:32] wife on the straddle
[2:22:34] of of of this little old mule
[2:22:37] and a long
[2:22:38] it says in the long whisker hanging down
[2:22:41] i believe that ten thousand times ten
[2:22:44] thousand
[2:22:45] ten thousand times ten thousands of
[2:22:47] angel
[2:22:48] rode down those dusty roads with him
[2:22:54] he had an experience
[2:22:57] when you have an experience it's no
[2:22:59] longer about you
[2:23:03] you can ridicule yourself you could do
[2:23:05] all
[2:23:06] men can say all that they want to you
[2:23:09] everything they can talk and call you
[2:23:11] all kinds of name
[2:23:13] but random says you are it's a dead man
[2:23:15] they punch you when you punch a dead man
[2:23:17] he doesn't respond
[2:23:18] but if they punch you and see if you
[2:23:20] want to reply that means you're not dead
[2:23:22] yet
[2:23:25] if somebody says something to you you
[2:23:27] want to reply it means you're not dead
[2:23:29] yet
[2:23:30] if something happened you you're working
[2:23:32] out oh man i'm gonna get him
[2:23:34] i'm gonna really gonna get him back
[2:23:38] that means you're not dead yet
[2:23:43] we need to die
[2:23:45] we need to die and the only way to die
[2:23:47] is to come into his presence
[2:23:51] in closing
[2:23:54] i was thinking about jacob
[2:23:57] now i want you to realize the
[2:23:59] circumstances surrounding him
[2:24:02] but random says and uh for the sake of
[2:24:04] time i won't be able to read all of it
[2:24:07] jacob pretty much had all his life
[2:24:11] built on
[2:24:12] lies he lied his daddy
[2:24:16] his great his father-in-law
[2:24:19] figured out a way to get more goats than
[2:24:22] his father-in-law
[2:24:24] you know figure out how to kid he could
[2:24:27] get his brother to surrender
[2:24:29] no doubt he was i mean he spent all his
[2:24:32] life just working for the day that he so
[2:24:34] is going to say
[2:24:35] you know just take it
[2:24:38] he just waited i don't know how many
[2:24:40] times they tried before that time
[2:24:45] bone a shyster
[2:24:48] a splendor the scripture says
[2:24:50] here it comes in
[2:24:53] and gone and had a family and all those
[2:24:55] things
[2:24:57] finally
[2:24:58] his day of reckoning was at the end
[2:25:01] he had to come and meet all the past all
[2:25:04] the wrong that he had done because
[2:25:06] remember
[2:25:07] he was trying to go back to his country
[2:25:09] the angel told him to go back he said he
[2:25:12] needs to go back so now he's coming back
[2:25:14] to where it all started where all the
[2:25:17] lies everything
[2:25:19] and here is he is at the final minute
[2:25:21] trying to divisive in a plan by which it
[2:25:24] can save even half of his family if he
[2:25:26] so decide to kill them
[2:25:30] finally
[2:25:32] he has a moment where he's alone
[2:25:37] and the scripture says he prayed
[2:25:40] he said oh god
[2:25:41] of my father
[2:25:43] isaac
[2:25:45] he said you're the one that told me to
[2:25:46] go
[2:25:48] it says he realized that he was in
[2:25:49] desperation he needed
[2:25:51] to come face to face
[2:25:53] he realized that what he had even his
[2:25:56] own plan that he devised was not going
[2:25:58] to be sufficient
[2:26:01] for everything that he had done even his
[2:26:03] own plan was not enough to save him
[2:26:06] now he had to come face to face with god
[2:26:09] and the scripture says that he came and
[2:26:13] he was by himself
[2:26:17] and it says a man came
[2:26:21] and he began to wrestle with him
[2:26:25] he began to wrestle with him all night
[2:26:28] he began to pray
[2:26:31] he began to intercede he began to cry
[2:26:34] out he began to call
[2:26:36] he began to look by all means to save
[2:26:38] his life how can my life be said what
[2:26:41] can i do he began he was ready to give
[2:26:43] up everything if if esau was to offer
[2:26:47] him you just come i'll kill you and
[2:26:49] leave your family alone he would have
[2:26:50] taken it
[2:26:51] that's how desperate it was he was
[2:26:53] looking for a way he send his family and
[2:26:56] he's he's like he's tried everything
[2:27:02] he needed god to come to his assistance
[2:27:06] and the scripture says that he came and
[2:27:08] he prayed
[2:27:10] and he began to wrestle with this man
[2:27:14] and they wrestle and the wrestling and
[2:27:17] the day's about to break
[2:27:20] and the man the angel said the man says
[2:27:27] and it says and he wrestled all night
[2:27:29] and
[2:27:30] when he looked like the day was coming
[2:27:32] to break it says
[2:27:34] let me go i pray
[2:27:39] and jacob wouldn't let him go
[2:27:45] you see he was serious about something
[2:27:49] he touched the hollow of his eye of his
[2:27:52] uh
[2:27:54] tie in order for him to stop him
[2:27:58] but jacob that was not enough to stop
[2:28:00] him
[2:28:02] he wrestled with him he wrestled with
[2:28:03] him he says i won't let you go until you
[2:28:05] bless me
[2:28:09] do we get to that place do we go face to
[2:28:12] face and wrestle with god with every
[2:28:14] promise with every scripture with the
[2:28:17] promise with with whatever his promise
[2:28:19] says whatever our circumstances it says
[2:28:21] god i'm staying here i'm here until you
[2:28:24] bless me
[2:28:26] he wrestled with him and
[2:28:29] in verse 26 it says and let it says let
[2:28:32] me go for the day breaketh and i said i
[2:28:34] will not let thee
[2:28:36] go except that bless me.
[2:28:40] now
[2:28:42] i want you to think and ask yourself a
[2:28:44] question
[2:28:45] what kind of blessing was jacob looking
[2:28:47] for
[2:28:49] he had the cattle he had the family
[2:28:52] he had money he was not a poor man
[2:28:55] what kind of blessing was he looking for
[2:28:58] he was looking for a blessing
[2:29:00] that all his worldly good could not give
[2:29:02] him
[2:29:05] he was looking for something
[2:29:07] that none of what he had gone so far
[2:29:10] with
[2:29:11] was good enough
[2:29:14] his children was not good enough his
[2:29:15] wives were not good enough his cattle
[2:29:17] his servants everything none of it was
[2:29:19] good enough he needed something more
[2:29:22] amen
[2:29:25] so he said and he said
[2:29:29] now i think this is
[2:29:31] very profound when he says i won't let
[2:29:34] you go until you bless me
[2:29:36] his next question is
[2:29:38] what is your name
[2:29:42] what is your name
[2:29:45] it said
[2:29:46] my name is jacob
[2:29:50] in other words i'm the supplanter
[2:29:53] i'm the liar
[2:29:55] i'm the cheater
[2:29:58] i'm the conniver i'm all of these things
[2:30:02] he confessed
[2:30:04] what he was
[2:30:06] the presence of god brought him to a
[2:30:08] confession
[2:30:10] of what he really knew about himself
[2:30:15] and it's only after he confessed his
[2:30:18] weakness and everything about him
[2:30:22] then the next verse he said and he said
[2:30:24] unto him
[2:30:29] and he said
[2:30:31] thy name shall be called no more jacob
[2:30:34] but israel
[2:30:40] and why
[2:30:41] for as a prince
[2:30:44] thou has power with god
[2:30:46] and with man
[2:30:48] and it prevail
[2:30:50] now i i the reason why i i just i'm
[2:30:53] saying this so slowly is because i
[2:30:55] really want this to sink
[2:31:00] it's in his presence that these things
[2:31:02] can happen it's not within our own minds
[2:31:05] we can't make ourselves something we're
[2:31:07] not
[2:31:08] when we come before him we tell him who
[2:31:10] we are we tell him what we've done we
[2:31:13] tell him i'm wrong we tell him all those
[2:31:15] things
[2:31:16] and he is the one who's giving a new
[2:31:18] name
[2:31:22] and here he is changing his name before
[2:31:25] even any manifestation could come
[2:31:28] because why because the new name was
[2:31:31] going to come with new
[2:31:33] manifestation why because the new name
[2:31:35] was going to come with a new character
[2:31:38] why because the new name with the name
[2:31:40] jacob he could have never power with god
[2:31:43] and overcome
[2:31:45] with the name jacob he could have never
[2:31:47] done anything right with the name jacob
[2:31:50] he was going to continue to be what he
[2:31:52] was but with the new name that he was
[2:31:54] given
[2:31:56] israel he was able to extend
[2:31:58] and be able to produce what god wanted
[2:32:00] him to produce
[2:32:02] so yeah he was and he said his name and
[2:32:06] and after that
[2:32:09] he said
[2:32:11] the name shall be no more
[2:32:13] jacob but israel has thou power with god
[2:32:15] and prevail and jacob asked him he said
[2:32:18] tell me i pray
[2:32:21] i pray thee thy
[2:32:22] name and it says wherefore is it that
[2:32:26] thou
[2:32:27] asked after my name and he blessed them
[2:32:31] they blessed them there
[2:32:33] and jacob called the name of the planet
[2:32:37] and i want to say this this morning in
[2:32:39] closing
[2:32:41] it's very important
[2:32:43] that we have a place
[2:32:46] or we have the awareness
[2:32:48] of the presence of god within our lives
[2:32:52] that there's a place where we can go
[2:32:55] and talk with god
[2:32:56] there's an awareness god is walking with
[2:32:59] me in the things that i'm doing
[2:33:01] because why it takes its presence for it
[2:33:04] to bring the change that we have need of
[2:33:06] it takes his presence to change us into
[2:33:08] the things that he would like us to do
[2:33:10] he came in this last age he gave us a
[2:33:12] new name but the only way we can bring
[2:33:15] the manifestation of the bride name
[2:33:18] is we have to come into his presence in
[2:33:21] fact it says that we have to be one
[2:33:24] with him
[2:33:27] he's saying that the harmony has to
[2:33:29] exist
[2:33:30] he says that he know that for the name
[2:33:32] to be manifest we have to come to a
[2:33:35] place where there's a union
[2:33:37] where we've known him we've come face to
[2:33:39] face why because
[2:33:41] he's the only one who can tell you what
[2:33:43] the name means
[2:33:45] i mean let's stand this morning
[2:34:06] says
[2:34:32] he says
[2:34:36] now he had divided the land
[2:34:39] and there were 12 tribes to divide it by
[2:34:43] it says now what if
[2:34:45] he had
[2:34:47] some picked up the the the pats and
[2:34:51] what if he had a tribe
[2:34:54] of
[2:34:55] god
[2:34:57] better than he did the tribe of
[2:34:59] ephraim
[2:35:01] the tribe of joseph better than he did
[2:35:03] judah
[2:35:04] but he didn't do that
[2:35:06] he didn't do it that way he divided it
[2:35:09] according to the word
[2:35:11] revealed by his spirit
[2:35:13] he divided it according to the tribe and
[2:35:15] notice
[2:35:16] notice he had done it by revelation by
[2:35:19] discernment
[2:35:21] by discernment of god's spirit in it
[2:35:25] he says
[2:35:27] each of those hebrew mothers
[2:35:29] giving giving
[2:35:31] birth to those babies called their name
[2:35:34] and each their name
[2:35:37] each of the name has a meaning
[2:35:40] jacob when he was born
[2:35:43] being a twin
[2:35:45] she called him supplanter
[2:35:48] but when he had gotten overcoming power
[2:35:51] and wrestle with an angel
[2:35:53] god changed his name
[2:35:55] from jacob to israel it prince
[2:35:59] the name has a meaning to do with your
[2:36:02] life
[2:36:03] when peter fisherman over had overcome
[2:36:08] by his faith in jesus he said your name
[2:36:11] is simon
[2:36:14] but i'm going to call you peter
[2:36:17] which is a little rock
[2:36:20] [Music]
[2:36:22] it changes you and it says and it
[2:36:24] changes you your name has something to
[2:36:27] do with it
[2:36:28] and your placement in life
[2:36:31] [Music]
[2:36:33] now
[2:36:34] i want you to realize that
[2:36:37] joseph had a
[2:36:38] joseph but jacob had a different
[2:36:40] placement in life
[2:36:44] but he couldn't get there as long as it
[2:36:46] was jacob
[2:36:47] [Music]
[2:36:49] he was to be the father of nation and do
[2:36:51] great things and all those things
[2:36:54] he was to be there and and and become
[2:36:56] one a princess powered with god and out
[2:36:59] of him and and how that the the the
[2:37:02] tribe and how the view of the children
[2:37:04] can come and all those things but none
[2:37:06] of that could come
[2:37:09] until he was changed
[2:37:12] and i want to say this it's very
[2:37:14] important we realize
[2:37:16] we cannot move into the blessings
[2:37:19] or in the place that god has placed for
[2:37:21] us
[2:37:22] in the place where god has called us to
[2:37:24] be
[2:37:25] unless we accept this name change
[2:37:29] this dying to ourselves
[2:37:31] this coming face to face to an angel
[2:37:34] this touching i want to say this when
[2:37:36] jacob where here is jacob
[2:37:40] physically speaking
[2:37:42] he had less of an art
[2:37:45] to win when he meets
[2:37:47] esau why because
[2:37:50] now he's even handicapped
[2:37:53] by meeting the angel
[2:37:55] [Music]
[2:37:57] the angel touches him and he touches the
[2:37:59] hollow and he goes back worse off
[2:38:03] physically speaking
[2:38:05] but oh my
[2:38:07] just like the angel said his name was no
[2:38:09] longer jacob but it was changing to
[2:38:12] israel and he stood there knowing that
[2:38:15] jacob had already died i'm going to meet
[2:38:18] esau as israel
[2:38:24] he knew that he was no longer jacob
[2:38:26] going there he didn't go over there he
[2:38:28] didn't matter what happened to him what
[2:38:30] mattered to him is he met the angel
[2:38:33] what mattered to him is he met god what
[2:38:36] mattered to him that he knew that he was
[2:38:38] changed he was no longer the same person
[2:38:40] that he used to be but my sister what
[2:38:42] matters to us is not what people think
[2:38:44] about us it's not what we were or what
[2:38:47] we can do as a human and everything what
[2:38:50] mattered this morning is i've come into
[2:38:52] the presence of god my life has been
[2:38:55] changed i'm no longer the same person
[2:38:57] you can call me all you want to you can
[2:38:59] say all you want to i know this is not
[2:39:02] the same person that you're meeting
[2:39:04] right
[2:39:04] [Music]
[2:39:06] and the same god who changed the name
[2:39:09] the same god will fight your battles
[2:39:12] the same god who changed your name
[2:39:15] the same god will take care of the
[2:39:17] circumstances
[2:39:18] the same god who changed you
[2:39:21] the same god will take care of all your
[2:39:22] needs
[2:39:23] [Music]
[2:39:27] the challenge is
[2:39:29] it seems like we want to keep our names
[2:39:32] we want to keep doing what we're doing
[2:39:35] he's saying no i want you to die
[2:39:37] there's a new name that i have for you
[2:39:39] and in the new name
[2:39:41] it's i've given you a new name
[2:39:44] but it's for me to come into that name
[2:39:47] and manifest what i need to manifest
[2:39:49] through you
[2:39:50] let's just my head this morning
[2:39:54] our gracious father we're so thankful
[2:39:55] lord for everything you do for us
[2:39:59] lord
[2:40:01] from the bottom of my heart this morning
[2:40:05] this is just not a sermon to preach and
[2:40:07] do
[2:40:08] but this is a desire of my heart lord
[2:40:10] that
[2:40:13] lord that the old me may die lord
[2:40:18] lord that i may die and receive the new
[2:40:20] name lord

[2:40:24] myself and looking at myself over and
[2:40:27] over over and over
[2:40:28] [Music]
[2:40:30] but lord you say that if i come face to
[2:40:32] face with you lord that you'll be able
[2:40:34] to kill it and bring it anew
[2:40:37] and i pray this morning father that you
[2:40:39] do it according to your word oh god
[2:40:42] lord that if there be any desiring this
[2:40:45] morning that would die to ourselves and
[2:40:48] be born a new lord and father
[2:40:51] your prophet said it's not the new
[2:40:53] isn't it's not the old made over but
[2:40:55] it's a new creation everything about it
[2:40:58] is brand new nothing of it reflects the
[2:41:01] old one that's what we desire low this
[2:41:03] morning to be brought into such a
[2:41:05] presence where this man can be killed
[2:41:08] every day this man can be killed and die
[2:41:12] every day where we can rise every day

[2:44:55] amen what a wonderful service this
[2:44:57] morning i
[2:44:58] i was just thinking as brother billy was
[2:45:00] preaching this morning the importance of
[2:45:03] of his presence in our life
[2:45:07] because this presence at the asthma it's
[2:45:09] the atmosphere where our seed could grow
[2:45:13] you know you can have the sun
[2:45:15] you could have the seed in the ground
[2:45:18] but unless it's that proper atmosphere
[2:45:20] for the seed to take place and the rain
[2:45:23] to be able to fall on the ground and
[2:45:24] soften the ground and the sun when it
[2:45:27] shines upon it now the seed could
[2:45:29] produce the manifestation
[2:45:32] and not only any any manifestation but
[2:45:34] it's
[2:45:35] it's no longer i that liveth
[2:45:37] but it's christ that liveth inside of me
[2:45:40] how many people could how many of you
[2:45:41] could say that this morning that is no
[2:45:43] longer i that lives
[2:45:45] but i want christ to live inside of me
[2:45:47] and when i leave this place i can take
[2:45:49] this atmosphere with me
[2:45:51] i can take this presence with me
[2:45:53] and we can profess marxist mark 16 doing
[2:45:57] this
[2:45:58] in his name because we carry his name
[2:46:01] amen i have this on my heart this
[2:46:02] morning sister laura if you want to
[2:46:04] just come sing the song for us uh my
[2:46:06] redeemer lives

[2:46:10] brother billy was talking about the sun
[2:46:12] and
[2:46:13] the sea and how he puts things in
[2:46:16] in orbit and
[2:46:18] how things just are so beautiful in his
[2:46:20] eyes
[2:46:21] hey man let's just sing this morning

[2:47:45] where to hide till evening
