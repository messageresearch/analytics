being aparted to you're believing children we want to commit this service to you with thanksgiving in our hearts we pray in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen [Music] it's certainly a privilege once again to speak to you from our hearts out of the Eternal Word of God so wonderful whenever you feel the call of God and you know that God he's on he's on the scene and he's faithful we certainly appreciate that and just if we can go into the scripture I'm gonna speak to you tonight a little bit something that's that's on my heart I just you know it's times you know there's certain chaos is going on in the whole world and and I think this is a wonderful opportunity for us to you know just take a you know moments like these and just reflect like our pastor said about you know taking a step back and getting like a bird's eye view and to really get the bigger picture and I think it's times like these that we have an opportunity to really to really refocus you know and to really come back to what is my heart purpose well what is what is the purpose of my existence and where did I come from and where you know what is what is what am I here for and where am I going after this and so you know we draw strength from the Word of God and so we just want to share a little bit of a thought out of the Gospel of Mark chapter 16 in mark chapter 16 this is after the resurrection and we'll read verse 15 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up in into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere and the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following a man a man you may have your seeds I also want to look into just a couple more scriptures and you know the thought that's that's bubbling on my heart I just I I believe I won't be long tonight that you know something that that struck me about a month ago and I just I feel like it's a good time for us to personalize the Commission and so I think if we can look also in the example in Matthew Matthew chapter 28 and in verse in verse 1 it says in the end of the Sabbath as it began to dawn towards the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled the stone from the door that sat upon it and I just think about when I read that Scripture and I just like I said I think it's time that we personalized the Commission he said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel and these signs shall follow them that believe so so the Commission is is to say what he said and watch how God will confirm what he said and so I just I looked at this I looked at this Scripture and I just couldn't help but think about when the prophet of God for our day actually was a mount sunset and there was a great earthquake that transpired and there was going to be a breaking of the seals and so as I'm reading about the the resurrection and so so if we can just just continue to read here a little bit it says and his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow and through and for fear of him the keepers did shake and did and become as dead men and the angel answered and said unto the woman fear not ye for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified he is not here for He is risen and he said come see the place where the Lord lay and go quickly and tell disciples that He is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you and Galilee and there shall you see him lo I have told you and I think that's wonderful and that's so if if I was going to speak the subject matter is to go tell my disciples I have risen and so when we consider what our commission is what our call is what our duty is he said when when he commissioned his disciples he said go into all the world and preach the gospel and I'll back up what what promises I've made and so as as we just consider you know the Word of God you know you think about your personal testimony and and I can't help but see you know how God in this endtime has has had an open door you know now there's an open door in heaven and gods he's bidding his subjects come let me prove whatever your need is whatever circumstance you find in yourself in your situation let me prove myself that I'm a healer let me prove to you that I'm a counselor let me prove to you that I'm a comforter and Almighty God amen and so we just you know we certainly we think about how that you know in this end time there would be a great deception that that has gone forth and and you know when when there was a great stone that was rolled over that that cave you know the enemy tried to come and fight against the word at that time and so there was a big denominational stone road over the tomb and so when when Jesus Christ did what he said he would do and he raised from the dead now the the the stone was rolled away and he he said now to go and tell my disciples that I have raised from the dead and so now we just as we consider this you know we want to look and just see the pattern and parallel and draw strength from the Word of God because you know it's it's it just it just struck me how that God has a way of guarding his gospel you know and you can see let's turn in to revelations and we'll just read in chapter 4 revelations chapters Force's after I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the the first voice which I I heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show you things that must come hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne that was set in heaven and one sat on the throne well I think that's so profound when today many people are trying to chop God up into three or many gods but the Bible's saying here that there was one that sat upon the throne and it wasn't it says and he that sat on the throne looked like Jasper and sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about him around about the throne and in this and in the sight like emerald and round about the throne was four and twenty set seats and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting and clothed with white raiment and they had on their heads golden crowns crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunders and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne there were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first beast was like in a lion and the second like a calf and the third like the face of a man and the fourth beast like a flying eagle and these four beasts each having six wings about him and they were full a full of eyes within and rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was which is and is to come and you know the the Prophet teaches about how that in the Old Testament there was these the the the the four patriarchs talking about Dan being the representing here the flying eagle and and on the the one side was the the calf and on the other side was the man and then the flying eagle and that the the first beast was the the lion of the tribe of Judah and that was guarding the the Holies the the very word of God and and so we're looking today and we want to see how that God in a parallel and in a pattern he also has protected the way back to the garden okay and so something that I just didn't simplicity just feel a little bit you know to to point to because if we can see there's an open door if we can point others when we've come in and we've partaken of you know the Tree of Life because you know at the beginning they couldn't take they couldn't partake of the Tree of Life because it hadn't been made flesh yet okay so now now that we've come on this side now we've partake of the Tree of Life we've tasted and see that he is good and he is faithful he is a healer then now from that standpoint we can now personalize and say well the word said it I've partaken in it and he can do it for you he can he's done it for me if you take him on the same approach in the same basis then you also will receive the benefit Amen so one of the things that you know it's just it's extremely profound in it just it just invigorates my so I get really excited thinking about it but you know when Moses you know when he was told to make what he saw in heaven make make in the likeness on earth and you know that the table the altar the the Ark and and you know I just think that within those those things they're symbols that are extremely profound adjusting limps of something that I think it can really be food for our souls today and so in like a parallel brother branham teaching about how the four Gospels you know Matthew Mark Luke and John are actually guards to - to - to protect and - to the entrance back into the - the Holy Ghost and so you think about the the gospel being guards and now so I just feel - maybe read a scripture and you know it's it's you know one of the great purposes is God's going to reflect his very characteristics what he intended at the very beginning before the fall man and so in Genesis chapter 1 and it says in verse 11 it says and God said let the earth bring forth grass and herbs yielding seed and and fruit trees yielding after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and so it was and so we know that God he's placed transforming power with his within his seed within every seed that he planted it has the power to reproduce itself and then God he had commissioned he said this in verse 26 he said now let us make man in our own image in our likeness and let us let them have dominion so so God commissioned them to be a God on earth to have dominion to be to watch over his creation and to have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowls of the air over the cattle and over all the earth and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and he and so God created the man in his own image and the image of God created he them male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said to them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that creepeth that moveth upon the earth and God said behold I have given unto you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of the tree yielding seed it is for you for meat so this is a eternal Word of God is an eternal thought of God that has to come to an expression it has to be manifested and and we know that Jesus Christ was the first of many brethren to come and therefore there was there was a a carrier or a there was a believer that this word of promise finally can anchor in in Mary and she came to the place where she said according to the promise of the angel be it unto me and I just believe it's the heart's cry that we say God what you originally commissioned me let me be fruitful and multiply your eternal thoughts and so you know as we consider those things I may be just kind of doing like a little just walk through the Bible a little study of a thought in Genesis chapter 3 and this this is after you know God had had caused into to depart out of he's like now they're gonna have to leave the garden but God he clothed them with animal skins and that was that was now God was going to do something for a man to bring about a restoration and so he said in in verse 22 of chapter 3 says and the Lord said Behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so now God's sending him out of the garden and so he drove the man out and he placed him on the east of the garden cheer bums and flaming swords which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life you know I just I I thought you know we've been really digging through the church age and book and studying it and and as I was thinking about something that the Prophet was talking about in the church age book it it you kind of brought me to this place in Genesis about how that he placed those cherubims and those cherubims are typed out as the two cherubim that their wings touched and they they were over the mercy seat and so as brother Branham described that that they had a flaming sword that it was death to come back into the garden because now they were guarding the way back to the Tree of Life and so they were turning every way and there's only four ways they're north south east and west and so I love how the prophet of God depicts that and and and Pro trays it in I can't remember the exact message but he talks about how that was the the the for the the four tribes in the Old Testament but the New Testament was the four Gospels you know John being the Eagle anointing and then with Luke was the the man the Ox anointing and then the the lion anointing and to keep the way to the Tree of Life and it's just it's just extremely profound to me that the the when when people took the the first church age messenger Paul and there was a restoration or there was a feeling of the Holy Spirit and then they did the very acts that Jesus did and that was the commission that God said but he now he warned him he said now after my departure Paul saying after my departure Grievous wolves will come in and so what did they start doing they started sewing lies and you know I just you know I'll read a couple of quotes out of the church age book to just kind of you know it's it's good to notice things it's good to notice things like that are happening but I don't think that that should be the very focus like all of the stuff that's going around you we know that the world is headed and and going down into the pit but but for us we want to stay focused and to fulfill the purpose which God commissioned us and and he's promised to empower us with the very promise and God can't fail and so he's asking us he said now know when you receive this promise he said now let it live let it shine before all men that they may glorify your father which is in heaven you know there's a lot of talk about you know people fearing this and fearing that but anytime that the Scriptures refer to this phrase fear not this is something that stood out and I'll just share it with you says that every time the Lord uses these words fear not there is an engagement at hand which will involve great danger and suffering and depravation now he's not saying this to blurt or in a curt manner but he's saying tribulation is coming but that would bring fright to one but like a mother who is about to turn the light off and gently tell her child not lest he be frightened now don't be afraid the light will go out and it will be dark but I am here with you so he says don't be afraid of what man can do to you I am with you my grace is sufficient for you and when you pass through the waters they will not overflow you not even death are you not even in death are you defeated and you are more than conquerors you know I just think you know I take great comfort in that you know you know if if I have to go through something and I just say I know that you're gonna be with me I know that your grace is gonna supply every single step of the way whatever it seems no matter what the circumstance looks like no matter how bad the situation or the diagnosis God is faithful and he promised and he can't lie so he's with the Saints amen amen and so I just you know our liberty and our freedom is connected to truth and when the enemy comes he comes in like a flood the Spirit of God will raise up the standard and those who are partakers of the Tree of Life the very truth of God's Word they're the ones that are that's being lifted up at this end time and so another this is out of the Philadelphian Church age and brother Brown speaking about in Revelations that says I will keep thee in the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the the earth this verse is not a declaration to the true church will go into the the through the tribulation if it meant that it would have said so but it said I will keep you from the hour of temptation this temptation is actually exactly like the temptation in Eden it will be very inviting proposition held in a direct opposition to two gods commanded word so so we're setting in the very scene of the Garden of Eden again The Tree of Life is there and the Tree of Knowledge is here and so now he says and yet from the standpoint of human reason it will be so very right so enlightening so life-giving as to fool the world only the very elect will not be fooled the temptation will come as follows thank the Lord for the eyes to this last day the ecumenical move that started on what seemed to be a beautiful blessed principle fulfilling Christ prayer that we all might be one become so strong politically that she bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to principles and acted into law so that no people will will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect denomination of this council little groups will lose their charter privilege etc until they lose all property and spiritual rights with people for the example now unless you have a ministerial a local Ministerial Association approved in many if not all cities one can be can cannot rent a building for religious services and to become a chaplain in the Armed Services or a hospital it is now mandatory to recognize as acceptable to the trinitarian ecumenical group Amen that's the hour we're living in and there's nothing new Under the Sun this is just a repeat of what happened at the first church as the pressures increase and it will it will be harder to resist the into to resist is to lose privilege and so many will be tempted to go along and they will feel that it would be better to sir publicly within the framework of the organization then to not serve God at all publicly but they err to believe that Devils lions to serve Satan even though they may want to call him Jehovah but the elect will not be deceived thanks be to God that the elect will not be deceived but I believe that we're in a time right now where we want to equip ourselves with the truth and not be ignorant of the enemy's devices how he'll he'll even use political systems he'll even use the financial burdens of life to to get people to compromise on the the teaching of the Trinitarian ecumenical groups alright they're gonna lose privileges and and this is my encouragement to each one of us and I take it to myself that they will lose privileges and the temptation is because they want to serve God in the public I'm just saying let's personalize the Commission of God we don't have to have a big badge that somebody hands us out well done you fed this many people you had this a big pat on the back but you know what it's just in our everyday life serving God and letting people know that he's the same yesterday today and forever that he'll do the same thing he's ever done and to be faithful to his word if you take God at His Word watch how he moves on the scene for you he says furthermore the very elect will not only be kept but this move becomes the image erected to the Beast and the Saints will be gone in a rapture a man so we're living in a time where we're seeing there's actually coming forth a maturing of those tears and now now there's a binding so so we can see the modern events are being made clear because these things were spoken years and years ago but it's easy to look at those things and fear and dread but what I'm saying now is though the tears are ripening and maturing and that might be more evident to you but I want to tell you tonight the the wheat seed has been maturing alongside and God is preparing to fulfill his word to bring full restoration watch when that little bride becomes persecuted watch how that third pool is activated watch how that creative power now as they speak the word in their situations I need a job God's faithful Amen he's still Jehovah Jireh oh I heard the testimony that God's still a job giver a man and so he's so faithful hallelujah you know I just I I thank God that he sent Paul and and God he by revelation revealed to him things that we needed and so as that that way back to the tree of life had been guarded by those two cherubims and those four beasts powers in the the the Gospels they were protecting a way back to the baptism of the Holy Ghost back to the life to be able to take part in the bread of life so these things that come upon us we know that he's with us and not even death what will conquer us and he says now this little delightful winsome movement that will start that started out in fellowship at the Ephesians will become a monster of Satan that defiles and deceives the whole world and this church system of the Roman Catholic and the Protestants in coming together will control the whole wealth of the world and force the whole earth into a religious trap or will kill them by refusing them the privilege of buying or selling whereby they would make a living this will be accomplished simply for the harlots daughters are all but gone back to her in the meantime Rome will acquire nearly all the supplies of gold and the Jews have the bonds and all the paper at the right time the harlot will destroy the present-day money system by calling all of the paper and demanding the gold with no gold the system fails and the Jews will be trapped into an alliance and the harlot church will take over the whole world this this world is headed for a cliff where they're gonna enthroned the Antichrist be system amen but because God has given you an ear to hear and eyes to see the the prophet of God already told us in advance what was going to transpire and when we see this time now we can say I know you're with me I know you're in me I know there's a purpose while I'm still here you know it's not a time to dread for the for the believer it's time to take God's promises and say I have been given an inheritance I have loved ones I have needs in my body I had needs within my neighborhood I had you know and God's he's he's so Willie and he's wanting to come on the scene right now and give you courage to claim your god-given right so when the world is going and and they're manifesting that Kingdom and the power that he has is fear to bind up to oppress and to subjugate and to enforce that power but God on the other end is by love wooing us back to the garden and thus recognizing God's has a provided way and that's the blood of Jesus Christ and so when we consider those things we want to look at those two those two cherubims I just I can't help but see I almost see like Paul and and brother branham those those prophet messengers protecting the mercy seat and when the word was preached now we had a former and a latter rain so now there's a teaching rain that has gone forth and it's been sowed into our generation and now there's a crop that is receiving the word of the hour and now it's beginning to produce a life of Christ that's not dead he but he said I'm risen and where is my where am I where am I where's my dwelling place where's the place of my rest and so he's now he's looking for altars he's looking for the heart of man to make his abode and so God has a provided way and that's by the blood and so when we consider that we just really rejoice and with that's what we want to point to is you know I want to personalize the Commission if I haven't received the blood and been able to come back into the garden and have that garden condition where my fellowship with God is unbroken and my my position as a son or you as a dog hasn't been restored yet then I say come to the fountain because the the blood of Jesus cleanses you from all sin and he restores your soul he'll bring that refreshing and then from that point now we can point others and say there's an open door there's a gate the the Bible says Strait is the gate and narrow is the way and that word actually is is not like crooked or versus straight that that word actually is is a water channel and so the Gospels were speaking in the Great Commission he says go into all the world and baptize them in the name of the Father Son and the Holy Ghost well that waterway was in the name of Jesus Christ that was the provided way to repent and be filled with his spirit and so then now we can share that with others say I've parked took of the Tree of Life because God has protected it throughout all the generations till now this is a real living Savior not only is he a savior but he's a healer he's a redeemer he's Almighty God he'll never be defeated a ma'am well we just was so grateful that he said that blessed are you when you hunger and thirst you shall be filled and and the thing is is he knew that you know he would give up his life and he realized that the spirit that was in him when the when the veil was torn and he gave up that Ghost now he made a way for us to come and receive his very spirit and you know the Bible says that you shall be filled and you shall be filled with his spirit that is the promise and what does his spirit do his spirit leads us and guides us into the revealed Word of the hour and that word has the power to transform us and it has the ability to transform our speech it has the power to transform our conduct it has the power to cause you to have a new job it has the power to keep the cupboards full of food it has the power to sustain you in a time of trouble amen and the resume of the church ages brother branham speaks about he says that now this may seem far-fetched to some but actually the very plain for all to see because right now the churches are controlling politics and at the opportune time will manifest exactly how great that control is how great is that control this eka medical move will end up with Rome at the head even through even though the people did not envision it that way it is because in Revelations 17 3 through 6 it states that the horror Mystery Babylon is seated on the Beast and she is controlling the last and fourth Empire this Rome Roman Church is doing that with the world council systems under her rome will be controlling and this image church system will be obedient to Rome because Rome controls the gold of the world thus all the people have to belong to the world church system or be at the mercy of the elements for they cannot buy or sell without the mark of the beast in the hand or the head and this mark in the hand in the head means that they will take the doctrine of the world church system which is trinitarianism etc and the mark in the hand is what means to do the will of the the world church and with the great power that the church system will persecute the true by true bride this image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching etc her ministry will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it for before the Antichrist in person takes over the complete system of churches the true church will be taken away from this world and be with the Lord God will catch his bride away to the marriage supper of the lamb you know I just say we recognize that the the prophet of God taught us that but let's take this time and refocus and personalize the Commission because there is names on the Lamb's Book of Life that God is saying it's from faith to faith it's each one of us in our daily lives the enemy may have tried to come and disrupt things because he doesn't like God to receive worship and praise he wants praise and worship he has everybody to where they're just at home taking in all of his lies and and taking partaking of the tree of knowledge through entertainment and different things but there's a people that are not satisfied with the things of the world and they recognize there's a deep cry in the heart Lord finish the work that you started in your body in your bride and let me play my part let me be faithful not to be caught up with the intoxications of Laodicea and the things that are happening right now though it's very intense to them but for us we don't dread and fear it because our God is with us who is greater than our God there is none like our God I just think that it's it's it's so wonderful you know I I just took a look in the scripture and in Exodus 25 and you know what I didn't mean to take very long and just maybe ask the musicians to come I just wanted to encourage you to you know it's it's so important to stay focused in these times that the enemy tries to throw all of these distractions we're not ignorant we know what's going to happen our prophet taught us and the Spirit of God confirmed that we're only here for a short season and so when we consider that we just rejoice and in in Exodus 20:5 in verse 1 it says and the Lord spoke unto Moses saying speaking the children of Israel that they bring me an offering of every man that gives that willing willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering you know and that's that's just you know God's a perfect gentleman you know he makes the call and and he wants us to identify with his word and so I feel like if we can personalize the call saying I'm not ashamed to be identified with a god that can supernaturally undertake for a job oh I will testify now to those who need a job because I heard tonight that God was faithful when the believers went to their knees they went to their God and God undertook for the believers and so I want to say you know it's it's with the willing heart that I say God let me take the Word of God according to what you said this entire message and it's not oh don't smoke don't drink don't do drugs don't run oh it's come there's an open gate to the Tree of Life come and take the words of life into your heart and watch it produce what he said it would it'll bring the hearts crying it'll satisfy all of your longings in verse 16 it says and thou shalt put the Ark of testimony which I give thee and thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold deity two cubits and a half shall be the link thereof into in a cubit and a half the breadth thereof and thou shalt make two cherubims of gold of beaten work shalt thou make them and the two ends of the mercy mercy seat and make one cherubim on the one end and the other cherubim on the other end even above the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the ends thereof and I just feel will be closing here in just a minute and why don't we stand I just wanted to encourage your Saints you know there's there's times that are one of these days time will be no more the this thing will wrap up and and the things that we hold dear today we want to make sure that they have an eternal value and the Bible says this in Isaiah 55 it says lo everyone that thirst is come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come ye and buy and eat yay come yay come and buy wine and milk without money and without price wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your Labor's they II that which satisfying not hearken unto me and eat ye that which is good let your soul delight itself in fatness and incline your ear and come unto me and hear and your soul shall live and I will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of David a man I believe that God has some testimonies I believe God has some witnesses let's go let's personalize the Commission let's let the Word of God no let the world know that the Word of God has taken place in the altars of our heart that there is a refuge there's a place even if they are poor and they don't have money but there's a long I now want to go on a search where those who are unsatisfied where are those that maybe don't have money to buy but as freely as you've been given freely give Amen Lord bless you richly let's pray together precious heavenly father Lord God just a little thought on my heart Lord that the the gate the door is opening Lord and and there's been a blood that's on the mercy seat and this these these two prophet messengers one at the beginning and one at the end Lord they they both spoke the same thing Lord brother branham said I preached what Paul preached Oh God let this bleeding bloody word cover us Lord and let it be on the altar of our heart that others when we point to the Tree of Life Lord that they can those who are unsatisfied can find a place of satisfaction and rest oh god help us to trim our lamps Lord God would just commit this little claw to you desiring your richest blessings on the people Lord we just desire Oh God that

the time and the unfolding of events and everything and Lord all we saw 10 for Lord we're so thankful that we can see and we know we cannot be deceived because the church lies within us Lord and and
