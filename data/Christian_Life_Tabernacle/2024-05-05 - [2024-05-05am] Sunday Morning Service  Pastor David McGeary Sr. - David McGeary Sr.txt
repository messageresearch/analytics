your word in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles let's open up to the gospel of uh St John and the 15th chapter and let us read uh um starting in the seventh verse now I'm not supposed to be here this morning but I'm not always a good boy so I I I'm going to go see my mother and uh uh this for Mother's Day and I won't be here next weekend so um and then uh cosman's preaching for us tonight um but um did want to fellowship with you today and something that's on my heart so we just trust the Lord will bless you um we've made a few things where there's still a lot of adjustments that we're making and and a lot of unknowns about the building and about the people so um uh as we go along we'll develop policies and rules and different things and try to get them to you one at a time but we did open up the uh a fellowship hall over here so after service uh uh after service there's um uh you can go over there and fellowship uh the grass now you if the kids want to play on the grass that's up to your parents if you want grass stains uh your kids are welcome to go out and get grass stains it's probably wet today because of the rain but uh we'll have that open uh this is open over here uh I call it uh the youth youth development center and uh someone said why are you calling it the youth what happened to Sunday school I said you don't want to use the word school with the city because schools have a whole different set of rules you know what you have to have and what you got to do and all this stuff so uh we're just a Youth Development Center so uh anyway we we hope in the next couple months to be all totally finished up and when we get everything finished up then we'll try to set our eyes on a dedication service you love the Lord this morning well if you think you love him he loves you more amen you can't even begin to measure the love that God has for you he he certainly loves you let's read these scriptures um and it says if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples so we always talk a lot about glorifying God in praising God but he's not glorified by your beautiful voices you know the Mormon Tabernacle Choir would have us all be or the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir but it's that you're fruitful that's what glorifies the father that you bear much fruit um and so he says uh and and but if you bear much fruit he says so shall ye be my disciples as the father hath loved me so have I loved you continue ye in my love if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love these things have I spoke unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full this is my commandment that ye love one another as I have loved you greater love hath no man that a man lay down his life or his friend and ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord does but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your words in jesus' name we pray amen and you maybe SE all right okay um and then he finishes up these things I command you that you love one another and it uh that's a great statement that I have not uh you have not chosen me I've chosen you you know Christianity many times uh always takes the approach that you have to make the decision to serve God it's based on your decision uh a whole faith is based on that from the standpoint that you've got to recognize yourself a sinner and then when you recognize yourself as sinner you have to choose the Lord Jesus to come into your life and therefore uh you made the choice and that a choice is attrib you to righteousness and and that's a a a a good thing I mean that's a motivating factor but uh we know it goes beyond that uh we know that uh we didn't choose him he chose us and he foreordained us unto good works that we might be fruitful and so I had a little thought this morning and I'm I like I said I'm going to try to uh uh keep it uh simple and uh um uh not put too much effort into it if I can do that you know uh I I'm not supposed to work and so I told everybody I didn't work I I didn't lift anything I just told this person to do that and that person to do that and I pushed her broom a little bit but I I tried to be good but my eyes doing good the doctor said it's good I got 2020 Vision back in my eye uh but it's a little sore um he stuck like I told you he stuck three needles in my eye and uh he told me is when it heals it'll get better so I'm thankful for the hand of the Lord on the surgery so when I look at this scripture um it motivates me uh not only me personally but it motivates my heart towards you as Believers and as Believers uh we've got to realize that God is expecting Our Lives to be fruitful he's expecting there to be results uh he doesn't plant the seed not believing if I could use that term that that seed has a purpose and it has a fruit you wouldn't go plant a garden and someone come up to you and said oh I noticed you tilled the soil and you got the rocks out and you put a fence up to keep the rabbits and you planted a nice Garden uh what what what are you growing oh nothing I just planted a bunch of seed that's unfruitful you know I mean I don't expect I don't expect any of these seeds to work well that's not a whole lot of doesn't give you a lot of expectation you're not going to put much effort into that Garden are you going to be out there weeding it every day and tilling it every day watering it every day and and and just sit back and say you know uh uh I I I planted this garden and I did all this work but I have no expectations whatsoever for this Garden well lesle and I we moved from California as you know to Montana and U so we got in Montana so we thought we'd plant a garden so we got the ground and we dug it up and we worked it and we got all the seeds and everything and planted it and put all this effort in it and I I just remember the neighbor would come over and he'd look over the fence and and he'd just chuckle and we couldn't figure out what what he's chuckling about you know I mean we didn't see a lot of gardens around up there but you know we we were hippies you know we were moving to Montana and going to take the Wilderness and can some things and so so we we put a lot of effort in this garden and then when it come time to uh uh dig up our garden you know well we got some carrots but our carrots were like this big like they were like mini carrots and then we got radishes and they're about the size of a marble you know and our potatoes were about the size of a golf ball and we looked at this and said we worked all summer long and we didn't have enough vegetables and fruit for a salad you know what I mean and because the condition weren't right you know what I mean but we had a lot of expectation you you know what I'm saying and but when God plants a garden hallu amen he he's already has the vision of what it's going to be I I feel our problem is is we haven't joined his vision we haven't joined his vision and we've been speaking on the message called taking sides with Jesus and you know when you take sides with something it it's it goes beyond acknowledgment it goes beyond where you say I acknowledge this truth we're in uh in our country we're in election season and so they are trying to get people to cast their Vote or to take sides and so what they do is they they they speak out what they stand for uh this is what I'm going to do for you and this is what we're going to do and and this is our policy um you know we're going to clean up the air and and uh and so you can breathe or we're going to clean up the water so you can drink we're going to take care of you forever uh and and they'll give you all these promises the other candidate or whoever it might be might promise you I'm going to make your wages grow and and your you're going to be successful and and uh you're going to have this and that and you sit there all the time listening listening listening but there comes a time when you have to take a side okay and and Jesus said there's something about this age that's extremely important to us and and that you he says if you I if you're not hot or cold you know if you're lukewarm I'll spew thee out of my mouth and this is the age of being lukewarm okay it's it's subtly around us it's a age of being lukewarm it it's an age of people trying to thread the needle and and not offend this side or that side you know try to be correct and and it it makes for no decisions uh people are wanting to know I want to make make sure that I take the the the side with the winner or I want to take the right side uh they're being forced into choices and and uh and people are doing everything they can to force you to make a choice to force you to make a stand and because it's a time that you've got to take sides you can't remain lukewarm you you're either one or the other and it before the the lines used to be closer together so if you made one choice or the other you weren't so far apart but now they're trying to create the distance so that the it the choices are are are very far apart and that your choice will identify you and your choice will eventually produce the actions that you you have the things that you do are based on your choice and and we want to make our choice the word that's what our heart's desire is and that's what Jesus says but I think it goes beyond that when we realize that that he has we have not chosen him that he chose us and it's very difficult uh I think Paul is such a great example of that Paul's persecuting the church and that's not what God chose him to do and one day he meets the pillar of fire on out on his campaign and uh all of a sudden he smoked blind and God got his attention and if you're running from God God will get your attention amen if he's chosen you he will find you amen if if he wants you you can't you can't escape it that's right he will he will squeeze down on you until he stops you dead in your track and and and speaks to him at this morning I wanted just share with you because I think it's important for us and I made this little note of this uh sermon title I don't always title my sermon but and I I want to call this revelation of self revelation of self we have a lot of knowledge and a lot of Revelations of a lot of things but I wonder if we really have a revelation of ourself and you know to have a revelation is is to know Revelation is another word for faith I could I if I could also maybe say do we have faith in ourself now I know we're always taught oh you can't have faith in yourself you can't have faith in yourself but that was the church World telling us that so they could have control over you there should be nothing that has control over your life other than the quickening power power of the spirit of God revealing to you his word you shouldn't be you shouldn't be ruled by fear you shouldn't be ruled by doubt in fact your life should be ruled by love that should be the the ultimate uh reflection that he sees and it if you are full of complexes and you're full of doubt in yourself it's very difficult really to love somebody you know you there's you've got to have some form of confidence in yourself in order to really love somebody you've got to be sure sure of your own feelings you you wouldn't want to enter into a relationship doubting whether or not you love that person you couldn't go outside and come up with reasons uh for marriage uh well I need a place to stay and I need a job and he's a provider and and he works hard and I I don't really know if I love him but uh everybody else is uglier than he is so I I'm I'm going to I I I'll just settle on this well I mean how long do you think that lasts you know I mean you might make it through but you you'll have no joy you'll have no fruit you'll have you'll have no peace you'll in hard times they just become harder you know and you can't explain to somebody why you love somebody you know what I mean it's just something inside of you that you love them uh uh the prophet of God made that statement I use it many time in weddings it says when you love them and you don't know why you know it's not because of their looks it's not but that you love them and she loves you he says that came down from heaven that's Eternal and and that'll that'll go back to heaven and so there's certain things that you've got to be sure of in order to be successful you've got to you've got to be positively sure if and and uh we always try to get our young people to uh make sure that they they have the spirit of God that they're born again you know what I mean that their lives are cleaned up you know what I mean you don't want to marry somebody and have a secret life you know what I mean or or have alternative reasons you want to just get to the place I can be 100% honest with this person I love this person I want to be with this person when I wake up I think about him uh uh you know because if you get married you're going to wake up with that person me and let been waking up for 50 some years you know perfect marriage well I read that thing and it to me it felt like those two people were foreigners one to another you know what I mean they K says well you know the guys he's got these things that he does and she's got these things that she does and I thought all this book is is these are ways for two strangers to live together I I don't you know what I mean that's not what I'm looking for in life and I think sometimes we've estranged ourselves okay that we're to the very God that loves us come on because we're not confident in ourselves we don't have a self Revelation a revelation of self we know all that he is but I don't even know if sometimes we know who it is that he loves and so I want to just just read to you a little bit this morning and just spend uh just a few moments that we could come to a greater revelation of of who that we are or who that I am and what my place is and what my part is in things and and it it comes with the word of God and the best way that anybody can really ever be identified is by the word of God the word of God is the true identifier of all things it's what identifies every aspect of your life is measured by the word of God it's not measured by how much money you have I mean you could have all the money in the world but God comes to the poor of this world rich in faith because everything a dollar can accomplish a faith can accomplish it faster Faith can do for you anything a dollar can do for you faith can do for you anything a doctor can do for you faith can do all things with faith all things are possible I can do all things through Christ Jesus who strengthens me so if I could have that relationship I have all things but I need if I and I want to know that I have that relationship and I want to know it's not one-sided how many people could say well I love this person but I'm not sure whether they love me well that that becomes a real tiptoe situation but we want to be steadfast andure that he loves us and we love him I know and I I love this scripture so much it's always been uh something that really meant a whole lot to me it's that when the Lord's talking to Peter Peter does not love me and and it just strikes Peter and he asked him the second time Peter does that love me you know feed my sheep feed my lambs and finally Peter says Lord you know all things you know that I love you and they just he just ended the question he knew he loved him Peter knew he loved him and he could he could finally looked at and say you know that I love you you know all things you know that I love you wouldn't it be wonderful if you could answer back to yourself and you can say Lord I know I love you and I know you love me I know you love me I'm sure that you love me it it's settled yes it's settled within my heart yeah that you love me then you can start coming to the the the revelation of self I'm somebody that he loves I'm somebody that he chose he chose me I can just see see at the at the vow and the minister standing there and and and he says he says now that do you take this uh this uh man to be your lawfully wet husband he says well it wasn't my first choice but he already got married so um I I think this will do oh my my my my my you know that that would be uh pretty good about that time he'd reach in his pocket and say well I had two rings here one was a Big Stone if she really loved me and this is a teeny Stone just in case this thing's not going to last you can't go on like that you can't go on wondering whether something is going to last or not when you say those words I do that means I do till death of the part you understand for for better for worse they're thicker they thin you know for in and out it don't matter this is a settled thing I'm settled in my decision I'm settled in my choice I've accepted the fact that that this isn't a trial run you know okay I I believe with all my heart that that that he loves me and I I believe that he loves me and I believe that he knows that I love him because without that the there's nothing left but suspicion and then you misread every word you misread every action everything that's done it starts to get interpreted this way and interpreted that way confusion enters in and pretty soon words start spewing out of your mouth and it's one great big gigantic ugly mess but when but when it's settled it's settled amen you know you're going to get through it that's right you can say I'm sorry I didn't mean that you know it's not dear I'm really sorry I I I didn't mean to hurt you well if you're sorry go buy me a new car that don't work that don't work man you couldn't buy enough cars you know I mean no it's there's got to be a confidence there there's got to be a union there there's got to be a a love there and Jesus that's what he prayed for he says father may they love you and and love me and may they know your love wherein you have loved me may they have this Union together in love father me they know that Jesus says here I would that they love one another if you're my disciples love one another have confidence in one another well if you're not sure of yourself if you don't have a revelation of yourself then you don't even know what you're loving with I mean if you're if you're totally got a a personality of faith and a personality of doubt and you don't know which guy showing up you don't know which which guy is going to come through the door or which person's going to wake up you know you wake up say good morning who are you who are you today who am I getting today you can't live like that you can't go forward like that you can't Advance like that you can stay in the same spot spending your tires year after year after year but but you never you never can go nowhere you know I want to grow old on the rocking chair you know I want to sit there and and have lesie stand behind me rock in the chair are you okay dear oh yeah how are you good do you want some tea yeah you know an hour and a half later she gets back with the tea here's your your tea and and oh thank you there it might be cold it might be too strong but but boy you're just so happy thank you dear Hallelujah love this tea you know and you know you're half done with it and she wants to know if you want another cup you know oh don't worry sweetie I'll get up and get it you know and how I go and I come back a half hour later what was it that I was supposed to to get that all starts because the foundation is right and if you want to grow old in the Lord if you want your relationship to grow strong then I'm telling you you've got to know what part you're playing You've Got To Know Your Role you've got to have a self revelation of yourself and if you would allow me I'm you know I'm not a very good reader but I I I want to read some things to you this morning uh and that uh it might if I maybe lead us to what the point is that I want you to end up with this morning I want you to walk out this door this morning knowing beyond the shadow of a doubt I may be a mess but he loves me and I love him and I didn't choose him he chose me he had a reason that he chose me this is out of the message called taking sides with Jesus and he's talking here he said and this is in paragraph 24 of taking sides uh with Jesus he said when old Nathan walked up there maybe before Phillip said he said now I don't know about this Phillip I've seen a lot of things rise up in these last days I know there's a lot of things going on so here comes Philip up and they're talking he says man are you sure this is just one more of them things right he says but he walked up before him and said I'll go listen to him and see what's got to say walked up there and Jesus said behold an Israelite in whom there's no guile and he said Rabbi when did you know me he he said before Philip called you when you was under the tree I saw you what did it he said the water struck that predestinated seed oh my when it did he said Rabbi Thou Art the Son of God you're the king of Israel what was it the seed was laying there already now this morning I I I want you to realize I'm talking about you and a self-revelation I want you to be able to say the seed was laying there already God seed it back Yonder before the foundation of the world that it should bring forth the light right at that time hallelujah oh I like that that's my stand right there brother that's where I believe right there I preach it and it falls here and there and they go this way in that way don't make any difference somewhere it's going to strike a seed and when it did that's brother Bram staps his finger it'll fly right up to life like that just as sure as the world yes sir like that blind boy said this was done that the works of God might be manifest see see he knowed what was going to take place sure he did all right now the predestinated when they see his scriptural signs know that the word Vindicated The Works that the works Vindicated the word that the word was right they were predestinated to see it and they were right in line to see it and they got it now as I read this batch of quotes I hope your confidence goes out and says that's me remember the little boy in the country in the mirror when he went into from the country into to see his aunt or someone in the city and he walked walked down the hall and he saw a little boy and he walked up closer to the boy and the boy was there and and he' never seen A Mir he raised his hand the boy raised his hand he put his leg out the boy put his leg out and as he was looking into this mirror he saw that what he was doing everything was exactly right in tune and so finally he made the statement he says look Mommy it's me well when we look this morning into the Yum Thunder of God's word what is the word of God the word of God is the mirror of the believer that's right they look into the they look into the mirror and they should be able to see themselves they should be able to look into that mirror and say look that's me and when you read this oh when the word is struck struck something in me and something in me came in me and flew up to life I want to have a revelation of myself and say that's me that's me I that's me you're talking about me this is I see [Music] myself I have a revelation of who I am it's not a standalone fact I mean it's not the fact of predestination that God predestines it's not the theory of predestination that God plans things no that's not the kind of God I serve I serve a God that makes his word come to pass in flesh that's me that's right that's the revelation of myself that's my self-revelation who's he talking about this is me he's talking about me yes sir I saw the works I heard the word something came alive in me but if you don't have confidence in that then you become a double-minded person and a double-minded person is unstable than all their ways you can't you can't you got to make a stand that's right what the devil says you are on or what God says you are this is what he said so I want to be able to read that and not say well this is Brother Ram's teaching or this is the message we're all elected I don't matter if you're you're all elected right good for you but your election is not going to do anything for me the only thing that said do anything for me is when I know he's talking about me then I can walk up there and say that's mine it's not a question that belongs to me amen that is the revelation of self this is the revelation of self this is the revelation of me I am a predestinated seed not a question I have a revelation of myself because until that's established every promise that you come to you try to measure your worth before you take possession but when you know it's your inheritance and you know it come comes to you then you know you can receive it that's why I love the story of the prodal son the one son we know the story he decides he wants to go out and see the world he takes everything he has and he takes it he squanders it he lives great he's got a lot of friends well he's got money but the minute he became a burden nobody wanted to pull him along no friends you know nobody there to move you no one to help you can you imagine when he had to move out of one place to another you know starting his slides starting to stuff pretty soon nobody was showing up to move him nobody wanted jobs he didn't have nothing to offer you know F finally slopping pigs you know now he's eating what the pigs eat so he's out there fighting with the pig you know Pig's got the corn husk in one mouth and he's got his mouth on the other end and they're fighting so finally he recognizes something I have a father I'm his son now I'm not worthy to be that son but I'm still that son I'm going to go back and ask him if he'll forgive me and let me be a servant in his house I'm willing to humble myself to that of course when he got back he had a feast waiting for him the father been praying for him and looking for his return because that's his son you think the father cared about what inheritance he gave him the father made that inheritance 10 times over since that boy had been gone he could start his inheritance fresh from that day he had cattle he had everything and and he the other son finally comes up and says Oh Daddy you know I've been faithful to you I've been good and you've never done this he said Son Rejoice your brother which was lost is returned and then he looks at and he says you know all things that are mine are yours that's right he lacked the revelation of his he lacked the revelation of his position and because he lacked that Revelation he felt threatened by his brother let me tell you once you're born again and you know that the Seal of God's in your heart you don't afraid of anybody huah their Doctrine can't take it away from you Their Fear techniques can't take it away from you their criticism can't take it away from you you know you're born of the spirit of God you know the father loves you you know you didn't choose him he chose you it's settled a long time ago our Prophet told us we don't want to get to the river and not have the token and that's what he said he said you've always been with me you've always had everything I have is yours but he never got the revelation of self he never understood his security he never understood his position in the family jealousy rise up criticisms rise up all those things are all a result when a person doesn't have self Revelation they he said now when the predestinate when they see his scriptural sign knowing that the works been indicate the word that the word was right they were predestinated to see it and they were right in line to see it and they got it because the people was predestinated to eternal life they was going to find it that's all all the father hath given me will come to me and all that comes to me I will give eternal life and raise him up at the last days there will not be one of them lost amen I'm holding right to that what are you holding to I didn't choose him he chose me when he got that hippie off the roof I knew I didn't choose God I didn't want anything to do with God God but God wanted to do something with me not by works not by Deeds not by power not by might but by my spirit saith God not what I done what I am or what I will be but what he is and I am in him and whatever he is I'm a part of him amen I'm saved because I'm a part of him he is God and I'm a part of him being his son that's right so ain't what I done what I will do it's what he's done that's my trust right there all [Music] right it settles it now when you hear that don't I I hope I I can make myself clear it's not sitting back and saying that's a Doctrine it's not a Doctrine it's a description of a people yes it's a description of an offspring it's a description of a family it's a genial tree of God the extended down into this age you know those trees they make put my name in there you know David be got such a and such begot Son by son begot David McGary go read your Bible it's right in there you all skip over that part don't you you don't sit there and read all those names but if you read all those names you'll find I'm in there amen sure I am I'm a part of every single one of them so we're talking about getting a revelation of self how important is that if I could read a a few places to you and this is out of perfect Faith how how many wants to advance into rapturing condition don't you feel the squeeze yes don't you feel the chaos don't you feel the people are losing their mind you don't know what to think you don't know what's going to happen can you imagine they want to run our whole country on batteries how many of you have had success with batteries all mine turn ugly and gray and they sit in the closet and every time I need one I can't find it so I think I need batteries so I go to the store and I buy batteries and when I get home I think well where do I keep the batteries and I look for my battery and there's a whole bunch of batteries anybody need any batteries call lesle I'm not going to live on batteries well we don't even live on bread alone we live on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God if you are not feeding yourself right come on you've got to feed yourself you've got to have a revelation of self you got to know who it is that you're feeding what it is that you're eating I can't just read what I read if if if I don't feel it's for me then I'm reading a menu but that's not what John said he said take the book and eat it that's right I'm going to eat that I'm going to take side with it I'm going to say if he said it he's talking about me and I'm going to act accordingly cuz he said oh if you love me you keep my Commandments and other words my Commandments are the things that I speak if I tell you you're predestinated and you love me you believe me and you stand up and you say I'm predestinated that's right and somebody says show me well let's go down to the bar and have a few beers don't matter your actions speak louder in your words you know that you just that's a makeb believe thing but you're going to have makeb believers they going to have unbelievers it don't matter the matter is if you have a revelation of yourself you say I am a believer and I know it I've settled that in my heart this is imperfect Faith now remember they had the word he's talking about his disciples and you know the story they had the a boy I believe maybe had leprosy and they couldn't move the spirit the devil and and Jesus was speaking to him and so it finally comes down to this he says now remember they had the word and the Word was flesh then and the word told them I give you power right I give you power and they had the power but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in them so there's a disconnect there he gave them the power but somewhere along the line they lost confidence in themselves maybe I don't have the power maybe he didn't give it to me and then even later on when they finally got back in a different circumstance he said oh we saw Satan falling he says don't rejoice in that Rejoice because your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life another if I could say it this way rejoice in the self Revelation this morning wouldn't it be wonderful if every single one of us beyond a shadow of a doubt could stand here this morning and say I have a revelation that my name name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life and you're not trying to prove it to yourself all the time cuz the minute you try to prove it to yourself by your good works Satan comes along and trips you up and then you're caught in the balance who forget it why am I is my name written in the Lamb's Book of Life because he said so and I have a revelation a self Revelation that was me it's me yes it is he said but they had power but they didn't have the faith to operate the word that was in them see what I mean but Jesus had it he was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen he said oh bring him here how long will I suffer you he had Faith with his power how did he he said I can do nothing in myself why he relied on what he was now if Jesus had to rely on what he was how are you going to be a Christian if you can't rely on what you are and you can't rely on what you are if you don't know what you are if you don't have a revelation of yourself he said and I can do nothing in myself why he relied on what he was he relied in knowing that he was the word and he had faith in God who made him the word he was God's word and they was in him and they gave him Faith because he understood his position he had a self-revelation I was born in this world for this cause he went and sat down with the guys in the room that and he went over the scriptures and you know what he did every time he saw those scriptures he said that's me that's me that's me I went to Egypt I came out of Nazareth I was born in the House of David I was born in Bethlehem can you imagine him sitting there and seeing himself in the scripture what did he have he had a self-revelation he had a revelation of who he was Jesus Jesus operated by faith amen he operated by Revelation no wonder the world wants to make him a trinity if you make him God then he didn't need nothing but when you realize he learned obedience by the things he suffered he he he he he had Faith he was tempted in every way that we were tempted but yet he sinned not and he had it because it was a revelation of himself that's what his perfect Faith was you can have the same thing you can have the same confidence he recognized his position he understood his position he knowed what he was because the scriptures had said he was this he knowed what he was because the scriptures said he was this you know you're predestinated because the prophet said you were the word the opening of the seals who you are he know what he was because the scriptures had said he was this and here every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scriptures said he would be and he knew what he was I'm going to I just want to catch this I want us to understand that he's not asking us to have something that he hasn't already shown us when you when you make Jesus a third person he was just God that came out of heaven and he came down here and and he was God he didn't suffer he didn't do anything you missed the whole story you missed the whole story of kinsman redeemer you miss the whole story of the love affair you miss the whole story of him wanting to bring you back he put in front of you the Son and the daughter that you are the love of God is manifested in this as he is so are we in this world am look finish here he says therefore he relied upon what God had made him and if he did that then can't we rely upon what God made us as Believers now what are you relying on it's not just relying on the word alone everybody reads the Bible the the your position is not a reader your position is a Believer and you say well what do I have to believe with the only thing you have to believe with is what he made you to believe with he made you a Believer he said faith in what you are you're a Believer and if you got faith in God the Bible says over here if our hearts condemn us then we can't have faith but if our hearts condemn us uh if our then we can't Fai but if our hearts don't condemn us then we can have faith but if our hearts don't condemn us then we have faith we have confidence towards God if you want to read that St John 3:21 I've got it wrote down he says and then he makes this statement I think it's beauti is the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are Jesus Jesus had faith in the word of God that said he was it is written of me you have to have faith in what you are so you're going to have to have faith in what the scriptures say you are you're going to have to have faith in what the word of God says you are you you got to have faith in what you are so how do you have faith in what you are you've got to have a re revelation of self so when you when we can come to the place he says I I have a revelation and an understanding that I am the predestinated seed of God I was put here on this Earth for a purpose and he says see if I have this marked here it's a beautiful statement he says now what he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it'll be done then recognize your position in the scriptures as a Believer you've got to recognize your position as he recognized his position do you have a revelation of your position Let Me Maybe close up by talking a little bit about our position because we want to go forward amen if the sick comes amongst us we want to know that we've been commissioned by God to lay our hands on the sick and they will recover if they come asking you can respond and know this is my position I've been placed here by God to respond to this circumstance this person has come and ask they've come to me because I'm an ambassador not me personally but us as a body and that's our position is to lay hands on the sick and they recover if it if the word doesn't become flesh then it's theology if the word always remains on the outside it's a covering and that's what religion is is a covering but when the believer takes the word and that word now becomes a description of themselves and they can say I am the word I am a part of the word how many times that our messenger tell us you are the word you're a part of the word you're part of him you're the word made flesh because he wants somebody to get a revelation of themselves and say that's me amen maybe even take it to the place and say that's mine that's my promise by these exceedingly great and precious promises we are partakers of divine nature how do you partake of divine nature to be a partaker of divine nature means the divine nature now becomes your nature through that promise not a bite in a nibble this ain't a smage for this is eat the whole thing every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line not only is it something I believe it's something that I am I am the believer in this age I am the chosen elected predestinated bride seed that was to be here in this hour who is it it's me it's me I've come to a revelation well you were scoundrel yes praise God for the blood I didn't choose him he chose me if he wants to make me part of the Bride he'll make me ready he'll mold me he'll make me he'll fix me he'll make me be exactly what I need to be I don't have to worry about it I don't even have to prove to him I have nothing to prove he said well what are you relying on what he said when he said my name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life I believe it when he said nothing can put it on or nothing can take it off I believe it remains yes I didn't send it off I can't erase it but I'll tell you one thing he'll do if I keep taking advantage of it he'll work me over and he'll put me in a wheelchair somewhere well you but he he'll get his just reward but he won't lose a one he won't lose a one you don't have to worry about being lost you're eternally secure you say what happens if I don't do this and don't do that people are always worried about the evidence of what the whether I've got the Holy Spirit or not you know what the evidence of the holy spirit is you believe every word of God got a whole religion that doesn't believe anybody has the Holy Spirit until they speak in tongues well all kinds of people speak in tongues heathens speak in tongues so now they have to come up with phase two and phase two is whatever shape you're in when you die is how you're going to meet God well if I had the choice of when I was gonna die I would make sure that on that particular day I was in good standing no I like being eternally secure I like the Revelation that my name was on the Lamb's Book of Life I like that it can't be taken off am well if I believe that then it'll bring forth fruit yes that proves that the proof is in the fruit that's what you know them by you know the apple trees and apple tree by what it's fruit it's evidence now people preach the evidence is prosperity isn't it funny the evidence of Christianity is now the thing that makes it harder to get through the eye of the needle it's harder to get into heaven with riches and everybody wants to be rich the description of the church is not it'll be successful businessmen it's those that are poor in this world rich in faith don't don't you want to rely on that what a comfort what a comfort I've never seen my beg bread what a comfort I believe it Lord I believe that's me I have a revelation of myself in the scriptures let's close in reading this this morning self-revelation I am a believer notice it was by his Believers that he proves his word by he can only prove his word not by unbelievers it's only by the Believers that he can prove his word no matter how much the rest of them claim to be oh I believe brother if you do God will prove it so because we look and see the others how can we say then see it's by the True Believer that he proves his word not by those who say they believe but by those who really believe it's by his believing children that he proves his word self-revelation I'm a believing child what's my position to prove his word I a believing child that's what he made me that's what he predestined ated me that's what he put me here to be that's who I am what are you I'm a believing child what are you doing here I'm here to prove his word I have a revelation of my existence I have a revelation of my position I'm not in the Run Race trying to get there I'm not trying to get enough works to tilt the scale in my favor I've got a revelation beyond that I've got a self-revelation that if I ever had eternal life I've always had eternal life I always had eternal life in me I always was the word I always was a part of him him it's not something I came to that I chose no matter the obstacles that Satan put in my path God got me to where that I am because of what I am it was all pre-planned why can't we accept it why is it so hard that we got to keep looking at this flesh that has no good thing in it that was born in sin and shaped in iniquity in fact this flesh isn't even going I got a new one waiting for me the one I would have always had if I didn't drop down in this little space of time so that God could manifest his attributes I'm not caught up in the religious struggle I'm not caught up in worrying about things there's only one thing I want to settle in my heart is I want to have a self Revelation that I am that elect seed and I know it by divine revelation I see myself in the scriptures that have been spoken I see myself in the message when he says if you have eternal life you always had eternal life that's me I'm sorry I know I got a rough personality I know I'm hard on the edges I I know I'm hard to work for I I know I'm a slave driver I know all those things but I'm sorry he chose me and I'm going to be there and either he's going to fix you or he's going to fix me but we're all going to get along on the other [Applause] side I'm not relying on this I'm relying on what he said and he said he said he predestinated me he said he opened my eyes to see it he said when the word struck the seed it brought it to life he said he said he said and who was he talking about me me me no wonder he can say I am the father are one that's right and we can say I am the father are one it was his plan in the beginning to put us here Satan got nothing going on Satan's world is toast there ain't nothing going on the only thing that's going on is what God God's got going on and what God's got going on is giving the self-revelation to his Believers so they can stand up and take sides with Jesus the word of God and say that's me here I am didn't make myself didn't save myself didn't earn it well you sure got a lot of things wrong with you good unbelief doesn't stop God unbelief doesn't stop God I know the messenger said this he said you save yourself and God a lot of trouble if you'd sit down and solve the issue of self-revelation that you will take the position that he's given you as Believers let's read this in Clos in now if I want you to notice he does that way in every age he does it every time by the same method he has to take Believers and in order to have Believers to meet that word now remember my point this morning I want you to stand up and say that's me yes I'm that person he's talking about me we want to end the wishy-washy what are you believing I'm certainly don't believe myself but I can believe what he said that's what every believer's got to finally anchor in he said it why am I elected because he said I was I believe what he said he's talking about somebody right why not make it you I mean do you love the world and the things of the world is there something out there that's more attractive to you than eternal life back in the beautiful garden back loving and living the way that you were created to live I'm sorry there'll be no Porsches there there'll be no Corvettes there there'll be no speeding tickets there there'll be no car wrecks there people say I'm going to get a mansion well I surely don't want a house it's not the Mansion I'm looking for I'm looking for that body that house that he dwells in that's right just think about it there's nothing here church so why don't we take our Eternal position now why don't we take our Eternal description of who we are from God why don't we come to that place where we can say I am what he says I am Satan don't believe he's never going to give you credit his whole journey is to prove that you're a liar he might prove me to be be a liar but he'll never prove him to be a liar cuz his words will never fail he does it by the same method he has to take Believers then in order to have Believers to meet that word he's got to predestinate it to that age you see it he's got to predestinate this thing to be there to meet the challenge of the age did you get it did you feel it did you see it did you understand it what a series of questions when he just described why you're here the whole reason you're here now your parents might have said you were a mistake but you weren't a mistake to God God put you here that's you are not here by your own choosing that's fact he he went way way back Generations back grandfathers great grandfathers bringing that all those down together for you to be here this morning not somebody else you I don't care how old you are I don't care if you're in fifth grade sixth grade teenager or whatever here you're here because God put you here and he put you here to fulfill something yes sir cuz he still runs the show now he says in order for God to prove his word he has a predestinate a Believer to be here do you see it what's he saying do you have self-revelation do you feel it do you have self-revelation do you understand it do you have self-revelation do you this morning have a revelation of yourself that I am the predestinated word spoken seed of God made flesh I come from God I go to God I don't care what you see in the mirror do you believe what he said because when you get the self-revelation that empowers you to possess the Gate of your enemy it empowers you to drive him out of your life it empowers you to put down the lust and the sin and the bitterness cuz Jesus relied on who he was for his power how are you going to have power if you can't rely on what God made you I believe he knows what he's doing you can't take this book and make it work if you don't believe you're called to make it work you're always waiting to see I'm going to try it I'm going to try this Jesus expected it to happen yes sir because of what the scriptures said he was it wasn't a trying deal it wasn't I'm going to pray and see if it works he had a self-revelation can you imagine when we come to the place that we say I have been put here to prove his word the my very existence the reason I am to act actually have an understanding and revelation of your existence and position in everything I don't care how long it's taken remember he said he predestinated to be there right at that time every timing is perfect let's just finish he says you see it that's what's happening today he predestinate it this by for knowledge he predestinated Malachi 4:5 it's got to happen and when he comes over and predestines anything to happen in his word he had to provide prove his word to be so when he predestines anything to happen and says it will happen he knows that seed will be there just at that time he predestinated a bride she's going to be there going to be a Rapture she's going to be there he predestinated it by his for knowledge see there's nothing's going to stop it do you believe there's going to be anybody in the Rapture do you believe it's you do you understand that changes everything it changes your attitude it changes your fear it changes the way you treat people self re reation changes everything you're not looking at the world to make you something you're not looking at education to make you something you're not looking at peers to make you something you're not looking at religion to make you something you know something that God made you what you are before the foundations of the world you just finally got here I may be late but I made it I shook up I'm in the palm of his hand and nothing can pluck me out the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord you didn't choose me I chose you and if I started to work in it I'll finish it till the end oh Lord God give me a revelation of myself give me a revelation of where I sit in the Eternal calendar of God give me a revelation of why that you place me here give me a revelation of what I'm to do Lord give me a revelation of self am you say how important is it let me read this last statement as we close and Billy comes to give us worship he said he proves all his word all of his words just think of it all of his word and you were his word what do you think the promises of God do they don't prove him they prove you they prove whether you're a believer or unbeliever he don't need no proven he was there before there was anything to prove anything he is the proof of all things all things exist by him there's nothing that exists that didn't exist by him he's the proof he don't need to prove himself but he gives you a promise and then it pro proves Who You Are by whether you believe and accept that promise then that word comes to pass he proved it by you you're the word you're what he spoke you're what he said he'd be here you're the bride he said he would have you're the Rapture that he said's going to be this isn't historic this isn't theology this is the word made flesh I don't care what you think about yourself that's why the plastic surgeons make trillions of dollars everybody wants to change the outside you know you change the inside you find out you're pretty good [Applause] looking and you know what you find out you got a pretty Insight everybody likes you they don't care you can go anywhere I remember I got off the the the boat with lesie and I thought I'd take a stroll so I just started strolling off through the neighborhoods man I'm in some pretty dark places you I think I don't know if we were in Haiti or or Jamaica or some place it didn't matter to me I just walking down there everybody kind of looking at me man you're off you must have missed your turn you've got to be from the boat yeah no matter how you guys doing everything good you know gu's offering me stuff and didn't matter just walking around you think I knew I had the love of God in my heart and if someone knows you've got the love in the God in your heart they respect you they'll make a way for you they'll take care of you you're not walking alone you're you're the word you don't fear perfect love cast out fear perfect love is when you can accept somebody at their word cuz you know they love you and you know they you love them so if they tell you something you don't doubt it you've given them every reason to believe everything that you've ever said is true you're not one big lip service you know you believe it in your heart and he tells you I loved you while you were yet a sinner I died for you I paid the price the chastisements of your sins are on me I took the punishment and by my stripes I'll heal you can you take me at my word that's that there's no fear there it didn't matter Noah built that boat and that boat was sitting there and he was mocked and ridiculed in everything oh where's the rain you know I can see them all walking around this big boat with umbrellas he knew one thing didn't he he knew knew it was going to rain he didn't care when he didn't know how he didn't know one he knew that God said so and that settled it perfect faith is your name written on the Lamb's Book of Life were you predestinated to be here to prove his word you have eternal life not because you earned eternal life you might come to the awareness of your eternal life but remember what he said he said that seed was already laying there planted before the foundation of the world just waiting to be watered by the word of God to come to life that's me that's you and that's what he said that you have love one for another that you have confidence in one another that you believe what God did for you he did for the person sitting next to you it changes your attitude it changes your atmosphere it changes what you live for you don't want to run off and hide you want to tell the world go into all the world and preach the gospel they'll know that you are my disciples by your love to another the musicians would come he proves all of his word all of his word just think of it all of his word and you were his word he was the word and you were a part of his word and the reason that you're sent here to confirm your place in life I don't think you got that he is the word you're sent here to confirm your place in life what is my place in life my place in life is this simple he predestinated a seed to be here to believe his word that's why I'm here that's my place in life that's everything that I am is for that reason it's that simple it's not complicated why are you here I'm going to go see my mama you're my mother my dad has gone on my mom probably doesn't have too much longer 102 in July I got to accept the fact that whether it's a year or two years but they go but the reason that I'm here hasn't gone it'll never go it's why I Was Made I was made to believe this message I was made created by God to take a promise and believe it and prove that that promise is true I was made for that I wasn't made to get rich I like to build but I wasn't made to build I was made to be fruitful I was made to look up and say father thank you for putting my name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the found foundation of the world thank you for choosing me thank you for giving me I have that I might see thank you for giving me ears Lord that I can hear this message thank you that I can read and know that when he talks about the predestinated seed he's talking about me Lord increase myself Revelation I don't want to know what I think of myself I want to know what he thinks of me and where are you going to find that I find it in his word and when he says I believe that God proves his word by the believer so he predestines that seed to be here he brought Malachi 45 but Malachi 45 would have went unnoticed if he didn't predestinate a seed to sit there and say that's Malachi 45 that's Luke 17:30 that's Revelations 10:7 that's deity veiled in flesh that's Elohim in our midst doing the same signs and wonders that he did 2,000 years ago you know why we say that because we stumbled upon it because we were predestinated it's our position he's put you here that you might find your position your position as a Believer can't you believe that your you're a Believer when you can it'll change everything your struggles they become [Music] temporary your sicknesses remind you of Calvary your brother in need Sparks a love in you to

you'd like God to confirm to you who you are there's nothing I can do but I can ask that you believe his word it settles the one thing and one thing only he said so yes that settled it as the greatest thing that made our Prophet so totally amazing is he could read this word and accept it at its face value for what it said and in believing it it came to pass ask yourself when you don't live up to the word of God you're not living up to yourself but if you could just be yourself just be who God said you were there's nothing you can't do but we're happy to pray for you this morning if you would
