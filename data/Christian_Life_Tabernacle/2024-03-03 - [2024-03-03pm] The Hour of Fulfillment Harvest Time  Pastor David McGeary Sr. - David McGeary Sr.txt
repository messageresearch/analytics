Description:
The Hour of Fulfillment: Harvest Time
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Christian Life Tabernacle
March 3, 2024
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

our [Music] comforter and our King we worship you this evening as creator of all of Heaven and Earth father many religions have many different gods and many different [Music] philosophies but there was only one one way back for the elect and that was by the word from which they came Lord we ask that you would bless us tonight this evening in this wonderful time of Fellowship we ask it in jesus' name we pray amen and amen so uh thank you musicians so uh I I I told lesie I there and I said well she said are you preaching tonight I said no I said we're just going to have go straight to communion she said in no word I said okay we'll have word so anyway so I just want to let you know she gets on me a time or two all right so let's we're just going to open to the book of The Gospel of St John and and we're going to have some words word amen and uh and uh if if this don't make her happy I'm hopeless because this is the the most favorite chapter in all the Bible for me so I'm this is the meat of it all to me personally so we're just going to read one verse and then we'll have our seats John 171 these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee Lord bless your word pray Jesus name amen you may be seated Jesus spoke these words and it said says father the hour is come and so I'd like just to title this little uh thought here if I could uh the hour of fulfillment the hour of fulfillment and another way to express that hour of fulfillment would be to say Harvest Time Harvest time is the hour of fulfillment it's the time that the uh sheep has ripened the fruit has WIP ripened the seed has come to uh maturity and it's time uh to take it into the Garner because the time of its fulfillment has come and it's fulfilled its journey and so I'd like to go through these just on a little uh uh further continuance of this morning and we noticed this morning that there there was a great awareness the prophet of God said you've got to be real careful here now he in other words watch this this is very important he says that Satan is going to offer the Supernatural and you wouldn't think that he would offer the supernatural but remember he he wants to sit upon the Thrones and and and Rule rule over the Stars which are in heaven and other words he wanted to exalt himself above the sons of God and the daughters of God and so we we that's what we've got to be aware of and so we know that what we were saying is that in every age as the life passed through it stopped and and what we're talking about is that there's a continuance onto perfection when that which is perfect is come and and I guess the best way for me to express this is is that in this chapter Jesus going is going to pray and he's going to ask the father to give to his children that which is perfect another words he doesn't want anything less for his own than that which is perfect and so that's why I say it's the time of fulfillment the time when that which is perfect has come and I'd like to read a few statements uh and we're just going to go through these scriptures uh uh just slowly together if I could but I want to listen to this statement uh this is at the towards the very end of the invisible Union of of the bride of Christ so it's the invisible Union of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride there is a union and that we know that this was a uniting time and sign so the beauty of this is what that the Lord came here to accomplish and so this statement is in paragraph 3:24 um it says the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day no sir now that's striking now it it doesn't say that the blessings wouldn't work but the word wouldn't work so in other words preaching that won't won't work today and when you say something doesn't work that means it won't accomplish the task that's at hand that's right okay so it won't it won't it won't complete or finish the work so that it won't work it it it had its day it had its time it had its season it's had its purpose and though it was good and though it was perfect in its time it won't complete the task so there's something that needs to be completed there's something that's got to come that's going to make us perfect so all of us not only in our uh not only in the gospel as we're talking of the history of the Gospel but also in our own personal life of what we want to fulfill and what we want to become and the victories that uh that we want to obtain the things we want to uh have uh have the victory over and you know okay I like I read that scripture this morning when I was reading Corinthians and you know basically the scripture said he's not easily riled up you know he doesn't he does not ready to strike back so quick and I thought in my heart you know I I I want to improve on that I want to be better there and so there's got to be a way that I can be better there's got to be a way I can grab a hold of it and for the hour I'm living in cuz I'm facing things that nobody else has ever faced so are you in this generation in this hour that we live in well there's never been a time like this there's never been a confusion like this there there's never been the age of wickedness like we live in now total apostasy total separation from God and any thinking that's Christian thinking whatsoever H has just been denied we're in the days of Sodom amen and the days of Noah and uh and judgment is fixing to strike and so he's saying though that was a tremendous blessing in fact it was the birth blessing it's what caused the birth of the church church so it wasn't what was going to finish the church it was what birthed the church so that life had to come all the way down to the end but this is our messenger telling us now he's saying and I'll read it again the word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work this day no sir that was for Pentecost this is for the bride the going home of the Bride so that's the Fulfillment the going home of the Bride that's the Fulfillment of our journey is the going home of the Bride that's the Fulfillment of the Gospel is going home of the Bride when the bride's gone then that that there's there's no more fulfillment but judgment and every one else after that will have to go through the great Throne judgment and we'll be judged and weighed I don't want to go there I don't I don't want the record of my life put on display and and everybody to know and see what I thought and what I've done I want something now you understand that'll cause me to go over that great Chasm that I can pass into the kingdom that he promise was there for me and so you understand what he's telling us here as we read it he says this is for the bride going home of the Bride so this fulfillment this word of this day this message that was brought to us through a Vindicated fulfillment of Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 John 12 and many other scriptures was for the going home of the Bride that was the expressed purpose of this message was to prepare a bride for a Rapture not to not to shower us with blessings not to uh reinvent the wheel not to empower us again with a Revival if you had to choose today between having a great Revival of works and miracles and and and uh people coming out of the hospitals and a great glorious time or leaving this Earth and going into Glory what would you choose well if you say I choose leaving this Earth and going to Glory then you have to take the way that's provided to get there not a decoy that's saying this will take you there this revival will take you there this great outpouring will take you there no obedience to this word will take you there and he said this is the Pentecostal word will not work in this day now I didn't say that I would have never thought that I would have never been able even to see it if there wasn't iav given in this day that we might see you think of it our Prophet brought us is have that we could apply it to our spiritual eyes and we can see the condition see the pathway see The Shining Light understand what it is where we're going where the place on the map is that we're trying to get to other than that we would have just been rambling from Pillar To Post from revival to Revival from meeting to meeting from minister to minister from one thought one interpretation to another interpretation praise God that God sent us an absolute something that's been Vindicated and is just unquestionable and unmatched amen not one jot or t that hadn't been fulfilled and that stood the word test and went through the Hall of critics and and he goes on to say listen he says we've got something different amen now we don't need to mix yesterday with today right you know we we we we're not going to build an arc you know what I mean it won't work so we want what works for our day and what that he's telling us here and he's preaching in this particular message is the only thing that will work today is an invisible Union between the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride the only thing that will that will cause us to leave this world and he doesn't want us to approach that with a hope so oh I hope I make it I hope I can do enough works that he takes me someday uh he's going to take me no he wants it he wants it closer than that he wants it tighter than that he wants it more real than that he wants it to be that we know what he's doing that we become one with him in fact he even says that we're married to them this is a bride age it's a union it's a it's a an absolutely uh uh joining together Flesh of My Flesh bone of my bone and and he goes on to say he said the Pentecostal rep represented that again we're in the bride age amen no more than Moses's law would have worked in the time of Paul here we try to tell them you're dead to that and you cannot have that so what we're talking about is a time of fulfillment not a a time of return many people misinterpreted what the restoration was it wasn't restoration back to the gifts that fell on the day of Pentecost it was a a restoration of the faith that's that our fathers had now we're going to read this chapter slowly together verse by verse I just trust my eye hold out and I want you to as as we read this think of what it is the faith that they had because in this chapter Jesus is going to describe what it was that they possessed okay and this is a a a great chapter and I I I've got a few other quotes that I uh little areas that I want to read and I may jump over here as we go through this now let's let's let's read this beautiful Jesus is fixing the hour has come it's the time that he's now going to be taken and as as the Beautiful song was sung the crown of thorns is going to be placed upon him his throne is now going to be a cross and he's going to lay his life down for his own now he doesn't want that maybe I don't have the vocabulary to exppress it but please bear with me he doesn't want this to be in vain okay he he he wants to lay his life down and he wants it to accomplish something okay because what he's doing is he's making a purchase is that right he's going to he's going to purchase his own back he's going to purchase all that the father hath given him he's going to make payment for the sin of Adam for the first Adam was a living soul but the second Adam was a quickening spirit he's fixing to go to make payment for all the sins of his brothers and sisters and of his Kindred he is now going to go do the work of a kinsman redeemer he's going to go to the cross and he's going to pay the price for their sins he's going to take the chastisement of their peace upon themselves and by his stripes he's going to heal them hallelujah it's beautiful he says as thou hath given hath given him and this is life eternal that they might know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hath sent amen not another way I am the way the truth the life no man comes into the father but by me that they might know that that they might have the revelation of that listen to and pray he said I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou Hast given me to do the time of fulfillment I have finished the work that thou has given me to do and now oh Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was oh thank you that is beautiful let's oh I just got to read this I think maybe I should just come over and and and read this he says Now read remember this is paragraph 221 in invisible Union of the Bride but remember when it went down and the grain be to ripen you find before the grain can ripen everything in that stock has to be dead now I don't have to go through justification everything's got to die right every idea everything Hallelujah can you see where we're standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went in the ground the same Jesus in Bride form same power same church same thing same word the same word sucked up through these and come out here and come to a head here and all of that life that come through here picked up its people now it's forming up into a head for the Rapture amen yes and then he he goes down here in paragraph 222 well you were separated from your first Union by spiritual death now you are born again or remarried again to a new spiritual union for not of your natural life of the things of the world but of your eternal life that germ that was in you at the beginning found you now we're just going to read this because he's pling he says now he says now father glorify me in thy own self and glorify which I had with thee before the world was I have manifested thy name un unto men which thou Hast given me out of the world thy thine they were and thou Hast given them me and thou haast kept kept Thy word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou haast given me are of thee now this is the faith you understand that he's talking about they have known that all things that thou haast given me are of thee now he's got if we're going to have our faith restored he's got to give us something to believe in so he does the same work in our day and now the believer in our our day restored with the same faith says everything that we're hearing is of the Father for I have given unto them The Words which thou Hast given me and and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou did sent me now you're talking about what's being restored because we're talking about the Perfection that's going to come and what is it that is perfect and we're going to keep reading and and then we'll he says I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou Hast given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and all thine are mine and I am glorified in them now remember this prayer he says is not just for M the 12 but for all them that will believe his word he and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name name Those whom thou Hast given me for they are that they may be one as we are now this is what he's asking this is the Perfection hallelu this is that which is perfect that is to come that they may be one as we are well I was as I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name these that thou giveth me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of predition that the scriptures might be fulfilled and now now come I to thee and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves I have given them Thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world amen oh my isn't that beautiful I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but thou thou should us keep them from the evil they are not in the not of the world even as I am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth as thou Hast sent me into the world even so I send them also into the world and for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be Sanctified through the truth amen neither pray for I these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through through their word that they may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world might believe that thou Hast sent me now he's talking about that which is perfect when they become one as he was one with the father and the glory which thou givest me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one now this is what was going into the ground and this prayer now that prayer has to come to a time of fulfillment so it went in the ground and it started coming up through justification sanctification through Pentecost now into an invisible Union between the bride and Christ i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou haast sent me and have loved the them as thou Hast loved me oh this is beautiful this is what it's all about this is what he prayed for this is when he went to the cross for that we can be one with the father as he was one with the father that we can be one with him as he was one that the love that was in the father would be in us just the way he loved the father that he loved us father I will that thou also whom thou Hast given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou haast given me for for thou lovest me before the foundations of the world oh righteous father the world hath not known thee but I have known thee and these have known that thou ha sent me and I declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherein thou haast loved me may be in them and I in them if I could try just to say that's the Perfection we don't want to miss and i' just like to close and say these few words and I'll ask brother Billy to read our communion scriptures to us tonight before communion so we just read this statement it said that the germ that was in you at the beginning found you he says your name now is in the book of life is in the is in the Book of Life but not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life which the lamb redeemed and the old book of your natural Union but your new bride Hallelujah not the old book of your natural but your new bride Hallelujah your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life so what does he open in this age he takes the Lamb's Book of Life he puts his foot on the land and the Sea and he opens the book and your name is in there your married certificate Hallelujah where your true Eternal germ from the beginning takes hold yes sir so now we're talking about what it is that this perfect thing not the old Union yeah but something that's new and different is going to take hold in you what was in you in eternity now takes F hold that that seed finds you you yes he said your marriage your true Eternal germ from the beginning takes hold now you're not forgiven but you're Justified Glory Justified Romans 51 therefore being justified by faith and we're not going to to read all that but we're just going to jump over and and read this he says therefore being justified I was accused you were accused you never done it in the first place the old Union is in the sea of God's forgetfulness you wasn't married you you wasn't married to it it to begin with the bridegroom bore your shame for you in your place he took your place for you were predestinated for him to be his bride before the foundation of the world the Bible said so you are the predestinated seed now we're talking about what was perfect has come now what was perfect was in the word of God for it was the perfect word of God it was the original spoken seed how did you come to this you were deceived into it by your first marriage to your adulterous parents Eve it's no fault of your own but your natural birth came after Eve who committed adultery that's the reason you were born an adulterous you were a sinner to begin with that's right you were deceived into it no you ain't no it isn't or ain't your fault you never did it because the little germ that was in you was to be you from the foundation of the beginning of the world God put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life where was your new life it was in the Lamb's Book what did God do he put He put he he put your little germ that was in you to be before the foundation of world he put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life and what makes it perfect because that book was opened and we found our name on it and now we know because we are going to be known as we were known and how did he know us he knew us as being The Germ that was in him in the beginning oh I I know sometimes it sounds complicated but the truth of the matter is it's so simple and so beautiful that all that the father hath given me will come to me and so when we we want just to say that this is the time time of fulfillment when that which is perfect is come that which is in part is done away and we can rejoice and people say well I want those blessings well not only do you have those blessings you have more than those blessings you have him who gave those blessings you have

Heavenly bridegroom God bless you brother B would you mind coming and taking and reading the communion scriptures and they will then we'll bless the bread amen let's all stand and read it 1 Corinthians 11 the 23rd says for I have received of the Lord that which I also deliver unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when when he had given thanks he Brak it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood do this do ye as often as he drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whatsoever whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the blood of the body and of the blood of the Lord but let every man examine himself so let him let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would Jud we would be we would judge if we would if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat t one for another and if any mean any man hunger let him eat at home that he come not together unto condemnation and the rest will I set in
