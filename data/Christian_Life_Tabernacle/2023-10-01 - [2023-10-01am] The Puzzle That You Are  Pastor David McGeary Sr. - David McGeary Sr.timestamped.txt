[16:34] just to draw closer to you be with us
[16:37] now we ask this all in the name of the
[16:39] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[16:44] amen all right we're going to read just
[16:46] a short Psalm this morning
[16:50] um know
[16:53] you you know you're going to be up here
[16:55] and you have many many thoughts that
[16:57] you'd like to go to and just exhort and
[17:00] and try to benefit someone by what you
[17:03] might say and and I had a song picked
[17:05] out
[17:07] and you know you hear ministers
[17:10] evangelists at times come and say well
[17:13] you know in preparation for this service
[17:14] or this set of meetings I was going to
[17:16] go in this direction and the Lord lead
[17:18] you in another
[17:20] Direction it is true you know uh you
[17:24] open God's word every day it's a new
[17:25] every morning that's right and uh what
[17:28] you thought yesterday or or the day
[17:30] before may not be what he wants you to
[17:32] think about
[17:33] today and
[17:35] uh so we're going to reflect on just a
[17:38] short Psalm this morning rather than a
[17:40] long one which you may benefit from that
[17:43] but uh Psalm
[17:45] 93 and especially there on the fifth
[17:50] verse Holiness becometh thine house oh
[17:54] Lord
[17:57] forever
[17:59] you know there's a beauty and
[18:01] Holiness that you don't get everywhere
[18:04] and we're able to come together like
[18:06] this especially standing up here and
[18:08] you're able to look out on a
[18:10] Congregation of people that have been
[18:13] called out set
[18:15] aside elected to
[18:18] walk in what we're walking in we're
[18:21] blessed of the lord we don't do this
[18:23] because we want to be different but
[18:26] because we are different we serve a true
[18:28] and living
[18:32] God in 2 Corinthians
[18:35] 6:16
[18:37] Paul tells the
[18:39] people if I can find it
[18:44] here ye are the Temple of the Living God
[18:47] as God ha said I will dwell in them and
[18:50] walk in them and I will be their God and
[18:54] they shall be my people that's what I
[18:57] want to declare this morning
[18:59] that we are the people of God Amen and
[19:02] if you turn back to 1 Corinthians 3:16
[19:05] it says know ye not ye are a temple of
[19:09] God and the spirit of God dwelleth in
[19:11] you amen amen it's not uh by our own
[19:15] actions we do these things and Paul my
[19:18] my he
[19:20] uh I kind of term it the the conundrum
[19:22] of Paul or the Paradox of Paul how he
[19:25] was as he calls himself the Pharisee of
[19:27] Pharisees that he was strict and knew
[19:30] you look at the the New Testament
[19:33] scriptures what Paul wrote in his
[19:34] letters how much he quoted David or even
[19:37] the Old Testament he says Elias you know
[19:40] he said that uh they have ears they hear
[19:42] not they have eyes they see
[19:44] not I believe that's in Hebrews
[19:50] 11 Romans 11 excuse
[19:55] me pardon me for
[19:59] just a little side thing here God hath
[20:02] not Cast Away his people which he fornew
[20:04] what ye not what the scripture said of
[20:06] Elias how he maketh an intercession to
[20:08] God against Israel saying Lord they've
[20:10] killed my prophets and he goes on
[20:12] talking about how are the Jews condemned
[20:16] he says no they're blinded in part so
[20:18] the fullness of the Gentiles become in
[20:20] we're blessed people and Paul talks
[20:23] about that mystery his whole message was
[20:25] a mystery of God the mystery being that
[20:29] Christ in you the hope of glory amen
[20:32] that's what we're exhibiting to a lost
[20:35] and dying world right now is Christ in
[20:37] you the hope of glory amen and I would
[20:40] ask this I I uh I kind of
[20:44] uh uh ask my wife and also my
[20:47] sister-in-law Lori just to see what they
[20:49] would say but I I had this thought and
[20:53] it's a strange one and I I think strange
[20:55] thing sometimes but uh what was Eve's
[20:59] maiden
[21:00] name anybody
[21:02] know think about that she had a maiden
[21:05] name
[21:09] H it was
[21:11] Adam right before she was Eve she was
[21:14] Adam
[21:16] right and you dwell on that she is him
[21:21] that's right she came from him who are
[21:24] we he said everything that God was he
[21:27] poured into Christ everything that
[21:28] Christ was he poured into his
[21:33] church we serve a true and living
[21:36] perfect
[21:37] God and far be it from me to call myself
[21:40] perfect but I believe we all serve a
[21:43] perfect God and if deity Reigns in us he
[21:45] says she is
[21:47] him we are him we're called to a higher
[21:51] calling this
[21:54] morning we are a temple of the Holy
[21:57] Ghost
[21:58] let's just read that Psalm before I get
[22:00] carried away
[22:01] here amen reading together Psalm
[22:05] 93 the Lord reth he is clothed with
[22:09] Majesty the Lord is clothed with
[22:11] strength wherewith Heath girded himself
[22:14] the world also is established that it
[22:16] cannot be moved thy Throne is
[22:19] established of old thou art from
[22:21] Everlasting the floods have lifted up oh
[22:24] Lord the floods have lifted up their
[22:26] voice the s lift up their waves the Lord
[22:30] on high is mightier than the voice of
[22:32] many Waters yay than the mighty waves of
[22:35] the sea thy testimonies are very sure
[22:38] Holiness becometh thine house O Lord
[22:41] forever and may I at this uh really do
[22:45] appreciate Brother Paul's message on
[22:47] Wednesday where is he at Lord bless you
[22:51] brother amen I don't know how many more
[22:53] of than myself are benefiting from the
[22:55] correction that we heard on Wednesday
[22:56] night but I believe it will all Lift us
[22:58] up higher amen let me add this too that
[23:01] he he talked about
[23:03] Elijah you know and we' heard on tape
[23:06] not too many services ago about that
[23:08] spiritual food that Elijah
[23:11] got okay and how two different times he
[23:14] was fed by Ravens at the creek and then
[23:17] when he was under the juniper tree the
[23:20] angel of the Lord came down and he was
[23:22] running from Jezebel right and he got
[23:23] out there under that tree and he said oh
[23:26] Lord take me my work is finished I just
[23:28] want to
[23:29] die God wasn't through with him and he
[23:32] slept under that tree and he and an
[23:35] angel came and woke him up and says
[23:36] arise and eat there was a Cru of water
[23:38] and there was bread bacon on the coals
[23:40] and he went back to sleep but there's
[23:42] benefits in second helpings let me tell
[23:44] you cuz he came back and said arise and
[23:47] eat and he ate again and the Bible says
[23:49] he went in the strength of that meat for
[23:51] 40 days and 40 nights think of that and
[23:54] he went to the cave horb and that's
[23:55] where the Lord passed by and the the
[23:57] earthquake and the wind and in the fire
[23:59] the still small boys and he remind him
[24:02] there's still work to be done you have
[24:03] to go down and anoint these Kings over
[24:05] Syria and Jerusalem or over Israel and
[24:09] he said he also anoint Elisha to take
[24:12] your place so bless and then he let him
[24:14] know there's 7,000 that have not bowed
[24:17] their knee so thank you Lord there's a

[43:25] and
[43:27] good
[43:33] morning yeah I've really been moved by
[43:36] the uh things that have come across this
[43:39] Pulpit over the past several weeks and
[43:44] uh it's really caused me to uh to uh you
[43:49] know do some self-examination and look
[43:51] at what am I uh what am I laboring for
[43:54] what am I struggling to to achieve and
[43:58] and where is that leading me and uh I
[44:02] ran across this
[44:03] quote um I'm not going to say the whole
[44:06] quote but you know brother brandom he
[44:08] compared uh the city of Babylon you know
[44:12] he said it was a
[44:14] perversion of Glory you know because
[44:16] they built the city on the river
[44:18] Euphrates and he said in that River ran
[44:21] by The Throne of the king and uh one
[44:25] thing about the river it has a
[44:27] current and uh you know um we see people
[44:33] today that you know are caught up in the
[44:36] things of the world and that that pulls
[44:38] on us you know every day we deal with it
[44:42] and uh you know it's pulling them
[44:44] towards you know spending their time and
[44:47] their energy our time and our energy to
[44:50] do things that honor that King and his
[44:53] throne and um
[44:56] but uh there's another river that we
[44:59] want to be caught up in its
[45:01] flow and
[45:04] uh you know and we just heard brother
[45:07] Paul you know and I just say it this way
[45:10] you know that basically there's two
[45:11] rivers that are set before us you know
[45:14] and one is life and one is death and
[45:16] it's a daily battle and you know to
[45:19] resist the wrong current but our desire
[45:21] is to be in that current that pulls us
[45:24] to a life of worship before our God and
[45:28] King and uh so this song's been on my
[45:32] heart it's uh I'm going to sing in
[45:34] Spanish it's a it's a song I it just
[45:38] came on my heart I've been singing it

[1:01:56] life this world that we live
[1:01:59] in this Cosmos that we're a part
[1:02:05] of isn't the final end of our hearts in
[1:02:10] our
[1:02:11] lives there's something in us that tells
[1:02:14] us there's a land beyond the
[1:02:18] river something that speaks within our
[1:02:21] soul and calls deep calling
[1:02:26] to our original
[1:02:29] origin
[1:02:31] where where from whence we've come
[1:02:34] father we want to go
[1:02:36] back we've dropped down into this space
[1:02:39] of Time Lord and and now we're seeking
[1:02:43] our return and you came and spoke to us
[1:02:47] and said I am the way the truth the life
[1:02:52] no man can come unto the father but by
[1:02:55] me Lord and we're here today that you
[1:02:59] might speak to our
[1:03:02] hearts that that way might become a
[1:03:05] little
[1:03:07] clear father
[1:03:09] that life and Truth
[1:03:13] might be our portion this morning that
[1:03:17] we can see and that you would give us is

[1:03:40] read
[1:03:42] uh you know our messenger told us he
[1:03:44] said if you don't see Jesus Christ in
[1:03:47] every verse in the Bible go back and
[1:03:49] read it again well you'll pick a
[1:03:52] scripture and and it'll be a good
[1:03:54] thought and then all of a sudden you
[1:03:57] find yourself uh adding another
[1:04:00] scripture and another scripture and
[1:04:02] another scripture and pretty soon you
[1:04:04] have so many but we just like to read
[1:04:06] two portions of scripture one just a
[1:04:08] short verse uh found in Matthew the 6th
[1:04:13] chapter and the 8th
[1:04:16] verse we certainly greet you all this
[1:04:18] morning
[1:04:20] and we have any visitors among us we
[1:04:23] hope that you don't feel like a
[1:04:25] visitor we hope that you feel the
[1:04:27] comfort and love of the Lord Jesus and
[1:04:30] and that your heart is warmed by his
[1:04:34] presence he said says in uh in we know
[1:04:40] these great chapters of Matthew are just
[1:04:42] so rich to us but Jesus makes this
[1:04:45] simple statement he says be not ye
[1:04:48] therefore liken unto them for your
[1:04:52] father knoweth what things
[1:04:54] ye have need of before ye ask him amen
[1:05:00] so uh we just like to do that and then
[1:05:03] let's turn over to Peter um if we could
[1:05:08] and
[1:05:09] um and read the first uh few verses of
[1:05:17] um of
[1:05:23] um
[1:05:24] see if I have that correct here in my
[1:05:28] uh yes the second first Peter the 2
[1:05:34] chapter it says wherefore laying aside
[1:05:38] all
[1:05:40] malice and all
[1:05:42] guile and
[1:05:45] hypocrisies and envies and all evil
[1:05:51] speakings as newb Maes did Desiring the
[1:05:55] sincere milk of the word that ye may
[1:05:59] grow
[1:06:02] thereby if so be ye have
[1:06:05] tasted that the Lord is gracious how
[1:06:09] many's tasted that the Lord is gracious
[1:06:12] Amen to whom coming as unto Lively
[1:06:17] Stones disallowed indeed of men but
[1:06:22] chosen of God and
[1:06:25] precious ye
[1:06:27] also as Lively stones are built up a
[1:06:33] spiritual house a holy priesthood to

[1:06:46] bless your word in Jesus precious name
[1:06:48] we pray amen you may be seated this
[1:06:53] morning
[1:06:59] I I I enjoyed that this morning brother
[1:07:02] Tim and uh especially when you ask about
[1:07:05] that maiden name that uh that got me to
[1:07:09] thinking because
[1:07:11] uh you know like a puzzle you know you
[1:07:15] want I wanted to sit on it and think and
[1:07:19] uh you know I it it but you know there's
[1:07:22] a lot of things like that that are said
[1:07:25] you know that uh cause you to think well
[1:07:29] I ran across one the other day that it
[1:07:32] it cause causes you to think and and uh
[1:07:37] this little statement uh is out of the
[1:07:41] book Running From the presence of the
[1:07:43] Lord uh my heart's leaning uh a little
[1:07:47] bit in that direction for next weekend
[1:07:50] I'm going to be in the a Cloverdale
[1:07:53] Bible w for a couple services so uh keep
[1:07:56] us in prayer
[1:07:58] there but this is what brother Bram says
[1:08:01] if you you can put it up there if you
[1:08:03] can find it Brothers it's uh paragraph
[1:08:06] uh six right in the beginning of the
[1:08:09] running of the presence of the Lord and
[1:08:13] uh could that can you find that real
[1:08:15] quick and but I I'll I'll read it if he
[1:08:18] can't find it but it says I think this
[1:08:21] is a great privilege tonight that I've
[1:08:24] waited on for some time the other day I
[1:08:28] was telling my wife I said I get so
[1:08:31] nervous waiting to get to the
[1:08:35] Tabernacle I have other friends of
[1:08:38] course I do around the world but there's
[1:08:42] something another about this Tabernacle
[1:08:46] here and uh so and then this is the
[1:08:50] statement that that really just struck
[1:08:53] me it said listen to this it's amazing I
[1:08:58] was took out of this dust around
[1:09:04] here when God gave me life here on the
[1:09:08] earth and I guess if he terries I'll be
[1:09:12] buried here somewhere when he comes
[1:09:16] he'll find me here somewhere and I just
[1:09:21] when I I just took that and I thought I
[1:09:24] I was taken out of the Dust of the earth
[1:09:27] somewhere around here and it struck me
[1:09:30] so much how that
[1:09:33] God has our
[1:09:36] lives so laid out and uh he's so mindful
[1:09:41] of us where we came from and how that
[1:09:45] that what Eternal beings we really are I
[1:09:51] know we don't look at ourselves as
[1:09:53] eternal being because of this mortal
[1:09:56] flesh but this was sowed in sin and born
[1:10:00] in iniquity and the curse of this flesh
[1:10:03] is death that's because the Lord took uh
[1:10:09] Adam took another route but we are also
[1:10:12] comforted with these great words that if
[1:10:14] you have eternal life you always had
[1:10:17] eternal life and that you were with him
[1:10:20] in the beginning and so only only the
[1:10:24] Lord in his
[1:10:26] infinite power and wisdom could go
[1:10:30] through time and take you out of the
[1:10:33] Dust of the Earth because it was all in
[1:10:36] him in the first place and so it's just
[1:10:39] such a marvelous thing and I hope it's a
[1:10:42] comforting thing to you today and I I
[1:10:46] know that there's a lot of pressure in
[1:10:50] the hour that we live in and a a a lot
[1:10:55] of uh fear spoken everywhere and uh
[1:11:01] doubt about the economy and uh uh doubt
[1:11:05] about uh the worth of our dollar and and
[1:11:09] unemployment and uh AI I think that's
[1:11:13] artificial intelligence well the whole
[1:11:16] world is an artificial
[1:11:18] intelligence it's none of what they're
[1:11:21] saying is true
[1:11:24] if they were born in sin shaped in
[1:11:27] iniquity came into the world speaking
[1:11:30] lies don't you think they're still
[1:11:32] speaking
[1:11:34] lies but it it's such an atmosphere to
[1:11:37] try to live in and and you know so uh
[1:11:43] your economy you know I think well how
[1:11:45] am I going to pay my house bill how am I
[1:11:47] going to make my car payment you know
[1:11:49] what happens if Social Security
[1:11:52] collapses you know or what happens if I
[1:11:55] get really really sick and and all those
[1:11:59] things but I'm not looking for the world
[1:12:01] to take care of me
[1:12:03] amen do you know what I mean I mean I've
[1:12:07] I have I have an economic
[1:12:10] strategy that does not
[1:12:14] fail amen it says the righteous shall
[1:12:17] not bake
[1:12:19] bread amen well so if I can do my best
[1:12:23] to keep myself righteous he promised me
[1:12:28] that I wouldn't bake bread amen I don't
[1:12:31] have to sit at the table of Sinners I
[1:12:34] don't have to give in the pressures of
[1:12:36] the world I don't have to fall subject
[1:12:41] to what man thinks I don't have to
[1:12:43] change my thinking uh and what I stand
[1:12:47] for to be able to survive in this world
[1:12:50] he'll make a way you know most of us
[1:12:54] have had the fortune of living well but
[1:12:57] you know there's lots of people that
[1:12:59] have gone through lots of hard times and
[1:13:02] that have had to do nothing but rely on
[1:13:05] the Eternal Grace of the Lord for all
[1:13:08] that they have need of and and don't let
[1:13:11] that die don't let that wither away
[1:13:15] don't let that let's build our faith
[1:13:17] that's what we want we want to really to
[1:13:19] continue to build our faith uh we are
[1:13:23] living here today we've come here and
[1:13:26] we're here because we believe that soon
[1:13:30] and very soon he's going to return
[1:13:34] back and he's there's going to be a
[1:13:37] translation what we refer to as a
[1:13:40] Rapture a a changing of Dimensions where
[1:13:45] this Earthly body will fall away and we
[1:13:48] have one waiting for one that we can
[1:13:50] step into one that travels like a
[1:13:53] thought one that doesn't taste sickness
[1:13:56] nor death it's it's it's it's another a
[1:13:59] whole completely a different realm we
[1:14:03] live now in Satan's zeden and Satan's
[1:14:07] zeden and the God of this evil age is is
[1:14:11] governed by certain laws laws of physics
[1:14:15] laws of reaping and sewing there's
[1:14:17] there's laws that are are under and all
[1:14:21] those laws came with the first when man
[1:14:24] sinned he dropped out of that one great
[1:14:27] Dimension called Eden and he came into
[1:14:30] another dimension and that realm and
[1:14:33] this realm was set a guard that didn't
[1:14:36] allow man to pass from that Chasm unto
[1:14:41] the other Chasm but yet that still
[1:14:43] exists and by God's witness to witness
[1:14:47] us that that exists he allows that realm
[1:14:51] to drop into our Realm
[1:14:53] every now and then and we call that the
[1:14:56] supernatural where the supernatural will
[1:14:59] visit our realm and God will do for us
[1:15:03] things to keep his word alive in our
[1:15:06] heart but the purpose of the word of God
[1:15:10] is to bring us somewhere that's what he
[1:15:13] said he said in my father's house are
[1:15:16] many mansions if it were not so I would
[1:15:19] not tell you and I go to prepare a place
[1:15:22] for you that where I am you may be also
[1:15:26] and and we can't lose sight of that we
[1:15:29] can't we can't get into the framework of
[1:15:33] man's thinking that this is just
[1:15:36] religion oh you're religious or you have
[1:15:40] your religion what's your religion
[1:15:43] what's your belief in God uh what how do
[1:15:47] you interpret the Bible this is not any
[1:15:52] of of that this is a lost
[1:15:57] people who are not of this world who are
[1:16:01] trying to get back to another land and
[1:16:05] another dimension in the eyes of the
[1:16:08] world this is the greatest sci-fi story
[1:16:11] that ever was in existence a lost
[1:16:15] people living in a world that's not
[1:16:19] their world trying to get back to where
[1:16:23] they came
[1:16:24] from oh Hallelujah call me crazy but I I
[1:16:29] I can feel it
[1:16:31] calling amen it's close it's near it's
[1:16:37] pulsating and and the whole world can
[1:16:41] can uh is quaking be because of the uh
[1:16:46] Revelation and the calling of the Sons
[1:16:48] and Daughters of
[1:16:51] God again we don't want to we don't want
[1:16:53] to lose sight of that again I know that
[1:16:57] it we we in our lives that uh we have
[1:17:01] mates and we raise children and and we
[1:17:04] go on with the process of our lives and
[1:17:06] our civilization but if you can separate
[1:17:10] yourself as a being uh and realize that
[1:17:15] that you you're you're accountable and
[1:17:18] and and we need to take heed and work
[1:17:20] out our own salvation with you're and
[1:17:23] trembling and ask the Lord to make this
[1:17:27] world that we're going to from where I
[1:17:30] come from now they might come in and
[1:17:34] wrap me in a straight jacket after this
[1:17:37] service but I am not of this world I've
[1:17:41] come from God and I go back to God Amen
[1:17:45] I believe that with all my heart I
[1:17:48] believe that we saw the first fruits of
[1:17:52] the Resurrection we saw one that came
[1:17:56] though he had no sin in him he came by
[1:18:00] the way of sin the way that we came he
[1:18:03] was birthed into this world not the
[1:18:05] coming together of a man and woman not
[1:18:08] the coming together of God and Mary but
[1:18:12] he created in Mary the function of life
[1:18:18] and he was born and birthed in a manger
[1:18:20] and lived and learned Obed ience by the
[1:18:23] things that he suffered became subject
[1:18:28] totally subject to the word of God even
[1:18:32] to paying the penalty of sin which was
[1:18:36] death because in him he was life and
[1:18:40] life more abundant and the light of the
[1:18:44] world he rose again from the dead
[1:18:48] Hallelujah and what what what was he why
[1:18:51] when he rose again he conquered hell
[1:18:54] death in the grave so we and prooved to
[1:18:58] us beyond that grave beyond that funeral
[1:19:03] ceremony beyond that casket that gets
[1:19:06] rolled up beyond that there is a whole
[1:19:09] another world there's a whole another
[1:19:11] life there's a whole another
[1:19:15] reality death isn't the end of it for us
[1:19:18] death is like open the door you you know
[1:19:21] what I mean uh if if if you ever have to
[1:19:25] stand over my casket just be ready cuz
[1:19:28] it might start singing oh happy days
[1:19:31] right in the right in the box that's not
[1:19:36] me that's not
[1:19:40] me
[1:19:42] why there's there's more to me than
[1:19:46] that don't you feel that about
[1:19:50] yourself you know the world is so con
[1:19:53] concentrated on this flesh if you don't
[1:19:55] like the color of your eyes you can get
[1:19:58] different color you don't like your
[1:20:00] eyebrows or somebody will pluck them and
[1:20:03] pum them and paint them and brush them
[1:20:05] and Trim in them and and you know what I
[1:20:08] mean so you get you look just like a cat
[1:20:11] if you want to you know what I mean if
[1:20:13] you don't like your hair well we can add
[1:20:15] extensions we can fluff it we can puff
[1:20:18] it we can chop it we can twist it we can
[1:20:21] braid it we can do anything that you
[1:20:24] want with in fact you don't like that we
[1:20:26] can stick a whole another thing on
[1:20:30] you oh yeah if I don't like this you
[1:20:33] know I can I can take this pill and I
[1:20:36] can talk to Bosley and I can go down to
[1:20:39] see the wigger and you know what I mean
[1:20:41] I you can work on this thing all you
[1:20:43] want but I'll tell you one thing it ends
[1:20:46] up stooped and wrinkled and it
[1:20:51] goes you know we could we would give I I
[1:20:56] believe and I think it's still true that
[1:20:59] uh people spend more money on uh like
[1:21:02] cosmetics and personal AIDS than they do
[1:21:05] on
[1:21:09] food well they their their whole
[1:21:13] minds are pointed in the wrong direction
[1:21:16] and the carnal mind is enity with God
[1:21:21] the carnal mind is against God's ways it
[1:21:25] can't comprehend the things of God but
[1:21:28] what we want to do is our whole desire
[1:21:31] from the word of God and the preaching
[1:21:33] of the
[1:21:34] Gospel Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:21:38] hearing by the word of God we want to
[1:21:40] believe and begin to believe that this
[1:21:43] Supernatural
[1:21:45] Dimension this other realm I I don't
[1:21:48] maybe have vocabularies to explain it I
[1:21:51] I it to me it's the spirit of God the
[1:21:55] holy spirit that that Spirit wants to
[1:21:58] make contact with you and I know you you
[1:22:02] want to make contact with it and there's
[1:22:04] got to be something that said something
[1:22:07] that ignites that Faith to believe that
[1:22:11] faith that these two Realms can make
[1:22:14] contact and where do those two Realms
[1:22:17] come together those two Realms come
[1:22:20] together in The Believer
[1:22:24] they come together in the believing
[1:22:27] heart and and God deals from the inside
[1:22:30] out he deals with the heart the trouble
[1:22:33] is is that it's got to pass through the
[1:22:37] mind it's got to pass through the mind
[1:22:40] to get into the heart our messenger says
[1:22:43] what happens is it comes to your mind as
[1:22:45] a seed of God that when it drops into
[1:22:48] your heart then it becomes the will of
[1:22:51] God cuz it ABS once that word drops into
[1:22:55] your heart it absolutely possesses
[1:22:59] you you become possessed you become you
[1:23:03] become uh driven because it's if the
[1:23:07] battle's dropped out of your mind now it
[1:23:10] becomes a desire of your heart and your
[1:23:12] desire of your heart craves for that
[1:23:14] desire of your heart you you you call
[1:23:17] and you keep calling and then the great
[1:23:20] promise of God's word this is how God's
[1:23:22] work work he says then he gives you the
[1:23:25] desire of your heart
[1:23:28] amen he never promised to give you the
[1:23:31] fantasy of your
[1:23:36] mind but the
[1:23:38] desire of your
[1:23:42] heart the question is what is your
[1:23:44] heart's
[1:23:47] desire do you desire the
[1:23:49] world and the things of the world
[1:23:54] John not condemning us but trying to
[1:23:57] instruct us said if you love the world
[1:23:59] and the things of the world the love of
[1:24:02] God is not in you now that wasn't a
[1:24:09] condemnation it was an
[1:24:11] instruction in
[1:24:14] righteousness it was a I have it was an
[1:24:18] eye openening Revelation wait a minute
[1:24:21] examine yourself
[1:24:22] what's the desire of your heart if if if
[1:24:26] you if you love the world and the things
[1:24:28] of the world then the love of God hasn't
[1:24:31] made contact in you and the desire of
[1:24:33] your heart's not right but you'll never
[1:24:36] see God till your heart is
[1:24:39] right you'll observe
[1:24:44] them but we're not talking about that
[1:24:46] kind of seeing we're talking about the
[1:24:49] reality of seeing God in your life
[1:24:52] knowing that it's not you it's him that
[1:24:56] he did
[1:24:58] it that you've seen him in reality you
[1:25:01] haven't heard about him you haven't seen
[1:25:03] stories about him you haven't seen the
[1:25:05] effect on somebody else but it's become
[1:25:08] personal and you can say I have
[1:25:10] personally made contact with the other
[1:25:13] dimension I know it's real I have seen
[1:25:17] it come from that realm to this realm
[1:25:20] and manifest and do for me things that
[1:25:23] are Beyond everything that I could have
[1:25:26] even thought or desired because he is
[1:25:28] the same yesterday today and
[1:25:33] forever then then we start to understand
[1:25:36] oh I want to go to that
[1:25:39] place that's why what what was it he
[1:25:41] called it Earnest the
[1:25:44] earnest of our great expectation the
[1:25:47] earnest of our Salvation the earnest of
[1:25:50] our
[1:25:51] inheritance
[1:25:53] that that's what we're here for this
[1:25:56] morning we're not here for no other
[1:26:00] reason we're here to make the
[1:26:04] Rapture and my
[1:26:07] duty to those and I Don't Preach a
[1:26:10] gospel to the world I I'm not preaching
[1:26:12] to anybody outside of this building I
[1:26:15] have no message God sent a messenger
[1:26:18] he's got the message for the church he
[1:26:21] don't need little unindicated peons like
[1:26:24] us trying to bring his message he
[1:26:27] brought it he Vindicated it he put in it
[1:26:30] just what we need and can we ought to
[1:26:32] spend a lot of time instead of Channel
[1:26:34] hopping to every preacher listening to
[1:26:37] what he said amen that's
[1:26:40] right and you wouldn't get all these
[1:26:42] movements and all these mental things I
[1:26:45] don't want to be thrilled with a great
[1:26:48] IM in intellectual stimulation because
[1:26:51] somebody can put sentences together and
[1:26:54] paragraphs together and quotes together
[1:26:57] and draw a picture my mind has never
[1:27:00] seen that's it well you s Sav o Dolly
[1:27:03] did
[1:27:07] that did that go over your
[1:27:10] head oh well shows how old I am
[1:27:15] Tim no really this gospel is for I don't
[1:27:18] care how old you are this gospel is for
[1:27:21] you
[1:27:24] and that's what our goal is our goal is
[1:27:28] have the
[1:27:30] faith every member of this body this
[1:27:34] body here that we assemble ourselves
[1:27:37] under the banner of Christian Life
[1:27:40] Tabernacle it could be any name it does
[1:27:44] that's not the point it's a body that's
[1:27:47] fitted and joined together Lively Stones
[1:27:51] building a building together for the
[1:27:53] inhabitants of Jesus Christ that the
[1:27:56] works that he did you can do also that
[1:28:00] that is the point of of of our gathering
[1:28:04] that by faith that the word by faith can
[1:28:09] increase your
[1:28:12] faith that and and your wisdom and your
[1:28:19] knowledge of the things that God has for
[1:28:22] you that you will have by faith access
[1:28:27] to the
[1:28:28] supernatural that that Supernatural
[1:28:31] power can work in your lives not only
[1:28:34] for you but for others that you love and
[1:28:37] care
[1:28:39] for and then when we come to those
[1:28:42] places in our lives and and we're
[1:28:44] dedicated to that and we're personally
[1:28:48] each one of us dedicated to the kingdom
[1:28:50] of God living for God loving God loving
[1:28:53] one another as he loved us that the the
[1:28:57] love of God might be shed abroad in our
[1:28:59] hearts by the holy spirit that that
[1:29:02] we're word orientated word filled word
[1:29:06] life that that's what we want we want
[1:29:09] what he wants amen we want to we want to
[1:29:13] transform to what that we are to what
[1:29:18] that he wants us to be
[1:29:20] amen and that's where I just want to
[1:29:23] take a few moments this morning to to as
[1:29:27] Peter would say in his scripture to stir
[1:29:31] up your pure Minds by way of remembrance
[1:29:36] to to bring into your heart a a
[1:29:39] remembrance of why that we got started
[1:29:43] in this in the first place I know why I
[1:29:45] got started because I was
[1:29:48] suicidal I was in desperate desperate
[1:29:53] condition I I was placed in a place uh
[1:29:56] that I I just didn't know where my life
[1:29:58] was at and he reached down his hand for
[1:30:03] me amen so this is not a place that
[1:30:07] we've done for ourselves it's what he's
[1:30:10] done for us
[1:30:12] amen but I'd like just to share a quick
[1:30:16] thought trusting
[1:30:19] that uh we won't be
[1:30:22] very long to
[1:30:25] morning but I I I certainly believe with
[1:30:31] all my heart that God is hid in
[1:30:37] Simplicity and not only does he hide in
[1:30:41] Simplicity but he reveals himself in
[1:30:46] simplicity so he hides himself in simple
[1:30:50] things in simple ways the ways that
[1:30:54] confound the wise and The Prudent but
[1:30:58] ways that he can reveal them to babes
[1:31:01] such as would learn and I know man
[1:31:04] thinks that he's a great spiritual giant
[1:31:08] that he has achieved all kinds of
[1:31:11] knowledge but isn't it amazing that all
[1:31:13] the knowledge that man has achieved all
[1:31:17] the science that he's gathered together
[1:31:20] all the history that he's recorded
[1:31:22] brother Matt's all going to pass away
[1:31:24] that's right
[1:31:26] amen it's all none of it's lasting none
[1:31:31] of it's lasting Heaven and Earth will
[1:31:33] pass away but Jesus said my word will
[1:31:36] not pass away and so he hides himself he
[1:31:40] hides himself in simple things he hides
[1:31:43] himself so that the wise and The Prudent
[1:31:46] pass over it that that that they they
[1:31:49] they keep looking for him to manifest in
[1:31:51] their minds they keep think waiting for
[1:31:54] him to manifest in their world in their
[1:31:57] organizations in their systems and their
[1:32:01] educations they they they think if
[1:32:03] there's a God he'll be the god of my
[1:32:07] realm he'll be the god of my creation
[1:32:10] he'll be the god of my thinking he'll be
[1:32:14] the god that comes the way that I think
[1:32:17] he should come that's why Israel missed
[1:32:20] their Messiah all the prophets all the
[1:32:23] words that were spoken everything that
[1:32:25] was prophesied everything that could
[1:32:27] done it all came to pass and it came
[1:32:30] pass right underneath their nose and
[1:32:32] they couldn't see it the Stars the wise
[1:32:35] men the everything about it the
[1:32:38] prophecies everything absolutely
[1:32:41] unfolded and it went right over their
[1:32:44] heads because they were expecting him to
[1:32:47] come the way that he
[1:32:49] thought they should come
[1:32:56] that's so
[1:32:59] personal and they missed
[1:33:01] it cuz he he HD himself he HD himself in
[1:33:06] a little
[1:33:10] baby from a little town called
[1:33:17] Nazareth in a
[1:33:19] little country of Galilee
[1:33:23] and snuck down to a town called
[1:33:27] Bethlehem everyday's Christmas to
[1:33:32] meall and was
[1:33:35] hid in a little baby and some Shepherds
[1:33:40] came and the angels appeared and said oh
[1:33:46] Hallelujah hosana in the highest blessed
[1:33:49] are men for today has born unto them a
[1:33:53] savior in Bethlehem wise men came and
[1:33:57] said I seen a star walks into the city
[1:33:59] gives the prophecy tells them and
[1:34:02] everything they search the scripture and
[1:34:04] they reject it and try to kill every kid
[1:34:07] in Bethlehem filling Rach the promise of
[1:34:11] the mour and of Rachel the children and
[1:34:13] all the scriptures absolutely fulfilled
[1:34:16] and yet he was hidden such a
[1:34:20] way that it just missed
[1:34:26] it and and you know one of the things
[1:34:30] that we're counseled to have in our day
[1:34:34] is ISA
[1:34:36] amen that we might
[1:34:39] see that our our actions are not
[1:34:43] blinded with
[1:34:46] greed that we're not caught up into
[1:34:48] systems and the things that
[1:34:52] that making money is is not what's the
[1:34:55] measure of
[1:34:59] success and it's
[1:35:01] history he hides
[1:35:04] himself there he was
[1:35:06] hid grew up right in the midst of
[1:35:10] them oh I I dream of it many times at
[1:35:14] night being a friend of the boy
[1:35:17] Jesus amen what did my some men like to
[1:35:21] have been his friend I don't know if
[1:35:23] they played marbles or what they did or
[1:35:26] rolled stones but I would have liked to
[1:35:29] B this
[1:35:30] friend he was different he was
[1:35:33] odd but he was
[1:35:39] special he said I call you friends are
[1:35:43] you a friend today de him we don't want
[1:35:47] to miss
[1:35:49] him he's here in Simplicity and then he
[1:35:53] reveals himself he doesn't reveal
[1:35:56] himself in enticing
[1:35:59] words he reveals himself by speaking to
[1:36:02] your heart in things that are so
[1:36:06] simple that the educated man would look
[1:36:09] at it and say oh that brother he he he
[1:36:14] he talks like a common man he he talks
[1:36:17] like he's uneducated well I'll have you
[1:36:20] to know that I made it through 8th
[1:36:24] grade I didn't quite do high school but
[1:36:28] you know what I
[1:36:29] mean that's how educated I am don't I
[1:36:33] hope the education is never what it's
[1:36:36] all
[1:36:37] about huh Paul was real educated and you
[1:36:41] know what he had to say about it so we
[1:36:44] won't go there because I know so many of
[1:36:46] you are devoting so much time for
[1:36:48] college and and all those things but
[1:36:50] don't let
[1:36:52] College have you
[1:36:55] miss I'd rather have a degree in
[1:37:00] Rapture a doctorate in the Rapture
[1:37:03] that's what I want my Doctrine to be my
[1:37:06] decree to be what's your degree well I
[1:37:08] don't know I don't know much about
[1:37:10] science but I know a whole lot about the
[1:37:13] Rapture amen I
[1:37:15] got so what are you then what what's
[1:37:17] your well I guess if it comes to the
[1:37:19] Rapture I'm a rocket SCI scientist cuz
[1:37:22] I'm going to blast right on out of here
[1:37:24] I'm going to have a pressurized suit
[1:37:26] that'll take me right past the Sun and
[1:37:29] so is a marvelous thing amen so I I I
[1:37:34] just want to
[1:37:36] uh share this with you this
[1:37:40] morning I hope the Simplicity of it
[1:37:44] isn't offensive and and that you won't
[1:37:47] sit back and think well you know I
[1:37:50] really like deeper
[1:37:53] things well the only thing I know that's
[1:37:56] deep is a six- foot
[1:38:01] grave so when you start talking about
[1:38:04] deep you know what I mean deep I I
[1:38:07] remember the prophet God one he said I'm
[1:38:09] going to say something to you that's
[1:38:10] real deep now and I kept looking at it
[1:38:13] and looking at it and I and it was so
[1:38:16] simple it it was it was just so basic in
[1:38:20] everything but it was so
[1:38:22] hid till he gives you isav that you
[1:38:26] might
[1:38:29] see and and that why we want to pray for
[1:38:33] isab I pray for isab that thou may see
[1:38:37] pray for white rment that the N your
[1:38:39] nakedness doesn't uh uh
[1:38:42] appear you know pray for gold tried in
[1:38:46] fire you know the these are the things
[1:38:49] that that we should be pressing for in
[1:38:52] in order to be prepared to make that
[1:38:56] transition from this Dimension to that
[1:39:00] Dimension because you're not we can't
[1:39:02] get through there in the condition that
[1:39:05] we're in our prophet of God told us he
[1:39:08] said the church will not meet the
[1:39:10] challenge of the hour they will not make
[1:39:13] it in the condition that they're in and
[1:39:16] so his message begin to come out for the
[1:39:19] purpose of getting
[1:39:21] us
[1:39:24] ready it wasn't trying to create a new
[1:39:28] theology that we could sit around as
[1:39:31] theologians and
[1:39:34] study
[1:39:36] so this this is burning in my
[1:39:41] heart because there's so much
[1:39:45] pull and every time I see things pull it
[1:39:49] always pulls away from the absolute
[1:39:53] Simplicity of the message of the hour
[1:39:56] and it it's it's a always a continual
[1:40:01] diminishing of the importance of the
[1:40:04] messenger right that's
[1:40:07] exactly amen so we talked a little bit I
[1:40:12] I I think it maybe it was uh last Sunday
[1:40:16] evening I believe it
[1:40:19] was about the the secret
[1:40:23] Gardener and we talked a little bit
[1:40:26] about how that we know God planted a
[1:40:29] seed and we know that we're the
[1:40:33] Earth right we're the ground that that
[1:40:36] seed was planted in and he he Gardens
[1:40:41] that seed we don't see it he's a secret
[1:40:45] Gardener we don't see him working in our
[1:40:48] lives but ever since you were a little
[1:40:51] child he he he governed and worked on
[1:40:55] your life and he he cultivated it and he
[1:40:58] surrounded it uh every situation in your
[1:41:02] circumstance he he was lording over it
[1:41:06] if I could say at that he was the
[1:41:08] gardener over it he was watching over
[1:41:11] your life and and and and taking your
[1:41:14] life and and watching you
[1:41:19] grow can you didn't even know he was
[1:41:22] there he was keeping things in out of
[1:41:25] your life he was trying to deal with
[1:41:27] your heart he was allowing you to get in
[1:41:30] circumstances that he got you out of he
[1:41:34] he you know he permitted you to do these
[1:41:37] things he permitted you to do different
[1:41:39] things but he was still in charge of
[1:41:42] your care that's right and and he's
[1:41:45] always been in charge of your care he's
[1:41:48] never left you nor forsake you and in
[1:41:51] fact it's he even put from your great
[1:41:53] great grandparents he put you together
[1:41:56] and together and together and brought
[1:41:59] you to where that you are
[1:42:02] now you say say well I was born well you
[1:42:05] know I look at my parents and I think
[1:42:07] well why didn't I get believing
[1:42:10] parents he
[1:42:12] knew I might be the Redemption of my
[1:42:17] parents you know I mean why did why did
[1:42:19] my you know my parents didn't but you
[1:42:22] might someone might ask my father's gone
[1:42:24] on now my mother's 101 years old you
[1:42:27] might ask some I say well why did my
[1:42:29] parents get divorced why did this happen
[1:42:31] why did that happen you know none of
[1:42:33] that affected you because you had a
[1:42:35] secret Gardener
[1:42:37] right he knew how to separate things out
[1:42:40] of your life he knew how to keep effects
[1:42:43] of things off of you all the time you
[1:42:46] were in the palm of his hand and nothing
[1:42:48] could pluck you out he if he started a
[1:42:51] work he will finish it he will Garden it
[1:42:55] till its
[1:42:57] end and so questions come up he allows
[1:43:01] those questions to come up he allowed
[1:43:03] you to feel drifted he would allowed to
[1:43:06] have you feel empty he allowed to have
[1:43:09] you feel displaced
[1:43:12] unassociated I know that feeling well I
[1:43:15] just feel like I'm not associated with
[1:43:17] nothing I don't have any contact I I
[1:43:20] just seems like I'm
[1:43:22] floating and and I I need something to
[1:43:25] Anchor to something something to give me
[1:43:28] you know and I mean and then the secret
[1:43:30] Gardener will come by and he'll feed my
[1:43:35] soul sometimes he digs us up and he
[1:43:40] Roots it and so we we wanted to let it
[1:43:45] place in our heart that he has not left
[1:43:49] us he he here by his promised
[1:43:53] word and he's
[1:43:56] governing the hearts and lives of men he
[1:44:00] didn't sit back and cross his arms and
[1:44:03] hope that you make it through the Maze
[1:44:05] of life you know what I mean and like a
[1:44:09] little mouse in a maze that maybe you
[1:44:12] learn your way and you finally come out
[1:44:15] the other side and breathe a sigh of
[1:44:17] relief and say I made it
[1:44:21] no when you reach the dead end he
[1:44:23] reached down and opened the
[1:44:26] door then he let you go on and then he
[1:44:30] but all the time he was he was The
[1:44:35] Gardener of your life I like to use
[1:44:39] another
[1:44:40] analogy this
[1:44:43] morning
[1:44:44] to cause our
[1:44:48] hearts to look inward
[1:44:51] to our
[1:44:54] condition to make contact with our
[1:44:57] inward
[1:44:58] man and to
[1:45:01] become more
[1:45:04] focused and have a greater sense of
[1:45:07] reality to the spirit being that we are
[1:45:13] this flesh you have not not a whole lot
[1:45:16] of choice of what happens to it people
[1:45:20] do
[1:45:21] everything they can I I hate to tell
[1:45:24] everybody but even Jack Elaine passed
[1:45:29] away that went over most of your heads
[1:45:35] too anybody know who jackan was all
[1:45:39] right you're all over
[1:45:45] 40 now everybody wants to know who
[1:45:47] jackeline

[1:45:52] expert diet guy back in the 50s and 60s
[1:45:57] and early 70s that was going to live
[1:46:05] forever I'd like to just take this
[1:46:08] little
[1:46:09] thought a thought
[1:46:11] that is given for the
[1:46:14] purpose of you reflecting
[1:46:18] inside and making contact with your
[1:46:21] inner
[1:46:24] man leaving the Battle of your
[1:46:27] mind and making contact with the part of
[1:46:32] you that's
[1:46:35] leaving we are not preaching a staying
[1:46:39] message we are preaching a leaving
[1:46:41] message let me say that again the desire
[1:46:46] in my heart is that you make contact
[1:46:49] with the the part of you that's
[1:46:54] leaving this man is
[1:46:58] staying this inward Man is leaving I
[1:47:03] want to know and make contact with the
[1:47:07] Inner Man and what it is that my inner
[1:47:11] man has got to
[1:47:14] become in order to step out of this
[1:47:19] Frame
[1:47:21] or prison or pest house that I'm in I've
[1:47:26] got to be able to have something within
[1:47:28] me that's so built up so strong so Under
[1:47:33] the Influence so in contact with this
[1:47:36] other dimension that it's such a reality
[1:47:39] to me that I can come from this side of
[1:47:42] it to that other side of it and am
[1:47:46] willing to leave this behind
[1:47:52] amen as handsome as he is I want to step
[1:47:57] out I should have had more
[1:48:00] amens I you you you should be able to
[1:48:03] step out from it right and leave it
[1:48:07] behind and you've got to be ready for
[1:48:09] that hour is coming and it's a choice
[1:48:13] that you're going to be faced with
[1:48:15] that's right
[1:48:16] amen so I'd like to call this thought
[1:48:19] the puzzle
[1:48:22] that is
[1:48:25] you the puzzle that is you or the puzzle
[1:48:30] that you
[1:48:33] are the
[1:48:38] puzzle
[1:48:42] the so many of our lives are
[1:48:47] puzzling it's a puzzle
[1:48:50] and you understand a puzzle a puzzle is
[1:48:54] just made out of so many
[1:48:57] pieces so many if you get a puzzle box
[1:49:01] and you you look at it and and uh uh I
[1:49:07] have friends that are puzzle
[1:49:09] people
[1:49:11] and I think they're a little
[1:49:14] overboard but they'll get a puzzle and
[1:49:16] they won't look at the
[1:49:18] picture and they'll pour it out and
[1:49:22] they'll start to put the
[1:49:24] puzzle
[1:49:26] together and I thought why do you do
[1:49:29] that you don't know what you're working
[1:49:31] for you don't know what you'll
[1:49:34] get I like to see the
[1:49:38] picture and in the puzzle that we are
[1:49:42] the picture
[1:49:44] that that we see is the picture
[1:49:50] is the word of
[1:49:53] God which we know is Jesus Christ in the
[1:49:57] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:49:59] God many times we say Jesus Christ we
[1:50:02] think of the man that walked the Seas of
[1:50:05] Galilee we only have images of him uh
[1:50:09] this is the image that we kind of heard
[1:50:12] that may be the closest from those that
[1:50:15] have seen
[1:50:17] him but but that is kind of in an
[1:50:21] abstract uh form the best that we have
[1:50:24] we knew he was a man he was a man of
[1:50:26] like passion we knew he had shoulder
[1:50:29] length hair we knew he dressed and was a
[1:50:31] commonl looking man the only thing that
[1:50:34] separated him from anybody else was his
[1:50:37] words and his deeds in other words you
[1:50:40] wouldn't know who he was until he spoke
[1:50:43] and then when he spoke there was no man
[1:50:46] that spoke like him amen and when when
[1:50:50] he did things they stood back and said
[1:50:52] no man could do these things unless God
[1:50:55] be with them really and all in all he
[1:50:58] was no different than
[1:51:00] you that's
[1:51:03] right he came in the form of sin which
[1:51:06] you
[1:51:07] are he was no different than you are he
[1:51:11] just came forth he was there he was born
[1:51:14] he was raised up he learned obedience
[1:51:17] but and he suffered things he went
[1:51:19] through life like we went but there was
[1:51:22] a time that the time come that the
[1:51:25] spirit of God moved on him and and he he
[1:51:28] went out to fast and
[1:51:32] pray then he come down to the
[1:51:35] river and he was
[1:51:37] baptized he went to a marriage
[1:51:41] feast and his ministry started oh
[1:51:44] wouldn't that be a beautiful sermon type
[1:51:48] amen bringing new on wine wine that was
[1:51:51] never tasted before Oh word of God is
[1:51:56] wonderfully Rich isn't
[1:51:59] it and and so we we have the picture so
[1:52:04] we have the picture uh it was given to
[1:52:07] us in in in the word of God or if I
[1:52:12] could say that the message of the hour
[1:52:15] is the puzzle of our day it's the
[1:52:19] picture of our day it's it it's what
[1:52:23] laid there that we we are supposed to
[1:52:30] be and so it's put there but it's not
[1:52:36] assembled there's assembly
[1:52:40] required if I ever shop that's the first
[1:52:43] thing I look for does it say assembly
[1:52:46] needs to be
[1:52:48] required and then I make a couple phone
[1:52:51] calls to some brother say are you doing
[1:52:53] anything I'm busy are you doing anything
[1:52:56] you I get all these excuses and then I
[1:52:59] just don't buy
[1:53:01] it but I don't got no choice here
[1:53:05] assemblies required he showed you the
[1:53:09] picture and you are the
[1:53:13] puzzle you're the puzzle Hallelujah the
[1:53:17] puzzle that you are you're filled with
[1:53:20] all these
[1:53:22] parts and all these pictures and you're
[1:53:24] supposed to come from what you
[1:53:27] are which is a big
[1:53:30] scrambled bunch of pieces to what his
[1:53:34] picture of you
[1:53:37] is what he foreordained you to be but
[1:53:42] you you got that it's it it's placed
[1:53:46] that way so your Lively Stones your
[1:53:49] Lively pieces but you're fitted and
[1:53:51] joined together built into his building
[1:53:56] or his
[1:53:57] Tabernacle we could talk about Statue of
[1:54:00] the perfect man add this piece add that
[1:54:03] piece until you come into the statue or
[1:54:06] the picture of the a statue of a perfect
[1:54:09] man so okay if I could get you to
[1:54:12] understand this is that you didn't come
[1:54:14] put together you came with all the
[1:54:18] pieces in you
[1:54:24] and you have to work that
[1:54:28] out you've got you've got to to to start
[1:54:34] putting the picture together and so we
[1:54:38] we have the picture and now so what are
[1:54:42] the
[1:54:43] pieces the pieces are given to
[1:54:47] us but they're they're not great big
[1:54:51] pieces they're little pieces they're
[1:54:54] they're
[1:54:57] sermons and
[1:55:00] Revelations are are giving you the Lord
[1:55:02] little things that he speaks to your
[1:55:05] heart that he speaks to your mind that
[1:55:08] he reveals to you that that he opens up

[1:55:18] puzzle little things he shows you things

[1:55:24] shows you have and so we have laying
[1:55:27] before us all these great pictures and
[1:55:30] all these great pieces of of the the
[1:55:34] puzzle are all there but there comes a
[1:55:37] time when those pieces of the puzzle
[1:55:41] have got to be put
[1:55:46] together and it's a time now that you've
[1:55:49] got got the start I have got the start
[1:55:51] we have got the start of assembling the
[1:55:55] puzzle that this message was the pieces
[1:55:58] of this puzzle and putting them together
[1:56:01] and making a true living bride of Jesus
[1:56:08] Christ
[1:56:11] fitted and joined together
[1:56:17] amen taking this revelation you have you
[1:56:20] you've got this pieace and if this piece
[1:56:23] doesn't fit into the puzzle of your
[1:56:27] life you don't get out the
[1:56:31] scissors you start to understand this
[1:56:34] piece doesn't fit this
[1:56:40] puzzle I can't fit this
[1:56:43] in this don't work this doesn't create
[1:56:46] the picture that was given me

[1:56:59] questions the pieces of your life that
[1:57:02] God brings and reveals to you through

[1:57:16] to reveal to you the pieace of the
[1:57:19] puzzle that is in you so you are a
[1:57:23] puzzle within yourself and you are a
[1:57:26] part of a greater
[1:57:32] puzzle do you believe
[1:57:38] that when you get one piece in
[1:57:42] place that's a glorious thing and you
[1:57:46] can rejoice in that to a season but
[1:57:49] pretty soon you've got to move
[1:57:51] on so there's got to be there's got to
[1:57:54] be a a a a place that that all these

[1:58:06] Revelations that we have the truths that
[1:58:10] he's opened up to us the the dealings
[1:58:13] with our heart there comes a time when
[1:58:15] this puzzle has got to come together in
[1:58:19] form into that being that that we
[1:58:27] are yes we can't just leave the pieces
[1:58:30] of the puzzle laying everywhere there's
[1:58:32] got to come the time we start putting
[1:58:34] this puzzle
[1:58:37] together and we kind of we could look at
[1:58:39] it you know how it is when you build a
[1:58:44] puzzle there's certain pieces that have
[1:58:46] one thing in
[1:58:48] common
[1:58:50] the flat
[1:58:53] Edge that's right right so you you get
[1:58:56] the flat Edge out you get the you build
[1:58:59] the
[1:59:01] border right so now you know that the
[1:59:06] framework of the pieces is going to come
[1:59:11] together within this
[1:59:16] framework so there's a frame that's got
[1:59:19] to be buil so and just in my analogy
[1:59:23] just
[1:59:25] to just to create some inner
[1:59:30] connection I'm I'm I don't want to talk
[1:59:32] to your minds I want to talk to your
[1:59:35] hearts but that frame of that puzzle are
[1:59:39] the frame is built out of if I could say
[1:59:42] they
[1:59:43] pieces and
[1:59:45] piece a greater than Solomon is
[1:59:50] here you start you start seeing the
[1:59:54] frame come together you got you start
[1:59:57] seeing the picture is within the
[2:00:00] framework of this great revelation of
[2:00:03] the hour you know you you you start to
[2:00:07] see these things as it was in the days
[2:00:11] of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[2:00:15] the son of man when the mighty Angel
[2:00:17] descends and puts his foot on the land
[2:00:20] and the Sea you start to see this Frame
[2:00:22] come together you start to say there's a
[2:00:25] picture that comes forth in the midst of
[2:00:28] the frame of this message I'm I'm part
[2:00:32] of that
[2:00:35] picture I'm a piece of that puzzle and
[2:00:38] then you look at yourself and you say
[2:00:41] I'm a many mixed
[2:00:44] up bunch of
[2:00:48] pieces and so now he's going to have to
[2:00:50] you got have to identify those pieces
[2:00:53] well he's the one putting the puzzle
[2:00:58] together he's the one that's
[2:01:01] assembling the puzzle of your life and
[2:01:05] the many different pieces that you have
[2:01:09] emotions and different things that you
[2:01:11] have that are all spread out he starts
[2:01:14] to take those pieces and identify them
[2:01:17] to you that you can place them where
[2:01:20] they
[2:01:24] belong the question is when we going to
[2:01:27] build the
[2:01:32] puzzle I know puzzle Builders they they
[2:01:35] go by and they take all the colors and
[2:01:38] they stack every color together and they
[2:01:41] they start they start separating it out
[2:01:43] they start putting it there but one
[2:01:47] day in order to
[2:01:50] achieve the
[2:01:52] picture or the goal they've got to come
[2:01:58] together having a
[2:02:01] puzzle doesn't make the
[2:02:05] picture you've got to assemble it so he
[2:02:09] begins and and and you
[2:02:12] you so that I don't take much longer but
[2:02:15] you you've got to recognize what's going
[2:02:18] on
[2:02:21] on you've got to know that the sermons
[2:02:24] that that were that were preached by our
[2:02:28] messenger were to identify to you the
[2:02:33] pieces of the puzzle that's in you the
[2:02:37] puzzle you are the things that you're
[2:02:40] missing the things that aren't you
[2:02:42] aren't thinking right the holy spirit is
[2:02:45] to lead you and to guide you into all
[2:02:48] truth and righteousness it's to speak to
[2:02:51] your hearts it's to open the word of God
[2:02:53] to you it's to reveal the word of God to
[2:02:56] you open the things of God to you that
[2:02:58] you can start to see
[2:03:03] right you can't you can't sit back you
[2:03:07] know sometimes you you just can't be a
[2:03:09] coward all your life you got to step up
[2:03:12] and say I got to put this thing in my
[2:03:15] life regardless because how it affect
[2:03:19] anybody if this isn't in my life I'll
[2:03:23] never get the picture
[2:03:26] finished
[2:03:28] amen and he's coming for a complete
[2:03:34] statue something that's real something
[2:03:37] that's put together so you hear sermons
[2:03:39] like why Christ
[2:03:44] speak well there's a revelation in that
[2:03:46] message that's right
[2:03:49] there's something in that sermon that is
[2:03:52] a piece of your puzzle it's
[2:03:56] not a library piece or a study message
[2:04:02] it's not a sermon
[2:04:04] source and I'm afraid the message has
[2:04:07] become nothing but a sermon source to
[2:04:11] too many
[2:04:14] people and it's not dealing with where
[2:04:16] we're at it's not dealing with where
[2:04:19] we're going it's become crowd
[2:04:23] pleasing we don't need no more
[2:04:26] Vindication this message has been
[2:04:28] Vindicated it's time we take the
[2:04:30] revelation of this message and start
[2:04:32] putting the puzzle
[2:04:36] together put it together in our lives
[2:04:40] not the puzzle that somebody else is the
[2:04:43] puzzle that I
[2:04:46] am if I could get my puzzle put together
[2:04:50] then it could be put in the greater
[2:04:53] puzzle and we'll leave
[2:04:56] here that's
[2:04:59] right one place the prophet of God said
[2:05:02] take
[2:05:05] cannabis how quick would you KN
[2:05:08] move if you knew that was an
[2:05:14] absolute the first 10 people that get
[2:05:18] their person person Al puzzle put
[2:05:20] together will finish the puzzle of the
[2:05:23] ages and we'll be
[2:05:29] gone I know it would happen in my life
[2:05:31] there would be a lot of token
[2:05:36] applying does this fit does this fit
[2:05:38] does this fit does this add to my
[2:05:42] character no we got to understand that
[2:05:45] what has been going on the M he comes
[2:05:48] preach sermons like perfect
[2:05:53] Faith he's trying to reveal to you in
[2:05:57] that sermon that sermon needs to be
[2:05:59] taken personally by you you need to
[2:06:01] start going to the the the the
[2:06:05] revealer of the
[2:06:10] pieces you don't want me to put a puzzle
[2:06:12] together for
[2:06:15] you you know that we all think of
[2:06:21] ourselves really the scripture says more
[2:06:24] highly than we ought to
[2:06:27] am but if I was to draw my picture of a
[2:06:30] Christian I would draw
[2:06:34] myself with a little
[2:06:39] Halo and my little praying
[2:06:46] hands but that's
[2:06:49] that not going to match right he already
[2:06:53] has the picture it's his word that's
[2:06:55] right he already has an image of you yes
[2:07:00] what you are what he for ordained you to
[2:07:04] be but he just didn't give it to you the
[2:07:07] image and say here you are he gave you a
[2:07:10] bunch of scattered up pieces of the
[2:07:12] puzzle inside of your heart and your
[2:07:16] soul and now through the preaching of
[2:07:19] the word of God the foolishness of
[2:07:21] preaching and the message of the hour he
[2:07:24] starts identifying those little pieces
[2:07:26] of the puzzle in
[2:07:29] you and you start to see yourself come
[2:07:34] together and then there comes a time
[2:07:36] where you've got to take all these
[2:07:38] pieces and you've identified them this
[2:07:40] is the truth this is the word this is
[2:07:42] the truth I have this brother bam taught
[2:07:44] this brother bam taught that brother bam
[2:07:46] taught this we we believe this we
[2:07:48] believe that we got all these great
[2:07:50] pieces of this puzzle but
[2:07:53] someday those have got to form into an
[2:07:58] image the puzzles got to be put
[2:08:03] together and become a
[2:08:06] reality and that's what he's done he's
[2:08:09] given us the
[2:08:10] pieces works his faith expressed wisdom
[2:08:14] versus Faith oh I could just go down and
[2:08:17] start reading sermon title after sermon
[2:08:20] title but when you understand every
[2:08:23] single one of those
[2:08:26] sermons was
[2:08:28] given to
[2:08:30] reveal a
[2:08:32] piece of the
[2:08:34] puzzle you
[2:08:39] are there might be 10 pieces in one
[2:08:44] sermon and he reveals them to you one
[2:08:47] piece at a time time one piece at a time
[2:08:51] one Revelation at a time what does it do
[2:08:54] it takes the
[2:08:56] Revelation to build the
[2:09:01] puzzle he's given you you have it in
[2:09:05] you who you are is in you the picture is
[2:09:11] in
[2:09:14] you but we we we look for a completed
[2:09:17] picture when we
[2:09:18] we need to start to understand it's not
[2:09:21] a completed picture it's a puzzle pieces
[2:09:25] right that he's Lively Stones things
[2:09:29] that come to life and then you've got to
[2:09:32] put that together and put this with this
[2:09:35] add to your faith
[2:09:37] virtue patience virtue Temperance Adam
[2:09:42] build them put the building together fit
[2:09:45] it in joined what does he have to do
[2:09:47] he's got to fit you and join you with
[2:09:50] other
[2:09:51] believers cuz that's part of the puzzle
[2:09:54] is your ability to fit and it join he'll
[2:09:59] give you sermons knoweth it
[2:10:01] not humble thyself all these are
[2:10:05] Revelations all these are are are
[2:10:09] Mysteries all these are the secrets of
[2:10:11] your heart to being
[2:10:14] discerned so that you can come aware of
[2:10:17] a piece of the puzzle that you need to
[2:10:20] put in the
[2:10:23] picture add this to your
[2:10:25] life he shows you something this don't
[2:10:29] fit out and the puzzle begins to come
[2:10:32] together and the puzzle that you
[2:10:36] are begins to take
[2:10:40] form and then it can be added to the
[2:10:44] greater
[2:10:47] puzzle but it's got to come together
[2:10:51] it's got to be
[2:10:53] completed you can't get in on mommy's
[2:10:56] coattails you can't get in on Daddy's
[2:10:59] coattails you can't get on the
[2:11:01] preacher's coattails the this church
[2:11:03] isn't
[2:11:04] going it's not going as a
[2:11:08] body we hope there's individuals in here
[2:11:13] that are going there may be three kinds
[2:11:15] of Believers in here
[2:11:19] there may be make
[2:11:24] believer we don't know you
[2:11:28] know you know by how the word is
[2:11:32] identifying the pieces of your life and
[2:11:36] you've got you ask yourself am I letting
[2:11:38] this word of God identify the pieces of
[2:11:41] the puzzle in me and I am putting them
[2:11:45] together and building and
[2:11:49] forming and having a union an invisible
[2:11:54] Union between the bride the Earthly
[2:11:57] bride and the Heavenly bridegroom it is
[2:12:01] my
[2:12:02] picture coming together and there's
[2:12:05] things in our lives that are puzzling
[2:12:08] why does this happen why does that
[2:12:10] happen you
[2:12:13] know God God's got everything so in
[2:12:16] control yes
[2:12:20] you know that's why
[2:12:22] prayer is such a wonderful
[2:12:25] thing we know he knows has need of what
[2:12:30] we have need of before we ask you know
[2:12:33] why you prayer so he can show you he
[2:12:36] answers your
[2:12:38] prayer it gives him an a an Avenue to
[2:12:42] let you know that he's
[2:12:45] real okay it takes it it's a way weapon
[2:12:48] against Satan so when you pray and ask
[2:12:51] for something and God gives it to you
[2:12:53] Satan can't say oh that's circumstance
[2:12:56] that's happening oh that would have
[2:12:57] happened no you say wait a minute Satan
[2:12:59] I prayed he answered he
[2:13:05] lives and when you start to see the
[2:13:07] puzzles come together you go
[2:13:10] years and all of a sudden Pieces come
[2:13:14] together and when you get one piece it's
[2:13:16] like a magic piece
[2:13:18] everything's just you go slam slam slam
[2:13:20] slam slam and you a whole bunch of stuff
[2:13:23] just comes together at once you're
[2:13:25] forming you're
[2:13:28] growing the scripture said we're
[2:13:32] growing that we might grow take the
[2:13:36] sincere milk of the word that we might
[2:13:41] grow growing is the putting together of
[2:13:45] the pieces in your life and sometimes at
[2:13:48] the
[2:13:51] end the puzzle gets more
[2:13:56] difficult but his grace is
[2:13:59] greater because he who is in you is
[2:14:04] greater than he who is in the
[2:14:08] world and we can begin to find this
[2:14:14] morning that God's message
[2:14:20] is pieces of a puzzle that is already
[2:14:24] you the puzzle that you
[2:14:26] are he's trying to find
[2:14:30] identify and bring those pieces together
[2:14:34] so that you can rise up in the Statue of
[2:14:37] a son and daughter of God and know that
[2:14:40] you've been tutored by the great puzzle
[2:14:43] Builder himself and that he has put he
[2:14:47] has put you you together and assembled
[2:14:50] you according to his
[2:14:53] word and because he

[2:15:05] fiery darts of the
[2:15:11] enemy fear not little flock it's the
[2:15:15] father's good pleasure to give give you
[2:15:18] the
[2:15:19] kingdom sometimes he just gives it to
[2:15:21] you a piece at a time but if you'll
[2:15:25] build the puzzle if you'll put those
[2:15:28] pieces in your
[2:15:31] life you'll let the word of God speak to
[2:15:34] your heart he'll fit you and join you

[2:16:14] Lord be hid in the framework of great
[2:16:17] simp licity this
[2:16:23] morning and may we each ask
[2:16:29] ourselves the question deep within the
[2:16:32] framework of our
[2:16:34] heart are there pieces
[2:16:39] missing in the puzzle of my
[2:16:44] life or do I feel like I'm just jumbled
[2:16:47] up with all kinds
[2:16:49] of circumstances and situations that
[2:16:52] don't make any
[2:16:54] sense may I say Lord Jesus may your word
[2:16:59] identify the pieces of my
[2:17:02] life and may your loving hand join and
[2:17:06] put them together this
[2:17:09] [Music]
[2:17:15] morning that you would
[2:17:18] form me into your
[2:17:22] image that by the preaching of the word
[2:17:24] of God we might be conformed into the
[2:17:30] image that for ordained image that you
[2:17:33] had us before the foundation of the
[2:17:36] world for Lord we ask for isav this
[2:17:40] morning that we might
[2:17:45] see then it might become evident to us
[2:17:48] that there's things that aren't
[2:17:52] right things that have to be reassembled
[2:17:55] and and I need Revelation father to put
[2:17:58] the things of my life in their right
[2:18:03] place but Lord with all my heart I
[2:18:06] believe you're putting your bride
[2:18:09] together you revealed to us the
[2:18:11] framework we know it's going to be
[2:18:13] within the framework of this
[2:18:15] message and you gave us every piece that

[2:18:25] me this
[2:18:27] morning and I ask you to give me courage
[2:18:34] father to stand for the truth and to do
[2:18:37] what's

[2:18:58] morning might be put
[2:19:02] together that I'll leave nothing outside
[2:19:05] of the
[2:19:07] framework that I'll take every piece and
[2:19:10] run the race with patience that's set
[2:19:12] before me that I can
[2:19:15] complete the task that's laid before me
