Description:
Br. Benoit Katompua
Built Upon the Foundation of The Holy Spirit
Wednesday Evening Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
August 6th, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

We certainly pray for the family that the Lord will strengthen them. Amen. I know. But, uh John is recovering from surgery and certainly want to pray for our pastor and sister Leslie. I believe I talked to him yesterday. They were already in O'Hari and they were preaching there and then they were going to fly to uh um Victoria Falls and and and there for a couple of days and then fly again. So there just a lot of travel and a lot of places to go and preach. Amen. Certainly want to continue to keep them in prayer that the Lord will protect them and and above all that the word may may just affect the people that they may receive something of the Lord and and it will change their lives. Amen. Amen. And if you have a need upon your heart, just lift your hand up to him. Amen. And I forgot there was a baby uh born today. I believe it was yesterday. Today uh let me check. Um it was uh brother Amii and uh Sister Hope. They had the healthy uh baby boy. Um certainly want to thank the Lord for that and certainly the mother and the babies are doing well and we pray that the Lord will certainly be with them. Amen. And Amen. and the baby. Amen. The brothers that are taking the offerings, if you could come as we take this needs before him. Amen. Brother Andrew, if you could just come and take this needs for the Lord church. Amen. [Music] Amen. Hasn't God been so good to you? He's certainly been good to me. And as we go to him in prayer for these needs, just remember how good he's been to you. And he's been so faithful. If we'll bind our hearts together in faith, believing, God will do the impossible. Amen. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we count it a privilege, Lord, to be able to go to your throne of grace and realize that there was a way made for us, Lord, when Lord, we didn't have no way back to you, Lord. There was one that expressed a love that won our heart. And Lord, you desired fellowship, Lord. And when we look back in our lives and see, Lord, when lost loved ones went away, you were there to comfort. And Lord, when we needed a healing touch, Lord, you provided it, Lord. And so we believe, God, that if you did it for us, Lord, that Lord, you'll do it again, Lord, because you're the same God. And father surely the loss of a loved one for brother Cus Lord and the family Lord you're the only one that can bring peace that can touch a heart Lord to settle Lord the inside. And so we prayed that you would go and that your spirit Lord would bring about the comfort and the change, Lord. And pray you'd give them revelation, Lord, beyond the circumstance, Lord. And surely if, oh God, the stripes that you bore, Lord, you didn't do it in vain. And so as believers here binding together, Lord, for those that are sick in our midst and those that have been, Lord, pleading for loved ones, Lord, we pray that those stripes would affect effectually work for those that it can bring you honor and that it can bring testimonies, Lord, to the house of God and that it would encourage our faith, Lord, to ask more, Lord, because that's what you desire through these difficulties and trials, Father. And so as we commit them to you, Lord, we just ask that Lord, as we're remembering the work of our pastor and the burden that you placed upon him, Lord, we pray that your mercy and grace would be his portion, Lord. And I pray that you'd God, strengthen him where he's weak. And Lord, give him excitement, encouragement that he's doing your will, Lord. That's what our prophet taught us, Lord, about overseas work. So we just pray that you bless Sister Leslie and help them, Lord. May they have good success. And Father, as the tithes and offerings will be collected here, Lord, pray that you'd multiply it that it can be used for your kingdom, Father. Ultimately, our desire and prayer today, Lord, is that you would quicken life to us, Lord. That you'd give us revelation by your word. So use the man of God, Lord, and may we hear, lift to ear from you today, and that it might change us, Lord. We're so desirous of it. So, we're committing ourselves to you, Lord, under expectation in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. I have a source [Music] of strength when I am weak. God thinks me through. When life is prayer, sing me. I have a source of power from above. Hallelujah. feeling. I'm covered over by the shield of blood. Oh, and I claim the blood Jesus shed on Calary. Those [Music] preious bless names [Music] were made. They just for me [Music] for all my sins, my sickness and my pain. Hallelujah. Oh, when I need healing, I claim those precious blood stains. Oh, I do not know how others make it through.

Oh, and Jesus shed on Calary. Oh, and those precious blood, they were made there just for me. For all my sins, my sickness and my pain. Oh, when I in healing I claim those preious blood name. Hallelujah. There's a fountain [Music] that is flowing from a place called Calary. Oh, and there is. Oh, there is healing in its water. Oh, and every joy and victory. Oh, and I bing the found. Oh, and there's no other place. Oh, and flowing now from Calary's mouth. Oh, and it will walk. He will wash you white as snow. Oh, the waters will be. Oh, and angels came on side as far. Oh, and by this mountain, hallelujah. [Music] Oh, and any shall Oh, and let's all stand and sing it as a red man. Oh, why there's no high. [Music] Oh, I'm flowing now. of God. Oh, and it will wash you. Sing that last verse again. Oh, and the waters will be. I just wonder what the satisfies. just chaos satisfied. Oh, and this mountain flow forever. Oh [Music] sh Oh, [Music] [Music] glory down from Calary's mountain. Oh, it will white as other waters will be bitter will be bitter.

Oh, flowing down from Calary's mountain and it will fall. [Music] Hallelujah. Let's go to him in a word of prayer. Gracious eternal father, Lord Jesus, I thank you, Lord Jesus, the way you go about things, Lord Jesus. Confirming things only the way that you can, Lord Jesus. There's something about that fountain, Lord Jesus. Lord Billy couldn't have known what you were dealing with me with, Lord Jesus. There's something about that fountain, Lord Jesus. What it gives the believer, Lord Jesus. What it does to the sinner, Lord Jesus. You can come in there with all the scars, all the hurt, the pain, all that this world could give you. Satan scratching at you, fighting at you. But one dip in that water, it'll change you forever, Lord Jesus. Father, what we need more in this hour, Lord Jesus, get back to the fountain, Lord Jesus. Oh, Father, if you hadn't shed your blood at Calvary, Lord, where would we be, Father? Some of us working our way to hell, Lord Jesus, fighting to tanel. But because of that blood, Lord Jesus, it reached down where we were, Father, and it pulled us out of that condition, Lord Jesus. We can be thankful, Lord Jesus, for that blood, Lord Jesus. It doesn't miss, Father. It's not happen chance. It's not a mistake, but it's all for the elected, Lord Jesus. Oh, we thank you to be gathered amongst the elect, Lord Jesus, that have been purchased by your blood, Lord Jesus. Your prophet said, "If you have your day at Calvary, God will have his way with you." We just want to come before you now, Lord Jesus. Put me aside, Father. Speak something to your people, Lord Jesus. Minister to the hearts, Father. If it's just one soul, Father, it was worth the trip, Lord Jesus. But father, your spirit knows what every single one of your children has need of in this house. Lord, you can say something to them, Lord. Maybe if it's encouraging, Lord Jesus, something to bless that they can go back and say, "It was good to be in the house of the Lord. Calm my nerves, Lord Jesus. Have your way in the service, Father. Be with our pastor, Lord Jesus, and Sister Leslie. want to continue to remember and pray for them, Lord Jesus. Give them strength, Lord Jesus, and bring them both back to us safely. Father, we ask this in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you, saints. Let's just turn as we're standing to Romans chapter 6. Thank you, musicians. You know, I was going to say I'm going to I'm going to try not to be long. I really don't know what's going to happen. But I have my timer. So once it hits 45, I'm going to do what Billy does best and just walk that way. Let's read Romans uh chapter 8 verse 6 to10. It reads, "For to be carnally minded," let's jump up to five. And this this is titled conflict of the spirit with the flesh, right? And before we read this, I want to point out something here. It's not talking about your first nature. This is conflict with the spirit and the flesh. We know that you had to have a new birth. It wasn't that the flesh was reborn, but something on the inside had to be reborn. So as we read this, let's keep that in mind. There's a conflict between the spirit, what is the spirit? For they that are of the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is at enmity against God. For it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. We could close the Bible there and close service. Your flesh cannot and will never be minding the things of God. It's impossible for your flesh to do so. But that spirit on the inside was called for this. He says, "So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God." And then we'll turn one more to 1 Corinthians chapter 3. We'll read in verse 10- 16. This is uh Paul speaking, "A carnal state prevents spiritual growth." This is when he's speaking to the church of the of Corinthians talking about I've given you milk and all these different things and because you're carnally minded you're not able to grow. And he makes this statement in verse 10. According to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation and another buildeth there on. But let every man take heed how he buildth thereupon. For other foundations can man lay, for other foundations can no man lay than that that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, every man's work shall be made manifest. For the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire, and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. If any man work abide with which he had built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss. But he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire. Know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you. A gracious heavenly father, we want to ask a blessing on the reading of your word. You may be seated. I've been uh pondering a thought. All all all you can really do as a human is look inward. because if you look outward, you won't find nothing you like. So, you got to look on the inside. And the thought came to my mind, I guess, it's a title, but I don't know the the way the Lord was was was was dealing with me, it's like I was pulled in a lot of different directions, but I'm going to just try to stay in the channel I feel in my heart. If I were to give this a title, it'd be built upon the foundation of the Holy Spirit. And for a subtitle, I'd call it the indwelling spirit. Now, we we know the prophet of God speaks about an indwelling spirit. Speaks about having the person of Jesus Christ living on the inside. It's it's different from feeling the effects of the spirit. This is something that happens on the inside. It's a change, right? Brother Brandham says just to to lay a foundation before the foundation. He says an expectation. Now then we're going to use the expectation. Usually you get what you expect to come to church tonight just saying I'm going over there. I'm going over there to find something that I know that's wrong. Don't worry. The devil will show you plenty of it. &gt;&gt; That's right. You usually get what you expect. If you come expecting to get a blessing from God, God will see that you get it. &gt;&gt; What you expect, you say, "Well, I don't expect it to be." Well, that's the reason it isn't. &gt;&gt; You've got to believe it. &gt;&gt; And you believe it to be right. Look at the right things. Examine it right. &gt;&gt; This is a prophet's advice to us sons and daughters of God, that we have to come into the house of the Lord expecting something, &gt;&gt; right? We don't just come because it's a Wednesday. We don't just come because it's a Sunday, but there's something that he's doing here. And I I I begin to look within myself and I'm like, man, you know, you you start counting all the services you probably attend since you were born. And you start tracking and saying, man, I've been to over 200 some services. You you wouldn't be able to fathom how many services you've been to. You know what remains common? No matter how seasoned you've been in this message, no matter how long you've been, it doesn't matter. What remains common is this flesh is still your enemy. Nothing changes. From the first from the person that just came to Christ to the one that's been here years, don't don't get it misconred or misunderstood. Everybody still fights. Everybody still struggles. Your flesh is still a problem. It doesn't matter who you are, what office you hold. Our prophet was inspired from struggles. He was inspired from what you would call falling or fails. And he showed it to you. So it got it got me thinking. I was like, man, let me just look at my life. We live in the comm in I guess you'd call the message community or message society where the biggest thing is identifying the spirit in you in spite of your failures, in spite of everything else. Trying to see how is it could God be in me? and and and you you every time you fall, you you question, man, is God really living on the inside. Is has he really done a work in me? Am I really saved like I say I'm saved? You know, I have this desire in my heart. I want these things, but I I I can't seem to live up to the desire that I have on my heart. And you start to have this struggle, right? And it it it struck me when as brother Matthew was preaching and brother Billy was preaching, a statement both of them alluded to is God didn't save you one day so then you could be unsaved the next day. It's it's as long as you're questioning what's inside you, you can't do the greater works. It's physically impossible because how can you tell somebody of the greater work which is the salvation of Christ if you yourself doubt every moment of the day the salvation he gave you? See, and the problem that happens is we start to misidentify what salvation is. But as we read here, I don't know if you if you read it the way that I read it, my Bible told me that I couldn't please him in the flesh. &gt;&gt; It's impossible. Yet what I found within myself is my greatest deception to myself is my own efforts. &gt;&gt; What I'm able to do, what I'm able to comprehend, what I'm able to muster up my program of salvation, &gt;&gt; it it doesn't matter. Oh, but you know, I'm I'm Holy Ghost fil that. You still have this flesh &gt;&gt; that every time you fall, it's like, you know, I'm going to wallow in my sin for a little bit and then I'm going to do works of penance. You said, but I'm not Catholic. But you still act like it. I'm going to do works of penance so that I can feel that I've done enough. Now the Lord's forgiven my sin because I've worked. I've done this. But David said he needed help at the church. Real men. I was there. Therefore, I'm good. Just trying to muster up something to identify yourself as having covered the sin by works. &gt;&gt; But if there was anything you could do for your salvation, Christ died in vain. We've all heard him. We've heard him say that. I got I got to look and all you can really do is look at yourself. I was born in the message. Being born in the message is very different from coming from the world. If you come from the world, you have almost a line that you could look at and say, "All my affections and everything that I knew was of the world." And then all of a sudden something happened and now all my affections, everything that I desire is of the Lord. But if you're born in the message, I want to be careful with how I say this. It's it's a different kind of struggle. For you to see that line takes a little bit more effort because you believe the message legalistically. See, I knew the message was real. I was born in it. There was never a moment in my life or time where I doubted the message at all. I knew it was the truth. And there were certain things that I didn't do because I knew mom and dad said the message is this. This is the message. I knew what the message said. So I didn't partake in certain things. But that's not salvation. &gt;&gt; That's my own righteousness. That's me looking at the law and saying because this brother Brandon would say that the greatest mistake Israel made I believe was Exodus chapter uh was that 19 I believe 19 when they said when the law was given to them and they spoke back and said all these things that you said we will do. How foolish. All these things we will do. With what strength? &gt;&gt; With what ability? This man longs for nothing but the things of this world. &gt;&gt; It doesn't get satisfied by the things of God. The sensations you feel in this flesh because of the world far outweighs anything you'd feel in this flesh by the spirit. &gt;&gt; But the thing on the inside that God placed in each and every single one of you speaks so much more louder than anything this flesh can attach to. I got to just got to thinking with myself, man. You know, born in the message. Here I am. I know the law. I know what because if you're if you're born in the message, you haven't gone to the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Everything is just legalism. &gt;&gt; I don't wear skirts because mom says no. I don't wear shorts because dad says no. &gt;&gt; I don't do this. I don't do that. It's just a bunch of dos and don'ts. So then you get this feeling that you're you're bound like, man, I'm not free. I got laws and things against me. I'm shackled by what I can and cannot do. But I want to do this. I Why can't I do that? Well, you know, mom and dad said the message says you can't do that. No, but I want You don't understand. I want to do this. That nature hasn't changed. You're still attached to that first husband and he's got to die. But I you look within yourself and you and then finally what happened was I went to my first youth camp. I was a freshman. I went there in that atmosphere and I said whatever this is I need this feeling. You know if you if you ever been to your first youth camp it's almost like time stands still. Nothing else exists. Nothing matters. Time just it's like wow this is heaven. Everybody's enjoying the Lord. Everybody's praising. Everybody's shouting. This is such a time. Why would I leave this place? Goodness me. And then the moment you get in the van to drive back, it's like the split decision from I don't want to leave this place is like now that feeling just disappears. It's like back to the world. And then you got to be honest with yourself. You might say, "Oh, but I really didn't want to go." But then the moment you left the grounds, your heart started to change back to what it's first attached to because nothing's in there to stop it from going back. So it still wants to come back. Come back this way because your heart hasn't changed yet. And I I saw within myself this thing happened time and time again. I was like, "Here I'm going. I'm enjoying the time. You don't understand. I'm amening. I'm praising the Lord. My hands are up. I believe I'm giving of myself to him. &gt;&gt; I believe I'm doing everything that I'm being told to do. I'm coming to an altar, but I'm not allowing him to come into my altar. So, I just stop here. Well, this altar does nothing for you if this is all as far as you go. You've got to go a little bit further than just this altar. See, it's not the prayer line. That's the problem. I believe in a prayer line. Our prophet had prayer lines. But what did our prophet say? He said, "It's God in the prayer line." You got to put your faith on the right thing. You know, you would go and you would see all these emotions. This person's screaming, this person's dancing, this person's shouting, and I'm sitting there like, I don't feel what they feel. What's happening? I want a taste of that. I'm wanting to feel what I'm seeing because I've now identified that the actual move of God is based off of an outside evidence, &gt;&gt; something that I could see and I could point to and say, "That's Christ." So now I'm chasing and looking after this evidence and this effect to be made manifest in my life. when in fact I was categorically fulfilling where brother Brandham said seek the giver &gt;&gt; not the gift &gt;&gt; but here I was seeking the gift &gt;&gt; to then say well the he is the giver of the gift so therefore if I have the gift I've got the giver no prophet said everybody comes to church there's three kinds of believers I believe everybody in here is a believer that is my stand and I'm sticking to it if you don't believe. So, today's the day you will find out you are a believer because there's something the word of God does. It's got power. You find me the person who said they've sinned so much, they've done too much that they can't be redeemed. And I'll find you a God that says that's all. &gt;&gt; Wait, what? No, you don't understand. I've sinned my entire life. I denied you. I renounced this message. I cursed everybody that believed this message. That's all we just sang about. There's a fountain. There's a blood. Does that blood have a limit? I don't think so. That blood reaches as far as it needs to. &gt;&gt; It can save whoever. It doesn't matter how far you think you've gone. That blood still has reach. &gt;&gt; Thank God for that. Because if it wasn't for that, some of us, I know if it was just by what we've done, there's no way we would find a way back to him. But I'm so glad before we ever committed the sin, he said, "I'm going to put this person's name on this list. I'm going to put this person's name on this list." He settled it before I could mess it up because according to me, I've already messed it up. My first birth messed it up. Before I could even sin, I messed it up because I was born in sin, shaped in iniquity, came into this world speaking lies. Well, this is rigged. I didn't even do nothing yet. Yet they say you can't baptize a baby because a baby knows no wrong. But yet as a baby I was a sinner. H this is interesting. What's the truth of the matter? They're both true. As a baby I'm a sinner. But also as a baby I can't I can't repent of nothing. I've done nothing. My conception was the sin. It wasn't me. I just appeared. Right? So, you're given a deck of cards that's given to lose from your first birth. You're attached to death. Every one of us, that first birth says death. You have to be born again. If you are not born again, the destination, no matter how righteous of a life you live, remains the same. &gt;&gt; I've given all the money you don't understand. I've built so many churches. Have you been born again? &gt;&gt; Except a man be born again, he shall not see the kingdom of God. It's not the works. It's not what you've done. It's what he's done. Can I stand back and say, "Lord, this is your plan. This is your work." You said, "Speak and go forward." &gt;&gt; What am I supposed to speak, not my own thoughts? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "This bride's been given, thus sayeth the Lord." &gt;&gt; She's been given. &gt;&gt; It's not something she mustered up, something she created. She's been given thus sayeth the Lord. She's got the word. &gt;&gt; Brother said God rigged it so much he put his word in her &gt;&gt; so she couldn't be lost. &gt;&gt; Okay. So now that changes things a bit &gt;&gt; because now I'm looking at myself as this I'm going I'm going through life. I'm going through meetings and everything. I'm looking at myself as this guy that he knows the truth. He's trying to do right. And I I I I really want to paint this picture. the amount of efforts you could go through as a human being to be right just to find out it was all for not. I did everything I thought to be right from listening to tapes every day, reading my Bible, praying. I did everything. But it was only for a season and then I went right back into the cycle &gt;&gt; because it was only as long as the conviction lasted. See, some of us go places. We travel places. We sit in church. We hear the word of God hit. And I say some of us, but I'm speaking about myself here. We sit in churches. We hear the word. It hits our heart. It sinks down on the inside. Yet, for some reason, it only lasts for so long. &gt;&gt; But you answer this for me. Either what you felt was real or it wasn't. Either you were in church and you felt the presence of God come down on the scene call you by name or it didn't. But if it did and conviction set in and said, "Man, I I ought to change my life. I got to start living for Christ. I know this is the truth. Brother Ben, you don't understand. I just don't know how to get my flesh to be able to live it. I don't know how to I I'm got to be honest. I still want to do wrong. &gt;&gt; Thank you for your honesty. &gt;&gt; I appreciate your honesty. The reason you still want to do wrong is because you have not esteem the gifts of God greater than the things you desire. &gt;&gt; When you really recognize what God has in store for you, what he's done for you, you realize there's nothing this world has to offer that can compare to that thing. &gt;&gt; But you don't know. So I'll give you grace. But oh, taste and see that the Lord is good. When you've tasted, see, it was one thing for Caleb and Joshua to say, "There is a land that flowth with milk and honey." That was one thing. But when that those people that doubted, when you finally got a taste of it, &gt;&gt; the reality changed. &gt;&gt; It was, oh, they were telling the truth, there is a land that flows with milk and honey, but there's giants there. scarecrows. &gt;&gt; They're they're nothing. &gt;&gt; He's given you the land. &gt;&gt; What are you scared of? &gt;&gt; I don't know a god that gives the land and then doesn't give the power to control the land, possess the land. No, he doesn't do a halfway job. He does a complete job. &gt;&gt; Our problem is we want a part to play in it. &gt;&gt; Let me find that small devil that I can take on my own. I don't need God for that one. Where is he at? Have you ever This is funny. Um the the Dave Matthew probably know this. Or you know, anybody that was a knucklehead as a kid probably knows this, but have you ever picked on somebody that was little and then they had somebody bigger that they wanted to show you after you picked on them? Like, man, I didn't know things could get any bigger. But yeah, I was one of those kids. Picked on somebody, the wrong person, and he had somebody bigger than I. Reality struck real fast. Don't look at the person you're trying to pick at. You don't know what's behind him. You don't know who's defending him. You don't know who's willing to die for him. So, when the devil comes at you and he picks at you because he thinks you're just this little guy, you're not going to fight back. You've got nothing to give him. and he's just going at you, attacking you, saying all the things you've done, and you just feel little and little and little and little. That's good. Praise the Lord right there. Because my prophet told me, "His strength is made perfect in my weakness." So when I feel little, I can say, "Listen, but I do serve a really big God &gt;&gt; and he comes to my defense. anytime I feel attacked. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; you get Well, you know, Brother Ben, I I I I know what I felt in that meeting was real. I I I know that the atmosphere there, something in my heart, deep down inside, I want it. I really do. I really And it's so easy to feel that want when you're in the atmosphere, &gt;&gt; that desire. I really wanted you have you couldn't have told me after that first camp during that camp that I'd go back and be the same person. I always said you're crazy. I was after what I just tasted. You're sick. I'm going to live what I just felt here for the rest of my life. That would have been my attitude because I believed it that much in the atmosphere. But it does no good for the atmosphere to be location-wise where it only stays in one location that I feel that atmosphere. No, I should feel that atmosphere everywhere that I'm at. At home, at work, at school, that atmosphere is a reality. It's not bound by a zip code. &gt;&gt; It's not bound by your favorite minister. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's bound by the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every time the word is spoken, there's a seed on the inside of the believer that says, "I want this. &gt;&gt; This is life to me. &gt;&gt; This is food for the journey." &gt;&gt; But you get in this atmosphere. You start, man, I I really I I really thought I gave myself. You come back, you learn. You got to be anchored in the word. Nothing moves the word. Stay with the word. rest. Faith find a resting place is in the word. Stay with the word. See, if you're not careful, the devil will take because I I want to be careful. What I'm not telling you is what you felt wasn't real. No, it was real. You just didn't know how to make it permanent. &gt;&gt; But it was real. The atmosphere you felt, the joy you felt, the excitement you felt, that was real. Because when God, you have to understand what it means to be lost, bound in sin with no freedom, and then God shows you a taste of what freedom looks like. &gt;&gt; You ain't going back. &gt;&gt; But I had to get an experience. &gt;&gt; But I'm I'm not speaking of an because when we say experience, automatically in our minds, we come up with an image of what experience looks like, a picture of what experience looks like. I want to read this quote for you if I could find it. Brother Brandham says in Melzdc the great prince and king, what a marvelous promise, two immutable things. God cannot lie and be God. Now if God paragraph 74 Now if God has made a promise in his Bible here, we believe the Bible to be the infalluable word of God. And if God has made a promise in the Bible, we have this consolation and know that it's impossible for God to lie. Therefore, when we see he promised it in the Bible, we believe it soul, body, and spirit. It is impossible for him to lie. Now, if there's any fault, this is very key. It's on us, &gt;&gt; not in God. God is obligated to his word. &gt;&gt; You know in this hour you are his word. &gt;&gt; He's obligated to you. &gt;&gt; For he has sworn by his word. Wait, he sworn on me? Yes. Because you are in him. You and him are one. My I'm sure when we get to seeing it in that way, in that light, things begin to shape up and heap up different than what they used to be. Healing of the body doesn't become fiction. It becomes a reality. The baptism of the Holy Spirit doesn't come doesn't become an emotional worked substance. It becomes a reality of the inddwelling presence of the Lord Jesus Christ to change the life. That's the key. &gt;&gt; The life has to change &gt;&gt; when you've got the person of Jesus Christ on the inside. See, I looked within myself and I figured out what it was here. Before I had the experience where I knew the indwelling spirit was in me. I was trying to obey the word because I didn't want to go to hell. &gt;&gt; That's a slippery slope because then you start weighing things on gravity. Why would God send me to hell for a little white lie? Why would God send me to hell? I had a cookie. I wasn't supposed to. Why would he send me to hell for that? You start weighing sins now because you just don't want to go to hell. You think the grave stuff will send you to hell. But brother Bam said God had a right to slay you for the littlest lie. But thank God for his mercies &gt;&gt; and his grace that he could look beyond our faults and see the need that we had. We needed him &gt;&gt; and it struck me to change the life. I said okay when that experience happened what I began to see was now my desires was no longer how do I live for Christ so I could that I could avoid hell but now it's I want to live for Christ because I love him. &gt;&gt; I don't I I don't want to hurt him. It It killed me when I made a mistake. It It hurt me. Beforehand, it was just, oh well, got to start again. But now some something was crying, make it right. Make it right. Make it right. But in order for that voice to cry, make it right, I had to be right. &gt;&gt; But without the indwelling spirit, it's just man trying to make man better. That's a that's a failing formula. It'll never work. And if if we're not careful what we start doing after we know we've had experience with Christ, we know we have the inddwelling spirit in us. The Bible also describes him as an indwelling intercessor. &gt;&gt; So, he intercesses for you, for me. &gt;&gt; He stands in the gap for you and me. &gt;&gt; But if we're not careful, we get on our high horse where I know I've got the spirit on the inside. And we start, we have a measuring stick. Well, I saw you sin. Well, you ain't got it. Well, I saw you sin. Well, you ain't got it. I Well, you ain't got it. We just start measuring everybody based off of our standard. I just want to know whose standard is it? Is it God or yours? &gt;&gt; What would you have told Abraham &gt;&gt; if you were there with Abraham and you seen him lie about Sarah? &gt;&gt; And then he tells the king, "Go to my servant and have him pray for you." You would have said, "Why would you serve it?" He just lied. &gt;&gt; We got to Brother Bam says, "If you want to know what kind of person you would have been when Jesus was here, look at the kind of person you are now." &gt;&gt; It doesn't change. We have this fantasy in our mind that I'll be a better Christian if Jesus was here and he was present. No, you'd be the same person you are. &gt;&gt; Only difference is you knew he knew what you were doing &gt;&gt; because you could see him. You knew he knows. He knows. But if you really enter into his reality, even when you don't see him, you know he knows. He's always there. He's always present. &gt;&gt; We have this it's almost like a crutch that man, if Jesus was I've spoken to so many atheists and different kinds of people and you you tell them about the word, you tell them about God, then they say, "Well, you know how I believe it? If Jesus comes down right now and tells me what you said is true, I'll believe it. Well, let's get out of the way for a moment. If Brother Brandham was here and somebody spoke in that manner, I would imagine he'd probably say something like this. A greater than Solomon is here. A greater than all of them is here. They would just see a man, &gt;&gt; but they wouldn't know what he was talking about. He turned his back. He described who you were, where you came from. All you would see is a man. But if you go go beyond the veil, God shows up today in you. In you, in you. You are Christ on earth. &gt;&gt; Your feet are his feet. Your hands are his hands. So when they say, "If Christ was here before me, who do you think they're standing in front of? She is him. You are one with him. It's not a separate being." No, you are one. That's what we've come to in this hour. A complete oneness. &gt;&gt; So when they stand before you and make statements like that, you ought to be careful to not say something to cause them to blaspheme against the Lord. &gt;&gt; Have mercy upon them. &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, you know, I I'm sorry, but just walk away." Not every circumstance you have to engage. &gt;&gt; Not every circumstance you got to debate. Not every circumstance you'll do more hurt for that person than you will do good. God didn't call you to judge. He called you to be the life. &gt;&gt; He lived the life and walked the life. And Pilate said, "This is a man that's done no wrong. &gt;&gt; What would you have me do with him?" They spoke what they wanted for him. He didn't say nothing. He was the King of Kings, Lord of Lords. here on earth. &gt;&gt; The very people reading the scriptures, reading the the scrolls, had no idea who was standing before them. And in this hour, we had one who came into that manifestation. &gt;&gt; The first fruit &gt;&gt; and he stood and they didn't know who was before him. &gt;&gt; Think it not strange they don't know who's before them when you stand there. &gt;&gt; The theme has to continue. I I I got you know I just w walking within myself and I said man you know what what happens is because you don't know how to identify the indwelling spirit in your life ministers I I include myself in this we do a disservice because we'll beat down on something and then you've got the inddwelling spirit and you start questioning because your flesh is being reminded of its faults. So you then start doubting what he done for you. But he's already saved you. &gt;&gt; He's not trying to hurt you. &gt;&gt; He's trying to iron things out. He's trying to perfect you. He's not trying to diminish you, make you feel like you're lacking in something. No, he doesn't seal you today and unseal you tomorrow. You're sealed. If that was the case, why would the scripture say, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed till the day of your redemption." That means if anybody gives you an image that I have the Holy Ghost on the inside and I'm faultless, you have to really be careful because in one sense it's true, on the other sense it's not. &gt;&gt; You're faultless because Christ is in you, therefore you're perfect. But if you're attributing your righteousness of what you can do, of what you've done, well, now you're standing on the wrong side of the story. &gt;&gt; Because then what you're showing to the people is that you can obtain a perfection in your flesh. My flesh won't tempt me. My flesh won't bother me. That old nature won't come up. No, it comes up. And you see it in the life of our prophet that devil always tried to come up. I I think I I think I saw this somewhere and and if it's wrong, forgive me, but I believe it said brother Brandham tried to commit suicide over five times. This is our prophet. &gt;&gt; What pressure, what feeling must he have been under? &gt;&gt; What could it have been? He describes, I believe, I believe it's in the same sermon, expectations, he he describes a story of what it feels like to be under that inspiration. Somebody came to him and questioned him and said, "Well, Brother Brandham, why do you only pray for one person and all these other people pray for multiple people?" He said, "You don't know what it's like to be under that atmosphere." He said, "Man, there's nothing that whoops me more than a vision." He said, "Daniel had one vision and was tormented for a long time." Then brother Ram starts describing about this old singers that wrote these songs that were so inspired. And he said when they came down from that inspiration, one by the other committed suicide. &gt;&gt; The man who wrote there is a fountain filled with blood. That same person &gt;&gt; after coming down that inspiration wanted to go to the bridge and jump off. &gt;&gt; He couldn't contain that knowing. Listen, if you only knew what it meant for your sin to be forgiven, &gt;&gt; how much of a cost it was for him, beaten, bruised, he did nothing wrong, but he had me in mind. He had you in mind. He didn't want to lose you. He couldn't lose you. And he took that for us. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says coming down from that, he it it messed him up for a while. You're still human. You're still a man. Only thing that changes, there's a voice on the inside, starts to speak at you. Hey, we got a greater work we got to do. We got something we got to do. You can't sit around and wallow in the fault you made yesterday. Make it right. Let's continue. I got things to do. it it it's not going to sit there and baby you. &gt;&gt; Somebody has got to manifest the word. Somebody has got to walk in all the blessings of the word. Somebody has to save the souls. Somebody has to lay hands on the sick so they shall recover. &gt;&gt; But you can't just sit at home. &gt;&gt; Wallowing in your sin. &gt;&gt; Wallowing in your disappointment of yourself. How could I have done that? I knew better. How could I have done that? You don't think our prophet knew better when he told me to tell them I'm not here? &gt;&gt; You don't think he knew better? He did. But you know what he did? He went right. He had to go pray for somebody. And because he had that inddwelling spirit on the inside, it said, "Hypocrite. &gt;&gt; Go and make it right." &gt;&gt; He had to go back. I'm sorry. What humility, humbleness to lower yourself that much. He didn't have to make that right. But that inddwelling spirit that only spews the things of God said, "Go make that right." He went, made it right, came back, and he prayed. Walk the life. &gt;&gt; We have to stop questioning what he's done for us. &gt;&gt; It's a perfect work. &gt;&gt; He's finished it. &gt;&gt; We need to now be walking in what he said this bride must be walking in. But we can't do that if we're constantly questioning what he's done for us. &gt;&gt; You will never get an answer satisfying enough to the flesh &gt;&gt; that God saved you &gt;&gt; because the flesh always remembers where you were &gt;&gt; the first time you committed the sin &gt;&gt; the last time you committed the sin. It will always remind you. It follows you. But I got something on the inside that's crying for the real me somewhere above. &gt;&gt; It's not the things you did that were here that make you who you are. Your true existence is who you were in the beginning. What he said of you in the beginning when he had a thought of you in the beginning, that's who you were. You just stopped here for a moment. This is nothing but a a layover. I'm just stopping for a moment. I can't get accustomed here. I'm I can't get too comfortable here. I might get irritated at the flight attendant. I might get irritated at the person at the desk. I might not like the person sitting next to me. But I'm only here for a moment. &gt;&gt; Then I got to take that other flight. And this flight takes me somewhere where there's no sin, no sorrow, no pain, no death. So I I I can't make my Really think about it. You're being told you're going on the greatest vacation ever. Your destination, where you're headed, anything you desire appears. Amen. &gt;&gt; You could not imagine the beauty of it all. &gt;&gt; You like oceans, your destination will have oceans. &gt;&gt; You like mountains, your destination will have mountains. You like this, you like that. Whatever you like is being given to you. &gt;&gt; It's the perfect condition. Nobody's calling you to bail him out. &gt;&gt; Nobody's calling you to help him out. Nobody's calling you to pray for him because it's a perfect condition. &gt;&gt; This is what's in the balance here. either we're striving and walking towards that &gt;&gt; because we got to get the practice somewhere &gt;&gt; because my my prophet told me that I I have authority now not just then but I have authority now &gt;&gt; so if I speak the word of God he said my lips speaking it is deity speaking &gt;&gt; I can't do that and at the same time I got to save myself again Man, I've been doing so good. I I seen God in my life. I brought Man, I was I was ministering to this person. I just felt my soul enter in with him and we're having such good fellowship and man, such a good time. But then that driver cut me off, man. And I said the wrong thing. And now I feel like I got to woe is me. How could I have sinned? And you stay there for a while rather than just making it right and move on. You stay there for a while. It takes you a week there, then finally you move out of it, then you're back again. Then, oh, you make a mistake. Oh, I got to wallow in this again. That's not the life we were supposed to live. As things come to you, you get the victory. Walk, talk, act, be who he made you to be. And if you happen to fall, get up, &gt;&gt; dust yourself off, and keep pressing on. &gt;&gt; But this is what's in the balance. and you make this flight. You got a layover for an hour and then you get distracted. Let me let me make it better. You have a layover for 30 seconds. Not an hour. An hour is too long. You have a layover for 30 seconds. It's getting off. Going right back to another plane. Rather than that, you you know where you're headed has anything your heart desires. If you were hungry, oh my god. just to draw an example. But you stop and you say, "Oo, McDonald's. Water burger. Wow, Shake Shack. What's that got to do with a nice 16 Wagu ribeye? &gt;&gt; I don't want that. I got the real thing. &gt;&gt; You give me a bunch of mixed hybrid stuff all together, put in a patty so I can eat it when I can get the real thing." But that's what we do. We don't value or esteem the things of God better than the things of this world. And that's the problem because we don't know. But unless you get in the word, you got when you hear and see, I kid you not, I was brother Adrian and we were talking about uh a future home. I told him, I said, "Man, you I could explain it to you. I could tell it to you, but you got to just rate it and and just listen to what God says about that home." And I came back here the next day. He's like, "Oh, brother brother Brand was, "Oh, I can't wait. How could we miss any?" And it's if you don't know, you don't you don't see the value in it. &gt;&gt; But you had you have to be in the word, &gt;&gt; but even after reading it and and thinking you understand it, the Bible still says, "Eyes have not seen, &gt;&gt; ears have not heard &gt;&gt; all that God has in store for them." So, you're only getting a mental taste in your mind that's limited, but you can't comprehend what's weighing in the balance. Eternal life, &gt;&gt; temporary life. You got to wake up early in the morning. You got to go to work. All the money you make goes to bills. &gt;&gt; If you have children, it goes to bills and children. If you have a wife, it goes to wife, children, bills. All the efforts you make here, doesn't matter how much money you make, &gt;&gt; you'll want to spend it &gt;&gt; over there. I got no need of money. I'm sitting with him. I look out, I see the streets of gold. I see brother Billy out there strolling. I see David crawling on all fours just for the fun of it. Oh, what a time. Time is no more. This This is what's awaiting us. I could I can't even describe it to you. All the everything God has in store for you, the little that I know, I could not describe it to you. But I promise you, its weight should far outweigh your temporary pleasure to do what you want to do. &gt;&gt; In fact, I'll just I'll just uh I want to say ruin, but I'll give you the reality of the statement, do what you want to do. Brother says there's only two spirits in this world. &gt;&gt; That of God and that of Satan. There is no middle ground. Oh, I don't worship Satan. I don't want to believe, you know, Lord either. I just want to do what I want to do. Like, you know what? I know God exists. I know the message is real, but I just want to do me right now. I want to do what I want to do. Please me, satisfy myself, but I'm not I don't believe devil, but I also don't want to like all the way believe God, but I promise I'm not a sinner. I I hope I make it to heaven. I don't want a hope. I want a certainty. &gt;&gt; And that seal of God, that indwelling spirit settles it. &gt;&gt; You can't mess it up. &gt;&gt; And and and here we are. This middle ground, I want to do what I want to do. No. In fact, what you want to do is what the devil wants you to do. &gt;&gt; He wants you to think it's your idea. &gt;&gt; I came up with this. Hey, you you know, brother Billy, nobody knew. I didn't have to please the devil. I didn't have to please God. I can just do what I want to do. No, it's one or the other. &gt;&gt; There's no gray dog. It's black and the white dog. Whichever you feed is the one that wins &gt;&gt; if you have the call. Thank God for a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I forgot to to hit my timer. Um, let's just pretend I had hit it. I just started it. I'm kidding. But I'm I'm I'm there's so much here. I'm I'm I'm working to to close in. But who put in your mind who lied to you that you had a thought coming? There's only And Chad GPT responded as if it was the devil. He said, "If you were Satan, how would you get me to serve and worship you?" And the answer Chad GPT gave, oh my goodness, to this day, I'm like, what? You would have thought you were talking to the devil himself. He said, why would I flat out tell you that you're serving me? That's pointless. Instead, I would get you to think that your ambitions, your goals, God's not for. Why would God not want you to do what he want what you want to do? That doesn't make sense. And if I could get you to question your ambitions versus what God wants at that point, you'd be serving me and you wouldn't know it. This is what the answer it gave. Is that not the biblical attitude the devil has? He doesn't come to you with horns. He comes to you with your dreams, &gt;&gt; with your goals, with your ambitions, but right behind it there's a knife or there's a gun behind it. You think you're going to take this and just, oh, this is everything that I wanted. I wanted cake. The moment you bite into it, he's got you. He He only gives you if he's a good devil, because he's got 2,000 years of experience. That's a funny statement, good devil. But 2,000 years of experience, if he's a really good, stout, devout devil, he would only give you what you want. If he was a bad devil, he'd give you what you don't want. Well, that's easy. I don't want that. Funny story. Brother Burley said something told a joke one time. He said, "Well, I had this I had this young man come up to me and say, "Brother Burley, I've been delivered from the spirit of lust. I've been delivered." Brother Brley says, "You haven't you've been delivered?" He goes, "Yeah, I've been delivered." He said, "Let me ask you a question." He said, "What?" He said, "Was she ugly?" He said, "Yeah." He said, "You ain't been delivered. Why would the devil tempt you with something that isn't a temptation? &gt;&gt; It's got to be pleasing to your eyes, to the natural senses. You laugh cuz it's funny. But in reality, we do this all the time. &gt;&gt; We think we've overcome something when it's something that didn't really bother us to begin with. &gt;&gt; But the thing that we like to do, we like to indulge in that we don't want no one to know the sin that's hidden. It's like, well, don't touch my pet sin. &gt;&gt; Touch everything else, but not my pet sin. I love a good reality show. &gt;&gt; I love a good movie. &gt;&gt; I love a good show. I love a good laugh. Let me watch a comedic movie. There's nothing wrong with an action movie. There's nothing wrong with this. Oh, you you you may go for a while. You may go for a while, but sooner or later you'll find yourself right back. Oh, how did I get here again? &gt;&gt; The formula is wrong. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, but brother, you know, I I had an experience with God. I know I did because I I I feel the conviction every time I do something wrong. I feel the conviction in my heart. Why do I keep going this way?" Simply put, if you feel a conviction that it's wrong, do something different. &gt;&gt; You can't keep doing the same thing and expect something to change. I believe I heard brother Brandham say in the sermon, I think the harvest, he said, "Be careful with the habits you build because when something's happened, you'll begin to reach for the wrong thing &gt;&gt; because you this is so habitual to you. You've always when you're sad and depressed just I I just had to watch something funny to cheer me up. This is what I always do. The devil lied to children of God and told them that if you were bored, the word wouldn't be good enough. He told them that if you needed excitement, the word wouldn't be good enough. That if you needed joy, the word wouldn't be good enough. That if you needed fellowship, the word wouldn't be good enough. Well, here's the reality. The word is good for all things. If you want to have a good time, find you that one brother that you can fellowship about with the word and you can dig in and you're just enjoying the things of God. You know what? God's doing this in my life. He's showing me this. This brother says, "Man, you don't know what God's been showing me?" It's like, "Oh my goodness, I just want to explode. &gt;&gt; This is awesome. &gt;&gt; The things of God, awesome, &gt;&gt; great. They're fun. They're exciting. &gt;&gt; Get lost in the word." See, the reason you can't get lost in the word because you're still doing it legalistically. I have to fulfill this duty of listening. I have to read my B my Bible to to fill this duty. It's got nothing to do with the duty of it. &gt;&gt; It's your job to feed on the word, to remain in the word. That's what you're called to do. &gt;&gt; But the joy from the word &gt;&gt; that comes from within and comes out. Something's had to have changed on the inside that nothing else quenches you. Nothing else satisfies you like the word. No substitute will ever do it for you. It's got to be the word. &gt;&gt; But says, "It seems as if we're no longer significantly impressed &gt;&gt; by the word." &gt;&gt; Oh, I felt so little because I know what it's like, man. I listen to tape today. I've read my Bible. I've prayed. Now I want something fun to do. And you start looking at the things you used to do for fun. You say, "Oh, well, you know, it's not that bad. I was just watching a ball game. Nothing crazy." And then an ad came up and then you saw the ad and then your mind raced somewhere &gt;&gt; and now you're Oh Lord, how could I have father man? We still got a taste for the things of the world. We The indwelling spirit is there to pull that out of us. I I don't want to be much I got a lot a a lot more, but I'll read a couple quotes and I'll close. Brother Brandon makes this statement. Uh in Melkazedc the great prince and king paragraph 38. And God swore by an oath and anyone swearing by an oath swears by someone greater than they are. So God had no one greater than him himself to swear by. So he swore by himself that he would keep his covenant with Abraham. Then how firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord, if we'll approach this subject today real sensibly, calmly. Never be excited. Faith never gets excited. Faith never rushes itself. Now I don't want you to take this where you don't have to take it. Faith never gets excited. He didn't talk about you as a person. Faith, the gift of God is assurance. &gt;&gt; It doesn't need an emotion. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. It's the amen. It's the this is it. It doesn't get excited. Faith never rushes itself. Faith knows what it's talking about. &gt;&gt; You never seen our master excited about anything. Standing by the grave of a dead man. He was just as calm as he was when he sit on the mount and looked over Jerusalem. standing on a trouble on a ship in the troubled seas and the waves tossed about. He was so completely rested in God until it never even paid any attention to it enough to wake up. Always undisturbed. Faith is &gt;&gt; see when you're disturbed, &gt;&gt; get a little faith. It'll get you undisturbed. Then you recognize who's in control. &gt;&gt; It ain't me. This isn't my show, it's his. &gt;&gt; He says paragraph 47 man was a comedian. He said, "Could you imagine Jesus saying, "Now, let me check my faith and see if I've got enough faith to do this." See, if I'll have if I'll have to fast a while to see if I'll have enough faith to do this, he was perfectly unconscious of the faith that he had. He just spoke it and knew it would be so. &gt;&gt; Now, these words got to leave the pages, leave the screens, and it's got to become a reality in you because you've been given the same ability to speak and it be according to your word, your confession, just like you are come from home today. You probably want to return to your homes, told your wife or your loved ones, I'll be back sometime right afternoon. How do you know you are? You don't try to wonder, "Have I got faith enough to go home? Have I got faith enough to drive my car?" You just unconsciously turn your key on, drive on away, and go home. See, it's the unconscious faith that does it. &gt;&gt; See, you don't have to reason when you're going home. You don't have to reason if you're going to come back. But if we can just get the reasoning out of all the other decisions, we would have unconscious faith in all realms. That's my heart's desire to get Ben's reasoning out the way so that God could have full reign in control that whatever I speak I don't question because I know it's a finished work because he said so. So it didn't I don't want to because then you go somewhere else. We'll just continue here. Now God could have paragraph 56. Now God could have placed and oh Lord forgive me. This is me. Now God could have placed little Samuel right in Hannah's arms. All of us knows that he is a creator of all things. Just speaks it into exist existence. He could have put it right in Hannah's arms. But instead of doing that, it was the regular procedure of nine months. Before the little baby come along, he could have done it instantly, but he didn't do it instantly. Some of us want I got dwelling spirit. I'll never sin again. This is our attitude. I had this attitude. And because I had that attitude, every time you make a mistake, you remove what God's done for you in your life and you try to go seek it again. &gt;&gt; He says he could have done it instantly, but he didn't do it instantly. He just give her the promise and she inherited the promise. When God told Moses when he started out to go into the promised land, all that promise, he said, "I give Abraham years ago, it's all walled up with Philistines and all kinds of great people over there, warriors." He said, "Now it's all yours." There was the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Perizzites and all those over there, the Hivites, the Jebunites, the Philistines, everything in Palestine. Now God said, "I have given it to you. It's yours. Now go and possess it." Oh, I hope you see it, people. It's something that I want to get to you to put your faith where it belongs. Many people as I find they've got faith if they only know how to put it to work. &gt;&gt; Father help us. And he he's speaking about Benjamin Franklin here. When he found electricity, he said, "I got it." &gt;&gt; But he didn't know what he had. &gt;&gt; And come Thomas Edison, he said, "I'll work for us. It'll work for us." &gt;&gt; And he didn't care how long it took. He tried 10,000 wires, but yet he found a wire that would finally carry the electronic or the electricity into the wire. He knowed it was the power and that power would work in our benefit. Oh, what that did to me? Because then you realize there was a word that had to be spoken that only an elected bunch would be able to manifest. Only an elected bunch would be able to transmit that electricity straight from the source. It was you and I. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He throughout the churches as you see it was dark and all. And in this time, &gt;&gt; he said this bride, this wire, she can hold that electricity. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now we found salvation that will save us from sin. That will make the vilest woman or man, drunker, prostitute, and make them a child of God. Well, that same faith, that same power that will lift up a fallen man or woman of that, it'll work for us in many different ways. It'll heal our bodies if you if you can't just find the right if you can just find the right approach. &gt;&gt; You've got to find how to do it. &gt;&gt; See, we know the matter works. &gt;&gt; The word stays the same. That's the matter. &gt;&gt; Keep the matter the matter. Now, we have to find the manner how to make it happen. We know what the goal is. &gt;&gt; How? You heard it on Sunday. Speak and go forward. &gt;&gt; That's the manner. Speak and go forward. You can't doubt. Speak and go forward. What do you want? Speak and go forward. Don't question. Remember, he told Moses, "You would bring these people to this mountain." &gt;&gt; Yet he for some reason he got dazed &gt;&gt; and forgot. But what the Lord told them had to be fulfilled &gt;&gt; at that point. All no matter how much trouble came, no matter how much Egyptians there were, there could have been tens of millions of them. God told Moses, "This mountain, &gt;&gt; you will bring them to." &gt;&gt; Every single one of those Egyptians would have been dead. &gt;&gt; Nothing stands in the way of a promise for a son of God. &gt;&gt; He said, &gt;&gt; and that's the same thing the Holy Spirit is. is and God's promise. Oh, this is beautiful. If we'll just let it run its way and not us get in the way, not us throw our doubts there cuz this didn't and that didn't. Just let God's Holy Spirit working and you rest upon the promise. It'll do just exactly what God said it would. Abraham was an old man, a hundred years old. When God appeared to him in the name of Almighty God, the Almighty there comes from the Hebrew word of El Shadi, which means the bosom or breast of a woman. Now, he was old. His strength was gone. But El Shadi is the almighty, the strength giver. And all Abraham had to do to obtain this promise. Put your name there because we just read earlier that Abraham's covenant, he would carry it to the seed that come after Abraham, which is you and I. He said, "And all Abraham had to do, all Benwis had to do is to to obtain this promise was lay right on that promise." Other words, like the baby to its mother and nurse from the mother, strength for the baby. And we do the same thing when we come to God and see his promise. We just lay right to him and draw from his word the strength of God given in its course, not taking our own mind, just believing it. Amen. &gt;&gt; After he had endured, &gt;&gt; there's an endurance. &gt;&gt; He obtained the promise. Oh, I just love that. You have to hear the prophet say that. Oh, I just love that. Now, the same thing works for salvation. &gt;&gt; Same doesn't work for divine healing. How God in his great love and infinite mercy give it to us. Now, musicians, please come because if not, I don't know what's going to happen to us. Saying, surely I will bless thee &gt;&gt; and will multiply thee. And so after he had patiently endured, he endured the promise. 16th verse, for men verilely swear by a greater, and the oath is confirmation, confirmed. Is it to them an end of all strife? In other words, if the oath is sworn, then that's the end of all things. If you come and say, "Brother Brandham, I as a Christian put my hand upon the Bible and so many swear that I'll do a certain thing. If God let me live to do it, I'll do it." All right. Then to me that's the end of all doubting. &gt;&gt; You have swore to me that you would do it. And God swore to Abraham that he would keep his covenant with him and of his seed forever. &gt;&gt; God swore by himself he would do it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's all stand. This this I'll finish with this quote cuz this man this this struck me. You got to know where you stand. You got to know you've got him on the inside. Don't don't wait for somebody to confirm what you got. You got to know it's you and God and you and him alone. He's done something for me. I know he has. It doesn't matter what somebody else tells you. You know what he's done for you. No one knows like you know. No one knows where you've been. the sins you've done when no one was watching. Nobody knows, but he knows. &gt;&gt; And he knows he's changed you. &gt;&gt; You're no longer those sins. He doesn't count them towards you. Paragraph 81, he says, "Whether it's popularity, whether it's our church, whether it's our friends, our associates, whoever it may be, whether it's our doctor, whether it's our priest, whether it's our preacher, all of the grounds is sinking sands. Christ alone and every man that's ever amounted to anything in this great battlefield of strife has been men and women who stood alone on them convictions. When everything else failed and fell around them, they still stood. Abraham Lincoln of old was convinced that he was right. He stood alone on his convent convictions, but he proved it and sealed his testimony with his own blood. Jesus Christ stood alone in his day as an example that every man upon the convictions of God eternal truth that will take his stand positionally and stand will stand alone but not alone &gt;&gt; with God. The invisible companion who follows us through life's journey. Amen. Down through the shadows of the valley of the shadow of death and into eternity. He'll still go with us and be God. Then what is our hope built on this morning? Because God swore that he would do it to Abraham swore not only to Abraham but every one of his seed. Who is the seed? You who have the invitation to come to the Lord Jesus Christ, the seed of Abraham. Certainly there is people who isn't called. But to every one of you here this morning that's had the call. Notice how brother Brennon breaks this down. Why are you here at church this morning? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Or we can say, "Why are you here at church this night? Something told you to come." &gt;&gt; You know, it wasn't the enemy to try to get you to do wrong. Try to get you to do wrong to come to church. You couldn't do that. When you come to church, you're doing right. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I pray this church is filled next Wednesday cuz my prophet said, "When you come to church, you do right." &gt;&gt; And Jesus said in his own words that no man can come to me. &gt;&gt; Anchor yourself in this. This is what he's talking about you. I don't care all the sins you've done. I don't care the sins you're still committing. That's got nothing to do with me. This is all that matters. No man come to me except my father draws him. Is there a draw? &gt;&gt; Then it's him that's doing the drawing. You're not too far gone. He says him that does the drawing and all that comes I'll give them everlasting life and raise him up at the last days. Think of it. Every person that comes on the invitation of the Lord Jesus Christ is promised eternal life and the resurrection in the last days by the Jehovah God who swore by an oath that he would do it and send his son and confirmed the word he swore it he would do it give it in type to Abraham fulfilled it in Jesus Christ raised them up. Oh, I learn says this. Living he loved me. Dying he saved me. Buried he carried my sins far away. Rising he justified. Frilly forever. Someday he's coming. &gt;&gt; Oh glorious day. Let's bow our head saints. Gracious heavenly father, we're so thankful, Lord Jesus, that your word is so simple. Lord, you spoke you'd be with us and even in us till the end. Lord Jesus, we ought to rest in what you said. Father, not worry about the naysayers, the doubters, our own flesh that is against us. Not worry about these things, but only trust in you, Father. We know what that indwelling spirit is. It's none other than you yourself, Father. The intercessor leading and guiding us into all truth and righteousness. The teacher, the revelator on the inside that gives discernment. Father, teach us not to grieve that spirit. Lord, that we could walk faithfully according to what the spirit says and we would live a more overcoming life. Father, the problem isn't the spirit that you placed in us. The problem is our obedience to the spirit. Lord, teach us to die out more. When the death old nature tries to rise up, kill it. Cast it down. Paul said, "I die daily so that Christ might live." He says, "No longer I, but Christ that liveth in me." Paul was so honest with us. He spoke and said, "That which I want to do, I don't do, but that which I don't want to do, that I do. Behold, I f I find a law within me." He realized you can't serve God in your flesh. It's got to be the spirit. This flesh can't be redeemed. Thank God that you placed the seed on the inside of us. Father, that settled it and sealed it forever. Lord Jesus, help your children that have come into your house tonight. Father, my soul goes out, Lord Jesus. I know what it's like to try to be righteous, to try to walk in your own efforts. Lord, I make that error every day. Lord, trying to be right, trying to do right. Father, teach me to surrender. Let that indwelling spirit do what it does best and lead me, Father. Oh, your prophet spoke when he gave the testimony of Daniel Curry. He says, "Shear me, Lord, whatever it takes. Shear me, Father. Let me be with nothing, Lord Jesus, that you might lead me. That I could just follow, Lord Jesus." He could see, Lord, that the goat nature just tries to come up sometimes. Let it make us into lambs, Lord Jesus. Oh father, we invite that dove back into our hearts, Lord Jesus. Have its way, have its preeminence, Lord Jesus, bless your people. If there's a soul that's in here that's crying out that identifies not with what I said, but what your word said, Lord Jesus, that says, "I know this is true. I want this. But, Brother Ben, you're right. I don't know how to do it. I don't have the strength to do it. Father, I sympathize with that heart. I I was once there. Lord Jesus, touch the soul. Lord, with everybody's eyes closed, if you feel a tug on your heart, lift your hands to him. Don't worry about who's next to you. Don't look to see if somebody else raised their hand so you could raise yours and feel better. This is serious. We may not get more moments like these, Lord Jesus. We must act today, Lord. Stop putting things off for tomorrow, Lord Jesus. And for those that have the desire to hear that unwilling spirit's voice a bit louder, they've quieted it by the busyiness of life, but they want to hear it more. Raise your hands as well, Father. Lord, my hands are up. The busyiness of life, the struggles, the faults and errors. try to get me to doubt, Lord Jesus, to question what I know you've done. Lord, my heart, my soul, my body, my entire being is to serve you, Lord Jesus. Whatever you got to do, Lord Jesus, mold me and make me. That's my prayer, Lord Jesus. I don't see the hands that have been lifted. I don't care to see the hands that have been lifted, but you see, Lord Jesus, there's honest hearts in this building. Lord, let your spirit sweep by each one. Lord Jesus, get a hold of them, Lord Jesus. Give them a vision. Give them a taste, Lord, of what it means to have that presence following you all the days of your life, Father, that they might know there is victory. There is complete, total victory from the things of this world. We don't believe in a partial victory. We thank you, Lord. We surrender ourselves into your hands, Father. We love you. We ask this in Jesus name. Amen. Let's just sing this song as we invite brother Billy. And this is my desire to honor you. And Lord with allship [Music] and all I have within me I give you praise. All that I I know is in you. [Music] Just sing it as I pray tonight. Oh, and Lord, I give you my heart and I give you my soul. I live for you, oh Lord.

Every breath that I take, every moment I'm away, Lord, have your way in me. Sing it again. Oh, and this is mine. Hallelujah. To worship you alone, Lord. Honor you, Lord. And Lord, with all my heart I worship you. [Music] All I have within me, oh Lord, I give you praise and all that I adore is in you. Oh Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul.

I want to sit at your feet, drink from the cup in your hand, lay back against you, and breathe. Fill your heart deep. Oh, and this love is so deep. is more than I can stand. Oh, and I rest in your peace. It's overwhelm me. Oh, and the more I seek you. Oh, and the more I find. Seek and you shall find. Oh, and the more I find you. Hallelujah. Oh Lord, and the more I love. Oh, and I want to sit at your feet. Drink from the cup in your hand. Lay back against you and breathe. Feel your heartbeat. Oh, and his love is so deep. It's more than I can stand. Oh, and I melt in your peace. It's overwhelming. Oh, and I want to sit at your feet. Drink from the cup in your hands. Lay back against you and breathe. Oh, and his love is so deep. Oh, it's more than I can stand. I'm melting your peace. It's overwhelming. Hallelujah. I tell you, there's nothing more important than to fell in love with him. Man, what we desire is the change of heart. You know when the heart is changed everything else will come easy. But if the heart is still hardened everything else is a fight. Once he changes your heart everything else will follow. What we desire is that are in our heart within the seed of our very heart may be for him and nothing else. And once we give him that first place, everything else will walk out according to his he's going to take care of all of it and you will fall and you will do wrong and everything. But you know deep inside of your heart, you want to live for him every day of your life and you're going to walk by in his presence. You're going to do everything. In fact, your works don't even unless those works are really originated from that very work that he did. Otherwise, it's just human righteousness. You know, I I even think, you know, the prophet comes and the devil comes to him and said, "Look at you after you've done all of this." Oh, yeah. He the devil will use the works. You You've given your life and you've done and and this is what he's going to do to you. Well, if that seed was not in there, then those works were going to glorify themselves and say, "That's true. That's so true." But there was a seed inside. I knew the Lord giveth, the Lord takes away. Blessed be the name of the Lord. That's what we're And if your heart can only be changed, that's what we desire as believers. Only if it could just change my heart. All my desires will change. The things where I want to go will change. But if you don't get that change, everything else is a covering. Is religion. Is you trying to portray something that you're not. But I know that he's here tonight to change you. I love what Alberto said. If Jesus was here, Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; He's here because his word says he's here. &gt;&gt; It's not here within that physical form of the robe of the man of Galilee. But his word is himself presently in his believers. That's what we desire and that's what our heart desire is. Amen. But Emanuel, if you could just come and dismiss us tonight. Amen. Amen. And if you need prayer, you may just come to the altar. After the prayer, we'll pray for you. Amen. God bless you. Let's bow our heads. Dear God, your word is truly the the word that we need in this hour. Lord, where else can we go, Lord? But to you, the God who loves us before the foundation of the world. Lord, thank you for giving us this faith. Lord, thank you for lifting us our faith to believe more than ever to you, Lord. Thank you for the salvation you've given to us and the forgiveness of our sin, Lord, because of your blood through your son, Lord Jesus. May you keep us safe, Lord, in the coming days. I know Lord there will be a struggles Lord but with you in us we will we will have the victory Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord God help us in every way. &gt;&gt; Give us the strength Lord wherever we are. &gt;&gt; This is hard time Lord. May you remember also those our loved ones Lord are dearest to our hearts. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Wherever they are Lord may you keep them safe Lord. &gt;&gt; May you not let them go Lord. &gt;&gt; I know you love them too. Yes. &gt;&gt; And always remember our pastor wherever he is, Lord. And may you give him the grace and mercy and strength. May he be a light, Lord, to those people where he is, Lord. I pray give back the strength to our brother who preached tonight. Lord truly it's a bless such a blessing Lord I pray we give you all the grace and mercy all the blessing Lord and the honor Jesus Christ's name we pray amen dying He saved me.
