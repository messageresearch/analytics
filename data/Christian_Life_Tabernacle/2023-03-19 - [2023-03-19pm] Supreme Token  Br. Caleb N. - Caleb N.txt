Lord God and that we as a subtling babe can come Lord God and be nourished and be satisfied whatever woes whatever pains we feel in our lives Lord God just as a babe comes to his mother Lord God and finds strength Lord God every time that we enter into this place Lord God and we feed from your table Lord God you give us the strength and the substance we need to face another day Lord God we live in a world that's full of tools and cares but we have found the savior in the midst of all this confusion Lord God we have found the light that shines in darkness we pray even now in the name of Jesus that you will continue to strengthen us Lord God there have been so many wonderful messages that have come across this pulpit but I pray as a congregation that we would have ears to hear I succeed Lord God that we will be doers of your word Lord God that we will take the word the voice that was spoken over this pulpit and apply it to our lives Lord God Monday through Friday Lord God that we would apply the word to our lives Lord God help us to look to Calvary Lord God and to look to your word when we are sick in our bodies Lord God to trust you when the world has turned this face to so many different voices I pray that in the midst of this confusion that we would hear that one still small voice and that we will be faithful to you Lord God that when you return Lord God you might find us ready Lord God that you can say to each of us who are assembled here Well done thy good and faithful servant thou has been Faithful over a few things Lord God I pray even now for the few things that I'm able to be faithful the few things that I'm able to do that I don't fail at Lord God that you would find me Worthy we pray for the brother that passed on to glory Lord God and we pray for his family in the name of Jesus I pray that we as a church would be an example to his family Lord God showing prayers and love Lord God and concern I pray for those who reach out to the family and Minister them that you would use them in a mighty way Lord God that they may be able to look at your life and see something different to see a light that shineeth in darkness Lord God for those who are sick in their bodies I know that you are still a Healer you're still able to touch and deliver it Lord God we just want to trust you for our healing Lord God and there may be those who are burdened tonight Lord God with needs that they can't even voice in this congregation Lord God and amongst friends but we have found a friend in Jesus that the tears that we leave on our pillows he understands Lord God and we know Now the secrets of our hearts are known unto him and I pray even now through the foolishness of preaching Lord God that you might minister to those needs let the man of God say something or do something that would encourage us and lift up our Spirits because we only need one word from you Lord God to bring about a change in our lives force in Jesus name we pray

because like the Good Shepherd you watch over your sheep in everything we go through father we knows for our own good so father we ask that we could ever grow in you and become fortified in your word father and be living examples of the manifestation of that word we ask you to bless us tonight in your precious and wonderful name we pray amen and amen God bless you tonight tonight we have brother Caleb Yoni that is going to introduce himself he's from uh Zimbabwe and then he moved to Zambia and uh his father's a preacher and that's normally we have a lot of preacher children here that's why we have so much trouble you know preacher kids you know there's something else but anyway we uh we're really grateful for uh to have him so this evening I thought I'd give this opportunity to introduce him to you in his ministry and trust that he'll to be a blessing to you tonight and he'll just share his heart with you and and uh we just continue to enter in to the fellowship we need as many soldiers on the ground as we can have people that are willing to stand there and fight the good fight of faith and and win the victory so brother Caleb if you'd come at this time this evening brother welcome and ask you Lord bless you and share your heart with us tonight God bless you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm asking for some volume here okay I kindly hear myself are we happy to be in the house of the Lord Brothers I'm asking for some volume on the monitors how many were blessed in the morning amen we thank God and once again I want to say happy Mother's Day to our mothers in the house may God richly bless you mothers go through a lot for us to be here it's a process so may God richly bless you and I want to thank the pastor for giving this opportunity to speak to you this evening and for a very few minutes for about 30 to 35 minutes God being my help I want us to speak on a little subject and I trust that the Lord will bless us this evening amen let us open our Bibles to chapter number 12. of the book of Exodus Exodus chapter number 12. verses 13. I was so blessed you know after such a messaging the morning about maturity uh maturity to reality you know sometimes when you're a preacher when such messages are preached you feel like what am I gonna speak after he has spoken almost everything that was tremendous amen I'm still asking for some volume here Exodus chapter number 12 13 speaking unto all the congregation of Israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamp for a house and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where they are where you are and when I see the blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you while I when I smite the land of Egypt let us go to Genesis chapter 22 verse 7 I'll be very fast because we are cruising this evening and as expect unto Abraham's father and say my father and he said here my my son and he said behold the fire and the hood but where is the Lamb for a bent offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamp for a bent offering so they went both of them together John chapter number 1 verse 29. the next day John said Jesus coming unto him and said Behold the Lamb of God which take away the sin of the world Revelations chapter number five verse one am I moving too fast good good good Revelations chapter number five verse 1. if you are they shout amen and I saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within on the backside suit with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof and no man in heaven or in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the other said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to lose the Seven Seals thereof may God bless the reading of the word shall we pray Heavenly Father want to thank you this evening we have come once again to Feast upon your word we ask that you bless and sanctify this word in Jesus name amen you may take your seats while I remain standing somebody shout hallelujah someone shout hallelujah this church I love this church because I can preach from 1947 to 1965 and this church you say Amen to the word what has brought us together is the message what will keep us together is the message what to separate us is the message so if you want to make me happy give me this message Hallelujah this church is not a Pentecostal church it's not a gathering of chickens this is a gathering of spiritual Eagles Hallelujah we are not feeding on the son of men but we are feeding on the body word of the son of man amen of Christ himself so I'm going to speak on the Supreme token this evening and uh I trust that the Lord will be of help so in the message token read this quote to you brother Branham says in the message talking 63 11 2 8 evening message paragraph 42 he says a token he says the blood shall be unto you a token a sign according to Webster a sign of a prize that has been paid a token is the sign that a price has been paid so the token is not the price it is this sign that shows that the price has been paid are we together when you go to Zimbabwe where I come from there are certain shops they don't allow you to use the literal money that you have but you use certain coins that they call tokens for you to purchase what you want or in exchange of the dollar so that you are able to get whatever you want are we together so it's a sign that your money has been accepted in that shop so we are talking about design and we know because we don't have time I'll just rush to the word so the light going forth in the evening time that we are living in right now revealing Jesus Christ is the talking us today Hallelujah that's the true token and it's a positive token I don't just want a talking I want a true token because our God he is the way he is the word and he is the lamp he is the atonement himself what a perfect token for us in this hour now before you can have the token in the time of Exodus night you needed to have the blood if you didn't have the blood there was not talking for you for you to have the blood you ought to head the lamp Allelujah any other blood was acceptable if you had the blood of the Lamb and we thank God today that Christ has become the lamp again he was identified by John in the morning time as the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world so the lamp in the beginning is identified again as the lamb that was slain that came and took the book in other words the lamp in the beginning is the lamp in the end time the word in the beginning is the word in the end time the Target in the beginning is the token in the end time the holy ghost in the beginning is the holy ghost in the end time the bride in the beginning is the bright in the end time the cloud in the beginning is the cloud in the end time the message in the beginning is the message in the end time someone shouted the token Hallelujah so the lamb that was slain took the book and there's the blood for a token and I've got good news for you Texas this this evening the lamp is here if the lamp is here it means the blood is here if the blood is here it means the token is here if the token is here it is The Exodus is on Hallelujah Christ on Mount Sunset is here the revealed word is here the bleeding word is here the evening time is here Redemption Time Is Here therefore you can apply the token hallelujah it's gonna be good here tonight I can feel it already so at the time of Exodus God required a left for a house it was not just one lamp for one family member but it was a lamp for the whole house Jesus the Lamb of God sufficient was not sufficient for one family member but you are sufficient for Zacchaeus in his whole house he said this day is salvation come into your house it was what it was one Zacchaeus who repented it was one Zacchaeus who said if I've taken anything from you by false I'll return it fourfold but when the answer came from Jesus it didn't cover Zacchaeus alone it was ill and for the whole house it was one Rahab who received the lamb message it was one Rahab who received the tech boys it was one Rahab who received the coming king of Israel but she received so the blood of Jesus Hallelujah before I got there it was also one Cornelius who who had abandoned oh Jesus it was one Cornelius who prayed and when Peter came his whole house it was one Jacob who got convicted and who saw the power of God and he said what can I do to be saved and he says Paul says believe God that you and your house so it's a lamp for a house so your children have been given to you by the word of God that is what the Bible says so God knows that you never be happy rejoicing in the Holy Ghost when Prada is outside God knows that you never come to church rejoicing as long as your father is outside so this talking is for you your family this message is not looking for you alone Hallelujah but it's for your mother it's for your brother it's for your sister it's for your uncle Hallelujah so at Pentecost when the word was preached the Bible says they were pricked in their hearts not the children but the fathers they were prayed in their hearts they said what can we do to be saved he said repent and when you repent you shall be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you receive the Holy Ghost it's for you fathers and your children so tonight I want to tell you my brother my sister in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by the authority of God's word I give you your house Allelujah apply the token upon your house apply the talking upon your mother apply the talking upon your children I apply the talking upon your grandchildren hallelujah oh holy spirit that dwells in me go after my sister go after my brother go after my children the same God who said a lamp for a house will bring your relatives in Hallelujah so the blood is the lamp Hallelujah the blood of the Lamb is a token and the token is the climax of any Ministry 18 hour of judgment the token is displayed how can I be happy to be raptured without my wife how can I be happy to be raptured without my children and my brothers and my sisters but the token is good drawing power Hallelujah so in Genesis chapter number 22 where we read Isaac had a question he said where is the lamp so that question went on for Generations Moses gave them lamps to sacrifice but still that was never satisfactory Moses ordained the sacrificial lamb but still that was never satisfactory so after so many years John the Baptist sees the Lamb of God and points from the Lamb of Abraham's great great children so when Isaac asked the question he asked Abraham and Abraham answered and said the Lord himself Isaac says we are here on top of the mountain where is the sacrifice you know what the answer Father Abraham gave he said the Lord himself Hallelujah not a priest not Moses but the Lord himself shall become the lamb in other words the Lord himself will provide another office of himself to take care of the sins of the world Hallelujah you you provide himself you change his form or another office of himself to take away the sin of the world so when Jesus came the prophet eyes of the eagle John spotted Jesus and he says behold the token when John saw Jesus he said oh my this is the crowning of my Ministry I was sent to foreign is coming Hallelujah I told you that someone greater than me is coming Hallelujah when I spoke about him now he's here the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world then the church Angels came through and the lamp disappeared from the scene or from the physical sin and the lamp vanished from the physical scene so by the time of the opening of The Book of redemption he says who is worthy to open the book and no one was found worthy and then one of the elders said whip not John behold the lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed he is worthy my God to take the book so John looked for the lion but he never saw the lion he saw the Lamb of God hallelujah and then John says okay he's got to be a lamp before he rose like a lion my God my God who of us here ever thought that before you roll like a lion you have to become the lamb first then after a while Hallelujah God will come and help you to be matured like what the pastor was saying hallelujah so the lamb came and took the book and reviewed the seals so in the book of Exodus the lamb was given the blood thereof for a token so when Isaac brought his question Abraham's answer was manifested on the River Jordan am I communicating John answered Isaac's question now at the time of the opening of The Seven Seals which is in this day the book of redemption is revealed Again by the lamp therefore I can say the identification of the lamp in this end type is the climax of The End Time message it cannot go beyond the identification of Christ Hallelujah this message cannot Advance beyond the opening of the seals you can say what about the rapturement of God that's what the seals is all about there's no other Rapture that you're ever going to besides what was spoken in the opening of the seals we are not waiting for the manifestation of the rapture the Rapture is not a one-day event the Rapture is a process you are raptured before you are raptured Enoch was ruptured before he was raptured he was walking with God he was walking with God and one day he got into another higher Dimension I'm no longer operating from Texas I'm no longer operating from America I'm now operating from that third pool Realm Allelujah I'm in the word and the word is in me I'm in the third pool and the third pool is in me I'm in the Rapture and the Rapture is in me brother I'm in the spoken word and the spoken word is in me you already raptured that's why you are saying amen because there is something in you when you hear about New Jerusalem oh I hear my theophany calling Hallelujah brother before you are changed you start rejoicing because there is a substance of what you are hoping for give God a shot of praise you already raptured but the Rapture is not going to you're not just going to walk in the streets of Bedford and the Rapture will just happen no no no no no no no no no we are told that it's going to be a secret are you the Bride of Jesus Christ hallelujah it's not something that we are my God let me tell you something this is coming fresh now now listen listen to this the Bible says behold I come as a thief at night are we together so in if a thief comes at my house at 3am he has already come when he gets by the gate he has already come when he enters into the house and sees an iPhone he has already come when he takes the phone and puts in the pocket and go he has already come are we together are we together so when you wake up in the morning and you find the phone is not there the thief has already come in 1963 the thief came and he was doing what he was doing he was doing what he was doing he was changing me brother he was changing me Hallelujah so the thief has already come Allelujah oh you no longer smoke you no longer do this you no longer take drugs you no longer drink Hallelujah if you confess your sins and make your life right God does not remember you can come to God and keep on confessing the same sins brother you are wasting your precious time God does not even remember that you ever did it what is under the blood is under the blood Hallelujah God does not remember brother Branham under the gift of discernment if you come in the line when he's descending after you've confessed since God was not showing him the confessed sins are we together because what is under the blood is under the blood that's how powerful it is Hallelujah in that blood is our Supreme token you are Justified you are cleared your case has been dismissed if you accept Jesus tonight is your personal Lord and Savior if you confess your sins and make your life right you are clean and you are wise By the Waters of the word God does not remember who is Worthy and nobody was found worthy Hallelujah isn't it strange brothers and sisters that the lamp took our place an innocent limp the Bible did not even say a sheep the lamp is the young one of a sheep that's what took our place Hallelujah the Bible says at that day you shall know that I am in the father and the father is in me brother if I had a board here I was going to draw a big circle and I'll write God on it inside that Circle I draw a circle then I'll write Christ on it inside that smaller say I drew another smaller Circle in the right brother calebunion so before the devil touches you he has to go through God get to Christ before he touches you in other words he has got to be justified and he's going to be Sanctified and he's going to receive the Holy Ghost when he receive the Holy Ghost he's already your brother Hallelujah so the devil cannot touch you Hallelujah you are unconquerable we are eternally secured a Believer has got nothing to worry about you are protected you are surrounded by the Lord Jesus Christ and by the almighty God so brother sister God is not complete without you God is waiting on you Hallelujah Jesus is waiting on you so no devil can get a hold of you you are predestinated in your destination is predetermined I am going to heaven because I am supposed to go to heaven I will be raptured because I am meant to be raptured because you are meant to overcome adultery you will be changed because you are meant to be changed brother there is something in you Hallelujah that when you hear you when you hear the word being preached you hear your theophany calling so don't worry you are predestinated unto perfection you are predestinated to overcome Texas spirits you are predestinated to overcome pornography you are predestined to overcome the world the one who overcame is in you are we together so the devil cannot touch you Hallelujah if was not destroyed I will be raptured because I saw my name in the book in the last book of life when John saw his name nobody could tell him shut up John he says everything in heaven the sharks in the sea the walls in the sea they had me saying hallelujah brother when it gets on me I feel like shouting Hallelujah when it gets on me I feel like shouting thank you Jesus for the message of the hour thank you Jesus for sending Malachi 4 thank you Jesus for our pastor thank you Jesus for Mount Sunset Hallelujah when you speak it's no longer you speaking but it's the book speaking in you Hallelujah today I want to look at the Devil with the fierceness of faith on my face I don't say by faith I shall be healed that's not the caliber of the Believers Hallelujah faith is not a little timid hope say God I shall be by faith I shall be healed before the foundation of the world I received my healing before the foundation of the world I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is the just the manifestation if you see me shouting today I didn't start now I started before the devil was the devil whoa Saturn he's got six thousand years of existence but I've got eternity years oh Hallelujah before Lucifer was Lucifer before high blood pressure was there I was in the mind of God before cancer was there I was in the mind of God before covid-19 came I was in the mind of God hallelujah when Michael stood and with the almighty God I was there when Abraham fought with chadeloma and prevailed I was there how can I worry about the 2022 demon when I defeated the devil before he was the devil Michael I'm on your side Hallelujah I know who I am do you know who you are whoa I work in power I work in Miracles I live a life of favor brother Abraham says when the bride knows who she is she can do the Greater Works Hallelujah I'm not only under the token but the talking is inside of me you are in the token Hallelujah and you become the token yourself Allelujah give God a clap offering do you know that if you are there in the time of Mary I've got 10 minutes remaining do you know that if you were there when Mary got pregnant of Jesus you are going to say how can God use a virgin with a brother are they not virgins without a brother you didn't hear me I said if you were there in the time of Mary when you heard or if you were to hear that there is a virgin who is in a relationship or dating a brother who is already probably widowed and you hear that that lady she's pregnant probably you were not going to believe it why would God choose a virgin with a brother who's already engaged brother let me tell you something God likes to hide himself in simplicity while they were arguing about Joseph and argue about Mount Sunset brother I know there's people who who say that cloud picture was there it is it's too far from me who said This Cloud picture is a rocket cloud brother if Rockets Cloud if rocket clouds can change me I need more rocket clouds because I can testify to you today that this message has healed me this message has chasing me this message has provided all my needs hallelujah oh brother there will never be any Elijah that Elijah Malachi four you can deny that there will never be any that Elijah Malachi for in the end it's doing me good brother I can feel it in my in my hands brother I can feel it in my body it's like Jeremiah he says it's like fire shutting my bones only believe is the Deadpool Ministry why cry speak and go forward if you want healing tonight may you be healed in the name of Jesus Christ the angel of the Lord who is here tonight we have the power in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah if you want promotion at work the message itself is enough for you to get whatever you want if you want healing the message itself oh let me tell you a small story we don't have time but listen the message of the hour I had another brother in Africa saying brother it's like my school fees because without this message brother we are strangers in Texas without this message I wouldn't be here tonight without this message we would be nothing out there thank God for the message of the hour we have the power in the name

inheritance this message is our heritage when two omnipotents meet what happens the miraculous who take place God is omnipotent and you are omnipotent then what happens the miraculous is gonna take place Hallelujah oh I thank God for this message I'm not rejoicing because I'm just an elder or a young man the Bible says the 24 Elders fell down at his feet and worshiped God so this evening from young to old when you get in the fellowship you should worship your God when do you worship Him before your breakthrough the children of Israel they were taught to blow their trumpets before the wars of Jericho fell so this evening before you are healed I want you to shout Where You Are before God gives you whatever your heart desires shout Where You Are before your cancer is destroyed Shout
