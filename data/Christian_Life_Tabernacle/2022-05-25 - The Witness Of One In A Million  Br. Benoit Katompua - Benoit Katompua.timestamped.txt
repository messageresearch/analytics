[32:45] amen
[32:46] amen we have a special guest speaker
[32:48] tonight
[32:50] amen you know i've
[32:52] i felt my heart that
[32:55] brother benoit had a gift
[32:58] in his life for a while and uh
[33:02] kind of
[33:03] listening to him and
[33:06] and then i would hear him say a few
[33:07] things and i would just know the lord
[33:10] was dealing with his heart and
[33:13] part of the reason that i had so much
[33:15] confidence in him
[33:17] is because i know the kind of home he
[33:19] was brought up yeah
[33:21] and you know his
[33:23] his
[33:24] father
[33:25] i've had conversations with him and
[33:28] things he says and the way he looks at
[33:30] things and he perceives a lot of things
[33:33] the way that i see him he's got an
[33:36] understanding for the word and what's
[33:38] the important part
[33:40] and you just know that some of those
[33:42] things are passed on so
[33:44] i was really excited
[33:47] and then
[33:48] we lord really confirmed something i'll
[33:51] let brother benoit
[33:53] share that part of it with you if he was
[33:56] but i i think we're in for a treat i
[33:58] guess this is his first time to to
[34:00] minister and
[34:02] i'm glad to be a part of it aren't you
[34:05] and i know he loves the people and i
[34:07] know the people of him
[34:08] said a real great testimony so we can
[34:11] rest in that so let's sing the song that
[34:13] every preacher should have the first
[34:16] time that he ministers

[36:55] [Music]
[36:57] well thank you musicians i'm just gonna
[36:59] get right into it
[37:14] you can have your seats for right now
[37:15] before i read this scripture
[37:17] so
[37:22] had this burning desire in my heart to
[37:26] share something for a while
[37:30] i was like
[37:31] if i let me call her brother let's talk
[37:33] let's fellowship about the word of god
[37:34] let's dive into what we've been feeding
[37:37] on
[37:39] and
[37:40] god works in mysterious ways
[37:43] and that desire that i had and then it
[37:45] grew to not just just calling one
[37:47] brother but i wanted to have
[37:49] the youth brothers come together and
[37:51] just fellowship on the ward and what we
[37:53] feed on
[37:54] and little did i know
[37:56] manasseh and daniel had the same thing
[37:59] put on their heart
[38:00] from god to
[38:02] have the youth come together the young
[38:04] men and just speak on what it is we feed
[38:06] because
[38:07] this message knows no age
[38:09] you can be 13 12 10 doesn't matter
[38:13] if you want to serve the lord and you
[38:14] want to speak about god go on ahead
[38:18] and i was sitting in my room two days
[38:21] ago
[38:22] just
[38:23] called brother david to have us get his
[38:25] blessing on that and
[38:26] we talked a little bit
[38:29] and then
[38:30] the next day jules
[38:34] sends me a quote
[38:36] at 9 23
[38:40] that was before you texted me yeah right
[38:43] before you detect an hour before you
[38:44] texted me
[38:49] so this this is just to let y'all know
[38:51] it's got nothing to do with me
[38:54] everything to do with him
[38:56] uh it says
[38:58] whether brandon preaches i don't know
[38:59] what sermon this is in he says hudson
[39:01] taylor one time you have never heard of
[39:03] hudson taylor the great missionary china
[39:06] there was a young indian boy he got
[39:08] saved said he had a call to ministry he
[39:11] come and said to mr taylor said mr
[39:13] taylor should i take four years of
[39:15] psychology and different things that he
[39:17] should do and how long will it take me
[39:20] to get my bachelor's of art
[39:22] mr taylor said to him said son don't
[39:25] never burn the candle half down before
[39:27] you start
[39:28] no
[39:29] that's what i think too don't wait till
[39:31] the candle is half burnt
[39:33] down in some kind of a schooling knocked
[39:34] into you some kind of embalming fluid
[39:37] don't do that but i say as soon as that
[39:39] candle is lit start
[39:41] i'm not trying to support ignorance but
[39:43] here is what i mean if you don't know
[39:45] nothing else
[39:47] tell him what lit the candle
[39:49] tell them what is burning in there just
[39:52] tell them how it got lit let them get
[39:54] lit they'll take care of it the rest of
[39:56] it certainly
[39:58] and that i was like wow
[40:01] that's good
[40:03] and uh
[40:04] i told him i said man that's powerful
[40:07] and he said yeah man i was thinking
[40:08] about you
[40:11] give me a sec here
[40:16] he said yeah i mean i'm thinking about
[40:18] you and i said well
[40:20] we had a conversation but miami not
[40:22] saying jules we went out to grab a bite
[40:24] to eat and
[40:26] they know it's not a shock i've always
[40:28] felt the call to
[40:30] to minister it's a hunger you can't
[40:32] explain
[40:33] you'd rather be sitting down there but
[40:35] something makes you feel like you're not
[40:37] serving god and how you're supposed to
[40:39] be
[40:39] as long as you're sitting there
[40:42] and we talked about it i said man i've
[40:44] ran my entire life
[40:46] i became an expert at running
[40:49] anytime i feel the desire to come or not
[40:51] i think to myself well i have to have
[40:53] all this knowledge first
[40:55] i have to know
[40:57] what land
[40:58] one foot on the land and what foot on
[41:00] the sea means
[41:01] i have to understand what the seven
[41:03] seals were from beginning to end i have
[41:05] to preach to you the restoration of the
[41:07] bride tree and different things and then
[41:09] that quote just said well that's your
[41:11] thinking
[41:12] but i want you to just say how it got
[41:14] laid i'll take care of the rest
[41:15] and we talked and they told me they said
[41:17] well
[41:18] you prayed you've got your confirmation
[41:20] over and over again yet you keep asking
[41:22] for more confirmation
[41:24] well i i wanted an audible voice but
[41:28] god gave me something that i couldn't
[41:29] refuse
[41:31] and refute and i told them i said if god
[41:33] opens the door i'll step in but david
[41:35] had teased on it a few
[41:37] a few years ago he said uh
[41:40] whenever you feel that you've got to put
[41:42] something in your heart for you to speak
[41:43] just let me know
[41:45] did i ever let you in know anything
[41:50] it goes to tell you
[41:51] i would have waited as long as i
[41:53] possibly could
[41:55] but
[41:57] blessed be the name of the lord
[42:00] so that's why i'm here right now
[42:02] standing before you
[42:04] and
[42:06] some of you know me personally some of
[42:08] you know me as just a brother at the
[42:09] church
[42:10] who loves the lord but
[42:12] when you stand here
[42:14] my heart's desire
[42:16] my entire life is
[42:17] don't look at me
[42:20] if anything it's it's what it is god put
[42:22] on my heart look to him because i've sat
[42:25] in services where
[42:28] a minister preaches a certain a certain
[42:31] title
[42:32] but what it is i have on my heart for
[42:34] god to speak to me is in a different
[42:36] direction and because of the desire i
[42:38] came with god pulls him
[42:40] to my need and speaks to where i'm at
[42:43] and i'm thankful for that
[42:44] let's stand and read the scripture and
[42:46] uh
[42:50] matthew 5
[42:51] starting from verse 13
[42:56] so i have the old schofield edition so
[42:58] they have a subtitle similitudes of the
[43:01] believer
[43:02] and that word similitude means the
[43:04] quality or state of being similar to
[43:06] something
[43:08] in other words the similarities or
[43:10] comparison of a believer
[43:13] it says ye are the salt of the earth
[43:16] but if the salt have lost its savior
[43:18] wherewith shall it be salted
[43:20] it is then forth good for nothing but to
[43:23] be cast out and to be trodden under foot
[43:25] of men
[43:26] ye are the light of the world
[43:29] a city that is set on a hill cannot be
[43:31] hid
[43:32] neither do men light a candle and put it
[43:34] under a bushel
[43:36] but
[43:37] on a candlestick
[43:39] and they give it light unto all that are
[43:41] in the house
[43:42] let your light so shine before men that
[43:45] they may see your good works and glorify
[43:47] your father which is in heaven
[43:50] may the lord have a blessing to his word
[43:52] amen
[43:55] you may be seated
[44:01] i want to read a quote from you from
[44:04] the sermon the witness preached in 1953
[44:12] let's see
[44:15] starting from paragraph
[44:17] 43.
[44:26] prophet of god said now in courts a
[44:27] witness has to know something
[44:30] just anybody can't come in and be a
[44:32] witness
[44:33] it's got to be somebody who knows
[44:35] something
[44:36] and that's the way it is when we are
[44:37] witnessing for the lord it takes
[44:39] somebody who knows something so jesus
[44:42] thought said this that before they could
[44:44] become his witness they had to wait in
[44:46] jerusalem until they were endued with
[44:49] power from on high
[44:50] then they would be the witness all over
[44:53] the world
[44:54] in jerusalem
[44:56] they would be the witness all over the
[44:58] world in jerusalem judea samaria and the
[45:02] uttermost parts of the earth in the
[45:03] courts
[45:04] there is two kind of witnesses
[45:06] that will stand that's eye or ear now if
[45:09] you're sitting in a room look through a
[45:11] glass and see an accident
[45:13] your witness your word is no good
[45:15] because you were looking through a glass
[45:17] you have to be right there close to
[45:20] really know what you're talking about
[45:22] before you can be a witness you have to
[45:24] hear it or you have to see it before you
[45:27] can be a witness on a severe case in
[45:29] courts
[45:30] you can't say miss so-and-so told me or
[45:33] mr so-and-so or reverend so-and-so told
[45:36] me he is a witness but you're not
[45:39] so therefore no man can exactly witness
[45:42] to the resurrection of christ
[45:44] only by the spirit you have to be a
[45:47] personal witness yourself
[45:49] being there knowing something about it
[45:52] knowing what you're talking about and
[45:54] god help us to see
[45:56] the day that when men will be just what
[45:58] they are you know i'ma say this now with
[46:01] all respect it isn't our city full of
[46:03] bootleg joints that's hurting us here is
[46:06] what's hurting us more than ever is
[46:08] people who are professing to be
[46:10] christians and not living like it that's
[46:13] the thing see
[46:14] they are not correct witness
[46:17] they are not a correct witness they
[46:19] can't witness until they have an
[46:21] experience and when they have an
[46:23] experience then they become a witness
[46:25] automatically because they are born
[46:28] again and all of the things of the world
[46:31] all things have passed away and all
[46:33] things have became new then you become a
[46:36] witness unto jesus
[46:39] now
[46:40] the thought that i had this morning that
[46:42] god put on my heart
[46:44] is uh
[46:45] just to share a little bit of
[46:47] my own my own testimony of how my candle
[46:49] got lit but the title he put on my heart
[46:51] was the witness of one in a million
[46:54] so
[46:55] when you read that quote
[46:57] the last sentence says
[46:58] then you become a witness unto
[47:01] jesus that word
[47:04] unto
[47:05] means in our understanding too
[47:08] but the definition of that means
[47:10] expressing motion in the direction of
[47:13] so there is a form of motion and
[47:16] expression that takes place when you
[47:17] were a true witness
[47:20] meaning
[47:21] reading that
[47:23] if you say you're a witness of god that
[47:26] god did something for you
[47:28] yet you go to school
[47:30] you go to work
[47:32] you go out shopping you do different
[47:33] stuff yet people can't see the
[47:35] expression of god in your life
[47:38] you're you're not a true witness there's
[47:40] a life an expression emotion that
[47:42] follows there's actions that show you
[47:45] knew the disciples were witnesses
[47:47] because they did the exact same works
[47:50] that jesus christ did so it's the same
[47:53] thing for us today when we receive the
[47:55] holy spirit of god we must do the same
[47:58] works it's the same life if
[48:00] it produces anything else then you know
[48:03] what's wrong but it has to be the same
[48:05] life
[48:07] it says
[48:09] so you can't say you're a witness if
[48:11] jesus christ isn't seeing your
[48:12] expressions in your everyday walk
[48:14] in other words the experience causes a
[48:16] change in your life to the point that
[48:18] your desire is to please god and he
[48:21] alone
[48:22] you don't want to sin not out of fear of
[48:24] going to hell but because you love god
[48:27] being an effective witness you heard the
[48:29] prophet it requires understanding that
[48:31] isn't second hand
[48:33] you can't go to a court where they're
[48:35] deciding on a murder case and say well
[48:37] this person told me that that person
[48:38] killed that person that's not valid
[48:40] you're just saying hearsay you have to
[48:42] be present for it to be something that
[48:44] can be taken in court
[48:46] so when you testify about what god's
[48:48] done in your life to a sinner or an
[48:49] unbeliever i can't say what my brother
[48:51] may not say in his life well god did
[48:53] this well then brother david god did
[48:55] this then they're asking so what did god
[48:57] do in your life because you're speaking
[48:59] of everybody else but what about
[49:01] yourself
[49:02] where is it that you find yourself in
[49:04] the word because if god if god's still
[49:06] the same yesterday today and forever the
[49:08] same god who did it for them can do the
[49:10] same for you
[49:12] [Music]
[49:16] i was just talk a little bit about
[49:19] myself where i continue
[49:23] came here from africa when i was about
[49:25] six years old
[49:27] my dad came a year before us and just to
[49:31] set up work and
[49:33] get
[49:34] constant flow of income before we came
[49:37] and
[49:38] just us coming here was
[49:40] miracles on miracles the grace of god
[49:42] from the money to
[49:43] getting accepted to come in here and
[49:45] everything like that was
[49:46] all the hand of god and
[49:49] i remember my mom told me since i was a
[49:51] since i was a kid when i was in her womb
[49:54] that uh
[49:55] in africa the way things are done is a
[49:57] lot different from what they are here
[49:59] and when i was in her womb
[50:01] somebody had a desire to kill me and my
[50:03] mom before i was even born
[50:05] but the keeping hand of god protected me
[50:08] and my mom
[50:10] and that's i'm grateful that because of
[50:12] that i'm able to stand here today so
[50:14] i i rest in that because it lets me know
[50:17] there was something that god intended
[50:19] for me to do
[50:20] and i
[50:22] if i'd have gone at that time i wouldn't
[50:24] be here today doing what it is god wants
[50:25] me to do
[50:26] i'm grateful for that
[50:29] and growing up
[50:31] i was
[50:32] if you ask anybody who knew me as a kid
[50:34] i was
[50:35] number one person in the office
[50:37] i was there every other day
[50:40] the principal had my name on her desk
[50:42] she knew my dad's number from heart
[50:46] i was one of those delinquents
[50:49] but you see when i at that age it's it's
[50:52] sort of not fear of getting in trouble
[50:56] but it was more so can i get away with
[50:58] it
[50:59] during that time
[51:01] but
[51:02] with time and through time things got
[51:04] better
[51:05] i would say my parents wouldn't but i
[51:07] would say
[51:09] and
[51:12] but that's all right that's all right
[51:15] fast forward to middle school i started
[51:18] to
[51:18] [Music]
[51:20] have a desire to play sports i wanted to
[51:23] do something my grades weren't looking
[51:24] too great
[51:25] and whatnot so i just knew i wanted to
[51:27] play sports and to have a policy here in
[51:29] texas that says no pass no play so if
[51:32] you don't pass you don't play so i
[51:33] started going to school not to learn but
[51:35] just so i could play sports
[51:37] so all i cared about was if i get the
[51:40] bare minimum then i can play
[51:42] but
[51:43] god wasn't satisfied with me getting the
[51:45] bare minimum so for most of my life in
[51:47] high school in the middle school i was
[51:49] getting a's and b's and playing sports i
[51:51] grew to have a desire and
[51:53] a longing and a heart for basketball
[51:54] that was the sport that
[51:57] i don't know i just it made sense to me
[51:58] to play
[52:00] my height
[52:01] everything
[52:02] i just it made sense i was started
[52:05] playing soccer but mom wanted me to play
[52:07] basketball because i kept growing out of
[52:09] my clothes
[52:10] so she said go on and play basketball i
[52:12] said well that's all right
[52:13] and i started playing i gained the love
[52:16] of basketball
[52:18] probably my freshman year
[52:20] and i remember we came the first time we
[52:21] came here to this church
[52:23] this is right after we went to my my
[52:26] first camp
[52:28] brother david asked me a question before
[52:29] he baptized me he said
[52:31] would you give it up for god if god
[52:33] asked
[52:34] and i said yes but in my heart of hearts
[52:37] i knew i wouldn't
[52:38] i knew all and that i wanted nothing
[52:40] more than to play basketball it wasn't
[52:42] in my mind it wasn't a selfish desire
[52:44] because i wanted to provide for my mom
[52:45] want to provide for my pops and my
[52:48] siblings and family back home in the
[52:49] congo and have them not worrying and
[52:52] if you know the salary of an nba player
[52:55] you're good
[52:58] that's what i had in mind
[53:01] but that's not what god had in mind
[53:04] and as my love for basketball grew and
[53:06] grew i remember sitting
[53:08] right there where i always sit with
[53:10] aaron up here
[53:12] preaching and every time you talk about
[53:14] sports he'd look at me
[53:16] and he'd speak
[53:17] i'm like condemned
[53:20] but
[53:22] it was coming in one year ago not the
[53:23] other
[53:24] all i cared about was how can i be the
[53:26] next lebron james that's what i had in
[53:28] mind
[53:30] and then
[53:31] it happened in 20
[53:34] 2017
[53:36] i started missing services on sundays
[53:39] and
[53:40] going to basketball tournaments and
[53:42] going to hang out with my friends my
[53:44] athlete friends and whatnot and i
[53:46] started seeing
[53:48] where my heart was at
[53:52] i wasn't yet completely s
[53:54] like
[53:55] sold into
[53:57] the message
[53:58] my heart was more so i knew it was true
[54:00] i couldn't deny it
[54:01] but my heart was more set on
[54:04] sports and the opportunities that sports
[54:06] could bring me
[54:07] and as i went to service after service
[54:10] camps after camp the lord started
[54:12] dealing with me to the point i started
[54:14] missing
[54:15] basketball games and practice and
[54:17] tournaments to come to church
[54:20] and my coach would always say
[54:22] when you come back you got to fight for
[54:23] your spot
[54:25] well i rested in the fact that
[54:27] when i came back it wasn't much of a
[54:29] fight
[54:31] he had no choice but to give me my spot
[54:33] back
[54:34] so every time i will leave and come back
[54:36] in one practice the next practice you're
[54:38] starting again i'm like well thank you
[54:39] coach thank you thank you very much
[54:41] and
[54:43] then it got to the point i got my first
[54:45] scholarship
[54:47] the
[54:48] naia school
[54:50] and um i started
[54:53] desiring and prayed for scholarship i
[54:54] said lord i want that d1 opportunity i
[54:56] want to be able to go next level give me
[54:58] the best chance to make it to the next
[54:59] level
[55:00] and because i asked and because i prayed
[55:03] for it
[55:04] god gave me my heart's desire
[55:06] he gave me the opportunity to go play
[55:09] at a school penn state gave me an offer
[55:11] to go play for them they were going to
[55:13] fly me out to go visit the
[55:15] campus visit the facilities visit the
[55:17] gym
[55:18] and everything and i was ecstatic i
[55:21] called my coach i was in the car
[55:23] with my friend on the way back from
[55:24] eating and i was a coach
[55:27] i'm out of here
[55:29] what you mean i said penn state's
[55:30] offering me he said wow congrats i'm
[55:32] like appreciate it he said more to come
[55:34] more to come i said wow that's good
[55:36] now this coach of mine
[55:38] plays a significant role in my testimony
[55:40] because throughout my entire high school
[55:42] life
[55:44] he was my figure of what it looked like
[55:45] to be
[55:48] a christian but in the world
[55:51] if that you
[55:53] if that makes sense
[55:56] if that makes sense
[55:58] because every single time before we
[56:01] played
[56:02] we'd all hold hands get in a circle
[56:05] our father who are in heaven hallowed be
[56:07] thy name thy kingdom we'd say the lord's
[56:09] prayer every time this guy's a christian
[56:11] christian hold on
[56:13] okay i like that
[56:14] and then every time and then every time
[56:16] we had banquets or whatnot it was always
[56:18] prayer first
[56:19] then eat
[56:20] i'm like man i want to be like that when
[56:22] i grow up
[56:24] then when i told him of what god dealt
[56:26] with my heart
[56:28] because what happened was i don't know
[56:30] exactly what took place but
[56:32] one day i'm 100 miles per hour going to
[56:35] penn state and going to pennsylvania
[56:37] that means in my mind i'd left all of
[56:39] you
[56:40] it was just going to be me
[56:43] ben was gonna do ben and live his life
[56:46] i quickly realized there is no such
[56:48] thing as my life
[56:50] but
[56:51] in that decision
[56:53] i listened to a sermon and then the next
[56:55] day i'm like coach
[56:57] that same coach that i made the
[57:00] the image of a christian worldly person
[57:03] and i told him i said coach
[57:06] i feel like i don't want to continue
[57:08] playing
[57:10] he said what do you mean
[57:11] i said well
[57:14] i'm worried that if i go
[57:16] i'm not going to be a christian
[57:18] and he said son that's crazy
[57:21] i was like what do you mean he said well
[57:23] your parents don't have a substantial
[57:25] amount of money to put you through
[57:26] college
[57:28] which is true
[57:30] you're
[57:31] in a minority that makes it hard for you
[57:33] to succeed according to his standards
[57:36] which according to society it's true
[57:40] and i started to think i said well
[57:42] he has some good solid points that he's
[57:44] making
[57:45] maybe i shouldn't just quit
[57:47] automatically but then that voice
[57:49] started dealing with me more and more
[57:51] and more and i remembered my junior year
[57:55] we went to second round of playoffs
[57:58] regionals
[57:59] and we played against a team southwest
[58:02] and
[58:03] that was by far the worst scoring game
[58:05] i've ever been a part of or seeing the
[58:08] final score was 23 to 14
[58:11] and
[58:12] nobody could score
[58:13] nobody could shoot anything nothing was
[58:16] falling i was shooting prayers every
[58:18] time i threw the ball up
[58:19] hoping it would go in but no
[58:22] nothing worked
[58:23] it was just
[58:25] god did not want us to win that's how i
[58:26] saw it
[58:28] god didn't want us to win
[58:30] and
[58:31] i come back home and those seniors
[58:32] graduate
[58:34] and i'm at home and i'm kind of
[58:35] depressed because a lot of them were
[58:37] like my big brothers my my people that i
[58:39] considered family that i cared about
[58:41] and they were going on and continuing
[58:44] with their life and here i was by myself
[58:46] with my with my teammates in the same
[58:48] grade as me
[58:49] and i was kind of depressed and sad
[58:51] because we broke the school record had
[58:53] the most wins
[58:54] we beat a team 119 like everything was
[58:57] just amazing that year and for it to end
[59:00] that way
[59:01] and my dad
[59:03] a passing comment
[59:05] he has a way of with words he does it on
[59:07] purpose i think
[59:08] but
[59:09] he's
[59:10] i'm walking
[59:12] and my mom sees me and she my mom
[59:15] she's my biggest supporter yet my
[59:17] biggest hater
[59:19] because
[59:20] if i didn't play good or we lost
[59:23] she'd be like oh
[59:25] you lost you should have played better
[59:30] thanks mom
[59:32] but she was my number one supporter went
[59:34] to every game she could
[59:36] and
[59:37] there she was picking on me and whatnot
[59:39] and i'm here i'm sad and depressed with
[59:41] the tear in my eye
[59:42] and my dad walks and he tells me
[59:45] ben
[59:46] let me tell you something
[59:48] you'll cry for basketball
[59:52] for worldly things
[59:54] but for god you won't shed a tear
[59:58] i said wow
[1:00:01] we went biblical okay
[1:00:05] and it was that that moment right there
[1:00:09] that kept playing in my mind when my
[1:00:10] coach asked me and i told him i said i
[1:00:12] want to give it up because i know see i
[1:00:15] started out saying i don't think but
[1:00:16] then it became i know i won't be a
[1:00:18] christian if i go over there and
[1:00:20] continue playing
[1:00:21] and this worldly christian says
[1:00:26] why are you worried about your salvation
[1:00:27] at such a young age
[1:00:31] caught me by surprise i said coach hold
[1:00:33] on
[1:00:34] we pray we fellowship we talk about the
[1:00:36] word of god and everything here i'm
[1:00:38] thinking you got my best interest at
[1:00:40] heart
[1:00:41] then he tells me
[1:00:42] why you're about to salvation said young
[1:00:44] guy i said coach if i die tomorrow what
[1:00:46] does that mean
[1:00:47] that the age means nothing at that point
[1:00:49] he said yeah but you know give give it a
[1:00:51] little bit of time you know
[1:00:53] go to school play sports have fun
[1:00:56] then start living your life
[1:00:59] and everything
[1:01:01] but
[1:01:02] someone wasn't sitting with with that
[1:01:04] statement
[1:01:05] start living your life
[1:01:07] is it really my life if at any point
[1:01:10] god forbid somebody would take a gun or
[1:01:13] something and point it at me and pull
[1:01:15] the trigger
[1:01:16] at that point is it my life because they
[1:01:18] hold it in their hands now
[1:01:20] is it my life if an accident takes place
[1:01:23] and i die
[1:01:24] what separates me from one who makes the
[1:01:26] accident and one who dies at that point
[1:01:28] is it my life and i realized this thing
[1:01:31] that we call my life is a grace from god
[1:01:34] it's a gift from him
[1:01:36] it's not my life but it's his
[1:01:39] so unless i seek his purpose
[1:01:42] his reason for putting me here
[1:01:46] thing always rings in my mind i look at
[1:01:48] my classmates in my classrooms and
[1:01:49] different stuff and i'm like what makes
[1:01:51] him different from me why is it i was
[1:01:53] born in this message
[1:01:55] why is it i know who the prophet is
[1:01:57] why is it that i can't do these certain
[1:01:59] things that they do
[1:02:03] for a period of my life i was trying to
[1:02:04] understand what it was it meant to be a
[1:02:08] christian what it meant to live a life
[1:02:10] consecrated on god
[1:02:12] and i quickly realized
[1:02:14] if he gave me this gift he can take it
[1:02:16] away just as quick as he gave it to me
[1:02:18] so let me do my due diligence
[1:02:21] and
[1:02:22] leave that life of sports
[1:02:24] and focus on god see i was never
[1:02:27] a party person i never went to much
[1:02:29] parties i went to one party my teammates
[1:02:32] birthday party that was the only party i
[1:02:34] ever went to in high school in terms of
[1:02:36] that was thrown by friends i went to one
[1:02:38] homecoming
[1:02:39] my freshman year
[1:02:41] and then
[1:02:42] sophomore junior and senior year didn't
[1:02:44] go to homecoming i didn't go to prom my
[1:02:46] senior year either i just i didn't see
[1:02:49] the point some didn't sit right with me
[1:02:50] they're not playing my kind of music so
[1:02:52] why would i attend
[1:02:54] and
[1:02:55] to me it was just an
[1:02:57] easy
[1:02:58] answer
[1:02:59] not to say that if you win everything
[1:03:01] that you're wrong you know the way god
[1:03:02] dealt with me was don't go
[1:03:04] so i didn't go
[1:03:06] so i didn't really struggle much with
[1:03:08] some of the stuff that most youth people
[1:03:10] struggle with but there were things that
[1:03:12] i struggled with
[1:03:13] and
[1:03:15] i when i compare my testimonies to the
[1:03:17] others that i know who've had the drug
[1:03:19] problems who've had those issues and
[1:03:21] whatnot i look and say what kind of
[1:03:23] testimony do i have i didn't deal with
[1:03:25] that stuff
[1:03:26] but the thing i came to realize is the
[1:03:29] battle god gave them was to bring a
[1:03:31] character out of them
[1:03:32] i can't desire the same character they
[1:03:34] have god has something he wants to bring
[1:03:36] out of me that's personal to me
[1:03:40] and
[1:03:41] after i decided i said lord you know
[1:03:42] what i'll serve you and i heard a
[1:03:45] burning hearts desire on my heart to god
[1:03:47] put on my heart so i was a kid
[1:03:49] everybody would always call me preacher
[1:03:52] minister
[1:03:53] and i just laugh and joke and say well
[1:03:55] y'all got it but i quickly realized
[1:04:00] this desire that i have and this
[1:04:02] thing that people see i didn't
[1:04:04] understand it because i i could be in a
[1:04:06] in a room with a bunch of message
[1:04:08] brothers and testifying to somebody or
[1:04:10] speaking to somebody and they say
[1:04:13] something
[1:04:14] nobody says anything in terms of always
[1:04:17] supposed to be a preacher but the moment
[1:04:18] i open my mouth oh you're supposed to be
[1:04:20] a preacher that's unfair because he said
[1:04:22] something in fact his sounded better but
[1:04:25] i'm the no
[1:04:27] it i just i couldn't believe it i said
[1:04:29] no i didn't want that
[1:04:31] and then
[1:04:32] i prayed and prayed i said lord if this
[1:04:34] is your will i remember i went to a camp
[1:04:36] i said lord this is your world when i go
[1:04:37] up there for prayer let the minister
[1:04:40] speak to me and tell me that i'm called
[1:04:43] i get up there little joe adams goes
[1:04:46] lord let him know he's a minister
[1:04:48] i said lord that's not enough
[1:04:51] so
[1:04:52] that's one but i needed seven more
[1:04:55] checks before i knew
[1:04:57] and then an october meeting is the year
[1:04:59] after
[1:05:01] here i am battling with the same thing
[1:05:02] lord i feel this call the more i run
[1:05:07] the more sin is near
[1:05:10] it it was a weird thing i want to serve
[1:05:12] god i try to live right
[1:05:14] but as long as i wasn't in my place
[1:05:17] the devil had a way to get at me
[1:05:21] and i'm like well guys something's wrong
[1:05:23] i'm like i know that i know this desire
[1:05:25] is there but it can't be me please
[1:05:28] i i know what the life of a minister
[1:05:31] what they go through and different stuff
[1:05:33] and whatnot i y'all do y'all see what
[1:05:35] y'all did to brother david
[1:05:38] like he had a full set of hair and um
[1:05:41] you know
[1:05:42] and
[1:05:44] i was like well i
[1:05:46] no i can't be me
[1:05:48] and then i go to october meetings and i
[1:05:52] go up there for prayer again i said lord
[1:05:54] speak to me
[1:05:56] brother aaron oglesby goes
[1:06:00] lord
[1:06:01] confirm it in his heart
[1:06:03] that he is a minister
[1:06:07] i said god what are you doing to me
[1:06:10] i just want to sit in the pew
[1:06:12] and listen and say amen and praise the
[1:06:14] lord but you want more from me
[1:06:17] i'm i don't understand so then it got to
[1:06:19] the point where i said lord i accept
[1:06:21] what it is that you're asking me to do
[1:06:23] if you want me to minister that's fine
[1:06:27] but lord i don't have the
[1:06:29] tools necessary
[1:06:31] to minister
[1:06:35] and then i just in my own prayers saying
[1:06:38] that i felt dumb
[1:06:40] saying i don't have the tools necessary
[1:06:41] as if i had to get tools myself
[1:06:45] to preach or to say anything
[1:06:47] it's got nothing to do with me
[1:06:50] then
[1:06:51] then the i heard the brother brother
[1:06:52] branham say
[1:06:54] in a sermon and he just started dealing
[1:06:56] with me just conti every sermon i
[1:06:58] listened to he would hit the point on
[1:07:00] being called i listened to a man running
[1:07:02] from the face of god i felt condemned
[1:07:04] from beginning to end
[1:07:05] but brother brennan makes a statement
[1:07:07] he says
[1:07:09] god doesn't call the equipped he equips
[1:07:11] the called
[1:07:13] and i said wow now i really can't run
[1:07:17] and i
[1:07:18] pray that i talk with man i say and she
[1:07:20] brothers a lot about what it is god put
[1:07:22] on my heart
[1:07:23] and it was always one of those that's
[1:07:25] you not me
[1:07:27] i'm like wow no support that's crazy
[1:07:31] but they they weren't wrong if god puts
[1:07:34] a call on your heart
[1:07:36] the more you run the harder it gets and
[1:07:38] the more he pulls
[1:07:40] eventually when he pulls you into the
[1:07:41] office that he wants
[1:07:44] you're finally at peace that mind battle
[1:07:46] that you had if is this the right places
[1:07:48] it's not because i was anxious back
[1:07:50] there and when brother david told me to
[1:07:52] say something
[1:07:53] i thought i was gonna die my my heart
[1:07:55] was just
[1:07:56] beating quick but as i'm here i'm at
[1:07:59] peace
[1:08:00] not because
[1:08:02] of anything that i did
[1:08:04] or anything but when i was studying and
[1:08:07] trying to pull
[1:08:08] quotes and
[1:08:11] scriptures together that spoke to what
[1:08:13] it is that god put on my heart things
[1:08:15] just started coming by themselves
[1:08:17] i didn't have to search
[1:08:19] or anything god just go here go there go
[1:08:22] there so i'm certain whatever it is that
[1:08:24] i say
[1:08:26] is what god intended for me to say and
[1:08:29] whatever i don't say
[1:08:31] he didn't want me to say
[1:08:33] and i leave it at that
[1:08:35] and i said lord
[1:08:37] if this is your will then i'll step in
[1:08:39] and
[1:08:41] i'll do what it is that you ask of me
[1:08:43] and i was talking i talked to men asking
[1:08:44] them i said well if god opens the door
[1:08:46] then let it be so then
[1:08:52] brother
[1:08:54] gary stinky
[1:08:57] and your mom
[1:08:59] she pulls me at the wedding
[1:09:02] she goes you're going to be a preacher
[1:09:03] boy
[1:09:06] i said what are you talking about he
[1:09:07] said i heard your testimony you're going
[1:09:09] to be a preacher
[1:09:10] i said um i pray for me
[1:09:13] she said i'm gonna pray for you i'm
[1:09:15] gonna pray for you
[1:09:16] then
[1:09:17] things just started happening so fast
[1:09:20] these past two weeks and whatnot
[1:09:22] where something was just pulling and
[1:09:25] pushing and pulling and pushing
[1:09:28] getting me to just
[1:09:29] consecrate more and more time into
[1:09:31] feeding and reading and listening and
[1:09:34] studying and meditating
[1:09:36] and everything and i said wow i have
[1:09:37] this desire in me i just want to share
[1:09:40] everything god put on my heart
[1:09:42] and
[1:09:44] just to give a little testimony before i
[1:09:45] get on the
[1:09:47] on this subject that god put on my heart
[1:09:49] but i was uh working with
[1:09:51] emmanuel
[1:09:52] we're working a a job my uncle gave me
[1:09:55] to help people close containers to send
[1:09:57] to africa
[1:09:58] and we worked from 4 30 till about 8 30
[1:10:02] ish
[1:10:03] what not intense labor in a container
[1:10:05] that is hot
[1:10:07] uh we were almost dying we were hungry
[1:10:09] we hadn't eaten anything
[1:10:11] and we were on our way back to drop me
[1:10:13] off at the house
[1:10:15] and
[1:10:16] we stop at the gas station
[1:10:20] and
[1:10:22] i've had these moments in my life where
[1:10:24] the still small voice speaks
[1:10:27] and i've quieted it for a long time when
[1:10:29] it tells me to do something
[1:10:32] but i realize the more you'll quiet it
[1:10:34] so much to the point where you won't
[1:10:35] ever hear it again
[1:10:38] so
[1:10:39] take heed when that voice talks and
[1:10:40] tells you to do something because or
[1:10:42] else you'll have to answer for it
[1:10:45] and we're at the gas station and we're
[1:10:46] just sitting there putting gas and a
[1:10:48] homeless man walks by
[1:10:50] on emmanuel's window he has a gold chain
[1:10:53] in his hand and a lighter
[1:10:55] and he leans over this is an old man had
[1:10:57] to be over
[1:10:59] well i would say over 70
[1:11:02] but drugs age you like 38 30 years so
[1:11:06] he could have been 90 or something like
[1:11:08] that
[1:11:09] but he was real old hunched back like
[1:11:11] wrinkly wrinkled just walking over there
[1:11:14] with the gold chain and the lighter and
[1:11:16] he goes
[1:11:18] say son
[1:11:20] you got i need money and he turns on the
[1:11:22] lighter he says i
[1:11:24] this is a real gold chain i need six
[1:11:26] hundred dollars for if you could just if
[1:11:28] you could just
[1:11:29] pay me please
[1:11:31] and i i looked at emmanuel
[1:11:34] and he looked at me and i said
[1:11:36] brother we don't wear chains
[1:11:38] and he says and he says well that's all
[1:11:40] right you have a dollar
[1:11:41] i'm like i wish i did i i have this bad
[1:11:44] habit i don't hold cash
[1:11:47] uh everything's always on my card i
[1:11:49] don't know why i'm the way that i am but
[1:11:50] i just don't hold cash and emanuel
[1:11:52] didn't have anything in his wallet
[1:11:54] either or in his car
[1:11:56] and the old man said you got nothing it
[1:11:58] was like nah he said that's all right
[1:12:00] and he walks by
[1:12:02] then i heard a voice
[1:12:04] see this is why i think it's important
[1:12:08] when your brother brenham talks about a
[1:12:09] witness
[1:12:11] a witness is only effective if he gets
[1:12:13] up there and speaks
[1:12:16] as long as he doesn't speak
[1:12:18] everything that took place
[1:12:20] everything that he saw is of none effect
[1:12:24] and in that moment right when he walked
[1:12:26] by a voice spoke to me and said you
[1:12:28] claim you're a message believer
[1:12:29] you claim you serve the living god you
[1:12:32] claim you know the way to heaven
[1:12:34] yet
[1:12:35] there was your moment
[1:12:38] to say something to him
[1:12:40] and you let it pass by but right before
[1:12:43] he passed the car i called him sir could
[1:12:44] you come back could you come back could
[1:12:45] you come back
[1:12:47] i said can i pray for you
[1:12:49] and he said sure i said give me your
[1:12:50] hand please he gave me his hand
[1:12:53] and as i was praying the scripture came
[1:12:55] into my mind silver and gold have i not
[1:12:58] but that which i have give i unto you
[1:13:00] see i don't know what god's going to do
[1:13:02] for him
[1:13:03] i don't know if god's going to bless him
[1:13:05] with an abundant amount of money or
[1:13:07] whatnot but i did my part
[1:13:09] in terms of lord told me to do something
[1:13:12] and i did it
[1:13:13] and we started sitting there in the car
[1:13:14] and and man i say no and emanuel we were
[1:13:17] talking and we just started to
[1:13:19] fellowship about we get so in our own
[1:13:22] mind in our own state of being with
[1:13:24] everything we got going on
[1:13:26] well i got word cut this time i wake up
[1:13:28] at so and so time got to pick up this
[1:13:29] person at that time i got this this than
[1:13:31] the other you can get so busy in life
[1:13:34] that you don't leave room for god to
[1:13:35] operate
[1:13:37] then you realize your life starts to get
[1:13:38] kind of lukewarm you don't see god in
[1:13:40] your life you don't see the move of the
[1:13:42] spirit well maybe if you stood back and
[1:13:44] stood still
[1:13:46] maybe you'd hear something or you'd see
[1:13:48] something
[1:13:50] but we sat back and we thought we said
[1:13:51] wow we're so fortunate we hear so many
[1:13:54] times with people who are poor less
[1:13:56] needy we don't have the the the best
[1:13:58] house we don't have access to a
[1:13:59] substantial amount of money this is
[1:14:01] meaning manual talking to each other and
[1:14:03] we said but we have a roof over a head
[1:14:04] we have clothes on our back we have
[1:14:06] shoes on our feet we have food
[1:14:08] that's a homeless man who has nothing if
[1:14:10] i can't give them anything
[1:14:12] physical how if i give him the kingdom
[1:14:15] of god he won't have need of anything
[1:14:17] else
[1:14:18] that's that's all he'll ever need
[1:14:20] and we just started talking and talking
[1:14:21] talking about how sometimes we're
[1:14:24] selfish we we go to a store because we
[1:14:26] have stuff to shop for but we don't stop
[1:14:28] and think maybe somebody's here for me
[1:14:30] to speak to we're just so caught up in
[1:14:32] our mind and what we got going on
[1:14:35] and the thought that god put on my heart
[1:14:37] was
[1:14:39] the witness of
[1:14:40] one in a million and i want to go to
[1:14:47] oh god
[1:14:52] i want to go to
[1:14:56] i remember one time brother david was
[1:14:58] preaching
[1:15:00] and he made a statement
[1:15:02] he said
[1:15:04] jesus christ had to be tempted in every
[1:15:06] way possible
[1:15:09] and he was because that's the only way
[1:15:11] he could really say i know what it feels
[1:15:14] like
[1:15:15] he couldn't say that as god the spirit
[1:15:18] he had to become flesh
[1:15:20] face the same things we face
[1:15:22] so that when we receive his spirit we
[1:15:25] have the assurance
[1:15:26] that we will overcome not by our own
[1:15:29] power but because greater is he that is
[1:15:31] in me than he that is in the world
[1:15:34] if he wasn't tempted in every way he
[1:15:36] would have just been a survivor
[1:15:39] but no he's an overcomer
[1:15:42] because he overcame the flesh
[1:15:44] that's our champion he overcame death
[1:15:46] hell in the grave not for himself
[1:15:49] but for us
[1:15:51] to redeem back his bride that's why the
[1:15:53] bible says in romans 8 33 34
[1:15:57] let's just turn to that
[1:16:12] it says who shall lay anything to the
[1:16:14] charge of god's elect
[1:16:17] it is god that justifieth who is he that
[1:16:20] commandeth it is christ that died
[1:16:22] ye rather that is risen again
[1:16:25] who is even at the right hand of god who
[1:16:27] also make it intercession for us
[1:16:30] why why that for me that hit me hard was
[1:16:33] because
[1:16:34] a lot of times especially
[1:16:36] young people and whatnot
[1:16:39] we struggle when we see our parents
[1:16:41] or anybody because we hear the prophet
[1:16:43] say that as the days go by and the ages
[1:16:45] go by it's going to be 10 times worse
[1:16:47] than the age before
[1:16:48] so we get in the mindset where you think
[1:16:50] well dad don't understand what i'm going
[1:16:51] through mom don't get what i'm going
[1:16:53] through that deacon don't know what i'm
[1:16:54] going through he doesn't know what i'm
[1:16:56] going through but god knows
[1:16:58] but
[1:16:59] we can't seem to see that
[1:17:01] god was tempted in every way for that
[1:17:03] purpose
[1:17:04] the message he sent is perfect doesn't
[1:17:07] matter how much longer we have whether
[1:17:09] it's ten more years or whatever this
[1:17:11] message will stay the same and produce
[1:17:13] the same thing it was meant to produce
[1:17:16] which is a god-centered life
[1:17:20] and
[1:17:22] when you receive his spirit
[1:17:24] you can't help yourself from testifying
[1:17:28] remember the scripture read in the
[1:17:29] beginning neither do men light a candle
[1:17:31] and put it under a bushel but on a
[1:17:33] candlestick
[1:17:34] and it giveth the light onto all that
[1:17:36] are in the house
[1:17:39] now that's man
[1:17:41] man's capability of the light that he
[1:17:43] can produce
[1:17:44] can only turn on a city
[1:17:46] a house
[1:17:48] some small
[1:17:49] but
[1:17:51] you hear the prophet say it was spoken
[1:17:53] that in the evening time there shall be
[1:17:55] light
[1:17:56] that light is greater than the lights
[1:17:58] you see here
[1:18:00] because what that light does it causes a
[1:18:02] man who sends them schools constantly
[1:18:04] moving his way towards hell because
[1:18:06] brother
[1:18:07] brother branham says god does not send
[1:18:10] no man to hell man sends himself to hell
[1:18:12] so you can be at the doorstep of hell
[1:18:14] knocking but
[1:18:16] when that light gets a hold of you
[1:18:18] when just just that voice when you hear
[1:18:21] it for the first time it pulls you out
[1:18:24] from where you were it's not
[1:18:27] i want to say this correct
[1:18:29] it's not brother branham pulling you out
[1:18:33] he's not speaking of himself
[1:18:37] all he wanted to do was point you to
[1:18:39] christ
[1:18:41] he's the one that has the power to do it
[1:18:43] all and i can look back in my condition
[1:18:45] when i hear testimonies brother matthew
[1:18:47] give his brother jackson brother cosman
[1:18:50] there's a theme in that it didn't matter
[1:18:52] how far they got
[1:18:55] because they were a seed of god
[1:18:57] it was already settled
[1:18:59] nothing they could have done
[1:19:01] nothing they could have tried to do
[1:19:03] would have worked
[1:19:04] because god chose them in this in the
[1:19:07] sermon christ the mr god revealed
[1:19:09] brother branham says
[1:19:11] jesus christ god chose you in christ
[1:19:15] before eve ever fell
[1:19:17] so that takes anything you do now out of
[1:19:19] the equation because you were chosen
[1:19:22] then not now
[1:19:23] he made you perfect then
[1:19:25] so you're telling me
[1:19:27] i'm i'm living a life of sin i feel like
[1:19:29] i can't overcome i feel like i can't get
[1:19:31] the victory i know i'm a billy i know
[1:19:33] what the message is real i know what the
[1:19:36] the lord helped me the lord saying he's
[1:19:38] revealed himself to me but i'm still
[1:19:40] battling this mind this than the other
[1:19:43] then you hear the prophet say it's got
[1:19:44] nothing to do with you
[1:19:46] the reason why the devil is at war with
[1:19:48] you is not because you because the name
[1:19:50] that god placed in you because you are
[1:19:52] mrs jesus
[1:19:54] that's why he battles you if it wasn't
[1:19:56] so you'd have no battle
[1:19:58] people in the world don't get tempted
[1:20:00] that they don't know what sin is that's
[1:20:02] their life the life of an unbeliever is
[1:20:04] just living they don't call it sin they
[1:20:06] call it life but when we sin as
[1:20:08] believers it's called a sin because it's
[1:20:12] disbelieving what god spoke in his word
[1:20:15] and acting against it but thank god for
[1:20:17] the grace of god
[1:20:22] let's go to christ is the mystery of god
[1:20:25] revealed
[1:20:28] paragraph 225 what it means to be saved
[1:20:35] the prophet of god says but the
[1:20:37] revelation come through the blood see
[1:20:39] through jesus christ who was the blood
[1:20:41] of god creative blood in the womb of
[1:20:44] mary and paul knew him
[1:20:46] by revelation that's how we know him
[1:20:49] today is only
[1:20:52] that's how we know him today is only the
[1:20:54] only way you could know him not say i'm
[1:20:56] methodist that means nothing i'm baptist
[1:20:59] that means nothing i'm catholic that
[1:21:00] means nothing but by the revelation what
[1:21:03] god has revealed the word to you
[1:21:06] he is the word and the word how you know
[1:21:10] it's revealed if
[1:21:12] it lives itself expresses himself
[1:21:15] through you
[1:21:17] once again
[1:21:18] you see here with rhymes he's literally
[1:21:20] telling you
[1:21:21] get out of your own mind it's got
[1:21:23] nothing to do with you
[1:21:25] it lives itself
[1:21:27] and expresses himself through you
[1:21:29] you're just the vessel that god uses
[1:21:32] it's got nothing to do with you god just
[1:21:35] wants to use your hands your feet your
[1:21:37] eyes your hands that's why paul can sit
[1:21:39] up there and say it's not me that liveth
[1:21:40] but christ that liveth in me he said
[1:21:42] well
[1:21:43] what do you mean
[1:21:44] i'm dead but i'm alive
[1:21:47] i i don't get it okay hold on
[1:21:50] i'm here but it's not me
[1:21:52] he's not talking about
[1:21:54] oh uh
[1:21:56] something that's
[1:21:58] if i could say in a word
[1:22:00] something that's impossible to to
[1:22:02] understand is just hidden from them that
[1:22:05] are wise and prudent but then for babies
[1:22:06] they can see
[1:22:08] that's why they call those days those
[1:22:09] people in those days christians
[1:22:11] because they saw the life of christ
[1:22:13] living through them and they said that's
[1:22:15] how christ walked paul was trying to
[1:22:17] show you when you get a life so censored
[1:22:20] when you have the holy spirit living in
[1:22:22] you it's no longer about what benoit
[1:22:24] wants to do and it's everything to do
[1:22:26] with what god wants to do
[1:22:28] his will becomes my will
[1:22:31] and brother and he goes on
[1:22:33] in christ the mystery of god revealed in
[1:22:35] paragraph 297
[1:22:39] he says
[1:22:41] talking about that life it's a personal
[1:22:43] individual affair with the person that
[1:22:46] christ has revealed to them and if you
[1:22:48] say he's been revealed to me and then
[1:22:50] the life that christ produced here in
[1:22:52] the bible that same life is in him does
[1:22:55] not produce itself in you then you've
[1:22:57] got the wrong revelation
[1:22:59] if i put a life of a pumpkin into the
[1:23:01] life of a pear tree it would bear
[1:23:03] pumpkins by their fruits ye shall know
[1:23:06] them exactly right and if the first you
[1:23:09] put out a tree a grapevine and they put
[1:23:12] out a bunch of grapes the first shoot it
[1:23:14] put out brought grapes the next one
[1:23:16] brought out lemons and the next one
[1:23:18] brought out pears the next one brought
[1:23:20] out apples and there is some kind of a
[1:23:22] grafted affair in there that's bearing
[1:23:24] his its own life every denomination will
[1:23:27] bear life of itself
[1:23:30] but if that original vine ever puts out
[1:23:33] another shoot it will bear grapes like
[1:23:35] it did the first time and if the life of
[1:23:38] jesus christ ever puts out another body
[1:23:41] of believers it'll bear the fruit that
[1:23:43] the first one did they'll write a book
[1:23:45] of acts behind it because it'll be the
[1:23:47] same same life see what i mean you just
[1:23:51] can't get away from it it's the life of
[1:23:53] christ in you been injected in you by
[1:23:56] the holy spirit itself living its life
[1:24:00] through
[1:24:00] you and in that in the quote that i read
[1:24:03] in witness brother branham talks about
[1:24:05] it
[1:24:07] he talks about the real problem is not
[1:24:10] those out in the world
[1:24:11] it's those who profess to be christians
[1:24:14] and aren't living the life of christ
[1:24:17] that's the issue we have
[1:24:19] and the greatest the greatest deception
[1:24:21] that the devil has in this day is he'll
[1:24:23] let you sit in the pew thinking you're
[1:24:25] saved when you're not i've been there
[1:24:27] that's why i can say it he let me sit
[1:24:30] there thinking that i was living right
[1:24:32] thinking that i was acting right
[1:24:33] thinking that i was feeding i could amen
[1:24:35] lord i could shout out to him i'd get up
[1:24:36] and dance and praise that meant nothing
[1:24:38] because the life i lived when i got home
[1:24:40] wasn't a christ-centered life so i what
[1:24:42] was i reflecting i wasn't reflecting his
[1:24:44] life because his life isn't reflected
[1:24:46] here amongst believers but what does the
[1:24:48] world see of you what do they see when
[1:24:51] they look at you do they see christ if
[1:24:52] they don't see christ something is wrong
[1:24:54] because we read here it says it's the
[1:24:56] same life that god in the beginning that
[1:24:59] same life has to be seen again what it
[1:25:02] produced then must be produced now
[1:25:06] and i started to ponder that i said
[1:25:11] i i heard someone say one time have you
[1:25:13] ever heard a tree grow
[1:25:18] a tree doesn't make noise when it grows
[1:25:19] it doesn't have to boast about it
[1:25:21] growing
[1:25:22] the life that's in it causes it to grow
[1:25:24] without the life it doesn't grow
[1:25:27] but here we are
[1:25:30] when when we catch an inspiration of
[1:25:32] something
[1:25:33] without settling it in the word
[1:25:36] what happens is you begin to speak like
[1:25:38] well i'm in the message
[1:25:40] well i'm a believer
[1:25:42] i know the prophet of the end time
[1:25:44] i know the word of god i know what a
[1:25:46] rapture is i'll make it i'll make it i i
[1:25:50] i there you are again in a one-man
[1:25:51] denomination
[1:25:53] it's not about you
[1:25:55] it's the grace of god that saved you
[1:25:57] not for yourself but to go and save
[1:25:59] somebody else it's your testimony that
[1:26:02] when you share it somebody says well can
[1:26:04] is that god real that god that did that
[1:26:06] for you can you do it for me that's
[1:26:07] where you rest
[1:26:09] he'll take care of it all it's his life
[1:26:13] and i started thinking to myself i said
[1:26:16] that's amazing
[1:26:18] and he
[1:26:20] said one of the best ways to determine
[1:26:23] if a tree or a plant is dead
[1:26:26] is the scree scratch test
[1:26:28] just beneath the dry outer layer of bark
[1:26:31] in the tree's trunk lies the cambium
[1:26:33] layer of bark
[1:26:35] in the living tree this is green
[1:26:37] in the dead tree it is brown and dry
[1:26:40] oh if i could only express it exactly
[1:26:42] the way i'm seeing it
[1:26:45] lord help me psalms 1 says blessed is
[1:26:48] the man that walketh not in the counsel
[1:26:50] of the ungodly nor stand it in the way
[1:26:53] of sinners nor sit it in the seat of the
[1:26:56] scornful
[1:26:59] if the life of god is inside of you
[1:27:02] you are not found in the seat of the
[1:27:04] ungodly
[1:27:05] you're not sitting where sinners are at
[1:27:08] you're not where the scornful are at but
[1:27:10] your delight is in the law of the lord
[1:27:13] and in his law do you meditate day and
[1:27:16] night
[1:27:17] and only then will you be like a tree
[1:27:19] that is planted by the rivers of water
[1:27:21] that bringeth forth his fruit in his
[1:27:24] season his leaf shall not wither and
[1:27:26] whatsoever he do it shall prosper
[1:27:30] if the life of christ is in you
[1:27:33] you have a hunger for the word
[1:27:36] you have a hunger for more of god you
[1:27:38] want more and more revelation you want
[1:27:40] more and more of god you walk into
[1:27:42] church it's no longer well so-and-so
[1:27:44] made me mad this morning well so-and-so
[1:27:46] said this no but i'm walking to hear god
[1:27:48] speak to me i want god to touch my heart
[1:27:52] meet me where i'm at in my condition see
[1:27:55] one of the favorite things that brother
[1:27:56] branham says is god meets you where
[1:27:58] you're at it's kind of like a father
[1:27:59] when he has a child who's a baby he
[1:28:01] doesn't speak in a language that the
[1:28:03] baby can't understand but he speaks gugu
[1:28:05] gaga down to the language but as he
[1:28:07] grows he changes how he speaks to the
[1:28:09] child and when he gets that age of
[1:28:10] maturity now he can start speaking to
[1:28:12] him in a manner that he can understand
[1:28:14] so the problem comes is when we receive
[1:28:17] the spirit of god and we put ourselves
[1:28:19] in a
[1:28:20] let me say this in a youthful mindset oh
[1:28:22] i'm youth
[1:28:23] i'm only going to live
[1:28:25] with what i got
[1:28:26] you know i'm a young person i don't have
[1:28:28] to live up to a certain standard those
[1:28:30] are older people god deals with them
[1:28:31] differently and what not um i i hope i
[1:28:34] get there no when the life of god comes
[1:28:36] inside of you it desires for more of god
[1:28:39] and when you get to that point where
[1:28:41] your desire for more of god becomes an
[1:28:43] action and not just a word that spoke
[1:28:45] well i want more of god in my life
[1:28:48] but you go home and don't read your
[1:28:49] bible and pray
[1:28:50] you don't listen to a tape
[1:28:53] you don't spend time in feed the burdens
[1:28:55] of everybody else doesn't bother you
[1:28:58] do you really want more of god in your
[1:28:59] life
[1:29:00] if you really did you do the things that
[1:29:02] would put more of god in your life
[1:29:04] that's where they've been on the
[1:29:05] question how does one know if he's going
[1:29:06] to go to heaven
[1:29:08] he answered them and said well
[1:29:10] i take my life
[1:29:12] i compare it to the light of the word
[1:29:14] and where i see faults i make it right
[1:29:18] and i keep pressing on that should be
[1:29:20] our hearts desire every day when we walk
[1:29:23] lord have i done all that i could have
[1:29:24] done today
[1:29:26] lord have i given you time
[1:29:28] have i set aside time for you because we
[1:29:30] can easily sit there and say well i'm
[1:29:32] too busy for that i'm too busy for that
[1:29:34] but you'll make time to watch that show
[1:29:37] to watch that movie
[1:29:38] to watch whatever you'll make time for
[1:29:41] those things get on the phone with so
[1:29:43] and so for however many hours oh i'm so
[1:29:46] busy i'm so busy
[1:29:47] but then you get home and you're in bed
[1:29:49] sleeping
[1:29:50] you can you can always find time for god
[1:29:53] see
[1:29:55] something that always hit me
[1:29:57] when the life hit the apostles in the
[1:29:59] days of old they sold all they had
[1:30:02] to follow christ
[1:30:04] they gave everything to follow christ
[1:30:06] why is it in this day because the word
[1:30:09] says it'll do the same thing it did then
[1:30:12] why is it in this day
[1:30:14] when the word comes to us we want to
[1:30:17] store stuff
[1:30:19] well i want this
[1:30:21] i want that
[1:30:22] i want this no he said let it all go
[1:30:25] you're supposed to live a life they
[1:30:26] didn't know where they were going to
[1:30:27] sleep what they were going to eat
[1:30:30] they had no idea they trusted completely
[1:30:33] in god for it all
[1:30:35] but we've gone so far from that i
[1:30:37] started to think every time there's a
[1:30:38] there's a money issue somebody wants
[1:30:40] somebody's in need of money or whatnot
[1:30:42] the first answer that goes get a job
[1:30:45] oh go do this maybe you'll get some
[1:30:47] money and whatnot
[1:30:49] don't get wrong don't get wrong what i'm
[1:30:50] saying because the bible says if you
[1:30:51] don't if you don't work you don't eat
[1:30:54] but when your first answer is always
[1:30:57] something that you can do yourself
[1:30:59] and it's not what is it that god wants
[1:31:02] me to do
[1:31:03] what if you prayed you wanted to see
[1:31:05] miracles in your life pray for a miracle
[1:31:08] what if you needed money you need
[1:31:09] healing whatever instead of going to
[1:31:11] medicine or going to get a job what if
[1:31:12] you prayed and said lord
[1:31:14] you said you'd provide all my needs
[1:31:16] you said if i seek you first
[1:31:19] everything else will be added on to me
[1:31:22] lord i'm fulfilling your scripture that
[1:31:24] you said
[1:31:26] then watch the life that's shown through
[1:31:28] you you'll see god in every facet of
[1:31:30] your life it'll no longer be you you'll
[1:31:32] get to the point you start praying for
[1:31:34] everything before you drink water lord
[1:31:36] bless it and you drink it
[1:31:39] before everything but we've gone to a
[1:31:41] point
[1:31:42] we only see us
[1:31:44] we only want to do what we want to do we
[1:31:47] only have time for what i want to do
[1:31:49] but at what point do we go back to that
[1:31:51] life that was supposed to be manifested
[1:31:54] in us if we're supposed to write another
[1:31:56] book of acts how do we expect to write
[1:31:58] it
[1:31:59] as long as we're sitting in our room
[1:32:02] hiding not sharing the word or sitting
[1:32:04] at work
[1:32:06] being busy and different stuff without
[1:32:07] taking the time to share it with
[1:32:09] somebody else i find it fascinating
[1:32:12] when people tell me
[1:32:14] oh yeah i'm a christian there's nothing
[1:32:17] other whatever whatever i'm a mess of
[1:32:18] believer in the i asked them a simple
[1:32:20] question because even for me i was at a
[1:32:22] point where
[1:32:23] i was on the other side of it but then
[1:32:25] god dealt with me
[1:32:27] i i asked him well have you ever told
[1:32:29] anybody about what you believe
[1:32:31] no
[1:32:32] why
[1:32:34] and they might ridicule it they might
[1:32:35] not believe it they might not understand
[1:32:37] the other it it's not you
[1:32:40] you can speak to one person who's a
[1:32:42] sinner one who's a believer unbeliever
[1:32:44] and unbeliever he has a seed to believe
[1:32:46] that one doesn't
[1:32:48] you say the exact same thing
[1:32:51] he won't believe it because there's
[1:32:52] nothing in him to believe it but he will
[1:32:54] all you have to do is open your mouth
[1:32:56] the word says worry not what to say in
[1:32:58] that moment for god will give it to you
[1:33:00] what to say in that moment
[1:33:02] but so many times when we testify we
[1:33:04] want to talk about the seven seals they
[1:33:06] don't understand that
[1:33:08] they don't get what that is but you get
[1:33:10] down to where they're at
[1:33:12] brother are you struggling with
[1:33:13] something
[1:33:15] somebody of yours is sick
[1:33:17] well i i can remember back
[1:33:20] before i was even saved i had a friend
[1:33:22] of mine she had cancer i wrote a prayer
[1:33:24] request here at the church and she had
[1:33:25] diabetes as well she was going to go
[1:33:27] through chemo
[1:33:28] and i felt in my heart i said well i
[1:33:30] believe in the living god
[1:33:32] why not bring this before the saints i
[1:33:34] brought wrote a prayer request and said
[1:33:35] pray for my friends who has cancer and
[1:33:38] diabetes and she was about to go start
[1:33:41] chemo
[1:33:42] and
[1:33:42] they prayed she went back to the doctors
[1:33:44] the condition was getting worse
[1:33:46] and she told me well ben
[1:33:49] um
[1:33:50] it's getting worse i don't know what if
[1:33:52] i'm going to make it or whatnot and i
[1:33:53] told her i said see it's in the moment
[1:33:55] when things start getting worse that you
[1:33:57] got to have a little bit more faith
[1:33:59] because god's getting ready to do
[1:34:00] something in that moment
[1:34:02] and i said just believe a little bit
[1:34:04] more a little bit longer you won't do it
[1:34:06] for yourself do it for me to believe a
[1:34:07] little bit longer and she went back to
[1:34:09] doctors the next time and there was no
[1:34:11] trace of anything left
[1:34:13] that's not happened chance that's not an
[1:34:16] accident no it was if i hadn't applied
[1:34:19] what it is i know that i serve a living
[1:34:21] god that whatever i ask he'll do if i
[1:34:25] hadn't put myself in that place
[1:34:27] there would be no testimony like that
[1:34:29] but because i fulfill the scripture god
[1:34:31] is bound by his word to do his part i
[1:34:33] did my part that's up to him to do his
[1:34:42] excuse
[1:34:45] you know just uh because i want just in
[1:34:48] in closing what god put on my
[1:34:51] part of my heart he said
[1:34:54] you can't help it
[1:34:56] even if you tried
[1:34:58] because it's no longer you living
[1:35:00] it's god living through you
[1:35:02] the problem comes
[1:35:04] when benoit interferes
[1:35:06] that's when the issue begins
[1:35:08] but if benue can only get out of the way
[1:35:10] and let god have his way
[1:35:12] they've been all become a true witness
[1:35:15] reflecting nothing except god because it
[1:35:18] has to get to a point where you can say
[1:35:21] where we can say if you have seen me
[1:35:24] you've seen the father
[1:35:26] how
[1:35:27] because he is expressed in you
[1:35:29] through you
[1:35:30] why
[1:35:31] because a equals b
[1:35:33] and b equals c
[1:35:35] therefore a equals c ask yourself
[1:35:38] am i really reflecting a the way i
[1:35:41] should if not make it right
[1:35:43] let god take control he knows where he
[1:35:46] wants to take you just pull from that
[1:35:48] everlasting fountain of life
[1:35:50] he will see it through he promised he
[1:35:52] would let's surrender ourselves to his
[1:35:54] will less of us more of him
[1:35:58] so in feeding
[1:36:00] and just studying
[1:36:03] the burn desire god put on my heart is
[1:36:06] if i'm supposed to be a witness there
[1:36:08] has to be somebody to witness too
[1:36:12] and as long as i'm just witnessing to my
[1:36:14] brothers who are in the message or my
[1:36:15] sisters in the message
[1:36:17] there's other people out there that
[1:36:19] don't know this
[1:36:21] that have the seed of god in them
[1:36:23] and without me playing my part because
[1:36:25] there's a part to play nobody ever
[1:36:27] talked about it once you're saved you're
[1:36:28] not saved for here
[1:36:30] you're saved for there in that new world
[1:36:33] but we want to take all those that are
[1:36:35] of god's children
[1:36:37] over there with us but how can we if we
[1:36:39] keep being silent and quiet with what is
[1:36:42] god does in our life
[1:36:44] we have to testify we have to speak i've
[1:36:47] been
[1:36:47] random moments of my life
[1:36:50] god says speak to this person and i
[1:36:52] speak to them i don't know what god will
[1:36:53] do i just do what he says when he asks
[1:36:56] and i leave it in his hands because it's
[1:36:58] up to him he said he'll take care of
[1:37:00] everything as long as i put him first
[1:37:03] and i do his word
[1:37:04] everything else will be fine
[1:37:06] god bless you saints
[1:37:08] [Applause]
[1:37:22] let's stand together
[1:37:40] so
[1:37:48] a little course i wanted to sing i don't
[1:37:51] better really know the words but i just
[1:37:54] uh
[1:37:55] just play sister forrest would you
[1:37:57] please
[1:37:59] [Music]
[1:38:02] i'm
[1:38:04] wondering tonight if
[1:38:08] maybe you didn't
[1:38:10] down inside of your spirit come under a
[1:38:12] little bit of conviction
[1:38:16] you know about really
[1:38:18] how much your life is
[1:38:21] about his will and not
[1:38:24] your will
[1:38:27] and
[1:38:27] [Music]
[1:38:29] you know i believe our brother gave his
[1:38:31] testimony because he could honestly tell
[1:38:34] you he knows what it is to die
[1:38:37] you know and it's a hard thing to die
[1:38:41] but he made a statement that moved me
[1:38:46] and it it
[1:38:47] [Music]
[1:38:49] sunk deep within me
[1:38:53] he said when somebody's got a gun
[1:38:55] pointing at you
[1:38:58] he says is it really your life then
[1:39:03] you know
[1:39:04] or you're in a car accident or someone
[1:39:07] runs into you and you all of a sudden
[1:39:09] you're in a car accident
[1:39:11] is it really your life
[1:39:13] then
[1:39:15] you might
[1:39:16] think you have a life
[1:39:20] but there's
[1:39:21] only two spirits
[1:39:26] you know what i'm saying so you're
[1:39:28] either serving god
[1:39:30] or you're serving manna
[1:39:34] you can't serve two kingdoms
[1:39:38] and that's all the gospel is
[1:39:41] it's the word of god
[1:39:43] telling you
[1:39:45] that the wages of
[1:39:48] sin is death
[1:39:51] but the gift of god is eternal life
[1:39:54] through jesus
[1:39:56] and it's a plea to
[1:39:59] to die
[1:40:02] and he said if you'll give up your life
[1:40:07] i'll give you life
[1:40:10] life more abundant
[1:40:13] [Music]
[1:40:15] he could have sat saw the
[1:40:17] basketball career
[1:40:19] [Music]
[1:40:21] how long does that last
[1:40:23] tell your first injury
[1:40:27] you know
[1:40:30] it don't last but this lasts forever
[1:40:34] you know what would you give for a time
[1:40:37] of entertainment for one soul
[1:40:39] what would a man give for a soul
[1:40:42] what is a soul worth that's worth ten
[1:40:44] thousand worlds
[1:40:46] and so
[1:40:47] as we sing this course i'd like each of
[1:40:50] us just to
[1:40:51] [Music]
[1:40:53] think in our heart
[1:40:55] and maybe just take a moment to
[1:40:57] rededicate our focus of our life
[1:41:04] maybe you might need prayer and you
[1:41:06] might say i haven't been living for the
[1:41:08] lord and i
[1:41:10] i'd like to
[1:41:11] have prayer tonight i'd like to lift up
[1:41:13] my hand and say god remember me
[1:41:17] i i don't
[1:41:20] i don't have something that i'm living
[1:41:22] for
[1:41:26] and this is the age of being lukewarm
[1:41:29] it's the age of being in a place that
[1:41:32] you're not
[1:41:33] living
[1:41:36] you're just drifting from pillar to post
[1:41:40] you've never sat down and
[1:41:43] drove in a tie post into the ground and
[1:41:45] said
[1:41:46] this is what i'm going to live for
[1:41:49] and i'm going to give my life to you
[1:41:51] lord and i'm going to live for you
[1:41:53] and i'm going to let your will be done
[1:41:56] in my life
[1:41:57] not my will lord
[1:42:00] but thy
[1:42:02] will be done
[1:42:04] you might put your hands up the lord and
[1:42:05] say lord i'd like to be used of you
[1:42:08] i'd like to do something
[1:42:11] i like to have you speak to my heart i i
[1:42:14] might not have a call to preach i might
[1:42:17] not be
[1:42:18] someone that has a musical ability
[1:42:22] but lord
[1:42:23] there's something inside of me
[1:42:26] a calling and
[1:42:28] [Music]
[1:42:29] every calling
[1:42:32] only comes in
[1:42:35] to existence with the surrender
[1:42:38] and the death
[1:42:41] lord i'm going to re
[1:42:42] surrender to the call
[1:42:45] that i feel in my heart
[1:42:48] i'm going to surrender to the pull
[1:42:51] i feel tonight to serve you more
[1:42:55] but i'm going to surrender to the
[1:42:58] spirit that moved in me that said i
[1:43:00] could live more dedicated tonight

[1:43:09] in the light of what i've heard lord i

[1:43:29] lord i want to
[1:43:32] serve you with a greater
[1:43:35] intensity than i've ever served you

[1:43:42] heart by your spirit

[1:44:16] and i'll trust that everything else will
[1:44:19] be added
[1:44:24] lord was a prophet to man if he gains
[1:44:27] the whole world
[1:44:29] and loses his soul
[1:44:32] or what would he give in exchange for
[1:44:34] his soul
