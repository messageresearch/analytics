Description:
Just Drama
Bro. Matthew McGeary
August 4, 2024
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

before him Lord truly we are a blessed people more than we could ever express or say we do our best Lord to use words to praise you and to tell you how much you mean to us Lord something in our heart longs to step over into eternity where we'll have a new body and be able to look upon your face and be able to express ourselves in a greater way we'll have all eternity to do with no distractions and the cares of the LI this life all gone but Lord while we're on this side acting out your great plan Lord we want to do our best to tell you that we love you not just tell you Lord with words but we want to tell you with our actions Lord we want to show you how much you mean to us Lord by the way we live our day and Lord when things get hard we'll be able to conduct oursel with joy in the midst of the trial knowing that Lord you've left a measuring of suffering for your people that we might get that Christlike character and when we go through the trial with joy it's pleasing to you Lord and Lord we all just I believe in one Accord would want more of that Christlike nature to be able to fulfill your word and to manifest your word to be able to express a greater love to you that you so richly deserve Lord we know it's in times like these in the cool of the evening that you would come by our way and minister to our heart even in a communion service Lord so we're just surrendering to you Lord just needful that you'd come once again and move amongst your people Lord that you would have the pre minutes we surrender to you now Lord and commit all things into thy wonderful hands the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen if you have your bibles if you'll turn in uh Romans chapter 4 um Brother David will be out uh soon uh he's just there in the office but um we'll just look to the word and see uh what the Lord might be able to bring to us uh for a moment and uh we're just trusting in Him amen we're just trusting in Him amen we're just trusting in Him amen oh my now that's sounding more like it uh Romans 4 and verse uh 19 and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform amen you may be seated on also just turn over into Romans chap 12 and we'll read verse two Romans 12 and verse two would read like this as we heard this morning and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God brother brandom would say in Shalom preached this 1964 January 19th I believe he also preached it on the 12th he says his word is just like a great Symphony how many of you have ever heard a symphony well everybody has now remember symphony is when music is played in a drama I think I have that right a symphony like Peter and the Wolf you remember that that old Story how they they used to I've heard that how they take the drums and make the little woodpecker pecking and Peter going out and growling of the wolf and tooting of the horns a symphony now if you don't understand a symphony it's a big bunch of Racket to you if you don't understand it you've got to understand what it is it's all done by signs and motions but it acts out a drama in this Symphony now notice the only one that understands a symphony is the composer and those who are interested interesting in knowing it knows its changes knows what takes place I like how he even points out that the only people that really know what's going on are those that are interested in knowing and as he's typing this to God's word I believe there's a people on the Earth that are interested in what God's Great drama is and what the Sheep music would say what the great conductor is uh telling us to do he says the composer knows every move from the end to the beginning from the beginning to the end did you know that the one who wrote it up he composes this he knows every little Junction if he knows every Junction so does the director have to do to direct it now how you going to twist your Creed in that one little miscue of that stick that sign one little Miss sign at a junction would throw the whole Orchestra off throw the whole Symphony out now you know that's true the composer and director has to be in the same spirit and I would say that as the composer and the director would be in the same Spirit we as the body of Christ as as the bride we want to be in the same Spirit we want to be in the same mind we want to we want to be ready and anticipation we want to know our part we want to we want to be in harmony we want to be in the Rhythm we want to be looking for the sign and for the motion h of when that would would would be your turn or you you know it's like okay you're waiting for your part you have a position you have a Ministry something that you're acting out a portion uh that you're playing in it he says that's why the minister and the the word of God God's Great Symphony he has been playing since the dawn of time the minister at the word has to not look over here and say I I believe this ought to be you ought to make it this way he has got to go the way the Sheep music says take it that's the way the gospel has to be preached the way the word says take it you know if you throw a Creed in there you got the whole thing messed up it's got to go to make the drama just exactly right and just maybe the thought that is on my heart uh we'll just maybe see how the Lord might help us here um just drama I just want to speak to you this evening on just drama when you think of a drama you know drama is something that's acted out like a play or it it describes a situation you know uh something uh might come up something that's acted out and I I don't know about you but when when I was in the world you know we had people that they would call drama queens does anybody ever you ever heard of somebody labeled a drama queen it's like man they're just a drama queen it just seems like no matter uhh what happens they're always uh they're always trying to stir something up always trying to cause some trouble always trying to make something bigger than it usually than it really is and and you know you can have the most the most little thing happen and and this little instance happen and all a sudden it's just a bunch of drama and they're going around and telling this person and that person and this change in the atmosphere and all of a sudden it just seems like man everything's turned into a big drama something that would have just been so so little and really not that big of a deal all of a sudden it's like why why are we having this I mean I why are we having all this trouble I just I thought I thought we were just going to go out to eat I I thought we were just going to go over to so ando's house I I just thought we were going to go into the fellowship hall and practice a song special and all a sudden now we're we're we're arguing like the disciples who's the greatest amongst all of us you know it's like man my who's going to sing who's not going to sing who's going to play who's not and all of a sudden there's this this atmosphere and all this stuff well you want to tell you what uh drama can happen right in the church building right in the church house right in the the church the church family I I know these things ain't unfamiliar to you it can happen you the devil's always trying to stir things up it's like lightting a fuse and just get ready something you know something's about to happen you know when you when you light the fuse of a firecracker or firework or something like that just get ready you know you know something's about to happen has anybody ever done it well if you light a firework you you you you better know what you just did and then you better run for safety you you better know what you're doing you better know what you just lit some of those things do different things some of them fly up they're like a rocket and if and they got to have a stand or something and and all of a sudden some of us you better be careful you're lighting fuses you're saying things and doing things you don't realize you you know it's the little foxes that spoil the vine all a sudden you say something you get out of step of the Sheep music you think you're going to try to H uh uh do something just even like our our pastor mentioned this morning you know approaches everything you might have all the right intentions you might want to might want to help the situation but if you come up and you approach it at the wrong time and not the right way uh well you thought you were helping but you just made the drama lot bigger now now you just pulled into the mesh too and and now you feel like people are picking sides and everything's out of whack you wonder what in the world am I going to do I tell you you want know who the greatest drama queen of them all is is it's Satan yeah I don't mind calling a drama queen because he's just always trying to stir things up he's always trying to cause problem he's always trying to just get into your mind and and get into uh uh the the workings of the church in your day and he's just trying to to to distract you and get your eyes off of the sheet music and and before you know you're so worked up and you're out of rhythm and you got your eyes off the com the composer and now uh uh maybe the director the minister comes and he's preaching the word and and now you're indifferent towards him he's like well he's just preaching on me because he knows about the situation and and you're all flustered because that good old drama queen is trying to sew all these little seeds of doubt and seeds of explanation and this is why he's saying this is and this is why this is going on and all of a sudden before you know you're fearing and you're worrying in and you're losing your your purpose and then you're getting between two opinions and you know what happens when you get between two opinions you lose your reason and now you really you're trying to wonder well who's right or they right or them wrong and do I got to pick sides and and all of a sudden you're all flustered and don't even want to go to church anymore happens all because you didn't get the memo that we were all going to Jason's Deli it can happen that easy oh yeah de he the devil's crafty I didn't get invited to the baby shower uh oh I just lost my clip right oh that was rigged you can be a baby shower game like well they said it all up they were family they rigged it I'm not going to church on Sunday I'm out of here you know it's drama it it's it's a it's a bunch of drama and believe it or not there's a lot of drama that's going on in the church and we get caught up in it and and and it can be the smallest little things and it's like our whole world is going to fall apart it makes us feel all nervous and and situations and things that have taken place in the past and and roots of bitterness and these things can start to if you're not careful you know I I something I ministered on when we were um just in the meetings we were talking about uh the multiplication of the spirit brother Brandon would talk about how uh how cancer what it would do is it would attach itself to a bruised cell and he said what'll happen as it attaches itself to that bruised cell it starts to multiply and it starts to get bigger and bigger and bigger and it turns into a growth and all of a sudden he says but I'm not dealing with the growth in the natural in the body I'm dealing with the life behind the growth because it's the life behind that growth that becomes mment and it's starting to grow and grow and grow and get bigger and bigger what does it do it's suing out all the life out of you in the bloodstream and if something ain't done it'll eventually take your life and he would say that the doctor can come in there and he can cut it out but if he doesn't get all of it it'll grow back it'll it'll attach itself to situations and bitterness will do the same thing bitterness it'll take a situation where you were hurt your hand wasn't sh shaken or something happened or you weren't invited here or there or something was said and you've been offended and you've been hurt you've been bruised be very careful cuz a spirit will want to attach itself to that and all of a sudden it'll start to try to grow and it'll go from one situation to another and uh brother brandom I think it's profound he would start to talk about bitterness when he's preaching I believe Christ is the mystery of God revealed he takes time to say look don't let bitterness uh uh get into your life he said it'll drive it'll it'll drive the spirit of God right out of your life it'll drive it from this Tabernacle here it'll root down like a sickness like a cancer like a canker and'll start to drive its wedge down into every area of your life and before you know you wonder why am I so spiritually void why why does I why don't I feel the presence of God anymore it's because there's been something that has attached itself to your life it's another life form it isn't the life of Jesus Christ it's a cancer it's a canker that's trying to eat away at you and all from just a little drama maybe maybe situations right now are working through your mind maybe you're going through a drama maybe you're going through something right now look we we want to be vigilant we have to realize that it can be in the very small things that Satan is able to to to distract us and to discourage us and and be able to to just cause a stir in the home and and break up the atmosphere and before you know it uh you're wonder where is the presence of God why do I feel the way I I I'm feeling allwe CU it's just drama it's just drama is everybody tired ready you want to go to go to go you it's just drama you know it's just you know it's part of life it's it it's just that's just the way it is and you know maybe I could pack this in for another time we're just trying to be uh faithful to um you know the call of God just uh uh uh as the opportunity was afforded to us but maybe we can make a little progress into it if that would be all right I'd be happy to move right into communion but you know what we're we're we're in a drama and we got to play our part that's what I was maybe thinking how a little thought on my heart and and then uh you you get called into action you're like man that's just the way it is you know it's part of the drama I just got to act out my part praise the Lord we're all here we're all showed up for the drama and every single one of us has a part to play and sometimes we need to pick if we're going to play our part right you know you got a part to play When the Sheep music calls for it are you just going to sit back and like you know what I'm GNA sit this one out hey you might you might have had some other drama happening that's making you feel that way you know what I don't want to I don't want to sing this song because they don't sing it fast enough I like it when they play it in the key of G it's just right in my perfect so I'm just going to sit this one out I like it when brother so and so sings it oh my these things are juvenile but it gets right in the church house it gets right in our car it gets right in our work workplace you know it's it reminds me of drama I was thinking about it I when I was in junior high has anybody ever been in a drama club come on let's see a show of hands in here who's been in drama club we got one hey we got we got more in here all right drama club you know I don't know how how uh how how y'all did it but I mean drama club is where you you you get together it's a class and you act out certain plays or skits or or or you you do certain uh things and and I remember you know one time uh we you'd have to go to like uh they' have events at other schools and you'd come up with some some um something to act out or play and you'd go and one group would get out there and and they would act something out and then and then you know you had to get up there and act out your part and I remember one of my friend uh his name was Ricky and and uh we were we we were in drama club together and he he was a neighborhood friend lived down the street and and you know I I don't know how we we ever got the idea to do what we did but I tell you what it wasn't about when I was in front of everybody I had my hat on backwards my pants on backwards and my shirt on backwards and my drama was criss cross going to make you jump now that might be a little too old for some of y'all but I was acting out some wannab be rap group and I got in front of all them people and I'm with my friend Ricky I'm like what am I even doing here drama it was just drama a bunch of drama I know some of y'all are getting a vigil right now like are you kidding me I was a lot younger then but you know I remember there uh you know drama you got to act out a skit and one of the beneficial things about being there is I I actually saw a a a team act out a a skit and they called it the reverse omatic and you know we got back to school and everybody was brainstorming for a good idea and I thought hey I got an idea what about we do something like you know call it a reverse omatic and it was like you could change the situ you could just rewind the situation something bad happens you just you just rewind it and and and we had to act this thing out but you know you had to you had to plan it you had to get all the materials together you had to you know you had to pick the every person that was going to play the part okay well you're going to be the individual you'll walk in and this is going to happen and you'll trip and you'll fall and you'll lose everything and then they'll steal your money and then this person's over here standing with the reversomatic and then you you react all everything in backwards and slow motion trying to reverse everything but everybody had to know their part for it to work it was a drama trying to work towards something y'all get with me maybe we'll stand up and preach to you it's a big drama you had to act it out everybody had to play their part in this this drama and so just trying to uh get something that you can relate to maybe in the natural you know if if you've been in school or you you you've seen so even in work if you're going to if you're going to have a if you're going to put together a plan and work and everybody's going to play their part you get together and say well you're going to carry out this part of the job and you have a team and marketing and all these things it all has to go together and everybody's working towards one goal and one objective and in order for you to be successful everybody has to play their part or if I can say as we are looking at maybe from the the scenes of a drama you got to act it all out to be able to play the drama y'all with me all right and brother Brandon would say now if you don't understand a symphony just reading that back it's a big bunch of it to you if you don't understand it you've got to understand what it is it's all done by signs and motions but it acts out a drama in a symphony and maybe you know sometimes we feel like our life is just a big bunch of Racket you don't understand what's going on in your life and you're looking you know I just got to say look at the Sheep music if you don't understand what you're going through and what everything is about just look at the Sheep music just look start looking into the Bible say Lord I'm going through a hard time I remember one time a sister you know I believe she was she was needing work and so she read the book of J God Honors that type of faith it it it it sounds funny but I love it she she she said I need an answer from God she looked into the word and it spoke to her God loves that kind of childlike Faith all he does is wants you to look to him I love it when my kids they come up they'll ask some of the the most simplest things or or or they'll say some of the the the most uh wonderful things and something in your heart just like my that that's just wonderful I like that God wants you to look to him he wants you to say Lord I I I don't understand what all the racket is I I'm not I can't make sense of it it just sounds like a mess my whole life is like a mess I I don't understand why my family my health and all these things are happening and if you're not careful Satan will get in there he'll try to make you worry he'll try to make you have fear he'll try to get you to look at all the symptoms and before you know you're all worked up and you're saying things that aren't on the Sheep music just get back to the Sheep music if you want to make sense of everything that's going on listen to Malachi 45 listen to your pastor read pray look into your Bible and then God will start speaking in your heart and you can start to see how the pieces are playing and lining up and you realize oh okay God now I see what you're doing in my life there's a a drama something's taking place and you're acting it out in my life but when you get your eyes off of the word when you get your eyes off the composer when you get your eyes looking other places and you start listening to the drama and everything else out in the world all of a sudden you're confused and you don't know what's going on you wonder what it's all about you say oh my goodness I'm not going to make it I'm not going to go in the Rapture I no that's not what the Sheep music says let's look at the Sheep music now brother Brandon would say this in a glorified Jesus he preached it in 55 he says that's where God builds his church every time so we're just uh maybe where this quote is coming in just thinking of in a drama everybody has their their part to play right you know I don't care whatever it is so we're there brother brandham says this he says that's where God built his church every time the only place he can build it was upon the spiritual revealed truth of God job had it I want you to notice every man that ever has the spiritual revealed truth of the will of God makes preparation for the fulfilling now I think I played that over and over maybe 50 times because I love how the prophet can just pack eternity into a sentence every man that ever has the spiritual revealed truth of the will of God makes preparation for the fulfilling that is what we need Church we need exactly what he's saying right there we need the spiritual revealed truth of the will of God and when you have that then you start to make preparations for the fulfilling of it when the Bible says and Abraham staggered not at the promises of God because he was fully persuaded Abraham was making preparations for the fulfilling he was getting the baby clothes he was putting the nursery together he was was he was making preparations for the promise because something had been revealed to him and so now he was going into action because he knew the promise was going to be fulfilled just like Noah when God spoke to him he said Noah it's going to rain he didn't just sit back and say well God said it's going to rain no but there was something that was revealed to Noah Noah knew he had a job to do and Noah went into preparation for the fil fulfilling of what had been spoken now I wonder as the individual sitting in the age that we're living in have we caught the Revelation that it's later than you think look at Israel look look at where we're at we're we're 60 plus years past the prophet going off the scene and we're speaking of the coming of the Lord and the change of our bodies and I wonder are we making preparation for the Fulfillment if we're not that we might just be lacking the spiritual revealed truth of his will for our life is the reason why we dible and Dabble and we go out into the things of the world and we entertain the things that we entertain is because maybe we're lacking a little bit of Revelation but if we can say God Quicken your word to me I need a greater revelation of the call of God upon my life and the part you want me to play CU I want to get into action Lord reveal this message to me in a greater way Lord I need the spiritual revealed truth of your will of your word Lord and I know when I receive that Revelation I will go into prep preparation for the fulfilling of that but without the Revelation you don't even know how to prepare you say you say somebody's getting already you know like what are you getting ready for I don't know I'm just getting ready well if you don't know what you're getting ready for you're not going to be prepared it's you you know I think it's interesting you go to the airport and it can be winter and you see people walk well you know people have lost their mind so maybe maybe it doesn't uh mean as much as it would maybe a few years ago but you're in the airport you see people are walking in shorts and flipflops and they got a t-shirt on you're like man it's it's 15 degrees outside but they're dressing for where they're going you see the gate they're sitting at and they're going to Florida they're they're going to some tropical place because they're prepared for their destination you know when we live here in the south and you got to be careful if you're going up to North Country you better check the weather you know it feels all good down here it's 70 80 degrees and so man you pack all light and everything you think man I'm just going to bring a carry on and you look at like oh my goodness it is 8 degrees in Lima Ohio we better bring some sweaters we better bring some jackets we better prepare ourselves for the destination that we're going we got to get prepared because once you get a revelation of what the weather's like what you start to make preparation for the fulfilling of what you're going to go into right so that's what we want a revelation we want every man that ever has spiritually revealed truth of the will of God makes preparation for the fulfilling we could you know we could for the sake of time we won't go into those things but you can start to think of all the characters down through the Bible that received a revelation from God it put him to into action to fulfill the promise that was given to him when Abel found out that God required a lamb Hallelujah he made sure that he got a lamb and he offered the proper sacrifice it took preparation to be able to offer the proper sacrifice but it had to be a revelation without the Revelation you would just be just as good as Cain trying to offer your good works and your ability to God as a pleasing sacrifice and that will never work you can't be good enough you can't offer enough works you can't offer enough to God to say oh I finally made it I finally bought myself salvation no you can't buy yourself salvation because salvation has already been purchased all you do is have to accept it now just skipping for uh just to try to uh move a little quicker just you could think of all the the types and things things you could go through and brother Brandon would make this statement in the unveiling of God he'd say what is it it's the same God all the time just changing his form in morphe he just changes it the great drama to him he's acting it out so God is just acting out a great drama you know that the children uh uh you think of Shadrach mesach and Abend too here it what looks like their greatest trial it looks like uh uh they got to lose their life they're saying look if you don't bow we're throwing you into the fiery furnace but I just was thinking on that here it is you know if anybody you like a drama or there's some type of show or something you like and you know has everything builds up to the best part right it's like that's what a drama is right everything's kind of building to this climactic uh uh place in the story and everything gets to the crescendo and and and it's right at the height of the climax oh my I tell you what the the the children of Israel I I wonder how they were feeling as they got closer and closer to the furnace but I can just see God sitting back there going this is my favorite part I I've been looking for this part in the drama and because their faith in God's word they say look if he say if he saves Us Praise the Lord if he does it for one thing we're not doing we're not getting off the Sheep music right I got to stay with the composer I don't care uh if it means my life I don't care if it means my finances I don't care if it means my family my job whatever it is I got to stay with the Sheep music I got to stay in harmony with the composer and the composer was sitting back and said that's it you're just acting out your part boys keep going keep acting it out and oh my as they got to that fiery furnace there was another man in the fire oh there was that climatical point where God came down himself in the trial in the time of of the fire what was it God was acting out his great drama and I love brother Brandon would say this in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he say look at him there at the grave when he prayed at Lazareth grave he said father I thank thee that thou Hast heard me already but for these that stand by I say it just acting out in drama what God had showed to him by Vision he said I do nothing except the father shows me first that was the faith that was delivered to the Saints did the Saints keep it certainly did the Saints keep it certainly look at Paul look at uh uh Peter they were being led by the spirit of God when Cornelius was was seeking God and and what did God do he come down in a dream and a vision to Peter and say look go down to the house of Cornelius there's there there's Gentiles there that are going to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost what were they doing they were being led by the spirit of God God was revealing his will to him Peter at first was like how in the world Lord I I can't go down there he's like look don't call that that I've called clean don't call it dirty go go on down there and Minister the gospel to him they he wouldn't preach the gospel he said can we forbid these water these that have received the Holy Spirit like us right he was acting out that part of the drama then if they were acting it out if they kept it then God's doing the same thing for you then we got to act out our part we want to be led we want to have that type of revelation we want to see God moving in his people acting out his great drama we want to get into position do you know what your position is we know that's exactly what adoption is it's the placing of sons we all want to be in our position we want to be acting out our part we want to be uh uh right there ready in in the sheet music of the composer waiting for our queue waiting for our time waiting for the Lord to say all right son now it's your turn you move you speak you do if if we're not careful we get caught up in all the other cares of life and we're not even in our our position that's something I believe as a son and daughter of God we we want to be careful say Lord I always want to be ready go God's going to have his way and and I and I think of this this story it comes to me uh we're very familiar with it when that that the mother was with this old older mother was seeing this this young mother with a baby and and she just felt compelled I got to pray for this baby it's it's fuss and it's sick and and she kept uh uh putting it off and putting it off but she just felt the Lord just kept pushing her heart and she came up said look I if you'll excuse me I know you have a prayer card I know you're going to have brother Brandon pray for you but will you just let me pray just to satisfy my conscience now we know it was the will of God for that baby to be healed and I believe it was the perfect will of God that it was going to be through that mother's heart for that young mother and that child to pray and bring forth the Fulfillment but if she wouldn't have been obedient to that sure I it wouldn't the story wouldn't have gone the way we hear it I would presume that she would have got down there and brother Brandon would have discerned and and and the baby would have been healed but because she was obedient and she acted out her part oh the Great composer was able to stand there say you know the baby's already healed because up there was a mother and God moved upon her heart to pray for your baby she's already healed what was it she was acting out her part in the great drama of God and every single one of us we got to act out our part in prayer and reading our Bible and making that phone call when that brother that sister comes on here we all all US mean we don't have some big great something to do the big great something to do is the part that God gave you to play it can be on your knees in the closet it can be your devotions with your family M moms it can be taking care of the kids doing your laundry uh preparing the food in your own that is the great drama that God's wanting you to act out that you would be a Christian example in the darkest age the world has ever seen and that's pleasing to the Lord but we want to be in position and Satan's always trying to get us all flustered always trying to get our eyes off of the promise every man that's ever ever has the spiritual revealed truth of the will of God makes preparation for the fulfilling how do you make preparation 1 Corinthians 14:8 would read like this for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle what is a trumpet it's an announcement it's getting your attention it's getting you ready something's going to happen that's what we've heard as a trumpet we've heard a shout something that's preparing you something that's getting you ready oh at least somebody's heard it if it's familiar if it's familiar to you just get behind it some people have never heard this before it's true hey we got new people coming in all the time but that's what a trumpet is brother brandom says a trumpet what is it get ready I'm going to give you the revelation of Jesus Christ to give to the church I will speak to you what will be the destination of the world for those who receive and those who reject a trumpet of God attention every man when the trumpet blows he grabs his sword and stands to place attention the trumpet that's exactly what John was saying is say I was I was was in the spirit of the Lord on the Lord's day and I heard a great voice behind me as a trumpet we're the Most Blessed people that we have heard the voice of the Lord that great trumpet shouting out get ready be ready stand at attention this is what the world's going to this is what's going to happen to the world and this is what's going to happen to the bride get ready prepare yourself prepare yourself for battle there's a war go there's a spiritual war going on right now and we all want to get ourselves ready we want to be in our place we want to be in our position but how can we ever know our place and our position if we're not feeding on the spiritual food in due season it has to be a daily feeding that look at the natural type the Mana was good for that day it has to be new every day to you you got to seek God say Lord I need a work word for today Lord give me a greater Revelation give me more understanding Lord give me more wisdom lead me and guide me today if we're not careful we get a traditional H mindset about the message of the hour as we've obtained an understanding oh I know what the message is oh friends it's too vast it's too deep it's too expansive it it fills all space it fills all time uh there's no way uh uh uh this little peab brain up here this little Canary brain you can't even begin oh it's untapped resources fills all space and time it's it's eternity eternity and I say oh God I I want to tap in every single day for what you would have for me we want to hear what that great voice is saying and to think oh what a blessed people we are to think that we can hear the voice of God speaking to us preparing us showing us the way that I am the am I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last brother Bram would say this in perseverance he said in the whole armor of God is Faith love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience the whole armor of the believer is faith we believe God by faith because God said so then what is it Abraham was justified by Paul by faith but by James by works Abraham was talking what God saw and James was talking what man saw show me your faith by your Works without your works and so forth see then if you don't have works with your faith it shows you haven't got faith you're just talking from your mouth woo receive it from a prophet you're just you're just talking from your mouth you're all talk yeah that's what we do in school right or you know you get you get in a they call it trash talking you get in a fight like oh I why don't you back it up put your money where your mouth is we say we're this we say we believe it well then show a life well you know praise God we're here for communion yeah you're showing you're showing this is what man sees that's what James was talking about you believe in the ordinances you believe the prophecy you believe the word says it well here you are it's proven your works is proven you believe it but when you say you believe it and you don't show up to do it something's lacking you're not in your place you're not in your position you're not in harmony you're not in in the rhythm of the Sheep music show me your faith by your Works without your works and so forth see then if you don't have works with your faith it shows you haven't got faith you're just talking from your mouth but if you really got faith you believe it and act like it that's right put it in action put it in action he says Noah did he put it in action he went right ahead building the ark right according to the blueprint right according to the Revelation if he just went out there A lot of times if we're not careful we get ahead of God but you there's a there's a a design there's a leading there's a blueprint we have to be careful some something God put something on your heart and if you're not careful you just run out no you want to wait for the Revelation and for the leadership of the Lord on how he wants to do it how he wants you to approach it the season the time if you're not careful I mean could you imagine if Noah said oh my it's going to rain and God wants a boat you get over there Noah what's that it's a canoe we're getting out of here man like that's no that's not what nuh that's that's not what I wanted he had to wait for the blueprint he had to wait for the spiritual revealed truth of the will of God and when he had that he went into preparation for the filling he started Gathering all the materials together he started putting everything in order and he started to frame it up according to the blueprints of God and oh what a blessed people we are that God has has revealed his blueprints to us in this day and showed us look you're part of the plan this is where you you fit through seven Church ages I've placed you in all the they've they've they've acted out all their part in the drama and now I've placed you here at this time and this is what you're fulfilling I'm revealing the son of predition revealing the son of man and if you are studying and praying and you're seeing and you're seeking and you're like okay Lord I see where we're at I understand what the Sheep mus are calling for I understand what the symphony is all about but we we want to get in sync with the great composer and just just try to see how the Lord would move us here but just thinking of how to think here Israel had been believing for for a messiah and they're carrying out the letter of the law that Moses had given to them and they're washing pots and they're doing everything and they have the priest and and all of the works and a and everything they're taking the Lambs and the sacrifices and all the ordinances and everything they're acting out they're carrying out to the letter and now here comes the great composer himself God made flesh amongst him uh proving that he was who he said he was that he was the son of man he said if you you don't believe my words believe my works for they testify of who I am and here they are they were disputing with the composer he was right on time right on Rhythm right in his place right in his position he was acting out every scripture that had ever been spoken of him and here they're disputing with them they're arguing with them I tell you if anybody was drama queens it was those Sadducees and Pharisees I I you know what's profound when you think about it you know the ark had already been carried away into Babylon and they're doing sacrifices what were they doing behind that curtain hey what were they sprinkling the ark wasn't even back there The Mercy Seat wasn't even back there where was The Mercy Seat it was walking right there in their midst and here they're just going about some big play and some big Act acting like they're holy and they're virtuous and oh look at us we have Moses to our father we hold everything to the letter and here's the word is made flesh amongst them they can't even recognize the Sheep music they're totally blind to what it say same thing happened in our day according to Divine promise God comes and veils himself in a prophet performing the word showing that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and everybody's just acting out of big old drama just getting all enthused speaking in tongues running around the building oh look God's with us we got a big move of God and couldn't even recognize the word being made flesh in their midst we get results don't we did you see how many people run screamed and shout it don't have nothing to do with it it has everything to recognize your day and its message to recognize what the composer is telling you to do to be in your position to be ready when he calls on you when it's your turn search the scriptures and them you think you have eternal life and they testify of me I like this we just say how the Lord would help us here just thinking about Israel and their condition and how they're just they're just going through the motions man lifeless no life it just dead works so dead and consumed with their Theology and their religion they can't even recognize God made flesh in their midst opening the blind eyes raising the dead you you open the Blind Man's eyes on the Sabbath on shabat I can't shows he's of the devil I mean how how insane can you be give glory to God how did this happen I told you and you wouldn't listen to me I was born blind and and he he he spit on my eye he put Mone on my eyes he said wash and now I can see all I know is I once was blind but now I can see you would think they'd be able to recognize the great composer is here with us oh he he he's orchestrating the greatest drama let's get in syn let's get in line but they were so blinded by their Creed they were lifeless the prophet says for Christ indeed is the life of the church she has no other life without him she is simply a religious Society a club a meaningless Gathering of people we just try to be about 15 more minutes a meaningless Gathering of the people as a corpse bejweled and dressed he says as a corpse bejweled and dressed is still a corpse so the church no matter what programs and her grace efforts might achieve without Christ she is a corpse also a Beed corpse lifeless I remember the first time I ever had to uh I was just a boy and and and uh you know I I wasn't prepared to go into that place and see my precious brother laying there uh just an older brother in the church that had gone on to see the Lord Lord but I was about 8 years old and uh I didn't really know what I was looking for looking at and uh my mom couldn't find me and she finally found me I was out in the station wagon just in a in a ball just balling because I was catching the gravity but see I didn't have the Revelation I didn't know oh that's just a shell our brother's changed he's just changed from one body to another now he's he's skipping on the Hills of Glory but you go in there and and and in the natural what do they do they do their best to doll it all up and make it look like somewhat of a shell don't they but without the life in there without life and there it's just a corpse listen to what he's saying it it's striking he says as a corpse bejweled and dressed is still a corpse if we're not careful we're just dressing oursel with knowledge just dressing oursel with religion just dressing ourselves with an idea of what we think is right and if you're not careful you're just a corpse Proverbs 21:16 would say the man that Werth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the Dead look at these words oh just just the man that Werth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead what a what a sight that the that he's saying the congregation of the Dead what a dreadful place to be and in a day when we see all this stuff about The Walking Dead and zombies and all of these things what is it it's like the devil's just showing the world a picture of of these lifeless corpse of people walking around a Congregation of the Dead oh you talk about a dreadful place but don't you realize around this nation and around the world there's church house after church house and all it is is a Congregation of the Dead they're dressed with their religious and their their thinking and all of their ideas and their Creeds they're sitting in pews all of them in a line all of them staring forward and they're lifeless it's a Congregation of the dead because they've wandered out of the way well that should behoove us friends there's only one place there's life and that's in this message if you wander out of the way of this message you become lifeless you just become a bejweled corpse with ideas and Theology and Creeds and dogmas with no life to be able to perform the word that you say you believe 1 Timothy 5:6 would say but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth I say oh God God help us Lord I don't want to be a lifeless corpse I don't want to be like the children of Israel just going through the motions I mean think about that here they're they're living the most strict life with the keeping of all of the law of Moses and they're just a bejweled corpse you get the picture and if we're not careful we come into the same condition void of the Life of Christ void of Works void of the moving of the spirit just going about our day doing what we would want to do like oh yeah I better show up for church for my religious Duty we need the spe we need that same Spirit of Life inside of us we need the life of God and there brother Brandon would go on and say speaking of I I just bypass that for time but he would say there there they're in the the the the uh Tabernacle and they're singing I believe Psalms 22 singing about the psalm of David my bones my bones they stare at them and they're singing a song and he says 200 yards away from the temple there was the true Mercy Seat hanging on the tree you talk about a lifeless bejweled corpse here they're going through all the motions and all the routine of what they that they think is making them Justified before God in their sight and yet the very everything they had a need of was hanging on a cross 200 yards away and I find many times you know that the the the devil he'll try to get you in a place and in a position where you become comfortable you become complacent you become satisfied with maybe the knowledge that you've gained and if you're not careful you start to do as the scripture says the man that Werth out of the way of understanding I say oh I don't want to be a Wanderer I want to get into the Sheep music I want to get in rhythm with the great composer I want to cry out to God say Lord Jesus I need to have you in my life Lord I need to be led by your spirit I want to act out the Sheep music this is the quote where he says that we'll just try to move through it um he said neither could they see that that was their their very God when he was hanging there on the cross and them singing the 22nd Psalms in the temple 200 yards away my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me they pierce my feet in my hands see all my bones they stare at me why hast Thou forsaken me and there the very God that they had sung about blind enough to have him tacked to a cross and didn't know it what a what a shame Ezekiel would talk about it in chapter 37 about the dry bones the valley of dry bones where life once was now there's a valley of dry bones and he comes and says it's the whole house of Israel here once was a mighty Church a mighty Army had Moses leading by a pillar of fire and Joshua leading by a pillar of fire and you had a mighty anointed king like David rise up and the wisdom of Solomon there what a what a marvelous time of Israel as it was and now you're reading in the scriptures what happened to him and says oh uh he he catches the vision he says look there's a valley full of dry bones where life once was now they're all dead he says this this is the whole house of Israel that's where Ezekiel 37 would say then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of Israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off by our parts they wandered away we're T tying that to the Sheep music what happened they they were always backsliding they're always getting away from the will of God if they would just repent and get back with the composer God would bless them some of us just need to repent Lord I'm sorry I messed up I made a mistake don't let Pride hold you down whatever you do just repent you ain't got to do pentant praise God he already paid the price for your sins just say Lord I messed up I've wandered away I feel like I'm sitting in the congregation of the dead now I don't feel the spirit of God in my life Lord I'm repenting I want to get back in harmony few more here just moving through it Jude 1111 says woe unto them for they have gone in the way of Cain and rang greedily after the heir of balam for reward and perished in the gainsaying of K these are spots in your Feast of Charity when they Feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without water carried about of winds trees whose fruits wither without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots no hope just dead and lifeless a bejweled corpse I say God forbid that we have people amongst us living in sins fulfilling this very scripture I say oh God may your word go right now strike to the heart say Lord I realize that I have just been stooped in Tradition I am void of the spirit of God moving in my life I am so out of Harmony and Rhythm of the word I look into my life and I can see the pattern that's laying in there my UPS and my Downs the things that I listen to the things that I watched I realize I am not in harmony Lord May the Life of Christ come into me and make me live the message change me Lord change my nature Lord I need a nature change you can clean up a pig what is he going to do and a lot of times that's what we do we go from meeting meeting Church to church we get all cleaned up we feel all good and we wonder why we fall into the same things because you need nature change if you see yourself in a in a in Cycles over and over and over and you wonder what just you need a nature change I mean it's it's awesome to go to meetings and and the presence of God move and you feel so refreshed and rejuvenated but if you're not careful you get deceived into thinking that you're okay when you don't examine your life and realize you know what I'm falling into the same traps I don't really have that overcoming power that I hear the composer talk about and Lord if it's laying there in the message if you say that I can be an overcomer if you say I can be more than a conqueror Lord if you you say greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world then Lord if that's what the Sheep music says Lord then I want to get in Rhythm I want to get in me Lord I want to die out to my way of thinking I want to die out to all of my all of my mistakes and all of my failures I want to look into your word and I want to find the sheet music I'm I'm done with all the drama I'm done with all the nonsense I'm done with work controlling my life I'm done with family control of my life I'm done with the situation and politics and everything and all the fear and scare that's in my life and I'm walking on head Shields and and I don't know what's going to come of this or that and sickness I'm I'm I'm done with all I'm going to start looking into the Sheep music and if you say Lord there's therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus Lord then that's what you said and if you're the composer Lord I'm getting in Rhythm I'm getting in harmony with that and when the devil tries to bring the condemnation when he tries to bring the guilt when he tries to bring all the things that are contrary to the Sheep music you say get away from me Satan get behind me I'm saying what the word says he goes on to say but with him in her midst with him motivating her she becomes to the wonderment of all his body the fullness of him that filth all in all an't that beautiful but with him in her midst with him motivating her she becomes the wonderment of all his body the fullness of him that filth all and all with him motivating you his life his power his leading his word his vision his drama his signs his wonders him telling you this is how revealing to you his will and brother brandham says this he says and that's the reason I believe those Visions because it's always declared to me to be the truth it comes from the word then if he says it that settles it now when it's declared like that there's no more guesswork it's going to be you can't be in a symphony or in an orchestra ra or playing the song specials or singing and you're just guessing what your part is it'll be really obvious it's why it's good to practice your song specials cuz we all know when you didn't practice you're not in harmony you're not in Rhythm the piano player doesn't know when to go what key it's okay if the Lord put on your heart sing sing maybe it's part of the drama and we need to get rhythm with and say praise God you moved on that brother's heart last minute without even preparing ation glory to God hallelujah but if you had time and hey let's Get Rhythm let's get in Harmony when it's declared like that there's no more guesswork it's going to be then you hear it thus sayeth the Lord because it's beyond the human thinking it goes up in the Realms of the Lord's thinking but you're standing here just as the vine just as a branch producing the fruit that's in the vine see God uses man and man only God doesn't use Machinery God doesn't use groups of men God doesn't use organization God uses individuals always God uses you and I want to say it's your turn the street music has turned down through seven Church ages and now it's your time we've struck the seventh seal it's the coming of the Lord the drama is set and now it's your turn to act out your the curtain's been pulled the stages said now it's your turn the light's shining on you the trumpet sounded do you hear the queue it's your turn now it's your turn to act out the drama don't leave it up to your pastor don't leave it up to the ministers don't leave it up to your brothers don't leave it up to your sisters you are the individual that Malachi 45 was talking about somebody ought to here ought to say that's me I'm the individual God doesn't use groups he doesn't use organization God uses individual God uses you the problem is is stage fright is real it's a real thing man sir you get you got it all you've done all the preparation you've gone over it 50 million times you got it down to the tea and everybody gets out they're all dressed they're all looking pretty the Q strikes it's your turn and you go what was my part I got good news we got 1,200 tapes we got a book cover to cover just look into it that's the Sheep music we'll just end on this note brother brandham uh he's talking about the boy in Finland and he had had the vision many years ago and it's amazing that he they he had them write it down in the fly leaf of their Bible and they're going through Finland and they come up on that scene uh you're familiar with it I believe brother Billy here just recently went through it and here they come up on this great scene in this accident and there the boys they're all laying on the street they're all mashed up and and you can imagine the feeling there on the street and everything and how how everybody would be feeling it's such a traumatic event event and the and the prophet got to looking around he says you know what I've seen them these mountains before he said where where have I seen this before he got to looking around and all of a sudden he realized he was he was he was stepping into that vision the very word of God that had been revealed to the prophet he was now fulfilling the vision and he said brother go go get the FL look in the fly leaf of that Bible and the prophet would say like this and he said and brother uh Moore run over to the car and got his Bible and said uh brown hair uh uh brown hair brown eyes about 8 years old poorly dressed crippled been mashed up by accident a rocky land said brother brandom that's it I said that's him oh my you don't know how that feels you know where you're at then that's that's what we need church is a spiritual revelation of the message of the hour and the will of God for our lives cuz then you know where you're at it doesn't matter how bad the situation looks it doesn't matter the finances it doesn't matter your health because if Satan can get you all scared and all worried and all fearful and wonder what did I do to deserve this then you're getting out of the sheet music but when you know where you're at and where you're standing upon the word of God he says you know where you're at then all Devils out of hell if he'd line everything there was in hell around it would never stop it Hallelujah he's talking about you you can line up every devil in hell to stop this bride from manifesting this message and say Satan doesn't got enough I'm Sorry Devil you ain't got enough to stop this bride from manifesting the spoken word you ain't got enough it's there it's got to happen now the only thing is just drama what a feeling that must have been now it's just acting out the part and if what what's on My Heart Church you're just acting out the drama of what's already been forseen in the mind of God you're going to make it you're ordained to make it you can't even fail because you're predestinated not to fail you can't miss it it's just a drama the race is already over you're running a race that's already finished I like those kind of races you you are already got first place you already finished you're just just go through the motions just say what the Sheep music says just say there's therefore now condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus just say blessed is the man whom the Lord would that's me I'm running a race that's already finished why because Christ the Forerunner has already gone before I said now I remember I knelt to this side in the vision when I prayed you have to do just as you seen it and I knelt down and they all gathered around I said now watch thus saith the spirit of God this boy's life will return to him and there he'd been dead they'd taken his pulse and everything he was gone so and all mashed up like that and I knelt down and I said Heavenly Father many thousands of miles across the sea in that lovely Nation Where I Come From America I said down there that night when you moved into that room in that lovely place and told told me that this would be and I testified of it and I stood and said you'd bring it to pass and now thy servant sees the day that is to be fulfilled I said I thank thee Heavenly Father for the power of the vision and I thank thee for all your goodness and now Eternal God author of life and Giver of all good gifts I ask you to bless this scene with your presence and when the angel of the Lord began to move down I said oh holder of this boy Spirit death according to a vision that God has already showed that you cannot hold this child therefore I call for this little soul to return to him in the name of Jesus Christ and no more than I said that the boy jumped to his feet just as normal and as well as he could be just as perfect and normal and whole as he could be oh Hallelujah I I that thrilled my soul because it was just drama and I say Malachi 4:5 has already prophesied over your life he's already spoke a vision over your life that you're going in a Rapture you might go by the way of the grave but if that same spirit that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead dwell in you it's going to Quicken your mortal body Saints you can't lose I mean you you nothing can you can't nothing can stop you from winning you're not going to lose there's nothing the devil can do to stop it I said say let's get away from the fear and the scare and realize I'm just acting out the great drama of God lord I realize that you've called me I realize that you've elected me I realize that you chose me and I realize the devil is trying to cause a bunch of drama he's trying to poison my mind he's trying to stir up stuff in the church but I'm ready to kick that Old Devil out of here devil get out of the church get out of my mind get out of my life I'm going to act out the drama according to the Sheep music according with the great composer has told me and I'm going to manifest every single word of God then you can be like David in the trial no matter how hard it gets no matter what you're going through and you can say yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over I'm just acting out the drama Goliath I apologize but you're you've entered into God's Great drama I've been anointed to be king that's God's plans for my life and now you are getting in the way so I'm just going to keep acting out the drama I don't know what the Goliath is in your life whatever whatever challenges are before you we if we can have a positive approach to whatever Calamity whatever trial it is and look at the positive Sheep music and and words of the composer and know that you're going to make it through spiritual revealed I want to just read that in closing how the how the prophet said that he said that spiritual revealed truth I just thought of that story of Peter cartright he said every man that's ever had the spiritual revealed truth of the will of God makes preparation for the fulfilling Peter cartright God told him hold me a Revival so what was he doing he was preparing he was washing windows he was getting ready for the Fulfillment and when the devil tried to interfere right he come up say what do you think you're doing well I'm I'm I'm washing windows what are you doing I'm going to hold a Revival he said not in my town you're not going to hold a Revival he said well God told me to hold a Revival well if you're going to hold a Revival then you're going to have to whip me first he didn't Flinch he didn't wonder he didn't start to well maybe this wasn't the will of God after all maybe I ain't the bride of Christ I got sick and I've been sick for this long now and I've been praying and you know what maybe I I really didn't have it all no no faith doesn't waver Abraham staggered not at the promise of God he was fully persuaded and Peter car right you God told me to hold a Revival and no matter whatever devil or person tries to get in the way I have a revelation of the will of God for my life he said so then if I got to go through you I'll just do that next and he got done washing the windows he pulled up his sleeves he put a whooping on him and invited him to church and he had a Revival on the man got saved oh I say that was part of the Sheep music if anything tries to interrupt what God said about your life just tell that Old Devil I'm acting out the great drama if I got to take care of this I'll take care of it next but I'm going to keep going forward in Christ God bless [Applause] you amen am amen you just keep staying with the word you know that's what you're doing tonight communion you're doing what the word word said to do prophet of God say there's healing in communion there's Deliverance in communion there's answers to your problems in communion you say wait a minute what does this have to do with communion it's just like our brother said you're you're doing the sheet music you're doing what he said to do and you're just going forward then everything just follows behind it amen these signs shall follow them that believe you just keep going and it just keeps happening you know I I really like that little part you know I I Billy mentioned it the last week and Matthew mentioned it tonight when the disciples had fished all night and they did everything they could do and the Lord said go out there and fish he said when they came in they came in with their own ability when they went back out there they went back with the word of God and that makes the difference you do all that you can do and we always do all that we can do but when it fits down to it when you go back with the sheet music and you go back with obedience to the word of God you'll get the result every time because he wants receive all the glory and I just thought I I just it just touched my heart when he said the sister was looking for a uh she needed some work so she went and read the book of jobs amen I thought that was good Matt when you hurt your hand did you read the book of Palms amen that's the kind of God we serve he's beautiful don't you love him I I just thought that was that was spectacular and and you don't sell yourself short don't count yourself out you're a part of it I remember how many people came up in the prayer line and I heard the Lord say to over and over again God created you to go to heaven he made you a part of the word don't let the enemy rob it from you amen don't let him don't let him bring you down you love the Lord amen it's time for communion now just think tonight this is what you're doing you're fulfilling your part of the word of God just like Matthew preached you're you're going through the motions of what he told you to do you're coming to partake in communion you're doing this in remembrance of him what he told us to do and and and you're fulfilling that and by it doesn't matter what your request is it doesn't matter what your burden is it doesn't matter what you're going through it doesn't doesn't matter the answers that you want you're going to receive your answers because you're fulfilling the word at Thy word Lord at Thy word I'll cast the net I toiled here all night I know there's no fish here the water temperature is not right there's nothing about it that will make sense but at Thy word amen how how would could you believe that Comm communion could be your healing communion could be your deliverance just obedience to the word of God could be very answer to everything that you want just walk out play out the drama Play Your Part come partake of the bread and the wine and you might just receive everything that you've ever wanted the life and everything God is hid in Simplicity and reveal he in the same amen let's stand together let's turn in our Bibles to Corinthians 1 Corinthians the 11th chapter and this is Paul now he received of the Lord and now now he's bringing what he received of the Lord and he knows that if they continue in this that there will be great blessings for the church it's hard to read these scriptures and believe that so many places don't even have communion just think they're missing they have all the puzzle built and this is that one last piece amen that puts it all together amen you you maybe you're praying for the Holy Spirit do you know you can receive the Holy Ghost through communion praying for answers you can receive answers through Comm communion the drama produces the result any man that has a spiritual revelation of the word of God makes preparation for the Fulfillment amen this is part of it tonight amen when you have communion tonight just don't come to perform the physical side of it come knowing that in performing the physical side of it there is a spiritual result amen that is the Fulfillment of the desire of your heart amen for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had SED saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come wherefor ever whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself amen that's what you do you just examine yourself and after you've examined yourself you made things right in your heart you you you you've re uh committed yourself and you reconsecrated yourself and and you've got back on the path and you said Lord I went astray like our brother preached but now I'm back I'm I'm back to fulfilling the sheet music and this is what Paul says he says he says he says but let a man examine himself there let him get back on the Sheep music and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unor the eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together un condation and the rest will I set in order when I come amen amen if the brothers would come me you let us you all pray with me for the bread and for the cup and and and and enter into the drama now take your part Lord I'm coming to do this I'm coming to fulfill your work I'm coming to partake and I know according to the word of God that in just me performing and acting out my place in the word of God that you have answers for my life our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we have this bread that recognizes your body Lord that was slain hung on Calvary for our sins Lord

unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them until the end and supper being ended the Vil having now put it into the heart of Judas scariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he raised us from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girth himself and after he had poured water into a basin and begin to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded he cometh to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord does thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know hereafter after and Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet kind of sounds like us sometimes don't it and Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou hath no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands in my head Jesus said to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every wit and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken His Garment and was set down again he said un to them know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and ye say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither is he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy are ye if you do them amen you believe that I believe that foot washing brings a joy to your heart God bless you I believe it's
