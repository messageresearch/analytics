[12:27] careful Lord to be thankful Lord for all
[12:29] your blessings and all your goodness and
[12:31] for your keeping hand and the fact that
[12:33] you ever reached out touched us father
[12:36] and called us into yourself the fact
[12:38] that you ever gave us an ear to hear
[12:41] Lord an eye to see Lord the fact that
[12:43] you caused us to know you to bring us to
[12:46] this place whatever place we may find
[12:48] ourselves according to your word is
[12:50] according to your hand Lord we just want
[12:53] to thank you we want to commit the
[12:54] service to you we pray father once again
[12:57] that you would have your way Lord that
[12:59] this would not be some service conducted
[13:02] of man Lord to be seen of men to hear
[13:04] from man Lord to be seen of each other
[13:07] or to clap one another on the back but
[13:09] Lord we come with one purpose that we
[13:11] might hear from you that we might lift
[13:14] up your name and that we we may welcome
[13:16] you in our midst Lord to do according to
[13:18] your perfect will Lord there are many
[13:20] needs that have come in that door and
[13:23] Lord we believe that there will be many
[13:24] victories that go out the b Lord we
[13:27] depend upon you now as we sit at your
[13:29] feet as we worship your name to hear
[13:31] from you and from your word and we pray
[13:33] that the service would be done according
[13:34] to your will in Jesus name
[13:37] amen you may be
[13:39] seated just a few
[13:42] minutes as we read our Psalm this
[13:45] morning you know probably one of the
[13:49] most sobering portions of
[13:52] scripture is found in Romans
[13:55] 1 and it
[13:57] describes you the tragic condition of
[14:01] those who according to verse 18 those
[14:04] who hold the truth in
[14:08] unrighteousness those who had the truth
[14:12] those who knew
[14:15] God but it says in verse 21 that when
[14:18] they knew
[14:19] God they glorified him not as
[14:23] God verse 22 professing themselves to be
[14:27] wise they became
[14:29] fools and changed the glory of the
[14:33] uncorruptible god into an image made
[14:36] like a corruptible
[14:38] man you know you continue to read the
[14:41] chapter and you can see the how
[14:44] someone's condition begins to
[14:47] deteriorate over time the
[14:49] danger of being
[14:52] religious without having a
[14:55] personal relationship with the Lord
[14:59] even sitting in a message
[15:02] Church you know among the statements
[15:04] used to describe these ones in verse 21
[15:09] as this short
[15:11] description neither were they
[15:16] thankful not
[15:18] grateful for what God has made available
[15:21] to
[15:23] them they don't recognize the value of
[15:27] it
[15:29] they don't value it even though they may
[15:32] intellectually understand it better than
[15:34] anyone
[15:35] else but you know like
[15:38] Esau so willing to set it aside for
[15:42] whatever shortterm thing they value most
[15:48] that
[15:50] day neither were they
[15:52] thankful because they don't recognize
[15:55] the value of what was given
[16:00] you know we're in a season of
[16:01] Thanksgiving it's a time where
[16:04] from you it's a time of remembrance
[16:06] going back to some of the earliest days
[16:08] in our country where small group of
[16:11] people set aside some time to express
[16:15] their gratitude to the Lord for bringing
[16:19] them through very hard first year for
[16:23] meeting their needs for guiding them for
[16:26] keeping them for protecting them
[16:31] but you know how much more should we be
[16:35] thankful for the work which God has done
[16:38] for
[16:40] us how should we recognize the
[16:47] value of what's been made available to
[16:49] us not as a people not as a church not
[16:53] as a religious belief but as
[16:56] individuals as individuals
[17:01] do we have the right level of
[17:06] gratitude you know we're going to read
[17:07] Psalm 116 this
[17:09] morning it's a portion of scripture
[17:12] which could best be described as a Psalm
[17:14] of
[17:16] Thanksgiving from one who recognizes the
[17:20] value of what God has done for
[17:24] them you know and anyone who's ever had
[17:27] that experience that relationship with
[17:30] the Lord
[17:31] should
[17:33] recognize this as their
[17:36] testimony from the very first verses I
[17:39] love the Lord because he hath heard my
[17:42] voice and my supplications because he
[17:46] has inclined his ear unto me therefore
[17:50] will I call upon him as long as I
[17:53] live and then down in verse
[17:56] 7 return unto thy rest oh my soul for
[18:00] the Lord hath dealt bountifully with
[18:04] thee for thou Hast delivered my soul
[18:07] from
[18:08] Death mine eyes from tears and my feet
[18:13] from
[18:15] falling you know and as we read that I
[18:17] wonder how many of us can say that's my
[18:20] testimony Look What the Lord Has
[18:25] Done you know look at the value of what
[18:28] he's done for each of us
[18:32] individually you know and the question
[18:34] is is do we
[18:36] demonstrate the right kind of
[18:39] gratitude for that
[18:42] work not wrapping ourselves in a
[18:46] religious
[18:48] lifestyle but still satisfying ourselves
[18:51] with short-term interests that we value
[18:53] more than
[18:55] him not commoditizing the work of the
[18:59] Lord down to a field of study or
[19:01] something to intellectually understand
[19:05] or achieve some kind of worship service
[19:08] or demonstrate how religious we are it's
[19:12] not the kind of expression of gratitude
[19:14] that he's looking
[19:17] for you know but each of us individually
[19:21] truly appreciating the value of the work
[19:24] that he's done for us individually with
[19:27] the right
[19:28] expression of
[19:32] gratitude so what is the right kind of
[19:37] gratitude what is the expression of
[19:40] gratitude that should result out of
[19:44] someone who truly appreciates the work
[19:47] that's been done for them
[19:50] individually Psalm 116:12 asks it this
[19:54] way what shall I Render unto the Lord
[19:59] for all his benefits toward
[20:02] me you know and that's the question
[20:05] isn't
[20:06] it how could I
[20:10] possibly what could I possibly offer
[20:15] him what should be the expression of my
[20:20] gratitude that is appropriate for what
[20:23] he's done for
[20:26] me does he expect me to devote myself to
[20:31] scriptural or message
[20:34] studies to demonstrate how deep I
[20:37] understand these
[20:38] things does he expect me to seek the
[20:43] deepest sermons or the most powerful
[20:45] worship services to participate
[20:49] in does he expect me to perform a
[20:52] certain amount of religious
[20:55] Works have the best Church attendance
[20:58] have the longest
[21:01] prayers or the most
[21:04] Miracles what shall I
[21:07] Render unto the Lord for all his
[21:10] benefits toward
[21:13] me he says in verse
[21:15] 13 I will take the cup of
[21:20] Salvation and call upon the name of the
[21:25] Lord I will pay my vows on to the Lord
[21:28] now in the presence of all his
[21:33] people take a hold of what he's
[21:37] offered lay a hold of that cup of
[21:41] Salvation that he's offered
[21:45] me there's a way made I am the way the
[21:51] truth and the life and no man cometh
[21:55] unto the father but by me
[21:59] lay hold of him and do not let him
[22:06] go call upon the name of the Lord
[22:08] identify yourself with his name amen not
[22:11] the name of a man or a movement or a
[22:15] person or a
[22:16] gift but with him am you know if you're
[22:20] really grateful for
[22:22] something you don't ever let it
[22:25] go you don't easily set it down
[22:30] you don't set it aside for one minute
[22:33] even to experience something
[22:37] else you know it's not like Esau who was
[22:41] so willing to sell his Birthright for a
[22:43] shortterm
[22:46] satisfaction but it's more like his
[22:48] brother Jacob who wrestled all night
[22:51] with the angel of the Lord and said I
[22:53] will not let you go until you bless me
[22:56] am
[22:58] and then he says this this expression of
[23:01] gratefulness I will pay my vows unto the
[23:04] Lord now in the
[23:07] presence of all his people you know four
[23:10] times in the Psalms it speaks of paying
[23:13] my vows before the
[23:16] people two of those times is right here
[23:18] in Psalm
[23:21] 116 but what does it mean to pay my vows
[23:24] what
[23:26] vows
[23:28] what shall I Render unto the Lord for
[23:30] all his benefits toward
[23:33] me you know if you look up those Hebrew
[23:35] words that phrase pay my
[23:37] vows actually means to complete or
[23:41] finish something that was
[23:45] promised a vow is a promise a commitment
[23:49] to do something a
[23:52] promise has been made and our expression
[23:56] of gratitude is to fulfill are part of
[23:59] the
[24:00] promise know Paul goes into great detail
[24:03] about this in Hebrews but the best way
[24:06] to sum it up is when he summarized it in
[24:08] Romans
[24:10] 12 I beseech you therefore
[24:13] Brethren by the mercies of
[24:16] God because of the mercies of
[24:19] God that you present your body is a
[24:22] Living
[24:24] Sacrifice
[24:26] holy accept unto
[24:29] God which is your
[24:32] reasonable
[24:35] service
[24:37] why that you may
[24:39] prove demonstrat amen manifest
[24:44] show what is that good and acceptable
[24:48] and perfect will of
[24:51] God to pay my
[24:53] vows is to perform that part of his will
[24:58] or his word that he has set aside for me
[25:02] to perform that's how I express my
[25:05] gratefulness not with my study not with
[25:08] my powerful church services but doing
[25:11] the work completing the work fulfilling
[25:14] the promise paying my
[25:17] vows
[25:19] individually
[25:22] completely that we might complete the
[25:24] work that he set for us to do let's go
[25:26] ahead and stand this morning what shall
[25:28] we Render unto the Lord for all his
[25:31] benefits does our expression of
[25:35] gratitude show the value we put on the
[25:38] work he has done for us me
[25:42] you let's read that short Psalm 116 this
[25:47] morning in this Psalm of
[25:50] Thanksgiving I love the Lord because he
[25:53] hath heard my voice and my supplications
[25:56] because Heath inclined his ear unto me
[25:59] therefore will I call upon him as long
[26:01] as I live the Sorrows of death compassed
[26:04] me and the Pains of Hell G hold upon me
[26:07] I found trouble and sorrow then called I
[26:11] upon the name of the Lord oh Lord I
[26:13] beseech thee deliver my soul gracious is
[26:16] the Lord and righteous yay our God is
[26:19] merciful the Lord preserveth the simple
[26:22] I was brought low and he helped me
[26:25] return unto thy rest oh my soul for the
[26:28] Lord hath dealt bountifully with me for
[26:30] thou Hast delivered my soul from Death
[26:33] mine eyes from tears and my feet from
[26:36] falling I will walk before the Lord in
[26:38] the land of the living I believed
[26:41] therefore have I spoken I was greatly
[26:43] Afflicted I said in my haste all men are
[26:46] liars what shall I Render unto the Lord
[26:49] for all his benefits toward me I will
[26:52] take the cup of Salvation and call upon
[26:55] the name of the Lord I will pay my my
[26:57] vows unto the Lord now in the presence
[27:00] of all his people precious in the sight
[27:02] of the Lord is the death of his Saints
[27:05] oh Lord truly I am thy servant I am thy
[27:08] servant and the son of thine handmade
[27:10] thou Hast loosed my bonds I will offer
[27:13] to thee the sacrifice of Thanksgiving
[27:16] and will call upon the name of the Lord
[27:18] I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in
[27:21] the presence of all his people in the
[27:24] courts of the Lord's House in the midst

[38:09] Gathering of uh uh Saints you know
[38:12] Saints uh people from from Nigeria that
[38:14] we know and so uh on our way back on
[38:17] Monday this past
[38:19] Monday uh you know the East Coast maybe
[38:21] I lost my orientation of time uh because
[38:24] you know central time is different from
[38:25] the East time so maybe I wasn't paying
[38:28] too much attention and um I got too
[38:31] close to the time that my the plane was
[38:33] going to fly and so we started hurrying
[38:36] up you know I told my wife we got to
[38:37] hurry up and we hurried up we got to the
[38:40] airport and unfortunately when we got to
[38:43] the airport they for some reason they
[38:45] took our bag to the side it was like uh
[38:46] we got to check your bag a little extra
[38:49] because you maybe you have something in
[38:50] there and I was like oh why this time
[38:53] you know I'm running late already but
[38:55] you know they have to do what they have
[38:56] to do so I kept quiet and while standing
[38:59] there I said oh Lord I set it out in
[39:02] fact my wife was right next to me I
[39:03] thought she was heing I said oh Lord
[39:05] please can you delay the plan for me
[39:06] just 2 minutes or 5 minutes so I can
[39:09] catch up with the plane if I don't my
[39:11] wife is going to work the next day I
[39:13] don't know you know you know the delay
[39:15] that might get you in 20 I don't know
[39:16] when I will get to Texas in fact when I
[39:19] was checking the plane every other plane
[39:21] gets to Texas the next day uh because
[39:23] there's got to be a layover and all of
[39:25] that and this is just a direct flight
[39:26] from Virginia down to Texas I would be
[39:28] in Texas in two two two plus
[39:31] hours and uh I I said oh God please can
[39:34] you delay this PL just five minutes
[39:36] immediately I said that something told
[39:38] me oh no you going to miss this PL I'm
[39:40] like oh my goodness and so immediately
[39:42] said that you know this is me thinking
[39:45] okay Mark David you're talking to
[39:46] yourself again but then I said you going
[39:48] to miss this it says you're going to
[39:49] miss the Spain so I was like okay fine I
[39:52] kept quiet and the only thing that I
[39:54] could say out of my mouth was oh look
[39:56] Lord the fact that I'm going to miss
[39:58] this plane does not mean you cannot hold
[40:01] that plane for me for two more minutes
[40:03] and that's what I said I said okay what
[40:05] I was agreeing is I would miss the plane
[40:08] but I just prayed to you in fact I said
[40:10] your son is requesting this from you
[40:12] Lord and so the fact that you said no I
[40:14] would miss this plane it doesn't mean
[40:16] you cannot do it in fact you can do it
[40:18] but since you chose not to do it then
[40:20] I'll accept that immediately I said look
[40:24] if you do that you know I would testify
[40:25] you know I would I would go there and
[40:27] tell everybody what you did uh uh the
[40:30] moment that I said that it was like no
[40:32] don't worry I'll give you another reason
[40:34] to
[40:35] testify so you know this is Mark Davy
[40:37] talking to himself I just kept quiet and
[40:39] you know we did all we got to do and we
[40:41] got to the plane in fact when I was
[40:43] getting to the gate the plane was
[40:44] pulling out I was seeing the plane it
[40:46] was just moving out I was like oh my
[40:48] goodness yes I did I missed it and the
[40:51] man that was on the counter said oh you
[40:53] were the one you missed your plane you
[40:54] the only one we were waiting on but you
[40:56] missed it and he said and he was looking
[40:58] at you know the screen and he said oh
[41:00] Mark David is a lucky guy and I was like
[41:02] what do you mean he said I'm going to
[41:03] get you in another plane in fact the
[41:05] plane right next to me that's going to I
[41:07] think uh Charlotte nor Carolina I'm
[41:09] going to get you on that plane but
[41:11] that's just a layover you you get there
[41:13] and then you from there go to Texas and
[41:15] I was like is is the you know connecting
[41:17] flight he going to get to Texas today he
[41:19] was like yes and in my mind I'm like so
[41:23] this is me now my human thinking was
[41:25] like well God is this what you said you
[41:27] still going to give me a reason to
[41:28] testify for because regardless these
[41:30] people's got to get me home one way or
[41:32] the other I was like they have to get me
[41:34] home so this is me just thinking okay
[41:36] they would get me home
[41:38] regardless um and I was like okay thank
[41:41] you very much and in fact it said it
[41:42] twice oh Mark David you a lucky guy I
[41:44] was like okay thank you thank you very
[41:46] much and um for some reason at some
[41:48] point in time they got me on the plane I
[41:49] got to not Carol you North Carolina and
[41:51] we stay we were going to stay there for
[41:52] Just 2 hours and we're going to get to
[41:54] Texas maybe around 11 or 12
[41:56] I was like uh okay I'll still give test
[41:59] I'll still testify for it but then while
[42:01] getting on that plane I you know I
[42:03] rushed my wife to get on the plane so I
[42:05] packed most of her stuff in my jacket my
[42:08] my her wallet that everything that she
[42:10] has is in that wallet uh bank card you
[42:13] know kids card and all that stuff so I
[42:16] took that wallet and put it in my jacket
[42:18] somewhere like that I packed everything
[42:20] and I got in the plane because it was a
[42:22] connecting flight I was sitting in a
[42:23] different seat she was sitting in a
[42:25] different seat and so the plane got to
[42:27] North Carolina we got down she was the
[42:29] first one cuz she was right up front she
[42:31] was the first one to get out the plane
[42:33] and so I got out the plane with all the
[42:34] bags and all that stuff as well and U my
[42:37] boy was you know in the car seats and so
[42:41] um my wife saw the wallet her wallet she
[42:43] saw it with me when I was getting out of
[42:45] the plane and I knew I kept it there and
[42:48] so uh we asked the lady I was like where
[42:51] am I going to get the you know the
[42:52] connecting flight and she said you have
[42:53] to walk the hottest side of the airport
[42:56] which is like almost a mile or two I'm
[42:58] going from E to C that's a long walk and
[43:02] so I was like okay no problem I took my
[43:04] wife and the kids I was like okay let's
[43:05] walk down then my wife was let's just go
[43:07] there and sit down it doesn't matter if
[43:08] it's 2 hours don't let us miss this one
[43:11] I was like okay and so we walked all the
[43:13] way down there almost two two miles we
[43:16] walked down there we got there my wife
[43:18] looked at me and said where's my wallet
[43:19] I was like I gave it to you she's like
[43:22] no you did that so I looked at my jacket
[43:24] it wasn't there oh my goodness I started
[43:26] freaking out she was like look my my ID
[43:29] card everything is in that wallet I was
[43:31] like okay you sit down here let me just
[43:32] quickly go back probably when I was
[43:34] trying to put the baby in the caret it
[43:36] fell off I said I don't know and I was
[43:38] like she was walking right behind me I
[43:39] was like did you see it fall because I
[43:42] was having a lot of loads on me or bags
[43:44] on me she was like no I didn't see
[43:45] anything fall I walked all the way down
[43:48] there everybody in the airport was
[43:50] looking at me like this guy must have
[43:51] lost something and I was telling him yes
[43:53] wallet you know and you know it was
[43:55] almost towards the trans Thanksgiving
[43:57] weekend there was a lot of people in
[43:59] fact we were walking this way so close
[44:01] to each other in my mind I was like oh
[44:03] this wallet is gone and so I got all the
[44:05] way back to that lady that told us where
[44:07] we need to go and I said please I lost
[44:10] my wallet my wife's wallet please did
[44:12] you find it and she was like no I didn't
[44:15] find anything and I started ask asking
[44:18] around they said they couldn't find it I
[44:20] should go report that to Lost and Found
[44:22] and so I went I called Lost and Found I
[44:25] told him to say no we didn't nobody
[44:26] turned in anything I was like oh in fact
[44:29] one lady walking with American Airlines
[44:31] said it's gone you better start calling
[44:32] the banks and tell them to cancel your
[44:34] cards and all of that your credit cards
[44:36] and all that good stuff I quickly called
[44:38] my wife and said hey stop canceling all
[44:40] that card I think this is gun and so I
[44:42] walked all the way back again two miles
[44:44] back to where my wife was sitting and I
[44:46] sat down and I was just like oh my
[44:48] goodness and my wife was like oh what we
[44:50] going to do I was like I don't know I
[44:51] mean we just have to call everyone in
[44:53] fact she's caned some she was on the
[44:55] call with another one to cancel another
[44:57] one and um she was like maybe I should
[44:59] go back and look for I was like I just
[45:01] walked two miles you want to it's
[45:03] nothing I was like okay you know what
[45:05] Something Told Me stand up and walk back
[45:07] to the same place that I was coming from
[45:09] I was like I just came back there I
[45:10] haven't even rest two minutes and I have
[45:13] to walk back but then I was very
[45:15] obedient and I just stood up I told her
[45:18] take the baby I'm going to walk back
[45:20] down there and I just did I just thought
[45:22] I won't tell you what why I was walking
[45:25] back there cuz I was was walking so
[45:26] dejected I was just dragging my feet and
[45:29] the lady was like you found it I said no
[45:31] I said I told you it's gone call the
[45:33] bank and cancel it I walked all the way
[45:35] back down there and when I when I got
[45:38] there back to the lady again she said
[45:40] did you find it I was like no I did not
[45:42] and something told me to go sit down
[45:44] exactly where my wife was sitting before
[45:46] we stood up and left and I sat down
[45:48] there I was tired just sitting down so I
[45:51] could rest before I can take another M
[45:53] you know mile and a half back again and
[45:55] and for some reason the lady said okay
[45:58] wait a minute let me check a particular
[46:00] place for you I was like okay go ahead
[46:02] and she walked down there she checked
[46:03] and she came back like unfortunately I
[46:05] can't find it there but wait a minute
[46:07] let me do one more checking and she went
[46:09] into another office and checked and she
[46:12] came back and she said we might be lucky
[46:14] what's the name of your wife and I told
[46:16] her this is my wife's name this is
[46:17] everything and it's the same last name
[46:19] as mine and she went in there and she
[46:22] looked in that office she called I don't
[46:23] know she called someone she looked in
[46:25] that office and when she came out she
[46:26] came out with the wallet and I just
[46:29] screamed I screamed so much because it
[46:32] was just God telling me to go back get
[46:34] up the wait and just go back and go find
[46:37] it I just came back from there and so
[46:39] everything that I was that I thought I
[46:41] was talking to myself was not really
[46:43] talking to myself but was really just
[46:45] God ordering my footstep just telling me
[46:47] what it is to do and so when that
[46:49] happened I just screamed when I was
[46:51] coming back the lady that kept on asking
[46:53] me is lost I said she said you find find
[46:55] it I said I found it this time and she
[46:58] just started screaming she said that was
[46:59] God because it's supposed to beun and I
[47:02] like thank you that's God and so I I
[47:05] just I want to
[47:07] appreciate I I just want to appreciate
[47:10] God because he's just so mindful and the
[47:13] only thing I could just say when I was
[47:14] coming is oh Lord help my unbelief help
[47:17] me help me that I you know I'm not doing
[47:19] that maybe I didn't do up to 100% of
[47:21] what you want I just looked at myself
[47:23] and said oh God for everything that
[47:25] you've done for me and what I'm

[1:07:24] trust you're happy to be in the house of
[1:07:25] God this morning um let's open in uh
[1:07:28] Romans chapter
[1:07:30] 7 and
[1:07:33] uh before we read that I want to read a
[1:07:35] quote that uh brother monam
[1:07:39] uh uh read this is the invisible Union
[1:07:43] and uh paragraph 23 he says now in
[1:07:45] Romans 7 trusting that that you have
[1:07:49] your Bible open it says uh everywhere
[1:07:51] now across the country we want want to
[1:07:54] read closely now it says this message
[1:07:56] out of uh this message out of here so
[1:07:59] he's taking the text out of here it
[1:08:01] seems like it's uh it's on marriage and
[1:08:04] divorce but it it really isn't to me
[1:08:07] it's a prophecy for the church in the
[1:08:10] last day and I want to that's the title
[1:08:13] I want to give it the prophecy for the
[1:08:15] church in the last day so let's open in
[1:08:18] Romans 7 it says though ye not
[1:08:21] Breen uh for I speak to them that know
[1:08:26] the law how that the law has dominion
[1:08:29] over a man as long as he liveth for a
[1:08:32] woman which has a husband is bound to is
[1:08:36] bound by the law to her husband so long
[1:08:39] as he liveth but if uh if the husband be
[1:08:43] dead she she's loose from the law of her
[1:08:47] husband so if so then if while her
[1:08:51] husband liveth she's married to another
[1:08:54] she shall be called adulteress but if a
[1:08:57] husband be dead she's free from the law
[1:09:00] so that she is no adulterous though be
[1:09:04] though she be married to another man
[1:09:07] wherefore my brethren ye are Al ye are
[1:09:10] also ye also are become dead by the
[1:09:15] law to the law by the body of the of
[1:09:19] Christ that ye should not you should be
[1:09:22] married to an another even him who
[1:09:25] raised from the dead that we should
[1:09:28] bring forth fruits unto him now I like
[1:09:31] verse five and six it says for when we
[1:09:34] were in the flesh the Motions of sin
[1:09:37] which were which were by the law did
[1:09:40] work in our members uh it says to bring
[1:09:44] forth fruits unto death so we were
[1:09:47] because we were in sin we were in the
[1:09:49] flesh we brought forth fruits everything
[1:09:52] that we brought forth was subject to the
[1:09:54] same so it was the fruits of the fruits
[1:09:56] of the sin and the fruits of law it says
[1:09:59] but now ye are delivered from the law
[1:10:02] that being dead wherein we were held
[1:10:05] that we should serve in newness of
[1:10:08] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[1:10:11] letter let's just bow our heads father
[1:10:13] we ask that you bless your word to us
[1:10:14] this morning in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:10:17] amen may have your seats let's also open
[1:10:20] our Bibles once again um in in Psalm uh
[1:10:26] uh
[1:10:27] 107 uh verse one as we read here Paul is
[1:10:31] speaking it said that we when we were in
[1:10:36] the flesh the Motions of sin which were
[1:10:41] by law by the law did work in our
[1:10:43] members to bring forth fruits unto death
[1:10:46] but now we are delivered from the law
[1:10:50] that being dead wherein we H we we were
[1:10:53] held that we should serve in newness of
[1:10:57] the spirit so there's a newness of the
[1:11:00] spirit that has to be manifested there's
[1:11:03] the fruits of the newness of the spirit
[1:11:05] that are different from the law of sin
[1:11:07] that we were bound under in Psalm 107
[1:11:11] And1 uh David speaks and he says oh give
[1:11:15] thanks unto the Lord for he is good for
[1:11:19] his mercy endureth
[1:11:21] forever let the Redeemer of the Lord say
[1:11:24] so whom he had redeemed from the hands
[1:11:27] of the enemy and gather them out of the
[1:11:30] land from the East and from the west and
[1:11:33] from the north and from the south he
[1:11:36] said they wandered in the wilderness in
[1:11:38] solitary way they found no City to dwell
[1:11:42] in hungry and thirsty their soul
[1:11:44] friended in them it says then they Cried
[1:11:47] unto the Lord in their trouble and he
[1:11:50] delivered them out of their distress how
[1:11:53] many can testify to that that's our
[1:11:55] testimony this morning and he led them
[1:11:59] forth by the right hand by the right way
[1:12:03] it says that they might go to the to a
[1:12:06] city of habitation oh that man should
[1:12:11] praise the Lord for his goodness for He
[1:12:14] is wonderful works for his children of
[1:12:17] for for his wonderful works for the
[1:12:18] children of man for he satisfieth the
[1:12:22] longing soul and filth the hungry soul
[1:12:25] with goodness such is such as it sits in
[1:12:30] darkness and then the shadow of death
[1:12:32] were Bound in Affliction of an iron
[1:12:36] because they rebelled against the word
[1:12:38] of God and contem counsel of the most
[1:12:42] high therefore he brought down their
[1:12:44] hearts with labor they fell down and
[1:12:48] there was none to help them then they
[1:12:50] Cried unto the Lord in their trouble
[1:12:54] and he saved them out of the distress I
[1:12:57] love this kind of God every time you cry
[1:13:00] he's there to help you every time you
[1:13:02] are in distress you cry out he's there
[1:13:04] to serve you he's there to make sure
[1:13:07] that you know that he's your god is's
[1:13:09] there to comfort your soul and he said
[1:13:11] he brought them out of darkness and the
[1:13:14] shadow of death and and break their
[1:13:16] bands in suer he said oh men that and
[1:13:20] all that men should praise the Lord he
[1:13:23] said says for his goodness and for his
[1:13:25] wonderful works for the children of men
[1:13:27] for he had broken the gates of brass and
[1:13:31] cut the bars of iron in
[1:13:34] suer this morning I just want to say
[1:13:37] it's you know as we we could recognize
[1:13:41] it to be the season of
[1:13:44] Thanksgiving it's It's always important
[1:13:47] as humans and in even as mankind that we
[1:13:50] could just take a moment to to to
[1:13:53] remember the things that God has done
[1:13:55] for us you know it's it's in men's
[1:13:58] nature to always look for the next great
[1:14:01] thing you know we so very very seldom
[1:14:05] take time to just sit down and examine
[1:14:09] the things that God I like that song We
[1:14:11] Sing count your blessings because what
[1:14:14] it tells you is often time we are always
[1:14:16] looking for the things things that we
[1:14:18] don't have you know you get this you buy
[1:14:20] a house well I need a car you buy a car
[1:14:23] well I need this I need furniture and I
[1:14:25] need that and I need you get this it's
[1:14:27] always the next thing the moment you get
[1:14:29] it your mind automatically switches over
[1:14:32] to the next thing that you want to get
[1:14:34] and it becomes just an unsatisfying
[1:14:37] cycle that you run through oh my car is
[1:14:39] old I need a better this I need a better
[1:14:42] that but we very seldom take time to to
[1:14:45] just be thankful for what God has done
[1:14:48] for us if even this morning we just to
[1:14:51] look at ourselves and just say even in
[1:14:53] the natural you can come in this morning
[1:14:55] and say it's important for me to reflect
[1:14:58] upon my own life and see where God has
[1:15:01] gotten me out of and where he's brought
[1:15:03] me into as children of God it's
[1:15:06] important we take a moment to be
[1:15:08] thankful we're thankful for eternal life
[1:15:12] you know the prophet will tell us if we
[1:15:14] would lose if a man will be given 10,000
[1:15:17] years and all the riches of the world
[1:15:20] and all of that and it said that if you
[1:15:22] will be given not against eternal life
[1:15:24] he said I will take eternal life even if
[1:15:27] I had to suffer for 10,000 years it says
[1:15:31] I know that after my suffering are over
[1:15:33] I will have eternal life so if we can
[1:15:36] this morning just uh uh consider the
[1:15:40] things that God has done for us in our
[1:15:42] lives consider where he's taken you from
[1:15:45] consider how many things has done for
[1:15:48] you since your birth and what you know
[1:15:51] and what you don't know consider the
[1:15:53] good health that he's giving you this
[1:15:55] morning consider the things that uh uh
[1:15:58] from the very natural life that you are
[1:16:00] living in you had good health God has
[1:16:03] given you that amen you can move your
[1:16:05] your members you can walk you can do all
[1:16:07] those things God has there how many are
[1:16:10] in the hospital this morning and and and
[1:16:13] being operated on and being sick and
[1:16:16] going through all kinds of things and
[1:16:18] and but you are here this morning and
[1:16:21] God has has woken you up out of your bed
[1:16:23] and has brought you to church so you can
[1:16:25] come and hear the word of God I'm
[1:16:27] thankful for
[1:16:29] that you you consider the importance of
[1:16:33] of how that God has gathered us from all
[1:16:36] corners of the earth no man can put this
[1:16:39] together you you couldn't get all this
[1:16:42] Nations gathered here together to hear
[1:16:44] one word to hear the same word and to
[1:16:47] agree upon it you couldn't get 10,000
[1:16:50] scientists to agree on the same thing
[1:16:53] but yet the Lord has build it so
[1:16:55] wonderfully and he's taken the scripture
[1:16:57] says he shall have a bride out of every
[1:17:00] nation every Kindred every country on
[1:17:03] Earth God will have a bride that will be
[1:17:06] represented and we ought to be thankful
[1:17:08] of it this morning God has given us
[1:17:11] families for those that are married and
[1:17:13] he's given us children he's given us
[1:17:15] home to stay and his giving us all of
[1:17:17] that we ought to be thankful of those
[1:17:20] things how many are are starving and are
[1:17:23] hungry and they don't have anything and
[1:17:26] yet we are this morning and God has
[1:17:28] given us all we ought to be thankful for
[1:17:30] it we ought to be thankful for one
[1:17:33] another we can't take this for guarantee
[1:17:36] if you've been in this church long
[1:17:38] enough you'll see that there are faces
[1:17:40] that were here that are no longer here
[1:17:43] so we don't just want to say well it'll
[1:17:45] continue on every moment we ought to be
[1:17:47] cherishing it and thankful for it oh I'm
[1:17:50] thankful for my brother and I'm thankful
[1:17:53] for my S my S not criticizing one
[1:17:56] another not coming oh look at how it's
[1:17:58] dressed oh look at how no but thankful
[1:18:01] and prayerfully saying that if he if God
[1:18:04] brought him here God can change his
[1:18:07] dressing God can touch his heart he
[1:18:09] could do more so she could become the
[1:18:12] very Christian that she needs to
[1:18:15] be there has to be a Thanksgiving
[1:18:17] message out of the believer that's why
[1:18:20] when we share the gospel we don't share
[1:18:23] it in the stand point that behold I'm
[1:18:25] Sav and you are lost no you will never
[1:18:27] win that person but if you can try to
[1:18:29] show him that you are thankful that
[1:18:32] you're just trying to tell him what God
[1:18:34] has done in your heart you're just
[1:18:36] trying to have him to understand that
[1:18:38] you didn't make yourself what you are
[1:18:41] you didn't change yourself you didn't
[1:18:43] make yourself believe this message God
[1:18:45] caus you to believe this
[1:18:47] message that's where the thank
[1:18:50] Thanksgiving come from why because it's
[1:18:52] his love love towards you that causes
[1:18:54] you to love one
[1:18:57] another we ought to be thankful for a
[1:19:00] church a place we can come and
[1:19:03] worship we got to be thankful for a
[1:19:06] pastor that loves the word that stays
[1:19:08] with the word and all the pastor Whose
[1:19:11] desire is only to point you to what the
[1:19:14] prophet say how many people are out
[1:19:16] there trying to give you explanation
[1:19:18] well the prophet didn't really say that
[1:19:20] when he said that he meant that I don't
[1:19:22] want your explanation I want what the
[1:19:25] prophet said because the the word was
[1:19:27] not given to you it was given to the
[1:19:30] prophet and the prophet brought it and
[1:19:32] he said repeat what I said amen yes a
[1:19:35] prophet that a pastor that holds on to
[1:19:38] that he wants you to listen to the
[1:19:40] message I was telling a
[1:19:43] brother the other day I said when we
[1:19:46] come to church the beauty of it is we
[1:19:49] are here if you listen to tapes and you
[1:19:51] listen to what the prophet said when you
[1:19:53] come into the church you are only
[1:19:56] hearing the echo of what you've been
[1:19:58] listening to and that's what you amening
[1:20:00] to you don't want to Amen to something
[1:20:03] new something great or whatever you want
[1:20:06] what the prophet or what the preacher is
[1:20:08] saying to much what the prophet has
[1:20:09] already
[1:20:14] said that we be thankful for one another
[1:20:18] th be thankful to be a member of the
[1:20:21] Bride what what what what what
[1:20:24] characteristics do I have to even
[1:20:27] qualify for this I
[1:20:29] don't what what did I do to Merit this I
[1:20:33] didn't do anything he chose you he
[1:20:36] elected you he placed you as member of
[1:20:39] his bride we ought to be thankful for
[1:20:41] that thankful as children of God but
[1:20:45] when will say and in this message I just
[1:20:48] love it it said paragraph 32 it
[1:20:51] says I'm thankful to God to be to be
[1:20:56] living in the time of the closing scene
[1:21:00] of the his of the his of the world
[1:21:03] history he says he says I don't know I
[1:21:07] don't know
[1:21:09] if if I would have been if it says if I
[1:21:12] had to say so before the foundation of
[1:21:14] the world and God would have laid out
[1:21:17] the whole program to me and said to me I
[1:21:21] want I want you to preach I want you to
[1:21:24] preach and now what age would you desire
[1:21:27] to go in the earth and preach he said I
[1:21:31] would have chosen this
[1:21:33] age now when we when we go home and I'm
[1:21:38] just talking in church I want this to
[1:21:40] Echo out within our lives when we go out
[1:21:43] of here are we really in understanding
[1:21:47] of what the prophet is saying here he's
[1:21:49] saying for I think this is the Golden
[1:21:52] Age
[1:21:53] he says I certainly would have loved to
[1:21:55] have been here during the time of his
[1:21:58] visitation but still I think this right
[1:22:01] now is the greatest time he says because
[1:22:05] it's the time that is coming to take the
[1:22:07] people that is redeem oh I hear people
[1:22:10] say well you know you over there you
[1:22:13] know you talk so much about the prophet
[1:22:15] and everything and all of that it says
[1:22:17] how about Jesus Christ let me say this
[1:22:19] to you this morning Jesus Christ died so
[1:22:22] we can have this day today what Jesus
[1:22:25] did but said that what he died he didn't
[1:22:28] finish the work that he wanted to do the
[1:22:30] part that he did was he paid the price
[1:22:32] on Calvary he paid the price of
[1:22:35] redemption but there had to be a time
[1:22:38] where not another person he himself will
[1:22:41] come so he can claim that which he died
[1:22:43] for and we are living in that
[1:22:46] time amen this is not the time where for
[1:22:50] you to look back and say well I don't I
[1:22:53] don't have to have this I don't know
[1:22:55] everything that a Believer is supposed
[1:22:57] to have Christ is here to claim it back
[1:23:00] for you he's here so you can have it
[1:23:02] back whatever you desire so you can have
[1:23:04] it back it's the time of whatever was he
[1:23:08] died for he's here to redeem it he's
[1:23:10] here to take it back from the hands of
[1:23:12] the devil but what says here is the book
[1:23:15] the book of redemption he was taken out
[1:23:18] it says when men lost it Satan couldn't
[1:23:20] touch it because of his dirty head
[1:23:23] he went back in the hands of the
[1:23:24] original owner but God didn't create the
[1:23:27] book for himself he created it for a
[1:23:30] people and then in the end time the same
[1:23:33] God he comes down to take the same book
[1:23:36] and puts it right back into your
[1:23:40] hands you say what do you mean we saw a
[1:23:45] prophet with that book in his hands he
[1:23:49] manifested the same thing that Adam did
[1:23:51] in the beginning why God is showing you
[1:23:54] this is the time I'm not taking you just
[1:23:57] right back to Pentecost I'm taking you
[1:23:59] way past Pentecost I'm taking you right
[1:24:02] from the beginning where it all started
[1:24:04] when I created man in my own image so
[1:24:08] you can be my very
[1:24:11] representation oh so he will
[1:24:14] say and he says and we we know that
[1:24:19] history is closing
[1:24:21] out
[1:24:24] it says let me skip it I I skipped a
[1:24:27] little bit it says he redeemed near the
[1:24:29] resurrection when the redeem will come
[1:24:31] forth he says what a glorious
[1:24:33] opportunity we have to speak to a dying
[1:24:36] people he says great time we are unused
[1:24:40] about it we we have something to be
[1:24:43] unused about we we a Christian cannot be
[1:24:47] sad a Christian it has to be the
[1:24:50] happiest person that's on the face of
[1:24:52] the Earth Earth and it's not your
[1:24:54] happiness shouldn't be connected to how
[1:24:56] many worldly Goods you have your
[1:24:58] goodness cannot communicate cannot be uh
[1:25:01] directly connected to whether you have a
[1:25:03] job or don't have a job or how well you
[1:25:05] feel or how sad you feel no you your
[1:25:08] your happiness is directly connected to
[1:25:10] the fact that God gave you eternal life
[1:25:14] God saved you God promis that he will
[1:25:17] give you whatever you have need
[1:25:20] of oh yes he says and we know that
[1:25:23] history is closing out and the world
[1:25:25] history will be soon be over and we are
[1:25:29] going to step into the new day he says
[1:25:32] that great Millennium that it says that
[1:25:35] great Millennium it says that one that
[1:25:38] that that that as one Believers I
[1:25:41] believe it says in the Millennium in a
[1:25:43] millennium reign with Christ A Thousand
[1:25:46] Years upon the Earth the physical Return
[1:25:49] of the Lord Jesus to take a physical
[1:25:52] people
[1:25:54] glorified by his cleansing
[1:25:58] blood it it's a great day that we are
[1:26:00] living in and and we we we we need to be
[1:26:04] appreciative of it you know we we've
[1:26:07] said it and it's been said all uh uh uh
[1:26:10] uh many times that God could have chosen
[1:26:12] this age and and assign it to one called
[1:26:15] Moses or or Elijah or one of the great
[1:26:18] prophet or even his own disciples he
[1:26:21] could have taken it and giving it to
[1:26:23] them so they can come and live it this
[1:26:25] day I want you to imagine Peter James
[1:26:27] and John living in this age and what
[1:26:30] they would have done in all those things
[1:26:32] you can look at it and say that was
[1:26:33] going to be glorious but God thought
[1:26:36] that it would be glorious that you could
[1:26:38] be here that you will do it not Peter
[1:26:41] James and John not Moses but you because
[1:26:44] and the prophet will tell us it's not
[1:26:46] because of the greatness of man it's
[1:26:48] because of the greatness of
[1:26:50] God because the same god who caused them
[1:26:53] to do great things in daytime that same
[1:26:56] God is here to cause you to do great
[1:26:58] things so don't beler yourself and look
[1:27:01] at yourself of no value you have a great
[1:27:04] God your value is the fact that you
[1:27:06] believe in a great
[1:27:13] God oh that will be appreciative and and
[1:27:16] the sense of Thanksgiving in recognition
[1:27:19] of the goodness of what God has been is
[1:27:22] doing in this time oh that God could
[1:27:24] choose you to be here in this time and
[1:27:27] he says but when I'm will talk about it
[1:27:29] says it's God's grace and mercy that
[1:27:32] done it now I'm speaking about
[1:27:35] Thanksgiving message it's God's grace
[1:27:38] and mercy that DED it it's not because
[1:27:42] we we somehow we better than the others
[1:27:45] no God allocated it God chose this one
[1:27:48] to be in this age that I want to be in
[1:27:50] the other age we had nothing to do it
[1:27:52] that was God's sovereignty but we are
[1:27:55] thankful for God's sovereignty that we
[1:27:57] could be here to see it
[1:28:00] all it was by his grace by his Mercy his
[1:28:04] great love as the scripture will says he
[1:28:06] has chosen you and I to be here because
[1:28:09] not because of our we are good but
[1:28:11] because God is good he said not because
[1:28:14] we deserve it but because of his great
[1:28:17] love that he will choose us you think
[1:28:19] about billions that are out there
[1:28:24] you think about how many are out there
[1:28:27] and they're growling in sin and darkness
[1:28:31] and don't know anything about God but
[1:28:33] yet you are here this morning sitting in
[1:28:35] the house of God listening to the word
[1:28:37] of
[1:28:39] God bam will say and B Mike mention it
[1:28:42] about the pilgrim fathers butam says and
[1:28:46] he said they were happy that they found
[1:28:49] they had a new way of life and a new
[1:28:51] land land he he says here it says you
[1:28:55] may
[1:28:56] say that's all good to say with
[1:28:59] Thanksgiving he says you think about it
[1:29:01] brother Bram he says here it is it says
[1:29:04] quarter till 9 I didn't have nothing
[1:29:07] much but Thanksgiving it says what a
[1:29:09] message for the occasion yes indeed he
[1:29:11] says the pilgrim father were very
[1:29:14] thankful for the new way found new new
[1:29:17] found way of life being separated from
[1:29:20] the old English denomination and Creeds
[1:29:23] he says they could they could they could
[1:29:25] marry to the new anointed word of their
[1:29:29] age he says that's right the new
[1:29:31] anointed word of their age for their day
[1:29:35] he says so can we be thankful so can we
[1:29:39] be thankful as Pilgrim like Abraham
[1:29:42] separated ourselves separate ourselves
[1:29:45] from the things of the world and all of
[1:29:48] our association Abraham was a pilgrim
[1:29:51] God has said separated us from all the
[1:29:54] dead religions it says I'm speaking
[1:29:57] Across the Nation now all the dead
[1:30:00] Creeds it says and to what separate us
[1:30:05] to open to us a new land a new message
[1:30:09] for this
[1:30:12] day th this is not a message just like
[1:30:16] the message gone by this is a new land
[1:30:19] this is a new place remember there were
[1:30:21] what were they happy about they were
[1:30:23] happy for the new land in other word god
[1:30:26] opened to them a new land that they can
[1:30:28] go and live in so I want to say this
[1:30:31] don't get stuck in L here God has opened
[1:30:34] up to us a new land what is a new land
[1:30:36] it's a new land where all things are
[1:30:38] possible it's a new land where whatever
[1:30:41] you ask God shall give it to you it's a
[1:30:44] new land where there's no sickness where
[1:30:46] there's no headaches where there's
[1:30:48] nothing he's bringing you into this new
[1:30:50] land where you don't operate operate by
[1:30:52] the power of men you operate by the
[1:30:54] power of
[1:30:56] God a new land a place where they can do
[1:31:01] things not because of their own power
[1:31:03] but because of what God has done for
[1:31:06] them Pentecostal dried up he said like
[1:31:10] Luther and Wesley and the rest of them
[1:31:12] it was no more a bunch of churches
[1:31:14] pulled together God's people in there
[1:31:17] yet it says God people yet God's people
[1:31:20] in there yet
[1:31:22] as uh it says it's got It's got to come
[1:31:25] out it says what did he do he opened up
[1:31:28] the Seven Seals of the the seven seal of
[1:31:32] of the last of the last message he says
[1:31:35] you notice that the seven seal which all
[1:31:38] the mystery of the seven Church Ages was
[1:31:41] sealed with Seven Seals it says the
[1:31:44] reformers didn't have the time to do it
[1:31:47] in their day they didn't they didn't
[1:31:49] live long enough but this blessed
[1:31:52] revelation of the seven seal it's open
[1:31:55] to us in the last day from a prophecy
[1:32:00] that went on forth in
[1:32:04] Arizona and I want to ask this morning
[1:32:07] what is the Seven Seals being open mean
[1:32:10] to
[1:32:12] you what does that mean to you because
[1:32:16] we have to know what is it that I'm
[1:32:17] appreciative about the Seven Seals
[1:32:20] brought Jesus Christ back on Earth the
[1:32:23] Seven Seals took the very word because
[1:32:26] remember you were dead in sin and
[1:32:29] denomination God promised that in the
[1:32:31] last day that he will have a bride
[1:32:33] according to his own choosing God
[1:32:36] promised that he would have a bride that
[1:32:38] will be just like him and the only way
[1:32:41] you could be just like him is for him to
[1:32:43] come down and dwell in you right outside
[1:32:47] of that all you have is intellect is
[1:32:49] your own understanding but it promise at
[1:32:52] the opening of the seal he took the book
[1:32:54] he brought it down he told you to eat
[1:32:57] the book why because he's giving you
[1:32:59] right back to you the very power the
[1:33:02] very the very uh uh book that was lost
[1:33:05] in the Garden of Eden so you can have
[1:33:07] the same Authority the same life that
[1:33:10] was in him he poured it into the church
[1:33:14] he poured it into his own people why
[1:33:16] that you can become his very
[1:33:18] representation in the last day
[1:33:27] the scripture will speak in Matthew and
[1:33:30] he
[1:33:31] says blessed are your
[1:33:37] eyes for they see and your ears for they
[1:33:42] hear for verily I say unto you that many
[1:33:46] prophets and righteous men has have
[1:33:49] desired to see those things things which
[1:33:52] you see and have not seen them and not
[1:33:56] heard and to hear those things which you
[1:33:58] hear and have not heard
[1:34:00] them the scripture will speak and say
[1:34:04] this man they kept looking for it for
[1:34:07] what Manner is it it speaks and it said
[1:34:10] that the spirit it speak expressly
[1:34:12] saying of what Manner would it be that
[1:34:14] the spirit of God will come and will do
[1:34:16] these things they wanted to know what
[1:34:18] time but God hid it from them and he
[1:34:21] revealed it to you in Luke 1023 he said
[1:34:25] and he turned unto them unto his
[1:34:28] disciples and he said privately he said
[1:34:32] blessed are your eyes which see the
[1:34:35] things which you see for I tell you that
[1:34:38] many prophets and Kings have desired to
[1:34:41] see those things which you see and have
[1:34:44] not seen them and hear those things
[1:34:47] those things which he hear and have not
[1:34:49] heard them in second Corinthians 4 and6
[1:34:52] and said for God who commanded the light
[1:34:56] to shine out of Darkness has shined
[1:34:59] light in your in our hearts now let me
[1:35:03] say this it's not you shining the light
[1:35:07] it's not you Desiring the light God
[1:35:10] decided to shine the light in your heart
[1:35:14] to give you the light of the knowledge
[1:35:16] of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[1:35:20] Christ he's the one who shes the light
[1:35:22] Matthew 16 and 17 and said and Jesus
[1:35:25] answered and said unto them blessed are
[1:35:28] thou Simon bar joural for flesh and
[1:35:30] blood has not revealed this unto you but
[1:35:33] my Father which is in heaven so you want
[1:35:36] to get a revelation it has to come from
[1:35:38] the father it's the father's doing him
[1:35:41] taking the Revelation placing it in the
[1:35:44] believer's heart not your doing God
[1:35:47] choosing who gets the
[1:35:50] revelation
[1:35:54] oh I want to say
[1:35:56] this it's a good we have a good father
[1:36:00] what a wonderful father he is that he
[1:36:03] would choose to give us his revelation
[1:36:05] we are a blessed people that we can
[1:36:07] reveal this re we can get this
[1:36:09] Revelation and I want to say this
[1:36:11] morning then if our eyes are blessed
[1:36:14] then we need to keep him away from the
[1:36:16] things of the world if our ears are
[1:36:18] blessed then we need to keep it away
[1:36:20] from the fthy of the word why because
[1:36:23] they are blessed so you can serve it for
[1:36:25] God they are blessed so you can use it
[1:36:28] for God they are blessed so you can
[1:36:30] receive something from God they are not
[1:36:32] blessed so you can take it and use it
[1:36:34] for anything they are blessed because
[1:36:36] God has given you an understanding of
[1:36:39] his own
[1:36:41] word oh my there's so many scriptures I
[1:36:44] want to read right now and the pro and
[1:36:48] so in in the prophet will speak speak in
[1:36:51] this message it says that this as we
[1:36:55] read the scriptures in Romans chapter 7
[1:36:58] uh the prophet will
[1:37:14] say cannot have two living husbands that
[1:37:19] one has to die amen
[1:37:22] that one has to die before you can be
[1:37:25] married to another he he's saying that
[1:37:27] this is an illustration he said it and
[1:37:30] an illustration is a visual
[1:37:32] representation of a concept to help
[1:37:35] someone see and understand something so
[1:37:38] here he speaks and and as we read it uh
[1:37:42] uh paragraph 37 he says Paul here is
[1:37:44] giving an illustration of the scripture
[1:37:47] about the law and Grace an illustration
[1:37:50] it it says in it's like a marriage and
[1:37:52] divorce it says this passage is very
[1:37:55] seldom preached
[1:37:56] on because it's more or less it says
[1:38:00] pertaining like marriage and divorce but
[1:38:03] it says but it also pertains to a
[1:38:05] greater portion of marriage and divorce
[1:38:07] on how that he's trying to set listen to
[1:38:11] this how he's trying to set in order
[1:38:14] here that as CH as a church can no more
[1:38:19] be married to the world and cry and to
[1:38:22] Christ at the same time and be legal and
[1:38:26] loveful about it now remember because
[1:38:30] the the the the whole purpose of this
[1:38:32] message as he's preaching it he's saying
[1:38:35] that he's using the natural to really
[1:38:37] typify the spiritual so he wants as we
[1:38:41] can take the natural room and examine it
[1:38:43] and see what the principle is he wants
[1:38:46] us to tie to the spiritual and be able
[1:38:49] to understand the spiritual princi
[1:38:51] principle that God has given to us so he
[1:38:53] saying that the church the church can no
[1:38:56] more be married to the world and Christ
[1:38:59] at the same time and be legal and lawful
[1:39:02] about it that it could be from that he
[1:39:05] that than he could be for a woman to be
[1:39:07] to be living with a husband while she's
[1:39:10] uh she's got a living husband and I have
[1:39:13] my own thoughts on that it says and I
[1:39:15] believe that the Bible what the Bible
[1:39:17] says uh what the Bible uh the Bible says
[1:39:20] is to truth so here he is we we cannot
[1:39:24] claim to be the Church of the Living God
[1:39:28] we cannot claim to be the Bride of Jesus
[1:39:31] Christ and be married to both the world
[1:39:34] and the word at the same
[1:39:37] time now and often time when you say
[1:39:41] that people receive it in some kind of
[1:39:43] condemnation oh you're trying to tell me
[1:39:46] I'll go to hell no yes the prophet is
[1:39:48] trying to help you understand here is
[1:39:51] how you can maximize your potential here
[1:39:55] is how you can be better at what you
[1:39:57] you're supposed to be here is how you
[1:40:00] can get out of the things of the world
[1:40:02] here is how you can get out of sin and
[1:40:05] become The Virtuous bride here is how
[1:40:08] you can tell the devil I have no part
[1:40:10] with you because God elected me to be
[1:40:13] something else so I when I say it I want
[1:40:16] you to have that in your mind don't let
[1:40:19] the devil beat you down this morning and
[1:40:21] say well that means well if you are
[1:40:23] partaking of the things of the world you
[1:40:24] are lost in all of that he's saying that
[1:40:27] you cannot legally do
[1:40:30] that you otherwise you'll be called an
[1:40:33] adulterous you're not supposed to do
[1:40:35] that you're not supposed to trust God in
[1:40:38] some things and Trust in your own
[1:40:39] ability in others like our brother was
[1:40:42] speaking here our minds is always the
[1:40:44] source of our trouble God will drop
[1:40:47] something we'll try to interpret it
[1:40:48] otherwise well does it mean this does it
[1:40:51] mean that does it mean this we always
[1:40:53] have some ways to explain it out and the
[1:40:55] prophet is saying stop doing that you
[1:40:59] you cannot claim to be the bride of
[1:41:01] Christ because why because by definition
[1:41:05] the bride of Christ lives by every word
[1:41:07] that Christ
[1:41:08] speak yes
[1:41:10] sir we cannot depend on Christ and
[1:41:14] depend on our own selves we cannot do
[1:41:17] that we got to quit doing that we cannot
[1:41:20] on something we we do it according to
[1:41:23] our own thinking in another we take the
[1:41:25] word you got to take the word every time
[1:41:28] and I don't care what the result is you
[1:41:30] take the word why because when you take
[1:41:33] the word you put the responsibility upon
[1:41:35] the
[1:41:39] husband so now he's speaking about this
[1:41:42] church
[1:41:43] and and the Bible will speaking will say
[1:41:47] in Matthew 6 and 24 it says no man can
[1:41:50] can serve two masters for either he will
[1:41:53] hate one and love the other or else he
[1:41:57] will hold on to one and despise the
[1:41:59] other ye cannot serve God and
[1:42:03] Mamon so here's the same principle being
[1:42:06] repeated over and over 1 John 2:15 it
[1:42:09] says love not the world that neither the
[1:42:12] things of the world if any man loves the
[1:42:15] world it says For the Love of the father
[1:42:17] is not in him it says for all all that
[1:42:21] for for all that is in the world is the
[1:42:24] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[1:42:26] the pride of eyes it says in this the
[1:42:29] father is and is not of the father for
[1:42:32] it says but but but is of the world
[1:42:35] James 4 and4 says that for for ye
[1:42:39] adulterers and adulterers he says know
[1:42:42] ye not that friendship with the world is
[1:42:45] imity to
[1:42:49] God
[1:42:51] whatsoever therefore will be friends
[1:42:54] with the world will be an enemy to
[1:42:58] God and the the devil's
[1:43:03] lie excuse
[1:43:12] me
[1:43:16] and is always to cause the believer to
[1:43:19] mix the two
[1:43:22] well I can let you go to church that's
[1:43:24] not a
[1:43:26] problem but after you come from
[1:43:29] church I have some things for you to
[1:43:33] do how many knows what I'm talking about
[1:43:36] it's a daily
[1:43:38] fight you you say I'm going to go to
[1:43:41] church something Breaks Loose oh we need
[1:43:44] you at work and we have need of you well
[1:43:47] I go I'm going to church why you're
[1:43:49] always constantly he's going to place
[1:43:51] you that way you're going to have to
[1:43:53] make a
[1:43:54] decision it it's it's he's inner working
[1:43:57] he's running out of time so his job is
[1:44:00] to always put you in situations where
[1:44:03] you're going to have to pick one over
[1:44:05] the
[1:44:06] other where you're going to have to make
[1:44:08] a decision where you're going to have to
[1:44:10] fight that battle over and over every
[1:44:12] day of Our Lives we're going to have to
[1:44:14] fight as long as we're still in this
[1:44:17] world he will always well you know you
[1:44:20] got bills to pay so if you go to that
[1:44:22] church and you don't take the overtime
[1:44:24] how are you going to pay the
[1:44:27] bills and what do we do well I need the
[1:44:32] overtime so I can pay the bills and then
[1:44:35] I'll go serve God God said no you can't
[1:44:38] do
[1:44:39] that this woman they because now
[1:44:43] remember when he's speaking he he's now
[1:44:46] bringing in view what he calls the
[1:44:48] natural church and this spiritual church
[1:44:52] so the natural Church butam says that
[1:44:55] it's it it comes by men's
[1:44:58] interpretation it's a it's the church
[1:45:00] that's that grows by knowledge by
[1:45:02] intellect it's the it's the church all
[1:45:05] they contend with as they come they read
[1:45:07] the Bible and then they go back and they
[1:45:09] do their own thing and and all of that
[1:45:11] and said blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:45:14] no but the spiritual church there's a
[1:45:17] supernatural that has to
[1:45:19] happen I I want you to hear me now
[1:45:22] there's a supernatural that has to
[1:45:24] happen I I was sharing this with Brother
[1:45:26] David let me say this when the urum
[1:45:28] tandem was given when a man will come
[1:45:31] and he will speak something if nothing
[1:45:34] flashed out of it you had the right to
[1:45:36] not believe
[1:45:39] it I if we believe the word of God and
[1:45:44] nothing flashes out of here to change
[1:45:46] your life you have the right to walk
[1:45:49] away why why because this is the urum
[1:45:52] tendem of God it's full of the
[1:45:54] supernatural every time you read it the
[1:45:57] honor has to come and flesh the
[1:45:59] supernatural before you otherwise you
[1:46:01] have the right to deny
[1:46:04] it we we cannot be a church that's just
[1:46:07] built on I'll do this and I'll do this
[1:46:10] like our pastor preached last time the
[1:46:12] the first church they had no Bible they
[1:46:15] had no person to tell them whatever what
[1:46:17] was it they were moved by the spirit of
[1:46:20] God
[1:46:21] they knew Peter James and John they said
[1:46:23] money I have Silver and Gold Have i n
[1:46:26] but that which I have what did they have
[1:46:29] they knew they had the promise of God
[1:46:31] they felt the power in the being they
[1:46:34] knew that the same power that was in him
[1:46:36] was in
[1:46:40] them we can't prosper in intellect what
[1:46:44] we need is for God to take his word and
[1:46:47] Flash it in our lives give us the
[1:46:50] Supernatural where we can speak the same
[1:46:53] word and it will come to pass where we
[1:46:55] can stand upon the same word and God
[1:46:57] will make it
[1:47:03] happen so it
[1:47:11] says notice this Char this
[1:47:15] characters when you see the woman just
[1:47:17] go on and ramp it just do doing anything
[1:47:21] that she want to do watch the church is
[1:47:24] doing the same
[1:47:27] thing it says but watch when the
[1:47:30] spiritual bride when she begins to have
[1:47:34] a Revival when she begin to come back
[1:47:38] and line and and come back and line
[1:47:41] herself up with the word of God watch
[1:47:44] then again you see how that there the
[1:47:48] scripture at the time there will be a
[1:47:51] message strip up uh strip out to catch
[1:47:54] the bride catch that woman elect for it
[1:47:58] says for as the world Satan the deceiver
[1:48:01] who deceives the first bride is it says
[1:48:04] the sinning again against the word by
[1:48:07] misbelieving his
[1:48:10] word he's always there to cause you to
[1:48:14] disbelieve the word of God God heals you
[1:48:18] he's there to bring new symptoms yeah
[1:48:20] you know oh you were healed well that
[1:48:24] cancer you thought it was gone it's back
[1:48:26] why because I'm feeling pain exactly
[1:48:29] where the cancer was and then your mind
[1:48:31] starts working on you and then you start
[1:48:34] thinking am I did I really receive
[1:48:36] healing was I really do this was was I
[1:48:39] why he always there to try to Buffet you
[1:48:42] he always there to try to cause you to
[1:48:44] dis believe the word but a True Believer
[1:48:46] of the spiritual church will always
[1:48:48] stand upon the word of God
[1:48:50] because it's not up to her to vindicate
[1:48:53] herself the message itself will
[1:48:55] vindicate itself God will make his word
[1:48:59] true and now today we see the church
[1:49:02] natural in an intellect in the gospel he
[1:49:05] says he goes further and further away
[1:49:07] from the word in Social Gospel they will
[1:49:11] preach and they will come and you know
[1:49:13] the church becomes like a social event
[1:49:16] and we'll have a a gathering for this
[1:49:18] and a gathering for this and Thursday
[1:49:21] night this and you know come and
[1:49:23] drinking night or coffee night and this
[1:49:26] it becomes just a social event and let
[1:49:29] me say this I know I'm running out of
[1:49:30] time I won't be able to finish but
[1:49:32] whatam said the church had a commission
[1:49:35] to do when God placed the church on
[1:49:37] Earth she had a work to do and the same
[1:49:40] way that the woman had the work to do
[1:49:42] the church had the work to do but what
[1:49:44] them said God give her charge she was
[1:49:47] given her charge for her to have the
[1:49:49] virtue of of the Lord Jesus Christ she
[1:49:51] was given three things he said the first
[1:49:54] one was the woman uh uh the woman word
[1:49:57] that she was given and the purpose for
[1:49:59] the woman word was for her to only but
[1:50:02] says her character was only for her to
[1:50:05] be attached to a
[1:50:08] husband and the next one was woman word
[1:50:12] it says the purpose for that was for
[1:50:14] them for him to Bear children for her
[1:50:16] husband and the third one he says was
[1:50:18] for her to honor her hus
[1:50:20] husband and so if we take the Natural
[1:50:23] Woman we move it to the spiritual woman
[1:50:26] you tell me what church is now bringing
[1:50:29] children honoring her husband and is
[1:50:32] there only given to her
[1:50:39] husband oh I like this great
[1:50:42] preacher is that your
[1:50:45] husband oh I I I like this and this book
[1:50:48] over here it is that the voice of your
[1:50:51] husband and brother will say you'll take
[1:50:53] the Bible and show them what the Bible
[1:50:56] says they will believe preacher over the
[1:51:01] Bible there'll believe some explanation
[1:51:04] from somebody instead of taking the
[1:51:08] word oh our Pastor said last time he
[1:51:10] said people say well I listen to the
[1:51:13] message then I listen to the preacher to
[1:51:16] balance it out oh
[1:51:18] really
[1:51:21] I guess we have different ways or
[1:51:22] different need for listening to the
[1:51:24] message I listen to the message because
[1:51:26] it's spiritual food in this
[1:51:29] season I listen to it so when the
[1:51:31] preacher preaches something else I won't
[1:51:33] take
[1:51:38] itall if it's not the word don't take
[1:51:41] it spew it out if it's the word embrace
[1:51:46] it why because the word is your husband
[1:51:50] the word is what's been given to you to
[1:51:53] change you so this sacred virtue that
[1:51:56] she was given the woman world the mother
[1:51:58] world and and and the honoring of her
[1:52:01] husband the church has lost but bam says
[1:52:03] in the condition that the church is in
[1:52:05] today they cannot fulfill that
[1:52:10] commission why because the focus is no
[1:52:13] longer Jesus Christ the focus is no
[1:52:17] longer what God is wanting to do in the
[1:52:20] hour that we are living in the focus is
[1:52:22] now oh we're going to go this great move
[1:52:24] we're going to go do this we're going to
[1:52:26] go do that you the the husband is no
[1:52:29] longer being regarded and let me just
[1:52:32] read some of the things the prophet said
[1:52:33] here for the second of
[1:52:35] time now as we read as I said he speaks
[1:52:40] about this and baram said what we need
[1:52:43] today is a
[1:52:45] killing we need we need to die to our
[1:52:48] own thinking
[1:52:50] we we need to die to our own
[1:52:52] interpretation if if something is not
[1:52:55] the word you got to kill
[1:52:57] it you you got a to produce God don't
[1:53:01] want us to be lukewarm where we are
[1:53:04] attached to the world and then attached
[1:53:06] to the word he don't want you to do that
[1:53:09] when you do that you become an
[1:53:12] adulterous you become one who doubts the
[1:53:14] word you become one who's not fully
[1:53:17] committed what God wants to do he wants
[1:53:20] to manifest himself to you so by
[1:53:23] believing the word you are taken out of
[1:53:26] your cycle and put into God's
[1:53:31] cycle he says
[1:53:34] this he says
[1:53:37] this in the message I will restore it
[1:53:39] says what we need today is an
[1:53:42] oldfashioned skyu sin killing religion
[1:53:46] sweep across the country the old time St
[1:53:48] Paul Revival it says the baptism of the
[1:53:51] Holy Ghost into the church again he says
[1:53:54] the best defense the better defense than
[1:53:57] any atom bomb that ever was created
[1:54:01] that's right fundamental but God was
[1:54:04] Vindicated in his church what we need is
[1:54:07] not uh uh some great things out of here
[1:54:10] we need the fundamental of the word of
[1:54:13] God to know that Jesus Christ is the
[1:54:15] same yesterday today and forever what he
[1:54:18] promised he will do he is going to do it
[1:54:21] he doesn't need your help to do
[1:54:28] it let's not get be lost and you know we
[1:54:31] don't have to produce something so God
[1:54:34] can accept
[1:54:36] it we need to believe the word and let
[1:54:40] the word produce what he needs to
[1:54:42] produce out of
[1:54:43] us in the hidden life in Christ brother
[1:54:46] bam says paragraph uh um 32 two he says
[1:54:51] now we don't have to get some kind of uh
[1:54:54] makeup and and and some kind of
[1:54:56] emotional mental makeup we don't have to
[1:54:59] we don't have to take something that the
[1:55:02] something the devil would would hand
[1:55:04] down but every believer that comes from
[1:55:08] the that comes from the altar to the
[1:55:11] consecrated life to the baptism of the
[1:55:13] Holy Ghost cannot only be it canot not
[1:55:17] only be a mouthful but a soul full of
[1:55:20] the original
[1:55:22] baptism oh I tell you when I read that I
[1:55:25] said God I need that this morning I need
[1:55:27] to go and take some manner A Soulful not
[1:55:31] a MTH full but A Soulful something that
[1:55:34] will satisfy something that will change
[1:55:36] me something that I can say I was this
[1:55:39] and I'm no longer that something that
[1:55:42] God himself can
[1:55:45] produce I don't want to goow today at
[1:55:47] the altar tomorrow at the altar my
[1:55:49] desire is God you reveal your word I
[1:55:52] want to receive it and be changed and
[1:55:54] never be the
[1:56:01] same but a soul full of the original
[1:56:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost that fell on
[1:56:06] the day of Pentecost that brings the
[1:56:08] same result as it did on the day of
[1:56:10] Pentecost
[1:56:11] amen the message of the hour will
[1:56:14] produce the same
[1:56:17] result as what he did at Pentecost when
[1:56:21] the spirit fell on Pentecost it was to
[1:56:24] fulfill the word of that hour but God in
[1:56:27] the end time he has another word for
[1:56:30] this hour and the word for the end time
[1:56:32] hour is that God will produce sons and
[1:56:35] daughters that are even like him those
[1:56:38] that will walk according to his word
[1:56:40] those that will believe his word and
[1:56:42] believe every bit of
[1:56:47] it for the promise for the the promises
[1:56:50] unto your children and your children's
[1:56:52] children and to them that are far off as
[1:56:54] many as our Lord God shall call he said
[1:56:57] brothering the same holy spirit that
[1:56:59] fell on the day of Pentecost that
[1:57:01] brought the results then will bring the
[1:57:04] same
[1:57:05] result over every believer tonight
[1:57:08] that's willing to consecrate their life
[1:57:10] and to enter and enter into the holiest
[1:57:13] of Hest by the blood of Jesus Christ let
[1:57:16] me just skip some for the sake of time
[1:57:20] he
[1:57:26] says he says here in the world is Fallen
[1:57:29] apart he says what we need
[1:57:33] today is an old
[1:57:35] fashion
[1:57:37] backwards sky blue sin killing religion
[1:57:41] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost back
[1:57:44] into the church again and and a cleaning
[1:57:47] out it says b uh Gun Barrel straight sky
[1:57:51] blue religion we need a cleaning out and
[1:57:55] the starting all over
[1:57:59] again we we let me say this mixing will
[1:58:03] only produce
[1:58:05] death we we don't want to come to church
[1:58:08] and be the mixer of our own ideas is our
[1:58:11] own thinking with the word of God we
[1:58:14] don't want to come here with some half
[1:58:16] belief and oh we'll believe this but
[1:58:18] when it says over here we really don't
[1:58:21] understand we'll believe every word of
[1:58:23] God what the prophet said we'll say Amen
[1:58:26] to it if it says he takes the new birth
[1:58:28] this morning I say God I need the new
[1:58:31] birth in order for me to get there if he
[1:58:33] says this is what you need to do that's
[1:58:35] what I will do so I can get there so
[1:58:38] it's not my own interpretation but it's
[1:58:40] what he said that's what I
[1:58:44] believe and butam says as we said she
[1:58:48] yes she is is this woman she's
[1:58:52] interested oh my she's
[1:58:56] interested but will say she's interested
[1:58:59] with certain
[1:59:01] characteristic and he goes on and he
[1:59:03] said no other woman was created like
[1:59:08] this
[1:59:09] woman the church or Eve he says if you
[1:59:15] look at all out of the animal and all
[1:59:17] out the kingdom no other species could
[1:59:20] commit adultery but the woman
[1:59:24] could I want you to listen to this so
[1:59:28] and and the prophet will say she was
[1:59:30] created she was
[1:59:33] special I and I I I I'm speaking about
[1:59:36] the woman but I want you to look at
[1:59:38] yourself there was something special
[1:59:40] about her but whatam says this but
[1:59:42] because she was cast over to the other
[1:59:45] side she had been given a sacred charge
[1:59:48] from God
[1:59:49] for
[1:59:51] Redemption she's got a characteristic
[1:59:54] that must be not be
[1:59:56] defiled so because of the role that she
[1:59:59] was given no other woman no other
[2:00:02] species female could fit that same
[2:00:05] characteristics now I want you to hear
[2:00:07] now if I can expand for just a moment
[2:00:10] but what I'm speaks in the T church is
[2:00:12] he says this let us go back to the
[2:00:15] beginning in the original physical
[2:00:17] creation As We Know it today God made
[2:00:20] every Everything a pair male and female
[2:00:23] there was two uh uh chickens or rooster
[2:00:26] in hand there was two cattles cow and a
[2:00:29] bull and right down the line but when it
[2:00:33] came to a man there was only
[2:00:35] one it says there was only one pair one
[2:00:39] not a pair Adam had been made in the
[2:00:42] image of God he was a Son of God as a
[2:00:47] Son of God he could not be temped
[2:00:49] tempted and
[2:00:50] fall it says that would be impossible so
[2:00:54] God took a byproduct of man to cause to
[2:00:58] cause the fail woman he says never
[2:01:01] stepped fresh never stepped fresh from
[2:01:04] the hands of God as the
[2:01:07] man as a as a
[2:01:10] man as a man a true product of God she
[2:01:14] was produced from
[2:01:17] man are you
[2:01:20] listening he says now when God caused
[2:01:24] her to be brought forth from man she was
[2:01:28] vastly different from other females and
[2:01:31] he created and that he had created she
[2:01:34] was able to be
[2:01:36] seduced no other female in creation can
[2:01:40] be immoral but the human but the human
[2:01:43] female may be touched at almost any time
[2:01:46] and then he says and when and that
[2:01:49] weakness in her allows Satan to seduce
[2:01:52] her by the way of The Serpent and it
[2:01:55] brought the woman to a very peculiar
[2:01:58] position before God and His word are you
[2:02:01] following listen to this now she is the
[2:02:05] type of all things vulgar file loome and
[2:02:09] of of on one hand and then it says and
[2:02:13] on the other hand she is the very type
[2:02:16] of things clean beautiful holy
[2:02:19] and and as the uh receptable of the
[2:02:24] spirit and the blessings of God on one
[2:02:26] hand she can be called a who is
[2:02:29] drunk with the wine of the fornication
[2:02:32] on the other hand you said she's on the
[2:02:35] other side on the other she is called
[2:02:38] the bride of
[2:02:39] Christ on one hand she's called mystery
[2:02:42] babyon the Abomination before God on the
[2:02:45] other hand she's called the New
[2:02:47] Jerusalem mother on on one hand she's
[2:02:51] she's so foul and wicked and lwd and
[2:02:54] she's she's a sumary cast down in the
[2:02:57] Lake of Fire and the only uh only fit
[2:03:01] place for her on the other she is
[2:03:04] exalted to Heaven sharing the very
[2:03:08] Throne of God as the only beiting place
[2:03:12] for such a queen now let and I want you
[2:03:15] to see the the the mystery all the
[2:03:19] unfolding of this as the prophet is
[2:03:20] saying so as you are today if but when
[2:03:24] Satan gets hold of you he
[2:03:43] can hand Satan gets hold of a a woman or
[2:03:48] a church or an individual he can M your
[2:03:51] life and twist it up so much and make
[2:03:54] you nothing and make you a bum but on
[2:03:58] the other side the other person you
[2:04:01] yourself can be cleaned off and become
[2:04:04] the very child of God so when you when
[2:04:08] and that's where the Prophet now is
[2:04:09] bringing this you cannot be in the world
[2:04:12] and in God at the same time so on one
[2:04:14] hand if you're not careful the SAT can
[2:04:17] come and cause all kind of dysfunction
[2:04:20] and and all kinds of sicknesses all
[2:04:22] kinds of chaos but on the other hand you
[2:04:24] could be the very representation of
[2:04:27] Jesus Christ here on
[2:04:29] Earth same person not two same person
[2:04:34] when he caral he could be the P the
[2:04:37] worst person he could be a
[2:04:39] murderer he can commit sin that things
[2:04:42] that a man cannot do that's why pro the
[2:04:45] prophet will say a man without the Holy
[2:04:47] Ghost is nothing but a br
[2:04:49] beast on one hand you you you see the
[2:04:53] the the the catastrophe and the things
[2:04:56] that men can do you wonder how is this
[2:05:01] possible but on the other
[2:05:04] hand she stand there as the true Son of
[2:05:08] God as the very true representation of
[2:05:11] God and the things that you can do no
[2:05:14] one else can do and so the prophet will
[2:05:17] say and he said now there's this
[2:05:20] representation but what is it about you
[2:05:23] that's so different about all of that
[2:05:26] God promise that as this church will be
[2:05:28] this way that God that's why I said but
[2:05:31] I'm called this my Thanksgiving message
[2:05:34] what is Thanksgiving about he's saying
[2:05:36] that there will be an elected lady a
[2:05:39] lady her name will be called Grace I
[2:05:42] about to just sing a song Grace Grace
[2:05:44] Grace what is Grace in other word it's
[2:05:47] God's Own intervention mention about a
[2:05:50] certain group of people he said that as
[2:05:52] the others will go this direction and do
[2:05:54] that I will have a people that are
[2:05:57] called by my name a people that I have
[2:06:00] chosen before the foundation of the
[2:06:02] world a people even though they had a
[2:06:05] certain destination they had to go I
[2:06:07] stepped in and I gave up my own life and
[2:06:10] redeemed
[2:06:12] them he says now he
[2:06:15] says what is Grace he says for it's
[2:06:19] Grace that's by Grace we are
[2:06:22] saved by grace we are
[2:06:25] saved not nothing we can do but what not
[2:06:28] what we can do but it doesn't count to
[2:06:31] us God's grace saved us by Grace we are
[2:06:34] saved through faith it says may I what
[2:06:38] I'm saying this may I add this to this
[2:06:40] woman Grace it says may I place her in
[2:06:43] the Bible it says also I call her
[2:06:47] elected lady
[2:06:49] lady elected lady Miss Grace I'm going
[2:06:53] to talk about it it says the Bible
[2:06:56] declares that to the elect lady that if
[2:06:59] you notice elect comes from the word
[2:07:02] elected lady one among all others was
[2:07:07] elected so when all of this is happened
[2:07:10] when the Natural Woman is doing all the
[2:07:13] the things that she's doing but whatam
[2:07:15] says there is an elected and a spiritual
[2:07:18] lady that is been called to this
[2:07:21] generation she's been taken out of all
[2:07:24] the natural things she's been brought
[2:07:27] into the spiritual she's been divorced
[2:07:29] from a whole husband and being brought
[2:07:32] into the
[2:07:33] new he
[2:07:36] said he speaks about
[2:07:40] Mary she didn't do anything to deserve
[2:07:43] it she wasn't the only virgin there was
[2:07:47] virgin that was in that time
[2:07:49] but what happened Mary was
[2:07:53] chosen God came to
[2:07:56] Mary and the prophet will dramatize at
[2:07:59] one place and speak about how they had
[2:08:02] just gone out and they were listening to
[2:08:04] the word and as they were going back
[2:08:06] home and when it talked about the
[2:08:09] prophecy of Isaiah that a virgin shall
[2:08:11] conceive all that she done was she just
[2:08:15] let the word that the that the priest
[2:08:17] and what was read just go into her mind
[2:08:21] and she was thinking on the word of God
[2:08:23] at all time she just let the word come
[2:08:26] into a mind and all of the sudden it
[2:08:28] began to create an atmosphere all of the
[2:08:31] sudden everything began to change all of
[2:08:33] the sudden an angel
[2:08:37] appear the trouble with us is we can't
[2:08:40] keep the word on our mind we have all
[2:08:43] kinds of things to fill our calendar I
[2:08:45] got to do this I got to do this I got to
[2:08:47] do this I got to do this and there's no
[2:08:49] place for the word to reason in our
[2:08:53] mind oh and it says and also God has
[2:08:57] chosen an elected lady which is his
[2:09:00] bride she's elected and it says I hope
[2:09:03] we are remembering that tonight across
[2:09:06] the world Across the Nation so this lady
[2:09:10] at the end time she was elected by God
[2:09:14] from before the foundation of the world
[2:09:17] and why are so important but what I'm
[2:09:20] say say to the elected one God is
[2:09:23] calling because when this message goes
[2:09:26] out it's not calling just for anybody
[2:09:29] there's an elected person what we read
[2:09:32] at the beginning it says blessed are
[2:09:34] your eyes for they see blessed are your
[2:09:36] ears for they hear so this message is
[2:09:39] given to fall into specific ears of
[2:09:43] people those that will hear and obey it
[2:09:47] others will hear it they will hear it
[2:09:49] they will fight against it they will
[2:09:51] hear it they will deny it but there are
[2:09:54] those that will hear and believe it and
[2:09:57] I'm so glad I'm one of
[2:09:59] [Music]
[2:10:01] them what are you thankful about God
[2:10:04] open my eyes to see the message of the
[2:10:06] hour and if he open my eyes to see it
[2:10:09] he's going to open he's going to bring
[2:10:11] about the transformation that I need in
[2:10:13] order for me to get there Hallelujah
[2:10:16] that's
[2:10:16] right that's right is that what the
[2:10:19] Bible says blessed are you because God
[2:10:21] opened your eyes now if he open it he
[2:10:24] didn't open it just so he can say I open
[2:10:27] your eyes he opened it so you can see it
[2:10:30] so you can be changed by it so you can
[2:10:32] be transformed by
[2:10:35] it it says God the true virtuous Bride
[2:10:39] of the Lord he says the last day the
[2:10:41] church elected Lady of Jesus Christ
[2:10:44] Jesus is the word how many believe that
[2:10:47] the congregation said amen
[2:10:48] all right then it says the bride is
[2:10:50] always part of the bridegroom so the
[2:10:53] bride will not be a denomination it will
[2:10:55] have to be the word manifested to be the
[2:10:58] bride of Christ he promised to do that
[2:11:00] and he said that he did he says uh uh
[2:11:04] never never uses or or loses his pattern
[2:11:07] it says he always did it by the pattern
[2:11:10] he done it every time and he says by the
[2:11:13] pattern he does it
[2:11:16] again calling out the virtuous bride in
[2:11:19] the last day a lovely Rebecca waiting
[2:11:22] for I for her
[2:11:24] heac what a beautiful
[2:11:28] time your natural
[2:11:30] birth or your first birth the prophet
[2:11:33] will call it the only thing it did is
[2:11:36] brought death into your
[2:11:40] life and the prophet will say
[2:11:46] this by your natural
[2:11:51] birth because of the way you were
[2:11:55] born you came and loving the things of
[2:12:00] the
[2:12:01] world with the nature of the world in
[2:12:03] you and all of that
[2:12:06] stuff but he also said
[2:12:09] that the real you or the original
[2:12:14] you was not made to be a liar
[2:12:21] amen because if we were made to be a
[2:12:24] liar and adultery and all those things
[2:12:27] why are we
[2:12:28] here why are we gathering this
[2:12:31] building he says that your natural birth
[2:12:34] or your first
[2:12:35] birth was the representation of what the
[2:12:38] book of life
[2:12:41] was so everything that was born because
[2:12:44] God is the originator of Life your name
[2:12:47] was placed in the The Book of Life and
[2:12:49] the Book of Life was only a record of
[2:12:52] all the things that you had done but he
[2:12:55] said somewhere along the way your name
[2:12:58] was transferred into the Lamb's Book of
[2:13:01] Life and what is the Lamb Book of Life
[2:13:04] he said your lamb Book of Life he says
[2:13:07] well you were separated from the union
[2:13:10] by spiritual death now you are born
[2:13:13] again your new birth you are born again
[2:13:16] and remember married
[2:13:19] again now I want you to understand the
[2:13:22] the little thing that is injecting here
[2:13:25] you are remarried again to the new
[2:13:27] spiritual union of not your spir of not
[2:13:31] the natural life or of the things of the
[2:13:34] world but of the eternal life that germ
[2:13:38] that was in
[2:13:39] you at the beginning found
[2:13:43] you that germ that was in you at the
[2:13:46] beginning found you so yeah the prophet
[2:13:50] he speaks oh if I could just preach it
[2:13:53] oh he comes and he says yeah you are you
[2:13:56] were caught in sin and and all kinds of
[2:13:58] things but then when the message come
[2:14:01] across it says when it comes his
[2:14:03] preaching it says there was a germ of
[2:14:05] life that was to be you in the beginning
[2:14:08] that was laying inside of you so
[2:14:10] therefore it says in fact it says you
[2:14:13] were married you remarried again but is
[2:14:16] saying that before you can actually come
[2:14:18] here it says God took you and he put the
[2:14:21] wedding band of predestination on your
[2:14:24] finger you were actually married before
[2:14:26] you were even
[2:14:30] born help me understand that you were
[2:14:33] actually married before you came here on
[2:14:36] Earth so that's why when Satan got hold
[2:14:39] of you that marriage could not have been
[2:14:41] legal why because you already married
[2:14:44] Hall and when God comes he gives his
[2:14:47] life but about him says he's the only
[2:14:49] one who has power to do this think about
[2:14:52] it when he talks about justification he
[2:14:55] says he though it says you never done it
[2:14:57] in the first place what did God do he
[2:14:59] says only God could do this by taking
[2:15:02] his own blood by dying for your place
[2:15:05] God takes the only thing he doesn't
[2:15:08] forgive it he annihilates the whole
[2:15:12] thing hallu so you were married and
[2:15:16] there's no record to prove it yes you
[2:15:19] can't find it anywhere God throws it in
[2:15:22] the sea of forgetfulness to Never Be
[2:15:25] Remembered anymore I read it I said this
[2:15:27] is crazy that's the gospel we believe
[2:15:31] that's
[2:15:32] rightall I'm like this is Magic I need
[2:15:35] me some of this
[2:15:38] magic I tell you you cannot understand
[2:15:41] this by your human mind this is beyond
[2:15:44] the human mind that God will take you
[2:15:47] you say I'm the one who killed here I'm
[2:15:50] the one who fornicated here I'm the one
[2:15:53] who done this over here he says you were
[2:15:55] deceived into
[2:15:58] it you were deceived into it that was
[2:16:01] not the real you it was because you
[2:16:03] adulterous parent they committed sin
[2:16:06] because you came that way you couldn't
[2:16:08] help yourself so therefore when I come I
[2:16:12] annihilate
[2:16:14] everything it's not just a divorce it's
[2:16:17] an Annihilation it's not that wedding
[2:16:20] never
[2:16:21] existed that's the power of the Living
[2:16:24] God we are serving
[2:16:26] hallu I want to ask you this morning
[2:16:29] what is too hard to that for that God to
[2:16:31] do for
[2:16:32] you what is hard for that God to do for
[2:16:35] you he he his blood is his own bleach
[2:16:39] but whatam says when he takes aor he
[2:16:42] drops it in there the comp every color
[2:16:44] has a composition it's probably B 12 B5
[2:16:48] A6 or whatever but when it goes back in
[2:16:51] there it it dissimulates it goes right
[2:16:54] back into the original
[2:17:00] Adams that's the marriage that you have
[2:17:03] tonight and I want to beg you this
[2:17:05] morning do not be married to the world
[2:17:08] or the things of the world believe the
[2:17:11] Lord Jesus Christ this morning if you
[2:17:13] don't know him as a savior know him as a
[2:17:16] savior this morning if you have doubts
[2:17:18] in your mind Cast Away all your doubt
[2:17:21] believe him only and he will bring that
[2:17:24] he will give you the desires of your
[2:17:27] heart one who's able to come on the
[2:17:29] scene and he comes and the said the
[2:17:32] devil says this one his mind he says it
[2:17:34] cannot be yours because why I chose this
[2:17:37] one before the foundation of the world I
[2:17:40] died for him before he even came I
[2:17:42] married him before he even came you have
[2:17:44] no knowledge of what I did before you
[2:17:47] can even so up before you touch him I
[2:17:49] had already elected
[2:17:54] him the prophet said the first Eve she
[2:17:58] was a byproduct and God knew that the
[2:18:01] devil will get in there and do what he
[2:18:03] did but he said the second Eve she's the
[2:18:06] word and then he says she cannot
[2:18:09] fall why because she is the very word of
[2:18:13] God so if God can fail this eve cannot
[2:18:17] fail why because she's the very word
[2:18:19] manifested in the end
[2:18:21] time what a Thanksgiving message this
[2:18:24] morning let's all stand this morning oh
[2:18:28] God what can be thankful about this
[2:18:31] morning we are so much we have so much

[2:19:28] Thanksgiving hallelujah praise God and

[2:19:42] certificate you married yes how do you
