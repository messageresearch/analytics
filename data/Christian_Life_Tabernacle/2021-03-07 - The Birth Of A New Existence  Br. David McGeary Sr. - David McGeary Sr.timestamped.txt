[22:10] amen welcome everyone in the house of
[22:12] god this morning
[22:13] amen all our visitors are certainly glad
[22:15] to have you with us
[22:16] and man let's invite brother microphone
[22:18] so i'm reading this morning
[22:19] amen god bless you
[22:36] good morning it's good to see everyone
[22:38] here this morning
[22:40] it's getting a little harder to get up
[22:41] here quick because of the people that
[22:43] are here and that's a good thing
[22:45] praise the lord for seeing everyone this
[22:47] morning
[22:48] you know in first samuel chapter 9
[22:51] we read about how the prophet samuel
[22:54] found
[22:55] saul and approached him with the message
[22:58] that he would be king
[22:59] would anoint him to be king you know his
[23:02] response was
[23:03] am i am i not a benjamite of the
[23:06] smallest of the tribes of israel
[23:09] and my family the least of all the
[23:11] families of the tribes of benjamin
[23:14] wherefore then speakest thou to me
[23:18] and what's interesting is it's only four
[23:19] chapters later it's hard to believe
[23:22] that his kingdom is being taken from him
[23:25] because he moved from a place of
[23:26] humility to being to a place that he
[23:28] would have found himself or thought
[23:29] himself greater than god's word
[23:32] and it's then in first samuel 13 that we
[23:35] first hear this statement
[23:38] when the samuel speaking to saul it says
[23:40] but now thy kingdom
[23:41] shall not continue the lord hath sought
[23:44] him
[23:44] a man after his own heart
[23:49] and the lord hath commanded him to be
[23:51] captain over his people
[23:54] and we know the story david was
[23:56] ultimately the one
[23:57] who was identified with the scripture
[23:59] but it was at this moment
[24:01] the very same place where we first hear
[24:03] the testimony that he was a man after
[24:05] god's own heart it's the very same place
[24:08] that david began to be the target of so
[24:11] much attack
[24:14] we're going to read in psalm 7 this
[24:16] morning
[24:18] and there's an interesting footnote at
[24:20] the beginning of
[24:21] the chapter in the king james
[24:26] it says this it's a shigeon of david
[24:28] which he's saying unto the lord
[24:30] concerning the words of cush the
[24:33] benjamite
[24:35] now we don't know exactly what these
[24:38] words were
[24:40] you know scriptures don't reference that
[24:41] but we do know this we know that
[24:44] among the many challenges that david had
[24:46] to deal with was the constant attack of
[24:48] the accuser
[24:51] he was constantly doing battle with
[24:53] accusations that were being leveled
[24:55] against him and he had a complicated
[24:56] relationship among other things with the
[24:58] benjamites see it was saul
[25:01] that had been chosen the people's king
[25:03] out of the smallest tribe the benjamites
[25:05] and they never got over that
[25:06] when the throne was taken from him and
[25:08] given to someone else
[25:10] david was constantly being targeted by
[25:12] accusations that he had usurped the king
[25:15] you know that he had stolen the throne
[25:17] that he didn't have the rightful
[25:19] rulership even though the lord put him
[25:20] there
[25:21] he was constantly facing the attack of
[25:23] the accuser
[25:25] even though the lord had positioned him
[25:27] he had to deal with this
[25:29] accuser you can read about it in the
[25:31] scriptures the story of shimyai you can
[25:34] you know we wonder even if saul's own
[25:35] father was one he was a great man
[25:38] that potentially accused him but
[25:40] regardless it was a daily
[25:42] battle that he had to face and that's
[25:43] one of the one of the struggles that we
[25:46] have
[25:46] on a daily basis is constantly dealing
[25:49] with
[25:50] the accuser having someone there always
[25:53] pointing their finger at us
[25:55] trying to find a fault with either
[25:58] something we did
[26:00] or even something we didn't do
[26:03] but it's interesting how david responds
[26:05] to this in chapter seven
[26:06] whatever this accusation is it's in
[26:09] verse 3
[26:10] he goes before the lord and he says oh
[26:11] lord my god
[26:13] if i have done this if there be iniquity
[26:17] in my hands if i have rewarded evil unto
[26:21] him that was at peace with me
[26:23] and in verse 5 it says then let the
[26:24] enemy persecute my soul and take it
[26:28] i don't know about you but that's not
[26:31] the first thing i pray
[26:33] when i get accused of something but it's
[26:36] a reflection of a man
[26:38] after god's own heart his first response
[26:41] is it me have i done this
[26:45] you know as he said search me and know
[26:47] my heart
[26:48] try me and see if there be any wicked
[26:51] way in me
[26:52] and then the very next thing he does is
[26:55] he commits himself
[26:56] into the hands of the righteous judge
[27:00] in verse 8 the lord shall judge the
[27:02] people
[27:03] judge me oh lord according to my
[27:06] righteousness
[27:07] and according to mine integrity that is
[27:10] in me that was the earmark of this man
[27:12] that was after god's own heart
[27:14] even when he did sin we know the story
[27:16] of him of bathsheba
[27:17] his response was i just commit myself
[27:19] into the hands of the lord
[27:21] and to his mercy that he would do with
[27:23] me as he would
[27:25] the the reaction to accusation the
[27:27] response to the accuser
[27:30] that a man after god's own heart had you
[27:33] know what's interesting
[27:34] is outside of this footnote cush is
[27:37] never mentioned again
[27:39] here he just went before the lord and
[27:41] said if i have done this
[27:43] then let me be persecuted by my enemy by
[27:46] my accuser and yet there's no record
[27:47] that he ever was
[27:49] instead he committed himself into the
[27:51] hands of the lord
[27:53] and the righteous judge did not hold him
[27:57] accountable it's like he never did it in
[27:59] the first place
[28:00] there is no mention of cush anymore
[28:04] he has no mention in scripture as far as
[28:06] the lord's concerned
[28:08] whatever the accusation was he never did
[28:11] it in the first place
[28:12] when he committed himself into the hands
[28:15] of that righteous
[28:16] judge you know and so i was encouraged
[28:19] by that because here's an example of a
[28:20] man after god's own heart
[28:22] and here's the answer to the accuser the
[28:25] accuser that we face
[28:26] every single day him and all of his
[28:29] acolytes that would come to accuse us of
[28:31] things we've done
[28:33] to accuse us of things we haven't done
[28:35] we have the answer if i've done this
[28:38] then i commit myself into the hands of
[28:40] the righteous judge
[28:41] and the end result is cush is never seen
[28:43] again
[28:44] it's as if he never did it in the first
[28:46] place so you know as we read psalm
[28:48] chapter seven together
[28:50] you know it just was encouraged by the
[28:52] fact that we have that example
[28:53] and we have that place of rest where we
[28:56] can
[28:57] respond to the accuser let's read that
[29:00] together psalm chapter 7
[29:02] o lord my god in thee do i put my trust
[29:06] save me from all them that persecute me
[29:08] and deliver me
[29:10] lest he tear my soul like a lion rending
[29:13] it in pieces
[29:14] while there is none to deliver oh lord
[29:17] my god if i have done this
[29:19] if there be iniquity in my hands if i
[29:22] have rewarded
[29:23] evil unto him that was at peace with me
[29:26] yea
[29:26] i have delivered him that without cause
[29:28] is mine enemy
[29:30] let the enemy persecute my soul and take
[29:32] it
[29:33] yea let him tread down my life upon the
[29:36] earth
[29:36] and lay mine honor in the dust selah
[29:39] arise o lord in thine anger lift up
[29:42] thyself
[29:43] because of the rage of mine enemies and
[29:45] awake for me to the judgment that thou
[29:48] hast commanded
[29:49] so shall the congregation of the people
[29:51] come past the above
[29:53] for their sakes therefore return thou on
[29:55] high
[29:56] the lord shall judge the people judge me
[29:59] o lord
[30:00] according to my righteousness and
[30:02] according to mine integrity that is in
[30:04] me
[30:05] oh let the wickedness of the wicked come
[30:07] to an end
[30:08] but establish the trust for the
[30:10] righteous god trieth the darts and
[30:12] reigns
[30:13] my defense is of god which saveth the
[30:16] upright in heart
[30:18] god judgeth the righteous and god is
[30:20] angry with the wicked every
[30:22] day if he turn not he will wet his sword
[30:25] he hath bent his bow and made it ready
[30:28] he hath also prepared for him the
[30:30] instruments of death
[30:31] he ordaineth his arrows against the
[30:33] persecutors
[30:35] behold he travaileth with iniquity and
[30:37] hath conceived mischief
[30:39] and brought forth falsehood he made a
[30:41] pit and digged it
[30:42] and has fallen into the ditch which he
[30:44] had made his mischief shall return upon
[30:47] his own head
[30:48] and his violent dealing shall come down
[30:51] upon his own pace
[30:52] i will praise the lord according to his
[30:54] righteousness
[30:55] and will sing praise to the name of the
[30:58] lord most high
[31:02] amen
[31:07] amen god bless you and have your seats

[42:54] amen are we thankful for that amen
[42:58] he meant brother kyle is a testimony for
[43:00] us this morning
[43:01] and many of you can come at this time
[43:32] lord bless you i just wanted to start
[43:35] with uh
[43:36] reading this short quote here it's from
[43:40] i have heard but now i see brother
[43:42] branham says but first you see your
[43:43] motives and objectives has to be right
[43:46] you have to have reasons for this god
[43:48] don't give you those things just because
[43:49] you ask
[43:50] and you cannot ask in faith unless
[43:52] there's a real objective to that
[43:54] to be in the will of god see if you want
[43:56] to be well what do you want to be well
[43:58] for
[43:59] see if you want to be healed what's the
[44:01] reason you want to be healed what are
[44:02] you telling god
[44:04] what do you want to do with your life
[44:05] when you get healed see there's got to
[44:07] be
[44:08] you've got to have a motive and
[44:09] objective and they have to be right
[44:11] according to the will of god
[44:13] and then when the faith is revealed to
[44:16] you and god by a sovereign grace places
[44:18] that faith in there then it's over um
[44:22] i'll just be brief but a couple weeks
[44:24] ago i started having some swelling
[44:26] and pressure in my right eye
[44:29] just decided to have it checked out the
[44:32] eye doctor said
[44:33] everything was fine but you want a a ct
[44:36] or an mri i was kind of like
[44:38] well what should i do what do you want
[44:40] me to do and he said well let's get a
[44:43] let's get a ct scan and
[44:46] i kind of didn't want to do it but i
[44:49] talked with my wife and we decided to go
[44:51] ahead and do it um
[44:53] got the ct done i got a call the
[44:55] following day and they said
[44:57] um we think it could be one of three
[44:59] things one is
[45:00] kind of like a malformation of a vessel
[45:03] in your brain
[45:04] and it can be kind of dangerous
[45:08] it's something that a lot of times you
[45:10] have to have surgery for to get fixed
[45:14] then another one was more of like a
[45:16] developmental thing that's pretty normal
[45:18] most people
[45:19] have them and or a lot of people have
[45:20] them and don't know that they have it
[45:23] and then the third they said but less
[45:25] likely was you're having an isolated
[45:27] hemorrhage in your brain and that's when
[45:30] it gets real
[45:32] and your flesh starts to take on all the
[45:36] symptoms diagnosis everything that the
[45:38] doctor is trying to throw at you
[45:40] but something inside me was just like
[45:41] you know take god at his word
[45:44] do the things that he says to do so
[45:47] i i had my folks pray for me my wife
[45:50] prayed with me
[45:52] uh i reached out to brother david sister
[45:54] leslie other friends
[45:55] i wore a prayer cloth for a couple days
[45:58] almost full time
[46:00] so i was like i'm going to do my part
[46:02] and the lord will then
[46:04] go do his part and they wanted the mri
[46:08] done pretty quick so
[46:09] when got that done and i got a call on
[46:12] my way home because everything was set
[46:13] up to be urgent because it's
[46:15] your brain and all that kind of stuff so
[46:18] um
[46:19] they called me on the way home and the
[46:21] doctor said um
[46:23] you know it looks like you have kind of
[46:25] like the second one i was telling you
[46:26] about the
[46:28] the pretty normal occurrence where you
[46:30] have just kind of a weird vein in your
[46:32] brain that can cause headaches or
[46:34] something like that
[46:34] and it may have bled at some point but
[46:38] it doesn't seem to be too big of an
[46:40] issue and
[46:41] they want me to see some specialists
[46:43] going forward
[46:45] but it was like even just knowing that
[46:48] was
[46:49] you know off the table with the
[46:51] surgeries and all those different things
[46:53] and and it was like the lord followed
[46:56] through
[46:57] exactly it was i i did my part he did
[47:00] his part
[47:01] and i just i want to thank him for that
[47:04] the healing that he
[47:05] performed i'm looking forward they they
[47:08] scheduled me for appointments but
[47:09] they're
[47:10] a month out so nothing's you know super
[47:12] serious or anything i'm just
[47:14] continuing to trust it it's all going to

[48:17] in our hearts amen

[48:25] but andrew writes please pray for
[48:27] brother juan he wants to be in service
[48:29] today and he's feeling very bad

[48:35] up in prayer this morning
[48:37] amen that the lord will go by his way
[48:39] and just touch him

[48:47] touch and heal you man if you're having
[48:49] it upon your heart

[59:42] morning if it could come at this time
[1:00:01] god bless you church um
[1:00:05] during some trying times in my life i've
[1:00:08] i promised god i said i would always
[1:00:11] talk of this wondrous walks in my life
[1:00:13] no matter how little it is and so that's
[1:00:15] why when i come up here
[1:00:16] you know i like to say what he's done
[1:00:18] for me um because it's been great
[1:00:21] uh sometimes you know i might be very
[1:00:23] critical of myself
[1:00:24] you know take inventory of my life at
[1:00:27] the end of the day
[1:00:28] to say okay uh have i done as expected
[1:00:31] and sometimes you know i do fall short
[1:00:33] and you know i'll say oh i could do
[1:00:35] better
[1:00:36] but by his grace i can't help myself but
[1:00:39] i rely on his grace
[1:00:41] and um it just goes back to i shared his
[1:00:43] testimony with a couple brothers
[1:00:45] in a church during the you know the the
[1:00:48] storm or is it the weather the cold
[1:00:50] weather it was kind of weird for me
[1:00:53] and so uh all of a sudden you know we're
[1:00:56] just moving to a new place
[1:00:58] and um it just completely blocked the
[1:01:00] kitchen
[1:01:01] you know everything just blocked up and
[1:01:03] so you know
[1:01:04] like my instinct i'm like oh my god so
[1:01:06] what can i do you know i started saying
[1:01:08] okay calling the plumbers no one is
[1:01:10] going to answer because
[1:01:11] everybody was booked up and so i was
[1:01:14] expecting the worst you know my instinct
[1:01:16] is
[1:01:16] okay it's just going to blow up and then
[1:01:18] there's going to be water everywhere
[1:01:21] so that was what my brain was thinking
[1:01:23] you know i was getting ready for it i
[1:01:24] was like okay is the insurance gonna
[1:01:26] cover it you know this is gonna be my
[1:01:28] first night
[1:01:29] and um i remember what brother bill
[1:01:32] preached one day and he said you know
[1:01:34] our instinct if your child is sick your
[1:01:36] instinct is you just take them to to
[1:01:38] the doctor you're thinking oh let me
[1:01:39] just get them to the doctor
[1:01:41] what about if we can change that
[1:01:42] instinct to say okay i seek god first
[1:01:45] you know i just go to god and i remember
[1:01:48] that oh
[1:01:48] i almost beat myself up and during the
[1:01:51] family altar i said god i'm so sorry
[1:01:53] i should have brought this to you first
[1:01:55] i know it might just be the most little
[1:01:57] things
[1:01:58] but i just need you to open up this this
[1:02:00] pipe and um

[1:13:15] we just trusted for those that want a
[1:13:18] new spirit
[1:13:21] amen our heavenly father
[1:13:25] lord we're overwhelmed at the wisdom
[1:13:29] of your word father i'm
[1:13:32] moved by what that you've stored in the
[1:13:35] storehouse for
[1:13:36] us father you said you could do nothing
[1:13:40] unless you first revealed it to your
[1:13:42] servants the prophet
[1:13:45] and lord you chose to
[1:13:48] place in a
[1:13:51] a river of wealth and and
[1:13:55] blessings for your church
[1:13:58] you send it in the form of a message
[1:14:00] delivered by the fulfillment
[1:14:03] of malachi 4 5 and luke 17
[1:14:07] 30 and revelations 10 7 the scriptural
[1:14:10] fulfillment of your word
[1:14:13] and you left with your church a message
[1:14:15] that would
[1:14:17] be stored and brought forth to them in
[1:14:20] the hour of need
[1:14:22] and your holy spirit would make it alive
[1:14:26] just like the bible father it's been
[1:14:28] stored up to the prophets and
[1:14:31] the great writers and we can still open
[1:14:34] it today and
[1:14:35] see you living and speaking to our
[1:14:38] hearts
[1:14:39] once again this morning father we need
[1:14:41] you to break the bread of life
[1:14:45] we need you father to make it personal
[1:14:48] to each person according to their
[1:14:50] individual need
[1:14:52] lord we ask that you give them
[1:14:54] enlightenment that they can understand
[1:14:56] the
[1:14:56] great process of how that you've chosen
[1:14:59] to do things
[1:15:01] and that we could become subject to
[1:15:03] these things
[1:15:04] we ask for your great presence this
[1:15:06] morning in your wonderful and beautiful
[1:15:09] name we
[1:15:10] pray amen amen god bless you this
[1:15:13] morning let's go right into the word by
[1:15:15] opening our bibles
[1:15:20] this morning we'll be ministering from
[1:15:22] the message called birth pains
[1:15:25] we're not going to
[1:15:29] really play a portion today but
[1:15:34] we do are trusting that
[1:15:39] uh the word of god will be a blessing to
[1:15:42] you as we
[1:15:43] read uh portions of it so we're gonna
[1:15:46] read in saint john the 16th chapter
[1:15:50] the 19th through the 21st
[1:15:54] verse 19 through the 20th
[1:15:58] first verse this message is the message
[1:16:02] where uh
[1:16:05] if you have your bibles these two
[1:16:08] these two pages of
[1:16:11] the bible were stuck together brother
[1:16:14] branham we got a brand new bible
[1:16:17] and these pages were stuck together
[1:16:20] and so when he went to 16
[1:16:24] and he turned the page he went over
[1:16:28] and it wasn't the same
[1:16:32] verse and this is the
[1:16:36] the message where the catholic priest
[1:16:41] came up and said here read it
[1:16:44] from mine and you know brother branham
[1:16:47] was very gracious and he turned around
[1:16:49] he said thank you brother
[1:16:51] you know and i that's just the love of
[1:16:53] god that spilled out of that
[1:16:56] great prophet's heart but um
[1:17:00] but then you know the lord spoke to him
[1:17:02] why that that was
[1:17:04] but i can't even begin to touch into
[1:17:06] this message how deep it is
[1:17:08] but there's a certain part that i
[1:17:12] wanted for us and i'm not trying to
[1:17:14] re-preach the message to the world
[1:17:17] if you understand that i i'm not looking
[1:17:20] at
[1:17:21] any audience outside of the ones
[1:17:24] that's sitting here and those that are
[1:17:27] part
[1:17:28] of our congregation so
[1:17:31] you know i don't believe this message
[1:17:33] needs any further vindication
[1:17:35] and i'm not capable of vindicating it
[1:17:39] but i am interested in going into what
[1:17:42] that he said
[1:17:43] and bringing it to us our local assembly
[1:17:48] for our needs and so
[1:17:51] i just want you to understand that that
[1:17:54] i can't go
[1:17:55] into the great depths of this because
[1:17:58] it's beyond my ability
[1:18:00] but let's just read here as we read in
[1:18:03] john
[1:18:04] 16 19.
[1:18:08] and jesus knew that they were desirous
[1:18:12] to
[1:18:13] ask him and said unto them
[1:18:17] do ye inquire among yourselves
[1:18:21] of that i said
[1:18:25] a little while and ye shall not see me
[1:18:29] and again a little while
[1:18:32] and ye shall see me
[1:18:36] verily verily i say unto you that ye
[1:18:40] shall weep and lament
[1:18:43] but the world shall rejoice
[1:18:48] and ye shall be sorrowful but your
[1:18:51] sorrow
[1:18:52] shall be turned into joy
[1:18:57] a woman when she is
[1:19:01] in travail hath sorrow
[1:19:05] because her hour is come
[1:19:10] but as soon as she is delivered of
[1:19:13] the child she remembereth no more
[1:19:16] the anguish for joy
[1:19:20] that a man is born into the world
[1:19:24] and ye now therefore have sorrow
[1:19:27] but i will see you again and your heart
[1:19:31] shall rejoice
[1:19:33] and your joy no man taketh
[1:19:36] from you father bless your word in your
[1:19:39] precious name we pray
[1:19:41] amen you may be seated this morning
[1:19:48] if i was to title this message this
[1:19:51] morning
[1:19:53] i would entitle it the birth of a new
[1:19:56] existence
[1:19:58] the birth of a new existence um
[1:20:06] we preached a little bit last week
[1:20:09] i believe from broken cisterns and we
[1:20:13] said that
[1:20:14] the tooth existed sins that man did
[1:20:19] and we talked about that man has a
[1:20:21] natural way
[1:20:22] of doing his own thing
[1:20:26] he hewed for himself out his own
[1:20:29] cisterns
[1:20:30] his his own plan that we call them
[1:20:33] catches
[1:20:34] that's what he said his sister and does
[1:20:37] and when something's man-made it catches
[1:20:39] everything
[1:20:40] and it attracts everything
[1:20:44] stagnant water he said that's not living
[1:20:47] and not flowing attracts lizards and
[1:20:50] frogs and
[1:20:51] wiggle tails and and pollywogs and
[1:20:55] all those things it's a an attraction
[1:20:58] that comes from
[1:21:01] being stagnated and
[1:21:05] still and uh we've we
[1:21:08] find that a lot of times that when we're
[1:21:11] not moving
[1:21:12] forward with god that
[1:21:16] in our lives kind of come into a
[1:21:19] stagnant place that it seems like things
[1:21:22] of the world
[1:21:24] start being attracted
[1:21:27] and i we were fellowshipping on that
[1:21:30] last week so this sermon is to continue
[1:21:33] on to that and add to that because i
[1:21:36] believe our desire
[1:21:37] is to have that living water flowing
[1:21:40] and and to move up to higher ground the
[1:21:44] brother come to me
[1:21:45] and he said now brother that's so true
[1:21:48] what you said i kind of just got
[1:21:50] a little stale at work and just
[1:21:53] kind of gotten the routine and i wasn't
[1:21:56] really on fire for god he said pretty
[1:21:58] soon the baptists were fellowshipping
[1:22:00] with me and
[1:22:01] they came over and were sitting at the
[1:22:02] table with me and eating lunch and
[1:22:05] all of a sudden i was everybody's buddy
[1:22:08] he says but the lord kind of dealt with
[1:22:10] my heart and i was reading a message and
[1:22:12] god dealt with me and i got a revelation
[1:22:15] he said the next time they were there i
[1:22:16] was saying wow look at what's in god's
[1:22:18] word
[1:22:19] isn't it wonderful he said next lunch
[1:22:21] day there was nobody there
[1:22:26] so you you understand
[1:22:29] that there's got to be a desire
[1:22:32] in our heart to move forward with god
[1:22:37] okay don't don't think just because
[1:22:41] that you've been given the revelation
[1:22:44] and the understanding that god sent a
[1:22:47] vindicated message
[1:22:49] that we have a picture of the pillar of
[1:22:52] fire
[1:22:54] that led the children of israel
[1:22:57] that was the same way that god appeared
[1:23:00] in the pillar of fire
[1:23:02] that's what he did he appeared in the
[1:23:03] pillar of fire by day he appeared as a
[1:23:06] cloud
[1:23:07] by night and these two vindications
[1:23:11] of god leading the children of israel
[1:23:14] both of those have been manifested in
[1:23:17] our day
[1:23:21] and but you've still got to go
[1:23:24] forward on the journey
[1:23:27] you know okay in other words they
[1:23:28] couldn't sit in the desert and say we've
[1:23:31] got a pillar of fire we've got a
[1:23:34] cloud they had to continue the the
[1:23:37] travel and the travail to go to
[1:23:41] that promised land that place that they
[1:23:44] want to be
[1:23:46] now we have a lot of promised lands in
[1:23:49] our lives
[1:23:50] places that we we want to be
[1:23:53] i would call it a higher ground
[1:23:57] and so we want to talk about what what
[1:23:59] takes place
[1:24:01] in that journey so each of us can
[1:24:03] understand
[1:24:04] as an individual what uh
[1:24:09] what we're going to what's going to
[1:24:12] trans
[1:24:13] transpire in our lives to move
[1:24:18] from captivity to promise
[1:24:22] and jesus spoke these words
[1:24:26] to the disciples and uh he
[1:24:30] that you know you will have sorrow but
[1:24:33] your sorrow shall be turned to joy
[1:24:35] he spoke that to his disciples because
[1:24:38] he knew
[1:24:39] that the birth of christianity was
[1:24:42] coming into existence
[1:24:45] so we we don't want to look at it
[1:24:48] historically
[1:24:49] as the birth of christianity coming into
[1:24:53] existence
[1:24:54] but we want to look at it as the birth
[1:24:56] of a christian
[1:24:58] coming into existence and
[1:25:01] we all is anybody in here
[1:25:04] want to be a better christian
[1:25:07] oh okay so we you haven't arrived yet
[1:25:13] you know but you know he's arrived
[1:25:17] and he's with you and in you so he's
[1:25:20] going to take you there
[1:25:22] so he was going to take the church so
[1:25:25] he's telling the church and he's laying
[1:25:27] it out
[1:25:28] to the the church knowing that
[1:25:31] the cr the birth of a christian church
[1:25:34] was going to take
[1:25:36] is going to come into existence and
[1:25:38] that's why i call this message the birth
[1:25:41] of a new existence so we're talking
[1:25:44] about what it takes
[1:25:46] and so we know that the natural birth
[1:25:50] and that's what jesus refers to here he
[1:25:52] says a woman when she's in travail
[1:25:55] and in other words there's a suffering
[1:25:58] there's a struggle
[1:26:00] there's a travail to bring forth
[1:26:03] a new life
[1:26:06] and uh so he says he says now
[1:26:09] you're going to have sorrow he says now
[1:26:12] the world will be rejoicing
[1:26:17] you know i mean i you know there can be
[1:26:20] a
[1:26:21] a hundred uh a hundred
[1:26:25] accidents a day out here where somebody
[1:26:28] gets hurt but
[1:26:29] you let a preacher get in an accident
[1:26:32] you know it'll be on the news okay you
[1:26:35] let somebody slip
[1:26:36] or somebody makes an accusation whether
[1:26:40] it's true or not
[1:26:41] it'll make the front page
[1:26:44] you know and that because that's what
[1:26:46] the world does it
[1:26:47] it rejoices and so
[1:26:50] uh he knew that in christianity
[1:26:54] that at the birth of christianity was
[1:26:56] going to be
[1:26:57] a birth it was going to be a sorrowful
[1:27:02] very uh
[1:27:05] a very a struggle for that
[1:27:08] church to be born and he said but don't
[1:27:13] go through the struggle because the joy
[1:27:16] that's going to come cannot be taken
[1:27:19] away from you
[1:27:21] and so i want this this morning to take
[1:27:24] this to
[1:27:24] our personal lives i started reading
[1:27:27] this message i was led to this message i
[1:27:29] thought
[1:27:30] oh lord this is just for me to preach
[1:27:32] and then the more i got into it and the
[1:27:34] more god done it i thought
[1:27:36] man he's talking to me this is where i'm
[1:27:40] at this is what i'm going through and
[1:27:43] then i had a lot of doubts
[1:27:45] about coming here and preaching it
[1:27:48] you know what i mean but i'm we're no
[1:27:50] big
[1:27:51] eyes or little yous so we're just
[1:27:54] all going through something together and
[1:27:57] i've heard the cry of the people i've
[1:27:59] heard the sermons of the brothers i've
[1:28:01] i've heard the desires in their hearts
[1:28:04] and i believe
[1:28:05] everybody here is wanting higher ground
[1:28:08] [Music]
[1:28:09] and so we know that if the natural birth
[1:28:12] is that way the prophet
[1:28:14] of god says he says the natural birth
[1:28:17] types the spiritual bird
[1:28:20] all things of the natural is a type
[1:28:23] of the spiritual all things
[1:28:27] of the natural birth is a type of a
[1:28:30] spiritual birth
[1:28:31] so if you want to have a spiritual birth
[1:28:33] you've got the ability to sit back
[1:28:35] and look and know well what is the type
[1:28:38] of that
[1:28:39] what what transpires and then we can
[1:28:41] understand that those things
[1:28:43] same things will transpire within us
[1:28:47] as an individual so that's what he says
[1:28:50] he
[1:28:50] says that that it
[1:28:54] it it the natural birth type the
[1:28:56] spirituals and all
[1:28:57] things of the natural birth is the type
[1:29:00] of the spiritual birth
[1:29:02] and we find out if we look out here
[1:29:07] on the ground and see a tree and the
[1:29:09] earth growing
[1:29:10] is struggling for life
[1:29:14] you see what he says see look the
[1:29:16] natural they type the same
[1:29:17] so look at it it's struggling for life
[1:29:22] and it and it goes to show that there is
[1:29:26] a tree somewhere
[1:29:27] that doesn't die because it's crying out
[1:29:31] for something so that's what we realize
[1:29:34] is that if we
[1:29:36] if if the spiritual birth now we get to
[1:29:39] the idea there's one spiritual birth
[1:29:43] if there's one spiritual birth you're
[1:29:45] one year old
[1:29:49] you understand it's it's a birth
[1:29:54] we're we're talking this morning about
[1:29:56] our
[1:29:57] our desire to to go up
[1:30:00] and to uh to go up
[1:30:03] to higher ground and and it goes to show
[1:30:07] that there's something
[1:30:08] crying out so if you you
[1:30:11] find out that there's something in your
[1:30:14] heart
[1:30:15] crying out in other words you know
[1:30:18] you're stagnant
[1:30:21] you know there's frogs and lizards in
[1:30:23] your life
[1:30:25] or you just realize that day after day
[1:30:28] you're you're you're in the same place
[1:30:32] and so uh it you you uh
[1:30:35] you understand that there's something
[1:30:37] within you
[1:30:38] that's crying out now in a natural birth
[1:30:43] uh in a natural birth when
[1:30:48] a a baby is uh uh born
[1:30:52] can and uh it's going through its
[1:30:54] struggles
[1:30:55] and it's it's trials we find out
[1:30:59] in that birth that sometimes that baby
[1:31:02] needs a
[1:31:03] a little spanking or a little shake
[1:31:08] something to shock it and sometimes the
[1:31:11] birth itself
[1:31:13] will cause the the shocking
[1:31:17] or or the shaking act and so
[1:31:20] you're looking at yourselves today and
[1:31:24] it's so it's not the birth
[1:31:26] of christianity as a whole but it's the
[1:31:29] birth of
[1:31:30] christianity in me
[1:31:34] you understand that i'm the one that's
[1:31:37] trying to go to higher ground
[1:31:40] i'm the one that god is trying to
[1:31:43] form into the image of his son
[1:31:47] and and sometimes the potter's got to
[1:31:50] take the clay and completely
[1:31:52] break it down to remold it again the way
[1:31:56] that he can use it so i i we look at
[1:31:59] ourselves here
[1:32:01] and we we understand that we're not
[1:32:04] looking at something outside of
[1:32:06] ourselves
[1:32:07] what we want to be is examine and
[1:32:09] understand
[1:32:10] the process that god uses
[1:32:17] and to realize that that's his choice
[1:32:22] and so he says that sometimes it takes a
[1:32:25] uh
[1:32:27] something to shock it
[1:32:30] you know what i mean to shake it
[1:32:33] in order for it to catch that
[1:32:36] breath of life now we just said the
[1:32:39] natural
[1:32:40] is a perfect type of the spiritual the
[1:32:43] things that takes place
[1:32:44] in the natural birth takes place in the
[1:32:47] spiritual birth as well
[1:32:50] so when somebody is going to to get
[1:32:54] moved from one place to another place
[1:32:58] be ready for a little a shock in your
[1:33:00] life
[1:33:03] something all of a sudden you realize
[1:33:05] what you've done
[1:33:07] or you realize where you're at it's like
[1:33:11] your light comes on you says my goodness
[1:33:13] i'm in a trash can
[1:33:18] or i'm in a stagnant pond i'm dwelling
[1:33:21] with frogs and with lizards and with
[1:33:23] horny toads and all kinds of things like
[1:33:26] that
[1:33:27] nothing against the horny toads you know
[1:33:30] i love them but uh
[1:33:34] it just uh it it's just a realization
[1:33:39] do you understand so if you're in a
[1:33:42] place in your life
[1:33:44] then be ready for a shock from god amen
[1:33:49] you know ask god for the shock
[1:33:53] but that what it takes so we understand
[1:33:56] in this birth that that if god
[1:33:59] laid this plan down then there's no way
[1:34:03] that it's going to go
[1:34:05] outside of god's plan without being
[1:34:08] hybrid in other words without being a
[1:34:12] man-made
[1:34:13] system that all the water leaks out
[1:34:17] but he said if if you that that sorrow
[1:34:21] is turned to joy that is a joy that no
[1:34:24] man can take from you
[1:34:26] and if the living well springs up within
[1:34:29] you
[1:34:29] that's not a well that no man can stop
[1:34:32] up
[1:34:34] it becomes real and it becomes living
[1:34:37] amen and so we
[1:34:40] read that as we kind of go into this
[1:34:43] understanding
[1:34:44] of this morning it says
[1:34:48] he says i think a baby is born
[1:34:52] by stillbirth with no sound no emotion
[1:34:55] that's a dead baby
[1:34:59] okay and it says that's what's the
[1:35:01] matter
[1:35:02] with the church today the system
[1:35:06] we've got too many stillborn children
[1:35:09] that's right folks
[1:35:13] we don't want to be stillborn
[1:35:17] you understand we want to have some
[1:35:19] passion
[1:35:20] about what we believe we want to have
[1:35:23] some emotion
[1:35:24] about what we feel we want to have a
[1:35:27] sense of life
[1:35:29] if i could say this essential possession
[1:35:32] you want to know what you possess it's
[1:35:34] like a man that looks in the field
[1:35:36] and finds a great treasure
[1:35:42] you know he's uh he's
[1:35:46] he's found something of great worth and
[1:35:49] uh
[1:35:51] so i don't know what that was but i'll
[1:35:52] tell you brothers when i want you to
[1:35:54] post something
[1:35:55] thank you it says it says that's what's
[1:35:58] the matter with the church today the
[1:36:00] system
[1:36:00] we've got too many stillborn children
[1:36:02] that's right they need
[1:36:04] a gospel spanking
[1:36:11] you see and and so to wake them
[1:36:15] up to bring themselves
[1:36:18] so that god can breathe
[1:36:21] the breath of life into them
[1:36:25] now we find that's so
[1:36:28] true it's crude theology
[1:36:31] but it's the truth anyhow so
[1:36:34] that's what god chose is the foolishness
[1:36:36] of preaching so
[1:36:38] he says what it takes in our life
[1:36:40] sometimes is to
[1:36:42] to bring forth a life to put a breath of
[1:36:44] life in you
[1:36:45] well when you're stagnant you're laying
[1:36:47] in the same condition
[1:36:49] and you're in that day in and day out
[1:36:52] and everything what do we even call that
[1:36:54] in the natural world
[1:36:56] it needs a breath of life what do we
[1:36:58] call it a breath of fresh air
[1:37:03] it needs some freshness to it
[1:37:06] it needs some zeal back into it it's
[1:37:09] restore unto me the joy
[1:37:12] of my salvation cast me not away
[1:37:15] don't take your spirit from me that's
[1:37:19] that crying out
[1:37:22] because you cry out because
[1:37:27] you know that there's another life
[1:37:31] there's a better life there's something
[1:37:34] missing
[1:37:36] and you're hungering for it then you're
[1:37:38] thirsty
[1:37:39] and you desire it in your heart so if
[1:37:42] you're there
[1:37:43] then it's a good it becomes a time
[1:37:46] where you need to understand what the
[1:37:49] process is
[1:37:50] of getting from a to b
[1:37:56] and it takes a it takes a
[1:38:01] a gospel spanking it takes a shock
[1:38:04] in other words not just something carnal
[1:38:11] okay but it takes something spiritual
[1:38:15] to strike you
[1:38:19] the spirit something in the spirit world
[1:38:21] something in the spirit realm
[1:38:24] because something that's not natural
[1:38:27] but supernatural so if you're going to
[1:38:30] be moved to the supernatural
[1:38:32] it's got to be something supernatural
[1:38:35] that shocks you
[1:38:36] and moves you no man cometh unto me
[1:38:40] except the father draws him
[1:38:43] so he's saying that that in order to to
[1:38:46] have this great
[1:38:48] uh a great uh
[1:38:52] revival within your life a great
[1:38:56] a drink from the fountain something that
[1:38:59] brings
[1:39:00] brings the breath of life into them
[1:39:04] it's going to take something
[1:39:05] supernatural
[1:39:07] to shock them
[1:39:11] okay so which one so notice
[1:39:14] in a seed's birth
[1:39:19] now i i don't really need to
[1:39:23] and want to know a whole lot
[1:39:27] about a sunflower seed
[1:39:32] but i have a seed
[1:39:36] okay so he's not talking about a
[1:39:40] sunflower seed
[1:39:43] s-u-n he's talking about an s-o-n-c
[1:39:49] so when we talk about us and what's one
[1:39:52] of the things that we always
[1:39:54] say we have the seed of god in us we're
[1:39:56] the seed of god
[1:39:58] god planted a seed in me there's a
[1:40:02] we have a seed before the foundation of
[1:40:05] the world god knew we'd be here and he
[1:40:07] put a seed in us
[1:40:09] so now he's saying in a seeds
[1:40:12] isn't that in a seed's
[1:40:16] birth so now i
[1:40:20] what seed am i interested what seed am i
[1:40:24] interested in coming to life it's the
[1:40:27] seed
[1:40:28] that's in me the seed's birth that's my
[1:40:32] seed's verse
[1:40:35] not just a seed's birth but it's
[1:40:38] my seed's birth in a seed's birth
[1:40:41] in my seed's birth it says
[1:40:44] the old seed must die
[1:40:48] before the new one can
[1:40:51] be born
[1:40:54] amen now we're gonna go now let's don't
[1:40:58] take this keep taking this back to the
[1:41:02] sinner
[1:41:04] this is beyond salvation
[1:41:10] this is this is on our
[1:41:13] life's journey so we're not just going
[1:41:16] back
[1:41:17] and talking about the process of coming
[1:41:20] from being in the world to being a
[1:41:22] christian we're not talking about the
[1:41:25] process of
[1:41:26] being a non-believer of the word of god
[1:41:30] for the hour to becoming a believer
[1:41:32] in the message that god sent you this is
[1:41:35] talking about what we go through
[1:41:37] personally
[1:41:40] he said you notice in a seed birth the
[1:41:43] old must die
[1:41:45] so before look the old seed must die
[1:41:50] before the new one can
[1:41:54] be born so therefore
[1:41:58] death is hard any time
[1:42:01] death is hard any time so
[1:42:05] not just one time any time
[1:42:09] or many times death is hard
[1:42:13] so it's painful it's distressful
[1:42:18] birth is the same because you're
[1:42:21] bringing life
[1:42:22] into the world and it's painful
[1:42:26] so there there's a a struggle
[1:42:30] there's a birth and so that's
[1:42:33] that's what he's telling us here that
[1:42:36] there's going to be
[1:42:37] a birth and a birth has a process
[1:42:41] if it's the way that it is he says and
[1:42:44] it's painful
[1:42:45] jesus said that this word was a seed
[1:42:49] that the sower went forth and sold
[1:42:52] now we're all acquainted with that and
[1:42:55] what i want to teach
[1:42:56] this this like a sunday school lesson
[1:43:00] because it's sunday
[1:43:01] notice then this word being a seed
[1:43:06] but remember the seed is only brings
[1:43:09] forth
[1:43:10] a new life when it dies in other words
[1:43:13] it's
[1:43:13] only going to bring forth a new life
[1:43:17] when it goes through the pains of
[1:43:20] birth it's not going to bring forth a
[1:43:24] new life without the struggle
[1:43:28] without the distress without the pain
[1:43:31] the baby
[1:43:32] is not going to come from the womb
[1:43:36] or the place that it is
[1:43:40] into a new breath of life
[1:43:43] without a travail
[1:43:47] without a process and now many
[1:43:50] times we're in that process and we don't
[1:43:53] even realize it
[1:43:57] we don't have an understanding of what's
[1:43:59] taking place
[1:44:01] within our our own selves he says
[1:44:06] he says so we
[1:44:10] we uh we look at this and we
[1:44:14] we begin to see that it's got it's got
[1:44:16] to die it's got to go through
[1:44:18] the pain and so he says now notice
[1:44:22] that now we notice
[1:44:25] that it's always my thought now to you
[1:44:29] it takes pain distress
[1:44:33] discomfort look at how the pharisees
[1:44:37] died to that law through pain distress
[1:44:41] discomfort but it must
[1:44:44] be it must
[1:44:48] be so look at when you want to go to
[1:44:51] higher ground
[1:44:54] and you want to go to a higher place
[1:44:56] you've got to come out of the place or
[1:44:59] the condition you're
[1:45:01] in and it takes a struggle
[1:45:06] a a fight a pain a birth
[1:45:10] from the old to the new
[1:45:13] so you can be just i'm not so we're not
[1:45:16] talking about people that
[1:45:17] aren't christians we're not talking
[1:45:19] about people that aren't doing right
[1:45:21] but this morning what we're saying is if
[1:45:24] you
[1:45:24] find that you are in a place in your
[1:45:28] life
[1:45:31] because god you have a sense
[1:45:34] of being shocked by the spirit whether
[1:45:37] it's prophecies coming to pass
[1:45:39] that you see the messenger talking about
[1:45:41] the purple dress and
[1:45:43] and you see it right before your eyes
[1:45:45] you
[1:45:46] see the quote about masks and people
[1:45:49] hiding
[1:45:49] you see these things before your eye
[1:45:52] it's a shock
[1:45:57] it it's supposed to uh
[1:46:00] create the desire for
[1:46:03] a breath of fresh air and life to come
[1:46:07] into you
[1:46:10] but he doesn't want you to be ignorant
[1:46:16] of the fact that that's going to take
[1:46:19] pain and distress and struggle
[1:46:26] so even to move from one spiritual
[1:46:29] condition
[1:46:30] to another spiritual condition
[1:46:34] is going to take a birth
[1:46:38] it's not an easy thing
[1:46:42] to go from one place in your life
[1:46:45] to another place when god wants to
[1:46:49] change your life
[1:46:52] he wants to change the way that you are
[1:46:57] and so we we see that that that's
[1:47:02] it that's the way it must be
[1:47:06] okay and there's a reason why that is
[1:47:09] and if we
[1:47:10] just follow with me this morning
[1:47:14] he says
[1:47:17] now we find that rain which brings forth
[1:47:20] fruit
[1:47:22] upon the earth is born
[1:47:25] as the poet said in the fields of
[1:47:28] thunder
[1:47:29] in ragged jagged skies but if we didn't
[1:47:33] have
[1:47:34] the thunder and the ragged jagged skies
[1:47:38] the little distilled drop of rain
[1:47:41] that's been lifted from the sea and
[1:47:44] distilled from the salt
[1:47:47] it would not be
[1:47:50] born now listen what he keeps saying
[1:47:53] he says that that's what happens you're
[1:47:55] being lifted if i could say that
[1:47:58] from whatever sea you're in
[1:48:01] you're going to have to go through the
[1:48:03] jagged thunders of the sky
[1:48:05] to be distilled
[1:48:10] to take this the salt
[1:48:13] out of you act as a type
[1:48:18] you know the process takes things out of
[1:48:21] you
[1:48:23] it causes a change he's saying here as a
[1:48:26] type as an understanding
[1:48:28] it's it's drawn now we'll get to this
[1:48:31] part of it but it's drawn by the sun
[1:48:33] it's put through the process of the
[1:48:36] jagged thunder skies
[1:48:38] and then it's dropped off as a soft
[1:48:41] petal of rain
[1:48:46] it in it it brings forth the soft
[1:48:51] petal drops of water it takes pain
[1:48:55] to bring forth birth
[1:48:59] it takes dying and as the cloud dies
[1:49:05] rain is born
[1:49:08] have you ever seen those dark clouds the
[1:49:11] rain all pours out of it and all of a
[1:49:13] sudden they're not dark no more
[1:49:15] because the cloud had to die
[1:49:19] but it had to go through the thunder the
[1:49:21] jagged the struggles the
[1:49:23] the discomforts of it to go from
[1:49:27] from the one place to the other he says
[1:49:30] in the cloud he says they bring forth
[1:49:34] he says and as the cloud die
[1:49:38] the rain is born because rain is
[1:49:41] part of the cloud
[1:49:45] so you understand that it's part of the
[1:49:47] birth
[1:49:50] it's part of coming from the thunder
[1:49:53] dark spot you're
[1:49:54] in now it might not be dark to the world
[1:49:59] but it's dark to you
[1:50:02] just where you are in your life as an
[1:50:05] everyday christian
[1:50:06] you've been doing good all your life
[1:50:08] you've been keeping the word you've been
[1:50:09] going
[1:50:10] to church you've been paying your tithes
[1:50:12] you've been visiting the sick you've
[1:50:13] been doing everything
[1:50:14] that is on the books but all of a sudden
[1:50:17] that life becomes
[1:50:18] dark to you
[1:50:25] and it's supposed to
[1:50:34] we're not campers
[1:50:38] we're going beyond the camp
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:44] this world is not our home we're just
[1:50:47] traveling through amen we're looking for
[1:50:51] a
[1:50:52] a city we're looking for a kingdom whose
[1:50:55] maker
[1:50:56] is god it's not made by hand
[1:51:00] and so he says he says and one has to
[1:51:04] cease
[1:51:05] so the other one can exist
[1:51:11] one's got to cease no matter how good it
[1:51:15] is
[1:51:16] right no matter how
[1:51:23] comfortable it seems
[1:51:26] god makes it dark
[1:51:29] because he's wanting you to move
[1:51:36] may i say it like this
[1:51:39] he has a place he's going to meet you
[1:51:42] and it ain't where you're at
[1:51:49] all right so he's got a process
[1:51:57] to get you there
[1:52:00] and so you've got this desire to to
[1:52:04] have higher higher ground so you've got
[1:52:06] to come
[1:52:07] out of the place you are
[1:52:10] the condition you're in uh
[1:52:14] the the state of mind you're in so it
[1:52:17] takes a struggle
[1:52:19] and and a fight
[1:52:22] a pain a birth from the old to the new
[1:52:27] because one has to
[1:52:31] cease for the other to exist
[1:52:38] so you might like everything about your
[1:52:40] life
[1:52:43] but when that becomes dark and god's
[1:52:45] trying to move you
[1:52:46] on this it's got to
[1:52:50] cease in order for the new to exist
[1:52:55] and and to get to that place is going to
[1:52:58] be a struggle
[1:53:00] full of distress full full of
[1:53:05] pain and a
[1:53:08] wonderment
[1:53:11] and battle in your mind
[1:53:14] so you you just get there and and that's
[1:53:17] what he is and he's
[1:53:18] he's he's talking here he says he
[1:53:22] jesus says consider the lily
[1:53:25] brother ben brought us to the part about
[1:53:28] the pond lily
[1:53:31] and and and he uses this many times
[1:53:35] but i thought it was again i'd like just
[1:53:38] to
[1:53:39] say it's fork
[1:53:42] you know about the pond lily now we know
[1:53:45] the
[1:53:46] pond lily is down in
[1:53:49] the seed of that lies down in
[1:53:52] the bottom of the muck
[1:53:58] we're not using it this morning for
[1:54:00] those that are in the muck
[1:54:02] right okay we're talking this morning
[1:54:06] about
[1:54:07] us when god wants to move us
[1:54:14] to higher ground
[1:54:18] and and we realized when
[1:54:22] he wants to move us that
[1:54:26] many times he makes where we
[1:54:29] are very uncomfortable
[1:54:34] i'm not talking about going getting a
[1:54:36] new mattress topper
[1:54:42] that's right i'm talking about you get
[1:54:44] spiritually
[1:54:45] uncomfortable you run to your bank
[1:54:48] account and there's plenty of money
[1:54:50] there
[1:54:51] you'll go ask your boss is there still
[1:54:54] work here
[1:54:55] you know pretty soon
[1:54:58] you you can't even find comfort
[1:55:02] in the carnal security that you're built
[1:55:05] in
[1:55:08] my car starts my tires have got tread
[1:55:13] my radio works i probably should take it
[1:55:16] out
[1:55:18] all these things are there
[1:55:23] but yet there's a seed
[1:55:29] that wanting to birth
[1:55:35] and that was where so many people have
[1:55:38] failed
[1:55:39] and the prophet they got stillborn
[1:55:42] and they queued for themselves out of
[1:55:46] cistern and it got stagnant
[1:55:50] amen because they were comfortable
[1:55:54] without the water flowing but
[1:55:57] if you're of his yes
[1:56:01] you understand now he's drawing you
[1:56:06] to a place
[1:56:09] or a condition of rapture
[1:56:17] in order to do that
[1:56:20] he's got to take you
[1:56:23] from where you are
[1:56:27] to a new life
[1:56:31] and he said this that this was given to
[1:56:34] the church
[1:56:35] because he knew christianity was going
[1:56:38] to come into birth
[1:56:40] now i could go right now through all the
[1:56:41] seven church ages to the four horse
[1:56:44] riders
[1:56:44] and everything that the church went to
[1:56:46] to come to where we are today
[1:56:51] so now we see that that so we understand
[1:56:55] that he is the great s-o-n
[1:57:01] and he's drawing you
[1:57:05] no matter where you are if you're in
[1:57:08] high school
[1:57:09] if you're in college if you're an old
[1:57:12] man like i
[1:57:13] am you know you i would have thought
[1:57:17] that after all this time god i've
[1:57:19] arrived
[1:57:22] i can lay down and i can
[1:57:26] i've labored 50 years 45 years here
[1:57:30] and now it's time to coast
[1:57:37] god don't got no coast
[1:57:40] god don't got no neutral god don't got
[1:57:44] no reverse
[1:57:51] he ain't got that stuff
[1:57:54] and if if you sit down
[1:57:58] and you become stale and you become
[1:58:01] stagnant
[1:58:02] the gospel is going to come along and
[1:58:05] shock you
[1:58:06] and god is going to draw you from that
[1:58:09] condition
[1:58:10] and you are going to go through the
[1:58:13] birth
[1:58:14] pain process
[1:58:21] he said
[1:58:25] he said this little pond lily look at
[1:58:29] where it comes out
[1:58:31] dirt muck mud muddy water
[1:58:34] dirty water it pressed its wake
[1:58:37] through all of that
[1:58:40] this little germ of life
[1:58:44] now what did he call it the seed's birth
[1:58:49] and what are we saying the birth of a
[1:58:52] new
[1:58:53] existence so this pond lilies down in
[1:58:57] the muck
[1:58:59] and that's what i'm trying to tell you
[1:59:00] this morning sometimes
[1:59:02] the very place you are becomes muck
[1:59:11] and you can't keep looking back at old
[1:59:14] experiences
[1:59:18] that's how people make up
[1:59:22] evidences
[1:59:26] you know you can't look at a corpse and
[1:59:27] say it once lived
[1:59:29] at once talked at once breathed no
[1:59:32] you've got to realize that the
[1:59:34] life has passed out of it and if we
[1:59:37] become spiritual corpse
[1:59:39] then we need a breath of life a breath
[1:59:42] of new life
[1:59:43] and a breath of new life takes a birth
[1:59:45] and the birth is a process
[1:59:47] it's a struggle it's a pain it's
[1:59:50] something you go through
[1:59:55] because little german life working
[1:59:58] itself
[1:59:59] from the bottom of the pond where the
[2:00:02] frogs and things are at
[2:00:04] and then brings itself up through all of
[2:00:07] that
[2:00:09] it brings itself up so if you understand
[2:00:12] when god's starting to move
[2:00:13] on you all of a sudden your life
[2:00:17] starts to become a struggle
[2:00:21] you're dismayed
[2:00:25] you're distressed you're perplexed
[2:00:30] what's wrong i should be the most happy
[2:00:34] person
[2:00:35] in the world why do i feel this way
[2:00:43] can you find out something's taking
[2:00:45] place
[2:00:46] there's a birth taking place
[2:00:49] there's something happening it's
[2:00:53] there it's time to move
[2:00:57] you start crying out if you start
[2:01:00] wondering what's going on why am i going
[2:01:02] through this
[2:01:03] okay i you know look at and you you go
[2:01:05] back over your theology
[2:01:09] i believe the message of the hour i
[2:01:11] believe the pillar of fire i believe the
[2:01:13] seals are open
[2:01:14] i believe in the church ages you talk to
[2:01:17] people you say i'm the seed of god and
[2:01:20] and you talked about it and you talked
[2:01:22] about all the revelations and we
[2:01:24] pat one another on the back and say
[2:01:26] you're okay i'm okay but the reality of
[2:01:29] it is
[2:01:29] you are in a birth
[2:01:36] and the sooner you realize it
[2:01:41] the quicker that it takes place
[2:01:45] that's right amen
[2:01:48] so from the bottom the frogs
[2:01:52] and brings forth through all that but
[2:01:54] when it gets
[2:01:55] into the presence of the sun
[2:01:59] it's born now listen close
[2:02:03] the little seed burst open into life
[2:02:07] it cannot do that
[2:02:10] until it goes through all the processes
[2:02:18] now remember what a man-made cistern is
[2:02:22] you get all you get in this place where
[2:02:25] god's trying to
[2:02:26] bring you up
[2:02:30] to higher grounds in a higher place
[2:02:33] and if you don't go through the process
[2:02:36] you go hue for yourself
[2:02:40] a cistern a catch
[2:02:43] you come up with an answer i've seen it
[2:02:46] all my life
[2:02:49] i've seen people get this comfortable
[2:02:51] they get
[2:02:52] distressed that they're going through i
[2:02:54] know that god's trying to
[2:02:56] find a birth form i know that god's
[2:02:59] trying to
[2:03:00] to do something in their lives i'm not a
[2:03:02] prophet i don't know what it is
[2:03:05] but i've been around a christian enough
[2:03:08] to recognize the hand of god on
[2:03:10] somebody's life
[2:03:12] and it's in that time that i see people
[2:03:15] make the worst
[2:03:16] decisions for their life that they could
[2:03:19] ever make
[2:03:26] they break the process
[2:03:32] they heal for themselves their own catch
[2:03:36] their own answer because they don't want
[2:03:40] to complete
[2:03:41] the pain the struggle
[2:03:45] the distress they don't want to go
[2:03:47] through it
[2:03:49] they find a better pastor a better
[2:03:51] church a better job
[2:03:53] a better this a better that but all
[2:03:55] they've done is delay the delivery
[2:04:03] because they'll find the same place the
[2:04:05] same problem
[2:04:08] that's one good thing i love about the
[2:04:10] lord if you fail
[2:04:11] he'll give you another chance
[2:04:16] you will find yourself right back
[2:04:19] at the same birth
[2:04:24] until you go through the process and are
[2:04:27] born
[2:04:31] and i'm not talking about the new birth
[2:04:35] i'm talking about the next step in a
[2:04:38] christian life
[2:04:44] a child doesn't get from one step to the
[2:04:47] next step without struggling
[2:04:51] right i love watching a baby go up
[2:04:54] and then i like i love watching them
[2:04:56] figure out how to get down
[2:05:02] because that's part of the birth growth
[2:05:06] with struggle
[2:05:12] now let's just read
[2:05:16] he says until it goes through the
[2:05:18] process
[2:05:19] it's got to come through that
[2:05:24] that's what makes it
[2:05:30] you understand that do you you want to
[2:05:33] be a better christian
[2:05:35] you want to be more read your bible you
[2:05:38] want to pray more
[2:05:40] you want to listen to more tapes you've
[2:05:42] got all these
[2:05:43] wonderful ideas
[2:05:48] okay but the very fact that you want
[2:05:50] those things ought to tell you you're in
[2:05:52] the muck
[2:05:56] and when you're there and you're doing
[2:05:58] all those things
[2:05:59] and they're not satisfying you then
[2:06:02] you've got to understand that there's
[2:06:04] something that's drawing you to higher
[2:06:06] ground
[2:06:08] and you're going to have to go through
[2:06:11] the process
[2:06:13] and understand the process we'll talk
[2:06:15] about it just here in a second
[2:06:17] he says that's what makes it
[2:06:23] it's because that the sun itself
[2:06:26] is what's drawing it and when it gets
[2:06:30] fully above
[2:06:31] all the dirty water and muck and so
[2:06:34] forth
[2:06:35] then it's so happy it just gives out its
[2:06:38] life
[2:06:38] out freely and if it's a beautiful life
[2:06:42] when it gets into the presence of that
[2:06:45] which
[2:06:45] is drawing it up
[2:06:48] so understand that so you're in a place
[2:06:51] and now
[2:06:52] the sun s-o-n is trying to draw you up
[2:06:59] but in order to get there you're going
[2:07:00] to have to go through the struggle
[2:07:03] of going through the water that you're
[2:07:05] in
[2:07:06] the state of mind that you're in
[2:07:10] and everything that you're in you're
[2:07:13] going to have to go through all those
[2:07:15] things
[2:07:18] so all of a sudden you find yourself in
[2:07:19] a mental battle
[2:07:22] what's wrong with where i'm at what's
[2:07:24] wrong with what i'm doing
[2:07:26] why ain't i happy
[2:07:30] why have i been just like i am for so
[2:07:32] many years you got a gospel shot
[2:07:35] and now you want to go up because he's
[2:07:37] the one that's drawing you
[2:07:41] but he can't draw you
[2:07:44] through anything but birth pains
[2:07:52] you can't bypass that
[2:07:56] he's got to draw you through that you
[2:07:59] ever like
[2:07:59] where all of a sudden you're going out
[2:08:01] there one good sign of going through
[2:08:02] birth pains
[2:08:03] is you find fault in everybody
[2:08:09] everybody that made you happy don't make
[2:08:11] you happy no more
[2:08:14] you get a 20 hour raise and you hate
[2:08:17] your job
[2:08:21] you're dissatisfied you're not
[2:08:24] dissatisfied by yourself
[2:08:27] god's doing that to you because he wants
[2:08:31] to bring you through the birth veins
[2:08:33] because that's what makes you
[2:08:37] and that going through the birth pain
[2:08:40] is what brings the joy
[2:08:44] then you forget what you've been through
[2:08:46] you forget the travail
[2:08:48] all of a sudden you have a new peace you
[2:08:50] have a new joy
[2:08:52] you have a new understanding and you're
[2:08:54] hallelujah
[2:08:55] and the beautiful thing about that is is
[2:08:58] that joy cannot be
[2:09:00] taken from you
[2:09:07] but you can't fall apart
[2:09:10] when you're going through the pain the
[2:09:13] birth
[2:09:15] and there's not just one birth in
[2:09:17] christianity
[2:09:20] it's a birth of faith
[2:09:24] the birth of revelation
[2:09:29] he says that's what makes it what it is
[2:09:33] he says i think that's a beautiful type
[2:09:37] of christian life
[2:09:42] oh that tells me a lot when he's going
[2:09:46] through this he says this is a christian
[2:09:48] life
[2:09:49] this is the christian life
[2:09:53] that's what transpires in a christian
[2:09:55] life
[2:09:56] the son drawing us from one place to the
[2:10:01] other
[2:10:03] and we've got to go through the birth
[2:10:06] struggle
[2:10:08] mentally spiritually
[2:10:11] the pressures of life all those things
[2:10:14] are happening on us
[2:10:16] and we're going through all these things
[2:10:18] and we don't know why it is sometimes
[2:10:21] it may not even because it doesn't mean
[2:10:23] there's some belief in your life
[2:10:25] it doesn't mean there's sin in your life
[2:10:27] it just means that this
[2:10:29] great son is
[2:10:32] drawing you to a resurrection into a
[2:10:36] rapture
[2:10:40] i think it's a beautiful type of
[2:10:42] christian life
[2:10:43] when something is drawing you out of the
[2:10:46] world
[2:10:47] until one day you're born right into
[2:10:50] its presence by the holy spirit how
[2:10:53] beautiful
[2:10:54] if you try to help it you'll kill it
[2:11:02] if you try to take a drug if you try to
[2:11:06] take a song if you try to build a catch
[2:11:09] if you try to run to
[2:11:12] a place of comfort and peace
[2:11:16] you're running from the presence of the
[2:11:18] lord
[2:11:22] i don't want to sit there and say lord i
[2:11:23] don't want to go through birth pain
[2:11:27] i'm not mentally strong enough as it is
[2:11:32] you know i want to have some say in the
[2:11:34] matter
[2:11:37] i'll take care of this discomfort no you
[2:11:39] won't
[2:11:41] i've watched myself put it off for a
[2:11:44] month or two
[2:11:45] i got just the answer it's a vacation
[2:11:49] fly off someplace look at as much stuff
[2:11:52] as i can keep as busy as i can land at
[2:11:55] the airport and step
[2:11:57] out and grab my bag and it's all over me
[2:11:59] again
[2:12:02] vacations don't do it
[2:12:06] no there's only one thing that does it
[2:12:09] is breaking into the presence of the one
[2:12:12] that's drawing you
[2:12:18] how beautiful if you try to help it you
[2:12:22] kill it
[2:12:23] now he brings he brings another type in
[2:12:26] here
[2:12:28] like a little chicken when it's being
[2:12:30] born
[2:12:31] you know if you ever notice that little
[2:12:34] fella
[2:12:35] right at the top of this little beak or
[2:12:37] any bird that's
[2:12:38] born from an egg it's got its
[2:12:42] maturing
[2:12:45] so that's what it's doing the birth
[2:12:48] process
[2:12:48] is a maturing if it's not that where
[2:12:52] you're at it's bad
[2:12:54] it's but that he wants you to mature
[2:12:57] and in order to mature you've got to go
[2:13:00] through it
[2:13:01] what i want you to catch this morning is
[2:13:03] that in your life
[2:13:04] your daily life you'll start to have
[2:13:07] mental battles
[2:13:09] you'll start to have uh you'll notice it
[2:13:13] even in your flesh you'll notice it
[2:13:14] about your life
[2:13:16] there's a discontentment there's an
[2:13:18] unhappiness there's a
[2:13:19] dissatisfaction you can't put your
[2:13:22] finger on it
[2:13:25] you look and you see everything about my
[2:13:27] life i'm doing good i
[2:13:28] i've kept all your commandments lord
[2:13:34] but there's one thing that lacketh
[2:13:38] die to where you're at and come follow
[2:13:42] me
[2:13:46] and i don't think we realize that
[2:13:47] struggle yet i'll try to hurry
[2:13:51] but it's maturing
[2:13:55] you you understand i feel that that's
[2:13:58] been the cry of our congregation
[2:14:01] is we want to mature
[2:14:04] we want to start seeing the signs and
[2:14:06] wonders we want to start seeing the
[2:14:08] loss we want to start seeing people
[2:14:10] baptized we want to start
[2:14:12] seeing people delivered we want to start
[2:14:14] seeing the
[2:14:15] evidence of our confession
[2:14:21] so we're wanting to mature you want to
[2:14:23] mature
[2:14:25] get ready for the birth pains
[2:14:27] [Music]
[2:14:32] not just as a natural
[2:14:35] but the church is made up out of
[2:14:37] individuals so if god's going to take
[2:14:39] the church
[2:14:40] he deals with the church he deals with
[2:14:43] the
[2:14:43] world and he deals with the individual
[2:14:45] in the same manner
[2:14:49] the church has been going through births
[2:14:51] the world's going to go through a birth
[2:14:53] and each individual as it matures goes
[2:14:56] from birth
[2:14:56] to birth to birth to birth
[2:15:02] it's maturing this old
[2:15:06] egg shell
[2:15:09] the old inner part of the egg has to rot
[2:15:13] away
[2:15:15] so what's happening your very inner part
[2:15:18] is starting to wrap everything that gave
[2:15:21] you
[2:15:22] peace and comfort seems to be drying up
[2:15:27] because you've got to mature you're in
[2:15:30] the
[2:15:31] shell of your
[2:15:35] existence
[2:15:39] of your present state existence you're
[2:15:42] in the shell of that
[2:15:43] but that seed that's inside of you
[2:15:48] wants to mature
[2:15:52] it's trying to mature so the old shell
[2:15:56] the inner part of the egg
[2:15:59] has got to rot
[2:16:04] that's you
[2:16:07] that's the personal you this old
[2:16:11] eggshell
[2:16:13] and it has to take this little beak
[2:16:16] and scrape back and forth until it
[2:16:19] breaks
[2:16:20] the shell out or it breaks
[2:16:23] out of the shell we call it pippin
[2:16:27] way down in kentucky where i come from
[2:16:29] pivot's way out
[2:16:31] they haven't found a better way see
[2:16:34] why it's god's provided
[2:16:37] way it's god's provided way
[2:16:40] for you to crack the shell
[2:16:47] because if that bird don't crack that
[2:16:50] shell that eagle
[2:16:52] if it don't crack that shell it'll die
[2:16:55] in the
[2:16:56] existence that it's in because it's got
[2:16:59] to mature
[2:17:00] and the only way it can mature to fly
[2:17:02] the sky
[2:17:03] fly out of here is to break the shell
[2:17:07] that it's in
[2:17:15] no better way see it's god's provided
[2:17:17] way you try to help him you'll kill him
[2:17:22] pick the shell off of him he'll die he's
[2:17:25] got to labor
[2:17:26] and strain to break forth
[2:17:31] we don't want that part of it
[2:17:34] but that's where we are
[2:17:37] we are not going to advance as a body
[2:17:39] until each of its members
[2:17:41] starts laboring and straining to get out
[2:17:44] of their
[2:17:54] shell
[2:17:56] and this is what he says you can't ca
[2:18:00] you know it's god's provided way
[2:18:03] you don't go in in by book
[2:18:07] or shaking hands and joining
[2:18:10] pumping up or pulling down
[2:18:16] there's just it's not an outward revival
[2:18:21] it's something that's happening within
[2:18:22] you personally
[2:18:24] you just simply have to get away from
[2:18:27] the old shell
[2:18:29] notice no better way has they
[2:18:32] ever found
[2:18:36] and it it's it's the only way to get
[2:18:39] there
[2:18:41] it is it is just uh is is just to go
[2:18:45] through it
[2:18:46] listen as we just read a a
[2:18:49] another verb that's the same thing in
[2:18:52] new birth
[2:18:55] so if you're talking about a new birth
[2:18:57] you look at your life where you're at
[2:19:00] and you're going to have to leave that
[2:19:04] amen
[2:19:06] you have to break the shell whether it's
[2:19:09] the shell of comfort
[2:19:11] whether it's the shell of fellowship
[2:19:16] whether it's the shell of of the social
[2:19:20] existence that
[2:19:24] they're in
[2:19:28] which i think the kids were talking
[2:19:30] about that the other day
[2:19:32] about this social shell that
[2:19:35] they're in and this uh
[2:19:39] devil app that's 100 inspired by the
[2:19:42] devil
[2:19:44] and i believe personally this isn't the
[2:19:46] word of the lord
[2:19:47] that if you're on there you've got a
[2:19:50] spirit
[2:19:52] the one where you girls take pictures of
[2:19:54] yourself 30 pictures of yourself
[2:19:57] and you stick it for every boy
[2:20:00] to look at i saw one the other day
[2:20:04] someone brought to my attention they
[2:20:05] said come look at this
[2:20:06] this girl she's a beautiful good
[2:20:07] christian girl she's in the message
[2:20:09] she's got 415 lusters
[2:20:17] i think they call them followers
[2:20:22] if you really i want to make a rule
[2:20:26] but it's not my place to do it but if
[2:20:29] you're on there
[2:20:30] you can't come to those doors till you
[2:20:32] get born again
[2:20:33] that's how strong i feel about it don't
[2:20:36] post yourself out there for some devil
[2:20:39] let me tell you what the prophet of god
[2:20:40] said they came to a christian man
[2:20:43] and asked if they could take his
[2:20:45] daughter's picture
[2:20:47] and put it on a box of candy
[2:20:51] and he said that old guy rose up out of
[2:20:53] that chair
[2:20:54] and liked to smoke those guys saying you
[2:20:57] want to turn my daughter into a
[2:20:59] prostitute
[2:21:01] and that was on a box of candy and now
[2:21:03] we throw ourselves out their daddies
[2:21:07] you need to sit down with your girls get
[2:21:10] their phone out
[2:21:11] and find out on that if they're on that
[2:21:15] instant possession program
[2:21:19] i got off track
[2:21:25] it's the same thing with the new birth
[2:21:28] we never go back
[2:21:33] but we go forward when you're born again
[2:21:38] right so you don't go back you don't
[2:21:41] come and build a camp
[2:21:42] in an egg but you go forward so when you
[2:21:45] want to go forward you got to break that
[2:21:47] shell
[2:21:48] you've got to come out of the place
[2:21:50] you're in you've got to mature
[2:21:52] you've you gotta die to all the comfort
[2:21:55] of it
[2:21:56] all the the knowledge you've gained in
[2:21:58] it
[2:21:59] all the security you have of being in
[2:22:01] that shell
[2:22:06] but if you're gods you're going forward
[2:22:11] we go forward when you're born again and
[2:22:14] that's
[2:22:15] why i think today we have
[2:22:19] not so many rather genuine new
[2:22:23] births it's because the seed
[2:22:27] maybe will sympathize with the word
[2:22:30] or the person but they don't
[2:22:33] want to rot away from the old
[2:22:36] system that they're in
[2:22:40] they don't want to come out of it
[2:22:47] okay that that's what they they don't
[2:22:50] want to do they don't want to come out
[2:22:52] of it
[2:22:53] they still try to hold on to the old
[2:22:55] system
[2:22:56] the and claim it
[2:23:00] this but the old system age
[2:23:03] must die rot in order to bring forth the
[2:23:06] new one
[2:23:07] they still want to cling
[2:23:12] they they they still want to hold on to
[2:23:16] parts of it
[2:23:18] maybe you've got a certain prestige in
[2:23:21] the church
[2:23:24] and you've got a certain recognition and
[2:23:27] you've got people telling you how
[2:23:28] wonderful you are and how good you are
[2:23:31] and
[2:23:32] and everything and yeah
[2:23:35] and you you've got this nice little uh
[2:23:38] existence
[2:23:39] and this nice little system we got
[2:23:42] systems
[2:23:44] but but you're just in there and and the
[2:23:48] battle is
[2:23:49] it is you you want to cling
[2:23:56] and god wants you to have a birth
[2:24:00] and you don't want to leave where you're
[2:24:02] at
[2:24:04] like the eagle in the nest lord i'm
[2:24:07] pretty comfortable here
[2:24:09] i it took me a long time to get here
[2:24:17] finally they call me brother
[2:24:22] you know they're glad to see me
[2:24:28] in fact the world even likes me for a
[2:24:30] change
[2:24:32] and god's saying fine
[2:24:35] i gave you that i blessed you
[2:24:40] it's all of me but now son
[2:24:44] follow me sell that existence out
[2:24:50] sell that existence change where you're
[2:24:53] at
[2:24:54] change your existence again that's the
[2:24:57] battle
[2:24:58] is they want to cling we want to add
[2:25:03] instead of come out
[2:25:06] he says and and he may say he said but
[2:25:10] you see
[2:25:12] the thing of it is it's so hard for many
[2:25:15] men
[2:25:16] when they look at it and believe it and
[2:25:18] see
[2:25:19] it so identified by god in the word
[2:25:23] yet it's hard to rot away from
[2:25:26] that thing you've been in
[2:25:31] see we want to cling to it it's hard to
[2:25:33] rot away from the thing we've been in
[2:25:36] now we're not talking about denomination
[2:25:38] we're talking about where we are this
[2:25:39] morning
[2:25:40] like i said mike messi mike i'm not
[2:25:42] trying to re-preach brother branham's
[2:25:44] message
[2:25:48] but all i can do is go to it and
[2:25:52] and and have the spirit break
[2:25:55] a portion of the manna that's in there
[2:25:58] to us
[2:25:59] and bring it to whomever is hungry
[2:26:06] but not only is he talking about i'm
[2:26:08] just talking about the individual
[2:26:10] process
[2:26:11] of us moving to higher ground that it
[2:26:14] takes a birth
[2:26:15] and a go to a struggle he's talking
[2:26:17] about the church
[2:26:18] he's talking about the world he's
[2:26:20] talking about my goodness
[2:26:24] how the world wars fit in
[2:26:29] and i'm just trying to say lord i'm just
[2:26:31] trying to get up the next rung
[2:26:35] he's preached from the bottom of the
[2:26:37] ladder to the top of the ladder
[2:26:39] from genesis to revelation from before
[2:26:42] the stars were ever
[2:26:43] created all the way into eternity
[2:26:48] but lord let me eat the meal
[2:26:51] that you've put before me because if i
[2:26:53] can eat this meal
[2:26:56] and accomplish this portion of it i will
[2:26:59] take a step
[2:27:00] up the ladder and that's all i want to
[2:27:03] do
[2:27:04] i want to move from one step to another
[2:27:07] step
[2:27:09] and i don't want to clean the thing that
[2:27:11] you've been
[2:27:12] in what would i do
[2:27:19] what would i do if i left where
[2:27:23] i'm at where would my meal come from
[2:27:27] will god's your meal it's the thing
[2:27:30] you're in
[2:27:32] whether it's the state of your mind
[2:27:37] whether it's the pattern of your life
[2:27:41] the routine or your spiritual condition
[2:27:50] see they they they want to cling because
[2:27:52] they don't want to give up something
[2:27:55] you don't want to break out of an old
[2:27:57] habit
[2:28:00] so it's hard to break away it's hard not
[2:28:03] to cling
[2:28:04] that's the birth the birth and the
[2:28:07] struggle
[2:28:08] is breaking the cling
[2:28:13] is taking your hands off of what you're
[2:28:15] holding on it's the comfort you have in
[2:28:17] your mind
[2:28:18] is talk to all what you're going through
[2:28:21] i always think of what must be going
[2:28:23] through
[2:28:24] the mind of a potential bride
[2:28:33] i'm i'm going to put myself into this
[2:28:36] guy's hands
[2:28:42] i mean that mental battle must be
[2:28:45] crazy i thank god i didn't have to go
[2:28:49] through it
[2:28:52] he said this is your wife you're going
[2:28:54] to marry or whether you like it or not
[2:28:55] because she's going to try to make you
[2:28:56] better
[2:28:58] okay
[2:29:01] you know my testimony i needed that
[2:29:06] but it it's a great it's uh i to me
[2:29:11] that's just another struggle that you go
[2:29:14] through when you make that decision
[2:29:16] you've got to battle the questions in
[2:29:18] your mind you've got to come to a
[2:29:20] conclusion you weigh it out you pray
[2:29:22] about it you pray about it
[2:29:23] you cry out until you get peace
[2:29:28] you know and you got to get rid of the
[2:29:31] idea he's going to pull up in a chariot
[2:29:33] and on a white horse and
[2:29:35] you know and the slipper is going to fit
[2:29:44] so that that's what it's hard to believe
[2:29:47] he to to seek first the kingdom of god
[2:29:52] and his righteousness and all else will
[2:29:54] be added on to
[2:29:55] so it's hard to give something up so
[2:29:58] it's even hard
[2:30:02] when you want to add something to your
[2:30:04] life
[2:30:06] you go through the battle and the birth
[2:30:09] to to get
[2:30:10] come out of something you go through the
[2:30:12] birth the struggle the pain
[2:30:14] and you may some of you may find
[2:30:16] yourselves in that right now
[2:30:18] because god's trying to transform you in
[2:30:21] to more of a person
[2:30:22] a greater thing and you're trying to fit
[2:30:24] your business your job your work your
[2:30:26] wife your kid
[2:30:27] everything you're going through this
[2:30:29] great struggle but you can't help
[2:30:31] yourself
[2:30:32] because there's something drawing you
[2:30:34] out
[2:30:36] and so it's hard until you cling to old
[2:30:38] things
[2:30:39] old habits and it takes a birth
[2:30:42] to come out of the old habits but it
[2:30:45] also takes a birth to add a new habit
[2:30:52] to add something into your life where is
[2:30:54] that going to fit
[2:30:56] what's the effect that's going to have
[2:31:00] but don't you seek and i'll read this to
[2:31:02] you
[2:31:03] in a second because
[2:31:06] it it just meant so much to me
[2:31:10] but i believe with my heart
[2:31:15] that this ride to get further and closer
[2:31:19] to god
[2:31:20] to get to the rapturing condition that
[2:31:23] we need to be in
[2:31:25] there's going to be a birthing process
[2:31:28] of that church
[2:31:32] that what we felt over
[2:31:36] these
[2:31:40] years that we've been in the message
[2:31:43] we felt the draw
[2:31:46] and the pull we even sing the song
[2:31:50] do you feel the pull
[2:31:53] but now the process of birth
[2:31:57] of dying of
[2:32:01] really letting him mold our nature
[2:32:04] and our personality not clinging to the
[2:32:07] old ways
[2:32:09] some of the ways we've been taught some
[2:32:10] of the rapes we've been raised up in
[2:32:13] from other ways we've been told the
[2:32:15] truth but he wants to add a
[2:32:17] more breadth of life he wants to add
[2:32:19] deeper and greater understandings
[2:32:22] and you can help it along
[2:32:26] in other words a preacher can't give it
[2:32:28] to you by pulling by jumping
[2:32:32] by getting you to come to the altar no
[2:32:34] it's an
[2:32:35] internal struggle
[2:32:38] of the inner man maturing
[2:32:43] the dying out of the life
[2:32:46] that he's in and the breaking from the
[2:32:50] old shell
[2:32:51] into the new because the new cannot
[2:32:55] exist with the old
[2:32:59] you cannot have two laws at the same
[2:33:02] time brother branham uses a word
[2:33:07] that uh uh
[2:33:10] i don't even i can't even even
[2:33:13] say the word you know what i mean but
[2:33:16] he's
[2:33:17] he's just talking about this great
[2:33:20] maturing and this great thing he calls
[2:33:23] it like a zephora
[2:33:25] or something something to do with
[2:33:27] computers
[2:33:30] and i think my goodness it's a law
[2:33:33] of what causes one thing to act i'll
[2:33:35] show it to you some of you
[2:33:36] technological brothers you go to
[2:33:39] wikipedia and wikipedia explains it as a
[2:33:42] as some sort of a programming
[2:33:46] thing that keeps two things from
[2:33:48] existing
[2:33:49] together at the same time don't tell me
[2:33:53] bill brown couldn't skip dimensions and
[2:33:55] go into time
[2:33:57] why did i thought why did he drop that
[2:33:59] word in there
[2:34:00] he dropped that word in there so we
[2:34:02] could know that this works for us
[2:34:08] and so if if you did that then you
[2:34:13] you find out that this struggle
[2:34:17] is built in to the birth
[2:34:20] of christianity
[2:34:24] and i'm going to just finish this
[2:34:25] morning i know
[2:34:27] i guess it's been really long and you've
[2:34:30] really been
[2:34:31] patient but for those of you that come
[2:34:33] back for communion will just have
[2:34:35] communion
[2:34:36] it'll be very short but i hope this sums
[2:34:40] it up
[2:34:41] for you
[2:34:45] and speaking of the church and where we
[2:34:47] are
[2:34:48] now she's in the worst stage that
[2:34:51] according to the scriptures
[2:34:53] she's ever been we're in the lady you'll
[2:34:56] see in church age
[2:34:59] a rich blind church age
[2:35:03] that don't know it and that's why i
[2:35:06] thought it's good to understand
[2:35:09] what you're going through if god's
[2:35:11] calling you to higher ground
[2:35:13] you're going to go through a birth there
[2:35:16] wasn't
[2:35:17] nowhere in the bible that christ was
[2:35:20] ever put
[2:35:21] out of the church but the lady of cnh
[2:35:25] she's in the worst age she's in the
[2:35:28] rottenest
[2:35:29] she ever was i said i said as a queen
[2:35:34] having need of nothing
[2:35:37] and don't know that you're naked
[2:35:39] miserable blind poor
[2:35:41] and don't know it yes sir i said
[2:35:44] i counsel thee to come by eye salve
[2:35:49] from me that thou might
[2:35:52] open your eyes
[2:35:56] that will certainly the eyes have of god
[2:35:59] will certainly bring
[2:36:00] light to the church if it wants to
[2:36:04] open its eyes to what god
[2:36:07] has said this gospel this morning will
[2:36:11] bring light to you
[2:36:13] if you really want to understand what
[2:36:15] you're going to have to go through
[2:36:17] to be a higher class or
[2:36:20] i don't want to use the word class a
[2:36:23] higher matured christian
[2:36:26] notice quickly and this this is the part
[2:36:28] i just want to
[2:36:29] let set into us notice quickly now
[2:36:33] she is in that stage beyond a shadow of
[2:36:37] a doubt
[2:36:38] we're in the ladies in church age now
[2:36:41] her messenger is promised in malachi
[2:36:45] the fourth chapter he's promised
[2:36:48] to do it and the message is to bring
[2:36:52] back the word bring
[2:36:55] the people back to the word birth
[2:36:59] is to be
[2:37:05] the messenger was to bring you to the
[2:37:08] birth
[2:37:09] process
[2:37:12] so it burns you and you go through a
[2:37:14] birth process and then the message
[2:37:15] brings you to another birth process
[2:37:17] and another perk because it's drawing
[2:37:19] you into the presence of his rapture
[2:37:23] the birth is to be she's to be delivered
[2:37:27] of a new birth according
[2:37:31] to malachi 4 5.
[2:37:34] she's to be delivered another according
[2:37:37] means
[2:37:38] by
[2:37:43] the church world today is in two systems
[2:37:47] of working now listen real close
[2:37:51] i want you to see if you're going to say
[2:37:54] amen on this there is two systems
[2:37:58] working in the church today
[2:38:00] and i'm going to get this off my
[2:38:03] shoulder
[2:38:04] and then i have it over with we all know
[2:38:07] that that's the word of god and the
[2:38:10] denominational system
[2:38:13] and we talked that last week called it a
[2:38:16] what
[2:38:17] a one-man denomination
[2:38:21] it's the system within yourself
[2:38:26] the egg that you're in
[2:38:29] working just as there was
[2:38:32] jacob and esau one after the spirit
[2:38:36] the other after the flesh and what is it
[2:38:39] esau and jacob was fighting in the womb
[2:38:43] of the mother
[2:38:45] even to the time they
[2:38:48] were born the struggles within you
[2:38:55] coming out and the separation
[2:38:59] and the denominational and the word
[2:39:02] fighting one against the other
[2:39:06] they have been since luther first
[2:39:09] brought it in
[2:39:10] in reformation i hope that's simple
[2:39:12] enough that you can understand it
[2:39:18] it's that struggle that jacob and esau
[2:39:22] the world you take your religion you
[2:39:25] take your belief
[2:39:26] you're going in the world and pretty
[2:39:28] soon you take what you believe
[2:39:31] all your things and you join it to the
[2:39:33] world you're in
[2:39:36] and all of a sudden you're going to find
[2:39:38] out you've got a jacob and esau
[2:39:40] struggle going in you
[2:39:44] because that becomes a womb you're in
[2:39:49] and now he wants to break out of that
[2:39:51] womb and give you a birth
[2:39:54] and move you up well we're in such an
[2:39:57] age now we're so padded and pampered and
[2:39:59] hot house plant
[2:40:01] that we don't want to go through no
[2:40:02] struggles we don't want to leave we want
[2:40:05] to cling to what we've got we want to
[2:40:07] bring it with us
[2:40:12] wouldn't you love to get to the place
[2:40:16] that somebody without you even knowing
[2:40:19] it
[2:40:20] just said i know this brother here i'll
[2:40:22] just take you and we'll just stand
[2:40:24] and when he walks by us
[2:40:28] if his shadow touches us we'll feel the
[2:40:31] presence of god
[2:40:36] i love patrick's testimony i don't know
[2:40:39] if patrick's here
[2:40:42] but there was a brother that was
[2:40:45] backslid used to go to our church
[2:40:48] and he's on the job
[2:40:51] and patrick says i'm going to kill
[2:40:53] myself
[2:40:57] i can't stand it i can't sleep
[2:41:01] i haven't slept in days this spirit
[2:41:03] won't leave me alone
[2:41:05] i can't take it no more i'm going to
[2:41:06] kill myself and this backslid
[2:41:09] brother says you need to go talk to
[2:41:11] brother such and such over at this
[2:41:14] church
[2:41:17] so he's brought over and
[2:41:21] we talk with him and we tell him and we
[2:41:23] pray for him
[2:41:24] as i said brother when you get out in
[2:41:26] your car you just give him a
[2:41:29] so brother patrick went out in the car
[2:41:32] and there was three books sitting there
[2:41:34] and he said just pick one of these books
[2:41:36] he picked demonology
[2:41:41] so all of a sudden i see he's at church
[2:41:44] coming walking across the parking lot
[2:41:46] and i said padre
[2:41:48] i says how are you doing oh brother
[2:41:50] david i just can't sleep
[2:41:52] i read these books i just stay up all
[2:41:54] night i just can't get enough of them
[2:41:56] i just can't sleep god's blessing me so
[2:41:58] much
[2:42:03] isn't it time we start writing some
[2:42:05] testimonies in our lives
[2:42:11] we start having converts and
[2:42:15] but that's going to take a birth
[2:42:19] because that jacob and esau fight that's
[2:42:22] in us
[2:42:23] and he says there's an esau
[2:42:28] just a man of the world very religious
[2:42:32] he's all right good fellow clean moral
[2:42:36] so far as i know but he didn't know
[2:42:38] nothing about the birthright
[2:42:41] or the birth process he's born that way
[2:42:47] he's shaped that way and jacob i don't
[2:42:50] care what he is
[2:42:51] he wants that birthright he's the
[2:42:54] spiritual one
[2:42:56] that's you this morning and so i
[2:42:59] as your friend i just want you to
[2:43:02] understand
[2:43:04] that god's calling us the higher ground
[2:43:08] and it's not just a simple process
[2:43:12] of him pouring more oil on you
[2:43:16] or more rain on you he's got to kill
[2:43:20] where you are and the comfort of that
[2:43:24] place
[2:43:25] because even though you're very
[2:43:27] spiritual
[2:43:29] where you are now cannot exist at the
[2:43:32] same time
[2:43:33] with where he wants to take you so
[2:43:37] i pray father i pray for the birthright
[2:43:42] that's mine and i know it's already 12
[2:43:45] 30 but
[2:43:47] i forgot i had a baptism so what we'll
[2:43:50] do
[2:43:51] is we'll stand and
[2:43:54] be dismissed and brother billy can lead
[2:43:57] us in
[2:43:58] song and if jemima and brother john
[2:44:00] would come
[2:44:01] we're going to go baptize one but i hope
[2:44:04] this morning
[2:44:06] that at least this brings an
[2:44:09] understanding
[2:44:10] to you that when you find yourself
[2:44:14] in these great places that you will
[2:44:17] realize
[2:44:18] it's god trying to birth you
[2:44:22] and make you more than what you've ever
[2:44:26] been before do you love them this
[2:44:27] morning let's stand together god bless
[2:44:29] you
[2:44:30] brother billy thank you

[2:52:49] part
[2:52:50] now i'm just trusting god will do his
[2:52:53] part
[2:52:54] and sister jamina comes this morning
[2:52:59] and she said brother david you know i i
[2:53:02] i don't know what it is i
[2:53:04] i'm kind of nervous and i'm kind of and
[2:53:08] anticipation and and
[2:53:11] i thought oh there's that struggle
[2:53:15] there's that discomfort there's that
