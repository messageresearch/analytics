[37:48] we certainly
[37:51] fall before your throne
[37:54] [Music]
[37:56] Lord our
[38:00] frailties and weaknesses are so
[38:04] manifested
[38:06] in this wicked age
[38:10] that we so rely on the promise you made
[38:12] I'll not leave you nor forsake you
[38:16] but I'll be with you even in you
[38:18] we certainly ask you to bless to us your
[38:21] word tonight
[38:22] we've come out father too
[38:25] worship you
[38:27] [Music]
[38:28] to magnify your name to make a stand
[38:32] father to identify with this message and
[38:37] the work that you're doing in this hour
[38:40] father that our voice and our light
[38:44] might shine
[38:46] Lord in that
[38:48] where we put our shoulder to the wheel
[38:51] that
[38:52] it might be a
[38:54] a shiny example that there's hope in
[38:57] life for every man that doesn't have you
[39:01] Lord we ask again this evening that you
[39:04] be with us in your precious and holy
[39:07] name we pray amen amen let's turn in our
[39:11] Bibles to a little scripture and
[39:15] this is a great chapter
[39:19] in the Bible and
[39:22] it I know there's a lot more in it than
[39:27] I'm able to get out of it but I just
[39:30] hope as I we continue to grow in the
[39:33] Lord all the scripture will become more
[39:35] real to us
[39:37] so
[39:38] uh
[39:40] I'd like to read at starting uh
[39:46] in the ninth verse and and so Paul's
[39:50] writing here because people say well boy
[39:53] he writes a mean letter
[39:55] you know what I mean and and uh but when
[39:58] he's here he's feeble and then so this
[40:01] is he's writing back his response he
[40:04] said he says that I may not seem as if I
[40:08] would
[40:09] terrify You by letters
[40:12] for his letters say they are weighty and
[40:17] Powerful
[40:19] but his bold but but his bodily presence
[40:24] is weak and his speech contemptible
[40:29] let such a one think this
[40:32] that such as we are in Word by letters
[40:37] when we are absent
[40:40] such will be we be also indeed when we
[40:46] are present in that a great scripture
[40:50] amen for we dare not make ourselves
[40:55] of the number or compare ourselves with
[41:00] some that commend themselves
[41:05] but they measure themselves by
[41:08] themselves
[41:09] comparing themselves among themselves
[41:13] are not wise amen
[41:18] so Heavenly Father we ask you to bless
[41:20] your word to us this evening your
[41:23] precious name we pray amen you may be
[41:25] seated
[41:28] amen just just got back from a nice
[41:32] weekend in in uh
[41:35] Phoenix and came back to this beautiful
[41:37] weather and it was just wonderful and it
[41:42] felt so good we stepped out of the plane
[41:44] it was warm there and uh
[41:47] we had good reports from all those that
[41:50] complimented us and we don't know what
[41:52] the other people were saying you know so
[41:55] we just believe those that said we did
[41:58] good and everybody else
[42:00] uh it's okay but uh we we had uh I used
[42:06] Friday night we had a senior married
[42:10] couples
[42:12] uh banquet
[42:14] and uh and let me tell you I wasn't the
[42:18] most senior person there so uh kind of
[42:21] intimidating you know people married 60
[42:24] 65 years but uh we we preached a little
[42:29] subject matter called
[42:32] the one that you are
[42:34] the one that you are and we we know that
[42:38] God makes you makes Twain one flesh and
[42:42] then the scripture uh we went over and
[42:45] read in Ephesians where we're foreigned
[42:48] under good works that we should walk in
[42:50] them so we just you know we kind of
[42:52] presented out to the other people that
[42:56] you know it's not too late to serve God
[42:58] and that God does have a work and
[43:01] there's something that we should do for
[43:03] God apart from the church church isn't a
[43:06] substitute for what God would have you
[43:09] to do you know everybody thinks well
[43:12] religious work or spiritual work is
[43:14] church work not necessarily so amen you
[43:18] just be led to the spirit amen and then
[43:21] on Saturday night we preached that God
[43:26] put marriage in you
[43:29] God put marriage in you and so uh you
[43:33] know I mentioned how there's a lot of
[43:36] young men that said they they were oh
[43:38] I'm never going to get married I'm never
[43:39] going to get married and all of a sudden
[43:41] that one comes along
[43:43] you know and ruins the whole plan and uh
[43:47] so we talked about God putting marriage
[43:50] in you and how that he did it because it
[43:54] wasn't good for a man to dwell alone
[43:57] and then Peter goes over and he says now
[44:00] husbands love your wives and and have
[44:03] respect because their joint heirs
[44:06] together with you in the faith and so we
[44:09] just talked about how that you have an
[44:12] inheritance but you can't have it
[44:14] without her
[44:17] because he he put it in your heart to
[44:20] marry the one he had for you because his
[44:23] reward to you or to you together
[44:26] you know when everybody gets the idea
[44:28] well I'm going to get mine no she's got
[44:31] you know half of it so
[44:35] you can't get any of it without that one
[44:38] so it was a really nice time and and uh
[44:41] we've been talking a little bit about
[44:43] faith and we want to continue on faith
[44:46] tonight and uh
[44:49] I'd like just to make a few stains and I
[44:52] just want to listen to a few paragraphs
[44:54] this evening out of perfect faith and we
[44:58] know that faith
[45:00] is something that is of substance
[45:05] in other words I could almost say it
[45:08] like this I
[45:10] um
[45:11] maybe I shouldn't say it like this but
[45:13] faith is something you know you have
[45:16] you know what I mean it's a possession I
[45:19] don't want to call it that exactly a
[45:22] Feeling
[45:23] you know what I mean because that can be
[45:26] mixed up with emotions but if it's a
[45:29] gift of God and it's a revelation and
[45:33] faith is a revelation then it's actually
[45:35] absolutely something that you know that
[45:38] you received apart from yourself all of
[45:43] a sudden you know that this Faith isn't
[45:45] generated by me it's a gift of God God's
[45:50] he's inspired me and he's quickened me
[45:55] and he's brought this alive to me and
[45:59] he's made it real to me and and so
[46:03] that's what that what that that faith is
[46:06] it becomes a substance and now that
[46:09] substance that thing that God imparts to
[46:13] you that becomes the evidence
[46:16] right that you're going to see
[46:19] manifested what he revealed to you and
[46:24] quickened to you and the prophet of
[46:26] God's going to make a statement when we
[46:28] start he said faith is a seed so a seed
[46:32] is something that grows into something
[46:34] so maybe you're not well and you're
[46:38] seeking a healing for your body and and
[46:42] God comes along and he shows you that
[46:46] you're going to be well that he's a
[46:48] Healer and and you didn't have this but
[46:52] now this faith is given to you because
[46:55] faith is a gift
[46:57] and now you've been quickened you you've
[47:00] you you have this substance but now that
[47:03] substance is it is in evidence now it
[47:07] because it's a seed it's going to grow
[47:09] into
[47:12] the manifestation it doesn't have to
[47:15] happen
[47:16] and and we'll talk about those great
[47:18] Heroes of Faith so
[47:22] um
[47:23] and the one of the great things about
[47:26] faith
[47:27] is that if if it's it's if it's given to
[47:32] you of God
[47:34] um I just want to share this with you I
[47:36] hope it helps somebody it it stands
[47:40] alone
[47:41] you understand so if God gives me this
[47:45] Faith this Faith isn't related to
[47:48] anything else it stands alone it stands
[47:52] on its own mirror it's god-given and so
[47:56] what happens is your flesh
[47:59] Wars against the spirit and the spirit
[48:01] against the Flesh and these two things
[48:04] are contrary to the other and it's just
[48:08] like when you live you you drive you
[48:11] frustrations come and and fatigue comes
[48:15] in yeah sometimes you get annoyed and
[48:19] and you you you you're tempted and you
[48:22] do all those things but those things
[48:24] aren't you
[48:26] you understand none of that can be laid
[48:28] to the charge of God's elect
[48:31] because the seed of God remains in them
[48:35] so this is standalone
[48:38] so if I have this in my heart
[48:41] here
[48:42] you've never seen a person put a bottle
[48:45] of water in their heart before
[48:47] well I just did
[48:49] so it's here in my heart it doesn't
[48:52] matter what's coming against all this
[48:55] outside because it's given by God it
[48:59] can't be taken away from me
[49:03] that's the difference between drummed up
[49:05] Faith
[49:07] you understand and and word faith or
[49:11] Revelation Faith or gifted faith it
[49:14] can't be stolen from you and even no
[49:17] matter how bad the battle gets it still
[49:19] can't be stole you know Abraham it had
[49:23] that promise right and he couldn't even
[49:27] give it away
[49:30] it stands on its own and so we find out
[49:34] that Faith stands on its own it's
[49:36] something that's real and
[49:39] and so uh I like what Paul was talking
[49:43] here he says that they compare
[49:45] themselves among themselves yeah you
[49:48] know what I mean if and and so he go he
[49:51] goes on and takes a little a whole
[49:54] section about comparing and boasting and
[49:56] measuring and Paul says I'm not going to
[49:59] measure myself above any measurement
[50:01] than that which I've received of him
[50:05] this is my measuring is is the word of
[50:08] God it's Faith uh you know I mean in our
[50:13] world the prophet of God called The Max
[50:16] Factor world you know people they put
[50:18] pain on and everything and they got this
[50:21] whole idea what's beautiful and they
[50:24] they say this is beauty this is beauty
[50:26] this is beauty you know this is what
[50:29] pretty is and act and none of that is is
[50:34] real Beauty
[50:36] you know what I mean I mean it's Beauty
[50:38] the real beauty is character
[50:41] you know what I mean that's the real
[50:43] Beauty that's that's the real substance
[50:46] by by which you measure something
[50:50] and a real child of God measures uh His
[50:55] companion by by the character that they
[51:00] have and and of course there's many
[51:02] quotes that's not the subject that we
[51:04] want to go along but we're talking about
[51:09] about faith and
[51:12] and so one of the things that that men
[51:17] do is they measure and compare
[51:20] and this struck me as you know the
[51:24] Lord's been dealing with my heart on it
[51:26] and I'm I'm growing into it if I could
[51:30] say that with you and share with you uh
[51:33] what What's transpiring within myself
[51:35] but I'm beginning to realize that there
[51:39] is a a realm of faith
[51:44] and uh
[51:46] and the definition of a realm is a
[51:50] sovereign state sometimes it's referred
[51:52] to as a kingdom or a a a area of ground
[51:59] that is ruled over by a certain person
[52:03] well faith is or is a realm okay it's
[52:08] the realm of faith and if I could
[52:10] describe it to you this way just the way
[52:13] it came to me it says he says faith is
[52:19] the sovereign state of God's presence
[52:22] where he is The Sovereign Authority so
[52:27] the the faith is around and so because
[52:32] it's a realm or it's in existence it it
[52:36] can be measured by things seen
[52:40] you understand so in the realm of Faith
[52:43] there's no measurement
[52:46] there's no measuring there's no big eyes
[52:49] or little ears there's no great there's
[52:53] no powerful uh that there's you know oh
[52:57] this brother's got power or or or those
[53:00] things the prophet of God even says he
[53:02] says gifts are wonderful but you can't
[53:04] base your faith on them
[53:07] because it's a measurement
[53:09] and we measure We compare ourselves one
[53:13] with another the scripture tells us that
[53:15] your fools to compare yourself one with
[53:18] another because when you start doing
[53:20] that you're now taking away from The
[53:24] Sovereign presence of God
[53:27] and what was Abraham's measurement of
[53:32] Faith was that God is able to perform
[53:36] that's what he promised so that's the
[53:39] realm of faith and so we can't measure
[53:44] Faith by our temptations by our failures
[53:49] by the ever nagging voice of the Enemy
[53:53] by the uh by the darkness that's around
[53:58] us because that that you're measuring
[54:01] something by that you would say I don't
[54:04] possess this because it's dark out there
[54:08] is dark in the world or I don't have
[54:11] faith because I I get so frustrated or I
[54:15] get so discouraged no God didn't measure
[54:18] it by that faith is a gift of God lest
[54:22] any man should boast
[54:24] it was given Abraham was no different
[54:26] than any other person but God gave him a
[54:30] revelation
[54:31] and he believed that God could do it so
[54:34] he didn't measure it he he went into the
[54:36] Sovereign presence of God and that's the
[54:40] last sermon we preach here is that God
[54:42] faith is based on his presence that he's
[54:46] here and he's here to do what he said he
[54:50] would do
[54:51] it's not based on intellect it's not
[54:54] based on anything else it's based on the
[54:56] fact that he is here he hasn't gone away
[55:00] you know and I like what Paul said he
[55:03] said oh you say I write letters but I
[55:05] know when I come you're going to see
[55:07] what I write is going to be lived in
[55:11] front of you so the the Lord's here we
[55:14] don't see him but we know that he's here
[55:17] because he's made himself known to us
[55:23] we see it we know he's here because his
[55:27] word is coming to pass we know he's here
[55:30] because he's showing us these things
[55:31] that that he said would be happening and
[55:35] we know that they're happening we we
[55:37] know that he's here so we we met we
[55:41] don't measure by by among ourselves we
[55:43] don't measure we measure by his presence
[55:48] his presence is here and that's the
[55:50] realm that you want to go into is that
[55:53] is that great uh faith that it is and
[55:58] and just think that the the faith of
[56:02] that we have
[56:04] and what that were the challenge that's
[56:07] Pace before us so when we think of
[56:10] Abraham
[56:12] what we do is we measure Abraham by The
[56:16] Challenge he faced
[56:18] right Abraham was 80 years old and he
[56:22] believed God that they were going to
[56:23] have a baby
[56:25] so we kind of forget the faith
[56:29] and we looked at the the challenge
[56:32] you understand but God prepared Abraham
[56:37] the ground in Abraham's heart
[56:40] for him to accept and receive the faith
[56:45] to meet the challenge so we have a
[56:49] tendency to compare we think oh man
[56:52] Abraham Faith excuse me Abraham Faith
[56:55] because he accomplished this the it
[56:58] where Abraham was the father of all of
[57:00] our fans
[57:02] Abraham has no greater faith
[57:05] than you have
[57:10] but we think oh well this is the great
[57:12] work he accomplished Abraham never
[57:14] accomplished that work God accomplished
[57:17] that word it was the ever Sovereign
[57:20] presence of the Lord that performed that
[57:26] it was his presence that performed that
[57:29] great word but we have that we have a
[57:32] tendency to measure Faith by challenge
[57:37] now do you have faith to pick this
[57:41] water bottle up well if I have faith to
[57:44] pick this piano up does that mean I have
[57:47] more faith
[57:49] I never picked a piano up and you never
[57:53] picked a water bottle up he did it
[58:01] because he's sovereign
[58:02] faith is a sovereign presence of God God
[58:06] can do all things all things are
[58:08] possible in Christ Jesus
[58:11] amen we we measure righteousness oh this
[58:14] person lives really holy you know they
[58:17] they just you know you enjoy your
[58:20] righteousness it's filthy rights
[58:24] who's our righteousness he's Christ
[58:27] Jesus is our righteous he's our
[58:29] righteousness he's our identity he's our
[58:32] attorney he's our lawyer when you get up
[58:35] there you think you're going to present
[58:37] your righteousness no his righteousness
[58:39] he's going to stand there and say father
[58:44] I'm here I'm the representative
[58:47] I'm the righteousness my blood covers
[58:50] them they're in me amen you're not going
[58:53] to have to present Works you're not
[58:56] going to have to present anything that
[58:58] you've done that's going to get you in
[59:00] you you can you're not gonna lay a list
[59:04] of failures up there because he's
[59:06] throwing him in the sea of God's
[59:07] forgetfulness your blood bot your blood
[59:10] covered you're predestinated you're
[59:13] elected you're chosen you were
[59:16] pre-prepared
[59:19] boy we need to get out of the picture
[59:25] you know what I mean he's he's got
[59:28] something going on here
[59:30] he's in charge he's he's bringing it to
[59:33] pass he's gonna make you what he he
[59:35] wants you to be
[59:38] amen and so you don't measure the
[59:41] challenge we take
[59:43] we take Moses and we think Moses had
[59:46] great faith because he defeated pharaoh
[59:49] so we keep looking at the challenge and
[59:52] thinking that that the challenge is to
[59:54] the determination of faith
[59:57] but Abraham was prepared on the backside
[59:59] of the desert
[1:00:03] so God always prepares the ground to
[1:00:06] plant the seed in
[1:00:08] he makes the ground good and he plants
[1:00:11] the seed in it and it comes up now the
[1:00:14] person may be struggling with their self
[1:00:16] and struggling with their nature and
[1:00:19] struggling with the world in everything
[1:00:21] but but that's that's not laid to the
[1:00:25] Electoral the elect of that person
[1:00:27] because if it was then there would be
[1:00:30] some expectation of the person
[1:00:35] performing The Challenge apart from God
[1:00:41] does that make sense
[1:00:43] to you
[1:00:44] you know what I mean if you had to
[1:00:46] participate but because you you were
[1:00:49] never bugged you were never tempted you
[1:00:51] were never weary you were never
[1:00:53] discouraged you were never tempted you
[1:00:56] never made a mistake and everything well
[1:00:59] then you would think to think well not
[1:01:00] men well if I can do all that then I
[1:01:02] have some ability to meet the challenge
[1:01:06] but praise God he's going to meet the
[1:01:09] challenge for us
[1:01:11] so okay if you if I'm trying to make
[1:01:14] myself clear like I said I'm I'm walking
[1:01:16] through this myself and asking the Lord
[1:01:19] to open my eyes but we have such a
[1:01:21] tendency to measure the Challenger or or
[1:01:24] measure the the what we what we've got
[1:01:27] to overcome in other words a person that
[1:01:30] that believed God to be over a headache
[1:01:32] is lesser Faith than the person that
[1:01:35] believed God to overcome cancer
[1:01:40] no
[1:01:42] the person that had the headache needed
[1:01:45] God to heal him of a headache the person
[1:01:47] that had cancer needed God to heal him
[1:01:50] of a cancer in that case what you would
[1:01:52] want in order to have greater Faith you
[1:01:55] would want greater sickness
[1:02:00] that's a dead end Street
[1:02:03] I don't want to go down that road
[1:02:05] I'd Rather Have Faith keep me you know
[1:02:07] what I mean and then whatever comes up
[1:02:10] and whatever challenges Rises up against
[1:02:12] me that his faith is sufficient you know
[1:02:16] what I mean and his strength is made
[1:02:18] perfect in my weakness
[1:02:21] so we know these great things of Faith
[1:02:23] so we see this great challenge so like
[1:02:25] David you know we think oh David have
[1:02:28] faith why because he Faith Goliath
[1:02:32] well he did a lion he did a bear he did
[1:02:35] Goliath he could have done a lot of
[1:02:37] things
[1:02:38] so if I you understand what I'm trying
[1:02:41] to do I'm trying to get Faith to stand
[1:02:43] alone
[1:02:46] okay not measured
[1:02:49] because faith is The Sovereign presence
[1:02:52] of God
[1:02:54] The Sovereign ruling presence of God in
[1:02:59] the faith realm God rules that
[1:03:03] that's his Sovereign Place he rules it
[1:03:06] he this is it's done according to his
[1:03:09] will
[1:03:10] that Sovereign Place it's it's such a
[1:03:13] beautiful place so we we think of we
[1:03:15] think Daniel had Faith because the Lions
[1:03:18] didn't bite them
[1:03:20] well you know what
[1:03:22] I think the faith that you have
[1:03:25] and the challenge that you have
[1:03:29] is greater than all those challenges
[1:03:33] the challenge to withstand this devil of
[1:03:37] this evil age to me is is a greater
[1:03:41] Faith than any Goliath any Pharaoh you
[1:03:44] know in any lion
[1:03:49] to live in the God of this evil age and
[1:03:54] Satan's Eden to fight the God of this
[1:03:57] evil age that has totally rejected the
[1:03:59] word of God wants to make no stand for
[1:04:02] the word of God to me that's a greater
[1:04:05] challenge than any of these other carnal
[1:04:08] challenges
[1:04:09] because they were fighting flesh and
[1:04:11] blood but we're fighting spiritual
[1:04:13] wickedness in high places
[1:04:17] so don't let don't let your enemy the
[1:04:22] badgering of your enemy and the taunting
[1:04:25] of your energy of your enemy and and the
[1:04:29] darts and arrows that he throws at you
[1:04:32] thinking not strange at the fiery darts
[1:04:35] of the enemy and the trying of your
[1:04:37] faith
[1:04:39] we we don't let we don't let the
[1:04:42] negative be a measure and we don't let
[1:04:45] the challenge to be measured we know
[1:04:47] that we've been predestinated and
[1:04:50] prepared
[1:04:52] to sit in this hour and and meet the
[1:04:56] challenge for this age
[1:04:59] and that's why God said the the gospel
[1:05:01] of the world could not meet the
[1:05:03] challenge of the age and they couldn't
[1:05:06] believe because they didn't have
[1:05:08] anything in them to believe with
[1:05:13] oh I hope that comforts you
[1:05:16] you see when Paul says don't compare
[1:05:20] don't measure
[1:05:23] then we get into a church and we measure
[1:05:26] churches by numbers we measure them by
[1:05:29] their music we measure them by their
[1:05:31] opera singers we measure them by the the
[1:05:34] emotional power of their preachers
[1:05:38] and and the word of God sitting back
[1:05:40] wait a minute
[1:05:42] that's carnal
[1:05:46] faith is is is The Sovereign Realm
[1:05:50] of the presence of God
[1:05:53] where he rules
[1:05:55] in that Realm
[1:05:57] so can you imagine that if we could put
[1:05:59] our faith
[1:06:01] in his word
[1:06:03] and so I I I said that tonight because I
[1:06:06] just want to play this little portion of
[1:06:10] the the sermon this evening
[1:06:14] um it's just a little segment out of uh
[1:06:18] out of uh
[1:06:21] uh works as Faith expressed where
[1:06:23] brother REM talks about Noah and he
[1:06:26] talks about Moses and he talks about
[1:06:28] David and and their faith and how God
[1:06:32] prepared the ground and and it's
[1:06:34] beautiful and and so we just like to do
[1:06:38] that this evening so I don't know if you
[1:06:41] have a device
[1:06:44] I hope your device isn't a vice
[1:06:47] and we're going to start at paragraph
[1:06:50] 151 and uh I I know it offends uh some
[1:06:57] people like if you don't play the whole
[1:06:59] tape or you just played a segment but to
[1:07:03] me it's like going in and reading a
[1:07:05] chapter out of your Bible
[1:07:07] you know what I mean reading a quote to
[1:07:10] me is like reading a verse
[1:07:12] you know you don't have to read the
[1:07:14] whole book
[1:07:15] every time it's the word of God and so
[1:07:18] we hope it blesses you I hope that this
[1:07:21] little thought that might sow into your
[1:07:24] heart as a seed and and that it might
[1:07:27] grow
[1:07:29] because what my desire is
[1:07:33] in my heart is to grow into the
[1:07:37] awareness
[1:07:39] to be able to know which is good and
[1:07:42] which is evil to grow into the awareness
[1:07:45] to see God move
[1:07:49] you understand to understand the things
[1:07:51] of God to see God move
[1:07:54] so in the open door area how many knows
[1:07:57] the open door area in the time of the
[1:08:00] reformers it was called the open door
[1:08:02] right well the way that you knew God was
[1:08:06] moving was how the gospel
[1:08:09] was being spread
[1:08:11] and how converts were coming in and men
[1:08:14] were going out with with the message we
[1:08:18] called them circuit writer preachers or
[1:08:20] Apostles or missionaries and they were
[1:08:23] they were going and setting up churches
[1:08:25] and and they were going and you could
[1:08:27] sit back and watch the hand that God
[1:08:29] move
[1:08:31] well
[1:08:33] what would be our recognition
[1:08:36] of the hand of God moving in this day
[1:08:40] when Satan can impersonate every gift
[1:08:46] so you'd have to have to have an ability
[1:08:49] not to measure
[1:08:52] not to measure challenge not to measure
[1:08:56] what you're up against you'd have to
[1:08:58] have the ability to see him standing in
[1:09:02] his word doing and Performing exactly
[1:09:06] what he said he would do
[1:09:09] Lord give me I sap that I might see
[1:09:14] give me white random it
[1:09:16] the main the shame of my nakedness
[1:09:19] doesn't appear you know he's not talking
[1:09:22] about seat coats and dresses
[1:09:25] he's talking about the lack of
[1:09:28] Revelation the the the the shame of of
[1:09:32] of not being clothed with God's word and
[1:09:35] having the understanding of God's word
[1:09:37] and then give me gold
[1:09:39] character that what I read and what I
[1:09:44] see in the faith that I have in me that
[1:09:47] God placed within me that that will be
[1:09:49] fruitful
[1:09:50] and we won't be barren and we could see
[1:09:54] the fruits so we would know
[1:09:57] by being able to see that the church is
[1:10:01] moving into and God's moving because
[1:10:05] we're being formed into that statue of a
[1:10:08] perfect man and that Capstone of Love is
[1:10:12] coming down in our hearts and the love
[1:10:14] of God is being shed abroad in our heart
[1:10:17] by the Holy Spirit
[1:10:20] now wouldn't that be something if you
[1:10:22] could see the love of God in you instead
[1:10:24] of seeing the old negative
[1:10:26] failures
[1:10:28] measuring and comparing
[1:10:30] but loving without measure
[1:10:34] oh
[1:10:36] I believe it's possible
[1:10:39] Lord help me but anyway let's let's just
[1:10:41] listen to this and I hope that as you
[1:10:45] see these great men and what they
[1:10:48] overcome and the challenges they meant I
[1:10:50] want you to understand that what the
[1:10:52] faith that they had to do that was
[1:10:57] god-given
[1:11:01] you know what I mean god-given
[1:11:04] and God prepared him and God gave it to
[1:11:07] him and there's some tremendous
[1:11:08] statements here but Lord bless you
[1:11:10] tonight I I certainly hope you enjoy
[1:11:13] this portion I hope that your faith
[1:11:16] looks up and that you understand faith
[1:11:19] is just right here
[1:11:20] it's here for you
[1:11:22] it's here for you Lord open my eyes
[1:11:26] and come into my heart
[1:11:28] be real to me so Lord bless your brother
[1:11:31] David if you go ahead and play that for
[1:11:33] us thank you
[1:11:42] there's bound to be a womb somewhere for
[1:11:44] it to fall into
[1:11:46] just as he said all things are possible
[1:11:48] to them that believe
[1:11:50] if you say to this mountain don't doubt
[1:11:52] your heart
[1:11:53] you can have what you said
[1:11:55] see there's got to be somewhere that's
[1:11:58] right
[1:12:00] notice
[1:12:02] now we find that Isaiah here spoke it
[1:12:05] the Virgin Mary as soon as the grounds
[1:12:08] has already broke up she'd been a virgin
[1:12:10] run around the grounds have been
[1:12:13] already prepared
[1:12:15] are predestinated before knowledge of
[1:12:18] God
[1:12:19] even said she's a virgin right then God
[1:12:22] knows what her name would be
[1:12:24] for her name is on the Book of Life in
[1:12:27] heaven
[1:12:28] then
[1:12:30] it was Vindicated man
[1:12:33] then to man saw the expression of it by
[1:12:36] the works
[1:12:37] when it was already done now we look
[1:12:40] back say sure it was done because we see
[1:12:42] the works that was done Noah's Works
[1:12:45] expressed demand what is faithful isn't
[1:12:48] God's promise
[1:12:49] now God met Noah and he said Noah it's
[1:12:53] going to rain I'm going to destroy the
[1:12:55] whole Earth
[1:12:56] with water not never had rain
[1:12:58] that's the impossibility
[1:13:01] well now Noah God said prepare an ark if
[1:13:03] the dimensions that I'll tell you about
[1:13:05] and him being a carpenter and he went to
[1:13:08] work and began to take his foot out and
[1:13:10] everything to cut the boards and fix it
[1:13:12] up there with the of wood and put
[1:13:13] the pitch in it just like he said and do
[1:13:16] you imagine what people thought about
[1:13:17] that man
[1:13:18] hmm they said that man is actually crazy
[1:13:23] because he says it's going to bring
[1:13:25] water out of the heavens and there's no
[1:13:26] water up there
[1:13:28] but you see Noah didn't think about that
[1:13:31] his Works was expressing to the people
[1:13:34] what his faith was and what God Said
[1:13:36] would take place
[1:13:38] that's the reason the genuine Christian
[1:13:40] separates himself from everything but
[1:13:43] the word of God
[1:13:44] no matter what the people think what
[1:13:47] anybody else says
[1:13:49] he's separated because
[1:13:51] he isn't just saying that if he is it
[1:13:53] won't be long until these Works will be
[1:13:55] made on he'll fall back and slip this
[1:13:57] away and join this and this and start
[1:13:59] you you show what he is
[1:14:01] but if he's a genuine if the word of God
[1:14:05] has vetted into him
[1:14:07] then it's going to bring forth his kind
[1:14:08] you'll see that man preparing for that
[1:14:10] great hour see that's why Noah did Moses
[1:14:14] with a stick in his hand came to take
[1:14:18] the people from pharaoh
[1:14:21] now could you imagine Moses the Bible
[1:14:23] said that he was taught in all the
[1:14:25] wisdom of the Egyptians he was smart he
[1:14:28] could teach her interlex things he is
[1:14:31] taught all their wisdom he didn't need
[1:14:33] to catch up on his education now you
[1:14:35] just think about a man out there in the
[1:14:37] wilderness with all that education
[1:14:40] and then God appearing to him and said
[1:14:43] Moses take this stick in your hand and
[1:14:45] go down there in Egypt and bring my
[1:14:47] children out with this switch you got
[1:14:49] your hand
[1:14:50] just lick the whole thing with this
[1:14:52] switch
[1:14:54] not one of Moses had said sir just a
[1:14:56] moment I thought I was talking to an
[1:14:59] intelligent being this great I am that
[1:15:01] you say you are now how in the world
[1:15:04] would I ever take this little old
[1:15:06] Crooked Stick I got here in my hand and
[1:15:08] take over an army of millions of man arm
[1:15:11] with Spears spiders and I'm not a
[1:15:13] fighter I'm a shepherd
[1:15:15] how can I ever do that there was no
[1:15:17] question
[1:15:19] why
[1:15:20] why
[1:15:22] the ground in his heart
[1:15:24] he was a predestinated person
[1:15:28] gifts and callings are without
[1:15:29] repentance
[1:15:30] God have told Abraham that he would do
[1:15:32] that and there was the ground prepared
[1:15:36] and Moses toughness stick and went down
[1:15:39] there and took that Nation out of a
[1:15:42] Nation
[1:15:44] what'd he come with the stick in his
[1:15:46] hand he told Pharaoh let him go
[1:15:49] Pharaoh seen in Moses
[1:15:52] the works
[1:15:54] that he had faith in what he was going
[1:15:57] to do or trying to do he had faith in
[1:15:59] the promise of the god and made the
[1:16:01] promise
[1:16:02] he went down to take it over no other
[1:16:04] man would have done that and no other
[1:16:07] man could have done it
[1:16:08] he was ordained to do it
[1:16:11] God beforehand had told Abraham that
[1:16:14] that's just what would happen and when
[1:16:16] the time of the promise Drew not there
[1:16:18] was a little boy born
[1:16:20] a fair child and the parents Abraham
[1:16:24] addressed the Bell Was Not Afraid of the
[1:16:26] king's Commandments
[1:16:27] see there was something the grounds was
[1:16:30] already prepared
[1:16:33] oh God I hope I'm speaking to ground
[1:16:36] prepare her tonight
[1:16:39] at the sea can fall in the right place
[1:16:42] and it's going to be if it isn't it
[1:16:44] won't happen
[1:16:45] that's just same thing we say brother
[1:16:47] Bram that kind of takes it away from us
[1:16:49] if it does it takes away from
[1:16:50] Christianity too see you can impersonate
[1:16:53] anything but if it really falls in the
[1:16:56] word of God falls in the right kind of
[1:16:58] ground it's going to bring forth this
[1:17:00] kind it's got to because it's a seed nor
[1:17:03] Moses his Works Express faith in the
[1:17:07] promise of the God that he believed
[1:17:09] Pharaoh the man could see what was not
[1:17:13] he couldn't see how Moses is going to do
[1:17:15] it but he knows Moses believed what he
[1:17:18] was talking about or he wouldn't be
[1:17:19] standing in the palace there's a stick
[1:17:21] in his hand said buy this stick I'll
[1:17:22] take him out from you
[1:17:25] the old man 80 years old not an athlete
[1:17:29] an old man stoop shoulder and Whiskers
[1:17:31] hanging down to his probably his
[1:17:32] waistline gray hair if you had any and
[1:17:35] there was that stick in his hand saying
[1:17:37] I'm going to take him out let the people
[1:17:39] go thus saith the Lord
[1:17:42] if you don't do it God's going to judge
[1:17:45] you amen
[1:17:47] why that's was he afraid why just one
[1:17:51] Arrow one Spirit anything else would
[1:17:53] have ended it he was Fearless
[1:17:56] you know exactly where he was standing
[1:17:58] the girls Mighty pharaoh
[1:18:01] yes sir for her God told him you will
[1:18:04] come to this mountain again
[1:18:06] and he knows he was going there
[1:18:08] Hallelujah
[1:18:11] we know what we're going to at the end
[1:18:13] of this journey God has promised there's
[1:18:15] a land beyond the river
[1:18:19] be Peerless in your testimony
[1:18:21] amen if it's revealed to you are
[1:18:25] fearless you don't care if the whole wow
[1:18:27] what they say
[1:18:30] your Fearless One is revealed to you
[1:18:33] that this is the truth coming from God
[1:18:36] then you be Fearless
[1:18:38] not you can't be
[1:18:40] David with the shepherd swing expressed
[1:18:44] to the whole Israelite Army the faith
[1:18:47] that he had in their God
[1:18:51] now there was Goliath on the other side
[1:18:55] and he stood out there and made his
[1:18:57] voice many times bigger than David he
[1:18:59] had fingers 14 inches long
[1:19:01] and he was a man with big self
[1:19:03] the Palestine Giant and here was David
[1:19:06] the smallest one he was even too little
[1:19:09] to be in the army
[1:19:10] too much of a runt they couldn't use him
[1:19:13] so his brothers is out there in the army
[1:19:15] and then Goliath is making his boast but
[1:19:18] David now remember it was revealed today
[1:19:24] he thought here is the armies of the
[1:19:27] Living God
[1:19:29] standing in their own land
[1:19:31] and there's a boasted uncircumcised
[1:19:34] Philistine on Earth
[1:19:35] we'll call him cancer tonight
[1:19:38] they're called it paralytics
[1:19:41] why David was no kind of a match for him
[1:19:45] not with any kind of a weapon
[1:19:47] he was no match that man's shoulders is
[1:19:50] probably 10 12 foot across it's probably
[1:19:52] saying 14 15 foot high
[1:19:54] a spear like a Weaver's needle probably
[1:19:56] 20 foot long the blade on it maybe four
[1:19:59] foot across
[1:20:00] and a little David stand there with a
[1:20:02] little piece of leather goat skin or
[1:20:04] sheepskin with two pieces of strain tied
[1:20:07] to it
[1:20:08] but it was revealed to him
[1:20:10] [Music]
[1:20:12] Revelation struck him
[1:20:14] hey man he said the god that took me out
[1:20:18] of the paws of the bear that took me out
[1:20:20] of the Paws Of The Line how much more
[1:20:23] will he deliver that uncircumcised
[1:20:24] Philistine in my hand
[1:20:27] his brothers way more able to do it Saul
[1:20:31] Head and Shoulders above his army but
[1:20:34] you see it wasn't revealed to them
[1:20:37] amen
[1:20:39] there it is
[1:20:42] they believed it could be done
[1:20:44] they believe that God could do it but it
[1:20:47] wasn't revealed to them
[1:20:49] but it was revealed to David
[1:20:52] now there's a difference right there if
[1:20:55] it's absolutely revealed to you
[1:20:58] that God is going to heal you you're
[1:21:00] going to get it
[1:21:02] you're going to get I don't care what's
[1:21:04] wrong with you what the odds it may be
[1:21:06] worse than David had gone
[1:21:09] but if it's revealed to you and notice
[1:21:11] revealed David
[1:21:17] he said that they are cut your Hill
[1:21:22] oh God by grace in that crucial moment
[1:21:29] when decisions had to be made
[1:21:32] let's save God that producer Grace in
[1:21:36] that day and drop that seed of faith in
[1:21:38] that little Hunchback looking boys
[1:21:40] being in his heart that same God in this
[1:21:43] crucial moment can take that woman from
[1:21:45] the wheel share that man
[1:21:47] that's how it hurts
[1:21:48] [Music]
[1:21:51] that little green of faith is revealed
[1:21:54] to you
[1:21:56] and I don't care how long it takes now
[1:21:59] notice they're Giant on the other side
[1:22:02] didn't believe it neither will the
[1:22:03] cancer
[1:22:05] he likes you said I'm a hot dog
[1:22:08] you send that kid out here to fight me
[1:22:10] so I'll pick you up on him a spear and
[1:22:11] let the birds eat your flesh
[1:22:13] why he had all the all everything for
[1:22:16] his side but you see that didn't Shake
[1:22:19] David at all
[1:22:21] why it was revealed to him he had faith
[1:22:24] in what he was doing he knowed he was
[1:22:26] going to do it
[1:22:28] and he did it
[1:22:30] is because that it was revealed to him
[1:22:32] and he knowed where he's standing
[1:22:35] and if God would respoke that right down
[1:22:37] in your hard time said you're not going
[1:22:39] to be laying in that bed you're not
[1:22:41] going to be sitting that chair you're
[1:22:44] going to be well there couldn't be
[1:22:46] anything change your mind in it
[1:22:48] but until that happens
[1:22:50] ever preaching a world could pray I
[1:22:53] don't say it wouldn't help you it
[1:22:54] wouldn't encourage you but until that
[1:22:57] faith
[1:22:58] see the healing power is in you
[1:23:02] it don't come from the preacher
[1:23:05] it comes to you by Revelation by faith
[1:23:09] not by power not by might but by my
[1:23:12] spirit saith the Lord my spirit by Grace
[1:23:16] reveals this to you and there's nothing
[1:23:19] to take it away
[1:23:21] by faith Revelation then David to prove
[1:23:26] his words now some of them said I know
[1:23:28] you're naughty his brother said you come
[1:23:30] up here to see the battle now you get on
[1:23:32] back where him sheep was he said let me
[1:23:34] speak to Saul The General
[1:23:37] and Saul said now son I admire your
[1:23:39] courage
[1:23:40] but you see you're nothing but a youth
[1:23:43] and he is a lawyer from his shoes you're
[1:23:44] no match for him said I was standing my
[1:23:48] father's sheep
[1:23:51] he could face it on something amen
[1:23:55] oh brother and the god that saves your
[1:23:59] soul can he heal your body
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:04] it's just the same reveal you he's your
[1:24:07] healer as you as your savior
[1:24:10] but it's got to be revealed
[1:24:13] that's the difference
[1:24:15] he had some of the bassist faith on
[1:24:18] how this never happened before but said
[1:24:20] the same God
[1:24:22] that deliver me from the paws of the
[1:24:24] lion will deliver me from that
[1:24:26] uncircumcised Philistine how you know
[1:24:28] David I believe it
[1:24:30] why it's been revealed to me
[1:24:33] and he said he knows what he was talking
[1:24:35] about because of the giant said I'm
[1:24:37] going to feed you to the birds he said
[1:24:38] I'm going to cut your head off
[1:24:41] there's a difference
[1:24:44] and he did it
[1:24:46] Samson
[1:24:48] caught out one day
[1:24:50] off guard in a prairie
[1:24:54] and yet come a thousand Philistines up
[1:24:57] on him
[1:24:58] and he looked down on the ground and
[1:24:59] there's where a Mueller died
[1:25:02] and he picked up the old draw Jawbone
[1:25:05] dry as it could be
[1:25:07] and took out after those felicities
[1:25:09] beating him over the head with this old
[1:25:12] dry
[1:25:13] Jawbone of a mule
[1:25:16] as far as I know not a twos never fell
[1:25:18] out of it
[1:25:19] and then Philistine helmets is probably
[1:25:21] inch thick because they beat one another
[1:25:23] water clubs in those days
[1:25:25] to keep a man from beating him on the
[1:25:27] head but he took the Jawbone of that you
[1:25:29] and beat down a thousandth listings
[1:25:34] and the Jawbone never broke
[1:25:36] you just kept beating him like that as
[1:25:38] you come up the rest of them took off
[1:25:39] for the rocks
[1:25:41] there's getting away from him wow
[1:25:43] he believes it sometimes sure I want to
[1:25:47] tell you something work on that
[1:25:49] pulsation
[1:25:50] that spare of a moment
[1:25:52] like Joshua did like Mary Magdalena
[1:25:55] although just that moment when something
[1:25:58] is revealed to you rabbit
[1:26:01] hold to it
[1:26:03] that's fair of a moment
[1:26:05] yes it was revealed to him
[1:26:07] he went to meet these thousands
[1:26:09] Philistines now what do you think when
[1:26:12] those three states said now look coming
[1:26:13] there that little shrimp only about four
[1:26:16] foot and a half tall to begin with with
[1:26:19] seven little curls hanging on his back
[1:26:20] like Mama's Little see come along
[1:26:23] there with a job order the mule and look
[1:26:25] at us
[1:26:26] what a great Army we are isn't that
[1:26:28] ridiculous but what was he doing he was
[1:26:31] expressing to those Philistines
[1:26:34] what have been revealed to him by God
[1:26:37] he grabbed the Jawbone and took off
[1:26:39] because that's what he put his hand
[1:26:42] he put that in his hand that's what he
[1:26:44] believed he could do it and by doing so
[1:26:46] he was expressing to those Philistines
[1:26:48] what God had put in his heart to do John
[1:26:52] the Baptist expressed his faith
[1:26:54] by is worse and when he said
[1:26:58] there stands one among you now
[1:27:03] just think of that
[1:27:06] St John's I got the Saint John 126.
[1:27:10] he said they said you say the messiah's
[1:27:13] coming
[1:27:13] why I said man what's the matter with
[1:27:15] you we've been looking for him for four
[1:27:17] thousand years he said he's standing
[1:27:19] right among you now
[1:27:24] so easy tonight
[1:27:26] hey man
[1:27:30] he expressed his faith by his Revelation
[1:27:34] because it was revealed to him and he
[1:27:36] knowed he would baptize the Messiah
[1:27:39] there's a man 30 years old he knowed he
[1:27:41] had to be there somewhere
[1:27:43] you never knew who he was and yeah I was
[1:27:46] standing right among them he said
[1:27:49] there's one staying among you now who
[1:27:51] you know not
[1:27:54] and I'm not worthy to lose the latches
[1:27:57] on his shoes but he'll baptize you with
[1:27:59] the Holy Ghost
[1:28:01] and he's right among you now
[1:28:04] he expressed it his faith because he
[1:28:07] known in his day he was to see and
[1:28:10] baptize God's Messiah
[1:28:14] so you see the people could see the
[1:28:17] expression upon him and the way he was
[1:28:19] preaching and the way he was acting was
[1:28:21] expressing that he had a true Revelation
[1:28:23] from God now to prove that it was true
[1:28:26] walking right out of the crowd come the
[1:28:29] Messiah
[1:28:30] just an ordinary young man walking down
[1:28:32] through there dressed like other man
[1:28:33] John said behold there's a Little Lamb
[1:28:36] of God that takes away The Sinner
[1:28:39] [Music]
[1:28:40] how do you know him he said he that said
[1:28:43] to me in the wilderness upon whom now
[1:28:45] shall see the spirit descending
[1:28:47] that's the one that'll baptize with the
[1:28:49] Holy Ghost
[1:28:50] he knew him because there was supposed
[1:28:53] to be a sign
[1:28:54] about that time
[1:28:56] are you catching it
[1:28:59] John knew just about the hour
[1:29:04] because he was a prophet it was revealed
[1:29:07] to him
[1:29:08] they didn't know it'd be about that time
[1:29:10] he'd see a sign and when he seen that
[1:29:12] sign he said he's standing upon you
[1:29:15] know it was there
[1:29:18] well I see the sign
[1:29:22] that the end time is here
[1:29:24] I see the things that's promised for
[1:29:27] this end time message coming to pass
[1:29:29] John folding just exactly like the
[1:29:31] scripture says
[1:29:32] and I know that the time is at hand
[1:29:38] uh say that without hesitance
[1:29:41] I believe it's right at hand
[1:29:46] where I see the signs that he said but
[1:29:48] happened just before that time
[1:29:50] it's ready to happen now John expressed
[1:29:53] his faith
[1:29:55] and what God had revealed to him
[1:29:57] therefore
[1:29:59] works is space testimony when they see
[1:30:03] you acting like you're healed then
[1:30:05] they'll know you got faith that you are
[1:30:06] healed
[1:30:08] first testimony say ing this ah I have
[1:30:13] it now
[1:30:17] because I have received God's promise
[1:30:20] it is now working in me
[1:30:23] I am making ready for it to happen
[1:30:26] see that's what your test your Works
[1:30:28] does
[1:30:28] well sure you're some time ago
[1:30:31] next to my last trip in Africa I was
[1:30:34] just over there this spring but trip
[1:30:36] before then there's a little uh baby it
[1:30:39] had club feet and one foot uh late
[1:30:41] shorter than the other it never wore
[1:30:43] shoes in its life or it's the most
[1:30:45] horrible to farm and I prayed for the
[1:30:47] baby that night they've watched and seen
[1:30:48] those things done they prayed for the
[1:30:50] baby and the next morning I went out and
[1:30:52] walked by a shoe store I walked in there
[1:30:54] and there was the man buying the baby a
[1:30:56] pair of shoes to wear
[1:31:00] he believed it
[1:31:03] like this man over here that believed
[1:31:06] that God would give you the baby
[1:31:08] sure you believe it's going to happen
[1:31:09] made ready for it
[1:31:11] I'm making ready although no physical
[1:31:13] results seen as yet but that didn't make
[1:31:15] a bit of difference he believed in like
[1:31:17] Abraham called anything contrary as
[1:31:20] though it was not sold there therefore
[1:31:23] if your intellectuals does tell you oh
[1:31:27] here's the Stinger now
[1:31:28] if your intellectuals does tell you that
[1:31:31] this is the truth God is the Healer of
[1:31:34] sickness your mind can witness that that
[1:31:36] is the truth
[1:31:38] but if there is not the betting ground
[1:31:41] in your heart
[1:31:43] Faith to fall in to express it it will
[1:31:47] not happen
[1:31:49] so much no matter how much is outside
[1:31:51] man can reason it with the scriptures
[1:31:53] and say it's right
[1:31:55] that still doesn't make it right
[1:31:57] how many takes the tapes
[1:32:00] did you get my sermon out long ago the
[1:32:03] anointed ones of the last days
[1:32:06] did you believe that
[1:32:07] amen see it said there will be
[1:32:09] Antichrist
[1:32:12] Antichrist would almost deceive the very
[1:32:15] elected if possible it can't because
[1:32:18] it's impossible they're elected see all
[1:32:21] right
[1:32:42] Revelation and that would just continue
[1:32:45] to grow in that faith in that you notice
[1:32:50] all of them had mockers and scoffers and
[1:32:52] trying to point to them but it was it
[1:32:55] was in there because it Faith stands
[1:32:57] alone
[1:32:58] it was revealed by God's word you love
[1:33:01] him tonight let's stand together and
[1:33:07] our Prophet told us to pray for
[1:33:08] revelation
[1:33:11] maybe you believe something just like he
[1:33:14] said at the end but ask God to prepare
[1:33:16] your heart
[1:33:18] get the ground prepared and give you the
[1:33:21] seed of Revelation that you know that
[1:33:24] now you can do the works that proves
[1:33:27] that that faith is there
[1:33:30] those chap Bauer heads musicians get
[1:33:32] come and

[1:33:37] go forward this evening

[1:33:55] the thing
