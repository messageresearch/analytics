[46:43] uh breathe I told him I needed to go to
[46:45] the hospital I told my
[46:51] husband on the way I told him to call
[46:54] the call Brother David her pastor
[47:01] so that he could pray for us for me on
[47:03] the
[47:08] way on the road which was a very long
[47:11] long road uh from my home to the
[47:17] hospital I sent messages to my family
[47:20] saying
[47:23] goodbye cuz I felt like it was the last
[47:27] last time that I was ever going to see
[47:28] him or talk to
[47:31] them and I remember my dad's face when I
[47:34] was leaving the
[47:38] house it's probably the hardest thing
[47:40] that you have to say uh by or hard for a
[47:44] parent to say to their
[47:55] daughter I'm going to try and cut it a
[47:57] little bit short cuz it's uh it's a
[47:59] little bit long and I'm feeling
[48:08] sentimental I think in total uh we had
[48:11] six visits to the
[48:14] ER
[48:25] um
[48:28] and if we visit I would tell the doctors
[48:30] I couldn't breathe my heart uh had heart
[48:33] palpitations and had a lot of trouble
[48:45] breathing my heart rate my heart uh
[48:48] beats would go from 30 beats per minute
[48:51] to 160 in a matter of minute
[48:55] seconds
[49:02] I didn't understand what was going on
[49:03] because to the doctors it was just
[49:08] anxiety and I never had
[49:18] anxiety and it went like that through
[49:20] the end of
[49:25] December
[49:31] for me every night it was difficult
[49:33] because I felt I wasn't going to wake up
[49:36] anymore every
[49:45] night at the end of December one of the
[49:47] last days in December we came to Brother
[49:50] David so that he would pray for
[49:55] us
[49:57] and that day God spoke to me from
[50:00] Brother David's uh voice he spoke to
[50:08] me that day uh God said things to me
[50:13] that I had never told Brother David
[50:15] questions I had in my mind that he was
[50:25] answering and it was answer after answer
[50:28] of things that I had been asking God all
[50:30] this time everything he was saying was
[50:33] an uh an answer to a question I
[50:45] had that day something
[50:50] happened I feel that day God revealed
[50:52] himself to
[50:55] me
[50:58] because years I had been coming to
[51:00] church
[51:02] and I just was doing it just
[51:05] to play the role I never felt Christian
[51:08] I was just coming to church to to
[51:11] follow on
[51:16] order I would just I would just come to
[51:18] church and a
[51:21] dress and I would go back home and I
[51:24] would put my pants back on
[51:29] and I'm not proud of what I'm telling
[51:32] you but I want you to know what God has
[51:34] done in my
[51:41] life because since that day December
[51:44] 27th till
[51:46] today I serve
[51:51] God that day when I went back home I
[51:54] threw away all my clothes
[51:58] and on my knees I asked
[52:03] forgiveness and I think that day I spent
[52:05] hours in the closet
[52:07] praying something that I never done in
[52:09] my
[52:12] life my mom would always take us to
[52:19] church me and my husband uh heard of the
[52:22] message from my mom but I didn't want
[52:24] anything to do with it
[52:35] and going back just a little bit God had
[52:37] already been calling calling on
[52:41] me and in July
[52:47] 2021 I I uh I something had uh had an
[52:51] intoxication in my system that was very
[52:53] severe in my body um feel
[52:57] I went to the
[52:58] hospital I spent the day
[53:00] there it was in
[53:09] Mexico and I'm sure now that that day I
[53:12] was going to
[53:16] die I promised God things that
[53:21] day and when I felt better I didn't I
[53:24] didn't keep my promises
[53:29] when all this happened with
[53:31] Co I came to a
[53:36] scripture I think it was Ecclesiastes
[53:42] 5 I'm going to read
[53:50] it Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes
[53:55] 5
[54:15] when I read this
[54:19] scripture I don't know how to explain it
[54:21] to you let me explain let me in
[54:23] Ecclesiastes 5 is's just talking about
[54:24] when you make when you make a vow to God
[54:28] uh defer not to pay it for the had no
[54:34] pleasure in in fools pay that which thou
[54:37] Hast vowed better is it that thou sh
[54:40] should us not vow then that thou
[54:44] shouldest vow and not
[54:54] pay when I let this scripture was
[54:56] something that just came through flashed
[54:58] through my mind really really
[55:03] quick how I felt the moment I was going
[55:06] to
[55:08] die how God took me out of that how you
[55:12] res
[55:24] me and now it feels great it's a
[55:26] pleasure to be here I want to serve God
[55:28] every day and and it's a joy to be here
[55:31] when I come
[55:37] now before I used to make a lot of
[55:40] excuses not to come to
[55:43] church and now that I want to be
[55:46] here the enemy puts a lot
[55:49] of for her not to
[55:55] come every
[55:57] Saturday something
[56:02] happens it's my husband it's our kids I
[56:04] get sick our babies I get sick every
[56:08] Saturday
[56:11] night and every Sunday morning we say
[56:13] we're
[56:18] going because I have to defeat the enemy
[56:21] one day he will leave
[56:23] us CU I have a promise
[56:26] and I believe in everything that the
[56:28] word
[56:31] says and I believe I'm
[56:36] Healed even in my body still going
[56:38] through some of the uh the struggles
[56:40] that it's been going
[56:42] through in the name of our Lord
[56:49] Jesus I was listening to brother
[56:51] Matthew's
[56:55] testimony and it touched my
[57:02] heart how a mother is always fighting
[57:05] and praying for her children her
[57:11] kids Matthew and my testimony is nothing
[57:14] like brother
[57:17] Matthews but by faith I know my kids
[57:20] will be at his feet one
[57:22] day because I have the same promise that
[57:24] he has that we all have
[57:38] in the time that I didn't serve God I
[57:40] was
[57:41] uh I was the cause
[57:44] of I was an obstacle in my mom's way I
[57:48] was always the cause of all her pain a
[57:51] lot of her
[57:55] pain
[58:00] not my father not my my brothers they
[58:02] don't
[58:10] believe and I always told them that they
[58:13] had a right and that they had a a good
[58:15] reason that it was my mom that was just
[58:17] being
[58:18] religious
[58:21] yeah and now that I have the
[58:23] Revelation I asked my mom for for for
[58:30] forgiveness and I know that with my
[58:32] example my brothers will come too too
[58:35] not because of me but by the grace of
[58:40] God now my
[58:42] sister God my sister's heart and she has
[58:46] same the same desire
[58:55] deserve
[59:01] I always thought that just because I
[59:03] didn't go out I didn't drink I didn't go
[59:05] out and have a great time like everybody
[59:06] I thought I was right because I didn't
[59:08] do all
[59:10] that but now I know that it's not the
[59:16] case forgive me that I'm just uh time
[59:19] jumping from one time to another
[59:23] time but I don't have my notes thank you
[59:25] Pastor
[59:34] [Music]
[59:36] in the time that I was
[59:38] really I would ask
[59:44] God why people why were other people
[59:48] healthy and why do they have everything
[59:49] and they don't even serve him and they
[59:51] were enjoying
[59:54] life and a voice told told me because
[59:57] you're
[59:58] mine cuz you're one of
[1:00:06] mine and because I'm molding
[1:00:09] you in my in the way that I want to mold
[1:00:15] you and I give all the glory and all the
[1:00:17] honor to God because of what he's doing
[1:00:19] to
[1:00:24] me
[1:00:32] and now my uh family members tell me
[1:00:34] that I look a lot better because I
[1:00:36] looked really I was in real bad shape
[1:00:39] and and physically and and and
[1:00:41] emotionally I was unstable at at that
[1:00:47] time my response to them always is
[1:00:52] is glory to God cuz now I'm a lot better
[1:00:55] than I was before
[1:00:58] because I serve a living
[1:01:00] God a god of
[1:01:03] power who takes care of me and my
[1:01:07] family and it doesn't matter what the
[1:01:09] enemy wants to
[1:01:11] do we're in his hands and he's in
[1:01:18] control I always wanted to come up here
[1:01:21] so that they would pray for
[1:01:24] me
[1:01:26] now I know I have the power to do it
[1:01:28] myself and declare that I am
[1:01:32] healed thank
[1:01:34] [Applause]
[1:01:42] you I if I could say something um we
[1:01:46] always we almost didn't come in I had a
[1:01:48] real bad toothache a horrible too th uh
[1:01:51] earlier like two hours
[1:01:52] ago
[1:01:54] and all of a sudden like within between
[1:01:57] the service in the morning and now it
[1:01:59] just it went away we know why now I
[1:02:03] didn't even know so but we know why it's
[1:02:05] because we serve a great God that's
[1:02:17] right you know you might not understand
[1:02:20] why that I I thought my
[1:02:23] heart you know the best testimony is the
[1:02:26] one you don't prepare to give amen you
[1:02:30] know because it's
[1:02:32] alive and it's real and we have that
[1:02:35] kind of
[1:02:36] God that can speak and tell you the
[1:02:42] secrets of your heart and you might
[1:02:45] speak to a lot of people and you're just
[1:02:48] saying what God's telling you to
[1:02:50] say I I'm in fact I I even
[1:02:57] uh not knowing why I I went into this uh
[1:03:04] the see if I can find it because I just
[1:03:08] I underlined
[1:03:10] it uh earlier and and
[1:03:17] uh I don't know if I I have it in here
[1:03:19] or not but anyway maybe it was just for
[1:03:22] me uh personally but uh
[1:03:27] uh the prophet of God talks about how
[1:03:30] that how you can discern what somebody's
[1:03:34] in somebody's heart and he
[1:03:37] said how because it's a thought and God
[1:03:42] had to have that
[1:03:43] thought in order to discern it and he
[1:03:47] said so it wasn't me he said it was God
[1:03:50] and and and that's what is beautiful and
[1:03:55] I I just like to share a
[1:03:57] little uh something because I think it
[1:04:00] goes so well with our our sister's
[1:04:05] testimony and what I I'd like to call it
[1:04:10] is is the
[1:04:13] necessity of uh let me see if I I
[1:04:17] brought it maybe I didn't that's the
[1:04:18] reason I don't have it on my desk in
[1:04:22] there if would you go there's a a book
[1:04:24] in there called proving his word I I
[1:04:27] didn't pick it up when I came out but
[1:04:31] it's what that I want to
[1:04:34] uh just to speak out of a little bit
[1:04:38] this evening is the
[1:04:40] necessity of
[1:04:43] predestination and uh and uh or I could
[1:04:47] also call it
[1:04:50] um uh the
[1:04:53] Lamb's uh book Book of Life and see if
[1:04:57] this is the right one
[1:05:00] here okay page
[1:05:05] paragraph see if I have it
[1:05:18] here which what year is this no it's the
[1:05:22] other proving his
[1:05:24] word I'll get it it right you just keep
[1:05:28] going on
[1:05:29] right I should preach
[1:05:33] perseverance all right there's another
[1:05:35] one in there he'll bring that one and
[1:05:37] then I can
[1:05:39] get uh started I hope all
[1:05:53] right all right let's try this
[1:06:01] one
[1:06:07] okay
[1:06:09] ah here you
[1:06:16] go three is the completion right so
[1:06:20] everything's everything's good
[1:06:23] everything's good we
[1:06:26] uh we talked this this morning about
[1:06:30] uh uh about the word of God and the
[1:06:34] importance of the word of God and a as
[1:06:39] we as we talked about it
[1:06:43] um
[1:06:45] um we realize the and again we're
[1:06:49] talking about the necessity of
[1:06:53] predestination or or or we could say
[1:06:57] another way we could say why the Lamb's
[1:07:01] Book of
[1:07:02] Life and everything that God does he has
[1:07:07] a purpose in doing it he has a reason of
[1:07:12] doing
[1:07:13] it
[1:07:15] and the what he
[1:07:20] is obligates him to do things certain
[1:07:24] ways and I I hope that my
[1:07:27] vocabulary can express that to you uh
[1:07:33] when he made a
[1:07:35] law he was obligated to place a
[1:07:41] punishment upon the breaking of that law
[1:07:45] because it wouldn't be a
[1:07:47] law if if it stayed in
[1:07:51] that a place if it didn't have a
[1:07:54] punishment then it it wouldn't be a law
[1:07:58] because there there would be not nothing
[1:08:01] to enforce it so there would have to be
[1:08:04] an
[1:08:05] enforcement to the law and that lets you
[1:08:09] know
[1:08:10] how crazy our society's gotten that in
[1:08:15] some places if you steal under $800
[1:08:19] worth of merchandise they don't even
[1:08:22] prosecute it so what you're saying is
[1:08:25] Everybody's Free to steal
[1:08:29] $800 well that's not what God says God
[1:08:35] said Thou shalt not steal and there
[1:08:38] there was a a penalty uh to the law so
[1:08:45] God's word obligates him he's obligated
[1:08:49] to what that he speaks and he only
[1:08:53] speaks that which reflects
[1:08:56] himself he can't speak something that's
[1:08:59] not him that would be deception that
[1:09:03] would be deceiving and there's one thing
[1:09:06] that God cannot do and that God can't
[1:09:09] lie so when God says something you know
[1:09:13] that he's got to see it through all the
[1:09:17] way till the end and we read that this
[1:09:21] morning right that his very words will
[1:09:24] show up judgment and that's what he was
[1:09:27] telling the people hey heavens and earth
[1:09:30] is going to pass away but my word is not
[1:09:33] going to pass away in fact what I'm
[1:09:36] telling you now is what is going to
[1:09:40] judge you when you get there I don't
[1:09:43] come to judge any man Jesus is saying
[1:09:47] they like that part of them he said but
[1:09:50] I've come to save you amen but he saves
[1:09:53] Us by giving us his word
[1:09:56] and he went further in saving us knowing
[1:10:00] that the law demanded a
[1:10:03] recompense uh for all that would break
[1:10:07] it and not hold it true he kept that rep
[1:10:11] recompense for us in other words he paid
[1:10:14] the price of the law so of all the law
[1:10:18] that we have broken he did the prison
[1:10:21] time amen he did he did he took the
[1:10:25] the the penalty and the penalty of sin
[1:10:29] was what death and that's what he did he
[1:10:33] paid the death and it couldn't just be
[1:10:36] uh it had to be a a a peer offering and
[1:10:41] so it a good payment is one without sin
[1:10:46] if it if if I would die for your sins
[1:10:49] and I had sins then I really wasn't
[1:10:52] dying for yours I was dying for mine but
[1:10:55] but if I had no sin and I was righteous
[1:10:59] and there was no cause for my death then
[1:11:02] I could apply my debt you know what I
[1:11:05] mean it's like in a debt if if if if
[1:11:09] there's a a home for sale for example
[1:11:12] and and and the people that built the
[1:11:14] home they filed a lean against it and
[1:11:17] and everybody says they owe me this they
[1:11:19] owe me that they owe me this well when
[1:11:22] that house is sold they take that money
[1:11:25] and and they divide it up on all those
[1:11:28] leans sometimes there's not enough money
[1:11:30] there and what they'll do is they'll
[1:11:32] settle we'll settle for 50 cents on the
[1:11:36] do dollar we'll settle for 75 cent just
[1:11:39] give me 75 cents of every dollar that
[1:11:42] you owe me and I'll sign off on the lean
[1:11:45] there there's a settlement involved
[1:11:48] because there was there was something
[1:11:50] owed so if if I was to give my life and
[1:11:54] I had sin then part of my life if you
[1:11:57] could express what I'm saying would have
[1:11:59] to go to that debt but he didn't have
[1:12:03] any
[1:12:04] debt so he could take his life which was
[1:12:09] righteous life a life that he didn't
[1:12:12] have to lay down because there was no
[1:12:15] death in
[1:12:17] him nobody could take his life he says
[1:12:20] they don't take my life I Lay My Life
[1:12:23] down for my own
[1:12:25] so he laid his life down and paid the
[1:12:29] debt and and so when you begin to think
[1:12:32] of what is the importance of
[1:12:35] predestination you have to understand
[1:12:38] that God's nature and what that he
[1:12:43] was caused him to have to
[1:12:49] predestinate you understand why because
[1:12:54] he couldn't
[1:12:55] mix with anything that wasn't his
[1:13:00] word because if he mixed it it wouldn't
[1:13:04] be
[1:13:05] pure if it was mixed with anything other
[1:13:09] than word word and word brings forth
[1:13:13] word word and anything else brings forth
[1:13:17] death it won't last we call it in the in
[1:13:21] in in The Parables leav a little Le leth
[1:13:26] the whole lump in other words it it
[1:13:30] won't be the same with even a little
[1:13:33] leaven that's why it had to be
[1:13:35] unleavened bread it couldn't have
[1:13:37] anything mixed in it and we understand
[1:13:40] that's the type of the word of God it
[1:13:43] can't have anything mixed in it so God's
[1:13:46] word couldn't
[1:13:49] mix with anything else except
[1:13:53] word so if if he and so in order for him
[1:13:58] to
[1:14:00] mix or or join himself together he had
[1:14:05] to have something that was
[1:14:09] him to mix with or that was word to mix
[1:14:14] with therefore he had to predestinate
[1:14:18] you before the foundation of the world
[1:14:23] he had to put your name and who you were
[1:14:27] because he saw you then before there
[1:14:30] ever was a star before there ever was a
[1:14:33] moon before there ever was in anything
[1:14:35] you were with him in the beginning you
[1:14:38] were part of the word of God and so if
[1:14:42] you ever were going to have eternal life
[1:14:45] you always had eternal life because he
[1:14:49] couldn't he he couldn't uh he couldn't
[1:14:53] mix or bring forth life with anything
[1:14:57] else other than life so that's why when
[1:15:01] we understand our
[1:15:03] predestination we understand why it had
[1:15:05] to be
[1:15:06] predestination we we knew that because
[1:15:09] of the Fall that we came the way that we
[1:15:12] came and he allowed that because he
[1:15:15] wanted to express his attributes but he
[1:15:18] he he always knew that we were a part of
[1:15:21] him in the beginning we were only part
[1:15:25] of him maybe in his
[1:15:28] thinking you understand but because we
[1:15:31] were there in his thinking he could put
[1:15:34] us on the Lamb's Book of Life and so now
[1:15:38] he's got something that he's going to
[1:15:41] unite himself with that he's going to
[1:15:44] manifest himself in that he's going to
[1:15:48] bring forth his life in that and that so
[1:15:52] he he couldn't just if he just kept his
[1:15:55] life then it would never been shared but
[1:15:59] the very attribute of Love is sharing so
[1:16:04] he wanted to share it he wanted to
[1:16:06] express it he wanted to have preeminence
[1:16:10] and he wanted to bring his children back
[1:16:12] to where they were in the beginning and
[1:16:15] the only thing that could do that was
[1:16:18] was his word and so his word couldn't
[1:16:22] mix with anything another words we he
[1:16:24] could couldn't have mixed with us the
[1:16:26] way that we
[1:16:27] were even if he paid the price for
[1:16:31] us since we were born in sin shaped in
[1:16:35] iniquity we were hybrid to begin with we
[1:16:40] came into the world speaking lies our
[1:16:43] righteousness is as filthy rags there
[1:16:46] still wouldn't have been anything that
[1:16:48] he could join to unite with and produ
[1:16:56] with and that's what that's what he says
[1:16:59] as far as reproducing himself he
[1:17:03] couldn't reproduce himself so when when
[1:17:06] when Eve when she was by her the prophet
[1:17:10] of God said by her seed she brought
[1:17:13] forth Twins and we know that there was
[1:17:17] death in that but he doesn't bring forth
[1:17:21] death he brings forth
[1:17:23] life so in order for him to bring forth
[1:17:26] life there had to be something of him
[1:17:30] there the word because the word
[1:17:34] only joins and
[1:17:37] unites and and uh uses the word uh breed
[1:17:43] or brings or or reproduces it can only
[1:17:47] reproduce with word it can't reproduce
[1:17:50] with something that's not
[1:17:52] word so we were born in C shape and
[1:17:55] iniquities he couldn't he couldn't
[1:17:58] reproduce with that he now he could come
[1:18:01] pay the price for
[1:18:04] it but that would just pay the
[1:18:07] debt it wouldn't change what we
[1:18:12] were so we have to be borned
[1:18:16] again but if you don't have life in
[1:18:21] you you understand if you don't have
[1:18:24] that seed in you then there's nothing
[1:18:28] there to to be
[1:18:30] birthed and a birth takes two parts we
[1:18:34] know
[1:18:35] that so it there had to be something
[1:18:40] that he put there
[1:18:42] amen that he and he uses the word and
[1:18:46] and he me makes mention many times of
[1:18:49] this message I hope some of you were
[1:18:50] inspired enough to start going back and
[1:18:53] reading he says that to impregnate or to
[1:18:57] unite with so he had to place
[1:19:04] there what he was going to unite with
[1:19:09] because it had to come from him in order
[1:19:12] to be him it it couldn't come from any
[1:19:16] place else it had to come from it's
[1:19:19] original Source because the spoken word
[1:19:23] is the or Original Seed and every seed
[1:19:28] that was ever planted came from God's
[1:19:33] word is that right you understand that
[1:19:37] when he said let there be let there be
[1:19:39] let this be let be all that was original
[1:19:43] and it could produce after its own
[1:19:46] kind but the minute Another
[1:19:50] Kind came
[1:19:53] in right
[1:19:56] then there was
[1:19:58] death so he couldn't mix with anything
[1:20:02] so he had to
[1:20:04] predestinate and supply of seed in
[1:20:09] you that he could Unite with in order to
[1:20:14] reproduce himself and so like if we were
[1:20:17] to read in
[1:20:19] Luke uh the I think it's the uh eth
[1:20:23] chapter of Luke
[1:20:28] again starting at the fourth verse of
[1:20:31] the eth chapter of
[1:20:34] Luke it says and when much people were
[1:20:38] gathered together and come to him out of
[1:20:42] every city he spake by a
[1:20:46] parable now we remember when we read
[1:20:49] over I believe it was in Matthew he said
[1:20:53] in all these things Jesus Jesus spake
[1:20:55] unto the multitude in Parables and
[1:20:58] without a parable spake he not unto them
[1:21:01] that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:21:03] spoken by the prophet saying I will open
[1:21:07] my mouth in Parables I will utter things
[1:21:10] which have been kept secret from the
[1:21:13] foundation of the world now he is going
[1:21:17] to preach now in this Luke he's
[1:21:21] preaching the revelation of pred
[1:21:24] destination amen yes they might not
[1:21:28] understand it you understand because we
[1:21:31] know that it's going to be sealed up
[1:21:34] until the last day but it was still him
[1:21:37] that preached it because the word of
[1:21:40] God's Eternal so he's going to preach it
[1:21:43] right now he says so a multitude come
[1:21:45] together and he spake by a parable a s
[1:21:48] went out sowing his seed and he sowed
[1:21:53] and some fell by
[1:21:57] the by the wayside and was trotten down
[1:22:01] and the fowls of the air devoured it and
[1:22:05] some fell on the rocks and as soon as it
[1:22:08] sprung up it withered away because it
[1:22:12] lacked moisture some among the thorns
[1:22:15] and thistles sprang up with it and
[1:22:18] choked it and others fell on good ground
[1:22:20] and sprang up and bear forth fruit H
[1:22:23] hundredfold and and when he said these
[1:22:25] things he cried he that hath a ear to
[1:22:29] hear Let Him hear
[1:22:31] hallelujah amen amen you know how you
[1:22:35] say well how do I know I have to hear
[1:22:36] the ear the ear is revelation that's
[1:22:39] right that's right anybody can hear the
[1:22:43] word but the ear of the spirit is
[1:22:48] revelation and then the disciples you
[1:22:50] know is you as as they come the
[1:22:53] disciples ask him saying what might this
[1:22:57] Parable be and he said unto
[1:23:00] them unto you it is given to know the
[1:23:03] mysteries of the kingdom of God but to
[1:23:06] others in Parables that they seen they
[1:23:10] might not see and hearing that they
[1:23:13] might not understand now the parable is
[1:23:18] this the seed is the
[1:23:21] word of God
[1:23:25] so every seed is a word of God so when
[1:23:30] when we talk
[1:23:31] about the
[1:23:33] seed being in you the seed that's being
[1:23:37] in you if you can understand that's the
[1:23:40] word of God that's in you
[1:23:45] yes oh I just thought our sister's
[1:23:47] testimony was
[1:23:49] beautiful it was in her amen and and she
[1:23:54] said
[1:23:55] and and I almost come out of my
[1:23:58] seat cuz she said I I was there and God
[1:24:02] spoke to me that I was his and that's
[1:24:06] what the prophet of God says he says
[1:24:08] when the rug rugged original word seed
[1:24:12] speaks to your heart and says your mine
[1:24:16] why because that seed is his he planted
[1:24:20] it it was his seed he owned that seed
[1:24:23] and that's seed was his word so what
[1:24:26] that he placed in your heart is the word
[1:24:29] of God the word of God was in there in
[1:24:31] the beginning another there was a
[1:24:34] thought expressed in you from the
[1:24:40] beginning
[1:24:41] oh that's what's going to come
[1:24:45] alive that's what's got to that's what's
[1:24:48] got to to come forth and bring forth and
[1:24:53] and spring up
[1:24:55] in us
[1:24:57] and you see if I have
[1:25:02] that I want to read it just
[1:25:05] right right here
[1:25:09] uh he says now what he says he says now
[1:25:14] what is the seed of
[1:25:16] life the word of God Amen therefore for
[1:25:21] life you can't come through through a
[1:25:28] Creed you can't come through a
[1:25:31] denomination you've got to come back to
[1:25:34] the word now the seed of life he said
[1:25:39] all right his word is his seed and his
[1:25:43] spirit is the water you see what did
[1:25:48] they what did they die from lack of
[1:25:53] moisture so his
[1:25:55] seed his word is his seed and the spirit
[1:26:00] is the water now right back to John
[1:26:05] 13:14 there you get it again you see the
[1:26:09] spirit is the water John 13:14 we
[1:26:13] understand what it means if you want to
[1:26:16] read it and he talked about Moses
[1:26:18] lifting up the blast cir we'll go into
[1:26:21] that later but the the seed is
[1:26:25] the word of God so that word of God that
[1:26:27] had to be in you and so we know that the
[1:26:31] that a lot of people this question Rises
[1:26:34] up uh is uh about the word that the
[1:26:39] letter
[1:26:40] kth but the spirit giveth
[1:26:43] life that's 2 Corinthians 3 and 6 let's
[1:26:48] just read that for uh a a moment as we
[1:26:52] just uh talk about these one wonderful
[1:26:54] things of the Lord and
[1:27:00] uh so second Corinthians 3 and and six
[1:27:05] he says Paul speaking
[1:27:10] here uh he says and such trust have we
[1:27:15] through Christ to God word not that we
[1:27:19] are sufficient of ourselves to think
[1:27:22] anything of our our El but our
[1:27:26] sufficiency is of God Amen who also hath
[1:27:30] made us able Ministers of the New
[1:27:35] Testament not of the letter but of the
[1:27:39] spirit for the letter kth but the spirit
[1:27:43] giveth life and so what is the spirit of
[1:27:49] the word
[1:27:51] amen now we've
[1:27:54] drifted so
[1:27:57] far sometimes in our
[1:27:59] carnality that we relate the spirit with
[1:28:03] things Untouchable and and unseen so uh
[1:28:09] spiritual things are are not thing seen
[1:28:12] or uh they're only
[1:28:15] felt you understand so you you you
[1:28:19] people feel that you know the word
[1:28:22] intellectually but you feel the the
[1:28:24] spirit but that's not the spirit of the
[1:28:29] word the spirit of a word when it's the
[1:28:33] spirit of something it's what the
[1:28:37] intention and purpose of it
[1:28:40] was that's right if you were to be in a
[1:28:44] great legal
[1:28:47] battle and they would start to bring
[1:28:49] forth the
[1:28:51] law and one attorney might
[1:28:54] he might speak the law and he'll say
[1:28:59] well this is what the law was saying
[1:29:02] this was the
[1:29:04] intention of the law this is what why
[1:29:08] the law was written and the other exper
[1:29:12] attorney would
[1:29:14] argue that no that's not what the
[1:29:21] intention of the law was that's not what
[1:29:25] the
[1:29:27] rule of the law was written for and they
[1:29:30] would try to to to to find out what what
[1:29:35] was the spirit of the law what was the
[1:29:38] purpose of the law we have a whole
[1:29:41] Supreme
[1:29:43] Court which are supposed to be great ET
[1:29:46] uh attorneys and great legal minds and
[1:29:51] their job is to judge the Spirit of the
[1:29:56] Constitution what was the intention of
[1:29:59] our fathers that's right
[1:30:01] Hallelujah well we have the judge the
[1:30:04] jury and everything in the Lord Jesus
[1:30:08] right he says I have not come to do away
[1:30:11] with the law but I have come to fulfill
[1:30:14] the law I have come to present the
[1:30:18] spirit of the law what the law was
[1:30:21] intended to do the law was intended to
[1:30:26] make the love of God shed abroad in Your
[1:30:28] Heart by the Holy Spirit but because you
[1:30:31] were born in sin shaped in iniquity came
[1:30:35] in the world speaking lies and you are
[1:30:37] full of Deceit I had to govern
[1:30:44] that I had to bind
[1:30:47] you by the
[1:30:49] law I had to put rules on you
[1:30:55] to keep this hybrid person that you are
[1:31:00] in
[1:31:01] check but when you're born
[1:31:04] again and you're born again when the
[1:31:07] seed that was in you is impregnated by
[1:31:11] the word of God and now you receive and
[1:31:15] the intentions of the word of God does
[1:31:17] the new
[1:31:18] birth have an experience yes you heard
[1:31:22] it testified of of
[1:31:25] tonight something changed I was born
[1:31:29] again God dealt with me I received the
[1:31:33] holy
[1:31:34] spirit amen I went into my
[1:31:39] closet I had a a sister that had
[1:31:42] accepted the word of the Lord and and
[1:31:45] God moved on her heart she went home and
[1:31:49] and I don't know if any of you are old
[1:31:53] enough to remember but they used to have
[1:31:55] stereo
[1:31:57] cabinets like this they'd have the TV in
[1:32:00] it in the middle and a record player on
[1:32:03] one side and and then you had these
[1:32:05] little sliding drawers on the other and
[1:32:07] it was uh the whole thing was in a
[1:32:11] cabinet and they were heavy and she got
[1:32:15] in the spirit and and the spirit moved
[1:32:18] upon her that that was the
[1:32:21] devil and she knew this is where her
[1:32:24] problem was it was these soap operas and
[1:32:27] all this stuff and and and she found
[1:32:29] herself where she just had to go and see
[1:32:32] what they were going to do you know they
[1:32:33] always leave you hanging with a
[1:32:38] carrot who's going to cheat on who and
[1:32:40] who's going to find out the LIE who's
[1:32:43] that that the prophet of God said he
[1:32:45] said the church is reading too many
[1:32:46] romance
[1:32:50] books I think today you'd say the church
[1:32:53] is playing too many
[1:32:56] games she took that
[1:33:00] thing she picked it
[1:33:03] up and she carried her
[1:33:06] out and she threw it out in the front
[1:33:10] yard and when her husband came home he
[1:33:13] wanted to know how in the world did that
[1:33:16] thing get in the front
[1:33:20] yard she got in the spirit
[1:33:25] of the
[1:33:26] word she got in the purpose of the word
[1:33:30] the intention of the word what it was
[1:33:32] written
[1:33:33] for that's why they can fall on the
[1:33:39] unjust but it falls on the
[1:33:42] just it falls on the just it falls on on
[1:33:47] the spirit in other words the intention
[1:33:50] and the purpose of what's been spoken is
[1:33:54] predestinated to fall on somebody that
[1:33:58] that intention of the word might be
[1:34:02] manifested in the
[1:34:04] flesh that's right you can't do
[1:34:10] it uhuh not by
[1:34:14] will not by strength not by might but by
[1:34:19] the spirit of the Lord but by my spirit
[1:34:24] sayeth the Lord by my
[1:34:27] intention that's why you know when that
[1:34:30] rugged word of God speaks out and he
[1:34:32] says that you are mine what's he doing
[1:34:36] he's taking possession of the seed that
[1:34:40] he put there he says now is the time
[1:34:44] that the seed that I planteth bringeth
[1:34:47] forth of its kind
[1:34:50] Hallelujah you would have never brought
[1:34:52] it forth
[1:34:54] it had to be there it had to be
[1:34:57] predestinated cuz it could only come
[1:35:00] forth after its kind so if it wasn't
[1:35:04] planted in the
[1:35:06] beginning when he spoke every
[1:35:10] seed it would never come up because
[1:35:13] there was nothing else anywhere to
[1:35:15] produce it because everything was
[1:35:21] hybrid and that's why he said it had to
[1:35:24] be
[1:35:26] watered the spirit the intention of the
[1:35:30] word is watered by him revealing it to
[1:35:34] us what the great intention was so why
[1:35:40] predestination cuz he had to have
[1:35:44] something that was him or of him or from
[1:35:49] him in the beginning to bring to life
[1:35:55] now I know in some of us that seed's
[1:35:58] lying in a bunch of rotten
[1:36:02] stuff but God will do anything that it
[1:36:08] takes anything that it
[1:36:11] takes that seed was in a woman at the
[1:36:14] well her condition
[1:36:18] was just
[1:36:21] terrible she was an outcast she had to
[1:36:24] come to the well by herself it the the
[1:36:28] every situation was bad it seemed
[1:36:32] hopeless beyond the comprehension of
[1:36:35] Hope but the scripture says I have need
[1:36:38] to go by there that's
[1:36:41] right he knew what he was waiting for he
[1:36:44] knew what he was sitting he knew that he
[1:36:47] was going to speak to her and that there
[1:36:50] was something in her that was going to
[1:36:53] come to
[1:36:56] life when you measure
[1:36:59] yourself remember God works from the
[1:37:02] inside
[1:37:06] out there may be things in your life but
[1:37:09] you'll find out you hate those things
[1:37:12] but you can't get away from that part
[1:37:14] inside of you that says I know this is
[1:37:17] truth and that's what she said we have
[1:37:20] been told when the Messiah comes
[1:37:24] he'll do these
[1:37:26] things oh my you can read all the
[1:37:29] scriptures very few places did he ever
[1:37:31] say I am he but he said I am he to her
[1:37:35] I'm he you found life I have water water
[1:37:40] amen that you know not of I have living
[1:37:44] water and if you drink this water you
[1:37:46] will never thirst that's the spirit of
[1:37:49] God you'll never thirst you'll never
[1:37:52] hunger yes
[1:37:54] thank because you're
[1:37:56] full God's revealing to you his
[1:37:59] intention he's revealing to you his
[1:38:02] purpose he's revealing to your election
[1:38:05] he's revealing to you why he put you
[1:38:07] here in this age and what the reason for
[1:38:11] it
[1:38:13] is he just sowed the
[1:38:17] seed he knew where it was going he knew
[1:38:20] it'd be good ground but what did he say
[1:38:22] is I'm the
[1:38:27] husbandry I I'll dig you
[1:38:30] up I'll dung your roots I'll prune you
[1:38:35] I'll Water you I'll make you fruitful CU
[1:38:39] every tree that's not fruitful every
[1:38:41] tree that's Barren will be chopped down
[1:38:45] cast
[1:38:48] down it's got to be his
[1:38:51] fruit and it couldn't be his fruit
[1:38:55] without
[1:39:23] trying to and that's what we're fighting
[1:39:25] is wickedness in high places and what's
[1:39:29] his whole purpose is to discredit the
[1:39:31] word not discredit the teachings of
[1:39:35] Jesus they teach them all
[1:39:38] over that's not what he's trying to
[1:39:41] discredit he's trying to discredit the
[1:39:44] Eternal seed word that's in you that's
[1:39:48] what he doesn't want you to touch that's
[1:39:50] what he doesn't want to come alive
[1:39:53] that's why he'll he'll twist your mind
[1:39:55] and the battles in the mind but he gave
[1:39:58] us the best weapon and that's his
[1:40:04] word that's what speaks to your
[1:40:07] heart that's why it's
[1:40:11] important to get alone with
[1:40:16] God and read the word of God you're not
[1:40:19] reading it to study it because that's
[1:40:22] why he said the the letter
[1:40:24] kills so if you take the
[1:40:28] word without the
[1:40:31] intention and purpose for which the word
[1:40:35] was given then that very word becomes an
[1:40:39] instrument of
[1:40:44] death how many people try to take this
[1:40:47] Bible and prove the
[1:40:51] Trinity it's the mark of the beast
[1:40:56] you know who else took the
[1:40:59] word
[1:41:01] Satan he said it is written it is
[1:41:04] written it is written but what did Jesus
[1:41:08] know he says that wasn't the intention
[1:41:11] why it was written he didn't write it
[1:41:14] for that purpose he didn't write it for
[1:41:16] that reason he didn't speak it for that
[1:41:18] reason that wasn't the spirit of it when
[1:41:21] he spoke it he says to you I only tell
[1:41:24] them in Parables that seeing they don't
[1:41:27] see and hearing they don't understand
[1:41:29] but to you is given the Kingdom of
[1:41:32] Heaven to you is given the spirit of the
[1:41:35] word the intention of the word the
[1:41:38] revelation of God's word that's why the
[1:41:40] church is built on
[1:41:45] Revelation his
[1:41:47] reason what do you think he shared with
[1:41:49] us in this
[1:41:51] day the mighty angel
[1:41:53] put his foot on land and sea and opens
[1:41:56] the
[1:41:57] book and reads the book The Book of
[1:42:01] Life and reveals all the intentions and
[1:42:05] all the purposes of God's word things
[1:42:07] that were uttered that never were
[1:42:12] spoken that we might be able to rise up
[1:42:16] and say
[1:42:18] wow I never did
[1:42:21] anything he's only un ning with himself
[1:42:25] that's
[1:42:27] right he's he's joining himself back to
[1:42:30] what was was in me that he put in me
[1:42:34] it's an invisible Union between the
[1:42:36] Earthly bride there she was in seed
[1:42:41] form and then he begins to unite himself
[1:42:44] with that and and we stand in a of
[1:42:51] ourselves we know that there that this
[1:42:54] wretched flesh is encapsulating
[1:42:57] something that's growing up within
[1:43:02] us and we can't deny
[1:43:06] it our flesh cries for one thing because
[1:43:09] the flesh Warth against the spirit but
[1:43:11] our spirit cries for righteousness and
[1:43:18] Truth oh we we sit back and I I ask
[1:43:22] what's going to
[1:43:25] win and then he speaks these great words
[1:43:29] if I start a work in you I will finish
[1:43:31] it till the end nothing can pluck you
[1:43:34] out of the palm of my hand my sheep know
[1:43:36] my voice and another they will not
[1:43:39] follow that's right amen thank you Jesus
[1:43:43] you actually see something growing in
[1:43:48] you many times I stood back and I say
[1:43:51] why did it take me so long
[1:43:54] I just hear something Echo back in me
[1:43:56] you wouldn't
[1:44:01] listen how many times do I have to learn
[1:44:04] this lesson until it comes to
[1:44:10] pass cuz he won't
[1:44:16] quit try to
[1:44:20] quit you don't even want to try to quit
[1:44:24] there was
[1:44:27] Paul one that he
[1:44:30] created to be the church age messenger
[1:44:33] and bring his gospel to the
[1:44:36] Gentiles and he's absolutely out there
[1:44:39] and imprisoning them and putting him in
[1:44:40] the
[1:44:42] death stood witness to
[1:44:48] it now tell me that isn't a
[1:44:52] paradox why would he allow such a
[1:44:56] thing why would he allow it to be in the
[1:44:59] woman in the
[1:45:00] well why would he allow it to be in the
[1:45:03] man that was possessed with
[1:45:05] demons that would rise up and Nash on
[1:45:09] people and lose his temper and just be
[1:45:11] angry and Shout out and and be
[1:45:14] uncontrollable why to show that he can
[1:45:17] do anything and will do anything to save
[1:45:21] his elect
[1:45:24] that's
[1:45:28] nothing I know he reached his hand down
[1:45:31] in the pits of
[1:45:33] hell but he speaks it in Romans I
[1:45:36] believe it's in Romans 8 he says Jacob
[1:45:39] and Esau hallelujah
[1:45:42] amen he said Jacob I loved and Esau I
[1:45:45] hated the children having done neither
[1:45:48] good nor evil but that the law of
[1:45:51] election might
[1:45:54] stand
[1:45:56] hallelujah oh that makes my heart
[1:45:59] beat it makes me happy makes me happy
[1:46:03] when someone stands up I used to do this
[1:46:05] and I used to do
[1:46:07] that you don't have to go into
[1:46:10] detail but something
[1:46:13] happened the word spoke to my
[1:46:21] heart
[1:46:27] and I was
[1:46:29] changed I was borned again a new
[1:46:34] creature
[1:46:38] arose oh I used to go home
[1:46:41] and come to church in a dress and go
[1:46:44] home and put on my
[1:46:46] pant I just did it I knew it were right
[1:46:49] but one day Hallelujah I Heard a Voice
[1:46:53] that says you're
[1:46:56] mine you think the battle's over no
[1:47:03] no chastisement comes he chastises his
[1:47:08] own think it not strange at the
[1:47:12] chastisement it might seem sorrowful at
[1:47:16] the time but it brings forth the
[1:47:18] beautiful beautiful
[1:47:21] peace that you
[1:47:24] know that he loved
[1:47:26] you that he's going to do whatever it
[1:47:30] takes whatever it takes he is not going
[1:47:37] to lose a one you can't go too
[1:47:42] far if you have the seed that's
[1:47:47] right he'll leave the
[1:47:50] 99 he'll do whatever he text but he has
[1:47:53] spoken it all the father hath given me
[1:47:59] will come
[1:48:00] that's I don't know who he's given or
[1:48:04] who has who he hasn't given therefore
[1:48:07] it's wise to treat all men as if they're
[1:48:11] angels
[1:48:14] unaware good
[1:48:18] practice wise
[1:48:21] practice
[1:48:23] taught by the Lord do unto others yes
[1:48:27] sir as you would have them do unto
[1:48:30] you that word is going to come
[1:48:34] forth but it had to be
[1:48:37] predestinated else there would been
[1:48:39] nothing there for him to breed with and
[1:48:42] bring life with he works from the inside
[1:48:47] out not from the outside in you can get
[1:48:51] all the outside fixed up to where you
[1:48:54] look like a scribe and a
[1:49:00] Pharisee where nobody can lay one thing
[1:49:02] to your
[1:49:08] charge but it's still your
[1:49:12] righteousness his
[1:49:14] righteousness was paying the price thank
[1:49:17] you for our flesh for our mind for our
[1:49:22] sin
[1:49:24] census that he would be
[1:49:26] justified in bringing forth that seed to
[1:49:30] life why
[1:49:32] predestination why a Lamb's Book of Life
[1:49:36] he had to make it the word in the
[1:49:42] beginning in
[1:49:44] order to bring life through
[1:49:48] it because if it wasn't it wouldn't
[1:49:51] bring life
[1:49:53] and what we have called Christianity
[1:49:57] Today bobbed hair makeup earrings
[1:50:02] shorts high heels man smoking cigarettes
[1:50:07] and and and doing all the things of the
[1:50:10] world and with the label what
[1:50:13] Christian he never United with that he
[1:50:16] couldn't Unite with that that's hybrid
[1:50:19] Christianity it's not even real genuine
[1:50:22] Christianity it's not the real thing the
[1:50:25] real thing had to exist Amen in the
[1:50:31] beginning he had to
[1:50:35] know he had because he couldn't Unite
[1:50:38] with anything that wasn't
[1:50:40] word so he
[1:50:45] predestinated the word to be in
[1:50:48] you so no matter what time he chose
[1:50:52] uhhuh to unite with it he wasn't uniting
[1:50:57] with your present condition he was
[1:51:00] uniting with what he had in the
[1:51:03] beginning that's why he told him in the
[1:51:05] beginning it wasn't so he was you
[1:51:09] not all
[1:51:14] right I'll use mini
[1:51:17] handheld he was uniting with what was
[1:51:21] eternal
[1:51:23] because eternity can only Unite with
[1:51:26] eternity if you if if eternity United
[1:51:30] with something that was
[1:51:32] carnal it couldn't produce eternal life
[1:51:35] that's right so if you have eternal life
[1:51:38] you always had eternal life cuz eternal
[1:51:42] life can only come from eternal life
[1:51:45] it's the only thing that can be brought
[1:51:48] together so he encapsuled you thank you
[1:51:52] Jesus hallelujah oh I'd like to go into
[1:51:54] the rest of this part of
[1:51:56] this we will get to it how Eve would
[1:52:00] have brought
[1:52:01] forth that's right but it went a hybrid
[1:52:06] route but in order to preserve his
[1:52:11] word he planted
[1:52:18] it Hallelujah he planted it in Sons and
[1:52:22] Daughters ERS scattered all throughout
[1:52:25] time that his word would be
[1:52:28] preserved and down Through the Ages he
[1:52:31] United with it and he United with it
[1:52:34] Wesley's group remember he said that
[1:52:36] group's going to rise up at the
[1:52:38] Hybrid can then he said Luther's group's
[1:52:41] going to rise up against the hybrid
[1:52:43] Pentecostal is going to rise you get
[1:52:45] those old Pentecostal fathers that
[1:52:47] prayed all night they see what they call
[1:52:49] Pentecost today they nauseate them
[1:52:56] I think some of those people that really
[1:52:58] got throw it out of their denominations
[1:53:00] and everything at this message might be
[1:53:02] a little upset with what we call the
[1:53:04] message
[1:53:05] today people half ashamed of the name of
[1:53:08] William Brown won't even put the picture
[1:53:11] of the pillar of fire in their Church
[1:53:13] won't even play tapes in their
[1:53:17] Church don't be deceived by that
[1:53:21] stuff
[1:53:23] when we know by the word
[1:53:26] itself that the O The Birth has to come
[1:53:30] by the word and it has to come by the
[1:53:33] word of the hour and it has to come by
[1:53:36] the person that was elected to give the
[1:53:38] word you can't bypass
[1:53:42] it what is it that we've got
[1:53:46] today I say back to the word amen back
[1:53:50] to the spirit of the word word back to
[1:53:54] predestination and what it really
[1:53:58] is so why were you
[1:54:01] predestinated it answers why you're
[1:54:04] here you know we don't have to
[1:54:11] struggle it's all been taken care
[1:54:15] of we have to overcome
[1:54:20] ourselves we have to pray
[1:54:24] for
[1:54:31] Revelation so he's talking
[1:54:35] here he says this is paragraph
[1:54:39] 120 improving his word he says notice it
[1:54:44] was by his Believers that he proves his
[1:54:47] word by he can only prove his word
[1:54:53] not by
[1:54:54] unbelievers it's only by Believers that
[1:54:57] he can
[1:54:59] prove his
[1:55:02] word no matter how much the rest of them
[1:55:07] claim to be oh I believe brother see if
[1:55:15] you he
[1:55:17] said brother see if you do God will
[1:55:22] prove prove it so cuz we look and see
[1:55:25] the others how can we say then see it's
[1:55:30] the True Believer that proves this word
[1:55:34] not by those who say they believe but
[1:55:37] those who really believe it's by his
[1:55:40] believing children that he proves his
[1:55:44] word now he
[1:55:47] had the Believers the old crop had died
[1:55:51] off the the unbelievers who said we
[1:55:54] couldn't take it he's talking about
[1:55:57] coming into the promised land how many
[1:55:59] know that's a perfect type where we are
[1:56:01] right now right now we're at the
[1:56:04] promised land we're at ready to go in
[1:56:08] and take every promise every
[1:56:11] predestinated Power every privilege
[1:56:14] that's granted to us to restore back to
[1:56:17] us the Faith of Our Fathers to do the
[1:56:19] same thing and they've come right up to
[1:56:22] to the door they don't feel they can
[1:56:24] take it so they go back to the life in
[1:56:27] the Pentecostal shock did I turn it off
[1:56:30] or what yeah they can't they can't get
[1:56:33] it right they can't get it
[1:56:36] right just as long as I get it right I'm
[1:56:39] happy I'm going to be judged for what I
[1:56:42] say that's going to meet me at the
[1:56:44] Judgment can you hear me is everything
[1:56:47] okay so they they they don't want to go
[1:56:51] forward
[1:56:54] so they set up camp prophet of God
[1:56:57] preached a wonderful message called
[1:56:59] going beyond the camp let the word of
[1:57:02] God take you out of your comfort zone
[1:57:05] let him take it beyond your flesh let
[1:57:07] him take it believe in what that he said
[1:57:10] will be
[1:57:12] true oh if you believe it he
[1:57:17] said the old crop died off the
[1:57:20] unbelievers who said we couldn't take it
[1:57:22] he let everyone of them perish why every
[1:57:26] one of them but believers who was left
[1:57:31] Moses had been taken to Glory the
[1:57:33] unbelievers had perished in the
[1:57:36] wilderness and this was their
[1:57:39] children there were only two that
[1:57:42] crossed over that was the Believers
[1:57:45] Joshua and
[1:57:47] Caleb they was the Believers they was
[1:57:51] the ones who crossed over it its only
[1:57:55] way God can do it is by his believing
[1:58:01] children so where are you going to get
[1:58:04] something to believe
[1:58:08] with you're born in sin you're shaped in
[1:58:12] iniquity you come in the world speaking
[1:58:15] lies you're a debor to the
[1:58:19] flesh where are you going to get
[1:58:21] something to to believe
[1:58:23] with not something
[1:58:25] hybrid but where are you going to get
[1:58:28] something to believe the original True
[1:58:31] Word of God with that is contrary to
[1:58:35] Science Education civilization and
[1:58:39] everything where are you going to get it
[1:58:43] from if the word come from
[1:58:46] eternity that had to come from
[1:58:50] eternity where are you going to get
[1:58:52] something to believe
[1:58:54] with he's got to predestinate it I am
[1:58:59] going to put in them a seed Something to
[1:59:05] Believe with that I can connect
[1:59:09] to cuz I got to use
[1:59:14] Believers without
[1:59:17] faith it's impossible to please God
[1:59:21] faith is a gift of God lest any man can
[1:59:26] boast so he said where are you going to
[1:59:28] get this there was believers they was
[1:59:31] the only ones who crossed over that's
[1:59:33] the way God can do it is by his
[1:59:36] believing children you believe that all
[1:59:39] right his Believers was the ones that
[1:59:42] done it he used them to cross over with
[1:59:45] see now I want you to
[1:59:49] notice he does it that way in in
[1:59:53] every
[1:59:56] age now doesn't that make you feel
[2:00:01] good to be
[2:00:03] elected to be
[2:00:06] predestinated to understand what he's
[2:00:08] chosen you to do what he's chosen you
[2:00:11] for who would sell that
[2:00:16] out when you sell out you know what
[2:00:19] that's called right it's called the
[2:00:21] Judas
[2:00:23] Spirit you sell out the
[2:00:26] word for a temporarily worldly
[2:00:36] gain oh I I I'd like to say I'm not
[2:00:42] guilty but the closer I face the
[2:00:46] reality the more I take
[2:00:48] heed that it's time I get serious
[2:00:53] when you're young you think you have all
[2:00:55] the world ahead of you and you find out
[2:00:59] that world flies by so
[2:01:02] fast we're in December
[2:01:07] already this is the fastest year I think
[2:01:10] I've ever been through in my
[2:01:13] life like slow
[2:01:17] down where do they depict that gold dark
[2:01:21] guy in in a hood carrying a
[2:01:24] sickle it's like he's doing a 4240 or
[2:01:27] something I mean he's moving
[2:01:33] out you
[2:01:36] say what's the word say he said he would
[2:01:39] shorten the
[2:01:41] days lest no flesh be
[2:01:50] saved I don't like short days I don't
[2:01:54] like when it gets dark at four
[2:01:56] 5:00 whose idea was
[2:02:02] that we're not children of the dark
[2:02:04] we're Children of the
[2:02:06] light I like it to be light till 9 10:00
[2:02:11] so I can
[2:02:20] work it's believing children you believe
[2:02:23] that all right Believers was the ones
[2:02:26] that done it he used them to cross over
[2:02:29] now I want you to notice he does it the
[2:02:32] same way in every age he does it every
[2:02:36] time by the same method he has to take
[2:02:41] Believers and then in order to have
[2:02:45] Believers to meet that word hallelujah
[2:02:50] he's got to pred destinated to that
[2:02:55] age so you understand why now you can
[2:02:58] only be born again in the age that
[2:03:01] you're
[2:03:03] living cuz you weren't predestinated to
[2:03:06] receive any other word but the word for
[2:03:09] this
[2:03:13] age and that's what that our messenger
[2:03:16] preached he said let's raise them up out
[2:03:19] of History let's let's quit
[2:03:22] quit try trying to
[2:03:24] clone that's right look back and imitate
[2:03:29] an age gone by and let him speak a new
[2:03:34] person into existence in this
[2:03:37] age
[2:03:40] Hallelujah something new and fresh and
[2:03:43] Alive by the word and the message that
[2:03:46] he sent to be brought to life in this
[2:03:49] age I don't care how dark you are you
[2:03:52] can be caveman dark
[2:03:55] come but if it's in
[2:03:58] there he'll do whatever it takes to
[2:04:04] bring it out he'll descend into the
[2:04:07] lowest hell to find
[2:04:15] you
[2:04:16] unbelief does not stop
[2:04:20] God like I said Paul what an
[2:04:24] unbeliever man what a revelation he had
[2:04:28] who are you Lord laying there
[2:04:30] blind sees a great flash of
[2:04:34] light and can you imagine when those
[2:04:36] words are spoke I'm Jesus whom you're
[2:04:45] persecuting
[2:04:46] wow I can't believe what I'm
[2:04:49] doing you know how he just described
[2:04:52] himself the
[2:04:54] chiefest of all
[2:04:58] Sinners Pharisee above
[2:05:00] Sarah a scribe above all scribes taught
[2:05:04] in the house of
[2:05:08] Gia and I counted all dung not worth
[2:05:12] nothing I was the chiefest of all
[2:05:16] Sinners but the Lord spoke to him Paul
[2:05:19] your mind and I'm going to show you what
[2:05:22] you have to suffer for this gospel say
[2:05:25] because I have chosen you to bring what
[2:05:29] you are persecuting to the
[2:05:33] Gentiles now how would you like to face
[2:05:35] that
[2:05:37] message I think the first book that Paul
[2:05:40] went back and
[2:05:41] read was the Book of
[2:05:46] Jonah somebody else who ran from a
[2:05:49] message someone else who w going to go
[2:05:52] down there and tell them people what God
[2:05:53] told him to tell them found himself in
[2:05:56] the belly of a whale in the bottom of an
[2:06:02] ocean didn't stop
[2:06:04] God God spewed them out on the beach
[2:06:09] coming walking out of the mouth of the
[2:06:11] god they served hey man you are the
[2:06:15] voice to this final
[2:06:19] age you are coming out out of the
[2:06:22] mouth of the god that you
[2:06:26] serve you are being spoken into position
[2:06:31] amen you are being resurrected to life
[2:06:35] you are now being
[2:06:38] created by the word that you were
[2:06:42] predestinated to
[2:06:44] receive because you have a mission to
[2:06:48] fulfill and God's got to fulfill fill
[2:06:51] that mission therefore it was
[2:06:56] necessary that he predestinated you and
[2:07:00] put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:07:03] that you would be eternity you come from
[2:07:07] God and you go to
[2:07:10] God let us finish this
[2:07:17] evening and in order to have Believers
[2:07:20] to meet the word he's got to
[2:07:22] predestinate it to that age you see it
[2:07:26] he's got to predestinate this thing to
[2:07:30] be there to meet the challenge of the
[2:07:33] age did you get it did you feel it did
[2:07:38] you see it did you understand it that's
[2:07:42] what's happening today he
[2:07:46] predestinated to this by his for
[2:07:50] knowledge when he predestinated in
[2:07:52] Malachi 4 it's got to happen when he
[2:07:56] came over and predestinated anything to
[2:07:59] happen in his word he had to prove his
[2:08:02] word to be so and when he predestines
[2:08:06] anything to happen and says it will
[2:08:09] happen he knows that seed will be there
[2:08:14] just at that time
[2:08:20] oh hallel
[2:08:23] that's why it's
[2:08:24] predestination it isn't just
[2:08:27] predestination I chose this one I chose
[2:08:31] that one it's predestination with a
[2:08:34] purpose it's predestination with a
[2:08:38] spirit with an
[2:08:41] intention with an
[2:08:43] outcome it's never oh I'm predestinated
[2:08:47] to be there no you're not predestinated
[2:08:49] to be there you're predestinated to to
[2:08:51] carry out the word you carry out the
[2:08:53] word you'll be there that's right that's
[2:08:56] right that's
[2:08:59] right you got to you got to take the
[2:09:02] word you got to let let him mold it you
[2:09:05] got to let him build the the the clay
[2:09:08] he's the Potter you're the clay all
[2:09:10] mankind lies in front of him as one lump
[2:09:12] of clay and with nail card guard hands
[2:09:15] he molds that lump of clay to his
[2:09:17] purpose sometimes he's got to take that
[2:09:19] clay and completely break it down and
[2:09:21] build it up the way that he wants it
[2:09:23] this is the love of God and another way
[2:09:26] of Love there is
[2:09:32] not Church age
[2:09:36] book beautiful
[2:09:41] book and when he predestined anything to
[2:09:44] happen and he says it'll happen he knows
[2:09:47] the seed will be there at that time he
[2:09:50] predestinate a
[2:09:58] bride he had to have an
[2:10:02] eve she would have never
[2:10:06] come by anything here the church World
[2:10:10] cannot produce the
[2:10:12] bride it's too mixed it's too
[2:10:16] hybrid the only thing that can reproduce
[2:10:20] itself is the seed of
[2:10:22] God it's got to be watered by the spirit
[2:10:26] and impregnated by the word it's got to
[2:10:30] be watered by the
[2:10:33] intention and the purpose for why the
[2:10:36] word was
[2:10:40] spoken that's why they'll come to him in
[2:10:42] that day and say Lord Lord we've done
[2:10:45] all these things he'll say depart from
[2:10:47] me you doers of iniquity that's never
[2:10:50] what I predestinated you to
[2:10:53] do
[2:10:55] remember the bride the believer doesn't
[2:10:59] produce the
[2:11:01] signs the signs
[2:11:04] follow those that are following the word
[2:11:08] they become second nature you never sit
[2:11:12] back and say I'm going to go pray for
[2:11:13] this guy and they're going to get
[2:11:18] well that's a some sort of Glory Seeker
[2:11:22] but you're living your
[2:11:25] life at the
[2:11:27] funeral I was coming up an
[2:11:30] elevator I had my Bible in my hand a man
[2:11:33] stepped in the
[2:11:34] elevator we started to write up he says
[2:11:37] we got to the bottom
[2:11:39] floor and I was fixing the step out and
[2:11:42] he said sir are you a
[2:11:44] preacher I said yes sir he said will you
[2:11:48] pray for
[2:11:49] me my house just just blew
[2:11:53] up then I didn't I figured insurance
[2:11:57] would probably take care of it and maybe
[2:12:01] it wasn't Financial or
[2:12:03] everything but I felt this is a
[2:12:06] man that's calling
[2:12:11] out he arranged that meeting in that
[2:12:18] elevator everything's in the palm of his
[2:12:23] hand everything's on his
[2:12:26] timing can we put our hand on and we
[2:12:29] bowed our heads there and we
[2:12:32] prayed I don't even know all that I
[2:12:34] prayed I just felt something on my heart
[2:12:37] to pray and we
[2:12:41] prayed and there seemed to be a peace
[2:12:43] come over the
[2:12:44] man and he looked over and he said thank
[2:12:47] you so much I know it'll be all right
[2:12:51] and I said I know it'll be all right too
[2:12:54] and we win our
[2:12:56] way with him he makes it happen you
[2:13:00] don't have to make it
[2:13:03] happen
[2:13:08] follow he says he knows the seed will be
[2:13:10] there just at that time he predestinated
[2:13:14] a bride she's going to breathe there
[2:13:17] going to be a Rapture she's going to be
[2:13:20] there
[2:13:21] he predestinated it by his forn
[2:13:24] knowledge see there's nothing
[2:13:28] going to stop
[2:13:34] it that's why the Lamb's Book of
[2:13:39] Life that was the
[2:13:41] necessity of
[2:13:43] predestination the necessity of
[2:13:46] predestination wasn't so he could have
[2:13:48] somebody there it was so he could have
[2:13:51] somebody
[2:13:54] here that he could Unite with and become
[2:13:58] one with and fulfill his word
[2:14:01] with
[2:14:03] that is something we ought to be
[2:14:05] thankful for we ought to be thankful to
