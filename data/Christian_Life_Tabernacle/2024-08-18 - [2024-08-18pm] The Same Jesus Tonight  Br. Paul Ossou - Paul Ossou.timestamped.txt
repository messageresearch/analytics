[28:10] up here but
[28:12] um I just wanted to
[28:16] um just thank the Lord for his
[28:21] word and that it's
[28:24] true and um I wanted to thank the
[28:27] congregation
[28:28] and my family just for all the prayers
[28:32] um for me it's been 5 years since like
[28:35] symptoms had started those of you that
[28:38] know I have just like some kind of
[28:41] mysterious illness of like pain and the
[28:44] doctors can't really figure it out
[28:47] and it's been a long hard definitely the
[28:50] hardest trial I've ever been through and
[28:52] it's just been a long journey of just up
[28:55] and down
[28:56] and just really difficult and
[29:01] um yeah and just there's been many times
[29:06] that I've wanted to I felt like the Lord
[29:08] was trying to get me to come up and just
[29:11] fear would just stop me um from coming
[29:15] up because you know it hadn't happened
[29:18] yet it hadn't happened yet but I knew
[29:19] that I needed to testify and um be
[29:24] obedient to the word and make the
[29:28] confession that by his stripes I'm
[29:29] Healed and I believe it even
[29:32] though um my symptoms don't show it yet
[29:36] but just like when my daughter come up
[29:38] the other night I didn't I mean that was
[29:40] like an encouragement to me and I felt
[29:44] like go I should have been the one that
[29:46] went up there first you know I was kind
[29:48] of like okay um but I mean just God
[29:53] moves in different ways so um I just
[29:56] want to thank everybody for praying for
[29:58] me and it's just meant so much to me and
[30:02] just been so humbling and it's it's just
[30:04] kind of a weird thing you can't really
[30:06] see it but it's there but I know God has
[30:10] just given me the grace to make it
[30:12] through and I just every day and um
[30:17] through the years and even at the
[30:18] beginning um I never testified of this
[30:21] and I should have but I had went into
[30:23] like a really bad depression I mean just
[30:26] like it was worse than like pain or
[30:29] anything I mean I've never experienced
[30:30] anything like that in my life like I
[30:32] couldn't even eat I couldn't anything I
[30:34] was just so just it was horrible and God
[30:36] just lifted that off of me and I was
[30:39] just like and I should have testified
[30:41] then but I I just let the fear and
[30:44] everything just stopped me so but
[30:49] um yeah so I just the word today was
[30:54] just like so good and
[30:58] I just feel so happy and joyful I mean I
[31:01] just feel so happy I just I'm just
[31:04] like I don't
[31:07] know I just feel like I don't even care
[31:10] I'm just happy and
[31:12] like um and like brother Matthew said
[31:15] sometimes you just got to start over and
[31:17] so I know it's been a long time coming
[31:19] for me kind of to my shame that I
[31:21] haven't been up here yet
[31:23] but I just wanted to be obedient to the
[31:26] word and I know that if I'm in his will
[31:30] that it's he has it all in control and
[31:33] and that it's for a purpose and that if
[31:36] God be me who can be against me and that
[31:40] no matter what like I'm not going to bow
[31:42] to the
[31:43] enemy and um I just want to say by his
[31:47] stripes I'm Healed
[31:49] and um just like he was saying today
[31:52] it's just lying
[31:53] vanities and I'm just going to keep
[31:55] confessing it until it happens hey and
[32:00] um watch the miracle like brother
[32:03] Matthew was saying and um that something
[32:06] Good's going to come out of the
[32:08] trial and um I was thinking why am I
[32:12] doing this you know why am I coming up
[32:13] here you know to testify or you know
[32:16] because I'm being obedient and God says
[32:18] to confess it and that you have to
[32:21] confess it first but also for like I
[32:25] know you can't really see it you know
[32:26] the symptom that I have but like for an
[32:30] unbeliever if they're watching out there
[32:32] I mean ultimately it's so when I come up
[32:35] here healed and it's
[32:37] manifested they can see that and know
[32:40] that God is real and and ultimately a
[32:44] conversion or just something for
[32:47] something else somebody else because all
[32:49] things work for the good to those that
[32:52] um love him and let's see
[32:59] anyways um yeah so I just wanted to
[33:02] thank everybody and I love you all so
[33:04] much and I just I can't express how much
[33:07] I love you all and I appreciate so much
[33:09] all the prayers and just being
[33:11] longsuffering and with me and just
[33:14] through the years
[33:15] really um I'm kind of a miracle in
[33:18] itself just my salvation is the biggest
[33:21] miracle that I have in my life so and I
[33:24] just thank my husband that's been just
[33:27] there for me me and never given up on me
[33:30] and put up with
[33:33] me
[33:34] and you know there's been those times
[33:37] where you know I've just wanted to crawl
[33:39] in a hole and just everybody nobody see
[33:41] never never see anybody again you know I
[33:43] just just how I don't know and he's just
[33:46] been there for me through all of it and
[33:49] always has confessed it and always
[33:51] confessed it and I'm just grateful for
[33:54] my family and for all that they've um
[33:58] been there for me through all of this
[33:59] and and just the last you know just I
[34:03] just feel like my faith is really rising
[34:05] up and I just really want to call that
[34:08] fear a lot you know the liar of you know
[34:11] like he was saying today that really
[34:13] struck me when he was like don't let
[34:16] fear be your
[34:17] Energizer you know don't let that be
[34:20] what gets you going or whatever so I
[34:23] just thought that was really good and
[34:25] I'm just so thankful and
[34:28] happy I'm just really
[34:31] happy I just really felt like that my
[34:34] heart just felt just Joy

[51:27] is really receiving real punches
[51:34] tonight we are so happy to serve a God
[51:36] Like Jesus
[51:39] Christ let's open our
[51:45] Bibles in John chapter
[51:51] 1 we'll read from the first verse
[52:01] in the beginning was the word and the
[52:03] Word was with God and the Word was God
[52:07] the same was in the beginning with Gods
[52:10] all things were made by him and without
[52:13] him was not anything made that was made
[52:17] in him was life and the life was the
[52:20] light of man and the light shth in the
[52:24] darkness and the Darkness comprehended
[52:27] it not uh let jump to the verse 14 and
[52:31] the Word was made flesh and dwell among
[52:35] us and we beheld his glory the glory as
[52:40] of the only begotten of the father Full
[52:44] of Grace and
[52:47] Truth uh let's go to Hebrew chapter
[52:51] chapter 13
[53:02] verse
[53:04] 8 Jesus Christ the same
[53:07] yesterday and today and
[53:12] forever Lord
[53:16] Jesus we have said
[53:19] it because we read it because you said
[53:23] it you are the same
[53:27] yesterday today and
[53:31] forever may you manifest that
[53:33] tonight in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[53:39] amen have your
[53:46] seats we bless the name of the Lord
[53:48] tonight for his presence among us
[53:53] tonight and we believe that since this
[53:55] morning God is has been manifesting his
[54:01] presence after the morning service I
[54:03] went home and I started praying a
[54:12] lot I said I I ask God so he can bring a
[54:15] lot a lot of testimonies after this
[54:18] morning service
[54:27] and I told Brother Matthew in reality he
[54:29] preached a part of the sermon I wanted
[54:31] to
[54:35] preach I'm just going to add a little
[54:37] bit to what he has already
[54:41] said as the Lord will lead
[54:49] me because as I was looking for an
[54:51] inspiration for tonight's
[54:54] service I was in I went to
[54:58] prayer and as I was
[55:02] praying uh what really doesn't happen
[55:05] that
[55:06] much I I fall asleep while I was
[55:13] praying so I was I was kneeling and I
[55:16] fall
[55:18] asleep I saw myself come to the
[55:21] pulpit and I announced what was the my
[55:24] title
[55:28] the same Jesus
[55:35] tonight the same Jesus
[55:39] tonight I'm
[55:40] sorry that's my title tonight the same
[55:43] Jesus
[55:47] tonight the same Jesus that we saw
[55:49] manifested this
[55:53] morning it's the same Jesus who's Among
[55:55] Us t
[55:59] you know when I after I woke up from the
[56:03] sleep in this dream I had this little
[56:10] note and so I really didn't want to take
[56:12] a lot of
[56:14] notes I took about uh three uh
[56:20] quotes and then I said the rest I'll see
[56:23] how the Lord will lead me
[56:27] because it's him who knows what's in my
[56:30] heart and it's him who knows what's in
[56:33] your
[56:34] heart he knows the need of every one of
[56:42] us and he knows how to bring the need of
[56:45] each and everyone to be
[56:49] fulfilled and when sister Heidi gave the
[56:52] testimony
[56:59] and how God LED brother Beno to continue
[57:02] in the
[57:03] worship because there was a presence of
[57:06] the
[57:07] Lord I told Brother Billy in the
[57:11] office I understood why God didn't want
[57:13] me to write down a lot of
[57:17] notes because a part of my my my
[57:21] service is the testimony of sister
[57:24] heid so she started the
[57:28] and I believe the same
[57:30] God that she testified
[57:34] about will manifest his glory in her
[57:39] life and that each and every one of
[57:42] us regardless of the needs you're going
[57:44] to
[57:47] have same God is able to do great
[57:50] things because it's the same
[57:53] [Music]
[57:55] tonight today Jesus did
[57:58] things is the same
[58:02] tonight that's able to bring great
[58:05] things in the life of each and every one
[58:07] of us what God is asking
[58:11] usam would
[58:13] say that what God is asking of us is to
[58:17] have
[58:19] faith all that he's asking
[58:23] [Music]
[58:24] us the greatest thing thing that we have
[58:26] to do is to
[58:30] believe that he hears our prayers rest
[58:34] the
[58:36] rest even when a miracle will come to
[58:39] pass it's not us it's not our work
[58:44] that's his part that's him that's going
[58:47] to do
[58:48] it because he's the one only one that
[58:51] can make
[58:54] Miracles we don't have Capac capacity to
[58:56] bring forth
[58:58] Miracles but he has the capacity to do
[59:02] that he capable of bringing
[59:06] something so he can assure us that he's
[59:10] with us to assure us that he is our God
[59:15] that is the
[59:18] same that he's the the only
[59:21] one that he doesn't have
[59:24] limits that he doesn't know the the word
[59:30] impossible you know when we want to talk
[59:32] about
[59:34] Jesus when we start from
[59:37] Genesis we have
[59:42] Jesus everything that was done even in
[59:45] the Old
[59:46] Testament we have Jesus but I'm
[59:51] says when Jesus when David went before
[59:54] Goliath he took five Stones it was the
[59:58] name of
[1:00:00] Jesus
[1:00:04] thankes Mo
[1:00:09] Moses god did great
[1:00:11] things through
[1:00:15] Moses and we know when God went to meet
[1:00:18] uh uh meet with
[1:00:21] Moses he told
[1:00:24] Moses I am the God of Abraham the god of
[1:00:28] Isaac the god of
[1:00:31] Jacob Mo Moses told him all that I
[1:00:35] know but what is your name tell me your
[1:00:39] name what is your
[1:00:41] name because I'm going to
[1:00:44] go what is your
[1:00:46] name he told
[1:00:49] him I'm called I am
[1:00:56] my name is I
[1:01:00] am the one who's always at
[1:01:04] present so when the present there I
[1:01:08] am went with
[1:01:11] Moses when Jesus himself
[1:01:14] came he says
[1:01:16] Abraham when he saw my
[1:01:19] day so that means even Moses he saw my
[1:01:23] day all those that were in the
[1:01:26] past it was with me that they walk with
[1:01:31] it was because of me that they fulfilled
[1:01:34] the things that they did because the
[1:01:37] Bible tells
[1:01:38] us that not none of the things that were
[1:01:43] created that we were created without
[1:01:47] him and we saw
[1:01:50] Jesus he took the children of
[1:01:53] Israel from from Egypt unto the promised
[1:02:00] land it was a a a a travel that should
[1:02:03] have only taken couple of
[1:02:07] days so from only few days they should
[1:02:10] have gotten from Egypt they should have
[1:02:12] taken from Egypt onto the promised land
[1:02:15] but
[1:02:17] God he he he allowed for them to go
[1:02:20] through the
[1:02:23] desert and to go 40 years years in this
[1:02:29] journey and the 40 years in the
[1:02:34] journey there was no shop shopping
[1:02:37] places where they will go buy
[1:02:40] clothes there were
[1:02:44] none with the same
[1:02:46] clothes the same
[1:02:49] shoes everything that they
[1:02:51] had for 40 years
[1:02:56] I don't know how they were doing
[1:02:59] it I I don't know how they were making
[1:03:02] the child who was going how they would
[1:03:04] make their clothes go
[1:03:07] taller I don't know how they would make
[1:03:09] the shoes of the kids go longer but all
[1:03:12] that I
[1:03:14] know that this God was
[1:03:18] able to understand the need of the
[1:03:21] children of
[1:03:23] Israel and to bring the solution that
[1:03:26] was
[1:03:28] needful when he understood that they
[1:03:30] were
[1:03:32] hungry he he rain Mana from
[1:03:36] Heaven I don't know how that was
[1:03:40] cooked I don't know what what kind of
[1:03:42] oven that
[1:03:43] was but all that I
[1:03:47] know that God let the Mana fall down
[1:03:52] from because he didn't want his children
[1:03:54] to go hungry
[1:03:59] and when they got to a place where they
[1:04:00] were
[1:04:02] thirsty where they were
[1:04:04] thirsty they didn't know what to
[1:04:08] do God Called
[1:04:13] Moses he didn't create a
[1:04:19] river he brought them to the place the
[1:04:22] most dry place in the desert The
[1:04:26] Rock he said hit the
[1:04:30] rock Moses hit the
[1:04:33] rock and water came out of the
[1:04:37] rock they they drank in
[1:04:41] abundance and when we read
[1:04:45] that we have the impression that when
[1:04:47] they
[1:04:49] drank I I was I was reading and trying
[1:04:52] to read it in Exodus
[1:04:55] I thought that they
[1:04:57] drank but the rock stay there and then
[1:05:01] they continue to
[1:05:03] walk but when I got to

[1:18:53] tonight
[1:18:56] regardless of your
[1:18:59] problem oh we can go from problem to
[1:19:02] problem even if you are a
[1:19:11] sinner sin we
[1:19:16] yes sorry it's the same word for both
[1:19:19] yes even if you are a sinner and you've
[1:19:22] sinned every time
[1:19:28] one
[1:19:32] time there was a woman that was caught
[1:19:35] in PL
[1:19:38] adultery it there was no you couldn't
[1:19:41] contest
[1:19:43] it they caught
[1:19:49] her so the Pharisees instead of them
[1:19:52] just stoning her themselves
[1:19:56] they could have found a solution
[1:19:57] according to their own
[1:20:01] thinking they decided to take him
[1:20:03] through the Jesus that we have
[1:20:07] tonight
[1:20:09] Jesus look at this
[1:20:13] woman we caught her in adultery
[1:20:19] right the the scripture says
[1:20:25] the soul that sinth is the soul that
[1:20:29] dies she has to
[1:20:32] Die the scripture
[1:20:35] says that the adulterers will not get
[1:20:38] into the kingdom of
[1:20:40] God and what what do you
[1:20:49] say Jesus began to
[1:20:52] write he started writing
[1:20:56] and everyone was looking and coming look
[1:21:00] I'm not sure what he was writing but I
[1:21:02] imagine everyone they will look
[1:21:07] Paul you that the one who has the
[1:21:10] biggest
[1:21:11] Stone did you do you remember what you
[1:21:14] did
[1:21:16] yesterday if you try I'll tell everybody
[1:21:18] what you did
[1:21:20] yesterday pass John came John if even
[1:21:26] you try and you will see
[1:21:28] yourself the the Roger came by oh
[1:21:34] Roger everyone was
[1:21:38] coming and will throw away their Stone
[1:21:40] and then they will go on they will
[1:21:44] continue and when Jesus lift his head up
[1:21:48] there's nobody so he says
[1:21:53] woman where all their
[1:22:03] accusers he told them that every one of
[1:22:07] you who has never sinned let him throw
[1:22:09] the first
[1:22:11] stone and that was before and then he
[1:22:13] started
[1:22:14] writing so every one of them they found
[1:22:20] themselves they all realized that they
[1:22:22] were just Sinners saved by grace
[1:22:29] that they had no no right to to to stop
[1:22:32] that same Grace to be extended to
[1:22:34] another human
[1:22:35] being says that before God a
[1:22:41] preacher regardless of what power he
[1:22:45] has he's not more than a a
[1:22:49] drunken that comes into the house of
[1:22:52] God and he gives his life to the
[1:22:59] Lord and when Jesus looks at this
[1:23:03] woman he says even I not I but he
[1:23:07] doesn't he didn't have any
[1:23:09] sin he was the word made
[1:23:13] flesh he was the
[1:23:16] pardon he was the perfect
[1:23:19] love he says not even
[1:23:22] I I'm not going to condem
[1:23:25] you but one
[1:23:28] condition be
[1:23:30] careful
[1:23:32] go and say no
[1:23:37] more I'm giving you the
[1:23:40] grace
[1:23:42] go and sin no

[1:23:54] if it's your
[1:23:56] situation the same Jesus is here
[1:24:00] tonight to forgive you it to tell you go
[1:24:06] and sin no
[1:24:08] more the S sinning is not your
[1:24:12] place you are a daughter of God you are
[1:24:16] a son of
[1:24:19] God the devil probably took you in that
[1:24:23] condition but Like an Eagle
[1:24:26] EET you you heard the voice of Mother
[1:24:31] Eagle flap your
[1:24:34] wings leave those things behind and come
[1:24:41] forward but talks about uh uh the the
[1:24:44] story of uh Johnny
[1:24:50] crow that there was a farmers who tied
[1:24:53] his
[1:24:54] Johnny C to a
[1:24:59] tree that every time that he will try to
[1:25:02] fly he couldn't go far every time he'll
[1:25:06] go try and come
[1:25:09] down and then he started only going
[1:25:12] around circles around the
[1:25:14] tree he was only going around the
[1:25:18] tree and he was so used to going around
[1:25:21] the tree
[1:25:24] that one day there was someone who was
[1:25:26] coming
[1:25:27] by who looked at his condition that was
[1:25:31] miserable and he went and went ahead and
[1:25:33] cut the
[1:25:35] rope but Johnny C continued to go in
[1:25:40] circles he didn't
[1:25:44] realize that Jesus brought solution to
[1:25:47] his
[1:25:49] problem that he was once again able to
[1:25:52] fly
[1:25:58] sometimes it's how the devil tries to
[1:26:00] keep the children of
[1:26:02] God but Jesus is here to cut the RO it
[1:26:06] says you are able to
[1:26:07] fly you are able to go

[1:33:09] you if you are ashamed of him when you
[1:33:11] are among among with the
[1:33:16] people and then you go down in the
[1:33:18] basement so nobody will see

[1:33:28] that ought to make you love him more
[1:33:30] above everything in the
[1:33:33] world Jesus in second place Jesus in
[1:33:37] fourth place Jesus in 10th
[1:33:40] place but still comes but but still he

[1:33:57] come he'll come to rescue
[1:34:03] you he's going to come to answer your
[1:34:08] prayer regardless of the
[1:34:12] situation when we go in the
[1:34:15] Bible we have so many
[1:34:20] situations that for every single one of
[1:34:22] our needs
[1:34:25] we know that Jesus will
[1:34:29] come we have even situations that are
[1:34:32] most
[1:34:34] extreme he may not come the same
[1:34:37] way like he did for the other or for the
[1:34:41] for the
[1:34:42] other we see for the
[1:34:45] blind Jesus only spoke he
[1:34:50] saw but the one who was born blind
[1:34:54] he he he mixed the the the the the the
[1:34:56] the
[1:34:57] ground and he and he put on his eyes and
[1:35:01] he says go wash yourself in go wash your
[1:35:04] eyes in the
[1:35:07] water so sometimes we wait oh I want God
[1:35:10] to give me the same testimony as brother
[1:35:14] Beno the same testimony as sister
[1:35:21] Heidi but God will give you your
[1:35:24] testimony the best way it will fit
[1:35:28] you how did Jesus call his
[1:35:31] disciples he was not the same
[1:35:34] way for some
[1:35:38] disciples Jesus would had need to
[1:35:41] manifest the signs of the son of man
[1:35:44] that you are you are Simon the
[1:35:47] barjon for other
[1:35:49] disciples the Bible says that uh James
[1:35:54] and John the sons of
[1:35:59] zebede they were with their father they
[1:36:01] were fixing their
[1:36:04] net look at this man who was going by
[1:36:08] who looks at them and says you and you
[1:36:11] follow
[1:36:12] me they let the net and they started
[1:36:15] following
[1:36:17] him and they are
[1:36:20] disciples they Apostles of Jesus Christ
[1:36:26] there was no demonstration of power for
[1:36:28] them to become
[1:36:30] disciples they heard the
[1:36:33] word the word of Jesus Christ come
[1:36:37] follow me I'll make of you fishes of
[1:36:46] man God answers according to his own
[1:36:50] way but what we have to know
[1:36:56] that he hears our
[1:37:00] prayers and Jesus before the the tomb of
[1:37:04] Lazarus a most desperate
[1:37:07] situation it's never happened
[1:37:11] before a person who died for four
[1:37:14] days he he started
[1:37:17] smelling and Jesus looked at
[1:37:20] him before Lazarus died
[1:37:24] Jesus said oh his
[1:37:26] situation it was for the glory of
[1:37:30] God like the blind who was born blind
[1:37:34] who who sinned nobody sinned it's for
[1:37:37] the glory of
[1:37:40] God Jesus stands before the tomb of
[1:37:43] Lazarus A desperate
[1:37:46] situation my brother is your situation A
[1:37:49] desperate
[1:37:50] situation is your situation A desperate
[1:37:53] situation
[1:37:54] look at Jesus he presents
[1:37:57] himself when he presents himself tonight
[1:38:00] he says father I
[1:38:03] know that th hears my prayers always
[1:38:07] hallelujah
[1:38:08] hallelujah I
[1:38:10] know that you always hear my
[1:38:14] prayers that's why when we pray we pray
[1:38:17] in the name of
[1:38:18] Jesus Jesus Takes that prayer father I
[1:38:23] know
[1:38:24] that you hear my prayers
[1:38:29] always
[1:38:30] Lazarus come
[1:38:35] out look at another desperate
[1:38:38] situation the the thief on the
[1:38:42] cross it was the end of
[1:38:46] life criminal all life
[1:38:50] long abandoned all life long
[1:38:55] but he had the
[1:38:57] privilege to find himself at the last
[1:39:00] minute of Life next to
[1:39:03] Jesus who's here
[1:39:08] tonight it said I know who you are I
[1:39:11] know that you are
[1:39:14] here that when you go to your
[1:39:18] glory I may not be worthy to say forgive
[1:39:22] me because all that I
[1:39:24] did I deserve I don't deserve a
[1:39:28] pardon but when you go to your
[1:39:31] glory remember
[1:39:36] me he just
[1:39:39] recognized the presence of
[1:39:43] God he never went to the water
[1:39:47] baptism he never went to a
[1:39:51] church he never had a pastor
[1:39:55] P but he went in the kingdom of
[1:40:00] God he was abandoned all his
[1:40:06] life because
[1:40:08] God when you invite
[1:40:10] him he comes
[1:40:15] always when you pray to him ex he hears
[1:40:19] you always
[1:40:24] sometimes it's us that become
[1:40:29] impatient we imagine under what
[1:40:32] circumstance or how is he going to
[1:40:34] answer to my my
[1:40:37] prayer but he knows how he's going to
[1:40:46] answer but what talks about the story of
[1:40:49] Abraham and
[1:40:51] jobed we're going to finish with that
[1:40:58] he was explaining how hard it was for
[1:41:00] the children of
[1:41:05] Israel how it was a weight for
[1:41:10] hamam how amam prayed
[1:41:15] always

[1:41:44] 79 now so he's talking about amram him
[1:41:47] his family and his wife
[1:42:03] and then it says so so after they had
[1:42:06] eaten supper the little boy talking
[1:42:08] about the little boy the two girls it
[1:42:10] was uh uh Aaron and and Miriam he said
[1:42:13] they had just eaten and they all ate
[1:42:16] supper and the mother put the things
[1:42:18] away and they and and and and uh they
[1:42:21] tuck into the bed
[1:42:26] and then she goes into the
[1:42:30] room her and her husband they sat
[1:42:32] down she said well
[1:42:46] now what was it that you saw today
[1:42:50] Amron that made you so upset tonight

[1:43:01] darling I just can't understand it he
[1:43:08] said we see it every
[1:43:12] day but today especially I seen an an
[1:43:17] awful awfulest side I ever seen
[1:43:24] he said I seen the awfulest sight I've
[1:43:27] ever
[1:43:28] seen
[1:43:32] said our poor boys some of them not even
[1:43:36] 12 years
[1:43:41] old pulling that big old wagon with
[1:43:44] ropes around their neck like
[1:43:50] that those poor little kids in the
[1:43:52] pulled till they couldn't pull no
[1:43:57] more up that great big incline those big
[1:44:01] Stone back
[1:44:03] there and they couldn't go no
[1:44:07] further and after a
[1:44:12] while the the wagon the wagon began to
[1:44:16] Creak and go real real
[1:44:21] slow and after a while it
[1:44:25] stopped down the road came a
[1:44:28] man oh he was a
[1:44:31] maniac he roared
[1:44:34] out why are you stopping this
[1:44:39] wagon wh with this great big old snake
[1:44:43] whip whipping them across the
[1:44:48] back the blood running out of their back
[1:44:54] and run down like that and the poor
[1:44:55] little kids just hung onto those rope
[1:44:59] and
[1:45:00] cried said
[1:45:04] oh what can we do
[1:45:07] mother
[1:45:09] said we are the people of
[1:45:11] God God blessed us we are the children
[1:45:15] of
[1:45:16] Abraham Isaac and
[1:45:19] Jacob why will we be uh we why

[1:45:32] things oh it's terrible how those poor
[1:45:35] boys
[1:45:36] cried oh I pray and I prayed and I
[1:45:45] prayed and he seems like God does God
[1:45:48] just don't even hear
[1:45:51] me sometimes we have that imp impression
[1:45:54] that we
[1:45:55] pray we pray
[1:45:57] again it seems like God doesn't hear
[1:46:02] us it was the situation for
[1:46:08] them it says it seems like it seems like
[1:46:11] it turned his death
[1:46:15] ears and then and then he
[1:46:18] says
[1:46:20] am that don't sound like
[1:46:24] Hallelujah that don't sound like
[1:46:27] you my brother my sister that don't

[1:47:09] all the
[1:47:10] time the more I
[1:47:12] pray the worse it
[1:47:16] gets sometimes we have that
[1:47:19] impression that the more we pray the
[1:47:22] worse he G
[1:47:26] was having a Sunday school with the
[1:47:29] kids and I believe we are all kids
[1:47:32] because the Bible
[1:47:35] says that the kingdom of God is those
[1:47:37] that that are like
[1:47:40] children and paragraph
[1:47:42] 84 will

[1:48:24] does doesn't
[1:48:27] he and just because everything is going
