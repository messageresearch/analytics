you remember uh brother Donnie Reagan and uh as he this is uh one year since the passing of his daughter Erica and also um Lance Parker who's a friend of mine it was his wife and today is also the birthday of their Twins and Lance asked his kids you know being a the Oney year anniversary kids would you want to go anywhere would you is there something you'd like to do they said yes daddy let's go to church I just thrilled my soul so let's just remember her family at this anniversary of the passing of sister Erica and makes me think of others that have lost loved ones you know many times we do memorials and we send our prayers and words of encouragement and yet they have a long road to journey and one week will go by and then the anniversary will come and yet that's something that they carry with them and we want to say I I want to help carry the burden a little bit let's go before him Lord Jesus we love you and are so thankful for your grace and your mercy that you have shown unto us as undeserving as we would be you look down and Sol us in our need Lord and you made a way for us where there would have seemed like there was no way Lord and you loved us when we were unlovable and it's because of that great love wherein you've loved us Lord we want to tell you that we love you Lord and thank you for calling us and choosing us and making a way Lord our heart is heavy for brother Donnie and brother Lance as and the children at this anniversary of the passing of sister Erica Lord no one can Comfort like you can Comfort no one can be a father to the fatherless and a husband or wife to the widower Lord or mother father for those Lord that have ones that have gone on but you can come be their portion Lord just pray that you'd pull them into your bosom tonight Lord you'd be their portion and you would comfort them Lord so many others that have lost loved ones Lord and maybe the years have gone by but they carry that with them Lord I have certain loved ones certain ones just flooding my heart right now Lord may you go to them Father and be their portion may they just feel your presence sweep into the room and pick them up once again and remind them how much you love them and that you've been the one carrying them this whole time lord we come to this portion in the service we're completely helpless without you we're looking to you the author and the finish of our faith that you would move on the scene now Lord and you just take the little thought and the words Lord and if it would be you that would come and take it and distribute it to your children then they could be edified and they can be blessed Lord and we'll give you all the praise and all the glory and honor that you deserve Lord we love you and ask these blessings in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord if you have your Bibles let's turn in Luke Chapter 2 man I've been enjoying the cooler weather I ran out the door to go to work and I I realized I wasn't properly dressed I had I had to go back in and get another layer I tell you us Texans we love it when that starts to happen yes sir but you know it might be back in the hundreds tomorrow so who knows but we we enjoy it while we can don't we amen it's just good to see all of you uh y'all just keep me in prayer it seems like we've had a little bit of a a busy schedule with our travels and some trips uh also coming up um so please just uh remember us we covet your prayers and we long to be in Fellowship here with you and I got to think and I I don't know if I want to keep telling you that I want to I'd like to be here more often the more I tell you it seems like the further I'm away so I thought maybe I'd do the the opposite but you can't you can't trick God so I just want to be where he wants me to be and uh uh uh just uh serve the body how I can serve him so um but let's just turn in our Bibles there Luke Chapter 2 and 25 and 26 it says while you turn there uh Luke 2:25 and 26 it would read like this and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was a just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and we can turn all also over to Revelations 3 and14 and I'm I'm trying to speak on a little thought uh the amen and uh the subject is revelation is reality uh just pray God would would take the thought and distribute it to your heart as you so need and Revelations 3 and 14 it says in unto uh Revelations 3 and14 and unto the Church of Lady oia write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God Amen you may be seated I just love that phrase how he says the amen and if you were to to look that up into um into the Greek and even look up the word amen one of the things they would say about the amen it would be something as the scriptures would be being read that the people would respond back and say Amen which would be making you say that you want to that word to become part of you or you are one with that word so if you've ever wondered why we say Amen it's because we we are one with that word we're saying am amen I believe it I'm one with it and so brother Brandon would say this just in um laying a foundation on the amen we're just maybe in in one way trying to uh for the sake of time trying to pull don't have the time to lay the foundation in in the the thought of the amen as we would move into our subject but uh just briefly on that in the ladyo and church age he said my isn't that the most wonderful description of the attributes of our lovely Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so uh the prophets referring to the scriptures that we just read he says these words just make me want to shout they bring such a spirit of reality into my heart and and you know something you talk about a reality it it's many times we perceive reality with what we would call our five senses or touch taste see smell but you know faith that six sense is a greater reality we've been taught of that and so as he says they they bring such a spirit of reality in my heart uh the believer has a greater reality than the reality that is surrounding us through what we can discern with touch taste feel smell hear and all of these things uh though they have such great impact on our being and and such great influence on our lives there's something far superior beyond that inside of the believer which is Faith and he says just reading them without even waiting for a thorough revelation of the spirit upon them Thrills me Jesus is giving us the description of himself in relation to the last age the days of grace are winding up he has looked from the first century right through the 20th and told us all things concerning these ages before he reveals the characteristics of the last age to us he gives us one final look at his own glorious and supreme deity this is the Capstone revelation of himself I love that because it's in this age that we receive the Capstone revelation of his person it says thus saith the amen Jesus is the amen of God oh I love that Jesus is the amen of God Jesus is the soul Let It Be of God Amen stands for finality it stands for approval it stands for prevailing promise it stands for unchanging promise it stands for the Seal of God I say Amen oh Jesus is the amen of God thus saith the amen Jesus Christ he got the last word to say his word is final his word is absolute absolute means it's perfect in itself ultimate in its power that's the all of it that settles it so heavens and earth will pass away but God's word will never pass away he has the final say he is the Amen brother Brandon would say in an absolute he says there's got to be somewhere that somebody's word is final amen I feel real good right now Glory Hallelujah there's got to be something that's final I'm so glad of that oh now there's somebody who can say is sin or it's not sin I'm so glad of that I'm glad for an absolute no arguing no need of arguing husbands and wives no arguing no need of arguing there's nothing to argue about don't don't let Satan disrupt your home and your family life and your marriage and get into an AR there's nothing to argue about hey you might say brother Matthew I have I have a much to differ with you if you were in my home last night there is much to argue about no if if I would say in the middle of your argument one of you can say honey I'm wrong you're right can I pray with you now if if if the spouse doesn't have a bad attitude and just thinks you're start trying to be uh self-righteous I guarantee you that'll change the atmosphere real quick if you got any spirit of God in you say you know what honey I'm sorry let's let's pray there there's no need to argue you know we we always you know I mean I say there is no re you know I never heard my parents I never heard my parents argue my whole life and uh and and that had a big effect on me and so you know me and my wife we've never argued there's nothing argue about because I'm always right no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding that was a joke but you know I say that if you have the spirit of Christ what's there to argue about I'm wrong he's right I ain't got no thought coming you know and why we we're not even going to get started you know uh uh because a lot of times if you start you you start to feel like there's a difference of you you know you realize your family is just a reflection of yourself you know and and I I I I I I say this with all humility you know I was given one of my daughters a good you know uh tongue lashing if you will and I was letting them know you know you you know how it is parents you try to do everything for them and sometimes you just feel like you know they they they got a little too good and and and you realize that's what life is all about is because you want them to have more than you had and then when they have more than you had they can't appreciate what you had because they never didn't have it so it's kind of like you know it's kind of like you want them to like not have anything so they can appreciate what they have but that that's just not how life works and so sometimes you're like you know what you you need to appreciate things you're you're you're you're spoiled you you have all these things and everything's done for you and and you don't appreciate it you know and then and then I I you know as as I'm talking maybe I haven't done a good job myself and help teaching these things you know and then you come away about from that and you start thinking about it you're like I'm I'm the spoiled brat here you know that's me I mean my family is a reflection of myself I'm the I'm the spoiled one right in here Lord you've done everything for me and what am I doing for you you know what am I arguing about what am I fussing about Lord you You' you you gave your life for me you sacrificed and gave all for me I'm the one that's spoiled rotten over here enjoying the blessings of the Lord going here and going there and say Lord forgive me let me get on my knees Lord say Lord I'm sorry I I'm the one that needs your grace I'm the one that needs your help Lord let let me get down to that place that Jesus got to where not my will Lord but thy will be done you know there there's no need for arguing he goes on to say the ire said strike that's what it is Mark it up in your mind it's a strike go on When God says anything thing that's the way it is no need of arguing about it that's what he said he said so that's the Christian's absolute that is if he is a Christian God said so do it this way that's the way it's got to be done no arguing if the church doors are [Music] open you go to the house of God no arguing ain't nothing about it God said so that settles it that's the absolute to the real believer that's our absolute that's our amen of Our Lives the so let it be I just thought on these things you know when you're building a house and and you you might get into a place where uh you have contractors and Builders and framers and everything and they're they're putting in oh this makes me this just makes me smile talking about this now that I think about it but you're putting in the doors and you're putting in the windows and everything well you know you could say well the door needs to be this high or that length or I need to frame it in here or or this way uh uh and and you know the framer or or the carpenter they could argue all they want about it but there should be an absolute should be there should be blueprints that after all the fighting well no I think it should be BL let me go to the absolute and see what the absolute says and then when you come back to the blueprint one of you is going to say okay you were right I was wrong or we both were wrong but one thing we know is right and it is the the blueprints the blueprints are telling you how the job has to be done and there's no arguing about it you can't come back and say Well it said they said these were 70 and and uh you know but that's just what the blueprint says but I'm the one that's right well I'm so glad that this is unchanging the message of the hour is unchanging what he said is what he meant it doesn't need man's interpretation on it what it needs is a revelation we if we if we want to be up to code and pass inspection then we got to follow the blueprint we know that God's word is the blueprint that should be what governs your life no matter what anybody else says what anybody else does so just continuing on in this or this is backing up a few paragraphs in the absolute he says and we know he's alive because here he is with us in the power of his resurrection doing the same things he did when he was here on Earth I'm tied to that ultimate that's the end of all Strife I'm tied to it that's my life I was a sinner when Christ saved me I met something and since that came into me it's been different I'm tied to it everything that I am is tied right there you got to have an anchor you got to have something that you're tied to an experience on the backside of the desert where you've met Jesus Christ him personally what is the new birth of the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally and you're tied to that not to just an experience of a day gone by but it's a living experience that keeps you every day all day 247 it's not just something that oh I had the experience like going on vacation like I was there you know we just made a trip to San Diego I was in San Diego but when I come back I couldn't bring San Diego with me even though it's in my memory but I'm so thankful when meet the Lord Jesus Christ I don't know I don't care where you meet him if you met him in Louisiana if you met him in San Diego Montana Africa I don't care where you met him when you leave he's with you because he said I'll be with you even in you until the end so that experience is a lifegiving fountain that is always present with you not something that Fades and goes but but it's it's welling up like that little Fountain uh uh uh you know what makes you're so happy little Fountain is it because I come by and drink from you is it because the deers come by and they drink out is it because of the sunrise that comes up in the morning that makes you bubble what is it that makes you so happy oh if you only knew sir there's something way down deep on the inside of me it's just a bubbling and bubbling and pushing up and pushing up that's the reality of Revelation in the believer's life and you're tied to that oh it ends all Strife it's your ultimate I'm tied to that that's my life I was a sinner when Christ saved me I met something and since that came into me it's been different I'm tied to it everything that I am tied right there and then God separating his life let me live in him and him and me then we're tied right there and then it don't make any difference what others want to believe to the individual you are tied to that that's your ultimate that's the last word hallelujah remember that where's the greatest battle ever fought it's in your mind pastor's been going through how can I overcome look we're tied to an absolute we're tied to the [Applause] word that's the last word and then if he is the word then this must be the last word this must settle it whatever that says that's the Scarlet thread makes me want to preach on Rahab for a little bit certain judgment certain Doom was coming but she received an absolute she received a promise that said look if you just hang the Scarlet thread from your window it sounded pretty far stretched but when you get in desperation you're willing to try anything when you get desperate you'll you'll try to turn over every Le you'll try to do everything one thing she couldn't deny something in her heart knew that their God was God and there was nothing that could stand and if you're telling me that you'll spare my household if I hang this Scarlet thread out the window then I'm going to pack this thing out I'm going to get everybody in this thing that I can I tell you it's time Church get everybody in that you can if you got loved on you got neighbors you got people you love get them under this Scarlet thread tell them God tell them about the message it's God's provided way that is Christ and anything contrary to that I know nothing about it that's what we want to know is what this word says for I'm tied to Christ and Christ is the word you get it now and the portion of his word that's lotted for this day his holy spirit is here to manifest that portion of word now just focus on that for one minute his holy spirit is here to manifest that portion of the word the word lotted for this day and I just want to say many times we might think of that in such a maybe a generic way and if we're not careful we think of when he says the word lotted for this day well we know that we have received the fullness of the word so it's not just a portion of the word we have received but we have received the fullness of the word but what I want to say is because we have received the fullness of the word then everything that you have need of is available to you so make it personal wherever you are at in your life if you can find out what the portion of the word that God is lighting for you this evening in your trial in your situation God has ordained a word specifically for you that will minister to your need that will answer your questions that will bring you Deliverance that will bring you salvation that will comfort you that will encourage you that will keep you that will carry you that'll make you figure out your job situations and your family situations and maybe things look so dark you don't want to understand it but I want to tell you according to the word of the Lord the holy spirit is here to manifest that portion of the word that is lotted to you for this day that you are now living but I want to say you have to recognize it you want to identify with it you want to lay claim to it you want to speak it you want to believe it yes the prophet of God would preach messages like hearing recognizing acting on the word of God and recognizing your day and its message that should produce such a spirit of reality an expectation that puts you into action and he said the prophet said in one message he says look what we've seen in this day it should put you into action look you're you're living for Rapture that's right you're living for body change you're living to see your loved one saved you're living to see God heal your neighbor that's what eternal life is it's living for others that's what we're living for and there ought to be such a spirit of reality I don't want to go so carnal but when I was out in the world there were certain things uh that I uh used as a substitute a and some of them were more powerful than other things and and and you know those are the things you wanted to share kind of like a good meal best place you've ever eaten you kind of want to share it we got something to share we got the greatest thing the planet has ever seen I mean it it is it is the remedy for every problem it is the remedy for for every uh uh Injustice it is the remedy for every complex it's the remedy for every fear every family situation every job problem every Financial need every crisis every indifference I don't care what it is whatever you have need of there's a portion of word in the hour that we're living that if the Holy Spirit can just bring the reality into your life oh it changes everything because by that Revelation it presents a new reality oh Hallelujah yeah that's why people look at you like you're crazy because you are not depending on the ways of man you're not depending on the economy you're not even depending on your job I remember one time I worked for a corporation downtown and the office was up in this big uh highrise and and I told these people look I don't work on Sundays and so uh they honored that they were they were they were they were great they honored never made me and and I said uh sometimes the hours that we're parking cars for these really fancy restaurants out there and sometimes you know it would go to midnight and I was so fanatical I said look H you know I was young still fanatical though I said I don't work at 12:01 a.m. because it's Sunday I don't work on Sunday it's just I'm a Nut so they said fine and so every day right right at 11:59 if it was on Saturdays or something like that and I was I was working late I was gone well I worked there six seven months or something like that I can't remember how long and and uh it came and my my manager came to me and said hey I just want to let you know uh you're scheduled to work this Sunday I'm like well there must be a mistake here I said because I don't work Sundays he said well we've been good to you have we not yes we've given you up to the 11:59 we've let you off every single time I said you have he said well so alls we're asking of you it's just this one day one one day out of the whole year we need your help said well I apologize I'm not able to help you he's like okay well I'm going to need you to speak to the owner of the company I said no problem so uh Brian brings me all the way up this big high highrise uh maybe not you know I don't know 15 20 stories or so in Turtle Creek over there in Dallas really nice area big office coming uh the the the windows looking out oh my just this you could have lived in this office this thing was gorgeous you know they bring me in there sit me down and and RPS like okay what uh and Brian standing over there sit down he's in his big chair you know and I tell you what what's the beautiful thing about the word of God is is when you're tied to something nothing can move you I I I'm sorry I'm unmovable and I want to say not not because something I've done no sir but I'm living in a different reality see I I'm not living in your reality so he he said well h h h uh Brian let me know that um we all of these things we've been really good to you but I just want to let you know you know as the owner of the company we we've done uh uh really uh worked hard to provide for you and everything but all I need is I just need you to work uh uh this one one Sunday or I'm going to have to fire you I said okay RP I said well I understand I can quit if that would make it easier for you or if you need to fire me that's fine but I don't work on Sundays and it was in that moment that that owner realized that I was unmovable and so he realized right quick that he was going to lose a good employee or he had to backtrack on his word and so you know what he did he backtracked on his word he did something that God could never do God can never Backtrack on his word so that if you take him at it I promise you he'll take care of you if you stand for truth if you stand for righteousness if you say I am anchored I am tied to an absolute I'm standing on the unfailing Word of Promise and I will not move I cannot be moved and nothing's going to take me off the sure Word of Promise right God will back up his word you got to recognize it it gots to be a reality to you not just the mechanics of the word the word is the mechanics but there has to be the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost to come upon the believer's life and make that word live I I uh I tell you sometimes when you when the word just starts to unfold and it all starts tying together you realize that you can't come out here and preach wisdom versus faith and absolute and and and and but but it just all starts dovetailing together and it's it becomes this one big picture and then and then you you then you're lost and you're like I don't even know what I'm going to do now as Billy makes that look like I know exactly what you're talking about but you get into all of these things and and if if if you're you know you could get into a wisdom where it's intellectual but it has to be a true faith it has to be the Holy Spirit bringing a reality or a revelation and that was what our subject uh was is that Revelation is reality where it's so evident and so clear to you that all of the obstacles they they are just be they are just predestinated victories for your life if I can say that again when you got a revelation when faith has anchored in your heart and in your soul every obstacle and every hindrance is just a pre destinated Victory now now some of us are struggling you're struggling in the sanctification in your life there's things that you're struggling in in your marriage you're struggling in with school some of you nobody knows about it but you're you're living the perfect Christian life before everybody else but they live they nobody knows about your secret life in your little secret world out there with your secret friends and your secret websites and all of those things but I want to tell you your secret is not HIIT from God and you know you're struggling and you know you're having a hard time and you know you're not getting the victory but I want to tell you don't feel like you have to bow to that Spirit any longer you are an overcomer you are who God said you are you are a believer in all of those obstacles all of those Devils all of those hindrances are just predestinated victories that you are called to overcome and all's God needs you to do is come to the revelation of who you are remember in overcome you got to recognize the devil and him real some of you just need to realize hey that's the devil I realize I'm wasting my time and that thing is the devil it's robbing me of my time it's robbing me of my my prayer life it's robbing me of my joy and it's about time you recognize the devil and him real and then what's the next thing you do you recogniz that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world now you are stepping into the Realms of overcoming and the reality that revelation will produce in your life I we could just go on in those subjects of how Paul would go through the scriptures and start to say what shall we say to these things if God before us who could be against us David would say though though a host shall encamp against me Hallelujah though War should rise in this shall I be confident one thing I've have desired all the days of my life that I shall dwell in the house of the Lord all of his enemies would stumble and fall what shall separate us from the love of God shall famine Str what is it nothing so anything that's trying to keep you or to hinder your walk with God is just a predestinated victory Goliath was just a predestinated victory for David that dumb devil just didn't know it he showed up on the wrong Battlefield that day it looked like he was a great big obst guy he was just a great big testimony that's what I love about the woman at the well what looked like a great big uh uh miserable life with all kind of failures and and she was a reproach to the whole town oh my goodness Hallelujah when the son of man brought the Revelation to that predestinated seat she entered into a different reality she was living in in a reality of condemnation she was living in a reality of fear and dread and remorse and discouragement and Outcast but once she met the master once she met the I am once she met the amen the so let it be it changed her reality so much so that her past became her Victory so much so she ran back into the town and said come see a man the town would have thought well why would you want to brag about that oh you don't understand I'm living in a different reality there's something in my soul that has been quickened and I have been changed faith is our Victory faith is a revelation real Faith knows no defeat it cannot be defeated even death itself can't be defeated it knows no defeat trials knows defeat but Faith knows no defeat it cannot be defeated and it's the only way that you can please God for without faith it's impossible to please him amen Hebrews 10:23 says let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised now I like this I want to focus on this for a moment he says let us hold fast the profession of our faith without waving for he is faithful that promised who made the promise the amen Jesus Christ the creator of heavens and Earth he made the promise who's given you the promised word who's given you this message who said I will not leave you I won't forsake you who's promising you Rapture who's promising you body change it's the I am it's the great Creator it's the soul Let It Be it's the amen of God he's made you this promise so then let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for the one who made the promise he's faithful to perform that remember in our text we read amen stands for finality it stands for approval it stands for prevailing promise it stands for unchanging promise it stands for the Seal of God now I could promise you a million dollars but I want to tell you up front don't get excited because I don't have it to give to you are we clear all right kid I'm going to no I bet I got to be a man of my word so I'm not going to promise you a million dollars cuz but if I did I don't even have it to give to you now if Elon Musk or some billionaire said hey I'm going to give you a million dollars I would say somewhat you could be hopeful I mean right I mean he said it I mean he got because he got he gots it to give right I mean if somebody how many times you said had somebody tell you they'd give you something and they don't even have it to give right it's like oh sure okay I'll catch you next time I'll give you another IOU right it can happen but if you're talking to somebody who has the goods that's why you go to a store because they got the goods they have something to give to you now Elon mus one of these guys they could promise something but you know what they could be lying but my Bible tells me that God is not a man that he should lie so then if he made a promise I say there ought to be something in the believer's heart that ought to start getting excited and start expecting something to take place look when I tell my kids I'm going to take them out for ice cream you know what they get excited and if I forget to take them you know what they do they remind me dad you said you said well I want to tell you I'm a man on I I can lie I can make a mistake but God is not a man God cannot lie and if he gave you a promise he is Duty Bound by that oath to perform that which he promised then I say as a child of God if we can get excited about ice cream I say the children of God should get excited about healing should get excited about Rapture should get excited about body change should get excited about saving our families and the lost we should get excited about our bills getting paid have your bills ever gotten paid when there was no way to pay it why because your father is not a liar he owns a cattle on a thousand hills he'll meet your need every time and the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere any place on any grounds every time that is the reality of Revelation in the word of God who made the promise well all of these things are laying in the word all of the words of predestination you being the bride without spot and without R wrinkle I I want to just say this if God says he's going to take you somewhere or if there is a word that is lotted for this age and you see I am in this condition over here but I see in God's word that he's calling me to a higher realm or he's calling me to walk from this Dimension or from this position or from this condition I see something in the word faith something's drawing me I want to live in that then God has to provide you the vehicle to get there and and he didn't leave us a car with no gas in it he didn't leave us a Cadillac with flat tires this car gots not only the mechanics it gots the Dynamics it gots the spark in it all you got to do is just put the key of faith in there and get to Raven on that thing it'll take you from point A to point B cuz my God don't lie thank you Lord amen so this is where it always happens you think you're going to be short and so look at Hebrews 11:11 here this is just thinking about that thought right go God's going to be the way he he that made the promise is faithful so so the promise is only as good as the promise Giver oh my and that's what Abraham saying look the one that made the promise is able to perform it and the one that made the promise cannot lie then therefore it produced an expectation in Abraham and that was his reality contrary to every other feeling or emotion there was a reality of Revelation that he was living in that was so contrary to the doctors to the neighbors to the people it in the the grocery markets and everything everybody thought the guy was crazy and you know I think it's good that people think you're crazy every once in a while because then it means that you're showing what you believe because we are an odd Bunch so much so the prophet had to preach a message called the Oddball makes me feel a little better I understand why I've been this way my whole life I never fit into the world I never fit into all those things but because I'm an oddball so looking at this here in Hebrews 111 everybody there we'll try to somehow wind up quickly Hebrews 11:1 says through faith also Sarah received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of child when she was past aged because she judged him faithful who had promised this is exactly what we just read in in Hebrews 23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised right here it says through faith Sarah re herself received strength to conceive and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised she recognized the one who made the promise before before she recognized who it was she laughed [Applause] when MDC was standing in the tent door she laughed because she lacked the revelation of who it was veiled come on if Sarah knew who that was she'd have been acting more like Abraham what happened out there in them PLS of mamory in that little tient door some old crazy guy washing the dirty feet of a Dusty traveler all the church world would look at that and laugh what what is this going on Abraham what are you getting so excited about reminds me of the story brother Ram tells about the two farmers one of them had a had a an old rickety Barn that was all falling down he had a little C out there and there was just alala hey growing everywhere the place looked like a shanty and next door that farmer he was in his big uh Cattle barn and he he was in these big fancy tractors and everything and that cow that fancy uh bar and he he got to walking out on that concrete one day and and kind of looked out through the crack of the fence and he saw some calf over there just running around and kicking up his hill Hills and enjoying himself and all the AL alha hey and the prophet of God said he just looked at the little calf with my can you believe the fanaticism because he was putting all his stock into all his buildings and all the fine things around him but that little calf he might not have had a big church he might not have had a big uh a big fancy car he might not have had something but one thing he had was plenty of food he had plenty of vitamins and he was just feeding and feeding kicking up his Hills and he was basking in the sunlight and feeding on the fresh man ho I tell you Church we're feeding on Fresh Mana tonight we're not depending on the four walls and some religious organization to get us through no we're basking in the sunlight of God's word what was Abraham all excited out there for because the amen of God showed up MDC showed up and I just I just want to uh focus on this if you think about what it was there it was all seven Redemptive names wrapped up and veiled in a Rob of Flesh I tell you if Abraham had a need for the day and hour that he was living in the the ones whose feet he was washing had the goods that's why he called him Lord called him Elohim Jehovah God and I want to say this this just runs a little bit I I was able to catch some of the services the brothers preached and I just encouraging him I and my soul so just pull these things together uh uh because this is this is just my just think of this how did Sarah receive strength because she judged the oneall she realized something that she didn't have a full revelation of before give me the Liberty to say that because she wouldn't have laughed but something transpired where something in her heart realized the one who stood there in that tent door and said according to the time of life something in her heart finally struck that was Elohim that was Jehovah God and I want to say this how did Sarah receive strength because the one who made the promise was the strength strength Giver I will give you strength I will give you faith I will make you an overcomer then if he said you you start reading rapturing faith and you start reading certain things and you let the wisdom of your mind totally defeat you but when he says it's going to take a greater Faith than we all we've ever had you should get excited because that means he's going to give you a greater Faith it's not a challenge if you can muster up rapturing Faith it's a promise I'm giving you rapturing faith I'm giving you body change I'm giving you your family I'm giving you your health I'm giving you your husband I'm giving you strength why because I'm El Shari I'm Jehovah God it's not a challenge if you can muster up something he said I'm here to give it to you look at Mary we can identify with Mary when the angel of the Lord appeared unto her Mary Thou Art highly favored and I love this if you turn over to your Bible in think uh Luke Luke 1 it says it says in the angel in uh Luke 1:28 it says and the angel came in unto her and said hell Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee that makes me want to run circles in the church right there Mary the Lord what what did I do what is It Something I Said is it something I did well it's because of who I've made you you see you were in my mind before I ever formed the world that I was going to come to you on this road in this hour in this season and I would be the one that was with you I I've been the one that's been leading you I've been the one that's been keeping you the Lord is with you it goes on and she was troubled at the same and and the angel said un her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shalt call his name Jesus oh my oh these words can you even fathom it well you are no different than Mary he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of the kingdoms there shall be no end and I love this question here because this is a great saying she's not doubting she's just like this is a tall order come on what about you you God's called you to do something that's never been done we can see it in types of in the scripture but God has promised you body change God has promised you to be an overcomer God has promised you for you to put death under your feet God has called you to live in the most wicked age the world has ever seen and overcome come out pure spotless come on that's a tall order you mean I'm me you look you got the wrong guy cuz if you knew what I already did it's too late for that no WR reality see the angel of Lord is bringing a different reality to Mary Mary said how can this be seeing that I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God oh Church the holy Holy Ghost you have found favor with God why because the Lord is with you he's been keeping you watching out over your life how can these things be the Holy Ghost has been overshadowing you your whole life me have perfect Faith how can this be the strength Giver the one who gave the promise is the one who's with you he says for with God nothing shall be impossible you did not receive the promise of a man you have received the promise of the amen just like Abraham just like Abraham received the promise what did it do it put him in expectation I I'm just going to call for the musicians there's no way to finish the prophet of God says first month pass no different second month first year second year how you feeling dollar no different glory to God it's going to be a bigger Miracle than it was two years ago there's the expectation somebody somewhere has been believing for something and if you can step into another reality and say I've been praying for one year two year three year four years something ought a wh up in your heart say it's going to be a bigger Miracle now than it was ever going to be because he who made the promise is faithful he's El ey he's the pry God he's the strength [Applause] Giver hallelujah how do you know God said so that settles it if God said so that's there's no more to be said about it he said so and after a 100 years old he still believed God that God would do it the Bible said in Hebrews 4 Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong giving praise unto God can we play the Revelation song I think we sing that g we are Abraham's seed now this might sound like a shock but I want to bring you into another reality if If Abraham didn't stagger then you are not going to stagger you say brother Matthew I already have I've fallen flat on my face yeah we all have but there's a bumper of blood Hallelujah there's a bumper of blood that's covering over you that when you fall flat on your face you say Lord forgive me I'm sorry and right then you we ain't catholic's Church you ain't got to do penants you ain't got to grobble you ain't got to crawl up to this altar if something in your heart says I believe that settles it hallelujah amen [Music] amen thank you Lord get back up up keep believing yes sir you are a Believer that's right somebody here needs to hear this you are strong you are strong then be like Abraham giving praise unto God you say brother Matthew I don't feel strong that's okay in your weakness it's not your boast it's not see what I can do it's judging him faithful oh I might have laughed in my heart because I didn't recognize who the son of man was I didn't surrender my life to this message cuz I really didn't know who Malachi 45 was but now I'm walking into a greater reality I'm catching the revelation of the son of man that that wasn't just a man come on hallelujah oh I got to get to my burden hallelujah oh there's just so [Music] much we were talking about prevailing promise I just try to get down to [Music] there because so many times we try to do it with our [Music] works what good is your your work's going to do if he said many on that day we say Lord did I not did I not did I not but depart from me I never knew you so what makes the difference he knows you and I know him and he wrote my name on the Lamb's Book of Life and I believe it I believe it amen amen I believe therefore if I believe it he's given me a prevailing promise you know what Prevail means it means to Triumph it means to conquer yes sir you know in the court systems the judge has the final say you realize the great architect has come down the mighty [Music] one Revelations 10 1-7 has come down said you're sinless you never did it in the first place uhuh case closed I have the last word see you keep wanting to interject quit using the devil's word but I did but I this but no no more arguing some of us just need to quit arguing with what he said and said Lord if you said it if I'm Healed I'm Healed if I'm a believer I'm a Believer if I'm set free I'm set free if I got my my family I got my family if I got my daughters I got my daughters why because the I am the judge has come down the amen of God has come down and said case dismissed it's all over you're Justified you are going in the Rapture let's all [Music] stand fear not do not be afraid I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever more what is there to fear the Judgment that fell upon the cross at the grave and when he descended was for us he absorbed the full brunt of the wound of sin and there is there now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus see for assurity our attorney is our judge he is both attorney and judge and as judge the case is settled it's finished no more condemnation somebody needs to walk into that reality tonight you've been arguing you've been fussing you've been questioning am I bride am I this I Fallen quit arguing no more arguing the judge has spoken you are forgiven you are my bride you are predestinated you are going in the Rapture now all you need to do is judge him faithful yes be like Sarah and say you know what that was more than a man that was Elohim that was elshad ey that was the Wicked one that was

I just I want to just read this as it just in my heart with some of the things and needs that were there they just slowly play Play Pour Your Spirit out on [Music] me our text was was Simeon I said the Holy Spirit was upon him I just want to read this because brother brandom said the the same holy spirit that led Simeon to believe believe that is the same holy spirit that leads you to believe in Divine Healing no no two Spirits just one and that same holy spirit that revealed to him that he wasn't going to die until he seen the Lord's Christ that same Holy Spirit speaks to you there is a power of God that heals the sick it's that plain you can't make it any planer there is a power of God that heals the sick there's a power of God that set you free there's a power of God that delivers you there's a power of God that saves you and listen to what he said the same spirit that led Simeon to believe before he even believed he was being led I didn't just wake up one day and believe the message he was leading me to believe thank Lord friends don't you realize he's been leading you the whole time he's been leading you to believe and now as you're coming to this word just say Okay Lord be it unto me according to Thy word you know let's sing an old standby I I I uh I just feel to sing only believe I just want to water in these prayer requests I'm serious needs I love the oldtime

heart you know let me say this this is the faith that was once delivered to the Saints the scripture says that we have to contend for that the faith in the impossible you know the it's the enemy who want us to live by intellect how can I obey this what do I need to do 10 steps to that no the faith that was once delivered to the Saints was they believe in the impossible and they knew that God was able to bring it to pass that's what we live by we didn't become Christian by intellect so therefore we can continue by intellect we need this faith when something is impossible you say Lord this is impossible for me I need you and he comes on the scene and he makes it possible amen but Jose for could just come in this m us tonight amen [Music] let's [Music] [Music] pray for [Music] [Music]
