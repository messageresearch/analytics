[20:49] amen
[20:51] amen amen want to welcome everyone in
[20:54] the house of God are you happy to be in
[20:56] the house of God this morning amen am
[20:58] man you may turn around and welcome
[20:59] someone as you invite brother been for
[21:01] our Psalm rating this
[21:16] morning God bless
[21:21] you you know as I was
[21:25] uh going throughout the week this past
[21:28] week and uh just what brother Tom had
[21:31] ministered about on Sunday really it
[21:34] really hit home for me the especially
[21:37] speaking of the way you
[21:39] know the path there you know it's in you
[21:42] to know the city placed in you knows you
[21:46] may not know just yet but you the
[21:47] Revelation
[21:49] coming and uh it's it
[21:52] just it made it stand out to me when
[21:54] brother brandham speaks and says that if
[21:56] you have eternal life you've always had
[21:58] eternal life you know that's that's just
[22:01] a something that really struck so I was
[22:03] diving into that sermon that day on
[22:05] Calvary and uh a quote that really stood
[22:08] out to me brother brandham says in
[22:10] paragraph 141 have your day at Calvary
[22:14] God will have his way with you and he
[22:16] says let me quote that again to
[22:18] emphasize have your day at Calvary God
[22:21] will have his way with you and sometimes
[22:24] we we look at our our mistakes our
[22:27] faults where we fall short and it's easy
[22:30] when we look at it that way
[22:31] legalistically you you're not going to
[22:32] find a a solution that you like because
[22:35] the wages of sin is death so anytime you
[22:38] you find yourself in a in a condition
[22:41] where you feel ashamed or disappointed
[22:43] in yourself brother Brandon wants to
[22:45] point out to you that it's it's what he
[22:47] did at Calvary when you just when you
[22:50] accept that then God can finally start
[22:52] using you just accepting that you know
[22:54] all this my sins my fs and mistakes they
[22:57] were settled there there the sin
[22:58] question was erased then you know that
[23:01] brought me to Psalm
[23:04] 27 the scripture
[23:06] says hear oh Lord when I cry in in verse
[23:09] 7 with my voice have mercy also upon me
[23:13] and answer me when thou sest seek ye my
[23:16] face my heart said unto thee thy face
[23:18] Lord will I seek that's right hide not
[23:20] thy face far from me put not thy servant
[23:23] away in Anger thou has been my help how
[23:27] many can attest to Christ being your
[23:30] helper leave me not neither forsake me
[23:32] oh god of my salvation and that you know
[23:37] that's I believe that's each and every
[23:39] single one of our
[23:41] cries each and every single one of our
[23:43] cries when we have need of something is
[23:45] I always asking the Lord and say Lord
[23:48] don't leave me here don't leave me in
[23:50] this condition I believe if you're a
[23:52] seed and you make that cry there's
[23:53] always a response he doesn't leave you
[23:56] alone he doesn't let you dwell now this
[23:58] the response may not come in the time
[24:00] that you'd like it to come but it's on
[24:01] its way so if you would read with me
[24:05] Psalm
[24:06] 27 we'll start with verse one the Lord
[24:10] is my light and my salvation Whom Shall
[24:13] I Fear the Lord is the strength of my
[24:16] life of whom shall I be afraid when the
[24:19] wicked even my enemies and my foes Came
[24:22] Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled
[24:25] and fell though in host should against
[24:28] me my heart shall not fear the war
[24:31] should rise against me in this will I be
[24:34] confident one thing have I desired of
[24:36] the Lord that will I seek after that I
[24:39] may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[24:42] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[24:44] of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[24:47] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[24:50] me in his Pavilion and the secret of his
[24:52] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[24:55] me up upon a rock and now shall mine
[24:58] head be lifted up above mine enemies
[25:00] round about me therefore will I offer in
[25:03] his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will
[25:06] sing yay I will sing praises unto the
[25:09] Lord hear oh Lord when I cry with my
[25:11] voice have mercy also upon me and answer
[25:15] me when thou sest seek ye my face my
[25:18] heart said unto thee thy face Lord will
[25:20] I seek hide not thy face far from me put
[25:24] not thy servant away in Anger thou Hast
[25:27] been my
[25:28] leave me not neither forsake me oh god
[25:31] of my salvation when my father and my
[25:34] mother forsake me then the Lord will
[25:36] take me up teach me thy way oh Lord and
[25:39] Lead Me in a plain path because of my
[25:42] enemies Deliver Me Not Over unto the
[25:44] will of mine enemies for false Witnesses
[25:47] are risen against me and such as breathe

[34:52] [Music]
[34:55] time
[34:58] God bless
[34:59] you I um I enjoy the message that
[35:03] brother Paul preached and in the uh
[35:06] sermon that he referred to there's a
[35:08] quote in there that just kind of gave me
[35:10] the inspiration for this song it's um
[35:13] paragraph
[35:14] 156 it says what is crucified with
[35:17] Christ is to live for others what kind
[35:20] of others those who hate you those who
[35:24] wouldn't like you those who who would
[35:27] make fun of you live for them be with
[35:30] them love them pray for those who
[35:33] despitefully use you say all manner of
[35:36] evil falsely for my name's sake they
[35:38] persecuted the prophets which was before
[35:40] you so I hope um this song is a blessing
[35:43] to
[35:44] [Music]
[35:49] you when I look back on what I thought
[35:55] was living
[35:58] I'm
[36:00] amazed at the price I chose to
[36:06] pay and to
[36:08] think I ignored what really
[36:14] matter cuz I thought the
[36:18] sacrifice would be too
[36:23] great when I finally reach the point
[36:26] point of giving
[36:31] in I found the cross was calling even
[36:40] then even though it took
[36:44] time to
[36:48] survive I've never found so much Al
[36:55] love
[36:58] for I am
[37:00] crucified with
[37:02] Christ and yet I
[37:07] live not I but Christ that lives within
[37:14] me his cross will never ask for
[37:19] more than I can
[37:24] give for it's not my strength but he
[37:29] is there's no greater
[37:36] sacrifice for I am crucified with
[37:45] Christ and yet I
[37:50] live as I hear the Savior call for daily
[37:55] dying
[37:57] [Music]
[37:58] I will
[38:00] bow beneath the weight of
[38:04] [Music]
[38:06] calary let my hand surrender to his
[38:11] piercing
[38:15] purpose the holds Me to the Cross and
[38:19] sets me
[38:23] free I will glory in the power power of
[38:28] the
[38:31] cross the things I thought were gain I
[38:36] count as
[38:37] [Music]
[38:40] lost with the sering I
[38:45] [Laughter]
[38:46] identify and by his resurrection
[38:50] power I'm
[38:52] [Music]
[38:55] alive for I am
[38:58] crucified with
[39:00] Christ and yet I
[39:05] live not I but Christ that lives within
[39:12] me his cross will never ask for
[39:17] more than I can
[39:22] give for it's not my strength but he
[39:27] is there's no greater
[39:33] sacrifice for I am crucified with
[39:42] Christ and yet I
[39:46] [Music]
[39:55] live

[54:04] word we ask these things in the precious
[54:07] name of the Lord Jesus we pray
[54:12] amen God bless you this morning if you
[54:15] have your
[54:16] Bibles let's turn to some scriptures
[54:19] this morning I'm going to try to make 45
[54:23] minutes this morning if I can
[54:26] uh I guess this is the first time they
[54:28] been back in three or four
[54:30] weeks um you know whatever this is
[54:34] that's going around you know I had some
[54:37] infection in my lungs and and uh um I
[54:43] still have a little cough but I can if I
[54:46] kind of talk monotone and don't get too
[54:49] excited I I'm okay if I get excited then
[54:53] I start to cough you know
[54:55] and uh there's a lot of times I like to
[54:58] get excited so I'm going to try to
[55:03] uh stay
[55:05] mellow amen so if I start to get excited
[55:09] you guys just say
[55:10] taper taper and we'll try to taper let's
[55:14] read a real familiar scripture this
[55:16] morning let's turn in the Book of
[55:19] Malachi the fourth
[55:22] chapter and the fifth verse
[55:35] and then we're going to turn to the um
[55:40] Jude letter of
[55:42] Jude
[55:46] beloved he says behold I will send you
[55:51] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[55:55] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[56:00] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[56:03] fathers to the
[56:04] children and the hearts of the children
[56:08] to their fathers lest I come and smite
[56:13] the Earth with a curse and then let's
[56:16] turn over to
[56:22] Jude and it says in Jude
[56:27] and there's just one chapter of Jude so
[56:31] we'll call it chapter
[56:35] one it
[56:38] says
[56:40] beloved when I gave all diligence to
[56:43] write un to you of the common
[56:48] salvation it was
[56:50] needful for me to write unto you and
[56:54] exort exort you that ye should earnestly
[56:59] contend for the faith which was once
[57:03] delivered unto the Saints Amen Let Us
[57:08] bow our heads this morning Father we ask
[57:11] you to bless your word in jesus' name we
[57:14] pray amen man you may be
[57:22] seated we just came out of
[57:25] I I feel a wonderful meeting how many
[57:28] enjoyed the meeting and amen it just
[57:31] seemed like the Lord was speaking to us
[57:35] as
[57:36] a body of
[57:38] Believers and the theme of our meetings
[57:43] and I felt all the brothers just came
[57:45] right along the theme even brother Tom
[57:49] said I I had this scripture on my heart
[57:52] before uh brother McGary ever read read
[57:55] it or ever mentioned it and so I I felt
[58:00] it was a real confirmation of the
[58:03] Lord and I I I feel the Lord
[58:08] is uh wanting us to examine and to look
[58:13] at the way that we're
[58:16] going uh and not only as a church but as
[58:20] an individual you know what path am I on
[58:24] where am I going uh what is my objective
[58:29] what is the outcome of what that I'm
[58:33] doing uh you know what's what's the
[58:37] result uh going to be of of the a course
[58:41] that I've chosen or the actions that I'm
[58:46] having what is the end of it and and uh
[58:50] so A A wise man does that the scripture
[58:52] tells us that
[58:55] when a man starts a building that he
[58:58] counts his stones and he makes sure that
[59:01] he can finish it that he won't end up in
[59:04] a
[59:05] Folly uh if he's going to go into a
[59:08] battle he counts his troops and he
[59:12] counts uh what strength that he has and
[59:15] he makes a decision uh can I overcome
[59:19] this
[59:20] Foe and if he feels he can't overcome
[59:24] that foe then he uh sends out a a Envoy
[59:28] to make a peace
[59:31] offering uh and to uh say uh you know
[59:37] let us let us not lose men let us come
[59:39] to some a formulable uh agreement that
[59:44] that benefits us both that we might live
[59:47] in peace and let us resolve our
[59:51] differences and uh we we certainly
[59:55] uh we certainly don't negotiate with the
[59:58] devil but this was a uh a parable to
[1:00:03] have man examine himself if you go back
[1:00:07] and read the uh Parable it's to speak to
[1:00:10] us what way are we
[1:00:14] traveling and so that's what we uh have
[1:00:18] inspired my my heart and the path that
[1:00:22] uh what's on my heart to share with you
[1:00:26] and to uh stir up our Pure minds of way
[1:00:30] of remembrance of what it is that we
[1:00:33] want to be as a body of Believers what
[1:00:37] do we want to stand for uh what what it
[1:00:43] is that we want to
[1:00:45] represent and it came on my heart this
[1:00:48] little subject and and we're here to
[1:00:50] preach this morning I know that uh I I
[1:00:54] guess we they call it live stream or we
[1:00:58] uh uh we uh store it up what do they
[1:01:03] call that when you store something
[1:01:05] archive yeah it sounds like a tomb
[1:01:07] doesn't it but uh uh you know we archive
[1:01:12] things but uh really we're we're not
[1:01:15] here to preach to any other body and not
[1:01:18] any other place we're not here to Pastor
[1:01:22] people outside of our group in our
[1:01:25] ministry we're just here for the
[1:01:28] challenges that we face in the place
[1:01:32] that God has put us so we're we're not
[1:01:36] ministering today to be the a voice of
[1:01:40] the message throughout the land to be
[1:01:44] the uh interpreter of what uh the
[1:01:48] messenger said uh you know this is what
[1:01:51] he meant and this is our doctrines and
[1:01:54] and this is what we believe and and I'll
[1:01:58] tell you this is what he said and this
[1:02:01] is what he meant uh I have a simple
[1:02:05] thing he meant what he
[1:02:08] said and he said what he said and that
[1:02:12] can't be
[1:02:13] changed and God builds his church on
[1:02:17] Revelation not
[1:02:20] explanation and so that's what we arrest
[1:02:22] him but this thought came on my heart
[1:02:26] and I and it's uh today to uh get us to
[1:02:30] step back a
[1:02:33] moment and to think if I could use that
[1:02:38] and to
[1:02:42] consider our
[1:02:44] fathers and the faith of the early
[1:02:48] church and and realizing so I I've given
[1:02:53] this thought
[1:02:55] a
[1:02:58] title without
[1:03:01] Bible without
[1:03:03] books without
[1:03:06] tapes the
[1:03:08] Faith of Our
[1:03:10] Fathers now I want you to think about
[1:03:13] that for a
[1:03:16] moment how the
[1:03:19] church was
[1:03:21] built and what the church
[1:03:25] possessed when they didn't have
[1:03:28] Bibles they didn't have books and they
[1:03:32] didn't have
[1:03:34] tapes so they must have had
[1:03:40] something so we understand that as the
[1:03:45] church coming
[1:03:47] up from the ground because we know the
[1:03:51] church was planted in the ground unless
[1:03:56] a seed uh get be planted in the ground
[1:04:00] it shall not bloom it shall not produce
[1:04:04] fruit so we understand and we could go
[1:04:07] into this a lot deeper we'll just try to
[1:04:10] go a little bit but we know the first
[1:04:13] church was
[1:04:15] established at the day of Pentecost
[1:04:17] that's right and we realize that they
[1:04:21] were commissioned or they were told that
[1:04:25] Jesus uh told them to go into the upper
[1:04:30] room and you Terry there and wait until
[1:04:35] you are endued with power from on high
[1:04:39] cuz he told them I will not leave you
[1:04:42] comfortless but I will come again unto
[1:04:45] you and I'll be with you even in you
[1:04:51] till the end and the work works that I
[1:04:55] do shall you do also right and so that's
[1:04:59] what he told them so they they uh they
[1:05:05] uh saw
[1:05:07] that uh all of a sudden all this great
[1:05:11] Lord in Ministry they followed all of a
[1:05:14] sudden in a heartbeat was
[1:05:17] captured
[1:05:19] imprisoned beaten mocked in other words
[1:05:22] like he was nothing
[1:05:24] like he was just another common criminal
[1:05:30] that all his movement was didn't even
[1:05:33] compare to the power of Rome just the
[1:05:37] mighty political power just walked right
[1:05:40] in and said we're done with this guy
[1:05:43] we're done hearing about him Caesar is
[1:05:46] the almighty uh we rule this place and
[1:05:50] they just snatched him up they brought
[1:05:53] him before for uh uh Herod and Herod
[1:05:57] couldn't do anything with them so he
[1:06:00] sent him over to pilate and pilate said
[1:06:02] this guy's not done nothing I don't care
[1:06:05] he's just another fanatic as far as I'm
[1:06:08] concerned and they said crucify him he
[1:06:10] said sure go ahead crucify him we don't
[1:06:13] care he's nothing to us and all of a
[1:06:17] sudden there all what they
[1:06:21] thought became not
[1:06:25] so if they had an intellectual
[1:06:28] conception they said to them many times
[1:06:30] we thought that you'd be the one that
[1:06:32] restored Israel uh we thought you were
[1:06:35] him uh uh whatever their political
[1:06:38] Ambitions were whatever their what they
[1:06:42] that they thought their position was in
[1:06:45] what was going on as being disciples and
[1:06:48] being a part of this great uh uh
[1:06:51] seemingly movement all of a sudden V
[1:06:55] vanished because he didn't want it built
[1:06:58] on
[1:06:59] that he never wanted the church built on
[1:07:04] intellect so they went and
[1:07:09] they were endued with power from on high
[1:07:14] and they were given a
[1:07:16] commission to go into all the world and
[1:07:19] preach the
[1:07:21] gospel so we realize
[1:07:24] that the church was built on a
[1:07:31] commission you understand that now we
[1:07:35] know it was built on
[1:07:37] Revelation but the it was built on God
[1:07:44] carrying out what that he
[1:07:47] said and standing with his church so I'm
[1:07:51] going to read something in a moment so
[1:07:53] understand that the church was
[1:07:55] established and it went into the
[1:07:57] ground and so what happened to the
[1:08:00] church is the first thing the church
[1:08:03] lost was the
[1:08:07] spirit and it lost the spirit when
[1:08:10] nicadan ISM came
[1:08:12] in and if you go to read Jude just a
[1:08:16] little farther he says men have come in
[1:08:18] and their spots and wrinkles amongst our
[1:08:21] Feast they desire to have the
[1:08:23] preeminence among you and the individual
[1:08:27] leadership of the Holy
[1:08:30] Spirit was
[1:08:34] lost and uh uh men begin to insert
[1:08:39] themselves in between the
[1:08:42] believer and the word of God as
[1:08:47] interpreters and so the first thing the
[1:08:50] church lost was the leadership of the
[1:08:52] Holy Spirit
[1:08:54] the second thing the church lost was
[1:08:58] sanctification and we we understand that
[1:09:01] all of a sudden sanctification was
[1:09:04] replaced with
[1:09:06] rituals and uh uh
[1:09:10] ceremonies and a piety and and uh and
[1:09:16] and so there was no there was no longer
[1:09:19] a a necessity to keep one self separated
[1:09:25] from the
[1:09:26] world so to be separated didn't mean
[1:09:30] anything to be a peculiar people to have
[1:09:34] a a a holy life that begin to vanish
[1:09:38] from the church so they lost
[1:09:41] sanctification in other words they
[1:09:43] didn't put their effort into applying
[1:09:46] the token they put their effort into
[1:09:49] making sure they were at Mass to make
[1:09:52] sure that they said their their prayers
[1:09:54] that they had a prayer book because they
[1:09:57] already lost the leadership of the Holy
[1:10:00] Spirit now now they were they were
[1:10:04] losing the the part of their experience
[1:10:09] that watched what they they partook
[1:10:12] in you know that that didn't walk uh how
[1:10:17] can two walk together unless they agree
[1:10:22] so that began to leave the church and
[1:10:25] finally what left the church was
[1:10:28] justification so they lost the spirit
[1:10:31] they lost sanctification and they lost
[1:10:35] justification in other words now they
[1:10:37] were doing
[1:10:39] penants now they were lighting
[1:10:42] candles now they felt that they had to
[1:10:45] do something for their
[1:10:48] sins and so they were so
[1:10:51] separated from Calvary y that now they
[1:10:55] were they had a religious life and that
[1:10:58] whole life went into what is referred to
[1:11:02] as the Dark Ages the dark ages of the
[1:11:05] church they were ruled by nicoladis that
[1:11:09] all they their only access to God was
[1:11:13] was through uh
[1:11:15] Ministry and and ceremonies and and all
[1:11:19] kinds of religious rights and they felt
[1:11:22] if they did something wrong they had to
[1:11:24] go confess it and then go do something
[1:11:27] for that
[1:11:29] sin that was a
[1:11:32] condition of the church when it went
[1:11:35] into the
[1:11:36] ground in other words it was so far away
[1:11:40] from the original life that it was
[1:11:46] buried but now we know
[1:11:49] that God
[1:11:51] promised to re store
[1:11:55] amen so we we we we can follow the
[1:11:59] history of the
[1:12:00] church that the church went into the
[1:12:03] ground so the church lost the spirit
[1:12:07] lost sanctification and lost
[1:12:10] justification and went into the ground
[1:12:13] so if it's going to go back to its
[1:12:17] original it has to go back and start
[1:12:20] getting what it lost amen the first
[1:12:23] thing it's got to claim was the last
[1:12:26] thing it lost so the church had to claim
[1:12:31] justification they had to come back and
[1:12:33] say wait a minute the blood of Jesus
[1:12:36] Christ is what saved me that's right
[1:12:39] that's right I don't there's nothing I
[1:12:42] can do to repay my sins he paid it
[1:12:48] all and the church would never
[1:12:51] grow until it EST establish
[1:12:54] justification a Christian will never
[1:12:58] grow as long as it carries the guilt of
[1:13:01] its
[1:13:04] sin if you sit there and you're ashamed
[1:13:07] of what you did and you're ashamed of
[1:13:09] all good that's good that shame that
[1:13:13] conviction that feeling is given and put
[1:13:16] onto you to do one thing to drive you to
[1:13:22] repentance that's
[1:13:26] yes to so so that you can go there and
[1:13:29] say I'm
[1:13:30] sorry and then the word of God says if
[1:13:33] you're sorry and you're just to repent
[1:13:36] of your sins he's faithful and just to
[1:13:40] forgive
[1:13:43] you and he takes that from you and
[1:13:48] throws it in the sea of
[1:13:51] forgetfulness I know a lot of people
[1:13:53] come to it myself included we like
[1:13:57] something that we're doing and we we
[1:13:59] don't like the results we don't like how
[1:14:01] it makes it feel but we we don't want to
[1:14:04] get rid of it and when we go to repent
[1:14:07] of it we're in that mind
[1:14:10] battle to let go of
[1:14:15] it and instead of being justified we
[1:14:19] start to
[1:14:22] justify and we're just not ready to die
[1:14:25] out and let
[1:14:29] go and you know what you know what you
[1:14:33] know what happens with sin right finally
[1:14:36] the conviction and the ugliness of sin
[1:14:39] isn't worth and
[1:14:42] compared to the pleasure of the sin and
[1:14:46] finally you say the way this makes me
[1:14:48] feel I hate it I I don't want to do it
[1:14:52] and it drives you to the Lord to say
[1:14:56] Lord I'm sorry take this from me I'm
[1:14:59] sorry forgive me and he's just and
[1:15:02] faithful and says okay I'll take that
[1:15:05] off your
[1:15:06] record and then he's got to go back so
[1:15:10] we know he did that through the message
[1:15:12] of Luther and then he's got to go take
[1:15:15] the believer and establish once again
[1:15:19] with the believer the
[1:15:21] separation from from the
[1:15:25] world you just you can't go out and
[1:15:29] water your plant with motor
[1:15:33] oil you know it don't
[1:15:36] work you know what I mean you can't you
[1:15:40] you can't take your life and put it in
[1:15:43] Dark Places right and expect it to grow
[1:15:46] right so you've got to sanctify your
[1:15:50] life
[1:15:52] sanctify uh your in environment in other
[1:15:56] words there's a separation come out from
[1:15:58] amongst them and be ye
[1:16:01] separate so we understand
[1:16:04] that this process in The Believer he's
[1:16:09] got to come to realize okay God's
[1:16:12] forgiven me of my sins I'm no longer
[1:16:15] going to walk in sin I'm not going to
[1:16:18] walk after the flesh but I'm going to
[1:16:21] walk after the spirit
[1:16:24] I'm going to walk in the newness of Life
[1:16:28] yes so there I I I'm not going to
[1:16:33] partake of things that send me back
[1:16:38] into the process of guilt and
[1:16:44] shame so that's
[1:16:46] what he had to restore next so the last
[1:16:51] thing he's got to restore is the first
[1:16:54] thing the church lost for you understand
[1:16:58] what I'm trying to point to this morning
[1:17:01] is that we're on the reverse
[1:17:06] Journey okay so where we're at is we've
[1:17:10] we've been Justified we've been
[1:17:12] Sanctified we've been the spirit has
[1:17:15] been restored to us now we're moving
[1:17:18] back to that
[1:17:21] Faith of Our Father
[1:17:25] back to that church so I want I want
[1:17:30] each of you to think and place yourself
[1:17:34] back in that
[1:17:36] day where they didn't have a
[1:17:41] Bible how many knows that they didn't
[1:17:44] have a
[1:17:46] Bible now I'm not preaching this morning
[1:17:49] to get rid of your
[1:17:51] Bibles right we needed the Bible we
[1:17:55] needed the books we needed the tapes
[1:17:58] because we were so
[1:18:00] far away from the truth
[1:18:04] right that nobody had
[1:18:09] it there was no no resource no
[1:18:13] connection no anything so God sent a
[1:18:17] prophet
[1:18:20] yes in the day to be the church's first
[1:18:26] connection with that resurrected life
[1:18:29] and power what the first church
[1:18:35] possessed so now they were able to see
[1:18:39] it able to hear
[1:18:43] it and to be able to discern
[1:18:48] it now that's exactly
[1:18:51] what the first church
[1:18:54] had okay they didn't have a
[1:18:57] Bible they didn't have a book they
[1:19:00] didn't have a
[1:19:02] tape but they had a
[1:19:06] commission are you with me am I making
[1:19:09] any sense at
[1:19:11] all
[1:19:15] because sometimes I know I don't make
[1:19:18] sense but that's all right I'm going to
[1:19:21] read this little statement if I can
[1:19:26] this is on page 79 of the church age but
[1:19:29] these seven Messengers are making God
[1:19:32] known to the
[1:19:34] people okay he that receiveth them
[1:19:38] receiveth him that sent them John
[1:19:43] 13:20 they speak and act upon his
[1:19:47] authority they and he stands behind them
[1:19:52] with all the the power of the godhead
[1:19:54] Matthew 28 18 and 20 and Jesus came and
[1:20:00] spake unto them saying all power is
[1:20:04] given unto me in heaven and in Earth go
[1:20:09] ye therefore and teach All Nations
[1:20:12] baptizing them in the name of the father
[1:20:16] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:20] teaching them to observe all things
[1:20:24] whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I
[1:20:29] Am With You Always even unto the end of
[1:20:34] the
[1:20:36] world
[1:20:38] so the consummation of the ages so the
[1:20:44] so there they
[1:20:45] are full of the Holy Ghost and faith on
[1:20:51] fire with the the fire of God holding
[1:20:54] forth the word of Truth and there he
[1:20:58] stands to back them
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:02] up okay now picture this you don't have
[1:21:05] a
[1:21:06] Bible you don't have a book and you
[1:21:09] don't have the
[1:21:11] tape so you better have
[1:21:13] what an
[1:21:18] experience right you better have the you
[1:21:22] better be born again you better have
[1:21:26] what he sent them up to the upper room
[1:21:29] to
[1:21:33] get okay because now you're
[1:21:37] commissioned but you you you're you're
[1:21:40] not commissioned to go give intellect
[1:21:42] that's right you don't have a
[1:21:45] book so they can read the book and come
[1:21:48] up with a conclusion you don't have a
[1:21:51] Bible so they can study and try to put
[1:21:54] everything
[1:21:55] together you don't have a
[1:21:59] tape or a
[1:22:01] teaching you're one
[1:22:06] onone therefore the scripture said Faith
[1:22:10] cometh by what hearing and hearing by
[1:22:13] the word of God so the church was
[1:22:17] built on
[1:22:20] individuals sharing
[1:22:23] the gospel from Faith to
[1:22:28] Faith so they they couldn't just say
[1:22:33] here read this
[1:22:36] book here listen to this
[1:22:40] tape here go read Romans they couldn't
[1:22:43] do that they didn't have
[1:22:46] that and when Peter went to the gate
[1:22:49] called
[1:22:50] Beautiful he walked up to the m man and
[1:22:53] said here I have a tape for
[1:22:56] you I have a book for you I have a Bible
[1:23:01] for
[1:23:04] you now don't let anybody try to say I'm
[1:23:07] trying to do away with the Bible the
[1:23:08] books or the tapes okay if your brain is
[1:23:12] there then stay
[1:23:18] there but I want you that pet had
[1:23:24] [Music]
[1:23:25] something so he didn't give him another
[1:23:31] tool other than himself yes sir
[1:23:36] that's he said I know what I'm talking
[1:23:39] about silver and gold I don't have but I
[1:23:43] have
[1:23:45] something that I want to share with
[1:23:51] you but that which I
[1:23:54] have I give to
[1:23:57] youen that was the Faith of Our Fathers
[1:24:02] because they knew that he was standing
[1:24:06] with them to
[1:24:08] Back Him their words
[1:24:12] up their faith was in his presence what
[1:24:16] did I do with my
[1:24:19] glasses right where oh here they are I
[1:24:23] couldn't see CU I didn't have my glasses
[1:24:25] on okay so let's just follow this he was
[1:24:28] standing there to back him up and think
[1:24:32] of it not one believer of any age needs
[1:24:36] to cry in his
[1:24:38] heart oh that I might have been back
[1:24:43] there in the first age when the apostles
[1:24:47] were sent
[1:24:51] out oh how many have said
[1:24:54] that oh I wish I could have been back
[1:24:58] there
[1:25:01] no there is no need to look
[1:25:05] back look
[1:25:07] up Behold Him who is even now walking in
[1:25:13] the midst of the churches through all
[1:25:16] ages Behold Him who is the same yet
[1:25:20] there he stands
[1:25:23] expressing exactly what he is the life
[1:25:28] and sustainer and Giver of all good
[1:25:32] things to the church
[1:25:37] Hallelujah now they didn't have a
[1:25:40] Bible they had some letters from
[1:25:44] Paul that were read throughout the
[1:25:47] churches they didn't have books or
[1:25:51] tapes but but every
[1:25:53] believer that
[1:25:55] contacted another
[1:25:57] believer he had to spread the
[1:26:01] gospel with with three main
[1:26:08] elements right he had to have a changed
[1:26:15] life
[1:26:18] right there had to be some evidence
[1:26:23] that they came in contact with something
[1:26:27] that changed
[1:26:29] them and that change was
[1:26:35] evident we're talking about the faith of
[1:26:37] our early fathers see you can be
[1:26:40] backslid as a
[1:26:42] Goose and I guess that's okay to say and
[1:26:46] give someone a
[1:26:48] book or give somebody a
[1:26:51] tape
[1:26:54] fact you might even do that as some form
[1:26:57] of penance or or some sort of relief of
[1:27:06] conviction but that's
[1:27:08] not what the first church
[1:27:13] had okay they went
[1:27:17] out and they
[1:27:20] told all the world world of what had
[1:27:24] taken place in their
[1:27:29] life I heard about
[1:27:32] it these men asked me have you know they
[1:27:36] they expressed the guilt they they they
[1:27:39] they preached the gospel they they they
[1:27:42] shared the
[1:27:44] Commandments and the when I heard this
[1:27:47] my heart was
[1:27:51] pricked and I saidwell what must I
[1:27:54] do and they said
[1:27:57] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:28:00] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ The
[1:28:03] Name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:28:06] of your sins and you shall receive the
[1:28:09] gift of the Holy
[1:28:12] Ghost another they
[1:28:15] War passing
[1:28:17] off a
[1:28:20] historical or intellect ual or
[1:28:25] doctrinal
[1:28:30] religion they were motivated by love and
[1:28:33] they said what happened to me can happen
[1:28:36] to
[1:28:40] you and I'm here to pray with you to lay
[1:28:44] hands on you to be with you until that
[1:28:49] change takes place in
[1:28:55] you church has lost
[1:29:00] that it's full of
[1:29:05] substitutes they'll have a
[1:29:07] ceremony let's get let's get the piano
[1:29:10] player going I'd like to bring a piano
[1:29:12] player up here and an organ player and
[1:29:14] let's get going and and and then we're
[1:29:16] going to start singing riseing up
[1:29:19] riseing up there's a church that is
[1:29:23] rising up and up and up and up and up
[1:29:27] and up and up and
[1:29:29] [Applause]
[1:29:35] up it's a
[1:29:40] ceremony it's a
[1:29:42] substitute they didn't have a
[1:29:48] Bible didn't have a book didn't have a
[1:29:52] tape they didn't have an
[1:29:57] organ but that which they
[1:29:59] had they freely
[1:30:06] gave now this is what he's trying to get
[1:30:09] us back
[1:30:12] to the church was built on a
[1:30:16] commission go wait until you're in dued
[1:30:18] for power from high so they never let
[1:30:22] somebody get
[1:30:25] away give me a moment I got to catch my
[1:30:31] breath that felt good
[1:30:34] though haven't put that much effort out
[1:30:36] in the three
[1:30:40] weeks you understand what I'm driving at
[1:30:43] yes
[1:30:46] sir it never
[1:30:49] left the individual
[1:30:53] right he didn't bring someone to
[1:30:56] church so the church
[1:31:02] service would take the
[1:31:05] place of his commission or his duty to
[1:31:10] share the
[1:31:14] gospel it was delivered by
[1:31:17] faith to
[1:31:20] Faith I know him him I've me him I know
[1:31:25] what he's done for me let me tell
[1:31:29] you what he's done that's right so first
[1:31:32] of all there had to be a changed
[1:31:36] life is that right again I I think if
[1:31:41] you could put up on the board of First
[1:31:44] Peter 3 and
[1:31:50] 15
[1:31:53] so we have a
[1:31:56] Bible okay but
[1:31:58] now look at these
[1:32:02] scriptures as going out to people who
[1:32:05] didn't have a
[1:32:08] Bible and what that they were trying to
[1:32:11] keep in the church was the faith that
[1:32:15] was once delivered to him it says be
[1:32:20] Sanctified the Lord God God in your
[1:32:23] hearts and be ready always to give an
[1:32:28] answer to every man that ask you a
[1:32:33] reason of the hope that is in you with
[1:32:38] meekness and
[1:32:42] fear the gospel was built on changed
[1:32:47] lives of people
[1:32:49] inquiring about the
[1:32:52] transformation that had taken place in
[1:32:56] the
[1:33:00] church and and now they would say well
[1:33:03] let me tell you what happened this
[1:33:05] brother came and and he talk to me
[1:33:09] about the
[1:33:11] Lord and about the wages of sin and my
[1:33:16] heart was convicted because I didn't
[1:33:19] know it and he prayed with me
[1:33:22] and we got down and we prayed and he
[1:33:26] asked the Lord if the same spirit that
[1:33:30] was in him would come into
[1:33:33] me and I had an
[1:33:37] experience and the spirit of God Came
[1:33:39] Upon me and I was
[1:33:43] free I was free from burden I I I there
[1:33:47] was something that that welled up inside
[1:33:50] of me that made me different I felt the
[1:33:54] presence of the Lord I I I felt him
[1:33:57] speak to my heart it was a real
[1:34:00] experience it it wasn't
[1:34:02] intellectual it wasn't a conclusion that
[1:34:05] I came to it was a real
[1:34:11] change and then the gospel commission
[1:34:14] began to be carried out cuz people were
[1:34:17] inquiring what happened to
[1:34:20] you
[1:34:24] now can you
[1:34:25] imagine that if we had
[1:34:28] lives that intellectually stimulated so
[1:34:32] we become
[1:34:35] philosophers that's why it's no good to
[1:34:37] argue with
[1:34:41] somebody you know what I mean and there
[1:34:44] are certain
[1:34:45] churches you know if if you ever had met
[1:34:48] them I've dealt with them all the time
[1:34:50] you know uh uh uh you know people that
[1:34:54] are in certain denominations that don't
[1:34:57] believe in Divine Healing don't believe
[1:34:58] in Works don't believe in music they
[1:35:00] don't believe in any of that boy but
[1:35:02] they know they love to
[1:35:07] argue and that usually takes argument
[1:35:10] takes about one minute there's really no
[1:35:13] mean me talking to you because you don't
[1:35:15] know what I'm talking
[1:35:18] about there's no hunger there's no
[1:35:23] thirst there's no pull there's no call
[1:35:27] there's no
[1:35:32] seed so they didn't have a
[1:35:35] book they didn't have a
[1:35:37] Bible they didn't have a tape they had
[1:35:41] an
[1:35:42] experience now let me inject this we
[1:35:45] needed a Bible we needed a book we
[1:35:49] needed a tape cuz we were were so far
[1:35:53] from the truth there was no living
[1:35:56] Fountain but the first church had the
[1:35:59] fountain why do we have the books why do
[1:36:03] we have the tapes why do we have uh the
[1:36:08] Bible is to return us back to what they
[1:36:12] had when they didn't have
[1:36:19] it okay not the substit
[1:36:23] ude but there was those were ways for
[1:36:26] God to get to us because there was
[1:36:29] nobody hardly possessing the life at all
[1:36:33] so God had to send the
[1:36:36] light as it was in the days of Sodom and
[1:36:39] gomorah shall shall it be in the coming
[1:36:43] of the son of man they shall be light in
[1:36:47] the evening time the path the glory you
[1:36:50] shall surely fine so there was the dead
[1:36:53] Church World someone had to show up with
[1:36:58] the same life that the first church
[1:37:04] had and start pointing out in the Bible
[1:37:09] what they had
[1:37:13] lost and preaching sermons and all the
[1:37:17] books are is the sermons and
[1:37:20] writing
[1:37:22] but preaching the gospel just as they
[1:37:26] preach the gospel with signs and wonders
[1:37:29] following that the church might
[1:37:31] recognize hey we got a
[1:37:35] bogus and not an
[1:37:38] original so they had to have an
[1:37:41] experience life changing they had to
[1:37:44] have the word of their
[1:37:48] testimony
[1:37:50] right they spoke
[1:37:54] it they shared
[1:37:57] it they talked about
[1:38:01] it they went door to door person to
[1:38:04] person telling about
[1:38:06] it wow the Lord Jesus did you know there
[1:38:09] was a messiah do you know the Lord Of
[1:38:12] Glory came down we're going to all the
[1:38:14] world teaching them the things that I
[1:38:16] taught you telling them to observe the
[1:38:20] Commandments
[1:38:23] so they had to have a word of their
[1:38:26] testimony they had a
[1:38:28] life and then a
[1:38:30] word without the lives the words are
[1:38:33] just
[1:38:35] crazy I've had so many people come to me
[1:38:40] you know I was testifying to everybody
[1:38:42] at work and something came up and I got
[1:38:45] mad and I ruined my
[1:38:50] testimony I'm going to quit this
[1:38:55] job
[1:38:57] now I hope this don't offend
[1:39:01] you but that's a
[1:39:04] coward oh if there's controversy I'm out
[1:39:07] of here I'm out of
[1:39:09] here I don't want nothing to do with no
[1:39:12] controversy I don't want nothing to do
[1:39:13] with nothing you you know I mean hardly
[1:39:15] a backbone to stand up what does the
[1:39:19] scripture tell you to do if you offend
[1:39:22] somebody go to that person and say I'm
[1:39:27] sorry go to that person and said you
[1:39:29] know I've tried to live a Christian Life
[1:39:33] I failed the other day I made a mistake
[1:39:36] I shouldn't have done that would you
[1:39:39] forgive
[1:39:44] me you remember when our messenger went
[1:39:46] to the
[1:39:50] lawyer what was his
[1:39:52] answer oh I knew you was a
[1:39:55] hypocrite no he said you mean more to me
[1:39:57] now than I ever
[1:40:01] have that's what you
[1:40:04] do I'm
[1:40:06] sorry I lost
[1:40:09] it I wasn't prayed up I was grumpy Satan
[1:40:13] trapped me I'm going to try to do
[1:40:18] better but I want you to know I still
[1:40:21] believe everything I've ever said to you
[1:40:22] and I'm going to try to do better I'm
[1:40:24] going to let my light
[1:40:27] shine that's the worthier
[1:40:33] testimony that that that's what they had
[1:40:36] in fact it was so
[1:40:39] important the words that came out of
[1:40:41] their mouth because now they don't have
[1:40:45] something to speak for
[1:40:47] them or they don't have a tape to speak
[1:40:50] for them they don't have a Bible to
[1:40:52] speak for them they don't have a book to
[1:40:55] speak for
[1:40:56] them I think was it brother Murphy or
[1:40:58] somebody preached about it has its voice
[1:41:02] amen right
[1:41:04] so their
[1:41:06] life their change their experience now
[1:41:10] has a
[1:41:13] voice and that voice is coming out of
[1:41:17] their
[1:41:18] lips so if you could put up James uh 3
[1:41:22] and
[1:41:28] 10 now we look at this scripture as
[1:41:31] being in the
[1:41:33] Bible James is looking at at this
[1:41:38] scripture to tell the
[1:41:41] church don't get the fountain
[1:41:47] polluted he it's not a book it's not not
[1:41:51] a Bible it's not a tape it's a
[1:41:55] letter that he's writing to his
[1:41:59] church to make them
[1:42:02] aware that they have to protect that
[1:42:07] element in their
[1:42:11] experience because that's a
[1:42:14] means by which the commission is going
[1:42:18] to be carried out
[1:42:21] was that simple enough listen what he
[1:42:25] says out of the same
[1:42:28] mouth proceedeth blessings and
[1:42:33] cursings my brother these
[1:42:36] things ought not to be is there more to
[1:42:42] that does the fountain send
[1:42:45] forth at the same place Sweet Water and
[1:42:52] bitter can the fit tree my brethren bear
[1:42:56] Olive berries neither a Vine
[1:43:00] figs so can no Fountain both yield salt
[1:43:05] water and
[1:43:09] fresh who is the wise
[1:43:12] man endued with knowledge among you let
[1:43:16] him show out of good conversation his
[1:43:20] work works and meekness and
[1:43:26] wisdom an
[1:43:29] element that's so
[1:43:32] important to the
[1:43:36] church
[1:43:38] because they're The
[1:43:43] Voice anybody know what the bride is in
[1:43:45] this last day it's the
[1:43:49] what final
[1:43:58] voice is the last
[1:44:02] thing because he's restoring back the
[1:44:07] faith of our fathers he's giving back
[1:44:11] the church what they had before a
[1:44:16] Bible before a tape before a book
[1:44:21] before a Christian
[1:44:24] bookstore it no longer was going to be
[1:44:27] based on
[1:44:29] intellect and a personal life
[1:44:33] choice of how that they want to serve
[1:44:38] God can I go over that again it's not
[1:44:42] reading a book and hearing somebody
[1:44:45] explain how you should be a Christian
[1:44:48] and the things that you should do
[1:44:51] that you develop your own life your own
[1:44:55] way of service your own good and
[1:45:00] evil and come up with your own Christian
[1:45:04] Life this is
[1:45:07] back to an
[1:45:11] experience a
[1:45:14] conversion an upper room experience that
[1:45:18] the disciples went and passed down to
[1:45:21] the person that person passed it to the
[1:45:24] next that person T passed it to the next
[1:45:28] changing lives changing
[1:45:33] conversations the real genuine
[1:45:37] fruits back in the
[1:45:43] church what an
[1:45:45] awareness what a
[1:45:47] Consciousness and if I could say this
[1:45:51] then the last
[1:45:53] thing that they had was
[1:45:59] Works they practiced what they
[1:46:04] preached they had
[1:46:07] Works they didn't come to
[1:46:09] church and just live their
[1:46:13] life they didn't have a life of
[1:46:19] theology they didn't have a life of
[1:46:22] belief I believe this I believe that we
[1:46:25] believe this well this is what we
[1:46:31] believe we believe this and we believe
[1:46:36] that they knew
[1:46:40] him they it was personal
[1:46:46] contact the The
[1:46:49] Giver didn't pass
[1:46:54] intellect he wasn't trying to change
[1:46:56] their mind this is a quote that I could
[1:46:59] have found but it's just come to my
[1:47:00] heart because if you change somebody's
[1:47:03] mind somebody else will change it
[1:47:07] again this was the
[1:47:10] unconscious
[1:47:13] search that was in the heart of the
[1:47:16] believer to find that seed brother and
[1:47:21] sister
[1:47:25] somewhere they knew he was backing them
[1:47:28] up their faith was in his presence which
[1:47:32] they had experienced it wasn't intellect
[1:47:35] right they meant the person they
[1:47:38] experienced the person they experienced
[1:47:41] the touch they experienced the hand of
[1:47:44] the
[1:47:46] Lord they knew
[1:47:49] him they they shared what they
[1:47:52] knew they didn't pretend when they
[1:47:58] didn't and they knew he was
[1:48:02] there to back them up their faith was in
[1:48:06] his presence amen so they had
[1:48:11] Works John
[1:48:14] 13:35 they'll know that you are my
[1:48:17] disciples by your loved one for another
[1:48:23] it was
[1:48:25] evident
[1:48:28] uh back to the uh the word of their
[1:48:32] testimony Romans
[1:48:34] 10:17 Faith cometh by hearing hearing by
[1:48:38] the word of
[1:48:40] God uh and then we said in Peter they
[1:48:43] inquire of the Hope Matthew 5:116 let
[1:48:47] your light so shine AB among men that
[1:48:50] your good works might glorify Your
[1:48:52] Father in heaven then the writer writes
[1:48:55] show me your faith without your works
[1:48:57] and I'll show you my faith by my
[1:49:03] Works they they had works
[1:49:07] right so here they are without a
[1:49:11] Bible to speak for
[1:49:14] them without a
[1:49:17] tape to hear preaching
[1:49:21] without a book or a track or anything
[1:49:24] they
[1:49:24] were the Bible the tape and the
[1:49:31] book they were the only
[1:49:35] vessel they were
[1:49:39] commissioned
[1:49:41] experienced
[1:49:43] ordained Fountain of
[1:49:46] truth and
[1:49:48] light and that's what they were
[1:49:52] that's what they went into the world
[1:49:58] with they weren't
[1:50:01] letting an
[1:50:04] instrument outside of themselves do the
[1:50:09] work for
[1:50:11] them how many have heard of
[1:50:15] AI well I'm preaching about
[1:50:18] RI r artificial religion
[1:50:25] AR artificial
[1:50:30] religion done without
[1:50:34] human
[1:50:39] participation it it's not the way the
[1:50:42] church wants to
[1:50:45] go now you know I believe in plain taste
[1:50:48] my I hope my actions you can understand
[1:50:51] what I'm trying to point out to
[1:50:54] you because you want to look at
[1:50:57] yourself you want to look at your
[1:51:00] experience you want to look at your
[1:51:02] atmosphere around you you want to say
[1:51:05] how am I going am I going in the way of
[1:51:08] the early
[1:51:13] church or am I in another
[1:51:17] way have I been brought back
[1:51:20] listen to some of the scriptures that
[1:51:23] the men began to preach pray without
[1:51:30] ceasing things that are pure and good
[1:51:33] think on these things make melody in
[1:51:36] your heart Make a Joyful annoying to the
[1:51:38] Lord all those things were the
[1:51:40] instructions of the Apostles to the
[1:51:44] Believers to
[1:51:46] keep that life alive in them
[1:51:50] right so now when you read the Bible
[1:51:54] start reading it that this thing was in
[1:51:58] what time is it because I know I'm going
[1:52:00] to fade away here in a
[1:52:03] second have I am I close to 45 minutes
[1:52:08] somebody surely in here has been
[1:52:09] tracking every minute I I hear it after
[1:52:12] every service boy it was good but it
[1:52:14] sure was
[1:52:15] [Music]
[1:52:17] long well every Christian the Long
[1:52:21] Ranger or The Lone Ranger that's
[1:52:25] right is everybody
[1:52:28] good can I can I
[1:52:31] get a few more
[1:52:35] minutes okay because I want to talk to
[1:52:38] you just a
[1:52:40] second if I could about
[1:52:48] uh
[1:52:50] okay
[1:52:52] so I I just want to read this I'm going
[1:52:54] to close here with this last little
[1:52:57] thought because I want to be in this for
[1:52:58] a while is that okay with
[1:53:01] you cuz we we want to find our way back
[1:53:06] to what it was that those guys had right
[1:53:10] okay now the Pentecostal
[1:53:14] movement became a substitute
[1:53:18] right he said that not was not the
[1:53:21] latter rain and the outpouring of the
[1:53:25] spirit it was Devil's inspired men
[1:53:30] getting
[1:53:32] inspired and bringing the
[1:53:34] church to an experience that wasn't the
[1:53:38] word so I'm going to read two statements
[1:53:42] and and I'll
[1:53:43] close and I'll try to get one of the
[1:53:46] brothers to cover for me tonight because
[1:53:49] uh
[1:53:50] I'm on fire for
[1:53:52] this I might not look like
[1:53:55] it but I'm on fire for this and I'm not
[1:54:00] only on fire for me I'm on fire for
[1:54:05] you I want
[1:54:08] every person in our body to have an
[1:54:13] upper room
[1:54:15] experience in their own heart and life
[1:54:24] I want every one of us to be able to say
[1:54:27] I know my redeemer
[1:54:32] liveth I know he's real I see him in my
[1:54:37] life and I want him to have the
[1:54:42] courage to stand for him for I'm not
[1:54:46] ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:54:48] because it's the power of God under
[1:54:55] salvation if you testify of me before
[1:54:58] men I'll testify of you before my father
[1:55:03] think of all these saying to people that
[1:55:07] didn't have a book didn't have a Bible
[1:55:10] or didn't have a tape it was
[1:55:13] speaking directly to the challenges they
[1:55:18] had in this world
[1:55:24] it wasn't to stir up their mind well it
[1:55:28] was to stir up their mind back to Pure
[1:55:31] thoughts but it was dealing with their
[1:55:36] heart because the the Satan was there
[1:55:40] trying to rob them and get them away
[1:55:42] from their first love so listen to this
[1:55:46] if you can put this this is on page 82
[1:55:50] of the church age
[1:55:57] book and he says
[1:56:00] this I think we ought to stop
[1:56:03] here and deal with the thought that
[1:56:08] God's
[1:56:09] people have always been and always will
[1:56:13] be
[1:56:15] persecuted you know that Genesis
[1:56:20] is the book of
[1:56:21] beginning and what you find
[1:56:25] started there will carry right on
[1:56:29] through to Revelations and never change
[1:56:32] there we see that Cain persecuted and
[1:56:35] killed
[1:56:36] Abel because the latter pleased God I
[1:56:42] want to drop down and read
[1:56:44] this no matter how just and upright a
[1:56:48] Christian
[1:56:50] is before the
[1:56:52] public and how gracious he is to his
[1:56:57] fellow
[1:56:58] man doing not but
[1:57:02] good let him confess Christ as his
[1:57:07] Savior and
[1:57:09] acknowledge the operation of the gifts
[1:57:13] of the holy spirit in tongues prophecy
[1:57:17] healing and
[1:57:18] miracles and he will be
[1:57:21] condemned the spirit of this world hates
[1:57:26] the spirit of
[1:57:28] God now listen to this
[1:57:33] close and because it can't overcome the
[1:57:38] spirit of the Lord it tries to destroy
[1:57:43] the vessels in whom the spirit of Truth
[1:57:48] dwells
[1:57:54] man thank you
[1:57:56] Lord he can't destroy the spirit right
[1:58:00] he can't stop its power he can't stop
[1:58:04] nothing all he wants to do is crack the
[1:58:07] vessel so the spirit leaks
[1:58:11] out he wants to plug up the
[1:58:15] mouth he works on the
[1:58:17] vessel cuz it can't destroy the spirit
[1:58:20] that's Eternal so he works on the
[1:58:24] vessel so be aware of
[1:58:29] that you that's why you've got to be
[1:58:33] Sanctified and that's my weak
[1:58:38] spot it's real easy for my faith and
[1:58:41] what I believe and the Zeal to the word
[1:58:44] it makes me forget have wait a minute
[1:58:47] you got to protect this F
[1:58:53] I got a good looking truck but you can't
[1:58:55] tell it cuz it's
[1:59:00] filthy just like someone said that's a
[1:59:02] nice truck but sure should wash it what
[1:59:04] do you do you wash it you keep it clean
[1:59:07] you show your
[1:59:10] appreciation we need to show
[1:59:13] appreciation for the vessel of the Lord
[1:59:18] how many knows the scripture that that
[1:59:20] you are the temples of
[1:59:24] God now picture that
[1:59:27] scripture Paul writes that
[1:59:30] scripture because he's trying to
[1:59:33] protect or the whoever wrote it the
[1:59:36] elements of the church he's trying to
[1:59:39] keep the lukewarmness from setting in
[1:59:43] he's tell them to contend earnestly for
[1:59:45] the faith these scriptures weren't
[1:59:47] written that could study scriptures they
[1:59:49] were actually
[1:59:52] addressing a
[1:59:54] problem that was coming against the
[2:00:01] church is that clear they didn't have a
[2:00:05] book they didn't have a Bible they
[2:00:08] didn't have a tape they had their
[2:00:11] experience and a roaring line seeking to
[2:00:15] devour
[2:00:18] him and these men were writing the
[2:00:21] scriptures because they wanted to keep
[2:00:24] their experience alive they wanted to
[2:00:26] keep the words of their testimony alive
[2:00:29] and they wanted to keep their Works
[2:00:31] alive because that's how God chose to
[2:00:35] carry out the
[2:00:40] commission not with
[2:00:43] intellect but with being born
[2:00:46] again filled with the spirit
[2:00:49] praying without
[2:00:52] ceasing are you with
[2:00:59] me let me close
[2:01:06] now I want to just jump over here and
[2:01:11] read this last little section and it's
[2:01:14] on page
[2:01:16] 88 now this is the complaint
[2:01:21] okay so we're talking about we're Rising
[2:01:24] back up to what the faith of the fathers
[2:01:28] is the Ephesian Church age is
[2:01:32] addressing the Ephesian Church losing
[2:01:36] its first
[2:01:38] love
[2:01:39] right so you understand now we've got to
[2:01:43] come back and meet the
[2:01:48] complaint
[2:01:49] we're actually traveling through the
[2:01:51] church ages
[2:01:57] backwards you thought you were going
[2:02:00] forward you say no we don't go backwards
[2:02:03] we're going back to Eden that's right
[2:02:07] right we're going back to the Faith of
[2:02:10] Our Fathers we're going back from where
[2:02:12] we come from that's
[2:02:17] right right that's
[2:02:21] right we're going
[2:02:24] back to the bodies that he had prepared
[2:02:28] for us in his mind in the beginning so
[2:02:32] we could live in fellowship with him
[2:02:35] eternally until we dropped down and
[2:02:37] picked up this
[2:02:40] thing now he's bringing us
[2:02:43] back trying to get it back into our
[2:02:46] hearts the things that he's prepared for
[2:02:48] us so this is the complaint let's just
[2:02:50] read this if you'll stay with me just a
[2:02:53] few
[2:02:55] seconds nevertheless I have somewhat
[2:02:58] against thee because thou Hast left thy
[2:03:01] first
[2:03:06] love to understand this you must realize
[2:03:10] that the spirit is not speaking to the
[2:03:13] original Saints of Ephesus alone this
[2:03:17] message is to the entire
[2:03:19] age which lasted 120 years its message
[2:03:25] then is to all the
[2:03:29] generations in that span Now history
[2:03:33] keeps repeating
[2:03:36] itself in the generations of Israel we
[2:03:40] see Revival in one
[2:03:43] generation only to see the fire fading
[2:03:48] in the
[2:03:49] next how many realize we've had a
[2:03:53] Revival the
[2:03:55] message of Malachi
[2:03:58] 4:5 was the greatest Revival that ever
[2:04:02] hit the earth since the Lord Jesus
[2:04:08] Christ it set campfires everywhere a
[2:04:17] burning Fade to the next and in the
[2:04:20] third generation ambers may be glowing
[2:04:24] sight slightly but in the fork there may
[2:04:28] be
[2:04:29] no V what is
[2:04:33] that
[2:04:35] whatsoever of the original
[2:04:42] flame what are we trying to get back to
[2:04:45] the original Flame
[2:04:49] not a
[2:04:52] substitute not a a Revival
[2:04:58] fire but a
[2:05:00] burning
[2:05:02] love in the heart of every
[2:05:06] individual manifesting him he then God
[2:05:12] lights the fire again and the same
[2:05:16] process is repeated if it is simply the
[2:05:23] manifestation of the truth that God has
[2:05:26] no
[2:05:28] grandchildren salvation is not passed on
[2:05:32] by natural birth no more and is there
[2:05:36] any truth to a a Apostolic
[2:05:40] secession it isn't in the word you start
[2:05:45] out with true Born Again Believers and
[2:05:48] when the Next Generation comes along
[2:05:51] they are no longer just plain
[2:05:55] Christians but they have taken a
[2:05:57] denominational name and are now Baptist
[2:06:02] Methodist
[2:06:03] except that is exactly what they are too
[2:06:08] they are not Christians you have to be
[2:06:11] born of the will of God not the will of
[2:06:16] men to be saved but these folks are all
[2:06:20] coming together now by the will of man I
[2:06:24] don't say that some of them aren't right
[2:06:27] with God but for a minute I do say that
[2:06:31] but the original fire has died down they
[2:06:34] are not the same
[2:06:39] anymore what's our path our path is back
[2:06:44] to the original flame how many want the
[2:06:47] original Flame flame that was in the
[2:06:50] church burning back that's where God's
[2:06:53] trying to take
[2:06:56] you no I left out a big part about
[2:06:58] condemnation God don't condemn you he's
[2:07:02] trying to bring
[2:07:03] you and every single one of you are are
[2:07:06] free to have it just hold on a minute
[2:07:09] I'm I'm moving
[2:07:11] quick the fervent desire to please God
[2:07:16] the passion to know his word
[2:07:19] the cry for reaching out in the spirit
[2:07:24] all begins to
[2:07:26] fade has cooled off and become a bit
[2:07:33] formal the cry for the What
[2:07:39] Spirit we've got so much
[2:07:42] knowledge that we don't get in the
[2:07:45] spirit right you can read a book and
[2:07:48] listen to a t but don't listen
[2:07:51] intellectually get in the
[2:07:54] spirit be born again get in the spirit
[2:07:57] let God move on your heart stay there
[2:08:00] till you feel the presence of the Lord
[2:08:02] till you feel the unction till God's
[2:08:05] talking to
[2:08:06] you and you're
[2:08:09] obedient wouldn't it be once again
[2:08:11] wonderful if the church could go back
[2:08:13] and felt I was led the Lord spoke to me
[2:08:16] this morning I feel moved D on the
[2:08:19] spirit I have an unction to good
[2:08:23] works I'm on fire
[2:08:28] not I read I listened I passed out but
[2:08:33] my life isn't
[2:08:39] full don't go into
[2:08:42] condemnation okay because this
[2:08:45] isn't condemning us for where we we are
[2:08:49] this is prophesying to us of where we're
[2:08:55] going
[2:08:59] Hallelujah right let's just
[2:09:03] read that is what was happening back
[2:09:07] there in Ephesus they were getting a bit
[2:09:11] formal the abandonment to God was dying
[2:09:15] out and the people
[2:09:19] weren't too careful about what God
[2:09:22] thought of them as they began to be
[2:09:26] careful about what the world thought of
[2:09:30] them the abandonment to
[2:09:34] god
[2:09:37] wow the second generation coming up was
[2:09:40] just like Israel they demanded a king to
[2:09:45] be like other nations and when they did
[2:09:49] that they rejected God but they did it
[2:09:53] anyway that is the history of the church
[2:09:57] when it thinks more of conforming to the
[2:10:02] world instead of conforming to God it
[2:10:06] isn't long until you see them stop doing
[2:10:10] things they used to do and start doing
[2:10:14] things they wouldn't do
[2:10:16] initially they change change their
[2:10:19] manner of dress sir their attitudes and
[2:10:24] their behavior they get laxed that is
[2:10:28] what emphasis means relaxed and
[2:10:36] drifting I'll just tell you that I came
[2:10:40] in this message in
[2:10:44] 6970 there is a big difference yes sir
[2:10:48] in the attitude of people and the
[2:10:51] respect for the
[2:10:53] messenger and the revealed word of
[2:11:01] God the Pentecostal Revival of the
[2:11:04] 1900s is hardly evident today it's been
[2:11:11] taken over by television evangelist it's
[2:11:14] been taken over by bobbed haired women
[2:11:16] preachers it's been taken over by all
[2:11:19] kinds of fanaticism it's been taken over
[2:11:22] by all kinds of money asking for this
[2:11:24] asking for that all kinds of programs
[2:11:27] all kinds of big big big
[2:11:34] big where's our path our path is back to
[2:11:38] our
[2:11:39] fathers just a few more statements to
[2:11:42] read the cycle of Revival and death has
[2:11:46] never failed all you have to do is
[2:11:49] recall the last move of God in the
[2:11:52] spirit when men and women dressed like
[2:11:56] Christians went to church prayed all
[2:12:00] night took to the
[2:12:03] streets corners and weren't ashamed of
[2:12:07] the
[2:12:08] manifestation of the
[2:12:13] spirit too much of the power of God
[2:12:17] happens inside the Four Walls of the
[2:12:21] church each one of you has the power to
[2:12:24] pray for the sick to lead somebody for
[2:12:28] to Christ every brother in this church
[2:12:31] can baptize
[2:12:35] somebody Paul said I didn't baptize any
[2:12:37] of
[2:12:42] you ask
[2:12:45] yourselves where am I going
[2:12:49] what am I heading to what is
[2:12:51] it so without a
[2:12:54] Bible without a book without a
[2:12:57] tape these people had accomplished
[2:13:00] something by meeting the Savior face to
[2:13:08] face he says they left their old dead
[2:13:12] churches and worshiped in homes or in
[2:13:15] Old store buildings they had
[2:13:19] reality but it wasn't too
[2:13:22] long a time until they begin to get
[2:13:26] enough money to build fine new churches
[2:13:30] they put in a choir instead
[2:13:34] of they put in a choir instead of
[2:13:38] singing unto God for
[2:13:41] themselves they put gowns on the choir
[2:13:48] they
[2:13:48] organized a movement and ran it by man
[2:13:53] they soon began to read books that
[2:13:56] weren't fit to read they let down the
[2:14:00] bars and the goats came in and took over
[2:14:05] they cried the Cry Of Joy was gone the
[2:14:11] freedom of the spirit was gone oh they
[2:14:15] kept on with a form
[2:14:18] but the fire had died down and the
[2:14:22] Blackness of Ashes is about all that is
[2:14:31] left we've got to come through
[2:14:36] that so we've arrived at this
[2:14:40] point where now we got to judge
[2:14:43] ourselves by the
[2:14:46] complaint
[2:14:48] we're the
[2:14:49] church we're the bride now we've got to
[2:14:53] stand there and face this
[2:14:59] complaint am I making sense we got to
[2:15:02] answer for
[2:15:04] it we're actually the
[2:15:09] Redemption of all the church behind
[2:15:13] us is that does it Dawn on you and me
[2:15:18] the
[2:15:19] importance of our
[2:15:24] position we're rising to a
[2:15:30] place that we come up to the
[2:15:35] complaint we recognize the complaint we
[2:15:39] recognize what happened and now through
[2:15:42] a personal
[2:15:44] contact and
[2:15:46] commission we break through that and
[2:15:50] enter back into the
[2:15:52] Faith of Our
[2:15:56] Fathers
[2:15:59] oh that's good
[2:16:06] stuff can we do it yes we
[2:16:10] can they ask Jesus can we be baptized
[2:16:13] with the baptism where you're in
[2:16:15] baptized with they saw the anointing on
[2:16:18] them they saw the Spirit on them they
[2:16:20] saw the works on them and they said can
[2:16:23] we have what you
[2:16:25] have what did he say
[2:16:28] yes go there and
[2:16:30] wait and I'll come again unto you and
[2:16:34] I'll Endo you with power from on high
[2:16:36] I'll be with you even in
[2:16:41] you that's what you're
[2:16:44] preaching to this
[2:16:46] world
[2:16:48] you're not preaching what was at
[2:16:53] Pentecost you're preaching what is in
[2:16:57] you
[2:17:06] now you don't have to manifest gifts in
[2:17:16] public you live a life amen I've sat
[2:17:20] with many a
[2:17:21] person and I'll just say
[2:17:24] this in my
[2:17:27] office and watch the Holy Spirit come
[2:17:30] down and tell them exactly where they're
[2:17:32] at what exactly they were thinking what
[2:17:35] is exactly was going on their life and
[2:17:38] what's exactly in their
[2:17:41] heart and watch them come to pieces in
[2:17:44] the presence of the Lord because they
[2:17:46] know it's AB
[2:17:48] absolutely the truth that's
[2:17:52] right you don't operate that right out
[2:17:56] here we got a revival going on in this
[2:17:59] message right now because people
[2:18:01] manifested gifts
[2:18:05] right and it just it it doesn't produce
[2:18:08] it and you know if it's wrong one
[2:18:16] time
[2:18:18] the whole testimony of it is
[2:18:26] gone think of how important it is for
[2:18:29] each of us to get back to the original
[2:18:33] Fountain it's about him it's not about
[2:18:38] us now let's just close with this last
[2:18:43] statement of
[2:18:46] reading
[2:18:48] a few moments ago I mentioned that John
[2:18:52] understood what it was to love
[2:18:59] God how many wants to know what it means
[2:19:03] and understand what it means to love
[2:19:08] God the great Apostle of Love would
[2:19:12] certainly
[2:19:14] see when the church begin to lose
[2:19:18] the first love of God in John 5 and3 he
[2:19:22] says for this is the love of God that we
[2:19:27] keep his Commandments the word one
[2:19:31] little deviation from the word was a
[2:19:35] step away from Christ people say they
[2:19:40] love God they go to church they even
[2:19:45] shout and rejoice and sing and have a
[2:19:50] great emotional
[2:19:56] time but when it is all
[2:20:01] over watch and see if they are in that
[2:20:07] word walking in it living in it if they
[2:20:13] go through all the other and then don't
[2:20:17] walk in that word they can say they can
[2:20:24] say they love God but their lives tell
[2:20:29] another
[2:20:30] story I wonder if John didn't see a lot
[2:20:35] of that before he died people say they
[2:20:40] love God but not obeying his word oh
[2:20:46] Ephesus Church
[2:20:48] something is happening to you someone is
[2:20:51] trying to either add to that word or
[2:20:55] take from it but they are doing it so
[2:21:01] sub
[2:21:02] subbly that you can't see it at all they
[2:21:06] haven't made a move so big you can see
[2:21:11] it out there in the open it's
[2:21:16] Undercover and they are beginning it by
[2:21:20] the way of
[2:21:24] reason and human understanding and it
[2:21:28] will take over unless you refuse it go
[2:21:32] back to
[2:21:33] Pentecost before it's too
[2:21:40] late think of
[2:21:42] it what was
[2:21:46] Pentecost
[2:21:49] people want to say it was the putting of
[2:21:51] gifts no those gifts came into the
[2:21:54] church because they needed
[2:21:59] them they didn't have books they didn't
[2:22:01] have Bibles they didn't have tap they
[2:22:03] had to be led of the spirit the spirit
[2:22:05] had to speak to them they set aside time
[2:22:08] to be speak from the spirit hear ye
[2:22:13] him it was an
[2:22:16] experience
[2:22:18] that changed their lives took them from
[2:22:22] cowards to laying their lives down a
[2:22:25] fire in their heart of fery for
[2:22:29] God I believe with all my heart this is
[2:22:34] the
[2:22:35] path not a
[2:22:39] deviation not a
[2:22:42] movement but a
[2:22:45] real personal
[2:22:48] contact of every believer in
[2:22:52] him an invisible
[2:22:54] Union between the Heavenly bridegroom
[2:22:58] and the Earthly bride where he finally
[2:23:01] says to the church The Works that I do
[2:23:04] the
[2:23:07] ministry will do
[2:23:10] also the works that I do the church will
[2:23:15] do also the work that I do you will
[2:23:21] do every man every woman every child
[2:23:27] every believer filled with the spirit of
[2:23:31] God the love of God shed abroad in their
[2:23:35] hearts by the Holy Spirit Led of the
[2:23:38] spirit of God a fervent
[2:23:41] fire not varying from the word of God
[2:23:46] this is where he's taking
[2:23:49] us let's
[2:23:51] don't pick up a
[2:23:54] substitute along the way let's
[2:23:59] persevere till each of us can stand
[2:24:03] there
[2:24:05] knowing we have
[2:24:07] overcome the
[2:24:09] complaint of the loss of love that's
[2:24:14] right and we enter in to that that
[2:24:17] Capstone God bless you this morning
