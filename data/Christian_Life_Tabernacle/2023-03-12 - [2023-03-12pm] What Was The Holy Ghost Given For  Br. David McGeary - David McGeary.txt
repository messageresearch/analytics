faults Lord that you see our needs you look upon our hearts desire father oh how that in the beginning you made us in such a way you create us us in such a way that we could have Fellowship Lord that we could know you and you could reveal yourself to us you made us in that image father in that form that unlike any other of your creation Lord we can have a personal contact with you we just ask you to bless us tonight as we love you and we read your word in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you tonight let's open our Bibles to uh Saint John the 14th chapter and I will read some scripture there and we're going to just talk a little bit tonight on Fellowship on what was the Holy Ghost given for so what was the Holy Ghost given for I I think that I didn't think this morning was so hard that it ran that so many people off I thought it was a little soft myself but it's okay we know it's spring break and a lot of people are starting off on their vacation and we certainly wish them that they'd have a wonderful time and we hope that you have an opportunity to get away and spend time with your family and things and so we're grateful for that amen so we're going to start with the 12th this whole chapter is so fantastic you know I like it so much we this it kind of starts with Philip in them uh you know asking Jesus you know show us the father so let's start at the eighth verse and and read there and just enjoy the word of God and Philip said unto him Lord show us the father and it's suffice of us and you know this this really shows you how close you can be to something and not see it without revelation and Jesus said unto him have I been so long with you and yet hast thou not known me Philip he that hath seen me have seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father isn't that great amen I bet you Philip had a revelation amen Philip have I been with you so long and you don't know who I am he who hath seen me have seen the father I'm the father made manifest in flesh Glory believeth doubt not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he does the works amen that's important to us amen because this is the pattern of God and the law of God and and then we'll see that as we just read some of our Messengers but all that God was he poured into Christ right he says it's not me that this he that does the work believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work sake verily verily I stand to you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son amen if ye shall ask me anything in my name I will do it if ye love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that ye may abide that he may abide with you forever how long forever ever that's got to be Eternal then right that's got to be eternal life even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you these are great promises amen I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because I live you shall live also and that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you so in that day what we're going to know that this is what we're gonna know we're gonna know that he's in the father and and I'm in my father and you year in me and I am in you he that he that hath my Commandments and keep them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him amen our gracious Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word in Jesus name we pray amen may be seated what a what a great uh thing and then we could just drop down here and just read like the 24th 25th and sixth verse it says he that loveth me keepeth he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which ye hear is not mine but the father with sent me these things I have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost when the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth I give unto you let not your hearts be troubled neither Let It Be Afraid we have heard how I said unto you that I go away and come again unto you if you love me you would Rejoice because I said I go to unto the father for my father is greater than I and I I just think this is just such a a beautiful uh relationship that the father had with the son and so we're just going to go and just take this little thought not be long this evening but just as we talked this morning and we wanted just to uh let us understand because what what we're what we're really looking for and what we've been talking about we're living in a very evil age it's the worst age that there's ever been never has the world moved this far away from God as they've moved now I mean it's un it's uncomprehendable we used to talk about about the Sodom condition and how there would be a Sodom condition but we never realized that that it would come to a place that they would even legalize the same gender marriages and if you want to look economically we we know the Bible told us that there would be such in this last day because it's a sign of of those that did not want to retain God in their knowledge the scripture says that if they do not want to retain God in their knowledge God will give them over to a reprobate mind doing those things which are unseemingly in other words not even natural you wouldn't even seem that they would think that way you know what I mean that there would even be attracted to such but because they didn't wish to retain God in their knowledge God let their mind become reprobate and then he gave them over to such things he said man with man woman with woman working that which is worth is unseemingly not even wishing to keep God in their knowledge and that's what we've come to they don't even want to retain God in their knowledge and then the scripture says it goes on farther in another place and tells us that they will come to the time that they think they're doing God of service by killing you now we wouldn't ever think that would be possible but we're seeing the world falling apart right around us we're seeing like we've never seen before the the world moving farther and farther and farther away from God and they don't even they don't even want to to to think like God that can eventually they took Bible reading out of the school they took praying out of the school they could they've done everything they they're trying to neutralize everything and they've got can you imagine coming to a place and our messenger told us that they won't even know whether they're a man or a woman what basic loss of sanity is that I mean they I mean I I can't even preach on it because I can't wrap my mind around it I can't even explain that Spirit but it leads me to understand why that we need his spirit why that we have to have his Spirit okay because we could not make it without him amen because there's he says I am the way the truth the life no man can come unto the father but by me so we understand that what was he we we talked about that this morning what what was the Holy Spirit it was the same spirit that was in Jesus Christ that allowed him to stand up against that religious age of that day who had taken every promise of God and absolutely turned it away from its real purpose and meaning in fact until he even came unto him and he said you say you have Moses if you would have known of Moses you had known me because I'm the one that Moses was speaking about here I am this is what all the laws and the prophets and everything's spoke of here I am the word that was prophesied every single thing about it standing right here amongst you Philip have I been with you so long and you don't know what I am I'm the Fulfillment of every biblical prophecy that was spoken it's all wrapped up right here in flesh and he knew that he he knew he knew uh the great uh god Jehovah was was in him and he looked out on us and he said father I pray for these they are that are in the world because they believed on me and I pray that you keep them from sin and unbelief because he knew we could not do it without him now there's a lot of things that men can do you know a man can believe we can believe on our own sure and we'll read a statement in just a while but you can believe in the Lord Jesus and not have the Holy Ghost so I mean we can believe on our own we can do a lot of good on our own there's a lot of people that do good and they do it for Humanity's sake you know that's why they do it they do it for Humanity say they do a lot of good for their own preservation and it's good I I don't I don't condemn any good I'm glad for the Salvation Army I'm glad for the Union Mission I'm glad for anybody that wants to do good amen good be God's good it's it's better I would rather have someone doing good than everybody robbing one another which seems to be coming pretty popular you know without regard you know it just man has lost control and the reason they've lost control they cannot stop the enemy because they have nothing to stop them with once you reject the word of God you've absolutely opened the doors for for the enemy to take free reign you can't stop them but there's one thing that stops Satan every time there's all we heard this morning nothing will defeat the enemy like the word of God like the word of God that's why you people don't understand the depth of what it meant when God sent a messenger in this age because man had lost the interpretation and the purpose of the scriptures they couldn't even find God in the scriptures anymore why because they mixed it with a polluted political mind they claim didn't look to the eyes of Eternity they looked everything at the present tense how does the word of God affect me this day and this minute to do what I want to do they never could give up they never could take their hands off of it and absolutely turn it over to God and his word and understand that God left us his plan and so a man can do a lot of good but he he cannot he can do a lot of good on his own but he can't make it on his own that's the one thing you can't do you can't enter there without him in other words he is the identifying credential to enter into the kingdom amen you know you have to go to these certain places you have a badge that always bothers me you know when I'm standing in line at the airport after you know for 20 minutes and some guy walks by one of them badges Jay you know what I mean he just goes and they let them in I go wait a minute I'm going to borrow one of them from my buddy next time and just go I don't even look at it you know sometimes things get so common they don't even check but but you're not going to make it there there's a credential right and that credential isn't good works because he said many will come to me in that day and say Lord Lord you know what I mean I did this and I did that and I did all these great things he said but I personally don't know you you're not packing you don't have within you the credential that shows that you're mine so we you we want to draw that clear conclusion and we heard that this morning there's a difference between a Christian and a born-again Christian and and so you can you can see the scriptures you can read the history you can know that there's a God because they found the Indians worshiping God totem poles and things that you can almost see the gospel in it and different things that they did that showed that they believed there was a God because God created in man something that wants to worship and man comes up with all kinds of different ideas so I there's and and man says well if you believe you're saved well you've got to believe to be saved but you can believe and not be saved I know that sounds terrible because we don't want to face the harsh reality of it but the harsh reality of of understanding the spirit of God is if you can understand you don't have it then you can get it but if you're deceived in thinking you have it when you don't you'll never look for it and that's the same principle that the prophet of God said he said when the son of man comes and does these things and you call it BL subabub there's no forgiveness for that in this life or the life ever to come because you've already denied the very Source the very Fountain of Salvation so if you think something's the devil you're never going to go back there and ask for it because you've already blotted it out you've sealed your fate and when the spirit of God came in this day to restore back to the church the true baptism of the Holy Spirit the true way to the kingdom look because there's wide was the way to destruction and many thereon but narrow was the gate and few be that found that and what did he do when he sent his messenger he sent his messenger so that he could make clear to his elected the way and who is the way he's the way and who is he he's the word there's not Jesus of yesterday and the word today they're the same person the same thing all the way from eternity it was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was what made flesh and dwelt them on us now we saw the prophesied word for our age made flesh right and if we saw it as the first fruit of the restoration of the seed down Through the Ages that's what happened we knew what the disciples had we knew what Paul had we knew what Peter had because this scripture tells us Silver and Gold Have I None you ought to go back and read that uh the message what is the what is the Holy Ghost brother Abraham dramatizes that so good he said Peter shows up there at the gate and he says they looked upon him and heck and and the guy says to him he says he says well I don't have any silver and gold but I've got something he says now Peter goes to talking about it he said 10 days ago Hallelujah he said 10 days ago I was in an upper room and we were waiting because he told us to wait until we receive power from on high because he knew we couldn't go out and preach this gospel on our own we couldn't do the works on our own he sent us out once before and we did it and when we came back we rejoiced over the wrong thing he said don't Rejoice because Satan you saw Satan falling like lightning that's not what we're interested in he says but rather Rejoice because your names were written in the Book of Life in other words rather Rejoice because you've been elected and chosen amen you have not chosen me I have chosen you how beautiful so he looked at him he says 10 days ago we were in the upper room and we had the spirit of God Came Upon Us the one we were following the one we believe to be the Messiah now we thought it was over because they killed them and then we heard that he had risen and and we were slow to believe that but then he appeared to us and we we saw him and he he talked to us and then we saw him being caught up into heaven and he said he told us to go wait and we would receive Kim because he would come again Eck he would be in US and he would be with us and we would know it and we were there and so now he's with me here and he's in me he says set your eyes fast on me and he said in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk oh my who did that it wasn't Peter that did that it was who was in Peter that did it and medical Church forgets sometimes it's not us that does the works it's him that does the work so how could it be God in Christ and not Christ in US it can't be Jesus didn't even take credit for doing the work he didn't even take credit for the words that he speaks the words that I speak tonight are not my words but they're the words of the messenger they're the words of our Lord Jesus Christ they're the words of the scripture I don't come up with this stuff why you wouldn't want to be following me we'd all be listening to Bob Dylan Sitting in some hippie junk house somewhere but he made the difference that's what it's about it ain't about us doing the work and us getting the power oh that is so warped what's out there right now it's not us it's him it's him in US it isn't about him giving us the power for us to do it it's about him dwelling in us so he can do it look just listen he's telling us he says now the purpose was if it's in the if you want to read along with me it's what was the Holy Ghost given for and this is paragraph 19. he says the purpose what was God's purpose in sending the Holy Ghost how many knows one of the principles that were taught by our messenger god never does anything without a purpose he never does anything without knowing the result he neither does anything that's not in the perfect time the perfect season or the perfect place so if he does something if he allows something in your life it's got a purpose if he let you fall it's for a reason and he doesn't let you fall for you to stay there he will come and pick you up because he's got a purpose and he made a promised word to you he would not leave you nor forsake you so we we understand this so we can just see it just plain as day that what was God what was God's purpose in sending the Holy Spirit I would Mark that down John 14 beginning at the 14th verse and read through the chapter for the basis God's purpose we find here in sending the Holy Spirit was one purpose that God himself might dwell in his church and continue his plan through the church that God was in Christ continuing his plan through Christ out of Christ into the church continuing his work through the Church God had one purpose it was the same purpose he had in Christ through Christ now he continues the purpose which was his Plan of Redemption how did he choose to redeem Fallen man back through Christ Jesus our lord that's what he did so he's continuing that's his same plan that that he did was to continue it to the church now we know what the holy spirit is we found out last night what it is it's God now when we think of God the father as Jesus spoke of here his father God the son as Jesus and God the Holy Spirit Holy Ghost as what we call it today now that does not mean there were three individuals distinct Gods it meant that there was one God in three offices may we say it like this all that God was he poured into Christ because he emptied himself and poured it into Christ and Christ was the fullness of the godhead bodily all that the power that God was was in Christ to create to do everything you say well what was Jesus's limitations Jesus's limitations was the will of the father that was his limitation I do nothing unless the father shows me how how much was he bound to that when he sat in the garden he says father let this cup pass from me but nevertheless thy will be done this is the purpose of the son to do the will of the father so that that's what he was that's it's it's for you Church you understand he thought it not robbery to be equal with God do you know what he wants us to come to where we don't feel it robbery to be like him I'm you know I'm just trying to get back into a positive mind I get so mad at the enemy and all his lies and his tricks that alls I want to do is blast them but forget him do you know what I mean he's a snail and there ain't no need wasting time on him because he's not going to change he's a deceiver he appears as an angel of Light you know what I mean you can't keep saying you know fake light fake like fake light you know what I mean if you know it's fake don't read it don't listen to it don't believe it but so what he just said he said all that he where was I see him May it's like this that God was he poured into Christ because he emptied himself and poured into Christ and Christ is the fullness of the godhead bodily all that Jehovah was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church not into one individual but into the entire body there's where we come together in unity we have power and that God was in Christ and all that Christ was is in you now you would have never come to that the church without a messenger you wouldn't ever have done to that until actually God put that on display through the ministry of the son of man that he actually came down and became one with that Prophet until actually you saw the very same Ministry of Jesus Christ except for the Corporal body you saw God veiled in man Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart doing only what the father showed him to do and saying only what the father told them to say and we saw that manifested now people get mixed up because they all want to run and do the prophetic work I don't want to do the prophetic work the prophetic work wants to be that's done that's been put on display but I want that life in me for what he has me to do he's not calling me to stand in front of thousands and manifest the son of man if they wouldn't have believed it in brother branham's day they're not going to believe it from a person like me you know what I mean so we need to give up on some of these fairy tale Christianity deals every time like every now I run across this land I found somebody who thinks he's a prophet somebody who thinks he's the messenger to Israel someone who thinks he's either Moses or Elijah all these you want to know something let God take care of that you know what I mean let God take care of what is what is it to you if he carries till I come follow without me so we just we'll just read this just because I just I like this it just gives such a beautiful understanding he says all that is was Christ in you for God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us First Timothy 3 16 if you're putting it down without controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifested in the flesh we handled him god Jehovah made flesh and walked on Earth and we saw him with our eyes and then he comes down here to say he says now here it is the father was God over you we're saying we've been since Adam God the father was over Moses and the children of Israel in the pillar of Fire then God With Us in Christ he walked with us he talked with us he ate with us he slept with us right he created a body without sin because he couldn't dwell in that so he created a body that he could dwell in because there was a law that God had to follow well just and he says he says yes and now God was come into Christ and Christ had come into the church what is it God working in you anywhere in the world if he wanted to call on you you're right there working in you he said you're right there working in you to do his good will so what is it he's got the church all over the world how we ought to be thankful for that God the holy spirit is sent for the purpose of giving of purpose of God living in his church moving through each age working out his Divine will he goes on to say here and we we understand it that we talk about the Plan of Redemption see it had to be according to God's law God already set the law he showed it forth in Boaz the kinsman redeemer that's how you redeem something by the law if you lost a piece of property someone that was akin to that property would have to go up and make a propisionary either buy it back or make a claim so that family didn't lose their inheritance so that's what happened when someone didn't have a relative instead of that whole property going out of that whole family any member of that family that was the next one in line which could go there and stand before the Elders of the church and if there was a dead ode on that they could make the payment for that debt take that property back and keep it in the family Hallelujah what were we where is children we're the family of God so we had to have a Kinsman someone who was what we were a part of the family which was on the Lamb's Book of Life his book of life his book of kinmanship and he had to come and pay the price to buy us back that we wouldn't lose our internal inheritance oh makes you feel good don't it I was lost I didn't even know I had property you know we have a lot of those scams nowadays don't we I'm such an suction I've got this big property send me 10 grand and I'll go redeem the property and uh and then I'll share part of the wealth with you why I thought well if if they're going to offer 10 and get it back tell me where it's at I'll go offer 20 and keep it all it's a scam because Satan's the biggest scammer there is nobody can get that property back no church can get that property back no religion can get that property back nobody could redeem it for you but Christ Jesus himself no church confessional no priest No sacrifice that nothing all of the blood of sheeps and goats did was cover up the sin but it still remained but we had one that took it and threw it and then the Sea of God's forgetfulness to be remembered no more and while you were yet a sinner he threw it to the Sea of God forgetfulness and in order from to make the cross of none effect what Satan's going to do he had to come and reveal to you what he did so you could receive what he did and make what his did what he did come to a reality oh that ought to make you feel good it makes me feel good in other words he can't lie he can't fail all the father hath given me will come and so we just see how what what what beautiful uh what the beautiful Plan of Redemption was that it had to be a Kinsmen Redeemer and so we read here in 31 that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost it's the father again God the Father dwelling in you working out his plan his plans to finish his Plan of Redemption working through you making you a co-worker with him giving you a place giving you a part for your lost Fallen brother and sister giving you his spirit and his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the Garden of Eden to Play Your Part in the Plan of Redemption let's just look at the Plan of Redemption real quick if I could give you an overview and I know many of you could do it a lot better than me some of you can actually put dates and times and and different dispensations and everything on it he says but it says look he says look at the Plan of Redemption Adam's race had fallen right so they were just drifting every man did what he thought was right in his own eye it was kind of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth you know what I mean you steal from me I'll steal from you were even you kill one of mine I'll kill one of yours what a way to live huh total fear but God had a plan to restore back his family to go get his chosen people who he knew were part of him because in order to be redeemed you had to be someplace right so you couldn't be redeemed if you weren't lost so he knew he had a family and you were part of it so he put a plan right so what did he do he came down to Abraham that's how he started his Plan of Redemption was to show up to Abraham who was 80 years old and say I'm going to give you a son what a type the son he was talking about wasn't Isaac it was another son that was going to redeem us all that's the son he was talking about but he always comes in flesh God always comes in flesh even when he showed up to Abraham who was melchized at it was God in flesh eating and drinking a perfect type of what was going to come so he instituted The Plan of Redemption through Abraham right and through Abraham he called out a people didn't he we talked about spring he gave him a sign this is going to be the sign of all your seed every part of your seed will circumcise will circumcise will circumcise so everybody that's up from Abraham's seed will bear the mark of circumcision in their flesh showing that they come from the tribe or from the people that God spoke to and promised a land to they were marked were marked right we talked about that this morning so what did he do they got in bondage right so what did he do he came down in Egypt remember we read in Acts 7 today and he he brought them out uh of the of of the land of Egypt by the prophet Moses which was a perfect type of Christ what was he doing he was revealing his Plan of Redemption in Shadows and types we could look at the shadows and types and if we looked he said if you would have believed Moses and you would have studied Moses and you would have looked at the scriptures the right way instead of trying to use the scriptures to bind the people with pots and pans and with services and all these laws you would have seen me you would have recognize I'm the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world that's what John said when he saw him Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world who was this man no none ever spoke like him it was the Plan of Redemption coming down so he brought him out of Egypt and he gave them a land what's the what's the Israel what's the land the promised land a type of it's a type of where we're going it was a type of Eden in Shadows and types The Plan of Redemption The Book of Revelations is the revelation of Jesus Christ is the Plan of Redemption so it comes down he says then he spoke to it through Prophets right Sunday times in diverse manners he spoke to the church by the prophets and then finally he sent his own son Hallelujah paid the price now he spoke to us through his son didn't speak to them no more he spoke through us through his son will you say well brother Branham is a prophet brother Bram spoke the word he spoke what was in the scriptures he spoke when Jesus spoke he just spoke it in Truth and separated all the garbage out of it so you got it straight but ever since Jesus here he's always been speaking to the church and you say well he speaks to the Holy Spirit well who is the holy spirit it's the spirit of Jesus Christ dwelling in you it's the same spirit so we see the thing and then we understand right that that that seed went into the ground why did the seed have to go into the ground because he went into the ground he's following the law he's following the types where was the Gospel written It Was Written In The Clouds the sap going out of the tree coming up death burial Resurrection the sun death burial and Resurrection he's speaking out to everybody death burial and Resurrection Paul finally get so excited he says oh death where's your sting oh grave where's your victory I have fought a good race I fight when I'm going up to get the crown that awaits me we're not afraid of death oh Glorious Day I even the Jesus even told them if you love me you would rejoice because I'm going to the father we just love this whole world too much but I tell you when this bodies gets a few years on it you're just not as much in love with it as you are and when you know there's a new one waiting you start saying in your heart even so come quickly Lord Jesus talk is the Plan of Redemption so we come down the seed went into the ground right justification sanctification baptism of the holy spirit so what's he doing is the purpose of them is is to finish his Plan of Redemption working through you and hunting those lost as he did in the Garden of Eden Adam Adam Where Art Thou that's what the Holy Spirit does to a man or a woman when it strikes into their heart and takes its Abode there a thirst and a hunger for lost souls the church is built on converts it's not built on a prostolating from one Church to another it isn't getting a school bus or a church bus and driving to every neighborhood and Gathering up everybody I don't care who brings them to the Lord someone says well what happened if they if they come to the Lord if they come to the Lord Jesus they're coming to this message [Music] they may have to go through this and through that they'll never be satisfied because there's never going to hear anything that bears witness with the born-again experience in their heart until they hear the true word of God and then it Bears Witness what is the new birth if the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally that's what it is that person will go on and find the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit will lead them and guide them into all truth and righteousness never stop somebody from coming to the Lord someplace else because they don't believe your Doctrine you let him come to the Lord you let him get in his palm and if they're his sheep they'll know his voice and a stranger they will not follow it'll have to be according to the law of God and that's the law of God that put in there you come to the Lord Jesus you know him personally in your heart you will follow him and let's just finish reading it he says come that's what's the matter with the meetings today there's not enough Spirit touch in it go on going for The Souls of the Lost and the dying it's more to make a name or a church or a building or a denomination instead of Soul winning program how pitiful how we could stay on that too much how pitiful and that's why I said I don't care there's just a few here tonight we're not building that for believers we're building it for converts that's what we want to fill it up with we want to go to the highways and the byways in the hedges we want to get the those that are in Chains and those that are in bondage and those that are possessed and those are the ones we want to reach out to whether it's religious mental physical we don't care we've got a God that can deliver them but we don't have the compassion you know what's happened to us we're too into showing off one to another you build the one that'll build the bigger I'll have the biggest that's pretty bad real estate isn't it when there's only eight Souls saved forget that let's be the let's be spiritual what is the Holy Ghost given for so you'll have a burden for lost souls it isn't given that's the benefit of it to know you're saved to know you're sealed so you don't have to worry your life isn't always about trying to keep yourself straight he keeps you straight he's an advocate you get in this permissive will he works you back to his perfect will but you're about the father's business he says I have need to go by there I'm about my father's business there's a lost soul there he's walking down the street there's Zacchaeus up there he said oh Zach is hello you didn't know I thought you were up there come on down here I'm gonna go eat with your place tonight by the time he was done with Zac gas He restored everything he stole he gave two-thirds of all he had to the poor and that little guy was on fire for God hallelujah you don't think his wife would have been praying for him what did he say her name was Rebecca is that what he said his wife's name he's just dancing in the spirit praising God the very one she believed was now at her table eating with her husband and he was eating it up he's the same yesterday today and forever that's what the Holy Ghost is given for God pouring himself into Christ correct Christ pouring himself into the church now watch at that day you'll know I'm I am in the father and you and me and I in you that day you'll know it for it's the whole thing is one Plan of Redemption it's part of the Plan of Redemption him coming in you and you going after the Lost you're part of their Redemption you're part of the Plan of Redemption don't you understand what we've done in this message we've left the Plan of Redemption and we've Fallen back into building churches and building names for ourselves and trying to show how much Doctrine we know and how smart we are and all this other stuff and we come high-minded puffed up we have Petty actually competing for one another when the Bible says your fools to compare yourself one to another let's get back to the father's business that's what he's in you for go into all the world preach the gospel I'm in you you lay hands on the sick you cast out demons you spread the good word you do it no Nickelodeon says conquered that and stole that from the people and if you get somebody sick you bring them to my holy office remember now I'm in charge of this movement and if I lay hands on them oh you know where you really find them how many knows the best place to find Jesus is it's in a closet that's where he's at he's in closets this inspires me I'm sorry you know why because it's bringing me back to my track bringing me back to where I belong getting me off of the negative putting me back on the positive that the whole thing's The Plan of Redemption coming down that God come back to live in and dwell with and commune to his people as he did at the beginning now then as soon as he gets his church in speaking condition he gets his church to that place he can flow himself through and love and persuade and fellowship then there will come a Eden he'll take his church back to where it left him back at Eden again where it fell how many times do we say it if we get that last one we're leaving why do we want a Revival here when we know the Revival is over you say well the bride's promised a Revival what's the Revival of the Bride doing the will of the father seeing them healed seeing demons cast out seeing people getting saved going about the father's business don't let Satan tell you that you don't have nobody to witness to you're trying to tell me you never go to the grocery store nobody ever asks you about how you look you never pump gas you know you'd have to absolutely be a recluse not to preach this gospel whistling him if you have to let them know right let them know and so we we understand that great Plan of Redemption now look what he says so you're part of the Plan of Redemption so we understand the Plan of Redemption right it came through justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost now you're here to finish up the Plan of Redemption because he didn't finish all his work when he was on Earth he left a portion of it to be finished by his bride that she would bring forth children he says now in the age that we're in now living this age it's beyond Pentecost the age that we're living on is beyond Pentecost so we're moving up we're going up it's beyond that now this is the part that I think that we get I hope we can just settle in on and finish up on it says Now 49 now the church has come through those schools she married back Yonder a long time ago and become a denomination and an organization this is paragraph 49. but you notice the birth produced something else and now it's got to a place where the Pentecostal Church with the New Birth has been tested and tried and now it's come to a place God doesn't deal with the church just as an organization let's follow it he deals with the church as individuals so this last church that he puts together isn't put together by an anointing it isn't put together by a spiritual movement though Pentecost through the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the restoration of gifts and people going out and sharing that experience they came together and they began to unite around it but what happened God was moving past that to the individual so they organized in order to keep that revival going and when Pentecost started pulling away from the true word can you imagine Pentecost pulling away from the messenger when the messenger was doing every sign and wonder and every gift that they were trying to get what was the difference they didn't want to go on to perfection now it's not easy to die to yourself and let Christ live in you it's not easy to die out but it's the desire of the believer he said he says God he deals with the church as individuals each individual in the church each individual in the church and now it's got a Time it's no secret we all see it when man proves and God and God loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself there in the front of angels he does something for him he lifts him up there in the presence of God and gives him and fills him and sets him out that the age that's the age that were living in I don't know any better way to say at church than just the way brother Branham says it what is the egg we're Beyond Pentecost now this is the age that God deals with you as an individual so don't run off to a church movement don't run off oh they're doing this over here and they're doing that over here he told us they would say low he's here low he's there Loth you'll find them here although you'll find them there no that's not where you find them you find them as an individual he's dealing with the individuals in the church and what does he do with that individual he lifts that individual up in the presence of God in the presence of the Angel and gives him a gift and does something for him what is the gift of God his eternal life through Christ Jesus that's what he does he gifts him and fills him and sets him out that's the age that we're living in they didn't want to go there you know because to go there it changes your comfort zone what happens if all after all this time and all the labor I put in and everything I did when I got lifted up to that place he said I don't really want you to be a pastor Brother David I all I've ever really wanted you to be is a janitor ooh wait a minute I mean I kind of like that people saying pastor Brother David oh I like people coming for advice and oh that that makes me feel like I'm something reality you're nothing son you don't have a thing I didn't give you you've got by living off the prophet's message Hallelujah then I'll get a prophet's reward I like that what's your prophet's reward being a friend of God who else was known as a friend of God sounds like my father Abraham he was a friend of God amen who is David he was beloved of God God loved David for the letter rascal but God loved them why he had a pure heart he had every weakness there was in the book he even killed the man but when it came down to judgment David's heart had the righteous and just judgment in it and God loved that about David he said be it so unto me what was he a type of Christ let my sins let it let that judgment fall upon me I'm not above the law and the word of God oh my amen but that Plan of Redemption was in full swing Bathsheba was going to be God and there the story continues on isn't it beautiful aren't you so eternally secure he says the same holy spirit that saved the lutherans that Sanctified the Methodist that baptized the Pentecostal is Now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus when it'll be so powerful that body will come into a group of church that will draw the rest of them from the grave that'll be a resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost is for what is the Holy Ghost without us they cannot be made perfect they lived in one day under that we're living on in another day when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God will raise up a standard against it Hallelujah have you ever seen the enemy come in like a flood you are the last Light the last voice the last sign the last people that possess the true unadulterated word of God you are the standard his pride is the standard because this Eve isn't like the other eve and she will not be enticed by his laws she will not be enticed by his kingdom she doesn't care about his wisdom she doesn't care about his money she's married and become one with the bridegroom in an invisible Union and they are standing letting the light and the union of Christ in her showing the world that he's the same yesterday today and forever is that possible we saw it with our own eyes we saw the Plan of Redemption mature to the place that the angel put his foot on the land and sea and opened the seals why couldn't they see it because he veiled it in a little humble man and no matter what works he did they wouldn't believe it because they had nothing in them to believe with aren't you glad you've got something in you to believe with and in closing we'll just speak these words because we really want to draw the difference oh my dear friend paragraph 57. oh my dear friend from around this country and in this little city if I could only with my human voice Place into your heart the importance of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost it would be the most wonderful revelation that you ever had in your life to see what you must do it it's so important to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit the spirit of God coming in you to do his work for the Plan of Redemption not a blessing of another age but that God has a portion of the Plan of Redemption that is set aside for you to perform and in order for you to perform that portion of the word that's giving to you you can't do it with an experience of a day gone by you must have that fresh Spirit of the age be baptized with his spirit and his person in you to fulfill the work that he has for this end time which is an individual affair you say I can't do it you can do it because he said you could I just can't overcome no but he can he can do it by his spirit it's the law of God by his Spirit you want to overcome something that's got you asked for the baptism of the Holy Spirit ask the mighty conquer to come in make himself real in you so you know wow I used to desire this who took that away when his big great guy stands up here I gave up smoking I gave up drinking you want to look at him and says did you die for my sins you don't even need the Lord you've done all these Mighty works but you don't know noem for yourself know him for your need not you know and I told the story and it was my ignorance being a really young Christian I'd never been healed and I wanted to be healed I'd listen to brother brahm's testimony of those people being healed and I thought man those people are so great I was too blind to realize what I had so I prayed oh God heal me well I didn't realize I was going to have to have something to be healed of but you won't know what God will give you the desire of your heart man I prayed that prayer in Earnest the next day my shoulder was out of joint my thumb was broken on my ribs my ribs were bruised I was just smacked my arm was hanging down by my side I couldn't do nothing guess what I was a candidate for Divine Healing I got in a meeting in the spirit of the Lord come by me I don't know if he came by everybody else I don't judge the spirit of the Lord by somebody dancing I don't judge the spirit of the Lord by someone he's singing I feel the presence of the Lord but I judge by the spirit of the Lord by him personally speaking to me and I'll tell you something there's a lot of difference between worship when you worship you get in the spirit of worship you're worshiping you're doing all the singing you're doing all the praising you're lifting the accolades to the Lord your I don't care if you shout and you dance and that's wonderful I'm not against Nancy if anybody if you feel that you have the gift of tongues or prophesy we'll meet in the church one night a week or we'll meet before service and we can exercise and practice those gifts and then we'll judge them and if they come to pass you all have the gift of healing you can heal somebody not even my laying hands on them but by believing by applying the token there's so many the way God works but you know so when we worship and we praise and we're rejoicing you notice we're doing all the thing but let me tell you something every time that God moves there's Dead Silence everybody stands in awe you watch the prophet when he shows up on the scene man everything gets real quiet everybody that comes up before him is reverent when John come into His presence he felt like dead the prophet of God every time he says he comes I feel like I died don't mistake worship and praise and joy and the joy of the Lord and the shout of the camp understand there's a difference between us worshiping in the spirit and God moving and performing his word on all for worship I'm all for our praise I wish we you had more of it I had more of it we just don't want to confuse the two when he's moves everything stops he demands reverence look at when when was it Isaiah that when the temple and he saw the angels and what did he say oh Lord I'm a miserable man take the coal from The Altar and touch my lips it's so important that you understand this and and you've got to remember he says oh he says what a wonderful Revelation the baptism of the spirit is he says let me make that clear about you're not converted Peter had been saved but believed on the Lord followed him Jesus told him who he was and he followed him he gave him power against unclean spirits and Sanctified him but after that and became the chief spokeman of the group as the Catholics would call it Bishop of the church or Pope or whatever was head of it and Jesus said that night of his betrayal loveth thou meet Peter and he said Lord you know I love you he said feed my sheep he said that three times and Peter said you know I love you you know Lord you know all things you know I love you he said I go with you to the end I'll go with you till the death and so forth he said before the Croc crows three times before the Croc closed you'll deny me three times but Peter I prayed for you now listen that's not all of it I prayed for you and after you are converted and strengthen your brethren after you are converted he had shouted he had probably danced in the spirit he had done all kinds of things but he hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet after you are converted then strengthen your brethren that's true carry out his plan and he goes on here he says now watch what Paul said paragraph 62. watch what Paul said that John every baptized under repentance not for remission of sins but unto repentance he said that's what you believe when you accept Christ as your personal savior you believe under the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost my dear Baptist Brethren it is wrong so there is a baptism of the Holy Spirit after you believe you can believe with your own spirit you can repent with your own Spirit you can do good works with your own Spirit you can lose weight with your own spirit you can overcome habits with your own spirit you can Bridle your tongue with your own Spirit but you can't carry out the Plan of Salvation without his spirit do you understand that there's a difference and he said that this morning there's a difference between a Christian professing Christian and a Christian that's got the Holy Spirit may I repeat what the prophet said he says let it be known if I could with my voice how important it is to have the Holy Spirit you know a lot of people had the Holy Spirit and they gave up their leadership to pastors to church Authority instead of being led of the holy spirit because that church got him afraid you don't have to be afraid if God be for you who can be against you let's make sure that our children don't just believe the message let's make sure they have the Holy Spirit let's make sure the person of Jesus Christ has come into their hearts and their lives and if you don't you're not sure of that gather a few of the elders together kneel down and pray together until you surrender yourself to him it don't mean you don't believe it's just maybe something's been battling you and you haven't been able to overcome it you don't believe that you're not saved it doesn't mean you're not a Believer it's just that you can't finish the work of the Plan of Redemption which Christ wants to do in you while you're in that condition so you must receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit you must receive Christ into every part of your life even the part of your life that you're ashamed of you don't have to confess that part with everybody you don't have to share all your inner troubles with everybody but sharing with him because he already knows it he's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart he will come in and do for you exceedingly and abundantly above which you could ask or think just like our messenger said I can't if I could with my lips convince you how important it is to have the baptism of the Holy Spirit I cannot judge who has it and who doesn't you know in your whole heart and you can and that's why the scripture says don't grieve that spirit let it live back restore it back get the fire of it back lord return unto me the joy of my salvation and that's just what some people have lost they've lost the joy of the Salvation they they begin to doubt whether they not they have the Holy Spirit or not because of their sins if you sin and a man that says he sinneth not is a what liar for we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God but we have a propisionary right we have an advocate which is the Holy Spirit that make the advocate we go to him crying Abba Father and he's just and forgetful to forgive us our sins and to restore us back into the duty of the Lord Jesus Christ if you don't have the Holy Spirit you should know do you have the assurance do you have the sign you're different the world can tell you're different do you have the seal you know you're going there even if you stumble you know you're going You've Got The Advocate you got the comforter you've got the joy you know you have those things I've failed many a Time many a Time I I I'm ashamed of my failures but there's one thing I know he promised me he'd never leave me nor forsake me and when I'm about to give it all up he comes and he deals with my heart and he speaks to my spirit and he restoreth my soul because he don't look at the flesh he looks at the inward man that's what the holy spirit's for the Holy Spirit isn't here to restore the gifts in the church they never left the church is just moving in to a greater perfection where each individual is a living Messiah going about doing the same works that he did the works that I do you personal pronoun shall do also you say what's going to cause them to do that a spirit an anointing no the love of God shed abroad in Your Heart by the Holy Spirit that's what motivates the works it's the love of God you and him entering into a love song that's the whole message of this hour was a bride and her husband becoming one and now him living in his church carrying out the Plan of Redemption that's the age we live in now isn't he wonderful all the father hath given me will come nothing will pluck you out of the palm of my hand so quit being miserable you know what I mean don't be miserable the prodigal son was miserable he had a corner husk and in his mouth and there's a pig on the other end of that corner yeah and they're fighting hey he's wandering around in the pig slop trying to get life from a pig what does the scripture said he come to himself being what am I doing here the servants live better in my father's house I'm going to go back to my father's house and I'm going to repent I'm going to say father I'm not worthy I'm not worthy to be your son I've squandered everything you did for me but just let me come back and serve you I'd rather do pigs in your barn than in their Barn I'll do whatever you have what did the father do kill the fatted calf get the robe my son that was lost has returned there's more rejoicing in heaven over one Soul returning back then there is the 99 why because that's our hearts desire too because we have the same Spirit he has we want to see our lost loved ones we want to see our children it's time that we're going to fight it's time to beat our plowshares into swords and take the sword of God's word and start going to the father father that's my child I claim them in the name of Jesus Christ send your Holy Spirit move in somebody bring somebody by deliver them that's the work of redemption what a good of who we speak with tongues of men's and angels and have not charity oh I hope that I'm I I church I believe it just the way he says it what a wonderful message to listen to what is the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost given for for you people that love the study of the Bible he does types and he goes through this and he goes through that and he lays it out through the ages and he brings us right down to where we are in our day the teaching reign and then the latter rain how come the latter rain wasn't it what did he say it was the unrighteous partaking of spiritual gifts thy deviled inspired men but there will be a righteous partaking but what will that partaking be for it'll be for the purpose of doing our part in the Plan of Redemption go back study it see if that's not exactly what the prophet said the Holy Spirit was given for and we want to baptize people just so they can say they have the Holy Ghost it won't profit nothing until the baptism matches the purpose then you'll see these signs follow the believer I love you I don't sing very good so if the musicians would come and maybe I was long tonight will Jack stand together and and dismiss on a tune and and if you have chance this week and I'm sure you all have your own private studies going on and and uh but if you get a chance just to listen to those messages what is the Holy Ghost and what it's for you won't you won't start killing yourself whether you have it or not you will know that there is comforting you sealing you keeping you you make mistakes yes that's why he's an advocate does Satan come against you sure That's why nothing will pluck you out of the palm of his hand Church there's nothing like him taking his Abode in you and you may believe him with all your heart you may be doing everything you can with all your might and I thank God for that you'll have a greater chance at the Judgment living like that but you want to get that judgment seat completely out of your life you stay until you're positively sure you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost then you'll never have to face that judgment you'll know he's in you and and we are here for you I I don't have no evidence to give you he's the evidence Giver but if he takes up his Abode in you you'll know it and you'll love it and you'll thank him for it and the frown will turn to a grim the stoop shoulders will fly back and you'll be able to say I am Bound for the promise that I am Bound for the promised land oh who will come foreign oh I like that [Music] happened amen [Music] [Music] oh do you know it because the same spirit that was in him is in me and it's gonna Quicken my mortal body amen [Music] forever amen [Music] oh I like this first no chilling whale [Music] can't reach that helpful soul [Music] [Music] oh praise God [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] hey man you know that's one of the evidences that you have the Holy Spirit you know where you're going this world's not your home amen you're traveling on Amen brother Stephens will you come and dismiss us in prayer my brother [Music] foreign I just want to say a couple of words and I heard brother Braham said sometimes we just try to give a new fire in our lives he said it's not enough if we don't die on The Altar with our sacrifice we are not born again so that is what we have to die with our sacrifice with our life to bring our bodies others God's submissions so that will change our life we change our thoughts we change everything what we have in US let's let's approach God and let's let's let's give our all all we have to him and he will be with us Heavenly Father we come before you We Want to Thank You Lord everything what we are we are because of you yeah everything what we have we have through you God Jesus we want to thank you Lord for our families
