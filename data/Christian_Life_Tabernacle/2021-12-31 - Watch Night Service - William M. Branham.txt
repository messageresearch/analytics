Description:
Watch Night Service
Various Brethren
Friday Night Service: December 31, 2021.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

all the way and as uh we all say he's our the redeemer is faithful and true i'm gonna sing that then as i look back on this road i've traveled i see so many times he carries me through if there's one thing that i've learned in my life my redeemer is faithful and true my redeemer is faithful and true everything he said he will do every morning this mercies are new [Music] my redeemer is faithful and true my heart rejoices when i read the promise [Music] there is a place that i'm preparing for you i know someday i'll see my lord face to face cause my redeemer is faithful and true my redeemer is faithful and true everything he has said he will do every morning his mercies are new my redeemer faithful and true [Music] and in every situation he has proved this love for me when i lightly understanding he gives more grace to me oh my redeemer is faithful and true everything he has said he will do and every morning his mercies on you [Music] oh my redeemer is faithful and true [Music] oh my redeemer [Music] his mercy is all new [Music] my redeemer is faithful and true my redeemer is faithful and true my lord jesus is faithful and true [Music] [Applause] anybody who'd like to testify and uh we don't really need a life story but just a quick testimony i know how it is when you go to testify you want to put everything in it all but just we can kind of condense it down and have a few testimonies somebody that the lord's been faithful or true or somebody like to say a testimony what the lord's done for them we'll bring the mic to you so if you'd like to have a testimonies anybody have a testimony that they'd like to share no testimonies well then well we're going to do all right we got a testimony all right jeff wants to testify amen yeah i just wanted to uh i'm gonna say that the lord has been faithful uh and true to me not not that i don't have anything fresh to testify of but i just think it's a really awesome thing that he did it was so humbling when he uh gave me the revelation that he was going to protect me from this coveted uh thing and he's been faithful to do it you know the devil's tried to come against the revelation but you know the lord's been faithful and and i just want to thank him for that uh i feel so unworthy that he'd do something like that for me but uh i just want to give him thanks and praise um for his faithfulness [Applause] okay i have a couple of things actually we had had prayer for my daughter-in-law's father um i don't know about a month ago because he was in the hospital with covet on a ventilator uh they did not give him any chances to live he had like a 20 chance to live and we prayed and i went home and i told my son and his wife i said don't worry we prayed at church everybody's praying for him he's going to be fine well he went home today one more thing that i just you know god is so good and god does things that the devil likes to tell you that that didn't really happen but you know it happened and you keep it in your heart and you know what happened and we were in arizona for thanksgiving we took my parents out to go see my daughter and our grandchildren and we went to the grand canyon and my daughter carries a backpack which is also her purse because you know she's got babies and and it's her diaper bag and purse and her wallet was in her side pocket and we're walking and all of a sudden she turned around and she looked and her wallet was about to fall out of her backpack and she goes oh my goodness i keep that zipped and so i was like well we better zip it up so we zipped it up we went on about our business went back to phoenix we stopped in flagstaff at sam's club to get gas and we're in an rv so we pull in they pull it in their van they get out and all the kids get out and scott asked kristin said can i have your sam's card so i can go get gas and she goes well it's in my wallet so they go to the backpack while it's not there and [Music] so they looked vigilantly through their van they looked through every bag they looked through every box they looked through everything kristen was in tears because her wallet basically had her life in it and so i wound up giving scott my sam's card and i said just go get gas we'll find it well she went through her backpack again no wallet she was in tears she's trying to not think about it and she's she said it'll show up and so i snuck her backpack and i went to the front of the van and i took everything out of her backpack and i went through it no wallet so i go back in i just left her backpack sitting on my seat at the front and so i go back in the rv and she's sitting in there and she's tending to her baby and i went to walk by her and something was just like stopped so i stopped and i put my arm around her and i just prayed and i said god you know where that wallet's at wherever it's at we know you can put it back and we believe in that and we have faith in that and we know we're you're going to take care of it wherever it's at and i said amen and i just patted her on the shoulder and i said everything's going to be okay now and i walked about did my thing and like five minutes later david come to the door of the rv and he's standing there crying with christian's wallet in his hand and i was like where did you find his wall her wallet and he's like something just told me to go look in the top of her backpack so he went and looked and he opened it up and her wallet was laying right on top so we know who put it there and you know we we thought about the fact that maybe somebody was trying to pick pocket or whatever but you know we just wondered along with hers how many other wallets god put back that day when we prayed so we just thank god for that and i just wanted to share amen hallelujah you know there's going to be a lot more testimonies like that amongst god's people because those are the testimonies that separate the believer from the unbeliever you know there's a lot of people they just won't believe that you know there's got to be some logical reason you know it's stuck to the top of the wrapper or the velcro done but anything else but god putting it back yeah sir so i'm looking for that anybody else have a testimony all right there he got one right here behind you god bless you good night [Music] and the pavement was slippery but when i turned right i saw it was either or nothing the car was normal [Music] i said thank you god we amen amen maybe you have time for a couple more anybody else have a testimony they'd like to give this evening okay testify so when i was in kentucky because god was protected from the tornado was up in there just only miraculous i don't know what to say i was uh at work so the time was tornero coming i i had a knowledge in my phone and i keep praying god protect my family over there because i live with his brothers so when i went home all the light was shut down was so darkness everywhere so the time the time i get in my house there is no no light no electrician and it everything was shut down then when i was in the morning i just come out oh the neighbor's house was followed down was like broken the people died so but uh say it's only grace of god i came like he being alive yeah and then i i was praying god and praising him because he's the one who gave me chance to uh he's the one who practiced my home also yeah i'm not even good person but just only for his grace and mercy thank you for that praise the lord i remember the first time that i i came to texas i had to do some little work in amarillo and i remember the first time that i've heard of a tornado a warning i think i was the only guy i was out in the street looking at the sky you know i mean didn't know what to do go get my bathtub you know i didn't know what to do it seems funny now you hear it you don't even stop you know what i mean but this one was real hey man we really appreciate that i'd like to just give a little testimony um if i could uh you know we've been working um from we decided in our heart and we just felt it was the lord and that we needed to build a new sanctuary because we just don't have any sunday school and our hearts just been burdened and we wanted to take this building here and put five sunday school rooms in it and then take the rest of it and turn it into a fellowship hall uh where we could have uh get-togethers and and other events uh if people wanted to use it for uh weddings or whatever the lord could do and then we could have a place that everybody could sit in the sanctuary together right it just burdens me when people are in the overflow and they're looking just like everybody in the congregation together so we started to work on it and as everybody knows the pandemic began to break out and and jobs shut down material prices went up through the roof a sheet of plywood went from twelve dollars and five cents to 42 dollars and you know we needed about 90 sheets uh for our roof two by fours went and from five cents to seven dollars a piece and the material prices just went through the roof we couldn't have attendants nobody could come into the church building we're limited with the number of people and of course you know a church operates on the freewill giving of the people and and and so if you don't have services and you don't have people together you know it's just hard to function and it just seems like we just couldn't get the project off the ground and every time we'd send a plan to the city they would find something with it and and they'd give us a list and we would go do it again and then we bring it over and they give us another list and we did this six times so after six reviews and drawing all the blueprints and everything we finally yesterday the city wrote us and said they finally accepted all of our drawings and everything and that we now can apply for the permits and we're going to be in the permit application stage where we have to put in all the things that go with it so we just need uh all of your help uh i i thank god it's all been god's timing perfectly because slowly our congregation's been able to come back and covet had caused some people to move different places and and people have come and gone but we're starting to stabilize again and uh we'll try to have a nice sanctuary where there's plenty of room and plenty of seats and everybody spread out so we're on that journey and we'd like it if it's like upon your heart that you know you would maybe do some extra fasting and praying that the lord would uh guide us on just all the necessary steps we have to dig across the street and we have to dig some ditches and lay some fire lines and and so the church down the street has said that we could park in their parking lot so we may have to park in their parking lot use this building there might be some services that we have to rent another place and have another service while we do certain things so we're going to go into a process but i just like to thank the lord that his timing has come material prices have come down we were able to redesign our building in our parking lot to save us you know probably about a 150 to 170 000 and so we've done good we have some money set aside our building fund has about 530 thousand dollars in it and we also have another two hundred thousand dollars set aside so we we're in a good place by god's grace to to grow and to be able to have meetings and to do things so uh i just think that's wonderful a thing that the lord's done so we hope by the second week in january we'll start construction so watch your kids be careful we're going to have to fence areas off and have to move dirt which is going to be a very interesting time but we know who the master builder is right amen paul said we have a master builder right and he'll lay the chief cornerstone so we just trust that you will uh bless that to us amen i'd just like to ask a couple of the deacons just to come up and say a word brother chris where are you at brother chris harris is he here somewhere i thought he's back there come brother chris i beckon thee my brother come speak to the flock amen uh i rather avielle one day he was uh he got to talking to jackson and he said brother jackson he says i see you take your job very seriously and brother jackson said yes he says well he said i saw today that you made two arrests so i thought you know uh they they they say they're the policemen of the church but you know what the motto of a policeman is right to protect and serve so we just asked brother chris say a few words to you god bless you thank you brother david you know i don't have anything specific every day we say is a testimony i think last year or year before we were asked to put something together and i said my thought was he still is and he still is my provider from the day that i felt his call on my heart i haven't regretted it he's supplied my every need he's taking care of everything that we have need of and long story short you know if if i gave a testimony of anything just the sacrifice that you think that you're making sometimes of what i'm doing you know whether it be work or finances or church or even to be here this evening god will always always take care of your needs he will always out pay you always bless you beyond measure and today you know my goodness i just feel blessed beyond measure where i'm at in life and at times i thought the decisions that i made that i thought i was doing for the right reason and i thought i was doing for god i didn't get the outcome that i thought i was going to get i had it planned this is what the heavens are going to open up and we're going to shower down blessings because i did this little thing and it's in god's timing so just we love him we're thankful i have no regrets whatsoever and just for the next year i just my harsh desires to draw closer to him you know you feel you feel the word coming across less of us and more of him and it just becomes so much more personal you know lord i want to believe the word that you have for me i want to accept it and i want to manifest it in me for your will and your plan in my life so that's my that's my heart's desire for this new year i think i saw gary somewhere scary hiding also these deacons really like to help one another amen out all they can and uh and well they're digging up brother gary brother tim why don't you come say we're different i've lost my deacon status amen i appreciate being able to uh just be able to come together look around the room and realize that we're just common vote we're following an uncommon message with uncommon truth and much could be said in about this past year you know the bible talks about unclean things some of them being fouls spirits like frogs and brother branham said that i'll control myself in a minute that a frog was an unclean being because every time he jumped he looked backwards we don't want to look back we won't look forward and my dear dad tells me at least once a week the best is yet to come son the message yet to come and if i could i just hear a couple scriptures that you know the lord quickens things to you and maybe it's just a little passage a little reference and then you get to search in your bible and you find it and it's like that's what i was looking for and then you read a couple verses ahead a couple verses after and say that may be what i was looking for but that's what i really needed and uh that happened to me just a few minutes ago and if you don't mind on the screen if you've got a bible with you tonight romans 14 verses 5 to 9. and uh you know even from the opening march tonight brother cosmic said you know we we could be a lot of places we could be doing a lot of different things but i think this is the best place that we could be in his presence let's just read this we could one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day alike and we see that constantly everybody's got an opinion they want to exalt it or somebody doesn't even have an opinion and they don't care let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind he that regardeth the day regarded it unto the lord and he that regardeth not the day to the lord he does not regard it he that he defeateth to the lord for he giveth god thanks and he that he is not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thanks for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the lord's for this end christ both died and rose and revived that he might be lord both of the dead and the living amen blessed be the name of the lord now there's a couple more scriptures i want to read but having said that we know that if we're going to suffer with him if we're going to reign with him we have to suffer with him galatians 5 24 says and they that our christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust okay so we can say hey that part of us is already dead that that's gone when when you accept calvary the sacrifice of calvary is not only for a future salvation but he crucified the deeds of the flesh we need to honor that and accept that in our own lives first peter 4 verses 1 through 8 please and i believe we're coming to the very last stages of the son of man ministry i believe that brother branham taught us the last stage of every man's ministry was preaching to the eternally lost okay and i'm not saying there won't be one born out of due season because we know we're looking for that lost seed or the last seed but as you know i've said it before our lives are a testimony but what if our life is a judgment message what if we're i mean god's a just god he's going to have you've witnessed on the street in the job place wherever you're at you're a testimony right okay first peter four don't be too long just read this verse 1 for as much then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of god that's what i desire for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the gentiles that's the past when we walked in lasciviousness lust excess of wine revelings back weddings and abominable idolatries a lot of that going on tonight wherein they think it's strange that you run not with them to the same excess of riot speaking evil of you even speaking evil of you that you want to attend their parties to go to their nonsense who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead that's our lord both dead and the living for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead think of that for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to god in the spirit but the end of all things is at hand be therefore sober and watch unto prayer and this is the key verse of course and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins it doesn't mean have charity for the world and with the world it says charity among yourselves so here in the household of faith it's easy to wrap our arms around one another and say brother i love you sister we love you that kind of thing so i just uh i want to lean on those things this year and realize that we're blessed beyond measure we're blessed beyond measure for the message that we've received lord bless you [Applause] that's a good thought gary you could have walked down the center aisle i'm not sure how you follow that up but um you know 2021 just kind of seemed like a continuation of the previous year you know not a lot maybe not a not a lot of milestones or you know maybe didn't stand out as much as 2020 did but you know something just you know i was even just sitting back there thinking about you know just even the years that i've been here already coming upon 10 years now just passes so quickly you know but even in my 10 years here there's many ones that have been here longer but just seen you know many come and he go and um you know the scripture that i was just been thinking about is matthew 24 13. um but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved you know and even if you back up there in verse 11 many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endureth unto the end the shame shall be saved so just just thinking about how much we press on and endure for the lord you know and you know there's been a lot of tough tough things these past couple years for sure you know but we know these trials and tribulations bring about a character you know and so i just i just been thinking about those that endure those that endure because you know i feel like god's looking for someone to fight you know to press through to really fight to not give up you know and brother david he preached uh i preached a service i think it was back in the spring when he when he preached birth pains just really spoke to me you know how a birth pain is a mess and you know it's it's a battle and it's in though it's in that time in that battle in that moment when it's a hot mess that there comes a birth you know and so those are the times he made a statement of those are the times you see a person make the worst decision of their life and so you know i just thinking about how these past couple years we've seen come some come we've seen some leave and just how lord i just want to endure to the end lord i want to press the fight the anchor holds i mean i'm evident of that you know just it's not any of my doing it's what he did for me and so you know it's just been a blessing to to not have the love wax cold because you know his brother dave talked about you know our body is a body of love you know i been to a few churches and you definitely don't see the love that we have here everywhere to have someone care when they don't have to you know to reach out when they don't have to to to take your hand and and even help you press the battle when you when they don't have to but um no i'm just looking forward to some mountaintop victories in 2022 personally um but yeah i didn't have a whole lot tonight just just looking to endure to the end and and keep fighting not give up so god richly bless you [Applause] if objective you the deacons will get ready for the communion uh and then we'll uh pass that out and and i i know brother billy's been sick and he can't talk very much but i miss his voice and and he's given me that look but that's okay he gives me that look i got your i'm going to pay you back but billy see if you come up and squeak out a few sentences for us if you don't mind we love you so much amen as you know brother billy's a real blessing to me and he helps me and it just really is wonderful to [Music] [Applause] steel certainly thankful to the lord for everything you know we have an adversary you know and uh he's is really at every corner to to just tackle you down and you know like brother gary was saying it seems like sometimes it's just one thing after another you know and um amen but we thank god because we know that victory is part of the promise amen and you know just ask that you continue to pray for us um i know you know i stand by the david i feel like just i'm tired of being sick you know you just go from one roller coaster to another you you feel like you're getting better and then you know something else happened and and it's just um you know so many things but i i believe all of that is just part of our experience you know you oftentimes things happen and um and in the natural it seems like the devil is trying to get you to um to to be weak and and to do all of that but yet within that same time frame within your spirit there's a great resolve because you come to realize that not everything is for certain and therefore everything i have i'll put into this everything i have i'll serve god with it everything i have i'll do what i can because we even life is not guaranteed we don't know what tomorrow hold but one thing we know is whatever time frame he's giving us will serve him we'll do all that we can to to serve him and to fight the battle and to continue on and because we know that that's part of the promise he promised to be with us even in us until the end and what we're going to celebrate at the end is to just look back and see how it's been guiding us all along to see how when we were down when we were up when we thought this is too much when we thought we couldn't handle this when we thought this in fact i'll say this it's it's in times like that they really the nature of christ get to be birthed out of us it's not when things seems to just go our way and when we think we understand it all but it's in those birth pains like brother gary just mentioned it's in that time that you really get to become a new person and his image gets to come out of you because why the flesh is dead amen is certainly thankful for that and god bless you amen amen there's definitely come say a few words to us and i have an interpreter if you need one amen we'd also like to mention to the church many of you may have known that brother paul and his family they had a fire in the apartment next door to them and they're they were forced to leave their apartment and the fire marshal hasn't allowed them to go back and get their things or anything and they're staying in a motel so if any of you would feel led and have it on your heart to maybe help them out a little bit in any way i just wanted to make let you know that uh there's a need there and i know many of you have a giving heart but you just don't know the needs but you know so brother paul could sure use any little thing you can talk to him about it or talk to brother billy and we'll see what you can do for them so i just wanted to let you know that it's nice to have brother paul with us and we'll try to get him in the pulpit before he leaves my brother god bless you thank you brother david i wrestle multumask i just want to thank the lord and uh andrej biserich and the entire church penthouse for his grace and his goodness that renews every morning i have a few verses that i would like to read before you she says there was a there was a few sailors back in the in the past that were that were mentioning some things and they were expressing their their way of explaining the uh the pain of of birth when you go through the process of the birth pain god's molding your character and wants to see his image reflected in you yes sometimes it's painful and i want to read that out of isaiah isaiah 45. say i am the lord and there is none else there is no god i girded thee the through thou has not known me yesterday that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none beside me i am the lord and there is none else amen another scripture in psalm 84. psalm 84 5 6 and 7 4 blessed are they that dwell blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still praising thee sailor blessed is the man whose strength is in thee and whose heart are the ways of them who passing through the valley of baca made it be a well a rain also filleth the pools they they go from they go from strength to strength every one of them and zion appeared before god amen i just want to bless you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen [Applause] amen we're going to have communion here in just a moment and the way that we're going to have communion is we'll just come up and take your the little cup of wine and the bread and take it back with you to your seed okay and then we will all take it together so we'll do that here in just a few minutes i'd like just to share my little thought with you and uh if we would turn in your bible to revelation uh the 21st chapter you know the new year is uh everybody's a time of reflection and you know a lot of people they uh say that they're gonna turn over a new leaf this is the year i'm gonna lose 10 pounds this is the year i'm going to exercise this is the year that i'm going to study more than i've ever studied before and in the world everybody's trying to to gauge what lies ahead what's the future whole what's the new year hold uh they they they look back and they say this is what went on next year but what what does the future hold what's going to go on uh what can i look forward to is uh is my house going to be worth more or less am i going to have the new car everybody's worried about what the earthly aspects are of the things that lie ahead of us but i i just would like to say and read a few statements from the message of future home but i'd like to read this because i'm going to tell you the future yeah i'm going to tell you what lies ahead you don't think i can do that i guarantee you i can do it read with me in chapter 21 of the book of revelations as i tell you the future and i saw a new heaven and a new earth from for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city the new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sabbath upon the throne said behold i'll make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful i thought of everything that this world is looking forward to and everything what this world worries about will the stock market crash what does it do what if it profiteth the man if he gains the whole world and loses this i don't have my glasses i might be on my desk but anyway i'll try to read if i could if you can find it in the future home it's paragraph 275 but and it it's uh i just talking about what really we're living for you know that it's it's more than anything else you can't find them okay it's more than everything else that you can see for all right these are pretty good it says let's just listen to what our messenger tells us he says just like all the curse of sin is gone when the holy ghost accepts you see you don't accept it it accepts you see because it's god's attribute see if it's the holy ghost means god's spirit and it's the attribute the thought of god has accepted you because that you were ordained for that purpose just think there's a people that are ordained for that place that he's talking about amen that's where i'm going that's my future amen heaven and earth will pass away but he said write these things because these things are faithful and true they're true and faithful amen he says he says and you're here expressed yourself here on earth and he comes down and gets you hallelujah see you're back here here is where you belong see sin has lost its power that's right the desire hath sin has gone from your heart when the holy spirit comes in you are a restored person amen now listen and when the earth is restored by the same thing there can be no more cursing no more storms no more winds no more typhoons typhoons rather there you are reconciled man and god has met the new earth will be put on its eden beauty again the new earth will spread forth her and her after her baptism of fire just think she'll catch a fire and burn up the elements will burn with a fervent heat all the works in this earth will be burned all the water will explode it'll ignite and blow all everything will blow up volcanoes will erupt and thousands of miles in the air will fly burning hot lava every germ the holy spirit of god will cleanse off every speck of all the sin and everything oh are you sad for that i mean you love this world so much where is this world going what future does this world have they're already creating the diseases that the prophet of god spoke about there's so much of god's word coming to pass and what's transpiring with people that oh i'm waiting for the baptism aren't you amen in everything all the devil will be burned and cast into the lake of fire consuming fire god's wrath of fire no beast will be there to destroy you again when you walk down the road in the flowery garden there will not be any serpents there to hiss at you and bite you with his poisonous feminine oh my won't it be wonderful listen there will be none of that none of that new earth ever mounted up in a little yellow sod bank for a grave none but none of them there none of that new earth will ever be soughted up and put in a little grave there will be no graves there no more passing there no more sorrow there no more tears that's why that's what you're investing in that's what you're living for that's why you've chose the life this message is a message not for people who want a life here this message is to separate a people who believe that this is true and faithful this is a bride message it's not a salvation message it's it's it's it's beyond a healing message this is a rapturing message this is a message that brings people into a rapturing condition proves that they believe every word of god and that they are prepared do you notice how the songs we sung were about beulah land the songs we are sung were about the time that's to come all the songs that we sang and the things that were spoken was endure here because this is coming the new heavens and the new earth is coming man and god has come together bride and groom heaven and earth has embraced each other god has come down to dwell among men his ta his tabernacle is with them there'll be no more sin no more sorrow never will there ever be a tear drop off a mother's cheek over her baby amen it won't be on that new ground no it's redeemed it belongs to him and for his that are redeemed out of it verse 283 notice no graves no teardrops no more bloodshed she'll never be molested by a teardrop or blood no no more wars no no clouds of winter no cold snow upon the rest of her won't lay there no more on it the hot sun will not ever burn its grass hallelujah even the desert shall bring forth roses the old sticky desert will bloom one day like a rose god said so when she is redeemed she will take her first fire baptism there is all kinds of cactus and stickers and everything there now but she'll get a fire baptism coming and like the man was when he was still had hatred malice and strife in him when the fiery baptism comes it cleaned it off no more jealousy no more of nothing just absolutely is a dwelling place for god and remember that's his delegation that's going to meet him over yonder amen that's not just a story that is the truth that's what god said that's what he has promised that's what the bride goes to even the desert he shall shall bloom like a rose you know how they choose a delegation to go to a place you're the delegation of god but don't let this world shake there because all satan's trying to do is present his eden his world and we see what he does wars rumors of wars storms starvations you name it with all the power that man has that can't feed themselves they can't take care of themselves they can't stop killing themselves hatred blooms people are divided the country's divided everywhere but don't you see what he said here he says god and man has embraced heaven and earth has come together that's what this is all about don't be ashamed to bear the reproach of this message for a season and lose what's been totally vindicated to us to be true and faithful remember don't ever get mixed up with the fact that this is salvation there's a lot of people that'll be saved but won't be there but i'm going to a city a new jerusalem that's come down god has a place for those but i want to go on that rapture don't you i want to be a part of that delegation that's going to be in that new city so the lord richly to bless you tonight and and so the brothers have the communion ready and you will come and we'll we'll pray for it and and we'll ask that you know the scriptures tonight we don't won't necessarily read our communion scriptures but we know how to take communion and i don't know if they'll come out we'll when they do but to anyway let's when when you look forward the scripture says no man the man that storeth his treasures here on earth he says they're easily broken in and taken he said but story your treasures in heaven where no man can break in and take them from it you know our freedoms are getting lost the prophet of god said be thankful that you can still meet and still have service in a matter of hours your money can become worth you know your money's already lost six percent of its value what would you do tomorrow if gas went to ten dollars a gallon how much money would you have then if gas went to 50 a gallon you had to walk everywhere just think no matter how bad it gets one day i have a true and faithful promise and god sent us a witness not to witness what he was but to witness the present tense god of what he is and to vindicate to us and prove to us that there's a future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride so god bless you we're going to pray for the bread and wine then you come up and take your take your cup and your piece of bread go back to your seats so we can come through quickly and then we'll all have communion together our heavenly father we know that this bread represents your body lord and it also represents the word being made flesh the body word lord in the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us father and now this broken bread represents that it's a many-membered body but yet this body is now going to be the word made flesh father we are so grateful for that father this wine represents that the price that was paid for the body father that it could come into that unity and you could dwell and the stimulation in the wine representing the life that was in that blood and then that life returning back onto that believer which is represented by the bread heavenly father and we see in communion the perfect revelation of the plan of god as our lord and savior went to calvary father and made the great restitution for our sins that we could be free and once again become in the unity with you a heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride united we come to take this communion now in your precious name we pray amen amen god bless you we're not going to come if you feel led we'll just start with the fir uh yeah why don't we start with the back row so if the people in the back would just come up go to your seats and then we will come so just to anybody that wants communion in the back come up take the bread and the wine and return back to your seat amen we have an open communion whoever wants to come certainly come on yeah those in the overflow can come up please come up anyone in the overflow that would like to come for communion just come up please try to come to both lines [Music] go ahead and come to both lines mary god bless you [Music] hallelujah [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen go ahead come to these lines here brother

praise the lord so wish we were [Music] here's worship [Music] worship [Music] okay [Music] let's all stand together praise the lord amen this is just at midnight right now when the world they're they're all going to shoot off their things and do everything and we're going to take communion amen our recognition that we want this year to be a year that we spend with him in his word that week that we ask him to open our eyes and give us isab that we can see all that he does for us you know the early church what they did is they they had scribes and they recorded all the testimonies and all the miracles just think this year if we recorded all the healings and miracles and things we'd have that we could have testimony that god lives amongst us how many wants the word to be made flesh in us how many want to dedicate their life to this message and stand true to it no matter how the world criticizes it amen let us pray gracious heavenly father we're now going to take communion as a body of believers father if you look down upon this building you see these people that you've brought together from every corner of the earth every walk of life father and you put a seed in them lord to prove your word knowing that they would be your delegation and that the hour would come that they would rise up and take a stand with your word and father you prophesied to them that they had a new heavens and a new earth to go to that you would dry every tear and you'd make all things new and father we're here testifying to you this evening by communion that we believe every word of it with all of our heart so at this time let us take communion each of you take communion amen amen amen praise the lord just keep your little cup with you and and we can you can put it in the i'll have a trash can or something out there for me god bless you may be seated this evening amen you love the lord amen praise the lord amen so we we just we trust the lord that this will be a great year for you um just to give a little insight for sunday morning we have one service this sunday at 11 a.m 11 a.m one service this sunday and then after that we'll be back on our our normal schedule so 1 30 this sunday and we're going to minister out of the 16th chapter of saint john and the 13th verse so that's the scripture that brother branham uses for the world falling apart so i say that so you can all go there read the scripture maybe read the book and each of you put together what sermon you would preach and then we'll see how the holy spirit comes and how many of your thoughts and ideas that are all united i believe with all my heart that this is going to be the year that the body is going to work together more than it ever has that we're going to take on one another's burdens that we're going to believe for things that the world might think is impossible that we're going to see real transformation we're going to see those that have gone out from us returning back home i believe this is the year of the prodigal son i believe with all my heart where it's going to shake to those that are are elected even those that have come up and said well i i don't think see how i can believe the message that god will show them how they can believe the message amen that the i sab is going to pour out on the heart of the true believer you say well what makes a true believer what makes a true believer is any man or woman no matter where they are that god put the seed of god in their heart that's what makes him a true believer and there's not one seed that he planted he said because you were part of the earth how many knows you're part of the earth that's why the blood had to fall on the earth he had to redeem every part of you and he said that it's going to come up because you were called for this purpose so i don't care where they are it could be in the military they could be on a crab boat out in the antarctic ocean but if they are god's children there comes an hour that they're going to return home amen and everybody's got the perfect time of their salvation we always wonder why did he wait till now why did he wait so long to call me why did i have that you know he didn't call you because of you he called you because of the world around you that the timing of your salvation was that it would have an effect or a judgment that's a good thought brother kevin i wanted to start preaching right there buddy or a judgment there's a reason for the timing amen i i you know i think of sister jeanette alexander in her 80s getting baptized and all she could say why did it take me so long why did god had the perfect timing so just remember he's in control all we're asked to do is have what expectation and believe so i i trust this is a year that we'll pray more we don't call group fast it's like we're all going to fast we because the scripture says don't let anybody know that you're fasting but wash your face and that men might know it but any time that you want to give a period of prayer a period of fasting and and drawing closer to the lord and paul talks in the scriptures of husbands and wives separating for a season that they could become closer to the lord anything you can do to draw nigh unto him he'll draw nigh unto you and if he draws nigh into you and he's with you he's going to rub off on everybody that's around you your life worldly the contacts in the world and also the body as our cups fill up over let's be an expectation this is the year in the chinese calendar of the of the water tiger it only comes every 60 years and it represents boldness i thought you know who wants to be a a chinese calendar you know what year it is in god's calendar it's the year of the eagle hallelujah it's those that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings like eagles why don't you play that they shall run and not be weary you believe that amen ass big [Music] believe all things are possible amen look i'm already getting on sunday the brother said let's don't look back what lies ahead for this bride what lies ahead that's the question that's the question we're going to ask sunday what lies ahead you come out tonight you get a preview he said i will show you things to come amen how many believes that the holy spirit came in brother brown's ministry amen he says when the spirit of god come and do these things if you blaspheme that there's no forgiveness in this world or the world to come what was he doing he was showing us things to come how many believes the things that he showed us has arrived amen well if he talked about an invincible church if he talked about a bride united if he talked about people becoming one with the word of god i don't care you may be living in a backflip state you may have the world tied up in your lives you may have all kinds of weaknesses but let me tell you there's a promised time of a deliverance of a dedication of a separation of a cleansing of a coming out let that be right provided god said when you're sick he said you look at a well man sitting in front of you if that's for the physical how much more for the spiritual if that if that's a type of the physical if you're sick you're laying there and you're sick and you're weak you've got to imagine yourself i i don't like to use the word imagine you've got to have a vision of yourself standing up whole well eating if you don't feel you can put one thing down you sit at the table and you believe and you look to the day that you're gonna take it you see that well man and you just keep walking towards it and walking towards you how about you looking at yourselves as spiritually victorious with the faith and silver and gold have i none but that which i have i give that i have an experience and a a power and not my power but his power in me because he promised me the works that i do shall you do also and when it leaves he said the problem with the church was he said that they put it all in the pulpit and it became nickelodeonism church take it back from the pulpit take it back from the ministry take it back into your lives amen you don't need nobody laying hands on the sick you lay hands on the sin you testify you do the works amen i believe this is the year of the congregation standing up claiming who they are the words of life looking down the road and seeing miracles and seeing visions and seeing god move in their midst how would you like to be able to come and and recognize the spirit recognize when you heard one song about view the land and you heard a song about going to that city and you hear this song you can sense the spirit how many like be more sensitive to the spirit of god to see a move when you when you you go home and you read a you read a scripture and you come to church and and that's the same psalm or that's the same scripture that the preacher preaches that's the same words that were on your heart and you recognize that as being the spirit of god speaking to you i don't want to miss them this year do you so lord give me i sab that i might see amen oh i just think what what is lady you'll see it's blind miserable pouring neck in and don't moan they can't see the lord show me show me all things show me things that have come show me your move of your spirit let me see your great mighty hand working with my life make it personal amen make it personal let's stand [Music] together amen oh they that wait upon the we lord their strength they shall mount up with they shall run oh lord that's me that's me hallelujah that's me lord a knock in the face [Music] will you say that's me lord shall we [Music] hallelujah let's sing for our dismissal song i am thinking of a rapture amen are you thinking about your 401k i hope it grows amen but i've got an investment i'm investing in the city that's coming down all right hallelujah that's where i got my stock hey amen in the city that's coming down oh i am [Music] is [Music] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] oh there will be [Music] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] oh [Music] redemption story [Music] [Applause] again [Music] gathering in [Music] [Music] and how we'll sing [Music] then the savior will give her to prepare the banquet [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] all of sin how we'll shout and how we'll sing with the redeemer [Music] before we dismiss tonight is there any sick amongst us that need prayer that you're sick and anybody that needs prayer i hope there's none but if you're sick in your body and you need prayer tonight you need god to touch your body i believe god touches the body don't you amen we certainly believe in praying for the sick i think we need to do more of it so anyway lord bless you we wanted to offer the opportunity if there's anyone of sick that we pray for him because i believe the prayers of the righteous people availeth much amen so god can richly bless you tonight let us bow our heads as we're dismissed brother matthew why don't you come dismiss us in prayer please [Music] lord jesus we're thankful to be gathered together tonight around your word and with your called elected and chosen lord if it wasn't for your grace and mercy we would be gathered other places lord if our lives had not been taken by the world where would we be lord if it wasn't for your grace and your mercy so lord we just rejoice in the things that we've heard and the testimonies lord and as paul said he wanted to stir our minds things that we know but want to disturb our minds of of what you've done and what you've said lord and so we're just so thankful lord may we just go home rejoicing lord and may we look at this new year lord not what we can do but what you're doing through your bride lord and we know lord jesus that we're one step closer to the change of our bodies lord so may we as the scripture says look up for our redemption draweth nigh lord we know the hours right upon us lord your word says
