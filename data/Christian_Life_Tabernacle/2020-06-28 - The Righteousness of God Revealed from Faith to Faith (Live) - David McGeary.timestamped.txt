[47:55] your love is so manifested to us
[48:01] lord we ask for eyes sav that we could
[48:04] see
[48:05] this great love that you have for us
[48:08] father we ask for sensitivity of your
[48:11] holy spirit
[48:13] that we could feel this great love that
[48:16] you have for us
[48:17] and father above all we ask that this
[48:20] great love you have
[48:22] for us may be shed abroad in our hearts
[48:25] to others we ask you to bless us this
[48:28] morning and help us
[48:30] in jesus precious name we pray amen
[48:35] amen god bless you may be seated for a
[48:38] few moments this morning
[48:41] uh i'm i'm i'm done looks like the jesse
[48:45] james gang up here is um
[48:48] you guys can go thank you i don't think
[48:51] we're having
[48:51] are we having a baby dedication this
[48:53] morning
[48:55] is that still i don't see the
[48:58] family okay
[49:02] things change over the weekend i guess
[49:04] you guys realize that
[49:05] so i think we're okay if not we'll
[49:10] make arrangements uh um
[49:14] you know it uh it just seems like we're
[49:17] getting back on our feet
[49:18] and and uh
[49:21] the government came up with another uh
[49:26] you know wanting to slow things down
[49:29] again you know just to kind of
[49:32] give you my viewpoint on things
[49:35] and i'm certainly not afraid of this
[49:40] virus
[49:43] you know one of the great benefits we
[49:47] have as a congregation
[49:50] is that 90
[49:54] you know of our congregation is under
[49:57] 50 years old so we're a very young
[50:00] congregation so we're very resilient
[50:03] and strong so that part of it
[50:07] we're very thankful for the other
[50:10] approach is is that as a
[50:14] as a a church
[50:18] in our country they give churches
[50:22] certain benefits
[50:25] is the best way i could say it our
[50:28] church owns
[50:29] all this property here and they don't
[50:33] tax us for it
[50:35] um we have this building and they don't
[50:37] tax the building
[50:40] they give us tax credits
[50:43] for monies that we give to
[50:47] church so the government
[50:51] extends to us very many benefits
[50:55] as being a church
[50:59] they want to give us beverage
[51:02] benefits because all in all churches
[51:06] help the community they teach to buy the
[51:09] laws
[51:10] they teach to be safe they teach to
[51:13] love one another to not steal
[51:17] not kill not murder and so
[51:21] there's social benefits to
[51:24] uh a church and for that reason
[51:28] they extend to us a lot of
[51:32] benefits if you are a tax accountant you
[51:35] would understand
[51:37] the number of benefits that
[51:40] the church receives as a minister i'm
[51:43] able to receive certain benefits from
[51:47] the government also so i just think
[51:50] that in a way of
[51:54] and i think it's only fair that when
[51:57] they ask us to do something
[51:59] after extending to us so many benefits
[52:04] that we don't stand up and be rebellious
[52:08] like it's owed to us you know
[52:11] so uh that's why when they asked we went
[52:14] ahead
[52:15] and extended uh that we would go ahead
[52:19] and do our best to comply
[52:21] this time they're saying for july
[52:25] well i don't know how good that
[52:28] virus does in 110 degree temperature
[52:32] but you know i mean we could turn off
[52:34] the air and kill that thing in a minute
[52:36] you know what i mean
[52:38] so but anyway so that's just
[52:42] um our approach and
[52:46] we do have streaming now
[52:49] so those of you who are
[52:54] listening and watching at home
[52:58] we hope that you feel a part of us
[53:01] and so they've asked certain things
[53:04] and they've asked that we would wear
[53:07] masks
[53:08] outside wearing masks inside
[53:11] is optional but
[53:16] so when you go outside we have mass
[53:19] there
[53:20] like i said we have gloves if you're
[53:22] worried about touching
[53:24] something just slip on a glove and
[53:28] the and that'll make you feel safer
[53:31] or if you feel you've touched something
[53:34] then there's always
[53:35] hand sanitizer that you can put on
[53:38] maybe you can carry a little bit with
[53:40] you and then
[53:42] we just do all that we can do because
[53:45] we want to be good neighbors in our
[53:48] community so
[53:50] we'll get through this we're going to
[53:53] have
[53:54] it's going to cause a lot of trouble i'm
[53:55] glad that we're in summer we don't have
[53:57] to worry about sunday school
[54:00] but we're working on all the things that
[54:03] we need to accommodate us not only
[54:07] now under this uh
[54:11] executive order from our governor
[54:14] but in the future and in our new
[54:18] building if the lord jesus would so
[54:20] provide to us a new sanctuary would be a
[54:24] larger than this it would hold
[54:28] more people than this twice as many
[54:31] people
[54:32] and has a lot of room for expansion but
[54:35] we're trying to put into all that all
[54:38] the things that will make
[54:41] going to church easier
[54:44] where you're sitting now this part of
[54:45] the church will be turned into sunday
[54:48] school rooms
[54:49] and i don't know probably from about
[54:51] where brother wade is sitting
[54:54] right back here all the rest of this
[54:56] will all be taken out and turned into a
[54:58] fellowship area
[55:00] so by god's grace we have plans
[55:03] and vision we can't do it
[55:06] in the flesh but god can do it by his
[55:09] spirit
[55:10] and his might so we just ask you to bear
[55:13] with us join with us those of you are at
[55:15] home
[55:16] we're working as hard as we can to
[55:19] provide
[55:20] a place for you in the sanctuary
[55:23] it seems like we have a little more room
[55:26] today we could have
[55:27] added a few more people but
[55:30] anyway let's just be patient and do our
[55:33] due diligence and
[55:35] and you know we're supposed to let the
[55:37] love of god be shed abroad in our heart
[55:40] by the holy spirit
[55:43] that goes for people that don't love you
[55:46] amen oh let's stand this morning let's
[55:50] read a couple scriptures and
[55:52] we're just going to have a time of
[55:53] fellowship and
[55:56] talking a little bit and uh
[56:00] uh this uh little
[56:04] thought i want to bring is kind of uh
[56:09] um you know just stir us up
[56:12] and to and so i kind of wrote a note
[56:15] down
[56:16] as if your part in the plan of god
[56:20] your part in the plan of god or if i
[56:24] could
[56:25] also say that god had a a
[56:28] role for you to play
[56:31] and uh in the message that we're
[56:35] referring to
[56:36] is up you know as out of the message
[56:39] the unveiling of god and so let's turn
[56:43] to two scriptures
[56:44] this morning and then we will read
[56:48] uh several other scriptures and so let's
[56:51] turn
[56:52] into the gospel of john
[56:56] uh the gospel of john
[56:59] chapter one starting with verse
[57:02] one and um
[57:06] so one of the young girls in church
[57:10] young lady i think she's
[57:12] 12 or so she said every time
[57:15] brother david
[57:19] calls for scripture he reads it before i
[57:21] can find it
[57:23] in my bible so everybody find your
[57:27] uh bible scripture we're going to read
[57:31] the
[57:31] first verse of the first chapter
[57:35] of saint john and then we're going to
[57:37] read the
[57:38] uh 14th verse and i know all of you that
[57:43] are spiritual can figure out this sermon
[57:45] from these two scriptures
[57:48] um a lot of times when brother brennan
[57:51] would minister he'd read a scripture and
[57:54] then he'd preach a sermon and i never
[57:56] could
[57:56] tie it back to the scripture but he
[57:59] he had that ability to take a scripture
[58:03] and expand on it beyond any realm
[58:06] that i ever thought that that scripture
[58:09] was in
[58:11] but that so these scriptures will be
[58:14] very obvious
[58:15] to you but let's read this in saint john
[58:19] that first chapter and the first verse
[58:24] in the beginning was the word
[58:28] and in genesis it says in the beginning
[58:31] was god
[58:33] now john comes back and says in the
[58:35] beginning was the word
[58:37] so now he's in his great spiritual
[58:40] wisdom
[58:41] he's not going to contradict genesis
[58:46] but he's going to show us how genesis 1
[58:49] unveiled okay
[58:53] so how that genesis one
[58:57] in the beginning god how that we
[59:00] now have been able to make contact
[59:04] with that god in the beginning was the
[59:08] word
[59:09] and the word was god
[59:12] and and in the beginning was the word
[59:16] and the word was with god and the word
[59:21] was god and the same was
[59:24] in the beginning with god
[59:27] so in the beginning was
[59:31] the word and the word was god amen and
[59:34] in john
[59:35] 14 the same chapter in the 14th verse
[59:39] it says and the word was made
[59:43] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[59:47] his glory
[59:48] the glory as the only begotten of the
[59:51] father
[59:52] full of grace and truth god bless you
[59:56] you may be seated
[1:00:04] uh we fellowshipped last week
[1:00:07] a little bit as were
[1:00:10] on this subject of the unveiling
[1:00:14] of god and we we talked about
[1:00:20] manifestation and what manifestation
[1:00:23] meant
[1:00:24] was to make something clear and
[1:00:27] obvious and or or
[1:00:30] to show or display
[1:00:33] and so we understand that that was god's
[1:00:37] plan and his will one of his
[1:00:41] great three objectives was one
[1:00:44] was to uh reveal himself
[1:00:49] to make himself known and then we know
[1:00:52] another objective was to have
[1:00:54] preeminence
[1:00:56] in other words that was to be god to be
[1:01:00] worshipped of god
[1:01:01] to have preeminence
[1:01:04] so it was his desire to have a people
[1:01:08] that he had preeminence over
[1:01:11] or in other words preeminence would mean
[1:01:14] that
[1:01:14] he was the most important part of
[1:01:17] everything
[1:01:19] he designed creation to reflect himself
[1:01:23] therefore he has preeminence
[1:01:26] in creation because
[1:01:29] everything is set in order but it was
[1:01:33] his
[1:01:33] order that said it if you read the next
[1:01:36] verse down it says
[1:01:38] everything that was made was made by him
[1:01:40] and there was nothing made
[1:01:42] that was not made by him
[1:01:46] so he had the preeminence
[1:01:49] and his preeminence or his
[1:01:53] uh i don't like the only word i can come
[1:01:56] up with
[1:01:57] um you use your vocabulary because i'm
[1:01:59] cert it's certainly greater than mine
[1:02:02] was to control he he
[1:02:06] he had uh his preeminence because
[1:02:10] he was the one that controlled the order
[1:02:12] of things or made the order of things
[1:02:15] so you know i love that song who hung
[1:02:18] the stars
[1:02:19] in the sky you know who made the earth
[1:02:22] who made the sun to rise that was the
[1:02:25] preeminence
[1:02:26] of god that was doing it so he had
[1:02:30] preeminence
[1:02:31] and and so he wanted to reveal himself
[1:02:35] and and then or so we saw the
[1:02:39] the first revelation of god in the
[1:02:43] things that he
[1:02:44] created and we saw the scriptures said
[1:02:47] that the invisible things of god
[1:02:50] were made clear by the visible things
[1:02:53] that we could see
[1:02:55] so we we talked last week that god was
[1:02:58] un
[1:02:58] invisible but the invisible
[1:03:02] god wanted to show
[1:03:05] himself or manifest himself
[1:03:08] so we talked along those lines and
[1:03:12] and we took uh from that we took the
[1:03:15] subject
[1:03:16] that circumstances
[1:03:21] cause manifestation manifestation
[1:03:24] comes from circumstances
[1:03:27] so there has to be a circumstance arise
[1:03:31] in order to bring forth the manifest
[1:03:35] station and we talked about jesus at the
[1:03:38] wedding
[1:03:39] uh supper that uh he had this
[1:03:43] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:03:45] bodily
[1:03:46] so in the fact that god dwelt in him
[1:03:50] he had creative power in him
[1:03:53] amen he possessed creative power
[1:03:57] he had the personality of god
[1:04:00] he was god in person form in flesh form
[1:04:04] so he had the personality of god and
[1:04:07] but his time wasn't yet so a
[1:04:11] circumstance
[1:04:12] arose at a wedding feast which
[1:04:15] mary's family was involved in
[1:04:19] and she didn't want no reflection on the
[1:04:22] the bride and and the bridegroom
[1:04:26] i couldn't just see that love of mary
[1:04:30] you know the concern she had for that
[1:04:32] couple
[1:04:33] how she felt for that couple how
[1:04:35] embarrassing
[1:04:36] it would be you know that and
[1:04:40] she didn't want people to draw unfair
[1:04:43] conclusions about the family
[1:04:47] you know oh they're poor or oh they
[1:04:50] didn't care
[1:04:51] isn't that terrible about human nature
[1:04:54] how
[1:04:54] we always draw such unkind conclusions
[1:04:58] that most of the time our discernment
[1:05:02] is negative you know why people do
[1:05:04] things that
[1:05:07] reason people do things there's always
[1:05:10] such a suspicion
[1:05:12] you know but perfect love casts out
[1:05:14] suspicion
[1:05:16] and so i just could feel how mary must
[1:05:18] have
[1:05:19] loved that couple how much she must have
[1:05:21] loved that family
[1:05:23] and and she wanted to spare them
[1:05:27] embarrassment and gossip and didn't want
[1:05:31] that
[1:05:31] wedding and that marriage to get started
[1:05:34] out
[1:05:35] on that foot so
[1:05:38] she went to where that she knew god was
[1:05:44] she knew this boy comes from god
[1:05:47] you'll never convince mary in any other
[1:05:50] way
[1:05:51] because she believed the word of god
[1:05:53] before there was any sign
[1:05:55] that she had a child and she said
[1:05:59] even so lord let it be done
[1:06:02] according to thy will now
[1:06:07] i'm going to share some of my personal
[1:06:09] views okay
[1:06:12] i believe mary did this for god
[1:06:18] you understand what i'm saying mary knew
[1:06:22] that she accepted
[1:06:25] the holy spirit
[1:06:29] creating a body
[1:06:33] in her womb
[1:06:36] you understand she had given herself
[1:06:39] to the hand of the lord so if i could
[1:06:43] say that
[1:06:44] if uh if
[1:06:47] you could accept my expression for that
[1:06:51] so she knew she had uh
[1:06:54] you know uh something in her pocket you
[1:06:57] know what i mean
[1:06:58] so she had done this for god
[1:07:02] now she was going to ask god to do
[1:07:04] something
[1:07:05] for her you understand she
[1:07:10] she she knew that
[1:07:13] she had given herself she bore the
[1:07:16] reproach
[1:07:18] she was willingly bore the reproach
[1:07:22] of being called whatever
[1:07:25] wicked names they would call a person
[1:07:29] that would bring forth an italian
[1:07:31] illegitimate
[1:07:32] child and she bore the rumors and
[1:07:35] everything
[1:07:36] and she bore that reproach now there
[1:07:39] came a time
[1:07:41] that the reproach she bore that she
[1:07:44] could ask a favor
[1:07:46] so she went to her son and said son they
[1:07:51] have no wine or she may have called them
[1:07:54] jesus jesus they have
[1:07:56] no wine and he said
[1:07:59] my time has not yet come it's not time
[1:08:03] for me to manifest
[1:08:05] myself it's not time for me to show
[1:08:09] to show what that i am
[1:08:12] and what my purpose here on earth
[1:08:16] is but the circumstance was there
[1:08:20] and because of the circumstance the
[1:08:22] circumstance
[1:08:23] caused jesus the manifestation
[1:08:26] of who jesus was to come forth
[1:08:30] and knowing what she had done for the
[1:08:33] father
[1:08:35] and not that she was bargaining with god
[1:08:38] but can you imagine the relationship she
[1:08:42] must have had
[1:08:43] with almighty god well this child was
[1:08:47] being formed in her womb
[1:08:50] oh can you imagine the glory
[1:08:54] and the presence of the lord that
[1:08:58] she walked in so much so
[1:09:01] that eliza this child leapt in the womb
[1:09:04] when she come into his presence
[1:09:08] i believe she knew that she could talk
[1:09:10] to the father
[1:09:12] and i i and i think that she knew
[1:09:15] and remember this now that
[1:09:20] in jesus he was the word
[1:09:24] okay so in him was
[1:09:27] ask anything of the father
[1:09:30] in my name and he will grant it
[1:09:35] so when she approached him
[1:09:39] she knew who he was and in him
[1:09:43] she knew if she asked anything of the
[1:09:45] father in his name and that's what she
[1:09:47] did
[1:09:48] son jesus
[1:09:52] i'm asking you jesus the name of the
[1:09:55] father
[1:09:57] to make this one
[1:10:03] hallelujah how many knows the wine got
[1:10:06] made
[1:10:07] amen amen so
[1:10:10] the circumstance caused
[1:10:14] things great uh
[1:10:17] reasons behind things so
[1:10:20] you you've got to understand nothing
[1:10:23] happens
[1:10:24] by chance god knows what he's doing
[1:10:28] he's got reasons to do things that we
[1:10:31] don't know
[1:10:32] and and we we don't know the beginning
[1:10:35] from the end
[1:10:36] and that's what he said he puts the he
[1:10:38] puts it the kingdom of god within a man
[1:10:41] that he doesn't know the beginning or
[1:10:44] the end
[1:10:45] so even in the midst of all this
[1:10:49] uh time in our politics
[1:10:52] time in our government time and
[1:10:54] everything god's
[1:10:56] hand is working towards his end
[1:10:59] the word of god is the final say
[1:11:03] in any matter if you want to know the
[1:11:07] final outcome
[1:11:08] the final outcome is always the word of
[1:11:11] god
[1:11:13] i i remember i i had an opportunity
[1:11:17] one year to minister
[1:11:21] at brother uh tim's
[1:11:24] in in louisiana rather tim pruitt
[1:11:28] sister julia's uncle and
[1:11:32] and the the message i
[1:11:35] ministered there someone just brought it
[1:11:36] to my attention the other day
[1:11:38] was the unseen force
[1:11:42] the unseen power and the unseen four
[1:11:46] so when david went forth to meet goliath
[1:11:50] there was an unseen power there and
[1:11:53] unseen
[1:11:53] force this i'm kind of going in this
[1:11:56] direction so
[1:11:58] you know goliath saw david
[1:12:02] what he didn't see was the unseen power
[1:12:06] or the unseen form and and and when
[1:12:09] when gideon uh
[1:12:13] went forth they they didn't see the
[1:12:15] unseen
[1:12:17] power the unseen force that was a gideon
[1:12:20] they didn't see the unseen fourth with
[1:12:22] samson
[1:12:23] so the unseen four they never could see
[1:12:26] that
[1:12:29] but yet it was there and and so
[1:12:33] we know that in the midst of everything
[1:12:36] in our lives
[1:12:37] all the conflicts all the troubles and
[1:12:40] everything that we're going through
[1:12:41] all the inconveniences and
[1:12:45] and our flesh begins to disagree with
[1:12:47] the conveniences of the disc convenience
[1:12:51] our flesh begins to
[1:12:53] argue in war against the circumstances
[1:12:56] or
[1:12:56] our flesh uh goes in and
[1:13:00] we find ourselves wanting to make a
[1:13:02] statement
[1:13:05] and but if we could sit back for a
[1:13:07] moment
[1:13:08] and understand that he that all
[1:13:11] things are in his control
[1:13:15] that all things are allowed and many
[1:13:18] things that god does we don't quite
[1:13:22] see the great purpose behind
[1:13:26] but we have to know that there's a god
[1:13:28] behind the purpose
[1:13:31] so there's an unseen force
[1:13:35] that's with us in all this
[1:13:38] there's an unseen force that's with his
[1:13:41] church
[1:13:42] there's an unseen force that will keep
[1:13:44] his congregation
[1:13:46] safe and we'll keep them together
[1:13:50] there's an unseen force that is there to
[1:13:54] to to stand on our behalf and we can't
[1:13:57] let
[1:13:58] our faith be weakened because
[1:14:01] faith is the evidence of things hoped
[1:14:04] for
[1:14:04] but not yet seen
[1:14:08] so we we know that this
[1:14:11] force is with us and you know you talk
[1:14:14] about circumstances
[1:14:17] i i thought of paul
[1:14:22] and if you just wanted to look at it
[1:14:24] with me a little bit
[1:14:25] uh we're going to read a scripture a
[1:14:27] little bit above that just a
[1:14:29] time of fellowship and bible study but
[1:14:31] go over to acts
[1:14:32] uh the 7th chapter
[1:14:39] and the 57th verse and we'll just read a
[1:14:41] few verses
[1:14:43] and how many know
[1:14:49] who paul is
[1:14:52] okay we'd all raise our hand and say we
[1:14:55] know who he
[1:14:56] is right we know that he was the first
[1:14:59] church age messenger
[1:15:01] we know that he brought the gospel
[1:15:05] to the gentiles we know
[1:15:08] that he wrote most of the
[1:15:12] new testament so we know
[1:15:17] what he is but do you ever take a moment
[1:15:21] to consider
[1:15:22] what he was
[1:15:26] because in what paul was
[1:15:31] that circumstance is
[1:15:35] what revealed what he
[1:15:38] is so let's just take that and
[1:15:42] and this is i hope this is great comfort
[1:15:45] for you that have loved ones that are
[1:15:49] maybe not doing so well or
[1:15:52] have made choices
[1:15:55] against the word of god
[1:16:01] and and there's many people who have
[1:16:06] fallen to the great cunningness
[1:16:10] of intellect and the warring of
[1:16:14] the adversary against this message in
[1:16:17] the word of god
[1:16:20] but i hope that we can take comfort
[1:16:23] in knowing that
[1:16:27] god can do all things so let's listen to
[1:16:29] this
[1:16:30] peter just got done giving him an
[1:16:32] exhortation
[1:16:35] and they said and this is and they cried
[1:16:37] out

[1:17:03] open up
[1:17:04] because everybody comes in with a mask
[1:17:06] and you don't know who's a
[1:17:08] thief and who is it a thief you know
[1:17:10] what i mean and
[1:17:12] you don't know who's infected and who's
[1:17:14] not infected and
[1:17:16] you know and and you know i don't know
[1:17:20] all that stuff but i know one thing
[1:17:22] i know that nothing can pluck us out of
[1:17:24] the palm
[1:17:25] of his hand and i know that if god
[1:17:28] before you who can be against you
[1:17:30] right so i just rest in that how about
[1:17:33] that well will we just rest right there
[1:17:36] and when they heard these things they
[1:17:38] were cut
[1:17:39] that's uh acts 7

[1:17:51] internet

[1:17:58] 7 verse 54 and when they heard these
[1:18:01] things
[1:18:02] they were cut to to the heart
[1:18:05] and they gnashed on him with their teeth
[1:18:09] but he being filled of the holy ghost
[1:18:13] looked up steadfast into heaven and saw
[1:18:16] the glory of god
[1:18:18] and jesus sitting on the right hand of
[1:18:20] god
[1:18:21] and he said behold i see the heavens
[1:18:25] open and the son of man
[1:18:27] sitting on the right hand of god
[1:18:31] and they cried out with a loud voice
[1:18:34] and stopped their ears and ran upon him
[1:18:38] with one accord they just couldn't take
[1:18:40] that
[1:18:42] that just put them over the top
[1:18:47] man they i just think they thought
[1:18:49] blasphemy huh
[1:18:51] and they cast them out of the city and
[1:18:54] stoned him
[1:18:56] and the witnesses laid their clothes
[1:19:01] at a young man's feet whose name was
[1:19:04] saul
[1:19:05] and they stoned stephen calling
[1:19:08] upon god and saying
[1:19:11] lord jesus and they stoned stephen
[1:19:15] calling upon god saying lord jesus
[1:19:18] receive my spirit
[1:19:20] and and he
[1:19:24] kneeled down and cried with a loud voice
[1:19:28] lord lay not this sin
[1:19:31] to their charge now you know who that
[1:19:35] was speaking
[1:19:37] amen there was something in stephen
[1:19:42] something that dwelled in there
[1:19:47] and laid this not to their charge
[1:19:51] and when he had said
[1:19:55] this he fell asleep
[1:20:00] amen
[1:20:03] and saul was consenting
[1:20:07] unto his death
[1:20:11] and at that time there was a great
[1:20:14] persecution
[1:20:15] against the church which was in
[1:20:18] jerusalem
[1:20:20] and they were all scattered abroad
[1:20:22] throughout
[1:20:23] the regions of judea and samaria
[1:20:27] except the apostles and devout men
[1:20:31] carried stephen to his burial
[1:20:35] and made great lamentation over him
[1:20:38] and as for saul he made havoc
[1:20:42] of the church entering into every house
[1:20:47] and hauling men and women and committing
[1:20:50] them
[1:20:51] into prison therefore they were
[1:20:54] scattered abroad
[1:20:56] when everywhere preaching
[1:21:00] the gospel what a
[1:21:05] what a circumstance
[1:21:08] to bring the word of god to pass
[1:21:12] and what a testimony that god
[1:21:19] allowed saul actually to persecute the
[1:21:22] church
[1:21:23] and as you read later on in the
[1:21:25] scriptures the scripture says that
[1:21:27] paul's testimony was
[1:21:29] that the one that used to kill us
[1:21:32] is now one of us
[1:21:37] it shows you the ability
[1:21:40] of god to transform
[1:21:43] things okay it lets you know
[1:21:47] that that when you have a teenager that
[1:21:50] goes through a season of rebellion
[1:21:54] you can just think you know saul he
[1:21:56] consented to the death of stephen
[1:21:59] and god brought him a pillar of fire you
[1:22:02] know and we can
[1:22:03] we can see that all these circumstances
[1:22:05] here are beautifully orchestrated
[1:22:09] by by god and so circumstances
[1:22:13] arise that
[1:22:16] and they cause the circumstance
[1:22:20] causes the manifestation so
[1:22:23] god was a healer and
[1:22:26] and that was in god that attribute
[1:22:30] was in god but that attribute could
[1:22:33] never be
[1:22:34] manifested until there was the
[1:22:38] circumstance
[1:22:39] of sickness so the circumstance of
[1:22:43] sickness was allowed
[1:22:45] that the
[1:22:48] attribute of god or the manifestation
[1:22:55] that god was a healer or to make it
[1:22:59] clear and obvious
[1:23:02] that god was a healer
[1:23:06] and that god could show or
[1:23:09] display that he was a healer the
[1:23:12] sickness had to be there
[1:23:15] else else he could have never shown that
[1:23:18] he was a healer
[1:23:20] if everybody would have continued and
[1:23:23] adam was
[1:23:24] in the garden no sickness no
[1:23:27] death no nothing and everything the very
[1:23:31] fact that god was a healer would have
[1:23:33] went
[1:23:33] unknown
[1:23:36] okay so that was an invisible part of
[1:23:39] god
[1:23:41] so that part of god couldn't be seen
[1:23:45] so there had to be a fleshly
[1:23:48] manifestation
[1:23:51] in order for that attribute
[1:23:54] to be seen so god allowed
[1:23:59] sin he couldn't make adam fall
[1:24:07] because adam was the son of god
[1:24:10] but and adam possessed
[1:24:14] the attributes of his father
[1:24:20] in fact adam was the first son of god
[1:24:25] so it was it was
[1:24:29] right in adam he was without sin
[1:24:32] but he allowed he took a byproduct
[1:24:37] and when he created that byproduct that
[1:24:40] that
[1:24:41] that part of that byproduct that
[1:24:45] reasoning part of that by
[1:24:47] byproduct he knew that would fall
[1:24:52] but he also knew in adam
[1:24:55] was the attribute
[1:24:58] that he would lay his life down
[1:25:01] for who he loved adam was a perfect type
[1:25:05] of christ
[1:25:07] the first adam was a living soul the
[1:25:10] first
[1:25:11] but the second adam was a quickening
[1:25:14] spirit so these circumstances
[1:25:18] had to come forth so we understand that
[1:25:21] what one of the parts of
[1:25:25] what god wanted to do was
[1:25:29] he wanted to manifest himself
[1:25:33] he wanted to make himself known so as
[1:25:37] you sit here
[1:25:38] in your the part your part
[1:25:41] in in the plan of god you have to
[1:25:44] understand that
[1:25:46] god wants to make himself known to you
[1:25:49] that you so you're part of that he
[1:25:52] couldn't make himself
[1:25:53] known if there wasn't somebody to make
[1:25:56] himself
[1:25:57] known to
[1:26:00] so god allowed us to fall
[1:26:04] he eternally secured us by putting our
[1:26:07] name
[1:26:08] in the lamb's book of life but he let us
[1:26:11] come in this flesh he let us come
[1:26:14] into these circumstances
[1:26:18] the circumstance of sinful flesh the
[1:26:21] circumstance of being born in
[1:26:23] iniquity and shaped in sin and coming
[1:26:26] into the world speaking in
[1:26:28] lies how many would you think
[1:26:31] if you were to design your own self
[1:26:40] what you would design
[1:26:44] well i wouldn't inside myself
[1:26:46] bald-headed and big nosed
[1:26:48] come on
[1:26:52] right would you have designed yourself a
[1:26:55] liar
[1:26:59] huh you wouldn't have designed any of
[1:27:03] those things in you
[1:27:07] but the circumstance
[1:27:13] is the only way that it could be
[1:27:16] manifested so god
[1:27:18] secured us to be just
[1:27:21] and then allowed us to be in a
[1:27:24] circumstance
[1:27:26] that he could make himself known to us
[1:27:32] that's what he wanted to do he wanted to
[1:27:35] make himself known
[1:27:37] he wanted man to know he was a healer he
[1:27:39] wanted man to know he was a savior
[1:27:42] he wanted man to know he was a deliverer
[1:27:45] and you couldn't know he was a deliverer
[1:27:48] until you were in a circumstance
[1:27:50] he had to deliver you from
[1:27:55] well believe me adam wasn't in
[1:27:58] any type of circumstance
[1:28:01] that he wanted to be delivered from
[1:28:07] in fact we're going back to the
[1:28:09] circumstance
[1:28:10] that ada was in in the beginning how
[1:28:13] many
[1:28:14] knows that we're going back to eden
[1:28:17] eden was heaven on earth
[1:28:21] eden walking in the cool of the evening
[1:28:23] the great
[1:28:24] new jerusalem is going to set it forth
[1:28:26] and it's going to be
[1:28:28] back in that beautiful eden
[1:28:32] and so oh i've got a lot of thoughts on
[1:28:36] that
[1:28:37] about adam would eventually have created
[1:28:40] that
[1:28:42] new jerusalem
[1:28:46] you believe that you don't have to
[1:28:48] because that's
[1:28:49] what i feel in my heart but
[1:28:52] i love you and i feel the freedom that
[1:28:56] i could be able to do that but i
[1:28:59] derived that because enoch had visions
[1:29:01] and that's why that
[1:29:02] he built built that testament
[1:29:06] as a testimony of what was and uh
[1:29:10] so anyway so we we we understand that
[1:29:13] that the circumstances so we we see that
[1:29:16] god
[1:29:17] wanted to do that he wanted to make
[1:29:19] himself known so
[1:29:20] right where you're sitting now this
[1:29:23] morning or listening wherever that
[1:29:25] you are uh in our congregation this
[1:29:28] is for our congregation and and uh
[1:29:32] i know maybe other people spy in but
[1:29:35] for those of us that are here that are
[1:29:38] part of us
[1:29:38] online this morning and sitting in our
[1:29:40] service
[1:29:42] right where you sit you should know god
[1:29:45] wants to make himself known to me
[1:29:49] and we should be an expectation of that
[1:29:54] that any moment
[1:29:57] in any circumstance god can make himself
[1:30:01] known and and so that's
[1:30:05] a part of the part we play
[1:30:08] in the plan of god we play
[1:30:12] the in the part of plan of god that god
[1:30:16] wants to make himself known
[1:30:19] to us now i just want to take a few
[1:30:22] moments this morning
[1:30:24] and
[1:30:27] talk about another part
[1:30:31] of what god wanted to do
[1:30:34] he wanted to have preeminence
[1:30:39] now don't look at preeminence the way
[1:30:42] we do in a carnal mind
[1:30:47] so in a carnal mind we would think
[1:30:49] preeminence is be the one who's the boss
[1:30:54] you know or the one who gets the most
[1:30:59] recognition or praise we would
[1:31:02] call base preeminence on a totem pole
[1:31:06] of fat but that's not what the
[1:31:10] preeminence that god was talking about
[1:31:14] god wanted to dwell
[1:31:20] in that was the preeminence that god
[1:31:24] wanted
[1:31:24] he wanted to take up residence
[1:31:29] and so part of the plan of god
[1:31:33] is for god to dwell
[1:31:36] in you that
[1:31:39] that's what he wanted to do god couldn't
[1:31:43] dwell in uh
[1:31:46] something that was marred so
[1:31:50] what the lord jesus did is he paid the
[1:31:53] price for that
[1:31:55] and so we are washed under his blood and
[1:31:57] now
[1:31:58] through that blood we
[1:32:02] have access to the throne of god so god
[1:32:06] can dwell
[1:32:07] in us because
[1:32:10] that were redeemed so god
[1:32:13] chose to dwell in flesh
[1:32:17] and that's what we read you said in the
[1:32:20] beginning was the word
[1:32:23] right but then he said
[1:32:27] and the word was made flesh
[1:32:30] so we understand that that is the way
[1:32:34] that god planned it
[1:32:37] that that's the way that he is
[1:32:41] that he that he chose to do it so he
[1:32:45] chose to have preeminence he said
[1:32:48] now notice god himself veiled
[1:32:51] in human flesh this is
[1:32:54] a part of his way this
[1:32:58] is the way that he manifests
[1:33:01] himself to us manifesting the eternal
[1:33:05] word of god
[1:33:06] god made flesh
[1:33:10] so we we understand that god chose
[1:33:13] to make himself flesh or he chose to
[1:33:17] dwell
[1:33:18] in flesh so on the day when john was
[1:33:21] baptizing him
[1:33:23] right which was a type of justification
[1:33:26] purification
[1:33:28] the voice came down and said this is my
[1:33:30] beloved son
[1:33:31] in whom i'm pleased to dwell in
[1:33:36] or in whom i'm pleased
[1:33:40] not an external pleasure
[1:33:44] but a preemptual
[1:33:48] preeminence
[1:33:50] i'm pleased to dwell in him i'm going
[1:33:54] to dwell in him this is my beloved son
[1:33:57] in inside whom i'm pleased
[1:34:01] to dwell in and so
[1:34:05] he chose that way
[1:34:08] so god chose in the beginning
[1:34:11] he chose to create adam and and and
[1:34:14] put his attributes in adam and dwell in
[1:34:17] adam
[1:34:18] and so now he chose to dwell
[1:34:21] in uh in
[1:34:24] uh in jesus so god chose
[1:34:28] to to dwell
[1:34:31] in flesh so you know and if you
[1:34:35] if you spend time reading the unveiling
[1:34:38] of god
[1:34:39] you begin to see that this is what he's
[1:34:42] pointing out
[1:34:43] is that god veils himself in flesh
[1:34:47] that's the way he always does himself he
[1:34:50] hides himself behind the veil of flesh
[1:34:54] he used to hide himself beside behind
[1:34:57] the veil of badger skin
[1:34:59] but he ran that veil
[1:35:02] to show now he changed forms
[1:35:08] so he moved from dwelling in behind
[1:35:12] badger skin
[1:35:13] to now dwelling in flesh
[1:35:17] so he changed that form
[1:35:23] so now he's dwelling in
[1:35:26] flesh and he wanted to point to the
[1:35:29] people
[1:35:30] because there was every promise of the
[1:35:33] word of god
[1:35:36] everything that was prophesied in the
[1:35:38] old testament
[1:35:39] everything they were reading in that
[1:35:42] temple
[1:35:43] everything that they were reading in the
[1:35:45] scribes that they were teaching
[1:35:47] the the people every bit
[1:35:50] of the word of god was manifested in
[1:35:54] flesh
[1:35:55] the word of god always manifests
[1:35:59] itself in flesh the word is
[1:36:03] made flesh
[1:36:08] always we call it
[1:36:11] veiled in flesh or hidden flesh
[1:36:15] well it doesn't change the fact that it
[1:36:19] is dwelling in that flesh it can't be
[1:36:22] hid if it's not there
[1:36:28] you know if if these these glasses are
[1:36:31] right here
[1:36:33] so i can't come over here and say the
[1:36:35] glasses are hidden
[1:36:38] in my coat pocket no they're not
[1:36:42] hid in my coat pocket
[1:36:46] but you see these glasses
[1:36:49] now i take these glasses and i put them
[1:36:52] in my
[1:36:53] coat pocket you all know now
[1:36:57] right that they're hid in my coat pocket
[1:37:02] but if somebody else was to come in here
[1:37:07] they wouldn't know that they were hid
[1:37:11] in my coat pocket
[1:37:14] it would have to be revealed to them
[1:37:20] by something unseen
[1:37:25] that they were in my coat pocket
[1:37:28] and then by that revelation they could
[1:37:31] say
[1:37:32] those glasses are in your coat pocket
[1:37:38] so that's how the prophet of god's gift
[1:37:41] work those spirits would try to hide
[1:37:46] but he could go there and say oh that
[1:37:48] cancer's hid right here
[1:37:51] that spirit that's causing you to feel
[1:37:53] this way
[1:37:54] it's hid right there and what was he he
[1:37:58] was a discerner of the thoughts intents
[1:38:00] of the heart
[1:38:01] those spirits couldn't hide one of my
[1:38:03] favorite things
[1:38:04] is in that wonderful film where all of a
[1:38:07] sudden
[1:38:07] you can say he says you know i'm waiting
[1:38:09] for something
[1:38:11] you know i'm waiting for him he starts
[1:38:13] talking about he's going to africa and
[1:38:16] he's doing this and and you're sitting
[1:38:18] there you're wondering where the prayer
[1:38:19] line's going to start
[1:38:20] that humble servant of the lord he's not
[1:38:23] going to fake it
[1:38:25] it ain't going to be pretend he's going
[1:38:27] to stand there and he's going to wait on
[1:38:30] the lord because he's got a scripture
[1:38:33] right here that he knows they
[1:38:34] that wait upon the lord
[1:38:38] and all of a sudden that head goes back
[1:38:41] and you can see it's just like he's
[1:38:43] following that pillar of fire
[1:38:46] he goes then he turns and he goes he's
[1:38:49] here
[1:38:51] i take every spirit in this congregation
[1:38:54] under my control in the name of jesus
[1:38:57] christ oh i just like to shout it
[1:39:02] nothing was hit then
[1:39:06] it was unveiled everything became
[1:39:11] unveiled so we know that god always
[1:39:14] veils himself in flesh
[1:39:16] now you're part of the plan of god you
[1:39:18] know where i'm going with this
[1:39:20] i'm going that god bales himself in
[1:39:23] flesh that's part of his plan
[1:39:25] so god's plan is to veil this
[1:39:28] every word of god is veiled in flesh
[1:39:35] it's got to be manifested in flesh
[1:39:38] every promise is
[1:39:42] manifested in flesh
[1:39:45] by these exceedingly great and precious
[1:39:48] promises we become partakers
[1:39:51] of the divine nature of god
[1:39:54] so god's word is always manifested in
[1:39:58] flesh
[1:39:58] there's no way that you go out there and
[1:40:01] you see
[1:40:03] god god's not manifested
[1:40:06] in this piano
[1:40:12] now you might know the products were
[1:40:13] products of his creation
[1:40:16] and and i'm sure that you could find
[1:40:19] uh some way that god is in it but that
[1:40:23] piano on its own
[1:40:25] can't manifest god
[1:40:28] and he says and he says now notice
[1:40:32] every word that jesus reported back to
[1:40:36] them
[1:40:37] for they came to see who he was
[1:40:40] and they could not see him they seen the
[1:40:44] form
[1:40:46] but it was he was
[1:40:49] in his temple god was in his temple
[1:40:53] veiled in human flesh
[1:40:58] so god was in his temple that was god's
[1:41:01] temple they come to see
[1:41:03] god but they couldn't see him because he
[1:41:05] was veiled in his temple
[1:41:07] human flesh
[1:41:11] now you see the part that you play
[1:41:15] in the plan of god god chose in the
[1:41:18] beginning in the beginning was the word
[1:41:20] and the word was made flesh now once god
[1:41:24] did that that had to be the way he did
[1:41:27] it
[1:41:27] every time
[1:41:32] so when he was going to manifest himself
[1:41:34] again
[1:41:35] he had to manifest himself in flesh he
[1:41:38] had to manifest the word and flesh so
[1:41:40] from that time
[1:41:41] god's words always been manifested in
[1:41:44] flesh
[1:41:47] silver and gold have we none
[1:41:50] but that which we have go wait in the
[1:41:54] upper room until you're endured with
[1:41:56] power
[1:41:57] from on high it's always manifested in
[1:42:00] flesh
[1:42:01] too many times the church world
[1:42:05] and that's why it's denominationism
[1:42:09] is a curse but because they try to put
[1:42:13] god in temples made by hand
[1:42:18] and this is what they stoned stephen
[1:42:22] over
[1:42:24] because he said
[1:42:28] then he's talking about jesus he says
[1:42:30] which of our fathers
[1:42:32] that came after brought
[1:42:35] in with jesus into the possession of the
[1:42:39] gentiles
[1:42:40] whom god drove out before the face of
[1:42:43] our fathers
[1:42:44] and unto the days of david who found
[1:42:47] favor
[1:42:48] before god desired
[1:42:52] to find a tabernacle for god
[1:42:55] the god of jacob but solemn built him a
[1:42:58] house
[1:43:00] so you understand man was looking
[1:43:03] for a place for god to dwell
[1:43:10] they knew god was with them he showed up
[1:43:13] in a pillar of fire
[1:43:15] they were looking for a place for him to
[1:43:17] dwell
[1:43:18] now james see uh stephen's there
[1:43:22] preaching saying
[1:43:23] solomon built them a house
[1:43:27] our father's in the wilderness he was
[1:43:29] with them
[1:43:30] in a tabernacle in a pillar of fire and
[1:43:33] a cloud by night
[1:43:34] but they wanted a place for god to dwell
[1:43:37] now
[1:43:38] here comes stephen he says but solomon
[1:43:41] built him a house
[1:43:43] how be it the most high dwelleth
[1:43:46] not in temples made with hands
[1:43:51] as saith the prophet
[1:43:55] heaven and earth heaven is my throne
[1:43:59] and earth is my footstool what else will
[1:44:02] ye
[1:44:03] build me saith the lord
[1:44:06] or what place is the place
[1:44:09] of my rest hath not my hands made all
[1:44:13] these things he's looking at the vanity
[1:44:17] of man and say what do you mean you're
[1:44:19] going to build me a house
[1:44:25] the heavens is my throne the earth is my
[1:44:28] footstool
[1:44:32] you can't build me a house the choice
[1:44:36] is his where i'm gonna dwell
[1:44:42] so he chose to dwell
[1:44:45] in jesus
[1:44:51] so god was now in the form
[1:44:56] he took on the form just like he changed
[1:44:58] he came down
[1:45:00] you know he dwelt with the prophets and
[1:45:02] he came down but now the fullness of the
[1:45:04] godhead bodily was poured in him
[1:45:08] that's where he was that's where god
[1:45:10] chose to dwell
[1:45:12] and then when he went and redeemed
[1:45:16] his people and he paid the price
[1:45:20] for his plan so he dwelleth not
[1:45:24] in temples made of hands but read
[1:45:27] first let's go to saint john just for a
[1:45:29] moment
[1:45:32] and and go to the
[1:45:36] 14th chapter
[1:45:50] and the 17th verse
[1:45:58] and he said and i will pray i'm sorry
[1:46:02] go ahead everybody
[1:46:05] turn your pages
[1:46:08] i suggest that you really know your
[1:46:10] bible real good
[1:46:12] so you know just about where in it all
[1:46:14] these scriptures lie
[1:46:16] and i pray the father that he shall give
[1:46:18] you another comforter
[1:46:20] that he may abide with you forever
[1:46:24] even the spirit of truth
[1:46:27] whom the world cannot receive because it
[1:46:30] seeth him not why because he's invisible
[1:46:36] the unseen god but the unseen god is
[1:46:40] manifested or made known in flesh
[1:46:43] so he chose to dwell in flesh and he
[1:46:46] says
[1:46:47] neither knoweth him but ye know him
[1:46:51] for he dwelleth with you and
[1:46:54] shall be in you
[1:47:00] so that was the promise
[1:47:03] so now he's saying he's dwelling with
[1:47:06] you
[1:47:08] because he's in dwelling in jesus
[1:47:11] but jesus knows he's going to go to
[1:47:14] calvary
[1:47:15] no he's going to take the curse of sin
[1:47:19] off his children and now he's going to
[1:47:23] change
[1:47:24] forms from dwelling with us to dwelling
[1:47:28] in us
[1:47:31] god dwells
[1:47:35] in flesh from that time
[1:47:39] god moved upon
[1:47:44] the prophets of old
[1:47:47] but now god was going to make a change
[1:47:50] he was making an emorphy he was
[1:47:54] changing his form so he
[1:47:57] changed his form from dwelling in jesus
[1:48:00] to dwelling in his bride
[1:48:06] and these two became one
[1:48:10] they couldn't see it
[1:48:14] he said they couldn't understand
[1:48:18] why that they couldn't see
[1:48:21] him there stood a man they came to see
[1:48:25] god and they seen a man
[1:48:28] see they couldn't see god because god
[1:48:32] veiled it to them now keep that on your
[1:48:35] mind
[1:48:35] god veiled in a man they could say
[1:48:39] no man could do these works except
[1:48:43] god it be god no man can do it
[1:48:48] and how here standing a man
[1:48:51] and yet the works of god is manifested
[1:48:54] through him
[1:48:55] see they couldn't understand that god
[1:48:59] was veiled
[1:49:02] in other words god chose to dwell
[1:49:08] he's veiled in a man
[1:49:11] as he always was veiled
[1:49:14] he was veiled unto them
[1:49:18] he was in he he was
[1:49:21] in his human temple
[1:49:26] god was in a human temple
[1:49:30] now be real careful now he's the same
[1:49:33] yesterday
[1:49:34] today and forever see god
[1:49:37] hiding himself from the world
[1:49:40] veiled in human
[1:49:43] being
[1:49:49] here was god the greek
[1:49:52] said we would see him
[1:49:56] god veiled in the form of man hid
[1:49:59] himself from their view
[1:50:01] they could only see a man but those
[1:50:04] predestinated
[1:50:06] seeing god saw man the others saw
[1:50:11] god so you understand
[1:50:14] that god
[1:50:19] so there's a part that you play
[1:50:23] in god's plan
[1:50:27] you understand first of all he wanted to
[1:50:29] manifest himself
[1:50:31] show himself now the part that we play
[1:50:34] in his plan is that now he wants to have
[1:50:38] a place
[1:50:39] to dwell
[1:50:43] or have preeminence
[1:50:48] he doesn't dwell in temples
[1:50:51] at one time he did
[1:50:55] but he rent that veil
[1:50:59] he moved out and said this is my beloved
[1:51:02] son
[1:51:03] in who i'm veiled in there he was
[1:51:05] unveiled in human beings
[1:51:07] now he goes to calvary
[1:51:11] and he keeps saying i'm going to come
[1:51:14] back
[1:51:16] he says so i'm not going to leave you
[1:51:18] comfortless.
[1:51:22] i will come again to you
[1:51:28] so there he goes to calvary
[1:51:32] he pays the price he goes preaches the
[1:51:36] gospel
[1:51:37] in the regions of the lost
[1:51:40] he comes back and he tells them go into
[1:51:43] the upper room
[1:51:45] until you're endued with power from on
[1:51:48] high
[1:51:49] go up there because now i'm going to
[1:51:52] come
[1:51:53] and dwell in you i won't only be
[1:51:56] with you but i'll be in you
[1:52:00] you call me master and lord for you say
[1:52:02] well for so i am
[1:52:05] but the time's going to come that the
[1:52:07] works i do
[1:52:08] you shall do also because i'm going to
[1:52:11] be
[1:52:12] dwelling in you
[1:52:17] oh
[1:52:22] let me tell you every promise of god is
[1:52:25] manifested in the flesh now you say why
[1:52:29] did i
[1:52:30] mention paul
[1:52:34] because paul knew what he was
[1:52:37] but he knew it was what came in him
[1:52:40] that made him different no wonder the
[1:52:43] prophet of god said pray who's within
[1:52:45] you
[1:52:49] that's god's plan you say what part do i
[1:52:52] play in god's plan
[1:52:53] you now become the dwelling place
[1:52:58] that god dwells in you the word
[1:53:02] always is veiled in flesh
[1:53:06] malachi and this is what brother brahms
[1:53:07] preaching this message he's trying to
[1:53:09] tell him
[1:53:10] this is the age this is the time
[1:53:15] that god is showing this church
[1:53:19] that he's manifested in flesh
[1:53:22] so there was malachi 4 5 manifested in
[1:53:26] flesh
[1:53:27] there was luke 17 30 manifested in flesh
[1:53:31] there was revelations 10 7 manifested in
[1:53:34] flesh
[1:53:35] but they couldn't see it because god
[1:53:37] doesn't dwell in temples made of hands
[1:53:40] he doesn't dwell in organizations he
[1:53:42] doesn't dwell in systems
[1:53:44] he doesn't dwell in plan god dwells in
[1:53:48] beings
[1:53:53] any human being so here was
[1:53:56] the word of god
[1:54:00] malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10
[1:54:03] 7 here was the word of god
[1:54:06] that they could study and had been
[1:54:09] studying
[1:54:11] and placing it in john and placing it in
[1:54:14] the two
[1:54:16] people coming to israel and placing it
[1:54:19] here
[1:54:20] and placing it there but god comes down
[1:54:23] and manifests it in flesh
[1:54:28] and here's the word why did he do that
[1:54:31] because
[1:54:32] what we were having was is that god
[1:54:35] dwells
[1:54:36] in his bride here on earth
[1:54:39] and what called out that bride was the
[1:54:42] word made
[1:54:43] flesh revealing to that bride that
[1:54:47] this is god's dwelling place
[1:54:51] this is the part that we play the part
[1:54:55] that we play
[1:54:56] in this end time is this elect lady not
[1:54:59] christian like tabernacle not the
[1:55:02] assembling and fellowshipping of
[1:55:03] ourselves together
[1:55:05] worldwide is a group of people that have
[1:55:10] the same belief in the same faith but
[1:55:12] it's that god dwelling
[1:55:14] in that individual god dwelling in flesh
[1:55:20] and he's and he's he he's he's
[1:55:23] dwelling in flesh oh brother sister
[1:55:28] are you catching it look don't you see
[1:55:32] it's been veiled through these ages
[1:55:35] according
[1:55:36] to what god said and it will be
[1:55:39] opened in the last days through those
[1:55:42] seven seals
[1:55:43] would be broke and the full thing
[1:55:46] would come into the view of the people
[1:55:49] what
[1:55:50] took place all along the
[1:55:53] hour of the seventh angel's message the
[1:55:56] mystery of god
[1:55:57] should be made known in elijah this last
[1:56:01] hour
[1:56:02] how that christ is put
[1:56:05] out of his church the son of god
[1:56:09] how is how he is revealed as son of man
[1:56:13] again how that the church
[1:56:16] is to be put in order
[1:56:19] and everything for the last days no
[1:56:22] creeds
[1:56:23] no denomination just absolutely
[1:56:27] the word living in
[1:56:30] the individual
[1:56:37] hallelujah
[1:56:40] now we know our part in the plan of god
[1:56:42] in the last day
[1:56:44] god is going to dwell in an individual
[1:56:48] people
[1:56:49] that's called his bride
[1:56:57] i'll take one and leave one i'll take
[1:57:01] and leave that one there's just there's
[1:57:04] no strings
[1:57:06] no denominations no buildings
[1:57:09] or nothing it's the heart with god
[1:57:13] and him alone
[1:57:18] just think about it this is the part
[1:57:22] that we play
[1:57:27] the heart alone with god god dwelling
[1:57:31] in the individual god dwelling
[1:57:34] in his bride amen and
[1:57:38] he's failed in flesh now you you think
[1:57:40] that
[1:57:41] you go back and you understand that
[1:57:44] the prophet of god said i preached the
[1:57:46] same thing paul preached
[1:57:49] this was paul's message to the gentiles
[1:57:56] he comes and dwells he's here to live in
[1:57:59] human flesh
[1:58:02] he's here to be that that's what paul
[1:58:04] was preaching
[1:58:05] and here comes this little white horse
[1:58:09] rider
[1:58:12] trying to rob it from the people
[1:58:15] trying to steal it from them just
[1:58:19] in a little lie the deeds of
[1:58:22] nickelodeonism
[1:58:23] the deeds of stealing it away from an
[1:58:26] individual
[1:58:27] and giving it back to a priesthood
[1:58:31] that was what jesus came
[1:58:34] and stood against that's what peter
[1:58:37] stood against
[1:58:38] he don't dwell in temples made of man
[1:58:41] he don't dwell in churches
[1:58:44] he don't dwell in faith
[1:58:49] he doesn't dwell in doctrines
[1:58:53] he dwells in individuals so you can sit
[1:58:56] back
[1:58:57] and say wow this is the part that i play
[1:59:00] i'm here to be a temple
[1:59:05] that god dwells in
[1:59:08] because god don't dwell in christian
[1:59:10] life tabernacle
[1:59:12] the only way god got here is if you
[1:59:14] brought them
[1:59:20] i've been here when you're not here it's
[1:59:24] a stone
[1:59:24] cold dead building
[1:59:28] building has no life these walls don't
[1:59:31] breathe
[1:59:32] these walls don't talk
[1:59:36] these walls don't feel
[1:59:42] that's why he couldn't be satisfied with
[1:59:45] creation alone
[1:59:50] he made you to have preeminence
[1:59:54] not rule over he made you
[1:59:57] so he could dwell in you
[2:00:01] you could be his presence
[2:00:04] here on earth
[2:00:10] just think of it
[2:00:13] he wanted to make himself known now he
[2:00:16] wants to dwell
[2:00:19] he wants to live just grab your bibles
[2:00:22] now we're closing
[2:00:31] so let's just remember now read it again
[2:00:34] and then you turn
[2:00:35] in your bibles to first corinthians the
[2:00:37] third chapter
[2:00:39] the 16th and 17th verse
[2:00:48] he says i'll send you the comforter the
[2:00:50] spirit of truth
[2:00:52] he says you know him
[2:00:55] because here i am standing right here
[2:00:57] with you
[2:01:01] he says you know him
[2:01:06] but ye know him for he dwelleth with you
[2:01:13] and now he says and shall
[2:01:16] be in you so now here these disciples go
[2:01:20] out right
[2:01:21] and so you go over to
[2:01:24] first corinthians
[2:01:29] and what's he say know ye
[2:01:33] not that ye are the temple of god
[2:01:37] and that the spirit of god dwelleth
[2:01:41] in you
[2:01:44] wow just think god created me
[2:01:49] placed me here in this last day
[2:01:52] even though i was a sinner like paul
[2:01:57] he met me with a pillar of fire
[2:02:02] cleansed me from all unrighteousness
[2:02:05] and now wants to take his abode and
[2:02:08] dwelt
[2:02:09] in me so that he can continue
[2:02:14] the works that he did
[2:02:17] him doing the works but
[2:02:20] having a form to do it in
[2:02:24] it's still him doing the works he's the
[2:02:28] healer
[2:02:29] it's still him doing the deliverance but
[2:02:31] now
[2:02:32] he's changed the form that he's working
[2:02:35] through
[2:02:39] he waived that first sheep offering
[2:02:43] he waived that son of man ministry where
[2:02:45] we saw god
[2:02:46] dwelled in human flesh doing the works
[2:02:50] now he tells the church that the church
[2:02:53] this seed is going to come into the
[2:02:55] maturity
[2:02:56] and the works that i do shall you do
[2:02:58] also
[2:03:02] because i go to the father and if i go
[2:03:04] to the father i will come again
[2:03:08] that where i am you may be also not
[2:03:11] i am out in space not i am out in heaven
[2:03:14] but where i am in the relationship
[2:03:17] with the eternal father
[2:03:23] father that they may be one
[2:03:27] as we are one amen
[2:03:31] think of it that's where he was
[2:03:36] he did nothing
[2:03:39] till the father showed them
[2:03:43] if i do not the works of my father
[2:03:47] then why do you condemn me
[2:03:50] and there is he saying why do you
[2:03:52] condemn me that god dwells in me
[2:03:56] they should have been happy
[2:04:04] predestinated saw it predestinators saw
[2:04:10] that that was god
[2:04:13] in that man
[2:04:16] so let's read this
[2:04:20] what is it that you're the temple of god
[2:04:24] and and the spirit of god dwell in you
[2:04:27] and if any man defile the temple of god
[2:04:30] him shall god destroy
[2:04:32] for the temple of god is holy
[2:04:36] which temple are
[2:04:39] ye let's turn over
[2:04:43] a page in your bible you should be able
[2:04:44] to turn over a page
[2:04:46] to the sixth chapter and the twentieth
[2:04:50] verse
[2:04:53] and let's start with the 19th verse
[2:04:55] which is the birth just below the 20th
[2:04:58] verse
[2:04:59] so we will start with chapter 6 verse
[2:05:04] 19.
[2:05:06] what know ye not
[2:05:09] that your body is the temple
[2:05:13] of the holy ghost which is in you
[2:05:18] which ye have of god and ye are not your
[2:05:22] own
[2:05:25] you say why aren't you your own because
[2:05:28] he has the preeminence
[2:05:33] and what his preeminence was not to have
[2:05:37] a bunch of recognition
[2:05:41] and not to have a bunch of accolades
[2:05:44] laid on him
[2:05:45] of how great he is and how wonderful he
[2:05:47] is and what a powerful god he is
[2:05:50] no his preeminence was that i can dwell
[2:05:54] in there
[2:05:59] you are not your own why aren't you your
[2:06:02] own because he is preeminence
[2:06:04] for you are bought with a price
[2:06:07] therefore glorify god in your body
[2:06:11] and your spirit which our
[2:06:15] gods god takes preeminence
[2:06:20] by dwelling
[2:06:24] go over into first corinthians the sixth
[2:06:27] second corinthians
[2:06:50] see if i can find it here
[2:06:53] second corinthians the sixth chapter
[2:07:01] the 16th verse
[2:07:08] what agreement hath the temple of god
[2:07:12] with idols
[2:07:15] for ye are the temple
[2:07:18] of the living god
[2:07:24] as god hath said i will dwell in them
[2:07:30] and walk in them and i will be
[2:07:34] their god and they shall be
[2:07:37] my people
[2:07:40] hallelujah this bride
[2:07:44] was not set apart to be
[2:07:48] a more scriptural
[2:07:51] abiding people
[2:07:55] or a more doctrinally
[2:07:59] sound people or a more
[2:08:03] scripturally revelated people
[2:08:12] let us leave the doctrines of laying on
[2:08:14] of hands of
[2:08:16] the mysteries and things but let us move
[2:08:18] on
[2:08:19] to perfection
[2:08:22] do you understand when that which is
[2:08:24] perfect is come
[2:08:26] that that which is perfect is not the
[2:08:34] bible it's perfect letter
[2:08:39] but the same letter killeth
[2:08:42] but that which is perfect was when
[2:08:45] this word dwells
[2:08:49] in flesh that's why
[2:08:52] he was perfect because the word was made
[2:08:55] flesh
[2:08:56] and the scriptures come back and say
[2:08:59] be ye perfect as he was perfect
[2:09:03] what made him perfect was that god dwelt
[2:09:06] there
[2:09:10] that's our part
[2:09:13] i can't determine the measure
[2:09:22] but i know he dwells in is elected
[2:09:27] he you should know he's in there
[2:09:33] if someone came to you and said knock
[2:09:35] knock who's there
[2:09:37] you should say the spirit of god
[2:09:43] because he promised that he would come
[2:09:45] again
[2:09:47] and not only be with me another is
[2:09:49] working on my behalf
[2:09:51] like jesus did he worked on our behalf
[2:09:55] but now he'll be within us and because
[2:09:58] he's
[2:09:59] there the works that i do shall you do
[2:10:02] also
[2:10:04] because i'm going to come and dwell
[2:10:07] in you you say what
[2:10:11] so so many times we think that our part
[2:10:15] is believing
[2:10:18] and only believing what is taught
[2:10:23] in other words we think our part is to
[2:10:25] say the baptism in the name of the lord
[2:10:27] jesus christ is the correct baptism
[2:10:31] amen that's my job stay amen
[2:10:35] there's only one god one person amen
[2:10:39] that's my job my job's just to
[2:10:41] it
[2:10:44] and we so we misinterpret
[2:10:49] what prophet of god said the evidence of
[2:10:52] the holy spirit is to amen
[2:10:54] every word of god
[2:10:57] and we take that on the carnal side
[2:11:00] but that's not what amen means amen
[2:11:03] means
[2:11:04] so be it
[2:11:10] so when he says i'll pour out my spirit
[2:11:15] upon all flesh
[2:11:19] you say so be it come dwell in me
[2:11:23] come manifest in the flesh come make
[2:11:26] that word live in the flesh
[2:11:28] because anyone that says that word that
[2:11:31] jesus christ
[2:11:32] has not come in the flesh not 2 000
[2:11:35] years ago
[2:11:36] right today is antichrist
[2:11:43] think of it you're called to play that
[2:11:47] part
[2:11:49] don't get caught up in this world
[2:11:54] that's why the scripture says separate
[2:11:56] yourself from the world
[2:11:58] aren't you glad thank god for this virus
[2:12:01] that makes me stay six feet away from
[2:12:04] all these demons
[2:12:14] can you imagine i'd go home and leslie
[2:12:17] cranks up some old
[2:12:18] rock station or some old
[2:12:21] country music station so we can be
[2:12:24] eating out
[2:12:30] oh we're just devastated there's no
[2:12:32] restaurant well all you sisters can
[2:12:35] invite me and leslie over to eat
[2:12:38] we would love to come to your restaurant
[2:12:44] i probably shouldn't do that i'm sorry i
[2:12:46] shouldn't have said that
[2:12:47] you can just make me a cake or something
[2:12:49] and bring it to me some peach cobbler
[2:12:51] something
[2:12:52] no but you understand
[2:12:56] we're almost devastated that we can't
[2:13:00] make contact
[2:13:02] with the corruptness that's out there
[2:13:06] well what's going to happen to our
[2:13:07] economy
[2:13:10] i know one thing the righteous won't beg
[2:13:13] bread
[2:13:14] that's thus saith the lord
[2:13:21] and that's what he said i'd rather eat
[2:13:22] bark off of trees and drink branch water
[2:13:26] than be a part of this world
[2:13:30] i don't know why the circumstance
[2:13:33] but i know one thing the circumstance is
[2:13:36] going to manifest
[2:13:37] that god is dwelling in a people
[2:13:45] listen now let's go back to start from
[2:13:47] the beginning let's read this
[2:13:50] what agreement have the temple
[2:13:54] of god with idols i got no
[2:13:58] agreement with him no
[2:14:01] plan in other words i'm not relying
[2:14:05] and trusting him to provide anything
[2:14:09] to me satan
[2:14:13] if you'll give me a raise i'll work
[2:14:16] sundays
[2:14:20] or if you get me this loan i'll work
[2:14:23] seven days a week i ain't got no
[2:14:26] agreement with idols
[2:14:29] we're the temple of the living god
[2:14:32] we already know this god can create
[2:14:34] bread
[2:14:35] we already know this god can raise the
[2:14:37] dead we already know this god can turn
[2:14:40] water into wine we already know this god
[2:14:42] can take 12
[2:14:44] loaves or earth six loaves and feed ten
[2:14:46] thousand and five
[2:14:48] thousand and break fishes he said you
[2:14:50] already know this god said why
[2:14:52] murmur amongst yourself that you have no
[2:14:55] bread
[2:15:00] you don't think he was sitting there
[2:15:01] saying come on guys
[2:15:03] don't you remember the 12 baskets what's
[2:15:06] wrong with you
[2:15:08] you don't think i can feed you
[2:15:14] oh what are we gonna do about the tax
[2:15:16] man barbara gary what are you gonna do
[2:15:17] about the tax man
[2:15:18] go fishing
[2:15:26] right what are you gonna do if you
[2:15:29] toiled all night
[2:15:31] throw the net on the other side
[2:15:37] who can pluck you out of the palm
[2:15:41] of my hand
[2:15:45] if i started to work in you i'll finish
[2:15:48] it
[2:15:48] don't you understand his finally
[2:15:51] dwelling in a people is his finished
[2:15:55] work
[2:15:57] he's transferring the resurrection
[2:16:01] power from his flesh to your flesh
[2:16:05] hallelujah
[2:16:12] if the same spirit that dwelt in jesus
[2:16:16] christ
[2:16:17] dwell in you it will also quicken
[2:16:20] your mortal body why because that's the
[2:16:24] third
[2:16:24] part of his plan is to bring you back to
[2:16:28] where you were in the beginning
[2:16:33] first of all he manifests himself
[2:16:35] secondly he dwells in you
[2:16:37] thirdly he takes you back to where you
[2:16:40] were in the beginning
[2:16:44] oh don't you see our part where we are
[2:16:51] he's here to dwell in you
[2:16:55] clean your mind now let's finish the
[2:16:58] scripture
[2:17:03] what agreement hath the temple of god
[2:17:06] with idols
[2:17:07] for ye are the temple of the living god
[2:17:12] as god had said
[2:17:15] now here it is being fulfilled in flesh
[2:17:18] i will dwell in them
[2:17:22] and walk in them the works that i do
[2:17:27] you shall do also it's not me that does
[2:17:30] the work
[2:17:30] jesus said it's the father that is
[2:17:33] in me that does the work it's not
[2:17:37] us that does the work it's the god
[2:17:40] that's in us that does the work we're
[2:17:43] just carrying out his word
[2:17:45] lay hands on the sick
[2:17:48] pray cast out
[2:18:01] and they shall be my people wherefore
[2:18:04] come out
[2:18:06] from among them and be ye
[2:18:10] separate saith the lord
[2:18:15] and touch not the unclean thing
[2:18:18] and i will receive you
[2:18:22] and will be a father unto you
[2:18:25] and ye shall be my sons and my daughters
[2:18:29] saith the almighty
[2:18:33] amen praise god
[2:18:36] you see god's always veiled in flesh
[2:18:41] and he's unveiled in the same
[2:18:45] amen amen just think your part
[2:18:50] and you say well look at me
[2:18:53] i say look at paul
[2:18:58] paul said i was the chiefest of sinners
[2:19:02] i laid waste to the church
[2:19:06] but when he met me on that day
[2:19:09] is because my name was written in the
[2:19:11] lamb's book of lights
[2:19:13] and that had to be manifested in flesh
[2:19:17] every word of god which you are
[2:19:21] and if your name was written on the
[2:19:23] lamb's book of life
[2:19:25] that was the word of god or the thought
[2:19:28] of god
[2:19:29] every thought of god is manifested
[2:19:33] in the flesh because in the beginning
[2:19:35] was the word
[2:19:36] and the word was made
[2:19:40] flesh so every promise
[2:19:43] every time how many times have you heard
[2:19:46] the prophet
[2:19:47] god said ye are the word of god
[2:19:50] you're the word of god for this age
[2:19:52] you're the word of god for this time
[2:19:54] you're the word of god for this season
[2:19:59] your god does not the scripture itself
[2:20:03] say ye that are you are gods why are you
[2:20:06] gods
[2:20:07] because god dwells
[2:20:11] in you god bless you brother billy if
[2:20:13] he'd come and
[2:20:15] it's really here
[2:20:24] they're pointing back there like brother
[2:20:26] branham preach here he is
[2:20:30] aren't you happy
[2:20:34] see you think well i'm a wreck
[2:20:37] god fix rex in order to carry out his
[2:20:40] word
[2:20:42] if your name's in the lamb's book life i
[2:20:44] don't care what kind of wreck
[2:20:46] you're in
[2:20:51] his words has to be manifested
[2:20:54] so i rest in that nothing can put your
[2:20:56] name on the book
[2:20:58] nothing can take the name off
[2:21:02] the prophet said you can save god a lot
[2:21:04] of trouble
[2:21:07] if you'll just line up but if you want
[2:21:11] he'll line you up
[2:21:16] but i'd rather have that promise right
[2:21:19] than to think that it would be all over
[2:21:21] for me
[2:21:24] you see our part i mean we want to build
[2:21:26] a bigger building we're building that
[2:21:28] building for our flesh
[2:21:32] you know just like when you have three
[2:21:34] kids you move from a two-bedroom
[2:21:36] to a three-bedroom
[2:21:40] when they get teenagers you might better
[2:21:42] think about getting that fourth bedroom
[2:21:48] you do that for the flesh
[2:21:53] you know so but where god dwells as in a
[2:21:56] people
[2:21:59] we don't go to church to find god
[2:22:04] we go to church to hear the word of god
[2:22:07] but you find god
[2:22:09] in here he's in that seed
[2:22:13] that's in your heart he's in that
[2:22:17] that deep like i love that song sisters
[2:22:21] he's in that deep that's calling
[2:22:26] it's when you hear that word of god you
[2:22:28] feel that anointing and it just stirs
[2:22:30] you
[2:22:30] and you know there's something there you
[2:22:32] know there's a longing in your heart
[2:22:36] i know for a fact god can make that
[2:22:39] longing
[2:22:40] so real that it consumes you
[2:22:46] i know what it's like to be so desperate
[2:22:48] for god
[2:22:50] they're so hungry for god so wanting out
[2:22:53] of the life i was in
[2:22:54] so wanting out of the condition i was in
[2:22:57] so
[2:22:57] full of despair
[2:22:59] [Music]
[2:23:02] could harley take it i told my mom i
[2:23:05] said mom i'm going to kill myself
[2:23:08] she said now calm down son
[2:23:14] all my friends do it
[2:23:18] they rolled joints for me by the
[2:23:20] hundreds
[2:23:23] smoke this smoke this this will make you
[2:23:25] feel better take this eat this
[2:23:27] drink this gallons are a ripple in my
[2:23:31] house
[2:23:33] pounds of drugs
[2:23:37] [Music]
[2:23:40] could be such under the influence i had
[2:23:42] no
[2:23:44] control over my senses
[2:23:47] my heart on my heart
[2:23:50] i just cried out and cried out and cried
[2:23:54] out
[2:23:58] finally one of my friends looked at me
[2:24:00] he'd give me everything in the arsenal
[2:24:03] for the flesh and out of his mouth
[2:24:06] like god speaking out of the mule
[2:24:11] he said why don't you read the bible
[2:24:14] [Music]
[2:24:17] another i don't know nothing else in the
[2:24:19] world that come help you
[2:24:21] why don't you try that god book
[2:24:26] i got that god book flipped it open i
[2:24:29] said all right i'll read it
[2:24:31] they're on a rooftop i read romans
[2:24:34] chapter one
[2:24:38] and the unseen god
[2:24:42] failed himself in human flesh
[2:24:47] you don't believe that if you don't
[2:24:49] believe that you've
[2:24:50] never been converted
[2:24:57] because he said i will not leave you
[2:24:58] comfortless but i will come again
[2:25:00] and i'll be with you and i'll be in you
[2:25:04] even until the end he said nothing can
[2:25:08] pluck you out of the palm of my hand
[2:25:10] and if i start to work i'll finish it
[2:25:15] oh my then all of a sudden i started to
[2:25:18] see wow
[2:25:21] my job isn't to build the church i found
[2:25:23] out the other day there's a lot of men
[2:25:26] that can build the church better than i
[2:25:27] can
[2:25:30] but i will preach the gospel and the
[2:25:33] gospel is
[2:25:35] this is the age that he can
[2:25:39] dwell in a pure unadulterated
[2:25:43] bought washed redeemed
[2:25:47] bride
[2:25:48] [Music]
[2:25:50] and he will be on this earth
[2:25:53] when he leaves he will be in human
[2:25:58] fleshly formed when he leaves
[2:26:02] this earth jesus rose in the flesh
[2:26:05] this bride will rise in the flesh
[2:26:09] [Music]
[2:26:13] you say well what happens if you die
[2:26:16] brother mcgary
[2:26:17] i'm going to go to that waiting place
[2:26:24] i'm looking to go back to eden and i
[2:26:27] believe it
[2:26:28] that's your purpose that's your part
[2:26:31] in the plan of god why are we building a
[2:26:34] church because we love one another
[2:26:37] why are we building churches because we
[2:26:38] want to have room for our sunday school
[2:26:40] we want to have places of fellowship we
[2:26:42] want to have some place we can serve god
[2:26:45] and invite people but it's all in vain
[2:26:49] if he doesn't dwell on the heart
[2:26:52] and the lives of individuals don't
[2:26:55] forget that
[2:26:56] don't let the temporary world separate
[2:26:59] yourself
[2:27:01] under your calling to be the temple
[2:27:06] of the living god if you're not baptized
[2:27:09] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[2:27:11] that word has to be manifested
[2:27:15] in your flesh if you're baptized in the
[2:27:18] father son and holy ghost you do not
[2:27:20] have christian baptism
[2:27:22] you have the baptism of three gods
[2:27:26] if you're baptized in the name of the
[2:27:29] father
[2:27:30] son and holy ghost you believe there are
[2:27:32] three gods
[2:27:34] that make up one god
[2:27:39] you know who figured that one out don't
[2:27:42] you
[2:27:43] lucifer
[2:27:44] [Music]
[2:27:47] oh you can't say that brother mcgeary
[2:27:48] yes i can say that
[2:27:51] it's the mark of the beast
[2:27:54] there's only one god
[2:27:58] it isn't the third person that dwells in
[2:28:01] you
[2:28:02] or anoints you it's god himself
[2:28:06] the one person god
[2:28:10] see god's a manifesto he's always been a
[2:28:13] manifesto
[2:28:15] he always shows himself so in order to
[2:28:19] reveal himself
[2:28:20] he had to be a father in creation
[2:28:24] [Music]
[2:28:25] he had to reveal himself as a son
[2:28:28] so we could understand that we're sons
[2:28:31] and daughters
[2:28:34] that he was the firstborn
[2:28:36] [Music]
[2:28:39] we're joined heirs to every promise he
[2:28:42] was a promise of
[2:28:44] he had to come as a son
[2:28:47] in order to do that and then he had to
[2:28:50] return
[2:28:52] back
[2:28:54] in the office of the holy spirit so he
[2:28:57] could put the same life
[2:28:58] that resurrected him put it back in us
[2:29:03] get away from that devil baptism
[2:29:06] in the name of the father and son and
[2:29:07] the holy ghost else you'll find yourself
[2:29:10] in the fire of hell because you held on
[2:29:14] to a pope instead of a gospel
[2:29:18] you could say i'm baptist no you're
[2:29:20] catholic
[2:29:24] it's a demon baptism
[2:29:29] he said the catholic church was nothing
[2:29:33] but the worst form of spiritualism that
[2:29:36] ever existed
[2:29:38] people praying to saints
[2:29:40] [Music]
[2:29:42] oh you're going to lose your federal
[2:29:44] funding if you preach like that
[2:29:47] didn't have their federal funding i want
[2:29:51] something that
[2:29:52] transforms people into resurrection
[2:29:54] material
[2:29:55] don't you i want a rapture don't you
[2:29:59] amen
[2:30:02] don't play with this gospel
[2:30:05] let's get real amen i don't
[2:30:08] mean to get upset but
[2:30:12] don't you just hate a liar
[2:30:15] i hate a liar
[2:30:20] and satan's the father all lies
[2:30:24] so i just want you to know i'm sorry i'm
[2:30:26] trying to become a better christian
[2:30:28] but i don't love satan
[2:30:32] so if you think that you need to pray
[2:30:34] for me
[2:30:37] go ahead
[2:30:40] but i know what he's going to do with
[2:30:42] them
[2:30:43] [Music]
[2:30:44] so i want nothing to do with him because
[2:30:47] there's a lake of fire
[2:30:51] prepared for satan and all those angels
[2:30:55] would you rather be a child of god
[2:30:57] wouldn't you rather take your position
[2:30:59] in christ
[2:31:00] wouldn't you rather open your heart and
[2:31:02] say come live in me lord
[2:31:04] come dwell in me lord i'm here this
[2:31:06] morning
[2:31:07] i'm going to give myself the promise for
[2:31:10] this age i've been like saul
[2:31:12] i i've been like a sinner but i want you
[2:31:15] to come today
[2:31:17] and dwell in me i want you to dwell in
[2:31:20] me lord
[2:31:22] i'd be baptized in your name for the
[2:31:24] remission of my sins lord
[2:31:26] because you promised if i would you'd
[2:31:28] fill me with your spirit
[2:31:30] [Music]
[2:31:31] oh i want to be part i want to play my
[2:31:34] part
[2:31:36] in the plan of god don't you let's stand
[2:31:40] together
[2:31:45] amen maybe if you bowed your head
[2:31:47] [Music]
[2:31:49] and you want to lift your hand this
[2:31:51] morning and say lord i'd like to play
[2:31:53] my part in your plan

[2:32:00] for ordained to walk in
[2:32:05] lord i want to know my calling
[2:32:09] i want to know what you'd have me to do
[2:32:11] [Music]

[2:32:16] dwell in
[2:32:20] i want to come up from the world and be
[2:32:22] separate
[2:32:27] lord we're in this fulfillment
[2:32:33] of you taking the preeminence or the
[2:32:36] dwelling
[2:32:36] in of your church that the same spirit
[2:32:40] that raised christ from the dead can
[2:32:42] dwell in us
[2:32:44] and it would also quicken our body
[2:32:47] lord we ask that you would grant that
[2:32:52] lord i don't yell at the people i i yell
[2:32:54] at that
[2:32:55] lying doctrine of the devil that keeps
[2:32:58] people from being whom they are called
[2:33:01] to be
[2:33:02] [Music]
[2:33:04] bless this people father they come out
[2:33:07] this morning
[2:33:08] others were courteous and they stayed
[2:33:12] home but
[2:33:13] you're not a god of this building go
[2:33:16] right down to where they are
[2:33:17] and touch their heart
[2:33:20] may they never be ashamed to
[2:33:23] stand on your word may there be no
